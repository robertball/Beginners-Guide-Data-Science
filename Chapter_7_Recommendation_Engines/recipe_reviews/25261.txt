i've made this ketchup three times already and anyone who tries it, loves it! instead of the fennel bulb, i use ground fennel and replace the salt with sea salt. i've never strained it because the consistency has always been fine. every homemade ketchup i've tried has been a bit thick so i don't mind it. and remember to dump out your crappy store bought ketchup and use the empty bottle for your awesome home-brewed one!

This turned out better than I expected. The flavor is a little strange... but in a good way, if that makes any sense! I personally don't think it is anything like regular ketchup; I thought it was almost like a spicy savory apple sauce. Anyway, I removed the cloves and star anise before blending it, and I had to push it through the sieve because it was so thick. (PS If, like me, you don't want to buy large and expensive amounts of spices you don't use very often, check out your Indian grocer - I buy a 1.5oz bag of Mixed Spices, including cinnamon sticks, cardamon, cloves, star anise and peppercorns, for $1.59. Bargain!)

Now I will comment after the fact.  This ketchup turned out to be very tasty.  I used a little green pepper in my first batch, fennel seed rather than the bulb, and a lot more tomatoes than the recipe called for.  In previous attempts to make ketchup, I have used some cinammon and allspice. ( I may go drop a few balls of the latter into the pot that is simmering on the stove right now.)  Wouldn't hurt to add some fresh ginger if you had a bit on hand.

I remember homemade ketchup from my childhood and YUCK.  Being all grown up now, I decided to try this recipe and it is wonderful. I replaced the fennel with fennel seed, the star anise with anise extract and the cloves with allspice. Original recipe says it makes 16 servings - so figure ea serving is approx 1 T.  I tripled it without a problem.  I also put everything in my crockpot on high until it was heated through. then on low WITHOUT a lid - cooked it overnight then put everything through a sieve in the morning and back into the crock pot on low until I had the desired thickness I wanted. I plan on making it again over the winter with the tomato juice I canned this summer. Ummm.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time, I couldn't get star anise in my local store and so substituted a couple of drops of licorice extract. The result was a great tasting ketchup with a full-bodied country ketchup flavour--better than the commercially bottled stuff. The second time I made it, I actually had the requires star anise and made the recipe extactly as indicated. The result was that the anise flavour was not subtle enough. If you like that flavour in ketchup, then it's a very tasty sauce. Personally, I prefer my first  version without the star anise, but with a few drops of the extract.

No, sir...I didn't like it.  Way too much fennel/anise flavor; aside from that, it was just kind of like tomato paste. I didn't have fennel pods, so I used a teaspoon of fennel seeds instead - maybe that was the problem. Still, the texture and the overall spirit of the thing just aren't what I wanted. Next time, I'll use a more traditional ketchup recipe.

It's not Heinz but if you want to try to make your own ketchup this is the recipe to try. It's very easy to make and it has a great taste. I just wish it was as smooth as the commercial ketchup (it has an applesauce texture to it). Maybe putting it through some cheese cloth might help.

I'm giving it 5 for flavor. I loved the spicy, garlic, licorice flavor. It's a great substitute for Heinz. My only question is if anyone's try had the consistency of cocktail sauce. I wasn't too sure on the reducing and the puree procedures. I would recommend adding a little more detail please. It's rather vague and kept me guessing. By sheer dint of will I refused to give up. Thanks. I've got a new and fun recipe for future dates.

My mom once made a wonderful homemade ketchup when I was a kid, so I guess I was trying to find a similar recipe.  Unfortunately, this wasn't it.  Although a tasty departure from bottled ketchup, the anise flavor is a bit strong for my family's taste.

Fresh ketchup is quite different from the store-bought stuff, but so nice! We used fresh tomatoes from the garden, so this was awesome! It doesn't make much for the effort, so I'll double or even triple the recipe next time... we used it to make the Blackberry BBQ Sauce... very nice! Thanks for sharing!

I made a few changes to this like most folks.  I used 6 quarts of tomatoes from my garden, and used what I had on hand in rough proportion to the greater amount of tomatoes.  Clove oil (6 drops-used in Christmas hard candy) and 1 1/2 caps anise extract for the fennel, star anise and cloves.  2 heaping Tbl minced garlic.  Balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Brown sugar for white.  It was way too sweet at first, but I left the sugar out of the 2nd batch and mixed them together.  Simmered for about 6 hours and it is STUPENDOUS!

This is awesome!! I make Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup. I use star anise for that dish as well. My wife doesn't care too much for ketchup. She loves this. I am going to try and tripple the batch so that I can do some canning. I had fresh basil leaves from my garden. That added a twist. Excellent recipe!!!

I really like this ketchup and so does my 2.5 year old. I use half the amount of tomatoes and replace with cauliflower. Turned out great, no one knew they were eating cauliflower until I told them.  Definitely a unique flavor, not like the bottled stuff you get at the store. We will use this as a go to ketchup recipe.

I don't like shop bought ketchup, so never have any in the house. However, my brother is due to visit at the weekend, and he loves the stuff. So I thought I'd make some to please him.
I went to work on the sauce, but had to alter some ingredients. I hadn't got any fennel, so used 4 sticks of celery. For the molasses, I used dark soft brown sugar, and for the cloves, I used half tsp ground cloves. It only needed to cook for about two and a half to three hours. It would have dried out completely if I'd left it any longer. It was overpowering with the smell of cloves while cooking, but luckily doesn't taste of them. It didn't make very much. I'm not sure how big each portion is meant to be, but I don't think the amount I have will make 16 portions. I've covered two large pizzas and only a medium size jar for my efforts, so it works out quite expensive. But all in all, I love it.

Like the other reviewers, I used fennel seed instead and omitted the anise. I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and turmeric.    It made 3 pints. The taste is great! I will make this again!

I jumped into the fray with this recipe and I absolutely love it...  I must say I used it as a guideline and took several liberties.   I read all the reviews and took a lot of substitution advice.  Fennel seed instead of fennel bulb.  I added ginger.  I used anise & clove extract since I had them on hand and wanted to save the money.  I crock potted the entire thing, then reduced it on the stove and then used the Magic Bullet to turn it into a paste.  I didn't strain the results as I kinda like the thicker consistency.    All in all the flavor is amazing!  It floors me how easy some  of my favorite items are to make at home, IF you have the time...and I seem to drag everything out.  But I enjoy the kitchen and the process.   Thank You for the recipe!

i tried this and loved it, rave reviews from family and friends too. i have a ninja blender and saw no need at all to strain the product. i would like to know if it can be water bath canned for long term keeping? or how long it will stay fresh in the fridge. highly recommended though. and i loved the fennel added to it!

Delicious! I didn't think the anise flavor was overwhelming at all, but then again I like licorice. I served this at a dinner party and got mixed opinions. I thought it was a touch too sweet but others disagreed. Some thought it could do without the star anise. I will probably omit it in the future just because I don't usually have it on hand.
