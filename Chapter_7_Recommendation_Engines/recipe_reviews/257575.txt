I loved the white sauce. Next time I will make this in a smaller pan to make it a little thicker but this recipe is a keeper.

I put a little cayenne nutmeg and parmesan into the béchamel, used orange bell pepper instead of green, and doubled the tomato sauce. Also, didn't measure cheese, just put a generous amount of swiss on each layer and about half as much mozzarella on top of swiss.
