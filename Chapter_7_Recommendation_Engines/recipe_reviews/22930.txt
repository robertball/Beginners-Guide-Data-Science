MMMmmmm....tastey, soft and sweet.  I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of rapid rise yeast.  With rapid rice you don't need to proof the yeast, makes it alot easier.  Just threw everything together all at once and mixed with the kitchenaid.  I had to put in about 5 1/2 c of flour and bake at 375 because I live in Colorado in high altitude.

I am not a bread maker. I am nervous about making anything with yeast, but I just had to try these. I'm so glad I did - they'll be on our Thanksgiving table for sure this year! So easy and tasty - they don't even need butter. By the way, I used two 1/4 oz packages of yeast and it worked out just fine. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I proofed the yeast in about 1/4 cup warm water plus 1 teaspoon sugar, then added a little extra flour and everything else according to the recipe to make a rich, heavy dough. It made a golden orange roll, slightly dense with a sweet and delicate flavor. I'm making these for Thanksgiving. They are delicious and well worth giving a try.

Very good.  I'm sure the recipe is quite good as written, but I did make some changes.  I used sweet potatoes in place of pumpkin (baked and mashed) and added a tsp of vanilla.  The dough is very soft but easy to work with.  I used the heavy-duty stand mixer and dough hook to knead, and it worked perfectly.  I think I would prefer a bit more yeast and will probably use the dry next time as I would like them to be a little fluffier and dry seems to me to make lighter bread.  But they were delicious and easy, and my family loved them.  It's a keeper recipe.  Thanks for the post.

I thought these were fabulous! I didn't know what "cake yeast" was (still don't), so I used regular.  These went fast!  Soft, moist, and perfect with some butter and a mild, white cheese!  Yum!

Excellent!  I warmed the milk and then added it all to the bread machine under the dough cycle.  I didnt have the cake yeast so I used 1 1/2 Tblspn as anotehr reviewer suggested.  Once the dough was complete I put a towel over it and let it rise.  Dived it and let it rise again, baked then enjoyed!  The whole family loved em!

Excellent rolls, perfect for Thanksgiving!  I used about 5 teaspoons of bulk yeast instead of the compressed cake...turned out fine.  I love how you can get a vegetable into bread and your kids will never know!  A keeper for sure.

These were a little more dense than I would like but I'm not sure I let them rise enough as I was crunched for time. I took GrannyLooWho's suggestion to proof the yeast first & I used a packet of active yeast instead of the cake. The flavor was awesome...especially when spread w/ Shed's Spread Country Crock Pumpkin Spice spread (don't normally use anything but real butter but the seasonal appeal of this spread enticed me). We enjoyed these rolls very much...thanks Karen Rummer!

Dough is very wet. I didn't think they were that good, but everyone else seemed happy.

These were absolutely wonderful! I ended up using rapid rise yeast instead of the compressed fresh, but that wasn't an issue. The rolls were soft and had a very good flavor. I plan on making these again (and again, and again...)

Made this for my test kitchen (co-workers). It turned out great. After reading other reviews, I changed the recipe just a little. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.The spice did not change the taste, but it made the rolls small good. Also used 1 pkg. dry active yeast instead of cake yeast (all I had on hand) 1 pkg dry yeast = 1 cake yeast. Raising times were longer,2 hrs. first rise, 1 1/2 hrs. Next time, I will use 2 pkg yeast, that will shorten rising times.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving dinner with the in-laws.  Though I couldn't really taste the pumpkin, these rolls had a very good flavor - slightly sweet and moist.  They were easy to make with my KitchenAid, a packet of yeast and my trusting candy thermometer. I referenced the info on the back of the yeast packet regarding how much to use in place of a yeast cake and what temperature to heat the milk/butter to proof the yeast.  I'll be making these again in the future.

I used all whole wheat bread flour because that was what I had, and even my whole wheat hating child gobbled them up. Served with honey butter and they were YUMMY!

These are so delicious!  I even substituted one cup and a half cups of whole wheat flour for some white flour.  And used creamo instead of milk.  Yummy!
