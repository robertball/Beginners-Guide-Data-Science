DELICIOUS & EASY! We loved it! It was a snap to make, smelled delicious while cooking, and tasted even better. I added chopped onion and garlic, and threw in some frozen GREEN BEANS to round out the meal (I served it over orzo with the extra sauce). Really good! Be sure to use a Bloody Mary mix that is to your liking (Mild, or spicy)- that may have been the problem that some other reviewers had - I can't imagine anyone not liking this! Thank you!  
UPDATE:  05/19/10  Still making this 8 YEARS later! I use Mr&Mrs T's bold & spicy 'mary mix w/ bone in/boneless chicken.  As with ANY recipe, SEASON TO TASTE!  It smells great & tastes great - serve over rice, pasta, quinoa; you can throw in frozen veggies (if using fresh veggies, throw in only for the last 2 hours.) A terrific recipe in my regular rotation. I've made this so many times now, & everyone has always loved it.

I also added a few of my own ingredients that added a wonderful flavor to the chicken!  I added celery, onion, garlic, and chicken broth and cooked it with chicken legs & thighs.  It was great!  I also cooked some white rice and used the broth from the crock pot instead of water.  It was great!  The chicken fell right off the bone and was absolutely delicious!

This has become one of my favorite meals!  I, however, add onions, green peppers and real bacon bits.  Right before it's done I throw in spagetti that has been cooked about 3/4 the way done and let that simmer to finish cooking spagetti.  I have also made this in less than an hour by half-way cooking the chicken.  EXCELLENT!!!

Absolutly fantastic.  I added 3 chopped celery sticks and a green ball pepper (dont eat after though, it gives chicken a great taste, but is very bitter after cooking so long).  I also added about 2 tablespoons of Tabasco sauce.  After chicken was cooked through, I SHREDDED it, then put it back into the sauce for 15 minutes to saturate.  Served over rice.  It was so good!!  I made a couple times according to the recipe, but the breasts came out so dry.  The bloody mary mix is a brilliant idea!

I only gave this 4 stars because I personally thought this was a very bland chicken, but with some tweaks a great recipe! I seasoned the chicken with crushed garlic, pepper and celery salt. Poured Mr & Mrs T's bloody Mary Mix over it, added cubed cream cheese evenly around the crock pot, with a dash of tabasco and worchestershire. Let it cook on low for about 6 hours. The chicken was falling apart and very flavorful! I removed the chicken, whisked the sauce just to blend the cream cheese and thickened it to use over the chicken and pasta I prepared to go with it!

I added a little sour cream for a creamier flavor and used the extra spicy mix.  It was so good we didn't have leftovers, and that NEVER happens.

This turned out disappointingly bland.  It may have been the bloody mary mix I used.  I would also add some onions and garlic to cook with the chicken next time.  Really important to have a tangy mix for this!

The bloody mary mix is great for starters but does need some chopped onions or something.  I added a can of chopped tomatoes w/italian spices and a small can of mushrooms about 1 hr before serving time.  I made white rice that I poured the sauce over.  I would recommend this recipe but advise to think about adding some veggies and your choice of a couple spices "kick this up a notch".

According to my family this was REALLY good so good in fact there was nothing left when I got off work =(( I threw this all in the crock pot last night and stuck it in the fridge so all DH had to do was plug it in (can't mess that up right) I used a bloody mary mix from this site, added some chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and a can of diced tomatos. Had DH shred the chicken, serve open face on a french bread loaf and he melted some provolone on it. Even managed to get him to take a picture of it =)) He said they would like to have it again so its a keeper.

This turned out so well! I seasoned the chicken breasts with some Italian seasoning before adding to the slow cooker, and added some minced garlic to the sauce. The chicken was so tender that it fell apart when I was checking it. I broke it apart while in the slow cooker and let it sit for a little while longer. Amazing! I did check the chicken at around 6 hours and it was already done. Served over brown rice. Very good. Will make again!

I thought the taste was excellent.  The acid went to town on the chicken and it totally fell apart.  I wasn't expecting that so that is why it got 4 stars, but I will definitely use this recipe if I want tomato based, bloody mary spiced shredded chicken as a base to a recipe.

This was a tasty starter recipe. I changed a few things myself.... started with 3 Large boneless Breasts and 30 ounces of Bloody mary Mix.... I didnt have the spicy one on hand so I added some Tabasco. let that cook on high for about 90 minutes. i then added 1 block of cream cheese & cooked on low for about 2 more hours. i then added a can of corn & 1 of green beans. i removed chicken so i could chop/shred it and return to the mixture... i then boiled up some pasta and added to the crock pot. changed settign to low for another 20 minutes then gobbled it up. 1 kid preferred it w/o the "juice" in the bowl, my other child and I loved the flavor of the broth. it was very delicious and i will be making this again.... .oh yea i also sprinkled i nsome garlic powder and season salt and celery salt... just for some added flavor...    thank you so much. love it.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy.  I decided at the last moment to double it to share with other family members and instead of extra water, I added a can of chicken broth.  It turned out great, made the house smell good and everyone loved it.

The first time I cooked this recipe I put it in the oven and the sauce was runny.  The next time I sauted the chicken breasts in butter is garlic salt, pepper, and tapito.  I poured the bloody mary mix over the chicken and added pepper and tapito.  It was wonderful.  The sauced thickened while it was simmering. My room mate loved it and has asked for it several times.  In fact, were having it tonight.  I love to take crock pot recipes and cook them regular.  They come out so good.

I stumbled on this recipe while looking for a quick chicken recipe. I just happened to have some Bloody Mary mix leftover from my New Year's Eve party, so I tried it. Wow, it was really good, and even more amazing, my very picky children all liked it! I think next time I will try it with some onions and green peppers. Served over rice, this was a great and incredibly easy meal. Thanks for this recipe!

The chicken fell apart it after 8 hours in the crock pot.  The house smelled pretty good and the chicken tasted alright too.  It was definately an easy recipe.

Had this for dinner tonight. The chicken was very moist and tasty. I thickened up the sauce on the stove top with a little cornstarch. I just had the chicken and sauce alone. Next time I think I'll try adding in some veggies during the last bit of time, shredding this and serving over a grain

I added a chopped onion, fresh chopped garlic, and a can of Italian stewed tomatoes. When it was done cooking I shredded the chicken and stirred in some sour cream. We ate the chicken over rice and it was pretty good. My kids and hubby liked itr and asked for it to go on the "make again" list.

The skin of the chicken had an ok flavor, the rest of the chicken was like the kind of chicken in chicken noodle soup.  Fell apart (in a bad way) and was just flavorless.

This was very good. I took advace of others and I added garlic and about a shot of vodka. I did not have a full bottle of bloody mary mix so I compensated with chicken bullion. I also added oregano, and italian seasoning and served with noodles it was soo good.

I really hate to say it, but we didn't like this one bit. I cooked it on low for 6 hours, and it was still dry...

Here's what happened. I made it just as it says here, but with some onions, celery and green pepper added in, and a little garlic. So, when 6 hours was up, I tasted the sauce. YUCK. So, I removed the chicken, and added some cornstarch mixed in cream and a little bit of cream cheese to try to a) thicken it up and b) give it some kind of flavor! Alas, my efforts were fruitless. It still didn't have much of a taste, and like I said the meat was stringy and dry. Oh well.

This is a great basic recipe. I enhanced it somewhat after reading the other reviews:
1 chopped onion
1 cup vegetable stock
1 cup chicken stock
2 boxes frozen green beans
4 thighs
4 wings
2 drumsticks
seasoned the night before with TexJoy steak seasoning.
1/2 32 oz. bottle of Zing-Zang Bloody Mary Mix
1/2 32 oz. bottle of Red Eye Horseradish Bloody Mary Mix
Served over rice with cornbread on the side.

It would be really good to use the bloody mary mix as a soup base but it doesn't penetrate the whole chicken in the crockpot.  We had to cut meat off the bone and ladle the mix over the chicken and then it was okay.

Agree with the other reviewers.  I added to the recipe three stalks of celery, 3 carrots (each sliced), a small onion and bell pepper (both diced) and two cloves garlic minced.

I also 'flaked' the chicken and returned to the pot and served over whole wheat capellini.  

We were pleasantly surprised by how well it tasted.

Next day, I had it for lunch and overnight the sauce thickened nicely and the flavor became more subtle.

I would definitely serve this again, but I would caution to serving to a party unless one knows that likes Bloody Mary's

I was really skeptical about this recipe after seeing the two ingredients, but it came out WONDERFUL!!  I did add a green pepper, half a onion and some mushrooms...and used spicy bloody mary mix.  This is a keeper!!

Yum!  I added carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion.  When it was all done and tender, my husband took the juices from the crock pot and made a thicker gravy with them in a skillet.  We scooped the chicken and veggies over some white rice, then poured the tangy gravy over the top.  SO simple - we made this on a day when our toddler was sick and we had no time to devote to cooking.

The chicken was somewhat dry but the flavor was good as long as you poured the juice on it during the meal.  I would just by spicy V8 juice and save the money instead of buying the bloody mary mix.

The chicken was tender but I didn't care for the flavor. Overall, if you like the flavor of V8 - make it.  Otherwise, avoid.

I've never had such tender chicken from a crock pot! I used chicken tenderloins, since that's all I had on hand. I added some celery, chicken broth, onion, and garlic to the recipe(make sure your chicken is covered by the mixture), and cooked it on low for about 5 hours. Right before I served it, I added a little green tabasco sauce because I thought the dish needed something else. 

With a little personalization, this recipe will be a winner!

This is a very easy dish. No prep time and the crockpot does all the work. I used frozen chicken breasts and they turned out very moist and good. The sauce however was just average. I served this over white rice. I will make again and use a different brand of Bloody Mary mix.

My husband liked this one.  He loves bloody mary's.  I added horseradish, olives and actually put vodka in as well.  It turned out really well.  I didn't care for the olives but the chicken was juicy and had a good flavor.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  I agree, use the extra spicy mix and I seasoned the chicken and added Tapatio.  Since there were comments about the chicken being bland, I slit the meat so the sauce could get inside (I know there's a technical term for that, but don't know it).  Also, I used thighs instead of breasts and so my meat was not dry.  Served it over rice and the family (picky kids included) ate it up!  Oh yeah, and I added 1 diced onion.

This is a great base recipe, I ended up adding a lot of spices of my own and some vegetables, and in the end it was really good.  I think it would make a great pasta primavera base.

This is quick and easy, but does not have a lot of flavor.  It might be better to add an extra hot Bloody Mary mix, or your own spices.

I used the Fat & Juicy Bloody Mary Mix from Aldi (it is actually our favorite).  I added onion and celery.  During the last hour I added a bag of frozen green beans.  Served te whole thing over cooked orzo for a complete meal.

Just didn't have the intensity of flavor I was hoping for. Followed recipe as directed. Next time will let chicken marinate overnight and perhaps add some balsamic vinegar to help break down the proteins as they cook. I love the concept too much not to try try again.

I made this when I discovered that no one had made any Bloody Mary's for my mother with the spicy mix I had bought her. The extra spiciness of the mix plus the addition of chopped bell peppers and an onion were the perfect combination!! We had it over rice that was cooked in chicken broth. DELICIOUS!

My hubby thought the taste was good, but we were hoping for a thicker sauce - I did add alot of extras - onion, bell pepper, garlic, can diced tomatoes.  Tried to thicken it up with cream cheese and even corn starch but it just wasn't what I hoping for.  I shredded it and served over pasta. It is very easy to make and smelled great, but I don't think I will try this one again - but that's just my personal taste. Sorry

This is a quick and easy and highly customizable recipe.  We use a Bold and Spicy bloody mary mix and add celery, onions, diced tomatoes,... the list goes on depending on our mood.  We have added potatoes, rosemary, and mushrooms also.  We LOVE playing with this recipe, and it is super fast and easy!!  However, I almost never use the whole bottle of Bloody Mary Mix or it does get a little watery.

LOVE IT! I actually cut the cooking time short by about an hour b/c we were hungry, the chicken was still great. We shredded it over white rice. Next time I may add some garlic, tomato paste to thicken, and who knows what else...

Boyfriend said "not a re-make". Chicken did fall apart so tender though. I used spicey bloody mary mix, added celery, pepper, and some redhot (just a bit) and poured over rice. Won't make again.

What an inventive idea! Boyfriend though it was good, but not great. I'm not sure I would say it's even good, but it's definitely not bad either. I'm giving it four stars because it did produce some of the moistest chicken I've ever made. I did add chopped celery and green peppers, a clove of garlic, and a can of mushrooms. Cooked it on low 4 hours and it was done perfectly. Added about 2 tablespoons cream cheese and a few shakes of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Served it over whole wheat egg white noodles. I could have used much less bloody mary mix, though, as I threw out at least a couple cups of extra sauce. Probably won't make this again, but it's a very creative idea!

I loved the easiness and flavor of this recipe... but there was no way it took that long to cook! When it came out of the crockpot the first time, it was waaaayyy overdone. Flavor is really nice, though.

I love this recipe because it's so easy. I found this chicken goes best with taco night. It works great to shred the chicken and put over a taco salad or in a taco. I served this to a table of men along side a big bowl of ground beef and the chicken was gone while the beef was left on the table!

I'm afraid I didn't have any luck with this one.  I used the spicy bloody mary mix, maybe that's where I went wrong.

Found the chicken rather bland. It did not retain any of the Bloody Mary flavor. I served it over rice so that if you ate it with a spoon you could get some flavor. The chicken was very moist. I would make again if you could tell me how to get the bloody mary flavor in a bite of chicken.

Great and so simple! Make sure not to overcook or to add a little extra Bloody Mary Mix because the sauce tends to overcook around the edges of the crock pot.

I added some onions and seasoned the chicken with Emeril's Essence and garlic before putting in the crockpot. It was wonderful. We had no leftovers and that never happens/ I served with rice. Definitely will make again!!

Maybe I should have used the extra spicy mix instead of regular Bloody Mary mix, but I found this average at best.  I was essentially tomato chicken.  Lacked zip.

added celery, onions, worst. sauce and still didn't find it super-flavorful.  Maybe if I'd used spicy bloody mary mix?  It was certainly tender and shredded easily....but not sure I'd make it again.

So Easy, So Good. I've made this several times and and found that the 'bold and spicy' bloody mary mix gave it a bit more kick. Good either way though.

This was ok but I added a lot near the end because I wasn't too impressed. I had to add a TON of extra hot sauce even with the spicy Bloody Mary mix. I added some horseradish too. The sauce seemed very thin so I combined with 8oz of cream cheese to thicken. Next time I would marinate in bloody mary mix, horseradish and hot sauce before cooking but I will try again.

We were not impressed.  I love Bloody Marys and was really looking forward to this one.  Even with the Tabasco Extra Spicy Mix, it still turned out bland and rather tasteless.  The "sauce" was too thin to put on top of rice or noodles.  All in all, just not very good.  Edible, so I'll give it a two.  But we won't be making this one again.

This is one of my new favorites.  I wasn't a fan of adding peppers and onions to the crock pot.  Instead, I shredded the chicken after cooking and ate it on tortillas.

I loved this recipe! The chicken was a little dry but was very tender.  I used V8 instead of Bloody Mary Mix and boneless/skinless frozen breasts b/c that's what I had. I added some minced garlic, pepper, and Tony's seasoning and the flavor was perfect.  It was excellent over brown rice.  Will make again but maybe will not defrost chicken prior to cooking to possibly prevent drying.

I have made this two weeks in a row and have frozen the breasts with vegetables and taken them as lunches. EVERYONE at my table at lunch mentions how good it smells. This is such a great recipe, and an extremely EASY recipe! You have to try this one!

Fine recipe but taste of bloody mary did not really add anything to chicken.  I marinated it for 24 hours and added onions and red bell peppers.  Will not spend the money to buy bloody mary mix again to make the recipe.
