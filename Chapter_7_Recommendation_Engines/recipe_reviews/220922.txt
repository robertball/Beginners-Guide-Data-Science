I went a little lighter on the dijon mustard and I threw in a little minced onion and a clove of fresh garlic. VERY good.

We liked this a lot.  I had a small ham steak leftover from another meal so I  whirled it in the food processor and added the other ingredients.  I used about 4 midget dill pickles diced.  This is great on rye bread!

I made these for a baby shower and they were a hit. I could not find minced ham so after I mixed all the ingredients together I ran them through my food processor. Doing that took care of the extra liquid.
