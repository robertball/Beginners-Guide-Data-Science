I did not like it.  I did not enjoy the blend of the flavors.  We mixed some of this up for a gathering and nobody cared for it.

we know this as beer punch.  We cut down the booze to 6 oz for a batch and it's also good with limade concentrate.  After the 1st pitcher or two, we cut WAY back on the vodka, to avoid a too wild party, because these sneak up on you, BIG TIME!!!  They are also good with rum or a light tequila.  Make sure you have a designated driver!!!

Our neighborhood knows this drink as "Hop, Skip and Go Naked!"  One night of these drinks at Bunco and the husbands all renamed our fizzy margaritas.  They now insist we serve them at Bunco because we all come home really happy!   I only use 6 oz. of vodka instead of 8.  Pour over ice and serve with lime wedges.  Super drink for summer, but be careful!  They will sneak up on you!

I love these but change slightly.  One can 12 oz frozen pink lemonade (pulp kind the best), fill that can with vodka, then add just two beers. Mix, then fill pitcer with ice and serve.  Very good not as strong as with three beers as stated in original recipe.

Well -- we meant to make this recipe -- but accidently dumped a can of frozen orange juice instead of the lemonade. We were committed because the beer was already in the pitcher, so we added the vodka and hoped for the best. How bad could it be? Not bad at all -- actually really good! A happy mistake. We will make the regular recipe with the lemonade next -- which we've made before with tequila instead of vodka. We also did a little drizzle of grenadine to see what happened - and it made it look even prettier -- just a bit sweeter, but I like it without the grenadine just as much. Fun recipe.
