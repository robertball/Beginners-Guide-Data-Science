Everyone loved this!  I added some raisins to the apple mixture and it turned out great.  I also made a maple glaze to serve it with and it was such a hit that I thought I'd share it:
Maple Glaze:
Roughly equal parts of the following: softened cream cheese, powdered sugar and maple syrup.  Then add a spoonful of sour cream or plain yogurt and a pinch of salt and whisk together. 
Thank you for this recipe!  We will definitely make this again.

Didn't peel the apples because they're better for you that way, plus I didn't have time. Increased servings to 12 to use 16oz bread, or about 8 slices. Great with organic oat nut bread! Also used cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to make it more like apple pie, and cut down the butter because you really don't need that much. Will probably cut the sugar just a bit next time, or use molasses instead. Awesome recipe! :-)

Great!  I've made this numerous times, different ways based on things I had in the fridge.  No apples?  I used apple sauce.  No cream?  A full cup of milk is fine.  I added nuts and syrup to the mixture as well.  Easy to make and adjust.  I weekend morning treat!

I made a triple recipe of this to serve for a large group, and it was a big hit! Not overly sweet, but lots of great flavor. I only made very minor changes, using gluten-free challa instead of the French bread, and Fuji apples instead of Granny Smith (that's what I had on hand) which I chopped in the food processor with the skins on instead of peeling and dicing. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour before baking, so that all the liquids could soak into the bread really well. The texture and flavor were fantastic, and I'll be making this again.

OMGosh, this was amazing!!!!
I prepared the night before and used buttermilk instead of plain milk. I also added everything in the night before. Before putting in the the refrigerator I added an additional cup of buttermilk by pouring over the top. I baked 45 minutes covered and then 15 minutes uncovered. When I pulled from the oven I topped with fresh strawberries and blueberries, served warm with 10X sugar and warm maple syrup. It was eaten before I had a chance try it myself.

Easy, delicious and not too sweet. I used Multigrain bread that I had on hand and a mix of apples. I definitely will do again and use some nuts and homemade bread. I made extra and poured on some homemade caramel syrup.

Delicious variation on French toast, and certainly easy enough. Definitely use Granny Smith or another firm baking apple that will stand up to skillet and then oven, and don't chop the apple too small or it will get lost. I used half of a 16-oz Italian bread loaf (bakery style, not sliced sandwich loaf). Also I used less cream and increased milk with good results. This made a slightly thin layer in a 9x13 pan so I would not recommend anything larger.  For even more deliciousness, next time I will add add walnuts or pecans. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, yummy ...  I used challah instead of french bread but either one would work.

I will absolutely make this again!!  It's SO delicious!

A couple of changes/additions we made:
We added more vanilla than it called for and we also sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.

May make it again. Kids liked it but did not rave.  The bread part was just the way they like it - crispy but not soggy. I did use extra bread - one entire baguette. If I make this again I will increase the eggs by two and liquid by at least 1/2 cup. I will also cook the apples until fully softened. When the casserole came out of the oven they were cooked but still firm - I wanted them softer like apple pie.

So good!!  Leave the apples in big chunks rather than chopped small, and we added 8ounces of cream cheese cubed.  Topped it with whipped cream and drizzled with syrup.  Perfect food coma deliciousness

Made it for Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit. Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top to dress it up before baking... So delicious

I didn't have half & half,  so I used flavored coffee creamer instead & it worked great! I used thawed frozen apples that I had put away in the fall. This is definitely a keeper!

You know what is great about this recipe - I used leftovers! I had made an apple crisp... "healthy" needless to say there were leftovers because it was "healthy" AKA BORING. LOL
I used stale wheat bread, cubed and followed the recipe for the egg mixture with just a tablespoon or 2 of the sugar since it was in the apple crisp already, then reheated my apple crisp which had walnuts, dried cranberries and cinnamon in it - tossed it all together making sure I had added the melted BUTTER this time :) FANTASTIC! So glad I was able to use up a lame apple crisp and stale bread into this - and no leftovers!

Doubled the recipe and cooked apples in the skillet just a few minutes longer based on other reviews. It was delicious!

Made this after the holidays when the apples and the french bread were just sitting there staring at me...All I can say was that it was incredibly easy. I followed the recipe and used the one reviewer's suggestion of topping it off with a maple glaze. We have eaten it for breakfast, snack and dessert. Excellent!

Easy & yummy!  I had some stale organic wheat bread that I needed to use up so decided to try this.  Used almond milk in place of the half & half AND milk, wheat bread and gala apples, because that is what I had on hand.  Delicious!
