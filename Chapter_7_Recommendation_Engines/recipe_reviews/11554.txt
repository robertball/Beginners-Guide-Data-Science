I made the cookie portion of this recipe after reading the reviews, and they were wonderful (almost like the tops of chocolate cupcakes)!!  I simply melted some white almond bark I had on hand and put it in the middle of the two cookies.  My family loved these!!

The cookies are super soft and moist, very cake like and delicious. The frosting, however, has a strange texture (I think because you use shortening instead of butter or margarine). It was also too soupy.

A tasty treat for sure.  Due to lactose intolerance I changed the milk to Unsweetened Almond Milk, used unsalted butter and sweetened cocoa powder.  It turned out perfectly!!  Using a cookie sheet, parchment paper and a piping bag, I was able to make nearly perfect(ish) circles.  I'm really happy with the turn out.
