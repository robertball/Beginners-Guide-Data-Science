Superb. Decadent. Delicioso. This bundt was a hit at our recent dinner party. It wasn't the prettiest (the poked holes were visible through the thin glaze), but it was one of the tastiest cake recipes I've come across. Very moist, with a wonderful dark chocolate flavor, laced with coffee liqueur. I used Valrhona cocoa powder, 2T less butter than the recipe called for, and a bit less sugar in the cake (up to 1/2 cup less). I also found that 1/2 c of Kahlua was a bit too much for the 1 c powdered sugar for the glaze, and made it too watery - start with the sugar and add the liqueur to desired consistency. Enjoy!

Awesome recipe - everybody loved it at a dinner party I served it at.  Next time I would make the coffee a bit stronger (like expresso) to give the cake a richer Mocha flavor.

We enjoyed this cake, rich and delicious.  I used Bailey's Irish Cream because Kaluha wasn't available.  I also served it with some whipped cream that had a dash of Baileys in it. I like to soak the cake with the syrup - easy way to do this is put the cake back in the bundt pan when cool and poke with a knife while you pour the topping directly into the cake.  I make as many holes as possible till the syrup is all gone and absorbed, then put the cake (with pan) in a plastic bag and tie shut for the night.  Flip the cake onto a serving dish and sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.  It will be moist and have a wonderful liquor flavor.   I'll be making this again at my next party.

When applying the glaze, have your cooling rack over a piece of waxed paper, the glaze will run off the cake and on to the waxed paper.  You can then scrape the glaze off the waxed paper and pour it over the cake again for better coverage.

I made this cake for an office birthday.  It was a huge hit.  I omitted the 1/2 cup of coffee and used a full cup of coffee flavored liquor (Kahlua) instead.  I made chocolate glaze from this site to pour on top...everyone enjoyed it very much!

Sooooo yummy and moist and dense and so mocha.  All of my favourite things.  I accidentally added all of the liquer mixture to the cake, then made more to pour on top and the cake was absolutely fantastic.  Make this cake it is so yummy.  It is a real grown-ups cake.

This is an excellent cake recipe, and was well received. Chocolate flavor and density were just right. I used 1/2 of expresso rather than normal coffee. I would also consider using 1 cup of Bailey's in the cake, and 1 cup of Bailey's in the glaze - 1/2 a cup didn't reach more than the edges. And dusting in powdered sugar is a nice touch since the glaze doesn't actually give too much decoration.

This turned out delicious. A few adjustments I made based off others' feedback:

1) Upped the coffee; threw in about 3 or 4 extra packets of dissolved instant coffee into my mixture. For the glaze I used 1/4 cup strong coffee, 1/4 cup Kahlua.

2) Poke the holes in the underside, not top, of the cake; looks nicer. After the cake cooled, I put it back in the mold. I used a chopstick to poke holes in the underside, then spooned the glaze into there.

3) Let the cake sit in the fridge for a day or two. I wrapped up the cake, in the pan, in saran wrap and stuck it in the fridge for 2 more days. The coffee and alcohol flavors got much stronger. I thought the flavors were too subtle when I tried the cake right after we were done.

This cake was fabulous!  I made it for my boyfriend's golden birthday and the entire cake was gone within 15 minutes.  My only real regret is that I should have made 2(:  Even his uncle who was on a strict diet couldn't resist 2 pieces!
I used 1.5 cups sugar and the non-alcoholic version.  Any more sugar would have been unnecessary really.  Also, next time I plan on using part espresso rather than just the strong coffee, because there wasn't much of an aroma or coffee essence to the cake.  It was still wonderful, but I would love a stronger coffee presence.  I didn't put all the glaze on the top, because it seemed to be drowning the cake. It was still a billion degrees from the oven, and I had to get to the party, so it just totally sucked up all the glaze.  I would actually put it all on next time, because that honestly made the cake.  You will be very proud to serve this cake no matter if you make it as directed or alter it to your taste.

OMG Great cake.  I made 6 mini bundt with this recipe..so moist.  Changes I made were..I only used 3 tablespoons of liquoer in glaze and topped it to 1/2 cup with chocolate milk because I was afraid it would taste too boozy.  So glad it did.  Used kaluha in the cake and Cafe Noir for the glaze.  Definatley a do over dessert

The cake tastes great, but the coffee flavor was definitely lacking. It just tasted like chocolate cake with Kahlua. Not that there's anything wrong with that! :)

Don't skip out on the liquor! I used Kahlua and it came out fabulously! I poured some Kahlua mocha glaze over the cake (Kahlua, some espresso, cocoa powder, and powdered sugar). Will make again.

Very moist, very rich cake. It does have a really strong alcohol taste when using the glaze made with the coffee liqueur. Will use a chocolate glaze next time I make it to balance out the flavor. My hubby absolutely thought this was a fantastic cake, and he is very hard to please.

I didnt really taste the coffee or Kahlua that I used but it was still a tasty chocolate cake - if anything, I think it added a richness to the flavor of the cake. I made cupcakes instead of the bundt cake and topped it with Mocha Frosting. It was so good!

Great recipe, very easy to follow. I made couple adjustments as well:
1. Cut down 2 cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cup. Use the 1/2 cup of sugar to beat the egg white instead.
2. Replace the liqueur with 3/4 cup of espresso (I have a espresso maker so I didn't use espresso powder) and 1/4 of water

The cake came out moist and full of flavour!

Very nice cake.  I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar and found it to be sweet enough.  I also used whole wheat flour with no problems.  I omitted the glaze.  Cake is amazing on its own or with a bit of vanilla ice cream.

Made this GLUTEN FREE.  It is so good!  Our family is gluten free, so I used a gluten-free flour mix (one that's sold as a bread baking mix--it does not have yeast in it) in place of the flour.   I used the chocolate syrup instead of the liqueur, and added an extra spoon of instant coffee to the coffee/water/choc syrup mixture to make it extra-mocha-y.  It is FANTASTIC.

I haven't yet made this cake, but I definitely will!  For the person(s) concerned about the holes poked in the cake, it may look a little nicer if you use one of those long, thin, wooden skewers used for making kabobs.  That might make it look neater.  Anyway, once the cake is cut, no one is going to be looking at the top of the cake when a slice is layed on a plate!

Fantastic!  This was so moist and delicious.  The coffee flavor was surprisingly subtle and there was no alcohol flavor at all.  I let mine sit over night before serving, and it was fabulous.

I added the entire coffee/liquor mixture to the batter on accident, but turned out just fine (with same baking time of 60 minutes). Also used special dark cocoa. Cake turned out very black in color, but flavor was great. Everyone loved it (served a la mode). The cake had a slightly rubbery texture as one other reviewer said, but when I had a left over piece the next day, the texture was perfect. I may have covered it too soon after removing it from oven.

This cake is fabulous!  I took it to a family potluck yesterday, and everyone raved about it.  

I've made this once before with regular cocoa and I didn't like it as well.  Plus, the flour stuck in clumps to the top of the cake from the grease/flour routine.

This time, I made sure I bought some of the oil/flour baking spray, which worked really well.  I also used the Hershey's Special Dark baking cocoa and the cake came out black, black chocolate.  This type of cocoa gave the intense, rich taste I was looking for!  

My grandma was surprised you could actually taste the Kahlua (I used cheapo generic), unlike a lot of other cakes with liquor.

This is an incredible cake.  It is always moist and never lasts very long.  I tend to skip the glaze as the cake just does not need the extra moisture.

The recipe produced more batter than necessary and the cake baked over the top of the pan.  I was concerned at how soupy the batter was.  Next time, I will pour less batter into the cake pan.  Also, I wasn't sure if the coffee should be hot when it is added or cooled first.  Nevertheless, the cake turned out delicious!  I would make it again.

Wow...I can't stop eating it! And I didn't even bother making the glaze. I kept everything else pretty much the same except sugar, I lower it to a little less than one (brown sugar) and a half (white sugar) cup instead of 2 cups. I use espresso and Godiva Praline liquor because I ran out of Bailey. I divided in 2 loaf pans and baked about 45 minutes. Beautyful dark chocolate color and so moist! Thank you so much for the recipe. - 28 Aug 2006/ Just made it again with shiny chocolate glaze. Still scrumptious and there is nothing left after a dinner party. - 30 Mar 2012

After reading the reviews I had high expectations from this recipe, but I was disappointed.  The cake had a weird texture to it, almost rubbery.  (A disclaimer -- since I just wanted to try this I only made half a recipe in a 6-cup bundt, but based on that trial I don't think I'll use this recipe again.)  For me there was also something off in the balance between the coffee, liquer and cocoa, though my colleagues liked it well enough.  We had it a la mode and the vanilla ice cream saved the day.

very yummy! ^^  i love the softness of the cake.  For those who doesnt like sweetness much, you should put half the sugar amount.  Also, the taste of choco-coffee was a little strong.  But it's a great receipe! thanks!

Delicious cake - really moist and flavorful.  However I only gave it 4 stars because I did not appreciate the glaze.  Liqueur flavor was overwhelming.

Delicious!  It's my new favorite loaf cake now.  I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used two loaf pans.  Had to decrease the glaze by 1/2.  Also, instead of the 1/2 c. brewed coffee, I substituted 1/2 c. water plus two full tbsp. cappuccino powder.  The cake is especially good the second day.

I have made this twice before, and I have two cakes in the oven now. The first time I made it for the recipient of my "dessert of the month" charity auction donation. They LOVED it. So I made it again to take to a friends house for a get together. Everybody seemed to like it. I have put it on the dessert rotation, and got ready to make it tonight. Well, I made a mistake and added more than twice the flour. So I mixed up another recipe and combined it into two. It's not done yet, so I don't know if I saved it or not. But it's a good recipe just as written.

I didn't have any Kahlua or other coffee liquor but I did have some dark rum...yummy! It tasted like a rumball cake.

For the glaze, I mixed the 1/2 cup rum with the icing sugar and threw in a pack of Starbucks Via Italian roast for added mocha flavour.

I poked holes in the cake while still warm and drizzled the glaze into the holes before inverting it onto a plate. I didn't really want a frosting type appearance so this worked perfectly!!! 

I will definitely remake this even though it broke while inverting.  I'll just be more careful when preparing my pan next time. 

A keeper for sure, suitable for entertaining and a fancy dinner party.

Awesome cake. I used irish cream in place of kaluha and used extremely strong coffee. I also used irish cream in the glaze and poured it over the warm cake. I also made an icing using sweetened condensed milk and semi sweet chocolate chips and poured it over the cake once the glaze was set and the cake was still slightly warm.....absolutely fabulous.

Loved this recipe.. My glaze was thin, but enough to give the cake a "glistening" glaze.. I topped the cake with chocolate chips and it was a hit.... Another cake arsenal in my collection! Lol

Mine fell and stuck to the pan. :( But I'm guessing that's my fault. The liqueur glaze was too strong for me. I didn't even use it all.

GLAZE RECIPE SUSPECT
I was extremely disappointed in the "glaze."  Recipe easy to make the glaze,
but no way does it appear the same as the pic.  Extremely runny. I  chose another contributor's suggestion to use a chocolate glaze form
this site.

Delicious!!! I cut the sugar down to about 1½ cup which was plenty. Definately not too strong of a liquer flavour, my friends went crazy for this cake and asked to take some home. A perfect cake to go with a cup of coffee in the afternoon. Thanks!!

Delicious! Although the cake stuck to the pan a bit and it looked like it had mange, it was delicious and moist. Next time I will grease and flour it more. And I cut back on the coffee liquor slightly, no point in doing too much underage drinking. My parents loved it and so did I.

I followed the cake directions exactly and was rewarded with rich, chocolatey goodness.  As printed, the glaze recipe was way too sweet for me, so I just put some cocoa in to offset the sweetness.

Moist, very sweet, and very strong flavor (both coffee and alcohol).  One of my guests suggested that it would be better served in a glass!  Personally, I like Amaretto Cake better because the flavor is less overwhelming.

Made this at Xmas time for the teachers at my daughter's school.  They've been asking for another one ever since!

Finally a chocolate cake that doesn't taste of baking soda and is nice and fluffy like a chiffon cake!
Bf said the coffee flavour is too strong but as this is a personal thing, I'm still giving this a 5-star!

The only difference is that I used an angelfood cake tin as don't have a bundt.

This cake should really change its name, it is more of a chiffon cake than a bundt.

Thank you so much for posting this. I made mini bundt cakes with this recipe and added chocolate chips and they were a hit. I am thinking of making my own coffee liquor and using it next time I make this.
