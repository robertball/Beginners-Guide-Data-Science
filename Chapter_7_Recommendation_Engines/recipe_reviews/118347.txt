I made a few changes to this: I used a 5 lb pork loin, I did not brown it! added whole, frozen cranberries on the bottom of the pot, jellied (not whole) cranberry sauce, OJ instead of cranberry juice, 1/2 tsp of ground cloves, added 1 tsp of nutmeg and omitted the oil. Cooked on low for 5 hrs and high for the last 1- 1&1/2 hrs. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the best pork recipe I've ever made! 
I did alter it a tad. Before browning the roast in oil, I rubbed it with cajun seasoning. I also used light cranberry juice and 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 to save a few calories, and it was still extremely flavorful! The meat was so tender that we didn't even need a knife, it just fell apart.
Also, I did thicken the gravy with the cornstarch and water like the recipe said to do, but in my opinion the sauce tasted better before doing thickening it with the cornstarch. It was still pretty thick beforehand anyway. Next time I will skip that step!

This is a good basic recipe that produces a mild-flavored, tender roast with plenty of sweet sauce.  Originally the recipe appealed to me because it doesn't call for browing the roast.  I don't like to go through the whole day smelling like I... well, fried a pork roast first thing in the morning.  I found the recipe works best if I brown the roast first in hot oil.  Happily, I like the flavors enough to keep using the recipe anyway.

Here are the changes I've made to the recipe over the years.  First I salt and pepper the roast and brown it in 2 Tbsp. hot oil.  (This alleviates the mushy/flabby factor mentioned by another reviewer.)  When putting the roast into the slow cooker, I add a few lemon slices and 1/2 a chopped onion, and I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Then before serving, I squeeze half a lemon into the sauce to brighten it up.  The lemon slices and juice at the end bring out the tart flavor of the cranberries, and cuts a little through the sweet cornstarch-y sauce.

Overall a good recipe, and I make it at least once every year.

This is still the best recipe for Pork loin! You can substitute white grape juice or apple juice or even water and it still comes out DELICIOUS! I bet even orange juice would be tasty! I even substituted Old Bay seasoning when I didn't have ground mustard and it was fabulous too! This recipe just can't fail!

Fabulous!  This makes up for all the crummy recipes I've tried in the past.  I prepared this exactly as the recipe states, and it is excellent.  Will definitely make again - and for company.

I liked this very much.  I didn't have any whole cranberry sauce, so I used the jellied kind and added some whole frozen cranberries to it.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added some minced garlic. (we love garlic)  I didn't thicken the sauce with the cornstarch slurry, I just poured it into a sauce pan and let it reduce until it got nice and syrupy.  We enjoyed this with some bown rice and brussel sprouts.  Thanks for the recipe, Joyce!

This was very good but a little too sweet for my taste. I think if I made it again I would omit the sugar. I also used OJ instead of cran juice and didnt make the gravy for it. My family loved it though.

Only gave 4 stars as I have a version of this recipe from a magazine, uses jellied cranberry sauce and only 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c  juice, and only 2 tbls cornsratch & water.   I added thinly sliced carrots for a veggie.  I didn't use any salt.   VERRRRY TASTY-sauce great over mashed potatoes.  Think the recipe with less sugar is very good and no need to add extra.

Cool recipe! I'll admit I didn't follow it exactly because I find canned cranberry sauce too sweet. I used a bag of frozen cranberries and no sugar added cranberry juice instead. I didn't have cloves so I used allspice and some garlic powder. The result was a very tender pork roast that came apart like pulled pork. That's what I wanted in terms of texture. In terms of the flavor, mine came out a little bland but most likely because I didn't use as much sugar as the original recipe. If I were to make this again I'd like to pump up the flavor by using red wine, some herbs like rosemary or thyme and maybe brown sugar. Overall it's a very easy and great recipe that can be altered in many wonderful ways. Try it!

Went exactly by the original recipe and it was very bland... I would have given it 1 star, but on my own fault I overcooked it a little. I will try it again though as this was my first attempt and see if some of the alternate versions suggested help.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe with two exceptions - I rubbed the meat with garlic and onion powder before searing, and I didnt have cranberry juice so used oj.  Next time I'll make sure I have the cran juice just to see if it makes a difference for us.  Served over brown rice with corn and lima beans - I ended up mixing everything together on my plate and boy was it yummy!  My roast fell apart so the presentation wasn't the greatest - might try watching the internal temp closer next time and turning off the crock as soon as it hits 160.   Also planningto add more whole fresh or dried berries next time.  Thanks!!

I made this following the recipe exactly.  If I make it again I will probably try the suggestion of another reviewer and season the meat with some garlic and sage because the meat was very bland.  I will also try making this in the oven instead of a slow cooker.  The slow cooker caused the meat to turn out very mushy and water-logged. Overall I just wasn't happy with this.  I'm not sure I'll try it again.

It was dry and had a weird flavor in the sauce. Granted, I didn't have cloves or mustard, added garlic powder and onions to the roast and used two 1.5 lbs roasts and cut them in half...it was still just OK.

My husband and I both enjoyed this pork recipe.  I think I may have accidentally overcooked it a little because it had a bit of a smokey flavor, but overall I enjoyed the cranberry sauce and I was very happy with how tender the pork was.  The best part was that it was very easy to make. All I had to do when I got home from work was heat up some veggies for a side dish and we had a complete meal.

I was missing ingredients for my "go-to" slow cooker pork recipes so I did a search and came up with this.   I was shocked to see how much sugar was in the recipe so I did cut it back to 1/4 c & used brown sugar. It made a ton of sauce.  I followed the sauce recipe and had the cornstarch/water mixture completely smooth, then it seized as I turned to dump in the pan juices.  I ended up with a ton of lumps that had to be strained out.  It was OK but I will not make it again and won't save it to my recipe box.  I sliced up the remaining pork and dumped it into all of the sauce so maybe the leftovers will taste better.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Have shared it with so many people who also love it.  I skip the browning part if I'm in a hurry.  I keep cranberry juice in the freezer just for this recipe.

My family has been making this for many years; it is my daughter's favorite dinner.  We usually serve it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  I have tried other cranberry and pork recipes and been disappointed - this is the best!

The meat came out very tender (of course after all that time in slow cooker), but not much flavor.  All the flavor was in the sauce and the meat was just bland.  If I made this again, I would season the meat with garlic, sage and seasoning salt before cooking.  Also I thought the sauce was too tangy, so I added a little brown sugar near the very end which helped it out a lot.

OMG this was so good.  I slow cook pork frequently, but I believe this was the best tasting, most tender of them all.  I cut down on the sugar a tad and seasoned the roast prior to browning.  Everything else was as directed.  I will definately make this again and again.  Joyce what a winner!
