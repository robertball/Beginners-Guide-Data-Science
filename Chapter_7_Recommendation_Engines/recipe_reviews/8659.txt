Delicious.  I omitted the cashews.  After about an hour the fruit juices started soak into the tortilla making it a little soggy.  They were still great but I would like to alleviate this problem.

I used pre-packaged grilled chicken and left out the cashews because I don't like nuts.  They still turned out delicious!  I took these wraps for lunch for a week and never got tired of them... they are satisfying and full of flavor!  Great quick and easy lunch or light dinner.

I added lettuce and halved the amount of chicken per wrap, and it still tasted yummy and filling. A great alternative to boring sandwich lunches.

My family really enjoyed this.  I used smaller tortillas because I have four children under eight and the 10" tortillas are too big for them to manage.  I also wrapped them in plastic to keep the filling in place.  When I cooked the chicken, I sprinkled seasoned salt on it first, but that was my only taste-able change.  Those were my only changes.  The fruit gives a nice sweet tang to the salty cheese and the cashews add a nice crunch to the chewy chicken texture.  We'll have these again!

This is really, really good - I only used about 5 oz. of cream cheese and 3 chicken breasts, which was plenty.  We make these on Sunday afternoon and keep them in the fridge for lunches or quick dinners throughout the week.  Thank you!!!

I tried these today in honor of the Chinese New Year and they were incredible! Quite honestly, I'm not a big Neufchatel fan, but the combination was so good! These were easy as well... great for kids - just hide the name of the cheese! They'll be sure to love the chicken wrap part along with the sweet tastes of the fruit! Yum! Happy Chinese New Year!

If you have vegetarian friends you could simply omit the chicken and add extra red peppers, nuts, and fruit. Put a toothpick in the vegetarian wraps to mark them.

I loved this recipe!  I cooked the chicken and peppers together and served it warm instead of putting it in the fridge.  I also thought it needed a little something to make it moister and to hold it together so I mixed it all with a few blops of mayo and a spoonful of roasted red pepper spread.  That was really good!

I thought this was unique and creative. My husband liked this, even though the idea of a sandwich for dinner is abhorrent to him (his mother always cooked huge, multi-course meals three times a day)

I used cream cheese and only half that amount of chicken, which I grilled. What a great combo for a very hot night! Teenage boy claims this is "Mad good"!

These were so disappointing! Very bland. They could definitly benenfit from some fresh herbs, perhaps savory? I don't know. I think this could be really good with some extras added. As is I really did not enjoy these. Sorry...

I absolutely loved these. The crunch from the cashews was fantastic, and the creaminess from the cream cheese and sweet-tart taste from the pineapple and orange went so well together. I made sure to drain the oranges and pineapple REALLY well before putting them in the roll, because I hate a soggy sandwich. 

My husband didn't like these, but I didn't know he didn't like cream cheese on things!

Anything my kids will eat is great in my book! And my husband and I loved it too.  I used green peppers instead of red, and sauted them with the chicken. I didn't let it chill, just dug right in, and it was very tasty!

This is extremely yummy! I got the o'k from picky boyfriend and from my 5-year-old to make these again when we are picnicking :) I played with the amounts, using only 3 chicken breasts to make 5 wraps; also I only had fat-free cream cheese. But there is so much flavor to this wrap; every bite is something different and good! Thanks for a great recipe.

I tried them with spinach & herb tortillas and they were just ok.  Next time, I'll try them with regular tortillas, I think that upgrade them to good.

This is fantastic! Left out the pineapple :( because hubby doesn't like it but it was still scrumptious.  I used whole wheat tortillas, low fat cream cheese (not fat free), chopped extra bell pepper and onion (I love them) and didn't use as many cashews.  Worked out great and we having them again tonight! LOL!

I used tuna instead of chicken. I added all the ingred to TUNA and added a dollop of mayo, spread the mixture over the cream cheese tortilla. Refrig over night and cut into 2" slices for a tasty guilt free lunch!

I made these for a work function and they were gone in a flash. As my co-workers agreed it was the best food of the party hands down. I haven't met one person who didn't like it yet.

This was great!! I made it on half of a pita rolled up, it was a little messy but worth it. I didn't have the pepper or the onion but I don't think I was missing anything. Nice figure friendly lunch idea.
