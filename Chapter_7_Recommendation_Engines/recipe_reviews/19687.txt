Gets folks laughing! Worth the effort.
Tips (from me & others): use herbed or ranch flavored whipped cream cheese (it will still look white); don't simply slice the olive, remove a small section to accomodate the filling; pipe whipped cream cheese using a sandwich bag; make "beaks" thin to avoid splitting the "head" while inserting them; try inserting "beaks" vertically rather than horizontally; "heads" take the most time - make them the night before and leave them soaking in the olive brine. Don't forget to make baby penguins! Fill a single olive & set on top of carrot feet with large whole facing up. Insert toothpick through center to pin it to the "feet". Set "beak" into cream cheese filling of large whole - it will hold it in place. Do a variation on this to make "swimming" penguins. Fill a single olive. Stick beak in one end and feet in the other. Shave off a small portion from the underside of the olive to keep it from rolling around. For "environment" we used an aluminum pizza pan and foam board ($1.99)for an ice flow. Trace the pan on the foam board. Cut out the circle with a craft knife. Cut circle in half jaggedly to simulate ice flow. Cut remaining half into pieces; glue and stack in layers to create "hills". Cover pizza pan with blue plastic wrap. Place "ice flow" into the pizza pan. Tape plastic wrap to bottom of the pan to hold it in place. When placing penguins, push the toothpick into the foamboard to hold them in place. Transports easily this way.

These were really a hit with the kids at our Christmas family gathering.  Instead of using frilly toothpicks, I went to a party store and purchased the toothpicks with the flags from diferent countries.  I also made a cheese ball in the shape of an igloo and placed my little guys all around it.  Very cute!

These are too adorable!!  I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese for a little flavor.  Also, I heated the cream cheese briefly (about 20 seconds) in the microwave and then put it in a ziploc bag.  By cutting off a small corner of the bag, you can easily squeeze the cream cheese into the olive using the ziploc like a pastry bag!

This was a great recipe!  It was a hit at a family picnic I made it for.  I was able to get 25 penguins out of a can of jumbo olives.  For the beaks, I had to cut a horizontal slit into the smaller olives, and I sliced the beaks thinner so they would fit better.  I made these the night before and was worried they would get dried out, so I stood them up in a tupperware container and placed a small amount of water in the bottom and sealed the top.  They were fine the next day.  They took about an hour to make.  I needed to transport them safely on a two-hour car ride so I used the top and bottom of an egg carton and leaned the penguins on their backs in each section of the egg carton, which worked great and prevented them from shifting and getting stuck together.  I used an herbed cream cheese spread which worked well.  A couple people thought they were chocolate covered treats so you may want to tell people they're olives!  I'll definitely make these again!

This is my favorite recipe for the winter holiday season and I make it for each and every party I attend.  It definitely takes a little practice to get the penguins assembled correctly, but after about 5, it's a snap.  My boyfriend helps me make them and we get an assembly line going.  One thing I do to add some flair is to use a basic frosting pump (same thing you would use to fill deviled eggs) to squirt the cream cheese into the olives.  This creates a "ruffled tuxedo" effect down the penguin's front.  These are always a hit and each penguin will have its own personality!  People can never get enough of these.
You can also make an "igloo" to sit next to the penguins out of cream cheese.  Use a toothpick to draw the ice bricks.

Stuffed olives with cream cheese has always been a favorite of mine but I would never have thought to shape them like a penguin.  CUTE!  I like to use the "onion & chives" flavored cream cheese.  It gives an added flavor.  To easily get the cream cheese into the olives, I use a pastry bag with a #12 tip.  I'll now need to buy a smaller tip to fill the smaller olives.  Great recipe!

I made these darlings for my sister's wedding shower, and they were a smash hit! We arranged them in rows and they looked like an adorable little army!  One suggestion would be to add dry ranch mix to the cream cheese to add a little flavor.  Great party appetizer!

One quick suggestion for an easier scarf.  Use a potato peeler and peel thin strips of carrot.  Wraps easier and coordinates with the feet and beak!

These are hilarious!  My friends and I made them for a "girls" night, and giggled all the way through.  So fun!  I found that putting a little cream cheese on the carrot bottom (feet) made the body stick better.  And the thicker the slices, the more they stand up on their own.  Not too thick though, because you don't want an overwhelming carrot flavor. .

My 14 yr old daughter and I made these last Christmas. They were a BIG hit - they look adorable. We made a cheese-ball igloo out of cream cheese and put everything on a platter with crackers.

So adorable, they were a hit with my guests! A little bit time consuming but their small, waddling army made me laugh all day. I used flavored cream cheese to make them tastier. Thanks!

These are so cute!! I cut some roasted red peppers into thin strips to give some of them a scarf. I also made half with a little onion powder in the cream cheese. Excellent!! Update: I made these for a Halloween Party and dressed some of them up... you can see pics at emilybloss.com/penguins ! Here are some tips: cut the feet a little thick (maybe 1/8" or a touch more) then cut out the wedge to make the foot shape. Take the wedge and carefully split it in half sideways to make thin beaks. It doesn't always work but you can cut more wedges from the extra carrot. If the beak is too wide I cut off the side tips a little bit to make it more narrow. Cut a slit in the head for the beak to go in. We use 2 cans of colossal size olives for the base, cut a bit off the bottom so they sit straight, and also cut a wedge out of them so the filling shows through really well, and we put the filling in a ziplock bag with the corner cut off for piping it in. Also cut the bottom of the head a bit to make it go on straight. I think the flavored cream cheese really improves the edibility of these guys... this time I used the spices from the Ranch Dressing II recipe and it was excellent. These can take a bit of time to prepare but the results are way more than worth it! People just love them.

These do take time, but they are so fun to make!  I used a vegetable peeler to thinly slice an already peeled cucumber, and then cut the slice into narrow strips to form the scarf.  The strips were long enough to tie a loose not, slip it over the penguins head, and then pull it tight enough for it to be secure.

I made these at christmas time and everyone thought they were just too cute. So now they have been planned for the Super Bowl Party with a few changes. I made a practice batch just to make sure they would turn out perfect before the big game
In  honor of both teams I made a double batch just as written and added a small slice of yellow bell pepper down the front of the cream cheese to represent the Steelers and then used green olives with mozzerella/ string cheese for the Packers. My man and my kids laughed so hard. We placed them on a large cardboard piece , covered with a light coating of cream cheese and covered that with dried parsely to represent the field and used  canned cheese to make the hash marks
LOVE this recipe.Thanks Valerie

This is always a hit at every winter event that I take it to. Over the years I've fine-tuned the prep time by taking advantage of other reviewers . . . but the best thing that I do is that I make a cheese ball from a favorite recipe (or you can even purchase a cheese ball); and then I 'frost' it with softened cream cheese and take a toothpick to carve lines in it resembling blocks of snow so it looks like an igloo. Then I make a 'door' by scraping off the cream cheese in the form of an upside down U - thus exposing the cheese ball. I arrange the penguins around the igloo and place them all on a shiney metal serving tray to look like ice. This is a darling center piece. Make sure to serve crackers along side.

I've made these a few times to take to events and they are always the hit of the party. They do take some effort but they are well worth it! I use cream cheese and the ranch dip mix. I use the sandwich bag appraoch to fill the bodies, I also cut out a small sliver in the body to make it easier to fill. Putting the beak into the head is the hardest part. Make a pretty large slit and they will fit. Once it's assembled noone notices how big the slit is for the beak. I also take the wedge that is cut out from the feet for the beak and halve it so it is thinner. A pain, but it makes it easier to insert into the head. I also added those little umbrellas on a few like you get in foofoo drinks. Thank you Valerie!

Adorable. Adding my 3 tips to the 500 remarks already posted.
1. Insert the tooth pick into the carrot feet, then slide the filled olives on. Sturdier.

2. Fill small olive before trying to insert beak. Less likely to break.

3. To store or transport, use disposable mini muffin pans and stand them up in there. They stay put.

Like everybody says, it's a really big hit.  Here's a way to TRANSPORT the penguins.  I lined them up in a flat tupperware container low enough so the toothpicks were above the rim.  I stretched a piece of cellophane over the top and poked the toothpick tops through, then rubber banded the cellophane around the container.  This kept the penguins from tipping.  I assembeled the "scene" using blue cellophane covered paper as water, shredded mozzarella for snow and sliced mozzarela for icebergs.  Upon arrival, I set up the penguins.

These are awesome! The hardest part is just picking through the olives for uniform appearance! I bought 2 sizes of olives (medium & large) but they ended up still looking the same size so I would suggest buying, say, small & large or medium & jumbo to save some work.  Also use whipped cream cheese and pipe it from a ziplock bag with the corner snipped - it makes filling them a lot easier! Thanx for posting - they were a big hit with the guests!

These are just too cute.  They were the hit of the party.  Everyone loved them.  I made an igloo out of a cheeseball topped with cream cheese.  I scored the cream cheese with a knife to make the illusion of ice blocks.  I formed a little cream cheese as the opening of the igloo.  Much easier to make if you have a helper!!  Thanks for such a unique recipe.

Very fun appetizer.  They were a bit difficult to put together at first but once we got the hang of it they went very smoothly.  One note on the triangle noses is to put the small end in first.  We tried inserting the big end first for pointed noses but the other way is easier and looks better too!

I personally don't like olives, but these are a HUGE hit at every party I bring them to.  A neighbor's mom even brought one home for a friend who loves penguins!  Well worth the time involved.  I add taco seasoning or italian dressing seasoning to the cream cheese for flavor or for a theme party.  These are great and I really appreciate the recipe!!!!!!!

Yes, they are a bit time consuming, but I don't mind the extra effort for a special occassion. However, I have discovered that it is impossible to make too many of these little guys!!

The whipped cream cheese (vs the typical block) is very easy to work with for the filling, I recommend it.

Everyone at the party thought I was very cleaver, it was difficult not to take credit, but I spread the word about allrecipes.com and how great this site is.  I put my colony of penguins(cream cheese ball igloo included) on a board covered with tinfoil and that blue saran wrap to look like ice.

I have been making these for 5 yrs & am amazed at the reactions I get. I make a shrimp tree & place the penguins around the bottom..this is my most requested thing to bring....Yes, they are time consuming, but I have finally got it down....
Had some friends over & I showed them how to do it...I use a 16" disposable decorating bag without a tip, just cut the plastic to a comfortable size that works for you...
Buy 1 can small olives & 1 can JUMBO...have everything at room temp,( I have mixed the cream cheese with ranch - for variety) 
I like to have a thick carrot base -about 1/2" ,after cutting out the pie shaped beak, I make that thinner, outerwise it will split the small olive head...
Just put the softened cream cheese in the bag & pipe it into the body, add the head, put the toothpick thru both olives & press into the feet,,,you are done...people are so impressed & this is always a Hit!!!!

We had too much fun making these. But I have a trick with the heads...I inserted the carrot piece threw the big whole that points to the back...and with a toothpick pushed the carrot piece gently through the already cross tipped whole for the beak...And I used the Chive and Onion Whipped cream cheese that I had on had...talk about cute, adorable and a conversation piece. Thank you...all my penguins thank you too. ;-)

Fun to make these little guys, albeit time consuming (whole thing took about 2-1/2 hours).  To make them tastier, I used 1 package of cream cheese, 3 ounces of very finely crumbled feta cheese and ~ 1/4 of a white onion (finely minced) with garlic powder and Beau Monde (spice blend).  The feta and onions have to be very small pieces in order for them to fit through a large bore piping tip.  I made an igloo out of a cheese ball (any kind you like) covered with the remaining cream cheese and feta mixture.  I also insert a wooden skewer with a construction paper flag with the name of our club through the center of the igloo.  I made a water scene using sparkly blue wrapping paper and used veggie cut-out of fish (or you can use Goldfish™ crackers).  It was a huge hit!

I have to agree, these are the cutest garnish ever!  I love the idea of the igloo.  I was spreading cream cheese on the plate to resemble snow.  Also, after you put the cream cheese in the piping bag, microwave it for a few seconds and it will squeeze out nicely.  Using the proper size of olives works out great too. I made a criss/cross slit in the little olive to place the beak into; worked pretty well.

THANK YOU for sharing this great idea! We had an Iron Chef contest at work & the appetizer had to have olives in it-I won 1st place a $50 gift card! I added dry ranch to the cream cheese for the tummies and because it was "diversity week" at work, printed out tiny flags froms different countries and glue-sticked onto the toothpicks. I added roasted red pepper scarves as well. Made an 'igloo' out of cream cheese and chopped up black and greene olives and added green olive juice 'to taste' until I had a dirty martini flavor.. Put saran in a round bowl and plopper in the mixture to make the igloo size. next morning popped it out and covered with a thin layer of whipped cream cheese and made 'igloo cubes" with a tooth pick...made the entrance by taking 1/4 of a block of cream cheese and folding it into an arch. SUCH A HIT! Serve the dirty 'martini dip" on butter crackers. Thanks again for a great recipe!

These are so cute and easy to do.  Don't plan on serving them as an actual dish , they're better as a garnish.  Make a cheese ball; cream cheese, two or three other cheeses, bacon bits, pecans, etc. Now make it into an igloo shape. Shape an entrance tunnel and attach to the igloo. Let it chill. Use room temperature cream cheese to cover the ball to look like ice.  Use a toothpick to draw in the "blocks of the ice".  Cut out a 1/4" of extra large olives, stuff with flavored cream cheese, chill. don't worry if there's cream cheese on the olive, after they're chilled, use a damp paper towel to clean them up. Buy the crinkle cut carrot chips, cut out a triangle at one end of the carrot chip. Put the triangle you  just cut out in the sliced  end of a medium size olive. IMPORTANT, use the toothpick to tap a hole in the carrot slice for the feet. Now put the toothpick through the head, through the body and into the carrot chip.  Cover a tray with foil, place the cheese ball igloo on the tray.  Place rows of crackers, green onions, and radishes all around the tray.  Use the penguins to group outside the igloo, stand on top of the crackers and just be cute.  It's a show stopper. I made 22, didn't really need that many, and it took about 45 minutes, plus the time to make the cheese ball.  People are still talking about them.  Thank you, Valerie.

These penguins were such fun.  Everybody was enthralled with them.  I made them using a lot of the hints, such as flavoring the cheese and putting the beaks into the crosscut end. Using marinated roasted red peppers with garlic for the scarves made them tastier.

In assembling them, I dried the olives as much as possible and did the plastic bag trick for filling them (also filled the head).  Keeping the areas as dry as possible seemed to do the trick as far as keeping the cheese from  smearing all over the olives. Putting on a big white restaurant apron, dampening a double sheet of paper towel and laying it on the table in front of me was the beginning. When I got cheese on my hands I dampened them on the towel and wiped them on the apron. Then using a facial tissue, wiped the outside of the olives (paper towel was too stiff).  Worked like a charm.

Valerie, thanks for the unique idea.

Thanks also to the member who said to transport them, put a sheet of plastic wrap over the picks to keep them upright.  They were transported a hundred miles and only a couple had tipped over.  They were also made 3 days before being used.  A dampened paper towel under them and covered with the plastic wrap kept them fresh.  Even the feet and beaks stayed bright orange.  I taped the plastic to the rectangular container.

These deserve a 5 for presentation but lacks a little in flavor.  I added some ranch mix to cream cheese to spice it up a bit.  I used jumbo for bottom, medium for top and it was perfect but large.  I may try large/small next time.  I also put little banana pepper dabs to look like a tie instead of a scarf.

I cannot rate on taste, as I'm not a fan of either black olives or cream cheese, but these were relatively easy to make and super cute.  My olives were not as big as I'd hoped, so I only cut a slit and piped cream cheese in w/my smallest tip.  I found an assembly line of sorts worked the best for me, dry the olives, clean/cut carrots and notch, add the beak, pipe cream cheese, then toothpick them all together.  I'll def keep these in mind for a winter novelty...EDIT:  I forgot to add that I made 1 the night before and placed in the frig to see how it would hold up-perfect!  Just like I'd just made it.

Fun! Made these for my sons preschool class, what a hit! Use a larger carrot for the base so they don't fall over. My husband called those that fell over a "dead soldier" and gobbled them up. Used chive and onion flavored cream cheese and piped in with a sandwich baggie per other reviews, worked well.

These were a hit last Saturday at a theatre party. I know some people on here say that they don't taste good and all that, but all the guests loved them and I tried one too and they were great. You can't do a whole bunch with olives and cream cheese, but I used chive cream cheese and served buttery crackers on a plate next to them and they are really good with the crackers because it gives it an added taste. I also used a jar of marinated red bell peppers for a scarf on some. They do take some time to make---I made about sixteen and it took about 45 min, mainly because of the carrots (I broke a few olives trying to get the beak in--but I got to eat them:) but found overall that they are fairly easy to make, don't cost much to make and are easily the cutest thing you can make. I highly recommend you try it out. I think you'll find that by putting in your favorite cream cheese or adding spices to regular and serving up some crackers and some red bell peppers or pimentos or something, these are very very good.

Adorable and yummy! I made one alteration: I put the top olive sideways, so I could put the beak through the hole in the back and it came out the x in the front. Also, don't make them too far in advance--they dry out rather quickly.

I made these for Thanksgiving at my sisters and these little guys turned out great!  It is a bit time consuming, but worth it as everyone will love them.  I did make an "igloo" cheese ball to go with them made out of white cheddar and it was adorable.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It's worth the work just for all the great responses it gets.  I used rondele cheese instead of cream cheese.  It was very easy to pipe in with a ziploc bag.  I also made a cheese ball into an igloo and "frosted" it with a sour cream/cream cheese mix.

I helped a friend of mine with these for a graduation party.  It did take a while, but they did look good. I am not a fan of black olives, so I didn't even try them.  Everyone else had a comment about how cute they were.  I did hear some people say that there wasn't much taste though.  These are fun to make with friends...I don't suggest you do this by yourself...othewise you will make yourself go crazy.  It was fun to make.  Thanks for posting.

I give this recipe 5 stars for presentation and what fun they were to make and all the guests LOVED them!  There were the hit of the brial shower.  But I give them 3.5 in taste.  They are time consuming to make, I made them with 2 other people, so it was not too bad.  Once you get your rythm going, its easy.  I also made a cheese ball igloo, covered it in whipped cream cheese, and used a toothpick to make the lines of the igloo. I also made a little flag and taped it to a toothpick that said the "Bride and Grooms last names" House.  It was great!!! Good Luck!

So cute!!!  These were a big hit at a Christmas party and my nephew's graduation party.   They aren't hard to do, just take some time.  I found it easiest to do all of one step at a time, cut all the large olives first, then fill them with cream cheese, etc.  I used roasted red bell pepper for scarves and a parsley sprig for a green hat.  My mom used a square piece of green onion for a mortarboard hat for the graduation party.  Cute, cute, cute.  Even my husband said, "Take a picture of it!" And they taste pretty good too!

I have never really tried to do anything half way creative for a party. Going to the corner store and picking up something to bring is the usual for me. I'm not that artistic. So when my mother laughed at me for wanting to try this recipe and stuff little black olives. I had to prove to her I could do it. To my surprise it wasn't hard at all. Time was the biggest factor. I had 25 done within a half hour. Keep a clean wet towel by when stuffing the olives because the cream cheese does get a little runny. Everyone loved these at the party and could beleive I was the one who made them. They were a BIG hit.

These were so cute!  For the beak, I found it difficult to stick the carrot in the center.  So, I used the end opposite of the large hole, which has a tiny hole or slit already...way easier! It makes the head look more round than oval, it worked out very well.  I will definitely make these again, its worth the effort!

The first time I made these were to have something cheerful at Christmas for my beautiful step-mom that was losing her battle with cancer.  I can't even put to words to reaction the penguins got.  They each have their own personality.  I use the furry top toothpicks and put on a white plate covered with coconut to simulate snow.  I am not a big olive fan, so have never consumed one in the five years I've been making them, but they always seem to disappear.  I made them last Saturday and one guest took two home to her kids.  They are so cute!

Truly adorable little penguins AND delicious!! I've made these twice now and everyone I have shown them to loved them as well and also asked for the recipe (that's how you know it's good :]). The first time I accidentally got all my olives the same size, but this didn't really matter. I've tried using regular cream cheese as well as a chive/garlic flavored whipped cream cheese. The whipped one was definitely easier to work with (it's already soft) and it tasted good, but it didn't have as much flavor as regular cream cheese. Next time I'll try adding some herbs and such to the regular cream cheese. 

These were a bit time-consuming to make at first, but after the first few penguins you'll get the hang of it and go faster. For more useful tips, everyone has already mentioned them, so just look through the top comments :]!

These were so much fun at the New Year's Party last night!  People actually gathered around it and took pictures of them.  I had a piece of celery that acted as a teeter totter on a large dried marshmellow under the center.  I made a mini sign that said "Happy New Year!", held on a toothpick and put in on the penquin that was in the air of the teeter totter.  Added pieces of brocoli that served as bushes on the platter.  wholla!  A great presentation that was so much fun for the kids as the adults!

I love penguins and so this recipe was perfect for my New Year's Party.  I only had medium olives, so I used them for both the head and the body, trying to use smaller olives  from the can for the heads, but regardless, worked out fine.  I used the little X in the olives for the place to insert the carrot beak.  Also, for the body, I cut two slits, to remove a wedge-like section instead of just one slit and opening up the olive. This way, I didn't have to fill the olive with too much cream cheese, and since I didn't have to hold it open, it made filling it easier.  I also used a ziploc bag with the corner cut.  super easy.  My guests loved them and even wanted to make some themselves!  I only made a partial recipe, so the remaining cream cheese was sliced up and layered to create ice floes on which the penguins stood.  Thanks so much for the idea!!!

I gave this 5 stars because they were so fun for me & my 11 yr. old daughter to make.  I added just a bit of garlic powder to the cream cheese & used a baggie with the corner cut off to "pipe" in the cream cheese.  Are they the best tasting appetizer...no, but they are SOOOO cute!

I broke a lot of olives when I tried to push the toothpick through the carrot.  The carrot also made for an odd texture combination in the mouth.  Next time I will try using pieces of cheddar cheese instead.

Brought these little guys to Christmas carry in for work.  Everybody loved them, they are still talking about them.  I used a cookie sheet with stryofoam covered in plastic wrap, made the night before and they didn't dry up (which I was worried about).  Also made a christmas tree cheesball and surrounded it with the little guys. To make the cheesball I shaped ball like a tree, then rolled in finely diced fresh parsley.  Then decorated the tree with pieces of red & green peppers (which I had on hand for the scarves).  And cut a Star for the tree out of a slice of carrot.  What a fun recipe!  Made everyone smile!

I've had these before and no matter what kind of effort they require, you can't give anything less than 5 stars to something so adorable!  And while the flavor is nothing spectacular, that's not really the point- these are a real crowd pleaser!! And as the photos will show, the possibilities are endless!

These were so cute!  The whole fam got involved making these and we all had a blast.  We are having them for New Year's Eve.  I don't understand the reviewers who gave less stars because it was time-consuming or difficult.  That's just common sense from looking at the recipe.  I knew just from the recipe that it would be very time-consuming.   I will make these again for special occasions!

I used the small olive holes to insert the carrot wedges.  I also used veggie cream cheese instead of plain.  To hold them in place for transport I suggest using a clean, disposible pan "frosted" with plain cream cheese to create a winter wonderland.  Just stick the carrot feet in and go, plus it looks great.

This is a terrific recipe and very creative! A real attention getter. 

2 TIPS for you this time: 
Add 1 envelope of Knorr Leek Soup Mix to a tub of cream cheese for unbelievably awsome flavor(every one of our guests raved). We set them on a platter of crushed ice and a bowl of spinach dip in the middle.
Second, use a plastic zip-lock sandwich bag filled with the cream cheese with a tiny snip in one corner to 'pipe' the cheese into the olives.  MUCH EASIER than a spoon!!! You will be able to knock them out in seconds! 
Hats off to you Valerie Lynne!

Extra cute, and good even if it's not Christmastime.  I made these for our staff appreciation luncheon and placed them on a blue saran wrap covered metal platter (so it looked like ice) with a paper that said "Our teachers are the COOLEST in town!"  Also added some garlic powder as suggested in other reviews.  Definitely a good attention grabber!

Super cute and fun to make. Be sure to use jumbo olives because Lindsay large and medium are the same size. I put them on a silver-colored platter with a cheeseball igloo and they were the highlight of the table. I piped them full of Rondelle with a ziploc bag with a corner cut off. Pretty easy once you get going. Enjoy!

I made these for my daughters baptism and they were a huge hit!  People were taking pictures of them!  I suggest making the carrot feed a little bigger than the recipe calls for to give them a stronger base and keep them from toppling over... you can simply make the notch in the feet bigger to bring them back into proportion visually.  They are time consuming, but worth the effort.  I made the scarves, and found it easier to make the red pepper slices extremely thin and very long so you can pin them on the toothpick before you put the "heads" on the penguins to keep the scarves from falling off.  And don't let the cream cheese get be too warm before you start because it becomes gooey quickly as you stuff the olives and makes it harder to manage.

Great! For the beaks, I cut the carrots in 1/8 inch widths, then made a diamond pattern. It made it easier to insert the 'beak' - I also made a slit in the 'head' to insert the beak. Also whipped cream cheese is pretty easy to work with. I can't wait to finish my display for the holidays!

This was the best.  We used them for our Winter Ball at church.  The only suggestion I have is that you fill them and make the heads, then assemble them AFTER you get to your destination.  They don't travel well.  Cut the carrots a little thicker.  We also added a small amount of sour cream so we could use a pastery bag to pipe the filling into the tummies.  This was probably the best of the best that I have used in entertaining.                 AT HOME: we aren't quite as elaborate.  We slice the olives, laya slivered carrot in the middle--then pipe the filling in.  We don't like pemintos, so the carrot as a little texture and color.  Yummy!!

These were quite a hit at a party I went to, but the little critters kept falling down.  I like the review that suggested a foam base with the toothpicks sticking into the foam.  I will try that next time.

I made these along with a cheeseball igloo for a New Year's Day party, and I used quite a few suggestions from reviewers. Here are a couple of my own: It's MUCH easier to slide the carrot onto the toothpick and you don't split the olives trying to force it on if you make a hole in the carrot beforehand by pushing a toothpick thru it. To make a frozen  pond for my display, I dissolved one pkg of blue Jello in 2/3 cup boiling water (no cold water), chilled it in a loaf pan and cut it to shape.

I've made these several times - terrific recipe, and worth the effort. Seasoned cream cheese is a great idea! I use baby carrot slices to create the noses - helps create pieces that are small enough not to split the "head olives."

These penguins were GREAT!  I'm only giving it a 4 because they are so labor-intensive.  We made these as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner, and they were just too cute!  We used garlic and herb whipped cream cheese and a cookie press to get it in the olives.  It definitely took two people to pipe the cream cheese in, but I did the rest of the assembly by myself.  We covered a plate in foil, then blue saran wrap to look like ice, and served it with a cheese ball (Cheese Ball I recipe on this website) shaped like an igloo.

This was a big hit!  I stuck the beaks in pointy side first because I thought the flat beaks were easier and more comical. If you are going to use a baggie to pipe out the cream cheese USE A FREEZER BAGGIE!  My cheapie bag kept tearing and squirting out cream cheese in all directions!~  Also, I bought a white styrofoam cooler(The $2.45 kind), flipped the lid, and just stabbed the penguins into what ended up looking like a large glacier.  Not even one of my penguins fell over during transport!

I made these penguins for two different Christmas parties I went to and they were a huge hit at both parties! The hostess insisted on taking a picture before anyone could eat one!  I used the suggestion to use a cheese ball as a Igloo and I made the "ice" with foil and blue plastic wrap. It couldn't have been better!! 
I found that the pastry bag made filling the bodies very easy. The toughest part was getting the "beak" in without breaking the olive (even after making slits) but after awhile, I got good at even that! It was fun! 
The only change I made was to beat the cream cheese and add some onion soup mix to the cream cheese for flavor.  
Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe! All of my friends were impressed!! :)

These are the cutest things.  I made them for a cocktail party last weekend, and I'm still getting emails raving about them. One guy took one home.  Rather than whipping the cream cheese, I microwaved it and tstirred in a bit of onion soup mix to give it some flavour, and then piped it in using a parchment paper cone.  I have to admit, they weren't that tasty, but the visual presentation made up for it big time. I put it on a frosty blue tray covered in saran wrap, and added a cheese ball igloo.  Make sure you warn people about the toothpick (sometimes it's not that visible)  My only problem is.. how am I going to top this recipe for my next cocktail party?!?

I made these last year for our neighborhood progressive Christmas dinner.  We were in charge of appetizers.  

They were adorable as they surrounded the tray of shrimp cocktail.

They were time consuming to make.  The presentation was worth the effort.

I used a pastry bag to fill the large olive with cream cheese.

My husband and I recently hosted the rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding.  I did all the decorting and cooking for 40+ people, and wanted some of the dishes I prepared to be a little unique or eye-catching.  When I found this recipe for the olive cream cheese penguins, I knew I had found just what I was looking for!  These little penguins were the hit of our dinner!  I made several batches of penguins, and all of them found their way either into our guests tummies, or to our guests' homes.  Several people took penguins home with them so they could learn to make them, too, and share the idea with their friends and relatives.  I found another recipe (on the internet) for these penguins with a "seasoned" cream cheese mixture, and will try it the next time I make them.  Thanks for a GREAT idea.  It was a huge success!

I made these for an informal wedding I was catering.  I just couldn't resist trying it, and didn't want to wait until next winter to use it.  I had to keep making them, because people who saw them beforehand just had to try them.  I used a star tip on my pastry bag to fill these and worked great.  Time consuming...but be patient they are worth it.  Also, make them about 2 hours before serving, then chill.  The carrots dry up fast.  Too cute and loved by all!

I made this for a New Year's Eve gathering.  They were the hit of the night.  I added a packet of ranch dressing dip mix to the cream cheese for flavor and to enhance the color.  I sautéed the strips of red bell pepper in olive oil and water while I continued my prep of the olives.  I know a lot of folks like meat with their snacks, so I cut up a salami to make their feet.  When I ran out of that, I used carrots as the recipe suggests.  I did try to create an igloo out of the cheese ball but it was so soft I couldn't do it.  But everyone was so in love with the penguins they didn't really want the cheese ball anyway.  I will definitely be making these again.  It was a process but as long as you have everything prepped before you begin it is much simpler to get things going like an assembly line.  These are definitely worth the effort.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Easy to make and a fun family activity.  I used a chive flavored cream cheese which was fine but I wished I had gone with a stronger tasting cheese.  Next time I will use ranch flavored.  Thank you!

I am so excited I found this! I forgot about these! My mom and I made them for Christmas eve one year, no one wanted to eat them cuz they were too cute! My mom also made an igloo shaped cheese ball to go with them, cutest snack EVER! Like other reviewers, we went with whipped cream cheese, much easier to fill :) I can't wait to make them again for my kids :)

This recipe was a huge hit at the cookie swap.  The only downside is that ladies didn't want to eat them - they were too cute! I bought "large olives" which I used for both the body and head. With the cream cheese filling, the bodies were plenty big enough than the head.  Also, I did read some folks had challenges with getting the "beak" into the small olives. I think it was easier working with the large olives. The whole, regular carrots are a must as the "feet" slices have be big enough to keep the penguins from tipping.   Many of these little guys went home in a napkin blanket.  Great healthy snack for kids who love olives...or for a fun, impressive winter party app!

Great crowd  pleaser! Everyone thought they were so cute! They were more work than I anticipated, but worth it! I did pipe the cream cheese to give them a ruffled shirt look. As another reviewer mentioned, I did overhear I comment that I must have had a lot of time on my hands to do these! Well, I did! I made these about a year ago and people still talk about them. Thanks!

My grandkids love these.  Made them last Christmas and they were a big hit.  I have since changed the feet to chedder cheese  instead of carrots.  Easy  to cut and sticks to olive and plate better. Thanks for the great idea.

So adorable! I used garden veggie flavored cream cheese. Be sure to cut the carrots very thin, otherwise it can be difficult to delicately stick the toothpick through.
For presentation I set up a whole 'winter scene' with styrofoam and plastic wrap, then stuck it to a piece of cardboard painted blue and shaped to fit in my cake carrier. Half were gone before I even made it in the door of the party I brought them to!

I made these for a Christmas party and they were very cute.  So cute, that people said they didn't want to eat them! I used veggie cream cheese which added a little more flavor.  These are definitely time consuming, but if you use a frosting bag for the cream cheese, it helps you make them faster.

I just made these adorable little penguins for my New Year's Eve cocktail party and they were quite the conversation piece!  They were really fun to make, I enjoyed it - though it did take me longer than 30 minutes, more like 45.  I made them at around noon then put them in the fridge and they were fine for serving at 8:00, not dry at all.  Thanks for sharing!

A few tips for a successful penguin assembly. 

For the penguin body take a jumbo olive and use the small "cross" on one end as a template for cutting. Use a sharp knife with a pointed tip and insert it into the "cross". Use the slot made from the pitting process as a guide for your knife and make your first cut. Follow the next tip of the "cross" to make your second cut. This will give an even 1/4 part to remove. 

I use a butter knife and regular cream cheese to fill the penguin bodies. Using a small amount on the tip of the knife it slides in quite easily. Use your finger to touch up where needed.

For the heads it works best to cut narrow triangles. Insert them through the large hole end and the "beak" will pop out of the smaller hole. Use a toothpick to push through. 

The rest of the penguin is easy to assemble. Just made sure the carrot is nice and thick to create a sturdy base. 

A nice variation is to mince smoked salmon, fresh dill and a squeeze of lemon juice into the cream cheese before assembling.

I'm giving these five stars because of the cuteness factor.  They are time consuming and my husband thought I had too much time on my hands.  However, my guests loved them. I can't stand olives, but had to make them for conversation if nothing else.  Next time I'll prepare some type of iceberg to put them on for real effect.

VERY time consuming. Although using a piping bag to fill the olives cuts down on a lot of time. I also add 1/2 pkg. of original ranch dip mix into the cream cheese. Ties everything together so they are not so bland. I added a "triangle" of red pepper to the top of the head too to make it look like a little santa hat! HUGE hit at our Holiday party, will probably make again next year!

These guys are not only adorable, they're actually surprisingly yummy! I made them for my daughter's birthday party. Even though the kids didn't try them -- which I completely expected from 7 year-old girls -- they were absolutely delighted by them. The grown-ups and older kids LOVED them. They're easy to make, extremely cute, and delicious. Highly recommend!

Talk about being a hit a the party! More photos were taken of this dish than of people there.  I filled the little guys with Boursin Cheese - very tasty. The biggest tip I can give is, read the other reviews, I think it saved me a lot of time in the end.

It is time consuming, but worth the effort! Guests love these little guys!  I also used a slight amount of ranch dip powder in the cream cheese to give it a little bit more flavour. Not too much though to avoid the salty taste. I made them last Christmas for a Christmas party but just forgot to review.  Thanks so much for the great idea!

I have made these little guys a couple of times, and they are such a hit! Recently served a group of them on a glass cake stand with parsley around the base, presented as "groomsmen" at a bridal tea -- everyone was talking about them. Takes a little time but the results are worth it for presentation alone (and they are quite tasty, too!)

These are adorable and easy.  They're also time consuming, but pleasantly so.  Two hints for success: 1) Add half a pack of ranch seasoning and a minced clove of garlic to give the filling flavor 2) Do yourself a favor - use a piping bag (or a ziplock with the corner clipped off).  It makes things go much faster and cleaner.

Worth the time and effort for the comments and pictures. I made the heads and landscape the night before. Couldn't find blue plastic wrap so I used a platter covered with blue wrapping paper covered with plastic wrap for the water effect. Will yse a pizza pan next time A couple of packages of cream cheese flavored with garlic powder for the landscape. I also used marinated mushrooms for some rocks on the shoreline. I found a cheap SMALL pastry bag (cookie decorating)for filling the bodies and it really made a difference on ease.

Wow!  This was so much fun to put together.  I thought it would take longer to do but it was surprisingly quick.  I found that the "bodies" stood up much better when I sliced a tiny bit off the bottom of the olive so it was completely flat against the carrot feet.  I bought a cheese ball since time was tight and frosted it with whipped cream cheese to make the igloo.  Next time I won't use the whipped kind since it was hard to draw lines through it.  I covered a pizza pan with tin foil, lay a piece of blue construction paper over top and then covered it again with saran so the "water" would look icy.  Then I covered the base with slabs of cream cheese and they made a great bank of snow against the water.  I also used a piece of styrofoam which was in a box with an appliance and I roughed up the surface so it resembled a snowy hill and I stood 2 penguins on the ledges.  The penguins stood in place well since they were set into the cream cheese.  The whole thing turned out well and it was pretty tasty since I followed others' advice and used a flavoured cream cheese instead of plain.  Thanks so much for this recipe and for all the photos I used as a guide.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I brought these to a Linux User Group party, and they were a hit!  I used flavored cream cheese, which made them quite tasty.  They want me to make them every year now.  They were a little bit of work, but worth it.

What an adorable idea. I took a plate full of these to a party and got rave reviews. Even the men were making over them.  Only change I made was to make the beak out of a thinner slice of carrot. The thick wedge taken out of the foot piece was too much to put in the small olive without splitting it. People's reaction is well worth the effort.

The host and hostess of the party I took these to wouldn't let anyone eat them until they took a picture!  They were easy to make (definitely use the whipped cream cheese) and held together just fine without using a toothpick.  My stepdaughter and I were cracking up the whole time we were making them because these little guys are just so darned cute!

Made these for my son's first birthday open house and they were a smash!  Some guests didn't want to each them because they were so cute and obviously take a little work.
I used a pastry bag to pipe the cream cheese (I whipped it, first) into the olives as another review suggested.  MUCH easier than trying to stuff them with a utensil, which I tried on a test run. 
My daughter, a black olive afficianado, couldn't keep her mitts off of these as I made them!
Sent the instructions home with several guests and will use these again at Christmas time for our family gathering.

I made these little fellows for a cocktail party - they brought giggles from the guests and everyone wanted the recipe.  They're quite easy to make, the cream cheese will hold together any 'errors'.  I used baby carrots and they worked out fine.  Definitely give this fun recipe a try.

They looked cute, but didn't go over very well. No one really wanted to eat them at our Christmas dinner. The grandkids all had one and the rest sat there, so I will not be making again.

I made a full flock of these little guys for my holiday table. Once I got the process down it was smooth sailing. I tripled the recipe and had the bunch "marching" along in no particular order across my buffet table. What a delightful addition! The prime rib was nice, the homemade pie was good. But several months later I'm still getting comments about the penguin troop.

Sooo super fun! Made these as garnishes for NYE this past year for a party. I placed them randomly on veggie platters and cheese/sausage plates. People were so impressed by these little guys - Taking pictures and not sure they could eat them. But... Besides being super cute - they are DELICIOUS!

I made this for a New Years Eve party and they were a hit.  Even the men liked them and of course the kids thought they were great.  One of the ladies said she wished she had been the Diva that brought them.  I did use the trick one of the readers gave about using foam board and sticking the tooth pick into it, works great for traveling with them,  My only suggestion is dont us cheap tooth picks they break when you use the foam board.  It was time consuming but worth it.  Love this recipe

These are great.  I too used the cream cheese in a baggie idea and it made filling the "colossal" olives so easy.  The most difficult part for me was putting the little "noses" on the smaller olive! I waited till the last minute to get party toothpicks and the store was out, so I glued little pom poms on regular ones.  (Imagine that 8:00 on Christmas eve and they were out!)  I will probably make these again for a New Years Eve party

People loved these! I think it took me well over an hour, though. It took at least an hour to put them together and about 5 min. prep time for the carrots.  I found I had to cut down the 'noses', too, to get them to fit in easily and not smoosh in the faces. I thought they tasted just fine - no need to add any seasoning. I found it quite difficult to stuff the cheese into the olive as well, without getting it all over the olive. I then tried a piping bag (ziplock) and I liked it, but the cream cheese got warm and didn't look very nice so I had to chill the bag and try it again. It just took a while for me to get it figured out the best way to get the cheese in there - a small kids spoon did not work well.

These were so adorable!  Once my fiancee and I made them, we couldn't help but laugh every tim e we walked by them!  I would say, though, that for an army of 20 penquins, 4 oz. of cream cheese is more than enough.  I added a touch of garlic powder to the cream cheese for flavor, and I microwaved the cc for 10 sec. then 10 sec. more for easy use.  I always use the baggie as pastry bag method and it's perfect! Just start small with cutting the corner, you can always cut off more! If this is Valerie Lynne's creation, kudos for a creative, ingenious, delightful, awesome appetizer/decoration!  Thanks for letting me get so many complements and feel so good about something I did!  BRAVA!!

These were so adorable that I didn't even care if they tasted well or not, but they were really good! I was expecting a difficult and/or time consuming chore but I was pleasantly surprised. Jumbo olives with the holes up and small olives with the holes down. I didn't even need to use a baggie or anything to stuff the cream cheese. I just carefully used a spoon and wiped off any excess after they were in the refrigerator for awhile. I made the slit for the beaks as others had suggested. Thank you for an amazing and creative recipe!! I almost forgot to mention, but I used chive and onion cream cheese for the stuffing. We loved it!

OMG! This is the cutest ever! My husband and I made them for a party we were going to. It took us about 1 hour to make 50 of them. Definitely easy if you put the cream cheese in a baggie and pipe it into the black olive. Of course I had to use my finger to smooth it out and wipe any cream cheese away from the outside of the olive, but it only took a second to do. And we followed the advice to add some powdered ranch dressing to the cream cheese mixture, and they were soooo good! People who didn't even like black olives loved the penguins. We also won 1st place, Most Unique Appetizer at the party we attended! :) I will definitely be bringing these fun guys to more get together's! They were the talk of the party!

I've wanted to make these for a couple years now, but was really intimidated. They are pretty easy to make though! The hardest part is getting the "beak" in, so just make sure the carrot is pretty thin for that. I added dry ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese for more flavor and let it set for a little while to soften. Then I put that into a baggie, cut the end off to make a tip, and piped it into the olive. Very easy. They are so unbelievably adorable; thank you SO much for sharing this with everyone!

I had so much fun making these. I did add various spices (garlic powder, salt, pepper, italian seasoning) into the cream cheese. I also put the cream cheese inside a plastic ziploc bag with a corner cut off to get the cheese inside the "bodies." 

Everyone loved them and thought they were so neat!

These were a huge hit at a Xmas party I went to!  I used store brand garlic and herb spreadable cheese (very tasty).  I put an igloo in the center made from a cheese ball and for the entrance I cut about a 1.5 inch section off of a matching cheese log.  I also put everything on styrofoam (covered in blue saran wrap)and pushed the toothpicks thru so they would stay standing.  (I posted the final picture on here.)

Wonderful! Received rave reviews at our Christmas party. I made a penguin "habitat" with 3 layers of one inch thick styrofoam. The bottom layer was left uncut. The middle layer had a small "pool" cut out. The top layer had a larger cutout over the pool, making a sort of ledge. I put a blue piece of paper and a layer of clear saran wrap under the pool cutout to look like water, and frosted the whole habitat with whipped cream cheese, to look like snow. Made an "igloo" cheese ball using a bowl to shape the igloo, and more cheese ball mixture was made into a cone shape and rolled in parsley flakes to make a Christmas tree. The tree was studded with small bits of red pepper for ornaments. We made a diving board and lawn chair by the pool with slices of zucchini. Believe it or not, it was not too time-consuming. We made the styrofoam habitat and the cheese mixtures (the cheese igloo, tree, and stuffing for the olives) the night before. On the day of the party, we only had to assemble the penguins and put the whole thing together. With a helper, it came together fairly quickly. We added a packet of Good Seasons Garlic and Herb Salad Dressing Mix to the cream cheese before stuffing the olives. My teenage daughter loved helping me with this, and our guests loved eating it!

My daughter made these for 4th of July...a great hit and pretty.  She had to make a second batch (the first got ate) and we added herbs/spices to the cream cheese that made a big difference.  We added garlic (as other said), fresh chopped basil, dill and pepper.

These were a big hit at my Department Christmas party today! They were gone less than an hour after I put them out. I mixed 1/3 packet taco dip seasoning into a 12oz whipped cream cheese. It didn't color them much but it made them taste good. Great recipe!

Another rave review for this recipe!  The little penquins got alot of attention at a wine and appetizer party I attended.  Based upon some of the other comments, I thought they would be cute but wouldn't be eaten because other folks said they weren't great tasting.  Well, not one little penguin was left at the end of the night.  A big hit all around.

For a appetizer novelty, these penguins are the best.  They are so cute, when I was making them I was laughing out loud, and my friend was dressing them in green onion scarves and broccoli hats.  They don't taste that good, but you will definately be the hit of the party anyways with these penguins.

These were the talk of my sister-in-law's Christmas party. Believe it or not, these were not that time-consuming--I made approx 40 in less than an hour. Based on reviews, I used onion and chive cream cheese and piped it into the 'body' with a makeshift pastry bag using a ziploc with the corner snipped off. I also made one with a carrot-peel 'scarf' and put it on top of a store-bought port wine cheese ball 'igloo' which I covered with cream cheese. Putting scarves on all of the penguins would have added a significant amount of time to the overall project; I discovered by just doing one that it is a bit labor intensive. Mine were a flavorful hit without the scarves, so feel free to leave them off. My mother-in-law swept through the house carrying the platter of penguins, saying "look what my daughter-in-law made!" That alone made it worth it. I will be making these every Christmas!

Adorable.  Easy to make (my daughter helped me) and a big hit at the party!  I think they would taste better next time with something added to the cream cheese.  There are endless possibilities.  We put blocks of Havarti cheese in the center like ice cubes and put a Queen Penguin on top with a crown from a mini bell pepper.

These were a big hit at the Christmas party.  I loaded the cream cheese into a plastic sandwich bag and snipped off the corner for an instant piping bag that really made filling them easy.  A damp paper towel quickly cleaned up any cream cheese that got on the outside of the olive.

OMGosh! I made these for Easter (along with dyed deviled eggs) and lined the outer edge of the plate with them.  I set them on whipped cream cheese to make it look like snow.  I got RAVE reviews on how adorable they were, and how each seemed to have his own "attitude!"  Make sure you use Jumbo olives though, as I used Large and it made it pretty tedious.  But worth the effort!!

These were so cute and were a big hit at our progressive New Years Eve event.  I had trouble finding jumbo pitted black olives so suggest you pick them up early.  I had to make do with smaller ones and they were harder to work with. Regardless they were a big hit and carry over well in refrigerator so you could make them the day before. They do take time to make them.

These were a hit! I don't think it's necessarily the flavor as much as how completely adorable they are...cute can go a long way. 
I took them to a friend's party and people were hunting me down to find out how to make them. 
I had made several and positioned them around a cheese ball made to look like an igloo ( idea from another comment). We also placed them on the edges of other platters just for fun.

So cute!  I took 40 penguins to a New Year's Eve party, and everyone loved them. I used the egg carton idea to transport my penguins, and they traveled very well. Thanks for the great idea!

I made these for two New Years Eve parties. Talk about a hit! People were taking photos - adults, little kids and teenagers (not all at the same party). I placed them on a plate of shredded coconut which looked like snow. I had three sizes of black olives and found that even using the same size olive for one penguin looks great. They were time consuming to make, but the result was worth the effort. Several people said they tasted great - black olives and cream cheese aren't my taste. Thanks for the great idea!

These are the cutest things ever !  I took them to my church Christmas party tonight and the first person that saw them "just had to take a picture". There was quite a few pictures taken throughout the evening.(till they were gone) People were amazed not knowing that they were eatable. :) I will be making them again even though they are a bit of work. THANKS for a GREAT IDEA !!!!!!

These are adorable! I happen to have the ingredients in the house and finally decided to try them. I just used jumbo olives for the body and head and I thought it worked fine. I made the the scarves, as suggested by the recipe submitter, just using 3 different colors of peppers. If I had fresh peppers I would have tried the hats to. They are actually rather easy to assemble, but just take a little time. I might make these on the holiday, but more likely to decorate a vegetable tray.

these little guys were so cute! made them with the blue cheese ball in the shape of an igloo for a holiday party and everyone RAVED about them. A little messy to make - I recommend a piping bag...I didn't have one and used a simple sandwich bag which worked fine.

Really fun and went together easier and quicker than I expected. The feet were perfect with just a little wedge cut out of a slice of small carrot - they all stood up. Used cutout portion to make the nose. For me the cream cheese baggie was way more trouble than just smoothing with a finger and then wiping any excess off during assembly. Made them the evening prior to our dinner and left uncovered in fridge overnight - were still perfect. As others said, not terribly tasty but so cute that they got their pix taken many times and I got rave reviews! Thanks for the great idea.

Made this for our Sunday School Progressive Dinner and it was a big hit.  Did them the day before and they were fine. Hardest part: beak and wrapping red pepper around neck. Used roasted red pepper and put on before party but only did a few which was good enough.  Read reviews for other great ideas.  thanks

Went to a friend's Christmas party last weekend who loves ANYTHING with penguins.  They were a huge hit.  People were taking pictures--one person even 'fessed up to putting one in her purse to take home so she could figure out how to make them! Will definitely be making them again this holiday season.  As we were leaving the party, was told I was the "Woman of the Evening".  They are as fun to make as they are to eat; so simple and relatively inexpensive for the "WOW" factor.

I have a granddaughter who is penguin crazy and I just had to make these for her.  It was easy and they look so dare cute.  Make sure you have a large carrot and I would use a small size spoon to stuff the large olive to make it easier.  They were a big hit!

I haev made these several times, and they are WONDERFUL.  Though time-consuming to prepare, they taste great and look so cute that some people refuse to eat them!  Every time I make them, people rave about them.

EDIT: I entered them into a 2011 cooking contest at our state fair, and won first place in the appetizers and finger foods competition.  Everybody loved them, and the onions and chives cream cheese spread worked great.  Ad don't forget the baby penguins!

I mostly gave it a full 5 stars because they are soooooo cute! My kids loved making them. The cream cheese was a little boring, so next time I make them I think I will add a little bit of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese.

My mom collects penguins, so we are always on the look-out for clever penguins -- these sure fit the bill, and were well worth the effort!  The one change I made was cutting a "v" out of the carrot so the skinny end was inserted into the olive (no splits that way) and it looked like their mouth was open.  Also, I trimmed the points of the front of the feet at a 45-degree angle, making them appear more rounded.  I also cut an actual "v" in the olive, making the cream cheese more obvious with less.  Enjoy!

I was looking for something to liven up the New Years dinner table and found these.  HaHa it sure did.   Impossible not to snicker even as I was putting them together.   I think my 4 yr old grandson spoke for everyone when I put them on the table and he said "what the heck?"  I noticed from the pictures many ppl served them with a cheese ball for an igloo effect.  So I used a molded jellied salad and I felt that fit the bill as well.  Truthfully they didn't all get eaten but were still totally worthwhile just by the sheer delight of their presence!

Big hit at my New Years Eve Party.  Kind of a pain to make, but worth it.  I used veggie cream cheese.  Also, I substituted cheddar cheese (instead of carrots) for the beaks.

These were a "hit" at our gathering of adults.  They are very cute and fun to make. Allow yourself some time to make these.  Making 1/2 of the recipe, I added 2 teaspoons of powdered Ranch Dressing to 4 ounces of cream cheese, which adds a nice flavor.  I used a sturdy plastic zip lock bag for the cream cheese mixture.  Cutting off a small corner allows you to easily squeeze the cream cheese mixture into the penguins body.

Big hit especially at holiday parties.  Allow time as stuffing is a bit time consuming.

These were a hit! I used ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese. This made it taste great! I also used cheddar cheese for the feet. I just sliced little squares and cut out a little notch for the feet. My niece loved to look at them. She didn't like olives, but she ate the feet! Everybody loved them.

I just had to try these for my Christmas eve gathering. They were a blast to make. I mixed garlic salt and onion powder to season the cream cheese and I piped it in to the olive that I had removed a wedge from to accommodate the filling. I also cut the beaks in half to make them thinner so they won't split the head open. I followed another reviewers suggestion on how to make baby penguins and an igloo. I will fine tune the display next year, but these were so easy an adorable. I think I had more than enough cream cheese to make 36 penguins. Too cute.

Let me first say I hate olives.  However, these are sooo darn cute I just couldn't resist taking them to a wine tasting/Christmas party.  They were a great hit.  I did most of them with regular cream cheese and then I added some ranch dressing the cream cheese.  I heated the cheese up slightly to make piping it easier.  Cutting the wedge out of the olive helps.  I also cut another smaller wedge on the opposite side of the beak of the carrot not to split the olive (also cut in a small hole than just a slit).  I cut up cubes of mozz. cheese to make it look like ice blocks.  Super cute!

So much fun and tasty too!  I took the suggestions regarding the flavored cream cheese and added goat cheese for snow.  People were surprised at how great they tasted and they were the talk of the party.  FUN!

These were so easy to make and a huge hit at my son's 1st birthday party. It was a Winter Onederland Theme so all the food had a snowy theme..they looked great with the cubed mozerella igloo and the 3D snowman birthday cake, the 1" snowball cheese truffles, and little round sandwiches with snowman faces...everyone thought our party was professionally catered.

I wish I had read some of the other reviews on this recipe before attempting these... it would have been MUCH easier to trim off extra bits of olive and use frosting methodologies to squeeze cream cheese into the "bodies."  Without those tips, this can be a messy endeavor! :)

Easy to make like all of the other reviewers have stated.  They turned out so cute for my daughter's 4th birthday tea party in July.  I used little umbrella toothpicks that added to the look.  Also very good!

So adorable! A little time consuming but worth the effort. Instead of cream cheese I use an herbed feta cheese spread. Much tastier than doctored up cream cheese. Use a cake decorating bag with a round tip for super easy filling! I float my penguins on a piece of styrafoam cut to look like an ice float...too darn cute!

I made these last night for a potluck at church. I told them they were my guinea pigs for my wedding appetizers! I love penguins and make ceramic penguin wedding cake tops/accessories for other people on my web site so I HAVE to have a penguin theme for MY wedding! I followed other reviewer's advice and used a flavored cream cheese. I used Chive & Onion. I also followed the advice to cut a sliver out of the stomach, instead of a slit, then used a #10 round cake decorating tip on the bag to pipe the cream cheese into the stomach. I think I did something else different but didn't notice until I was looking at the recipe again last night. I didn't cut a slit in the smaller olive to insert the beak, I piped a tiny bit of cream cheese into the olive pit hole, inserted the wedge cut out of the feet (trimmed if needed) and inserted in the olive pit hole. The little bit of cream cheese helped it stay put. Apparently, I have the head on in a different direction to other people but it still looked great! I asked my friends to be honest about the flavored cream cheese with the olives and they all liked it. After I got my routine figured out, they went much faster than I expected. Also, I had many small olives left, just made smaller penguins with "big" heads. I still have plenty of cream cheese left over and I made a lot more than 18 penguins. I used my slicer to cut the carrots, used the cake decorating bag to quickly and neatly do the stomachs.

Desperately wanted to make these for our large family Christmas gathering ( I know, I know, this is late!) but woke up REALLY late and my husband & I have a lot of driving to do.  Long story short, I open the fridge to get milk out for my coffee and POW!!!!  Knock me over w/ a feather!!  Standing as cute as could be are about 50 gorgeous penguins!! My husband was so enamored with the idea, he decided to make them and let me sleep in!  In closing, they were a HUGE HIT!!!!!  Thank you.

Very cute idea. I'll be serving them at my Super Bowl Party tomorrow! I used vegetable flavored "light" cream cheese, and they tasted great (we tried a few). I had some trouble with the beaks; it may have just been the olives themselves. I started searching the can for only firm olives, and it worked better. I put all the beaks in the heads before I did anything else. I put the cream cheese in a baggie, cut off one end, and piped the cheese into the olive, and that worked really well, and did not make a big mess. Once I got the hang of putting the cream cheese in the olive, it went quickly. They are so cute, thanks for sharing this recipe!

They were definitely a hit at this year's Christmas party.  As suggested by others, I cut up little strips of red roasted peppers to make little scarves. Everyone thought they were the cutest little things. Also, since my family is lactose intolerant, I had to subsitute the cream cheese with hummus, but the effect was still the same. Delicious!

Awesome! Easy to make once you get the pattern down. These were the hit of the party. They were even featured in the monthly newsletter as "the cutest food ever!" Worth every minute of making them.I used ice cube trays to transport them. I made them the day before and they stayed fresh.

Thanks for the recipe!  These little guys are c-u-t-e!  I made them for Christmas eve and everyone loved them.  People kept taking pictures of them.  Note that these are very time consuming to make.  Get a friend or family member to help if possible.  I added fresh minced garlic and a little tabasco to flavor them up.  I also added fresh dill on top of the penguin for "hair."  Even with these changes, they still aren't the best tasting appetizer, but they are so adorable that nobody cared.

I made my little March of the Penguins the other night for a Potluck and they were a huge hit! So dang cute, I just couldn't quit looking at them and giggling. I'll definately make them again, but I'll remember others' advice of flavoring the cream cheese and maybe piping it into the olives with a baggie. Loved them!

These are the definition of fabulous. Once you get the hang of it, the penguins are fun to put together. A big hit at Christmas. When I ran out, everyone complained, and when I offered to give them the recipe, my uncle grumbled "I don't want the darn recipe, I want more penguins."

These were adorable and made eveyone smile.  I used veggie cream cheese for a bit more flavor.  I also used colossal olives for the bodies and mediums for the heads and the porportions seemed to work out.

Super cute idea for use all winter long!  Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to make these.  I was rushing to make them as a garnish for a party and found them to be quite time consuming.  I found that using baby carrots worked the best since it is the perfect miniature size needed.  Just cut a thin round slice in two and you have your feet.  Also a pie wedge of one round slice is perfect for the beak.  Might need to use your fingers to work the cream cheese into the large olive.  It's easier to mold and you get a smooth look for the penguin tummy!

Very cute!  I followed the advice of others and got whipped cream cheese.  Also, covered a cheese ball with cream cheese as suggested.  Darling for my Christmas party!  Contrary to other opinions, I didn't think they were bland.  Tasted like olives and cream cheese!

These were cute but labor intensive. They are more for show-not really for eating. I doubt I would make these again.

First made this recipe last summer with great success.  Have made these little fellows several times during the year.  Was made "queen of the kitchen" at one party.  They are very cute and always a hit.

Great recipe!  Had rave reviews at my Christmas party over these.  Placed cherry tomatoes in the center of a plate, the penguins around the tomatoes, and finger sandwiches around the penguins - looked great!

These were sooo cute. Everybody raved about them at our Christmas party. I molded my cheese ball into the shape of an igloo and stood the penguins around it on a festive tray. I knew from the reviews I'd read that most guests would not actually eat them so I only made 8 because they are difficult to make and I used whipped cream cheese as someone suggested.

Everyone at the barbeque I took these to could not get over how cute they were. People took pictures and talked about them but no one ate them! About half of the penquins kept falling over so next time I will try and find the frilly toothpicks as recommended. A real crowd pleaser!

Very cute!!  These were easy to do and looked adorable.  They had an ok taste but there is not much to them.  They looked great on the buffet table though and I got lots of compliments.  Also, if there are any lenux fans out there they will love these!

Very clever. It's a labor of love. They taste fine, but it's not the taste you're after, it's the look! I used frilly toothpicks. I took them to a party and someone said, "That's the first time I've eaten penguin!" HA HA HA

I followed other reviewers comments and added some dry ranch seasoning.  I do not think the ranch was a good addition.  Maybe zesty Italian seasoning would have been better...IDK...it wasn't what I was expecting.

My daughter-in-law made these for the holidays - she positioned them on a cream cheese covered tray in a semi-circle and had them all "staring" at a raw shrimp! It was pretty cute!! I thought they tasted yummy too!

So cute!!  Since everyone said the tasate was a little bland, so I used cranberrie goat cheese - excellent!  The only mistake was buying the cheap jar of roasted peppers cuz the pieces were too small to make a long scarf.  I managed, but tricky.  I also used the veggie peeler to make strips of carrots that worked well for scarves - easier to handle.  For the display I added some pieces from my Christmas village:  kids sledding & trees.  I put it all on a round white stirofoam and covered half of it with foil cut in a half-circle to look like an ice rink.  Igloo was a nice touch too.

My family really loved the way these looked.  I am not a very big fan of black olives but my guests enjoyed them.  I think changing the cream cheese to something with flavor would have made them a little better.

I used seasoned cream cheese, as recommended by other reviewers.  They were very cute and well-liked by my coworkers at the company Christmas party.  My boyfriend was suitably impressed, too.

These were a hit at my New Year's Eve Party!  I found using a styrofoam plate turned upside down worked great to hold them in place since you could simply push the tooth pick into the plate.  An added bonus, the white plate looks like snow!

Totally cute!!! A huge hit with family gatherings, though very time consuming. I would recommend saving room in the fridge and making a ton the day before your gathering.  
I made for 12 people... and needed 3x's the recipe!

Sooo cuuute!!! I made them for my best friend's baby's 1st birthday party and got so many compliments! The kids and the adults loved them! I like time consuming recipes so I had fun making the little penguins. Next time I'll make more because they were such a hit! Also, LOVE all of the pictures! Some people are so creative!

This is a little bit humorous. LOL! When I made this, the result looked like a toy. My friend saw me eating this and she marveled because she thought that I'm crazy. She thought I'm eating a stuff toy and I just laughed. LOL! Until now, I'M STILL LAUGHING. ^^
With all these years of browsing recipes at gourmandia.com, I never found any recipe that is as humorous as this one. Very creative...

I made these for a NYE party and they were a huge hit! I added a ranch dip packet as suggested by other reviewers to add flavor, and everyone loved them! Even my dad couldn't stop talking about them, which was a shock to me. I will definitely want to do these again!

Gives "don't eat the penguins" new meaning.  They're cool, fun to make, great conversation starters, kids of any age love them... but by the time they've been assembled they've been handled way too many times to be a food item.  Just saying...

These are adorable but you need to use large olives for the head.  The small ones might be cute but very hard to put the beak in.

Very easy to make. You don't really need two sizes of olives. The cream cheese you stuff into the bottom one naturally makes it appear fatter. Unfortunately, no one at the party liked olives so they just sat there. 

Great recipe if you love olives.

Yum, I put about half a pouch of a Hidden Valley Dips mix in the creamcheese. I used baby carrots only because thats all I had. I DO NOT reccomend this!

These make me laugh when I make them.  I add a little ranch dip powder to the cream cheese for a little extra flavor.

So cute, I got so many compliments on these little penguins. It was worth it for the big holiday dinner at my house (and Grandmother's 90th birthday week); but it will take a special occassion for me to spend the time to make these cute little penguins.

These little guys take awhile to make, but they're so worth the time. I used onion/chive cream cheese as others suggested. The olives are easier to fill if you let the cream cheese soften about an hour first. Five stars and highly recommended!

Be sure to get the largest olives you can find.  I used a large syringe to inject the cream cheese into the olives, but m y kids and I had a blast with them.

These penguins are just too cute!  Like other reviewers suggested, I jazzed up the cream cheese with a little garlic powder.  I also used thicker slices of carrots for the feet, and then I cut a bunch of beaks out of thinner slices of carrots.  That way the penguins are stable, but I did not break the olives when trying to insert the beaks in the heads.

I made these for a housewarming party. I thought it would be fun and unique, considering we're coming into the winter season here in WI. I used some ranch seasoning with my cream cheese for flavor. And little mozzarella cubes for ice blocks.  I did want to point out that there are no igloos in the antarctic where penguins live.. and no penguins in the arctic where igloos are found. ...Just a note from a part-time Alaskan.

I would give these 5 stars or even 10 for presentation but 1 minus in taste. These are absolutely adorable and every one loves looking at them but not eating them. I tried the Onion/Chives cream cheese and even added a bit of garlic salt but still very bland. A pain to make but if your goal is to bring smiles to people faces then this is for you

These are so cute! My family loved them! Its a lot of prep and detail work, but its worth it! I highly recommend using a pastry bag because when I used a sandwich bag, the bag got a blow out! I made scarfs out of jarred roasted red peppers cut into very thin strips. I also flavored the cream cheese with dry ranch dressing as suggested by others. These are so cute that you hate to eat them! They do taste good though! Tastes just like penguin!

These are a GRREAT garnish, But don't take the time to do alot of them.  I made them for a shower and was privy to a remark by someone there,-  "Someone with far too much time on their hands made these".  She was right!!!!! Just do a few to decorate your plate, it took me forever to do a whole can.  I know I'll do just a few next time!!

Took the tips from others and added some dry spices to the cream cheese.Also, I cut a "section" out of the larger olive to expose the cream cheese better. I cut the carrot pieces thinner for easier insertion into the olive and this worked much better. I have made these twice and will make again even though they are VERY time consuming. The raves are certainly worth it and they taste pretty good too. Besides, the humor they brought me was priceless!I just couldn't keep from opening the refridgerator door and giggling!!!!

This recipe turns out really great and looks adorable on a platter.  I didn't follow instructions exactly due to other reviews.  I did cut a slit out of the large olives with made putting the cream cheese in a breeze.  I only used 1/2 block of cream cheese because I could tell by looking at the olives they wouldn't take that much.  Some reviews said plain cream cheese was bland so my remedy was to add 1t dry ranch dressing to 1/2 package cream cheese and I also added 1 green onion finely chopped.  We thought this was flavorful bit didn't overpower the olives.  I will definately make again with those changes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was fun and easy to make.  I used vegetable flavored cream cheese to give it a little something extra.  I shared this idea with many people over the holidays so they could add something special to their veggie trays.

The kids loved them so much they wouldn't eat them because they were too cute!!! Really adorable! We saved a few for the kids and the adults ate the rest! Use a piping bag to fill the body - makes them very easy to make.  Also, turn a small bowl upside down and cover with cream chees to make an igloo! Fun, fun, fun!!!

I made these for Xmas snacks and they went over fabulously! I was a bit scared cause I already had a long list of food to prepare but these went together quick and without to many disasters. I did add a pouch of lipton soup mix to 2 boxes cream cheese (the left over dip was great on fritos!) and I made the filling the night before for the flavor to set in. They were great...even to those who didnt really like black olives...a must have snack even if you dont build them into penguins!

These are adorable!  I added pimento 'ties', and cut cheddar blocks to make the beginning of an igloo.  Then I positioned the penguins around the igloo.  Found I had to make the carrot 'feet' a little thicker to ensure they'd stand without falling.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Oh my gosh were these a hit!!!  We had great fun with these. Everyone thought they were a riot. One of the guys even had us all in stitches when he ate one and was acting like it was trying to get out of his mouth! Like I said, we had a lot of fun with these penguins :-)

absolutely adorable!  I made these to use by the place settings at a dinner party.  People could not stop talking about them.  I used garden veggie cream cheese and a ziplock bag to pipe it into the olives.  Very easy to make with an adorable result.

I had great fun making these guys. Cute, easy and fun to make. I don't like olives so I didn't eat one; I mainly made these for their cuteness and adding fun to a Christmas party! Thanks so much for this great idea. I certainly will make again.

I made these last night and took them to a party.  People couldn't get over them!  I made another batch today... about 50.  Today I used a block of cream cheese and about 8 oz. of blue cheese.  YUM.  Last night I used 1/2 feta.  I like the blue better.  I also cut the carrot a little thicker on the bottom so they don't fall over.  Definately a keeper.

I made these for my "For the Birds" themed Christmas party.  Everyone raved about how cute they were.  I filled the large olive with an icing bag. I used a paring knife to cut a beak sized wedge out of the small olive instead of just a slit.  It took a few seconds longer, but it worked really well.

These were too much work for a not so tasty appetizer.  As cute as they were, the combination of cream cheese, olives and carrots just didn't taste very good.

These were great...everyone was impressed.  I added feta cheese and garlic salt to the cream cheese as a few reviews said they were a little bland as is. Got tons of compliments and they went fast.  Will make again.

Super cute idea! I made these superbowl Sunday for me, my hubby and my boys...16 & 17 & even they thought these were cool! I think I stuffed too much cream cheese into the belly so next time I will use a tad less.Seemed to be overbearing but my bad.I didnt have tooth picks so i used shredded carrots that I had on hand. My hubbys mom came over while I was making them and she was tickled by them. She had to take one with here to show her Aunt who was just talking about that "penguin movie"!

Absolutely precious!!!  
A bit messy to make, but well worth it.  I used 1.5 containers of low fat cream cheese and mixed it with a package of herb and garlic salad dressing seasoning.  The assembly was super easy, except for the noses - I had trouble getting small enough triangles that weren't too thick to break open the face.

Very high cute factor here!  I made them for my son's school project.  Half ate, half didn't.  They were a bit time consuming, but perfect for his penguin themed book report.

I had forgotten about this great recipe.  Very labor intensive, but worth it -- they were a big hit at my party.  I would use flavored cream cheese next time for a little more taste.  I used the whipped cream cheese and it worked fine.  Also, cut the beaks thin or the olives will split.

Loved this charming and edible accent to our vegetable tray. It was very easy to make (did an assembly line, making all the feet first, then the heads with beaks and then the bodies) and had them "strutting" across the vegetable tray.  They got more attention than our other holiday recipes and tasted great.  Thank you!

I made these last year for my Christmas and they were a hit. I think people should think of these as an adorable garnish. I didn't think they were bland, they just are cream cheese and olives. I also used the igloo idea. They are a lil' time consuming, so make sure you give yourself extra time. I stuffed the olives with the cream cheese in the morning and put them together an hour before the party b/c I was worried about the carrots drying out.

I made this for Memorial Day party.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I used cream cheese with chives instead of plain to give more flavor and piped in a plastic storage bag.  I also heard that someone at the party put one of these penguins on a white plate and took a picture.  Other reviews stated that no one really ate them, they were gobbled up were I was at.

These were a big hit at the Christmas Eve party - everyone thought they were so cute, and they were.  I also used the cheese ball igloo idea, which added a lot, I think.  They were kind of a lot of work, but worth it for the visual appeal.  I liked the way they tasted - didn't add anything to the cream cheese.

My husband & I made these for Thanksgiving and we couldn't stop laughing while making them because they were sooooo cute!  I made them to go with my dried beef & cream cheese "igloo" and they were a huge hit with my family.  Everyone wanted to know how to make them and a couple people took one home so they could copy them.  They are definitely a funny conversation piece.  I still giggle just thinking about them!

These are really cute and nice to use to decorate your table.  However, they are not a gourmet delight!  I have tried making them stuffed with Allouette to give them additional flavor.  I like this better than the plain cream cheese.

One of my nieces called to say that it was her turn to bring a treat to her third grade class. Get this, she wanted these penguins because I had set them around on a cheeseball plate Christmas Eve. I didn't think the kids had even noticed them. I tried to talk her out of it saying they weren't that tastey, and I didn't think the other kids would eat them. She dug her feet in, and tomorrow she's taking them to class. It was a riot helping her with them. The end product is just tooo sweet looking, but they're not much on flavor. My niece gave them five stars just 'cuz they're tooo cute. Thanks for not only providing instructions for this darling little critter, but for giving me something fun to do with my niece.

These were absolutely adorable.  Took them to an office party & everyone went crazy over them.  They are so cute!  Don't make them if you want something that will knock your tastebuds off though.  I think most people took one because they were so cute, not necessarily to eat.  Would make again just for the novelty appeal.  Time consuming, but not hard to make.

I made these for a New Year's Eve Party and they were a hit.  I'm not sure if anyone mentioned it, but these are real easy to make if you put the cream cheese in a pastry bag, use a fairly small tip and sqeeze!  Thanks for another great recipe.

I was so proud to serve these at a recent get-together.  Usually when something looks cute or attractive, the taste suffers.  But not in this case.  Everyone loved them.  Even the kids!  I also made a cheese ball "igloo" and placed the penguins around it.  Too cute!  Well worth the effort in putting them together. I also made a batch using the flavored whipped cream cheese.  Personally, the plain was much better.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This is a great recipe! It was a huge hit at the party, and they are still talking about it, now I'm sorry I didn't make more penguins! I used a round piece of 1/4" foam, covered w/white tissue paper & covered that w/coconut. The penguins were stable & it was very easy to transport. It was a little time consuming, but well worth it. Thanks for sharing this recipe - I'm make it again.

Worth the work! Yes they were a little time consuming but everyone loved them, not just because they were so tasty, but because they added such a pop to the table of party food! Used whipped chive cream cheese for flavor "piping" it in with a sandwich bag with the corned cut out. Had to cut out the slice for the "tuxedo". Didn't bother with cutting out the wedge for the feet as it made no difference. Initially tried to make the scarf as pictured but it was ridiculously hard so I just cut skinny triangles out of the jarred red bell peppers that were skewered below the head. Might try scarves of ham next time? Every single one was gobbled up early on!

What a riot making these.  I used Herb and garlic cream cheese mixed with a veggie cream cheese I had left over. Definitely need 2 piping bags unless you have help making these. They are a three handed job. Try to hold the head and pipe in cream cheese can be done but not easy.  The 'v' you cut out of the carrot cannot be used as the beak-too big-use a paring knife and take a sliver off it for the beak.slips into the cut end of the olive perfectly. Took the advice of another reviewer and cut a small 'v' in the body of the penguin to get more cream cheese piped in. If doing this alone I would suggest having 2 piping bags - one in the fridge getting cold and the other in use. Cream cheese wants to fall out if getting too warm. I blew my friends away because they know I don't have a domestic bone in my body so to show up at Christmas with my buddies-they just shook their heads.  I wanted to so a scenery of igloo, ice floats etc but ran out of time. In future i would do the scenery the week before so not to get caught short water ice floats part of scenery not the igloo. Oh and a paring blade like what you use to peel potatoes or carrots makes lovely long scarfs at no cost since you already have the carrots. To make sure they are nice and flexible do them as thin as you can and at the last minute or they get brittle and crack -even if you keep them in water. Well worth the looks on peoples faces when they see them. Thanks for the recipe and the great ideas for scenery.

My daughter-in-law made these, stood them all up in a semi-circle on a plate coated with cream cheese. We put a shrimp on the plate and it looked like they were all "staring" at it!  It was cute and yummy too!

These little guys are so darned cute! I added onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt to the cream cheese and piped it in with a baggie. I made the tiny mistake of buying Colossal olives, and the toothpick barely made it through the plump penguins! So stick to the Jumbos.

I found that the thinner you slice your carrots, the easier the "beak" fits into the slit on the head.

Oh, what a yummy mouthful!

Very cute, I couldn't resist but putzy to make. I like putzy but I think it took longer than 35 min. The hardest thing to make were the scarves. I used a jar of roasted bell peppers. The strips need to be cut very thin.

We made these this past Thanksgiving and we loved them! I added Hidden Valley Ranch dressing powder to the cream cheese to add some flavor,just sprinkled in to taste and we used roasted red pepper strips for the scarves. I had told my nieces I was bringing some super cute food and I did. My family loved them and they were adorable. Thanks

Fun and cute appetizer.  I did add some seasoning like others had suggested but really, it's 2 olives and cream cheese...the charm is in the penguin.  One question - who looks at 2 olives and sees a penguin?  That kind of imagination puts me in awe!

I do make one change. I add shredded cheddar to the cream cheese before rolling into little balls

So cute! I made these for a work party, along with an igloo shaped cheese ball, two years ago and people are STILL talking about them :0) Helpful tip: Use a pastry bag (or a zip lock bag with one corner cut off) to pipe in the cream cheese filling. It'll be way easier and much less messy than trying to spoon it in!

These are worth making just for the conversation piece and the giggles from the kids! I will use flavored cream cheese next time, plain cream cheese is just too bland. For assembly: I cut the feet and beaks in advance, and piped the cream cheese into the bodies. Then my kids, 13 and 10, assembled the penguin. For a fun winter party idea, we served with a cheese ball recipe that we rolled into 3 different size balls and assembled to look like a snowman. Use whole peppercorns to make the eyes, smile, and buttons, and a baby carrot finely whittled down for the nose.

These are so darn cute as a garnish, everyone adored them. I found them time consuming and would have given myself more time. I made 6 only and did find the cream cheese difficult to work with, keeping them tidy, but cute as heck! Tasty too.

Had my daughter make this for family Christmas party. It was a huge hit even the members that hate black olives at least said they were adorable! Used chive and onion cream cheese to fill them. But nobody ate them. Ended up throwing an entire platter of them away. Cute but a waste of money for my family.

If I could give 5 stars on the idea/creativeness alone along with the visual appeal, it would definitely earn it. However, it is a very tedious process. And although the instructions were great, I'm not sure it was worth it. I received lots of great comments at the party I served it at, it just took a lot longer to accomplish. Also, it's hard to not mess up the "tuxedos" of the penguins w/cream cheese on the sides of the olive. But overall, great idea!

These are great to bring to a party!  I put them on a platter covered with coconut .  I made them a few years ago, and made the mistake of making them the night ahead !  Dont do that !  I'm sure everyone knows, you'll end up with wrinkly dried up penguins!  (wish I did back then!)

I am crazy about Penguins so I just had to try this recipe.  My granddaughter and I put them together at Christmas.  True, it was time-consuming but worth the time spent together.  Shortly after I finished I looked on the counter and found the scene in the photo.  I guess Hippo's have to eat, too!

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit! Very tasty too. I added a little ranch dressing and garlic powder to give the cream cheese more flavor. Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I also cut a little slit out of the olive to make more room for the cream cheese center. If I cut the middle without taking a chunk out, the olives broke when I stuffed in the cream cheese. I also used a ziploc bag with a hole cut out of one tip to pipe in the cream cheese. Very easy!

I had to try these, they are so cute! They were a hit at our New Years party. They are a bit labor intensive but worth it for the reaction you will get. I used onion chive cream cheese for the added flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

These are incredible!  I just made them for a New Year's Eve party tonight.  I did use chive and onion cream cheese. I cut a slice out of the jumbo olives, and piped the cheese in with a baggie with the tip cut. I also put the toothpick thru the medium olive, hole facing forward, then thru the body, then into the carrot.  Then, I placed the beak.  I made them in no time!  I can't wait to go to the party!  They are adorable!

These taste exactly how you'd think they taste, so good enough but nothing amazing.  However they get 5 stars because of the reaction they got!  Everyone at my party loved them.  I giggled the whole time while making them, very cute.  Might consider using something fancier than cream cheese like Alouette cheese next time for some flavor.

This was fun to make.  My kids helped created the winter scene.  I bought the foam at walmart along with a 3 pack of disposable foil pizza pans and blue construction paper (it was impossible to find blue saranwrap).  I also bought various size foam balls and my kids made a snow man for each tray.    Was it the best appetizer I have ever eaten? Well no, after all it is just olives and cream cheese.    That being said this was the talk of the party and several people took pictures which is why I am giving it a 5.  Warning, for a while no one ate it because they thought it was a center piece:-)

I made these for my Christmas party last year and people are still raving about them...adorable and tasty.  Do use flavored cream cheese or add dry ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. Do pipe the cream into the centers Do make heads ahead of time and let them soak in the brine till you're ready to assemble. Saves last minute stress Do use pre-cut sliced carrots that you can buy in a bag ...saves lots of time.

Cute as can be  -  I had a hard time trying to stuff them and keeping the olive clean was a challenge - This was more of an acquired taste and my guest did not enjoy them.

These little guys were adorable and made a smash at my family Christmas.  For ease of getting the cream cheese into the olives, I warmed the cream cheese until soft, then transferred it to a baggie and piped it in. It made the stuffing process faster and much cleaner. Everyone thought these were adorable, and they tasted good too!

These were ok but I don't much care for black olives. It was pretty difficult to get the cream cheese into the jumbo olives but the end result was cute and unique. I don't know if there is even such a thing as jumbo green olives but I might try those instead.

These were super cute and easy to make! I used cheddar cheese for the feet (instead of carrots) and then used pimentos for the beaks. Also, I flavored my cream cheese with a bit of ranch dressing powder.

So cute, I was hesitant in eating one.. I thought I heard one holler as I swallowed!  Hahaha!

Great idea on the cream cheese with chives flavor.  My mom used to do something very similar with kumquats at Christmas.  She called them fairy's.  Scoop out the pulp and use only the kumquat shell.  I think she used carrots finely diced for the eyes - they were adorable as a child and my mother would laugh while making them!  Great memories.

These are sooooo cute!  They took forever to make!!!  I don't have any children (8-12), but this would be a great hands-on project for a holiday themed party.  I made sure that I piped in the cream cheese mixture using a bag. I couldn't find the pimentos for the scarves, but they were still cute.

I just realized I have never rated/reviewed this recipe!  I first made these little guys for my brother-in-law's birthday party...he loves penguins.  Everyone thought they were so cute.  I have made them several times since then and taken them to potlucks, picnics, and other gatherings.  I never go home with leftovers!

These are so cool. I used an orange cheddar cheese instead of carrot for the feet and beak. also took the suggestion of using a thin sheet of craft styrofoam to anchor them in. You can print out anything like an ocean scene or beach scene and place on styro and then place plastic over the scenery. Very nice presentation. Thanks for the great idea!

They are time consuming, but SO worth it. They will be the life of any party! I made them one year when I hosted Christmas Eve and everyone thought they were amazing. Not only are they darn cute but they are actually really yummy! I used an herb cream cheese to add a bit more flavor. I recommend turning their heads in different directions for presentation. It brings them to life!

These are so cute! I resized the recipe to make 50 penguins and it called for 2 3/4 eight ounce cream cheeses. We didn't even use half of it! We used jumbo olives as the recipe stated but in the future I think we'd do colossal. The medium are perfect for the heads. 
The beaks are truly the most difficult part. A small knife will work good to cut out a small section for the beak to fit in. As a previous reviewer suggested, the thinner the beaks the better. I ruined quite a few "heads" by trying to shove big beaks in there!
We're serving these tomorrow at a Christmas party and I think they are going to be a big hit. Thanks for posting such a creative recipe!

Huge hit! For the filling I used softened whipped cream cheese - the onion & garlic flavored type, and blended it with some softened goat cheese for extra flavor. Piped with a ziploc bag, definitely read other reviews for tips first to make this easy! Everyone loved these!

These were really cute! More for presentation than they were for eating however, they didn't exactly taste very good -I wasn't fond of the whole cream cheese stuffed olives idea- and were not worth the time and effort it took, especially reading after all of those star reviews. Adorable presentation though.

These were fun to make. I think I might try flavored cream cheese today when I make them but I loved the plain cream cheese too. Softening the cream cheese and piping it in with a pastry bag worked great. I cut the noses a little thinner so they'd go in easier. WHEN THE PENGUINS ARRIVED AT THE DINNER PARTY THEY WERE A HUGE HIT!! And, they all got eaten after everyone had gotten over the cuteness of them! A couple were taken home so that they could be shown to other people. These guys are definitey worth the effort.

What a cute appetizer!  I made these last weekend for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  I used fat-free cream cheese and I put it in the microwave to soften it and then I mixed it with my kitchenaid and added some garlic and wine seasoning from The Melting Pot, and a little white pepper.  I put the cream cheese in a disposable decorators' bag with a large round tip and filled the olives.  this made it so easy.  The only problem I had was I cut some of the carrots for the feet too thin, and the penguins would fall over, so I had to cut thicker pieces.  They were cute and tasted really good, too!  It was a little time consuming, but worth the time and effort to have such a cute and tasty appetizer to serve.

These were way cute.  But-what a time consuming process.  It took forever to make them, everyone said they were way cute-nobody ate them.  Can't blame them they weren't all that tasty.  Cute as place settings but not for eating

This appetizer is more for looks than taste, but certainly worth the effort.  Everyone loved them!

I made these for a retirement party and they where the hit of the party.  Used many helful tips (precut slits for nose, cut a small slice from big olive so cream cheese shows thru more, used chive flavored whipped cream cheese).  I've already passed the recipe to 3 people!

My five year old grandson helped make these, so I am not quite sure about people who have trouble putting them together. Our family loves these. We had a great time making them and an even better time eating them.

I made these for a baby shower everyone thought they were great! I followed a few tips from other reviews-I used flavored cream cheese and took a little slice out of the big olives before I filled them. I have a feeling I'll be asked to make these again...

These are the cutest things ever, I showed the pictures to a friend of mine the day before my snow party and she showed up with them, everyone raved about how cute they were, and about half of them got eaten. Thank you for such a cute idea :)

These penguins were a hit at the New Year's Eve party I made them for.  I made them at the party (which avoided some of the portability mishaps), and I used whipped cream cheese and a pastry bag and tip which made production much easier.  I also flavored the cream cheese with some grated sweet onion (I didn't add salt b/c olives are already salted).  

For faster assembly, I recommend batching activities, i.e. slice all the olives, cut the carrot slices, cut the wedges out of the carrot slices, before putting a penguin together.  Then you can make an assembly line a la Ford Motor Company and put your little penguins together!  The effort is so worth the results.

I made an igloo and an iceberg with the ocean out of white chocolate to display my penguins.  (please see the recipe photos).

I also made a seperate dish of just the cheese stuffed olives because I was fairly certain nobody would want to eat the penguins.  I was right, nobody did want to eat the penguins!  But they were able to enjoy the olives anyway.  I followed other's suggestions and used an herb and garlic cheese for the filling and the taste was very complimentary.

I have a two year old that just saw the movie "Happy Feet" so she's in love with penguins right now...she LOVES cream cheese and she LOVES olives, so this was the perfect thing for her!  They are so easy we made a family project out of it and even the 2 year old could help!  They disapeared at our Christmas party...next time, we'll make even more!

Very cute and easy, just a little messy to put together. I used a decorating gun to pipe the cream cheese (I used alouette garlic and herb spread) into the olive. Tasted great, but were almost too cute to eat! Took me less than 30 minutes to assemble all the little guys. I recommend drying the olives before assembly, however.

I have just made these for a party at work tomorrow. I modified the cream cheese as have some others, but added shredded crab along with a package of ranch dressing mix to ramp up the flavor. I like it, remains to be seen if others do.  They are sooo cute.

These were so cute & fun to make. I cut the carrots a little thicker to help the penguins stand up. I also used flavored cream cheese, as other reviews had suggested, and they tasted yummy. Everyone loved them and had a good laugh!

So cute and easy! I used onion and chive cream cheese, great taste. Also did as other reviewers - used ziplock lunch bag and cut bottom corner to pipe it in - much quicker. Also cut out a little more of belly so cream cheese showed more.

We really enjoyed making these! Very cute!The olive heads were sort of wet and they tended to slip of the body so I recommend drying them.Dry wings too.We used regular cream cheese but would probably do flavored next time. Cute idea!

These are always a hit! I made them for the first time a few years ago after seeing the recipe
on the cover of either good housekeeping or womens world, can't remember which... they always go well with the cheeseball igloo...everyone wants to take pictures of them instead of eat them!

These were a hit - I used herbed cream cheese.  The taste wasn't the best, but their cuteness made up for it!  People ended up taking them home at the end of the night.

It was fun making them and getting all the compliments, but the taste just was too plain. I thought it was more for decorations. If I make it again, I will add some spices to the cream cheese or something else to the recipe for additional taste.

These were adorable!  Looked just like the  picture and was definitely noticed at the party!  Everyone thought that they took SO long to make!  Not hard at all!  Next time I will surely use large olives rather then small (all I had in cupboard) for both the body and the head...

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! Not nearly as difficult to make as I had anticipated. They truly are almost too darn cute to eat! If you have the time (and time truly is the factor, not difficulty) to make these, DO IT! They are FUN to make and just as much fun to watch everyone else enjoy! Will definately make these again! I used Garden Vegetable Cream Cheese for enhanced flavor.

What a fun recipe!  Following the suggestion of several others, I used a vegetable herb cream cheese for added flavor.  They are not hard to make, just time-consuming, but the effort was well worth it because my guests raved about how cute they were (and they tasted good, too).

Very cute, and fairly easy.  Too hard for my kids to do well, but older kids could manage.  They were so cute no one at the gathering wanted to eat them.  But a few were curious and dug in, and thought they were pretty good.  They got alot of attention as a cute conversation piece.  Will make again!

There's no arguing with how adorable these are.  I wasn't overly thrilled with the taste though...of course, I'm not a big fan of olives to begin with.  They aren't difficult to assemble and I do plan to make these again, mainly as a garnish!

These were such a hit.  I made just a few of them to see if a klutz can do this, and I could!  They weren't too difficult at all.  I put some whipped cream cheese in a baggie and "massaged" it for a few minutes to make it even more pliable and it was easy to fill the large olives.  I found that if you cut the feet from the larger (wider)  part of the carrot it makes the penguins stand up better and gives them an even sillier appearance!  Don't make these too early beforehand as mine got a little wrinkly and dried out after a night in the fridge.  Even still, everyone at our Christmas party got a kick out of them and all the new digital camera owners took a picture or two!

These were darling. I made a double batch but like everyone else said they do take a little time so don't try to put them together at the last minute. If you are transporting them to a party I found they all fell down like dominoes. A little dab of cream cheese on the bottom of their feet helped this. If you line the tray with plastic wrap it's not too messy. I personally found them to be very tasty and mine all got scarfed up.(Ha Ha!)

The penguins are a bit difficult to make in that it is hard to fill the olives bellies with the cheese.  I used a pastry bag and a whipped cream cheese and that made it a bit easier.  Since I made a lot of them, I ended up just using the holes instead of cutting slits - they looked fine that way too.  I also made a cheeseball to go with it and shaped it like an igloo.  I placed the igloo on foil so it looked like ice and placed the penguins all around the igloo.  It was quite festive and got many good reviews!

Really great if you love olives! They were cute and tasty. I think I will rinse my black olives first next time to get rid of some of the briny taste.

These are the cutest bird appetizers you will ever see!  I made them for a Christmas party and everyone commented on them. People didn't seem to want to eat them, but then they did.   One woman even took some home to copy.  My husband really thought they were great and even helped arrange them around the cheese ball igloo on the platter.  They are a little time consuming, so plan ahead, the beaks were the hardest part, but then you get used to them.  I used whipped cream cheese and piped it into the olive with a pastry tube, which worked great.  I plan on making them for a dinner party coming up, and will certainly have them around for Christmas again.  Fun!

These were yummy & the guests at our dinner party really were amused by them.  One tip for you if you're going to make them: use a pastry bag to insert the cream cheese.  If you don't have one, put the cream cheese in a ziploc bag & cut one of the corners.

My sister and I just tested this recipe for Thanksgiving. It's great! So quick and easy, even the older kids can help! FYI, we used the same size olives for head and body and bought carrots pre-sliced into "pennies". It doesn't get easier than that! We also stuffed the heads with chive flavored cheese....yummmm! My 2 year old is scarfing them right now!!!

I saw a similar recipe somewhere else and made them.  They are time consuming, but fun to make. I used Mozzarella balls instead of the cream cheese and cut deli ham into long thin strips to make 'scarves'.  No one at my family get together wanted to eat them because "they look to cute to eat" so I took them to work  next day and everyone LOVED them! (those folks are not afraid of good looking food.)

This is so cute and economical to make. Made them on Christmas Eve and had so much fun assembling them! 
     We used the onion & chive flavored cream cheese and shaved carrot strips for the scarves.
      I had a spare straw from a juice box and cut out buttons for the front.from shaving the bottoms of the jumbo olives.
     What a great idea! Worth the effort to make.
Thank you!

I have made these for Christmas for the last few years. My two oldest grandchildren love olives and were excited the first time I made them. Now they request them. I made them for my youngest granddaughter's first birthday party that was penguin themed. Her birthday is December 28th, so they were well received. I didn't change a thing, but I did use a piping bag to fill the larger olives with the cream cheese. Will definitely make these for years to come. Well worth the extra effort just to see peoples faces when they see them and hear them tell me how brilliantly creative I am.

These were so fun and gave me a chuckle every time I looked at them! I rinsed the canned olives, then soaked in balsamic vinegar to try and get the "tinny" flavor off, which helped a little. Other tips: mixed cream cheese and soft goat cheese together, added a little dry ranch to the cheese mix, used the tip of a star cookie cutter to cut out the carrot slices (easy and uniform) and used a pastry bag and large tip to pipe the cheese filling into the olives.

Definately the cutest thing I have ever made. Did use onion/chive cream cheese for the penguins to give it some flavor. Other than that it was easy to make but took a lot longer than I expected to put together. 

Placing the cream cheese in a ziplock bag made it easier to fill the olives since all I had to do was pipe it into the olive. Would make again.

Penguins were a huge hit at the holiday party! I used the whipped cream cheese and a Ziploc bag as others had described to fill the olives. Make sure you get the biggest olives you possibly can for the torso.

I made these for Christmas dinner.  It was really easy.  I couldn't do the pimiento scarves because in the brand I tried to use, the pieces were all too short.  For those who say it's tasteless - if you love olives, they are great; you don't need to worry about adding a lot of flavors to the cream cheese.

This really is the cutest/funniest horderve I have ever made!  They are easy to make after the prep, and come together just perfect!  The roasted red pepper scarf is cute, but a pain in the butt.  They look fine without.

I can only rate this recipe on the look and preparation, since I hate black olives, carrots and pimentos!  I just have a couple of ideas for making them easier to assemble.  I cut a skinny wedge out of the front, as others have suggested, rather than a slit.  Make sure your olives are intact, with no weak spots or tears before using.  Use a sharp paring knife to cut, making sure that you don't cut any further than one side.  It was easiest for me to use my finger to stuff the cream cheese and clean up the outside.  I just grabbed a glob of softened cream cheese on my fingertip and stuffed it in.  Then ran my finger under warm water and used my wet finger to clean off any cream cheese on the olive.  They look cuter if you slightly overstuff them, giving them a more rounded chest.  And you can use your moistened finger to smooth it out.  The biggest problem I had was trying to make scarves out of pimentos.  My slices were all mushy and I had quite a time finding one long enough to use, or to make them stick.

Wow...this got a great reception from a group of picky eaters! And let's face it, they are totally adorable! We added someone's idea of a cheese ball covered in the cream cheese as an igloo and we did use whipped and flavored cream cheese. I think otherwise it would be sorta bland. Next time (tomorrow!) I'll substitute jarred red & green peppers for the scarves. The pimentos we bought were too skimpy and wouldn't stay in place.

This is similar to a recipe I have been using for quite some time except the recipe I followed called for horseradish mixed with the cream cheese. I would make ones with and one without horseradish and use different colored frilly tooth picks to tell the difference. If you put the cream cheese mixture into  sandwich bag and cut a corner out it makes it easier to fill the body of the penguin. They are time consuming but always a hit when I take them.

These are so fun.  Easy to make and the kids adore them.   I have now made them twice and they were a hit both times.  I used roasted red peppers for the scarves.  Make sure that you cut them super thin so that they fit around the neck.

I made them for a party yesterday and they were the hit of the day. Our hockey team is The Penguins, so several people wanted the recipe and directions. I did add some garlic and onion powders to make them taste better since some here thought they were tasteless.I made the cheese into tiny balls and put them in the freezer for a half hour to make it easier to manage. It is a mess to deal with the room temp cheese, so freezing helps to make it easier.

These are just brilliant!
I originally just made them because they looked so funny, but everybody loved the mixture of tastes as well!
Using olives of the same size works just as well, really. Just don't do what I did the first time I made them and buy olives with stones - it's really fiddly and takes ages to get out the stones in a way that leaves the olives intact enough to be transformed into penguins!
(Cute and cuddly, boys, cute and cuddly!)

As far as being adorable, these were the hit of my NYE party. The problem is, they aren't the best tasting things. Either way, I'll make them again just because of the giggles it brought. It only took me 30 minutes to make and I followed many of the suggestions in the reviews. For anyone who complains about it being so time consuming, you're doing something wrong. I whipped through them pretty fast.

I wish I had read all the reviews before I attempted these; there are some great hints.  They are sooo cute and were a smash hit.  I did not buy the largest olives,colossal; I bought large like it said.  Next time I will use the largest available!  Therefore trimming the carrot for the nose and the pepper for the scarves were tedious.   I used good seasons dry spicy Italian dressing in the cream cheese for seasoning then used the left over as a veggie dip.  But the finished product was cute as heck and went over well.  People agreed to take them home but would not eat them!

I tried this for a Christmas finger food event (definitely would work for any winter event).  Although it was a little tedious to put it all together, it was relatively easy (my grandson helped me).  I think that the cream cheese was bland by itself and needed a little zip.  I can't decide if just some onion and garlic powder would have been enough, or possibly some Spice Islands Beau Monde seasoning would have made it a little more tasty.  I wanted to maintain the white coloring of the cream cheese so maybe a flavored whipped cream cheese would have also worked.  Definitely would do it again.

This was a HIT at my New Years party!!!  The only bad thing was that nobody wanted to eat them because they were "too cute".  Thanks for posting!

Cute, but tasted terrible.  These definitely got people laughing at my New Year's Eve party.  I even used flavored cream cheese.  I probably won't make them again, they took too much effort.

These were great. They're a perfect appetizer. I made them for new years eve and they disappeared. I made little puffins with what was left of my small black olives and cream cheese. I pushed the cream cheese into the large pit hole in the olives, stacked two olives on top of each other, cream cheese sides both facing the front. I then put the carrot beaks sideways into the cream cheese. It really resembles a puffin! My family loved them because we all used to live in Anchorage. They reminded us of home.

Love the penguins! My 11 yr old daughter and I just made these for our New Years Eve party! They turned out great! We added a little ranch dip mix to the cream cheese to give it some flavor...turned out great! Can't wait to serve them tonight!

Thought they were novel.  Wasn't as much of a kid pleasure as I had hoped, but were fun to do and adults enjoyed them.  Would probably do as a decoration idea rather than appetizer next time.

These were not as difficult to make as I thought they would be!! They did take a while, but everybody loved them! I used garden veggie cream cheese instead of plain and they still looked good.

I had my daughters ages 10 and 12 make these. We used a cake decoration tube to fill. Also used chive and onion cream cheese.Using fancy toothpicks with colored tops made them look better. I cannot count the compliments they got when we took them to a Christmas gathering!It also makes a fun winter project for the kids. I cut a 1/4 slit out of the large belly olive to make the cheese area larger.A great recipe...just make sure to tell the guests it is okay to eat them.

Really fun to make! I was standing in the kitchen assembling them and giggling 'cause they're so darn cute!! I definitely recommend cutting a hole in the head before inserting the beak. Otherwise they just crack. They're almost too cute to eat!!

I made this recipe before. The penguins were so cute. My relatives thought it was candy, and wanted to stay away from them. I informed them that it was an appetizer, all healthy/natural. They were a little time consuming to make, so meke ahead of time. I used those fancy tooth picks with the fringe, it made the penguins look even better/royal penguins.The crunch of the carrot was nice. You can put the carrot nose in a different direction, which ever is easiest. These make a wonderful display. Your guest will be impressed.

It was actually many years ago that I made these, but I was going through my recipes from this site and thought I should write a review. These were a big hit at a New Year's party that I went to, and they really weren't all that hard to make. Anyone who wants to impress their guests should try it!

This was easier than I thought it would be. My 9 year-old was doing them by herself.  We mixed some ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese (as another reviewer suggested) and piped with a ziplock baggie. For the heads, I cut a small horizontal slit where the beak would go and we put them together assembly-line style.  It went fast and the beaks went in fine.  I thought the flavors and texture were quite complimentary.

I have made these penguins for years and years. They are a hit every Christmas. In fact, last year, my sister asked for them for her wedding buffet, in April! I made them look like the wedding party. These are such fun little appetizers! They taste good, too. The oohs and ahhs are worth the time.

These were time consuming but they looked so cute! I had to let the olives drain/dry because they were too messy to handle while wet. Also, I precut and rolled the cream cheese pieces then rechilled it in the fridge before stuffing into the olives. On some I used cheddar cheese for the feet. They ate them all.

Made this for my daughter's 7th birthday party!  It was right around the time that Happy Feet came out and I was the coolest mom EVER!  I did season the cream cheese with a ranch dressing packet and then made a cheese ball igloo to go with it.  At first the kids thought it was too cute to eat but before long they devoured it!

These are very cute to take to a gathering.  Sure to be a hit...All in all though soak up the praise for presentation, cause they're kind of bland as an appetizer.

I made these for an Oscar party last night to honor the latest penguin movie.  They were a huge hit with the other party attenders.  I did mix about 1/2 of an envelope of dry ranch dressing mix into 8 oz of cream cheese and had enough to stuff way more than the 2 cans worth of black olives I had on hand.  My daughter made an adorable platform out of foam board, colored paper and plastic wrap and attached the finished penguins to the board - it was difficult at first as the toothpicks weren't strong enough to poke a hole, so she pre-poked holes with a needle.  I also used my mandolin to slice the carrots, also, which made the process go by much quicker and the slices were more uniform than when I was trying to cut them by hand.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and pre-slit the holes for the beaks, and took slivers out of the larger olive for stuffing.  A little time consuming over all, but well worth the kudos.

Looks great, a bit lacking in flavour but always a hit. I like to add things to the cream cheese, like garlic powder or dill,  to spice up the flavour.

Very tasty!  They are a bit of a mess, but the reactions they get make the prep time worth it.  Mix in some garlic and onion powder with the cream cheese for an added bit of flavor.

My girls and I made these for Christmas.  I had my 13 yo cutting a strip out of the olives and my 10 yo doing the carrots.  We put them on a platter with my crab dip spread and mounded.  They were so cute nobody wanted to eat them at first, they just wanted to take pictures!

I did add just a tiny bit of garlic powder to the cream cheese for a bit of flavor.  These were so awesome that I plan on making them for the wow factor.  These went over better than my apple pie cheesecake, and in my family I'm the cheesecake queen!

I loved the idea. i tried it before and was a success. Unfortunately i couldn't find any more pitted olives ( I live in Romania) so getting the pit out was hard work. they look cute though even if they only have half a head. 

thanks for it

Sorry, thought this was going to be a fun chance to implement a family tradition. NOT AN EASY RECIPE! I got the kids and ingredients and mom-in-law together and we broke olive after olive and while the "survivors" were cute, were not worth the effort! We made 9. Carrot, cream cheese and olive is not a taste blend that agrees with many people. But, those who were not part of the preparation were enamored with them.

I wish I had read the tip about piping the cream cheese into the olives because I had a terrible time inserting it without breaking the olives.  I also broke a lot when inserting the "beaks," even after cutting a slit first.  My kids thought these were adorable and enjoyed eating them, but I did find them a bit frustrating to make.

These are adorable and tasty!  They're a hit whenever I make them, even though most people say they're too cute to eat =)

I sometimes mix the cream cheese with a little salt and garlic powder, to give it more taste.

5 stars for presentation... these were so cute! Pretty easy to put together, too. I put the cream cheese (onion and chive) in a ziplock and cut of the tip to use as a piper. Only one was eaten, though... I guess everyone thought them too cute to eat. They weren't that great, but what do you expect from cream cheese stuffed olives, right?

Sooooo funny! Guests played with them more than they ate them. I used herbed cream cheese to liven up the flavor. Tasty and lots of fun. I'll definitely make this again.

These are just adorable.  I made them for two different Christmas parties and got compliments at both.  Used a disposable pastry bag to stuff the olives and mixed in spinach & herb flavoring with the cream cheese to give it a different taste.  Everyone loved them!!

A big hit at our Christmas gathering. My mother-in-law even saved some to show her best friend next time she sees her. Definitely time consuming, but worth it if you have the extra time. The only change I made was the kind of cream cheese I used; I made these with "chive & onion" cream cheese to add flavor.

I used this recipe for my Christmas setting yesterday.  I put them on a platter with coconut on it as snow and colored some of it blue for water.  It was a great hit with everyone.  Even more so with the kids. For a little texas touch I added a little chili pepper and a little cummin to the cream cheese. It looked and tasted great.

These penquins were a huge hit at the Christmas party I brought them too.  I mixed feta cheese with the cream cheese to give them a little more flavor.  Using a cookie press to push the cheese mixture into the olives works much better than a frosting bag or stuffing by hand.  I also found that making the carrot beaks rather thin works better than the chubby wedges that are left over from the feet disks.

Made them to take to work people feel in love with them and the 12 ladies the work with me are making these for their holiday parties the taste real good to. One lady is going to try with chives. They are so easy and to do a good amount and right they can be a little time comsuming but so so so worth it.

Very very cute!!! BUT not that tasty and I did use herb and chive whipped cream cheese. Also, not easy to transport, tried bringing them into work and huge hassle.

This was so easy and fun to make. I didn't worry about getting the toothpick through the beak, as long as it goes into the feet they stay together.  I added some flavor to the cream cheese as others suggested and they taste great. Some blue saran wrap makes nice ice on your serving dish. A big hit!

Great appetizer idea!  I made a plateful for a holiday gathering of friends and they loved them.  My husband thought they tasted great.  I used chive and onion cream cheese to give it some taste.  Fun recipe!

I love it! We served it at our housewarming party yesterday and it was a fabulous hit! It was a bit messy doing it, but those little things kept me (and my guests) laughing. I have been asked for the recipe numerous times! I had the penguins placed around with some shrimp on a platter, kind like a seafood array. Really nice for entertaining and good party conversation starters!

I served these at our first ever Christmas walk last year.  We started at our house & everyone was so impressed.  I then made them for Christmas - it was a very big hit.  They will become a tradition for me.

This is one of those appetizers that you take to a party and everyone is so impressed.  Yet they are so easy,can be made ahead, children and adults are delighted at the sight. I guarntee you take these to a party and you'll only be taking the serving platter home with you.

These were a big hit with all the guests.  I used chive and garlic cream cheese to fill them, and since I couldn't find frilly toothpicks I gave them all a curly parsley topper.

These were a big hit at a New Year's Eve party we attended.  I was worried that people would think they were too cute to eat but they were gone by the end of the party.  They are cuter than they taste.

I recently made these for my boyfriend's Christmas party and they were a hit!!! They even took pictures of them!! They are a little difficult to make, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. They are a little more time consuming than I thought they would be. I will definitely make these again!!!

The penguins were not easy to make but the end result was adorable.  I made 
30 penguins and only used about 1/2 of the cream cheese.  I was initially 
unsure about the combination of olives and cream cheese but they were pretty 
tasty.

I made these for Christmas appetizer. 
I allowed cream cheese to soften then placed in sandwich bag and squeezed into sliced olives. Was easier, faster and less messy. 
I used candy eyes. They looked adorable and stored standing up overnight in Fridge. Some fell over and they were a mess the next day. 
I would suggest cutting carrots (feet) thicker to help support them.

Thought they would be cute but was a disaster.
Would recommend not softening the cream cheese.
Got frustrated with the way they weren't coming together so won't make them.

Everyone at the gathering loved them!  I had a hard time making scarves, (I used Peppadews).  In the future I will make a few to accent a veggie tray

I made these last Autumn. I have never really done any of this cutesy stuff in a while because the kids are grown, but that doesn't mean you have to stop! But apparently, I did have to stop sending pictures of the army of penguins I was creating  to my daughter....something about she was in class...maybe a test....she's going to block me....meh. They were super cute, and the taste was okay, but the taste was the secondary factor. I used chive and onion cream cheese and just had to do the roasted red pepper scarfs from a suggestion!  Thank you! I'll have to prepare another army for this Holiday!

Great party appetizer.  Just be forewarned, it's more effort than in might appear.  My suggestions:

- Be sure to get Jumbo olives. Extra large are not all that big.

- Use flavored cream cheese or add some ranch dressing powder or other seasoning.  Plain cream cheese is too plain.

- Making scarves is great, but it's a lot of work and the result can be good or bad.  Better to just pipe some extra cream cheese which then flattens a bit when you affix the head, to create a sort of white scarf.

- Cut a little extra off the open end of each olive to make more room for piping the cheese in.

- Get big fat carrots.  Carve the beaks out of the carrots before slicing them.  It may end up being easier to use a different carrot for the beaks.

- Use neufchatel cheese. It pipes much easier.

- If this is going to be for an event that you want to impress folks, I highly suggest you make a practice run a week ahead of time.

What a fun appetizer this is!  It's great to take to someone else's home as it's a bit time consuming, so you don't have to worry about preparing a lot of other things!
I too used the chive & onion whipped cream cheese and put in a plastic bag with corner snipped.  Worked great!  Gave it a little rolling look to it too.
I will carry them to the party in a muffin tin, 2 to a spot, laying down for ease of transport.

These little penguins were so adorable! I was a little worried that the flavors would contrast, but they were super delicious. My family loved them and they were gone in a day! I will definitely make this recipe again as I had a lot of fun creating these little guys.

These adorable penguins were fun to make and did take a little time but they were well worth it.  They went so fast at the party that I didn't even get to have one!  (I had to make more at home!) I even shared the recipe with a few others!  Thanks!

adorable and cool idea, delicious too. especially with 1/2 tsp garlic powder in cream cheese.   ez and tastes better: slice orange cheesesticks for feet & beaks instead of carrots.

I made this about two years ago when my family was doing a finger food buffet style Christmas party, and everyone loved it!  Making it again this year for me and my dad since we're doing finger foods (ironic since he hates penguins).  I had a bit of trouble getting the cream cheese into the olives as they kept splitting more than intended and tearing at the sides, but the end result was so worth the mess.  This year I'm going to use herbed cream cheese for an extra hint of flavor.  Also, the pimento scarves are adorable but can actually be difficult to do, at least that was the hardest part for me.  Worth it though!

These are SO cute! When I made them,  to add something a little sweet, I cut the top off a strawberry and used that as a little party hat. I also attached candy eyes with cream cheese. So awesome!!!

I've made these twice now and they are always a big hit! they are a lot of work, but worth it for big parties. I've found that the carrot didn't add much taste and was too crunchy compared to the soft olive and cheese. last time I made them I substituted the carrot for orange pepper which really improved the taste and texture, and added some garlic and onion to the cream cheese. Now they're almost as delicious as they are adorable!

I was not sure about how they were going to taste (not being a fan of carrots), but I thought they would look adorable for me Christmas party. They were amazing and everyone loved them!

Talk about the Life of the Party!  These little guys stole the show.  People loved them so much they didn't want to eat them...Then I started Chowing and they were gone!  I wouldn't add anything to the cream cheese, the olive and carrot was enough.  Should have made more!

Don't try this without practicing beforehand. Using the slit method, not enough cream cheese into the olive, like just eating a black olive, pushing more cream cheese into the olive just comes out when threaded onto toothpick. I saw a version with candy eyes for the face of penguin, but nothing less than super glue would keep them on. I give it 2 stars because they are cute but after wasting over an hour trying to get the eyes and the pimento's to stay on, I gave up. All that was tasted anyway was a black olive and carrot. These would be better just used as decoration, not for consumption. Very disappointed.

They were hard to make, but it was worth it. We couldn't get the cream cheese in so we used a frosting bag to get it in. They didn't always stand up, but once we got them to, everyone loved them.

Excellent! So fun and well received. I did make one change --- we have a standing order in the house for our family cheese ball recipe.... I used that for the filling rather than the store bought cream cheese. A tip for folks that might want to try that option.... add a bit of sour cream and let the cheese ball set to room temp; makes it so much easier to fill these little cuties.

I have to say my intention was to make several but I only made 1, however they are very cute, I love them.  I also wish I would have gotten pimentos for the scarves because the red Pepper slices were too hard to manipulate around the little penguins neck.  Great idea the kiddos love them!!

These are adorable little guys and tasty.  I presented them on a platter that was covered in cream cheese.  I tinted some of the cream cheese with blue coloring and placed it on the platter with little swirls to look like waves.  I piled the white cream cheese higher on the other side of the platter to represent the snow bank and covered the 'snow' with the penguins.  I put single olives with the carrot noses in the water like they were swimming. Really cute.  Crackers can be served with the platter to use up the 'water' and 'snow'.

Cream Cheese Penguins Haiku: "5 stars for cuteness. More like 1 or 2 for taste. Tossed the leftovers." These are absolutely precious, and not as time-consuming to put together as I thought they'd be. My 1-year old's party was penguins, so of course I had to have this adorable army of penguins as an appetizer. I know my review won't be of any major assistance, considering all the helpful tips in the 100s of other reviews, but I'll go ahead and toss in my two cents: cream cheese should've been flavored, or at least had herbs added to it. These just tasted so boring! :( Also, to make it a bit easier: secure large olive to the carrot feet 1st, and then slide the head on - not as difficult as holding all 3 parts together and lining up a toothpick at once. And absolutely spooning the softened cream cheese into a baggy w/ the corner snipped off for piping is a HUGE help. They brought a smile to everybody's faces, but not to their bellies as there were tons that remained uneaten, but I am delighted to have made them anyways!

These are an awesome item, they were too cute though no one wanted to eat them.
I actually cut a piece out to make it easier for stuffing and was patience enough to the scarves but the were cute all the same.

This was really fun to bring to a party.  My niece was turning one and had what else--a Frozen theme.  Instead of carrots for the feet, I purchased a round block of cheese and shaped the feet appropriately.  This meant that the penguins did not fall down at all, and the appetizer was tastier.  I also made blue jello and had the penguins "skating."  Adorable!

I mixed Garlic and some green onion into the cream cheese, and used sharp cheddar cheese instead of the olives. I set aside a bit of the cream cheese to make sure the front of his tux is pure white though

A little plain tasting on their own, but I tried making them one year with part of a leftover cheese ball (two blocks of cream cheese and one packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Powder mixed all up and then rolled in coarse pepper) and they were the bomb! I don't do the scarves because I'm allergic to capsicums.

Took these to a party and they were a great success! I had a lot of creme cheese left over so next time I would use 1/2 pkg cream cheese; Valley Ranch dry Spicy mix (maybe 1/3 pk to taste); sliced horizontal slot out of small olive for beak and cut slight amt out for body. Use frilly toothpicks. Made 21. Cut carrots little less than 1/4".

So adorable! A little tip for the filling...we used spreadable cheese in garlic and herb flavor (Laughing Cow). We used a plastic sandwich bag with a small hole cut in the corner to pipe in the filling through the top hole.  As the the olive fills the split side separates to expose the white belly, so over-filling will make it seep through the sliced side just enough. Very easy, very fast.  Loved the red scarves but couldn't find long pimentos so ours were scarf-less.

I make these for family picnics,potlucks etc and use decoratative toothpicks with flags,shamrocks or whatever attached to the tops,just to celebrate the occasion. Always get a lot of laughs and too cute to eat comments but they always are gone.

This was a bit time consuming but they were such a hit.  I softened the cream cheese and put it in a pastry bag.  This is really the only way to do it, plus you get that ruffled shirt look.  I found a jar of roasted red peppers for the scarves and that worked well.  They hold together nicely and look cute on the table.  Everyone was impressed.

These were yummy. As others stated, very time consuming. Not sure if they are worth the time but they are cute.  I used garden vegetable cream cheese for flavor & piped a thin line of plain cream cheese to make it white.

The beaming faces of the kids made it worthwhile, although the time spent to make a triple batch did serious injury to my back (note to self: add 2 inches to the height of the kitchen counter tops).

Visual impression is better than overall outcome.  I used the herbed cream cheese (great idea!) but toothpicks are VITAL to ensuring this works.  Labour intense but fun if you need to vent some creative energy.

Made this for a baby shower and it was a hit! Yes, it's time consuming, but it's worth it. Used Herb & Garlic cream cheese vs regular cream cheese.

I took the advise of one other review and used ranch whipped cream cheese.  Thank you for the tip. How simple and cute, all my guests including myself myself were tickle pink and found them very tasty, the combination of ingrediants work well.

This is really cute, but I didn't care for the flavor.  Next time I am going to use mozzarella cheese on the inside and try to find a substitute for the carrot.

They are pretty bland as is. I made jalapeno pepper hats for a little spice, roasted red pepper scarves, and used the regular cream cheese. Very cute. (At least until my husband's "seal attack" doused them with Tabasco sauce.)

Very cute.  Everyone loved the presentation!  Def add some sort of flavoring to the cream cheese.  Only negative was that alot of our guests didn't like black olives.

What a way to start a party!  Young and old alike are still laughing at how cute they were...though not too cute to eat- everyone got gobbled up!

These were a huge hit at my husband's holiday party at work.  They are not difficult to make, but they are a little time consuming.  I put a couple tablespoons of a spicy ranch mix in the cream cheese to give it some extra flavor, as others have suggested.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

These little guys are so darling and fun!  I really had a hard time arranging them.  I made a double batch with my parents and husband and it was time consuming and not something you just whip up or throw together.  But, it is totally worth it!  I sat the best little guys out and put the box of our not so perfect penguines up.  The penguines were gone in a heartbeat, I don't know who sat out the other penguines but those were gone too.  And, I never got to try one.  I used the seasoned or flavored cream cheese and I think that was a good suggestion from other reviews.  I think these are appropriate at any holiday party and well worth the work.

These are great for potlucks or parties!  A little time consuming to make but well worth it because of all the compliments you'll receive.  I've even had people take pictures of them!  LOL  The only thing I do differently is that I add a little Hidden Valley Ranch powder to the cream cheese.  I also use sheets of styrofoam and poke the toothpicks through the carrot feet into the foam to keep them upright during transport and it also makes them look like they are standing on a slab of ice.

I LOVE this idea. I made them for my sons first grade class.  The kids loved how they looked.  Some ate them, but mostly ate just the olives.  This took a lot of time to make, but I will make them again.  Thanks!

I loved making these even though its a little time consuming, but it was fun and everyone loved them!  I read others advise and used the ranch mix, and i think it made a big difference, thats why i can only give it 4 stars because the original recipe doesnt call for the dry ranch mix.

Clever idea and fun conversation item. I like to fill the jumbo olives the night before. Assembly is easy - dinner guests (even children who won't eat black olives) sometimes like to do this part.

This gets 3 stars for taste and 1 more for the idea. I made one 'test' penguin with plain cream cheese and found it lacking, so I used the garden veggie kind. I used a baby spoon to put the cream cheese into the olives, and it wasn't too messy at all. People loved the penguins (and if they weren't olive fans, they still thought they were so cute).

These are SO cute! Our guests thought they were almost too cute to eat.  You should NOT use regular cream cheese though.  Use whatever flavor you like, just not plain - it tastes weird.  I think that garlic and herb cheese spread would be perfect.

At risk of repeating everyone... these are sooo cute! Make sure you get the jumbo olives though- I used mediums and it made it very difficult, although the baby ones turned out great. I also chopped some monteray jack cheese and made my tray look like an ice flow. Thanks for the great idea!

My daughter's first grade class is studying penguins this month.  I made these as part of the class snack this week along with veggies and dip.  I know it was the first time some of them had eaten olives and they loved them.  The best part was seeing how excited they were when they saw the penguins; pure joy.

We love these! I have made them for 2 Christmases now and everyone thought they were cute and tasty. The kids especially ate them up. Use the tips from other reviewers on filling them. I have used plain and flavored cr. cheese and I love it both ways.

These did take a little while to make..and they tasted just "ok". However, they were the hit of the party and everyone took one even if they didn't like olives just because they were so cute.

These are so adorable, and a great conversation piece. They do take a while to assemble though.  I piped the cream cheese into the olives for less mess.

Awesome! There almost too cute to eat. It's how I got my causins, when they come over, (all under the age of 12) to eat their vegetables, without complaining! Even though the cream cheese adds some extra calories. I'd recomend it for pot lucks, and festivities!!! TWO THUMBS UP!!! *****

These are fabulous. I always use a dry ranch mix and mix half a package to 1 8oz cube of cream cheese. They are veeery time consuming, but everyone is always impressed. I cannot say enough good things about them.

Did as others suggested and added the ranch dip to the cream cheese which added flavor.  These were a hoot to make.  Did them with my niece over Thanksgiving holiday.

These were a great conversation piece, easy to make, and allowed my 8 year old to take some credit.  I did the cutting, but had her assemble the rest, and she enjoyed everyone's comments.  They are just adorable and very yummy!  They were a big hit and I will make again and again...anytime the occasion calls for it!

These cuties are ALWAYS a hit, whether guests are a fan of olives or not!  I've made these several times for various parties and they are well worth the time and effort!  Thank you so much for the idea.  I'm always on the lookout for other fun appetizers like this one!  A++!

I got great feedback when I took these to a work morning tea, they all were eaten and everyone commented on how clever I was to make them! They have been requested for our next get together and I am now making some for a workmate's son's birthday party.

Excellent!!!  Made these for Christmas this year and they were a huge hit.  It was a great project for me to work on with my 10 & 11 year old nieces.  I cut the olives, one of them filled them and then one attached them to the carrot bottom.  Definite keeper.  I did do as many people suggested and added an evelope of the ranch dressing to the cream cheese.  Also made a cheese ball to use an an igloo.  My nieces had great fun decorating the "island".

I used a plastic sandwich bag with the tip cut off to pipe it out into the olives and it was a lot easier. Added some flavored cream cheese. I agree that they are mostly for show, but everybody loved them at my family christmas party.

The penguins are very cute to look at, but a huge pain to make! It took my husband and I well over an hour to make twenty penguins. Did I mention they were kind of messy? I used a decorating bag and tip and still had to wipe my penguins clean. They do NOT transport well.  I heated cream cheese and set the penguins in and refrigerated hoping they wouldn't move around too much- they all looked like they were drunk by the time I drove 10 miles :) I served at a party and people looked at them but didn't eat a lot.  Wayyyy time consuming for such a plain flavor.  I would definitely use some ranch flavor as some other users suggest if you are brave enough to make these.

This was just too cute to eat!!  I made it for Christmas get together and was afraid the kids weren't going to eat them, but they totally loved it!!  I used garlic salt in the cream cheese to give it some added taste and it went very well with the olives.  Thank you!

I too added a little seasoning to the cream cheese.  Not as easy to make as stated in other review, at least not for me.  Took me almost an hour.  And only a few people ate them.  Guess they were not fans of olives and chream cheese.  Very cute though!

These were a really cute appetizer. I mixed the cream cheese with dill dip mix for added flavor. The assembly process is time consuming so be sure to prepare these well in advance of when you want to serve them.

These are adorable. They are a little time consuming to put together, but I figured they would be by looking at them. I used the the chive & onion cream cheese. They were a big hit. Had lots of comments on them.

I can't say enough about these cute little penguins! They were a big hit on Christmas Eve with my family. Much to my surprise, they didn't take long to assemble. I added some onion powder to the cream cheese for flavoring. Will definitely be making these again, perhaps to take to the office. Thanks for the  great idea!

These are so cute! I hate olives but had to make them for a church function just for the visual appeal. Easily the hit of the day. And very easy too.

I hated these and thought they were dull and bland but I brought them to our easter get-together yesterday and everyone else raved about how cute they were and devoured every last one. Since none came home with me and I didn't have to throw any away - 4 stars.
