Yum!  Made this twice, both times with canned with corned beef and brown rice. Great dish for quick and easy meal. Prefer this to the corned beef hash we usually make with potatoes

This has great potential but for us it needs a lot more vegetables and flavor.  Onion, peppers, peas, carrots would give a big boost.  The corned beef tastes like Spam which is  great  in fried rice.  Pineapple, ginger and garlic would be great additions.
