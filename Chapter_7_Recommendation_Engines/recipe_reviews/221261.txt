I used frozen chunked bananas so that I would not have to use ice. I also used lactose-free milk and added a teaspoon of vanilla. The grownups would not drink this but we really wouldn't have needed to. The two kids drank all four servings between them. My youngest boy gave me two thumbs up.

Since the combination of bananas and peanut butter in a smoothie intrigued me I decided to give this a try. I LOVE peanut butter and could eat it by the spoonfuls...(too bad they don't make a fabulous fat free version). Just as the submitter states it's refreshing and tasty!  I froze my banana so I only used a little ice and to lighten this up I used skim milk (a bit less than called for to get the desired consistency) along with reduced fat peanut butter.  Not only is this good, but it's good for you too and perfect for breakfast or a nice snack!

In Hubs' words, "I can't really say WHAT it tastes like, but it's strangely addicting."  He rated it four stars.  I asked what it might take for him to rate it five stars.  "I don't know, maybe more banana," he said. Regardless, he cleaned up a two serving recipe lickety-split.   I think it also deserves recognition for its uniqueness - it's not your typical berry-yogurt smoothie.  Using frozen bananas as well as the ice cubes made this super thick and frosty!

This was perfectly delicious. We are really into almond butter and almond milk lately so I subbed those for the milk and peanut butter. I had it for breakfast and was very satisfied with it. Though I did use the honey, it might not even be necessary. The little sip I took before adding the honey was really great as well. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious! I also use frozen bananas, and omit the ice. I also skip the honey because I find it doesn't need any extra sweetness. I make this for breakfast, and it keeps me energized until lunch!

After seeing the reaction from my 3 kids, I announced that this is a 'dessert' they can ask for anytime. So delicious. 
Now, one minor alteration, due to milk intolerance: We use vanilla yogurt for all our smoothies, and add water for the liquid. I typically use 1 cup yogurt, and 2 cups water, sometimes a little more. Who ever thought of peanut butter smoothies are genius. I can't wait to try sneaking kale into it :)

My family and neighbors all gave it a thumbs up.  We tried to it with 1) a mix of regular milk and vanilla almond milk, 2) regular milk, and 3) vanilla milk only.   We preferred it with vanilla almond milk, no regular milk.  It was good both ways though.  I didn't use honey with any of them, as it was plenty sweet enough. I also used organic peanut butter that was simply ground peanuts - no sweeteners or anything else added.  Plants store their food in the roots, so the peanuts have a lot of sugar already.   We started freezing almond milk in the ice cube tray and use about 5 cubes and 1/2 cup almond milk instead of the cup of milk.  Makes a delicious frosty treat that's healthy, and filling too.

I followed some other reviewers and froze the bananas so I wouldn't have to use ice but it wasn't as thick as I like my smoothies.  I love peanut butter but  I guess I don't like drinking it.  My rating is more for a personal taste.  I can understand that some people would like this, it just isn't something I would do again.

Super yummy.  The kids won't eat/drink fruit smoothies so I thought this might please them and I was right.  I only used one (large) banana and we still found it a little too thick, so next time I will only use one cup of ice.  The kids also want to add cinnamon next time so we'll try that.  I used unsweetened soy milk and think, like LatinaCook, I'll try it with almond butter as well.  Very versatile recipe!

I used frozen bananas and omitted the ice, plus used crunchy almond butter and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  I then added a handful of spinach leaves (would have added Kale but didn't have any) and a tablespoon of flax seed.  My 2 year old and 5 year old love it!

My husband isn't wild about bananas but he still liked this! He said, "very refreshing!"
Instead of honey, I used a scoop of chocolate whey protein powder. That chocolate / banana / peanut butter combination is yummy. A nice change from our berry smoothies. Thanks!

I used almond milk, no ice cubes, and frozen banana chunks.  It was great.  I may add 1 tbsp of cocoa next time!  (Need more bananas!)

Great, refreshing. I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us.....used frozen bananas (1 1/3)!and added 1 Tblsp cocoa. Really good. Because of having a vitamix, I added the ice even though my bananas were frozen. Great consistency. Thank you for sharing.

I think this is excellent. I modified mine by using 1% Lactaid instead of regular milk because I am lactose intolerant.  I used a frozen banana. I added about a cup of fresh strawberries. I skipped the ice because my bananas were frozen and the milk was cold.  (I skipped the peanut butter because I used fresh strawberries.  I did not add any honey. I thought this came out "sweet enough". It was refreshing and frothy. I love milkshakes but not the calories and am trying to wean myself away from them.  I think this was an outstanding substitute that I can enjoy instead of a real (high calorie) milk shake. I used this recipe as a meal substitute. It certainly took care of the craving for a strawberry shake.

This is better than any of the fruit smoothies that I have ever had!  I make my smoothie with vanilla almond milk and rather than measure out 1/2 cup PB, I just add a heaping tablespoon or two per person depending on how much PB flavor I want.  This makes for easier cleanup.  I don't use ice, but rather freeze my bananas and add an extra cup of milk.  I also add a cup of oatmeal to make it more filling as a breakfast drink.  It is so good, and we have it several times a week for breakfast or as an afternoon pick-me-up snack!

this smoothie is good. I used half-n-half instead of milk, and it came out thick. I would add more peanut butter the next time, But still, This is great.

I made this this morning because I had all the ingredients in my fridge, but HOLY COW - this recipe makes about 16 ounces! I love how easy it it too make, especially on the go and the rich peanut butter taste and smell is great too. If you just need one serving, cut the recipe in half but it is a little high on the calorie side.

Overall, this is a great and simple recipe.
I cut the recipe in half, as I only needed it for myself.
I used Silk Almond Milk instead of milk, which turned out really well. Definitely emphasizes the peanut butter flavor.
For the peanut butter, I cut it down to 3/4 cup, which I would definitely do 1 cup next time. I love a really peanut buttery taste!
I nixed any sweetener or honey.

It was pretty good, and I would definitely make again. The only reason it is 4 stars is due to the fact that the original recipe calls for only 1/2 cup peanut butter. When I cut the recipe in half, I actually added more peanut butter than the original recipe and it is still lacking a real peanut butter taste!

Yes, it's there. But it's like having watered down tea. Or a fountain soda with very little flavor and mostly carbonated water. When I think of a peanut butter banana smoothie, I want a PEANUT BUTTER and banana smoothie. This was more of the reverse. BANANA and peanut butter smoothie.

Overall, I recommend. If you are looking for a real peanut butter taste, I would recommend 1 cup for 2 servings, or 2 cup (maybe 1 3/4) for the original amount.

Thanks for the base recipe though!

I made this for my toddler, and halved the recipe:) He loved it (I think he thought it was banana ice cream). So he gets "ice cream" and I get him to eat healthy- win win! ;D

What a wonderful treat!  I had some old fashioned peanut butter in the jar, which had separated and was so difficult to try to stir back together. So this recipe was a great way to use it up.  I did not use ice as I had frozen bananas.  I drank 1/3 of it, then froze the rest.  I'm thinking it will also make a great frozen frosty if I just thaw it a bit and eat it with a spoon.

I was interested in trying something different and decided to try this smoothie recipe. I used Greek yogurt instead of milk and cut the recipe down for one serving. I think this is a really nice recipe that you can play with by making substitutions. For example, the next time, I will add a bit of chopped dark chocolate, I think. In addition, I read through all of the other suggestions made and there are some great ideas out there!

This is a delicious and refreshing smoothie. I used frozen banana chunks, so I also omitted the ice. And I thought it was plenty sweet, so I omitted the honey as well. Also, a tweak to decrease fat and calories is to use PB2 in place of the peanut butter.

Add about 2 TBSP cocoa or carob powder.  Definitely add the honey.  Delicious.  I've been making this for years!!!  Oh, and I use almond or soy milk rather than regular milk.

Just made this. I have been wanting a banana and peanut butter smoothie. This one was perfect. I doubled the recipe and used less milk as I wanted it thicker. I will make again soon.

I was looking for a better breakfast alternative for my preteen besides the sugary cereal he eats every morning.  This is hands down the most delicious, filling, energy booster I've found.  Easy enough to alter ingredients to individual tastes, but so good as written too!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

I should have done what everyone else did and froze the bananas. Mine turned out very watery. I tried to add more ice cubes but then it became very bla. If I did it again I'd defiantly recommend freezing the bananas.

Yummy enough but 'missing' something for me to give it a 5.  Not quite sure what it needs though.  It is sweet enough, so not more honey or sweetner...I'd give it a 4.5 if a could  =)

I added a half cup of chocolate chips. It was good but if you do this add another banana and less milk for more of a thick texture.

Just made this, it taste's a whole lot better with plain greek yogurt, eventhough the recipe doesn't call for it, I ommitted the honey since the Peanut Butter has Honey in it, and eliminated the ice..overall it's pretty good. :)

Loved it!Nice and smooth and refreshing even on a snowy day. I was wanting to make the peanut butter and jelly shake but I ran out of jelly so I made jelly toast on the side with the peanut butter banana smoothie and loved it!

I didnt have any yogurt and was happy to find this recipe. Perfectly sweet, and reduce milk if you want a thicker smoothie. I used  very ripe bananas, 1% milk, raw honey, and added cinnamon and vanilla. Pretty healthy breakfast actually!

I loved this recipe! I added in a teaspoon of chocolate syrup, and switched out the honey with agave nectar and the peanut butter with Peanut Butter & Co's White Chocolate Wonderful all natural peanut butter, since I was out of both honey and regular peanut butter. The rest of the recipe I followed (measurements too.) The way I made it was absolutely delicious! I would definitely without a doubt make this again!

2 cups of milk is way too much for this recipe. This came out like thin, pb/banana-flavored milk. I think the rest of the proportions are fine, and I'd try this again, but use 1 or 1.5 cups instead.

I use unsweetened almond milk, natural peanut butter, frozen bananas and either ground flax or hemp seeds. It's delicious and you'd swear it was made with ice cream or ice...it's that thick and creamy.

2 cups of milk is too much.  My smoothie was way too watery, and just adding more ice would water down the flavor.  Try with 1 to 1.5 cups of milk instead.

I replaced 1 cup of the milk with one cup of plain Greek yogurt to make it a little thicker. My kids and I scarfed it down!

This was pretty yummy. I would use less milk and more ice next time. I like my smoothies thick. Overall it was good.

It was runnier than I usually like my smoothies, but it was good - I wonder how it would taste using vanilla ice cream instead of milk and ice...???  Maybe try that for a dessert one evening!  Yum!

I substituted Stevia In-the-Raw(r) for the honey at about 2 Tbs and it was so sweet that I think I might cut back to 1 & 1/2 Tbs next time. As to whether or not it's delicious... Well I did say there was going to be a next time didn't I? It's very good and just like naples34102 said, "It's strangely addicting." I agree totally! It's easy to make too!

My daughter is a peanut butter addict, so I made this for her as an after school snack.
I used two frozen bananas and only about 1/2 cup of ice. I replaced the honey with a splash of organic blue agave nectar and used plain organic non-fat yogurt in place of the milk. This came out smooth and just the right thickness to drink through a straw. She said it was "really good" and would drink it again.

I made this smoothie yesterday and it was absolutely divine! The whole family loved it! I did cut the recipe in half, since we are a small bunch. The honey was great to use instead of sugar. While drinking the smoothie, you tasted a hint of peanut butter and at the very end, you still tasted it! So wonderful! Next time I am definitely using the whole recipe!

Yummy!!!!   My two taste testers say "Delicious!"  
I followed the advice of others and froze the bananas in advance - also used 3 bananas.  Added about one cup of ice cubes and the end result was frosty and delicious.  Will definitely be making again.

This is a very tasty and simple drink.  I made a half recipe and used almond milk (that is what I had on hand).  And I only had about 2 Tbs. of Ovaltine left in the container, so I threw that in too (instead of honey).  Quite yummy!  Thank you for sharing this recipe Becca!

I guess I'm just an all fruit smoothie lover.  This was ok but didn't hit the spot.  Lot's of fat with 1/4 c of peanut butter.  I like my smoothies a bit more on the healthy side since high cholesterol is an issue in my family.

This is sooooo good. I added almond cocoa butter (Trader Joe's) to the mix. I didn't really measure anything. I just gage how much I can tolerate of the peanut butter, honey and almond cocoa butter. I only used one banana as it was for one person. I kept adding ice until it was thick enough for me.

A little thin when I first made it, Fiance liked the idea of my throwing a handful of frozen strawberries in with it, so I added just a little more honey as well, made it incredibly good!  The frozen strawberries thickened it right up and made the consistency just right for us :)

Instead of milk I used half unsweetened silk milk and half French vanilla creamer (lactose free) and omg it was amazing! I will totally make it again and I'm really not big on bananas.  It is really sweet so might use less honey or less creamer next time.

Great recipe!! I used frozen bananas. I only used 2 tbsp of peanut butter and 1 tbsp of honey. I added a cup of chocolate whey protein powder, half a cup of Greek vanilla yogurt, and 1/2 tsp of my own turmeric cinnamon mix. Trying to drink my meals after getting out of the hospital. My appetite is  these days.

Never really in to smoothies, but had dental work done and needed something to eat. This is a great recipe! Had frozen mashed bananas (didn't add ice) so I don't know how many bananas I used, but I did add a little extra peanut butter and a dash of vanilla as others suggested.  AWESOME! Shared with my hubby and he loved it, too. I may be smoothie fan now......

Pretty good. I halved the recipe in case I didn't like it. I used Vanilla Yogurt instead of milk. All other ingredients stayed the same.

This recipe is perfect! And very simple (thank you for that!) I made it with a frozen banana and no ice and also with ice and room temperature banana. Both are great. I halved the recipe for one and it was a generous amount.

Tasted great. I put in a little more milk so that the peanut taste wasn’t so strong. Used almond milk instead.

Made this today with my 4 yr old daughter. She loves peanut butter and since I had 2 ripe bananas. I thought I'd give this smoothie a try. 
It's sooo delicious. Two thumbs up from my baby girl. I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe but used chunky peanut butter (cause that's all that we had) so yummy.

I added an extra banana and used frozen bananas so I wouldn’t have to use so much ice. I also did cinnamon instead of honey because my twins are younger than 1 years old. 
It was so delicious, smooth and flavorful. The twins loved it! Will definitely be making again.

I just got done with a workout. I wanted a little bit of peanut butter to get some quick protein in my system which caused a google search that led me here. 
A HALF CUP OF PEANUT BUTTER!?! Alright I will give it a shot. 
Even if none of the ingredients offend my dietical sensibilities TOO much, this tastes way too good to be diet food.

I made this with an unsweetened coconut ~ almond milk blend and found it needed no additional sweetening.  It was delicious!  Thank you for this easy and tasty smoothie recipe!

Be warned....this is NOT low fat!!! I made half the recipe for my GF son. I used almond milk and it made him a large glass full. He loved it! It was filling enough for a  active teenage boy!!

Made it exactly as written. Grandkids both loved it. I tasted out of curiosity- it's ok, but to be fair, I'm not a huge peanut butter fan. But it was quick & easy to whip up.

I love it at breakfast and as a late-night treat! I personally use vanilla almond milk. Kids love it and if you want it to be a Lil healthier you could use natural peanut butter. Pretty sure that if you put some chocolate syrup it would be pretty great too or even popsicles!

I added a cup of spinach because I don't like spinach plain. I never even tasted the spinach at all.  Great way to make it a lil more healthy and it doesn't change the yummy flavor at all. Definitely will make again.

Really loved it. But I did use different ingredients  instead of regular milk I used almond milk  unsweetened, almond peanut butter, the only thing is it's not as think as I thought it would be but still works and taste delicious..

Other than using sweetener instead of honey, I followed the recipe as is. Made it for my grandchildren who loved this as much as I did. Will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! Very simple and easy to make, but so delicious!

I know it's a smoothie, but I added a bit more milk to make it little less thick. Just my personal preference though.

Super tasty! Consistency was refreshing and the peanut butter was there without being overpowering. I added a couple handfuls of fresh spinach to trick myself into eating  some greens, and it didn’t change the flavor at all.

This smoothie was delicious. I used unsweetened almond milk in place of milk and it was so yummy.

Growing up, my mom didn't keep junk food in the house. So I had to get creative when I wanted something sweet. I found a recipe for peanut butter banana smoothie somewhere, can't remember where. I LOVED IT! This recipe is just like the one I used to make. Satisfying and reasonably healthy =)

I used whole lactose free milk. It was delicious albeit a tad thin. So maybe a teeny less milk and one less ice cube.

It's delicious! But I'm adding oatmeal according to my diet so it becomes more filling. It's perfect for a quick morning drink and gives extra energy. Also without the honey or another sweetener it's still sweet.

Extremely simple and delicious! I used this as a post workout and substituted the honey for chocolate whey protein which made it that much better. Very versatile and filling, though it does make quite a bit so plan to share or scale down!

Nothing spectacular. I melted the peanut butter just enough to not have it just one big glob. Overall, not enough flavor. More banana and peanut butter and/or less milk.

I really like it. Yummy. I halved and halved again to make only one recipe. I added a little more ice and peanutbutter. I also added a splash of vanilla and a little more honey. It was super great for a breakfast or really any time of day.

Kids loved it and drank every drop. I will definitely make again. The slight change I made was adding a tiny splash of vanilla.

I literally crave this smoothie in the mornings!
Its soooooo awesome.
I cut the recipe in half and sometimes sub almond milk instead of dairy milk.

Both ways hit the spot!

Delicious, refreshing treat! Used frozen bananas,  replaced milk with water, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  More than once, I've had this as a fast, easy lunch. Most likely, I'll have it again!

I'd make it again, but make adjustments so banana and peanut butter flavors are more prominent.

As is, this is delicious and worth five stars. We are trying to eat less dairy so I replaced the regular milk with chocolate almond milk. I also added a couple spoonfuls of ground flax seed for extra fiber (this doesn’t change the taste at all).

Loved it but took off 1 star for not saying to freeze bananas.Freeze bananas and use less ice, add a little vanilla extract.Make some for later cause its hard to clean peanut butter from blender.Store in frig,wont be as slushy later, but will be good unless ur picky.

I cut down the recipe for only 1 serving. I used a combination of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and chocolate almond milk and I didn't use honey. I also added ground flaxseeds. By far one of my top favorite smoothies and under 300 calories?! Can't beat that!!

I cut the recipe in half and it made about 16 oz which was a large serving for me. I also exchanged the milk for vanilla almond milk. The smoothie is so thick and creamy, I love it.

I used frozen bananas and kept out the ice and honey as well, but I accidentally added twice as much peanut butter than the recipe called for because I forgot I was splitting the recipe in half to fit my blender, but remembered for all the other ingredients. It still tastes great! Next time I'll use the proper banana-to-peanut butter ratio and see what that tastes like, but all in all it's a great recipe

This is delicious and very refreshing on a hot day! When I made it just for myself, I cut the recipe in half and that made plenty for one person.  I used vanilla coconut milk and sunflower seed butter because I have multiple food allergies. I also added some cooked quinoa cereal.  I regularly eat quinoa for nutritional purposes, but I don't like the bitter taste.  This smoothie did a great job covering up the taste of the quinoa.  If I didn't know it was in there, I wouldn't have known it was in there.  Thank you!

I used vanilla almond milk and did not use the honey. It turned out pretty good and a little on the watery side but not so much that it bothered me. Perhaps the recipe should be changed to weight when it comes to the banana since not all bananas are the same size.

This tasted okay, but nothing special. It tastes just like having a banana with peanut butter on it.The ice made it really crunchy and I think it probably would have done better with frozen bananas then just ice for a better texture.

When we made it, we just added how much we thought we needed, we didn't even use measuring cups! It was so refreshing on a hot summer day, and it even feels like your drinking a milkshake, but it's healthy! We totally recommend this! Breakfast, or Lunch!  (it's best made on a really hot summers day)

I followed the recipe exactly, it was nice but bit too heavy for me. Next time I’ll make it I won’t add this much honey and peanut butter maybe I’ll add half of banana too.

Absolutely love this! I did frozen bananas to replace the ice cubes and for milk I chose unsweetened almond milk and it's amazing! Definitely drinking this to start off my mornings.

I will for sure make this again! It was so smooth, and wasn’t too rich at all! I added a bit of regular non fat green vanilla yogurt and it added a very silky texture too it! Very yum!

This recipe has the perfect amount of each ingredient in it! I never seem to get the amount right when I make it on my own so it usually is lacking flavor, but this recipe came out fantastic!

It didn’t have much flavor to it when I followed the recipe. When I was done, I tasted it and then added more peanut butter and some protein powder. I also added more honey as well. Next time I will up the solid ingredients and cut back on the milk.

Super easy. I strongly dislike making smoothies because years of bartending have left me hating blenders. This is so easy that I will make smoothies without hate. I used a NutriBullet, which is very small (and easy to clean), so I halved the recipe. 1 cup almond milk, 2/3 cup ice, 1/3 cup quick oats, 1 fresh banana, and a heaping serving spoon of peanut butter.

I saw a recommendation for vanilla extract, so I added that.  I also used crunchy peanut butter.  That offset the crushed ice rather well.  It was a great treat, and so nutritious.  I also used almond milk.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I just made it for myself so I halved the recipe. Also, I added a spoon full of Nestle chocolate powder because I love PB, chocolate, and banana. I highly recommend for my fellow banana lovers.

It was pretty good but it was a little foamy when I finished making it. I changed the recipe a bit but I added 1 banana, 1 cup milk, 1 cup ice and 1/2 tablespoon of white sugar instead of honey. I also did not add any penut butter.

I think next time I’ll use 3 bananas instead of two, and halve the amount of ice. I added Nesquik cocoa powder and left out the honey. I also added 1/4 extra peanut butter (I used crunchy). Yummy! I think the extra peanut butter and banana make it thicker, which is nice.

So awesome! With a few easy adjustments I use this as a meal replacement when I have a craving:
Substitutions:
- frozen banana chunks
-1/4 cup reduced fat peanut butter
-1 2/3 cups Vanilla Almond Milk
-2Tbsp honey crunch wheat germ
*optional: 1/4 scoop Nature's Plus Banana 
                     SPIRU-TEIN (when using as meal 
                     replacement)
I decided to cut the amount of peanut butter in half because it was very, very heavy the first time I made it and to sweet. 1/4 cup is plenty to create a nice, balanced pb flavor. I also left out the honey because
between the pb, honey crunch wheat germ (a bit of crunch survives the Ninja). and the vanilla almond milk it is plenty sweet without being cloying. I did the #'s in my head and overall it comes out with less fat, carbs, sugars, and calories per serving.
*I will work it out on paper, by ingredient and add the info to this review in the near future...  ;)

This was great. I used natural peanut butter and 1 Tbsp of Maple Syrup instead of honey. I also added 1 Tbsp of cocoa powder as my son had requested a chocolate peanut butter smoothie. *Update* These make fantastic popsicles.

Since I'm the only one in my house who drinks smoothies I had to convert it to one serving  instead of four. I'm still tinkering around with the recipe to get it just right but overall it is a good refreshing treat.

I used peanut butter powder which lowers the calories and fat and gives it a better consistency than using regular peanut butter.

This is one of our favorite smoothies!  My husband and I both love it!  It makes for a great pre-workout smoothie for an energy boost and is also great post workout.  This smoothie is incredibly filling and we will frequently have it for breakfast.  I love how simple it is to make and it only takes a few minutes.  Instead of regular milk, we use almond milk.  I highly recommend this smoothie, especially if you love peanut butter!

If you like a little more chocolate, I would suggest adding Nutella instead of peanut butter. It’s delicious that way.

Followed directions, except that I forgpt the honey and added a tablespoon of super greens (chocolate) and a little bit of chocolate for the kids. The consistency was a little thinner than we usually have with smoothes, but it tasted great and I think I'll keep as is. The kids really liked it, and I do too. This will go into our breakfast/snack rotation!

This was so delicious after the first sip. I would keep making it before and even after every workout, even to help me gain weight.

Delicious! I wanted it to be vegan, which was easy - I used almond milk instead of regular milk, and maple syrup instead of honey. 

I also followed some other reviewers' recommendations and used frozen bananas (and no ice).

Loved this! 
I followed the recipe and also added cinnamon, frozen spinach, chia seeds, hemp hearts and ground flax.   I subbed almond milk.   Soooooo yummy! I did have to use extra Ice to thicken it up how we like it so next time I will cut the milk down in half and add more in only if it needs it to blend proper.    Even my toddler is sucking it back!

Great recipe! Easy and quick. I also used frozen bananas.
Have made this several times. Once I only had a cup of milk left so I added a cup of strawberry kefir and it made it even better!

Delicious! I also didn't add the ice, but i used coconut milk, a frozen banana, spinach and a supplemental powder for added nutrition. I only made one serving but I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk. Yummy!!

This turned out very runny, more like a peanut butter "juice" than a smoothie. Next time I will try it with frozen bananas and only 1.5 c milk. I managed to salvage this batch by adding some cocoa and a bit of extra honey, and calling it chocolate peanut butter milk for my kids, but I didn't like it at all.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I've made it twice so far and I can already determine how important the quality of the peanut butter is. You can't use regular jar peanut butter. I like the bulk peanut butter from my grocer. Ripeness of the bananas matters as well. This is a keeper.

The kids asked for this and added a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and an apple and I added a teaspoon of flax seed.

They didn't care for the seed. One kid rated it three stars and the other five star.

I did not add honey, used frozen banana and just a few ice cubes.  It had a strong peanut butter taste, but I love that!  Next time I would use more banana.

So good, used what i had handy, unsweetened almond milk and less honey.   It was sweet enough, I'll make it again.

Made exactly as the recipe says.  Personally too much peanut butter. I added a extra banana and it was more tolerable. Not my favorite but gets 4 stars because my daughter loves it.

My father in law was having issues swallowing and Ensure gets old quick so we tried this recipe. I used almond milk in place of regular milk. He loved it! Will definitely make again.

Made it just like the recipe and it was super easy, came out great, and both kids loved it. I have made it twice so far and will definitely make it again.  Perfect for bananas that are about to go bad.

Yummy, I'd call it more a shake than a smoothie. It's definitely dessert not breakfast at, what was it, 24,27g of sugar, something ridiculous like that. But I love it as do my children.

I really liked it, the directions make enough for a lot of people depending on serving sizes, but it tastes good. May suggest taking a little peanut butter away so it doesn't overpower the other flavors, but good smoothie.

Delicious!  I only make it for me at breakfast so I trimmed the recipe in half, froze the banana, and added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon with a tsp of vanilla.

I got my wisdom teeth out and was looking for something delicious and filling. Found it! I made it the first time as-is and loved it. Wouldn't change a thing. To add some extra oomph, I added whey protein the next time. Taste didn't change, and it was still amazing. Love how smooth and flavorful it is!

So yummy! I am pregnant and at that glorious stage where I can't keep much food down. 

I have been making smoothies a lot and this is by far my favorite! I like that it has a little protein with the peanut butter and it isn't overly sweet. 

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for except for I added a splash of vanilla extract. Thanks for sharing it is absolutely a god send!

I recently had oral surgery and needed some liquid meal options. I tried it as written and also tried it with frozen bananas and less ice. Both were winners. It's delicious, nutritious, and filling. I will definitely make it again.

I had to add more peanut butter and it was too much milk. It was too watery. Only add 1 banana because the banana flavor is too strong.

I made this for my kids.  I've tried several smoothie recipes in the past and most have turned out just ok.  I am not a huge peanut butter fan so i wasn't really excited about making this one but then it was for my kids.

I used regular almond milk and the smooth style peanut butter.  When it was all said and done...it was awesome!!  Best smoothie I have ever made.  It didn't have an over whelming peanut butter taste but had enough to give it that flavor.

Kids loved it and I just saved it to my "favorite recipes" folder.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was awesome! I'm dairy intolerant so I used chocolate almond milk instead of regular milk, I also used sun-butter  instead of peanut butter. It came out DELICIOUS!!!

I love it! The only change I made was too the amount of peanut butter. I didn't want the peanut butter to overpower the bananas in taste so used 3 tablespoons instead of half a cup.

I liked it but the first time, i made a full batch, but instead of two cups of ice cubes, i did two ice cubes cuz i read it wrong. But my ice cubes are the size of a thumb about. I had two servings when i was done, and i had one and put the other in the fridge. Later, i drank the other serving after about an hour in the fridge. That one was really delicious and it was better than the first. I made one again recently, but halved the ingredients and made one serving. This time i made it with a full cup of ice cubes. This time it tasted very watered down, and i disliked it, so i suggest trying it with less ice cubes

I thought it was great! I love peanut butter and bananas, so it was perfect. I personally didn't use ice cubes or frozen bananas, and it still came out nicely. It is quite filling too. It the perfect to fill you up.

I halved the recipe for a single serving for my husband.  It was rather thin, so next time, I will pre-freeze the banana and omit the ice cubes in hopes of creating a thicker smoothie.

Made this using frozen banana chunks and cashew butter and cashew silk.  I added a bit of vanilla and honey, but very little.  It was delicious.    I also added my usual egg based protein powder to give me a filling and long lasting start to the day!

A very quick and delicious smoothie, for breakfast or a quick snack.  I put two small bananas in the freezer, just to get very cold, but not frozen. I use two ice cubes, will used four the next time, one cup of fat-free milk and about one large scoop of peanut butter, and that was my breakfast :-)!!

The first time I made this I did not use frozen bananas and it was way too watery.  Frozen bananas the second time around made a huge difference!  I halved everything except the peanut butter And also made chocolate sauce to line the glass for a fun and tasty treat!  All in my family enjoyed this alternative to ice cream.

Awesome recipe, it tastes like Reese! To add a bit more flavour, I  put 1 cup peanut butter  instead of 1/2 a cup because the bananas kind of takes over the taste of the peanut butter.

Personally, this can be for adults and for kids as someone had said that adults wouldn't enjoy it? I followed the recipe, but instead of Honey I used Vanilla seeing Honey tatste bitter to me. It really helped and gave it an interesting taste. I'll definitely be sharing this with mg family and friends when they come over. :]

Good! I added more ice and more honey because I thought it wasn't sweet enough. And I added more peanut butter because I didn't really taste the peanut butter. I then added chocolate sryup and that put this at a 5 star instead of a 4  star.

I doubled the banannas to lessen the peanut butter taste, plus some cocoa powder for a little bit of chocolate finish.  It was a great last minute treat.

My kids favorite smoothie. I've served it for breakfast, snack, and after sports game treat. I freeze my bananas that are on their way out and use those. I also drizzle a bit of chocolate syrup over the top or a skewer of fresh strawberries on the side.

I substituted milk with soy milk (unsweetened). This is delicious, my new favourite breakfast! The only change I think I will be doing the next time is adding less peanut butter. It tasted just right, but I don't want to run out of it so quickly, it is pretty expensive and also hard to find where I live. Thank you for the recipe! :)

I really liked the smoothie but I have one question. It says that there are 335 calories and it serves four. Is this each smoothie or for the total four smoothies?

This is amazing! It tastes verrry much like a Smoothie King smoothie (Peanut Power Plus especially) which freaked me out in a good way. I used frozen bananas, 1 tsp of vanilla extract (Sarah Jo's recommendations) and, I didn't try it but I think a pinch of cinnamon would add to the flavor. I'm about to start freshman year in college and this is something a student can definitely make, as well as parents with little kids.

It was good for after a workout. It is very peanut-buttery, but it tastes good with the banana. I don't taste any honey in it, so I feel like it could do without. I used frozen bananas so I didn't waste fresh ones and it worked fine. I also used ice, though. I would suggest less peanut butter and adding cinnamon to it. Good recipe, though.

Amazing. But since my blender is small, I use frozen chopped bananas and skip ice. I also add a couple spoonfuls of vanilla no-fat yogurt. Delish!

Great for a quick after school drink or a on the go breakfast. Followed the recipe but wish it was not so runny I used smooth peanut butter and it  worked a treat.

I have been making this for awhile now before finding the recipe here but had to say that I absolutely love this smoothie!
I do add a teaspoon of cinnamon to mine, and occasionally vanilla protein powder depending on if I am making this as a breakfast or just a treat. I do intend to try it out with some oats as well....

This was a delicious snack and would make a nice, filling breakfast smoothie too.  I did not add the honey and it was perfect.  I used lactose free skim milk and would use less next time because it was  a bit thin, more like a glass of milk than a smoothie.

I did it a little differently and it turned out fantastic. Used frozen bananas instead of ice, only added the milk as needed to blend, and used chocolate syrup to taste instead of honey. Holy moley was it delicious!

I recommend using ripe bananas, and no ice or honey.  Also, don't drink the entire thing at once unless you want to have an interesting digestive experience.  Half a batch is plenty for one serving.

the only change I made to this recipe was I added 1 1/2 tbsp pure/fresh honey instead of 2tbsp. It's simple and delicious and refreshing! Will be making for my kids as part of their after school snacks! No pickiness will come from this tasty smoothie!!

Haven't tried this particular recipe, but something similar. (with almost milk) I'm also thinking of freezing the bananas, and then give the smoothie extra time in the fridge to chill. YUM :)

I will definitely make this again, I used just one banana and basically half the amount of everything and it was absolutely delicious. Very creamy and thick, I'm not sure why some people said that theirs was watery, mine was not. I was skeptical using ice cubes, cuz I usually use frozen fruit for my smoothies, but it really was good, could definitely be a dessert.  I'm thinking about adding some cocoa powder  next time.

It was fun to experiment and easy to make. I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy or whipped. It may or may not alter the taste, but otherwise it was okay. Probably wouldn't make again.

I substituted the milk and the peanut butter with almond milk (the vanilla flavored one) and almond butter.  Instead of sugar, I added 3 dates. I only used one cup of ice. A little bit of cinnamon and vanilla extract are great additions as well (optional).

Could be more peanut butter-y and less milk-y.  It was a nice texture and tasted good but I think I will use more peanut butter next time.

This recipe is amazing. Made it to a T, but then switched to Almond milk as I have dairy issues. I actually like it better with almond milk anyway. I renamed the recipe to Gina's Addiction as I ate it once a day for a month when I first found it. Try it I think you will like it.

Like a Muppet I didn't read that this was four servings, tried cramming it into one smoothie shaker which meant that I couldn't fit any ice in, but wow, it didn't last 2 minutes, absolutely delicious to the very last drop, and will be making these again and again, just not so much the next time around ;)

I made a lower calorie smoothie. I used skim milk, powdered peanut butter and sweet n low.

The powdered peanut butter is 1/2 the calories and it helped thicken it a bit. I put 3 tablespoons in mine.

This tasted just like it should. Peanut butter, banana and honey made into a drink. Although I like these flavors together I didn't like drinking it as much and my kids didn't like it at all. They did have fun making it though :)

This is a simple yet  delightful recipe. I made it twice this saying the first time I used frozen bananas this made it to be quite smoothe, but with the second time I used the ice and this made the smoothie chunky and I didn't blend it as much so I would get bits of ice in my mouth which made this extra cool and refreshing. My friends love this recipe and they decided to add other sweet and bitter ingredients which made each unique and delectable. Thank you for this recipe.

Used almond milk, and substituted PB Fit to keep the calories down. Added some Fat Free Chocolate sauce it came out like a chocolate peanut butter banana shake.  Delicious!!!!

Pretty tasty! I halved the recipe as it was just for my two young daughters and myself as a trial run for a treat for my husband's birthday. I added a little vanilla and slightly less peanut butter and honey, and less ice so it wasn't so thick. For next time, I think it needs even less peanut butter or another half banana. Lovely though, thank you!

I only had 1 cup of milk so I added a cup of cold coffee to replace the second cup. The end result was far too sweet for my tastes. I would try again without honey or less banana. I would also add more ice to improve texture.

Followed the recipe as it says, came out really good. I feel like it just slightly calls for a bit too much peanut butter; but that's just my opinion, you might not think the same. (:

This is the second smoothie I've tried and is so far the favorite. I didn't follow the directions exactly mainly because I was too lazy to measure anything out.  I went a little heavier on the peanut butter and a little lighter on the banana, substituting strawberries for some of the bananas ( mainly because it was a mixed frozen bag). It turned out great and I'll definitely be making it again.

What started out as a healthy and quick snack quickly turned into a project.  The balance of flavors and texture was all wrong for me.  I ended up doubling the banana and adding vanilla extract as well as Greek vanilla yogurt to make it taste like banana and thicker. I also added chocolate to kill the strong nut butter taste.  Needs work.

I make this smoothie all the time, one of my son's favorites.  I do however omit the honey, we use a scoop of lactose free ice cream because he likes the taste, frozen banana 1 1/2 cups of PB and he adds a Tblsp of cocoa to his, he said it tastes just like a peanut butter cup.

I halved the recipe and didn't use honey. It was sweet enough as is.  Also I added an envelope of instant oatmeal for kicks. I used a frozen banana for ice. I will probably make this again.

I love this recipe I modified it a bit since I don't like bananas i just used one which I froze so no need for ice. I also used Almond milk instead . No need for sugar since the peanut butter is already sweet . This smoothie was so freaking good!

So yummy! I was looking for something to get rid of my last two bananas and my last bit of peanut butter. This was nearly perfect. I didn't like how liquid-y it was, though so I added another cup of ice. :D

I unfortunately can't drink milk, so I used plain greek yogurt and a splash of water to make sure there was enough liquid in it to blend properly. I skipped the honey as well. 

I think I added a bit too much peanut butter for my taste, but this was definitely something I'll make again. Next time I will probably go with frozen bananas to make sure the smoothie is good and ice cold. I may try a splash of vanilla next time as well, as some seem to be doing.  I'd say that with frozen bananas, the ice ice, and the greek yogurt this would be a fantastic little summer treat. :)

I made this without the honey and added more peanut butter. Also one of my bananas was frozen so I just used less ice. It was delicious!! I definitely would pass on the honey. Great recipe!

Beware, strangely addicting!  I am lactose intolerant so used water instead of milk and it turned out just fine.  Other than substituting water instead of milk, I followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  Afterwards, I added a splash of vanilla and about a half teaspoon of honey and a little more peanut butter...this did it for me.  Loved it.  Personally, I like using fresh bananas because it seems to add a deeper flavor.  I also like using fresh bananas over frozen because I like the texture it gives.  However, when your bananas are at the end of their shelf life it's wonderful to be able to peel, cut into chunks and freeze for later use.  I use the frozen quite a bit too.  Anyways, love this one.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Becca!

Here is what I did. I froze a can of full fat coconut milk in an ice cube tray. I sliced up bananas and froze them on a cookie sheet then stored them in a bag. For the smoothie, I put 2 of the coconut cubes, about 6 frozen slices of banana, 3/4 cup of coconut milk from a carton (I used Silk brand), 2 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter and a teaspoon of maple syrup and blended in my Ninja individual smoothie cup. We all loved it and will be making it often for breakfast.

Yummy!  I also added a splash of almond extract and a little cinnamon.  Left out honey because I didn't have any.

Easy. I used almond soy milk, frozen bananas, no ice and 1.5 teaspoon vanilla in a blender.  Loved it.  Very frothy.

This is an excellent smoothie! I liked that it was not too thick and didn't have that yogurt-tang. My banana was frozen so I skipped the ice. I went easy with the honey because I didn't want it too sweet. I also added a small amount of vanilla protein powder, which I usually do, as well as a little flax seed. Great recipe Becca, and one I'm sure to make again. Thanks!

This was an amazing recipe and I would really recommend it. I used it because we really didn't have all that much stuff for a good smoothie and I really wanted one. It used very little time and supplies. But I also thought that it was a little too thin and whispy. I wish that there was something else to it, because it left me craving something but I have no idea what.

One of my favorites. I had gastric bypass so I drink a lot of low fat and low sugar items. I make this with almond milk or skim and I use a powdered peanut butter (half the calories as regular pb). I love using it as my breakfast or lunch meal replacement.

Very tasty and super simple. Agree with the other reviewers that freezing the bananas and using those in place of ice cubes would thicken it up a bit.

This didn't taste like peanut butter banana. Instead it tasted like peanut butter air. I love it anyway there wasn't anything bad it just didn't match the title. I did add a little pinch of cocoa and cinnamon. It was a little light. I think you could add more banana and make it thicker. The overall smoothie was great and I recommend it. I definitely like the pinch of cinnamon and cocoa( mine was actually mocha powder).

I first had this smoothie at Tropical Smoothie. They make it with a scoop of whey protein.  I used frozen banana, and subbed in almond milk and a scoop of whey protein instead of milk and I did not ad honey or other sweeteners (the protein has a chocolate flavor).  It was really good for after my workout.

I used Vanilla Almond Milk (1 cup regular and 1 cup unsweetened as I ran out of regular) and crunchy peanut butter.  Plan to try chocolate almond milk next.  VERY good.

This was quite tasty. I omitted the honey, it was way sweet already. Also added 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein. Unfortunately I couldn't taste the chocolate, but I double the protein!

I rated this 5 stars with my healthy changes.  I used 3 frozen bananas, sugar free cocoa, fat free plain yogurt, peanut butter with no hydrogenated oils, and just enough milk to allow it to blend (I would have used almond regular milk if I had it.)  I did not need to add honey and the kids love it!  It tastes like a milkshake!!

I added 4 bananas instead of 2.  And because I don't like peanut butter, I changed it to nutella and removed the honey (because nutella is sweet enough). Tastes super yummy.

I made this smoothie for the fiance and I actually tried a different smoothie. He loved the smoothie and downed 2 servings within 5 minutes. I did make a couple adjustments. He wanted to add chocolate to it so we were going to add his chocolate protein powder but when we saw the recipe called for milk, we decided to use his chocolate soy milk instead of the protein powder. He is lactose so we cant use regular milk on him. We omitted the honey because we didnt want it to be too sweet since we used the chocolate milk. We also used almond butter - which is way better than regular peanut butter. It was amazing. I probably would have downed his drink instead of the one I made for myself because it was so tasty! Great job!

Its a nice easy treat.  However the peanut butter taste was a bit overwhelming so next time ill use a little less and maybe add just a touch of chocolate.  Others suggested using frozen bananas instead of ice and that worked out very well.

Awesome!!!!  I made this recipe for me, my two brothers, and my mom.  They all LOVED it!!!!  Thank you Becca for this wonderful recipe!  The only minor modification I made was that I only added 2 tsp of honey instead of 2 Tbsp, but that doesn't matter.  It was just for taste.  YUM!

I followed the recipe for 1 serving exactly and it was perfectly delicious!  I thought it looked a bit thin after blending it but when I tasted it the thickness was fine.  Will definitely be making this again.  I would like to try it with almond butter and almond milk sometime too.

OMG this is soooo good.  I also used banana and frozen banana together, organic powdered milk for half of the milk and 1/2 cup ice cubes. And if I'm honest, I'll tell you I used organic powdered sugar instead of honey.  Makes it nice and thick but cold too. Addictive.

Just made this after seeing it in featured in the newsletter. Easy to make and tastes great. I changed the serving size to 1 and then added a little extra banana vs the half the recipe called for. Came out great.

Good.  We doubled the peanut butter and added a squirt of chocolate syrup.

I make one very close to this.  Using frozen bananas with a little ice (3/4 banana 1/4 ice) and no honey and a shot of chocolate syrup.  My kids love it and so do I.

This is by far our favorite smoothie recipe.  My 5 year old and 2 year old sucked it down super fast!  It is VERY high in calories (half of my daily allowance!) but it keeps me full for hours and hours because it has a good amount of both fiber and protein.  The fact that there isn't any veggies in it and the calorie count is the only reason I won't drink this everyday.

We thought the recipe was okay - not bad but I found it to be too sweet with the honey. The bananas have just enough sweetness and the honey competes with the peanut butter. The only change I made was I froze my bananas prior to using instead of using ice since I don't like icey smoothies.

This was good but not great. In my opinion it needed more peanut butter and if you don't freeze the bananas, the consistency is watery. I was expecting more of a thick consistency. I added some vanilla yogurt to thicken it. I also added twice the peanut butter and some unsweetened cocoa powder. Next time I will use frozen bananas and I'm also intrigued to add a little Nutella as well

I used water instead of milk since I didn't have any, and used agave nectar instead of honey, and almond butter instead of PB, it was EXCELLENT! And a healthier alternative to the original recipe.

You can't take pain meds without food, but you can't eat without pain... Oh, the beauty of wisdom teeth extraction.

This smoothie is a great option right after your wisdom teeth are removed because it doesn't have the small pieces that many kale or fruit based smoothies do, which is my usual smoothie of choice. (Those can get caught in the area of surgery and cause all sorts of issues.) 

It also tastes as good as a milk shake (and I don't say that lightly), but is more nutritious. One serving is nice and filling too, so you don't feel deprived. Thanks for this great recipe.

I rate this about 4.5 stars. It was pretty good. I only had two issues with the recipe. The first was, that the peanut butter taste wasn't that strong as I would like and the second was that it seemed like it needed to be a little sweeter. I used unsweetened creamy natural peanut butter, so it may have contributed to the lack of sweetness. I also wanted a stronger flavor without the additional calories of more peanut butter so I added about 1 Tblsp. of plain cocoa. It created a kind of chocolate peanut butter flavor. I also added additional sweetener with a packet of raw Truvia. I made 1 serving and it yielded almost 1 cup.

I love Peanut Butter and Banana shakes! I always freeze all the bananas in my house that turn brown, as they are too soft and too sweet to eat by themselves. The super sweetness means that you do not need to add honey. Also try using defatted peanut flour for a lower fat version. I like the PB2 brand of peanut flour.

My variation of this is the closest thing I have found to Jugo Juice's "PB & Chocolate" smoothie. 

I first tried the recipe as is and didn't like it with the honey.  
I have tried it with and without ice.  With regular bananas and with frozen bananas.  I feel like even with the frozen bananas, it needs some ice to have a true smoothie texture.

Here is what I settled on:  1 cup of unsweetened almond milk.  1 chunked frozen banana.  1 cup of ice.  1 heaping tablespoon of Adams all natural smooth peanut butter.  It was PERFECT.  And just the right amount for one person.  I might buy some chocolate almond milk to make it taste even more like the Jugo Juice smoothie I love so much.

Great recipe.  I halved the ingredients to make a serving for 2.  Also, used "Almond Breeze Milk" instead of regular milk. TASTES GREAT. Next time I'll add some berries (Blue Berries & Raspberries) for increased flavor.

This sort of grew on me.  I didn't care for it when I first tasted it,  but I didn't hate it so I continued to drink it and I found myself actually enjoying it.  My banana had been refrigerated, not frozen, so I only added a few ice cubes and I did not add any honey.  I wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter.  I still prefer my fruit and yogurt smoothies, but this is a good alternative.

Simple and delicious.  I subbed PB2 for the peanut butter to lower fat and calories and omitted the honey.  For me, there is plenty of natural sweetness from the banana.

YUM! I have a vitamix so I used both frozen banana and ice. I also used vanilla almond milk. Used 1tbs local honey and 2 medjool dates. Vegan Perfection!

I liked this.  I omitted the honey and didn't miss it and added a scoop of chocolate protein powder just to try it.  Was creamy and delicious.

Just made this for the kids. Absolutely delicious!! I used frozen bananas and a few ice cubes for perfect smoothie consistency. Will definitely make this again and again. Yummy!
