I really enjoyed this. A good friend of mine is Columbian and offered this as a alternative to chimichurri. It has WAAY less fat than chimichurri and it tastes great. It is better to make it ahead of time though. That way the flavors have time to mix. I grilled a flank steak and used this on the steak after it was cooked. Thanks!

This is better than the coloumbian restaurant I go to.I added minced garlic. My pepper plant froze so I didn't have any so I just used cayenne for spice. Delicious!

This stuff is great on everything from chips to steak. I was worried about the excessive amount of jalapenos, but it wasn't too hot. I did tone down the zing of the peppers with some Spanish onion.

This was a great with grilled steak. This was a nice alternative to salsa.  And I didn't need to add any salt.  it already had enough flavor to it. Recipe makes more of a party batch than a family batch.

OMG! This is a fantastic recipe. The sauce has the same taste as the sauce my Columbian friends make. A great tomato- less salsa, if you are staying away from tomatoes this summer. Eat it with everything.

My Colombian friends fell in love with this recipe. They can't get enough of it. I made one change that they liked . I use a 1-1 blend of pasilla and jalapeno peppers. Gives a bit more flavor and a bit less heat. The final product needs to be on the salty side.

OMG t5his is so good!.  I was very skeptical but I decided to make it for South American Pot luck.   I did add about 4 cloves of garlic and subbed 1/2 of a red onion and a shallot because I didn't have green onions.  kept everything else the same.  It has a  great bright flavor and I can't wait to bring it tomorrow.  We just ate it on chips.  It would be fantastic on steak or a steak taco, fish or shrimp taco too.

This was great! I halved the recipe because it was just my husband and i. My husband is from Colombia and he loved it! He said the only difference from his mother's is that she puts something red in hers (tomatoes, peppers, who knows?). But we both loved it and had it with our skirt steak and tostones. It wasn't as spicy as you would think. If you enjoy some spiciness, you will love this sauce!

Wonderful stuff - just like the green sauce at a South American restaurant we enjoy eating at.  Not too hot if you remove the seeds and very easy to make.  I left the seeds in once and it was too hot so we toned it down with some roasted tomatillos and poblano peppers and it was good with those additions too.  But the recipe as written is definitely 5 stars in my book - only change I made was leaving out the water, as it was perfect consistency without it.

I don't know what happened, but I didn't care for this. The spice was perfect (subbed 5 serranos for 10 jalapenos, since I had serranos on hand). I think the vinegar is what turns me off from the recipe, even though there isn't much of it. I think next time I'd decrease the amount of vinegar, but that's my own personal preference, not the recipe's fault.

I've made about 6 batches of this.  Love it!  This latest time I left out the water and I added 4 habeneros to kick it up a notch.  Best batch yet.

Isn't this Peruvian Aji though? I always thought Columbian Aji contained tomatoes and Peruvian Aji was more like this. This is tasty, but I prefer lime over lemon and will use limes instead next time.

Loved it! We grow jalapeños in our garden. Needed a recipe that called for a lot of peppers since I didn't want them to go bad. This was perfect! Wonderful taste & we were able to freeze what we didn't use. Will definitely make over & over again
