I love houska! It's a family tradition on my dad's side. Our recipe from great-grandma is hard to decipher (not structured at all), so I am excited to try this. It seems lighter than ours, in a good way--thanks for sharing!
We always add golden raisins and almonds in the batter--maybe 1/4 c each per loaf, to your taste. And we sprinkle almonds on the top. This is SO GOOD warm or toasted. Thank you!

This recipe is hard to rate since I'd give the final product 4 stars, and the recipe itelf 2 stars.  There are discrepancies between the ingredients list and the instructions (salt and the amount of flour).  The dough proportions were much bigger than a grapefruit, orange and tangerine and there was no mention of how big around the dough ropes were supposed to be (mine were about an inch to an inch and a half around which seemed too big). Then the shaping of the dough pyramid was very odd.  I baked it on a baking stone.  The finished product was a rather tasty, slighty sweet breakfast type of bread that reminds me of the Italian pan d'oro eaten at Christmas.  I had to cover the bread with foil about 20 minutes in to the baking time because it browned rather quickly.  I also had to bake it for about 45-50 minutes to fully cook the middle.  Not bad overall, but needs more specific intructions regarding working with the dough, and please fix the discrepancies regarding the flour and salt!
