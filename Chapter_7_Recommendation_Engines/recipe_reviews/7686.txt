Update: I made this cake again today and used the baking method in the recipe; placing the cake in a cold oven. I do not recommend this. The cake was overdone on the top and the exterior was rather chewy. I had to take it out at 50 minutes as it was starting to burn. I am going back to the pre-heated oven. 9/17:Wow, this is fabulous! I used a Duncan Hines butter yellow cake mix plus used 3 bananas, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 cup of sour cream. This was so very moist and so tasty!!! Delicious! I baked for 40 min in a preheated oven and it was perfect! Thanks so much for an easy and tasty cake!

Love this recipe but watch the baking time. I didn't read all the reviews and just set my oven timer for 1 hr as directed in recipe. The cake was black. Had to throw out and start over. Baked second cake for just 35 minutes as directed on cake box. Made with 3 bananas, very moist but not mushy at all. Made a frosting of 1 tub of coolwhip, 1 small pkg of bananacream instant pudding and 1 cup of milk. Sprinkled chopped walnuts on frosting. Took to a dessert pot luck and everyone loved it. Will make again.

this is an awesome cake.  I  made a few small changes.  I had 2 bananas and wanted it moist so I added 1/2 C applesauce and 2 tsp  cinnamon. I made a cream cheese frost: 1 pckg Cream cheese, 1 C butter, 2C confectioner's sugar and 1-2 Tsp vanilla extract.  I put this in the fridge while the cake was baking.  I let the cake cool, then I cut it in half and put 1/3 of the frost on one half of the cake, then I had frozen blueberries, rasberries and strawberries that I put over the frost. then I put the other  1/3 of frost over the fruit. I put the other half over this and covered it with the rest of the frost and grated toblerone dark chocolate over it. tastes like a million dollars after chilling 1 hour in the fridge. thanks its yummmmmy

Definitely worth the 5 stars!  I always have leftover bananas (my kids won't eat them if they have even one spot!) and don't have time for a long complicated recipe.  This really fits the bill, and I was pleasantly surprised how good it came out.  It smells wonderful while cooking.  I pre-heated the oven and baked for 40 minutes which was perfect.  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup choc chips.  I agree with another reviewer, I don't think it needs the chocolate chips, so I won't be doing that again.  It is sweet enough to not need a frosting but is really good with also.  I am so glad I found this recipe and highly recommend it.  We couldn't wait for it to cool in the fridge, we ate it warm from the oven :)  Update:  I made this with a Butter Pecan cake mix and it was just as good, if not better. Tip: if you're short on bananas, you can throw in one of those little applesauce cups (I've done this when I've only had 2 bananas, makes the batter thinner but the cake still turns out great in the end, very moist).

I don't normally review a recipe, but with this one I just had to! I followed it exactley, with just a few additions. Fisrt I added one extra banana than what was called for, and also added a small package of chopped walnuts (poured them into the dry ingredients so they would not fall to the bottom while baking). I was a little nervous about using fresh bananas (I didn't have any ripe ones on hand) But to my surprise it came out AWESOME!!! It tasted like I spent a ton of time and ingredients on it, which is not the truth at all!! I would recommend this recipe to anyone that enjoys banana cake or bread because you just cant beat how good and easy this one is! I will be making this cake from here on out!

I made this and added three bananas and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I baked it in 2 9 inch pans at the time recommended on the box.  I frosted with with a cream cheese and pecan frosting.  It was the best banana cake I have ever made or eaten!!  It tastes very homemade. I made a very complicated one several weeks ago and it can't compare to the flavor and moistness of this cake.  I threw the long recipe away and have replaced it with this one.  
Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This cake was moist and delicious. It was a big hit with the co-workers.I used others suggestions as follows:
I used a preheated 350 degree oven and baked for about 40-45 minutes. 
I frosted it with a mixture of 1 pkg. banana pudding; 1 cup milk; 1 tub cool whip. Topped it with chopped walnuts.

Oh, my goodness!  This cake is so easy to make, and it is so moist and delicious.  I followed one reviewer's recommendation and used three bananas instead of two, and it made it even more moist.  I would not try using four bananas, though.  It definitely did not need a frosting because it is so good as is.  Next time I may try a chocolate cake mix and may stir in some chocolate chips or chopped toasted walnuts to make it even yummier.  :)  One word of caution:  I checked my cake after 54 minutes, and the top looked very brown, although this did not affect the taste.  I would recommend checking after 50 minutes of baking and test for doneness with a toothpick.  This is a perfect dessert to take to any pot-luck function because it is easy to transport also!

Everyone is complaining about this cake browning too quickly. If your oven is like mine, when you turn it on it heats from the broiler unit and the oven unit until pre-selected temperature is reached. So either pre-heat or cover the cake for the first minutes of the oven coming up to temp.
Any ingredients(nuts, choc chips, etc) being added should be tossed in the dry ingredients before being stirred into mixture and that should prevent sinking problems.

I brought this to both a family dinner and then to work and got rave reviews. I also added 3 medium size bananas and made the "frosting" with one small box of instant banana pudding, one cup of milk, and 1 tub of cool whip. After making this several times now, it seems to cook the best and make a better presentation in a bundt pan.

Needs more stars!! "Wonderful" is modest. As justacitygirl suggested I added another banana, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 c. sour cream. I didn't have Duncan Hines Butter yellow cake mix, but made it twice in one week with two different yellow mixes (one was Sugar Free) and just added 1 Tbs. softened butter into the cake batter before adding the bananas and other ingredients. Made it in a dark non-stick bundt pan, so I reduced the oven temp per the cake box instructions (The different types were different temps.) After the first one was so incredibly moist I decided not to even flour my pan on the second one. I came right out and was smoother on the surface. I ate mine plain with nothing added. My husband LOVES frozen whipped topping. He nuked his for a few seconds then generously dolloped the topping on. This cake is DEVINE; naked or not.  :-D  Thx for posting this winner!

Excellent cake!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I did bake it about 40 minutes instead of 60 and it came out perfect. Also I just sprinkled powdered sugar on top instead of frosting. Thanks so much Carolyn!

My daughters love this cake.  I made it as written and didn't frost it.  It was good without frosting, but I may try it again with a cream cheese type frosting.

Excellent cake! The recipe "as is" worked great for me. My 3 yr old was helped in the mashing of the bananas. It was fun making it, fun decorating it, and it tastes GREAT!! :-) Thank you for sharing!

Instead of starting with a cold oven I set my temp at 325 and test with a toothpick when I start to smell the cake. I also bake 2 8" layers and use fresh whipped cream mixed with powdered sugar, vanilla and a stabalizer to fill and ice the cake. I assemble as follows: Split both layers and put 1/2 layer on plate. Top with 1/4" whipped cream and another 1/2 layer. Spread with small amount of cream and sliced fresh bananas. Cover bananas with more cream and 1/2 layer of cake. Top with more cream and last layer of cake. Ice entire cake in whipped cream, cover sides with cake crumbs or finely chopped walnuts. Add a border and a rosette topped with a cherry if desired. This cake is best when it sits overnight.

So Wonderful!!!!  Used a white cake mix, 2 bananas, baking soda, and 1 tesp of vanilla extract.  Preheated oven and baked for about 50 minutes.  I checked it towards the end for doneness.  I did ice the cake, but agree that with icing it is very sweet, would be delicious on its own.  A winner!

Made this recipe using three bananas instead of two. Spread some cream cheese frosting and tossed some mini chocolate chips for decoration. My mom brought the cake to a party and it was a hit.

Great recipe! I made some changes based on other reviews. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil, added 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup sliced almonds and used 3 bananas. It was done perfectly after about 45 min. Very moist! Possibly moist to the point where it could be considered a little mushy, but probably my fault because I added that extra banana. I will be making this again- with one less banana.

To make a healthier version I replaced the oil in the cake mix directions with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. Also used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites (directions asked for 3 eggs).  I might use 3 egg whites next time. Added 1 tablespoon of whole wheat flour to dry ingredients.  Also used whole wheat flour to flour my loaf pan. Baked at 350 degree pre-heated oven for 60 minutes...long cooking time because I used a loaf pan (wanted to resemble banana bread).  Let cool for 15 minutes and took out a pan to cool rest of the way.  I made a brown sugar glaze instead of frosting.  (Followed vanilla glaze recipe but added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of vanilla).  Drizzled that on top.  Less calories and fat than icing. Will make again!!

Very good! This was an easy cake to make. The ingredients calls for only three things but to prepare the batter you will also need eggs, butter and water as listed on the box (Duncan Hines). I'm not familiar with making cake so I thought the cake only called for the three things listed but luckily I had those other items that the batter needed on hand. I used three bananas and for the frosting I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used 8 oz of whipped cream, pkg of instant banana pudding 3.5 oz, and 1 cup of milk. This called for way too much frosting, however. So I'm saving the frosting for another day. I cooked the cake for about 40 minutes and it came out very moist and cooked to perfection. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy for those short on time and is very much a no-brainer.  I'm not a fan of banana breads but didn't know what to do with 3 over-ripe bananas.  I followed the recipe but then added about 1/3 cup of PB2 (it's granulated Peanut Butter) to the cake batter.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan per the instructions on the box.  I didn't have any whip topping on hand but the cake was so moist it didn't need it.  It's a great recipe and definitely a keeper!!

When I first read this recipe I was doubtful that anything soooo easy could actually taste good.  But when I had some very ripe bananas and needed a quick dessert I decided to try it.  WOW!  Is all I can say.  This cake is scrumptious and no one has to know how easy it is. I used a french vanilla cake mix and baked it in a tube pan instead of the 9x13-inch pan. Try sprinkling herseys skor bits on top near the end of the baking time for a nifty variation, they really compliment the banana flavor.  No need to worry about left overs, every crumb disappears in a flash!

I made this today with 3 bananas and I baked it at 350 in a preheated oven for 45 min. It turned out very good with a cream cheese frosting.  I will use this again. I took it to a community club dinner and it was a hit.

Wow! This is outstanding. I almost felt guilty making this cake and passing it off as homemade because of how easy it is. But I used three bananas (small ones) and baked for 40 min. at 350. It came out perfect, moist, and most importantly, lost the "boxed cake" taste. My kids said, "Mom, make this for my birthday cake!". For icing, I used sugar free banana cream pie pudding mix, 1 cup skim milk and 8 oz. lite cool whip. It was so good and was gone in less than 24 hours!!!!!

This was very good and easy to make. I must admit I was a bit surprised. I made as directed. I followed the cooking instructions except that my cake was done in 20 minutes. This cake was so moist warm and cold. We all loved it.

I did preheat the oven to 350. I used three bananas instead of two, and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. It was done after about 35 minutes and SO good! I used a cream cheese frosting, which was very good but a little bit heavy. Next time I make this cake (and there WILL be a next time) I'll use a mixture of Cool Whip w/ banana cream pudding like one of the other reviewers suggested. With these little changes/additions, this recipe is SO easy and very moist and yummy.

This was superb.  I made some changes as recommended by others.  I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Also, I wanted a layer cake, so I baked two 9" layers at 350 (I preheated) for about 28 minutes.  I had made up a batch of Cool Whip/banana pudding mix for the frosting, but when I tasted the crumbs after leveling the layers, I didn't think the Cool Whip would be the best accompaniment.  So, I made up a batch of cream cheese frosting (8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 3 cups powdered sugar) and used that.  My husband, who was all ready for the Cool Whip version, agreed after he ate it that the cream cheese version was absolutely perfect and the cake simply couldn't be any better.  I made it the night before and it was perfectly moist - but not at all mushy or wet - when served the next evening.  Thanks so much.  I will use this again!

I love this recipe.  I have made it 5 times in the last 3 weeks, giving much of it to my family and friends to sample.  It is soooo easy and absolutely delicious. I vary the amount of bananas according to the size of banana. I've used 2 or 3. I make a standard butter cream icing & it just adds to the flavor. Refrigerating it is a must to get the best texture & flavor. This is a KEEPER!!!!!

Wonderful is an understatement! It's so easy to make,moist and delicious. Many of the reviews said to use 3 bananas. Since I didn't have 3 I added about 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce for the extra moisture. Very yummy. I used a package of banana pudding using 1 cup of milk and then added whipped topping for the frosting.Great way to top off this fabulous cake. I too preheated my oven and baked until a toothpick came out clean, about 35 minutes.Will definatly make this again.

I used chocolate cake mix and a cup of chocolate chips. and I put cream cheese frosting on top. It was a great hit. I bet strawberry cake mix would be good with it too.

Great cake. When preparing cake mix, I replaced the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce.  Used 2 whole eggs and one egg white.  Used 2 1/2 bananas.  Turned out great.  Daughter loved it.

Very good cake and I'm not even a big banana fan.  Made with two large bananas but will try three next time.  Baked in preheated oven, since it was hot from cooking dinner, and followed the time on the cake mix box using a cake tester until it came out clean.  Never got a chance to frost it either.  Might try it with nuts too.

My family LOVED this cake.  My 13 year old son said I should make this on the Food Network (!)...I baked it in a preheated oven for approx 40 minutes (do not overbake), frosted with cream cheese icing and garnished with toasted pecans.  A quick dessert fit for company.  Thanks!

Yummy!!! I've made it twice and it came out great each time. I made it as written, preheating the oven and baking for 40 minutes.  The second time, I used devil's food cake mix, 3 bananas and replaced oil/butter with applesauce...Lower fat and delicious!! Of course I then frosted it with a peanut butter frosting from this site...WOW!

LOVE THIS!!  Every time I catch butter recipe yellow on sale I buy it.  I also throw over-ripe bananas in the freezer, peel and all.  That way I always have the ingredients on hand to make this cake.  It's fine without frosting but I really prefer it with the coolwhip/banana pudding/cup of milk frosting.  You just have to really whip the pudding in the milk for at least 2 minutes to work out all the lumps.  I sprinkle walnuts over the top so that picky kids can take them off.  I've made this in a bundt pan for company and a 9x13 just for us.  Love it either way.

these are wonderful.  they're fluffy and moist.  i made two batches.  one with marble cake and the other with yellow.  the one with marble cake, i separated the two flavors and made the chocolate cake into an inner layer (i was using a bake and fill set).  i also put chocolate morsels and nuts into the inner layer.  it was fantastic.  the marble cake was much more enhanced in the banana flavor, even when eaten without the chocolate layer.  in addition, i took the advice of others and frosted the cake with a mixture of pudding and whip cream.  the frosting is delicious alone, and the cake is too, but they do not compliment each other.  the frosting is too light for this cake.  maybe a cream cheese frosting would be better.

Great recipe! Super easy banana cake recipe and a huge hit. I made the cake batter just as the directions say, but baked it in a preheated oven like any other cake. I adjusted my baking time dependent on what size pan I was using.

I rarely give reviews but I had to on this. I cannot believe how great it tasted from a mix & I've made several cakes from scratch & this one actually hada stronger banana flavor! Used Duncan Hines mix (used milk instead of water, 1/2C Oil & 3 eggs). Used 3 frozen thawed bananas mashed with 1 tsp cinnamon. I used the juice from the bananas as part of my water (milk). Baked in 9X13 pan for about 38 mins. Topped with a buttercream frosting from this site & used banana extract for a banana buttercream. So incredibly moist it is the best banana cake ever! Could eat without frosting actually. Try it, I couldn't believe it!

I used white cake mix and made it according to the package directions after adding the banana/baking soda combo.  Shared it at work and got tons of compliments on the flavor and moistness of this cake.   Topped it with cream cheese frosting.  I think it would have been great sprinkled with crushed walnuts as well, but didn't have any on hand.  So easy, I'll definitely be making this again.

just one determined woman who decided to use what i had on hand to bake a cake.  i had the duncan hines yellow cake mix and the ripe bananas so I got busy making the cake according to instructions.  Decided to get creative and added OJ for the liquid in recipe and apple sauce for the oil.  Then sprinkled in some nutmeg and some lemon juice plus bananas.  tasted batter and something was missing so I added a box of sugar free banana pudding and baked in tube pan.  Left cool and iced with brown sugar drizzle.  Got huge raves and it was lovely to look at and better to eat!  Think outside the box...that is how great recipes are created.  Thanks for sharing a great basic recipe.

Wonderful simple recipe! I substituted applesauce for the oil to make it healthier and used 3 bananas. Since my bananas weren't ripe, I put them in the oven cold and heated it up to 300 degrees until the bananas turned brown. The cake was wonderfully moist and enjoyed by all my friends!

I made some changes based on feedback and this cake was a huge success.  Very moist and flavorful.  I added an extra banana and 1/2 cup of sour cream and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I then made it in 2 round cake pans and iced with a cream cheese frosting.

A hit with my 7 year old! I made into muffins and mini loafs. I added a handful of mini chocolate chips. My chips sunk to the bottom but I think I would add them again. I didn't frost so they provided just a small bit of extra sweetness. ETA: my loaves are crumbly and falling apart when I try to cut them.

I used 3 large fresh (not "very ripe") bananas, added a handful of chopped walnuts & baked it 40-45 minutes in a preheated oven.  I iced it with cream cheese frosting and it was great!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  My husband is diabetic and loves cake, I have been buying the Pillsbury reduced sugar cake mixes for him and he really likes the devils food one.  His favorite cake is banana and I tried my own recipe substituting splenda and it was not the greatest, but he ate it anyway.   It is very hard to adapt a homemade cake recipe to a splenda version, after all it is the sugar that helps give cake the volume.   He told me he had four ripe bananas and was in the mood for a banana cake.  I found this recipe with such wonderful reviews and decided to try it.  I made it exactly except for I added 4 bananas and baked it in a preheated 350 oven for 40 mins.  He likes  Cool Whip on it, but the next time Im gonna try the sugar free banana pudding, milk, and Cool Whip frosting for it.  It turned out wonderful.  I'm so grateful that I now have a banana cake I can make out of a mix that is sweetened with splenda.  Pillsbury only has white, yellow, and devils food reduced sugar cake mixes.  I look every week at the cake mixes, hoping to find a different flavor.  Now I have a banana cake mix that is WONDERFUL!!   Im sure I will be making this one often,  he already has more bananas set aside to ripen for his next cake!

Great, easy recipe. Made in 2 9-inch rounds for a layer cake. Added an extra banana and 1/3 cup of reduced fat sour cream which made for a really moist cake. Frosted with cream cheese frosting I by JJ. Also layered in an extra sliced banana on top of the frosting for extra banana flavor.

Very good and easy cake!  I used 3 medium bananas and milk instead of the water.  I also preheated the oven and baked for 35 minutes.  It came out perfect!  I used a cream cheese frosting, but it's so good it wouldn't need a frosting.

I baked this in a tube pan (not the angelfood pan) and it turned out wonderful! Like most others I added my favorite spices: ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice. I also used the 50% less sugar yellow cake mix. Excellent!

Excellent, very light and moist.  I used the butter yellow cake mix, and three bananas.  I will definitely make it again. I brought it to work and it is disappearing fast!  I frosted it with banana instant pudding made with 1 cup of milk, and then folded in an 8 oz. container of coolwhip.

A great way to jazz up yellow cake mix.  I used 3 ripe bananas.  I also substituted apple sauce instead of oil in the cake mix. After the cake cooled completely,  I topped with a mixture of: 1 cup milk, instant banana cream pudding and 1/2 tub of cool whip. Topped with walnuts. My boyfriend said this is his new favorite.

I'm shocked at how fantastic this recipe is. I don't even like bananas or banana cake/bread much, but a friend of mine requested it for his birthday so I gave it a try. These are so tasty!!! Moist and yummy, not too sweet but sooo good!! I did adjust my baking temp a little lower, because my oven cooks hot. Just watch them carefully, they go from done to over done quicly.

Yummy use for blackening bananas - I think these were the key for such a moist cake.  I added a third banana and some cinnamon into the batter and frosted with store-bought cream cheese icing.  My co-workers couldn't get enough of it!

I can't believe how good this cake is!  It's just out of the oven, I let it cool just enough so I could taste it, and I am WOWed!  I usually by-pass recipes that call for a cake mix. But, I'm crunched for time this week and was asked to bring something baked for our school's fundraiser.  So I decided to try this quick and easy recipe this morning to save time - I couldn't be more pleased with the results.  I pretty much followed the recipe ingrediants, though I think I used 3 bananas (hard to say for sure, they were already mashed and frozen - measured 1 1/3 cups),  plus I added 1 cup mini chocolate chips.  Then I baked it in a PREHEATED oven (despite what the recipe says) and started checking the cake with a toothpick at 30 minutes - the cake was nicely done at 40 minutes. It was perfect!  The chocolate chips did sink to the bottom, but I'm thinking about serving it "upside down" because it actually looks better that way! I will not be frosting this cake - it's tastey as is and I think the frosting may make it too sweet.

Truly wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly but pulled the cake out about 5 min early.  Cake looks dark early on but doesn't taste burned.  I used a  butter recipe cake mix this time, and I'm thinking french vanilla might be even better.  The butter recipe is perfect, though, for those who like their cake a little less sweet and more like banana bread.  This will definitely be a staple cake for me.  It's so easy, and everyone loved it.

Oh my, this cake is wonderful! The only change I made was to substitute applesauce for the oil called for on the box. Makes it very moist & cuts down on the calories. I frosted it with "satiny chocolate glaze" from this website & topped that off with chopped walnuts. Excellent!

I really liked it. I used lemon cake mix instead of yellow, because that is what I had in the cupboard. This is an easy-to-fix, tasty dessert. It has the right amount of sweetness and so-o-o-o moist!

Made this today and it was delicious.  I added about a hand full of chopped pecans to the dry cake mix as others suggested.  Had three over ripe bananas so used three instead of two.  Also did not start in a cold oven I baked it in a preheated oven for about 40 minutes.  This is moist enough not to use frosting.  This is a keeper!

this is the best banana cake. I used three bannas and it came out great. I folowed the others advice by pre heating the oven first. I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and everyone wanted the recipe. I think I like this better than banana bread.

This is a wonderful banana cake.  It's a big hit every time I make this.  My son asks me to make this for his birthday every year and every year someone is asking me for the recipe and when I give it to them they can't believe how easy it is.  I too add a 1/2 cup applesauce, dash of cinnamon, and make a frosting with a tub of cool whip, milk, & small package of pudding and top all of that with fresh berries (strawberries/blue berries).  YUM!

Easy and delicious and a great way to use up browning bananas.  I follow the directions for the batter (sometimes I add an extra banana), but I just cook the cake according to the directions on the box.  The cake comes out perfectly moist and delicious.  I have made this maybe a half dozen times, and every time I've served it, someone has asked for the recipe.  Yum.  It's good glazed or frosted or just plain.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.

I agree with everyone, this is delicious and easy. My changes were to add another banana and the same spices you would use for pumpkin bread.
Also I used the frozen bananas I put in the freezer
before they go bad.

This is a very simple tasty recipe. I followed it to a T with the exception of the baking pan. I put mine in a bundt pan (dark coated) and baked until toothpick came out clean (about 40 minutes). After flipping the cooled cake onto a plate I couldn't wait to dig in. Unfortunately, even though it poked done there was a thin layer on the bottom that seemed like it needed additional baking time - a tad gooey even though the cake was dark like it looked overcooked. That was because of the dark pan. I will try this again some day using the pan it calls for!

Excellent cake!! The only reason I rated it four stars is because I added a couple things not in the recipe that made it a five-star cake. I used three rather than two VERY ripe bananas, and for the topping I combined a large container of cool whip and two small boxes of instant vanilla pudding (prepared). It tasted exactly like a cake version of banana pudding! Everyone loved it, and it was so easy too!!

Simple way to use up ripe bananas.  My kids eat as muffins without frosting or make up coolwhip/vanilla pudding frosting and it is perfect on the cake.

Very easy to put together, I preheated the oven and baked for approx. 40min, tested with a toothpick that came out clean.  It was very moist and we did not want to frost it with rich icing. So I used whipped cream from a spray can on each piece. I put it in the refrigerator. The banana pudding with cool whip sounds yummy for creamy icing that I know I have got to try:):)

AMAZING! Followed the instructions, used 3 very ripe bananas, added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of pineapple extract, tiny splash of coconut extract, and about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of finely chopped almonds. Kept an eye on them while they were baking and the mini bundt cakes were ready in about 20 min and round cake after 35 min. No frosting needed!

I followed the reviews that said to bake the cake according to box instructions and the middle was not done. I then re-read the recipe and it says to put the cake in an UN-preheated oven for an hour. So I am going to try doing it that way next time. But we just cut out the gooey middle and ate the edges, which were VERY good.

I did not have a yellow cake mix on hand, so I used a white one and added one package of vanilla instant pudding (dry)...to make it a "Banana Pudding Cake".  It turned out quite well.  I frosted it with a nutty cream cheese frosting.

This really is a wonderful banana cake!  It has everything it takes to be wonderful -- it is easy, uses food that you almost always have on hand, and it tastes delicious!  I used the frosting others recommended: one small box of banana cream instant pudding mixed with one cup of milk, and then fold in an 8 oz tub of whipped cream.  The only change I made was to bake the cake as directed on the box, and it was done perfectly.

Airy, light and unbelievably delicious when paired with "Rich Chocolate Frosting"!  Next time I will add more bananas, only because the taste was a little TOO light for my preference.  This recipe is simple and wonderful, thank you!

I followed Butterfly Flutterby's advice when making this cake.  I also used Duncan Hines Butter Cake Mix, and I added 1/2 cup sour cream, and 5 bananas instead of 3.  I baked it in a dark bundt pan at 325 degrees for 45 minutes.  This was so moist I thought it wasn't cooked, but it did have the crumb texture of a baked cake.  This was soooo good.  I plan to drizzle with a cream cheese frosting and a sprinkling of walnuts the next time I make this.  I forot to add the baking soda and this still came out great.  The batter almost filled my bundt pan, however, the cake didn't rise too much, so I was lucky.  Thank you Carolyn, for a great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I made this cake, baking it only 40 minutes,  That was the right amount of time....although, once out of the oven it fell like a brick.  Still tastes great and is light, but not lofty.  I am not used to making a cake using a mix, so this may have been the issue.    But the taste is wonderful.

Someone really needs to change the cooking time on this recipe!  I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and what a problem that is. The cooking time is to long.  I don't know the person who posted this recipe, but it must be a type error.  The cake is good but watch it or it will be black when you take it out.

I am so happy I had those super ripe (or as my kids would say "rotten")bananas I couldn't part with.  Not wanting the same old same old, I searched for a cake...WOW so glad I did.  My kids begged for a second piece.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cooking time.  My oven was already at 175 from baking something earlier so I cut the cooking time to about 48 minutes.  This is a keeper!

I really like this recipe. It's super moist and bananalicious! I've baked this cake several times and I prefer it over banana bread. The cake does tend to sink in the middle. Trying to correct this, I added a T. of baking powder to my latest batch. It rose better, but the cupcakes made in stand-alone muffin liners (no muffin tin needed) overflowed and were lopsided. Perhaps I overmixed the batter. The cupcakes I made with the same batter in a metal muffin tin with paper liners worked best. They rose uniformly, were not lopsided, but not domed either. I filled these pretty full. Perhaps the heat from the metal helped with the even baking. Frosting would help cover a multitude of sins, but the cake is sweet enough on it's own and it really doesn't need it. Just a light dusting of powdered sugar on the cooled cake is all that's needed. If I were to frost it, I would choose either Cool Whip, pudding, or a combination of the two. In my opinion, buttercream or cream cheese frosting would be way too heavy and sweet. Maybe I'll try a bundt pan next. Do give this recipe a try, it's absolutely delicious! UPDATE: I tried making the cake according to the package directions and then stirring in the mashed bananas with baking soda. It rose beautifully!

I just made this recipe today. It is all gone already. I did do some changes. I used 3 bananas because we love them. I also used sour cream in place of the oil and that made the cake EXTREMELY moist. I also topped it with a vanilla frosting recipe I found off here. PERFECT!!! Will become a favorite here!

Use carrot cake mix; add cinnamon to mashed bananas; pre-heat oven according to cake mix directions and cook for 32 mins (cake mix directions).   Use cream cheese instant pudding and 1 cup milk; mix, then add 1/2 tub of cool whip for icing.

This cake came out wonderful.  I always read the reviews prior to preparing the recipe.  So I also fillowed the cake instructions, then used 3 bananas with baking powder and cinnamon.  Very moist, the cream cheese frosting was a perfect addd.

Very moist cake!  I used 3 bananas, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 c of sour cream per other reviewers' suggestions.  I used the Vanilla Glaze recipe to pour over.  I baked this in a chrysanthemum bundt pan.  It was such a pretty cake.  Had enough leftover batter to make a smaller loaf of banana bread.  This recipe is a keeper!

Thanks Carolyn for this recipe. I baked it this weekend for a bazaar and it was a HUGE hit that the local restaurant down the street has asked me for the recipe. Who knew something so simple could have been that good. I actually used a really large circular pan for a pretty large cake, and it only took about 15 to 20 mins to cook so for those of you trying this for the first time, just keep an eye on the cake and keep your toothpicks handy. Also I accidentally forgot to put the baking soda and it didn't take anything away from the cake. Also I used Banana Butter Icing by another girl named carol. People told me the cake was better than a banana milk shake...

This is my second review.  I made this with Duncan Heins Banana cake mix, added three bananas and a dash of cinnamon powder.  I also added walnuts and raisins.  I followed the bake time on the box.  It was so good!  I will definitely make this again.

Very nice recipe for a light and fluffy banana cake. I would recommend this - simple and easy. I do think however the banana flavor is subtle, since even with me adding a 1/2 tsp of banana extract it still wasn't overwhelmingly banana tasting. Nice base for a more complex tasting frosting. In my case I made cupcakes and filled with marshmallow cream and topped with peanut butter buttercream - essentially a fluffernutter. Yum.

Sorry for 4 stars ... this *was* a good cake, but it didn't bowl me over.  Very light and moist ... I think perhaps I was expecting a dense gooey cake with intense banana flavor.  I too, used 3 bananas and a tsp of cinnamon ... but to me, the banana flavor was rather subtle, and (as noted above), light and fluffy, rather than rich and gooey.  Good cake, easy to make, and I'll probably make again.

This is a very good cake recipe. The banana flavour is even better the next day. I did use 3 bananas, and did preheat my oven. I used a large round cake pan, and it took approx 50 mins. to cook. I didn't have any frosting, but it really doesn't need it. The kids loved it, and it is great with a cup of tea! Thanks for a great cake!

It is wonderful, but what was the purpose for starting in a cold oven and baking for an hour? Totally unnecessary and an hour is way too long. Just bake like a regular cake at 350 for about 40 minutes as another reviewer said. And the banana cream pudding frosting is outstanding on it (instant banana cream pudding mix with one cup milk, folded into a tub of Cool Whip or whipped cream). Top individual slices with a dried banana chip or chopped nuts. This is one of our new favorite cakes, thank you very much! Simple and spectacular!

This cake is FANTASTIC! I used 3-4 bananas. Preheated oven and cooked 40 minutes. This time I decided to make homemade chocolate frosting! I have made this cake at least once a month since I found the recipe. One of the best cakes ever. As good as homemade. Everytime it gets better

Very yummy!
I used 1 whole egg and 2 whites, plus applesauce to make the cake. I added cinnamon, a handful of chocolate chips and 1tbsp of Nesquik to the mashed bananas (used 2 1/2 - what I had). It came out great and moist. Baked on preheated 350F for 35-40 min.

Used 3 bananas, applesauce instead of oil and chocolate cake mix (the only cake mix I had on hand) instead of the one called for in the recipe.  Excellent, low-fat cake.  Very moist and delicious.  Next time, I will use a white or yellow cake mix.

This is a fantastic recipe that's simple to make and delicious!  Like many of the other reviewers, I used 3 ripe bananas for the cake.  I also preheated my oven and baked the cake for about 45 minutes.  I also used another reviewer's frosting idea of instant banana pudding mix, small container of Cool Whip, and milk. The frosting recipe called for 1 cup of milk, but I only used 1/2 cup of milk. The cake with this frosting was an absolutely scrumptious and delicious treat! I will definitely be making this again and again!

The easiest banana cake, but also delicious.  Easy to whip up at the last minute.  Use the frosting made from 1 package banana instant pudding mixed with 1 cup milk; fold in  small cool whip.  You won't be disappointed.

This cake is wonderfully good.  I preheated my oven and baked my cake for 45 minutes like others suggested.  It came out moist & delicious.  I didn't have any powdered sugar so I used "Mom's Buttercream Frosting" found on this site.  If you don't have shortening, you can sub for butter, which others prefer to do.  I haven't tried to sub butter yet but I will next time.

So light and delicious...and easy! What a great way to use overripe bananas. 45 minutes was enough cooking time. Frosted with plain cool whip. The banana flavor in the cake was just perfect.

I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake (has 1 C pudding).  Added 3 bananas.  I used a 9x13 pan.  Baked at 350 for 38 minutes.  Frosted with the Dream Whip frosting (on the box), but added vanilla.  Simply the best recipe!  So moist.  I wouldn't ruin it with chocolate chips if I were you!

Very light, moist, and tasty.  Especially easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked for about 50 minutes in a non-preheated oven.  The top will get a little brown, but don't worry about it.  Topped with powdered sugar so as to not overpower the banana taste.  Tastes like banana bread, but lighter and sweeter.

Gorgeous!!! I've made this several times now, and have had spectacular results every time. I add mini chocolate chips to the cake mix and use the previous reviewers suggestion of icing it with a mixture of cool whip and banana cream pudding, sprinkled with chocolate chips on top. Dee-lish!! Thanks so much for sharing this one, it's a keeper!

to prevent the chocolate chips from going to the bottom, toss them in flour then add to the batter.
works with nuts too.

This is so easy to make and the cake is light and moist with just the right amount of banana flavor. I think it was even better the next day. I baked mine for about 47 minutes and it was perfect.

I only had a chocolate cake mix so I used that.  And I added a cup of chopped walnuts.  The cake came out great.  Try this cake for a quick and easy dessert.  Good just by itself no frosting.

I made this today, I used white cake because that is what I had, My bananas were not ripe, I added a teaspoon of banana extract along with the vanilla. I also preheated the oven and used a 9x13 pan it took 35 minutes at 350. It turned out perfect, moist and great flavor, I frosted it with brown butter frosting. Perfect !!  I will l absolutely make this again

I discovered that my ripe bananas were so ripe they were unusable!  So - still wanting to use my butter pecan cake mix - I added a very scant 3/4 cup of apple butter in place of the bananas + about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I completely forgot about the baking soda - but it came out great - great flavor - perfect served warm with vanilla ice cream for our movie night tonight!

I preheated my oven and baked in a 9x13 glass pan for exactly 45 minutes - came out perfect!

What a great way to use those leftover bananas!  Easy to make.  I added 3 bananas, walnuts and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes. I sampled a piece without frosting but because of my sweet tooth, I will frost it.  Definitely going to be keeping a box of cake mix on hand and trying different flavor combos.  This is a keeper!  Try it,  you won't be sorry.

I am baking this cake right now.  I followed instructions and put the cake in the cold oven.  Before the oven reached proper temp, i checked the cake to find it burning and smoking on the top layer while still battery on the bottom.

Delicious! Moist! Full of flavor! I substituted butter for the oil in the cake mix. I read other reviews and preheated oven and only cooked for 35-40 mins. I made the icing listed in one of the reviews. I took it to work for my boss birthday and he ate 3 pieces back to back. I will be making this again soon

Delicious!  I used a Betty Crocker Butter Yellow cake mix (used butter instead of oil).  I did add cinnamon as many of the other reviewers did.  I made mine into cupcakes instead of a single cake and did preheat the oven and followed the baking directions on the box as others suggested. The cupcakes turned out light, fluffy, moist and delicious.  Was planning on frosting them, but my kids (age 5 and 7) ate half of them before I even made the frosting.  At that point, decided to save the calories that frosting would have added and we're just eating them like muffins.

Good & fast recipe vs. from scratch.  Family loved it.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla (actually bourbon vanilla but regular will work fine too).  I baked in a 10x10 cake pan so it was a little taller.  Definitely need to watch the cooking time because it cooked faster (about 45 min).  I made a nice buttercream frosting for it and put in refrigerator for at least one hour prior to serving.  Will make again.  :)

This cake turned out great!  My family enjoyed it too.  I added three bananas, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, baked in a pre-heated oven at 350 and check it at 25 minutes.  Frosted with a cream cheese pecan frosting as suggested in the reviews.  Very yummy!  Great way to use up very ripe bananas.

Made this cake today, exactly as directed, except that I DID preheat the oven and baked the cake for 38 minutes (which is what the box said).  It turned our perfect.  I made a homemade cream cheese frosting (1 pkg cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 c brown sugar, 2-3 c powdered sugar, depending on how sweet you want it).  I added some banana flavored extract to the frosting and it was soooooo good.  My family loves it.  Will probably never make banana break again to use up ripe bananas.  Thanks!!

I was pleasantly surprised when I found and used this recipe to use up some bananas and a cake mix that had been sitting in my cupboard for a while.  It turned out as such a wonderful light texture!  Although I am usually a "from scratch" baker, I think I will start keeping a box of cake mix around just for this purpose.  It was so simple, yet a delicious result.

I've made this cake several times and I never followed the bake time in the recipe. I simply bake as directed on the cake mix. It has come out perfect. I typically add an extra egg for a richer cake, and I have at times added up to 4 (small-medium) sized ripe bananas (just to use them all) and the cake came out very moist. I ice the cake with the cream cheese frosting recipe that I also found on this site..it's amazing. Another type of frosting I have used is a small package of either banana flavored or french vanilla instant pudding, 1 cup of milk, and 1 regular sized tub of coolwhip mixed together for frosting...amazing!

This is a super easy, super fast recipe which happens to be very good.  I adjusted the recipe and used 3 bananas which was the perfect amount.  I made my own frosting using cream cheese, banana pudding, 1/2 & 1/2, confectioners sugar, and 1 mashed banana.  It was a delicious topping to this cake.  I got rave reviews.  I will for sure keep this in my file and make over and over again.

Delicious! This doesn't store well for very long because the bananas turn a very unappealing black, but the flavor is wonderful. Everyone raved about it. It's the most moist cake I've ever had. I followed other suggestions and used three bananas. I also used a mixture of vanilla pudding and cool whip for the frosting. Soooo good.

This recipe is THE BOMB! Super easy to make. Followed directions #1 and #2 except I DID preheat the oven and baked according to the package directions (about 25 minutes).
 
Cooled the cake, then made vanilla pudding according to the package directions and folded in a tub of Cool Whip...YUMMERS!

As many have stated, this cake recipe is great.  Added 2.5 ripe bananas instead of 2.  Preheated oven and cooked 40 minutes.  For the topping, prepared a small box of instant vanilla pudding with 1 cup of milk and then folded 3/4th of a small tub of cool whip into it.  Came out great and got many positive reviews from those who ate it.

Wow!  So good.  I added a couple tablespoons of peach preserves to the batter so that it wouldn't be an overwhelming banana flavor.

so quick and easy! It was DELICIOUS! My family ate this in a day because we couldn't put it down! I used Betty Crocker yellow cake and topped it with butter cram frosting. This is a wonderful cake recipe!!

Excellent fool proof recipe. Thank you so much. I love having a quick way to prepare our favourite food and banana cake is a favourite with this family. The kids and I loved this recipe. I didn't change anything and it was yummy. I recommend it.

This recipe is SO easy and SO yummy.  I have made it too many times to remember because it is such an easy way to use overripe bananas.  It is a hit every time I share it with people.  I usually add an extra banana and I make my own frosting with cream cheese, confectioners sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and a spoon or two of sour cream.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

this was amazing!  I don't know how something so simple can be so delicious but it was.  Dense and moist, wonderful flavor!  I added choc chips to one pan, will not do that again as its not needed.  Fabulous!

I was looking to make a cake that was different for my cousins b-day party.  Let me tell you, this cake was a huge hit.  I used the Pilsbury butter recipe yellow cake mix and the cake was so moist.  For the frosting I mixed 1 container Mascarpone cheese with 1-3/4 cup powdered sugar.  I then topped the cake with walnuts and did a border of banana slices around the edge of the cake.  It looked so good, and not too shabby for being home made.  The cake was so delicious and we didn't even have any crumbs leftover.  I even got several requests to make this cake for other family members b-days.  One change I made to the recipe was baking it for 45 minutes.  I'm glad I did because I think 1 hour would have been too long.

I used a box of spice layer cake, and added @ 1/3 cup of sour cream, a dash of nutmeg, @ a tsp. of cinnamon and @ 1/2 cup chopped pecans along with the tsp. of baking soda.  I also used 3 med. sized bananas, and prepared the cake mix according to directions.  I baked in a preheated 350 oven for the recommended baking time on the package.  I made 2 round (9") cakes.  When cooled, I frosted them with a basic cream cheese frosting.  Delish!

A keeper! Great tasting cake and so easy. I just added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and used 3 way ripe banana's. I also baked it using the cake box recommendation and tested it for doneness .   I made cream cheese frosting to top it with. My husband loved it and said it gets even better every night! He wants me to make it again for the holidays. Here is the frosting recipe I used: two 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter softened, 2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, it is from Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site.   It is not a sweet recipe, so adjust to your own taste. We prefer the recipe as is because it goes well with the cake. Make sure the cheese is room temp to make for easy blending. I store the cake in the refrigerator.

I made these into cupcakes using 3 bananas instead of two. I just ate one and it was really good.  Different when you are used to banana bread though.  I plan on frosting with cream cheese frosting.  This is a VERY light cake.  I also baked it according to the package directions-rather than using the cold oven method.

I followed the recipe but used 3 ripe bananas, 1 cup sour cream and a dash of cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. I threw in a small handful of chocolate chips.I baked according to the directions on the box and added about 7 minutes. I used Sharon Gerstman's buttercream icing and decorated with fresh strawberries and blueberries. I took the cake to a Red Hat party and it was a great hit. Not a crumb was left!! I'm baking it again for hubby's birthday this weekend. Fantastic!

Great recipe, I had two bananas I had to do something with.  I added 1/2 cup applesauce and 2tsp cinnamon like someone else suggested and did the cream cheese frosting.  I baked at 350 for 45 min. It was GREAT,a keeper.

Fabulous.  There is a restaurant in our town that serves my husband's favorite banana cake.  He says that this one is better.  I used 3 bananas and baked it in a preheated oven.  I frosted it with the banana pudding/1 C milk/cool whip as suggested by other reviewers.  Topped it with chopped walnuts.  I still can't believe that a cake mix was used to make this wonderful cake.

This was a huge hit!  I made it in a tube pan and baked it for about 45 min. but it really could have used another 5 min in the oven.  I served it with fresh real whipped cream and no one could believe it was not from scratch.

I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe except the 1 hour bake time. I followed the time on the box instead. It was very moist and sweet enough to not need frosting. My one mistake was frosting it with whipped topping. Instead just placing a dollop of whipped topping on each serving as ready to eat is probably a better method. Otherwise I got a lot of compliments on this rich and simple recipe!

Wonderful, indeed!  Used 3 bananas, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon per others' suggestions.  Very moist and great with whipped cream!  May try a coconut or buttercream frosting next time.

This is a delicious recipe! I made them as cupcakes with 2 bananas that weren't totally ripe and a little bit is apple sauce, and it came out wonderfully. Some people were turned off by the fact that they were banana cupcakes, but after trying them, people LOVED them! A great all around recipe, especially with chocolate frosting.

It was my turn to make a cake for a co-workers birthday, and she requested a banana cake- which I had not heard of- but everyone loved it! It was moist with good flavor, I addded a splash of banana extract to ensure good flavor. I topped it with peanut butter frosting from this site (her request as well!).

This is a really good and very easy cake to make.  The only things that I do different is I use Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Banana Supreme cake mix and use three bananas instead of two.  I top with cream cheese frosting that I add a half of mashed banana to. Really really good!

I give this 5 stars because this is soooo easy and very tasty.  I used my Pampered Chef Mini Muffin Pan, and oh my goodness.  Very very good and very quick!  I am going to frost mine with Strawberry Cream Cheese (whipped) with a little powdered sugar and milk.  So its not so sweet.  I cant wait to give them to the kids tomorrow after lunch.  They are going to be thrilled.  Thanks a bunch.  Oh I also added 3 bananas, cinnamon and vanilla.  I had French Vanilla cake mix, so I used that.  Wonderful!  Thanks.  I cant wait to try other kinds of cake mix with it.  Chocolate, Strawberry.. oh the list goes on and on.  THanks!~  Oh I bet a pineapple upside down cake would be wonderful with banana's in it.  Niiice!

The great thing about this recipe is that you can use a couple different kinds of cake mix and it will turn out great.  I used a white cake mix as it was all I had, and it turned out to be a panful of deliciousness! Plus it is a great way to use up some ripe bananas.  I used 2 1/2 large bananas & baked it in a 350 degree preheated oven for 37 minutes and it was perfect.  I mixed a small pack of instant vanilla pudding w/a cup of milk and an 8 oz tub of whipped topping for the "icing."  Will make this a lot, I am sure. Thanks for the recipe!

I used three old bananas and a 9x13 and fridged until the next day when I used the cream cheese frosting suggested by another reviewer (with a splash of vanilla extract in it).  I cut the cake in half and did layers.  I got crumbs around the edge but I threw on some sprinkly things and it doesn't show.  I usually don't like carrot or banana cake but the cream cheese wasn't too strong and there were no nuts in it so I was very pleased.  Will definitely use this as my base recipe from now on.

This recipe rocks!  I use it all the time and everyone always loves it!  I made this last on Sunday and made some changes...  I used only 1 banana and 2 cups of zucchini and a handful of chocolate chips.  I also forgot the eggs!  But it didn't matter at all, it was awesome, easy and even a little less guilty!  
I also cook the cake in a preheated oven.

This is such a great tasting cake that I make often. My family begs me to make it! Adjustments to the recipe I have made are: I use 3 very ripe bananas mashed well. And preheat my oven and bake for only 40 minutes. Comes out perfect every time.

I used a Pillsbury Reduced Sugar yellow cake mix, two bananas, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp baking powder, 1 cup water, 1/4 cup oil, and 2 eggs; baked for 38 minutes. I frosted it with cream cheese frosting. Excellent!

Wow - I was looking for something simple and quick, and this was amazing! I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and used 3 bananas.  I used vanilla instant pudding with 1 cup of milk mixed with a 1/2 tub of cool whip for the icing.  Even my son who hates bananas loved this recipe! Will definitely make again!

This was a really good cake and easy to make. I made two, 5 ounce boxes of cook and serve banana pudding and let it cool. I cut the cake into small cubes and layered it in a triffel bowl making a layer of cake and a layer of pudding, adding sliced bananas as I layered. I topped it off with whipped cream and sliced bananas. It was not only very tastey, it also looked like a picture on the cover of a magazine. Thanks for a great cake. =)

Welll, I misread the recipe and thought that I didn't actually have to add the other (usual) ingredients to prepare the cake.  So, I realized my problem after I had already mashed bananas and baking soda. My problem was time.. .no time to drag out beaters, crack eggs, etc.  So I had to skimp on eggs (only two) and quickly threw in about 1/2 c. applesauce to sub for other agg, and the oil.   Whiped this with a whire whisk for a minute or so, then added the water, too.  More whipping.  Dumped in bananas, three.  Last minute, I also dumped in some unsweetened cocoa powder.   Stirrrrrr.... Whew!  Done in 5 minutes!  Into preheated oven for 35 minutes.

This was very good.  Too sugary for me, really, between the mostly-sugar cake and the bananas.  But very very good.  Crumbly and smooshy, no frosting needed!

The recipe name says it all. It truly is a wonderful banana cake. Moist and light. The only addition I made was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon.

I get so excited when I see ripe bananas at the grocery store, because I know that I get to make this cake. I have made it probably about 20 times in the last 2 years. I make it according to the recipe without exeption and it turns out perfect every time.  I put it in an unheated oven and bake according to directions. There is a gal that I work with that pays me to make this cake for her. She pays me very well. Everyone loves it. My mom now has me make it on her birthday. I use the cream cheese frosting from this site and sprinkle the top with walnuts. It is so moist and delicious.

This cake was very easy to make, thanks to the yellow cake mix, but the flavor was not as good as the one I bake from scratch, but overall it's very good and very easy to make, great for kids who like to help out in the kitchen.

This was fantastic. I omitted the oil in the cake recipe and used applesauce instead. Baked in a preheated oven for about 40 minutes. This is so moist and delicious. Rave reviews from my dinner guests.

Absolutely wonderful! Don't pass this one up because of it's simplicity. They are SO moist & taste like they are made from scratch. Only change I made was using 3 bananas instead of 2. Recipe made 33 cupcakes (follow baking directions on cake box). I topped them with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this website (so yummy!) and sprinkled with chopped walnuts. They were a hit with my family and co-workers!

Sorry! I thought I had under-baked the first one because it was only 1/2" high. So I tried it again and same result. However, it is moist and tasty--especially when frosted with penuche icing.

This is really great. My husband thinks this is the best cake ever and always complains that he doesn't get the whole cake to himself. I make the Frosting with banana cream pudding(use 1 cup milk instead of 2) and whipped cream. Its the best!

My family and I thought this cake was great.  I used a spice cake and baked in a bundt pan for 45 minutes in a 350 degree nonpreheated oven and it came out perfectly.  I saved this one in my recipe box.  Thank you.

I joined just so I could rate this cake: Delicious!  I was skeptical at first, but it came out beautifully -- so beautifully, in fact, my roommate said it was "the best banana cake" I'd "ever made."  It's scandalous how easy it was.
Used 3 med. bananas, 1/2 the butter suggested, and 4 oz. banana yogurt.  Moist as hell.

This is such a nice, quick recipe! The only thing I did differently was that the cake mix I had on hand was a butter recipe with pudding in the mix and I added 3 bananas instead of 2 and some nutmeg. I also used a whipped cream cheese frosting. And after carefully reading the directions I realized it said to bake 1 hr. in a non-preheated oven, but since my oven was already preheated I baked it for 45 mins and it came out golden and perfect. My kids loved it as did my husband. I'll certainly use this recipe again. Thanks!

Excellent and easy!  I made this with my four year old daughter and she was thrilled with her accomplishment!  I used three bananas and topped it with chocolat chips (which sank to the bottom...) Super moist and delish!  Drizzled it with melted vanilla icing for added fun.  Will use chocolat next time and omit chocolat chips.

This cake was good, but nothing special. It was very brown after just 20 minutes of baking, but wasn't done in the middle until after 45 minutes. By then, it was a very dark brown....typical of banana bread, but not appealing for a cake.

This is a great little cake. Easy as could be,and tastes like it's from scratch.   I used a white mix because that's all I had and it also turned out wonderful.  I've made it 3x now and each time my family loves it.

Needed a quick dessert.  Had some over ripe bananas, so made this with French Vanilla cake mix that I had on hand.  It was excellent.

This recipe is so easy ~ and so good.  Very moist.  No need to frost.  I did add an extra banana. I think that a total of 4 bananas would make it even better.

I used 3 bananas and added 8 oz container of sour cream.  I really wanted a strong banana taste and super moist.  It took a lot longer for baking time, maybe because I added those extra ingredients, but when it was finally done, it was really good and super moist!  I will definitely make again.  Next time I may add a cream cheese frosting, yum.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it just like the directions say. Cut the time down to 42 min. Delish. Would totally make again because it was so easy the girls made it (ages 7 and 9).

What a great, quick and easy way to use up ripe bananas when you happen to have a box of yellow cake mix in the panty! They turned out great (in the preheated oven) as cupcakes, although I forgot the baking soda but you don't miss it at all! Used QTchefs peanut butter glaze to go on top! Yummo!

this was not good at all. the cake didn't rise and it came out dense and chewy. I baked my cake for 30 minutes and it was a bit too brown.

I made this recipe with an Aldi gluten free yellow cake mix. It turned out great. I lined the pan with parchment, used 3 very ripe bananas, topped with 1 cup each dark chocolate chips and roughly chopped walnuts. Baked in preheated oven for 40 minutes. It turned out fantastic! I would make this for guests!

I have made this countless times over the years and am finally getting around to adding a review.  I generally use white cake instead of the yellow cake called for in the recipe.  I usually add a teaspoon of banana extract as well.  I make as a layer cake.  I make a batch of whipped cream to frost it and use banana pudding mixed with some whipped cream for the filling between the layers.  Hands down my husband's favorite cake and I make it for most special occasions.  Getting ready to bake it for Easter tomorrow! Easy and delicious!

Super moist! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and preheated my oven. I made mine in a bunt pan. It took about 50 min to cook. I’m sorry I’m reviewing with changes I made, but it was so good I just have to share. I added one of those snack cups of applesauce to my batter along with the 3 very very ripe bananas. I also made a frosting for it. You’ll thank me later if you decide to add the frosting. 1 package of cream cheese, softened, 1/2 stick of butter, softened, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a half of a mashed banana. Everyone loved it. Even my daughter, who isn’t typically a banana fan.

Followed various users suggestions; used 3 bananas (will use 2 next time because it was too moist) added 1/2 cup of sour cream and baked in preheated oven @ 350 for 45 minutes. Frosted it with cream cheese frosting (8 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup of powdered sugar). 

All in all, it was a wonderful way to get rid of my brown bananas, an easy recipe, a great tasting cake, and very moist. Winner, winner!

Mixed recipe as stated, poured into one coated 9x2 round pan, preheated oven to 300 degrees, and baked for one hour. Came out perfect. Served with whipped cream. Will make this one again.

Quick and easy! I used the yellow cake mix. Followed the directions on the box and added 3 bananas instead of 2 with the baking soda. I put in a 9x13 pan. After cooked I followed what someone suggested in a review and topped with an 8oz tub of cool whip, small box of instant pudding with a cup of milk. The cake was amazing and a cool treat for the summer. I also topped half with chopped walnuts(some in the family do not like nuts) it tasted like a cold version of banana bread.

This cake is absolutely delicious! It so moist and flavorful that we didn’t think it needed frosting. I made it in my RV, so I had to “make do” with what I had available.  I made it using the convection function of my microwave/convection oven, so I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees. I used 3 bananas and baked it in 2 9 inch round pans for between 40 to 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.  This is my new favorite for using up ripe bananas.

Turned out super moist, not too sweet and not crumbly. Added a third nana and 1/3 cup sour cream along with 1/2 cup extra flour and a dash of  vanilla.   Do be sure to  set a timer, mine was done in 45 min. using a 10x12 pan (which really was a bit too large). Sounds like a lot of changes, but not really.  I didn't want  this to taste like a mix and it didn't.   With this recipe it's doutful l will ever make B-bread from scratch again.

Quick way to be one better than straight cake mix.  all I had on hand was a German chocolate mix. Used a bundt pan and powder sugar to pretty up the finished product.  It was well received and had a surprisingly complex flavor. Magic.

I made this with a Butter Pecan cake mix . I added 1 1/3 cup of quick cooking oats to the mix plus 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and made the cake mix as instructed, adding 1 cup of sour cream with the wet ingredients. I then added 3 bananas and the baking soda. Baked it in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 40-45 minutes. Next time I think I will chop up the oats in the blender slightly. We ate it plain, no frosting. It didn’t taste like a cake mix at all!

My husband is on a strict, low fat diet.  My daughter made this cake for his birthday yesterday.  The three of us loved it.  My daughter said it was very easy to make.  It was moist and really tasty.  We sprinkled some powdered sugar on top of it.  Will be making this again.

No changes, however I would like to stress the importance of mashing the bananas with the baking soda. Do not add the baking soda to the cake mix. If you do the texture of the cake will not be nice and consistent. It will be all crumbly and fall apart.
My husband begs me to make this cake it's so good. I frost it with Cream Cheese Frosting! Yum!

Followed Butterfly Flutterby's direction of pre-heating the oven. I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to the batter and used 3 bananas. For frosting, I combined 2 small boxes of instant vanilla pudding, a large can of crushed pineapple, and a tub of Cool Whip. I took it to a holiday potluck. It disappeared in less than five minutes.

Good recipe. I would have preferred it a little denser, so I will make it again without the baking soda. I added an extra banana, 1/2 C chopped walnuts and 3/4 C semi sweet chocolate chips, then baked it in a bundt pan for about 60 minutes (oven pre-heated to 350F). The chips sank to the bottom, so I will try tossing them with flour next time.

Very easy and very good; I'll definitely be making this cake again.  I followed the directions on the box instead of putting in a cold oven, but baked a few minutes longer because of the added bananas.  I topped it with a vanilla buttercream icing.  (I did add toasted walnuts to the cake, but I will probably skip the nuts next time.)

Deliciously moist wonderful banana cake. I used Duncan Hines white cake. Used 3 bananas with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and followed the directions on the back of the cake. This was absolutely great tasting cake.

Wonderful and refreshing flavor.  I modified with using buttermilk for the liquid when making the yellow cake mix.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I baked in a PREHEATED oven and baked for 40 minutes.  Very good!  Oh, and topped with whipped cream.

I love this recipe. I always add cinnamon. I've also made it with chocolate cake mix, it turned out just as tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used Pillsbury's no-sugar yellow cake mix, and 2 1/2 medium ripe bananas, and the result was a light and super-moist cake that had just enough banana flavor.   This is a recipe I will share and make again many times.  Enjoy!!

This recipe has been a family favorite since we first tried it 10 years ago!  We serve it for many birthdays and other occasions.  It's very moist, easy to make, and always turns out well.  It does not take a full hour to bake, though, so check it carefully.  We always put a thick chocolate frosting on it.  We've tried a cream cheese frosting and that is good as well, but we always go back to chocolate.  Delicious!

I too, did not read through any reviews before hand but knew baking a cake for an hour where I live (high altitude) would result in disaster! I baked for 30 minutes and it was just a tiny overdone on the edges. I would recommend baking as per the instructions on the cake mix. But it was super simple and a great banana flavored cake!

Banana taste there but not STRONG.
Cake very moist. Gets dark color upon baking.
Banana is almost it's own layer in cake.

I wanted to try this, but make it into cupcakes, since there are only 2 of us.  I followed the recipe but made 24 cupcakes.  I followed the directions to put it into a cold oven and set the timer for 30 minutes.  They were done and perfect, so light and fluffy for cake.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious.

Yes I just made it today and was very happy how it turned out. I used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce a dash of cinnamon and vanilla. I also used 3 medium sized bananas. I preheated oven to 350 and baked for 40 min. When it was done I let it cool and than mixed cool whip and some instant tapioca pudding together for the topping. It was so delicious. Thanks

This cake is awesome! I used this recipe as my base for a banana pudding poke cake (Yellow cake with a banana pudding layer (I used a Paula Deen recipe that has cream cheese and condensed milk in it) and then a whipped cream and sprinkled with crushed vanilla wafers. It was a little on the rich side, so next time I will cut back on the condensed milk, but everyone loved it.

I took the suggestion of B_32 and made this with a butter pecan cake mix and lemme tell ya.  It was fabulous!  I took it to work and brought none of it home to my dear hubby. (and man,was he bummed!)

I did two things slightly differently.  I used 4 smashed bananas (because that's what I had on my kitchen counter) and I cut the amount of water just slightly.  I also baked it for appx 35 mins as directed on the cake mix box, and watched it carefully for doneness.  There's no way that I'd bake this cake for the amount of time that the recipe calls for.  It would be overdone for sure.  Frosted this with a simple cream cheese frosting and sprinkled it with toasted walnuts.  New favorite go-to recipe for overripe bananas.

I tried this recipe again for the second time but added one small package of instant banana pudding powder, 1/2 cup of whole milk, and one tablespoon of banana extract to the batter and it was unbelievable!!!!  After it baked and cooled I cut the cake in half and spread more banana pudding in the middle with fresh banana slices and frosted the cake with whipped vanilla frosting and shaved white chocolate for a garnish!!! WOW! It was the best cake ever!!!

My family loved it, I made this cake with a white cake mix(used the whole eggs instead of just the whites) and 4 mashed bananas the cake was very moist.  I also made a caramel icing for it and it worked well together.

Glad I found this!! I should have read the reviews first, but I did preheat my oven, because it's just in me to do!! I cooked it by the box so all was well! I would have loved to add some of the things a lot of the cooks added, but definitely next time!! For what I needed, this was excellent!!!

I didn't have anything but french vanilla cake mix ,so thats what I used, had 4 bananas so I used those. Added about 2 t of cinnamon to the cake mix. Frosted with a very thin coat of cream cheese frosting .
Awesome cake no one would know its a mix, this one is a keeper.

I made this cake during the Super Bowl 2013 power outage, super easy to make, and I didn't miss much of the game at all. I made it with chocolate cake. The look is deceiving since it looks like a chocolate cake, but tastes like bananas. Super moist and easy to make. I think the cake may taste differently if I had used a different cake mix. It's good enough and easy enough that I probably will do that...

We loved this cake.  I used 3 bananas as others suggested and used 1/2 cup oil even though the cake mix I used called for 1/3 cup.  After it was done, I frosted it with cream cheese icing but it is good without anything on it.  I'll be making this again and againl

Excellent! I followed the other reviewers suggestion and baked the cake according to the package directions, and for icing, I added a package of banana cream pudding mix to heavy whipping cream after I whipped it.

Mmmm.  Good flavor, moist and really easy.  I made cupcakes and a cream cheese frosting with orange zest.  I also used 3 bananas and english walnuts.  I happen to have bing cherries and put a half on each cupcake.  They were beautiful and delish.

Baked today and just had a piece.  It was really good; 12 yr old son really liked it too.  Used 1 Duncan Hines yellow mix, 1 cup water, 1/3 cup milk, 1/2 cup applesauce, 3 eggs, 3 mashed bananas, and 1 tsp baking soda (used no oil).  Baked preheated 350 for 35 mins in 9X13 metal pan sprayed with Pam.  Mixed 1/2 cup powdered sugar, touch of vanilla, and touch of milk for icing and drizzled over the top.  Nice, light, and spongy.  Could have probably baked a few mins less, so you might want to check it early.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

My family loves this cake--it's a much easier way to get rid of bananas then making traditional banana bread.  I also like to add a dash of cinnamon or the 'cinnamon blend' from pampered chef, just to give it a little more flavor.  I rarely frost it, that way it seems more healthy--LOL!

This was a wonderful cake! I used it to make "Elvis Cake." I used 9 inch rounds and followed the baking instructions on the cake box instead of cooking for an hour. I also used 3 bananas instead of 2. In the middle of the 2 rounds I put a layer of peanut butter and iced the outside with cream cheese icing. Wonderful!

I was looking for a quick and easy banana bread recipe, so I followed what another reviewer did and baked in mini bread-loaf pans. It was pretty good, but most people were expecting bread because it looked like bread. I believe it would be much better as a cake with chocolate frosting, as pictured.

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday with cream cheese frosting and he loved it!  It was so good and moist.  I added 3 very ripe bananas and did the cooking time according to the regular box time instead of what was posted.  It still turned out perfect and so moist.  I will definitely make this again and my fiance says he wants it again before his next birthday!

Exactly the cake I was looking for! I used three ripe medium size bananas, preheated the oven & baked in a glass 9x12" pan (sprayed with non stick spray) for 40 minutes. It turned out perfect and was super fast to make.

This is such a great banana cake recipe! I usually make it from scratch - not a mix - but honestly this was just as good - very moist. I made it for my son's 1st birthday party and used instant vanilla pudding mix and a tub of cool whip for the icing. Light and fluffy and not too sweet. Perfect!

I used vanilla cake mix and three bananas. No baking soda but I used one egg. It turned out so moist that it didn't want to stay together very well. But it was SOOO good!  I made frosting with pudding and whipped cream. Between two people this lasted hardly a week. I LOVE this cake

YES! Tastes homemade, but WAY faster! I even used the Pilsbury 1/2 the sugar (with splenda) box. I will make this again! Maybe I'd add nuts next time?

I have made this several times, and it is always a hit!  Very simple, and what a great way to use up ripe banannas.  Topping this with pudding/cool whip icing is really what makes this cake though (use 1c milk and 1 package instant vanilla pudding then fold into 1 container cool whip).  Thanks for this great one!

Good Cake.  However, I can not give 5 stars for something where 3/4 of the recipe is from a box.  I followed the additions given by others and added sour cream and used the box baking times.

Mmmm...a simple version of a banana cake :) First time I made this I used a yellow cake mix and it turned out pretty good.  Second time, I used a pecan cake mix and added an extra egg, 1/3 C sour cream, and frosted it with a coconut pecan frosting.  Was really moist and tasty. Thank you for the recipe

This is a super easy, quick, delicious banana cake recipe!  I only made two changes. I used a butter cake mix instead of yellow and I did preheat the oven to 350 degrees and baked for 35 - 40 minutes.  I also added one cup of chopped walnuts.  I spooned about 2 T of the dry cake mix over them to coat them so they wouldn't sink in the batter.  I added them after everything else was mixed as directed.  I did not frost the cake.  Served it with a little (or alot) whipped cream on top or just ate it plain.  I thought it was better the longer it sat in the pan.  Will make again.  In fact, I've got 3 very ripe bananas in my kitchen calling to me now.  Gotta go, time to bake!

I made this recipe using 3 bananas instead of 2 and followed the cooking instructions exactly and it came out perfect. As long as you don't preheat the oven, the 1 hour cooking time works just fine...have made twice now and both husband and kids love this cake!

This was a big hit with my family.  I made it as written, but only cooked for 40 minutes in a preheated oven.  It was cooked perfectly and is very moist!  My son wants me to add chocolate frosting next time. :-)

I followed the advice of others and only cooked for 40 minutes in a preheated oven, it was a nice golden brown when ready. I also added the cinnamon and sour cream which added to the flavor. It did sink a little after taking out so I'm not sure if it was the pans i used (I used with the wilton even strips)or if I should have cooked it longer :)

Oh, this was very good (of course I made some additions)! I made as did Alice, minus the icing, and was sooo good and moist.

Very moist, kids loved it.  I added sour cream to it.  I also used a sheet cake pan instead of 9 x 13 and cooked for 22-30 minutes.  Turned out great and was just the right size for bite size pieces for the kids.

This is a "fab" recipe. I even used 5 regular size bananas and added 1 more tsp. baking soda, and baked it for 40 minutes on 350 in electric oven. Even though I frosted it, it was moist and not mushy and many said no frosting is necessary, and I received rave reviews at the neighborhood NHL playoffs party and was requested for future gatherings.

Very good.   I did top it with white frosting that made it even more sweet.  The cake is sweet enough. It reminds me of a Sara Lee cake my mom used to buy that was delicious.

I made this cake for my son's 1st birthday & it was a HIT!!  I simply followed the baking time on the cake package box and had no problems with it overcooking.  Would recommend that to anyone wanting to make it!  Thanks!

I made this for Easter supper this year and the family all loved it (Granny even had a third piece!). I used the suggestions of three bananas and a cup of sour cream and it was one of the lightest and moistest cakes I have ever made! So easy and not too sweet!  Loved the idea of Cool Whip as icing and you can put it on ahead of time and it doesn't make the cake mushy! "Wonderful" is right!

Wonderful and so easy!! I used 4 bananas, which was too much. Next time, I'll just use 2.  I also made my own cream cheese frosting... nummy!! I just baked it at 350, for about 40 minutes, or whatever it says on the box.  Turned out great!

I began with a Duncan Hines Banana Cake mix, added a tsp. of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I frosted it with buttercream frosting, but it really doesn't need frosting.  Next time, I think I will add sour cream and omit the frosting.  A nice change from traditional cake recipes.

I used a lemon supreme cake mix and also used 3 bananas. This took about 35 mins to make a bundt cake and only about 25- 28 mins. to make muffins. 
I like the cake and muffins the way they are plain, but may try a cream cheese frosting.

This cake wasn't very good straight out of the oven (it felt wet), but it was really great after it sat in the refridgerator overnight. I frosted it with chocolate frosting and I preheated the oven.

This recipe is so easy & delicious.  I needed some type of recipe to use up some ripe bananas, and chose this one.  I paired it up with Cream Cheese Frosting II, and it was a big hit at work.

OMG YUM! My mother-in-;law was very skeptical when I told her I had made a Banana cake using a yellow cake mix.  She insisted her recipe for banana cake was better... EVEN SHE LOVED IT! So moist and delicious!  I used newer bananas though to cut down the sweetness and I made the Banana Frosting from this site to top it off. YUM!

Yum!  Made with two bananas.  Added only a dash of cinnamon and a little freshly grated nutmeg.  Baked according to directions on my cake mix box.  So delicious and SO easy, this one's a keeper.

Excellent and easy.  However, I baked at 340 and it was totally done and brown on top in 40 minutes, of course, oven temps vary.  Suggest using baking times on cake mix.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and frosted with buttercream frosting.  So good - will make again.

This was so quick and easy. It was a big hit.  I made  a Mickey Mouse cake for my son's first birthday.  Everyone thought it was homemade.  I got many requests for the recipe.  Update:  Just reread the recipe.  I have preheated the oven each time I baked this cake and cooked for the time on the box.  1 hour is way too long and you must preheat the oven.  I am going to try it with chocolate cake mix today.

This cake is so easy and quick.  I was really looking for a recipe that was light and fluffy.  Most of the banana cake recipes I had looked at seemed too heavy for what I wanted.  I used the Banana Cake VI recipe though for icing: 1 stick of butter, 1 block of cream cheese, and 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, but I also added a bit of banana flavoring.  It was amazing.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I even had people who don't like bananas say they loved the cake. Definitely going to keep this recipe on hand!

Can't wait to try this recipe the way it's written, but the bananas had to go and the only cake mix I had was a Betty Crocker Cinnamon Swirl.  I decided it was worth a try. Didn't want the prominent flavor to be cinnamon, so I only used half of the enclosed packet of cinnamon. Only other thing I changed was preheating my oven. Baked at 350 for 40 min.  Incredible!!  Really needs no frosting.  I just love a recipe that's quick, easy and yummy! Thanks, Carolyn!

this recipe was great! I made a slight substitution of using spice cake mix rather than yellow and three bananas. yeilded 3 8in square cakes. It was moist and delicious as promised. I to did not do the whole "put in oven then turn on" as the recipe called for, and it just baked like your normal cake. just dusted some powdered sugar and voila!! if you are one that likes spice breads or cakes, try this variation and you won't be disappointed.

this was really great. everyone loved it. it is like a "cakey" banana bread. I did as others did and used 3 bananas, added cinnamon, and cooked normally, preheating the oven, and baking for about 40 mins. Was great. I also made the cool whip/pudding "icing." People couldn't sto pdipping their fingers in the bowl when I made it. But me perosnally, I think the cake would be better without it. If you have to have frosting on it, I would go the cream cheese route.

5IVE Star YUM!! Rich banana flavor. Mashed 3 small bananas up with (Mistake!) baking powder instead of baking soda: cake still rose-just not as well- & flavor remained rich. 
Whipped up two 6 oz pkgs banana pudding with 1 cup milk & entire giant tub of Cool Whip to frost the cake. Garnished with banana & strawberry slices & a squirt of Reddi Whip. This light yet satisfying dessert got gobbled up quickly. I'll make it again this week, its now a major favorite. Thanks for a super recipe.

I made this for a Mothers day brunch today and people loved it. I made a change someone else commented on in regards to the sour cream, but I think that made it too moist, but I did love the frosting another reviewer used with pudding and cool whip. Great cake!!

Amazing! Was a HUGE hit and so easy. It tasted homemade. I used 3 bananas in the cake, baked it in 2 round cake pans in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. I used 1 tub of whipped topping mixed with banana pudding mix and 1 cup of milk. When frosting, I frosted the first layer, topped with slices of a bananas, put the 2nd cake on, and finished frosting. Thank you SO much!

Yum!  This was super easy and so good.  I used white cake and added an extra banana. Topped it off with homemade cream cheese frosting and some chopped walnuts.  I'll definately be making this again.

Loved it! So easy.  I prepared as directed on cake mix box.  My bananas were ripe but not very.  I iced with cream cheese frosting because that is what I had on hand and it was delicious! Will make again.

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You! for this yummy, easy, delicious, quick, wonderful recipe! I don't know which I was more impressed with, the cake recipe or the scrumptious pudding/whipped cream topping recipe submitted in one of the reviews. I will definitely make this again(didn't last long the first time) I just don't know if we can wait on the bananas to turn brown! I also baked at 350 in preheated oven for the time suggested on the cake mix box. The recipe didn't specify banana size, so I used four small bananas, worked perfectly!

It is wonderful-I loved this cake! After it cooled a little,  I added the caramel glaze from the Apple cake and caramel glaze at this site. Great ingredients that you usually have in the pantry.

This was the best cake I and my friends have eaten. So easy to do and so moist. I did substitute the oil from the box receipe and used cinnamon applesauce. They are still calling for the recipe. Also, I am going to make my next cake in mini bundt pans so each can have their own.

This was a very easy cake to make.  It doesn't rise too much, but very tasty.  No one complained that it wasn't fluffy...I used store bought cream cheese frosting and it tasted wonderful.  I will definately make again.

Excellent cake, and sooo easy to make. I used 3 very ripe bananas and a butter recipe yellow cake mix. It came out so moist that it needs no frosting or topping. Kinda like a snacking cake. I'll use this recipe again, for sure, and pass it on to my friends.

Easiest banana cake I ever made. It was delicious.  I thought it would taste like a "box cake" but it was much higher and tastier.  I used three ripe bananas and preheated the oven.  It was ready in 45 minutes (9X13" pan).  Next I'm going to try it with a chocolate cake mix.

Used three bananas as suggested by other reviewers and topped with french vanilla cool whip.  Kids and hubby gobbled it up and had seconds.  Light texture and very moist.  My cake baked in a glass pan within 45 minutes (15 minutes less than recipes states).

WOW!! I (along with the rest of my family) thought this cake was amazing!  It didn't last very long in my house. I used more bananas than the recipe called for and added mini chocolate chips. I also made a topping by mixing prepared banana pudding with Cool Whip and then sprinkled crushed walnuts and mini chocolate chips on top. It turned out DELICIOUS!!

Amazing!  Just made this cake with Caramel Frosting VI from this website.  To doctor for fun add: rum flavor, vanilla flavor and 1  teaspoon cinnamon to the mix.  I also sprinkled some salted and roasted cashews on top, since I made the frosting with unsalted butter.  Such a moist and easy cake- I just made it for a girls night and they were all wanting this super easy and yummy recipe!

I spent the day before I made this making 252 banana muffins. My husband had brought home a whole case of bananas so I had to do something with them. My teenage daughter made this cake the next day with the few leftover bananas we had.

We also used the banana pudding/whipped cream frosting someone here had suggested. It turned out very good!!!

I have to admit that this was a very easy recipe and a nice way to dress up a plain yellow cake.  I was a little disappointed because I thought the banana flavor was way too subtle, but I followed others advice and made a frosting of banana pudding and whipped cream and it did help it a little.  And, the longer it sat in the refrigerator, the better it got.  I thought the cake itself was a little tough and may try preheating the oven if I make this again.  Thanks for an easy recipe.

This was a huge hit at my party.  None left and EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I used three bananas instead of two and used the Cool Whip/banana pudding frosting as suggested by other reviews and it came out delish!  This one is a keeper.

What a winner.  I used the suggestion of adding the chocolate chips - ok that they go to the bottom - and also added another rater's suggestion of banana pudding/whipped cream as icing, sprinkled with more chocolate chips... There was NONE left.  Also remarkably fast and easy!

I used three bananas, added chopped walnuts to the batter and frosted with a buttercream frosting. Delicious!

I have made this recipe countless times since I came across it.  I add 2 or 3 bananas and it comes out delicious. My family like this with fluffy white icing-this cake doesn't last very long in my house!

This cake is delicious!  I am a huge fan of banana bread and I would have to say that I like this cake even better!  I did add chocolate chips, because like another review confessed, I am also a chocoholic - the chips sank to the bottom though as it baked so that was a little disappointing.  But, all in all, this is a great recipe.  All my coworkers enjoyed it!

This made a wonderful cake! I used 3 bananas that were almost creamed. The cake turned out light and moist. This is a keeper!

good, but not as good as mom's.  My mom uses a yellow cake mix but adds much more making it very flavorful and moist, when I find the recipe perhaps I will post it.

This tasted good, but sort of fell apart on me when I inverted it onto the cooling rack. Also all of the banana sank to the bottom, which made it a little mushy. I used 3 bananas, maybe I'll try it again with just 2.

Love this recipe!  My husband loves this cake (and he's a picky eater).  Since I am a chocoholic I have to add chocolate chips, which I think makes it even better.

This cake was super easy and turned out delicious and very moist.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on top before it baked...just too good!
