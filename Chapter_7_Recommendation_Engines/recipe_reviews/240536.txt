I love butternut squash, but kale, not so much.  I know it's good for me, but I need help.  This recipe is a good way to get some kale into your family's diet.  It is a colorful dish, and the butternut really helps the kale.  My only deviation was to omit the last bit of balsamic.  I don't feel the recipe suffered with this small change.  I wasn't too happy about two prep dishes and a serving dish, since I like to streamline during the week.  I'm glad I tried the recipe, and this was a change from our usual fare.  Thanks for the idea.

To save time and have fewer dishes, I cooked the squash in the skillet with a bit of broth, covered for 15 minutes.  Then I continued with the rest of the recipe.  I served this as a layered pasta bowl, with angel hair pasta in the bottom, then the butternut/kale mixture, and topped with shrimp that had been sauteed in butter and garlic.  Yum!

Great way to choke down kale.  I simplified it by sautéing the squash and onion in 1tlbsp. of oil just until the onion were translucent, then I added the balsamic and broth, covered it and simmered it until the squash was easily penetrated with a toothpick.  Then I added the kale covered and simmered about five minutes.  If you want the kale softer, just simmer it longer, but too long and the squash gets too soft.

This recipe was pretty good. I like both kale and squash, and its obviously pretty healthy. I served it with some couscous.

My husband is a true kale lover, so this was a hit. Textures and flavors were fine. I'd only make it for kale fans, though.

I made it last night.  A double batch because my ingredients were just the right weights.  We had friends over for dinner I heard from 3 of the 5 they don’t like kale.  Funny how much they ate of it.  So I’d say it’s a good recipe to use on non kale eaters.  I personally think I’d enjoy it with almost any meal, or even as a main course.   I did not change anything as I usually follow a recipe and maybe alter later.   This needs no altering.   ????????????????
