I agree with most of the other reviews, and suggest the following alterations:  reduce garlic cloves to 3 for a good garlic flavor w/out it being too overpowering, use 1/2 lb pasta so your shrimp does not get lost, use 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs so you taste the shrimp and not the crumbs, and use the juice of 1/2 lemon so the lemon does not overpower the shrimp.  Top with parsley after everything is mixed for a nice presentation.

This was awesome!  I doubled the shrimp since my husband loves it, added a little bit more butter, but kept the crumbs the same.  I substituted 1/2c chicken broth for the wine.  I had about 20 cloves of garlic since my husband love that too.  This turned out phenomenal!

Very good!  I used frozen med. shrimp already cooked; Italian breadcrumbs and light marg.  Cut back a little on the lemon juice.  Very tasty and will make again!  Even my seafood-hating hubby liked it.

OhMyGosh -- this recipe is FABULOUS!  I tweaked it a bit by upping the shrimp portion (I never follow seafood recipes exactly, especially since I live on the coast and am only minutes away from fresh Gulf seafood).  I started with 4 pounds of medium/large heads-on shrimp, which after peeling (and deveining, of course) resulted in 8 cups shrimp.  I then generously doubled everything else.  I am so enamoured of this recipe that I am having a dinner party Wednesday night and am serving it.  My sincerest thanks go to the wonderful woman who submitted this recipe.  This will be a family favorite, I'm sure!

This recipe was delicious but I honestly did a lot of tweaking to get it to our liking.  I used eight garlic cloves instead of five.  I omitted the breadcrumbs and the entire oven process.  Instead, I cooked the shrimp in the sauce for five minutes and then removed them from the heat.  I used additional butter at the end instead of olive oil, and I employed Lidia Bastianich's tip of cooking the pasta in the sauce for the last minute or two.  (There was not enough sauce leftover for bread dipping, but I could have added some pasta water to the sauce.)  When I tasted the sauce by itself, I thought the lemon and wine too overpowering, but once the dish was put together and sprinkled with grated romano cheese, it really was very good.  I liked this recipe because it was quick for a weeknight dinner, but I will be trying other scampi recipes before making this one again.

This dish was delicous. It was quick and easy to prepare, which was great after a long day of work. I did tweak the recipe a little bit. Instead of using the bread crumbs, I used a Tbsp. of corn starch mixed with a Tbsp. of water. Mixing in slowly, the sauce thickened to a creamy texture.

The flavor and aroma of this dish were fabulous!!  I would make half the pasta next time or double the shrimp and sauce.  I only used about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs and that was enough.  I was glad that I read the reviews before I made it. I just reheated some of this dish at work and everyone came over to see what I was eating because the aroma was so appealing.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time at our house.  The only thing that I do differently is crush the garlic instead of mincing...and take it out of the butter sauce when it is a little brown.  Then I don't have some of those uncooked garlic pieces that get into the dish.  Added some parmesan and a little mushroom. It turns out just as good.  Also reduced the amount of breadcrumbs a little.  Thanks for the post.

I thought that this was the best Shrimp Scampi I have ever eaten.  The breadcrumbs were an excellent addition.  My husband loved it as well.  We will definately make this again.

I read all the reviews and made it my own.  I took 2lbs shrimp that was already cooked deviened and frozen.*walmart  Rinsed in cold water for 5 min as directed on the shrimp bag. In the mean time cooked 1 lb linguinie. Took the 1/4 c butter and 6minced garlic and melted in the micro.  then poured the butter mix in a pan.  Added the shrimp and tossed.  simmered on low about 8 min while the linguini cooked.   I ground up Fiber one cereal (hungry girl tip) and used for bread crumbs.. used 1/2 c of the cereal crumbs, tossed in the pan.  Added the cooked noodles.  Poured in 1/2 c chicken broth and cut up a fresh lemon and squeezed over the pasta mix.  That in itself was the best kick to this.  I am not a garlic fan, and this was one of the best meals I have had in a while. Delicious.  Quick and a definate keeper will make again!  thank you for sharing your recipie!

This was very delicious! I've never made shrimp scampi before, and decided to make it on a whim a couple weeks ago. This was an extremely easy recipe. I like to follow a recipe pretty closely the first time I try it, so I went with the raw shrimp. Luckily our grocer provides veined shrimp and all I had to do was shell it. I thought the garlic was fine, but I'm a fan of garlic and like a lot of flavor. The only problems I had were that the breadcrumbs stayed soggy, so I may reduce some liquid next time, and there seemed to be too much pasta to the shrimp. I will either double the shrimp or reduce the pasta the next time around. Still greatly enjoyed!

Slightly too "shrimpy" tasting. Good, but you really need to cook the shimp in the oven about 10 minutes longer to get it done. The noodles needed A LOT of salt. The family loved it, though.

This was wonderful! I cut back the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and only used 1/2 of the lemon for juice at first. I served it with the left over lemon slices so individuals could juice to their taste. A little fresh parsley and fresh ground pepper at the end finished off a simple, wonderful dish.

Definitely cook/toss the pasta, sauce, and shrimp together for the last minute or two on the stove. 

Next time I might try adding mushrooms and capers to the sauce to add more depth.

I made this recipe for dinner and it was delicious.  No leftovers.  I reduced bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and just a few sprinkles of lemon juice.  No need to add 1 whole lemon juice.  Didn't have white wine so I didn't add to the recipe and it was still delicious.

THis recipe is awesome!!  I only made one change. I like the texture of crispie bread crumbs.  So I toasted the bread crumbs  and  added them to the final product.  This recipe was also very easy and quick.  TO make things even quicker, next time I think I will melt the butter and add the garlic, white wine, and lemon juice in one container.(instead of dong it in two steps).  and I think I will just add the olive oil and the garlic  to the hot noodles.  these steps would save time and make less dishes to clean.

The recipe is a good base if you listen to the other reviewers suggestions it is a pretty good dish I couldn't give it 4 stars because following the recipe alone  I can't say that I would have been a happy camper, if you don't listen to anything else REDUCE the breadcrumbs best tip that has been given towards this recipe.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was I added a handful of Parmesan cheese and sprinkled salt and pepper, parsley and a little bit of fresh cilantro. I also used a little more than 5 garlic cloves.   Great recipe!

This dish was so amazing!  I doubled the shrimp and crushed saltines instead of breadcrumbs.  It turned out great!  I added a little chicken broth to the pasta because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce to give it flavor.  It was amazing!  I will use this recipe again and again!

I thought this was very good.  I omitted the wine since I didn't have any and used 6 garlic cloves instead of 5.  Also, reading the other reviews, I put just enough bread crumbs to cover the shrimp in the pan - certainly nowhere near a whole cup.  Definitely recommended.

Very good tasting dish. But 5 cloves of garlic was too much.I reduced it to 3 and reduced the pasta to 1/2 pound. I want shrimp too. Not just pasta. Also reduced the breadcrumbs. !cup was too much. I need to taste shrimp,not bread. Overall very good. I would make this again and would make it with rice next time.

OK, gang.  I haven't left a review in a year or two, but had to on this one.  I'd cut the pasta amount in half and either eliminate the bread crumbs all together or cut it down to a 1/4 or 1/3 cup.  I also tried Panko instead of bread crumbs.  They turned to a white mush.  It was disgusting looking.  There also was barely any sauce.  What a waste of time and ingredients.

Delicious! My husband and I loved it. I let the shrimp marinate for about 30 minutes for extra flavor before cooking. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe! The only thing I did differently was use much less bread crumbs and about half the butter. It was so yummy. Everyone loved it. I also added some parsely at the end.

I re-read the recipe three times and still can't figure it out.  Ths was the worse use of good ingredients I've ever made.   Really wish I had just used pasta, shrimo, garlic, and butter.  If you are gonna try this I would use about 1/10th of the bread crumbs, that's all you taste.

Loved it!  I had leftover cold shrimp and needed a quick dinner, so I only made the shrimp and served it over a bed of lettuce.  Yum!  Next time, I'll try the recipe as written with Linguini

The garlic, butter, wine and lemon was right, but the bread crumbs were just wrong.  Soggy and weird.

I tried a scampi recipe with breadcrumbs last year that was awful. I was a bit nervous about this one but the reviews were so good I decided to risk it. This recipe was delicious! It would have been nice if it had a little more sauce, but I may try adding more wine next time. Yes, there definitely will be a next time!

Very, very good! The first few bites I thought the wine was a little overpowering, but as I kept eating, it all tasted wonderful. I did cut the breadcrumbs down quite a bit, just a light sprinkling. I also served it over thin spaghetti as I'm not a big fettucine fan. Absolutely delicious, thank you! Thanks :)

really good, simple and quick.  although I made it simpler and quicker by skipping the baking part and just adding the wine and lemon juice to the pan right after adding the shrimp, wait 3-5 minutes (or just until pink), add a handful of the breadcrumbs, a little fresh tarragon, and done! (I can't stand overcooked shrimp) I also threw in some frozen peas to the cooking pasta right at the end for color.  Probably took 30 minutes total (minus cleaning the shrimp!)

This recipe is great!  I wouldn't change a thing except on the amount of breadcrumbs that are called for.  Instead of scooping out a cup as the recipe calls for, you should just take tablespoon by tablespoon, sprinkling the breadcrumbs on until the shrimp are coated.  A cup of breadcrumbs is too much. Otherwise, this recipe makes the best shrimp scampi my husband and I have ever had!

I went back and forth between three and four stars so I guess it's three and a half.  I followed the directions, doubling the sauce and the shrimp (we live in Maine and had fresh Maine shrimp, which is smaller) and I just used half a cup of bread crumbs. It was still creamy.  But it was mising something....not sure what.  I will probably make this again and play around with the seasoning.  Thanks Deborah for a good dinner.

This recipe was easy to make and my family loved it.  I was a little skeptical about using bread crumbs, but I'm glad I did.  It was the perfect combo.  I also realized the next day that I forgot the lemon, but no one else seemed to feel like anything was missing from it.  This is a great one!

I found this recipe to very easy and  very tasty. I read the commets of the people before me, the problem with the wine is that you have to let the alcohol from the wine cook off which takes a few minutes after that you should be fine.

I can't recommend this recipe.  If you are looking for true Shrimp Scampi, this doesn't even come close.  I suggest doing it the old fashioned and more messy way of frying the shrimp in a frying pan with lots of garlic, small amount of wine, lemon, and white pepper.  I'd also forget the oil in the pasta, it was much too greasy.  Sorry....

I did not really care for this.  The shrimp came out a little soggy baking it with the breadcrumbs.  Next time I would fry the shrimp and coat it with a little flour or egg and then follow the recipe.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS SO QUICK AND EASY AND IT TASTED GREAT! (AND I CAN'T COOK WELL) I DID DO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS I READ IN ANOTHER REVIEW I USED HALF A LEMON(JUICED) 3 CLOVES OF GARLIC AND ONLY SPRINKLED WITH BREAD CRUMBS. DID SQUIRT ON A LITTLE EXTRA LEMON AFTER. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!OH YEAH AND I USED LESS PASTA ABOUT 1/2 WHAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR. THERE WAS TOO MUCH PASTA FOR THE SHRIMP ANS SAUCE T RUST ME ON THIS!!!

Won't make this recipe again. The bread crumbs were too much, as was the amount of pasta. I prefer broiled shrimp scampi "as is", with a side of pasta or rice, not mixed together. I used large tiger shrimp (2 pounds) and doubled the recipe for a family dinner with my parents. Cooking time for the shrimp also had to be increased an additional 4 minutes to cook them done. I was sorely disappointed.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe to accomodate ingredients on hand in my kitchen. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine, 1/4 cup lemon juice for the squeezed lemon and only used 1/2 lb of pasta. The results were fabulous!!! This is an excellent recipe for entertaining.

this should be named Shrimp Casserole,  not scampi. the dish is dry because it's baked - i would recommend not baking. The shrimp also lack flavor from this recipe without salt and pepper.  Also the breadcrumbs do NOTHING except make mush.   go for a traditional pan-fried scampi instead.

Made this last night. It was a easy quick fix. Family loved it. I used seasoned breadcrumbs and left out the wine since i didnt have any but it turned out great. I also made extra garlic butter sauce and tossed the linguini in that instead of the oil. Great recipe! This ones a keeper!!!

Tasty, but the breadcrumbs were way too overpowering and pasty.  Next time I'll try with half the crumbs.

This was good, but maybe a little too much wine and lemon.  Just my opinion.

I did not care for this. Maybe I did something wrong???  Everyone else seemed to like it....  The recipe called for WAY TOO MANY bread crumbs.  The shrimp turned out "doughy" (from too many bread crumbs).  Also thought the lemon and wine mixture was too overpowering and the pasta was very dry. I made this dish for friends, and luckily was able to salvage it (my bf and I shook off the bread crumbs as best we could, stuck the shrimp on skewers and grilled them).  My bf thought that the breadcrumbs were odd (shrimp de joghne is prepared with breadcrumbs, not scampi).  This recipe is not for me.  Sorry!

I had never made (or eaten) shrimp scampi before but I made this for my mom's birthday since it's her favorite.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Not knowing what to compare it to I would say that I wish there was a little bit of sauce in the scampi pan to spoon over the pasta (or dip bread in).  Overall I thought it was good.  My boyfriend who thought he was going to hate it said it was really good.

Yummers! This was really good. I may have put a little too much garlic in mine but it was still good. I also used this for catfish and it came out very nice.

I am the only one in my family that likes shrimp.  I didn't want it to be very heavy so went light on the amount of sauce and oil.  It was great and a simple recipe for one person.

This turned out to be a real glob of food.  Too thick, no scampi sauce for pasta even tho I used more wine, lemon juice and olive oil when I saw how thick it was.  1 Cup of bread crumbs MUST be a mistake!  A real waste of time and food.

Honestly, I wasn't impressed with this dish - it didn't come out as good as I was expecting it to after reading all of the positive reviews. In my opinion, the wine was just WAY too overpowering. Per reviewer suggestions, I decreased the amount of garlic to 3 cloves, decreased the bread crumbs to 1/4 c. and decreased the amount of pasta to about half of what the recipe called for. I'd suggest also cutting back on the amount of wine and lemon juice as well. I won't be making this again but good luck to those who may - I hope it satisfies your taste buds more than it did mine!

I thought this was an excellent dish. I changed a few things like adding red, yellow, and green peppers to the shrimp and sauce. There was not much sauce to coat the pasta so I made more.

This recipe was very different.. i never has shrimp scampi like this before.  It came out amazing w/ th only problem being the dryness.  I"m not sure how to fix that, but i'd improvise the make the recipe a little more saucier..:)

When I first made this recipe, I was astonished at the look of sheer pleasure on the faces of my father-in-law and husband.  Then I took a taste for myself and completely understood!  Since that day, this dish has become a family favorite.  It is SO easy to make, absolutely delicious and will be with our family recipes for a very long time!

This was absolutely delicious, quick and easy to make.  I agree that the breadcrumbs should be cut back on because it makes the shrimp mushy, but it was still very tasty nonetheless.  My boyfriend vowed to never leave me after trying this out!!!!

12/31/19 - Followed the ingredients list (doubled the sauce) but cooked shrimp on stove top, was very good fresh.  I'm not sure how it will heat up as leftovers but the initial recipe is great as written.

This was the bomb! My family loved it and it was super-simple to make. I adjusted the recipe by using jasmine rice as the bed instead of linguini. I also added a couple of  extra of garlic cloves and completely eliminated step 6 as the extra oil and garlic was unnecessary since there was plenty of liquid to flavor the rice. It was superb! I will be making this again for sure.

This was good. I did a half lb of fresh shrimp,  garlic and a half, same wine, less lemon juice.  For the bread crumbs, i mixed mmm small bowl of panko with non salt seasoning. Lemon pepper, garlic powder    the shrimp got lemon pepper and old bay.  Did the butter garlic in a cast iron griddle very slow and mixed tht with shrimp in glass pan. Into oven. Keep close watch! Shrimps cook quickly   it was delicious! Thank you for this

This was a pretty easy recipe. I always have frozen shrimp on hand. I did as others said and used 1/2 lb linguine (i am feeding 2), less lemon juice, 3 garlic, 1/4 cup bread crumbs to start. I did use a tad more shrimp so i needed a bit more bread crumbs. It didn't stick that much to the shrimp but kinda clumped up for the most part. Maybe I will coat them separately not mix together all in a bowl next time. I also sprinkled w Parmesan at the end. 

The coating of linguine w olive oil and garlic didn't really do much for us. I might next time do a Garlic Red Pepper Noodles to go with this. The sauce thickened up some for us because of the breadcrumbs as i did not add any flour.
Hubby loved the dish.

We spent a lot of time looking for something that tasted good...like we were at a restaurant. This is the closest we've found. 

The first time we made it, we followed it exactly. It was too much bread crumbs to our liking . We did use chicken broth instead of wine. 

We have made modifications to the recipe, but it is all by looks and preference vs measurements. For instance, we cook the shrimp in the oven as we normally make a LOT at one time. We mix olive oil into the butter. We add parsley flakes and we LOVE garlic and have added more garlic into it. Even though we did make modifications...the base flavor was what we were looking for. We also tend to make more of the broth/sauce because the pasta will soak it in. 

We've been making this recipe every 6-8 weeks for probably about two years now. LOVE it.

I made this as- is, but when I make it again I will: 
1. Thaw the shrimp first.
2. Cut the wine by half.
3. Cut the lemon by half.

The crumbs were soggy due to too much liquid, but it was all tasty.

I made it using large shrimp so it needed a little longer cooking time. Also needed to use less bread crumbs. They seemed to overwhelm sauce

I did this receipe but I used frozen shrimp and chicken broth as opposed to wine.  It gives it that same taste and my family and friends raved about it. I used a little more seasoning for my shrimp.  As for the bread crumbs for a thickening don't over do it.  If you use to much you won't have any juice left because the bread crumbs get thick as it sits. I don't have an exact amount just by eye. Delicious.

Yum!!!  Definately a keeper at our house!!  The only thing I did different was used frozen shrimp instead of fresh and I served it with mashed potatoes instead of the noodles.

I gave this a 4 mainly based on flavor and ease of making.  I read the prior reviews and decided to follow the recipe, except use 2 pounds of shrimp and cut back 1/2 the bread crumbs.  I found that I still had to take the shrimp out of the oven before it was crisp to prevent overcooking.  I think the problem is too much wine, next time I will use just 1/4 cup.  The flavor was great and after I mixed the shrimp with the linguini, I didn't even notice that the wine/lemon/breadcrumb mixture started out kinda gooey.  I will definitely make this again, the family loved it!  One other note is to make sure to pat your shrimp dry.

mmmmm...I made this for my husband and I, and it felt like we ate out at a restaurant.   It was so yummy and I served it over thin spaghetti.  I didn't even have lemon juice, so I left it out.  Next time, I might broil the shrimp for a little bit just so the bread crumbs get a little crunch to them - but that's just a thought. Thanks for a great recipe!

We did not care for this, my boyfriend, roommate, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I think the problem was the bread crumbs so maybe leaving those out would have helped.  We served the shrimp and pasta separately and ended up taking the pasta, adding parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and eating that.

This is a great recipe that I turn to often.  I've made adjustments too: a little more garlic because we love it, a little less breadcrumbs.  I also sprinkle a liberal coat of parmesan cheese on top before baking, and turn the broiler on it for the last couple minutes so it's nice and bubbly and just starting to go brown.  It's a great light meal that tastes delicious!

I can not hardly rate this recipe.  I had shrimp, garlic, oil and butter but not much else!  I followed the directions but substituted Sprite for the Lemon Juice (mine had gone bad).  Since I discovered I did not have bread crums, I had a few of those roasted Veggie crackers, I crushed those and used instead.  It was very yummy even with the changes!

I followed this recipe, but made my own variation to it. I sauteed all the ingredients listed and added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire. It was quick, easy, and even my 1 year old liked it. Will make again.

I thought this was fabulous. I never follow a recipe exactly, but I used all the ingredients listed but in different amounts. I only used about 1/4-1/3 cup bread crumbs and skipped the oven altogether by doing it all in a skillet. Very good. Seems like most who didn't like this you can find the reason in the reply. I will make this for guests and feel like they'll love it. Give it a shot just watch the bread crumbs.

I would do as reviewer monchichi suggests if you'd like to give this recipe a try.  After all, it is tried and true.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it was awful.  Way too much lemon juice!  A slimy mess.  And the shrimp weren't completely cooked.  I used frozen uncooked shrimp, but my oven tends to run hot, so I figured it would even out.  We had to microwave the meals before eating them.  Yuck.

There was not much flavor at all. I did as others suggested and added white wine, while cutting down on the broth..it was just bland.
I even added chicken breast to give it a little something, but it did no good. I will not make again!

This turned out very good.  Based on other reviews, I cut the lemon juice in half and decreased the amount of breadcrumbs.  I would say add more garlic and maybe go with a flavored pasta like pepper or spinach flavored.

I was happy I visited the comments, and I followed all of them.  I used half the pasta, half the bread crumbs and I used 1/4c lemon juice instead of fresh lemon.  I forgot to cut the olive oil, though.  I liked it pretty well, although it was a little bit too lemony.. I'd cut that next time.  My boyfriend wasn't crazy about it, and wants to keep looking.  It was incredibly quick and easy to make (and he's really picky....)

We thought this was very good.  I've been looking for a shrimp scampi recipe that includes bread crumbs and this fit the bill. I would like to experiment with a way to brown the crumbs for a crispier feel, either before they are added, or at the end of cooking (perhaps a brief time under the broiler). That's a texture issue and I can fix that. The taste is superb--just the right balance between lemon/wine and garlic.  Plus, it's a snap to prepare. We'll make it often. Paula

delicious recipe and very easy to prepare.  I also used half of the bread crumbs and half the pasta.  I wish I had used a little less wine and a little less lemon.  All in all, very good.  Husband liked is also.

This recipe was good.  I think next time I will add less lemon.  Kind of overpowering but it was still good.

This was so yummy!  The lemon juice adds a nice flavor.  This recipes was really fast, the only real work was mincing the garlic.  The only downfall was it is SUPER garlicy, so if you are not a garlic lover you may want to chop the amount (kids may not like all the garlic).

Our family loves this recipe and will add it to the family favorites. I also decreased bread crumbs to just enough to thicken to your own preference. I also used already prepared shelled and devained shrimp and simmered very low on range top instead of oven. This could not have been any easier.

There was a little bit too much pasta for the amount of shrimp so next time I would cut down on it but otherwise it was delicious and I can't wait to make it again!!!!

I think the breadcrumbs could be left out almost altogether.  1 cup made mind look like bread pudding.  Ick!  But the taste was great once I picked the shrimp out of that mixture.

Easy to make after a full day at work, and quite tasty!  Reduce pasta and breadcrumbs by half, or double all other ingredients.  The more garlic, the better!

My family and I enjoyed it. I used 7 cloves of garlic and felt I could have added more.  Additionally, 1 cup of bread crumbs is overstated.  I found 1/2 cup to be sufficient. Thanks!

I would cut the liquid by half to get the real flavor.  But it was good.
