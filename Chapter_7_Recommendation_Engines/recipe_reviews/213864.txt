Dec 22nd: This recipe was a HIT! The changes I made were perfect. I made 33 enchiladas! I did not need to buy 2 bags of the (Costco) shredded Mexican 4 cheeze mix. I now have a whole bag left. I would do this recipe again in a heartbeat.
  Dec. 16th: I am making this recipe for a dinner party of 23 people.  I made one up tonight to test the recipe and I liked it alot.  My changes are: I omitted the cumin because I don't like cumin (go figure). What I decided after my taste test is I am going to split the recipe up and make one 1/2 with the salsa and make the other half with green chile verde sauce that comes in the cans. This is because the salsa is medium on the heat scale and I want to offer a choice. I don't agree with the other reviewer that the enchinadas were dry - they were moist as can be. Also, I bought (Costco) the shredded Mexican 4 cheeze mix to save time. Oh - and Costco will sell already cooked chicken breast meat  - it took a while to shred but it was worth it. I think this is a great recipe!

Pretty good. My VERY picky husband liked it! Next time I will make more of the filling to go into the tortillas.

These are the BEST! I make it with chile verde sauce and add extra sour cream and cheese on top when served.  Yummm!

These were soooo good. I layered the tortillas because I had some that were a bit stale, and it came out perfectly.  The whole family loves them. The way I know if something is good is he amount of silence at the table. You could have heard a pin drop while we were eating.

Might have been better with a green or red enchilada sauce instead of the salsa topping.  The texture was a little dry for enchiladas.  I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious quick meal to put together while my lil boys were napping! I added fresh mushrooms just because I wanted to use them up....also added a can of already made enchilada sauce that I happened to have on hand. Very very good, thanks! Also used leftover turkey.

LOVE THIS!!! I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and served with sliced avocado in addition to lettuce and tomato.  This is the best enchilada recipe I've found!

YUM-MMMYYY!! We use freshneasy's restaurant style salsa, all fresh, and this is GOOD!!!!!! I actually double the ingredients portions, because otherwise there's not enough in each tortilla. But then we are greedy...
