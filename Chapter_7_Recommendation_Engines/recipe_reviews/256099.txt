We really like this recipe.  When I'm in a hurry, I make it with those polenta rolls cut into slices.  Also great.

Made this for our Italian Christmas dinner.  It was a hit all  around.  The only change I'd make is to reduce the salt.  The parmesan gives it enough salty flavor.

We liked it, although I don't know how you can stir that stuff for 7 minutes! It went from a liquid/slurry to hardened concrete in a minute and a half flat! I will certainly try it again.

I  skipped allowing it set and immediately placed it in a piping bag and piped onto a tray lined with parchment paper. I used goat milk, added a pinch of cayenne and freshly grated nutmeg. It was a hit over the xmas holidays and I'm making it again!

I liked the idea of this dish but it didnâ€™t turn out as I had hoped. I think my dough cooked too fast on the stove top and I think I need to add a little more water next time. They turned out dense and patsy rather than soft and creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside. My husband enjoyed it the kids were indifferent and happy to have a vehicle for my sauce. I will try it again and see if I can tune what I did wrong.
