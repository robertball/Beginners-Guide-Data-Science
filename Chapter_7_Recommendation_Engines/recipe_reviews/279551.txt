Tasty, with a little heat. Made for 3 adults, with all- beef hot dogs. Yum. Adult son said, "Next time use more adult meat, like polkska keilbasa".  Will do, since we all liked it. Maybe 5 stars then

Black pepper to taste needed.  Also added some fresh garlic.  Other than that, was quite tasty and filling.  Next time I'll try adding some cooked macaroni or a cubed baked potato.
