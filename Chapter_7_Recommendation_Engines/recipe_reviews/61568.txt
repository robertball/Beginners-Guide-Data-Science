For a very low-fat brownie, these are surprisingly good.  They are very chocolatey and moist, but it's still obvious they aren't the "real thing".  We list them most topped with frozen yogurt or fruit to make them seem richer.  I used vanilla yogurt to make it a smoother flavor (10 Tbsp of yogurt equals a 6 oz container).  I'd make again!

This is not bad for a low fat brownie, though the texture is slightly rubbery. I had better results with low fat yogurt than with fat free. Overall, good for reduced fat!

I'm more of a chewy-cakey brownie person than dense and fudgy, but I found these delightful.  I did make a few changes to enhance the flavor.  I used fat-free plain yogurt and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp baking soda,  and about 1 tsp balsamic vinegar (it really enhances chocolate nicely).  I had to increase the baking time by a few minutes too.  Nice flavor.

Very yummy (and bonus that it is low fat). I use low fat vanilla yogurt and omit the vanilla. So fudgy (and yummy with some chocolate chips in it too!)

These were rubbery and inedible. My BF who will eat *anything* won't eat these. (And I followed the recipe to a "T", no substitutions or anything.)

this recipie was bad! The cocoa was too strong and there was a weird after taste, maybe by the yogurt? Not the best brownie recipie, but I was curious to try it, and im curious on how to improve it.

Our family love these brownies.  If you only like very sugary sweet brownies then they may not appeal to you, as they have a distinct yoghurt flavor. We are addicted to them!

These were super yummy!! I used sucanat instead of white sugar and fresh vanilla bean instead of extract, and then added chocolate chips. I also used 3 eggs because I have really small eggs from young chickens right now. These were great!!

I have made lowfat brownies before using yogurt, but with a brownie mix. I like to make things from scratch, so tried this recipe. It was not good at all. the texture was like rubber and the taste was not even good. Use a regular box brownie mix and add a cup of yogurt and small amt. of water. this works great and is lowfat too.   Sue

I *never* give a low low rating, but I did not care for this at all. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because it will look like you're eating chocolate when you're on a diet. But truth be told, this is just bland. It's not sweet and maybe using full-sugar, full-fat vanilla yogurt would help, but then it would not be lower fat. I will never make this again.

I used lowfat Vanilla yogurt, too, instead of plan yogurt and the vanilla extract. I thought they tasted great, but the texture was way off. They were very rubbery, like other reviews have said. When I brought them to work, I had to call them "bars" instead of brownies, so that people would try them.

This was great!  I used half splenda and half sugarand low-fat vanilla yogurt.  I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla (since I used the vanilla yogurt)and I like almond flavoring.

Disgusting!  I would give these 0 stars if I could.  Horrible texture & taste.  A complete waste of good ingredients.  You are much better off making full fat brownies.  These were bitter, crumbly, & sticky.  No one liked them!  I had to throw this nasy mess out for the birds.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.

These are very good chewy, almost fudgey brownies.  I am so glad they are healthier because it is hard to stop eating them.  I added a half cup of chopped walnuts though because they just wouldn't be brownies without them.

Excellent brownies! I used the suggestions Jen gave and 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I think the balsamic really helped.

This is a good recipe!  I modified it a bit as I'm diabetic... instead of sugar, I used 1/2 cup of agave nectar then increased the flour to 3/4 cup, and it turned out realy well, fudgy and chewy!

A bit weird - a bit sour, cakey, not truly brownie-like, but definitely edible.  Just go for the real ones next time!

Pretty good. I agree with other reviewers: the texture is a bit strange. But the taste is decent. I like that there is no oil/butter so the fat/calories are less than a typical brownie. I'll make these for me, but wouldn't bring them to a bbq or anything.

just made these today...i used gluten free flour instead of normal as i am wheat intolerant. They were really good! i was worried about the yogurt as it has quite a sharp taste but it seems to compliment the chocolate well! Loved the shiny topping and they were so gooey. Would definatly make again.

These were disappointing. They had an odd texture due to the yogurt- sort of mushy. Also, they were bitter. This is not a moist, fudge brownie. Too much cocoa.

These brownies, sadly, were not good at all. The texture was really rubbery, and the flavor was just not there (not chocolatey). Couldn't even tolerate them as low calorie.

These were good. I was really impressed with how good they were for their very low fat and calorie content! Only 4 stars because after cooling they weren't as good and slightly spongy...I think I'd prefer them to be more cakelike. Otherwise will definetely make again and again! This recipe is a keeper!

I did not care for this recipe. My brownies turned out like a rubbery pancake. I added everything. Did the correct baking time. and the right tempurature.

Wonderful!  I love the chewy texture.  As my boyfriend said, it's like eating pudding baked into a bar.  Not the most decadent brownie's I've ever had, but definitely the best low-fat recipe I've tried - and I've tried a lot!  Also the first time Hersey's cocoa has tasted chocolatey enough for me.

I have to agree with other bakers that these brownies turn out more rubbery than fudgy. They are also slightly bitter. If I make them again, I will substitute 3/4 c brown sugar for the whole cup white and vanilla yogurt for additional flavor. To sweeten it, I may add frosting. When I made them, I substituted 1/2 c of the flour with whole wheat and dropped a piece of semi-sweet chocolate in the center of each brownie.

I used half splenda and half sugar, I think next time I try these I'll use all sugar and even add another fourth of a cup or something, they were pretty bitter, but have potential, certainly not as bad as a lot of people said... but not as good as others said either.

these were absoulutly amazing. I made them with vanilla yogurt, but I think a coffee yogurt would do well.

My husband and I thought they were pretty good but the kids did not like at all.  (No suprise there.)  I used splenda but next time I will use sugar.  You could taste the splenda a little too much in the brownie.  Thanks

This recipe is reallly good, especially for a low-fat brownie.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was wonderful.  I'll definitely make these again!

I just made these for my family and they turned out really well.  I used fat free Yoplait banana yogurt(all I had in the fridge) and it added a nice bit of extra flavor. I also cut out 1/2 the sugar and put in Splenda (12 packets=1/2 cup).  They don't have the same flaky, crumbly consistency as regular browies in the box, but the are a GREAT low fat alternative.  Very moist and chewy.  My 3 year old keeps saying  "I like it Mommy!"  and he is a very picky eater! Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe others' expectations are too high...this is a fantastic diet brownie recipe.  I would like these even if I weren't watching what I eat.  Very chocolatey, very fudgy, very satisfying.  Definitely better than anything Snackwell's makes!  I used nonfat sugar free vanilla yogurt and added some chopped walnuts.  I did use real sugar and eggs - no Splenda or egg beaters here (don't think the texture would be right).  Thanks Emily!

I expected these brownies to taste like my mom's fat free brownies - sweet, chocolatey, moist and overally yummy.  Very disappointed to find out they taste like burnt yogurt and not very brownie-esque - definitely using mom's recipe next time.

MMMM...lovely...and you can cut the sugar in half by using half molasses (and don't forget to add a teaspoon of baking soda for every cup of molasses you use). Use a half cup of molasses and a half teaspoon of baking soda for this recipe.

Followed recipe to a tee, but these brownies came out tasting too cocoa-ey! Didn't understand why the added extra flour but like I said- followed recipe. I'll make again but try other additions or subtractions to it. Still, thanks for the recipe to help with low fat desserts when you're trying your best to watch what you eat and have a taste for something sweet!

They are not for people who like things to be super sweet. They are sweet but not as sweet as most brownies I have had other than that they are very good.

First time I made it, it tasted good but was a bit rubbery.  The next  time, II used 6 large non-stick cupcake/pudding molds and only cooked for 20 min. It came out moist and not rubbery at all. The third time I made it, I added  crushed raspberries.   It came out even better.   Pretty good.

Great for cravings! But could use some more texture. I wish I baked some almond or coconut shavings in them. It feels too cakey but still yummy!

They smelled really good in the oven, but tasted bland, and the yogurt was a terrible flavour in them.  I LOVE chocolate, and although these were nice and dark due to the cocoa, they were the worst thing I have made in a very long time.  And yes, I know these were diet brownies, but even so I would never make these again!

Very good for a low-fat brownie taste, but the texture is a little different.  I used FF yogurt, but strained it first to thicken it up.  I also added 1/2 t baking powder.

Although the measurements were a little weird (10 tbs of yogurt!), I loved this recipe. I followed the directions exactly (used fat free yogurt) and the brownies turned out perfect! The only problem was, my husband insisted on frosting. So much for low fat!

If you're looking for super rich brownies, these aren't for you.  For a lower-fat alternative, they're surprisingly good!
