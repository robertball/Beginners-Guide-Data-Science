Though I like this cake I give it a four because despite the ingredients it was not very flavourful unless you aged it. For the first few days of the life of this cake it was quite unexceptional and bland. My only diversion from the recipe was instead of adding plain chocolate pieces I had added chocolate with chile peppers because I wanted something with deep ethnic flavour. I topped the cake with marscapone cheese papaya's and strawberries. I couldn't even taste chocolate the first day I baked it. So I put it away and then a week later heated it up again and it was one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had! I recommend this recipe completely if you have the patience to age the cake for the fine flavors to come out.

This is my grandmother's cake. Very moist and delicious - I think this cake cake appeals to grownups more than to children. There are a lot of flavors here and my children have more simple tastes. It was really fun to make. I made it in a small bundt pan.

Great cake - dense and moist and yummy. The apricot and ginger taste fabulous. We're planning to make this for our wedding cake!

What a remarkable idea! It might be called "Chocolate Trail Mix Cake.":-) I cannot wait to try it and after that I might go back and raise the rating to a five. (I give recipes a four just for having chocolate in them.):-)

This cake looks very good I will definately try this and the spice comes from the ginger.

This was great... I made it for book club and everyone loved it! I didn't have apricots so I used dried cranberries and I also didn't have any bittersweet chocolate so I substituted semi sweet chocolate chips. I'd definitely make this again.

This chocolate cake is divine. It really does have chunks of dark chocolate and apricots like it says in the description! It was a little difficult to blend in the marzipan at the beginning and I had to crush it a bit with a fork but but once you added the eggs - it was much easier. It tasted even better on day two. Will be making again for Christmas!
