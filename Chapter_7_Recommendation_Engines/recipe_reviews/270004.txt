I really like this recipe. It is the same as Super Delicious Zuppa Toscana, with the cauliflower being subbed out for the potatoes. I had made the other recipe and didn't like it as much as I had hoped, so for this recipe, I used hot Italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes. It made all the difference for me!

This is the perfect soup on a cold winter night. I had chicken Italian sausage so that is what I used . will defiantly make this again sprinkled some Parmesan crisps on the top for extra favor.

I left out the bacon (not a bacon lover) and used more broth than called for (to feed a big family) and it was fabulous. It's spicy with the crushed red pepper, so cut the pepper in half if you like it a little milder.

My kids (12, 13, &14) loved it, too.

Great soup!  I made it dairy free.  I omitted the cream and to give more body I mashed 3 florettes of steamed cauliflower and added to the broth.

I changed the original recipe quite a bit, from making this wonderful soup in the past!
I made my own turkey Italian sausage (not a fan of store bought), instead of heavy cream I substituted coconut milk, and used kale instead of spinach!  

AMAZING! Will for sure make again!
