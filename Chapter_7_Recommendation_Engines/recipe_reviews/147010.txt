I love this lemonade - it's got the perfect blend of lemon sour and vanilla musk. I use one or two more lemons than the recipe calls for because I like my lemonade nice and sour, and I largely omit the rinds to avoid the bitterness of the lemon pith. I am always grabbing 10-12 lemons at the store to stock up for this recipe!

It's my pleasure to be the first to rate this recipe. With just a hint of vanilla aftertaste, it tastes something like if Orange Julius were to make lemonade? It has just enough sweetness to bring out the vanilla flavor, but not too much to overwhelm the tartness of the lemon. Also, I'm not sure if the recipe is intended to use the entire lemon rind and not just the zest(?), as lemon pith is quite bitter. I HIGHLY recommend using Meyer lemons if you can find them. They're sweeter and much more fragrant; plus, they have minimal pith, so you can put the rinds directly into the blender without zesting!

I have a vita-mix, so I tried the recipe as is and it was too bitter.  So I made another batch, with 4 lemons pealed, sugar, and vanilla.  Blended this and then added the water and replaced most of the water with ice.  Yum! 5 stars with my adjustments.

Pretty excited about this recipe.. Never made Lemonade before and this recipe made it soo EASY! (and Yummy!).  Lemon Trees everywhere.. and all those Lemon's go to waste.  Grabbed 3 HUGE Lemons from the Neighbors tree.. and WHOLA! 10 min later Super Yummy Treat.  Poured some in small Glasses, added some raspberries and sliced strawberries and by the AM I'll have delicious Lemon Icy's!  FABULOUS!

This lemonade is awesome as is.  I've made it twice now, once as written, and the second time, I only used 1/2 C sugar.  I like my lemonade a little less sweet, and a little more tart.  Will definitely be a summer staple here!

Husband thinks this is delicious, and I do too! I removed the peel and pith in the same manner that you peel a pineapple. This cuts out the bitterness. I added a splash of bottled lemon juice. I tripled it and added the zest of two whole lemons. I added the entire peel of half of one lemon.

Made this to go with dinner (whole roasted chicken and sage red potatoes / carrots / green beans / onion)...went perfectly with the meal. Just enough vanilla flavor but recognizable as a lemonade. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

good but not a very strong vanilla taste - i don't think i could taste it at all... and it was a lot of work... i think i'd rather just squeeze my lemons and zest them than puree the whole thing in the blender and then i could skip the step where you strain it... which was kind of messy

This lemonade has an excellent flavor, with just a subtle hint of vanilla, though it turned out a little too bitter for my tastes.  I omitted the rinds and added finely grated lemon zest instead, but next time I'll either skip this step entirely or maybe use the zest from a single lemon only, to counteract the bitterness.  With that minor enhancement, I'll bet this lemonade turns into a five-star rating in my recipe box.

mmmmmm yummy! Im new to making homemade lemonade so I skipped the rind part and just blended the pulp and juice in a blender with the sugar water. I like it...the vanilla adds a great touch!
