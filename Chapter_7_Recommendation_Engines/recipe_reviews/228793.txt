I halved the recipe, b/c I wanted to use a crumb topping.  The crust tasted fine, but I had to roll it extremely thin for it to cover my 9" glass pie plate.  I prebaked this for 7 minutes on 425 before adding my fruit filling.

I halved this recipe to make a pumpkin pie. I really needed a little more crust because it didn't spread far enough up the side of my pie plate. It was easy enough for a novice pie crust maker to make, so I would probably make it again.

Actually this recipe did not work for me until I compared it to some others and decided to try adding an egg. After adding one egg, the mixture came together instead of just crumbling.

Thanks so much for this recipe. I had thawed what I thought was a double crust and was making an apple pie. This was so easy, worked perfectly and tasted great.

11.23.18 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228793/grandmas-very-easy-pie-crust/ ... Emma, this crust is a lifechanger, but use these amounts: 2 1/4c flour, 1t salt, 1/2c oil, 1/3c COLD skim or lowfat milk (I suppose fullfat would work, but I don't buy it so haven't tried.).  Peel & flip as you go.  Doesn't freeze well.  Also, best to use right after mixing; or let warm up a bit if you refrigerate.  It won't be fun rolling if too cold.

I used this to make a pumpkin pie. It tasted fine, but it was impossible to roll and work with.  Half wasn't enough, and I ended Up using all of it. It was really thick, but it tasted great.
