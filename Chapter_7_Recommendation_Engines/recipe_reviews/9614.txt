These cookies taste okay.  I made them for a holiday party and very few were eaten.  I believe it is because they are not a very pretty Christmas cookie and therefore do not look appealing compared to other Christmas cookies I prepared.  I would not make them again.

Yes, I will make it again.  I will mix my batter into the fruit more thoroughly next time.  It has a nice flavor, but I had more batter on one side than the other.  Took a plate to my neighbor for review, and got a 10.
