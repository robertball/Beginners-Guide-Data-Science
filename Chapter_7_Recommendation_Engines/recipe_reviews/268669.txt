Love this recipe. I have been making a similar dish for awhile and decided to try this one because I thought the addition of the half and half would be a good fit.  I was right. I have to say that shrimp without garlic just is a letdown. I love garlic so I used a whole garlic and I marinated the shrimp in garlic powder as well. Added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes as well as 2 tablespoons of paprika. I also used olive oil along with the butter and used my homemade blueberry wine because it was all I had on hand. This one is my new go to. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is so good and so easy! I did liberally sprinkle the shrimp with Old Bay seasoning and let set for 1/2 hr. before cooking. Also added more garlic. Can’t thank you enough for posting this great recipe! It’s a keeper.

I make this dish often, usually when I'm runny late and need something quick for dinner. I always have pasta in the pantry and shrimp in the freezer. This dish is a snap to make.

This is wonderful!  I made it for me and my husband, but it would make a great entree for guests too.  So easy - I used pre-cooked shrimp and only had the grated parmesan in a can, but it was still delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely wonderful! We didnt have enough pasta for 4 people, so I also made some Spanish rice to go with it.  My whole family loved it.

This was creamy and delicious!  I used heavy cream instead of half and half and a pinch of oregano instead of parsley which I did not have.

Made it pretty much as the recipe called for..... OK, OK, so we like more garlic in things!   But we thought this was pretty good and we did enjoy it very much.  However, we both decided that we prefer regular Shrimp Scampi (emphasis on the lemon/wine/butter marriage w/o the parm) to this.  Will stick with the tried and true.

Perfect! I used Angel Hair pasta because that’s what I had, and added some chopped up artichoke hearts. I’ve made variations of this recipe before but never added the half and half. I think it made the dish!

This is quick meal, I liked the concept of it, but , I would use heavy cream next time and add pepper.
