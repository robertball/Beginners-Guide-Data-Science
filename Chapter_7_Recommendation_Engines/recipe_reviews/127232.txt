Fabulous recipe!  To make this a relatively guilt-free pleasure, I used 4 (8 oz) packages of reduced-fat cream cheese and used fat free sour cream.  The end result was a more fluffy-textured cheesecake that didn't sacrifice on flavor.  I garnished the top with fresh sliced strawberries.

Very good recipe. I actually make this for my Dad because he is diabetic. I do not use the crust, I use splenda instead of sugar. Very good.

LOVED this cheesecake!  It's been many years since I last made a cheesecake but after many dissapointments with store-bought, I offered to bring a homemade NY style cheese cake to a family dinner.  I used a spring form pan and a pan of water in the stove.  I did get one crack but otherwise this cheese cake turned out PERFECT!  A lot of critical mouths had seconds and thirds of this great recipe.  Don't be concerned if you get a crack in the cake because it will still taste great and can be easily covered with topper. I read many reviews and the do's and don'ts.  DO: use room temp ingredients.  DO: use name brand ingredients.  DO: bake for an hour then turn off the oven and let sit in the oven with the door closed for several hours.

It's a fuss-free, simple and straight forward recipe. Great for newbies like me who are just experimenting with simple baking. If you do not have a sweet tooth, do not add sugar to the base. Just the cookies and melted butter will do. I even reduced the sugar further in the cheese mixture and it tastes great. My family enjoyed it so much. Nice and smooth texture too. I will bake it again :)

Total indulgence! Didn't have a 9" spring form, so put in a large glass pie pan. Had a little goo left that wouldn't fit in the pan w/o overflowing. Even tho we had eaten a large dinner, none of us could resist a small wedge of  dessert.

I have made this cheescake for a couple years now.  The previous recipe called for strawberry jam.  I will admit, it seems like forever to make, but it is well worth it!!!!  I have to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The good thing about this recipe is that it makes enough that I can take half to work for everyone and still have plenty at home!

I added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also used the Honey Made Graham cracker crust recipe which is on the box for a perfect crust. Don't over beat or your cheesecake will crack on top. Take it out when the middle is wobbly. Your cheesecake should never brown. If it is, you have over-baked it.

What a great cheesecake recipe. I did not use cherries, I just wanted a plain delicious cheesecake.  I had been worried about making this cheesecake for years, it was easy. Only difference I did, I left the cheesecake in the oven to cool off over night,(this was to help prevent it from cracking) the cake did crack. The cheesecake was still delicious.

This cheesecake is incredible!  I used the canned cherry filling as suggested although I think the cheesecake can stand alone. May try blueberries or strawberries next time.

Easy to make and turned out just right. I doubled the cookie crust, but not the sugar and butter, and it gave a perfectly textured crust. I like my cheesecake simple, so no fruit topping or lemon zest for me. I tried it after cooling for 4 hours and didn't like the fluffy result, but then tried it after a night in the refrigerator and it was perfectly dense and creamy! Will definitely make it again.

This cheesecake is delicious. It turned out OK. but only because I left the cheesecake in an opened oven and it browned slightly on one side.

I have made quite a few cheesecakes the last couple of years, almost for every special occasion.  I would normally use the recipe from Philly of a classic cheesecake.  But after losing that recipe I used this one, which, unlike the classic version, calls for sour cream and flour.  Well once it was served, I noticed how very under-cooked and raw the filling seemed even though it looked cooked everywhere else on the outside.  I was very disappointed with this, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why this would happen.  After finding the recipe recently that I had lost months ago, I made that one and still the cheesecake came out raw and goopy.  I think it's supposed to be fluffy but dense.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I had originally thought it was this recipe that was off.  But after making both I realize it must be me or my oven.  I like this cheesecake recipe because it is so simple and does taste good, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  It would've had 5 but that goopy filling ruined it.

Made recipe as instructed. It was very good, but I would have preferred a little more creaminess. Perhaps I should have baked it only 50 minutes and let it stay in the oven with the oven off as another reviewer suggested..

Delicious! A bit on the sweet side, I would cut down the sugar next time by about 1/4 cup. I also love crust, so I might increase the crust to cake ratio for next time. Overall this was a really tasty cake!

Made exactly as written. Very good cheesecake. Topped with cherry pie filling and whipped cream. Is quite heavy so very good if that is what you like. If your looking for something with a lighter fluffier texture this is not it.

Full disclosure, this is the first New York style cheesecake I've ever made so consider me a work in progress. I'd have to say it turned out pretty good, not great. It cracked when cooling, no biggie. I assume I mixed too much but I really tried not to mix any more than necessary to blend the ingredients. The outer portion of the cheesecake turned out a tad bit dry (dark springform pan per directions). I'll try 10 minutes less cook time next time around. The biggest thing is the taste seemed a little off, maybe a little earthy tasting, especially the outer drier portion. I used name brand ingredients, no light stuff and I was a little disappointed in the flavor.  Perhaps it's influenced by what you're accustomed to eating. I love Trader Joe's New York Style cheesecake and was hoping this would taste similar. Next time, I'll add a little more vanilla, bake a little bit shorter time, and maybe try medium sized eggs rather than the extra large sized eggs I used this time around.

I love to make these for Holidays as well as baby showers! This is an excellent recipe and I go to it every time. Want a little change? Try adding Oreo crumbs, chocolate syrups swirled, etc. The sky is the limit on this one!

I have been making this for years. Close to 8 years now, it's always such a hit. My family thinks I'm so talented. Little do they know this is not a hard thing to make at all. Try it out!!! You will be glad you did. There is so much you can do with a basic cheesecake recipe,  this is such a great staple to bring to potlucks or as a dessert to a dinner you've been invited to.  It is a bit time consuming, mostly because I have found it needs to sit and cool for about an hour before removing the spring form pan. Then I wrap in plastic wrap and put in the fridge overnight.  Well worth the effort!!

This cheesecake was really good. However, I don't know if it was being at a higher altitude or what but it came out a little dry for my expectation. I would recommend baking this cheesecake around 60 minutes or a few less to make it a little more creamier. But I did have a lot of compliments and will be trying this recipe again.
