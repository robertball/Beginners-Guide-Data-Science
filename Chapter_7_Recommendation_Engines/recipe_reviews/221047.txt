First thing I noticed when fixed as directed is entire pie batter will not fit into deep dish pie shell.  No matter, I discarded what would not fit to edges of crust.  Now during the baking process much of the pie filling is oozing out and spilling over the edges of the crust.  The only change I made to the recipe was using what one reviewer suggested - browned butter instead of corn oil.  I will come back later and review for taste.  But I knew when I saw the ingredients, it was probably not going to fit into a 9 inch deep dish pie shell.  Also the other reviewers here (at least 2) did not state they followed the recipe here ... only comments like "I've used this recipe for years" - the exact one?  And "yummy, give me another piece" - did they fix it as directed or just looking at the picture?  As I said, I will come back later and rate for taste but based on what's oozing over the edges, I should have discarded even more filling than I did to adjust to the deep dish pastry shell.

I have been making this pie for 10 years now. I usually brown the butter but I do not use oil. This is the staple of our Annual Kentucky Derby Party each year and it is always a huge hit!!

I made this for a Derby party this year. I did not use the corn oil and instead just used browned butter as a previous review mentioned. I also used 60% cacao chips instead of semisweet. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. I agree that there is way too much filling - I ended up making two muffin-sized pies in addition to the main one. It was actually great because I was able to taste what I made without cutting into the actual pie prematurely. The pie turned out really well! It had a crust that resembled a cookie, and was gooey inside as I expected. The one thing I would change would be to melt the chocolate chips and mix it in after the sugars or something. My chocolate chips all sank to the bottom of the pie. Super tasty still, but a little crunchy. I would like the flavor and texture to be better balanced throughout the whole pie. It is a recipe I will keep! I did receive several compliments on it this year!

The recipe did not work for me. It says to add 1 and 1/8 CUPS of butter!! I have researched the recipe and others say to add 1/2 cup of butter.

I made this for our Derby party this year. It was fantastic! Definitely an authentic derby pie! (Though I'm not a native Louisvillian, I lived there for 7 years and grew to love it as my 2nd hometown:) The only thing I have negative to say about it has already been said by another reviewer - there is WAY too much filling to fit in even a 9" deep dish pie plate. My oven was a mess after making it! But, everyone agreed it tasted great. Thanks for the recipe, LYNNINMA!

This pie was wonderful!  Being a Louisvillian, I've had lots of Derby pie and tried their receipes, but this one is the best by far.

The person that added this recipe was sitting back laughing as I cleaned my oven at midnight on derby eve! There is enough filling in this recipe for 2 9-inch pie crusts. I was attempting to make 2 pies and had enough for 4! It is delicious but next time I won't double the recipe and I will add more bourbon.

First time ever making a none fruit pie. I was skeptical, but once I tasted it......DOUBT GONE. If you're using the ziplock disposable pan, the recipe is good for two pie fillings. If you're using a ceramic heavy duty pan that it fits just perfect. You have to make the edges taller in order for it not to spill over. Also place a pan under you pie pan just in case there is a spill.

I loved this pie!!!  I did have to make some changes out of necessity.  I traded toasted coconut for nuts- cause we’re not “nutty” people.  Then I used Smokin’ Scotch instead of bourbon, since that’s what I had on hand.  This pie turned out beautiful and tasty!!!  I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this as a deep dish pie.  I doubled the amount of bourbon. The pie did bubble over so it required a cookie sheet under the pan. It took 65 minutes to bake completely and was a big hit at the Kentucky Derby party!
