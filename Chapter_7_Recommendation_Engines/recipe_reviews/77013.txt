The name of this recipe doesn't do it justice as there are SO many wonderful flavours in this dish! I will be making this again, but next time I will use less sour cream on top of the chicken... I found it a little too much (and I LOVE sour cream!). The potatoes were the best I've ever tasted, and I may keep them separate from the rest of the dish next time. Also, I will use my food processor for the sun-dried tomato/spinach mixture, as it would not come together in the blender, even after adding a little olive oil to help emulsify it. But a very tasty chicken dish, for sure!

Delicious & versatile! I can't even explain how much I loved this! I used a Vidalia onion instead of red, no green peppers, 2 cloves garlic, frozen spinach, salt and freshly ground black pepper, and fat-free sour cream (couldn't even tell the difference!!!). I added about a tbsp. of butter to the potato mix as well. Next time, I will leave the parmesan out of the spinach mix, because it stuck all over the bottom of my non-stick pan when I sauteed it with the chicken. You could make this vegetarian, substituing your favorite veggie for the chicken.

I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and thin cut chicken breasts instead of regular because that's what I had on hand. I didnt think it was very quick and I had my doubts about it while I was making it, but it turned out WONDERFUL! I will definately make this again, and again, and again.

My husband and I were looking for a quick, tasty meal.  Although not quick, this dish was very good!  The recipe suggests 15 minutes prep time, but it took us more like 30 minutes.  Instead of chicken tenderloins, we used two large boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips.  The pesto mix was incredible, and it would probably be great on its own, tossed with some pasta.  Overall, tasty, but prep time long.  Would be best cooked for a weekend meal when you have more time.

I'm a single girl and a picky eater, so I just used the pesto mixture with the chicken and the recipe was great!  Pesto mixture for me included some garlic, spinach, sun dried tomato, a little sour cream, a little parmesean cheese and a dash of lemon.  Stuffed the chicken breast with it and fried it in a pan.  Fantastic!

Excellent recipe.  I had no bell peppers and had only frozen spinach but the flavor was excellent, and easy to prepare.  Rather skimpy serving for 6 though.  It needed bread(I made a lightly herbed quick bread)as well as vegetables, to round out the meal.  I will make it again.

Very tasty.  I used bok choy in the pesto mixture instead of spinach.  I would probably bump up the garlic next time I made it.

I rated this recipe a 4 because I had a few complaints about it as written. The taste however was a 5 star!  My complaints could be eliminated with some changes in the procedure. LOVED the potatoes!  The spinach mixture must be mixed in a food processor- the blender just wouldn't puree- even with some evoo added. I would saute the chicken without the pesto & maybe add it before baking.  It burned my pan horribly & probably lost a lot of flavor.  I will keep this recipe because I loved the flavor & will experiment with the method of putting it altogether.

Lots of prep and clean up does not fit my definition of easy and I wouldn't bother with this again on a week night. On the upside, I liked all the fresh ingredients.  I did double the potatoes but could have quadrupled as their really wasn't alot of potatoes for the amount of meat. I do not own a food processor and did have problems with the spinach and sundried tomatoes in the blender. I will have to find another way to make this mixture as ideally I would have added alot more spinach and a couple more tomatoes. My husband thought this recipe was fantastic.

Flavor was good but appearance was unappealing. I ended up with a watery mess in the bottom of the pan.

This was a pretty good dish, but not that great and not worth all the work. You have to use a food processor, skillet, pot, casserole dish, chopping board...who has time for all that clean up?  Not me. Won't be making this one again.

Good... but a little odd, too.  The chicken and sun-dried tomato 'pesto' came out almost as a separate recipe, and need some tweaking on their own... the potato/green pepper/onion side was amazing, however.  I'm going to tweak the chicken a bit and try again... this time either without the sour cream on top, or with doubling the 'pesto' mixture and mixing half of it with the sour cream when I bake.  All said, very good!

This was very good, there are a lot of good flavors here.  I made a few changes.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but I still kept to the recipe for the most part.  I chopped chicken breast into the size of tenders instead of using actual tenders.  I used red pepper instead of green.  I omitted the onion and sprinkled a little onion powder in the potatoes instead.  I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil because I love them and used the oil from the tomatoes in place of the regular olive oil.  I used fat free sour cream.  I added some extra spinach, Parmesan and garlic, I am not sure how much exactly because I eye-balled the extra.  I also left the skin on the potatoes.  I would definitely make this again.

My kids really loved this recipe.  I did substituted basil for spinach because I didn't have any spinach and left out the sun dried tomatoes.  They ate ALL of it!

Great chicken dish. Not that pretty to look at it but tasted fab. Sure there was some prep but the mix of flavors was really worth it. I struggle to find good chicken dishes that don't have condensed soup in them. This one is a keeper. B.T.W, I didn't put the whole cup of sour cream on top - probably about half and it was just fine.

I didn't have spinach on hand, so I made it without.  My husband, who never says much about what I make, said "Wow" after his first bite - this is delicious.  Thanks!

I've made many wonderful recipes from this site,  but from my opinion this was not one of them. I followed the directions as written. My boyfriend and I found the texture unappealing and the flavor lacking.

This was an excellent recipe. I was worried that my kids wouldn't like it because of the spinach and sun dried tomatoes, but it was cleverly masked by the flavor of the potatoes and the sour cream.

The flavors were very good, but I think that instead of potatoes, this would have been better suited for pasta.

I wish I could have done half stars, cuz I really ALMOST liked it 4.  This was a very dry dish, sour cream is not liquid and made very dry mashed potatoes.  I added a splash of milk in the mixing process b/c I worried if I added too much another step might add liquid that I wasn't counting on.  The spinach stuff didn't want to puree in the food processor, so I added a little olive oil to let it smooth out.  It *does* need a little salt & pepper (and I am usually the last person EVER to add salt to a dish), maybe in the potatoes or tomato/spinach mixture.  The cheese in the t/s mix ended up burning slightly while the chicken cooked, maybe next time the parm can be sprinkled on the finished dish.  Otherwise I did like the flavors and with a few tweaks this can be 5 star.  :)

Delicious!  I used leftover chicken, fat-free sour cream, and also included half a red bell pepper, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  There was definitely too much sour cream, and the next time I make this (which I will!) I will probably reduce the amount of sour cream by half, at least on top, not necessarily in the potato mixture.

What a strange meal.  I was going to give this two stars because it was a bit bland then I realized I forgot the garlic in the sauce!  I was really disappointed in the sauce and that's probably why.  This recipe got a lot of great review, but I thought it was just plain strange.  I've never put chicken on top of potatoes in my life.    Worth a try at least once though.

Great comfort food. Needs more garlic (any form would be fine), spinach mixture, and salt and pepper to taste. The spinach sauteed onto the chicken was genious, and I plan to reuse at least that portion of the recipe over and over again!

MmmMMMMMMMmmmmmm!  I love sun-dried tomatoes and this recipe compliments them well.  I will admit the dish doesn't look appetizing, but it just melts in my mouth.  Definately making this again!

OK tasting dish, but a lot of busy work.  Not something I would make daily.  I made this without the green peppers (personal taste) and cut up chicken breasts into chunks because its what I had on hand.  I added a third potato and extra garlic.  I also added a little salt to potatoes and chicken.  Overall decent meal.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to prepare, gave me time to clean up in between each part.  The sundried tomato spinach pesto was great and the potatoes were amazing.  I really liked it!  Thanks:)

Fab recipe!  I used jarred pesto in lieu of spinach/parmesan and cut up b/s chicken breast into quarters.  I was a little confused about how all these "layers" were suppose to work together but just make sure to not over-mash the potatoes and it works out well. You want to have small potato chunks as a base.   My hubby was drooling from the aroma of the kitchen and thankfully, the taste lived up to it!

Absolutely wonderful flavors...I'll leave the potatos out next time and mix the onions and peppers in with some precooked brown rice.  I used naked (not breaded) tenders that I marinated in a small amount of white wine with a lemon pepper seasoning for about an hour prior.  I did not use a food processer and feel leaving the tomato, spinach and garlic more whole added depth to the dish.  I was told to put this in the keeper file and look forward to making it again.

This was definatly something different. I will make it again but I will cut the parmesian by about half. Other than that it was great.

This gets FIVE stars for taste! It was VERY tasty as is - but the prep for it was long and used a lot of dishes. I think in the future I will make it more like sheppard's pie and combine the onion, pepper, chicken and tomato mixture and put it underneath a layer of potatoes so that can be prepped in one large saucepan all at once. I think that way it will require less oil as I had to add more since the tomato mixture was just kind of burning and sticking to the pan. Also we will likely use less onion and more varieties of peppers. But taste was 5 stars, prep was the only thing that brought it down.

I changed the assembly of this dish by putting the cooked chicken/pesto mixture on top of the peppers and onions and spreading the potatoes on top.  I also added rosemary and pine nuts to the pesto and used olive oil instead of butter. The recipe doesn't call for salt and pepper, so I salted and peppered each layer lightly.  I would cook the chicken without adding the pesto until asssembling the dish in order to try to keep the brilliant green color.  My kids ate it without complaining or making the gag sound with each bite, so that is a positive and I found the dish to be very flavorful, but not very pretty. Hopefully the later addition of the pesto will help that.

I made this for the first time tonight. It was pretty good. Considering all the ingredients there really were not as many flavors as I expected - something was missing. I also had trouble blending the pesto ingredients in my chopper, not sure why! I'm going to tinker with it though as I think this dish has GREAT potential!! Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this was not worth the preparation, and I had trouble blending the spinach and other ingredients in my blender, which usually does an adequate job.

I made this last night and we were not impressed.   I won't make this again.           Like many others stated,  the prep was time consuming and many dishes to clean.   I used a blender, and it took forever!   I also subbed frozen spinach, that's what I had.          I also subbed some cooked chicken I had on hand.   I did not use quite all of the sour cream, and topped it with crispy onions.      The pesto added a nice flavor, but overall, this dish just didn't impress.

Seemed like more work than needed. I think it would be easier to cook the spinach mix first before blending too. But the flavors were very good. Also not sure why not to mix the onions in with potatoes, and would do more, maybe mushrooms too. Used frozen spinach and the sun dried tomatoes in oil, more garlic than mentioned (we love garlic). But everyone liked it and will definitely keep in mind again.

I used chopped cooked chicken and deleted the sundried tomatoes, green pepper and the  sour cream on top of chicken. Served the chicken separate from the potatoes.   Rave reviews, especially for the potatoes. If you reheat the leftovers, a little butter stirred into the potatoes is divine.  I will make this again!

I really liked this dish. I love sour cream :) My boyfriend says he would probably have used less (half, maybe) sour cream in the final step, but I liked it the way it was. Flavorful and kind of fun to make. Only thing that I would like to say is that salt and pepper are needed. I added them, but the recipe does not say to. If you are going to make this, don't leave out the s&p! I added it to pretty much every part of the meal. I also really liked the method of blending the spinach, garlic, butter, etc. to cook the chicken in. I left out the sun-dried tomatoes, though because they were out of them at Trader Joe's.  I am sure I will make this again!

I've made this recipe a few times now, and it's great.  I've adopoted two important short cuts (using leftover cooked chicken and leftover garlic mashed potatoes).  I may not layer/assemble the casserole specifically as stated in the recipe, but all the ingredients are present and it makes for some great comfort food.

This was just okay.  I won't be making it again... it just was lacking flavor.  It would be good with bacon bits in it, or just something else to give it more flavor.  I did use fat free sour cream but I don't think that made that much of a difference.  The spinach mixture was delicious but there was barely any of it in the casserole.

Even though I think this deserves 5 stars, my husband isn't as fond as I am about it.  My friend made this at her house months ago, and it was so delicious.  I have made it quite a few times since then, and i love it each time!  Great recipe!!!

This is FANTASTIC!  Several comments made about the time to make it, but it took me just a bit over the time mentioned in the recipe for me to complete this recipe. Wonderful.  I love it, I will definitely use this again.

Not too great- not as much flavor as I would expect from this ingredient list.  I also thought it was a bit on the greasy side
