Wonderful flavor and great presentation! My family liked them but was unsure of the "strange" taste left in the mouth. I believe next time I will substitute sour cream for the crm of mushrm soup and green onions for the chives. Otherwise this recipe is delish! Thanks Shelley

Great muffins Shelley!! I only changed one thing - I substituted melted butter for the oil. It gave them a rich buttery taste. - Excellent!!

These were great.  For breakfast, with pasta, soup or salad.  I doubled the bacon and cheese. I only used about 1/3 the garlic, maybe a little more.  And I used about 4 TBSP of chopped fresh green onions, instead of the chives.  A definate keeper. My family loved them.

Interesting combination of ingredients that works very well. Although next time I'm going to omit the cream of mushroom, but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe.

Our whole family loved this easy recipe. The combination of ingredients was wonderful. My teenage sons devoured them. I liked the idea of a quick breakfast item and highly reccommend these. Thanks Shelley!

These were so tasty that they were eaten any time of the day - from breakfast on.  They disappeared in no time.

Made these and two other muffin recipes to take  to the lake this weekend for a quick brunch on the boat.  Everyone liked them.  My son [16] and his friends loved them. I will be making them again. Thank you for the great recipe.

I loved these muffins!!!  But I think that next time I make them I will cut back on the salt and oil.  They were a bit greasy, and a little saltier than I like.  They are crusty on the outside,and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Yummy!

These muffins were moist and had a nice texture, but the flavor was somewhat bland despite all the zesty ingredients.  I don't think I'll bother with them again - though they were easy to make, they were time consuming, and the results weren't really worth the effort.

Mine came out more like a biscuit than a muffin. My neighbor just loved them and i gave her the recipe. My husband loved them too. The garlic was a little too strong.

Delicious. These will be great to make ahead and freeze throughout the school year. My modifications: I used 1C whole wheat and 1C white flour, 1 t. garlic powder, 1/4 C fresh chopped chives, 1.5C extra sharp cheddar, and 1/2C Greek yogurt (instead of mushroom soup).

It's like a full breakfast in a muffin! Great to take on the go, bake a big batch on a weekend, then zap them in the microwave for 30 seconds in the morning. Easy and delicious!

I made these for Easter brinch yesterday and they were a hit, especially with my uncle who is not a big quiche fan and wanted something 'without eggs in it'. I did, however substitiute cream of chiicken soup for the cream of mushroom, just a personal preference.

L really liked these, but for some reason, my first batch was prone to falling apart. I used applesauce instead of oil in the second batch & they came out much better. (Applesauce instead of oil helps to cut back on fat, but still bakes up just as well.) This is a great morning treat served with omelets for a house full of people!

I wanted to make bread with the bacon and cheese, so I made a few alterations. Instead of oil, I used 1/4 cup butter and crumbled it into the flour before adding the other ingredients, used 2/3 cups milk, omitted the mushroom soup and used 2 eggs. Baked it 50 minutes in a 180 C oven. It turned out great!! (look at picture)

First, here are the changes I made following other reviewers advice.  I used no oil.  Instead I added 1/4 cup each of milk and sour cream. I also substituted  sour cream for the mushroom soup,  so instead of 1/2 cup each COM soup and milk, I added a total of 3/4 cup each sour cream and milk.  I also cut the garlic powder to about 3/4 tsp.  I love garlic, but if I'm having this for breakfast, I didn't want to be overwhelmed by it.

Personally I liked these a lot.  They reminded me a lot of the Cheddar Bay Biscuits you get at Red Lobster but with bacon. My Husband agrees. 

My kids however...not so much.  For them I think it was more of a texture thing (the tops are a little crunchy from the baked cheese).  My children are young, 5, 3, 2.  Maybe older children would appreciate them more.

I loved these muffins! The kids thought they were okay and the husband said if it had a little less garlic flavor he thought he might enjoy them more. The texture was good and the moistness was there. They reheat great. I think next time I will lighten up on the garlic and use a less fine cheddar cheese.
We ate them for breakfast but I can see them served with creamy potato soup and side salad.

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted cream of potato!  Worked out great, almost like a Western Omelet Muffin.  Definitely will make again.

All it takes to turn a recipe into a lower- fat version is to substitute some of the oil for another wet ingredient.  In this case you could substitute some (1/8 - 1/4 cup) of the oil for the same amount of milk or soup. If you want a lower-fat muffin give it a try. :o)  - From the creator of this recipe, Shelley Albeluhn.

Took the advice of others and used butter instead of oil and I think that was the right move.  These smell wonderful and taste just as good.  They came out pretty dense and rich so they go a long way.  Will make again.

These muffins were pretty good. Maybe a little too garlicky, but overall, had good flavor. My husband really liked them so I know that he will look forward to eating them for a quick breakfast. The only thing I changed was that I used turkey bacon since that I all I ever buy anymore, so at least that made it a little healthier. I will probably make a bigger batch next time so that I can freeze them and we can use them for quick meals. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very good but next time I will add a lot more bacon and cheese and I will use fresh green onion in place of the chives.

I give these 4.5 stars.  They are delicious!  I served them for a small meeting in my house.  What a hit!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I used bacon bits (made of real bacon, not the plastic-y ones) instead of cooking bacon.  For one, it was what I had.  For two, it made it less of a mess to make.  I also substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil to make them a bit healthier.  I don't think either substitution changed the outcome of the recipe at all.  Delicious!!

These had a really good taste to them - I agree with the person who submitted it that she has made them into a perfect combination of flavors.  Maybe I did not cook them long enough, even though the toothpick was clean, they were a little too moist.  My daughter wanted nothing to do with them - probably not a good kid dish.

Amazing! I made it for my home group and everyone loved them and wanted more! After reading other reviews I also substituted sour cream for the cream of mushroom soup and put in less garlic and they were perfect!

Holy -ola.  These are delicious.  I used sour cream instead of the cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I left out the chives and Parmesan because I didn't have any.  Soooo moist and full of flavor, excellent!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

The muffins stick to the liners--greased pans would probably be better if you're having company over. Also, I substituted 1/3 cu. mozzarella cheese, 1/3 cu. extra sharp cheddar, and 1/3 cu. cheddar cheese for the 1 cu. sharp cheddar cheese.

Really delicious. I made them with fresh chives, and I also used more bacon as the stuff I had was quite thin, and microwaved down to nothing. I wish I had added a little more salt. Anyway, I will definitely make these again - I like the suggestion of having them with scrambled eggs. Thanks, Shelley!

Simple recipe.  The 1/2 cup of oil is quite a lot of oil though.  Going to try to reduce to 1/2 cup next time.

We used 2tsp fresh scallions instead of the chives.  That seemed to work fine.  I agree with previous reviewers and would reduce the garlic powder too.

Fill the cups full because these don't rise too much.

Amazing savory muffin, more of biscuit.  Perfect for brunch with eggs.  This is a keeper.  I used fresh snipped chives instead of dried.

Hot out of the oven, buttered and drizzled with honey - Yummy! (I left out the garlic & chives, and the cheese I used was old nippy cheddar). This seems like a versatile recipe. I recommed it!  Thanks, Shelley!

I JUST made them and they were absolutely great. I stuck to the ingredients given and me and my boys loved them. We spread a bit of butter on it...eh..sour cream YES. That's just us though.  I made half the batch which rendered 12 muffins and I'm saving the last batch for later. I highly recommend it. It was very simple to make.

These were great. Nice light texture I wasn't expecting. I used a little more bacon, condensed cream of chicken soup, fresh green onions and 1/4 cup butter instead of oil because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will leave the pieces of bacon a little bigger, they give a salty kick that makes these delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very tasty muffin. The consistency is a bit gummy not the most pleasant, I will make this type of muffin again, but I am going to try adding less oil as I think that is what was causing the 'gummy' problem.

so I used sour cream instead of the CoM soup, butter instead of the veg oil, and 8tsp fresh chives instead of the 4tsp dried. Baked about 23 minutes - smelled wonderful! They were a bit denser than I was expecting, but hubby likes biscuits better than muffins so no problem there. He thought they were okay, I thought they were slightly above average.  Overall, I wasn't impressed... took me probably 30 minutes of prep, and the end result just didn't do it for me.

Amazing recipe, the tastes are so delicious!  Only thing I would suggest is rolling the dough into balls and putting out on baking shee instead.

These are GREAT! Searching for recipes at midnight planning the menu for the week, I decided to make these (yes, at 1230 am) because my boyfriend loves bacon so much and we have a busy day tomorrow, no time to make an impressive breakfast. I dont have sugar on hand so scratched it all together. I also didnt have chives so I substituted with Thyme. Although Chives would have been better, these were still spectacular!!! Also, I greased the muffin pan with vege oil so that they fried the outside a bit. This will be a weekly bake, for sure! I do have to agree with whoever mentioned that the mushroom soup leaves an unusual after taste in your mouth...I'd suggest using real mushrooms!

These are delicious muffins, although I think biscuits would be a better description for them.  I've followed the recipe as is and it's delicious, although I recommend using mini muffin tins instead of full size.  More recently, I had to substitute a few ingredients and I think they came out even better!  I used a whole can of broccoli cheese soup in place of cream of mushroom and decreased the oil by at least half.  Not having chives on hand, I chopped some green onions instead.  Threw in about a quarter cup of shredded Swiss along with the cheddar, and baked in mini muffin tins for 12 minutes (no wrappers necessary).

Not something that I'd make all of the time since it took over an hour to make a double batch, but everyone really liked them.  Although I'd be willing to eat them for breakfast, I'm not sure that I'd call them a breakfast muffin.  Also, they remind me more of drop biscuits than muffins and didn't cook for nearly as long.  Mini-muffins took 12 minutes and full size muffins took 16 minutes.     After reading that some other cooks found the recipe a bit bland, I made these changes: 1.  I increased the amount of Parmesan, garlic, & chives by about about half again. 2.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk and added a bit more to make up for the extra thickness 3.  I used the bacon fat instead of the oil  I might make them next time w/o the bacon.  If I did, I think that they'd remind me of the Red Lobster biscuits.

These were great with potato soup...also for breakfast...and for snacking in between!  I also figured, if you're going to do it, go all the way, so I added more bacon, used melted butter in place of the oil and added more cheese.  Wow, these are awesome!

These were a huge hit at our house.  To lower the fat content I used Cabot 50% lower fat cheddar, egg beaters, skim milk and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  To increase the flavor I used 1/4 cup of snipped fresh chives.   I think the fresh chives really made this dish and if you have them available I would strongly recommend them.

These were very good, I didn't have chives so I substituted a teaspoon of onion powder and a teaspoon of dried dill for color. The flavor and texture were excellent.

Really good. I made a bunch of changes because I was trying to work with what I had and cater a bit to my husband who's extremely picky. I didn't use any meat or chives, cut out the salt entirely, and used half again the cheeses. I added a few chopped mushrooms and a diced jalapeno for a little kick. They turned out quite moist, but very tasty, and the picky eater loves them. Also, paper liners are necessary with this, especially if you increase the cheese.

I made several significant changes to this recipe for various reasons and it turned out great!  Here's what I did:
-substituted cooked and crumbled Morningstar Farms breakfast links and mock-sausage patties for the bacon (I'm vegetarian)
-used some fresh sliced mushrooms and sour cream instead of cream of mushroom soup (my hubby is allergic to the MSG in the soup)
-I didn't have any chives, so I left those out

Next time, I'll add chives, and perhaps some olives.  I might cut back on the cheddar to reduce the fat, but I'll have to figure out how to compensate for the reduction first.

I made these muffins and served them to my family with a fresh salad and a creamy potato soup...they were the perfect compliment to our meal, and were quickly devoured...while my son is 13 and likes different spices, small children may not like the chives, as most of them have an aversion to "green things"....I am a muffin addict, and this recipe is one of the best I have found in the dinner muffin category. They were easy to prepare, and with precooked bacon on the market, you can avoid the messy bacon step.  Thanks for sharing!

I give it 4 stars because after reading other reviews I made some changes.  Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, added ½ cup browned sausage, sauteed ? cup white onions and ¼ cup chopped green pepper (instead of chives), used sour cream instead of soup.  Did add a little more sour cream and milk.  Turned out wonderful!

I made a few  modifications and they were amazing! I chopped and sautéed about 1/2 a green pepper, one shallot and a clove of fresh garlic (substituted for the powdered garlic). To finish off the top of the muffin nicely, I cut strips of bacon in half, made each into a spiral, skewered with toothpicks, and I par cooked them separately in the oven over a mini muffin pan. I inserted one bacon rose in the center on top of the muffin batter and sprinkled a few shreds of cheddar cheese on top to make them look nice, then baked them as the instruction state.

I liked this recipe, first time used ham cut very small and fresh chive, used the other reviewers suggestions.  I had to take a savoury finger food to a shower so made them in mini muffin tins, cooking time was 14 min.  I have now made them again in the mini muffin tins and have frozen them. The second time the change I made for the mini tin was lower the cooking temperature to 375, about 18-20min, depending how big they were. I felt they were moister.

We loved it as the recipe was written, however I think next time I will add chopped onion and maybe more seasoning. I think those who complained it was too salty should have made sure they used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. There is salt in bacon, cheese, and mushroom soup. Really don't need to add salt at all. Consistence was great, taste was good, more like addicting rather than tasty. My husband thought they tasted great! They will be made again and again.

We loved it as the recipe was written, however I think next time I will add chopped onion and maybe more seasoning. I think those who complained it was too salty should have made sure they used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. There is salt in bacon, cheese, and mushroom soup. Really don't need to add salt at all. Consistence was great, taste was good, more like addicting rather than tasty. My husband thought they tasted great! They will be made again and again.

I liked it but the sugar over powered the savory taste. But, I ended up using turkey bacon which is no where close to the real thing. Real bacon may have helped tone down the sugaryness. Brown sugar instead of white maybe a better option for less sweetness. I shall try it!

How could people write that these are bland?  Surely they couldn't be.  But they are.  Somehow all the bacon and chive is lost in these.  I even put extra of both because I didn't have enough of either to bother saving.  Didn't hate these, but won't try again.

Made these this morning and they were pretty good.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Next time I might do half and half.  I also used half oil and half applesauce, to cut down on the fat content.

Mine are in the oven now, I messed with the recipe a bit: Instead of bacon I used a handful of chopped white onion, instead of condensed soup I used a bit more milk and chopped parsley instead of chives. I have made them with bacon before just wanted to try something different. We'll see how they come out!

YUMMMM!  I made 30 mini muffins to bring to my MOPS meeting tomorrow.  I baked for about 10-15 minutes.  My family and I just had to each have one, since they smelled so good while baking.  The outside was nice and crisp while the inside was moist and soft. It's a perfect breakfast food for me since I don't care for sweets!

These were a huge hit at our house.  To lower the fat content I used Cabot 50% lower fat cheddar, egg beaters, skim milk and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  To increase the flavor I used 1/4 cup of snipped fresh chives.   I think the fresh chives really made this dish and if you have them available I would strongly recommend them.

Family loved this.  Served them with cheddar broccoli soup.  It made 12 muffins.  The fiiling was very thick and I overfilled the muffing cups, but they came out perfect.

These dense muffins are full of flavor & are good to eat alone or with something else. I didn't have any type of cream soup so I used a 1/2 cup of Helluva Good dip along with 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of oil & Bacon Bits instead of regular bacon. All three substitutes worked well & my family devoured the muffins as soon as they came out of the oven. I will make these again, they are wonderful!

I've made these numerous times and they are always a hit. I use more bacon than the recipe calls for and I use cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom. Sometimes I use the bacon fat instead of the veggie oil but the texture is better with the oil.

I loved this recipe! I used bacon, chopped onions and peppers and I used sour cream as one of the other reviewers did. They turned out amazing! Moist and light, full of flavour. I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella as that is what I had on hand. These are breakfast in your hand, I will be making these again and again! Thanks!

This is excellent.  Instead of bacon, I used half a 12oz packaged sausage and only 1/3 cup of oil.  I also skipped the sour cream and increased the amount to about 3/4 cup.  I didn't have chives on hand, so I used 3 stalks of fresh green onion.  They are yummy.

These are always a huge hit when I make them.  I double the cheese, and use mini-muffin pans and they are always gone in minutes.  They are a great side to a meal or alone for a breakfast muffin.  Thanks for the recipe!

These had great flavor! I have to say though that these are very time consuming to make (longer than the 15 minutes stated) so I most likely won't add them to my regulars. I would reccomed warming any leftovers before you eat them to get the most flavor out of them!

Great tasting muffins!  Went well with a bowl of hearty soup.
