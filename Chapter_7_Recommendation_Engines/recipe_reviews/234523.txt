Instead of canned green beans I used Steamfresh frozen whole green beans. Though the grownups were lukewarm about these I definitely got two thumbs up from both kids--even the picky one. Recipe title is no lie. NO leftovers.

My 2 year old loved it. I used fresh green beans and boiled them with a tablespoon of salt 15 minutes before using.

These were good. Like Sarah Jo I used frozen whole green beans because I'm just not a fan of canned. These were a quick veggies side w/out a lot of bells and whistles (or added calories). THANKS for the recipe!

I had to find a way to cook some fresh green beans from the farmer's market that my picky toddler son might enjoy (or at least not hate) and that the family would enjoy too. This recipe came up and I had everything to make it so that's the tale of how this recipe made it to the dinner table last night. My son ate two pieces which I consider to be a huge success. Other members of the family had second helpings which is almost better because it shows my son that adults love their veggies! The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt (canned green beans probably don't need any added salt). Of course I also steamed the beans before adding to the sauce. Delish! I will definitely make this simple recipe again.

I use bacon grease rather than butter and a skillet rather than a saucepan and sort of fry the beans. My grandkids and I just love them this way. I have even been known to make a green bean sandwich from the occasional leftovers.
