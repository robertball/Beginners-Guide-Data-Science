Excellent ***** These are the best, I added extra almond extract and ground almonds. I did not chill the dough, I used a cookie scoop slightly flaten with a fork and sprinkled ground almonds on top. I baked them at 350 degrees for 11 min. they were perfect. This is going to be one of our family favorities. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  Delicious, rich flavor.  I don't think I'll shop around for almond cookie recipes anymore.  I didn't refrigerate, either, and rolled them in nuts and sugar, and baked them without flattening.  Turned out great!  Chewy and crispy - so, so good.  Thank you!

Excellent cookies! Kind of reminded me of snickerdoodles except for the almond flavor instead of the cinnamon. I just made a couple small changes like lowering the oven temperature to 350 and I was too impatient to wait  for the 4 hours so I rolled them into tsp size balls and flattened them with a fork.

I am a lactose intolerant (I used vanilla soy milk in place of milk) slacker (did not refridgerate the dough but followed other recommendations to just flatten the cookies, and I did not put egg white on top because my baby was screaming, and I threw slivered almonds on top in place of mixing in ground almonds due to what I had on hand) who does not have cream of tartar (I left it out).  My very-altered cookies turned out okay--My husband says "I think they're great!"  But I think they taste like slightly almondy sugar cookies, which is maybe how they're supposed to taste.

I did not refridgerate the dough either, and instead rolled it into 1 tsp. balls which I then rolled in a mixture of ground almonds and sugar.

I don't know if it's because my oven is new, but the cookies BURNT on the bottom. Maybe 375 is too high? Then again my oven might just be too hot (this was only the 3rd time I've used it since new!)

Overall, excellent taste! I would probably bake them at 350 next time though.

These were awesome! I read the reviews and added extra almond extract, also did not refrigerate and rolled dough balls in sugar and crushed almonds. They taste like a sugar cookie with a very nice subtle almond flavor. So glad I found this recipe :) I did not use the egg whites and I also baked at 350 for exactly 11 minutes and they were perfect!!

Good cookies. I agree that they do remind me of Snickerdoodles too. Crispy edges, softer center. I also didn't take the time to refrigerate the dough. I rolled spoonfulls into a snake shape and then flattened them on the tray. I got a little confused with the recipe directions though about when to mix in the egg yolks then the baking soda and milk. I had a million bowls with ingredients until I realized they were all supposed to go into the egg yolk bowl. The dough was very think and I had to mix in the almonds by hand kneading.

I made these last year for Christmas and loved them.  I'm back to get this recipe to make the again this year.  Be careful not to bake too long or they will turn brown and taste burnt.  Great to make ahead and bake a few at a time!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed based on the other reviews.  I hate the taste of baking soda and that's all I tasted.  Possibly more almond extract would improve the taste, but I won't try these again.

These are excellent cookies, both in flavor and in texture.  I did use butter instead of shortening - my default for cookies.  I also doubled the almond extract.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe faithfully - particularly in terms of instructions.  Next time I will adapt a bit by making the log more slender.   I prefer a smaller cookie than the 2 inch instruction produced.  I rolled the log in sliced almonds - hoping for an almond-studded edge.  They simply ended up on the bottom of the cookie by the time baking was done.  I plan on making these again  and next time will sprinkle them on the top after I sprinkle on the sugar - I used turbinado and it worked very well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Joy.  It is definitely a keeper!

I added more almond exctact as suggested but have nothing to compare it to bec this was my first time baking these. I also reduced temp to 350 as suggested. They didn't come out that crispy probably bec I lowered the temperature. I will try leaving it at  375 next time but watch it so it doesn't burn. You can also drizzle chocolate on top or you can place a chocolate kiss in the center. If you bake with the chocolate kiss, the chocolate becomes stale-like so best to place the kisses as soon as the cookies come out of the oven. It's ok without the chocolate too. I refrigerated overnight and the texture was the same as before it went it the fridge so no need to refrigerate. I didn't like how the dough texture was crumbly.  It was hard to roll into logs because the dough doesn't stick together nicely. Instead of adding the almonds to the mixture, maybe just roll the cookies in the ground almonds before baking.  I've bad better almond cookies than this.  My teenagers loved it.

I REALLY messed about with this recipe and they were still delicious! 

I substituted 3/4 C flour for almond meal flour , I didn't refrigerate either, just made small balls and gently squished them with a fork. I didn't glaze or add extra sugar.I dropped the oven temp to 350 after 8 mins as they smelled cooked but left them for 10 mins. Came out a beautiful golden color and crisped up nicely on cooling . 

next time I'm substituting the shortening for butter.

Yes, I'm an Almond lover- so I had to try these cookies. These are easy to make, with ingredients I always have on hand. If you can use natural almond extract the cookie will taste better- 1/2 teaspoon is enough. I also omitted the 'Cream of Tartar' as I don't like its taste. (Cream of Tartar makes cookies crispy), but mine came out perfectly without . Also I did not brush the cookie with egg white nor sprinkle it with sugar. For the rest I followed the recipe exactly - the end result was a super heavenly crispy almond cookie! Thanks Joy.

Delicate almond flavor.. nice and crisp. I rolled the log in  sliced almonds instead of ground.. the dough was really soft even after leaving in fridge overnight so it was tough to get  these round. I might try these with butter next time as I prefer the taste of it over shorteneing

Easy to make. I did refrigerate the dough and was able to slice  the cookies very thinly, making them very crispy.

I followed the suggestions of other reviews and doubled the extract AND I doubled the sliced almonds.  I did chill the dough and brushed the log with egg white and used the extra almonds I added to roll the log in before slicing.  I had to reshape the sliced cookies into rounds.  I brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled coarse sugar lightly before baking.  I've added a picture so you can see the result.  I watched them carefully and baked them at 350.  They have crisp edges and soft centers.  If you like almonds, THIS is a GREAT recipe and one I expect to make again and again!

Crumbly dough...I followed the directions to refrigerate and slice and it was awful. Even tried freezing then slicing and dough still crumbled. Not great tasting in my opinion...will stick to almond crescents.
