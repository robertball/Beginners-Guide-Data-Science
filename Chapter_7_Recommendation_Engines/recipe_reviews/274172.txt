Recipe creator here!  You can find the xanthan gum at any health food store, and most major retailers carry it now in the health food section. Bob's Red Mill brand is quite popular, and I've even found it at Walmart in single serve packets under the Hodgson Mill brand (red packaging). For the best deal, I usually order on Amazon. A little goes a long way, and a bag will last you forever!  If you can't find it, you can omit it from my recipe, however using it produces a much soother texture, less of an "oily" feeling on the roof of the mouth from the heavy cream, and the prevention of ice crystals in the finished product - so keep this in mind if you decide to omit it!

I made this for my husband who is on a Keto diet.  My children and spouse enjoyed it.  I thought it could be a bit sweeter and the texture was more like soft serve ice cream.
