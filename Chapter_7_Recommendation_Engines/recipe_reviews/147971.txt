Last summer we had some hot beer cheese dip served with soft pretzel bites at a pub in Waterbury, VT. It was delicious and we've all been craving it. This recipe tastes just like the one we ordered at that pub - my family loved it! Since it was taking a while for the mix of 3 cheeses to melt on the stove, I put them in the microwave (before adding the wheat beer) for a minute or so, stirred, and then poured them back in the pan on the stove to add the beer.  That really speeded things up.  I had one box of 6 soft SuperPretzels that I heated in the microwave without the salt. Then I cut each pretzel into 6 or so pieces with a pizza cutter. Ideally, we could have used a second box (12 pretzels total)as 6 were not enough. We ended up eating the rest of the dip with Wheat Thins and carrots - it was so good we didn't want any to go to waste!

Beer and Cheese....can you go wrong??? Wonderful, this needs to be kept in a heating dish, I used a small crock pot to keep it fluid, otherwise it gets rather hard, pretty fast. This recipe was delicious, I used a hearty beer and the flavor really came through. If you don't like a strong beer flavor I would choose a light beer or an ice brew. YUMMMM

The flavor of this was very good and it's very, very hearty and filling. If I make this again, I will thin it just a little bit by adding more beer. It's very thick and as it cools it gets thicker. We didn't like it much with bread because it's so creamy. It was much better with crackers and pretzels (anything with a crunch).

Perfect, wouldn't change a thing.  It's like anything, you have to use good ingredients to get a good finished product;  make sure the beer you use is one you would drink.  We made a party of supper last night and served this with a big salad, and to dip; kielbasa slices, large,homemade croutons, soft pretzels, and fries.  I think I'm cooking up some macaroni and thowing it in the oven with the remaining dip for a delicious mac and cheese tonight.

This recipe was a big hit at the football party. Many requests for the recipe. We used Newcastle Ale beer and it turned out great. Many requests for the recipe!

This was amazing! Everyone ate it up and raved! Some things we added were: add real garlic, and sea salt, and 4 drops of liquid smoke.  Yum!

I served this with nachos at a party, and it was a huge hit!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (it certainly didn't need more salt), and added some jalapeno peppers.  Next time I'll thin it out a bit, possibly with more beer.

Very good! I opted to add garlic, rather than garlic salt and carmelized onions to add a bit more flavor. Different beers also change the flavor of the dip as well, if you are looking for ways to amend the recipes for your personal tastes. I did without the pumpernickel and just dumped it in a bowl. I used it for chip dip. It is a bit thick, but you can just add more beer to thin it out to your preference. Good, easy and tasty. Just great football food.

This was not very good at all.  I can't quite put my finger on why though.  I'll stick with the cold beer cheese dip recipe.

This was fantastic. I used Bell's Amber Ale; it gave a mild beer flavor which worked for the guests who weren't into beer. I also served in a crock-pot so ended up using a full bottle instead of the cup so it wouldn't get too thick. Substituted garlic salt for 4 cloves of roasted garlic. Served with pumpernickel points, garlic bagel chips, and french bread crostini. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was such a hit at our last Husker party that my family insisted on a mass emailing of the recipe.  It is that good.  It does thicken up but as a previous review stated you can just thin it out with more beer.  Hey, this recipe could be adapted with crunchy bacon bits, mushrooms...I even thought about adding walnuts.  Very good!

Works best if you do not use low fat cream cheese, Mozzeralla cheese and Cheddar cheese because you will get a grainy texture. You need the fats to have a creamy texture. Cooking it at a high temperature and for a long period of time can also add to the poor texture.

I made this for Thanksgiving! This was fun to make, but I thought it was too salty as well! I say cut it back and add real garlic! My husband and I decided this would be great for the next football game party! Beer drinkers like salty foods! Ha!

I'm not a beer fan, but my friends were raving about a cheese dip made with beer, so I decided to try it, and, well, you won me over. I loved it! It really went well with cauliflower and broccoli! Next time I'll try it with just garlic powder (there's enough salt in the cheese). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great dip - had to heat it thoroughly, and used a whole bottle of beer - it helped keep it from getting hard later on.  Added a few things - chopped scallions, used real garlic (grated), and a little spicy mustard. Came out great!

This was delicious, but a little too salty for my tastes. The cheeses I used probably had enough salt. Next time I will use garlic powder (or real garlic) and taste before adding any salt. We ate every bit anyway. Definately a party hit!

i completely butchered this recipe in all honesty, but though perhaps my review would help others in the same boat as me.  i chose to use the slow cooker so i wouldn't have to be prepping the dip while people were already at my house.  as i was putting everything in the crock pot, i had a sudden panic attack that it wouldn't reach the temperature for the alcohol to cook off, and kids would be eating it....so i chose not to put the beer in.  i decided to add a brick of velveeta because after putting in the other cheeses, there wasn't very much in the crock pot.  all said and done, it was a good dip.  it got hard and difficult to dip very quickly.  while i like the bread bowl concept, i think i would have been better keeping it in the crock pot and serving from there so it didn't congeal so quickly.  however i appreciate this recipe for being a yummy cheese dip that isn't to spicy for the kids!  thanks!

We all loved this!  I added a lot more beer than the recipe calls for (I think it was about a bottle and a half that I used) to get the consistency that I wanted.  I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for my husband and a few of his friends that came over for a football game.  I served it with some soft pretzel bites, bacon wrapped smokies, and a few other finger foods.  They loved it!  One of the friends had me write down the recipe for him before he left.  I personally was not a fan of it, and it did harden, even after adding extra beer.  But if the guys liked it, that's all that matters!

Really good!  Very rich and thick.  I would suggest leaving it on the stove over very low heat or in a small crock pot.  It did seem to thicken all of the sudden.  Really good with carrots, and melba toast.  Added fresh chopped garlic and left out the salt.

I used garlic powder instead of salt, as the cheese already adds plenty of salt. Very good recipe, but a bit heavy so be sure to have plenty of people and offer a lighter appetizer as well. Thanks for submitting this.

Ok, i love salty things but this was way overboard.  Next time i will use garlic powder instead of salt.  Also added extra beer to thin it out some and that helped a bit with curbing saltiness.

I doubled the recipe, to take to a team event at work. It was so incredibly easy, and cooked up just as described. Everyone loved it. 

Instead of a bread bowl, I served with soft pretzels!

This was really good. I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party and put the dip in a mini crock pot. Did not use the bread bowl and used Guinness for the beer.  I really liked dipping with potato chips :)

The taste was great, although the cheese set up too quickly after taking it out of the sauce pan. I'm not sure that has anything to do with the recipe, though. I might be more of a fan to use this as a fondue dip, where it would stay on the heat constantly. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious! I used monterrey jack cheese instead of the mozzarella, and it added a nice kick! Also, the cream stout I used added some acidity. Great with soft pretzels!

I followed the recipe exact and it has a good flavor but a slightly gritty consistancy. Idk if that happened because I couldn't quite melt the cream cheese completely or because that is just how cheddar cheese melts down. It wasn't so gritty that I couldn't eat it but not as smooth as I prefer.

I made this dip for soft pretzels and it was very tasty! I used a light beer, and thought the flavor was mild and just right! This is a keeper!

Yum!  Tastes great, no flavor is too strong.  I omitted the garlic salt completely, since some of my eaters aren't fans and added an extra 1/3 cup of beer to make the dip a little thinner.  We dipped Mall Pretzels (recipe from this site) in the sauce.  Great combo

DEEEE-LICIOUS! I added a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot (because my boyfriend loves Frank's on everything), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Used a mild wheat beer.  Instead of serving in a breadbowl, I served as a dip with soft pretzels.  A total crowd-pleaser - I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this for super bowl Sunday. I used regular Budweiser  beer (I don't Drink) and also made beer bread, so I pur hased a tall can, which worked perfectly for the amount I needed. 
I also didn't use the bread bowl, Since I made the beer bread and Buffalo Chicken Dip, So I also had Tortilla chips.
Any who, It was a HUGE hit and absolutely delicious! 
Highly recommend, except next time, I think I will try a dark ale to see how that works out. 
But thank you for the recipe!

This was a very easy recipe. Worked great with hard pretzels as well as soft pretzel bites I found at our local retail warehouse. The best part was the reheating of the leftovers the next day- perfect and still tasty!

This is excellent. I made it almost exactly as directed. The only changes were I added a full bottle of beer and a tsp of garlic powder instead of garlic salt, following the suggestions of lots of other reviewers. I served it with large soft pretzel bites, roasted broccoli and sautéed slices of Polish kielbasa, to make it a full meal instead of just an appetizer. It was kind of like a fondue dinner.  It was a hit!

I think this recipe is perfect for people who like blander foods. However, my family and I prefer spicier flavors, and so I made a few changes as I prepared it. For starters, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and we didn’t miss the salt at all. I then added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of mustard powder and about 1 teaspoon of cayenne. My kiddos and hubby really enjoyed it.

Easy to make. I added 1 TSP Paprika, 1 TSP minced garlic, and a few squirts of mustard while it was cooking up and that gave it a great flavor!

I made this per the directions and found the dip to be too congealed to itself. It was difficult to actually dip into and have some come off on your pretzel. You also have to keep it super hot.

This was pretty good, definitely didn't need the salt. I added some hot sauce, nutmeg, and pepper, along with a squirt of mustard (just to give it a little more depth).  I am keeping it warm in the instant pot, and using it as a dip for soft pretzels.

After reading the rest of the reviews, I thought I would avoid having the dip too thick.  Since shredded cheese is usually coated in a starch to prevent sticking, I bought brick cheese & grated it myself instead.  It worked a little too well, and could have been thicker.  Also, the cream cheese didn't blend as well with the other melted cheeses.  So next time, I think I will use shredded sharp cheddar and a brick of the cheddar/mozzarella blend.  I didn't use pumpernickel bread, but I did follow the recipe the rest of the way.  I used a very thick and strong Irish dark beer, so I might cut back on it a little.  It was a little strong, but good in the dip.

Made with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  For the cheddar I used sharp to give more flavor.  Still not very tasty.  It was just ok.  In addition to the lack of flavor, it just was melted cheese that hardened too quickly.  I wanted something that was more of a dipping sauce and this was too thick for that.

Flavor was good but yes,texture was off. Maybe the ingredients were not top quality or I over heated it. I added a little cream to prevent it from hardening but seemed like the beer curdled it or something. I am thinking next time I may simmer the beer first to cooknoff the alcohol, then add a touch of cream, then follow the recipe as it goes- melting the cream cheese and adding the shredded, etc...

Good flavor but the consistency was almost unpalatable.  Will try again, but I'll use milk and flour to get the creamy texture this should have.

This was great. We’ll definitely make it again. After reading other reviews, I decided to nix the garlic salt and instead used a tsp of Penzey’s Roasted Garlic powder. It was perfect! For the beer, we used New Belgium Daybreaker “an easygoing beer”. The flavor of the roasted garlic and beer stood out in a good way, and it was super-cheesy and flavorful but not salty. I wish I could give it 4.5 Stars because the only flaw was the added salt in the ingredients.

Used 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup Mexican blend...other than that, just the same.  For beer I used Killian's Irish red.  Did microwave the cheese first to aid in melting.

This is fantastic! I  sautee onions and garlic prior to adding the cheeses. I  have found that grating or cubing the cheeses results in a much creamier texture. Love trying different cheeses...smoked gouda, gruyere or often something that I have never even heard of from Trader Joe's in addition to the cream cheese. Picking the beer that you enjoy is key! We prefer an IPA or pale ale. My guy could eat this with a spoon!

It tasted delicious! I used Guiness for the beer, which turned the color a little off putting, so I added some yellow food coloring and that lightened it back up. It did get grainy when I let it sit out for a while though...but I would make it again, for sure. Also, based on other reviews, I added more beer to thin it out and I used garlic powder instead of salt.

Not a lot of flavor, and way too thick.

Yum!  Tasted just like what you'd get in a pub.  Didn't change a thing and will make it again.

It was good but I could not taste the beer in it. And it was too thick. All and all I was really disappointed in this recipe. I'll use a different recipe next time.

I think I was looking for a thinner dip. Maybe more like a cheese sauce. This dip is heavy, and is quite fluffy and stringy. We used it for soft pretzel dipping, and it didn't really adhere to pretzels due to its thickness and fluff. You had to push the cheese against the dip bowl with the pretzel to get it to scoop up and out of the bowl. The flavor was good though. Just not what I was hoping for.

I needed something to eat with Snyder sourdough pretzels. This dip was awesome. I used 4 state shredded cheddar mix and mozzarella along with the rest of the recipe. I didn't use a bread bowl. It's easily adaptable to anyone palate. I'm disabled with severe pain and can't stand very long but I made this. Super easy.

I made this dip for a Super Bowl party, and it was a hit. That is, after I doctored it because I (obviously) used too stout a beer. It was bitter. I chopped a small yellow onion, caramelized it in a little bit of butter, and added it to the dip. Perfection.

I made this for a large pasty that I hosted. I used crushed garlic instead of garlic salt and used a mixture of cheddar, mozz and pepper jack cheeses. Someone asked me for a spoon to eat it with!

Delicious, but must be kept warm.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but ended up adding a little salt anyway.  Be sure to use good quality cheese and beer.

This was great!  I used plain garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Perfect!  Served with pretzels from the freezer!  Came together perfectly with no issues in about 15 minutes.  Cooked the cream cheese on low and keep it on low-medium, stirring the whole time.

I have made this recipe several times. Even my mother in law likes it :). I usually stir it in a sauce pan then switch it to my small croc pot to keep it warm. Also I really don't like rye bread so I buy the soft pretzels from the frozen section heat them up in the microwave, and break them up into smaller pieces. I like this so much better.

I can't decide if I liked this or not.  Both my boyfriend and I were sort of "meh" about it.  Was missing something....but I'm not sure what.  Just seemed sort of bland.  Definitely would use garlic powder next time (as others have suggested) as it was salty enough with all of the cheese.  Might try again but play around with seasoning.

I just made the dip part of this recipe.  I used a wheat beer and served it with sections of soft pretzels I bought in the freezer section.  I also did it in the nuke and then put it in a small crock to keep it warm during the party.  Great and easy recipe!

I made this for a small family get together and the men loved it.  My boyfriends brother called the next day for the recipe he wanted to make it for the football game!  I served it with bread, chips, crackers, and carrots.  Every last drop was gone!
