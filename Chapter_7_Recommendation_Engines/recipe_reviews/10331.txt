I've used this recipe for years and everybody wants the recipe for it. I never give the recipe out because I've never seen a cookie recipe that calls for pudding before so I sort of consider it the secret ingredient of my signature cookie recipe. I always use Butter Flavor Crisco and a whole bag of chips. This recipe is easy to vary into peanut butter by using 1/2 c crisco and 1 c pb. You can make it into oatmeal cookies by using only 1 and 1/4 c of flour and 3 c of old fashioned oats. Or spice it up and use chocolate pudding and vanilla chips or peanut butter chips. Just have fun with this recipe. There are soooo many possibilities!!!

These were so delicious.  Made mine a little more moist by totally melting butter, adding 2+ tablespoons milk, and left out about 1 Tbsp pudding mix;  also added chopped walnuts and about 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla extract;  best if dropped, not flattened (tried both); when dropped, yields cookie with a slight crunch as you bite into it, but then the middle just melts in your mouth;  yes, the center is somewhat cake-like (per vanilla pudding mix), but that's what makes this cookie so good/different--- it's a thick, but moist cookie (not flat and crunchy or flat and gooey or thick and dry)

Well, these cookies I have to say were the best chocolate chip cookies Ive ever had/made. I took them to my church's prayer meeting, and they all loved them. I did take the advice of the viewers and added 1/4 tsp of salt, and I used NESTLE semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of chips. Man they were AWESOME.  Definitely cook them for 10 mins, and they are so soft!!!Update: Ive made these quite a few times, and I tried it with just one stick of butter, and, they are still just as good, and deliciously soft without all the fat!

Pudding really is the miracle worker here. I made one minor adjustment... used CHEESECAKE flavored pudding instead of vanilla. Result? Cookies that people would throw punches over. Mine did not spread at all; very puffy. They look lovely! :)

This was so easy. And they turned out so well. I used half butter, half margerine
to prevent spreading and I refrigerated
the dough to firm it up just a couple hours. Great cookie! EDITED MANY MONTHS LATER: I've been making these lately with instant cheesecake pudding and M&M's of any variety. (My husband likes the peanut butter, I like the dark chocolate.) With the cheesecake pudding, these are better than sex. Much better than Mrs. Fields or Tollhouse, for sure.

Mmmmmmmmmm.......this is one SUPERB cookie!  I didn't have vanilla pudding, so I subbed with toasted coconut flavor instead.  Threw in 1/4 c. sweetened, flaked coconut & followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Even my finicky boss was impressed.  Only regret was how fast they disappeared (I have 2 teenage boys in the house). Changing the pudding or chip flavors enables limitless varities.........THANKS!!!

These cookies were nice and soft and cakey, and they stayed that way for over a week!  I consider that to be a pretty good trade off for the slight aftertaste that the instant pudding gave them.  If you are making cookies for the purpose of eating raw cookie dough, (ahem) I would skip this recipe.  It didn't taste good raw.

No question about it! These are to die for!  Wonderfully moist even days later (if I remember to hide a few from my cookie loving husband)!  Add extra choc chips and don't be afraid to substitute different kinds of pudding/chips.

I thought these cookies turned out pretty well. I used butterscotch pudding and added a little bit of salt. They are very moist I thought they had a nice butter flavor. I would probably make these cookies again.

Very good!  I just made these- in fact, I have some baking right now!  Yummy!  DD, BF and I all thought they were great.  I used choclate pudding mix as that is what I had.  Also, I did not measure the chocloate chips out- I just put the whole dang bag in.  Very yummy!

Perfect!  I made these two days ago...we ate them all, they are ALL gone! They spread perfectly, and stayed soft! They looked JUST liked the picture.  Those who are saying they did not spread and were too cakey... you must have not followed the recipe exactly, as I had no problems.  My only 'complaint (and it isn't really) is the 2 cups of chocolate chips seemed almost like a bit too much... there were so many chips some of them didn't mix into the batter and stayed in the bottom of the bowl.

These were a hit in my house!  The only change I made was I used cheesecake instant pudding instead of vanilla (it's just what I had in the house.)  Fabulous!

I rate/review this recipe with full disclosure that I made several changes based on reading ALL of the 400-and-some previous comments and one big mistake on my own.  Still, they turned out YUMMY!  First of all, to enhance the lightness and tenderness of the cookies, I reduced the flour to 2 cups, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder along with the baking soda.  To reduce the reported excess of sweetness, I used just 1/2 cup brown sugar plus 1/2 cup powdered sugar (also to make them lighter), and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt along with using salted butter.  I also doubled the vanilla, but reduced the (bittersweet) chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 cup of broken pecan pieces.  My big boo-boo was using a box of cook-and-serve pudding instead of instant.  WHOOPS!  It didn't seem to do the cookies any harm, though.  Lastly, I pressed the cookies down a little before baking, and they flattened out like regular chocolate chip cookies (wish I hadn't done that in retrospect), and I baked them at 350 for 12-13 minutes until light golden brown around the edges.  I got 27 cookies using a regular cookie scoop, and I baked them on Silpat-lined half sheet pans.  Very good and easy recipe...will certainly make again!

I'm pretty picky when it comes to chocolate chip cookies and this one is awesome! It was a hit this Sunday with the whole family. I used the side note removing the 1 tbsp of pudding and adding the 2 tbsp of milk. Added some walnuts too. Perfect!

I've been making these for 3 years. I tried every other cookie recipe on this site and always come back to these, these are just the best cookies. EVER. Today, I realized as I was about to make them that I didn't have any butter and tried using coconut oil in place of butter. This put these cookies OVER THE TOP into the beyond outstanding category. Hands down, the best cookies I've ever had in my life, and I will never make them with butter again. Coconut oil (unrefined) is the best oil on the planet for you, and this just made them taste out of this world. WOW!

After reading the reviews I decided to use cheesecake pudding mix and see what happened. For me they weren't as sweet as I like. My husband said it was like sweet bread with chocolate chips in it. But I was determined to make this recipe work so I increased the white sugar to 1/2 cup and brown sugar to 1 cup and used milk chocolate chips and decided to use white chocolate pudding. They were fantastic!! Just as moist if not more! (Cooking them for 10mins). I did notice that the 2nd time they spread out a little bit where as they only puffed up and didn’t spread the 1st time, but I do live on the gulf coast of TX where the temp yo-yos every few days. This dough also keeps really well in the fridge over night and makes it easier to form. I will definitely use in my gift baskets!

I have made this recipe for years.  My mom cut it out of a Southern Living magazine.  I use shortening instead of butter - that keeps it from getting crispy on the edges.  I use a medium size scoop and bake for 8-9 minutes.  They turn out perfect every time.  I have used White Chocolate pudding as well as Cheesecake, french vanilla, butterscotch and chocolate.  All were great but liked the cheesecake the best.

UPDATE: I have been making these since I first found this recipe and I just made some more. I have to increase my rating to 5 stars, because not only are they easy, they really are SUPREME cookies. I use white choc. chips and reduce heat to 350. Very good cookie recipe.  These stay soft for days after baked.  I cooked them for 9 minutes and would recommend not any longer than this.  These are dense and delicious!  Recommend them highly if you are looking for a soft cookie.

These are amazing! I made a few changes and they turned out perfectly!
I added an extra 1/4 of flour to make them chewy rather then crispy. I changed the chocolate chip amount to 1 1/2 cups, and also added 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans. Delish!

These are fantastic!! I have been making this same recipe for about a year now and everyone loves them!! Anyone whom complains that these are dry, hard or don't stay soft for days is doing something wrong! These are perfect!!! Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle! I bake mine for 9 minutes then leave on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes to finish cooking before moving them to a cooling rack. Always perfect every time!! Never flat, never dry!! I do add extra vanilla, about 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons, other than that I don't change a thing! I want to try these with other pudding flavors, but we love them the way they are so much that I have not tried that yet! YUMMY!!!!!

This recipe is like WHOA good.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.  I've made it the original way and I've used it as a base to make various other chocolate chip cookies.  They are ALWAYS good.  ALWAYS.

I give this cookie 4 1/2 stars. Very good. Soft & chewy not crispy & crumbly.
Also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.

These turned out just great for me!  My husband said they were the best chocolate chip cookies he's ever eaten.  In half the batch, I added finely chopped walnuts and some leftover toffee chips for "to die for" cookies.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed  baking these cookies.  They held their shape well, had a nice texture and delicious taste.  Works well with chocolate pudding, too.  A keeper!

This recipe is exactly like the "Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies"

Anyways. Whenever I make these cookies... they have a bitter aftertaste, which kind of ruins the taste. But other than that, it usually tastes good.

I didn't have any vanilla pudding, but I really wanted to try these, so I used cheesecake pudding. Turned out really good. My dough was a bit thick, so they didn't need to bake for more then 8 min or so. I will try again with vanilla pudding and see how they turn out. YUMM!

Very good cookies overall. I tried them as one reviewer suggested with half the butter. Also, instead of rolling them into balls I just scooped and dropped them on the cookie sheet and put them into the oven. I found that the cookies were a bit dry in texture and visually rough looking when I took them out of the oven. So I did another batch with the full cup of butter and I rolled and slightly flattened the dough when I put them on the cookie sheet. MUCH BETTER. I like my cookies to look nice and even and smooth on top. I also added some Heath Bar bits to the mix. Fabulous!! This is definitely a more cake like cookie than I usually make, but I really enjoyed the flavor and texture over all!

I made these today as a Thank You gift for a friend - WOW they are terrific - a "Keeper" if there ever was one....  I read the reviews first and some complained about them being flat - so after mixing the dough I put the bowl in the fridge for about 2 hours then scooped them out with my Pampered Chef meatballer/cookie scoop and baked them on a Parchment Paper lined cookie sheet for 12 minutes.  They turned out perfect....  Nice and moist just the way I like cookies...  Thanks for sharring....

This is my new favorite cookie recipe. The cookies are very fluffy and soft. If you like cookies that are real chewy and slightly hard than you would NOT like this recipe. I have made this recipe several times and it has always turned out great!

These cookies were not the best I have ever had but they were pretty good! They were easy to make and they were a big hit with my 4 year old. They are soft, almost cake like, excellent right out of the oven...mmm...mmm..mmm!

These were fantastic! Only change I made was I melt my butter before adding the sugar to make a softer cookie, and let the dough chill for about 10 minutes. Made this side by side with traditional choc.chip cookies and this won with my family hands down! Wonder if chocolate pudding would work?

These cookies were wonderful! I followed the recipe exact except I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar cause I accidently ran out of brown sugar.  They still tasted great, I don't think it made much of a difference. This will be my go to recipe!!! YUM!

I  actually found this EXACT recipe in my own mothers recipe box! It was a recipe that was given to her by her EX stepmother. The recipe its self was amazing . The only thing I changed is, because it looked a little to thin for a cookie batter at first.so I had to add 1/2 cup flour to thicken it up. The taste was great, I have never eaten a cookie that  good, and cake-like.

Great recipe. I made these with cake flour and natural cane sugar because I didn't have the all purpose flour and brown sugar. I know they will be outstanding when I follow the recipe exactly. I'll be making them again as soon as I pick up the missing ingredients.

Chocolate chip cookies used to be the bane of my existence. They were always flat and unappealing. This recipe not only makes them taste good, but look great as well! And they freeze good and keep fresh in a resealable container!

I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe. I never would have thought to use instant pudding! I'm only now, at 19 really taking the time to learn how to cook, and it would have never occured to me. They have such a good flavor, and even after sitting out, they stayed gooey and never got hard. I think the word "perfect" has been thrown around. I will definitely be making these again and again :]

I baked these tonight, I was so excited to find a recipe similiar to the one that was on the back of the Baker's Chocolate  Chips(no longer available?)I was disappointed with the lack of flavor.  Texture and all was perfect.  I will add more vanilla to the recipe next time.

These were very soft cookies but the flavor was just lacking something.  Not a bad recipe but I will try others before I make this again.

My family has never met a cookie they didn't like until this one. I followed the directions to a tee and mine were not soft at all and they were not sweet either. Maybe too much flour? One thing I did like was that they stayed thick and did not flatten out. I did have to add a little milk because the batter was too thick. I am so disappointed they did not turn out. :-(

Thank you for this great recipe! Next time I want some c. chip cookies, I'll reach for this. I followed the advice of some reviewers, putting in only 1 stick of butter (for 24 servings) and baking for only 10 min. Just 1 stick of butter was not enough and I added the other stick. Baking for 10 min. was fine because I like my cookies a little gooey. Thanks again!

i'm not too fond of this recipe, only because i like my cookies a little more on the crunchier side.  this is soft and chewy type cookies, i would definetly add more chocolate chips...i dont know, but somethings missing...they spread out good though.  I'm sure you will love this recipe if you like soft cookies.

These are very soft cookies; I have to be honest, I didn't love this recipe. But, I made these cookies for some very, VERY picky friends who absolutely raved about them! RAVED...like, ate the entire batch in less than 24 hours. So I guess if you prefer a super soft cookie then this is your recipe!

These cookies turned out awesome. I added 1/2 pkg of cream cheese and used 1/2 reg. choc. chips and 1/2 white choc. chips. I also added some walnuts, not many, but enough for some  extra added crunch.
 They turned out so cake like, and moist... I just took the first batch out and tired one and was so excited I had to write before they were all done!
I will make these again for sure :)

I wasn't really impressed. The consistency is fine. The taste is a little funky. It only tastes good because of the chocolate chips. I even tried using the cheesecake pudding mix and I thought it just came out OK. Nestle still has a special place in my stomach,

These are the best cookies I've ever made! Make sure you press each cookie down flat a little after dropping it onto the baking sheet because these cookies really hold their shape. Other than replacing the vanilla pudding package with cheesecake pudding, I followed the recipe and baked exactly 10 minutes, and they were perfect!
***FYI- These cookies are not good for dunking in milk. It's like dunking a piece of cake, which does not work.
***UPDATE- I make these cookies so many times now that I've actually just posted this recipe on my refrigerator door so it's always handy! I've used vanilla, cheesecake, chocolate, and butterscotch puddings to try different flavors. All were hits! My dad liked the butterscotch, my husband likes cheesecake, and I like the chocolate!! They are just sooo good!

I just wanted to say that when I make any kind of cookie they turn out ok, but always have had trouble with Chocolate Chip Cookies. They sometimes were to hard, flat or just  didn't want to come off the pan.  Until now!  This was the frist time ever that my family were able to enjoy a chocolate chip cookie!  They were awesome!  I will be using this recipe again and again!!!!  Thank you

Ok so i make these cookies at work all the time...this is a fave recipe for my elders. I follow the recipe to a t usually and they come out great. The only time i deviate from the recipe is when i am adding different kinds of pudding mix. I have added banana and butterscotch pudding and when i add chocolate pudding i make them a cookie bar. Everyone loves to love these cookies Thanks Pam they are great.

Made 1 batch exact per recipe using choc. chips and then using chocolate chunks...they were just o.k. they had a grainy sand like texture that I did not care for, not much flavor other than the sugars in the recipe.  I used W.Sonoma vanilla and fresh dry ingredients....will try some of the others here. next time...

These are two thumbs up!  I like how they were slightly thick and not so doughy.   They were very moist as well!  We opted for chocolate instant pudding instead and they were awesome, this is definately a keeper!

Let me put it this way - I just came back from a week vacation, and after take-out dinner (because we are all so tired) I pulled out the ingredients to make these!  If you still make them when you're dead tired, you know they are good!  Made them a while back as the recipe calls and they were delicious.  We called them "Little Puffy Pillows of Deliciousness".  They are puffy and cakey and soft and chewy (without the dreaded undercooked texture) and stayed that way for days.  Today we didn't have all the proper ingredients.  Made them with only one stick of butter, added 1 tsp of salt and subbed 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat - still amazing!  Also, the trick to making them puffy, I use a one TBSP scoop to make them into little domes and use parchment paper.  They are a nice size, don't spread much and have a nice puffy shape which really show off their cakey texture. Can't wait to experiment with other flavors of pudding and mix-ins!

This recipe was great! I really liked the way the cookies turned out the first time I tried it! The most recent time I worked off this recipe, I sub'd chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, and used wheat flour for 2 cups of the 2 1/4 ( the 1/4 I used all-purpose) ... either way, the cookies turn out fluffy and and soft :)

These were really good! I substituted butterscotch pudding for the vanilla and it was a very subtle flavor- worked nicely :) My only complaint is that while the cookies are very soft, they became VERY crumbly. Thanks for a quick recipe!

I have made these cookies a few times and they always turn out great.  I do add about 1/3 a cup of milk to thin out the batter, as I like my cookies to spread out a bit.

One word: Perfect!

I used whole wheat flour instead of white and it was still an all around great recipe.

I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt, pistachio pudding mix and 1/2 cup chopped toasted (unsalted) pistachios with very good results.  I will use almond extract instead of vanilla next time.

I always make this recipe as written and turns out great. I have made this recipe quite a few times now and is my favorite. The great thing about this recipe is that you can alter it and the cookies still come out great. I have made these cookies using cream cheese pudding mix too with chocolate chips. And I also recently tried doing chocolate pudding mix with reese's pieces instead of chocolate chips. Both variations turned out very yummy!

These came out really well.  I had a lot of people comment on how rich they were, and there wasn't even one left over.  The vanilla pudding mix did make the dough a bit of a different color, and I thought some of my cookies were more done then they were.  I would make these again.

Perfect. I took the cookies out of the oven as soon as they started to darken and left them to cool on the pan. They came off the pans nice and brown Delish.

Much like jlcook, I found that these cookies were overly sweet and had an unplesant cakey texture.  They also spread out on the baking sheet, making them very thin, not like the picture.  However, I'm wondering if I did something wrong because there are so many other stellar reviews.  I may try this again and hope for a different result.

I can't rave enough about these cookies! I get looks of sheer awe when I serve these. As other reviewers have mentioned, take about 2 tblsp of pudding mix out and set it aside. There's a distinctive 'processed' taste to them if you use too much. Besides, after a few batches you have enough saved up for another batch! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2c brown, 1/4c white. I threw some chopped marshmallows in just to see what happens and oh boy are they amazing once they're cool!!!
Thanks for this recipe Pam, its a lifetime keeper for sure!

I used instant chocolate pudding since I didn't have vanilla pudding, othewise followed the recipe.  They were very good, but I overbaked them a little thinking they would be doughy if Ididn't bake them more than the recipe called for.

Not crazy about the taste of these.  I found the instant pudding gave the cookie a slightly artificial taste.  Little disappointed because it was rated so highly.

These were great; I made them for a church function and they were the only ones completely gone! The only things I changed was that I used Instant custard instead of vanilla pudding, only used one stick of butter. and, since I didn't have chocolate chips, I broke up raspberry-filled Ghirardelli squares and put them in there. I wasn't sure about all these changes, but they were still amazing!

Sometimes you just crave a really good, basic chocolate chip cookie and this is it. I would have never thought to add the pudding. They were nice and chewy and not flat at all.

not at all what I think of when you say chocolate chip cookie.  The middle was not done, the batter dry and flaky, and (I can't believe I am going to say this) way too many chocolate chips.

This is my FAVORITE  chocolate chip cookie recipe ever! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I've also used white chocolate chips. This recipe is a no fail. Everyone always loves them. The cookies stay soft days after they're made (however they rarely last long!)

This was a great recipe. They stayed large and didn't flatten out like most of the chocolate chip recipes I've made. They are great just as the recipe says or if you want you can add 1/4 tsp. mint extract and some mint chips and WOW! So easy I made both kinds for when we have company. I just add a little green food coloring to the mint ones so you know which are which.

This is a great recipe...VERY quick to make and kid friendly. I am a fan of soft cookies so I am always looking for good chewy cookie recipes. This one is a keeper. My kids raved about the different kinds of pudding that we can use in the future. Iam excited to mix and match!!

What a great cookie!!  I used cheesecake pudding and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  These cookies came out thicker and a little cake-like.  I do prefer a chewier cookie, but these tasted DELICIOUS!  If you don't want them too thick, make sure you pat them down a little on the cookie sheet before baking.  Also, I only cooked mine for 8-9 minutes.

I've made these 3 times, and while they were fabulous each time, the 3rd time the cookies were much flatter (not sure if the batter was too warm?) In any case, there has never been any cookies left to get stale when I've made these. Kids were "claiming" the cookies for their lunchboxes the next day. Thanks!

I made 3 different kinds (so far), regular chocolate chip with vanilla pudding, m&m with cheesecake pudding, and reverse chocolate chip using chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips. They stayed soft for over a week!!! Was described as the "perfect chocolate chip cookie" by one person I gave them to. The only change I made, was to only use 2 cups flour, that extra 1/4 made it too puffy/cakey for me.

These cookies came out exactly how I've always wanted my cookies to look.  They were perfectly shaped, soft and chewy without being raw, or cakey.  They were flaky and crisp on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  That's phenomenal, but in the end... a cookie is about taste.  

When I read this cookie recipe, the FIRST thing I thought to myself was, "There is no salt... it needs salt to contrast and bring out flavor. “ But I baked the recipe as listed. Since it was the first run, I thought I'd trust it.  

Big mistake, everyone said they were bland and nothing special in taste.  Their beautiful texture, their perfect presentation didn't matter.

I would definitely make these again... with 1/2-3/4 tsp. salt.

It's amazing how 1 addition can make such a huge difference.  I feed 3 men on the weekends and they were all going crazy for these until they were gone.  I had no vanilla pudding on hand, so when I saw that someone else said that used cheesecake flavor with great results and I actually did have that, i went for it and was so pleased.

Great cookies! I made minor modifications - increased the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and added 1/2 tsp salt.

I like this recipe but tried it with white chocolate pudding mix and didn't like the flavor. I will try making this again with vanilla pudding. This a nice moist chocolate chip cookie.

This recipe has taken the place of my grandmother's recipe that was still being used by my 77-year-old mother - and she is a legendary cookie maker. I have used vanilla, cheesecake, and butterscotch pudding mix and all three turned out excellently.

Delicious! I accidentally only used half a stick of butter and they still came out super tasty.  Probably a bit flatter than if I had used the full cup, but it still worked!

I have tried several chocolate chip recipes from this site. I was curious about this one because I have never used pudding in a cookie recipe before. I followed the recipe as written, except for putting the dough in the fridge for about an hour before baking, as I do with most of my cookie doughs. I'm not sure that that was a good idea. The dough got very hard and was difficult to scoop. After the first tray, I left it out on the counter and it worked much better. I scooped with a small Pampered chef scoop, putting the first tray in the oven as little scooped balls. They never spread. They came out as little mounds. The rest I flattened a little before baking. I liked the results much better. These had a pretty good flavor, but were a "cakey" texture cookie, not my favorite. That is why I rated it 4 star, however, they will not go to waste around my house. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were amazing! I didn't have butter so I substituted it with vegetable oil spread (supposed to be better for you) and even ran a little short on the pudding mix but it all turned out amazing! I would suggest using milk chocolate chips because they melt in the cookies really well :)

Wonderful cookies! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and they came out great. I've always liked the 'secret' ingredient of pudding mix so this caught my eye. Everyone should try it!

So light and fluffy!  They were delicious (and so was the batter)  I used the cheesecake pudding mix that some others suggested, and it was perfect.  My only mistake in making these is only putting 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips in it.  It looked like it was going to be more than enough when I was mixing it in, but the final product could have used some more chips!

Easy and super soft cake-like cookies!  They bake up very "pretty."  I just dropped on the non-stick sheet and baked for 12 minutes at 375 degrees.

I followed the suggestions that I could cut the butter in half.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the T.  The dough was too dry and they didn't flatten out while they cooked.  I used 1 package of chocolate chips, which seemed to be a bit overkill.  Next time, if I cut the butter in half I will also add applesauce to compensate.  Also, I cooked them in 2 batches.  The first batch I cooked for 10 mins.  The 2nd batch I cooked for 12 mins.  The 2nd batch was a little too dark on the bottom.  Good luck!

Absolutely the best cookie. Need to double the recipe as the cookies quickly disappear. Next time I will only add 1/2 of the Choc chips as it seemed a little overpowering.

These turned out great. I didn't quite have enough semi sweet chips so mixed in a little bit of milk chocolate. I also like to make them a bit bigger. They are soft and chewy the next day, which is what I was looking for, so thanks!

I just brought these into work - it's 10am and they're already disappearing! I made two batches: one with vanilla pudding mix and chocolate chunks r/th chocolate chips (I followed others' advice and used the whole bag).  The second batch I made with Devil's Food pudding mix and white chocolate chips.  WOW!  Absolutely amazing.  One thing I might change next time: I think I'd limit the white chocolate chips to 2 cups in the devil's food batch - using the whole bag is excessively sweet, unless you're a really big white chocolate enthusiast.  I can't wait to try some new variations.

I've made these cookies a few times now. I used sugar free puddings, different flavors. I just love the fact they are soft, well shaped and very tastey. I don't think they are the best choc. chip cookie I've ever had  (still looking for the "perfect recipe", but they turn out great everytime and are my fav recipe i've tried so far. They always get ALL eaten up.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever seen! They didn't expand outwards as much as most, so my first dozen were really teeny, but that didn't effect the taste at all.  They were soft and slightly chewy. Great recipe.

This was a very good cookie! I overbaked it by ten minutes because I didn't know that it comes out of the oven really, really soft and hardens within minutes, so it was a bit hard when I ate it, but the taste was great and I'm sure that if I had baked it leww, it would come out perfect! I will make it again (and bake less) and highly recommend. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Pam!

I've made half a batch of "Award Winning Chocolate Chip Cookies" at least 20 times. Half a batch of those cookies is the same as this recipe. My husband and all of our friends love them. Excellent cookies with endless variations.

My family LOVES these! My grandmother raves about them and asks me to make them all the time because theyre soft. I try to incorporate other cookie recipes into the mix (including other chocolate chip ones), and the family always wants me to use this one:) Thank you Pam for a great recipe!!

Very good cookie. Easy to make and not as sugary as some chocolate chip cookies but just as sweet.

Made this recipe over the holidays and they were one of the first deserts to go! I made a second batch for home and the cookies stayed very moist and fresh for days! Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

Made these with my 3 year old granddaughter exactly as written except we did half semi sweet choco chips and half white choco chips. Moist, sweet and chocolatey, AWESOME can't keep her out of them (or my husband either)

I was really disappointed with these cookies. I made them as written and they tasted salty the day after baking them. I think that is strange because I didnt add any salt but wonder if that is from the pudding mix. I'll stick to the recipe on the crisco butter shortening bars. They are always a hit!

Wonderful, easy recipe. Delicious. I usually use the recipe on the back of the Nestle bag but wanted to try something different.  Glad I did.

It really doesn't get much better than this. These cookies come out almost perfect. They are so soft. The only thing that could use improving is that they could be just a tad sweeter.  I believe the pudding makes the cookie soft but loose some of the traditional choc. chip cookie flavor. If you are not a baker, you probably won't notice. I've tried upping the sugar just a little and I've tried other peoples suggestions of adding vanilla and salt. For the record: I do recommend adding 1/2 cup of white sugar, and 1 whole tsp of vanilla, but NO salt. The salt makes them taste weird, which surprises me since most chocolate chip recipes require sugar. But, I recommend leaving it out. Also, if you're using a cookie baller tool, the recipe yields 3 dozen, not 4.

I never baked in my life, seeing this I went and bought everything needed and baked cookies. Only thing is instead I used Andes mints and after reading reviews decided to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. They make small Andes mints in a bag for baking but if you cant find any its best to buy the normal size ones, unwrap them all and freeze them. Than just use something to crush them while they're frozen. Great recipe and hear about it all the time from my friends, and yes believe it or not im a male!

Oh my... These are the best chocolate chip cookies i have ever made. I always have problems with them being over/undercooked .... But these came out absolutely perfect. I did use 1 stick butter and 1 stick of margerine, and with the chips i used 1 cup regular size chips and 1 cup of mini chips. I cant wait to experiment with different flavor pudding mixes and chips :)

These cookies are fantastic! I took one reviewer's advice and used chocolate chunks instead of chips and used half butter and half margarine. The pudding really makes this recipe and I would recommend it to anybody. So delicious!

Wow these were delicious!!!! I have one of those  neighbors who had this awesome chocolate chip cookie recipe, but would leave out one key ingredient. It wasn't so much the taste that was off, but the texture. Man was I surprised that it was vanilla pudding! whether this is where she found her recipe or not, I don't even care. What matters is locking up these scrumptious cookies so I dont eat all of them!

This recipe was great! Of course being a health nut I made my own changes, for those watching their sugar and fat use:
•Smart balance or any butter substitute
•Regular splenda for the white sugar
•Brown sugar splenda for the brown sugar
•Sugar free non-fat vanilla pudding
•I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and for the remaining 1/4 all-purpose flour
•Substitute dark chocolate morsels instead of milk chocolate

And now you have delicious chocolate chip cookies you won't feel guilty eating!

These are the best cookies. Everyone asks me to do them all the time. I recommend baking them for at least 12 minutes for them to have a nicely crisped base. Another good idea is serving half a teaspoon to make bite-sized cookies.

I was very hopeful after reading so many positive reviews for this recipe....but was greatly disappointed.  I didn't have a problem with the cakey texture, but the flavor was definitely NOT there!!  Some of the reviews complained they were too sweet, but I don't think they were sweet enough.  The only flavor they had was from the chocoate chips, and that's my least favorite part of the cookie.  My son said they wore "ok, but not awesome."  I geuss I'll stick with the Tollhouse recipe.

YUM... I made these for a pot luck at work.  My co-workers were begging for more.  I used chocolate instant pudding instead of vanilla and it was a larger box 3.9oz of pudding.

Best chocolate chip cookie ever!!! I did make changes based on some reviews though. I removed 1 tbsp of the pudding mix, added 1 tbsp milk, and added 1/2 tsp salt to the recipe. Perfection!!! I can't wait to try different pudding flavors. These are better than tollhouse hands down.

I love baking and have many favorite cookie recipes, but I am always looking for new ideas and better recipes.  This one was not it at all.  The texture was good and they did taste ok, but there was definitely an odd taste.  I cannot see making these again, especially considering that there was a full cup of butter in this recipe.  The pudding sounded great, as I have always loved recipes with pudding in cake.  The cookies, though, are better without pudding mix in my opinion.

I love these cookies, they are the best I have ever eaten.I love the moistness of them. One day I was doubling them and I forgot to double the butter, I decided its allot less greasy but it still tastes the same. It's just my experience of course. :)

Absolutely delicious! I made them exactly to the recipe and they turned out wonderful. They even came out better than the picture. I used an air pan and that does make quite a difference in the look of the cookie. They are perfectly moist and sweet.

These cookies were easy to make and a crowd pleaser.  I'm not sure if my oven is extraordinarily hot or not, but I baked the cookies for just 8 minutes and they were a touch too well done.  I recommend keeping an eye on the first batch to make sure you don't burn the cookies.

I think they were good but not great.  Having said that, I couldn't stop eating them tonight!  I'll try once more with cheesecake pudding since so many people raved over that.  I made with semi sweet choc chunks and that part was awesome.

OMG!!! Wish I could give 10 Stars. These were AWESOME! I took them to a meeting and got rave reviews. I am on the strick diet, but had to try one before I took them. I always like to know the taste of what I am taking. Left a couple home for my husband to try and he loved them. I think the pudding made such a difference from my others. Will make some for the grankids. This is a keeper!!!!

These are really good and the proportions of the ingredients are perfect. I used Ghiradelli semi sweet chocolate chips and they were great because the cookies were not overly sweet. I used 1/2c margarine and 1/2c butter to minimise spreading and they turned out very well. 10 minutes was the perfect baking time for my oven. I brought these to work and they were all gone by noon! This weekend I will try them with the cheesecake or white chocolate pudding flavour. I also think that there is a lot of scope for playing around with flavors...PB/butterscotch chips and caramel/cheesecake pudding etc...

My family loved these cookies! The vanilla instant pudding mix helped with the flavor! They were so cakey! Definitely reccomending to friends!

Loved this recipe!  I used what we had in the pantry - whole wheat flour and a white chocolate pudding mix.  I added a little milk to the batter to keep them moist with the whole wheat flour.  Turned out fantastic!

THANK YOU MOM...first time making these, they are now at the top of my cookie list!!! oh so yummy.... made a second batch with substitutes, ( you have to like banana cream and peanut butter and chocolate... i will admit they are different but yes they are good. Best if done as a bar instead of cookies.
i used 2oz vanilla pudding mix and 2 oz banana cream mix, added 1/4 - 1/3 cup peanut butter in place of that much butter, added TBS spoon or 2 baking cocoa and chopped reeces pieces instead of chips,  all these were only because i ran out of the regular items, all in all they are actually pretty good, more of a breakfast item to be eaten with a cold glass of milk...
I highly recommend the original recipe!!! Absolutely wonderful!! i will definitely make many many more times..!!!

these where great cookies, just a note I used a round teaspoon for the cookies and they puff up and become nice soft cookies, and if you perfer yours a little crunchy like me about 6 minutes into cooking time I used a spatula and litely pressed down, and so i had the soft that my wife likes and the crunchy that i liked, and my daughter just loves both

This recipe wasn't that good...my family is a chocolate chip cookie freak and they didn't care for it much...the cookies were puffy, soft but more cake-like in texture..i did follow it exactly and not sure what i did wrong but will try something else..

These were so dry, and cakey.  They were hard as rocks the next day, even though I put them in an airtight container.  I will take neste or pillsbury dough anyday over these.

I didn't have vanilla so I used a chocolate pudding mix instead.  It made a tasty double chocolate chip cookie.  However it was not my favorite, for some reason there was a grainy taste to it.  In a pinch though it makes a good cookie and the kids love it which really is all that matters anyway =)

I love these cookies too.  I added oatmeal and someone suggested, 1 1/4 cup flour and 3 cups of oatmeal.  They are delicious and a bit more nutritious.

Sooooo delicious!  I made mine with chocolate pudding.  I baked the first half of the batch right away and just dropped them.  They were great.  The second batch I refridgerated for about 15 mins before baking them and I formed them into balls and then squished them downa bit on the sheet.  These were amazing!  I always need to remind myself beforehand to chill the dough.  Very important!

I make a good chocolate chip cookie, so I decided to try to best myself with a new recipe. Mistake! Didn't like these at all. Missing salt and very bland, texture seems off as well (and I like soft cookies.)  I'm hoping these taste better in the morning.  Average at best.

Melt butter soft before mixing. Cook exactly 12 minutes. Mound cookies look better than when flattened. Used cheesecake pudding mix- not sure if that's what makes the cookies fluffy w/light crispy coating. Next time try w/no pudding mix and see if it's worth it.

I used half butter and half cream cheese...  Fluffy and chewy is an awesome combination.  These are the closest thing to my grand mothers cookies.  I love them!

I've been making these cookies for about a year. I've tried some other recipes but this is my go to recipe for an awesome chocolate chip cookie! They turn out delicious every time. The guys that my husband works with love it when I make them because I send about 2 dozen with him and they never make it to lunch. :)

Update: I made what I thought was a mistake tonight... I set the oven for 350 instead of 375. I baked the cookies (which I used chocolate fudge instant pudding in) for 13 minutes on my baking stone. I didn't know they could be better than in the past but they are!!

Fabulous cookies!  Very light, crispy edges with soft, tender centers.  Perfectly sweet.  I've been looking for a recipe that mimics something you'd buy in a good coffee shop or bakery, and I think this is it!

These are a family favorite at our house! I've already made 9 batches and have "orders" for more. Anytime someone needs a pick me up, I make these cookies. My daughter also likes to put colored sprinkles on the top for the holiday we are making them for. I am not a person who likes to bake, but when I mention these, EVERYONE wants some!

Wonderful!  Two dozen were frozen but were removed from the freezer and finished off the next day.  A double batch is definately in my future!  The only change I made was using three bars of semi-sweet baking chocolate chopped to equal the chips required as that was what I had on hand.  Also I used a small melon scoop to drop out the dough onto the baking sheets which is very time efficient.  The only problem with this recipe is that one has to share the finished product! Actually having folks to share with is a blessing though isn't it?  Thank you for sharing this top notch recipe.

These turned out wonderful.  Even used half whole wheat flour.  YUMMY!!!  Still trying to figure out how to not make the bottoms so brown, though.  DELICIOUS!

incredibly awesome! I made some with white chocolate chips and chocolate chunks and underbaked them so they'd be even more soft.   Thanks for sharing. These cookies rock my world. Best cookies I've ever made.

mine did not spread, I used spenda, brown sugar splenda blend, and sugar free vanilla pudding (oz. equivalent is off so I used 2/3 of the big pack)  other than the fact they didn't spread, and I had to cook them for like 15-17 minutes because of the thickness they are delicious, my father and brother liked them ; ) and they are super picky.  for better results shape them how you want to be shaped and bake for 9 minutes. I did this because I had a little bit left over cookie dough and learned from the first batch i put in the oven. these came out perfect, i must say i kind of like the one's that didn't spread better they are fluffy and kind of cakey like a a cake-cookie hybrid : )

made these cookies for my older brother, he absolutely loved them and calls them "pillow cookies" I like the idea of being able to flavor the cookies with different kinds of pudding. These cookies DO NOT spread whatsoever and the idea is to have the bottoms of the cookie almost match the top. I pulled these out before they looked "done" My next batch will be with pumpkin spice flavored pudding mix and chocolate chips! :)

I just finished making these cookies and they are definitely not a disappointment!! I followed the recipe to a T, but I substituted margarine for the butter, as I was out of butter. I used Lactantia Healthy Attitude margarine and it worked beautifully. I will probably try it next time with butter, but I've actually never had a choc. chip cookie recipe work so well with margarine :) Yummy yummy! 5 stars!

This is the best recipe I have ever found and I will keep it forever! The cookies are so moist and chewy. They come out with the perfect color at 10 minutes in my convection oven. This is the staple cookie recipe for all future bake sales and social functions!

Immediately upon having made these, I gave a 5 star review.  And they *are* great cookies - they cook evenly, stay soft, and have a fabulous flavor.  However, by the end of the batch I was almost dreading just how sweet each cookie was.  I'm sure part of this could be alleviated by, as many other reviewers did, adding a tsp of salt.  I do think I would go even further and cut out the 1/4 cup of white sugar.  Otherwise, we made "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies" last night and I think that recipe would have to be my 5-star.  But this is still a great one - especially if you were bringing the cookies to a bunch of people so the sweetness never became overwhelming.

As another reviewer noted, these cookies do have an aftertaste and did not come out as thick and chewy as I would have liked.  They taste good enough and do stay moist when stored for a day or two but also were very fragile.  Seems like this recipe just missed.

This is, by far, the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have come across. As a Home Ec. teacher, I have tried literally dozens of recipes for cookies that have fallen short, but this one is simple, easy, quick, and DELICIOUS. The cookies stay chewy for days when kept in a sealed container, and they do not flatten out when cooked like most do. They stay formed and rise perfectly.  Awesome recipe! Thanks so much. It's a keeper.

These cookies are GRRRrrrrreat!!!  I cut the butter to 1/2 c and added 1/4 tsp salt like others had suggested. I can't wait to see what my coworkers think about them when I take them to our Pot luck tomorrow.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now and they are ALWAYS a BIG hit! Everyone always BEGS me for the recipe, but I don't give it out ;-) My kids won't even eat store cookies anymore, they hold out for the real deal. FANTASTIC recipe!

Delicious!  I was tired of using the recipe from the choc. chip bag and ending up with flat cookies, so I tried this.  Two years later, it's my only choc. chip recipe. I always double the dough, add 1/2tsp extra baking soda, and freeze most of the dough. I place scooped dough balls on a parchment papered cookie sheet, freeze, then store in a freezer bag. When I want a few cookies, I take out and cook on 375 for 11min.  The cookies don't spread as much, but they still look and taste GREAT!

These chocolate chips were voted "the best ever" by my 13 year old son.  It's pretty hard to beat that!  They are truly delicious!

OMG I would give it more stars!!! this is the BEST chocolate chip cookie EVER!!!!!  I made the recipe as directed, only thing I had about 1c semi sweet chips, so I added white chocolate chips too.  These cookies are unbelievable!!  They are not like the normal chocolate chip cookie, they heve more "cookie" to them. NOT cake like though. Just like they are gourmet or from a cookie/bakery shop.  I will never make another kind of chocolate chip cookie. Now thinking of using this to make other cookies......or other add-ins! I don't know what the vanilla pudding does, but yum!  thinking of trying different flavors or pudding too!

In my years of baking, I have never baked chocolate chip cookies.  After a lot of begging from my kids, I finally tried the recipe on the back of the Toll House choclate chip bag.  The cookies tasted great when they were fresh out of the oven but after they have cooled off, they were HARD and tasted stale to me.  The kids would microwave them for a few seconds and they would taste great again.  I followed the recipe exactly twice.  I wasn't going to use it again because I didn't know how to fix it.  Then I saw this recipe with the excellent reviews so I tried it.  This recipe is excellent and the secret is the vanilla pudding mix.  I used my little cookie scoop and the dough did not spread.  I did the same for the Toll House and the cookies spread and flatten out.  So, I flatten the cookies out a bit by using a spoon.  The dough is very easy to handle.  I only used 1-1/2 cups of chocolate chips and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Family tasted them and prefer this recipe over Toll House.  The cookies stayed soft even after they've cooled off.

I haven't reviewed this yet, but I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now. This is the greatest, and so versatile. I've even used the base for peanut butter cookies, and a variety of other flavors. This is excellent.

Best Chocolate Chip Cookies I've ever made and so easy to do!  My twin grandsons helped me make them and they turned out great.  The vanilla pudding makes them moist enough, but still has a crunch to them.  Very tasty...I'll certainly make them again.

November 2007- These were absolutely amazing.  I made the dough the night before and kept it in the fridge.  The next night I rolled each cookie into little balls and baked them for 11 minutes.  They looked like perfect little cookies!  I made them six days ago and kept them in a sealed tupperware container and they were still yummy last night.  Thanks for sharing this one!  I've tried lots of chocolate chip cookie recipes but this one is a keeper.  UPDATE-  7/5/09-  I STILL love this recipe and I'm always trying new chocolate chip recipes...this is my go-to recipe.  I've also placed the dough in mini muffin tins and when they are done I immediately press a miniature Reese's peanut butter cup in the middle.  To die for!

These were really good and I like the texture a lot.  I agree with previous reviews that they need a little salt to counteract the sweetness.  They seemed a little too sweet and I am a total sweets lover. I will probably add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt next time and see if that helps.

I am in the middle of making these and had to submit my review before I forgot.  These are wonderful!  Last week my son and I made the "award winning choc. chip cookies" from this site and we loved them and everyone who ate one said the same but today I decided to try another recipe to start experimenting.  I changed just a few small things, I added a splash more vanilla, a splash of milk as per other reviews, a tad bit of salt and also used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips for something different.  Half of the batter I put in 3/4 cup oatmeal because I love it so I will add to this if it's not as wonderful as the first ones but I don't see how it can't be.  I think I actually like these better than the "other" popular cookies I mentioned earlier.  However, on the back of the Ghiradelli package, the directions are almost identical to these except the amounts of sugar and vanilla are different.  No matter, they are suberp!  Better get back to the oven!

This were wonderful!  Our neighbors gave us cookies like this for Christmas and I almost died everytime I ate one :)  I'm so happy to have found a recipe this good.  My cookies turned out more poofy than in the picture, but they were still very soft and stayed that way for days.

This is now our favorite cookie!  I added about a cup and a half (cooked)oatmeal since we like that in our chocolate chip cookies, and about a teaspoon of salt for taste since some complained of it being bland.  The texture turned out slightly crispy on the outside, and extremely light and soft on the inside.  Great flavor! This is a keeper!

I was out of brown sugar so I added about 1/3 c. molasses to a 1 1/4 c. white sugar.  Also, because I live in central Mexico, where they don't sell instant vanilla pudding, I used instant vanilla flan and I added about 1/2 c. extra flour because of altitude.  I think they turned out quite yummy.

This is a great easy recipe..same as the Award Winning Choc. Chip Cookie, I think.  I had a package of french vanilla.  When I added it, I smelled that real fake 'coffee creamer vanilla' smell and was afraid it would be overpowering in the cookie.  It also added a real dark yellow color to the batter.  It did not overpower; as a matter of fact, I couldn't taste the vanilla really.  They baked like a picture and baked 12 min. on the Airbake sheet, 10 minutes on the Oneida non-stick.  Each cookie sheet holds alot, as they do not spread.  They are cake-like in texture, real soft.  Great for air mail travel which is where these are headed.  I guess the debate will always continue:  crisp or cakey.  They tasted great.  I used a package of those white chocolate/milk chocolate swirled chips and they looked pretty.  I think the pudding more added to the texture and not to the taste.  I would definitely make again especially if sending via airmail.

Bland. I am not impressed with this recipe, and am shocked at all the "good" reviews it recieved--which is why I gave it a go.  The dough had no flavor, and was more dry than it was chewy and soft.

These are the BEST chocolate chip cookies ever. But not just chocolate chip! In the last four days, I've made these six times...twice with the original recipe, but I've experimented with different puddings and different chips. Try chocolate pudding with white chips, white chocolate pudding with macadamia nuts instead of chips, french vanilla pudding and dark chocolate chips. OH the possibilities are endless! These are INCREDIBLE! I did as others and added about 1/4 tsp. salt. Also, both the dough and the cookies freeze wonderfully!!! Thanks for an incredible recipe!!

I would have to agree with "ADZELL."  These cookies were OK, my husband (who is a fiend for cookies) didn't really like them.  The cookies did not spread at all and were very condensed and cake-like.  I also found the flavor to be very bland.  I took them to a small dinner and hardly any were eaten.  Sorry, I will not make again.

I gotta say, really only so-so.  The texture is great, definitely good for a cookie - though I thought out of the oven they were a little too crumbly and raw feeling  - better after cooled.  But the taste lacked the.... umph that other cookies did.  Maybe it's because I used french vanilla? (All that walmart had)  I also think the lesser amount of white sugar contributed a little, but I definitely feel like the salt was missing - I'll add that next time, maybe, and try again.

This is my least favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.  These were too cakey and the flavor was bizarre.  No one here liked them...I guess they are just not our style.

This was a yummy cookie, the batch went pretty fast after I made them! I would suggest to keep the cookies between 7-8 minutes in the oven because they brown really quickly, or check on them after this time. Great recipe!

These were very soft!  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  It made 48 cookies (not 24 as the recipe indicates).

I stopped looking for a soft, yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe once i tried this one.  Very good flavor, they turn out thick (not thin like some recipes) and soft, too!  Excellent chocolate chip cookie.

Fan-tas-tic! It's an easy recipe that yields awesome cookies! It'll be my go-to from now on. First time I made them I only had butterscotch chips and they were delicious! The second time I used chocolate chips and they were, again, delicious! Next time I'm using chocolate chips and adding some nuts. They're bound to be yummy! Go bake - you won't be disappointed!

Soft and moist cookies.Not as sweet as Toll House ; I like less sweetness. Took a tip from anther poster and added 2 tablespoon milk and removed 1 tablespoon of the pudding mix. My family loved them. This recipe will be fun to work with and change up flavours in the future. Oh, I also removed 2 tablespoons of the butter and did not miss it.Next time I will add 1/2 tsp salt.

These cookies came out way too soft. I like cookies with a crunch. Next time, I might use less egg and flatten out the cookie dough before baking. Actually, if the pudding is there, then you don't even need the egg. There was a slight baking soda taste to the cookie.

I love to cook, but I NOT a baker. My husband loves chocolate chip cookies, but I've never been able to master them. Decided to try this one for a cookie exchange and oh my gosh, they are amazing! I made a few tweaks and they are truly the most gorgeous cookies - crumbly on the outside, soft on the inside and they don't spread. This is what I changed - used butter flavor crisco instead of butter, 1 egg, 1 1/2 t. vanilla, 1/4 t. salt, lowered the flour to 2 cups, used chocolate chunks instead of regular. Baked at 350 for about 10-12 minutes. I also made them a little larger, rolled in balls and flattened just a tad on the top. Also, I doubled the recipe and used 1 box vanilla pudding & 1 box of cheesecake pudding. Everyone went crazy over these cookies and they all want the recipe! Gorgeous presentation and look better than gourmet cookie I've every seen. Can't say how happy I am to have found this recipe - I'm now a cookie master! Thanks for sharing!

I have a cookie exchange coming up so I thought I'd 'test' out of few different recipes that I've been saving in my recipe box.  I tried this one last night & made exactly as written. We thought they were just ok. Not much flavor to them at all. I'm not sure of the exact reason for the pudding but I didn't think you could really taste it. Guess I'll keep looking.........  Thanks for the recipe.

These were FANTASTIC. I am pregnant and out of no where had a craving for chocolate chip cookies. I chose this recipe for the title & didn't want a pumpkin or peanut butter taste...but the vanilla pudding mix sounded like a great idea. After going to the store to get the rest of the ingredients & preparing this recipe to nearly a T (i completely melted the butter) these cookies came out PERFECT. At first, i baked them at 375F for 11 minutes, but found they were borderline burnt (but tasted fine) so i changed it to 9 minutes and they were perfect. (my batch was a bit thick) These were so tasty & soft. They did not spread or become flat but rather went straight up to create a kind of tall cluster choco chip cookies which i loved. Definitely going into my recipe book!!!!

Made exactly as the recipe listed and they were phenomenal. Anyone familiar with Publix chocolate chip cookies, these are it! As someone who grew up with Publix but now lives in a part of the country w/o them, I miss their cookies! I have been searching for a recipe to recreate them and this is very very close. I used Semi-sweet chocolate chips (a 12 oz bag), and a small cookie scooper and hand made a few. They do not spread very much with the scooper, so they came out looking like chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream scoops, still good and made nice little hand held snacks for people. The hand made ones were larger and flatter, and these tasted just like the Publix cookies I mentioned earlier. It made about 50 smaller cookies (about an inch across full cooked), and about 10 larger cookies (about 3 to 4 inches across fully cooked), so this recipe will make A LOT of cookies! They also stayed really well for up to 4 days, unlike some other cookies that turn to concrete 24 hours after baking, in a paper towel lined tupperware container. I have read some other reviews suggesting to make it with various other flavors of pudding mix, and I may try a few of those, but the fact they taste so much like my coveted Publix cookie, I doubt I will mess with this recipe much. Def recommend and will make more!

This is my absolute favorite cookie recipe!  I use cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla sometimes, and those are to DIE for!  I also make them sugar free with S/F pudding, Splenda white and brown, and dark chocolate or sugar free chocolate (chunk it up myself). These are always the favorite everywhere I go!

I have only had ONE person tell me that the cookies were only "okay" come to find out they like the choc chip cookies that are hard and crunchy...not this recipe. I LOVE THIS recipe, its perfect, I add a little kosher salt, and also like to tap the mound of cookie down a bit so they don't turn into cookie mountains. I have made this with both gas and electric ovens, and 10 mins time is perfect. Also, if you are looking to trim some fat, I make these with ONE stick of butter and they turn out perfect with no need to grease the cookie sheet. Enjoy!

These cookies are delicious and very moist. The first time I made them I did not have vanilla pudding mix so instead I used instant chocolate pudding mix with white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips - WOW!! So yummy! Also, I didn't use 2 cups of chips, but rather cut it down to about 1 1/4 cup chips. I later made a batch with instant vanilla pudding and semi-sweet chocolate chips and to be honest, my husband and I liked the chocolate pudding mix cookies better.

Absolutely amazing! These are my new all time favorite cookies. Rather than just vanillia instant pudding I added French vanillia pudding. The cookies were very light and fluffy. Most cookies I make are very flat and crispy but these are just melt in your mouth soft.

These were okay when they first came out of the oven.  Left for a day at room temperature, they were also okay, but the ones I put in the fridge got rock hard.  Even after leaving them out again for a bit, they remained almost too tough to eat.  I would make again, but only right before they are to be eaten.

I absolutely love these cookies! First time using the pudding for chocolate chips, but theyre fantastic!!Instead of the vanilla pudding I used White Chocolate pudding mix and substituted cherry morsels for 1 cup of chocolate chips! I love the way they held their shape and they were super moist! FANTASTIC recipe!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have made it three times since I found it and have been pleased each and every time.  I have two suggestions, I found that a pinch (or two) of salt was needed to counteract the sweetness of this cookie.  I also froze my second batch before cooking them and that gave me a nice crisp bottom while not taking away from the ooey gooey center.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These cookies are what I make when I want to impress someone. My entire family loves them and looks forward to me making them on special occasions. The reason why I reserve them for once in a while is because they contain a lot of butter and I don't replace any of it with lower-fat alternatives. These cookies are best made as-is, and they are spectacular. I have played with ingredient flavors, changing up the pudding (used butterscotch pudding) or the chips/nuts, but this recipe is wonderful without any change. A keeper!

These are the best chocolate chip cookies EVER! Everytime I make them, wherever I am, everybody raves about them.  They stay soft because of the pudding, and are unbelievably delicious. I did not change anything, except I did not use salt. They do not need to be altered whatsoever.  If you are looking for an amazing recipe that your friends will not stop talking about, this is it!!

The only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use! It's absolutely delicious and unlike any other recipe I've made or tasted. Not many people have ever heard of using pudding mix in cookies... so this recipe really shines. Sure to be a hit =)

Too bad for everyone else though, I was making cookies practically every night in search for a great recipe!

Had to make something in a hurry & had everything to make cookies.  I have many cookbooks and couldn't find 1 chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I signed on to Allrecipes.com and found this one.  Love it.  Thanks, you got me out of a pinch.

these cookies were amazing! completely worthy of 5 stars. if you have free time, these are definitely a delicous reward! we also added white and dark chocolate chunks (chunks instead of chips) and they turned out so well! they are a good mixure between cruchy and cakey, all in all, a really awesome cookie!

Honestly, the best cookies my family and I have ever eaten, BUT THE RECIPE NEEDS A TEASPOON OF SALT!!!!  I thought it was weird that it didn't call for salt, so I added a teaspoon and perfection was made :)

I made these per the directions with the exception that I accidentally melted the butter as I was attempting to soften it. I also baked at 350.  They were a little puffy coming out of the oven so I lightly scored them with the side of my metal spatula to flatten.  These are very soft and chewy.

Best chocolate chip cookies ever! So moist and chewy and delicious. I tried the sugar free cheesecake instant pudding and used only 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips...d'lish! The hubby raved and said they were even better than his mom's - what compliment is better than THAT?

I made these first thing in the morning, and they filled my whole house with the sweet smell of cookies and woke up my whole family, who were all delighted to have them. They all commented on how moist and soft they were! I left out the pudding mix, but they were still great! Thank you soo much! I will definately recommend this to all of my friends!

This is a great recipe!!!  I decided to put my own twist on it because I like the combo of peanut butter and chocolate... I used a Chocolate instant pudding, and then mixed one cup of peanut butter chips with one cup of chocolate chips... These came out so good they were gone in a matter of hours! 

Thanks for such a great recipe. This will become my standard recipe for cookies from now on.

Not what I was hoping for. These cookies were very moist and stayed that way but had more of a cake texture but not as moist as cake. (The dough was not very appealing either, if you like cookie dough...) My family members are all big cookie enthusiasts and I thought these would be a big hit but they all admitted they didn't like the texture. They are missing that classic chewy cookie texture and flavor.

These were amazing! I used "I can't believe it's not Butter", and used a little less brown sugar. These were wonderful, and the few left in the fridge have disappeared!

These cookies were awesome! Actually I made mine kind of small, so they made a lot more than 22. These do taste like cake in the middle, which makes it even better. These cookies are definatly a keeper!

These are better than the cookies on the back of the chocolate chip package, but I've had better chocolate chip cookies before and I was hoping these were them.  I will definitely replace my usual recipe with this. I will also try the cheescake pudding mix next.  Thanks for the ideas!

These were delicious!  I made a few changed though.  I mixed all the wet ingredients in one bowl, and all the dry in another, then slowly added the dry into the wet while the mixer was going.  These were done right at the 10 minute mark for me, so make sure they don't burn!  They tasted amazing!!    Andes Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies: Instead replaced the choc chips with 2 cups cut up Andes Mints.  I then added 1 tsp of mint extract (as well as the Vanilla extract).    They tasted amazing!!  I'm looking forward to trying different pudding mixes and different chips!

These are the best chocolate chip cookies my family has ever had. Money being tight this year, for Christmas, I made homemade treats for the adults in the family. I researched A LOT of recipes on this site before deciding to use this one. Follow this recipe EXACTLY and you will be enjoying these delicious cookies, too. Thank you so much for posting!!!!

These cookies are wonderful!  The only change I made was the cooking time and temperature; 350 for 17-18 seems to be perfect.  All the other times I made them the cookies would bubble or burn and become too hard.  This is a GREAT recipe though!  Thank you!!!

I made these cookies for my family and they ate them up in minutes! These remind me of the Chocolate Chip Cookies my Gramma used to make, and she was the BEST cook ever! With slight modifications this recipe can be made in a wide variety of ways. Adding the pudding mix is a stroke of genius, and makes these the BEST COOKIES EVER!

Awesome!  These cookies are the best.  I read the reviews, and in order to flatten the cookies a bit I melted the butter and they turned out delicious-not as cake like. They are a favorite among my family :)

These are some tasty chocolate chip cookies.  Much better than the old Tollhouse recipe.  The pudding makes them stand up a bit higher and they seem to stay chewier for longer.  The first time I made them they seemed kind of 'greasy'... but in that good buttery way.  I just made a batch where I swapped half the butter and put in 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce.  Still chewy and delicious, but don't leave your fingers greasy. Yum!  Also tried this recipe w/ red and green M&Ms for Christmas and it worked very well.

My new "secret" recipie! I love this recipie. I tweaked it a little bit to make it perfect. I added just a 1/2 teaspoon more of baking soda and it made the cookies nice and fluffy. Key tips! Always use room tempurature softend butter it makes a difference. Don't try microwaving it, you will have flat cookies. Also I have done this recipie with smart balance and it tastes just as good!

For everyone who's having problems with flat cookies, remember to chill your cookie dough before you bake.  I put my dough back in the fridge between batches as well - no flat cookies.  Cold dough into hot oven.  I added 1/3-1/2 cup of milk to the recipe because it felt too dry as is.  The cookies came out great!  Hard on the outside and soft & chewy inside. Yes, somewhat cake-like but my family & I still enjoyed them.

I have been searching fo new cookie recipes to replace my old ones. For one I wanted better cookie recipes, and another, I lost all my old recipes! Anyways, I found this one and decided to try them. I made them and baked them all within 45 minutes cuz my meeting started in 45 minutes. I burnt my fingers taking them off the pan onto a plate and rushed over to my meeting. The cookies disappeared! Fast! A sign of a keeper! :D The only different thing I did was I used chocolate pudding mix! Turned out so yummy but crispy throughout! Will try less pudding mix next time! The box I had was larger than asked for BUT the smallest one sold.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful, they not only look beautiful when they are done, but they taste great as well.  I really love how soft they stay, I do not like a crunchy cookie...these are fabulous and VERY easy to make!  Thank you for sharing I have already passed this recipe on!

I don't usually enjoy chocolate chip cookies and rarely eat them, but these were delicious and the vanilla pudding makes them soft and chewy. My friend made them for a birthday party and they were a huge hit. Everyone couldn't stop eating them and they were gone before you knew it. I'm making them tomorrow night for my grandpa's 90th birthday :)

These are the best cookies EVER!!  I tried the vanilla first, and then the cheesecake instant pudding and I have to say cheesecake is my fav.  I also use one sick of butter and a little less of the sugar.  I can't wait to bring them to holiday parties, although I don't plan to give out the "secret ingredient" just yet ;)

Tried this recipe  because it had less butter than some others.  I made these cookies with whole wheat flour and substituted splenda baking mix for half the sugars.  They were delicious and the kids never had a clue that they were eating whole grain cookies..

Wonderful cookies. I used half of whole wheat half of regular all purpose flour. I also used 1/4 of splenda (instead of regular sugar). The cookies came out great! and are approved by a picky 6 year old.:)

I made this recipe with egg replacer, since my son is allergic to eggs.  This recipe has the best texture of any recipe I have made with the egg replacer.  The cookies were so soft.  My whole family enjoyed them.  I did add 1 cup of M&Ms in place of one of the cups of chocolate chips.

So I JUST finished baking my first batch of these cookies and I had to come online to review how amazing they are while the second batch is in the oven. I love these cookies, and I probably would have had a third batch but me and my roommate could not stop eating the batter! Granted they do not taste like a traditional chocolate chip cookie if that's what you're looking for, but they are still delicious :)

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have made....ever!  I used to make the recipe off the butter flavored crisco, which is also pretty good, but the consistency of this dough is much better, and doesn't dry out.  They baked evenly and the morning after, they are still nice and chewy.  Will definately make these again and again.

These cookies came out great. Much better than a mix. I followed the recipe exactly, but used french vanilla pudding mix, and they came out perfect. I cooked them exactly ten minutes and let them cool on the baking sheet for about five. It makes a little crunch on the outside and the middle melts. I will make them again and again.

I love these cookies! I added a pinch of salt and a little less flour. They were great. I shipped them to my husband and two days later they were still very soft. He and his army buddies raved about them. (My husband is a good cook and honest too) I have been experimenting with chocolate chip cookies and trying new recipes for a while and we're gonna stick with this one! DELICIOUS!

I previously reviewed these and thought they were dry. I failed to realize I had used the sugar free vanilla. My mistake! I made these again with french vanilla pudding and they were outstanding!  They stay soft and even better when you add nuts.

Just made these and added walnuts to the mix... holy fabulous cookies!!! I baked them a little longer, as I like "crispy", and they were perfect!  Still soft on the inside, crispy on the outside... fabulous with a tall glass of milk!  Will DEFINITELY make again!!!

These cookies are amazing! I didn't have any vanilla pudding so I used butterscotch and it turned out sooo good. I am going to try with chocolate pudding too just to see what it will taste like. They don't spread in the oven so remember to squish them down to size more than you would with a regular cookie.

Excellent recipe! I made it last weekend, and all my roommates loved them :) They stayed soft and fresh for as long as they lasted (about 4 days). I disagree with another reviewer-the raw cookie dough is delicious! I just bought more chocolate chips and chocolate pudding to try this recipe again. One small problem I encountered was crumbling more than other cookies. I took several on a trip with me, and they stuck together and crumbled more than I thought they would in the bag. Next time I will put them in a plastic container instead of a bag. Overall, a wonderful recipe that I will definitely make for years to come, with pudding and chip variations, of course.

This is a fast, simple chocolate chip cookie recipe. I substituted margarine for butter and egg beaters for eggs. My wife thought the cookies were delicious.

I LOVE these cookies!!!! They turned out much better than I hoped. I followed the recipe exactly but I can't wait to try other pudding flavors. This is not your ordinary crunchy cookie- it is big, fluffy and cakey but VERY delicious!!!!!

WOW! This is incredibly flavorful! I love how it stays chewy on the inside and just the right amount of crisp on the bottom. Definitely flatten the dough before baking if you want more of a cookie, otherwise it comes out lookig like a scone. Either way, it tastes amazing - thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent! I like to shake things up with cookies a bit. I made it with semi sweet/white choco morsels. And because I love peanuty butter I added about 2tbsp of peanut butter (and added a tiny bit more flour to balance). I also used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. Love them! They are just a bit crispy on the edges and gooey on the insides perhaps because of my modifications.

Sooooooo delicious. It helps to make them a little flatter before baking, as opposed to dough balls because they rise quite a bit, but other than that these are some of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. I cut out a little of the butter and added a little salt and they were to die for!

Before I made these I read the reviews on them like I do for all recipes I want to make.  One reviewer said that she used 1/2 c butter instead of 1 c and that they were still moist without all of the fat.  I don't know what I did wrong there, but that definately did not work for me.  Sometimes you cannot make things with less fat.  So the second time, I used the whole cup of butter and a 1/2 t of salt and they were delicious!  By the way does anyone know what would happen if you used the cook n serve instead of the instant?

I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2 sticks, and I used 3 oz of vanilla pudding mix, hoping for less of an aftertaste that i read about. The cookies didn't spread and looked nothing like the picture!

I made these while the kids were at school and between me and the kids, they were almost gone before dinner! They were delicious and they dont spread and they're not too sweet! But 2 C of choc. chips is too much. 1 C is perfect! And When you're putting them on the tray dont make them to thick! They burn and dont cook inside.

These turned out great! My kids and husband loved them. I didn't have vanilla so i left it out.  Tasted great even without it. The vanilla pudding mix is genius. They are very moist and cake like. They taste best right out of the oven, slightly cooled. I will continue making these for my family.

I really enjoyed these.  I didn't add salt b/c the pudding mix has sodium already.  I did add 1 TBS. of vanilla, and I think that makes it really nice. I will make these again, and I'll think I'll make these w/ lemon pudding and add frozen blueberries!  Ooooo, I can't wait!

This is EXACTLY the type of chocolate chip cookie I was looking for.  Thick, soft, chewy but definately not cakelike.  The only thing I did different was add a 1/2 tsp of salt and another tsp of vanilla.   These were excellent...

Oh My Goodness!!! This is going to be my best kept secret! I have never gotten so many rave reviewson whats usually a basic ordinary cookie. No one could figure it out and Im not telling them! This will now be my signature cookie and I'll make them often. Only minor (and much necessary)changes, were I omitted 1 tblsp of van. pudding mix, and took the advice to add 1/2 tsp salt, and only used 3/4 cups of butter. I have never seen my husband so amazed! I loved the compliments-Only 4 stars cause I had to make some changes to achieve the perfect cooke!! Thanks!

These cookies are very moist and yummy right out of the oven and for a day after... BUT if there are still some left after 2 or 3 days they get REALLY hard.

I've searched long and hard for the perfect thick, chewy, chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I've FOUND IT!!  I've done numerous Google searches for this chewy, thick cookie and have tried the recipes I've found but have had disappointing results. These results would either be FLAT and chewy or... FLAT, FLATTER, AND CHEWY (or crunchy).  I give triple kudos to this recipe.  It's the best and I am not sure I will want to share this recipe with anyone (LOL).  I'll just have to be that mommy who has the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe that she found while surfing the internet!  You won't be disappointed in this recipe.

this is the *best* chocolate chip cookie recipe i've ever worked with!    tried it today WITHOUT the pudding (only b/c i didn't have any on hand) and the cookies turned out okay.  the pudding definitely makes the cookie sweeter, and the texture softer.  my FAVE type of pudding to use in this recipe:  banana creme!  i've also tried fresh mashed banana, as well, which works well, too!

My mother-in-law makes cookies very similer to these.  she cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the same with the brown sugar. she also uses 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teas. Almond Extract.    We camp out alot and they are the first request by the kids.  They call them Grandma Smetzer Cookies.

I have been making chocolate chip cookies for years - is there any better cookie? :)  I normally just grab a bag of chocolate chips and follow the recipe, but this time I wanted to try something different.  I found these and I will never make another type of chocolate chip cookie ever again!  I cooked the cookies until the edges were just browned and they are sooooo moist!  I used french vanilla pudding mix this time, but the next time I will try another flavor of pudding mix.  GOOD STUFF!!!!

These cookies are evil. I can't get them into a container because they're all gone. I added a 1/2 tsp of dark rum (Pyrat is my choice) and use banana pudding. You can have the worst demeanor in the world but pass out one of these and everyone thinks you rock.

I make choc.chip cookies all the time. And have never had the problem i had with these.They cooked way to fast on the bottom!My best guess would be to much butter wich caused the over browning on the bottoms.Taste pretty good but next time will use 1.5 stick of butter. I did fix the problem by putting to layers of parchment paper down all in all its a keeper for me.

I have enjoyed cooking dinners for several years but have always been intimidated by baking. A good friend makes choc. chip cookies w/ pudding mix & I was looking for a recipe similar to his.  This was the 1st time I've made choc. chip cookies & I am ecstatic with the results! I suddenly have visions of baking cookies for the kids my husband & I don't even have yet! Based on reviews: I used only 1.5 sticks of butter, used the whole bag of milk chocolate chips, added 2teaspoons milk (skim) & 1/4 teaspoon of salt. And baked only 10 minutes. They taste like a trendy gourmet bakery, thank you!

These cookies were the best. All of my family always asks me to make them. I have the recipe memorized by know. Did you know that they taste good putting instant chocolate pudding in them instead of vanila pudding? You should try it!

These were very good. I did cut down on the butter a bit, and added a 12oz bag of semi sweet chips and about half a bag of bittersweet chips together. I also never cook chocolate chip cookies at anything over 350 degrees. I find I get a much better cookie if I cook them for 15 minutes at 350. They were moist and chewy on the inside, without being doughy.

These were wonderful! My fiancee is the biggest chocolate chip cookie critic and he said "now I can marry you" when he ate them. He wants more!  I followed the recipe to the T. I only had to bake mine for 10 minutes. Thank you.

Love this recipe. I've been using it since my kids were little and I discovered it in Parents Magazine. My kids are all grown up and I am still making these choc. chip cookies!  Just recently I have made one alteration: I use 1 1/2 sticks of butter, not 2.  Still turns out great.  I bake them at 375 for 10-12 min.  Crunchy yet soft!

The recipe calls for too many chocolate chips, I only used 1.5 cups and that was still very rich, I would probably use less still next time. Unless you like very chocolatey and rich cookies, try using less than what the recipe calls for.

I've been making these for a while.  EVERYONE LOVES THEM!  They just rave about how wonderful and soft they are.  My husband hates crunchy cookies, so these are wonderful.  I have tried different pudding mixes in the batter, and they are all wonderful.  Highly recommend these cookies!

When I tried one of these cookies right after taking the first batch out of the oven, I was disappointed, I thought the pudding taste overwhelmed the cookie.  After they cooled off though, the cookies tasted amazing!  My new fav recipe, looove them!!

This is a good cookie. I followed the suggestions of previous posters and added a pinch of salt and used saltd butter. I also added 3 tsp of milk and a bit more vanilla. And more chocolate chips. I used ghiradelli chips. I did use sugar free white chocolate pudding mis as this was all that I had and I wonder if that is why there was a little after taste. In any case the cookies are good and a bit poofy, which is what I wanted. I'll be making them again.

Excellent. I was really concerned when the batter came out very thick but the cookies were awesome.  We'll be using this again.

These cookies are delicious!  I make them all the time and have even made batches to give as gifts.  They always turn out perfectly and stay soft thanks to the pudding.  I often make it with chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, which is a great variation.

The BEST. The pudding mix is the key I think to these delicious cookies.

These cookies were wonderful!  The pudding made them so nice and moist.  I thought the texture was wonderful.  I made them with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips--just like the recipe called for.  Next time I might try chocolate pudding with mint or white chocolate chips.  Awesome!

My wife and son loved these cookies!  I made them for the first time.  After looking at the reviews, i took some of the advice of others...  here is what i changed:  used 1/2 salted and 1/2 unsalted butter;  added a couple teaspoons of milk (the batter just seemed a little thick);  baked for only 9 minutes.  The pudding mix really makes this a different cookie... my wife was going on and on about how soft they were!   Defenitely a bit hit in my house!

My 13 year old son made these and they came out very moist. They are cake like rather than crispy or chewy. They were fine but I prefer a cookie crispy on the edges and chewy in the middles. These were too cake like for my tastes, but an easy recipe for an inexperienced cook like my son to prepare.

Definately a very "cakey" cookie.. It were more like muffins than cookies.. very strange? But not that bad; however I will keep looking for the perfect cookie recipe that I have yet to find.

I love this recipe.  A lady I knew a few years ago made cookies with pudding added to them, but I never got the recipe from her.  This is it!  I also tried it with chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips, not as good, but a nice twist!

I think these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever! I'm not sure what the milk does, but I do it and they're fabulous. Only I like milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. And they taste funny warm, but once they're cool, they're fantastic..and soft forever!... well, as long as they last.. :)

Excellent cookie!  Great texture, not cakey and not crunchie- just right. I added another half cup of chocolate chips because you can never have too much chocolate!  Loved it.

I'm not sure how the recipe would come out with chocolate chips.  DREWZ311 posted that people he knows seem to like the cranberry & white chocolate chip variation.  He wasn't kidding.  These were great!  Super easy and super tasty!

Wow!  I think I have finally found a chocolate chip cookie that has toppled the tried and true Toll House Cookie recipe we make in our home. These cookies are a hit at home (first dozen were gone before they had a chance to cool down!) and at my hubbies work.  I used french vanilla and semi-sweet morsels and they came out with a nice "creamy" aftertaste unlike an earlier review that said they were left with a strange one.  I did add about 2 tablespoons of water and extra vanilla like others had suggested.  Can't wait to try this with chocolate pudding and peanut butter morsels! Perfect softness on the inside and just the right amount of "crispness" around the edges! Yum Yum, can't wait to make more!

This is the only recipe I will use for chocolate chip cookies from now on!  They were wonderfully moist and stayed that way even after being stored in a ziploc bag for a couple days!  Make sure and take them out of the oven as soon as the edges and/or high points of the cookies start to brown.  Don't be fooled by the rest of the cookies' light color - they're cooked all the way through!  They are also great with milk chocolate chips. Thanks so much for the recipe!  Yum!

This is an amazing recipe. It's a no-brainer that works every time.  It's the first recipe that I (as a novice cook) have decided to try my own variations.  The possibilities are endless.  Great way as a bachelor to let mom know you're no stranger to the kitchen.  Everyone's favorite variation seems to be my variety with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  ENJOY!

These cookies are very good, I have made them 3 or 4 times now and they come out good everytime.  They really dont taste all that diffrent from the recipes on the bags of chocolate chip cookies though.  I recomend using a small cookie scoop (small ice cream scoop) to make uniform evenly baked cookies.

These were good. But they were very crispy. I thought the pudding would have made them soft and chewy.

I love this recipe - the cookies are fantastic and SO soft!  I found that French Vanilla pudding really adds a great taste!  Also - even though the dough is tough to mix - I found melting the butter completely helped.

This is a GREAT cookie recipe!  I read all the reviews before making them, and the only thing I changed was that I added 1/4 tsp salt.  I baked them for about 8 minutes, which was plenty!  I used a Tbsp-sized cookie baller, and ended up with 5 dozen cookies.  They have a great flavor, and are nice and soft on the inside.  Definitely my new favorite Choc. Chip Cookies!!  Thanks, Pam!

The dough was really thick, so it was sort of difficult to mix.  My sweet lovers friends did not care for them; saying they were a little bland.  Other people (who liked a more simple taste) loved them.  They are very different from regular cc cookies, very cake like.  They do not get crispy at all.  Pretty good, but not what I really expected.

DELICIOUS!!! For us the recipe made an extra dozen or so cookies and they didn't stay soft very long.  They didn't turn out "cake-like" or crumbly as they did for other bakers (I don't think we did anything wrong- we followed directions exactly); ours were more like a standard cookie hardness & were excellent plain or when dipped in milk.  The flavor was divine.  Best choc. chip cookie recipe we've tried thus far. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are fantastic!  My cookies have always turned out crispy or not-quite-done until I tried this recipe.  The cookies are nice and chewy, without a doughy taste.

I don't know what that instant vanilla pudding does to these exactly, but whatever it is, it's wonderful. These turn out soft, yet aren't cakey.

If you want a round, soft, cake-like cookie, this is THE recipe for it!  Absolutely wonderful!!  I added a bit more salt for the heck of it, but it probably doesn't need it.

This is an easy recipe and has great results.  I have never had good luck with chocolate chip cookies, but this one works great for me.  I'm interested to try the recipe with different flavors of pudding, possibly white chocolate or butterscotch!

Moist chocolate chip cookies.  Cake like not like video.  However, am I reading right?  you DO NOT bake these at 350?  these are to be baked at 375?  does that make it a bit darker cookie than lighter??

I love these cookies!  I read the reviews and opted to melt the butter completely, leave out a 1 tbsp of pudding and add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla (I substitute our homemade maple syrup for vanilla)  and these were crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle..so good I had to put them up quick from the hubby so there would be some for tomorrow!! Will be keeping this recipe!

Love them- I was wondering how they would come out; oven 1 month new and still learning with it.  I followed recipe exact- except on my  last sheet I made slightly bigger (heaping teaspoon)  but unfortunately forget to set timer. I’m sure they’ll be fine since they are bigger and need a bit more time in the oven.  Will see what the family says, but I’ll make these again for me at least. Interested in experimenting with other flavors  as others have mentioned. Thanks for sharing this.

My family loves this recipe! I didn't change a thing in terms of the ingredients for the dough. I did, however, change different kinds of chips; chocolate, espresso, mint/chocolate. They all taste amazing with the dough!!

These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written many times. Then one day I realized I was short on semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used one cup of semi-sweet chips and one cup of milk chocolate chips. They turned out amazing! The milk chocolate nicely balances the bitterness of the semi-sweet chips. Now my family insists I make them this way every time!

I made these cookies following  Nilda Maria Williams. You melt the butter, add 2 + Tbsp milk leave out about a Tbsp of pudding  add an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. They turned out perfectly. So moist and fluffy. I baked these on parchment paper.  I also measured the flour out by spooning the flour into the measuring the flour into the measuring cup so it's not so packed, and you get the right. Measurement of flour. I'm definitely making these again!!!

It was a pretty good cookie. Delicious, but not revolutionary. Although the taste of the pudding mix is a little strong for my taste (maybe next time I'll try a different brand?) they've got a fantastic texture. I'll probably make them again.

I have made these fir years I love this recipe though recently have learned I have Celiac.  I substituted Pilsbury all purpose blend flour and didn’t use quite all the flour it called for but just about.  These were really good!  It’s not exactly the same coming from someone who’s used this recipe for years but very good. My hubby and kids ate them with me and asked for seconds:). Hope this helps someone else:)-oh also I let the dough sit for about 20 minutes before balling it and baking as I have read that on other sites.

Taste more like  biscuit than cookie. To thick not chewy like cookie . Maybe because to much dry ingredients.

this is THEE ONLY choc. chip cookie recipe I ever use. I don't add or vary anything. It's great as it is. who doesn't like a soft choc chip cookie? these do stay soft very long (add bread pieces in a bag with them to keep soft if they become harder)
side note - How could some reviewers ONLY give it 4 stars but they said it was very good??? huh?? What would the cookie have to do for them? chew and digest? just saying

I made the cookies with chocolate pudding. The grandchildren loved them, and they were chocolaty, but they were cake-like and not cookie-like. Not what I had hoped for in a chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Delicious! I’ve been searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are it! These cookies are perfectly moist and chewy. I doubled the vanilla to enhance the flavoring and added a mix of semi sweet chips as well as m&ms. A touch of sea salt on top is also an excellent compliment to these sweet cookies.

So amazing! I accidentally bought cheesecake flavored pudding mix once and loved the change so much I still use that. I also use peanut m&m’s instead of chocolate chips (and use them generously so the cookies are like 40% m&m). I call them my Proposal Cookies since I’ve gotten 3 from strangers who’ve eaten them :-)

This is the first time I have ever attempted to bake chocolate chip cookies without using a pre-made mix, and WOW!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were absolutely perfect!  Thanks so much for sharing such a yummy recipe.  Will definitely make these again!

And with the dough being so stiff, I get a nice upper body work out every time I make them.

Adding the Vanilla pudding mix definitely adds more flavor to the cookies. I also added a little salt since most other recipes call for it. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Do not expect this cookie dough to melt into flat discs like the greasy break-apart kind.   Yes, they are thicker and cake-like and they are also NOT rock-hard when they cool.

My mother always uses Vanilla Pudding in Cookies, Cakes etc. it adds a little somthing extra to it!
so when I seen this recipe I had to try it out. Unforuntually I did not follow it to exact. As I like an even ratio of Brown Sugar to White Sugar. I also used tapioca pudding instead of vanilla (as that is all I had in the pantry) also did not add whole packet of pudding only half. I did add 1/2 TSP of salt to make them fluffy. (my family enjoys cake like cookies) 
As for the baking I use 350 degrees not the recommended

Bland and too sweet with no savory anywhere to be found. Need salt! Definitely not that great. I followed the recipe to a T and they aren't anything special. The texture is soft which I like but the taste needs work! I would add 1/2 teaspoon of salt next time and take out at least 1 1/2Tbsp of the vanilla pudding mix. The best part about chocolate chip cookies is their complex flavor. These miss the mark.

LOVE these! Taste and consistency turned out wonderful! Baking them for 10 minutes is perfect (as others recommended), but I subtracted a star for how hard it was to work with the batter. I have RA and this was pretty difficult for me to make. We did however love how they taste! I also loved that they don't spread a bunch on the pan to make them run into each other... you can also get a lot more on one cookie sheet than the traditional recipe! I made measurements for a 1-1/2 batch of this recipe. I accidentally added just a smidge more flour than I was supposed to, but I doubt it would make it that hard to work with (it was supposed to be 3-1/3 cups of flour and I read it as 3-1/2 cups by mistake). I ended up adding an extra egg, a few splashes of milk, and a few extra splashes of vanilla just to be able to stir it... but I finally gave up and mix it with my hands. This recipe is pretty forgiving, unlike most when you alter the ingredients. I'm wondering if a little more butter, or melting the butter would have helped. Maybe my butter wasn't soft enough? I'm not a pro at baking by any means, so I don't have a good recommendation on how to make it easier to work with. I'm going to try it again with almost melted butter and see if I get a better result. But these cookies really are awesome! I just hope I find a happy medium to get the batter easier to work with. I would make these again and again... as long as I can get the batter easier to work with.

So good!!  The best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found yet - although I did substitute 1 cup of Crisco shortening, one bag milk chocolate chips, and added 1/2 tsp salt.   Baked for 8 min at 350 degrees.  I got about 40 cookies out of this batch.  Thank you!  note to self: next time, chill the dough overnight, and add 2 teaspoons cornstarch.

I made these delicious cookies and substituted milk chocolate chips for semi sweet and accidentally used cook and serve pudding instead of instant and everybody asked for the recipe! I've tried several chocolate chip recipes and I never seem to get that certain flavor; some are not flavorful enough or cook to soft or crunchy, not these. They had a slight crunch on the outside to hold its shape when you pack them in a dish and they don't stick together and soft on the inside with tons of flavor. I was beginning to dislike chocolate chip cookies but this recipe renewed my love!!! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was great. Every time I've tried to make chocolate chip cookies, they were flat. This recipe makes cookies that are soft and fluffy on the top, crisp and chewy on the bottom. I only had a 2 ounce package of pudding mix, but these cookies were still the best! I can't wait to try this again with some chopped nuts.

These are a little thicker than the picture. I used tablespoon sized scoops. Then I used the back of the spoon to spread the batter into a cookie shape. This helped the cookies turn out evenly. I think they taste great!

Made these & were cakey good.    Next time (soon) I will add a good pinch of salt, place on Light cookie sheet & refrigerate for a bit, UNDERBAKE & rest to let set up; light golden.  My husband is a traditionalist  but when I make I'll do this again with tweeks.

Best chocolate chip cookies EVER! I've thrown out all the other recipes I've collected for chocolate chip!  I always get raves and they're always eaten all gone every time I've made them. Afer making these more times then I can count, I've changed just a couple things. First, I only use 2 cups of flours and second, I use 1 cup of semi chocolate chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. For some reason this seems to make them even better. Love love love!!!

I used French vanilla pudding mix instead, and threw in some white chocolate chip cookies as well. To make it more aesthetically pleasing, I pushed in some chocolate chip cookies after the mixture too. Another tip: instead of dropping them as rounded, I rolled them into a ball with the palms of my hand and then pushed down on them a little ]

These were good.  The pudding addition adds an interesting level of chalkiness.  It's not overwhelming but it's noticeable.  Especially when paired against my typical Toll House version.  I didn't modify from recipe but recommend considering a way to overcome the chalkiness.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written using a tabletop mixer and they came out perfectly!  Absolutely delicious!   I have no suggestions to change the original recipe...  HOWEVER I do have additional information... I wanted to make this recipe again yesterday due to its popularity with my family, but I only had instant chocolate fudge pudding available!  I thought, what the heck, I'll try it, and they came out just as good (but obviously they were a "chocolate-chocolate chip blend cookie)!!!  The pudding is definitely the MAGIC INGREDIENT!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made these 2x with different results using the same ingredients but different chocolates. The 1st time was amazing and came out puffy and a soft chewy texture. The 2nd time was flatter, still delicious but not the same as the 1st one. I am going to redo the recipe and try figuring it out. Super good. I did chocolate pudding with mini chocolate chips the 1st time. The 2nd was a double batch with one vanilla pudding and Andes chips, chocolate pudding and Andes chips.

I love these cookies soft and fluffy their our family's favorite. When fully mixed the cookie dough appears dry more so then other recipes I've tried so its doesn't stick together very well when spooning dough out its "brittle" this however seems not to matter on the end results, I have added a small amount of milk to make them more sticky and less "brittle" dry/crumbly while spooning out un cooked dough. I don't know if every one's else is like this or just mine I still love these cookies!

I have made this recipe too many times... ask my friends... the all have cookies!!! I have tried several different flavors of pudding and each one definitely worth it!  Really if you like a certain flavor... Lemon... chocolate... cheesecake... pistachio (maybe... haven't tried that one...). These cookies can literally sit on the counter for days (if they last that long) and not get hard or icky at all... Love this recipe!

Ok, so you can substitute almost any pudding and/or chips.  My favourite combination is lemon pudding and white chocolate chips.  Mint chips and chocolate pudding is also great. So many possibilities. Everyone loves this recipe so much.  I've been making it for 11 years.

AMAZING!!!  Love these things.  I added a little bit of salt and used Mexican vanilla (about 2 teaspoons).  I also used chocolate chip and butterscotch chips.  Added a little extra chips.  I have always found when making these that you should roll dough into individual balls and place on a parchment paper lined sheet and stick in the freezer for at least an hr or two before cooking them.  Enjoy.  Anyone who doesn't enjoy this recipe clearly doesn't like chocolate chip cookies.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. I took a batch to work and they were gone with 2 hours. Everyone commented on how good they were. They stay soft even after a few days.

I have been making these cookies for years. They're always a hit-- moist, cakey and delicious. As others have noted, these cookies tend to be thicker and more cake-like than other recipes.

Best chocolate chip cookie recipe! They keep their shape unlike most other recipes which I attribute to the vanilla pudding.  Using butter gives them a rich flavor. Stop reading reviews and make this recipe - it won't let you down!

Turned out perfect! I made theses exactly the way it said to, but I always use mini-chocolate chips (more chocolate in each bite).  It's a keeper.

Tasted like a fairly basic chocolate chip cookie, not bad. Seemed to be missing something, maybe a touch of salt? I will probably try a different recipe in the future.

Well, I changed a few things just because. I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup salted sweet cream butter instead of all butter. I used white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips, about a cup of each (I didn't measure exactly). I plopped them down on my pan and sprinkled a little bit of coarse salt like sea salt over each cookie. 8 minutes in the convection oven and they came out amazing. My son said ,"I never fell in love with a cookie before." I fell in love today too!

WOW!!! Is all I can say. I enjoy cooking and love baking. I have been scared of baking chocolate chip cookies for years now. This is an amazing recipe. I did use 1/2 cup of shortening instead a full cup of butter... so half butter amd half shortening.

LOVE this recipe! One thing I like about it is that it is easy to modify. For example, use chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla, substitute white chocolate chips for semi-sweet chocolate chips, and add 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder. Boom. Double chocolate chip cookies. Also, if you find the dough is too dry, add a little bit of milk.

Amazing recipe, I used the cheesecake instant pudding and added a half teaspoon of salt. The family ate them up!

Definitely a winner. Soft and moist. I've made this cookie as is with chocolate chips but I also use it as a base recipe and let my kiddo choose what kind of cookie it becomes. My favorite I think was when she picked mini m&ms.

The best chocolate chip cookies.  No one will ever figure out your secret ingredient (pudding). Try  making them with semi-sweet chocolate CHUNKS- 3/4 bag.  The boys love them!  I bake them for 9 mins and hand mix the ingredients.

I loved this basic simple recipe.  I make mine with chocolate pudding.  I also used 1-1/4 cup flour + 1 cup oatmeal instead of 2-1/4 cups of flour.

Other than that, this recipe was amazing - very fluffy, chewy, sweet but not sickening, and yummy!

One of the best recipes I've tried for chocolate chip cookies.  The pudding gives it a real moist texture.  Smiles all around.  Will definitely use this one again!

The most perfect, soft, chewy, tasty cookies I've ever baked!! And I can't bake!! Kid tested and overwhelmingly approved! For made from scratch cookies these have a serious amount of flavor... I didn't change anything other than adding a splash of coffee (grandmothers trick) literally nothing to even notice. Love this recipe!!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and add instant cheesecake flavored pudding to this instead of the vanilla.  Making sure you beat the butter and sugars until they get really fluffy is super important too to keep the texture right for us.  Everyone just raves about these and I make them at least once a month to get our "fix" of them.

Fantastic cookie recipe! I also appreciate the flexibility given the fact that you can use so many different flavors of instant pudding mix to fancy up the flavor. 

I have tried Oreo Pudding Mix and it was quite amazing. :P

Incidentally, I have followed other reviewers suggestions and added a tablespoon of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. It was a great success!

Love this recipe and so does everyone else! The PERFECT chocolate chip cookie. To make my recipe "healthier" I used 60% cacao chips and whole wheat flour. Give it a shot! You won't be disappointed. Super easy and yummy!

Yum! 
I had to alter the recipe slightly because of what I had on hand. Used 1/2 coconut oil, 1/2 salted butter, and then 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all purpose. 
They were great!

Beautiful! These cookies are magazine worthy. I followed the recipe exactly but refrigerated them for a few hours before baking. Normally I am only interested in the dough, but the cookies were soft and chewy with a perfect consistency. The only thing I can say is that I would add a bit more vanilla, or a tablespoon of Kahlua next time for a richer flavor. Otherwise, this is my new recipe! Thank you :)

Ya, .... not terribly happy with how these turned out. My husband looked at me when I said I was using a recipe, and quickly responded, "Just use the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip package. Well.... I should have listened to him. I read a few of the reviews about this cookie recipe before starting it, and I thought they sounded good. . Going to loose this recipe and stick to the chip bag for now. 
Not happy having wasted my time,
;(

Well I wanted to try a different CCC recipe and I did, and I will never again. They were more like mini cakes rather than cookies, too fluffy for my taste. I knew something was off when the dough was really flaky and it called for 2 cups (whole bag) of chocolate chips. great if you like chocolate chip cookie cakes but not so great if you like cookies.

Love the consistency of these cookies! I was nervous with how thick the dough was, but found it makes for a nice soft center and light crispy outside. I used chocolate pudding and dark chocolate chips which was delicious!

This is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use. My adult children request these whenever they come home. I started using chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla and the cookies have a rich, chocolate flavor. I also form my cookies with a Pampered Chef, 2 TBS cookie scoop by placing one scoop on top of the other. Next, I press down a little bit with my palm and bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. The cookies are big and cake-like; they are not gooey. If you want more moisture, I suggest adding additional chips and using a little less flour.

My husband and children really like this one.  I like mine cake-like, so not my cup of tea.  This is the new recipe in my house... I am out voted. Lol. It is a good recipe if you like flat, chewy middle and crispy edges.  I had to add a bit of heavy whipping cream to make it more creamy in order to add the choc chips.

Made this recipe for my family and they loved it.  I read the reviews and did 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter and it turned out delicious.  Perfect for a holiday recipes and also made for kids that can't have cookies with nuts.

I can't say the taste is superior to what we all know as the Toll House, but there IS something that takes this cookie above others. The texture is exactly what I want...crisp on the edges, bottom & top crust yet tender, moist & melt in your mouth in the middle. I did add 1/4 tsp salt to recipe and flattened the cookie dough SLIGHTLY but other than that followed it to the letter. I halved the recipe "just in case" but moving forward - it has replaced all preceding chocolate chip cookie recipes I have. YUM!

The family would always say how good our daughters chocolate chip cookies were.  I love to cook but am horrible at baking.  I just made this recipe and they are incredible.  My daughter even said these are better than her chocolate chip cookies.  Even my wife who is my biggest critic says they are great.  The only change I made was I only added ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar.  I also added 1 tablespoon if vanilla extract.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Super easy, and the cookies were still moist and chewy even two days after. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the T and they were wonderful. The second time I made them I put 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup peanut butter chips and they were just as deadly! I love this recipe and so does my family!

These cookies are GOOD -- darn good. I've tried a couple of other chocolate chip recipes that were underwhelming, but this one is PERFECT. Crispy outside and moist, soft inside. The cookies puff up in place instead of spreading, so the result is a delicious, perfectly shaped cookie. This is now my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies! Thanks! :)

I have been looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I like for years!  This is finally the one!  I did use the suggestion from another person to use cheesecake flavored pudding mix instead of vanilla, and I'm in love!  I will always bake these from now on.  Thank you for the secret ingredient!!!

I've made this recipe many times as is, and it turns out wonderful.  I've also made it with applesauce instead of butter and splenda instead of sugar to make it healthier--these turn out more cake-like, but still have a good flavor.  I have also used chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla.

I just made these today after my mom and uncle recommended them.  I switched out 1/2 butter for shortening (It will help the cookie not spread and not be so crispy it's how I always make my cookies) and added 1/4t salt because salt should be added to sweet desserts (not to  mention all other cookie recipes have it!).  Personally I am dairy free so I diidn't even try them but my kids love them.  It's a nice switch up from the usual chocolate chip cookies I make, well I guess, but again, I didn't try any.

I followed this recipe exactly with Jello brand vanilla pudding mix and the texture is very good, but the cookies are far too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth!) -- I think this is because the pudding mix is mainly sugar and cornstarch. I would follow this recipe again, but with 1/2 the sugar and maybe some cornstarch instead of the pudding mix.

It ried this recipe with a few changes and they were YUMMY! Not too sweet and simple to make. I used a good tablespoon of creamy peanut butter melted in replace of the pudding but everything was the same. I agree with one commenter...you need to pull them out of the oven when they have just a line of brown on the edges. Especially if you want chewy soft cookies. A tad longer (without burning the bottoms)for crispy cookies.

Just baked these for the first time, and I think they are pretty darn good. Even after I made the mistake of melting my butter when trying to soften it up for creaming. lol
I didn't have vanilla pudding mix, so I used pistachio pudding mix instead. Added extra vanilla extract and a tiny bit of almond extract as well. And i added a dash of salt. 
Cant wait to try different variations of pudding mix and chocolate chips!!! This recipe has been added to my recipe box!!!


Edit: I tried these with lemon pudding and white chocolate chips... FANTASTIC!!!! my nieces demanded I make them a batch!

I have been looking for a great Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe for years and I can now stop.  This cookie is fabulous!  I added about a 1/2 tsp salt and a little more flour.  The cookies were thick and tasted like pillows of heaven.  Tollhouse who?

The reviews of this cookie are very accurate. The cookies are more dry and more cakey than I would have liked, but if I'd read all of the reviews first, I would have known that. For the type of cookie it is (again, according to the reviews), they came out perfectly.

I used chocolate pudding mix and only had half a bag of mini chocolate chips but it was the perfect amount.  I also had some marshmallows I wanted to use up so after 10 minutes in the oven I put half a large marshmallow on top of each cookie and put them back in the oven for another 2 minutes.  After the marshmallows softened I pushed them down so that it would spread across the cookie.  These are DELICIOUS--especially while the marshmallow is still warm and gooey!!  I have been trying a lot of different recipes trying to find one that reminds me of hot chocolate and this is it.  These cookies have now found a permament rotation in my cookie collection.

We made this recipe and loved them!  I used a one ounce cookie scoop to make the cookies.  It made 3 dozen cookies at this size, which baking at 10 minutes was sufficient time.  The insides were soft and the outside crispy.  Very delicious and we will be using this as out new chocolate chip cookie recipe!

These are the best cookies I have ever made.  They rose wonderfully and taste so good.  I used margarine and will try butter flavored Crisco next time.

I am not sure what I did wrong. The flavor is super yummy, but they do not look like puffy pillows like they do in your picture. I even bought brand new baking soda because I read that helps them to be puffy. :-(

I can't find my button for 10 STARS!!!!  This recipe has been used over and over again.  Everyone who I make them for LOVES them!  This is the ONLY recipe I use now for choc chip cookies.  They always always come out perfect.  The ones on the back of the bags it was always hit or miss.  When I tell my husband or brother that I'm making Christmas cookies they always ask "choc chip ones 2"!!!!  (I always have boxes of instant pudding on hand just for the cookies!)

Fantastic recipe!  I didn't have vanilla so we used banana cream pudding and it tasted like a yummy chocolate chip banana bread cookie!  I see endless variations for this recipe with peanut butter, nuts, butterscotch chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is a great recipe. My kids really love soft chewy cookies and these deliver. I use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, I think the vanilla is a little overpowering.  For a change,  I used chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips, fantastic!

But I really like that the cookies were very moist ( maybe a little bit too moist... ) But in an overall rating they were good! :) Thanks for the recipe! :D

I like to double the batch (except for the pudding mix) add 1 T crisco to prevent spreading, add 1 cup of blended oats and 4 oz milk chocolate shavings.  I then freeze pre-scooped dough balls and put them into zipper bags.  We have a dozen fresh baked cookies any time  we want!

Very tasty, they are similar in consistency/texture to chocolate chip cake. They are cakey. If you want a chewy, thick cookie, this is NOT what you are looking for. I like it, but it is not my go to recipe.

I like that this recipe hold its shape and does not flatten.  I love the soft consistency and if you make them, you will find that you go back for more and more.  Next time I will use cheesecake pudding and white chocolate chips with macadamia nuts.  One of my top chocolate chip recipe--thank you so much for sharing. ( I added 1/4tsp of salt and 1/2tsp more vanilla extract)

This is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've made. They are a soft and moist cookie that holds it's shape. I usually make these without changing anything however changing the pudding flavor gives this recipe endless possibilites.

I made an error and used milk chocolate chips on accident. I strongly advise against this. The cookies were too sweet. We loved how soft they were but could hardly finish them because they were just too sweet. I will update my review when I get a chance to make the recipe with the correct ingredients.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe especially since it has so many great reviews. I didn't change anything and my cookies turned out hard and crunchy and there didn't seem to be any distinct difference in taste using the pudding. Thanks, however I'll continue my search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I loved this recipe! My father-in-law can't handle all of the butter, so I reduced the butter by half. To compensate for the moisture, I substituted the brown sugar with Dr. Pepper which worked great and cut some calories. I used a tiny bit extra vanilla as well as some peanut butter chunks in half the batch. they were a big hit for a picky bunch! Very fluffy, very moist, very tasty!

awesome!!!   i added some salt and cut back a little on the baking soda, and a little extra vanilla x i also  used mini chocolate chips and  will be making another batch  adding walnuts.  i also made a double batch and mixed one box vanilla and one box cheese cake flavored pudding mix, the result..... YUMMY!  and my cookies look just like the picture, beautiful!   crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside :) ! i hope i make it to the christmas party with some left! my family can't  keep away from them!  oh, i  shaped the cookies on the cookie sheet before baking them.   thanx so much for sharing!

These were practically disappearing before I could get the next batch out of the oven!!! Very yummy.  I really wish I could get my hands on the cheesecake flavoured pudding others have mentioned but I'm guessing they don't sell it in Canada :(

The BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. Not crisp AT ALL. Not really chewy. Just thick, and soft, and perfect. I made EXACTLY as recipe reads. =) Thank you for a great recipe.

Great raw cookie dough with a nice vanilla flavor and just the right amount of sugar (not overpowering).  However, they didn't change shape (spread at all) on the baking sheet.  My son called them "cookie balls".  I thought I followed the recipe closely, so I don't know what happened.  They baked fine to a cakey consistency inside but I won't make them again.

These are as billed: soft and cake-y.  I prefer a crunchier cookie but I understood what I was getting into when I made these for a change-of-pace.  The missing star is from the artificial-like aftertaste.  My husband thought I had used Splenda (I did not) but had no problem eating them anyway. I'll go back to Tollhouse, but if you want thick and cake-like, try this recipe.

Very delicious. The only change I made to the recipe was extra time. I kept the ingredients the same but made them about 1 tablespoon each and made approx 30. they took about 15 minutes to cook, but were delicious and cakey. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 was that they tasted a bit floury.

I was really intrigued by this recipe, had never heard of pudding in a cookie batter....but I was very disappointed with the outcome.  The batter wasn't thick at all, and the cookies turned out super flat!  Weird texture, weird flavor..all in all not a fan.  If i could get them to turn out like the photos, I can believe they must be good, but probably wont try again.

i love these cookies. they are so good. the only thing is that the recipe makes A LOT of cookies. for me i was able to make over 65 cookies and they were a decent size. and the batter was more liquid. somewhat like a cake batter would be. but the cookies still turned out amazing!

I don't know what the deal is...I have made these cookies several times, and every single time, they come out totally flat. I bake constantly and I know how to make cookies, and I don't have this problem with any other recipe. I made them once with less pudding mix and they weren't as flat, but everyone else seems to get it right, so I don't know why they don't work. If nothing else, the taste is good.

I made these cookies for a Marines coming home BBQ and as soon as I set them down within about 5 minutes they were gone and everyone wanted to know my secret! The pudding mix is the perfect touch to cookies.

My family is picky when it comes to chocolate chip cookies and I'm currently baking my second batch in two days! Really loved the different texture- more cake like. My husband says they taste like chips a hoy

I tweaked this recipe a little bit, using powdered sugar instead of white, and I used chili chocolate chunks.  I just made these cookies today and they are easily the best I've tasted.  The dough doesn't spread out very much and the overall texture is really nice.  I also like that the cookies themselves aren't overly sweet, making an awesome background for the chocolate. I'm writing a blog entry about my experience with this recipe.  I won't link it on the comment, since I don't want to seem spammy or anything, but I can send a link to anyone if theyre interested.  TL;DR version: These cookies are freakin' awesome.

I was a little nervous about making this recipe since I always use the "Back of the bag" recipe.  I was very happy with the outcome.  My husband said they are fantastic. They have a nice rich flavor.  I did add nuts. I will definitely make these again. I'll  try it with different flavors of pudding. Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe.

A prefect cookie!  The pudding makes them moist, chewy, and just enough chocolate chips!  Would give this recipe 10 stars

Best chocolate chip cookies I have EVER made.  I love that they puff up and don't spread thin like so many other recipes.  They are more cake like and the best.

These cookies are delicious. I also made these for the fourth of july and now everyone wants them! In my opinion, the vanilla pudding makes the cookies softer, and makes them stay soft longer! These are great! I highly recommend them to any and all families!

These make the best chocolate chip cookies ever. Everyone that tries them either wants the recipe or wants me to make a batch for them. the pudding added into the mixture really makes these cookies stand out from all the rest that I've tried.

These turned out very good. I would sift the flour before adding to make sure they are more cake-like, if that's what you're looking for.

This recipe is one of the best I've found online. Next time I make them, I'll use 1 tsp of salt and possibly just a little less of the vanilla pudding mix only because the cookies are VERY sweet. Still great though!

Very delicious! Even better if you use golden brown sugar and not dark brown sugar. Have made both ways. I used a pinch bit less baking soda and flour. Turned out perfect!

Excellent!  Very easy...and most of the ingredients are ones I have available on a daily basis.  Didn't have brown sugar this time...so I just used all white sugar...but they still came out great!  The vanilla and the vanilla pudding mix add a nice, richer flavor to the cookie.  Yum!  :D

I'll never use another chocolate chip cookie recipe. These are AMAZING! Everybody loves them and asks me for them ALL the time. They are great because you can mix it up a little bit with different pudding mixes. I've tried them with Coconut cream pudding, french vanilla and Vanilla. They all turned out fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe!

I found these cookies a little sweet, so I remade them, but in the second batch I left out the white sugar, replaced the semi-sweet chocolate chips with milk chocolate chips and added 1 cup of crushed almonds. My family and I enjoyed the second batch much more!

My twelve year old daughter found this last week and she's made it twice since.  She's also keeping the pudding as her secret ingredient. LOL This last time we used white chocolate chips and mint chocolate pudding. This is a fun one that can be changed up to what you have on hand in the pantry.  Great Cookies!!! Thanks!

Well such a story I have for you all to hear. =3 I decided to try to make these cookies but of course I didn't have any pudding.. Why do we need the pudding anyway? (I couldn't find it online.)  So anyway, I figured it was for creaminess; I looked in and found peanut butter so instead of the pudding I replaced it with a half a cup of that. Did everything else as it was written but baked them for 8 mins instead of 10-12..   They are actually pretty good. The only reason why I'm rating it a 4 is because I don't know what they really taste like with the pudding but other than that. I really like this one, even the dough is pretty good by itself. =^-^=   Thank you!

The best cookie EVER! I am a terrible, impatient cook, but these came out perfect. I used Smart balance 50/50 butter blend melted (by accident). I also forgot the vanilla extract. I used m&ms instead of chocolate chips (it's what I had on hand). These were crisp on the outside and soft (but cooked) on the inside.  I would give more stars if I could:)

WOW! Fantastic cookies, they came out MARVELOUS! I only changed the recipe by doing half butter, half shortening (instead of all butter). The cookies did not spread at all, made em nice and plump, and super soft. Thanks for this great recipe!! :)

I bake cookies all the time and was intrigued by the recipe addition of pudding. Used the butterscotch and put milk and semisweet chocolate chips in the mix. Baked the twelve minutes at the recommended temp., they were a little cakey, no prob. but a tad dry. Did put in additional vanilla as someone suggested, not much flavor! Will let remainder of dough "season" in fridge and bake rest of batch later. May try again with other suggested combos. Not at the top of my cookie recipe file.

I have made HUNDREDS of versions of chocolate chip cookies and so far these are pretty near the top. For different variations of cookies, I have used different pudding mix and different chocolate chips and they have all turned out splendidly. My favorite variations uses white chocolate pudding mix and one cup of milk chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/4 macadamia nuts. They were sensational and I still have people asking for the recipe (which I never give out :))

fantastic! As I live in the UK - I used two 49g pkgs of Sainsburys Vanilla supreme dessert mix (like Angel Delight). I also chilled my dough for about an hour, and lined my baking sheets with foil (which works a treat every time). I had to turn my oven down to about 160C and I rolled the dough into little balls before placing on the trays as I find this keeps them unform and stops the dough spreading when baking. This is a great recipe. they taste great and they look great. thankyou very much.

These are OK. They don't have much flavor and are too cake like for me. Could be sweeter. I'll keep looking for that perfect recipe.

For years my chocolate chip cookies have turned out flat and crispy.  I tried this recipe and will never go back to my old one.  They are chewy and delicious.  The only thing I did was add 1/4 tsp salt.  I can't actually taste the pudding but it makes the texture of the cookie perfect.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the cookies turned our perfectly, and I am not an expert cookie maker!  Warning:  this recipe makes ALOT...much more than the two dozen it says it makes.  My daughter and I made two batches and we came up with 106 cookies...and they were not teeny tiny ones either!  Thank you Pam for this recipe...it's a keeper for sure!

It is very important that you do not overcook these!  One sheet I had perfect at 10mins.  The rest somehow were in 11-12mins and were too browned and were much harder/crunchier. Unless you enjoy dunking your cookies in coffee or milk, then longer cooking is for you.  I'm going to have to make these again and try 9-10mins and see how they turn out.  My Mom loved them, and they did have that cakey taste, but it was yummy.

Very good recipe! I did some adjusting and added the 2 tbs of milk, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tbs of vanilla instead of tsp, and a little less than a box of pudding like another poster had said. After 11 min. they come out chewy, cake-like, and have a wonderful flavor. Can't wait to try different flavor combos!

Baked these cookies for a fellow teacher's birthday @ school and they disappeared quickly!  Have made them in the past for my family and they loved them, also.  If you're not a real fan of "flat" chocolate chip cookies, these are the cookies for you!  Taking them to a party tonight along with extra copies of the recipe!

These cookies stayed moist for a ridiculous amount of time. Almost a week they were perfect without any signs of drying out. Would be great for a bake sale. Going to try with chocolate pudding tonight...

These were good cookies!  Mine came out nice and soft while retaining a good chew around the edges.  While they were a bit sweet, I used darker chocolate that I cut into bigger chunks and that offset the sweetness well.  I will use this recipe again.

Doesn't spread which is great, but is WAY too sweet. I would try 1/2 pkg of vanilla pudding mix, and only 1 C of choc chips, or maybe 1/4 of the brown sugar and only 1 C of choc chips.  There were lots of leftover choc chips, that got wasted.  I was excited to try this recipe, but was amazed how sweet it tasted.  Other than that, its a really nice recipe!

Very good, I used the cheesecake pudding as suggested and they turned out well.  I had a bit of trouble getting the bottoms not to burn, but that's my own inexperience I'm sure.  Only part I didn't love was a touch of an odd after taste.

These were the best chocolate chip cookies ive ever made!!! They stay big and chewy unlike other recipes ive used where the cookies flatten and if you dont eat them the day of, they get too hard! My boyfriend and I decided to make these into ice cream sandwiches and they were perfect! Only problem i had was these cookies only lasted about an hour, my boyfriend and mom chowed them down before i could bag some for later! :-) I will most definitely be using this recipe all the time!

Surprisingly, the cookies work great w/o salt added. They get a little crispy along the edges, but that's perfect! The vanilla pudding makes only a minor aftertaste, which compliments the sugary flavor of the cookies!

i am new at baking my own cookies. didn't have vanilla so i used chocolate pudding instead. didn't have white sugar, used just 3/4 c brown. i was afraid it would be too sweet. it's not a flat cookie. it turned out crunchy on the outside and moist and cake-like inside and not too sweet just enough. it was delicious. although i didn't get 4 doz though like the recipe said. i'll definitely try this recipe again.

I liked that the cookies were crispy on the outside, chewy in the inside but these had a more cake-like texture and I like my cookies to be more dense.  They were quick and easy to make but I think I will stick with my old chocolate chip cookie recipe.

These are the best chewy chocolate chip cookies ever.  We followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out perfect, I wouldn't change a thing!

Good cookies but a little cakey.  I like my cookies a little denser.

These cookies were pretty good but agreed that they were very cakey. Easy to make but next time I think I will add salt and not as much pudding mix.

DELISH! I followed this recipe as written and am very pleased with the outcome.  A very moist, yet slightly crispy cookie.  I used milk chocolate/white chocolate swirl chips.  YUM!!

Fantastic recipe. If I didn't freeze these my husband & I would have eaten the whole batch. I didn't want to use up all my butter, so I used a 1/2c of butter and 1/2c of Tenderflake shortening. I also used 3/4c Reese Chipits & 1/4c chocolate chipits (it's all I had left). You definitely need to use a mixer. It made an excellent soft cookie. My husband and I actually ate a few of them frozen last night.

so versatile with different pudding mixes, and always moist! I tried pistachio pudding with toffee bits and it was great!  I used vanilla pudding and put oats in place of 1/2 the flour, also so good.   I am going to make chocolate with peanut butter chips today.  LOVE IT!

These were the best cookies I have ever made.  I only used 3/4s the package of pudding mix, and added a little salt.  I also used a mixer to make sure the dough was nice and creamy.  These were a huge hit, and are my new chocolate cookie recipe!

I'm sorry, but I did not care for these cookies at all. My husband and kids thought they were pretty bad too. We made this recipe twice thinking maybe I missed something, or did it wrong. Nope it was the recipe. I think maybe the pudding had a lot to do with the flavor.

This is close to the recipe I lost in a house fire years ago.  I remember my recipe used 3/4 white and 3/4 brn sugar.  I know that butter flavored shortening also works well.  I made those changes and it appears to be the recipe I have been looking for.  Glad to have my favorite cookie recipe back.  Thanks for helping me remember the one I lost in my fire.

They were okay... Definitely better the next day!

The good thing is that I can make a tray and put the rest of the dough away for a later time.  

I also add in cinnamon and nutmeg... and WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS (with the semi-sweet chips in there as well)!

The only way to make choco chip cookies. Just excellent.  I added 1/4 teas of salt - not sure if it was needed.  Used instant white chocolate pudding mix.  Very good.

Great cookies. I use half milk chocalate chip and half semi sweet. I also added heath bar crumbles on top of cookies before I added them in the oven.

This recipe is AWESOME! I made it exactly how the recipe said. I thought something was going to be wrong cause when I was stirring it it looked a little runny. I was anxious to see how they would come out and they came out GREAT! My dad made me make another batch because he loved them so much! They were gone with in an hour of making them. I made mine with chocolate pudding and chocolate chips. I am going to be making another batch with vanilla pudding and Ghiradelhi chocolate chips. I am making these for my family for Christmas. If I could give this recipe more stars I would give it a thousand and one for how yummy these are! Like other people said mix it up! That's the  best advice!

These turned out really good. The only variation that I made was to add nuts and mixed chocolate chips: toasted pecans bits - about 1 cup of those and a mixture of chips that I had in the freezer - milk, semi sweet, and mini semi sweet. The cookies cooked nicely and turned out fine. The consistency of the cookie is very tender and not chewy. I had no problems with the texture or taste. My husband said they were a bit sweet but he enjoyed them and said they were good, too. They were easy to make and tasty. I will make again.

My family and I think this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe.  My husband grew up with his mom making Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chip Cookies his whole life and only liked those.  But this is his new favorite.  You might think this is weird, but I love the taste of the cookie so much, I make half of them without chocolate chips.  My oldest son and I prefer them that way.  They are awesome!!!! I sort of agreed with a review that said that it tasted sort of "instant" because of the instant pudding. So, I followed someone elses idea to use cheesecake flavored pudding and they are even better.  They don't taste "instant" anymore.  Great cookies!!!!

I made 8 dozen of these last night.  I was hoping the pudding would make them extra soft and chewy, but was disappointed in the sweet, "instant" taste that it added to the dough and didn't really find them softer than any other chocolate chip recipe I've tried.  They were just all right but nothing special.  DH wasn't a big fan.  Now I've got to find another recipe to try for my cookie exchange tomorrow night.  :)

These cookies looked gorgeous (nice and puffy) and had a nice cake-like texture. Unfortunately they tasted rather bland - and the family agrees. I tried white chocolate pudding mix and french vanilla. Also tried adding 1/2 tsp salt as suggested in other reviews. Just didn't do it for me, but I'll try experimenting with some other pudding/choco chip mixes.

Thank you...finally a recipe for chocolate chip cookies that tastes great and maintains its shape while baking(doesn't flatten out). I did use only 1 1/2 sticks of butter and used white chocolate pudding mix.

These are tasty, and they definitely grow on you.  You eat the first one and wonder what the 5 stars are about, but then you find yourself going back for a 2nd and a 3rd, etc.  However, I would still give this cookie a 4, given my experience with others.  It's a keeper, though!

My husband found this recipe here and now its the only chocolate chip cookies my family will eat! The pudding makes the cookies tender and moist. I'd say it stops them from getting hard and stale, but they never last long enough even get to that point. LOVE THESE COOKIES! 
The recipe doubles well too, and I always bring them to get-togethers.

I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts to my cookies. I've been making my cookies with pudding mix now, and was looking for a simple choc chip recipe. I will never make cookies without pudding mix in them again, it makes them so moist and soft, just the way I like!

This is the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I made it with sugar free vanilla pudding, and I added some almond extract to give it an amaretto twist.  Everyone liked them, but I think I'll try it with just vanilla extract and use the cheesecake pudding mix next time as someone else suggested.  Great texture, wonderful taste.

These cookies were amazing! I discovered I was out of vanilla extract and only had 1/2 the needed butter but they still turned out moist. The cook time was tricky, I think I may have kept them in too long because after they cooled they became more crunchy than I like, but a glass of cold milk easily solves that. I will continue experimenting with wonderful this recipe...thanks! :-D

I should have flattened them out more before baking. Thought a press of the palm would be enough but you guys aint kiddin when you say they don't flatten/spread during baking! Even substituting splenda for the white sugar, using one stick of margarine, and using medium eggs, I had zero problems with density and volume. So its a good cookie for useing substitutes. I also made a glaze and put on top, and added mini choco chips with pb chips and vanilla sugar free pudding mix. I just think next time I'd bake them longer (although the bottoms were getting pretty brown) or flatten them more.

The first day I made these I didn't like the cookie much.  But the second day they were so much better!!  These are cookies you can bake the day before and take them to a function the next day and people will rave.  They stay nice and soft and gooey.

Excellent cookies.  I am newly single and was looking for things that are easy and don't tax my "skills" too much.  They are easy to make and are exactly what I was lookng for, a chewy cookie with a bit of a crunch.  I'll make them again and maybe add some raisins next time......

Hands down the best chocolate chip recipe I've ever made! The cookies do not dry out like most do after a few days. I do add a dash of salt to the recipe and white chocolate chips to jazz it up.

I wish I hadn't added the milk like others said because my batter was incredibly sticky. I used chocolate pudding mix because that's all I had. I also cut the recipe in half. When they first came out of the oven they were DE-LISH but today the seemed sort of cakey. Which isn't necassarily a bad thing. I only used a half bag of mini chocolate chips, but next time I will add a whole lot more!!!

I was having problems with flat cookies, so  I was hunting for the perfect chocolate chip cookie.  This is it!  I did change a couple things:  1/2 c. butter flavored crisco (along with 1/2 c. smart balance to equal the 1 c. butter the recipe called for), 1.5 T vanilla extract, and 1/2 t salt.  Took them out at exactly 10 minutes and they were perfection.  My hubby took them to work and in his own words they were gone!!

I was interested to try this version of the classic chocolate chip cookie recipe because it called for vanilla pudding mix.  The cookies came out nice and thick, and had a pretty good taste to them.  I made these cookies for my husband's squadron, and they were a big hit.  I, however, prefer the recipe on the back of the nestle chocolate chip bag.

I was overjoyed to find this recipe!  My mom used to make these cookies, but I'd since lost the recipe.  When I did a search for "chocolate chip cookies" and "vanilla pudding" and found this, I knew the universe was looking out for me!

I reduce the amount of flour slightly, as I thought the cookies came out a little dry when I made them straight from the directions.  But overall, these are great cookies!  I like to change up the kind of pudding I use in them to make fudge cookies, or butterscotch pudding with butterscotch chips... it's really easy to make many different variations, and they always go quickly!

Fabulous!  If anything could be changed, the amount of chocolate chips could be cut down some.  But since I love lots of chocolate in my cookies, 2 cups was perfect!

We buy instant pudding for our 3yr old all the time but she always wants us to make the chocolate pudding and so we are left with all this instant vanilla.With this cookie recipe we were able to use up all our instant vanilla pudding.
The cookies not only taste GREAT! But very Soft.Great recipe!

Oh, these are heavenly!!!  I didn't change the recipe at all...They baked differently, however, depending on what bakeware I used it seems, (some were light and fluffy with the stoneware, and some were flat with a regular cookie sheet), and I also had some problems with the baking time (probably a mix b/n my oven temp and the bakeware I used), BTW, I can COOK up a STORM, but I'm by not means A "BAKER" :(  Besides all THAT, overall, I think this is one of the BEST Chocolate Chip recipes ever!  Thanks a bunch!  Our family loved them :)

These are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! The pudding mix helps to keep the cookies moist and thick. The last time I made these cookies I used vanilla pudding mix, but this time I used French vanilla (there is probably no difference). I doubled the recipe and I'm refrigerating the dough to save for later. Also, I haven't been able to find 3.5 oz. packages of pudding mix, so I use 3.4 oz. (and it works fine). Try experiementing with different combinations like white chocolate pudding with white chocolate chips, butterscotch pudding with semi-sweet chips, lemon pudding with white chocolate chips, etc.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I use milk chocolate chocolate chips and I add 1 cup of chopped nuts, pecans or walnuts.

I thought these were bland. I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed.  I am surprised at all the good reviews.  I won't be making these again.

These were pretty good, though mine did get a l ittle burnt.  I used half white chocolate chips and half regular, and most people thought that made them a bit more interesting than regular chocolate chip cookies.
I will try this one again!

I added 2 Tbsp milk like another reviewer said and these came out wonderful.  I tried one when they came out of the oven. I had my neighbors over last night for a Holiday Gathering and they are really enjoyed them I went to get another one to try and they were all gone.

These cookies are great.  I used sugar free vanilla pudding mix and they still turned out great.  Next time I will make them with regular pudding mix to see if I can tell a difference.  But the sugar free version I made were soft and chewy and very delicious

These were very easy to make, however I found them to be a little dry.  Maybe I did something wrong??  I was expecting a more based on the previous reviews.  Good, but not "to die for".  Thanks for the recipe.

I used salted butter, french vanilla pudding mix and a blend of milk chocolate and semi-sweet morsels.  Just the right level of sweetness.  Careful not to overbake these cookies.  They are best removed when they have a light golden brown color (mostly around the edges).  Not only do they taste good out of the oven, but they continue to have very good taste and a soft texture for days afterwards.  Children especially love their soft texture.  I made two dozen, then put the rest of the dough in a storage container in my freezer so that I can make small batches of these cookies a few at a time in my toaster oven.

I am so excited - I have finally found the PERFECT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE recipe and believe me, I've tried many!!!  I used some other "reviewers" suggestions and used the 1/4 tsp. of salt and baked them for approx. 8 minutes. And being the chocolate lover I am, I added more chocolate chips than it called for.  I got rave reviews and everyone seemed to agree that they were the best they've tasted! I can't wait for an excuse to make them again. Thank you, thank you, ........., Tammy

Very good cookies. My two brothers ate them in less than 2 days. The cookies stayed soft in the middle and crispy on the oustide! It was a very good recipe; but i have made better. The taste was kind of cakey.

Oh so good!! I am not much of a cookie-lover but I fell in love with these! I prefer milk chocolate chips to the semi-sweet. I will try white chocolate chips next time:) Also I recommend trying different flavored puddings. I tried chocolate(chocolate fudge), then in another batch I tried vanilla. Also I added a 1/4 tsp of Almond extract-yummy! Try it:):)

We loved these cookies! Chocolate chip cookies are my husband's favorite, and I wanted to make him a treat, but also try something different, so this is the recipe I went with. I used white chocolate pudding and also used milk chocolate chips for half of the chips - so I wound up with a triple chocolate cookie. I thought the flavor blend was just right. I also added a bit of salt as suggested. I baked with parchment paper on Cushionaire pans and they turned out perfectly. They stayed nice and soft for the very few days they lasted. This one is a keeper for our family - enjoyed by the kids and the adults both.

we absolutely LOVED these cookies! we have been looking for a thicker dough, that makes less buttery, cake-like cookies. this is perfect. i added a teaspoon of salt(probably could have only added 1/2 teaspoon) and an extra 1/4 cup white sugar. these will be our only cc cookies form now on.

These are great cookies! I have made them four days ago and my husband loves them. I did what others said and added 1/4 tsp salt. I also baked them on Renolds no-stick foil so they didn't stick. I didn't have a single problem. This will be my permant chocolate chip cookie!

These cookies where wonderful. They were very soft (just the way i like them), and I even made one giant cookie for my guest and he loved it! Next time, I would add a little more sugar but other than that, they were perfect.

The cookie dough was good!  When I baked them they would not come off the pan I tried greased, ungreased, and cooking less time. They do cook quickly and burn quickly.  The cookies are flat, hard on the outside and a little chewy on the in!  Not what I expected and I had to throw most of them out because I couldn't get them off my pans. 
I wish they would have worked out, but I'll keep on searching.

Excellent cookie recipe. I melted the butter as talked about in another review, and the dough was firm but oh so tender. The only thing that went "wrong" is that I had trouble removing them off of my baking stone...they were too chewy! Even though a little misshapen, they were indeed the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've tasted. I don't even really like chocolate chips. Next time I will try toffee or butterscotch along with some nuts. But this recipe is going in our file!!!

This was a good recipe but the cookies were not as moist as I would have liked.  I don't think I will make them again.

Yum!  The pudding makes for a softer and more delicious chocolate chip cookie.  Husband, who never cares what we eat, specifically requests that I make them - very high honor :)

The cookies were a hit with the kids!  I made a chocolate chip version and a butterscotch chip version.  Both were great!

This has quickly become our favorite cookie recipe!  They are crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  My family can't leave them alone!
