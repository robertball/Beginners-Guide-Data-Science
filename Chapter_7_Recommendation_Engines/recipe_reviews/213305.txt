This is pretty good. I used 3/4 cup basmati rice instead of instant and same amount of water as the recipe. I fried up the rice to give it a slight golden color then I added the water and cooked for 5 minutes uncovered before adding the veggies and chicken.I cooked it covered and on low heat for 15 minutes to get the rice cooked through .
