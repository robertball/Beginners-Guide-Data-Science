People rave about this, and it is so simple.  To help with cleanup, soak the measuring cup or bowl in very hot soapy water.  Easy!  DO NOT spread the peanut brittle--just tip the cookie sheet back and forth.  You do not want to break the "bubbles" made by the baking soda.  That is what makes it "tender."  The thinner the better, so I heat my cookie sheet in a warm oven so the candy spreads more quickly.

This is a great recipe, fast, fun, easy and delicious.  The first time I made it I followed the cooking time exactly and it burned.  Next time I cut the first cooking time to 3.5 minutes the second to 3 minutes and the last cooking time to 1 minute, and it turned out perfect.  My microwave is 1000 watts.  This has become a family favorite.

This really was delicious.  The only thing is that the baking soda needs to be stirred in very quickly.  Then the mixture needs to be poured out AS SOON AS the baking soda is stirred in.  The directions "stir until light and foamy"  are a little misleading.  It doesn't become light and foamy as you stir. . . it becomes less light and foamy.  It was hard to pour out, but ended tasting very good.

*update:  I have now made this recipe numerous times.  At first I gave it 4 stars; however, if you follow the hint I gave above, the recipe is 5 stars.  The Peanut Brittle is fantastic.  My grandmother is THE candy-maker, and my mom says that she cannot tell the difference between mine and my grandmother's (she slaves away all day on her's).  Also, this recipe is delicious topped with chocolate.  All you have to do is put a layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips (or whatever kind of chocolate you prefer) on top of the brittle as soon as you pour the mixture out onto the cookie sheet.  The chocolate will start to melt; simply spread the chocolate over the peanut brittle with a spatula.  Absolutely delish!

Definitely be careful with this recipe!  It did NOT work in my too-powerful-for-this-recipe microwave. After the first four minutes, the whole concotion was a burnt mess and was difficult to clean up.  My microwave is a Kenmore and it says 1000 watts on the label.  Since we don't know what wattage the submitter used, I'd say keep a close eye on this.  I ended up making traditional stove-top brittle once I ruined all my cashews in this one.

This recipe is awesome.  I have been reading all the reviews on microwave peanut brittle, and I took the best ideas from all of them and tried it out.  My brittle came out perfect.  I used the exacts ingredients of this recipe and then this is what I did.  I put parchment paper on my cookie sheet.    Then I microwaved (800watts) the sugar, corn syrup and salt for 4 minutes in a 4 cup glass measure.  I added the peanuts and microwaved for 3 1/2 minutes.  Then added the butter and vanilla and microwaved for 1 1/2 minutes.  I stirred in the baking soda real quick and and spread it out on the parchment paper with a spatula sprayed with Pam.  It was a perfect outcome first try!  Going to go make some with cashews now :)

At work they call this "Crack Candy" - it's addictive, insanely good, and takes maybe 15 minutes total to do.  
Tricks:
Don't add nuts until after about 3.5 minutes.
Don't need to add salt if your nuts are salted already.
Use 2 TEASPOONS of Baking Soda- makes it so perfect, easy to chew & it won't stick in your teeth at all.
I make this with cashews, a mix of cashews and peanuts- follow the directions and it is perfect every time.
I put all my ingredients out to have ready- the candy is like LAVA and you gotta work fast or get pulled under...
Oh- spray foil with PAM and spread the candy down to cool, then it lifts right off after about 15-20 minutes resting.

I've tried this recipe twice and it burnt both times before I even added the butter & vanilla. Any ideas?

A++++.  This recipe is wonderful.  Although I did make a few changes.  I used raw spanish peanuts which are commenly called for in peanut brittle, used a glass 2qt casserole dish (no breakedge), and I used parchment paper on top of the cookie sheet (no mess).  Microwave times were dead on.  I made 3 batches.  The key was to let the microwave set for a bit to cool down between batches.  Thank you for a fun, easy, and tasty recipe.  Will make this one every year!

WOW!  This is super easy!!  The first batch I made did not turn out because I didn't cook it long enough.  My 1000 watt microwave required 6 minutes, add butter and then cook an additional 1 minute 45 seconds.  It was PERFECT!  If you are messing this up you are not playing with it long enough.  I would rather burn a batch than undercook a batch.  I made 20 pounds of this microwave peanut brittle this Christmas and no one could believe this was made in the microwave!  It's awesome!

Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  My only tip is DO NOT USE A PLASTIC BOWEL to make it with in hte micorwave, not even a micorwave safe bowel.  USE A GLASS micorwave safe bowel.  I made that mistake and it got so hot it melted a hole in the bottom of the bowel.

This was AWESOME! I have to say I did burn my first batch but then went back and read the reviews and my second batch was PERFECT!  The following is a synopsis of the tricks I learned from the other reviews: 
Get everything measured and ready before you get started as the candy sets up quickly in between steps and when done.  I did alter the recipe using  1 tablespoon and not one teaspoon butter and some extra peanuts as well.  Use cooking spray or butter on the lip of your glass bowl and spatula to help with clean up.  Use the times posted in this recipe for a 700 watt microwave.  For my microwave which is 1100 watts, I used 3 min, then 2 1/2 min then 1 min. You still may need to adjust  according to how your microwave cooks. The candy should start browning at the end of the second bout in the microwave.   Heating the pan you intend to spread the brittle in beforehand is helpful so it doesn't solidify too quickly (and this recipe does ONLY make about 1/2 a cookie sheet full).  If you need to spread it a little, just tilt the pan from side to side.  If it still isn't thin enough, after the edges cool just a little bit, lift edges with your fingers and gently pull it outward.  Be careful with the glass bowl you cooked in - wait til it cools some before you put it in the sink or it will shatter.  Just soak in really warm soapy water for about 5 minutes and it will clean right up.  I LOVE this recipe and plan to use it over and over!

My mom has made this for years - she broke her arm, so I had to take over the tradition this year (oh, the pressure!) She said I made her proud this year, though, so that's good! This can be a nerve-wracking recipe b/c it cooks so quickly, but that's also part of its glory. Tips: I buy my peanuts in bulk (Sam's or BJ's) since I make so much of it. This may be obvious, but have everything measured and ready, in assembly-line fashion (I melt the butter in a coffee mug in the microwave and add the vanilla to that; I also use a bit more butter - about 1 Tablespoon), we use an 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup (w/handle) and a wooden spoon for stirring - don't overstir the baking soda in at the end - drop it in, stir it until it dissolves and the brittle looks "fluffy" then, before the brittle "deflates," spoon it onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (don't spread it - just spoon/pour it out)- no greasy bottom to the brittle that way. Allow to cool (I put mine on our screened backporch if it's cold out, but ONLY if it's not damp out! My mom swears you ruin batches if you make it when it's humid - don't even place this near a running dishwasher - it's very humidity sensitive and makes it very chewy) and don't make another batch until the bowl you're microwaving in has completely cooled, too. I made about 3-7 batches a day and only washed the pyrex container when I was done with it for the season, as it is a pain to get all that hard brittle out. When it comes time to clean, fill

This actually works! I adjusted the microwave times based on others' recommendations for a 1000 watt microwave-3 and 1/2 minutes for the first one, 3 minutes for the second, and a minute for the third. It came out perfect!

Why do all the microwave recipes I find omit a key part of cooking in microwave...that would be the wattage....a 1000 watt microwave will cook the brittle much slower than the 1200 watt that I make brittle in....need to start telling people what wattage is used for microwave recipes...ingredients are too expensive to watst...

1100 Watt Microwave Owners--PLEASE NOTE.
After dumping my 3rd batch to a friend who loves 'overdone' candy--I thought to check my 4 month old microwave to discover that I had 1100 Watts--No wonder none were turning out!!  Anyway--I found this procedure to be helpful.  #1.--Don't walk away from this--you need to check the candy color.  #2.  Keep ice water in a glass handy--if you're in doubt about recipes doneness--this is hard crack candy and should immediately form hard ball with threads when small amount is dropped in water--if it doesn't add--20 seconds.  #3.  If it has passed the hard crack test--don't worry if it takes an hour to set up--I put mine in the cold garage and it took all of 40 minutes (apparently every last molecule of the pan needed to be cooled).  #4.  My protocol--mix syrup and sugar--stirring is helpful--microwave for 3.45 minutes--add peanuts and butter, nuke 2.45-3.00 minutes more (gold is good golden brown--not so good)--add vanilla and test for crack stage--if not quite ready--nuke for 30-45 seconds more--remove, stir in soda and pour--place in cool area and forget about it.  #5.Really hot water running directly into candy bowl with utensils cleans them all nicely--do right away as hard crack candy can be maddening to clean--first time I made this years and years ago--two microwaves ago--I ended up throwng out the batch and the bowl.  Lovely recipe--Thanks so much for sharing  and thank you all for the helpful comments--the most helpful was the person

With just a minor adjustment to my microwave this recipe was perfect.

I have a GE Profile 1,000 watt microwave. The first batch made exactly by the recipe burned. I adjusted the power level to 8, left everything else the same and it was PERFECT!

I  have made peanut  brittle the old fashioned way for years  at  Christmas  as part of my Christmas  treats and its  aleays  been  time  consuming- you have to watch it or it  can  scortch in  a  flash. Well no  more!!  This  recipe  is so easy! I made 4 batches  this morning  and already have  them bagged! I did not change  the ingredients and  used  dry  roasted store brand peanuts. My  hints: if  you have one use a Silicone baking mats on your cookie  sheet  (I  use the half-sheet pans and every  baker  should have  at  least  two silicone  mats !!!), 4 cup pyrex measuring  cup  sprayed  with  Pam and then wiped out with a  paper towel(the handle on the  measuring cup helps so  much!!), silcone spatula sprayed  with Pam and wiped off (washed  and  re-sprayed  after each stirring) and very hot  soapy water  to clean up.  I have a  1000  watt microwave and it  came out perfect with the specified times. You have  to wotk fast because it sets  up so quickly!!  Each batch made just about  a pound of brittle.

Ok what you need to do on this recipe is to mix the butter,vanilla and baking soda together in a small bowl ahead of time and then add to the mixture after the fiest micowave period.

For those of you who are getting burned candy at the 4 minute mark...know your MW. I cook it until it starts of boil. Stir well  and add peanuts. Cook until the candy is the color you prefer-light amber to dark amber. Add the butter, vanilla and soda. Stir well and cook just until boiling again. I use a 1000 watt MW and make a very similar recipe regularly. Don't go back to the stove top!

CHANGE YOUR NUKE TIME.  I love the taste and ease of this recipe but be careful.  My microwave is 1100 watts.  I only did the sugar/syrup for about 2 1/2 minutes. (The ingredients were still white turning just a little yellow and all bubbly) Then I added the nuts, this was on for about 1 1/2 minutes.  It was bubbly and turning yellow. GOOD!  The last part I did keep it in for about 1 - 2 minutes, basing it on color, which was slightly beige, and my nuts were smelling roasty and done.

I like this recipe, however I used 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the granulated.  I liked the flavor better with the brown sugar.  I did need to cut down the cooking times.  I used six minutes all together.

SUPER! Easy! Really good!  Some brittle will take out teeth, but this sooooo good & my teeth are still intact!  Key is to not stir baking soda too much...needs to be foamy!!

REALLY STOP READING THE REVIEWS NOW AND MAKE THIS! :-)

This is a fabulous recipe!  After reading reviews, I made the recipe with the following modifications: (1) Use 1 tablespoon of butter instead of a teaspoon; (2) 2 teaspoons of baking soda, because I wanted it really light and crunchy; (3) I have a 900W microwave, so I adjusted to to 80% power while cooking to more closely match the 700W that another reviewer said this recipe used.  

I suspect that people getting burned brittle need to adjust their power down and that should help, instead of just adjusting the time down.

Also, to finish off the recipe, I used the "pulling" method where I pull the brittle while it is cooling to make very thin brittle.  

It was amazing, best brittle I've ever had!

This recipe burns.  Here is what you do. Combine, sugar and caro syrup. Make sure you stir this REALLY well before you mic so it is pasty.  Microwave for 5 minutes.  Once done. ADD the rest of the ingredients. Including the roasted peanuts, as they don't need to cook at all.

This was my first attempt at peanut brittle and it turned out wonderful.  The whole family loved this recipe. The whole family loved it. My Nephew couldn't stop eating it. Spray your glass dish with cooking spray to insure easy removal.

My husband loves this Peanut Brittle. He came home from work and wondered why there weren't any scorched pans lying around in the sink. We love the flavor with using the Microwave, instead of the scorched flavor you get from doing it the old fashion way. Thanks!

My microwave is new and I have no idea of the watts, but I decreased the cooking times to 3,2, and 1 1/2.  And I watch it like a hawk.  First, mix the sugar and corn syrup together and let that sit while measuring out your other ingredients and keep them handy (I use blanched peanuts, 1 T butter and everything else as written).  I use an 8-cup pyrex batter bowl with a handle, and just lay a good sized piece of parchment paper right on the granite counter top.  The first cooking the sugar melts together, bubbles and thins.  It should still be clear or white...not golden.  Stir the peanuts in and watch.  It will bubble up substantially, and should be light gold.  Add the butter and vanilla (which will automatically make it look darker) and nuke until golden brown. Stir in baking powder and quickly dump.  DON'T SPREAD!  It will look thick but as it cools it settles.  Turns out light, airy and crunchy just like Sees!  And if I don't forget I try to add just a pinch of salt with the peanuts, since mine are unsalted.  This recipe has never failed for me, whereas I've not had as much success making candy on the stove-top.  Thanks for sharing!!

Probably one of the best microwave versions of the recipe I have found. Don't be afraid to substitute honey for corn syrup, if you feel so bold.

As is, the time was way off.  This burned very badly and I'm just glad that I was by the sink when I put the baking soda in because it instantly expanded a LOT and overflowed-- thankfully not onto my hands.  Be very careful! I haven't tried again with adjusted cooking time, but I think I'll be using a thermometer and stovetop from now on.

EVERY microwave is different, even with the same wattages, because older microwaves cook more slowly than new ones (has to do with the magnetron)!  You must watch this as it cooks and use the times as a suggestion.  Go by color!  I burned a batch or two before I worked it out on my microwave.  When you get the timing right, this recipe can't be beat for taste and ease of making.  I's truly addictive!
Spray your spatula with Pam spray.

Everyone always raves whenever I make this!  One warning: cool down the glass container before washing it; I broke a thick glass measuring cup from heating the mixture then trying to wash it too soon between batches!

This turned out to be a complete disaster for me. I followed the directions to a T, but was still soft like caramel. What did I do wrong? Don't think I'll ever find out, tossing this out of my recipe box. I'd rather do it the old fashioned way, stove top.

Works beautifully once you know the wattage of the microwave and make adjustments on cooking time.....the lower the wattage, the longer to cook.  
GREAT RECIPE and SO EASY!

I actually made this recipe using soynuts instead of peanuts for dietary reasons, and it was still delicious! It was so simple to make, too. Just one word of warning: make sure you pour the mixture into the pan before it starts to cool too much. I didn't, and I ended up with a pretty sticky situation!

I have used this recipe for more than 20 years and I love it, the most important thing for me is to remember to grease the pan well before dumping the brittle so it won't stick. I have never had a bad batch, always turns out great.it works well with other nuts as well like cashews or almond slices.

I can't believe we get peanut brittle out of the microwave.  I have don't this recipe a couple of times and had to adjust the times with my microwave as well as the style of peanuts used.  I mistakenly got Roasted Nuts the first time and they burnt. So for that I adjusted the cook times.  3 minutes, 1 1/2 minutes after peanuts, and then 30 seconds after the butter and vanilla.  So if you have a powerful microwave, try these times.

Forget the stove top method.  This is SO EASY and it tastes exactly the same.  No constant stirring or having to measure the temp with a candy thermometer. If you have a decent microwave oven with at least 900 watts, this recipe may burn the brittle.  To avoid this, make a double recipe.  Works like a charm. Also, when you add the baking soda, be prepared to pour it out onto the pan within seconds.

I took all the hints and used them.  I used  2 teaspoons of baking soda, a tad more butter, during the last cook time, I checked it by smell of the peanuts--burnt or just right.  If you smell them during the first  cooking of the peanuts they smell raw, then it is easy to compare.  I also used a glass 2 quart meauring ppitcher, sprayed it and the spatula and the parchment paper a bit so I oould tip the pan and get it to spread.  Let utensils and microwave  cool between batches.  Thanks everyone for all hints.

I added  a few more peanuts than the recipe calls for, but otherwise I followed it precisely.  I ended up making three batches of peanut brittle.  I had no problem with scorching.  Thanks for the recipe, Joyce!.

Although the wattage for the microwave is not listed, please watch this recipe.  My microwave had burnt the sugar completely before the 4 minutes was up.  I ended up with a badly burnt lumpy peanut mess.  Just as a guess I would suggest using 1/2 the cook times listed if your microwave is over 700 watts.  I am not recommending this time, as I have not tried again, but after 4 minutes on high, mine was burnt to a crisp.  Not toooooo happy with this one.

If you have a 1100 watt microwave I have the adjusted cook times 3 minutes (sugar & cornsyrup), 2 1/2 minutes (peanuts), 2 minutes (butter & vanilla).  After a few ruined batches with this cooking time it comes out perfect.  Also make sure the cookie sheet is heated before you pour out the candy.

I have never made peanut brittle- I always thought it would be too hard. BOY was this EASY!!! And it came out soooo good. After reading reviews, I thought I would start slow with the timing since my micro is 1000 watts. The first cooking at 3 min, 2nd at 3 min and 3rd for 1 min worked PERFECT for me! Thanks so much for all the helpful hints...I think I may have found a new Christmas gift tradition!

I've used this recipe for years with great results and reviews. I did have to cut down the cooking time after adding nuts (any kind works) and only 1 min after butter/vanilla. I spray everything with Pam and use waxed paper on the cookie sheet so I can make multiple batches in an hour. Silpat works, too!

Fantastic and so easy to make! I followed the directions exactly, except I covered my cookie sheet with foil and lightly greased it. Also, do not over stir the baking soda. Stir it in quickly and pour because it starts to harden fast.  Great for gifts!

Turned out great but you need to know the wattage (sp) of your microwave as that makes a big difference! The only problem I had was the spreading of the candy. How do you spread it without it sticking everywhere???

I absolutely love this recipe. It's quick, easy and very tasty. I included it in my Christmas treat baskets this year. The first 2 batches I made were gone as soon as I put it to the taste tests.My kids went crazy over it and my oldest sons football team buddies were practically fighting over it.
Thank You Joyce!!!

This recipe is awesome.  I've made peanut brittle on the stove once with terrible results.  I was hesitant about trying this one, but it was SUPER EASY.  I don't think I can wait until Christmas to make this again!  Joyce, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe will work in a 1000 watt microwave if you cut the times to 3.5 minutes, then 3 minutes, then 1 minute. My batch just cooled and it is perfect. I heated my cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven while the brittle was cooking in the microwave to help it spread.

My 1000 watt microwave was too powerful for this and my first batch burnt.  With modifications, however, it was fine.  I took 1/2 minute off every step of the instruction.  I also used 1 Tablespoon of butter instead of 1 teaspoon, and this was wonderful.  If you also have a powerful oven, I think you will be please with this quicker recipe.

Oh, one more thing...try using parchment paper.  It works perfectly and completely eliminated the need for a cookie sheet, buttering it, or washing up.  Now the cleanup is easy and just involves soaking the glass bowl and rubber spatula in hot, soapy water.

Great recipe!  I've made it a dozen times.  I've used cashews, roasted spanish peanuts, cocktail peanuts.  All work equally well.
Pouring immediately after adding the soda is important.
I wish I could make it thinner.  It sets so quicklyI can't spreadit out.  Pouring onto a slanting board helped a little. A pyrex bowl is ideal. Soak bowl etc. in hot soapy water for 15 minutes to clean up easy.

A wonderful recipe. I've never made peanut brittle before; this was my first try. A couple of notes from my "beginner" attempt. I should have realized the mixture would cook up better if I had first stirred the sugar and corn syrup together before cooking. When I went to add in the peanuts, only part of the mixture was cooked, so I stirred it then and kept going, adding the peanuts to cook for the second part. When I got the bowl out, I tried stirring it again - and a moment of inattention cost me dearly! I looked away at my dog while I was stirring and the spoon slipped up and out; depositing hot syrup on my hand. Of course, I jumped (it freakin' hurt!), and didn't realize more flew off the spoon onto the floor. As I was rushing to the sink to put my hand under cold water, I stepped right into the candy on the floor. Has anyone else ever cooked peanut brittle and wound up with blisters on both your hand and the bottom of your foot? LOL I'm so annoyed with myself. I know better! After all that excitement, I added the butter and vanilla, cooked for the last minute and a half, added the baking soda, stirred (carefully), and poured it onto my Silpat Mat. Beautiful! I did add more peanuts (personal preference), and the recipe should read 1 TBSP butter, I'm sure. If a first timer can cook it to completion with all those stumbling blocks, anyone should be able to. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Followed the suggestion by another reviewer not to spread the brittle with a utensil, but to tilt the pan gently instead to spread the brittle. Definite difference in consistency if you spread with a utensil. Thanks for sharing!

Soo easy to make. Very impressed with how it turned out. Followed the directions exactly as it was. And yes, do not use a plastic container. The brittle can be over 300 degrees. You'll never want store bought ever again. The second batch I made, I added a pinch of salt along with the butter and vanilla  to give it a little bit of balance. And because I like it a sweet and salty.

1 A mention of how strong her microwave is would help people from wasting ingredients by burning them (or having them stuck in your pan like concrete).
2  Maybe it is just a 'South' thing, but peanut brittle here has a buttery, rich flavor.  The vanilla ruined the entire batch: way too sweet taste and overwhelmed the flavor of the peanuts.

This is the only Peanut Brittle recipe I use, have used it for 5 years now. Make a bunch (because it is so easy) and give to friends and neighbors. Everybody loves it because it has more peanuts than store bought. It is delicious!

I didn't read the reviews first. BIG MISTAKE!!My microwave is 1100 watts.. My pyrex bowl exploded after 3 min. WHAT A MESS. It did not have a wooden spoon in it either. That might make a difference as I always left one it before when cooking anything in the microwave.??? I am going to get a pyrex cup and use it and try again..will use shorter timing as others have suggested. I can't hardly wait......umm.

Fabulous! Easy to make! For those who do not make candy often, be sure to IMMEDIATELY stir in ingredients after cooking in microwave as sugar sets quickly. Since I made several batches at one time, I greased tin foil sheets in stead of using cookie sheets.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  It is EXCELLENT!  We made five batches and put in a pretty container for a Christmas present.   Be sure to tilt the cookie sheet to spread instead of  spreading with a knife.  Spreading with a knife destroys the crunchy texture.  Very addictive!!!

Ended upaking this three times and finally got it.  Followed the recipe the first time and it burned.  Cut time by 1 minute for each cook time the second time around and it didn't cook enough.  Finally, cut each cooking time by 30 seconds and that seemed to work.  Although I have to say, the nuts still had a burnt flavor.  This was not as good as I had hoped.  Probably will try another recipe.

This was my first time making any kind of candy.  It turned out great!!  Heating the pan and spraying the spoon with Pam were really good tips.  I followed the recipe exactly (timing and everything).  I'll definently be making this again.  Probably for Christmas gifts.

This recipe will only make half a cookie sheet full, double it if you want a full cookie sheet. I'd suggest quadrupling the recipe for 35 people (which happens to be how many people I'm making for). You will have to increase the cooking time, or do it in different batches. Also, I rinsed my glass bowl in hot water and it cracked right in the sink, so make sure you let your bowl cool before you rinse it.

The flavor of this candy was wonderful and I followed the recipe exactly (although a little less time in the microwave to prevent burning). However, for some reason it doesn't have the "peanut brittle" texture. It hardened just fine but whenever we eat a piece it "melts" into a toffee-like candy again instead of a crunchy brittle.

I've made this any number of times and love it.  This time my husband got the bright idea to add chopped crisp bacon.  While the bacon flavor isn't terribly strong, you can detect it, and it makes the candy a little different.  Also , if you have a Silpat, definitely use it.  Much easier!  I'm always amazed at how easy this is and what great results it gives.

Make sure you heat your cookie sheet pan first and then when you pour the brittle on the pan tilt the pan fast so it can thin out. Move very fast because it hardens fast. Excellent recipe and very easy. I made mine with cashews and it was wonderful.

This recipe was very quick and easy. My peanuts were dry-roasted and salted and I did not want them to burn, so I added them in with the butter and vanilla instead of earlier and thought they came out very well. I tried this same recipe with almonds as well; they were raw so I put them in after the initial 4 minutes as suggested in the recipe, and they came out tasting perfectly toasty. A quick tip: if you can't wait for it to cool, toss the tray into the fridge or freezer. It should take just a few minutes for it to cool down. Then you can break it up and eat it right away!

I love this recipe, it's so easy.  My husband is diabetic so I substituted Splenda for the sugar and reduced the time to 3 minutes the 1st time and 3 minutes the 2nd time. After the butter and vanilla only left it in for 1 minute. He loved them !!!!!! They tasted wonderful.

while the recipe is good, the microwave/timing aspect is way off for higher wattage ovens. I have 1100 watt oven. Following worked perfectly, too bad it took me 3 tries to get it right and I ran out of ingredients for a 4th batch. Therefore, only my 3rd batched tasted good. Also make sure you mis the sugar and syrup well before the 1st cooking.  1st cooked corn syrup/sugar mix 3 1/2 min, add nuts, cook 2 1/2 minutes more, add butter/vanilla, another 2 minutes. If mixture starts getting darker brown, take it out!! nothing worse than burnt pnut brittle. Also spray spoon and glass container spout with pam. have oven mitts handy too!

WONDERFUL!  I have a 1000 watt microwave so adjusted the times as follows with perfect results every time:  first time 3 1/2 minutes, after adding peanuts another 2 minutes, after adding butter and vanilla 1 more minute.  I added a heaping teaspoon of baking soda and quickly spread on the pan which I had coated with non-stick cooking spray.  I also made a batch with slivered almonds and it was great. Thank you! debby

The first time I made this it turned out perfect.  I did change my cooking times in consideration of my high power microwave to 3 min., 2 min., and 1 min.  It tasted perfect and went quickly!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but mine ended up tasting burnt. I have a Whirlpool 1000 watt micro- it apparently is too much for this recipe.

This recipe is almost the same as LindaC's Microwave Oven Peanut Brittle, As suggested by others using an 8 cup pyrex measuring cup works out great. I highly recommend trying this, you will be pleasently surprised.  I spread my peanut brittle out on parchment paper, no need for greasing a pan.

My first attempt at making Peanut Brittle and thought this was a recipe to try.  It came out just a little chewy but I think if I had read the reviews first I would of figured out not to over stir the mixture after adding int he baking soda.  Everyone that tried it said it was great.  I will tweak the recipe to make it terriffic since I think I know what I did wrong the first time.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

This turned out perfect. After reading the reviews and not wanting a burnt batch, I decided to decrease the cooking time as a few others suggested.  I cooked my 1st batch at 4:00, the 2nd at 3:15secs & the last at 1 minute.  My microwave is 950 watts- a little less than the one the recipe is written for, but I have always not cooked things as long in it. I also used parchment and this made everything simple. I placed my pan outside on a table on my deck (in the cool winter air) and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. Perfect crispness.  I think next time I will try cashews! I made this for a friend who loves peanut brittle,so she'll be the final judge! Quick & easy! Thanks!!

Maybe it is because I doubled the recipe, but the peanut brittle did not ever harden enough.  It remained chewy.  It was too sweet.

I used to have this recipe in a microwave cook book, but can't find the book.
I was so glad I found this recipe!!
When I make the Brittle, I put in two teaspoons of baking soda instead of one.
It make the candy fluffier, and not as hard to chew. It is great!!

Thank God for microwave peanut brittle!  No more mess, burns and waiting for the thermometer to ease its way up to the proper temp!  This is SO easy, and very good.  The only thing I added was a little more butter (probably a total of 1 1/2 tsp) for a little more buttery flavor.

The only thing that improves this recipe is if you use salted peanuts instead of peanuts and salt separately.  Don't ask my why it make a difference...it just does...and for the BEST!!

This is the first time I've ever made candy, and it turned out great! I used a Pampered Chef 2 quart bowl, and at first was worried about the sugar not turning "golden". But after adding the butter and vanilla, microwaving the additional 1 1/2 min, and adding the soda, it became a creamy, light brown sugar color. I did look for the "threading" of the sugar to make sure it was cooked enough, and it really was a treat. I turned it out onto a 9x11 pan lined with parchment. The only real mess was the bowl! This was easy, and after eating almost half of it, we are almost sick to our tummies! Wonderful...I will try different nuts next, and will definately include this in my Halloween menu.

This peanut brittle is excellent. The first time I made it - it came out beautifully. The second and third time however, both batches burned horribly and I had to throw them out. So I would recommend you watch it carefully especially after adding the nuts. I didn't change a thing from the first time to the second but didn't get the same results, so take care. Otherwise it's a great addition to my holiday cookie trays.

This is definitely a keeper.  It is excellent!  I take this one to any pot luck thing along with a few copies of the recipe.  It is so delicious to have fresh peanut brittle.  Delicious (Oh! Did I already say that, well it bears repeating.

I tried the traditional recipe along side this microwave recipe to see which one I liked the best, and Bingo!! this one won.  

I increased the peanuts to 1 1/2 cup and since I have a very powerful microwave, I decreased the power to 9 for the first 4 minutes.

I made 7 batches in about 2 hours!  great fun to make.

I tried this recipe and had problems. I used a microwavable glass bowl, and it cracked after the first 4 minute session. Next I tried a new bowl, also microwavable, and once again, it cracked after adding the peanuts. The theory sounds good, but now I am out of bowls and cannot try again until I go bowl shopping! :O(

This recipe was super easy, took very little time, and the result tasted great!  I followed the recipe exactly (except that I sprayed my cookie sheet with Pam so it wouldn't stick) and I had no problems at all.  Thank you so much!!!

Caution! This recipe was written for a much lower wattage microwave than a  1.55 kw. As a result the candy was burnt as well as the peanuts. First time was so bad I do not want to make again. I watched the video two times and thought I would be a success.

TRICKY! very crisp and crunchy- good flavor BUT, took me THREE times to figure it out even after reading many reviews! 

I have NEVER used the microwave, so I thought why not try it, it sounds easy enough!  Well, its NOT easy.  

Here is my process: 
The first time I made it I didn't blend the sugar and corn syrup- when I took it out to mix in nuts, the sugar mixture was on the bottom uncombined. I tried to stir it- but it turned into a MESS.  I put the bowl into the sink with hot water and dish soap. ugh

Next time I made it I blended with a spatula the sugar and corn syrup and followed the cooking time exactly and it burned!! Grrr...  dark  orange color with an awful smell.  Time to clean up again!!! 

The THIRD time I cut the first cooking time to 3.5 minutes,  second to 3 minutes and third to 1 minute. Yay, it didn't burn. Make sure ADD ingredients fast after taking out each time. When it was finished I took it out and wiggled the brittle around trying not to ruin the light fluffy foam and it turned out fine. 

I gave it 4 stars because it took me 3 times. The recipe was written too simply- like it was a breeze to make on a first try. There are many smart decisions you have to make to end up with a good result.    I can't imagine anyone making it work right the first time.   What I expected to take 30 minutes took me over and hour and a half.  Messy and wasted too many ingredients.  To be honest I won't make it again, I'll stick to stove top. 

whew!

This recipe is so easy!!  My microwave is 1200 watt so after reading the other reviews, I did 3.5 minutes first....then 2 minutes....then 1 minute.  I also used my pampered chef small glass batter bowl and it turned out PERFECT!!

Easy, simple and fast. Tastes just as good as any commercial Brittle that I have bought. Going to try making Cashew Brittle next!

I have used this recipe and instructions before in a less powerful microwave, but today in my newer microwave it got WAY TOO DONE!  I know it's a great recipe, but beware the cooking length based on how powerful your machine is.  You might try about 3 minutes, then 2 1/2, then 1 and see as you go along if it's melting, boiling, and getting hot enough.  If the brittle is gettin dark, then you let it get too hot.  Too much heat will change the taste and consistency, and it's not as good. Darn, I will just have to make it again tomorrow!  I love using the microwave instead of the stove for this, it's so much easier.  Thanks! ~ Tanya in Texas

I come back to this recipe and come back to it every Christmas!  I make at least 5 batches every year.

I always  double the recipe and use my Pampered Chef large batter bowl. I have a powerful microwave so I use the cook times as written in the recipe.  I pour the brittle onto a 1/2 size sheet pan and use an offset spatula to spread it.

This mixture gets VERY hot so be sure to have your oven mitts ready.

Very easy and very tasty!  My only problem was getting it to spread on my cookie sheet.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and heated up my cookie sheet to ease in the spreading but it didn't seem to help.  Will definitely try it again though!  DELISH!

I have used this basic recipe and used natural almonds, cashews and pecans.  To really get the Christmas spirit use a dash or two of cinnamon with the pecans.  I have to cut the times due to my microwave, but I can make 4 or more batches of different brittle in a very short time!  Wonderful recipe.

I've used other brittle recipes before, but this one beats them all. So easy to make and clean up. Tastes yummy, too. Any level cook can make this. I think I'll make some for holiday gifts.

Excellent recipe, be sure to read the reviewers' notes to adapt it to your microwave.  With our 850 watt microwave we did the sugar and syrup for 7.5 minutes, then added our salted roasted peanuts with the other ingredients and microwaved another 1.5 minutes.  The only quantity I would suggest adapting for this recipe is to do 1.5 cups peanuts because we had some parts of our brittle that were low on peanut content until we upped the amount.

This is the recipe that we were given to demonstrate with at the grocery store that I work for. I thought that they were nuts asking us to make this but when I did, I too became a fan!  I also learned not to put the glass bowl in the sink immediately afterward and put tap water in it-my bowl cracked! (Bad call on my part) Just let the bowl cool down awhile and then put HOT water and let it soak a bit. Clean up was easy and the brittle is totally fantastic-just bear in mind that you may need to make adjustments to the cooking times in accordance to the wattage strength of your microwave.

I followed the timing instructions of Rebecca. Which was 3.5 minutes, 3 minutes, and then 1 minute.  All three batches turned out perfectly. I used silicone baking sheets, so the brittle literally peeled right off.  Same with the spatula, I used a silicone one. The brittle was crunchy and great tasting. Just like the stuff you buy. I also drizzled milk chocolate over 2 of the batches. Wonderful!

Delicious, but BE CAREFUL. The first batch I made turned out perfectly. I used a glass pyrex bowl, followed the instructions for my 700 watt microwave and all was well. The second batch, I microwaved everything in my tubberware bowl. BIG MISTAKE. It completely melted through the bottom of the bowl so not only did I ruin my bright yellow bowl, but I couldn't eat the brittle either as melted plastic was contaminating it. So, be warned. Use glass bowls.

This is a great easy recipe. But due to the differences in one microwave to the next make sure to keep a close eye on it the first time you make it.The times are about right and may need adjusting. Otherthan that this is a great recipe I will keep in my christman line up

Fantastic.  Easy once you figure out how long your microwave needs to be set to.  Work quickly.  Best to have everything ready before you start.  I purchased decorated bags and gave this brittle out for christmas.

I don't know if I am doing something wrong.  I don't get the rich carmel color, and it's way too chewy.  Someone told me I wasn't cooking it long enough, but I did the cold water/hard ball test, and I got it to the hard ball phase.  Am I just not stirring the baking powder long enough or something? My family loves peanut brittle, and I would love to be the one they get it from!  HELP!

Mine was burnt burnt burnt!!!  I have a new microwave (not a super duper one though) so maybe that was the problem...?  Anyhow, that's why I'm giving it three stars and not a one.  I think microwaves vary to much to trust a one size fits all recipe.  I'll maybe try this again adjusting the times a bit.  My suggestion is to plan on making a test batch!

I made this Peanut Brittle and it was a disaster...  My (thick) plastic bowl melted, the Peanut Brittle was burned, I couldn't get that smell out of my house.  I wouldn't suggest making this in the microwave.

So easy and super quick that it should be against the law! Nothing with this good with this many calories should be so easy to make. Timing should be adjusted to individual microwaves. I poured it out onto a Silpat. Came out beautifully and disappeared about as quickly as I made it.

This was great.  I used almonds instead of peanuts so I added a dash of salt.  I microwaved for 3 min, 3 min and 1 min and it was just right.

My mother and I have been making this recipe and giving it away to friends and family as gifts for a few years now.  It's WONDERFUL!!!  Be careful to watch it carefully as more powerful microwaves don't need as much cooking time.  This is SO much easier than using the stove or oven!!!  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!!

This was very easy!  And Yummy!  Be sure to check power and adjust accordingly.  I also made the mistake of using wax paper to poor this onto and that doesn't work.  For my own personal taste I chopped the peanuts up before adding and I didn't have to use but 1/2 a cup and there were lots of peanuts all through.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  No standing over a hot pot stirring and waiting for the right "stages"; this is my preferred way of making brittle; I  have substituted a can of deluxe mixed nuts or almonds, or macadamias, or whatever nut you prefer.  Folks think you slaved over it!!!

The first time I made this - it burnt! - So I tried again, and shortened the time by about 2 1/2 minutes.  It turned out perfectly the 2nd and 3rd time.

This is a very, very good recipe that is second to Mirowave Oven Peanut Brittle on this site. I make this exactly to recipe except that I used the release foil so I didn't butter the cookie sheet and it came off perfectly. This makes great gifts! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is a Christmas tradition! Super easy and tastes just like any other brittle out there! I have added cashews and raw ribbons of coconut with success as well. I usually make 2 batches at a time. Adjust your time accordingly though because it still needs the time to cook the sugars. NOTE: stir the sugar, peanuts, salt & syrup before cooking, it does not combine well on it's own.

This is absolutely delicious!  I did use a very heavy pottery-type bowl to make it in after reading the reviews.  I wonder if the first reviewer's problem may have been her microwave wattage.  We are  definitely making this for Christmas gifts

I made this recipe this past Saturday and I thought my husband was going to cry from happiness when he tasted it.  It is WONDERFUL!  Regarding the other reviewer's comments about her bowls cracking, I used my Pampered Chef 2 Quart Batter Bowl, which is oven proof, and had no problems whatsoever.  We ate this batch up and my husband made another batch after I went to bed last night.  Thank you, Joyce, for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I will definitely be making this for friends and family this holiday season!

This recipe makes a batch of delicious peanut brittle. The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp salt along with the peanuts. I use raw peanuts & they have no salt added. The hardest part of the recipe is cleaning the dish it was cooked in. The only negative is cooking times can be very tricky. If I use my 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup, the 3 1/2, 3, & 1 minutes are spot on. However, if I use a mixing bowl I have to change the times to 3, 2 1/2 & 1.

Very good. Used exact proportions. Usind 1000 watt microvave, adjusted times as follows - 3 min with stir at 2 min mark/ add nuts and cook 2 min with stir and burn check at 90 sec/ add vanilla and cook 1 1/2 min with burn check at 1 min. Following the addition of baking soda I poured mixture on a warm 9x13 pan with parchment paper. Spread to fully cover pan. Brittle was 1/4" thick. If you prefer thinner, use full size cookie sheet. I wish this web site would remove recipes that call for microwave cooking without including the wattage of the microwave. Not providing wattage makes the recipe as incomplete as giving conventional baking times without providing temperature. Just my humble opinion.

Recipe is super easy and worked perfectly. I used dark Karo syrup because that's what I had on hand and it was fine. My microwave is 1200w, so I did cut the time down as suggested by other reviews. I was worried that it would burn if I went too long, or not set up hard and crunchy if I didn't go long enough, but it came out great.  Highly recommended!

Adjusted the cook time for 1000 watt microwave. Did 3.5, 3 and 1 min.  Also worked quickly to get baking soda mixed in a few strokes, quickly poured onto warm cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.  I used the other suggestion to tip the cookie sheet to spread the mix.  This was the best candy I have ever eaten!  We had the wonderful bubbles and it was the perfect amount of crunch.  Clean up was easy.

My dad, who passed last December, used to make this every holiday.  He changed a few things though.  He changed to 1 tbsp of Butter,  1 tbsp Vanilla and 1 tbsp Baking Soda.  It is the best Peanut Brittle you will ever put in your mouth.  Light, Fluffy & Buttery!!!

Sat 2/28/2015 my second review. Followed recipe, but this time I used regular Peanuts. First time I used Spanish Peanuts. Color was darker using Spanish peanuts. Must be the skins. Either way, I know it will be good!!

I'm sure the recipe is fine, but I found it too easy to scorch the mix in a high-powered microwave. It may take some tinkering to find the proper settings for your radar range.

I use this every year.  I don't stir until the foam is gone, I dump it out onto my cookie sheet at the height of foaming.  I also don't spread it, I let it do it's thing kind of like the Blob. That way your brittle stays airy and light. Great recipe and really easy .

Very simple, straightforward and an easy cleanup. I poured it out on a silpat, which worked perfectly, so I didn't need to butter a pan. I did have to adjust the times to one minute less per each step because my microwave is more powerful and it would have burned. I added cinnamon, simply because I love cinnamon and it helps keep blood sugar levels in check.

This recipe worked great! I used golden corn syrup instead of the light and it didn't make a difference. I sprinkled coconut on the brittle while it was hot on the cooke sheet. Delish! Only negative is that it didn't totally go hard stayed a bit soft so I had to slide the cookie sheet into the freezer. If you house is warm the brittle probably won't stay hard. But I like a tad gooey. Sprinkle with powdered sugar so pieces don't stick together. Next time I will try lining the cookie sheet with wax paper and butter it. Brittle still stuck on my sheets with only butter. Made this for a bake sale and named it 'Frosty Brittle' because of the coconut and sprinkled powedered sugar. Sold out quick!

I love, love, love, LOVE this recipe.  I've tried other microwave "peanut" brittle recipes and they've always turned out burnt.  I don't use peanuts but pecan halves instead.  Simply roast them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes.  Let me cool and chop them up.  Devine!!!!

Made once and then made modifications using another recipe and cooking for a 1000 watt oven. Increased the butter to 1 tab (thinking about using 2 Tab next time) and increased peanuts to 1.5 cups. For my 1000 watt I reduced times on the second and third cooking: 3 min instead of 3 1/2 and 1 min instead of 1 1/2 min. Cooked perfectly.

This was super simple and excellent - it turned out just like store-bought! I tried one batch and was so impressed that I made two more to hand out at Christmastime. I used all measurements but decreased each session in the microwave by half a minute.

I burned the heck out of my first batch.  Should have read the reviews before I started.  Having said that, after I made adjustments, this recipe is wonderful and so easy.  My microwave is 1100 w so I follow the recipe and the cooking times but I use 70% power.  Comes out perfect every time.

I made several batches of this last year at Christmas.  Had to make several batches because we would eat so much that I didn't have enough to share with family and friends.  Will make it again this year.  Why do I wait until Christmas to make this????  It would be good all year.

Very tasty and easy!  I tried this with the raw Spanish peanuts and dry roasted peanuts.  Both worked.  I also tried this with cinnamon extract instead of vanilla and this was also really good.  I have a 1000 watt microwave and it didn't burn when I cooked the sugar, corn syrup and peanuts for 6 min, stirring energy 2 minutes.  Added butter and vanilla and cooked 2 minutes.  Then added the soda and turned out on a silicone baking sheet.

Like some of the other commenters, our microwave was also too hot...so our first batch burned.  I reduced the times to 3.5, 2.4 and 1.  Seems to be perfect.

I used to make this years ago, but have misplaced the recipe.  Glad to find the general ground work for this recipe.  If you want a little different taste, use dark karo and pecans, for "Pecan Pie Brittle".  Just don't cook it as long, maybe 30 seconds less for each step and add the pecans when you add the butter and vanilla.  I agree with 2 tsp. of baking soda, I does make a more tender brittle.

Great and easy recipe. I have made it several times and it's always perfect. You do have to stir it half way through each step. Do NOT use margarine, it will burn.

Have made this recipe several times.  Just a couple things:  Use a Microwave safe bowl (preferably with a handle, as it will get HOT); the cooking times stated for this recipe seems to be for a low-wattage oven (as I have burnt a couple batches because my new microwave seems to be higher and I didn't know what to do).  SO reduce the (1st) 4 minutes to 3; the (2nd) 3-1/2 to 3; and leave the final amount of time alone.  These are just suggestions but I tried it and managed not to burn my next couple of batches.  I think this Peanut Brittle is better than See's (don't let any See's executive see this review)...tee hee!

Burnt the first batch. Reduced the cook times to 3 mins, then 3 1/2 mins then 1 min 15 sec. Second batch was great.

This is high altitude (Denver) with a 1000 watt microwave.

I followed directions just as listed. My peanuts burned, the sugar also burned. The liquid was brown.... and everything stuck so quickly to my glass dish I couldn't even get it out of the dish to pour it in the buttered pan. Then, all I could taste was baking soda when I ate it.

Great recipe! very easy- much easier than stove method, which i ended up ruining my glass top stove a couple yrs back and have not made brittle since finding this recipe. has good taste, very easy- just be sure to use a dish big enough and suggest keeping the recipe serving as original and just make more batches. Also- check your microwave wattage- I reduced the cook time by 1/3 since i have a high watt wave-
Suggest also using non stick reynolds wrap to line your pan as well as spray

My tweak to recipe was using brown sugar vs white, i use same amount as original recipe.

This is the easiest recipe that I have made.  My microwave agrees with the recipe as far as minutes.  It was delicious too!  I have already gave this recipe to several friends!  I'm taking this to Kansas City with me tomorrow to a Christmas party!!  My bowl cleaned up great, just hot sudsy water.. Judy

This was easy and fun! I added more butter, say 2 teas. I will try to tip to spread it. I found it impossible to spread as instructedpd, but with these ingredients,I knew it would taste good. Will make again.

SUPER EASY!!!! 
I was going to do the "top-of-the-stove" method, but happened upon this and figured why not?

I'm so glad I did. NO ONE even thought i used the microwave, which of course i had to tell them because i was so amazed myself.

I did add more baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons, and I will add more next time as I don't like my brittle hard. 

NOTE: get a glass bowl with a handle and a good glove. it is HOT when you pull it out. i had mix everywhere and all over my kitchen towel. (however do not put the hot bowl directly in water as it will break and shatter. even after cooling down i just soaped it up and let it sit for awhile, no cleaning problem.)

Pretty good recipe.  My peanuts were burnt.  I would change microwaving for 5 minutes until you see that your mixture starts to brown.  Add peanuts and microwave for 1 minute. You definitely need to watch the microwave and do in it in small 15 -20 seconds, or microwave on 50% power and mix in between after the peanuts have been added.   The recipe definitely needs a disclaimer of varying power and times.  I've made it twice and ruined the first batch.  The second came out a little burnt even though I was more careful.

The only problem with this recipe is that I do not need to be eating all of this peanut brittle.  It's so very easy to make.  I did have to adjust the time down by 30 seconds for each cycle to match my microwave, but that just means I can make more faster.  Love this stuff.

Very easy!  Very quick!  Be sure to be completely prepared before you start and read the reviews about microwave times.  I was successful on the first try and can't wait to make more.  As my 12 year old daughter said "I could eat this all day!"

Perfect! Easy and delicious. I made two batches for Christmas gifts in hardly any time. 

BUT don't forget to adapt the recipe to the wattage of your microwave. Ours is 1000 watts. I've made hard candy in it for years, so instead of the times in this recipe, I used my tried-and-true times form that candy recips. I came at them through much trial and error, so I knew they'd work with this. 

Also, keep an eye on the color of the candy. You want to get that warm amber color on the second cook time with the peanuts.

All this might make the recipe sound difficult, but it's the exact opposite. I'll be using it many times for gifts.

I'm not sure what it is that I did wrong. But I burnt it somehow before I even got around to putting the butter and vanilla in it. However....I still continued on. If someone might have some pointers on what I could have done wrong, I'd gladly appreciate it! (but I give this recipe a good 5/5 because I'm sure it'll be awesome once I learn how NOT to fail while making this easy stuff!)
p.s. if you think you might fail, even the tiniest bit. Butter or spray pam on anything you stir this mixture with...maybe even the bowl you use to stir it all ine. In then end (if you mess up like I did) you'll thank yourself tons that you did.

This tastes great and is not too chewy - the only problem I had is my glass bowl cracked, so I transferred the mixture to a casserole dish and finished it.  It was hard to spread out thinly, but it still tastes great!

I followed someone's advice on the 1100 watt times and this recipe came out perfectly!  It was my first time making peanut brittle so I was scared but it was very easy and it came out really tasty.  However, I'm giving the recipe 4/5 stars because it has a little too much peanuts for my taste.

The recipe itself is okay IF you are careful to watch it while cooking because every microwave is different.  If you watch to ensure you are not overcooking it turns out.

This was really good and easy.  I made it in a two-quart Pyrex measure for easy pouring.  Definitely do not use anything smaller!  I only had dark corn syrup and ran out so substituted molasses for about a third of the corn syrup.  If you like molasses, you should try that.  The flavor was wonderful, similar to that of molasses taffy.  I have what appears to be a 1200 w oven but it's pretty old so the current times worked fine.

My mom and I found this recipe and made it with maple syrup because we didn't have any corn syrup on hand.  It was wonderful.  We made two batches of peanut brittle and then made two more batches with pecans instead of peanuts.  Everyone loved it and some said it was the best brittle they'd ever had.  I liked the pecan brittle even better than the peanut.  It's so easy that I'll be making it often.

I cut the time down by 30 seconds because I was nervous about burning the brittle like other reviewers but it turned out great!  Thanks!

Who would have ever thought that making delicious Peanut Brittle could be so easy?  This was a quick/simple recipe that I whipped up before the holidays and the family LOVED it!  After the first batch began smelling a bit burnt, I did do what another poster suggested and cut the microwave cooking time down just a tad.  The first cooking time I cut down to 3-3 1/2 min.  The second cooking time I cut down to 3 min. and the last time for only 1 min.  Perfect!

This is so quick and easy! I gave it a s a gift and the recipient loved it! Just remember to heavily gresae the pan or it is hard to get off. And DON'T use wax paper it sticks to the brittle and does not come off! (found this out the hard way) Makes a great traditional holiday gift!

My mother has made this exact recipe for years.  We made 5 batches today!  If your first batch comes out too brown or burnt, decrease microwave time.  It will still cook and get browner after you are done.  We did 3 min (instead of 3 1/2), then 2 1/2 (instead of 3 1/2), then 1 min (instead of 1 1/2).  It just depends on your microwave.  Don't spread too thin, instead spred evenly then after it cools a little, lift and pull the edges. We used scissors to cut what we pulled then went around again.  This is a very easy recipe and make great peanut brittle.

I LOVE this stuff! I tried it for the first time last year around Christmas time. I use pecans instead of peanuts and it was insanely delicious! I planned on bringing some to my parents but most of the time it never makes it out of my house. It's sooo addicting!

GREAT!  This recipe is so easy to do.  I used cashews because we can't have peanuts.  The baking soda foams the candy and makes it easy to bite.  I also added 1/2 cup extra nuts.  I will be making this again.  Thank you Joyce!

This turned out really good.  Great flavor...only I ruined it!  Trust me, don't take the short cut to not dirty up a baking sheet and use wax paper like I did.  I used the wrong side, it stuck and we ended up throwing the whole thing away.  I was majorly disappointed.

I just made a batch of this, and it tastes great.  I made it EXACTLY like the recipe stated.  Next time though, I will add more peanuts than the one cup it calls for.  I think it needs more.. otherwise, it was TOOO easy and yummy!

After my smoke alarm finally quit, I realized that my microwave is far too powerful for making this recipe a success.  Unless you're comparing apples to apples, I'd go the traditional stovetop method.  Or at least specify microwave wattage.  The couple of stars are for convenience!

So great!!! Mom wasn't going to let me use a new recipe, and insisted the first batch be the one she's used for 20+ years. After seeing the ingredients and amounts were the same on this one, she said we could try it for the second batch. We ended up using this recipe for the rest of the batches! It doesn't stick to your teeth the way other kinds do, which was the one thing I always hated about peanut brittle. We changed one thing: after adding peanuts, microwave for 2 mins, stir, then microwave for 2 more mins. It sets up better.

This recipe got rave reviews from my co-workers. I made exactly as written, using raw spanish peanuts...all 3 batches were perfect. I sprayed a piece of foil with non-stick spray for easy cleanup (laid it on top of cookie sheet)
Will never make on stove again!!

I used raw spanish peanuts but other than that I followed Joyce's directions to the tee.  I made four perfect batches of peanut brittle.  When I think the time wasted standing at the stove testing a ball in water I could kiss Joyce.  Thank you!

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!
yum... I have made this three times now and it hasnt lasted very long in our house..... a firm favourite! 
I did a few tweaks after the first two times (bad habit of mine cant leave anything alone!!) I used 2 cups of salted peanuts and 1 tablespoon of butter for the extra butter flavour. Didnt need to grease the tray because I used glad bake to lay the brittle on. Otherwise I followed the cooking time EXACTLY and it turned out perfectly every time! Thank you for sharing this absolutely delightful recipe!!

Excellent!  So easy to make and is delicious!  If you like your peanut brittle to be a little thicker, increase the baking soda to 1 1/2 teaspoons.

I made this several years ago and only gave it 3 stars because it turned out too chewy.  Just made it again but followed another reviewers recommendation to change the cooking times to 3.5 minutes, 3 minutes and 1 minute, respectively.  It turned out absolutely perfect in my 1000 watt microwave oven.  This will now be a permanent addition to our candy recipe box!

Candy in the microwave? Yes! Forget the mere defrost and reheat functions, your microwave is crying out for glamor,elegance... and hard crack candy! Amazing, fast and way easier than pie.
I adjusted the cooking time to about 3 min on level 8, 3 min on 8 again, 1 1/2 min on 7 or 8, and sometimes another round at 8 for 30 sec if it's not very golden brown yet.

I've never rated anything so low. I followed the recipe to a tee and during the 3 1/2 minutes the mixture was smoking. I took it out and added the baking soda, the bowl was too hot to even work with. I had to place the bowl in the sink (my mistake) because the bowl started to crack. I think that I'll just buy my peanut brittle already made.

I frist saw this recipe and thought "NO WAY".  Peanut brittle in the microwave, but then had to try it.  Glad that I did.  I did make a few changes after reading the reviews.  I put the sugar and corn syrup in the mic. for 1 minute...then added 2 cups of peanuts...(we like our peanut brittle with extra peanuts).  I then cooked this for 3 minutes.  After it came out I added the baking soda and vanilla.  Put it in a glass dish (layed down parchment paper)...and delicious.  Planning on giving these out for Christmas treats.  Thanks for the post.

Not sure if it's just my microwave, but everything was burnt and the whole house smelled awful.  Still trying to get the smell of burnt peanuts out of the microwave.  I will try again and shorten the micorwave time and re-rate this recipe.

Couldn't be simpler to make. Just be careful and keep an eye on the mixture while microwaving and adjust cooking time to the power of your microwave. It's easy to burn if cooked too long, and it won't harden if not cooked long enough. My family and friends love it. Makes great Christmas gifts too.

Fast and easy!  I used the time indicated in the recipe for my 1500 watt oven, and it turned out perfect.  I used a 2 quart Corning casserole dish instead of a glass bowl.

I swear, I followed the directions, and made one batch only.  My husband lovingly refers to this disaster as 'Peanut Sticky'.  It was a gooey mess even after letting it sit to cool.  I ended up making fudge instead.

Good recipe.  Quick and easy.  It seemed to be missing something though.  I decided to add a pinch of salt and that seemed to do the trick.
I also have a mega watt microwave oven, so I followed the directions, but I used 8% power.  I would make this again.

Excellent recipe.  This was my first time to make peanut brittle and I will use the recipe again.  I followed another review than used 70% power for a 1800w microwave.  The times were perfect.  I also used a Tupperware RockNServe bowl because I didn't have a glass one.  It worked great and cleaned up very easily.  Thanks for the recipe.

A winner. Easy. Fast. I won't ever make it the old way again.  Light and crunchy.  I used a bit more butter and used oil spray on a metal spatula to spread it out.

This stuff really is good and easy to make.  I, too, have a supercharged microwave (1800w single phase), so I set the power to 7 and followed the directions the same.  It's awesome!

This recipe is horrible.  The first time the cooking times were too long for my microwave (the brittle turned out overcooked), so I decreased it, but the flavor still came out bad.  I am returning to the "long way" and making it on the stove.  It may take longer on the stove, but at least it tastes good.  Nice idea though.

The basic recipe is good.  The cooking times are not.
I left off the last 1 1/2 minutes or it would have burned. 
it was beginning to smell scorched.

Love this recipe. Make it every year. I spray my 2 quart and give it a wipe with a paper towel and I do the same to my scraper. Makes it much easier to stir everything together. I make it as written no changes.

I made as written, but decreased the last cook time to 1 min.  I think I could have decreased the earlier time a little more as well...it was almost overcooked.  Moving forward I would decrease time to 3 mins and 1 min and use a warm cookie sheet. Can use any nuts and checked candy with a cold water test.

Don't let anyone tell you that baking, candy making , etc. is not science because it truly is! Seriously, this is an excellent recipe and if you know your microwave well, you should have success. For me personally, I discovered that about 30 seconds less on each round of cooking times was the best. Anything less than that produces an anemic looking brittle that will pull out even the most durable dental work; anything more makes your kitchen smell like you had a house fire. It was an experiment for sure but like scientists say, "we wouldn't call it research if we new what we were doing."

This recipe is not for high wattage microwaves. Mine is 1550.
I altered the cooking time.  Karo and sugar 3 minutes, after added peanuts 2 1/2 minutes, after added vanilla and butter 1 minute. Came out great. I tried reducing the power level as someone else suggested, but this did not work for me as it did not set up.    I made 3 batches to give as gifts.

I made this just like the recipes says except about 2 cups of peanuts...could hardly stir it though. But, as one other person said, you might should not make this more then once a year, it's hard to stop eating it.....so good!

I enjoyed this recipe. It is simple and my 12 year old grand babies enjoy making it with me. I am experimenting with different nuts and the walnut brittle has been a favorite. I quit using the wax paper because no matter what I did it stuck so I just pour directly on cookie sheet.

I have made this Peanut Brittle every Christmas for my friends and family since 1992. I have had several different microwaves and you do need to keep an eye on the cooking times since the new microwaves are higher power than older ones. My recipe originally called for 1000 watt ovens.

This recipe is great but the time does need to change according to what microwave you’re using. The first time I tried it, I burnt it and had to start again. The second time I took a minute off and it was perfect. My mom followed the time on the recipe in her microwave and it was perfect. If you do this recipe you might have to play with the time a little bit. 
The cleanup was easy I just soaked the bowl in hot soapy water for a few minutes and came right off. Everyone loved it and raved it was the best peanut brittle they ever eaten.

I followed the recipe to the letter, added the peanuts and cooked per instructions and when it came to adding the vanilla and butter after the cooking time stated the mixture burned.  What was the size of microwave that was used in this recipe?  It makes a huge difference for those of us out here that are trying to do things following a recipe.  My husband just shook his head and said sorry, so I dumped it in the trash.

This is the exact same recipe my mom gave me years ago and it's awesome!!! What my mamma taught me was to sprinkle salt on the buttered cookie sheet before you pour the peanut brittle on it.  That sweet salty taste is fantastic!!!

So good! It's true - I haven't been able to stop eating it! It turned out WAY too sticky and chewy the first time I tried it, and it was likely because my microwave was low wattage. So if that's the case for you, I found success by increasing the cook times like 15-30 seconds each. I also found that aluminum foil on the baking sheet works wonders, because then you don't have to clean another dish and it's easier to just pick the whole thing up and break it in your hands.

Made suggested changes to cook times. I think it should be noted in the original recipe what wattage the times are for. Burnt first batch but the next two came out very well.

I have been making this recipe almost 30 years, it is the exact same recipe that came in the recipe book that came with my first G.E. microwave oven, the recipe is based on using an 800 watt oven so you have to adjust the times accordingly to suit the microwave you have.

It was so easy to make, I love this recipe! I was nervous but followed the instructions, used parchment paper to line my pan and it turned out perfect and rivals the cashew brittle we buy from a local Amish lady. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Start watching at 3 minutes.  With my microwave it was browning at 4 minutes so I stopped it and added the nuts and butter.  Only took another 45 secs for it to be ready.  I measured out all the ingredients and had them ready to add since you have to work fast.  Definitely have the spoon thoroughly greased to flatten. Buttered waxed paper works well to flatten.  Very easy recipe.

I made this and it turned out great. It was just like my aunt would make for Christmas every year. I did have to adjust the cook times, I had to go longer I guess my 1000 watt microwave isn't as strong as others, but I just watched it and it turned out great. Thanks

I make my dad peanut brittle every year for Christmas and typically dread doing it. I followed another reviewers tips and it made for the perfect brittle! I might actually enjoy making it, now! ;) First round I microwaved for 3 1/2 minutes, second round 3 1/2 mins, last round 1 1/2 mins. It wasn't quite the color I wanted so I put it on for another minute and it was perfect. Add the baking powder, stir a few times, and quickly pour on your baking sheet. The baking soda continued to react while it was pouring on the sheet, and I tried to just tilt the sheet instead of spreading with a spatula, and it broke the foam but it settled quickly so the shine and smoothness wasn't broken and jagged. It is nice and crunchy and flaky, doesn't stick to your teeth. I was able to flatten it out a bit more once it started to cook a bit.

Added a splash of almond extract to the vanilla and it tastes and smells delicious.
Accidentally but unsalted peanuts like me? Just add a pinch of salt!

We tossed the whole mess.  It burnt in our microwave, as it appears to have done in others' attempts to make.  I tried to salvage it but ended up wasting my nicely toasted pecans, and my baking sheet also.

CAUTION! My 1100 watt microwave burned this brittle during the second 3.5 minutes. I ruined a cup of good peanuts and all the other ingredients. I will not be reattempting this recipe, since the times are so off that I can’t even begin to guess what times are right. It would have been helpful if the original poster had included the wattage of the (apparently low wattage) microwave used. I see I am not the only cook to have been disappointed in the recipe for this reason. I should have read the reviews first, but I was in a hurry. I’ll exercise more caution in the future!

It is wonderful, but obviously made for an older microwave. We have a 1200 watt, so I cut down the first session to 3 minutes and the second to 2 minutes and the last to 1 minute. Turned out beautiful.

Be sure to quickly stir sugar and syrup about each 1-1/2 minute  to keep it from burning.  Also consider reducing the initial cook of 4 minutes to 3-1/2 minutes for high powered microwaves.   

Other than that YUM!!!.

I couldn't believe how easy this was!  And it turned out so well, too.  I did have to make adjustments for cooking time since I have a 1200 watt microwave, so I followed another reviewer's time.  This recipe was fast, easy, and so good!  Lots of compliments.  I will definitely make this again, and with Christmas time coming up, I think I found this recipe just in time.

Should have read the reviews! Everything was going perfectly until the last microwaving at 1.5 minutes - burned everything! I also used half the baking soda and it foamed up so fast that it was basically a burnt sugar and peanut volcano in my kitchen. I'll be cleaning that up for the next few days. So it was a total disaster for me. However, I know what to do next time and I really think it'll be worthy of four stars. It smelled heavenly before I burned it and I'm confident that a little tweaking will make this the perfect quick-and-easy brittle recipe.

Tips: use nonstick aluminum foil instead of spraying the baking sheet for zero clean up.

Make sure to premeasure EVERYTHING.  I had them lined up in the order I was adding them.  It's an easy recipe but you don't want to let your candy cool off at all between cooking cycles or it won't get to a high enough temp to harden.

Try using light brown sugar instead of white for part or all of the sugar ... O-M-GOSH, it's a taste sensation that way!  I did 2/3 brown and 1/3 white.

Also, while tempting as it is to double this, I won't because it sets up too quickly to try and wrangle a 300+ degree hot bowl of lava plus 2 hot baking sheets while being naturally accident-prone. I would think the cooking times would have to be adjusted for a double batch as well. That one's all on you, fellow chef!

My microwave is a 900 watt and I adjusted the cooking cycle times to 4 minutes, 3 minutes and 1 minute and it came out perfect.  I followed another chef's suggestion to keep the baking sheet in a warm oven until needed, then get it out when you start the last cooking cycle.  DON'T spread it in the pan or it won't be as "tender" because all that lovely foaminess after adding baking soda will be released. If you heat the baking sheet, it will flatten out a little as it cools. Leave the pan tilted and it will spread out on its own.  Next batch I will be adding an extra 1/2 cup of salted, dry roasted peanuts because I prefer a slightly higher "peanut to brittle ratio".

I did th same as review #5 .  It turned out perfect.  You don't want the air bubbles to pop, this is what makes it an easy crunch instead of to hard in your teeth.

Definitely use a GLASS bowl... my first try I made a fatal mistake and did not use glass....  needless to say it was not edible, totally my fault there. It took a few tries to get the times right in my microwave, but once I did it was awesome

This was the worst recipe ever! I don't know if my microwave is all powerful or if the numbers are wrong but after the first 4 minutes I thought it seemed a bit dark and half way through the next 3.5 minutes there was black smoke coming from the microwave. The black gooey mess is currently sitting in the snow on my deck, I'm not sure I will be able to salvage the dish. Beware of the times!

I made two batches of this peanut brittle and both batches came out perfect. I have a powerful microwave but it didn't  effect the outcome. If making more than one batch, soak bowl in hot water, no soap needed. The water cold or hot is what softens and disolves the sugar for an effortless cleanup. Hot water speeds things up. Please make sure bowl has cooled sufficiantly before adding water or it can shatter! This will be my go to recipe from now on!

First off my microwave is 880 Watts, really time to get a new one! Followed this recipe with the following modifications; I didn't have enough light cord syrup, so I used dark corn syrup to make up the difference. I also thought I could use a 4 cup/ 1 qt measuring cup, but during the last microwaving it bubbled over, so I guess you do need a larger container to microwave it in. I added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice , at the same time I added the butter and vanilla. I also adjusted the cooking times to 4 min, 3 min, and 1.5 min. Came out great, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years but you need to watch you mixture with the newer higher wattage microwaves. Not a stick to your teeth pull out fillings kind of brittle.

This is THE BOMB!!!
It's light and NOT the hard brittle that gets all up in your teeth.
A gem of a recipe. Kudos Kudos Kudos!!
Didn't change a single thing or step. The author of this even says "add more nuts if you like".  (I like so....... I did). I was short on peanuts but had a bag of Premium mixed nuts that I was hesitant to risk (in case things went bad) and I can only say NO REGRETS!!  And yes...... It is in fact addictive.

Amazing!  I used lightly salted dry roasted peanuts and raised the butter to 1 Tblsp.  I have a 1000 wat microwave so adjusted the cooking times to 3.5 - 3.0 and 1 minute for the last mix in.  I lightly sprayed everything with Pam and lined my pan  with parchment paper.  Came out absolutely perfect the first time.  Thanks to the wonderful reviews... This recipe is as good if not better than any Peanut Brittle I have tasted.  Enjoy!

I read the reviews and used some of the tips.  I think it would be helpful to know the microwave power on these recipes. I have an 1100w and when I added the peanuts I put the temp on the microwave to Power Level 8 and even then it was starting to get burned.  Be sure to use cooking spray on spatula or spoon before stirring and if you watch the video it says to stir the sugar/corn syrup mixture half way through - the directions don't say that.  Also, the recipe calls for 8 oz of peanuts and I almost made the mistake of using 1 cup when I realized the jar I had was 16oz and 1 cup is not half. I'm sure nobody else made that mistake but I thought I would mention it for rookies like me.   I just eyeballed it for half the jar and it came out with enough peanuts.  I will definitely be trying the "smear chocolate chips over the top while hot" version that was suggested at the end of the video as well as using cashews and pecans.  So easy, a little messy to clean up, but totally worth it.

I chose this recipe because of its simplicity.  Easy ingredients and zapped in the nuker…how much more convenient could it be? I did make some changes simply because I didn't have some things. For example, I didn't have corn syrup and so I used honey. I didn't have many peanuts so I used walnuts, sunflower seeds, pistachios and some roasted chick peas, whatever I had on hand and heck, then I threw a few chocolate chips on top.  I wanted this to be more nuts/seeds and less brittle so I doubled the nut/seeds to 2 cups. I know you are thinking that I basically completely changed the recipe but I didn't really. The basics are the same. It's currently cooling in the fridge and looks good! Update: it IS good! However… it has a faint burnt sugar taste like that of old fashioned sponge toffee. Next time I will cook it 3 min- 3 min- 1 min and see if that's enough. I loved the additional cup of nuts…not so much the choc chips but I am making it for 2 teenaged boys and THEY will like them. The honey substitution was fine. The ease and versatility of this recipe makes it a keeper for me!

The first time I made it according to directions, I had browned brittle. Then I looked up my microwave online and learned the wattage is 950. So, I reduced each step by 30 seconds and used 1.5 cups Spanish peanuts. Perfect!

This was sooo perfect, just what I wanted! It was pretty quick and simple, hardest part is cleaning out the bowl after. Instead of using peanuts, I used a mix of cashews and pecans, and it still tasted great. I also took 30 seconds off each time frame suggested, just to make sure it didn't burn, which worked out quite well. Can't wait to make this again:)

My microwave is new and I have no idea of the watts, but I decreased the cooking times to 3,2, and 1 1/2. And I watch it like a hawk. First, mix the sugar and corn syrup together and let that sit while measuring out your other ingredients and keep them handy (I use blanched peanuts, 1 T butter and everything else as written). I use an 8-cup pyrex batter bowl with a handle, and just lay a good sized piece of parchment paper right on the granite counter top. The first cooking the sugar melts together, bubbles and thins. It should still be clear or white...not golden. Stir the peanuts in and watch. It will bubble up substantially, and should be light gold. Add the butter and vanilla (which will automatically make it look darker) and nuke until golden brown. Stir in baking powder and quickly dump. DON'T SPREAD! It will look thick but as it cools it settles. Turns out light, airy and crunchy just like Sees! And if I don't forget I try to add just a pinch of salt with the peanuts, since mine are unsalted. This recipe has never failed for me, whereas I've not had as much success making candy on the stove-top. Thanks for sharing!!

I read the reviews about being careful not to allow it to burn so I had to adjust the cooking times since I have a 1200 watt microwave. You have to be quick to stir because it cooks fast and starts setting. I was surprised that it was so easy to break into pieces once it set. The prior microwave recipe I used, the peanut brittle came out so hard that I almost had to use a chisel.  Everyone liked this one. I'm keeping this recipe handy. Thanks for sharing!

This is the best recipe, no fail, after a few minor adjustments. My microwave is strong, so I reduced the first cooking time to 3 minutes and the last cooking time to 1 minute only. I also line my cookie sheet with parchment paper to save a sticky mess and some dishes. Now, every batch is perfect, so glad I came across this recipe.  :D

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this. I have a 1200 watt microwave and the cook times were too long for my MV. My 1st batch was a little too dark but it doesn't taste burnt, so it should be ok. The second batch turned out much better. For step one I only had to microwave for 3 minutes. After I added the peanuts I only cooked an additional 1 minute, then added 1 TBSP (not  1 tsp as the recipe called for ) of butter and the tsp of vanilla and put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds just to soften it back up and added the baking soda. So be very mindful of your microwave mine is fairly new and high wattage. Aside from that the recipe was easy and much less time consuming than the traditional stove top method. I'll make this again.

I make 7-8 batches of this every year for Father’s Day and Christmas for my 93-year-old Dad, and it couldn’t be easier! No need for s candy thermometer. I use 2 Anchor-Hocking 8-cup glass measuring bowls with the handle, so they’re microwave-safe. One can be soaking in soapy water while the other one is cooking! (I had never made peanut brittle before I found this recipe, and have shared it with Facebook friends!)

No joke, I have been making this with my mom since the 1980s. (I believe this recipe was in the first microwave cookbook!) Be careful not to over-stir ingredients each time, do it VERY quickly, and just enough to mix. When adding the baking soda stir it VERY quickly, only about 10 whisks if possible, then drop onto the cookie sheet quickly. DO NOT SPREAD. Let it spread out on it's own. (I prefer PAM over butter on the cookie sheet.) The  MOST IMPORTANT change to this recipe is to REDUCE the final cook time to 30-45 seconds, otherwise the peanut brittle gets burnt! With less cook time in the final step your peanut brittle will be lighter colored, with a soft buttery flavor and will NOT be BURNT. For cleanup I simply run the bowls and utensils under hot water for a few minutes. Let the water run, and it will remove all the candy. I always buy EXTRA ingredients because sometimes it takes a couple batches to perfect! Good luck!

I make this every year and I made some adjustments to the times.  I microwave it for 3 minutes the first time, stir and microwave 3 more minutes, add the butter and vanilla and cook for 1 minute, add baking soda and put on cookie sheet.  My microwave is powerful and burned the first batch using the original recipe.  Love this so much, everyone asks for it at Christmas.

I read a lot of the reviews before attempting to make this.  I have never made peanut brittle before so was hesitant to try.  I saw the reviews regarding the wattage of the microwave and checked (mine's 1100) and made adaptations as suggested.  The first round I did for a little more than 3 minutes.  The next round I did 2 minutes and then, the last one, I did for 1 minute.  I also made sure to have everything ready.  And, no kidding, the final product you need to pour out quickly on the cookie sheet.  I too used the tipping of the cookie sheet to spread which worked out great. I used salted and roasted peanuts and left out the salt.  Also, I used one tablespoon of butter (my husband told me the brittle tasted really buttery. . .hardly any butter in there!!!) )and 2 teaspoons of baking soda.  I plan now to make many more batches.  I will also make pecan brittle and cashew brittle.  Amazing!!!

The times in this recipe were perfect for my microwave, and the brittle was FABULOUS! I made 4 batches; the first was by the recipe but for the next ones I added I/2 cup more nuts and a pinch of salt - hard to believe, but it came out even better. Lining w/ parchment, pre-warming the tray and tilting it to spread it instead to using the spoon helped retain the airiness caused by the baking soda's foaming. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I, too, burned the first batch making it by the directions given.  I then took the advice of another to reduce the time by 1/2 minute each step, and it turned out perfectly.   I used half peanuts and half pecans as requested by my husband, for whom I was making it.  I will definitely do it again, couldn't be easier.  I don't own a candy thermometer so  this was the perfect answer.

Taste is fantastic and it was super easy. the bowl was a challenge--use something with a handle so you can pour it onto a WARMED cookie sheet. It set up really fast but I was able to stretch it to fill the entire pan. Will be making this again.

This recipe is amazing. The only thing I changed was not adding salt. (Mainly because I forgot..) and because my microwave is 1100 watt I changed the time on it a little bit but other than that.. perfect!! Will be making this again very soon to fill up tins as christmas presents. Mmm!!

Best peanut brittle ever! My husband does not like sugary treats, but he could not stop eating this stuff! I opted to cook everything a little on the long side to have it "well done", but did not have any issue with burning. The candy does set up fast, so after you mix in the baking soda, be ready to pour quickly!

It turned out great!  I had an abundance of peanuts that I had to use, and I loved it!  As far as one of the comments saying that it burnt, well it's supposed to, because the sugar is caramelized.

This is a great recipe I got great results first time out. I love allrecipes web site for all the reviews. I took the advise and reduced cooking time by thierty seconds on each step, for the newer more powerful microwaves. And also took the advise about warming the cookie sheet for easier spreading. So easy to follow and very simple instructions, much easier than standing and stirring and worrying about reaching 300 degrees on a candy thermometer and worrying about scorching! This is a winner!

Thank you! My hubby loves peanut brittle, but every time I've bought it for him, we were both disappointed by the flavor and the pittance of peanuts! I was able to whip this up in minutes for one of his Christmas gifts. Truly awesome, easy & delicious!

tried making this peanut brittle in microwave...my microwave is 1300 watts and I only microwaved it 3 minutes each step and found it was not totally ruined but cooked more than it should have been....next time I'll try doing it 2 minutes each step and see what happens.

I made 2 batches in the time it would have taken to make one on the stove top.. wonderful!  Followed the recipe and times exactly as written except I used an extra 1/2 cup of peanuts.  I spread it out on a dry piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet.

This came out GREAT!!! Love-it easy as any thing I have made. Will make every year from now on. I did shorten up cooking times by 30 seconds each worked fine.

This is my 3rd holiday season making this peanut brittle.  I used to spend hours over the stove trying to get it right and it never turned out right.  This is absolutely perfect!!! in "my" microwave.  I don't know what power it is, but I follow the recipe to a T and it always makes perfect brittle.  Yummy is what this is...thank you for sharing!

The first batch got too brown. I cut the time down to a total of 9 minutes for the second batch, checking at 15 sec intervals. I also didn't add peanuts until after the first four minutes!

Mine burned during the 3 1/2 mins of cooking.. And I didn't consider my microwave to be a high powered one. I know it can be good because I used to make this years ago but lost my recipe.

Love how easy it is and it taste great. The only down fall is trying to spread thin but not that big of a deal, and I always put just a little extra peanuts in it.

The best peanut brittle EVER! I got it right on my first try and it was perfect! You do have to be quick when you are ready to pour! I took some other reviewers advice and did it in a 4 cup glass measuring cup. Excellent!

This is a great no fail recipe.  I make it every year for Christmas gifts.  I have to get it out of the house or I would make myself sick eating it.  I treat myself to the small bits left when I break it into pieces.  It is so much easier to make than a cooked version with raw peanuts and tastes great.  Thank you.

Wow I just found out something.  At what voltage microwave was this recipe concieved?  I just tried this year with my New Samsung above the over Microwave and I ended up with burnt brittle.  I followed the times to a tee...It is such an easy and fun recipe.

I just had to alter the microwave times a little bit for my microwave, but it came out PERFECTLY the first time. 4 minutes, then 3 minutes, then 50 seconds. Put my bowl straight into a tub of really hot soapy water and about ten minutes later I checked it and it didn't have anything stuck to it, too. Talk about an easy recipe.

Loved it! super easy...this was my 1st time making brittle and it is so good I have to make another batch soon...  I did follow the hints about adjusting the cooking time... lowered the 2nd round in microwave from 3.5 min to 3 because I was afraid it may burn... also used warm cookie sheet and tilted the sheet to let the candy spread out on its own...

This was so easy and delicous! I sprayed the cookie sheet with Pam, kept a measuring cup with really hot water on hand to stick my spoon in between stirs (to keep the candy from sticking) When you pour the mixture on the cookie sheet, it's easier to tilt the pan back and forth to spread out.  Becareful when pouring it though- the steam will get ya!  Great recipe!

Instant classic in my family.  We couldn't believe that microwave brittle would be anything like the real thing but we were proven wrong and pleasantly surprised!!  I just need to tweak out  the times for the correct flavor that we like.

I was very skeptical on this recipe but was pleasantly surprised!  Next time though, I'll use raw peanuts - some of the peanuts burned a little but it's still delicious!

I have been told making microwave peanut butter is hard and this was not exception to that.  I tried it a couple of times, it could have been me, could have been my microwave, or it could have been that making peanut brittle in the microwave is just hard.  Good luck to anyone who tries this. ;o) I am giving it 3 stars, good directions, good ingredients, good comments.  helpful comments. ;o)

I made this today for the first time but after reading the reviews I decided to set my 1580 watt microwave setting at 7 and it turned out absolutely perfect.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make it over and over again.  It is so simple it is amazing.

This was really tasty!  I mainly made it for my dad and he LOVED it!  My mom liked it also and she isn't a huge fan of peanut brittle.  Really simple instructions, no need for a candy thermometer of you don't have one.  I'm so glad I found it.  Simply wonderful!

Extremely fast and easy and everyone LOVED it.  I made some with almond slices, others with macadamia nuts(these were a huge hit) and others with mixed nuts.  Once you figure out the correct cook times for your microwave its a breeze!

My brother and dad went crazy over this recipe. I have made many batches already and it has been two days. Test with your microwave because the perfect times for my brittle were different than  recipe. I used spanish peanuts instead and added a little salt to them. The hardest part was really the clean up. Does anyone have bright ideas of how to make this part easier?

I love this recipe!! I use raw spanish peanuts and they work very well. Be sure and work quickly when adding each ingredient. I also use a glass mixing bowl with a handle. I think it's really important for people that may not know, this mixture gets very, very hot. Clean up is very easy also if you soak the bowl in hot tap water for about 10 minutes. I make many batches of this around the holidays, everyone loves it!

This is the frst time I have made any kind of brittle, so I had no clue what to expect. I made this exactley how it said. You do have to work fast, it starts to set up rather quickly, In all stages...lol. I was really concerened that my bowl would not be usable anymore. After all was done, the brittle is terrific, my bowl came nice and clean after a nice little soak. I love this brittle. I have shared with some peeps and they said it to be the best to! The hubby wants me to try adding cinnamin or red pepper to it...not sure about that one though!

Didn't work at all for us!  I read one review that said to put parchment paper down so we did and it completely stuck to the brittle.  It had a really great flavor but never got hard.  It stayed chewy which was okay with us but when we broke it up and put it in a container over night.  I woke up to a big glob of peanut brittle!  Maybe I'll have to try it again since the other reviews were so wonderul, but our first try was a huge failure!!!

I make the recipe every year... I cook it first for 5 minutes till it "lightly"  brown, add the butter and vanilla and cook 2 minutes more before adding the baking soda.    This recipe is fast, easy and comes out perfect every time.  I will never waste my time and energy trying to cook on the stove to the "perfect" temperature again.  Especially because it tastes exactly the same.

I've used this recipe for years, never fails.  I prefer cashews or pistachio nuts so I usually use them instead of peanuts.  So easy and you don't have to wait for the candy thermometer!

Wonderful in the microwave! I had made a batch cooking it on the stove and it did not set right for me and had to throw it out. I tried this microwave method and it was quick, easy and delicious.

This is SO easy and a great recipe.  However, I recently tried this with reduced calorie corn syrup and it did not work. The brittle won't set so make sure to use regular corn syrup.

This stuff is amazing and so easy to make. I used cashews instead of peanuts because that was what I had handy. I have a 1200 watt microwave so I just adjusted the time down for each step and it worked fine. It was a huge hit with everyone I gave it to for Xmas and my father-in-law has requested that I make it weekly for him! I lined a cookie sheet with baking parchment and lightly sprayed it with PAM. I highly recommend having a silicone spatula that can withstand the higher temperature that this generates!

This was my first time making this and it turned out fantastic. I read alot of reviews and it seems alot of people have high wattage microwaves, so if your reading my review be sure to check your watts on your microwave so you don't burn it. I liked the idea of microwave peanut brittle, less chance of me burning it on the stove specially with all that sugar.
My family all loved this recipe and it will definitly get made again in my house.

This is great.
I made some mods for my 950 watt microwave and unsalted peanuts after burning the peanuts first go-round:
- Cook the sugar/syrup mixture for 3:45
- Cook the peanuts for 3:00
- Cook the vanilla/butter/scant 1/4 teaspoon of salt for 1:15
Mix in the baking soda and immediately pour into well-greased cookie sheet.
The advice to keep hot water ready to soak the bowl and implements is very sound.

This is fantastic peanut brittle. I only did the microwave twice, i omitted the last nuke it needed, and its sooo good. I'm actually working on my third batch right now! I plan to bag it up and hand it out instead of christmas cookies this year. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Oh.. but be careful i did touch my finger by accident trying to scoop it out and it burned the tip pretty good.

Very yummy!  I would definately recommend making this in a 4 cup glass measuring cup to control where you're pouring the hot mixture!  I prefer it with sea salted cashews!

I can't keep this stuff in the pantry when I make it! This year, I'm planning 3 batches, and I'm sure it still won't get me through until Christmas.  The bonus is that it's super easy and doesn't use the oven (which is already on overdrive during the holidays).

I had never made Peanut Brittle before, but after seeing it at a candy store and not wanting to pay $8 for it (I guess it's "seasonal" around here b/c I could not find any to buy anywhere else), I decided to make some myself.  I followed the directions exactly.  My microwave is 850 watts.  It did not burn, however, I kept an "eye" on it while it was cooking just in case.  The only thing I did wrong was put it on wax paper and it STUCK to the paper :((  I'm still trying to get it off. (I don't want to throw it all out) :)  Be sure and use a greased cookie sheet like the directions state!  Also, mine was not as dark as I would have liked, but I do not own a candy thermometer so this was an easy way to make it.  It hardened up pretty quickly and was not chewy.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm looking forward to making it again for the holidays.

My mother in law uses this recipe and it is to die for! Like another reviewer said, though, it should only be made once a year, otherwise we would all gain an obscene amount of weight because we cant stop eating it!!

Very simple and easy - just be sure to keep an eye on the mixture.  I made these at a friend's house this year and had to dump the first batch because her microwave is higer wattage than mine and it burned.

The first 2 batches I made of this turned out perfect.....no one could believe how good it was since it was cooked in the microwave.  Well, I guess it was beginner's luck, because the 3rd batch burned & the 4th batch wasn't cooked enough!  I wish I would've paid attention to the times I used on the first 2 batches because now I can't replicate it.  I'll keep trying though, because it's worth it!

Be aware that the cooking times recommended vary greatly with the power of your microwave.  I burned the first batch badly using the recipe directions; after experimentation (and a couple more unusuable batches) cut times down to 3:15, 3:15, and 1:15.

timing was good. You should use a Pyrex bowl in the microwave. It really helps to have an "elf"! Many hands make light work.

I love this recipe. Foolproof even for ME! The peanut brittle itself is fine, but not amazing. The only thing I would say is that it doesn't make a lot per recipe. If you are making it to give away at holiday time, as i did, each recipe makes about enough for two small hostess gifts, but each gift might serve five or six.

This came out soft.  I was very disappointed.  Someone told me never to make peanut brittle when it rains.  It was raining when I baked it.  Of course, I may not be the microwave baking type. I'm going to try it on the stove top next time.  Geez, what a waste of butter and sugar!

Can't get any easier than this! I have never made peanut brittle; this was my first attempt. Took me a whopping 10 minutes, and the results were fantastic!!! I used 2 Tbs. butter as other suggested. Easily peeled off the baking sheet. Much better than any brittle I've tried in the past. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I have made this peanut brittle since the 1980's and I have had to adjust the cooking times to coincide with the microwave I had at the time. Watch it closely the first time if it starts to darken to much adjust the times next time. It has always turned out good for me and I am requested to make it every year.

Terrific brittle! It's tasty and easy to make. The only tip I would suggest is : WORK fast, as it can cool and harden quickly. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Very good. I actually added 1/2 cup of cashews along with the peanuts to recipe and it seemed to be fine. very nutty. cools very fast though so next time I have to work quicker. I had amy daughter in my arms and it took longer and so it didnt flatten out quite as much as it should have, but tasted wonderful. will be using for Christmas with stepkids and for gifts.

Candy in a microwave! Who would have thought?? This was a delicious recipe! I made it for Christmas gifts and everyone LOVED it! Like one reviewer said...do NOT use a plastic bowl. Also, I did have to lower the cooking time as I have a powerful microwave. It came out perfect though! No gooey mess here, just beautiful brittle!

This is a very easy peanut brittle recipe.  I think that it would work even better if you used a glass pot with a handle (like Visions cookware).  That was the only problem I ran into.....the glass mixing bowl is so hot to handle.  The peanut brittle has a great taste and is not too hard to chew.

I burned my batch, but that was my fault, as I stuck the mixture in for a little extra time because I was convinced it wasn't going to be brown enough.  Well, it definitely was.  At the stage before adding the baking soda, it was very light, but as soon as the soda went in - BOOM, almost instantaneous darkening.  So next time, I'll follow the recipe (aside from adding a bit more baking soda for a lighter brittle), and I'm sure this will be excellent.  Even the burnt batch isn't so bad, so I know that one done properly will be out of this world.

Mmmmm, I know where I went wrong. I followed this recipe perfectly and the brittle never completely set. It was too sticky, gooey, and chewy, not crispy at all.

I followed the recipe perfectly, but my "Brittle was burnt!" I didn't realize something could burn in the microwave. And I was so looking forward to this recipe.

This peanut brittle turned out perfectly for me.  It was fast and easy to prepare and was BETTER than the peanut brittle I've made before the old-fashioned way.  I brought some in to work and it was gone in no time!

This recipe is absolutely delicious a great hit, and so easy to make. No more boiling sugar hooray! So glad I found it. The only thing I had to do is adjust the microwave time by 30sec.
