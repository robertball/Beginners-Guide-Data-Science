Yes if you use egg roll wraps, they are egg rolls; use lumpia wrappers, you can even buy them now in local markets, just ask!  They are much better and less doughy, in my opinion.  Also, I am more used to the lumpia with cabbage, carrots, onions, garlic, and etc. with the potatoes.

This is a good recipe.  My family's is similar.  We use cabbage, carrots, onions, garlic, bean sprouts and potatoes along with the ground beef.  Sometimes we'll throw in some julienne green beans.  I also think they are better with lumpia wrappers, but if all you can find are egg roll wrappers, they are a decent substitute.  The great thing about lumpia is you can make the filling to your taste.  Ask anyone one from the Philippines and they'll tell you that every family has their own version of lumpia, adobo, pancit or any dish for that matter.

Yay! for anybody making lumpia at home. Sometimes it can be kind of tedious. But yes, lumpia wrappers are definitely the way to go. Also in my opinion, it's a little strange to use potatoes in them. Stick to the traditional recipe :)

It can not be called "lumpia" unless you actually use lumpia wrappers.  Lumpia wrappers are incredibly thin, and turn out very crispy.  Egg roll wrappers are MUCH thicker, and have a completely different taste.  My advice for anyone making this recipe is to go to your local asian food market, and buy "lumpia wrappers."  You will NOT be upset about it.  THey are cheap and delicious!

I don't use Lumpia wrappers. I use MenloÂ® brand wrappers which are a good all around wrapper. I think with this recipe you could omit the potato and add more meat and veggies. They still tasted good.
