Very good recipe.  The only suggestion that I have is that the vinegar is very strong when you first mix it.  If you can make it the day before and let it mellow, use all of the vinegar, but if you need to use it right away, I would cut down on the amount of vinegar.

There are no words for how many times I've tried to make my own version of this and failed miserably. Okay, we can start with "too salty" and "just plain wrong", but after that it's just a mess of tears and failure.  THIS RECIPE IS PERFECT. If I had to say that there's anything wrong with it, it's that it's so good, I literally want to put it on everything. In addition to traditional chicken satay, I thin it with a little oil for salad dressing, use it as a dip for chicken nuggets, vegetables, crackers, bread, fingers, the palm of my hand, etc.... Quick lunch? Pour this bad boy sauce into a bowl of cooked spaghetti noodles. Oh yeah, I've done it. And I'll do it again, too.

Thanks for the review from RobertaB.  She pointed out I forgot a critical ingredient when I posted the recipe to all recipes.  The recipe should include 3 TBS of soy sauce I have contacted AllRecipes to have the recipe corrected.  I'm not sure how I missed adding this before posting.  Thanks for enjoying the recipe.

This is a great start but I felt like it needed something.  I added 3T of Soy Sauce, a handful of chopped cilantro and substituted water for the olive oil.  Served it tossed with whole wheat noodles and topped with sauteed broccoli, red peppers and onion.  Excellent!

I used this to make Thai Chicken Pizza from this site and substituted lime juice for the rice vinegar.  I love, love, love this.  Can't wait to try it on noodles.

I will admit - my husband wanted to eat this with a spoon! When I first tasted it, I wasn't all that impressed, but when I started eating it with the chicken satay I made - YUM!! Next time I will make it a bit spicier - was a little mellow with the red pepper because of the kids, they didn't really like it, so more of a kick it will have next time. Thank you for this great sauce, it was awesome! Thrilled I could be the first to review it!

This was WAY easy and delicious! I just added some fresh squeezed lime just because I had some on hand. It really brought out the tangy-ness of the ginger.

YUM!  I served this to go over the Vietnamese Meatballs.  It was a great combination.  I wanted a bit more kick to the sauce, so I added a bit of dried basil & some curry spice.  I also heated the sauce before serving over the meatballs.  This one's a keeper!

Simple and Tasty! I have tried a few recipes and bottles for this and this is by far the best. Try this for a quick dinner. Boil linguini as directed, during the last two minutes if cook time, add shredded carrots and julienned pea pods, strain and pour peanut sauce over the top. Add chopped peanuts. YUM!

I substituted thai chili sauce for the hot sauce. The sauce seemed a little too thin when I first made it, so I added a tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter. But, by the evening when I served it, it had thickened up and I had to add a little soy sauce to thin it out. Definitely let it sit and thicken before adjusting the recipe. I served it with chicken and it was tasty. I'll probably try the leftover sauce on noodles.

Delicious. I subbed 1/8 tsp. ground ginger and used the sauce with one pound of whole wheat linguine, and sauteed shallots, snap peas, mushrooms, and grated carrots. Great flavor. Next time, I would double the sauce.

I enjoyed this a lot, using what I had, like reduced fat peanut butter mixed with almond butter and chopping up some almonds to take the place of crunchy peanut butter.  Fresh Ginger is best for sure. It went well with diced chicken and multi-grain fettuccine with chopped broccoli for color and nutrition. A few mushrooms and some diced onion helped provide more of a balanced meal in one. Update: Another way I love to use this is as a Pizza Sauce. Goes very well w/ Thai Chicken Pizza on this site. Also, I don't think it's designed as a dipping sauce. 5 stars for a non dipping sauce w/ great flavor...pasta, pizza, Flatbread and also RAMEN noodles which are a fun alternative. Grate some carrots, add chopped Broc florets and chopped green onion...change up on my usual pasta. Feel free to add a dash of fish sauce and or Hoisin sauce for added flavor.

I tried to use this recipe as a dipping sauce seeing as so many reviews said you could eat it with a spoon and found that the garlic, ginger and cayenne really overpowered the peanut flavor.  Would probably be good to marinate and cook with, but wasn't so great as a straight dipping sauce.

This was really good :) I love vinegar so I found the amount to be just right. I did add a squirt of siracha to it to add some heat

Pretty darn good, the texture was great, most peanut sauces get lumpy (probably because this one is not cooked). I added another 1/4 cup peanut butter because it was too sweet as is. Next time, I think I would cut the honey in half or so and still add more peanut butter and maybe some chopped peanuts. Great on chicken and noodles!

As written (with the soy addition) it was a little too salty, but with a little added peanut butter it was awesome!

I used this sauce for a thai chicken pizza. It was great!  We topped with julienne carrots, snow peas, broccoli, chicken, peanuts, and pepperjack. Yum!

After the fact, I realize the submitter wanted more peanut flavor... because that was the only thing I was going to say, my bf and I agreed it was a little much. Still, a great homemade recipe! Next time I'd probably use a little less of both the honey and PB to suite our preferences. Overall fantastic!!

Great with noodles and chicken.  I used chili paste instead of the red pepper flakes for a little extra heat.

I modified it a bit when I made it, and it turned out great! Instead of rice vinegar, I used the juice of 1/2 a large lime. Instead of pepper flakes, I used a teaspoon of chili sauce. I also added the zest of an entire lime. I used this as a dressing for coleslaw (shredded cabbage, carrot, red bell peppers, green onion, cilantro, toasted sesame seeds, chopped peanuts).

Oh, my! This stuff is the BEST.  We just had hot pot for New Year's Eve and I made this as a dipping sauce for the chicken and pork...I can't tell you which one we liked better, as both were awesome. (My 12-year-old son was drenching his meat in it)  I was out of rice vinegar, so used lime juice as suggested by many with wonderful results.  It is VERY IMPORTANT to let this sit for a few hours to meld the flavors.  When I was mixing it, I didn't feel the taste was that spectacular...so happy to be wrong!

I tasted this and decided to add some sriracha sauce and some crushed peanuts instead of crunchy peanut butter. I used it  on some chicken satay pizzas.

I thought this recipe was tasty. I mixed it up with Ramen noodles (used the beef ones w/out the beef packet). I definitely didn't need more peanut butter (PB) flavor. I like the PB flavor to be there but not overpowering. I didn't add any crunchy PB (just not what I prefer, but if you want texture variation, go for it.) I added the 1/4 cup of creamy PB, and it was plenty for me. It's a very rich tasting sauce. Next time I'll add some veggies or meat to my dish to dilute the strong flavor. But if you're someone who likes the PB to be strong, add it to your taste. I did eat this right after making it and didn't find it to be bitter. If you're worried about that, add half of the rice vinegar then taste it before you add more. Very good recipe and very versatile - add or take away what works with your preferences.

This was very good!  I reduced the rice vinegar to 1 Tablespoon as another reviewer recommended (I was using it right away).  I served this with skinless chicken breasts, carrots and onions that I had cooked in some olive oil.  All served over whole grain spaghetti.  The kids gobbled it up!  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this sauce to go with fresh spring rolls. Because I did not have any rice vinegar I used 1 Tbs white vinegar and 1 Tbs red wine vinegar. Making a bunch of different sauces for our meal tonight, this was by far the most popular and will be made again! :D Thank you for a delicious recipe.

EASY and good.  I took the advice of others and used lime juice but also added the rice vinegar.  We also added about 1/2 t. Pampered Chef Asian seasoning and a dash of of garam masala and cinnamon.   My son said he thinks he'll add some hot oil in place of the olive oil when he makes again as he likes it hotter.

Excellent, I followed the advice of other reviews and only used one tablespoon of rice vinegar, and to cut down on the fat I used 2 tablespoons of water and one tablespoon of evoo (becasue I didn't have any sesame oil). Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Wow!  This is perfect.  Really.   I made this just as written except added about 1/8 t. of ginger since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  As other reviewers suggested, I also laid off the vinegar a little, adding 1 1/2 tablespoons.

My foodie son said "Don't lose this recipe Mom!"  Really good and takes chicken to a new place.  We try to eat healthy so are always looking for new ways to change up chicken.  Used half as marinade on grilled chicken.  Warmed other half and poured over spaghetti noodles.  Followed reciped to a T except used lime juice instead on vineager. Great way to add something different to your rotation.  Just try it!

I made this as a stir-fry sauce for vegetables over coconut rice (1 cup leftover coconut milk, 1 cup water, 1 cup rice - cook - done) and it was a complete hit! My only adjustment was that I added an extra tbls of soy sauce and upped the 1/4 cup of peanut butter to 1/3 cup. Super delicious and easy meal.

This was a great balance between peanut, sweet, and hot. Very creamy too. I used low sodium soy sauce and ginger paste from a jar. I used this to make peanut noodles and it was perfect! Thanks.

This will be my staple peanut sauce. Unfortunately I was out of everything so if my subs turned out this great I can only imagine how following the recipe perfectly would turn out. 

I used almond butter, maple syrup, and apple cider vinegar for the peanut butter, honey, and rice vinegar. I prefer mine a little spicier so I sprinkled in some dried ground chipotle. 

Tremendous!

Fantastic. I made it exactly the way it asked me to, but added a teaspoon or so of lime juice. It was too sweet for me other wise. Mixed it with linguini, snow pea pods, carrots, and scallions for a DELICIOUS meal. Definitely recommend it to anyone. Very easy to make.

Great recipe. I had some already spiced peanut butter so didn't need the ginger and pepper flakes. Used the garlic, added agave nectar instead of honey and no sesame oil because I didn't have any. It came out great!

This sauce is so delicious.  I served it as a dipping sauce for asian lettuce wraps.  It tasted sooo good! I used only crunchy peanut butter, and loved the texture of that.  I also used water instead of the oil, and it was perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I replaced the ginger root with some thai sweet chili sauce. Also, instead of chunky peanut butter (which was optional), I added crushed peanuts.  At the suggestion of others, I added some chopped basil.  I served this with rice noodles, tofu, and veggies.  This is definitely a keeper!

I rarely take the time to write a review, but this recipe is worth it!  I made lettuce wraps for my moms birthday celebration. I whipped up the recipe, tried it and knew immediately that I would need to double the batch.   Everyone loved it!  Great balance of flavor.  And super simple.  No cooking and basic ingredients that most people would have on hand.  Thanks you so much!

Absolutely fabulous!  I didn't have rice vinegar on hand, so I used champagne vinegar. Also cut corners on time and used garlic powder and ginger. It's true - we wanted to finish it up by eating the sauce with a spoon!

Pretty good.  A little on the thicker side.  You can omit soy sauce for coconut amino acids to cut down on amount of soy.  Also omit peanut butter for sunbutter/almond butter if you are allergic to peanuts.

I eat a lot of Peanut sauce and after I made a few alterations it turned out amazing! (Don't let the colour scare you) 
Used a little less honey then stated, used more chunky peanut butter then creamy, and at the end of it used around 3/4 cups peanut butter, maybe more. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead. I used sesame oil for all the oil parts instead of olive. 
I did it all for personal preference, and I will definitely use this again!

really good, but a little too sweet for me. I use half of the honey. I also add red pepper, carrot, and celery, and rice noodles to make Peanut Udon.

We loved this! I served it over chicken and rice with a ring of broccoli.  I used 1/2 cup extra crunchy peanut butter and omitted the peanut topping seen in some photos.

This is outstanding! I have been making your recipe now for more than 1 year and my (6-year-old) daughter and I leave NONE in the pan at the end of dinner. I stuff myself with food just to excuse having more sauce!  I omit red pepper flakes and use only creamy peanut butter but leave the rest as is.  Delish!

Love this sauce.  Use it on Thai chicken pizza, noodles, veggies. I now keep all the ingredients on hand to whip up a batch whenever I want.  Thanks!

Love this sauce! I omit both the oils and use a little less PB to make it lower fat, but it's still delicious, easy and versatile. Good with noodles, and I often serve it over any sort of steamed veg (makes bland vegetables taste great) and brown rice with curry-seasoned chicken. Agree with the riesling pairing, would be good with any aromatic, hi-acidity white; I had it with a fruity tempranillo the other day which was good, too.

This recipe was fabulous! I made it just as the recipe stated. It was great drizzled over the shrimp and veggie lettuce wraps I had made. The recipe tasted just like at our favorite local Thai Restaurant. I will defiantly make again and incorporate it into other dishes. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was not THAI peanut sauce...It was DISAPPOINTMENT SAUCE. We eat authentic Thai food at least once a week and I thought because of the ratings this might compare...it did not.

YUM! Was a bit worried when combining the ingredients at the proportion of everything but wow perfect perfect. I just added extra ginger and garlic. Delish! Sauteed shrimp in sesame oil with red pepper flakes and chopped onion, stir fried with rice noodles, some of this sauce and a little bit of water for a perfect pasta dish. Wasnt expecting much really out of this sauce but what a great zing! Doesnt just taste like boring peanut butter!!

Fabulous! I highly recommend as did another reviewer, to let this sit to mellow the vinegar. I used it on chicken.The posibilities are endless. I think this would make an awesome salad dressing for an oriental type salad. mmmmm

Followed the recipe exactly but it had too much honey for me... I used raw organic honey so it is very powerful. I will make this again but will cut back on the honey add just a splash more rice vinegar for a little more acidity.

Very simple, very easy and better than any other peanut sauce I've tried. I'm not a huge fan, but my daughter LOVES it, so this was for her. Great on chicken satay over rice. Thanks for a perfect recipe for a quick peanut sauce!

This is the first peanut sauce I've made that didn't require cooking. I couldn't believe how fast, easy, and delicious it was! I appreciated the fact that it called for honey instead of any sugar. I used bottled ginger root and put it through the garlic press. Worked like a charm. Made it for chicken satay, and used the leftovers on pasta. Mmmm! THANKS for the great recipe!

This is a great peanut sauce.  I followed the recipe at first, just cutting back on the olive oil to 1 tbsp.   After tasting, the flavor was great, but I wanted a thicker consistency.  For those that are complaining about this being thin, simply stir in more peanut butter a teaspoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached.   Quick, easy, and very tasty!

This recipe came out great! I read someone said it was very strong with the rice vinegar so I tried regular vinegar and low salt soy. It came out just fine. I doubled the peanut butter for more flavor and added about a half a cup of low salt chicken stock until it was the consistency I wanted. The recipe doesn't say to  cooked it in a pan first but I decided to on low. This is a keeper. I also found the rice noodles in stop & shop in various widths.

Very tasty!  I added some cauliflower and onion for vegetables, and mixed it with some spicy sesame linguine.  I would recommend using a mild honey, since I used a dark melter honey in the sauce ended up tasting more like honey than peanut butter despite having 1/2 cup of peanut butter.

This was a delicious peanut sauce to go with our chicken satay tonight. I poured the extra over noodles; we didn't like that, but that's irrelevant as we never have really liked the peanut butter sauces on noodles. This made a delicious dipping sauce and I'd definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  I only made 1 tweak: because I was going for a sweet taste, I only added 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce, rather than 3 tablespoons of regular soy sauce.  It turned out incredible, and I used it over a tofu/veggie stir-fry!

Really great sauce - love it!  Does anyone know if it requires refrigeration? I prefer not to refrigerate it so it doesn't thicken, but I'd like to know what others think.

I would not suggest removing the vinegar - it adds just the right amount of zip!  The recipe can obviously be played with to adjust for the amount of heat and spices as per individual taste - but the recipe "as is" is terrific!!

I made a few minor changes.  I used fresh ground peanut butter with no added sugar or salt.  I left out the garlic and I used 2tbs.sesame oil and 1tbs olive oil.  I threw it all in the blender and it came out great.

Wish I could give it 10 stars, this is amazing stuff! I added a little more peanut butter just to thicken it and I really love the peanut flavor, otherwise this was an absolutley perfect recipe! Thanks a million!!!

Too much vinegar.  Too much oil.  Garlic does not belong in peanut sauce, nor ginger in these amounts.  Yuck!  Wasted a bunch of ingredients.  Going back to my PB-hoisin peanut sauce w/enough coconut milk to thin.

This is really good, but being a nut free home ( my son is allergic to peanuts), I used Sunflower butter instead or peanut butter and it came out great, can't even tell it's not peanut butter.   Made the whole recipe and there was none left.

Really yummy.  Like others suggested, I used warm water in place of the olive oil and natural peanut butter (no sugar), so it wasn't too sweet.  I used crunchy peanut butter for a little texture and extra chilies for a bit more heat.  This will definitely be my 'go to' peanut sauce recipe.

This was very yummy! I used this sauce to make the "Thai chicken pizza" from this site (which is also very good by the way). I used all the honey and didn't find it too sweet, but that was likely because I used natural peanut butter (just crushed peanuts - no added sugar). I will use this for any recipe that calls for peanut sauce.

Didnt give 5 stars because it was a little too sweet. I only added 1/2 the oil, but I should have only added half the honey. Other than that, it was really good, I served with chicken satay.

My family and I love the strong peanut flavour.  I have used this recipe more times then I can remember.  I usually use chopped peanuts instead of crunchy peanut butter, cut the amount of soy sauce in half as I find it a bit salty and use less vinegar then recommended as it is a bit strong.  Great sauce!

Quick and Easy.  I didn't have rice vinegar so I used regular vinegar and thought it couldn't be better.  I tossed my chicken and stir fry veggies in it.  Then served over rice.  YUM YUM YUM!

I made this exactly as written, including the optional crunchy peanut butter, but went light on the spice, for the sake of my kids. WONDERFUL!! Peanutty, but with a nice kick. I'm using it with Vietnamese Spring Rolls, from this site.

This was really, really good! Made it for a friend with the Thai honey peanut sauce on this site and was not disappointed. I did increase (well, almost doubled) the hot pepper sauce and just used canola oil because I didn't have sesame but it was fabulous! Will make again!

Very good recipe.  I used the ingredients as listed. Instead of mixing in a bowl, I used a saucepan and heated the mixture to gentle boil, whisking constantly. It seemed a bit easier than mixing in a bowl.

I LOVE this sauce!  I've made this sauce so many times with different things.  I love it on my chicken, zucchini noodles, spaghetti noodles, dumpling dip, and so on.  I don't normally use the crushed red pepper though because I don't like things with that kick, but I have tried it both ways and it's delicious.

I've tried a few peanut sauces and this one was excellent. Some of them are overwhelming in the peanut flavour department and this one was a nice combination of flavours. Highly recommended! This will be my go-to recipe for peanut dipping sauce. Thank you for a great recipe.

I didn’t use the olive oil because I browned the chicken breasts in EVOO. It was delicious and a big hit. I will be trying out this delectable sauce in other ways too.

This peanut sauce is AMAZING and so simple to make!! I've made it multiple times and is my go-to when I have tofu and rice noodles on hand. Also top with fresh cilantro and peanuts when I have them.

10.20.18  I made this to use as a dipping sauce for Bulgogi Meatballs (a recipe also on this site), and since this was so thick, I did add more soy sauce and rice vinegar to thin iit out and even a bit more sesame oil.  It’s so thick that regardless of what I’d serve this with, it still would need to be thinned out.  Nice taste, though.

This tastes great! I used half rice vinegar based on comments. My husband found the teaspoon of red pepper flakes to be a bit spicy, but I loved it.

I made it exactly as suggested ... and tossed it into a bowl of pre-chopped broccoli cole slaw mix (2 small bags) from the grocery store. Wow! What a great side. Even kids loved it! Two people added more pepper flakes to their serving to spice up but I would not recommend doing it to the whole batch. Will definitely make again and again.

I've made it exactly to recipe and have also made it adding a little brown sugar.  Loved it both ways.  We use it in a chicken stir fry and it equals our favorite local thai restaurant.

This is really, really good! I used in a chicken and vegetable stir fry.
No need for rice since there was a huge mix of vegetables.. although I do believe my 7yr old granddaughter enjoyed just sucking the sauce off of her veggies! lol

Wouldn’t change a thing on this recipe - it’s the best. Sooo dang good, and sooo easy to make. We love it so much that sometimes we eat it a few dinners in a row. This sauce is perfect for mixing with noodles, tofu and seared vegetables.

This was absolutely delicious.  We loved it.  The photo shows it as much darker than mine came out....mine maintained the regular peanut butter shade.  
I didn't add in the crunchy peanut butter; we didn't have it. So I just added the additional amount with smooth.  I used garlic puree (I buy the minced garlic in the big plastic jars and use my food processor to blend up some of it to make a garlic puree for different recipes, I like the garlic thinner for different things and it is wayyy cheaper than buying garlic puree) and I used the minced ginger, both the garlic and the ginger are purchased in the produce departments of grocery stores or Walmart etc.  
Thanks so much for this recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious and is now our go to for sure.  Hubby said it was better than any purchased peanut sauce ever and rivals anything we have had when out.  
I am just going to play with the spiciness now to see what we like, but that is so personal, and just the preference in our home, everyone can play with their own levels....but this recipe as is, is a fabulous foundation if you want to play, or perfect the way it is for anyone.  
Enjoy!
Thanks again!!!

I needed a new peanut sauce recipe and this one knocked everyone's socks off!  I put the red pepper on the side for the sake of my 3 year old niece.  She liked it so much that she kept asking for more sauce and refused to mix it in with everything else.  I replaced the rice vinegar with apple cider vinegar.

Very tasty. Will make again soon.  Did not add crunchy pb or red pepper flakes. Added 3 tablespoons of lime juice and substituted toasted sesame seeds for sesame oil. Used it as a room temperature dip for skinless chicken thighs that had been marintated in soya sauce and lime juice and oven baked for about 40 mins at 350.

I was surprised how good this was with no cooking and no fancy ingredients.  I think it could have used some extra heat ,  maybe by adding 5 to 10 drops of hot sauce.  I used lime juice in place of the vinegar .

As others have noted, this needs to sit for a while to allow the flavors to meld, especially the ginger and garlic. The recipe should be edited to mention this. Also, as with most sauces, keep tasting and adjusting until it's just right. I added some PB and played around with the amounts of ginger and vinegar. Unfortunately I ran out of honey, which seemed to work better than the brown sugar I added as a substitute. But this is a winner, for sure.

It's so good that I couldn't stop tasting it. I'm sorry, I did make a couple changes. I thought there was too much peanut butter even without  the little bit of the crunchy. Try to use low sodium Soy. I added juice from 1/2 lime to cut the peanut butter and it was a good addition. Don't use more than 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes unless you can take the heat. Must use fresh ginger root.  Thank you.

I was very happy I found this recipe, it saved my dinner tonight. I didn't have any fresh ginger root,  substituting ground ginger instead..So the box Thai dinner turned out to be wonderful once I added this peanut sauce to it. This is a keeper..

This is one of my favorite peanut sauce recipes. Sometimes I make it exactly as written but other times I increase the peanut butter and replace the garlic and the pepper flakes with Thai garlic sauce which has both peppers and garlic. You can also replace the honey with brown sugar

I used this to brush on my chicken skewers, and as a sauce for them after they were barbecued. My family all loved the sauce, and I will make it again. I cut down slightly on the amount of rice vinegar based on a review that I had read, but that was the only change I made.

I have been experimenting with many peanut noodle recipes (trying to find the perfect one that I can remember having growing up!) 

I halved the rice vinegar (a bit strong) and I halved the crushed red pepper and ginger, and used about a quarter of the garlic. This is a VERY flavorful dish, perfect balance of spicy and creamy. My family enjoyed it - they do not eat much normally, but went back for thirds for this! 

Anyone should try this! They will love it.

Wow this is good! Note that it is a bit spicy.
As others suggested I cut the honey in half. Left it to sit all day (vinegar taste subsided and sauce got thicker).

I added it to noodles with chicken, tomato and chopped cilantro. Yummy!!!
Next time will add cucumber and chopped peanuts to the above. Sautéed veg would go nicely. Could sub noodles for bean sprouts.

Could use lime juice instead of rice vinegar if you are out.

Super Easy to make.  Stores in the fridge for a few weeks, and you can dilute it with a little water to make it into a Thai peanut salad dressing too!  Just added lettuce, fresh grape tomatoes, some shredded cabbage, shredded carrots,  and a handful of peanuts and some basil to garnish!

I doubled the recipie and omitted the olive oil as I added extra sesame oil. Everyone commented on the sauce saying how authentic tasting it is.  Make this the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight which improves the intensity of the flavours. Thanks for a great recipie:)

I added a little coconut milk to the mixture which added a nice flavor but thinned it out a bit; so if you don't mind a runny sauce, I'd recommend it. This had a great flavor and went very well with the thai spring rolls I made! Huge hit during our "girls night out" gathering!

I always have the ingredients on hand, so I do make this frequently.  Great as is without any changes. It is easier to blend if you heat it in the microwave for about 20 seconds.

Great flavor & kick! I took the garlic,ginger, added 2 green onions, & a can of sliced water chestnuts  a little sesame oil & just seared everything. Put that on top of 2 pkgs rice noodles that sat in warm water & drained. To this I added the remainder of the sauce & I used extra chunky peanut butter which gave the sprinkle of peanuts, perfection! Definitely make this again! ??

The best! At first it seemed like a lot of ingredients, but I had them all in the pantry. And it definitely is worth your time to go out and get anything you may be missing. This is the best peanut sauce I have ever had!

I planned to serve right away so I used 1/2 the vinegar as Kate G. mentioned. I noticed the sauce was extremely thick and the texture appeared gritty (I used all creamy PB) so I mixed 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch to 1 cup of cold water and added it to the recipe then simmered the sauce. It was awesome.

I wanted to make a peanut sauce for a dressing but didn't want to open a whole can of coconut milk for a little bit of sauce.  Came across this recipe...ooh, it's so good!  I added about 1/2T of fish sauce and killed 2 birds with one stone by using the asian-style chile garlic sauce instead of the garlic and red pepper flakes separately. I'll definitely be coming back to this one again!

This one is a keeper.  My wife and I have love going to Rumbi Island Grill and since we've started going to Rumbi, I have been in a search for something like their Bali Island peanut sauce. This one works very well... my wife's not a fan of heat, so I thought she would like it with only 75% of the red pepper flakes.  I'm sure she could have tolerated the the full 2 teaspoons.  If it was for me alone, I would have used 2 1/2 - 3 teaspoons.   This is just a personal adjustment and not a recipe fault. I did make this sauce the night before which helped the flavors mingle. 

Bottom line is if you like Thai food,  this would be a good sauce for you.

Amazing !!! Used it to marinate shrimp for a stir-fry.  Very tasty!! If you're going to use it for cooking though, I would suggest adding just a bit of water because it becomes super thick in the pan, but the taste is really good.  Everyone loved it!!!

AMAZING.  This is easily the best peanut sauce I've made.  I didn't have the fresh ginger so I subbed it for 1 tsp ground ginger and added a sprinkling of chives. I used this for chicken and noodles, used half the sauce to marinate the chicken and then tossed everything in the remaining sauce when it was done.  This is awesome cold as well.

Just came back from a weekend cooking school with my sister. The menu was all SE Asian. The recipe they gave us for their peanut sauce was lacking. It just tasted like watered-down peanut butter. I found this recipe and decided to try it. AMAZING!!!! Only made a few changes, left out the red pepper (wimpy family as far as hot/spicy goes) and used all crunchy peanut butter. I have to triple this. Great on beef/chicken satay and with spring rolls! Thanks for the awesome recipe. YUM,YUM,YUM!!!

This was a great recipe!  I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I used Braggs Apple Cider instead and it was great.  Also, to it's creator, Jeramyn, I am the same as you in that I love an intense peanut butter flavor, so next time you try this, add in some powdered peanut butter to ramp up the taste without affecting the volume of the recipe.  I think most grocery stores stock it now, even WalMart and Target.  Also, I like spice and love garlic, so I added a tablespoon of Chuloa's spicy garlic sauce to it.  Absolutely perfect!  Thanks!

This sauce is so easy to make and a killer in flavor. I made it for my annual winter party and had to give out the recipe twice. I served it with Asian Beef Skewers and it was a perfect match. I will be making this many times in the future.

Love how simple this recipe is, although the flavor was out of balance to me - way too sweet with that much honey, and I even cut it down to half.  I'd recommend 2-3 T honey if you like less sweet peanut sauce.   Thought the amount of peanut butter was right on!!  Thanks, Jeramyn.

Didn't have vinegar or sesame oil, added lemon juice instead and put in a touch of clam juice and cilantro. Sautéed some onions, then added mushrooms, peppers, carrots and pea's. Added sautéed shrimp at the end and then tossed it up with the veggies, and some rice noodles. I used the left over sauce on my salad. Ummmm ummm yum.

YUM!!!  Wonderful dip with raw vegetables (especially sweet peppers). Subbed Splenda for honey & 3 tablespoons water for 2 tablespoons olive oil. I throw all ingredients into the food processor & let it sit overnight before serving. This made it healthier & everyone loved it. I regularly keep this on hand w/ sliced raw vegetables as a healthy alternative to chips. Deserves more than 5 stars...definitely a must-try. :-)

I have made this many times and it is always yummy.  I use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce because I'm allergic to soy and it comes out great.  I also sometimes sub maple syrup when I don't have any honey.  I find the maple syrup version is better for cooking--doesn't burn as quickly and the honey version is better for dipping.  I use it as a dipping sauce for spring rolls, a marinade for Asian noodle salad and a chicken satay sauce.  It is best if made a few hours or a day in advance so the red pepper flakes and ginger have a chance to mellow.

Love this.  Absolutely fantastic.  I double it all the time and pour it over my stir-fry.  Personal preference, I add cilantro. I also often reduce the honey to a T or so to keep the carbs down.

I had no rice vinegar on hand, so used herb and garlic salad dressing instead. Stirred the finished sauce into cooked and drained whole-wheat macaroni, along with some sautéed vegetables (onion, green pepper and mushrooms) and 3 85g mini-cans of "Clover Leaf Tuna in Thai-Style Peanut Sauce".  Put the mixture into a casserole and heated for 30 mins in a 350 oven. Delicious!! Will never make any other form of tuna casserole again!

really nice sauce for a stir fry. I love that sweet and spicy combo. Just used this with a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and had it with brown rice for a delicious dinner. Thanks for sharing!

Wow is is good! I licked the bowl clean.  We ate this as a sauce for summer rolls.  I forgot the olive oil, but it doesn't really need it for a "stick to your food" sauce.  Will definitely be making this again!

This sauce is so delicious.  I made it last night and poured it over some chopped kale and cabbage for a crispy salad.  VERY good.  A little goes a long way because it's so flavorful.  I will definitely be using this with some chicken.  Also, very quick and easy.

I'm not a Thai fan, and yet, this recipe is very good.  I was being adventurous when I decided to make this meal and let me tell you how pleasantly surprised I was when it came  time to sit down and eat it.  It was fabulous.  I will be making this again, often and soon you better believe it. Thank you Jeramyn for sharing.

I made this recipe as posted, and it was delicious!!  This is how I made my whole dish: First stir-fried 2lb of chicken breast (cut into pieces) in a large wok and set aside.  In the meantime, add 14oz of dry rice noodles to a pot of boiling water and let soak 10 minutes.  Then stir fry 4 large julienned carrots, 1 clove of minced garlic, and 12 oz. of steamed sugar snap peas (from the freezer section; steam bags) in the empty wok.  When carrots are crisp-tender, dump in the softened noodles, cooked chicken, and a DOUBLE recipe of the peanut sauce.  Heat through.  Serve with sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  Even my 2-year-old liked this, but that's not too shocking considering the sugar content :)  This made a very large batch.  I'd say it could comfortably serve 6.

If I could give this 100 stars, I would! It's exactly what I need when I'm craving and I don't even need to do any cooking, just mix it all up. I do put the garlic in the microwave for a few seconds so it's not so spicy for the kids. I use this on my salads. PERFECT!! (Also, if I don't have ginger root, I use powdered ginger.)

Too much soy sauce.  Doesn't come close to any Thai Peanut Sauce I ever had and I LOVE Thai food.  No red curry paste and no coconut milk = not Thai Peanut Sauce.  Sorry.

I just made a stir-fry with this sauce for dinner, and it was amazing!! My family loved it! We're big into peanut butter and this had a great nutty flavor. I skipped the olive oil and added a little water. I also didn't have a red pepper flakes, so my sauce was definitely on the sweet side, but still SO GOOD! will definitely make again! so easy and yummy! thanks!

Great recipe and s big hit with the family! I added 8 oz of lite coconut milk and used it as a sauce for chicken, red pepper, baby corn & broccoli stir fry. Mixed in  some softened Thai noodles before serving. Could also be served over rice instead of noodles to soak up the wonderful sauce.

Amazingly good and easy! I stir fry mushrooms, spinach and tofu and heat the sauce with it toward the end. My 8 year old son loves it! You definitely need to let it sit for a bit or heat it and let it cool to set the vinegar settle though.

Very tastey, but not quite enough flavor for me. I added a little more peanut butter and ginger the 2nd time. My sister wasn't a huge fan, i liked it a lot, my mom loved it. Added chicken and some chopped red pepper.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The sauce has TONS more flavor and bunch than the store bought stuff. I made a thai chicken pizza with this and it came out spectacular. It is also nice as a salad dressing for an asian salad. Yummy! The only thing I added was a splash of lime juice. Did I say delicious? mmmm yummy!!!!!

I have been searching high and low for a great peanut sauce recipe and I finally found it here!  My only substitution was ginger and garlic powder rather than raw ginger and garlic. Since this sauce isn't cooked, I would saute the ginger and garlic first before adding to sauce or use the powdered form.  Also, I used The Magic Bullet to combine everything to the perfect consistency.  Serve with chopped peanuts on top.

Excellent and so easy!  I followed the recipe as written except for substituting safflower oil for sesame, because I did not have sesame oil.  As one reviewer suggested, a little squirt of lime juice added a nice tang.  My husband 'Mmmmm'ed the whole time he ate his peanut pad Thai.  I cooked some rice noodles and mixed them with this sauce, green onion, water chestnuts, carrot slices made with the vegetable peeler, and fried tofu.  Thank you Jeramyn!  This one will be made again!

I made this sauce to go with chicken satay I made on the grill.  The sauce had a great taste, and really added to the chicken.  I might thin it out just a little next time with water.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was very tasty and good even without the coconut milk. This was the reason why I chose the recipe to begin with, so I was pleasantly surprised all around - I did add the extra tablespoon of peanut butter!

What a great versatile recipe! I tossed this sauce with linguini noodles, then I added grilled chicken, and stir-fried carrots and green onions.  My kids loved it!  They said it was even better than their favorite Thai Chicken Pasta from Cheesecake Factory. This is definitely a keeper.

Very good...I used it to marinade some rabbit all day and then threw the whole thing in the oven for and hour and it was a hit.  Husband said when he seen me putting honey and peanut butter on his rabbit, he didn't know what he thought about that.  But it turned out to be a winner.  Thanks

This was a very easy sauce to make.  The flavor was good not great.  I used an organic, nothing added peanut butter.  I think I may have had better results with a standard peanut butter.  The vinegar flavor was a little strong before cooking but it was more mild afterwards.  I wanted a little bit more spice.  I would use this recipe again.

This was a fabulous recipe. I did switch out the olive oil for warm water. Makes it easier to mix and a little less oily. Also, I bought honey peanut butter so the honey was already added in. New favorite with rice noodles and as a spring roll dipping sauce. Love the ginger! Yum!

This is addicting!  I ended up needing to add a bit more peanut butter and honey (I think I had a very salty soy sauce), and my boyfriend would have eaten this with a spoon if he could.  Awesome...THANKS!

I loved it.  Of course, everyone makes a change.  I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  Just like it better.

Super delish!!  It would have been great written as is, but I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I took another reviewers suggestion and used half the amount of vinegar and used water for the other half.  I also did not have fresh ginger so I used ground and just guestimated.  I also doubled for stir fry.  My kids love it!!  They wanted it as a snack with veggies and apples...go figure!

I also used this sauce on a Thai Chicken Pizza, which I topped with bell peppers, shredded carrot, dry chinese noodles, and green onion. It was unbelievable! Everyone at the pizza party loved it and I will definitely try this sauce on kebobs or other dishes! Lime juice would be a good addition too.

Honey really transforms this sauce into something super tasty and special over other peanut sauces.  I loved the addition of a bit of crunchy peanut butter.

Excellent!  This is the first peanut sauce I've made and it's awesome!  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth.  I didn't have any sesame oil, so I just added in a tbs of water in place of it.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was fantastic. Great complex flavor. I normally don't like spicy food, but I can't resist this sauce. As a plus, it's a great, filling sauce and veggie dip for my vegan boyfriend (he still eats honey). I'll definitely make this again!

This is an excellent sauce. We used it to serve with Tofu Tod (a thai appetizer of fried tofu).  I added about a 1/4 c. water to thin it out enough for dipping and it was perfect. Thanks!

this recipe turned out pretty well! i did not put the amount that was asked for the rice vinegar. I actually just used less than a teaspoon of it, and used 1/2 a lime for acidity. i sauteed some veggies with butterflied shrimp with the shells on, and drizzled the peanut sauce on top of my plate of veggies. YUM!! thanks for this recipe!

Great sauce. Only a few minor adjustments to make it perfect for my taste. Since I was going to eat very soon after making it I cut the vinegar in half and I also added about an extra tablespoon of peanut butter. If you decided not to add the tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter then I would suggest you add 2 extra tablespoons.

This sauce was great!  I followed the recipe exactly but added crushed peanuts at the end for a little crunch.   Received a lot of compliments; thank you!

Awesome!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Does taste like it could use something extra (five spice powder?), but overall the perfect dipping sauce for chicken or whatever you need.

This was pretty darn good. I used it with my chicken sate, broccoli and rice noodle combo since it needed some sauce. It went great! Thanks for a keeper!

Absolutely delish.  I made this sauce for udon noodles, chicken, and broccoli.  I also added a little cilantro and chopped scallions on top.  Next time I make this I will add some peanuts for texture.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks so much!

Yum yum yum!  Put this over spaghetti noodles with sautéed carrots and onions.  Hubby and I loved it.  Only concern is that it was a little too thick...I added more soy sauce to my serving.

This is exceptionally good.  I found it a bit too sweet so next time I'd cut back on the honey a bit.  Plus, I added a bit of Vietnamese fish sauce to give it extra tang and counter the sweetness of the honey.  So yummy!!

This was fantastic just as it is with only one slight change...my wife and I like spicy and rather than add crushed red peppers, I added Sriracha (chili sauce).  Used this for a vegetable stir fry over udon noodles and it was GREAT!!!

I made two batches.  One for those who don't like spicey (leaving out the chilis) and one for others who like spicey.  I also mixed it up using our Vita-Mix blender.  Using the blender worked out great because it cooked the sauce a little bit and made it very smooth so much so that it almost looked like caramel.  I used the sauce for the Satay Chicken Pizza recipe I got from this site and they were the perfect compliments.  Our guests loved the dinner so much they asked for the recipe.

I followed this recipe minus the ginger and used powdered ginger instead.  I also used a handheld blender to make it creamier.  It is sooooo good and so easy to make.  Thank you.

I liked the sauce very much, I used it on chicken breasts and pasta with veggies and it made a nice quick meal. I gave it 4 stars because I reduced the servings to 4 and had enough for about 2 people, would not have been enough for more than two. The sauce has a nice flavor, I used JIFF peanut butter and grated ginger root.   Very nice, Thanks!

YUM!  I think the remarks about vinegar and some spices being too strong are really a matter of taste.  if you know you don't like something to be strongly flavoring your food, put less of that in!

this is a great base for a peanut sauce. my mom makes it with hoisin sauce, so i'm sure adding that in will taste more like the vietnamese-style peanut sauce. i also added lime with gives it a tangy taste. thanks for sharing.
