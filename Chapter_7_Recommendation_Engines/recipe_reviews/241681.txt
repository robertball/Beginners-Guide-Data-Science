Quick and easy salad. The dressing is too sweet for me. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar.

I reduced the sugar by half at the recommendation of another user and still found it a little too sweet. We ended up adding Durkee's crunchy fried onions because we wanted something to counteract the sweetness.
