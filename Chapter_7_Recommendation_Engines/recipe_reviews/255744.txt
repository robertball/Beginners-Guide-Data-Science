I cooked the peppers and onions then cooked the beef in the same pan after sitting veggies aside. Then re-added peppers mix and added tomatoes and simmered.

First, I definitely had to halve this recipe. I am a single lady and the recipe’s author is clearly trying to feed a small nation. I also couldn’t find the specific pepper in question so I just used other available small red ones (Fresnos?). I followed the previous reviewer’s advice and cooked the onions, peppers, tomatoes, before the beef and eggs and set aside. I had layered everything nicely in the pan and reached to grab the veg. That’s when disaster struck. The grease from my hands and my overly excited movement resulted in my favorite ceramic bowl slipping from my grip and shattering on my hard wood floor. It was not salvageable. I was left with the rice, fried potatoes, beef, and eggs, and I’m not going to lie I ate it with sriracha. Still pretty good. I will definitely attempt this recipe again after I have finished mourning what could have been and my beloved ceramic dish.

This was really great, with great flavors and wonderful mixtures of textures and one bowl. I even put the egg on the top, letting each person decide how they preferred it, serving in individual bowls. But it was a lot of work! We will probably make it again, but possibly using leftover rice to save time so we can heat up when we’re ready to serve, and make a little less of that “pico mixture” (we used the rest for omelets the next day!). What a fun recipe!
