I made this recipe exact, only using lactose free milk. I served this with my Buttery Maple Syrup. Both of my kids ate all six pieces though my oldest boy thought it was a little too "eggy". Not a reflection on the recipe, just not my kids' cup of tea. Using my griddle, this recipe took no longer than 15 to make from beginning to end and it used the last of my bread before Grocery Shopping Day.

I usually make a generic french toast with eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. For this recipe, I used french bread and made  it exactly as printed. It was absolutely delicious! I served it with warm syrup, a couple of pieces of bacon, and decaf for dinner! Yum!

I personally never liked French Toast to start with, but when I made this one I found it was actually quite good. :)

the taste was super, but it doesn't yield nearly the amount it claims.  tripped the recipe and ended up with 11 pieces of french toast.

I made this just as written.  Our four year old inhaled this stuff.  We used a pretty thick bread so we only got two servings put of it but, both were gone in a flash.  Will definitely make this again because I want to try it.

A nice solid recipe. I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and it worked out great. This is a nice fast breakfast meal.
Added points for it being an easy cleanup vs bacon Eggs and so on. I added a tiny amount of cinnamon to the mix prior to each piece of bread dipped. Two thumbs up!

Made this the other day and my family liked it. I initially used 12 eggs which said I could make 24 slices which didnt even come close. instead, i had to use 18 eggs in order to get enough french toast for my family. i also added a little more milk and sprinkled cinnamon on one side only.

I was working at a café. Kids would order French Toast. I wanted to make it special for them. Basically same recipe.. I add vanilla and crush up Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal. Batter bread dip in CTC Cereal
and fry as usual. Everyone seemed to enjoy the cinnamon crunch. And I enjoyed their smiles when they tasted it. Talk about taking it up a notch.  Oh Yeah.
