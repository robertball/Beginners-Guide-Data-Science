Pretty good! Not great but I'll try to make again for my son and I. Followed this recipe and it makes a ton! I didn't add as much cheese though, cause I don't like a lot of cheese. Can't believe I didn't have veggies in my house while I cooked this cause mixing can of corn, onions, and or bell peppers is a good idea!!

Very delicious and cheesy. I used hot and spicy taco seasoning, gave it that extra kick. Will make again

I had to use store-bought salsa, and chose to use extra shredded cheese instead of the processed cheese food that I don't like and it still turned out awesome! I would definitely make this again!!!

This was really good! Husband also loved it! I made mine own salsa from this site "D's Famous Salsa" which we also love.  I cooked my noodles according to the directions on the package and didn't add the water from the recipe....just cook's error, but still worked out. Only added  a half cup of milk plus a little more, maybe an additional 1/8 of a cup....because my salsa is a bit runny, the way we like it, so only added milk to what I needed to make the consistency I wanted.

Needs a little more "kick"...  I'll add some hot sauce next time I make it.  
I'm not a fan of "cheese food," so I used a Mexican mix shredded cheese to replace it.  That worked great!  
I'm feeding 5 and a few of them have pretty big appetites (weight lifters and martial artists), so I always have to double these recipes.  It can be a challenge to find a pot big enough for these one pot meals.  But this one fits just great in my Ninja Cooker!

I accidentally bought half-beef half-pork meant for Italian foods, but persevered with the "wrong" meat. Still works!

Should I make this dish again, I would use a longer simmer time (15-20 minutes) or less water because the sauce came out watery and thin. I also need to get a larger saucepan because this recipe nearly overflowed my 3qt. Educated guess: stirring in a little chopped parsley at the end might work well.

I definitely liked the flavors.  The salsa gave it a nice kick.  I will reduce the "cheese food" by about a third next time.

I did not have the salsa so I used 1 can Rotel and 1 can petite diced tomatoes. Also, I chopped up one small onion and 1/2 green pepper and cooked them after the beef. Added a dash of crushed red peppers when cooking the mixture. And, like someone else, I added 1 1/2 cups cooked corn just before serving - about 2 min.  We loved it!

We really liked this recipe but it's pretty cheesy. I made corn for the side and we ended up mixing it in with the mac and salsa to lighten some of the cheese taste. Next time I will mix in some black beans and corn before serving. Good as a stand alone, as a dip or on tostadas.

Easy one pot comfort dish! My husband is learning to cook so this was a good start. We added an onion and instead of the velveeta we added 1/2 jar of cheez whiz. We skipped the milk as the cheez whiz was creamy enough and also the recipe has no quantity listed. Comfort food for sure!

Delicious gooey comfort food with a spicy kick. I used homemade salsa/pico de gallo and substituted Nacho Cheese Sauce (found here on Allrecipes) in place of the Velveeta only because I'm not a fan of the taste. Please excuse me while I go and have another bowl.

This was yummy, quick, and easy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I couldn't since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.
I just used 1 cup of salsa, which was plenty for us, and I didn't have Velveeta, so I just used about 2 C. shredded cheddar cheese.  Since there was no milk measurement, so I left it out.  

It looked the Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni (i think that was the name of it) we used to eat as kids, but this tastes way better since we used fresh ingredients.  Thank you for the recipe!
