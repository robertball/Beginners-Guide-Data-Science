Loved it!  So good we choose to make it while in Japan!  The authentic Yakatori joint is down the street and we're not sure we can tell a difference!  We added pea pods and mushrooms as well as crushed sesame seeds. Yum! Yum! Yum!
Thanks for posting the recipe!  This is even a surprisingly easy to make!

Great recipe... tastes exactly like the yakitori in Japan. You could also cut the chicken into small pieces (boneless, skinless) and after they are marinated place the pieceson skewers to BBQ. (This is how it is made and served by the street vendors in Japan) yummy.

You know, I cook a lot of asian food. Mosly japanese. This  was actually quite delicious. I just made it last night and already my wife is asking for it again. i added a little sesame chile oil in place of some of the oil the recipe called for. Came out fantastic!

I'm half Japanese and eat japanese all the time, and I loved this! I added big pieces of green onion towards the end of the cooking process (I saw it that way in Japan) and it was yummy! thanks.

This is a family favorite.  I often make the marinade and put the chicken in to freeze, so I have a meal ready to go with little prep.

my food proof chicken marinade- always use this guy in a pinch- all of these ingredients are staples at my house!  generally, i use honey instead of sugar (like the smoky flavor that it lends).  also some chopped green onions are great with this.  i generally use chicken breasts- pan fry- then cut into strips- serve over white rice- and frozen veggies- heat the marinade and add a touch of corn starch- and whalah- a teriyaki bowl!

This was fantastic, we skewered these with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms and grilled.  We didn't have mirin but used Japanese rice wine + the sake and sugar instead.  The chicken carmalized beautifully and I will defn make again.

Too salty for my taste.  It needed a lot of rice to counteract the salt.      Steamed broccoli went well with it.

Great flavor. I used chicken tender pieces, marinated overnight,  skewered them and put them under the broiler. Easy and great presentation. Everyone thought they had great flavor.

This is a truly authentic Japanese recipe - at least it's the same recipe I was taught back in the 70's at Toronto Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre's cooking classes.  It is delicious and easy to make. If you're not close to a Japanese grocery, most large Japanese supermarkets will ship or buy online!  I love Japanese cuisine and used to order my staples from Union Grocery in Toronto's Chinatown when I lived in the hinterlands.  They arrived at the train station with a handwritten bill that I paid with a return cheque!!!  No PayPal gang....

The flavor of this dish was really good. Everything recipe called for went into the dish EXCEPT i used boneless skinless chicken breast and i topped it with green onions. I think next time i will use boneless skinless thighs.My mom (who is Japanese) says yakitori don is usually made with boneless chicken. I found that after cooking it down until the sauce evaporated, the chicken breast pieces was a wee bit on the dry side. I will definitely make this again. *ALWAYS use low sodium soy sauce. Regular Soy sauce in any dish is just uncalled for!!

No leftovers with this one. I had to give this a five because my kids loved it.  I also did not use sake (expensive), but substituted sweet rice vinegar.  I used everything else plus some green onions.  I threw in some extra tiny drumsticks and this went over great with my kids.  Try to  marinade this over night if you can.  And as for all the Japanese ingredients, get them once and you can make this recipe over and over again.  You will definitely want to!

Delicious! I didn't have any sake so I substituted with Rice Wine Vinegar. The flavour was very nice and this was very easy to make. I will definitely make this again. I thickened the sauce at the end with a bit of cornstarch mixed with water. I served the chicken with Japanese sticky rice and sauteed veggies.

Wonderful flavor... I used chunks of chicken breast so it cooked just a little faster, then served it over rice, and garnished with chopped fresh cilentro and green onion. Also, I used a less salty soy sauce (one I get that's made in Hawaii). What a great meal served with sauteed (stir-fried) boy choy or other greens!

I couldn't find mirin around here so I ended up using dry white wine and a little more sugar. I also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies to the dish to bulk it up and served this of tofu shirataki noodles. YUM. good recipe. Thanks,

The first time I made this it was very salty. My roommate and I, who both like a lot of salt, didn't care for it at all.  Each time since, I used sesame seed oil, switched the amount of Mirin and Soy Sauce around, and added a teaspoon of peanut butter (sounds strange but it really enhances the flavor). Everyone loves it!

Fabulous!  I didn't have Sake, so I subsituted white wine.  It was delicious on the grill.  The leftover marinade was reduced on the stove and served on top of the grilled chicken.  Yummy!

Very good.  I used chicken breast meat and took the skin off before cooking.  We enjoyed this dish fresh carrots and boiled soybeans (edamame).  I also served it in a Japanese lunch box.

Wow, way too salty.  We love Japanese food, but this was almost unedible.  My husband who eats almost anything (and he has...we've lived in Japan before) didn't finish this dish.  If I ever considered doing this again I would do low sodium soy sauce and not cook off the liquid.

Excellent!  Only giving 4 stars due to the saltiness. As others have said, use the low sodium soy sauce instead (I didn't, but wish I had).  I added hot sauce and green onions. By the way, if you live near a Trader Joe's store, they have sake for $4/bottle. I'll be adding this recipe to the regular rotation.

This was a great recipe. My family loves Yakitori Don and since we moved can't find any. We did use reduced salt soy sauce but it was still just a little too salty for us. So we will reduce the amount of soy sauce and add a little brown sugar instead of white. All in all this is the best Yakitori Don recipe that I have come across and will be making it a lot. My family has already asked when I will make it again. Thanks a bunch!

Pretty good.  Added an onion, some sliced green onions, and used more sugar and sake in place of mirin (I'm allergic to corn syrup).  Closest I'll get to yakitori living in Rawlins!

Really great recipe! After trying it, we modified it a bit by cutting down on the soy, from 2/3 cup to a bit less than 1/2 cup.  Other than that, it is wonderful and a hit at our party.   Thank you Jana for you post.

Delicious.  We wanted to make a sort of authentic Japanese meal when we were studying Japan, but too cheap to eat out.  We made this and sat on the floor around the coffee table.  Fantastic!

I have been making this recipe for six years. It is a staple in our home. Best as is, but I have been short on ingrediants and have made powdered ginger and white wine and marsala substitutions. Not quite as authentic but still yummy!

Excellent. I used reduced sodium soy sauce as suggested by many and it turned out perfect. I replaced the sugar with pure maple syrup and had to use plain white cooking wine instead of sake because I couldn't find any. I only use white meat chicken so I chopped some breasts, marinated overnight, and made skewers on my George Foreman grill. Served it with some fried rice and everyone thought it was great!

This was very easy to make. Great authentic taste! Tastes like we went to a nice Japanese restaurant! I cooked this with pork sausage fried rice and my husband and I were in heaven. Way better than takeout!

Love this dish....I took other opinions of being too salty and used Yamasa 50%less salt-soy sauce.  I am a Kikkoman girl but this turned out great!  Added green onions (chopped) and it was tasty!

Simple and Delicious! After cooking the chicken wok style, I skewered  the chicken along with shiitake mushrooms, zucchini, and yellow squash and baked on 400 for about 8 mins.  ^^

This was terrific.  I used a whole chicken, cut into pieces, and grilled it on the BBQ.  I also replaced the sugar with honey.  My entire family raved about it and my husband has asked for this dish a couple of times since.

This was awesome.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I omitted the sake since I didn't have any and I used low salt soy sauce.  Delicious recipe.

Very good - I added sesame oil and a lot more Sake, and less soy sauce as I felt 2/3 a cup would have been way too salty. We did not have Mirin so I added Oishi sauce and served with sticky white rice and zucchini sticks with onion sauteed in ginger and soy sauce. Really tasty meal thanks.

Four stars with the "disclaimer" that I did not use sake (we don't drink it and a small bottle of the stuff was $13), nor the Mirin wine.  Substituted rice vinegar for the sake and regular, slightly sweet, white wine for the Mirin.  This was still pretty good, though.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This was delicious and incredibly easy! I did make a few changes: reduced amount of soy sauce to 1/2c per other reviews & glad I did because it would have been too salty since I didn’t have low sodium soy sauce at hand. Increased sake to 1/4c to replace the ratio of liquid, and in place of white sugar, I used Ginger infused honey because I needed to use it up. Followed everything else exactly. It took just minutes to prep in the morning and marinated in fridge all day. Dinner was ready in short order! My husband tends to be a picky eater, but raved about this dish. We will definitely add this to our “go-to” list and I can’t wait to try it on other meats! Thanks for the recipe.

I reduced the servings by half and added a touch of sesame seed oil in the overnight marinate. The chicken thigh pieces were tender and flavorful, and I used it to make two bentos with rice (lunchboxes) for my boys. They liked it a lot.

Excellent recipe.  My girlfriend and I were quite impressed.  It should be noted that when the recipe's author says to "marinate for several hours or overnight," s/he means it.  I highly recommend a full night's worth of marinating.

this recipe is salty..these are the ingredients for teriyaki sauce. I recommend adding some water to cut the salty taste down and increase the sugar (to your tasting).

This recipe has good potential but it was way too salty and the ginger was over powering.  Next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce and marinate for 1 hour instead of 24 hours.

The taste is not bad. I don't have low-sodium soy sauce, so I put less of it. I only marinated the meat for about 1.5 hrs, and it came out pretty flavorful already. I used this on chicken thighs, breasts, and drumsticks. I like it with the thighs much better. I couldn't get the marinate cook into a suace, so I left it out and it was still good.

Awesome recipe, made it yesterday and served it over somen noodles.  Had some chicken wings in the freezer that were too big for my liking so I de-boned them, chopped them up and put them in the marinade. It came out perfect.  I'm going to be making this again, next time over rice.  Thanks for the recipe 5/5.

Absolutely delicious!
I used champagne as I didn't have much mirin and didn't have any sake.
Used honey instead of sugar.
Definitely make again!

The flavor was good but after living in Misawa Japan for 8 1/2 years this is not the yakitori I remember.  Maybe your's if from a different region.  I will make again but I'll keep looking for a traditional Yakitori recipe that I remember.

I love this recipe!  Everybody who ate it gobbled it up in no time.  The marinade made the chicken taste blissful.  I made this atop sushi rice, with a side of fresh green beans.  I definitely recommend this dish.

I made this tonight using boneless, skinless chicken breast over rice (as suggested) for my husband and OMG it was to die for!! The only thing is it was a tad bit salty so next time I am gonna use  less soy sauce. I let this sit for 32 hours and it just fell apart in our mouth! Yum yum I will definitely make this again!

I have a small family so I use chicken thighs only instead of a  whole chicken. It took way longer than the recipe stated to reduce the sauce. However, the flavor was great. Will make this again.

Similar to another recipe I have but surprisingly, this gave a special zing to the chicken. I now prefer it to the original.

Oh my gosh, this is soooo good.  After marinating, I put the beef and chicken on skewers and grilled them.  I boiled the marinade and then basted with it and served it on the side.  My husband said that I should make it every night.  I think I'll just make about 10 copies of this and pass it out to my friends and family.

I completely modified the recipe, only taking the ingredients list. But after 1 mediocre attempt, I got it right. The basic changes I made were 50/50 mirin/soy sauce, and half the sugar. I would also put in much much more ginger. I also use 1 tsp. seasame seed oil and sometimes sprinkle seasame seeds on top.

Thanks!

The flavors of the chicken were fantastic, I personally thought that it was too salty though. Next time I'll use less soy sauce, but other than that I enjoyed this one!

Very tasty - I've made this many, many times.  The only real different I made is that I doubled the sauce.  The recipe works for chicken or steak or beef strips.  I would definitely recommend.
