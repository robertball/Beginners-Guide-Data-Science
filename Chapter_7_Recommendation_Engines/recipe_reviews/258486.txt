Not bad for having no sugar in the batter. just make sure you use chocolate chips to supplement the sweetness. They were crumbly but firmed up slightly after sitting overnight. I've tried several black bean brownie recipes and I find their texture to be more crumbly than traditional brownies. Kids ate them which is a plus!

I thought this was very good for a flourless brownie. I added white chips and some sugar free confectioners sugar (swerve brand) to the top. This is the first time I’ve ever made or tasted black bean brownies and so glad I did! I’m going to use this recipe as a base and add my own twists to it in the future. Thank you for posting!
