I make this recipe all the time but I used mashed potatoes instead of roasted. I use bacon, and I saute a large red onion in tons of butter. I also use loads of cheese. The red onion and bacon add alot of flavor. I think the reason it was so bland was because of the roasted potatoes. Good way to use up your left over mashed potatoes from the night before!! I also do not use the eggs, cottage cheese-only the noodles, bacon,mashed potatoes, red onion and tons of butter, also to keep the top of your casserole from getting crusty-try drizzling olive oil on top before you bake it.

This is a great basic recipe, because it leaves so much room for modifications! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, I also just boiled and mashed my taters instead of roasting them. Cut the bacon up and crumbled it on top as opposed to layering strips across the top. I fried one red onion in butter for the top...then when it came out of the oven I scattered chopped green onions on top and drizzled sour cream on top. To me green onions and sour cream go hand in hand with perogies and bacon. The whole family loved it, even the kids wanted seconds!

This one gets a 5 out of 5 from our family.  Taste is excellent and I, like many others, boil and mash the potatoes to save time.  You can do so many variances of this recipe that it never gets boring.  

I use DRY cottage cheese instead of regular and I use an extra egg or two.  I also have used Italian sausage removed from the casing as an alternate for the bacon.  This makes it super yummy and flavourful.

This is a recipe that is lengthy in preparation so I usually prepare it early in the day when I have the time, and set it aside to be cooked at supper time.

We thought this was really good. The only thing I did differently was to saute the onion in the bacon grease, and I also added a little garlic powder. This isn't the healthiest of dishes, but it was really hearty. Thanks, Sarena!

On top of how long this took to make it tasted just okay and am very disappointed.  My husband was irked that it wasn't good either since he had to watch the baby while I fixed this on a Saturday afternoon.  I did alter the recipe by mashing the potatoes and left out the bacon and onions but that wouldn't have changed anything in the end result.  Where the recipe messed up (and I was too much of a novice to alter it ahead of time) was the fact that the recipe calls for noodles on the bottom, then the layer of cottage cheese mixture, and then another layer of noodles to be topped with potato mixture.  I had tons of noodles left over but by the time I realized it the dish was already assembled.  If you make this, please add more layers of noodles and alternate the fillings.  Mine turned out like cheesy mashed potatoes and have a huge 9x13 pan full.  We only ate just a small amount each.  At least it was an inexpensive dish but being a new mom my time is very valuable.

Great basic recipe.  I made some minor changes, boiled potatoes w/ skins on until tender then added dried minced onion & cheese.  Also added some German Sausage to cottage cheese layer, definately a keeper!

I sounded so good, but I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  In all fairness, I did use turkey bacon, so that might have diminished the taste some.  However, I thought the taste was a little dull and not very interesting.  Also it didn't seem to come together well, the layers never really blended well.

Great basic crowd-pleaser.  I made a couple of small changes, as others have:
- Boil and mash potatoes (versus roasting)
- Add 3/4 c sour cream and 1/2 tsp onion powder to mashed potatoes
- Fry 2 - 3 chopped onions along with the bacon for the topping, and serve with sour cream.  Yum!

Fantastic! I usually do my meal prep for the next day after the kids have gone to bed. So, last night I made the mashed potatoes and cooked the bacon and onions together (I just like sauteed onions in recipes). Today I did the other stuff and assembled it. I threw some crumbled spicy sausage in with the bacon, just because I had some left over, and it was absolutely fantastic! Thank you!

This is worthy of five stars.  Everybody liked it...my kids scraped off the ricotta cheese. lol.  Next time I will half the recipe.  We had at least half left over after me, my wife and two kids ate.  I thought it was expensive too.  I did buy the good bacon I guess but even the ricotta and cottage cheese were like 12 bucks.  Over all though it was delicious.  I followed almost exact.  I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese, and didn't use eggs, cooked one LARGE diced red onion with the chopped bacon and didn't use any butter!!  Will make again but half this time and maybe with less potato....so I guess that means I have to cut back on the cheddar as well!!!

This was not too bad. I made mine differently than the recipe and when it came out of the oven it was very watery, due to the cottage cheese. I did not use eggs (my fiance is a vegetarian) so that may have been the problem. I also used mashed potatoes and mixed milk, butter, salt, pepper, garlic, parmesan, cheddar and onions sauteed in butter (to taste)in the potatoes. I layered the potatoes with a final layer of noodles then sprinkled more cheddar and onions on top. Didn't use more butter as I wanted to cut back on the oil. It tasted just like the pierogies you buy from the old ladies at the churches and though it was really soft and a little runny out of the oven, the next day as a leftover it reheated really well and it was much "stiffer". I liked it better as a leftover.

If my rating was based on taste alone, this would have gotten 5 stars. It tasted just like pierogis. I did like a few people have suggested and used one big red onion that I sauteed in the bacon grease for the top, but other than that did not stray from the recipe. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the amount of work involved. This is NOT a meal for a busy weeknight. I spent the entire hour that the potatoes were roasting doing all of the other necessary prep work and then when the potatoes were done, I STILL had another half hour's worth of work to do, with the scooping out the potatoes and the assembly of the finished casserole. By the time the whole thing was done, I was so tired, I wasn't even hungry anymore. I might make this again, but it'll have to wait for a day when I'm not just getting off of a double shift!

This is truly a very interesting and delicious recipe that you can have so much fun playing around with to make it your own. I'm the queen of seasonings and I felt this dish needed a few to pick up the flavors. Secondly, I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese only because it's smoother in texture. Instead of layering, I made lasagna roll ups and topped it off with a cheesey white sauce and some buttered bread crumbs. Santa may not be good to me this year because like Caroline, I also sauteed my onions in the bacon grease. This dish may not be waist friendly, but it's the HOLIDAY'S and who gives a flying leap? Give this a try, we've got less than a month to start eating healthy again. Thanks Sarena!

Fantastic!  I made it as written and it tasted exactly like a perogy. The only reason I rated it 4 stars was because it's a lot of work, however, a lot less work than making real perogies!  My hubby actually said, "tastes just like a perogy, why didn't you just boil up some tonight instead of making this?"  LOL. Thank you for a really cool recipe!!  Worth the effort!

We've made this several times, but had to make changes for improvement. Most importantly I fully cooked the bacon, crumbled it, and added it to the mashed potatoes with extra butter. I found that adding it to the top made it too crispy. I've never used 12 noodles, and have no idea how anyone can fit that many in a 9x13 pan with 5lbs of mashed potatoes. I just made a double recipe and used 8 for each pan. I topped it with sautéed onions with sour cream and green onions.

Love the recipe, but I left out the cottage cheese and eggs, I used mashed potatoes also and added a drained bag of sauerkraut and sauted it with the red onion, chopped up half a Rosol's kielbasa finely and tossed that in with the sauerkraut and onion. Layered the noodles then the potato & cheese, butter then the bacon, sauerkraut, onion and kielbasa all the way to the top. My family loved it, I've taken it to friends homes and to work and no leftovers!!

Everyone at the party loved it.  Makes more than seven servings (in my opinion).  I boiled the potatoes and skipped the bacon (vegetarian friends you know).  Very good.  Next time I might skip the cottage cheese altogether.

Are we rating on taste alone??? Or taste with along such things as preparation.  As far as taste it deserves 10 stars, but the preparation stinks.  Way too much time with the potatoes and I don't feel it's necessary.  I was going to use instant mashed pototoes when I first read this recipe for convenience, but I forgot and had already started.  (Maybe wanted to give the author benefit of the doubt *shrugs*)  But anways, I will definitely make this again but ONLY with mashed potatoes, either instant or homemade.  This is not a fancy dish which should require so much work!
10 stars for taste though!

I love perogies and this recipie was even better than the ones at the store! It was quick and easy and very tasty.  I made it for me and my bf, so I scaled it down to a 8X8 pan and we ate the whole thing.  I only had canned mushrooms though, so I omitted them, but next time I will be sure to have potabellas! Awesome recipie!

This was so delicious!  It tasted just like a real perogee.  I used instant potatoes instead of roasted to cut down the time and it still turned out amazing... I shudder to think how fattening this was, but it was well worth it!
