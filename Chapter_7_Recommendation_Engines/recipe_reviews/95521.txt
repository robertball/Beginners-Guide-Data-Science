The kids LOVE making these..   It's like making their own sweet individual pizzas, only they're made of rice cakes.

Fun!  Good!

This was great!  The whipped topping makes for a great combination with the sweet rice cake.  I didn't use the chocolate syrup, I thought it made for a perfect dessert without it!
