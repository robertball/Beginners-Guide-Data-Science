I would really rate this a 3 1/2.   Its ok, but i agree a little to sweet and it does taste a little like sloppy joes. I grew up with Clair and Carl's and MC Sweeney's in Plattsburgh, ny.  this recipe is not close to those.  i think the next time i will not put all of the sugar and about half the ketchup, and replace it with more sauce maybe do 16 oz of tomato sauce.  I did add the cumin, and red crushed pepper.  just a hint from watching my mom make her version, she boiled the ground beef and it makes it really small so you don't have to stand over it breaking it up with your spatula.  Unfortunately i can not get my mom because she has passed on.   I promise it works.  just drain it and another thing you can do to add a layer of flavor is put some pepper and cumin and onion powder in the water with the beef. I hope this helps everyone!

WONDERFUL!!! It was a big hit with my grandkids also. I followed the recipe except I added a bit of cumin. Top it off with chopped sweet onion. YUMMY! I had plenty to freeze for later.

One word: WOW!  Fantastic sauce!  One bit of advice.  Use a potato masher to break the beef down to a finer consistency.

The best hot dog sauce recipe I have come across. Exactly what I was looking for. I get rave reveiws every time I make this and it makes enough so that I can freeze as individual portions and get 4 or 5 "meals" out of it.

We just returned from a week at our camp in the Adirondacks. This year we decided to make our own sauce instead of going out for our favorite upstate food.  Your sauce was GREAT!. Now we have a new tradition, and we will use it every summer as well as at home during the rest of the year. For the true up (up)state experience use  with Glacier Dogs!!

This was actually very good. My husband is from up-state New York but had never heard of this.. Probably it is from up-up-state New York!! I have to agree with the others that this really reminds of sloppy joe.. I had my doubts as I tasted it in the pot b-4 decorating my dog with it.. but surprisingly it was very good on it.. I added a little shredded cheese.. Husband and son liked it also.. 4-stars is coz it's  definitely worth trying but not something I will be craving everytime I have a hot dog.. Thanks

This recipe was a dream and now a reality!  The one we remember and love.  My sister said Tobin's 1st Prize hot dogs were used.  They are mild tasting and don't compete with the flavor of the sauce.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  And to anyone new to this it is not meant to be a chili dog or sloppy joe-ish.  It's better!!!

I grew up eating Gene's michigans and I think I might know these Slatterys actually graduated with one of them and have been craving michigans. I was really surprised to see this recipe much like the one I used to make. Its in the crockpot right now and I have no doubt that we will love it!! Thanks so much you certainly made my day!!

I live in Southern NY, but have lots of friends from the "North Country".  I used this recipe in a challenge with a friend from Franklin County as to who makes the BEST Michigan Sauce...I WON!!!  Even my competitor acknowledged it was better than his family's "secret" recipe...It was very easy to make, full of great flavor & came out as smooth as poosible...THANKS GRANDMA SLATTERY!!!

I'll preface by admitting I didn't know what to expect when I tried this recipe, just knew I wanted something different.  I cooked as instructed and the sauce (which is basically a sloppy joe) was delicious, but it just seemed a little odd to put on a hot dog.  I will for sure make again and just put on buns though!  Try a pickle on top of the hotdog and this sauce, it's good!  Thanks for sharing!

I too grew up in Morrisonville/Plattsburgh area and thankfully get to make the 14 hr. trip back at least once a year.  Cumin is a spice that you either love or hate. Like anything, tweak the flavors.

My husband grew up in the North Country and introduced me to Michigans.  This recipe is by far his favorite.  I'm a convert myself.  Love them!  Only change we've made to the recipe was to add a bay leaf while it simmers (and remove when done).  Delicious!

Other reviews are right on. This is not a chili dog or sloppy joe (no chili and no peppers). I have never seen a"Michigan" anywhere but here. (Northern,NY...almost to Canada) This is where you get a michigan either with or without. (onions) YUM!

For any vegetarians, it is easy to make this into a veggie Michigan. Specifically, Light Life brand veggie crumbles that already look and feel like browned ground beef. Even the fussiest of meat eaters can't tell the difference!

This  didn't taste like what I was expecting.  It came out kind of thick and tasted like a saucy meatloaft.  Not sure that I would make this again. It just might not be to my taste.

It's a very good tasting sauce. Freezes well. This is the closest sauce I can find to the Michigan sauce we have here in Vermont but not quite the same.

I thought this sounded like sloppy joes on hotdogs, but hey, we do chili dogs so I gave it a try and this was soooo good. I prepared it exactly as written and everyone agreed it was a keeper. We used Hebrew National hotdogs and topped it w/walla walla sweet onions. YUM!

I've never been to New York, but this stuff is delicious! I used Laura's ground round, so it was pretty healthy. I also used Healthy Choice Savory Franks and topped them off with freshly grated Vermont white cheddar. It makes a lot, so I froze half. Thanks so much for sending the recipe!

Left out the catsup and it was PERFECT! I'm from Plattsburgh, NY and it brought back memories (I live in the south now). They only know chili dogs.

I made this for my boyfriend who is from way upstate NY and he loved it! He said it was really close to the Michigan's he loves from Plattsburgh, NY.  I made it on the stove then transferred it to my crackpot to simmer for an hour or so until we were ready to eat and it was perfect! Great recipe!

I would make just one recommendation, size the recipe up a little, and use a slow cooker. Once the sauce and spices are up to temperature, add the meat and stir it in to make the meat in the sauce as fine as possible. Let it cook over night, and adjust the spices to taste later in the day. The Michigan's are traditionally made with Glazier Hots, which have a casing, and with finely minced onions buried under the sauce on the hot dog. The sauce freezes well, and if you size up the recipe, you can enjoy the Michigans whenever you want, by simply thawing some.

I have used this off and on for a few years now with great success. I follow the recipe exactly. I recently tried a different one on this site (its supposed to be very similar to one in upstate New york that was featured on a cooking show) but I didnt like it as much as this one, nor did my family. I have very picky 5 and 6 year old boys, they gave this 2 thumbs up! It's really good and I would recommend it to anyone!

Make sure you add the hamburger raw. It will be very fine if you stir it well in the beginning. I'm from upstate NY and this one is different somehow to what I'm used to. Mine has cumin and no vinegar or sugar. It's good just different. Not meant to be saucy, so you have to really cook it down.

This was much too sweet. It wasn't anything that I remembered in Michigan. Used it as Sloppy Joes.

This meat sauce is incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow!!! YUM!!! I made this in advance of tomorrow's cookout so I snuck a taste and I could not stop eating this! I plan on serving this over hot dogs along with shredded cheese and chopped vidalia onions. Thanks for the recipe! By the way, I used 93% lean ground beef.

I am also used to Claire and Carl's Michigan sauce. This tastes like sloppy joes. Grabted3good sloppy joes, but not Michigan sauce. I have claire and Carl's recipe somewhere in my email just couldn't find it. Will definitely make this again when I am craving sloppy joes. I would enjoy it prepared as that instead of over my hot dogs.

This was darn near PERFECT Hot Dog Sauce, not chili like other regions do .. but SAUCE. It was a tad too sweet for me, so next time I will half the brown sugar, but this is my new staple. No longer will I have to grab a can of manwich for hot dogs. Thank you Mrs. Slattery!

This was a good try! Deconstructing Michigan sauce isn't as easy as it may seem but this is a good effort. Sadly it's too sweet. Michigan sauce should have just a subtle sweetness so you can taste the other flavors. This was too much. I am from Michigan, grew up in Detroit and Michigan sauce or Coney sauce as we called it was part of our weekly lives and can I say that I live in NY now and have tried most reconstructions and none are authentic "Michigan" sauce. They are close but something is missing and those  from NY giving reviews based on that sauce are not giving real reviews on Michigan sauce.

It was really sweet (and that's weird coming from me, i like sweetness in savory dishes) and tasted WAY too much like tomato paste. And was super, super thick.

Well...since it's supposed to be a 'topping' for hot dogs, as opposed to a 'Main Dish' or used for tacos, I left out the brown sugar & ketchup. My 'vinegar' came from a jar of jalepenos & also some pepperoncinis that I chopped in it. Also, I diced my green peppers and onions very fine, so folks predisposed to 'not' liking those two won't hardly know they r there. Did add one small can of paste, at the end, for very little color but it did make nice diff. NOW...this will be nice nice on top of a steamed dog, mustard under. Can't wait to try it. BTW: truth be told, first time I heard of 'Michigan Sauce' and had it at Village Snack Bar in Rutland, VT.

Very good. I mashed the mixture with a potato masher for a finer consistency and added red pepper flakes, cumin and cayenne.

I did not really care for this. It tasted way to sweet. This does not taste like chili. It tastes more like sloppy joes. I will not try this one again.
