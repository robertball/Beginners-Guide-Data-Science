The dough would not come out of the cookie press no matter what I tried.  I rolled them into balls and flattened them with a fork, worked out well.

I read previous reviews about the dough not being able to push through the press. So I added a little less flour and I also had 1 whole cup of pumpkin pur√©e. But the dough was way too sticky and looked like a pile of "you know what" on my cookie sheet.  The flavor of these cookies is not the best either. I can't taste any of the pumpkin, too much spices. I ended up dropping these onto the sheet.  The frosting is also horrible! I've never made frosting with this consistency before. Too runny and tastes too much like powdered sugar. Over all, not a good baking experience as far as quality. At least I had fun with my kids though!

I had the problem where the dough would not release from the cookie press.  The dough had a strange glue-y consistency.  I rolled it into balls and flattened with a glass dipped in sugar.  They turned out just ok.  Not much flavor.  I have another pumpkin cookie recipe I will stick with.
