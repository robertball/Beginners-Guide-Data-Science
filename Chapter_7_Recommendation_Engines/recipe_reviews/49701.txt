I'm not sure what makes this 'Irish' as traditional cottage pies - shepherd's pies are made with ground lamb, cottage pies with ground beef - always have a mashed potato topping. I made the meat filling as the recipe stated, but found it incredibly bland and watery. I added onion powder, lots of ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and some Bisto gravy granules. This improved it, but I wish I had added some peas or green beans. Thanks anyway.

I had to make some modifications to this recipe due to food allergies.  It turned out amazing.  My sauce combined 2tbs Worchestershire sauce + Beef Stock + 1/3 cup Basalmic vinegar + seasoned salt. Thanks for the recipe.

The Irish call Cottage Pie Shepherd's pie, and they bung any kind of meat in it, although a traditional Shepherd's Pie is made with lamb and a Cottage Pie with beef. Nuff said.  I'm just rating this on the basis of the recipe. It needs peas and carrots big time, and I'd leave out the part with the flour, margarine, ketchup, consomme and especially the browning sauce, you shouldn't need it. Use the consomme (or beef stock) by all means, and a touch of flour to thicken, but I normally simmer everything until the sauce thickens, it's very important not to have too much moisture in the filling, as it'll rise to the top while cooking and ruin the mashed spuds.  Use a bit of tomato puree and some herbs if you're feeling adventurous, I use thyme, rosemary and parsley, but they aren't everyone's cup of tea, so use accordingly, and don't forget the Worcester sauce (ONLY from Lea and Perrins!!!) and a teaspoonful of COLEMAN'S!!! powdered mustard in the sauce, now you're cooking!

This cottage pie needs vegetables. Both my husband and I did not like it. I prefer it with frozen peas, green beans, carrots, corn and a little tomato sauce but due to the liquid from the veggies,  there is no need to add it. Any shredded cheese on top gives it a great taste.

I left out the beef consomme since it was never mentioned in the directions and instead added a can of beef gravy to the meat and left out the ketchup and seasoning sauce. I also topped the pie with a homemade pie crust and it came out awesome! I think next time I will add the cheese before the potato since my cheese did not melt very well. Everyone loved it and the pie crust really made it. Thanks!

I did not add beef consomme or browning sauce, I did add about 2cups of water and about 2 tbls of beef bouillon to the flour paste. I added corn and peas the beef mix and it came out better than I expected.

I used this as a basis for my Shepherd's Pie. We had leftover roast beef etc., so I shredded up the beef instead of the ground beef, and used the leftover gravy for the sauce.

I  made a vegetarian version, because one of my kids is vegetarian.  It works really well.  Simply omit the beef, and use water instead of consommé.  I also used more cheese than is called for.  Excellent, very adaptable recipe.  Well-written.

I made this for my father-in-law who is from England and he said it was the best he ever had.  I agree!  How flavorful.  Made another suggested recipe.  Not even close to the awesomeness of this recipe!

Loved this recipe, it was a huge hit at the office and they are always asking when I am going to bring it again!  I don't usually cook following a recipe, I sort of wing it and always adjust the seasoning to our taste.  This is the closest to what I get in some of the pubs around town and I am very impressed.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was ok.  My husband thought it was yummy.  I thought it was very salty - probably from the consomme or browning & seasoning.

I made some changes to this as well.  I substituted ground turkey for beef, instant mashed potatoes prepared according to package instruct., 1 pouch mushroom gravy powder mix & 1 Tbl flour sprinkled over meat & onion/garlic mixture, stir in 1 can beef broth and about 1/4 c guiness stout.  Then I added 1 bag frozen mixed veggies then bake in oven as directed with potatoe/cheese mixture on top. Awesome!

It was WAY too watery!! I doubled the recipe to make 2 dishes and I spent 3 hours cooking it down before I dared cook it in the oven and it still boiled over all into my oven.  I will use another recipe altogether next time.

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly.. .Only differences is I added one of those little beef flavor enhancer packets with the ground beef.. added more garlic...but the biggest, most important change, Is I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables..I can't even imagine it without them..  I used all organic products and grass fed, organic beef.. So it became a little more pricey..but it is definitely an easy and affordable recipe...My boyfriend loved it.. and with the changes it will definitely be a keeper on our menu..Thank you for the recipe.. Never made this before.. and honestly thought it sounded gross (not your recipe, just the meal in general) ..but its what the boyfriend wanted... Glad he did! :)

Loved this recipe! Added 1/4 cup of  Worcestershire  sauce and used a little less ketchup in the beef. . I also found that it took a little longer to make but that could just be me! It was delicious!

Sorry but not my favourite shep pie. I followed directions exactly. I did find it a little runny after adding the liquids to the beef. I also found the directions a little scattered. Rather than dirty another pan, I'd recommend you drain the beef and set aside. Use the beef skillet to mix the liquids and then add the beef back in when it's time. This was a little bland for us and I prefer an addition of another veggie. Thanks anyways ERLENSEE_GERMANY.

This is fantastic although I do make a few changes. I use McCormick brown gravy & add, 1 cup of beef broth instead of water, then add that to the beef. I use a mixture of monterey jack & cheddar cheese. I also make the mashed potatoes the day before for another recipe-only using red potatoes,1/2 light cream & 1/2 milk, butter, salt & pepper. A little richer, but we love it. Good luck foodies:)

I followed the recipe exactly as it's given and the meat mixture came out way too soupy and no amount of simmering would thicken it, ending up with a soupy mess. IF I make this recipe again, I would definately use much less liquid and add peas
