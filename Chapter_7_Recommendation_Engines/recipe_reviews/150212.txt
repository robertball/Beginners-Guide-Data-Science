20 minutes to bake a tilapia fillet is waaaay too long.  Your fish will be overcooked.  I recommend about 8 to 10 minutes in a pre-heated oven.

Well, this helped me learn that bf does indeed like tilapia!  LOL.  I had a hard time finding arugula, which surprised me.  After all that, I'm not sure if it was just bad quality arugula or if I just can't tell the difference, bc it just tasted like spinach to me.  I had probably 2 cups total, but that was plenty to cover 4 small filets.  I used the food processor bc I don't have a blender.  Bf said it was "weird, but good" so we can make it again.  Thanks for the recipe and the idea--I think basil or sundried tomato pesto would be awesome on tilapia.

Served this to my in-laws who don't eat fish very often and they loved it.  My husband gave it an "A" rating The pesto part could get a little strong on the garlic but we liked it that way.

This is good, but it seems to be missing something.  Salt, maybe?  I was hoping for a little more flavor.  The arugula did end up tasting like spinach and it overpowered the other ingredients.

This was so good it inspired me to try growing arugula in my own garden!
