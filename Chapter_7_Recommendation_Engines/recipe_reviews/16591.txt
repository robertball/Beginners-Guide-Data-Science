It was hard to imagine how it would taste like, but it turned out better than I originally thought.  The 2nd time, I made it with Soy sauce, and it also came out fine.  The crab taste doesn't really stand out, as cream cheese and pineapple has strong aroma.

I wouldn't change a thing (although I do sprinkle with Old Bay). This is fantastic, especially easy to make and our family has enjoyed for years on our Christmas eve buffet table either on celery or with crackers...in fact my kids now grown and moved away, still request it every year!
