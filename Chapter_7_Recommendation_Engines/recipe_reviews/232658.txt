This is super tasty. I would have given it 5 stars but the directions are flawed and leave out the bread crumbs, eggs (although I used 1 whole egg and it was fine), and water that is listed in the ingredients list (I did not use the water though - my meat mixture did not need it) Additionally, it doesn't say to mince the garlic. I used an 80/20 meat as it is so much more flavorful than the lean stuff. I also used fresh flat leaf Italian parsley and 1 tbsp minced fresh garlic. I used seasoned bread crumbs and just 1/2 teaspoon cumin as it can be overpowering. I made the Greek Tzatziki sauce recipe from this site. The meatballs were full of flavor and held their own with the Tzatziki Sauce - they went very well together. I really think it is important to use fresh parsley and 1 tablespoon of garlic for best results along with a more flavorful meat like the 80/20. I cooked the meatballs at 425 for 15 minutes and they were juicy and delish! I broiled the flat bread until lightly toasted and topped with 4 meatballs, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and fresh parsley. We loved this meal! I served it with baked sweet potato fries which complemented the sandwich nicely! Great flavors! Thanks for a delicious recipe. I did notify allrecipes to the errors, so I'm sure they will correct the directions soon and I will change this to 5 stars then!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to add extra seasonings to the meatballs.  I added some fresh oregano, fresh chopped mint, and onion to the seasonings already called for in the recipe.  In addition to that, I used fresh breadcrumbs and milk and one whole egg.  Served on warmed flatbread with store bought tzatziki and a combination of chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, parsely, fresh mint seasoned with salt and some lemon juice.  With my changes, my family enjoyed this dinner very much.

I love summer when my herb garden is raging. I added fresh mint, thyme and a little basil to this recipes beefball mixture. Brushed fresh garlic butter on the naan before I toasted it the last few minutes under the broiler as the meatballs finished off. Loaded on the fresh tzatziki sauce, recipe from AR and all these fresh toppings! We enjoyed every Greek Island Summer bite. Great Lunch or light dinner.

These were AMAZING. We like our sandwich's (or in the case, gyro) plain. It's also small because I made my own pita bread for the first time ever. I did add onion though. It was delicious!

I added some Greek Seasoning and used fresh minced garlic and parley and baked in oven as written. I also used the Tzatziki sauce on this website. My husband loved them and has already requested them again.

I thought this was a tasty basic meatball, but, the addition of the toppings are what made this dish.   Based on the suggestion from other reviewers - I added some Greek seasoning to the meat mixture.   Mine baked in exactly 18 minutes and resulted in a tender juicy meatball.  I topped mine with cucumber, tomato, fresh parsley, green onions, feta cheese, and a simple tzatziki sauce made with fresh dill and lemon juice.

This was pretty good but the meatballs weren't all that flavorful. I used rosemary and evoo infused flatbread. We added the tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and tzatziki sauce. If the meatballs had more seasoning these would be amazing, I would definitely make these again.

FANTASTIC! I used a whole egg instead of 2 whites, b/c I didn't want to waste the yolk, lol. Also, I added some fresh chopped mint and 1/2 of a grated onion to the meat mixture. The meatballs came out sooooo moist and delicious! I served them on the flatbread w/ tomatoes, onion, cukes and gyro sauce that I got from our Mediterranean market. These are a definite keeper...everyone LOVED them and I already can't wait to make them again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used 80/20 meat and the whole eggs, and added a quarter cup of Sriracha sauce and some chili flakes (we like it spicy). Made a long hot-dog shaped meatball on skewers to put it in lavash and pita with Greek Tzatziki and Authentic Taboulleh - it was the hit of the party! This one is definitely a keeper! If you barbecue it, make sure you oil your grate really thoroughly so that it doesn't stick.

This was a little bland and I even doubled the salt and added oregano! I also used milk instead of water. I think I would add 1 and 1/2 tsp. salt next time. And maybe use flavored breadcrumbs instead of plain.

Tried this tonight, I added greek seasoning and just cooked the meatballs in a fry pan. We put the meatballs on top of lightly grilled flatbread with Chef John Tzatziki sauce, lettuce and tomatoes.  Yummy, 3 of us finished it all.

Thought the meatballs were a little lacking in flavor, so next time I'll kick up the flavor a little.  Sprayed the flatbreads with olive oil cooking spray, sprinkled with garlic powder, and browned in a hot skillet.  Served with tzatztki sauce, chopped green onions, and tomato.  Nice sandwich recipe.

So tasty!  But I altered these by using ground lamb instead of beef. I also added lemon juice and included pine nuts and mint in the meatballs.

Meatballs were ok but definitely need to find a better tzatziki sauce recipe.

A nice change for dinner tonight.  Served these in grilled pita bread with diced tomatoes, red onion slices and tzatziki sauce.  Along side of  these, we had:  'Mediterranean Snow Peas', 'Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatziki Cucumber Sauce' and 'Grilled Corn Salad', all recipes from AR.

Tasty meatball, once I added some Greek seasoning to it. As it, it was kind of bland. I did like the texture and it wasn't dry.. just needed a little boost on the seasonings for me. Make a quick tzatziki sauce, chopped tomatoes and served on garlic naan
