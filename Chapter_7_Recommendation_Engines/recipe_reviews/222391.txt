Incredible! While looking for a new appetizer recipe, I found this one and was thinking that those herbs don't sound like they would be good with peaches... so of course I had to try it.  Wow!  I did have to make some changes, because I live in the middle of nowhere and wanted to make it for a dinner party tomorrow night.   First, I think the nearest "herbs de Provence" are in a Wegman's a 4 hour round trip from here.  so....  I had to make my own with some fresh herbs from my garden and a few dried ones that I had.  I didn't have any savory, nor do they carry it at our local grocery, so that was left out.  I do have Celtic Sea Salt.  
I don't know how far I would have to go for burrata cheese, but was able to get some marscapone locally.   
Luckily, farms are abundant here so I was able to get some really good peaches, and I always have turbinado sugar.
Anyway.  Wow.  Every bite is a great experience.  Just... the salt with the sweet cheese... and then you get a hint of lavender from the herbs.  Wow.  Try it.  Even if you have to modify it like I did, you'll love it.  Can't wait to serve it tomorrow at the birthday/dinner party.

Excellent. We made it for lunch at the office. This would make a fantastic appetizer for a party. I was already a fan of Burrata and the peaches were the perfect compliment. We served it with some prosciutto and a mixed green salad.

This is delicious!!!  DH said it is a "keeper" recipe!!!  I agree!  Decided to simply use the broiler to brown the sugar since my torch is tucked away somewhere.  This will become a regular in the appetizer file!

Great summer-time appetizer. I've made it twice and it was a big hit both times. I was even asked for the recipe.  It seems like it would take a long time, but it was actually pretty easy.

I saw this recipe and knew I wanted to try it. I finally made it tonight and it was very, very good. My husband, who for some weird reason doesn't love peaches !?!?, even said "wow, the flavors in this are delicious."  We also brought some to our neighbors and they absolutely loved it! I'm going to make this as long as the peaches are ripe! Plus, it's fun to torch your food!

Bread was rather distracting from the flavor, better without it!

Super easy to prepare ahead and delicious. I didn't have a torch so I broiled the peaches and brown sugar, then placed atop the bread and cheese.
