As the recipe submitter, I wanted to comment that you can actually make this in a big batch and store it for an extended period of time. Also, although I edited the recipe after submitting it, I found that using only 1 Tbsp of flour is much better than 2. Happy eating!

Great! I have used other homemade mixes, but this one has a great flavor. I omitted the cayenne pepper (my family doesn't like it hot) and decreased the salt by half. Also, as the submitter suggested, I cut the flour in half as well. I usually make a big batch so I don't have to start from scratch every time and this one lends itself well for that. I used a cup of water mixed into the beef and seasoning mix and it turned out just right. Not too runny and not too thick. Will definately make this my usual mix! Thank you for submitting it!

This is very good. I used it to make a taco soup and it turned out perfect. I don't know how tacos turn out but the soup was 5 stars. Thanks Kel for a great recipe!
UPDATE 6-25-12 This made great tacos. I used 2 T flour as called for but it probably could have used less as the submitter suggests in her review. I will make this again.

This got great reviews so I wanted to try it.  It was okay but I missed having cumin in it.  Cumin adds such a delicious flavor and this needs about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of it.

My husband said, "Don't take this the wrong way, but don't make this the other way anymore."  I was expecting to hear something else by the way he started off.  He really like the new taco seasoning.  YAY!!!  I did have some changes, but the basic recipe was followed.
1 tbsp flour
1 tsp chili powder
1 1/2 tsp dried minced onion
(no paprika, not on my shelf)  :(
1 beef bouillon cube
1/4 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp jarred minced garlic (no powder on my shelf)
(no onion powder, again didn't have any)
***ordinarily I may have ensured I had those items but I also thought I had taco seasoning on hand.  As it was I had everything else done, attempted to add the seasoning to find that it wasn't there.  ACK!  Thank goodness for this recipe!

I used equal amounts Better than Bouillion creamy beef "base" instead of part of a beef bouillion cube, omitted the salt (as the beef base was quite salty on it's own) and I doubled the garlic powder. I used this to make "salsa chicken" which is basically chicken breast, salsa and taco seasoning left to cook in the crockpot on low all day. This worked perfectly.

While this was soo easy to do, the flavor was spot on. I didn't understand the huge amount of flour in the recipe, other then to use as a thickener. So I'll repeat this again, But reduce the flour by half. Thanks!

Okay, so I multiplied the recipe by six (so 24 servings), cut the flour in half and added some cumin. Then I measured everything (once combined) and came up with 18 TBL., which I then divided by 6. So.....add 3 TBL of mixture and one cup of water to 1 pound of hamburger. Here are the revised measurements:
3/8 cup flour
1/4 chili powder
3 TBL. dried minced onion
1 TBL salt
1-1/2 TBL crushed beef bouillon
1-1/2 tsp. white sugar
1-1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1-1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1-1/2 tsp. cumin
6 dashes onion powder
Yummmmmmm.....

I made this for a taco salad last night. Added the Cumin and also 1tsp of the Goya Adobo seasoning. Loved it and will always have it in the house now. Oh I will try the corn flour next to see if it's even better. Thanks again.

I really liked this, however the submitter said this can be made in bulk. If this is made in bulk, how much of the mix is used with 1 lb of ground beef? And how much water do you add to that 1 lb moisture as well?

I think it is better than the packaged mix. I have so many food sensitivities that I'm glad I can know exactly what is in my seasoning.
I reduced the salt and it is still tasty.

Beef boullion adds nice flavor, change to chicken boullion is needed.  A bit salty, reduced salt to 3/4t.

pre packaged taco seasonings can be expensive, and they are for 1 lb of hamburger, this mixure is very good, only added half of the flour, and i have all of the ingredients on hand always, i buy from the organic bulk bins, at my store, very good deal and i control the salt, which is a good thing, will make it this way for ever, i also added a little cumin, also added 1 cup of cold water to the taco mix, and the it turned out great!

I think this is the second time I've made this recipe & both times it was delicious. I think I left out the sugar since I really didn't think I needed any in this pricey dish. As the writer & a reviewer pointed out one Tbl of flour was plenty. I added anywhere from 3/4 to 1 C of water. With the beef bouillon it didn't really need much salt. If you're going for a low-sodium duet I would leave the salt out entirely since the beef bouillon takes care of the salt, IMHO. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! I ran out of the store bought and made a half batch of this. I used it to make chicken nachos and they were better than I've made before. The flavors were wonderful and blended nicely. I didn't use sugar as I have to watch that stuff. I'm going to make a large batch and have it always on hand! Thank you Kel!!!

I also add cumin to this recipe and I add the bullion cube when preparing the beef. This way the seasoning does not cake while storing.

I didn't change a thing! It's perfect! My only issue is that I tend to use too much of it and it doesn't taste right. I'm still trying to find that sweet spot! But having a tasty time doing it!!

No more store bought EVER!!! The whole family loved it!! Did change it just a tad with a small dash of oregano and cumin. But that's because we just have always added that, I added a dash more Cayenne pepper to mine. I like it hot :)

*I also tried this just the way it was written and we still liked it, we missed the cumin. This is why I love recipes like this, you can change it just a bit and get a whole new taste!

I changed out the flour to corn starch because I'm gluten free. Also didn't have cayenne pepper so I threw in some cumin. I think it's a bit salty (possibly the bouillon) but it was delicious. It did not mention to add any liquid with the meat so I slowly added some water while cooking into the meat otherwise it looked rather dry. Will definitely make this again, but modify the salt.

I was hesitant at first but I made the recipe exactly as written then again with less flour and I prefer the less flour version better (1T to be exact). With food allergies I can no longer purchase premade taco seasoning mixes so this was great. I used 3tsps of seasoning to make shredded chicken (2 breast) tacos and loved it. True test will be my taco dip! Definitely will make again! Thank you!

Used 1 t. chili powder and 1/8 t. cayenne pepper. Used 1 T. flour instead of 2 and 1/4 t. salt instead of 1 1/4 t...glad I did or would have been way too salty b/c I used beef "Better Than Bouillon". Didn't have paprika. I added 1/4 t. cumin.

Really yummy with extra lean beef. ( :

simple seasonings come together for awesome flavor. this is my now go-to taco mix. we use ground turkey and the flour really helps absorb the far too not loose flavor.

I've tried a few other taco seasoning mixes. This one I feel had the best flavour so far (I've tried 2-3 others to date), but I feel that the flour made the meat rather "gooey". Maybe a little more water or less flour would help. Also, not really sure why it needs the sugar in it. Sugar is one of those things that we consume so much of it already in commercially produced food, that I think next time I'll omit it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best seasoning recipe! My family will not eat store bought anymore. My initial reasoning for making homemade seasoning is because my husband will not eat garlic or onions. So I omit those ingredients and add cumin! It's fantastic! I also triple the recipe to keep on hand.

I reduced the flour to a tablespoon, the salt to a teaspoon, subbed ancho Chile powder for the cayenne and omitted the dash of onion powder and then doubled it. My daughter who usually hates anything “taco” because she hates anything with cumin in it LOVED THIS. To my surprise even without cumin it translates to a taco taste. Great!

Terrific recipe!  Prepared exactly as shown and also added a quarter teaspoon of crushed cumin.  Added seasonings with a half cup of water to one pound of cooked ground chuck and this made the best taco salad ever.  We used Catalina salad dressing and the sweetness of the dressing perfectly balances with the spicy seasonings.  I highly recommend 
this recipe!

I have made recipe for years as at home we Re Gluten Free.  Do not trust store bought.  Only difference is that I add the following: 2 tablespoon Cumin, 2 tablespoon Oregano and 2 tablespoon Coriander.   My Tacos are delish and guest always want “my recipe”.  Give it a try you, your family and guest will love it!

I have made a lot of taco mixes and am never happy they give horrible heart burn and still taste like the bag seasoning. this had a different great taste and no burn. think it must be because of cumin. family enjoyed as well

I haven't made it yet so this isn't a review, just did 5 stars because I couldn't not rate it and didn't want to negatively impact . The reason I haven't made it yet is, I am wondering what this is a copycat of? I read all the reviews and not so much as a hint. If you can't mention the name it would be helpful if someone could even say sounds like walko smell (just for example) or something. Just would like to know what I'm going to end up with ??. Thank you in advance!  Sorry if this is a stupid question with an obvious answer...

This is exactly what I wanted for Taco Tuesday.  I was sick of buying the prepackaged stuff, and wanted to start from scratch.  I didn't have any beef bouillon or dried onions, will add next batch.  I used 1/2 small onion diced and fried for a bit in the dried onion's place.  Worked great.  Probably will add a bit of cumin next time.

It was ok but I prefer another recipe I found that has no flour and no sugar. I like the idea of beef bouillon though and I add a little bit to my other recipe.

this has become my go to taco seasoning. Although due to my father's diet restrictions I omit the salt, bullion, and sugar but add cumin and curry to it. my family loves it too, so that's a big plus

12.05.16 ~ I whipped up a quick half batch of this for a casserole I was making. What I like about making my own seasonings is that I can control the salt. This is a great recipe that I will be using again. No sense buying the packets when I always have these ingredients on hand.

i added a teaspoon of Cumin to the basic recipe and maybe just a little more pepper.  All in all it was nicely "hot" for my tastes without overdoing it.   I'm going to make a big batch to have on hand...and I like that it doesn't have preservatives like the packages mixes do!

This was better than any package seasoning!  Even my DH likes it and he would never eat seasoned meat before.  I didn't use the bouillon because I didn't have any but doubt it changed the flavor at all.

Amazing flavour. I have tripled the recipe to store and use more easily in the future. *update* Three years later this is still my go-to taco seasoning. I like it way better than any of the  packaged ones.

Best taco seasoning ever! My husband wont eat any other seasoning anymore. I double or triple the recipe and keep in an airtight jar for quick use later.

Great spice mix! The hubs forgot the taco seasoning from the store so I tried this. Added 1/2 t cumin as well. Will be making tacos this way from now on!

Excellent. I used it to season the Salsa chicken recipe from this site. 
I omitted the beef boulion as I didn't have it and I was using it on chicken. 
Thanks for sharing, a million times better and healthier than those packets you buy at eh store. 
Next time I will make enough to fill a spice jar for easy use whenever.

I made it as written with the exception of adding salt to taste and cumin.  I liked the minced onion.  Cooking it smelled exactly like I'd opened a packet.  However it seemed to be missing something.  I wonder if the paprika could be the issue.  There are so many different kinds.  Really, once you add all of your toppings on a taco, it wasn't noticeable.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this without the flour because my daughter can't have gluten. It has really nice flavour. I like a little more heat. I'll probably add crushed chili flakes next time.

This is a good flavored seasoning mix. I make it in batches and keep it in the pantry.

I'm sure it is  great as written, but had to make a few substitutions for what I had available to me.

     I used granulated onion powder (no minced onion or additional onion powder).

     I omitted additional salt because I felt the bouillon would add enough sodium.

     I used half the amount of flour.

      I added 1 tsp cumin.

     The flavors are  perfect!  My whole family loved it.  I made a double batch the first time and we all liked it so well that I made an additional four batches later the same day to divide up and freeze for use in future dishes like Mexican stuffed shells and Mexican lasagna when I am in a pinch to get dinner ready a little quicker.
     Definitely a keeper!

Like others, I added 1 tsp cumin, and reduced amount of flour by about .5 tbl.  Worked great, better than any other recipe I've tried so far for taco seasoning.
