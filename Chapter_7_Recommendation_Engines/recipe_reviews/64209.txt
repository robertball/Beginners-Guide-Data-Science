I marinated cut up chicken breasts in the yoghurt, lemon mixture and then baked it in the oven.  I thought the flavour was quite ordinary didn't like it at all.

When making this recipe, I did not make the couscous with it.  I cut the chicken into cubes and marinated it in the yogurt mixture for about 3-4 hours; I also tripled the garlic (added 3 cloves).  Because I marinated the chicken in the yogurt sauce, I did not brush any on the chicken and vegetables during the grilling process, but it was still very flavourful - a good recipe for sure.

I marinated the meat and veggies together in the sauce. My husband and I battled over who got to finish off the kabaobs. He, who does not like either peppers or onions, ate everything but the stick. ( Even re-heated my husband said it was 5 stars. )  I skipped the couscous and served warm Asiago cheese bread with it. The crumbled feta I bought had lemon, garlic, and oregano in it and complimented the meal perfectly.

The chicken was ok (hence the two stars) right off the grill but lost its appeal after it cooled down or was reheated. The couscous was terrible! Way too much lemon and parsley - it was inedible. Sorry but this would need major rework if I was to ever try it again.

Chicken was OK as prepared, kind of bland.  Will make again, next time will marinate chicken at least a couple of hours so it will pick up more of the lemon and garlic flavor.  I also added a little dill to the mix.  As for the coucous, made my own.  Prepared plain couscous in chicken broth.  Added feta cheese and diced garden fresh tomato, and about 1.5 tspn lemon juice.

This recipe is very bland. I added a good helping of kosher salt. I like the idea, but I think the chicken does need to marinate...I would consider making a oil and vinegar based marinade with red pepper flakes and then using the yogurt mix with the addition of dill as a dipping sauce. I think the vinegar would also give it the zing it needs.
