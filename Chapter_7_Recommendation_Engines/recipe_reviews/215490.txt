This is excellent! Instead of the oil I used 1/2 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup applesauce. I didn't drain the zucchini. This came out perfectly delicious and moist!

This is a simple, delicious, basic zucchini bread recipe. The result is moist and tender. You could easily add raisins, nuts, or other ingredients to suit your own taste. Tip: to take the moisture out of the zucchini, toss it with 1/2 tsp of salt and set it in a colander over a bowl for about 10 minutes. Press on the zucchini to remove the liquid. Cut back the salt in the recipe to 1/2 tsp.

I cut this recipe in half. I used a teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder and I also used melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I made muffins out of this recipe--I got 12 muffins out of this that were on the big side. 350 for a little over 20 minutes and they were just right. Mine came out a little dry, so next time, I'll add a touch more liquid (a quarter cup or so) and see if that dosen't help. I'll also add a little more nutmeg and cinnamon and to make it lighter, I'll substitute unsweetened applesauce for half the butter and one of the eggs. The kids and I really liked this recipe. Out of twelve muffins, the kids ate over half on their own.

Delicious.  I made this two ways.  One loaf with the full amount of oil and the second loaf with 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. yogurt.  They are both yummy.  The yogurt one is smaller and more dense, but the taste is still good.  I also added raisins.  Yummy.

This is the first time I have ever made a recipe off of this site that had no reviews. I am so happy I did! It was YUMMY! Thanks for a great recipe. Next time I will try to substitute applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and see how it turns out. All the kids loved it! :)

Amazing zucchini bread!  I did not drain my zucchini and really didn't see the need for it.  My batter was very dry and needed the liquid from the zucchini to make it moist after baking.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Awesome recipe. I love that it's whole wheat, that it uses so much zucchini (I actually used 3 heaping cups) and has 4 eggs in it.  The kids loved it, and so did we ;)

Would have given 5 stars, but I found that the bake time and temperature needed adjustment, and loaf pan size wasn't specified. Other than that it was one of the best zucchini breads I've tried.

I WISH I could give this 4.5 or 4.75 stars!!!! Unfortunatly thats not an option. THis bread was VERY good, however, it did not bake correctly at such a low temp. That is my only complaint.
My boyfriend loved it. I don't like nutmeg very much so if I were making it for me then I would omit that. Otherwise, everyone loved it and I have already gotten requests to make it again!

it came out good! i put in only 3 small/med zucchini and baked it for like 65 mins. also i didn't have lemon juice, so i used lemon extract (a capful). max ate the 2 1/2 slices without knowing it had a vegetable in it.

delicious! the only difference i did was 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce. i can't even tell i did a substitution. to one of the loaves, i added 1/2 c chocolate chips. i like it better without. the chocolate is overpowering, but fine if you want to taste chocolate. my big loaf pan was 65 mins and a small foil loaf pan was 75 mins.

This is a great recipe! It was a real hit and everyone liked it.I didn't have whole wheat flour so I substituted it with coconut flakes, I used 1 cup brown sugar and only half 2/3 cups white sugar and added a bit of all-spice, raisins and walnuts. The result: super delicious, more of a cake-bread and not too sweet, the house smelled wonderful while baking it yesterday and today it's all gone already! I'm definately gonna make this often!

Love that it is made with whole wheat flour.  I followed the recipe exactly - 65 minutes was perfect.  The loaves were moist and delicious.  My teenagers devoured them!  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was good. I did do a few alterations though. Instead of sugars I added honey and pure maple syrup and on top of the zucchini I put in coconut and dried cranberries. I also used all whole wheat flour but that was something I wouldn't do again. Did turn out a little dense.

Very nice! Did exactly as is, but made muffins instead of loaves. Temperature was good, time was shorter (I was eye-balling it, approximately 25-30 minutes).

These were good.  I followed the recipe as written except ran out of whole wheat flour after the first cup, so had to sub the remainder with AP flour.  The only other change I made was to sub applesauce for oil.  I made a loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  I cooked at 325 for 60 minutes and the muffins were over done which I believe is why they are so chewy.  The bread actually was fine at this time and temp.

Followed recipe as written, really loved texture and taste!  Next time I will experiment with cutting out some/all of the oil.

I loved the way this came out. It's wonderful just the way it is but I can't help myself with tweaking recipes. When I make it again, I might try using applesauce for some of the oil and will add walnuts. Another recipe I saw used lemon zest. Might try that too.
