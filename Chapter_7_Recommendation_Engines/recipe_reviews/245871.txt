This was a super quick, vegetarian weeknight meal.  I almost always have the ingredients on hand so it's a nice go-to that's healthy (plus my husband plans to take the leftovers for lunch!) The lemon really gives it a nice freshness, also.  Definitely making again.  The only thing I changed was I baked mine instead of frying.  350 for about 15 minutes worked great.

I loved these falafel burgers!  In the past I have had falafel that has been dry, but, these burgers stayed most and had really good flavor.   It is very important to be sure and get as much of the liquid out of the spinach so that the burgers aren't too wet.  I think the tzatziki was the perfect accompaniment.

These were very tasty.. Easy  to make and went well with a variety  of toppings.  Mine didn't really crisp up so the texture was rather soft. Next time I make these, and I will make them again, I am going to add some chopped nuts to give it a firmer bite

These were great! I enjoy falafels and never thought of making a burger out of them. I can see great potential in these patties too - they are not only good to make fresh, but these could easily be made in large batches then frozen for later consumption.

I added a teaspoon of smoked paprika, it seemed to really make the recipe pop.  Remember to make your patties on the ticker side or they rumble.

Flavors were nice, but the patties were much too wet â€” even using fresh spinach rather than canned. I used about 3x as much breadcrumbs and coated each one in breadcrumbs before frying. I think sitting in the fridge probably would have helped. Really tasty as a fork-and-knife sandwich, though!

This recipe did not turn out well for me. The burgers were way too mushy and that was with replacing a 1/3 of the canned spinach with fresh spinach. Also, they were not very flavorful. Would not make this recipe again.

I used a fresh super-greens mix and added extra garlic.  I tossed in more breadcrumbs before the final spin in the food processor because my mix didn't look like it would have held together otherwise. The mix fried up enough to form a crust and went great with this tzatziki sauce: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/claire-robinson/easy-tzatziki-recipe-1924366.

May try to make again with fresh spinach. They were also a bit lacking in spice, next time I will add possibly some Mediterranean spice to them.  And it took a lot more oil than listed to get a nice crisp outside.
