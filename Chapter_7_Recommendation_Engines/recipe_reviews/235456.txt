Made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit!  I used both Bosc and Anjou pears and found the Bosc to work better.  I topped the pears with a tablespoon of mascarpone before drizzling the sauce over the dish.  Next time I'll us a bit of corn starch after removing the pears for a thicker sauce but I wouldn't change anything else.  The sauce that this makes is AMAZING and would stand on it's own as a topping for ice cream or cheesecake which could make for some interesting pairings.

This was delicious! Even better the second day when flavors had time to marinate. I did not use the chocolate sauce; just served it warm with mascarpone cheese at room temperature.

Very easy and supper yummy!

I was able to poach 6 pears with the recipe above.

I dug out extra pear flesh from the core area for extra chocolate filling.

I made these for Thanksgiving.  All that I did differently was I cooked them for a bit longer than the recipe calls for because my pears were still pretty firm.  Once they softened up though and the wine sauce reduced, it was pure love.  I ended up cutting them in half and drizzling dark chocolate sauce on top.  They were a hit!
