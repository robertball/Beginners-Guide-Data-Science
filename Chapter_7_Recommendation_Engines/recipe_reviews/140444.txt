Very, very good soup and super easy! I used whole milk instead of cream and it turned out great. I also blended the soup to give it a nicer texture.Finally, I used neufchatel cheese to cut back on a few calories. Will be passing this on for sure!  Thanks for the great recipe.

My friend made this recipe for a party this past weekend, and everyone raved.  She added a few special touches that I wrote on my copy of the recipe!  Thank you!

Due to what I had available this was great with the following alterations:  minus the cream and tomato juice, plus 2 cups vegetable stock, another cup/8 oz. (I used fresh, peeled) chopped tomatoes (3 tomatoes), substituting bleu for gorgonzola, and fresh shredded basil and parsley which I added on a whim; this was very nice.  SO savory, and elegant.  Paired with a simple green salad, some homemade lox and a dry white wine it was a nice Friday evening supper.  Thanks!!!

A wonderful flavored soup with the cheese taste the topper. I to used an immersion blender to make the soup creamier. I made the soup and then refrigerated it until ready to be served. When reheating, use low heat as it should not come to a boil.

I've only made one other recipe, so I suppose saying this is 'the best' may not carry a lot of merit, but this would easily be a soup you would find in a nice restaurant. I didn't have cream so I used straight milk and since I didn't have tomato juice, was making it out of tomato paste (3/4 c paste + 1 cup water to make tomato sauce, then equal parts sauce/water to make juice) so I added in an extra teaspoon or two of paste as a thickener. It was excellent. I pureed the whole thing and my kids, husband and myself dipped grilled cheese sandwiches into it. Definitely something I'm going to make again and again.

I adjusted the servings to 10 and made this for a teachers luncheon for PTA at my daughters school. The PTA president told me there was a little conflict on who got the last bowl. Don't be afrad to try this if youre not reall fond of gorganzola or blue cheese. i hate both, but this is oneof my favorite soups. the cheese just gives it a creaminess that is sooooo good! LOVE THIS!!!

Great ( and easy) recipe!  I doubled this recipe for a ladies luncheon and glad I did!  It was a hit! I even used reduced fat cream cheese and half-n-half in place of heavy cream.  Although next time I might reduce the amount of cream cheese a bit.

10 Stars! I loved this! (Not exactly a kid favorite, but wonderful for adults.) I made it without a bell pepper and only whole milk-instead of cream and we didn't feel like it was missing a thing. Unlike some reviewers, we really liked the chunky tomatoes and would not suggest using a blender. If you are making the soup for the main part of the meal, keep in mind that it really only makes enough for 2-3 large bowls. After having this for dinner with sub sandwiches, I made this soup again and froze it in freezer bags for another tasty meal! A new favorite!

A delicious tomato soup that was deemed a keeper from the first bite by both adults and kids.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and served in hollowed out bread bowls.  Wonderful, creamy texture with a lovely depth of flavor.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!

Made this for a vegetarian friend who is battling cancer.  It makes a very small portion, so I had to start again on another batch and took advice from others and put that batch in the blender and then added to the first batch for a creamier texture which still had some chunkiness too.  She loved it!!

Fantastic.  I made it as written with one change.  Instead of the cream and milk, I used all canned evaporated milk.  The soup will not curdle if brought to a boil when you use evaporated milk.  It can, and frequently does, if you use regular cream and/or milk.

This was SO good. I modified like some other reviwers; used all milk and no cream, and used roasted red bell peppers, and used my immersion blender.  I used some homemade turkey broth too.  I can't get gorgonzola here, so I use some mild Danish blue.  I didn't use the full amount (did put extra in my bowl) due to a blue-cheese hating fam, but they had no idea it was in there.  Had grilled cheese sandwiches with this- SO GOOD!!!

Good - but considering the time, effort, quality and cost, doctoring up a can of Campbell's with the dairy products listed is just as good, cheaper and faster.

This was so great.  My oldest son asked for tomato soup so I found this recipe and had all the ingredients and it was amazing.  I added some sliced grape tomatoes with the rest of the veggies that I sauted.  I also used my emersion blender and made the soup thicker rather than chunky.  It tastes almost like a spaghetti meat sauce.  I am going to serve it after my son's basketball game with some grilled cheese with sliced pepperoni and I figure it will have the pizza taste to it.

Loved this soup! My husband really enjoyed it as well. I used blue cheese instead of gorgonzola because it was what I had. I also used 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 because we love the flavor of blue. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and used skim milk and 1/3rd less fat cream cheese to cut the fat a bit. It was delicious. I also did the onion, red pepper and canned diced tomatoes in my mini cuisianrt to help with the consistency of the soup! We will definately make this again.

This is excellent soup!  Only suggestions I have is to use a large saucepan because when you start adding all of the ingredients a medium saucepan is not big enough, use fresh basil if you can and don't worry about making sure that the cream cheese is "softened". I put in a frozen block of cream cheese and it was fine because you are cooking it down anyway.  Everyone loved this soup - I made it last night and I'm making it again today because everyone wants more!!  I also transferred to a crockpot to keep warm until dinner - but keep any eye on it so it doesn't burn.  Will be making this over and over.  Thank you for such a great recipe - and SO simple to make!  OH - and I'm going to add some lobster and scallops this time to make a seafood bisque.  YUM.

This was one of the best recipes I have used on Allrecipes.  My husband raved about it. I used an immersion blender to make it a little smoother.  It still left small chunks, which I like better.  I didn't have any red pepper, but next time I am going to try roasted sweet red peppers.

This soup is such a lovely combination of flavor and texture - so soothing! I intended to follow the recipe as is, but forgot to pick up tomato juice while shopping for ingredients. Luckily, I had veggie stock on hand, which worked out just fine. Thanks for this great recipe, I will definitely make it again!

Great flavor!  Used half & half, skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese.  A tad bit too spicy so may reduce pepper just a little next time.  DH loved! 

Made oven baked "grilled" cheese from this site.  Used potato bread, Yarlsburg cheese & olive oil to coat the bread.  Perfectly crispy.  Worked well w/this delicious soup!

This is a very good recipe. Whoever said that it is forgiving was right. I used what I had on hand: Bleu cheese instead of Gorgonzola, pureed tomato instead of the tomatoes and tomato juice, and I accidentally added twice as much plain 2% milk instead of the milk and cream. It was delicious regardless.

I blended about half of the soup, then added it back to the pot for a nice, smooth soup.

I would serve this to company. My husband thinks it would even be good tossed with some pasta.

Very delicious!

Best tomato soup!  The color of the soup was a non issue, especially when you know that it is a creamy tomato.  Don't be afraid of the Gorgonzola, it is not prominent and just adds depth.  This soup was MUCH better than the ready made Tuscan tomato soup from Safeway.

I made this soup for my family and it was awesome. I thought about leaving out the bell peppers because I didn't think I liked them, but they made the soup so much better. I will definitely be making this again!

Love this soup! Only thing I do differently is I use fresh basil and an immersion blender to smooth out the completed soup. Yummy!

I followed Wandering Shikes's suggestions because of what I had on hand as well. This is a delicious soup that I would have never thought to make on my own. Perfect with a grilled ham sandwich. I don't think it makes enough to feed 4 people.

This is THE tomato soup recipe if you want anything other than the red and white can!  Delicious, gourmet-tasting and perfect anytime.  I omitted the onion and bell peppers for a smoother texture and it was perfect.  Yum!

This soup was delicious, even my husband who hates peppers and pretty much everything raved about this. I did make a few minor changes based on what I had on hand. I used half n half , instead of adding the cream cheese I add light sour cream, and I also didn’t have tomato juice on hand so I used 3/4 of a can condensed tomato soup diluted with water until it measured 1 ½ cups mixture.  It was so good and creamy. You just have to try this recipe.

Yum!!!  The only thing I would change next time is to double the batch so we can have leftovers.  I might try putting some salmon it as well to make it like a chowder.  It was very thick and creamy.  I did use V8 instead of tomato juice because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great!!

Excellent and easy to prepare.  I omitted the pepper - didn't have any, used a full yellow onion, and used V8 for the tomato juice - only thing I had.  It came out great.  Will be making this again.

This is a great soup. It will bring a grilled cheese sandwich to "headliner status".......All the notes come together. My hats off to the chef.........Simple and delicious. Can be used to sop the bread..(haha) or a very eloquent dish.

Very interesting and delicious but RICH!  I used Rotelle tomatoes which gave it a nice kick, fresh basil and left it chunky. Thanks for a great recipe Jess!

This was really good. A perfect autumn soup. I added more gorgonzola and dried and fresh basil because I love it. Next time I will blend up the tomatoes B4 adding to get a smoother soup.This tastes even better the next day(if it lasts that long).

Fantastic!  We you first make it the gorgonzola is nice an adds a subtle, not overpowering taste.  After it sits in the fridge the gorgonzola is much more prominent.  Fantastic!

Wow, really loved this soup.  Changed it just a little to lower the fat, (light cream cheese, fat free half and half) and I roasted the pepper before adding as well. Will definitely make again!!

I recently served this at a dinner party, everyone loved it. The only difference I made was I did not have tomato juice so I used bloody mary mix instead. It really gave it a great flavor,also followed the advice of most everyone else and blended it. Topped it off with a bit of gorgonzola. Yummy!

I loved the flavor. My husband did not like it as well and he couldn't get over the color. I thought it looked like pepto bismal but he thought it looked worse. I know I won't make this again.

This was pretty good, but I don't think it was worth the effort. 

I left out the red pepper and used half and half and reduced fat cream cheese. I also used an immersion blender on it, though it didn't work great. 

I think next time I'd just toss some gorgonzola crumbles and basil into a can of cream of tomato soup!

This soup was truly outstanding.  The ONLY thing I might change is either to dice the onions much finer, or blend the soup before adding the cheese for a smoother consistency.  Even without the smooth consistency, the soup was truly awesome, and my mom, who hates tomato soup, went back for seconds and asked for the recipe.

Really good soup! My friend and i made this, and were pleasantly surprised. The soup has a great texture and is very filling. We used feta and a small amount of bleu cheese instead of the gorgonzola. The feta made it very thick and creamy, while the bleu cheese gave it a nice flavor. Very easy to make.  Highly recommend!

While this tasted good, I couldn't get it out of my head that it was more like a creamy pasta sauce than a soup, so that's why I can't rate it higher.  But I bet it would be great on pasta!

This was just okay for me...I used yellow pepper bc the store didn't have red pepper in stock.  It had a nice flavor, but I was the only one in the house that liked it.  If I make it again, I would go with other reviewers and puree the veggies to make a creamier, less chunky soup.

Excellent soup!  Didn't have gorgonzola cheese so we used feta.  Blended the tomatoes and coarsely chopped red pepper before adding it to the soup.  Gave it a wonderful texture.  Not to chuncky.  I will definately make this again.

I love blue vein cheeses & tomato soup, but apparently not tgether.... the Gorgonzola was really overpowering and other than that the soup was kind of thin  :-/

Very good. I did run it through the blender since my husband doesn't like "chunky" soup, but everything else is according to the recipe. The color was a little odd, but it tasted so good that it didn't matter. I think it probably would have been even better with fresh basil rather than dried. I really liked the flavor (and vitamin A) that the bell pepper gave the soup. I think it would have also been very good with a sourdough baguette accompaniment.

What a hit! Since we are watching our calories and fat, I simply exchanged Fat Free Cream Cheese and used 1/4 c Skim Milk (instead of heavy cream) for a total of 1/2 c Skim Milk.  Since I didn't have Gorgonzola Cheese, I added a grated Parmesan/Romano blend.  I also ran my stick blender through the saucepan a few times for a less chunky version.  Served with warm mozzarella quesadillas... I couldn't have asked for more!!

I can't say enough good about this soup - it is fantastic. I'm going to serve it at our next dinner party. The flavour is wonderful for a tomato soup (and I've made a few in my time). The only changes I made were to use 1 1/2 tbsp of fresh chopped basil, and I diced up canned whole tomatoes. I didn't blend it as some reviewers have suggested - I like chunky soups.  My husband really enjoyed this, too. Thanks for the awesome recipe Jess.

Real nice flavor.  It was my first time making tomato soup and the recipe was easy to make and delicious.  I used the neufschatel cheese instead of the cream cheese and I, too, used an immersion blender to make it creamy.  My husband loved it!

This soup is awesome.  Very flavorful and even better reheated the next day.  Two small changes - I used fresh basil and red pepper instead of white for a little more kick.  Took reviewers suggestion and blended with immersion blender - Fantastic thanks for great recipe!

This soup is incredible! It's so rich and creamy and savory! After simmering for 15 minutes, I used my immersion blender on the soup which resulted in the smoothest, silkiest, creamiest texture imaginable. Holy  cow I love this soup! I'm so glad I tried it.

This was delicious!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and milk, and frozen basil from last years garden, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I can't wait to try this with fresh tomatoes and basil!  However, I'm not sure the calculated calories for this recipe are correct, seems low for that much dairy.

This soup was delicious, tastes like it came from a restaurant! The gorgonzola really gives it the perfect burst of flabor. The only changes I made were using reduced fat cream cheese and half & half instead of heavy cream. It still tasted amazing with these changes.

Not good at all. I love tomato soup and tried this. Not good at all. Maybe too much cream cheese.... Not worth it to find out. After all of the good reviews i guess i was expecting something really good!
Im taking this review back. I froze what was left over and probably a month or so later thawed it out and reheated for my hubby.  
I will make again but with less of the cheese.

Well - I am sure that if you like gorgonzola this is a GREAT recipe.  I followed another reviewers suggestion who said it didn't matter if you didn't like gorgonzola / blue cheese.  Well.  I disagree. My whole house smells like gorgonzola, and it completely overpowered the soup.  Will not make again.

I've been on the hunt for the best tomato soup. This one is my favorite so far. Only modifications I made was adding a pinch of salt, fresh basil rather than dried, and running it through the food processor for a smoother texture. Great flavor!

WOW!  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WAS TO USE ONLY 1 CUP TOMATO JUICE AS I LIKE IT A LITTLE CREAMER AND I CHOPPED UP THE TOMATOES MORE.   MY HUSBAND LOVED IT ALSO!

Not at all what I had expected after reading rave reviews.  I love cheese but the gorgonzola over powered the light tomato flavor that I had hoped for.

This is the first review I have posted on Allrecipes.  I followed this recipe exactly and this is the best tomato soup I have ever tasted.  I think it is DELICIOUS.   What a wonderful, rich, tasty soup.

I love this soup, I made a couple of changes based on what I had in the cupboard...I used condensed tomato soup instead of the the tomato juice and also used half and half rather than the heavy cream and milk....Still very tasty. Finally had fresh basil instead of dried. Yum!

Soup was delicious.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream, and frozen stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato juice.  Served with crumbled Gorgonzola cheese sprinkled on top.

This soup is delicious!  My roommates are still raving about my soup.  I lightened up this recipe by using 2 c. veggie stock (as someone else recommended) and by using 4 oz. fat free cream cheese.  I left out the red pepper because I'm not a big fan of those.  Will make this again!

Not impressed. Way too chunky and bland. tastless and mealy. You must use food processer or blender.  This is way too rich and thick.  This is more like a dip and very non figure friendly.

considering how easy this is to make i would never have believed a 5* taste unless i had tried it myself.  I replaced diced tomato's for chunked tomatoes with italian accents in the can.  I gave it all a real quick puree at the end leaving small bits  -  my husband raved -- and so easy

Very good, very easy. I wanted to make this but didn't have gorogonzolla cheese, so used freshly grated parmesan. It was wonderful. Will make again. Next time I may put it into the blender so it is smooth.

I made this for lunch today so I just sat down to write a nice little note. Very tasty made as written no additions or changes. I did use an immersion blender to smooth it out a little bit. Thank You for the recipe, easy and made a wonderful lunch.

Oooh this was goood! I poured half of the soup into the blender to mix it up better, but left the other half to leave some chunky tomatos. Otherwise I followed as written. (Fresh basil is a must!)

This was easy and wonderful.  I substituted smoked gouda for gorgonzola, which was more accessible to me. It was perfect, and coming from a not-so-good cook it was too easy :) I will definitely make this again!

I personally could have done without the bell pepper.  I also blended the soup so it wasn't as chunky, halved the cream cheese, and upped the gorgonzola.  Next time i'll probably use plain rice milk and fresh tomatoes if they're in season and nix the pepper.  But i will make again; it was very good.  I really enjoyed the combination of gorgonzola and tomato.  Thanks :)

Very good flavor but I would've liked a smoother consistency. Next time I may puree all the ingredients to eliminate the chunks.

This soup was delicious. Very rich, but oh so good. I first served it without blending it and it was fine, but was left wishing that I did blend it. Before packing up the leftovers (made a double batch for a pre-mother's day dinner), I used an immersion blender and it was much better with the smoother texture. I used half and half and reduced fat cream cheese, and then served with some parmesan crisps from trader joe's. Can't wait to finish the rest!

Simply fantastic.  I realized too late that I didn't have any tomato juice, so I simply used 3/4 cup mushroom tomato sauce and 3/4 cup water, and it was really good.  Nice and rich without being over the top.

Like most reviewers, I made a couple of minor changes... substituted FF sour cream for the cream cheese and 1/2 c. half&half for the cream + milk. I don't have an immersion blender, so I strained out the chunks and, consequently, a lot of the flavor. Add some salt, maybe a bit more gorgonzola. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was wonderful, I added mushrooms to it to give it some more weight.

I made this soup for my family and EVERYONE LOVED it.  I made a few changes though -- I used fat free half and half instead of the cream and I also used goat cheese instead of gorgonzola simply because I love the combination of goat cheese and tomatoes.  Great Recipe! Will definitely make again!

I make a lot of soup and this is by far the best soup I've ever had.  It was so easy too.  Even picky kids liked it.

This soup has such great flavor! I added alittle more Gorgonzola cheese than in the recipe, and added some lemon juice as well. This soup turned out chunkier than expected, but it still tasted amazing. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

I've been making this soup for years small changes here and there due to ingredients on hand (like spicy V8 instead of tomato juice adds a nice little zip but tried clamato once and wasn't as impressed) but mostly I just try and stick to the recipe because if it ain't broke don't fix it

Will be my go-to homemade tomato soup recipe. Followed recipe quite closely, but omitted the sugar and also held back the gorgonzola and used it only as a garnish - because I have little kids eating. So, so delish!  Husband loved it too!

Snowed in, and needed something to warm us up.  Tomato anything is kind of risky around here, because only one of us is particular fond of them.  Same with the gorgonzola.  Afraid by trying to make this appeal to everyone, I might end up with no on liking it.  Decided to go all in and double it just in case.  This is an example of the whole being much better than the parts individually.  The creaminess of the cream cheese balances out the zing of the tomato. The bite of the goronzola balances out the twang of the cream cheese. The tomato balances out the bite of the gorgonzola. Nothing dominates. Just great compliments.  I also worried that it was an awful lot of basil, but it was just right. The one thing I have to question about the recipe is, why equal parts cream and milk?  Isn't that what half & half is?  That's what I used, and it worked great. This is a perfect soup to warm your soul, and to dunk grilled cheese sandwiches in.  Don't let any individual ingredient scare you off.

Fan-freakin'-tastic!  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden in lieu of the canned diced.  I also used my immersion blender to smooth out the consistency a bit.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

I shouldn't comment, because I thought I had almost no ingredients but tomato juice and cream cheese, but decided to try anyway. But I found some tomatoes in the can, and added that, and basil, and did locate some of the other ingredients. It was great. I did run it through the blender because the husband likes a smoother soup. The cream cheese with the tomato juice itself was so good, I almost stopped there. Anyway, now I'm going to put cream cheese in all my cream soups (as a sub for cream), because I loved that flavor.

Served with bacon sandwiches.

so good! i didn't have tomato juice but i did have a 28oz can of tomatoes, so i subbed the whole thing, blended it up in and it's delicious; it's true the recipe is very forgiving.  keeping this one on hand!
