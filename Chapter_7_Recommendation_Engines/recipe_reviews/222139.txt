I don't make cookies too often, but this recipe is awesome.  I am always trying to bake or cook healthier.  These cookies have a great taste and are nice and chewy.  Just the way my husband and I like cookies.  Thank you so much for coming up with a healthier version of peanut butter cookies. I will definitely try this recipe again.

Great recipe, but did she really mean to preheat the oven for an hour?

My kid's liked these but not enough to make a whole batch of cookies disappear in a day like usual cookie recipes. I didn't really like them...the flavor was off to me.  They also spread while baking. They were a nice chewy cookie but that is about it. I ended with 3 dozen and 4 cookies using my cookie scoop. I would look into alternate ways to make a peanut butter cookie healthy such as using whole wheat flour, reducing the amount of sugar etc. in the future.

Very yummy!! Mine came out fluffy (not like in picture). Made mine with organic sugar free apple sauce and natural peanut butter so the cookies were mild tasting and not as rich/sweet as you usual pb cookie, but it's a "healthier" cookie.  I also used organic flower Will make them again for sure.

This is an awesome recipe--I love it! I used a combo of natural  Peanut butter and cashew butter to use up some of these that have been in my fridge for awhile and they turned out great--not as sweet as normal Peanut butter cookies, but I liked that about them. I also used some of the batter to make the little witches ' hats using dark chocolate  kisses and those turned out really good, too. This is now my go-to Peanut butter cookie recipe. Thank you for sharing!
