I ALMOST gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the salt should go in with the dry ingredients instead of wet.  salt slows yeast down and keeps yeast slow if you put it in with the yeast at the start (some yeast gets killed) but if the salt is diluted by the rest of the ingredients then the yeast will not die.

I corrected you error in my making of it and it made an awesome loaf of bread!  I think getting rushed forced me into not letting it raise enough but it still tasted great.

I recently came across an article on making bread that the person turned an oven into a proof box by putting a pan of water on the lower shelf and heating the oven to lowest setting about 150 degrees and once it reaches that, put the loaves into the oven after turning it off.  the water will retain some of the heat and evaporate causing a high humidity environment for yeast to thrive.

I used this recipe last year to make my stuffing and it was wonderful! This weekend I am going to use it to make open faced turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes, gravy and homemade cranberry sauce.

Great recipe.  Added a little more sage. Used my Kitchenaid mixer to knead. Makes great toast topped with a little cream cheese.  This will be added to my holiday recipes.

I have used this for the last couple of years now.  Going to cook a turkey this weekend so I am making the bread today.  Will use one and freeze one for the next time I decide to roast a turkey.  I used to send one loaf to my mom and she would use it for her turkey sandwiches :)  I usually double the spices as I really like savory stuffing.  When

This is a good recipe. I didn't follow the instructions strictly though.
Substitutions: chicken better than boullion, thyme for savory. I added 1 tablespoon of rosemary I crushed by hand, and I used 3 flours, white AP, whole wheat, and white bread flour. I didn't add any salt because better than bouillon is salty enough on its own. 

I put the water, yeast, and sugar together then beat the eggs into that after proofing (since they're still cold). Mixed the flours and herbs in a separate bowl, then put the wet and dry all into my stand up mixer bowl, stirred it a bit and then let the dough hook do the rest of the work. 

After rising in a warm oven with a pan of water, I divided the dough ball evenly using my scale, and made half into a loaf and the other into rolls. 

I baked at the recommended temp, but the rolls came out at 15 minutes, the loaf at 25.

The rolls are tasty, the loaf deflated during baking somehow. I would make this again for rolls.

I made this last year.  After I made it I sliced and cubed it and let it dry out and used it for our turkey dressing.  It was wonderful!!  All I had to do was add onions, celery, butter and chicken broth, we don't like anything else in it.  I'm making it again this year.

I made this the other day, I have been looking for a stuffing bread that I could dry to use in casseroles as I am allergic to soya (as you know it is in EVERYTHING!) this really if the bill! It seemed to sagey at first but when I dried it in the oven it came out perfect. Now all I have to do is measure out two cups of croutons add some dried onion flakes and hot stock and I'm in stuffing heaven. I tend to use stuffing on top or in the middle of my casseroles instead of potatoes or rice. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this with spring wheat flour. LOVED this recipe! Baked in cast iron bread pans.  Our home smelled wonderful. I did not have savory, had to substitute with marjoram.  When I went to use it for stuffing, the night before I cube it and let it dry out on jelly roll pans. They dried out perfectly.  The final result was an incredibly aromatic smell and flavor. The texture was not too dry nor wet. Which is best when topping with gravy. I printed this out for my mother and sister. This was linked from Cast Iron cooking FB page. Thanks for this recipe. It is now in my recipe book.

Made this for the first time last night and it turned out great!  Only one thing i did different because out of the dozens upon dozens of spice containers for some reason none of them were sage, so i had to skip on that one and added a little extra savory to try and compensate, however it turned out pretty awesome either way.

Aside from not having the sage, i did was other reviewers mentioned and left the salt and egg out of the yeast mixture  and gave it about 10-15 minutes to rise first before adding those in. 

The rest of it was per instruction and when it was done i could smell the herby goodness from the basement.  It was hard to wait for it to cool down enough but patience paid off and i was able to slice into it, and finally cube it up. 

I only needed to cube one loaf of the two this recipe made, makes a ton of bread!  Its on a sheet pan now air drying for the next couple days before thanksgiving. just gotta remember to toss the cubes every now and again so they dry evenly!  

Will definitely be using this recipe again, and maybe experimenting a little bit now that i can successfully make a good base.

My husband loves stuffing, so I thought I would try this bread.  The bread was very flavorful and some likes it with butter and others liked it plain.  The only thing I changed was I added an additional Tbs of sage.  We re heated it a day later in a warm oven and it was still moist and delicious

I make this every year for Thanksgiving.  It makes two HUGE loaves!  I cube one loaf and use it to make stuffing, the second we use for leftover sandwiches.

This recipe made enough stuffing for a 22pound turkey, and an extra loaf of bread for sandwiches with the leftovers.  I realized too late that we forgot to add the sugar to the yeast, but fortunately it rose and turned out well.  I'm not a fan of dill so we skipped that, and we used chopped fresh sage with some Bells Poultry Seasoning.  This will be our stuffing bread for years to come.

The overall color was  an unpleasant gray due to the herbs/seasonings used. As it baked, it smelled phenomenal. Used in my family stuffing/dressing recipe, it did not enhance the outcome. I did not think the outcome was worth the added effort.

I decided to use my bread machine to make this (yeah, I'm lazy!). Aside from using bread machine yeast, and thyme instead of savory, I pretty much did it as written (although I did put the salt in with the dry ingredients as one review suggested). Haven't made the stuffing out of it yet, but I did taste it and it's really good!

Made our holiday stuffing very special.  Thanks for the idea.  Season to your own traditions and pallet.
