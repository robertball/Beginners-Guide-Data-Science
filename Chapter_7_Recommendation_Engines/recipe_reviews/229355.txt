Only change I made was to use butter. Delicious, great texture, baked up perfectly. 
This will be my new go-to biscuit recipe!
A tip is to grate the butter into the flour mixture, then just stir together - great way to get the butter into the right size pieces.

I used butter in place of shorting and whipping cream in place of milk, a crunch of sea salt on
the biscuits just out of the oven, and made the most delectable, perfect biscuits ever!  A slight crunch
in the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside.  : )

Fluffy, just a tad sweet and plump enough that you can skip rolling and cutting - super easy!

I have only made biscuits once, and this is my second recipe I've tried and it's great! It does have a distinct sweetness, but I like it! I added a little shredded cheese to jazz mine up and they turned out so well I almost didn't believe it was me who made them! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is an awesome biscuit recipe! My mom, who has always followed her mom's recipe, asked me for this one after eating these drop biscuits!

Please note: I also made a batch where I rolled the dough out and cut the biscuits. My husband loved them because they were much easier to pull apart, but their is a difference in texture when you roll them. My mom and I both preferred the drop biscuits to rolling and cutting this recipe..

It's really hard to find a good biscuit recipe - and lo-and-behold, found one! Oh boy, it was fluffy and absolutely delicious. It's great on it's own or with something (I made this initially to go with Chicken and onions pan fried in honey). Husband loved it a lot, and I'm definitely going to make this again. I did leave out the cream of tartar, and substituted the shortening for butter. I also did the ball method instead of the cut-out. Came out perfect. Enjoy!!

As suggested by other members, I used butter rather than shortening.  That's the only thing I changed, and the biscuits turned out perfectly!  Two thumbs up from both my little boys.  Next time, will try adding grated cheddar.

These were so fluffy and delicious. Great recipe! It's important to 1. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS make sure you use fresh (or fairly new) flour and baking powder (it makes all the difference in the world with recipes that use flour as the main ingredient) and 2. do not pack the flour! If the recipe calls for 2 cups flour and you pack it, it will end up being 4 cups or more resulting in very dry and rock like biscuits. Again, these biscuits were amazing. Thanks for a great recipe!

Simple recipe, delicious results.  The cream of tartar is not necessary. I also prefer to use real butter over shortening.  Rather than drop the dough onto sheet, I prefer to spread it out with my hands onto my baking sheet and score lightly so I can break them apart or cut with a knife. I like my biscuits with more flavor so I typically add grated cheese to them. I also added chopped jalapeno on this occasion which went fantastic with my home made spaghetti sauce! Thank you for this recipe! I always used to think that the only way to make great biscuits was with buttermilk but this recipe proves me wrong!

This is a very soft and moist biscuit.  My whole family loved them and they were so easy to make!  I did as another person suggested and used butter in place of the shortening. I also used half/half instead of the milk.  I may cut the sugar back to 1 tbsp next time so they don't have too much of a sweetness.  Don't get me wrong.  The very light sweetness was good, it's just a personal preference.  These would be good to add some garlic powder and cheddar to.  YUM!  I can't wait to give that a try!

I just made these and I'm thinking that I'll use this same recipe for drop biscuits from now on!!  It's a cold, snowy day here in MN so my sister prepared beef stew and I made these biscuits.  My sister, brother-in-law and I agreed that they were the fluffiest biscuits we'd ever tasted.  The only things I did differently were butter instead of shortening and I cut down the sugar to 1 TBSP.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

I usually just make biscuits from a mix, but didn't have any, and needed a recipe for biscuits for a quick dinner of biscuits and gravy. Found this recipe, and it was wonderful! I made exactly as written.  I didn't even want the gravy on them, and just ate mine with butter. The texture of these is wonderful, too!  It's a keeper!

These weren't bad, by any means - they just weren't knock you socks off good.  As others have mentioned, they were somewhat dry - which was confusing as the dough itself was nice & moist.  Very strong baking powder taste which I guess is what turned us off a bit.  With biscuits & gravy, these would be quite good.  On their own, however, I'd try something else...

Great recipe!  The biscuits are super easy to make and turned out golden and fluffy!  I used butter-flavored shortening.  I love the light hint of sweetness (cornbread-esque) and the light crunch on the outside with very tender middle.  My hubby is not a bread fan but rated it 9 out of 10 (in 12 years of marriage, I've only seen him rate a food item a 10 twice).  Thanks for sharing!

EXCELLENT! My Husband found these to be his new favorite over my own personal roll out. Tender, moist, yet FLUFFY!! I did use 1/4 C Butter and 1/4 C Shortening, only because I was low on the shortening and they turned out MAGNIFICANTLY!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's our new go to favorite for certain! YUMMMM! :) God Bless!

This was by far the best baking powder biscuit that I have ever had. The only change that I made was to sub becel for the shortening because I was out of shortening. There were just the four of us and all 12 were gone in a flash. If I could I would rate these a 10 I would!!! Many thanks.

It's really simple (even for people, like me, who are brand new at cooking!)  I got brave and added some honey the second time I tried this, which finished 'hiding' the taste of baking powder.

Dry and crumbly.  Followed directions and ingredients exactly.  Sort of bland.  Maybe they need some butter instead of straight shortening.  Won't try again, too many other biscuit recipes to try.  Thanks for the recipe.

I must have really missed something, they came out looking good, but the taste was horrible. There is an after taste that taste like baking soda! Maybe I'll alternate the shortening for butter and use less baking soda  and see how it turns out.

I just pulled these out of the oven. I loved the textures;short on the outside but melt in your mouth softness on the inside! I substituted light brown sugar for one of the tbs and used 1/4 c butter and a 1/4 c of Crisco. I also added 1/8 tsp cinnamon to give it a hearty flavor. I am having one with a cup of coffee as I type!

Made these as we were out of bisquick. The whole family has decided no more bisquick biscuits in this house ever. Very very good. Will definitely make from now on.

Delicious! I made these this morning with butter instead of shortening, and they turned out wonderful. First time making biscuits, and I didn't have any problems, so I would definitely recommend these!

Wonderful recipe - these are soooo fluffy! I did not use the cream of tartar (did not have any) and substituted oil for the shortening. I also did not use sugar because I was making sausage gravy for them, but I will add it when I make them to eat with honey or jam. Perfection - they will be my go to recipe for biscuits now!

I made these for the first time this morning and boy are they tasty!  My only substitution was butter for shortening.  (Thanks  to the reviewer who suggested shredding the butter into the dry ingredients.  That saved a ton of time over using the dough cutter.)  As mentioned by others, they're a little on the sweet side, but hubby has a major sweet tooth so we didn't mind.  I dropped them on the pan to bake and they baked up tall, tasty, and golden on top.  However, they were super crumbly which wouldn't have been a problem if I was doing biscuits and gravy.  I was craving butter and jam though and there was no slathering anything on these.  I'll try rolling and cutting the dough next time to see if they hold together better.  I'll for sure try this recipe again for the ease and good taste.  Thanks!

Update:  I made them again this morning and rolled them out.  They turned out so much better this time!  We liked the consistency much better and the taste was still awesome.

These just don't press at all, maybe due to lack of baking soda? The texture is pretty good, was just disappointed with the size. Also, would not recommend a dark dish to bake them in, mine burned on the bottom in the non-stick pan but not in the glass pan.

I made these for my family and they were great! I forgot to add the sugar, but they turned out just fine. I grated the butter like someone suggested and I think that was a great idea. When I dropped them onto the baking sheet I squashed them down a little to flatten the tops also. I definitely recommend making these.

These were fantastic!! I didn't have shortening or cream of tartar, so I just used butter and skipped the cream of tartar. I almost fell in the floor when I tried these! They are so delicious!

Made no changes,  except for using butter - 1 stick unsalted butter, frozen. I used cheese grater to grate it. Cooked at 450 for ten minutes, might try 400 or even 375 for 10 minutes next time, were tiny bit over done. Also new high grade cookie sheet may have been the reason.

This is the best biscuit I've ever made! I used this recipe for chicken and dumplings, so I didn't roll and cut, just dropped spoonfuls into the chicken broth. Deliciousness! Definitely not a dieter's biscuit. Rich and flavorful. I bet you could cut back on the amount of shortening or butter and still have a good biscuit. I made it with butter, the full amount. The leftover from what I needed as dumplings, I baked as normal biscuits. Again delicious, but there was a lot of butter melted on the pan. My husband actually ate a biscuit without added butter, jam, or honey and loved it even though it was a day old! This will be my go-to every time, with a little less butter.

The best biscuits! I have searched and searched endlessly and these by far are the best that I have come across. I did cut the sugar in half. Other then that... By the book. I now make these anytime I need biscuits!

Egg does not belong in a biscuit mix.  It made them too dense.  Second round without the egg was better but dough was a little tough from all the kneading.  I would suggest that you handle the dough as little as possible after turning it out onto a floured board.  Kneading it 10 times made it way tough.

These are amazing homemade biscuits and no buttermilk needed! My grand-daughter is the ultimate picky eater and these get 2 thumbs up from her ; )  I just knead a little extra flour into the dough (no more than 10 folds) and cut them out. Makes a dozen 2 inch biscuits

These are the sweetest fluffiest biscuits I have ever made. The only thing better than one of these biscuits, fresh from the oven with a bit of butter and jam, is a cinnamon roll made with this biscuit batter.

Pretty good recipe! It didn't blow me away, but it was good for sure. I think I'll try butter instead of vegetable shortening next time.

I added cheddar cheese, and pickled jalapeños... And a tiny bit of honey in the milk and egg mixture.  

Definitely worth a try!!

Terrific.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  My family really loved these - over our standard buttermilk biscuits.  They are slightly sweeter and more crumbly than the buttermilk version.  Super easy to make - and quick to fit in after everything else is done cooking and the kids are setting the table.  Will definitely make these again.

Hmm I made these tonight and I'm a little undecided about them. They weren't bad, but I've had better. I wish they were a little more fluffy & moist. I made them for my parents, and they really liked them. I used butter in place of shortening. I did like the convenience of not having to roll and cut them.

Good easy recipe.  The biscuits were very tender and tasted good.  I used butter instead of shortening and did as the footnotes said and added flour so I could handle it to cut the biscuits with a biscuit cutter.  Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe exactly like described and I have also used butter and shaved the butter into the flour. I love both but if I have butter I will use butter instead just for personal preference. I'm so happy I found this recipe!!!

Excellent biscuits, almost the same as our old recipe that was on here but now gone. Only difference was this has 4 tsp. baking powder, the old one had 3 tsp. Both are super good right out of the oven, or left over..

I made these biscuits for a Mother's Day brunch and served them with sausage gravy. O-M-G were they ever great. Only change I made was following other reviews, I made them with butter instead of shortening. They were so light and fluffy! Great with butter and jam too! I highly recommend these for anything - breakfast, lunch or dinner! (I dropped them rather than cutting them out.) This one will be used OFTEN!!!!

I also used butter instead of shortening. I had no cream of tartar but the biscuits still came out fluffy and flavorful. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I substituted butter for shortening in this recipe. These biscuits are hard to describe because they are both fluffy and dry. They are EXTREMELY crumbly. They aren't great for butter/apple butter/jelly but they would certainly be good with gravy. I gave this recipe 4 stars because I do believe, that without my substitution, they would have been less crumbly. (By the way, my kids love them. My son calls them spiky-biscuits because of the golden brown peaks on top!)

AMAZING biscuits.  Very light and fluffy - the only sad part is I don't think my family will be letting me get away with canned biscuits ever again.

One caution - I had to check very conscienciously for the last 5 minutes - one batch I delayed a minute or so (was juggling gravy) and bottoms scorched a little.  With that in mind - perfect, fluffy biscuits.

Great biscuits!    I patted my dough out and cut the biscuits using a large biscuit cutter.  I wanted big, thick biscuits and that is just what I got!

These biscuits we’re so easy to make. I didn’t have cream of tartar so I used vinegar.  I poured the biscuit mix out and patted it down, using a knife to cut out squares. Delicious!

Made exactly as recipe states with butter flavored shortening!
It makes 12 really large drop biscuits.   I was pleasantly surprised how much batter there was and how big the biscuits  turned out!

Made the recipe as is. Simple biscuits like Nanny used to make. She would drop hers and I chose to pat mine. (Used a jelly jar to cut them out).
Great for a quick, no-rise biscuit!!

As with many others recommended, I grated in butter instead of shortening. Such light buttery biscuits. It will be my permanent recipe.

I didn't change anything, but I think I might next time. The biscuits were light and fluffy. However there is an aftertaste from the cream of tartar. I may use less next time.

These were too sweet and they did not rise as expected and I used fresh baking powder.  I can control the sweetness but they just did not turn out the way I thought they should. 
Will be looking for a different recipe.

Love these! I'm usually a buttermilk kind of guy, but these are perfectly moist and crumbly at the same time. Pro Tip: When dropping them on the baking sheet, make sure each one is mostly together rather than just plopped down. That way they will rise better rather than look like the state of Florida, lol. Either way...scrumptious!

Delicious! I used butter and increased sugar to 1/4 cup to make a sweeter biscuit. I reduced oven temperature to 425 and reduced baking time otherwise the biscuits would have been overdone. My family loves them.

This is my go-to recipe for biscuits. As a southern woman, it's always been a joke in my family that I can't make biscuits to save my life.  This recipe changed it all! I leave out the sugar, but other than that, don't change a bit. Now my family can't harass me as a failed southern cook anymore!

I tried these on Mother's Day, and I forgot to add the egg.  They turned out very tasty.  "Fluffy and light" I noted on the recipe.  The J.P.'s recipe biscuits were a bit  moister; I like them on the doughy side.  Then I tried Grandma's again last night, with the egg.  Oh My Gosh.  They were so good I was glad I had only made one recipe because I could have eaten half a dozen at a sitting.  They were moist and buttery (I used butter Crisco) even without any butter.  Adding honey took delicious and made it divine.  I can't wait til tonight...I have to make them again, mmmm.

Post note: I have been making these for a while, they are my definite go-to biscuit recipe.  The other day I was making them after midnight and, bleary eyed, I got the amounts for the shortening and the milk confused.  I put in 2/3 c butter Crisco.  I noticed right away while cutting in the shortening (it was moister than I had come to expect) so I reduced the milk to compensate.  It turned out noticeably better, very buttery flavored and with an almost shortbread like texture that people commented on.  Big hit...so now I use 2/3 c butter Crisco and 1/2 c milk.

I love these biscuits. I lost my original recipes that i got from my mother in-law, 30 years ago and found this one to replace it. This recipes almost replaces it completely. I make these all the time for my church family, they rave about the biscuits. I use butter and add extra butter. Biscuits come out most and yummy every time. Sometimes i replace the milk with cream and they come out a bit heavier and moist.

Very easy. These are fluffy and flavorful. I made them as drop biscuits. Drizzle a bit of honey over the top. Great recipe.

The only change I made was to use butter which I use in everything anyways.  It is such a quick recipe and works really well to just 'drop'.  There is no need to do them any other way!

The only change I made was to use butter.   We used the biscuits tonight with strawberries and milk.  We call it strawberry shortcake even if it is biscuits instead of cake.  There are six in our family and there was not a biscuit left.   Everyone liked them better than any we have tried before.

I made these last night. I substituted butter for the shortening, halved the sugar and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. These were SO easy and quick to make. No more rolling dough! I'll definitely keep and make this recipe again. Thank you for a great recipe. I served these with Southern tomato gravy.

Nice job “Grandma!”.  I’ve tried a lot of homemade biscuit recipes but many of them have that “floury” or baking powder taste that we don’t like.  This recipe caught my eye because it called for sugar and I thought that might help improve the flavor some…. and it did.    We used them for biscuits and gravy and my family really liked them.  The only thing I would do different is (if using for biscuits and gravy) cut back on the sugar by half (1 T instead of 2).  Otherwise, I would leave them as they are.  Will definitely make again!

These biscuits came out perfectly for me. I was proud to serve them a the dinner table to my family. I am making them a second time tonight to go with our Beef Stew. 
I think as long as you don't pack the flour when measuring and sift dry ingredients these biscuits will not turn out dry. Also make sure you blend your shortening in well.
Thanks for the great recipe!!

I used lard. I cut the lard into 1 cm cubes and rolled each one in the dry ingredients before using a pastry blender. Dropped into shallow oiled muffin tin. Made a dozen for 4 people. Went to get one of 4 left-over the next day after my teenage son had raided the refrigerator, and there they were...GONE!

The second time I tried grating the shortning into a kitchen aid mixer containing the dry ingredients while it is running. Looked great going into the oven.

This is my go to recipe for baking powder biscuits. I have made them several times. Times with butter. Times with shortening. We love them all ways. I make them larger than directed so they have to bake longer. But that gives a big soft inside :). I have never used the tartar as I have never had it on hand. They are no fail. They are easy to also use as a base as many people have said for herb. Or herb and cheese. Or onion. Or onion and cheese. Fantastic.    Tonight they are for chicken and biscuits. Yummy.   Thank you!

I made this without changes to the recipe except I used butter instead of shortening. I also took a reviewers suggestion and used a cheese shredder to cut in the butter. It worked fabulously and I will do it this way from now on. I used the biscuit as a topping on my chicken pot pie and it was delicious.

I recently tried these biscuits and they are delicious--white on the inside, soft, moist and golden brown on the outside. Instead of shortening, however, I substituted lard. I have a convection oven so I had to adjust the temperature 25 degrees less than the recommended temperature. It's the best biscuit I've ever tried.

I usually just make the biscuit recipe on the side of the baking powder can, but I bought Trader Joe's baking powder, which doesn't have a recipe on it, so I turned to allrecipes for an alternative. My whole family loved these biscuits.  I subbed butter for the shortening, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I made them as a drop biscuit, using an ice cream scoop to drop them on the cookie sheet.  They were moist and tender, with great flavor- buttery, just barely sweet.  I wonder a couple of things:  if those who ended up with a dry biscuit rolled & cut their dough, which would add extra flour to the mix, and if the reviewer who complained of an overwhelming baking powder taste used 4 Tablespoons instead of teaspoons of baking powder, because these were great!  Great as a side with dinner, for breakfast with jam or honey or sausage gravy, and I wouldn't hesitate to use this as a shortcake for strawberries & whipped cream.  Thank you for a great biscuit recipe!  I have added this to my recipe box!

Instead of using white flour, I used 1/2 Brown rice flour, and 1/2 all purposes gluten free flour.  I also used 6 packets of equal (could have gotten away with only using 3).  It was a very easy recipe to follow.    When I pulled them out, they were extremely crumbly.  Probably connected to changing the recipe.

I made this but instead of using shortening I shredded a stick of frozen butter into the flour, mixed in the wet ingredients, until the mixture came together turned onto a floured surfaced kneaded a few times then used a biscuit cutter.   They turned out tender and soft.

This is now  my go to biscuit recipe. They are the best. Light, fluffy, yum. I sub butter for shortening, since I don't keep shorting on hand, so they are full of buttery deliciousness too.

Love the recipe. Don't add too much extra flour the dough seems wet but that is the perfect texture. I used butter vs shortening

Per other reviews I left out the cream of tartar, and used butter instead of shortening for the flavor. I made them as drop biscuits so as not to add more flour. I will be making these again, maybe with just a little less sugar.

These were really good!  I used butter instead of shortening (shortening was a huge trend back in my grandma's day, too).  
The texture of these biscuits was wonderful.
If you're using this recipe for biscuits or gravy, consider reducing the amount of sugar by half, or maybe leave it out all together.  I found the sweetness to be a little too much under a savory gravy.
The key to any biscuit, though, is not to overmix.  I don't even roll out the biscuits for fear of overworking the dough.
The bottom of the biscuit will brown faster than the top, so be sure not to wait too long for the golden color to appear on the tops.

I substituted the flour for a gluten-free flour and they were light and fluffy. Adding shredded cheddar cheese was a hit, along with mixed dried herbs to the wet ingredients. I would definitely make them again!

I love the flavor of this biscuit. It is one of the best tasting I've made. However, it is very dry. The texture is so crumbly, you can't cut it, and you can't butter it. I ended up dropping a teaspoon of butter and jelly on top and ate it like a piece of cake, with a fork. No way you're going to make a biscuit sandwich with these, which is too bad because they are delicious tasting! I suspect this is in the nature of the drop type biscuit as opposed to the rolled and cut.

I did not add the shortening, just ignored that...I try to avoid adding fat if I can. They are a bit dry, but I made them for a chicken and dumpling type meal, so it should be ok. Otherwise kept the recipe the same, only cooked for 8 min, longer and the bottoms would have burnt.

Melt in your mouth. I used these for a chicken and biscuit recipe.  I made them exactly as the recipe called. They turned out great. They taste a lot like the shortcake recipe on the Bisquick box. Everyone loved them.

I just made these, adding the extra flour (2 Tbs) in order to pat them out and cut. They are perfect! This is an easy recipe to follow, using ingredients that anyone would typically have on hand.

Excellent just as written! I made these biscuits into cheesy garlic onion biscuits with the addition of some grated medium cheddar, about a tsp of garlic powder, and a few chopped green onions. I also left out the cream of tartar as  I didnt have any on hand. Wonderful!

We just ate the last one. Kids loved it. They were pretty good, light and fluffy. They taste way better than any store bought. Hard part was for my son to wait for them to cook. Taste like true southern style biscuits.

I made this to use with leftover ham.  The biscuit was dry and did not have a lot of taste.  I gave it a 3 because I did make a couple of changes.  I used butter instead of shortening and 1/3 c milk & 1/3 c buttermilk.  I really do not think that would make a big difference.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

Just made this recipe, and it turned out pretty good! I ended up using heavy whipping cream (because that is what I had.. was out of milk) I also added some minced garlic and grated parmesean cheese.

I have failed at many a biscuit recipe over the years (bricks or nasty tasting) but this one is the ultimate winner! Biscuits come out with an unusual but wonderful taste, solid but fluffy consistency. Thanks so much for sharing it.
