I made this the other evening and the 'torte' was flat - only about a 1/2 inch.   It was alright the first cust, but then it became rubbery - ????

I just made this Torte for the second time in my life, and just like the first, it came out fantastic! Easy and relatively quick, this recipe turns out awesome every single time. Final product is a kind of a mix of fudge meets brownie meets cake. I will be making this again.

Four stars because it's easy, and it definitely tastes like chocolate and raspberry. The bake time and/or temperature seemed a bit too much, however, as my torte came out looking more like a glorified brownie both times I tried this recipe. I definitely needed the whipped topping to dress it up.
