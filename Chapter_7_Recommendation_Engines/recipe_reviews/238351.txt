I think the chicken breast are probably frozen in the original recipe. As an experienced slow cooker cook I know they would be over-done after 8-10 hours if they are thawed beforehand. 
Just use frozen chicken or decrease the time to 4-5 hours for pre-thawed chicken.

This was just the change in my chicken recipes that I was looking for! I used this as a base recipe for Asian chicken dinner.  I used 4 fresh chicken breast, 12oz of apricot preserves, 10oz of Russian dressing, 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, and splash of ginger.  I put it in the crock pot for 6 hours on low, stirring every 2 hours.  served with rice and Asian medley vegetables.  It was SO GOOD!  thank you for sharing your recipe.

My family loves this recipe, and you can't beat how you get so much flavor complexity from so few ingredients. There were crunchy pieces from the onion soup mix so I am going to sub fresh onions and seasoning next batch.

I must say this was the easiest crock pot recipe I have ever made!  I did not have apricot preserves, so I used peach, I didn't have Russian dressing, so I used French, and I always use boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  After reading the reviews, I also cooked for 3.5 hours and it came out perfect.  I served over egg noodles (yum!!)).  Both my husband and I enjoyed this.

First time I made this the family was choking on dry chicken, 8 hrs is way too long. Tried it again and used boneless thighs, cooked on low for 4hrs, much better.

My family loved this! It had a great flavor and it was perfect with rice. I will cook it for less time next time. It was ALMOST mushy.

I made this with recipe 2 times. My family loves it! It is versatile, we used cranberry sauce and Catalina dressing and it turned out great too!

I put this in the crockpot early this morning.  I was 3 tablespoons short of the apricot jam, so I just added a little seedless strawberry.  I didn't have Russian, so I used restaurant quality french (it tastes JUST like Russian).   Added the onion soup mix and let 'er go.  Of course, I used frozen chicken, and since I had only one breast, loaded the rest with thighs and wings. The smell is already heavenly, and if that's any indication, it's going to taste GREAT!  I'll serve it over rice tonight, and change my review to reflect the final taste test.  My mouth is watering for this already!

Good ingredients but 8 to 10 hours is to long.  6 or 7 hours.  I will try it again but shorter time

Great, easy recipe. For lower carbs I used no sugar marmalade and low calorie catalina dressing ... a bit different flavour but same simple concept. Also use it for pork tenderloin! Excellent.

I didn't expect this to be so darn good! Doubled it up to use whole bottles of dressing and jam. Only sub was chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Think I only cooked on low for 2-1/2 hours then on warm for another hour or so, good to go.

Will be adding this to the rotation! Thanks for making me try this, I would never had put these ingredients together without your recipe...

The good: The flavor is fantastic; my husband and picky 7 year old loved it and said to make it again. It was also easy to make.      The Bad: This was so dry!!! I cooked frozen breasts on low for 5 and 1/2 hours and the breasts were dry as a bone. In the future I will do 4 hours on low.

I'm not usually a can of this and a can of that cook, but we loved this, and proud to say it!  Had trouble locating Russian dressing locally.  Ordered Ken's from Amazon. Great dish!

I wasn't a fan of this meal in the slow cooker. The sauce really cooked down to an almost broth like consistency and the flavor soaked into the chicken which actually gave it an odd taste. I also agree with the other reviews that said the chicken turned out dry. Since some of my family did like this dish, I may give this recipe one more try in the oven instead of the slow cooker, in hopes that the sauce won't cook down into a broth or soak into the chicken.

I had to make my own dressing,  but it turned out okay. I would say more three and a half stars, because I am not sure if I like the flavor that much.

Made exactly as recipe states other than reducing the cooking time to 4 hours. The chicken was dry and only one person in my family of five liked it. My husband asked me not to make it again. ??

Easy peasy! Pretty good flavor. My only complaint is that I prefer a bone-in chicken to help keep it moist. Tried the recipe as is and it was a little dry for me.  Next time I will use bone-in.

As others have said, please cook this on low for about half the time, which I did.  If you cook longer the chicken gets hard & dried out.  The flavours are amazing!!  Will be making this again!!

Easy! I made homemade Russian dressing, since I couldn't find it in the store. The mayo clotted as it cooked, so the sauce ended up lumpy, but it was so tasty, we got over the visual. Might add a little more zing next time, but very good as is.

I used boneless skinless thighs and cooked on high for two hours and low for two years and the chicken was moist and tender and the sauce thickened a little. I added a Tbsp of soy sauce and 1/2 tsp of garlic chili paste.  Next time I'll skip the onion soup mix. It just added a really potent, salty, and artificial smell and flavor. Next time I'll use real onions. This was really tasty! I served over brown rice with a chipped Asian salad on the side.

I could not find Russian dressing so I used thousand island and two tablespoons of horseradish instead. I liked it.  It had great flavor but my husband (who is extremely picky) said he didn't really care for  the "sweet" taste.. The chicken was absolutely not dry but I will say that I used frozen chicken breasts and even on low, the chicken was done in just 5 hours. I served it over rice. I too think it had a bit of an Asian flair. It might be good with some Siracha added so it is kind of sweet and hot. I probably won't make it again this way but may try a variation or try to find actual Russian dressing.

I love this recipe! If you use thawed chicken, cut the time in half! It reminded me of a semi sweet barbecue flavor, yet still different. Will be making it often!
