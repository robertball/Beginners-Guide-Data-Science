After reading the othe reviews, I made the following changes and everyone loved this dish: 1. I marinated the fish in Italian dressing for about 1 hour, 2. I used no-stick cooking spray on the pan, 3. used 1/4 cup low fat/low sodium chicken broth in the sauce instead of oil, 3. decreased the butter to about 1/4T per filet.

This is delicious and so easy.  I used fresh herbs from my garden and eliminated the butter, to cut the fat. I drizzled olive oil on the fish prior to broiling.  Keep cooking time to a minimum, as overcooked tilapia turns leathery.

I must admit...I tweaked.  On others' recommendations, I marinated the fish for about an hour in Italian dressing.  I didn't add any oil to the pan because I figured the dressing would be enough.  I also pre-cooked the pepper and onions for a few minutes as we like ours really soft.  Too, I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes to the sauce mix.  Served over rice...delish.

I used a lot less oil than the recipe called for and instead of tomato paste, I used stewed tomatoes.  It made the dish taste lighter.  I also skipped the butter step and used about 1/2 a small onion.  The dish was delicious.

Loved this recipe. The fish cooked to perfection...I think I would omit cranking up the broiler next time...I dont think you needed that extra few minutes to brown the butter on top. The flavor was great...easy to make. I think I would also use some of my own homemade sauce next time instead of the paste...but the peppers and onions were very tasty with the sauce and fish...I've never had fish like this before. Will make again!

This recipe is awesome and so easy to make!  My boyfriend claimed it as a keeper after his first bite.  It's also a nice change to the usual fish recipes.  I would recommend cutting up the green peppers real small also.

I used white wine instead of the olive oil, half a cup of tomato puree instead of tomato paste, and celery instead of the green peppers.  It turned out fantastic!

Great recipe except I cut the oil by half and the butter out almost completely, and it's still really good.

This is a definite DO OVER!  I do think that the olive oil could be cut in half or at least to 2/3.  We paired it with sweet potato baked in the microwave and then cut into pieces and pan fried with olive oil. The sweet flavor paired well with the Tilapia and soaked up the juices.  We rounded out the healthy meal with sliced cucumbe with seasoned rice vinegar dressing-Excellent!!!

This receipe was absolutely perfect as is - VERY delicious!  Okay, I omitted the green pepper, only because I didn't have any.  But otherwise I followed this recipe to a T and found it perfect.

I read some of the other comments and suggestions. Thanks for those, because combine with them and this recipe I just ate the best Baked Tilapia ever!  I took the suggestion of marinating the fish in Italian Dressing and also used less olive oil because I agree I didn't need it. I didn't have a bell pepper so I just omitted it and I was a bit lazy and instead of cutting up the onion I used dry onion. (Hey at least I didn't have to cry). Lastly the broil part made me nervous and it wasn't necessary because the fish was ready for me to enjoy. So glad I found this web site.

I'm a new cook and tried this recipe. I found it both user friendly and yummy!  As with other reviewers I decreased the amount of oil and it still turned out moist. I also didn't have tomato paste so I used tomatoe sauce instead. I  just loved the sweet flavor of garlic, tomatoe and onion which are all my favs! Definetly going to the market this weekend to get more Tilapia!

Good! I did make a few changes. Used canola oil, added parsely and basil, real garlic, omitted butter and added a jalapeno. I did use frozen peppers and onion but if I was going to use fresh I would sautee the veggies. Im glad I tried this recipe and I will put this in my rotation.:)

the smell in my kitchen while cooking this dish was amazing!  I made minor changes, specially on the amount of oil, and it turned out great.  Im not a tilapia fan, but I loved it.

This was good!  Very easy and quick - after reading other reviews, I used approx 3 cloves of garlic and about 1/4 cup of olive oil ... definitely plenty for the fish and sauce.  Great flavor, too - next time I would dice up the onions and peppers because they didn't cook fully.  All in all, very elegant and tasty!

Really good. My husband thought it was delicious.  Used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste so that you could have more of a sauce to top on rice. Added extra of all the seasoning to the sauce. Also added lemon to the sauce.  Before adding sauce to uncooked fish, I seasoned the fish with all the listed spices before adding the sauce on top.  Really good and flavorful if you add extra of all the spices (with tomato sauce).  Try it!

Came out beauifully and delicious. Making it again tonight for my dad!

This simple yet tasty little recipe brought out the unique flavour of the fish very nicely.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a fish recipe involving tomato paste, oregano and the lot, but it was really quite good!

This was very tasty, though I substituted Campbells condensed Tomato soup for the tomato paste, because it was apart of yesterdays lunch and I thought what a great way to reuse it! I also added dried chopped onions on the fish before baking.  I also used light olive oil in place of the extra virgin olive oil.

My fiance and I LOVED this!  I'd use a little less olive oil next time and I added a bunch of spices to the sauce (basil, cumin, chili powder, pinch of sugar, etc.) and it had a ton of flavor.  The fish was cooked perfectly and it just flaked so easily after the 6 minute broil.  I can't wait to make this again!

Good & easy!!
I followed the others suggestions: season fish, cut oil to 1/3 cup, use cooking spray in bottom of dish.

I used a glass dish & so I couldn't broil... instead, for those last 5-8 min I turned the heat to 450 degrees... came out great!!

The flavor is nice but not overpowering.  I served with steamed zucchini & tomatoes and a baked potato.  Yum!

Fantastic!!!! I made this after reading all of the reviews and used the following suggestions: reduce the amount of olive oil for the topping to 1/4 of a cup, spray the baking dish with pam instead of using olive oil, SEASON your fish prior to cooking (I used season salt, garlic powder and black pepper) and then cook according to the recipe. I substituted margarine for the butter and added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese to the top prior to placing under the broil. YUMMY!

Oh my gosh, this was GOOD! This is the best way I have had this wonderful fish and I use this fish alot! I did reduce the amount of olive oil. Maybe used about 1/8 cup total. I also used less onions and pepper. Kids not fans of it so I told them to pick it off. They really liked this fish. I was worried it would dry out because this is a fast cooking fish, but it came out perfect! Will make this often and many thanks to you Tiny Poem!

I also did not use all the oil or the butter, and it was still delicious. I served it with packaged saffron rice and my husband and 2 year old loved it! Will definitely make this again.

We thought the tomato/pepper/onion was way too heavy and detracted from the delicate flavor and texture of the tilapia.  Might be better if you substituted chicken?

If this were any simpler I'd be pouring it from a stinking can!! It's both easy and delicious. DH loved it. My skeptical behind loved it and the rest is history. We used fresh garlic minced or grated (I get lazy) and serve over piping hot angel hair pasta. Serve with a lovely italian salad and steamed broccoli.

I tried to follow the recipe exactly with the exception of using 3 additional tilapia versus the 4 advised in the recipe. Still tasted great. i topped over homemade yellow rice and brocoli on the side. i used lots of onion and peppers on and around the fish, this ones a keeper.

delicious! this was so incredibly easy. i didn't pay much attention to the actual measurements, just loaded up on the veggies i like, and sprinkled it with salt, pepper, herbs, red pepper flakes and especially garlic; i chopped up tomatoes instead of tomato paste, and it's perfect.

This was delicious.  I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted tomato sauce. and found I didn't have oregano so used Italian Seasoning insteI'm sure I will be making this many more times in the future.  I do recommend cutting back on the oil though.   Also, I don't think the butter was as necessary because of the amount of oil.  But it is a keeper recipe.

Everyone in my house loved this recipie. It was so light yet flavorful. I substituted roasted mild hatch peppers for the bell pepper because they were on sale. Even my husband (who when asked what I was cooking, made it clear that he does not like tilapia) absolutely loved it. I bought more Tilapia already so I can make it again. Thanks Tiny.

I read the reviews before trying this recipe and decided to omit the olive oil altogether.  I am on the weight watchers program and was able to reduce the point value quite a bit.  I used a little fat free chicken broth instead of oil (didn't measure it) in the tomato paste mixture and just sprayed the pan with no stick spray.... The results were yummy!! My husband loved it.  OH-- the only other changed was I increased the salt to 1 tsp.  We will make again-- 2 thumbs up!

My husband and I didn't like this very much. We thought it didn't have enough flavor. There are much better receipes for white fish on here. It was ok to eat, but we will not have this again.

This was very good!!  We loved it. It was so easy. Like another reviewer suggested I used white wine instead of olive oil and only had stewed tomatoes. I only chopped a little onion since I dont like it.  This dish was soooo great. I will make this again and again.

Wonderful!  I agree with someone below - I have never had baked fish with tomato paste - but it is really good!  And it is a terrific recipe to tweak!  I added some other spices and it turned out great :)

I made this last night and it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but cut out the butter and broiling and used red bell pepper instead of the green.  I think that next time I will try it with a flakier fish and use much less olive oil.  I am going to spray the pan with the oil and just use a couple of tablespoons mixed with the tomato paste.  I will also use crushed fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  This is such a quick easy dish and can be used with just about any kind of fish or seafood.  thank you

Absolutely fantastic! I did omit the second cooking with the butter to save on calories. I cooked it in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes and all was good to go.

We eat a lot of fish in our family and I get tired of just grilling it, so I was excited for this recipe, but I just thought it was ok.  I made it as called but added a dash of hot pepper flakes. The tomato paste was too heavy and thick. I think a marinara sauce would be better.

The onions and peppers did not cook.  The sauce was overpowering and took away from the fish flavor.  If you don't like the taste of fish, the recipe is perfect....

Just OK; won't make again. Tried suggestion to use white wine instead of olive oil, threw it out it out and started over using written recipe. Has a lot of flavor, but is too oily.

I loved it! My husband thought it was pretty good too. My pickiest son loved it too once he took a bite! It was the two kiddos I usually don't have to worry about that didn't like it.
Oh well, I'll make it again sometime.

For me, this was just not a way to use good tilapia filets.  I followed the recipe closely, but the onion slices and peppers were scarcely cooked at 15', so I extended to 18'.  The slices still were almost raw.  Next time, I would saute them first. The tilapia was mostly lost under the tomato paste and onion/pepper cover, and might just as well not have been there, being a mild fish anyway.

I love this recipe though there was a lot of tweaking. We usually have a lot of what the recipe calls for but due to a busy schedules we had to comprise. Ketchup for tomato paste, frozen bell peppers & onions for fresh, no salt b/c it's in the ketchup no butter b/c of the amt of olive oil in the recipe and tilapia is a naturally oily fish. I will save this one quick and easy. Oh and red pepper just put the sauce over the top. YUMZ

Quick and easy way to cook tilapia.  My fish was even still a little frozen, and all it took was an extra 6 minutes in the oven to cook it completely.  Instead of tomato paste, I added a can of diced tomatoes and then poured the oil and herbs over the fish and tomatoes.  To top it off, I added a few lemon slices on top of the fish as well as a little bit of lemon juice.

I read the reviews before making it and changed a few things.  I seasoned the fish with garlic powder & seasoning salt on the skin side while the the other side was resting in the olive oil in the pan.  Then, I proceeded to season the other side the same way.  I flipped the skin side back up and added the mixture.  I gave it a different flavor by using garlic roasted tomato paste.  And the family LOVED it.  They are not big fish eaters but it was said that they would definately eat it again if I prepared it.

I like the simplicity of the recipe, but I think the flavor is very bland if you make it as instructed.  The next time, I will blend the garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried oregano and olive oil together. Rub the seasonings on the fish and then brush the tomato paste over the fish.

Truthfully, I didn't think I'd like this recipe when I saw it. The tomato paste wasn't sounding good at all. I needed a dinner idea fast and this fit the bill. I cut the amount of tomato paste  down to 1 1/2 tbs (too bitter with more)and added a 1/2 tsp of salt(The fish was too bland without it). It came out better than I expected. Will make again.

This was very good.  Reading other reviewers, I marinated the tilapia in Italian dressing for an hour, and instead of tomato paste, i used spaghetti sauce. I used all the other ingredients, but much less olive oil. My husband even asked how i made it, and he enjoyed it.

This one became a favorite in our home - we call it "Pizza Fish." I usually make it with the pre-packaged bags of frozen tilapia from the supermarket freezer section. Besides cutting down the oil and butter, this recipe is perfect!

I loved this dish. I didnt have a can of paste so I used about 3 sun dried tomatoes.  Also another note if your going to brown the dish in the broiler make sure you oil the green peppers a bit so they dont burn.  Good eating!

Excellent! I had to use stewed tomatoes as I had no tomato paste but it was still very good. And I omitted green peppers because they give me indigestion. It was still very flavorfull. I'll be making this again. Everyone but my 5 year old ate it.

This was really good and simple to make.  I used a little more tomato sauce to make it really rich and seasoned and a little less olive oil to make it healthier.  Even my kids ate it.  thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed making this dish.  I am a newbie in the kitchen and this was a very easy dish to prepare.  My husband loved it and said it was realy good.  The only drawback I had was I think it was too much bellpepper and onion for the dish, next time I'll start out with half of each.

I couldn't stand this tasteless fish, though the sauce & peppers were delicious.  My husband was oohing & ahhing, though.  He'll eat the leftovers.  Be sure to serve with a good sopping-up bread.  I doubled the recipe for 8 fillets, and it was SO soaked with oil (& then melted butter) that the broiling didn't really affect the fish as much as the sauce the oil & butter created.  Might be best served on rice, but still, the fish was flavorless.  Ugh.

I tried this receipe today with a few modifications.  I reduced the amount of olive oil a lot -- maybe by the half and I omitted the butter completely. Instead of the 4 spoons of tomato paste, I used 1 spoon only and added fresh cut tomatoes.  I also used 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic.  My 9 years old helped me do it and she thought it was pretty easy.  It's also very yummy :)

I'm giving this four stars because my kids gobbled it up, but I would say that the four stars are a bit generous otherwise.  As it's written, this recipe would have to be too greasy to eat -- I cut the oil both in the paste and in the pan, and I omitted the butter completely.  Also, tomato paste is such a strong flavor, so I mixed in some bottled minced garlic and a generous sprinkling of sugar, just to make it edible.  The final product reminded me of good, solid cafeteria food.  You'll notice that another reviewer said that her fish-hating husband liked it?  That's because you can hardly taste the fish at all.  But it was super fast, used ingredients I had on hand, and a hit with the kids, so I can't complain too much.  Just be advised that this is not a dish that would appeal to a refined palate.

Recipe was quick and tasted good.  However the olive oil and tomato paste didnt blend well.  I wasnt sure if I was doing it right or not.  If I make this again I will saute the onions and bell peppers a little first.

This turned out fantastic, but I made some slight variations. As someone else suggested, I marinated the fish in italian dressing for a couple of hours. I also reduced the amount of olive oil. In the tomato paste mixture, I used grated garlic instead of the powder, and poured in a couple of teaspoons of the extra italian dressing leftover from the marinade. Because oven types are different, my baking time was slightly longer and I broiled at Lo for about 12 minutes (did not use butter). I also garnished with rosemary right when I broiled the fish. This was my first time making this dish, and definitely not my last. Thanks!

I made this recipe with Birds Eye frozen stir fry mix which has onions and red and yellow peppers. The fish was deliciously moist and with great flavor. A big hit in this house.

This is a great recipe that you can alter to fit what you have in your kitchen. As a college student cooking primarily for myself, my stock of spices,etc, is small. For one filet I used a mixture of olive oil (1/2 tb), minced garlic (1 tsp), basil (to taste), and marinara since I didn't have tomato paste. I just sprayed the dish with cooking spray to keep it light. I added sliced mushrooms on top during the broiling process and it came out great!

Very good, and a beautiful presentation. I used a red onion. I actually use only two fish fillets and keep everything else the same. Love all the flavors on the fish! If you have a broiler that has a 'high' and a 'low' setting, use the low setting and make sure you have at least four inches between the fish and the flame, or it will burn. Great recipe.

I doubled the spices and omitted the butter. It was absolutely delicious and flavorful that way. In the future I would substantially cut down the amount of olive oil put in the baking dish -- it was unnecessary. Can't wait to make this again!

Better than I expected, I was skeptical about the tomato paste. But I did change it a little. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, omitted the butter, and added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning. I also didn't have garlic powder so I used 1 tsp. minced garlic and then topped with gorgonzola cheese I had left over. I didn't have green pepper on hand so used eggplant instead. Very tasty!

I think this recipe is not bad. There's nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either. I took the advice of others to reduce the amount of oil and butter. I sauted the onion and green pepper for two minutes before putting them on top of the tilapia. I don't think I'm gonna do it again.

I was shocked at how tasty this actually turned out. I was wary of the tomato and fish combo. I actually served it with pasta since I had so much sauce.

This is a great recipe if you don't have a lot of time to cook dinner, but want something light and healthy. I usually marinate the tilapia in white wine 30 minutes before just to give it some added flavor.

We loved this recipe.  As suggested in other reviews, I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup and sprayed the baking dish w/Pam.  Also increased oregano to 1 tsp. and reduced butter to 2T.  Excellent dish!

I loved this recipe. the flavors go great together and tilapia doesnt taste fishy or salty at all! however, i used half the olive oil the recipe calls for, and it was still too oily. Next time i'll use even less.

I served this recipe, and it turned out all the flavor was in the sauce.  The fish did turn out very moist and tender, but it was quite bland.  It's the nature of the fish, I guess, but next time I'll try marinating the fish before I cook it.

I agree with the others that there is more oil in this recipe than necessary. Each time I make it, I cut back on the oil, and each time it makes no difference. The flavor is great! My family loves it on spagetti!

I tried this recipe before i read the reviews and wish i hadn't. It was definitly too oily, and i wasn't so fond of the paste. I used fresh garlic instead of the powder and about only a half of a medium onion and green pepper. I don't think i will make this again, but to those who do, don't use the called amount for the oil.

Made changes to the recipe. Sautéed garlic, Worcestershire sauce and scallions in olive oil before making the tilapia on a skillet. Used 1 cup of tomato juice instead of the paste as well.  Great recipe.

I doubled the recipe - WAY too much oil. Took over twice the recommended time to cook, but cooked perfectly. Less oil would save money and might allow the flavor of the paste/herb mix to be more vivid.

Baked this several times. I use frozen tilapias. For 5 pieces half recipe  of the olive oil sauce can be used and there would still be a lot of sauce after baking. Very delicious.

I didn't like this recipe at all. It entirely masked the taste of the fish. Way too heavy!

If I had the time the only change I would make is to let the fish marinate a bit before baking.

I love making this. My husband's favorite fish is tilapia so this gives me another way  to cook it. I marinated it in Italian dressing like someone else suggested and it was perfect. Only downside is that it does use alot of oil.

I did everything the same except using garlic salt powder, and sauteing the onions and bell pepper with minced garlic. I also did not broil or add butter at the end. I served over rice with steamed squash and it was a great dinner! I may try marinating the fish next time or using diced tomatoes instead of paste like others have commented on. I will definably make this again. The taste of bell pepper, onion, fish, and the sauce all together was wonderful. Just tweak it to your taste! :)

I made this tonight.  Really yummy!  I cut back on the olive oil and didn't add the butter as we are watching our weight and it was really light and flavorful.  I baked it for 15 minutes in a 350 oven and it came out perfectly (no broiler).  I used vidalia onions so they were nice and sweet.   I would make this again.  Delightful!

Amazing...I really don't eat too much fish and this time that I decided to make it using this recipe was very delicious. I exchanged the green pepper for carrots and used white onions as well, also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil since the flavor is a little strong. Everything else the same (if you want you could either skip the butter or add less, depending on your taste). Great!

The fish was cooked nicely...and came out nice and moist.  However, to my husband and I, it tasted like fish with sauce on it.  The flavours did not seem to meld together to compliment one another.  My daughter, on the other hand liked it.  I will say though, that I took the advise from some of the other reviews and used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.  Maybe that's what made the difference.

I recently needed to change my diet for health reasons and this was a GREAT meal to START!  The only change I made to the recipe was to place the Tilapia on a bed of spinach.   (I should have used more spinach).

I would definitely make this again.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it and it was simple to throw together.  Like most everyone else, I tweaked this recipe a bit.  To make it lighter I used only a quarter cup of olive oil in the sauce and used just a little bit to grease the baking pan rather than using the full amount called for in the recipe.  I also used only a dab of butter on each filet instead of a whole tablespoon.  Worked great!

I followed the recipe exactly, and found the result had too many onions and green peppers, not enough sauce, and was not cooked in a way that blended the flavors well enough. 

I read the reviews after I was done, and I see that others have some good ideas about how to improve this recipe. 

However, there are so many other good things to do with tilapia that I won't be making this again.

I've made this so many times, I finally had to put a rating on it.  This is one of our favorites in this household. We eat a lot of fish, so this site is very helpful when you want to be a bit more creative. The only change I made to this recipe was less Olive Oil - other than that this is a wonderful dish!! Thanks for sharing it!

This was AMAZING, and so quick and easy! I do not usually like "fishy" fish (the key, though, is using fresh fish!) and this wasn't fishy at all.  My husband and 3-year old also loved it.  It's fine without the butter if you want to cut it out, but we like the buttery richness.  What a wonderful recipe - it's now a staple for busy weeknights!

This dish was okay.  It was my first time making tilapia.  The fish is meaty and delicious.  I followed other's suggestions and marinated in italian dressing.  But I really didn't care for the the combination of tomatoes and green peppers with the fish.  My husband pushed all the other ingredients aside and just ate the fish.  Won't be making this dish again.

I think the tomato paste is bitter. Should have used tomate sauce instead. And should have followed others' advice about marinating it first.

I really liked this, and so did my son (he is 2)  My husband on the other hand hated it.  I decided to do the recipe as it was written, and I have to say that I agree with the other posters that it was way too much oil.  I also would season the fish with some garlic powder, salt and pepper before putting in the pan.  I think that I will make this again trying some of the other suggestions.

This is a really great fish course. We have it at least once a month. The freshness of the flavors work even for my picky eater. Also works well with catfish, although the taste is a little different.

The topping sauce, onions, and peppers tasted good, but the fish had no flavor whatsoever.  I strongly suggest seasoning the fish before hand maybe with the same spices used for the sauce.

As others noted, all the flavor was in the sauce. I suggest that you add a bit of seasoning to the fish itself also. But overall it was good and I will make again with seasoning on the fish.

Excellent!  Used a frozen blend of peppers and onions over the fish.  Only used about 1/3-1/2 cup of olive oil and consistency was perfect.  Served with seashell pasta with a light coating of garlic cream sauce.  Fish is still good next day, but best flavor was right out of the oven.

Was very easy to prepare and tastes so yummy.  Also decreased the oil amount.  Will make again.  Husband loved it too & he says he doesn't like fish. Ha.

This recipe turned out much better than expected.  I wish I had read the recommendations first, as I felt there was way too much oil in it.  I'll also increase the amount of salt in the recipe.  Overall, taste was excellent, the fish was moist and flaky, and it's an excellent dish as far as presentation goes.

I didn't think tomato paste would be good on fish, but it was really tasty.  My boyfriend really liked it as well.  I followed some of the suggestions given, like to use less oil and I bought a paste that had basil and oregano already in it.  Will make again.

This was good, but I used a half bag of frozen colored bell peppers to add color and just thawed before putting in oven, also used tomato sauce instead of paste. Will make again.

Blah!Way too much oil and I used only half of what it suggested! Also the tomotoe paste was kindof gloppy after it was mixed with the oil and garlic. After it was cooked there was pools of oil in the side of the pan the fish was swimming in oil(no pun intented!) and I even ommited the butter stage. The fish turned out nice and flaky though, but would have been better if it was baked in a marinara sauce. I gave it 2 two stars because the fish was flaky and the sauce was edible(sortof)
