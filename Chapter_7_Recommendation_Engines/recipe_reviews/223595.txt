KEEPER!!!! Excellent recipe. I made 12 larger bread sticks and all I could add to this wonderful recipe is I could add some Parmesan to the topping. Save this recipe - it is great.

I made this recipe as written and they turned out bland. I could not taste the garlic. I will make this again and will add garlic to the dough as well in the butter. This recipe does make a lot of bread sticks. I have to agree with others, adding some parmesan cheese would help too.

Wonderful texture. I did make a change though. I added 1 tablespoon more sugar and added about 3 or 4 cloves of garlic (chopped super fine) to the dough. I've finally found my perfect breadstick recipe.

My family loves these.  I mince some fresh garlic and add it to the dough, we love garlic.  When I make too many I just freeze them for later

For some reason I don't think my dough raised, or at least not much.  They were extremely dense after baking.  Too bad.  Won't attempt to make again.

These are okay.  Not a lot of flavor but they were fun to make.  I think I'll add more salt next time and put garlic powder in the dough.

Definitely a keeper! Although I added garlic powder on the dough itself and 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning for the topping  for more flavor (which my hubby likes) but you can make this recipe as it is.  Loved it. Will be making it again. Thank you Kimbers for sharing this  recipe.

I usually don't like it when people change the recipe from what's written then review it, but I'm doing just that here. The suggestions sounded like great improvements so I ran with it. 
I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used about 1.5 TBS garlic salt instead of regular salt in the dough recipe and I topped them with parmesan cheese. They still could've had more garlic/salt flavor but they were good.  Overall 4 stars with the changes.

VERY easy to make.  I put garlic salt instead of salt in the dough (liberally, at that) and when they were done I brushed with butter and more garlic salt then topped with parmesan cheese.  The whole house approves wholeheartedly and, well, they didn't last long.  Also, I ran out of space so I made the last 3 into knots and they cooked just perfectly.

This recipe is a winner; definitely a keeper. It's sooooo easy to make (I made mine in the kitchenaid mixer which the dough hook). Fluffy, delicious breadsticks. :-) No tweaking necessary.

I'll give this recipe 3 stars, but I did alter it some but mostly because of the texture of the finished product.  It was very light and fluffy bread and while it was very tasty bread, breadsticks should have a more dense texture.  I scaled the recipe down to fit into my bread machine so I used 3 1/2 cups of flour.  The dough has a nice texture when it comes out of the bread machine.  When I scaled down the recipe I did round the numbers a bit to accomidate.  But to the dough, I also added 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of minced garlic and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the dough.   Then for the butter topping I increased the garlic to 1+ teaspoon of garlic powder.  I didn't measure, but just palmed the garlic powder.  I think next time I would use 4 tablespoons of butter for the topping because 3 was barely enough to cover the breadsticks a second time after baking.  After spreading the garlic butter on top I sprinkled a bit more Parmesan cheese on top.  I palmed the Parmesan and sprinkled it on by hand so it's just a light touch of it added.  Then baked them.   After baking I used the remaining garlic butter on top and sprinkled the tops with a bit of kosher salt while wet so it sticks well.   We like a lot of garlic in our house so the garlic amount was just perfect for my family.  I think you want them to raise a bit but not as much as you would a bread and an hour was to long.  I also used a heating pad for about 15-20 min.  I made 15 breadsticks with my scaled down recipe.

YUM...LOVED THESE! I'll admit, my skills are definitely lacking in the breadstick 'shaping' department (you should've seen some of them, lol), but these were so good that we didn't care, and now I have an excuse to keep on making these...'I'm practicing', lol! I loved how quick this dough came together, and the baked texture is wonderful. I did not use the optional salt at the end, but agree w/ BN that these would also be wonderful sprinkled w/ some parm., which I'll try next time. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I personally never cared for Olive Garden's bread sticks, but the kids like them. I made this recipe to please them but with few changes to make it have little bit of nutrition. For that I used half all purpose and half whole wheat flour. Also added 1 tablespoon powdered milk ( makes bread softer) and about  half teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning for more flavor. Because of the use of whole wheat flour, I let the dough rise twice. Once before shaping into sticks and once after. That  also helps getting a fluffy bread. The last change was cutting the salt down to 2 teaspoons and that was plenty. With these changes we had some very tasty bread sticks that the entire family enjoyed with some soup for dinner tonight.
FYI, try making the sticks pretty thin as they double in size after rising !

I made these to go with Pasta Faggioli several days ago. I like to follow recipes to the letter the first time out. But,  I didn't realize, until too late, that I was short on butter. So, I used olive oil in the dough and saved what butter I had for the topping. The breadsticks were delicious! My husband is already begging for me to make more. This time I will make the dough with butter (as in the recipe). But the olive oil did not impair the flavor.

I've made this recipe twice now. It was so fantastic the first time I had to make a second batch to see if it was a fluke. It wasn't. Excellent, easy to follow recipe that makes a very delicious bread roll. The last batch I made 8 small rolls and 4 large rolls instead of 16 small ones. First time I made 16. Either way the recipe works beautifully. First time with garlic butter, second time with parmesan butter. Whatever you put on them, they taste like a great bread roll. Very happy to have this in my cooking repertoire.

i followed the directions as normal, but when the dough was mixed, it was still sticky to the touch. Instead of adding more flour to the mix while kneading, I incorporated Panko until the dough was ready to be divided. This made the breadsticks so delicious....I highly suggest the addition.

Makes a lot of breadsticks. They were good. I added garlic powder to the dough, and still could use more. But we LOVE garlic in this house.

Excellent and easy! They look exactly like the picture! I wasn't sure that they were done because they were still light, but I'm glad I pulled them out 'cause they were perfect. I added garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning to the dough for extra flavor. I will definitely make these again.

Great recepie. I changed up the butter toppings with more flavor. The bread came out perfect. Just make sure you don't over cook them.

Good basic recipe for breadsticks that you can make your own with adding in your own ingredients. Bland otherwise, but good foundation to start with.

I really like this recipe. I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, substituted one cup of the called for white flour with whole wheat flour and sprinkled parm on once cooked, AWESOME. Love it, Thanks.

These were pretty good. I put a little garlic powder in the dough as well. My kids loved them. They are best the day you bake them, and not as good once they've cooled. So in the future I would probably not make the full recipe.

My teenage son loves breadsticks and he thought these were delicious. A little heavier texture than some, but very tasty. I also enjoyed how simple these were so he was able to learn how to make his own breadsticks. We added garlic powder to the dough for stronger flavor. All 16 disappeared in 2 days in my home of 3.

This recipe is exactly as described, delicious soft Olive garden-like bread sticks. I used oil instead of butter in the dough because I didn't have enough for the dough and the topper, and it made no difference. Be warned that it really does make 16 breadsticks though so cut the recipe in half unless you want to feed 8 people!

It was real bland. Great texture, looked and smelled great coming out of the oven. I let them rise on a warm surface for about 45 minutes. Everyone was too hungry to wait on the bread. I will make these again but next time I will season them up a bit more.

These were great! Melt in your mouth good claimed my husband; which is a high complement :) Not bland like others I have tried. I liked that they weren't too dense. I didn't have kosher salt so I used my sea salt grinder which was wonderful! Loved eating them along with my Italian vegetable soup recipe! Mmmm!

I had waned to make cheese sticks for lunches, so I used this recipe as a base. I flattened the dough, put a strip of grated cheese down the middle, then closed the dough around, before letting it rise for the hour. Then brushed with butter and baked. Turned out excellent!

My family knows I have a fear of yeast.  So whenever I attempt a recipe using it, they cheer loudly when the recipe works.  This recipe worked!  In fact, I have now made this recipe 3 times and it was successful each time, although my shaping skills still need some work.  I made the recipe as written; I also added garlic powder to the dough and sprinkled Parmesan cheese to the top.  My family wasn't picky about the method, they ate all of them any way I tried it.  If you are a beginner to yeast, this is a very forgiving recipe to try on, and a bonus is you only stir and kneed for 3 minutes.  Thanks Kimbers for sharing a recipe that I can now confidently make.

I have to agree that the dough needs some garlic in it as well. I used 3x time butter and garlic on top just to make them taste like garlic bread sticks. Otherwise, I think they turned out alright. I have a mix of 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour... so these came out a bit more dense, and I'm sure that it has something to do with the. also. If you can let them rise for longer than an hour, I believe they'd turn out better. I was in a time crunch so I couldn't test this theory.

These are pretty good.  The real test will be when DH tries them.  I let the dough mix and rise in the bread maker, which was handy, then shaped the breadsticks on my silpat covered cookie sheets.  I gave them another 30 minutes of rise time, then baked.  I made 22 smaller breadsticks, but they were still a nice size and had a great doughy texture (adjusted cook time accordingly).  This recipe is definitely worth a try.  Putting fresh grated parmesan or romano cheese on top makes these taste divine!
