These turned out absolutely perfect. I made this with my two boys this morning so we could bring a random act of kindness to their babysitter. We only made one change and that was upping the vanilla to a full teaspoon. I didn't really measure the chips out, I just used the random amounts I had in each bag that I had leftover from other cookies. I made no other changes. These turned out wonderfully. We baked the cookies at 350 degrees and they were done in exactly ten minutes. The boys really liked the different chips in this cookie and it was great for me because I could use up the little bits I had in my cupboard in each chip bag PLUS it made the perfect amount--neither too much or too little. This recipe's a keeper.

I am not bashful about calling it as I see it, assigning a low star rating to a recipe if I feel it warrants it.  I know Chef John has quite an avid following but frankly, I don’t get it.  I’ve tried a few of his recipes (which are fairly basic and generic in most instances anyway) and have been less than impressed every time, particularly since he is a “professional” and not a home cook.  In this case, I found these cookies, simply put, greasy and unattractive.  Further, they are only a very slight variation of the Toll House Cookie, the only difference being that he slightly increases the ratio of white sugar to brown sugar, a very negligible difference in the overall outcome. I took a bite out of fairness for the purpose of this review but did not continue – then again, if you like the greasy and sort of flattish Nestle Toll House cookie, you’ll like this one too as it’s essentially the same recipe.   Hubs was a little more favorable than I, saying they were edible, but “not like your grandma makes.”  Note:  also, for the purpose of submitting the best possible photo of these cookies, I selected a few of the better looking ones. Most did not look as good as the picture.

This was such a good cookie recipe! Loved that it uses different flavor chips. the cookie part was very good too, not too sweet. I doubled the recipe and everyone was fighting over the cookies. they couldn't come out of the oven fast enough. my cookies didn't spread that much  they kind of stayed in drop form, after the first pan came out and I realized that, it was an easy fix by flattening the cookie slightly with a cup before putting in the oven. this will be my new go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought these turned out as good as you could hope for.  The choco-chip to batter ratio was just fine if you ask me.

Let me start with....I'm a very novice baker!! And this was a great recipe for me! I even made a few modifications & they turned out great! I realized half way through making them that I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted maple syrup 1:1 (& not even the "real" stuff!) and I couldn't tell the difference. I also split the recipe in half after I made it so I could some some cocoa powder to one batch & mint extract to the other. Both versions turned out really good although I could have used a little more cocoa in my chocolatey chocolate cookies! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This is a good recipe to use up leftover chips.  I think that the recipe needs more than one cup total chips, though.  I added dried cranberries and still thought that the chip to dough ratio was a bit sparse.

I followed the recipe but for some reason my cookies spread out and were paper thin. I had half in the refrig and even then they turned out flat. If they were not flat they would taste good.

For this scrumptious cookie I used a 1/2 cup each of:  special dark chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips.  If they last the day, I’ll be surprised. You’ll not be disappointed making this recipe.

Excellent! I used about two and a half (3.5oz) chocolate bars chopped, ranging from bittersweet to 70% chocolate.   I made 17 cookies which took about 15 min to bake to golden perfection at the recommended 375 deg F.    Cookies were delicious, crispy golden around the edges, slightly soft and chewy on the inside.

Thank you, once again, Chef John!  These cookies were incredible.  My hubby decided he wanted to make chocolate chip cookies and he chose this one because of the triple chocolate factor.  Because he wanted more than 16 cookies, he doubled the recipe and ended up with 72 cookies!!  Poor baby was so tired afterward!  But we won't have to  make cookies for a while.  When we make cookies again, this will be the recipe, but we won't double it!   Thanks, Maestro!  Again, your recipes Rock!

This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes ever! It was so simple, and soo good!
followed it to the point, just 1 change increased the vanilla from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp and didn't have the white chocolate chips- so just used semi sweet and milk chocolate chips and they were delicious!! 
Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe---its definately a keeper! :-)

I was looking for a cookie recipe that I could use up my chocolate chips with.  This one was perfect!  I used dark chocolate chips instead of the milk chocolate chips because that's what I had.  I got 24 good sized cookies.  They came out great! Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful and easy! I love having the three different types of chips. I read a lot of the reviews and I don't know why a few people weren't happy with this recipe. They must just not be very good cooks! Whenever Chef John does something, it always turns out great! So, as he says, ENJOY!

These cookies are amazing! I only use semi-sweet chips instead of the blend, but that's the only change I make to this recipe. Ive made these a few times now and people always RAVE over them.

Super easy AND delicious too!  I do not like baking at all. But, I had to make cookies for my daughter's youth group function, somehow chanced on the video!  I watched it and figured that it did not look hard at all, and sure enough even I enjoyed the experience.  I didn't use white chocolate since I figured none of my kids like it.  I used an overflowing 1/2 cup of semi-sweet and overflowing 1/2 cup milk chocolate. My kids loved, loved, loved these!  I'm so proud of myself for baking cookies from scratch, but could not do it right without the video! Thank you so, so, so much for the video...it was a huge help!

Delicious!  I was a little worried the mixed chips would not be a hit in my traditional chocolate chip loving family.  However, I am happy to say that this recipe will be the first I reach for when cookies are on the menu.  I too doubled the vanilla in the recipe, perfect.

Followed the recipe exactly, although I did use white chocolate, semi chocolate and chocolate swirl chips.  Sorry Chef John, but I think the taste of these are just 4 star.  Certainly not the best tasting chocolate cookie out there.

Delicious! Was looking for an easy recipe to make a batch of cookies.  Well, I found a great one! Moist, baked just right. No problems and no complaints out of the family.  I will make these again!

I have made these twice already. :) They are awesome. I tried to make them really chocolatey but they didn't come out right. There are a lot of chips to experiment with for this cookie...

I didn't really realize how few cookies it made until I started. One cookie sheet using a cookie scoop. I went with milk chocolate, semi minis and white using the recommended 1/3 cup. Less salt since my butter was salted. It took 15ish minutes and they spread very nicely. They turned out a bit browner than I like so I will go with 13-14 min in my oven. My daughter wants 4.5 stars -even tho they have the dreaded semi-sweet chips.

My son chose this recipe for a class cookie exchange. I had never made this recipe before, but made it as written. We did not care for this cookie. The batter thins out in the oven and spreads pretty quickly, so I would recommend dropping them by the 1/2 tsp fulls. I dropped by 1 tsp fulls first batch and baked for 10 minutes and the cookie was thin and crispy and over baked imo, so the second batch I limited to 8 minutes and they were  still really brown. If you like thin, crispy cookies to dip in milk then you will like this cookie. Very thin and crispy for sure.  They did have a nice buttery flavor. Not sure how chewy they will be in the morning, might be even MORE crunchy. I am going to place a brown sugar bear in his container to hopefully maintain some moisture. I would recommend decreasing the temperature to 350 and see if that helps?

I have to make these almost weekly because of how good they are.  My brothers fight over who gets the most and ask me to make them for their birthday presents. The only thing that I have changed is adding an extra bit of almond extract, though that is from personal preference and is not needed. Follow the recipe and you should have the best chocolate chip cookies you will ever taste.

I really liked the cookies. The cookie is fun, because you do not need a mixer and it is simple. Also you can mix different ingredients. For example I added oatmeal instead of 3 kinds of chocolate chips, I just added one kind.

Great recipe, but I changed some things. First, 375 degrees was too much, so I changed it to 350 for better results. I also melted the butter a little bit in the microwave, and the cookies turned out fine. Another thing I did with the cookies was that I split the dough in half and added about 1/8 of a cup of unsweetened  cocoa powder and 1/8 cup of white sugar to make chocolate cookies. Whatever you do with these cookies, don’t bake them with a greased up baking sheet(I just use wax paper)

I tried this recipe for the first time for a bake sale. I made 4 batches and they were the first to sell out. One woman bought a bag and then came back and bought out the rest of what was put out. Fortunately I had another batch left for others to enjoy. I may have to make these once a week so I can enjoy them myself... they remind me of the old Keebler Rich 'n Chips that I loved years ago. Thanks, Amena.

Good base recipe. I made a few adjustments to my batch. 
(I doubled the recipe)
I reduced the butter by a few tablespoons. I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, and 1 cup each of white chocolate and milk chocolate. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 of white sugar for a double recipe. 
I whipped my eggs, butter, sugar and vanilla together for about 5 minutes to get it extra fluffy. 
I also chilled the cookie dough in the fridge for about 15 minutes before balling onto pan.

I tried this recipe and I think it is good.  Still searching for the ultimate.  I will be using this one until then.  I don't like white chocolate so I put in 2/3 c milk choc chips and 2/3 cup semi sweet chips.   I think it was just a few too many chips.  otherwise, not bad.

This is my go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. I make it often for my loved ones, students, and my coworkers. Needless to say, the teachers' lounge at my school is a much brighter place when I bring in these delicious cookies!  Thanks, Chef John!

I love it I have to do the double. I baked them the first time when my husband was deployed in 2012 . I am German and I thought there must be an easy recipe for "American Cookie's" and I came a cross this one . I love it thank you so much for sharing. The Boys in is camp love the cookies too. They ask him every time. Did your wife send some cookies again.

I tried a few chocolate chip cookie recipes, but stopped looking after this one. Everyone loves them, and after baking them for people, I'm bombarded with requests. This is a keeper. Try mixing in other add-in like butterscotch chips, M&Ms, pecans, walnuts, etc.

My 17 year old gobbles these up as fast as I can make them. They're delicious as-is, but I sometimes substitute oats for half the flour (I always use whole wheat) and often times add a big scoop (4 TB or so)of creamy peanut butter, just to change it up a little. Once when we were out of butter I used applesauce instead, and he didn't even notice the difference; I think the peanut butter masks the applesauce flavor. As you can see it's a great recipe as written but also versatile!

I love the flavor and it is easy to mix.  When I put the cookies on parchment paper, after 7 minutes they were completely burned and unable to be eaten.  When I made the next batch I put them on ungreased baking sheets. This was a success.

My new go-to recipe! These cookies consistently get rave reviews and I love that they are fairly simple and don't require a ton of dishes to clean up.  Thanks, Amena!

So easy and fantastic recipe. It was a little sweet and buttery to me first time, so I omitted 1/4 cup brown sugar and instead of using white sugar I used 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also I cut the butter to half for the 2nd time and it was wonderful. I am going to make it again this morning. :)

I only give 5 stars when a recipe REALLY deserves it and this one does! I only had salted butter but if you add less salt then its totally fine. these are SOOOOOO good. There are thousands of recipes out there but if you want one thats quick, doesnt require a mixer, and taste amazing...this is it!!!!

I always add a package of dry instant vanilla pudding mix to my cookies. I would rate 5 stars but I did make this one change which made this cookie a 10 star! LOVED IT! I will definitely make these again...but maybe not very often because we ate them all...I'll definitely need another workout this week:)

These cookies are the way cookies should be.

I think it needed a bit more flour and I chilled the dough. Cookies were very flat, not looking like the picture. That seemed to help.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies, but I've made them about 10 times now and they never cook in 10 minutes like the recipe says. I usually leave them in 15 minutes.

I use this as my general chocolate chip cookie recipe, usually using 1-1/2 cups of chips (and usually using only semi-sweet and milk chocolate) instead of the 1 cup in the recipe or the 2 cups also suggested. It's a simple, seemingly foolproof recipe that tastes fantastic.

This recipe was very good and very interchangeable. I made the first batch according to the directions and although they great they were too  flat for my liking. The next batch I played with the ingredients a little to make them thicker and it still yielded a flat cookie.  Outside of that this is a good recipe.

This is the best CC cookie recipe! As long as you do not cook them to long. 8 min. tops! At least for my oven.
