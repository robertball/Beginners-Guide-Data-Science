Wanting to find a chili recipe using chicken I stumbled onto this while browsing the chili section. It was very easy and exceptionally good. I liked that it wasn't very spicy and even better when reheated the next day!

This recipe was overpowered by the chili seasoning creating a "store bought" flavor.  Suggest using only half packet or creating one using spices separately. Also, two cans of whole tomatoes was unappetizing.  Perhaps one can of whole and one can of crushed would help.  I have a family that eats just about everything.  They asked that I not repeat this one. Won't be making this again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  It was a great way to use up the rest of the meat from a baked chicken I had made the day before.  It turned out to be really good.  I skipped the kidney beans and put in black beans instead.  I made cornbread to go with it, and it was a perfect meal.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband really enjoyed this chili.  I took the advice of others here, and made some changes.  I used only 1/2 TBS of italian seasoning, 2 cans of Ro-Tel instead of the tomatoes and chilis, black beans instead of kidney, and next time I will use 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup of water or chicken broth, as it was a bit dry.  I also did not pre-cook the chicken, but cooked all the ingredients in the crock pot for about six hours, rather than the recommended three.  Nice for a cold day!

Overall this was a satisfying and very healthy meal!  It really couldn't have been any easier to prepare.  The only changes I made were: I used chicken stock instead of water since I had some to use up, I added a little red wine, added one minced habanero pepper w/out the seeds, and after it was done cooking I was a little dissapointed since it looked more like a soup with chunks of chicken in it so I shredded the chicken and it looked more like a traditional chili.  The chicken was so soft it literally just fell apart when I smooshed it with the spoon I was using to stir it.  It is a very hearty and healthy meal!!  I served it with sour cream, cheese, and biscuits.

This was a nice alternative to beef chili.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.  Definately worth a try!

I put this together last-minute for a football watch party.  It was FANTASTIC!  I only had 2 cans of black beans, so I used that instead of the kidney and chili beans.  I also used 2 cans of Ro-Tel in place of the canned tomatoes and canned chiles.  Finally, just due to personal preference, I only used about a tablespoon of diced onion.  This was delicious and was even better the next day as leftovers!

The italian seasoning overwhelmed this recipe, but otherwise it was good.  I think there also was a little too much chicken in it.  It ended up okay, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was ok- I ate it and it was filling, but it could use more of something.  We ate it with light sour cream, some sharp cheddar and tortilla chips.

This was OK, I made the recipe as is and agree that it was a little bland, however, I just added quite a bit (I don't measure) of chicken seasoning and it helped it out a little. I will make it again, but I will add differnt seasonings.

Two stars because I'm a chili fanatic and this was just REALLY bland. My kids thought I was giving them pasta sauce with chicken because of it's consistancy.  It was quick and easy and a great way to use leftover chicken, but we won't be using it as a chili again...maybe as a pasta sauce, though!

It was pretty good but the whole family agreed we prefer beef chili.  I just thought I would try something different.  Also I was a little confused on the 16oz. can of "chili beans".   I thought chili beans were kidney beans. I just added double the kidney beans.  Michele, Cambridge Ontario

This was good and it was simple to put together. I made it in my slow cooker.  This chili freezes well---we had two meals from this recipe.  Will make again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I got it started too late to put in the crock pot so I cooked it on the stove in a big pot.  There were a few changes I made.  I added about 1/2 T of chili powder because the Italian seasonings overpowered the taste and I omitted the water.  I also didn't rinse the chili beans and next time I may add 2 cans chili beans and omit the kidney beans.  It took about 2 hours on the stove to thicken up.  The chicken started to shredd and was very tender so I may shredd it more next time.  I added sour cream and shredded Mexican blend cheese when I served it.  My husband liked it and I will probably make it again

This chili is excellent.  I made one slight change to this recipe in that I shredded the chicken after it was cooked.  But otherwise, you can't beat it.

So good and filling! I baked my chicken then shredded it before adding to the crock pot. I also used Italian flavored perfect portion chicken breasts, instead of the Italian seasoning. I cut the recipe in half and omitted the kidney beans and diced green chiles. Served with a dollop of sour cream and corn bread. So yummy!
