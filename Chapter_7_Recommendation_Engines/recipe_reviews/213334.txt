Well, this definitely is a "classic" and I guess that's why it's one of my all time favorites ever since I was a kid.  Nothing beats a hot bowl of soup coupled with a buttery toasted sandwich oozing with cheese. Whether it's for lunch or for dinner this is one meal that warms you up inside when it's cold outside. Thanks Campbell's!

This is a feel good classic. I use milk instead of water and add a drop of sour cream on top with a snip of fresh parsley. Mmmmm

Grilled chesse and tomato soup is my favorite. What would make this even better is using milk instead of the water. It will give it someting exra and make it nice and creamy.

Make the soup with milk (or lactaid ;-) instead of water for a creamier more decadent consistency. I used real mild cheddar cheese (processed cheese is not good for people with milk allergies)

A classic...warm comfort food, we use milk instead of water for a creamier tomato soup. Always family approved.

This is a classic quick meal. It also happens to be one of my favorites. Any cheese will work for this and I dress up my soup by adding some basil and freshly ground black pepper on top at the table. For an Italian flavor add some oregano to the soup and use parmesan and mozarella for the cheese. For Mexican use comino in soup and some pepperjack cheese for sandwich. Easy to make little add ins to suit your tastes and make it truly your own.

I LOVE tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches because not only is it food that can stick to your ribs, but it's comfort food that can warm you up. Instead of using water, I used milk to give the soup a rich and creamy taste and sprinkled with some grated Parmesan cheese on top (I LOVE cheese!!). It's a great recipe that's simple and scrumptious!!!!!!
