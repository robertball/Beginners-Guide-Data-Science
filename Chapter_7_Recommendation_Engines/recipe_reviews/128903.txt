This was very good. The combination of flavors was excellent. I added some chopped onion and celery also. If you like your stuffing to really stick together than you need to double the butter sauce and bake it in a smaller baking dish. I personally like my stuffing broken apart, it gives it a lighter flavor. Thanks for posting!!

I made this as written to go with cornish game hens for a weeknight supper - it was sweet, but really tasty.  I think it would be great with ham for a brunch  - it was sweeter than a traditional stuffing and very light.  Didn't hold together like 'dressing' stuffing.

I really liked this, but it wasn't a big hit with the crowd, because it is so different then traditional stuffing. Changes we made: fresh cranberries cut in half and doubled the sugar (won't do this next time) and butter.

Far to dry as written.

I made this recipe a few years ago for Thanksgiving. I was a little nervous...I didn't know if people would like it since it isn't your typical stuffing. Great news...it was a hit! Definitely a sweeter flavor, but I loved it!

I did not like this stuffing very much. The flavors were off and it was very dry to me.
