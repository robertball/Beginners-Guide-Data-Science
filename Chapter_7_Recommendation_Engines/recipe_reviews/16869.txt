This recipe is wonderful and so quick and easy to make.  I did make some changes however.  Instead of using the bouillon cubes I substituted 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth for 1 cup of the water used to cook the rice.  I also added some black pepper, Italian seasoning and rosemary to the chicken while cooking.  I also added 1 can of drained string beans for more vegetables.  The taste was wonderful.  Added bonus is the one dish meal makes for easier clean up!  This will become a staple meal in our home!

This was soooo good and definately a repeat meal.  I changed it up just a little bit. I added some garlic salt, paprika, cajun and parsley to the chicken for taste.  I then sauteed the mushrooms with the chicken.  When I cooked the rice, I used 1 can of chicken broth instead of the cubes and an additional 2 cans of water.  I also added some cooked broccoli to the mixture - but it didn't seem to make very much of a difference.  I think it would have been great without.  The only other thing I would change next time would be to make it a little bit spicier - maybe some currie or more cajun.

It is good, though I followed the other reviewers and added a few more spices. Note that the recipe calls for INSTANT rice. There are other reviews telling you to add water. Only do that if you are NOT using instant rice. Instant needs a 1:1 ratio of water:rice whereas regular rice needs a 2:1 ratio.

The recipe is a bit short on water, not giving the rice enough liquid to cook.  Adding an extra cup of water should do it.  Also, instead of taking the pot out of the burner after adding the rice, simmer the rice instead until all the liquid has gone.  I added stir-fried carrots and green peppers for more veggies.

This is a great family recipe that even my 3 year old devoured with relish. However,the original recipe is too bland (in my opinion) so I added in a pinch of paprika,thyme, basil and a good few grinds of black pepper. I also added  half a red bell pepper as i had to use it up, but i think it added a nice extra flavour and texture to the whole dish.  In future I'd put in some diced onion and a little garlic too I think. This is not quite a 5 star recipe as I had to add an extra can full of water with the tomatoes to give enough liquid for the rice to absorb. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!

A quick dish that saved dinner in a pinch when I realized I didn't have the ingredients needed for the dinner I was GOING to prepare. It was OK but probably won't make again.

Used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom & Garlic, as well as a can of diced tomatoes "chili style." Added a bit more chili powder, also, as we're a fan of spice! Sauteed up some sliced mushrooms to add also, as we love mushrooms, and overall it was sooooo easy and got rave reviews from the 4 adult men in our household! Us gals thought it was ok. Will make again.

This recipe was very easy...and good.  However, I does require more seasoning, especially for the chicken. I sauteed the chicken and mushrooms together, added the tomatoes and served over rice.  My brother, who is picky and never eats leftovers, had seconds and ate more the next day.  This is a winner.

This recipe is named correctly because it was a pleasant surprise.   Like other reviewers, I added seasoning because I was afraid it would be too bland for us.  So before sautéing the chicken with a little olive oil in the skillet, I sprinkled it with black pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and poultry seasoning.  In addition, I used canned tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic.  With these tweaks the recipe tasted great.  It is so easy and is a keeper.

My husband and I both really liked this - it was much better than I expected, honestly, living up to it's name. I did use fresh mushrooms, and Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes. Also seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning salt and a little garlic. I left out the bouillon/broth as I didn't have any on hand.

This was a very quick and simple recipe. I had to use what we had on hand, but it turned out very yummy. I already had cooked chicken and cooked rice in the fridge. I put 3-4 cups of cooked rice in a pan, added 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup, diced cooked chicken, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (we like them), and let it simmer. The other reviews mentioned the dish needed some seasoning, so I added salt and pepper, and topped it off with a good bit of Lowry's Lemon Pepper (not lemon-pepper seasoning, per se, but the actual lemon-flavored pepper, if that makes any sense). All in all, it was great. It freezes wonderful, reheats like a dream, and fills up hungry folks without breaking the budget.

We thought this was really good.  I did do the suggestions for adding some more spices to it.  I added garlic, italian seasoning, and pepper.  Then I added some parsley to the rice.  I also sauted onions and carrots before the chicken.  With what I added I would have given this a 5.  We will make again!

This meal was quick, easy and pretty tasty.  My kids ate it and my husband did too.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is becuase I jazzed up the flavors with a little onion, garlic, and sauteed fresh mushrooms.  After that, I would give it a 5.

very good! easy to make, I added some mexican/southwestern spices and some green chili peppers and some cheese to make it a little different.. pretty good!
It does need more spices, as recommended in some other reviews- garlic in the rice would be ideal!
a great meal!

All in all we liked this recipe it was easy to make the only thing is we would have liked it to have a bit more flavor to it. We will eat again though for a quick meal.

I made it in my Instant Pot and it was awesome.  I had to let some moisture evaporate out, tho.  Since it's a pressure cooker you don't lose enough moisture for 2 cups of water... otherwise, perfect! Not burned, not dry and crumble apart....I'll do this again for sure.

Followed suggestions given re: extra spices, onions, mushrooms, broth instead of wate/bullion. Wouldn’t have thought of adding canned tomatoes, added a lot of flavor. Easy and will likely do again.

I made this but with some adjustments. Used Low-sodium chicken broth instead of bullion, added a little more water to cook the rice and used stewed tomatoes with basil for more flavor. All that being said we enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

It's an excellent base. I added basil, oregano, parsley and garlic and used mild Rotel instead of stewed tomatoes. Came out amazing! My Italian family gave it the 2 thumbs up award!

I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans to the mixture and a few more seasonings that my family prefers.  Everyone went back for seconds! This is a good, quick, cheap meal.

When attempting to eat healthy, it's often a challenge to find heart healthy recipes. Chicken Surprise, which can easily function as the main course or an excellent side dish, is certainly a versatile recipe that falls under the healthy umbrella. My only addition was a little Cajun seasoning, which was a good choice. Next time, I'll use diced tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes. The diced tomatoes provide smaller and more numerous tomato chunks. It seems like stewed tomatoes have five or six hunks of tomato, which means the tomato isn't dispersed well throughout the dish. I expected a very average flavor from the dish, and was pleasantly surprised. The poultry seasoning added a ton of flavor without being overwhelming.

I made it with "rice in a bag" and added it to the mushrooms and tomatoes.  Simmered it with chicken for Added a little cayanne pepper to add heat.
