Was very quick and easy. I added some crushed red pepper for a kick, it needed something.

I don't usually like warm tuna or tuna casseroles, but this was suprisingly good.  I'll be making it again.

I made this last night, and this is pretty good by itself, but would be better if you added something with a little kick to it. It's a little bland. I will try this again and add to it.
