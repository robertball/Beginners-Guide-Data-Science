This was exactly what you'd expect it to be.  I didn't have dried summer savory so I used thyme w/ a dash of sage.  I made it as a side dish and it taste good but a little dry so next time I'll make it w/ a saucy dish to accompany it.

This is JUST the recipe I was looking for!  I unintentionally added more Summer Savory than the recipe called for, but it didn't ruin the taste at all, which I was worried that it would.  I didn't add celery, not a fan of celery, but this recipe was still great without it.  :)  Thank you for sharing, my fiance and I have decided this is a keeper!

This has a really great flavor, just a bit dry.  Everyone liked it but as the minutes went by it got more and more dry.  But, I do like it so much I want to experiment with a few things like cream of celery to get it just right for our tastes.  Thank you for the recipe.

Just what I was looking for! I am from Nova Scotia Canada but now live in Australia. It was hard to get summer savory but ordered savory on the internet. The only thing I did differently was omitt the celery and add some sugar so it would be as close as possible to my mums recipe!

I used this to stuff a chicken. I liked it, but I think it could have used  a little more flavour.

Yes I left out the bread and added more summer savory and a little more onion. And a hand full of rasins for a touch of sweetness.

No I didn't try this recipe, but this is VERY similar to the recipe my grandmother makes! I finally found exact measurements thank you! Only thing my grandmother does different is no onion and she boils her celery to use the celery water in the stuffing, less dry.

This is the same as I've made for years... Being from northern Maine, many of our recipes are from our neighbors and friends in New Brunswick!

I left out the bread and used sweet potatoes - orange fleshed, needed to be gluten free, and it was so delicious.  Everybody loved the taste.

My stars may be biased due to the fact that I cook seldomly and when I can create somethinv edible at the least, I immediately fancy it haha. But realistically, I loved the way it wasn't overpowering but was still flavorful and lasting. I would make this again and would love to expand on it someday!

(Do note that I have yet to bake it!)

I didn't have savory, so used "Bell's Seasoning" instead.  Very tasty.  We were trying to duplicate a favorite family recipe and this came very close!

I made this times 17 and serve it at a wedding of 195 people. I froze it then heated it the day of the wedding. It was absolutely perfect. I don't know how else you could make enough stuffing for 200 people! Thanks for this fabulous recipe. The only thing I did differently is add a whole lot more poultry seasoning.

Very similar to my mothers recipe although I do not use celery and only 1/2 of an onion as my family doesn't care for onions. Summer Savoury is a must for a true New Brunswick taste.  Gives it that taste of home for the holidays.

This dish is a lot like my mother used to make.  It is simple yet brings back my growing up holiday memories.  The only changes I made was to add a brushing of butter on the top of the dish to enhance browning and crispy bits on the outside.  I also used raisin bread and added a peeled and chopped apple.  Wonderful.
