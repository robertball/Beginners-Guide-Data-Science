This soup was a welcome addition to our keto recipe collection!  I halved the broth and added a little extra heavy cream, about 1/4 C.  I also used the spicy rotel and a dash of cayenne pepper because we love spicy food.  The whole family loved it!  Side note:  served with avocado, mexican cheese and chives on top.

Our new family favorite! I am trying to do keto and it’s hard with a picky husband and a one year old. If you’re looking for family friendly keto recipes, this is it. Some people mentioned it was a little runny or thin and I’ve found that the leftovers are actually better because it has time to “set up”. We ate it for dinner and I added a handful of shredded cheese in the pot to thicken it up a bit and add some more flavor and that made a huge difference. We are now eating it for lunch  and it definitely seems thicker today. I added some sour cream to my one year old’s to tone down the mild spice for her. Overall we loved it with just those couple adjustments!

An easy, Keto-friendly meal for a chilly evening. I followed the advice of other commenters and reduced the broth by half and increased the heavy cream in order to thicken the base, and I added grated fontina cheese for extra flavor. My husband gobbled down two bowls, so it gets the family stamp of approval. Will definitely make this again.

I used 4 oz. of cream cheese in stead of 8oz., added about 4 cups of cabbage, and chopped up 4 jalapenos (seeds removed).  It was really good and perfect for a cool evening!

The flavor was fine, but it could be a little richer in taste.  I  thought this would be a creamier soup, but it was very liquid-y; however the family ate & liked it.  I followed the recipe to a "T" , but only used 1 can of Rotel (drained).  The 1 can was plenty of tomatoes.  I might make this again, but with some alterations to make it thicker & richer in flavor.

I used one can of broth and will not use the cream next time. Seemed to take the edge off the yummy flavor.

This recipe was amazing! My husband who is a picky eater gobbled 3 bowls of it! I added 1/3 cup of finely diced yellow onion, 1/3 cup of finely diced red bell pepper, 1/3 cup of finely diced green bell pepper, 1/3 cup of finely diced zucchini. SO QUICK too which is even better!

This was really good!  Only change I made was to put in half as much broth as was called for, so the soup would be thicker.  Flavor was superb!  Didn't need the salt - be sure to taste before adding.

So tempted to have even more, but it is filling!

I liked this soup. I used 1 1/2 pounds hamburger.  I only put 1 can of Ro-Tel. I added a small can green chilies. I also added a teaspoon of xantham gum to thicken. I will definitely make it again. May try it with chicken and chicken broth as well. Jeannie Baker  McKinney, TX

Everyone in the house loved it! I used ground turkey and added a teaspoon of xanthum gum to thicken a bit--make sure to whisk in a little at a time to avoid clumping together. The rotel adds a bit of a kick but not enough to deter a 5 year old! Super comforting soup for chilly fall days. I served w/ cornbread muffins for the non-keto peeps in the house. And SO SIMPLE!!

Really good! I added half and half and cooked a bit longer to thicken a bit. I'm definitely recommending this budget friendly meal.

I agree with the others. A little on the thin side but was very good and I would make it again. I used chicken brother instead of beef.

This is a keeper for keto recipes!   Did not alter the recipe but will next time by decreasing liquid and adding more cream.  Delicious keto recipe!  It’s a must for peeps on the keto diet.

This soup was soo bomb! Forgot to add the second can of diced tomatoes, but it turned out really nice.  To serve, add a dollop of sour cream in the middle and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese. It was amazing and filling! 10/10 would recommend!

Good as is, but I changed things up a bit. I used 1&1/2 t cumin and 1&1/2 t ground jalapeno pepper (McCormicks). Nice kick! As others noted, it's runny to start so I added about 1/4 t xanthan gum to thicken it. Delish!!

Delicious!  I don’t like diced tomatoes, so I subbed a 14.5 ounce can of tomato sauce. I also prefer more heat so I added diced green chilies and diced jalapeños and cayenne. No other changes. So good and an easy quick meal.

I made a double batch! I added about a cup of cilantro. One poblano pepper, and a half a cup of sour cream. Also 1 tbls of cayenne pepper to spice it up. I tripled the chili powder and doubled the cumin as well. It is tasty!! Shredded sharp cheddar is a good edition to the top!

THIS WAS YUMMY.  I USED A WHOLE ONION AND ONLY ONE CAN OF BROTH.  I FORGOT TO ADD THE 1/2 and 1/2 AT THE  END  BECAUSE IT WAS SO THICK AND CREAMY.  I’ll make it again!!

I made it as per the recipe.   I found it quite good, though a tad bland which I fixed with a couple shakes of Chipotle Tabasco.  I will definitely be making again.

Made with 1/2 the broth, a tad more heavy cream, added red/yellow bell and jalapeno peppers and green chiles and topped with mozzarella cheese. Did not add salt during cooking.  Sauteed the peppers separately, then added to the soup per instructions.  Topped with cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper and salt.  Delicious!

Doubled the cumin and chili powder (we like it spicy), 2 tsp beef bullion, and added frozen corn at the end. It was awesome!  Will definitely be making this again!

We followed the recipe closely, but like many others used half the broth, added an can of corn (drained) and served it with avocado toppers. Wonderful. Tasty. Definitely in the Fall rotation.

Thank you so much for this keto friendly recipe. I love it and make it regularly. I do add a lil more cumin as it is one of my favorite flavors and some powdered garlic too.  I serve it with The taco blend shredded cheese

Its really good but needs more veggies. I added Zucchini. Its really thin so more veggies will thicken it up. A real hardy soup.

This has become a big favorite for my family.  Quick, easy, and kid approved!  I did take one suggestion from others and reduced the broth to only one can.  This gives it a bit more of a ‘stew’ feeling rather than soup.  It was a good suggestion,  we didn’t care for it being so ‘liquidy’, and it doesn’t take away from the flavor at all.  I add a splash of sriracha sauce to mine and yum!

This recipe was amazing! The macros fit in my Keto Diet , soup was creamy but not too creamy. I am not usually a soup person but this was a nice change up to my family’s Taco Tuesday theme.  I even added a few chunks of avocado to my bowl.

I used chicken because one of my princesses doesn’t like ground beef but I still used the beef broth.  It was the easiest, fastest and best tasting soup I’ve ever made and of course I will make it again.  I also called family and friends and told them about it and gave them the recipe. Five of them have called to tell me thanks. 
I used 5 skinless boneless breast.  Took them out of the freezer and boiled them without  defrosting then place them in my mind ser which shredded them and followed the recipe. YUM YUM YUM

Thinner consistency than I expected. While we may have enjoyed it more if it were thicker it's always helpful to get extra fluids. Good flavor!

Real good on a -7 degree winter day.

I made it because I just started Keto diet and was craving soup. I made the recipe as directed with only a substitution of chipotle chili pepper because that's what I had on hand.  I think it HAS to have the toppings to make it good. We topped it with avocado, cheddar cheese, and creama. The result was very good - we'll certainly have it again. Thank you for sharing.

This is a delicious soup!  I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did!  I was able to take some to lunch for a few days!  I agree with others, it is a thin soup.  I added cornstarch to thicken it up.

Taste was awesome but I like my soups thick. This was kinda runny. I don't want to cut back on the broth or the juice from the Rotel...both add a lot of flavor. This will require tweaking..

I doubled the recipe and added cayenne pepper for heat.  And shredded some cheddar on after it was in the bowl ready to eat.  This soup is amazing!  My husband and kids gobbled it up which was a bittersweet moment since I was planning to eat it for a couple of days! So good.

I have a very picky eater, so I pureed the tomatoes. She loved it! Only drawback was the consistency. It's very thin...going to try to figure out a way to thicken it up next time!
