Sometimes simple is best, and that is the case here.  So very simple to make, the uncooked peas pop in your mouth, and it's loaded with fresh flavor.  This recipe is enough to make you consider growing your own peas.  Loved it!

A refreshing salad!  I, too, used thawed frozen peas and added some chopped mint for added flavor.  Thanks for submitting this go-to recipe!

This is so simple, and so delishious that it makes the perfect salad for warm days!
I used a bag of frozen peas, after letting it come to room temp. ( don't cook them!)
Added a bit more lemon juice ( I love lemons,) and zest from the lemon. Sea salt and fresh ground pepper. 
Your guests and family will love this!

I loved these and I don't like peas all that much.  The lemon was my big motivator.  My kids found it super tart so I'll modify the amount of lemon juice, otherwise I was pleasantly surprised at the bright flavor and non-mushy texture of the frozen peas coming to room temp!

This is simple and fantastic. I used frozen peas, thawed, but uncooked. I found 1 1/2 cups of peas was plenty for three servings. I will make again.
