These are divine! I couldn't find the exact flavored Feta, so I chose basil and tomato which was just as delicious. Make sure to break apart any larger clumps of the feta! Easy to make, just a tad labor intensive but so worth it!

Delicious!  When calculating prep time the recipe states 25 minutes, the directions forgot to add in the 30 minute freezer time.  Will definitely makes this again.  A hit at the party!

This was so delicious that my husband and I were going to take it to a potluck and decided to stay home and eat it all for ourselves instead! Flavors are great. Be sure that the phyllo dough is fresh so it doesn't break apart while assembling. We had some leftover in the freezer that didn't do as well the second time we made it.

I also could only find tomato/basil feta.  I made them into triangles instead of roll-ups.  They were awesome!  A huge hit at a dinner party I attended.

It has an amazing flavor, but doesn't hold together well. The phylly dough can't stand up to the filling so the whole thing kind of goes flat. Everyone loves it though
