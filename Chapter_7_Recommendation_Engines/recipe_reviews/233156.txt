Easy and delicious.  I used Greek yogurt and didn't strain it.  I chopped up the cucumber and put it in our metal coffee filter with a sprinkling of sea salt, let it sit for about 20 - 30 minutes, and then pressed out excess water by pressing my fist down into the filter until almost no more water could be seen dripping out of the filter.

This turned out excellent! I haven't made tzatziki before, looking forward to making this again! Don't forget the salt and pepper to taste.

OMG, this is addicting!  Couple of changes.  Used Greek yogurt (no straining needed) and used about 1 tsp of garlic salt instead of fresh garlic and salt, only because we are not fans of raw garlic.  This will be my go to Tzatziki sauce!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a solid recipe for tzatziki. If you shortcut by using Greek yogurt instead of draining regular yogurt, then I recommend that you don't drain/squeeze the moisture from the grated cucumber - I did, and I didn't like the consistency - too thick/dry. Otherwise delicious.

This was delicious.  I used Greek yogurt so I didn't need to strain the yogurt, only the shredded cucumber.  I added just a pinch of mint at the end.  This was also delicious on fish/shrimp tacos.

Used English cucumber diced fine then squeezed water out. Used full-fat plain yogurt for richness. I will add more dill and maybe onion powder next time for more flavor.

Delicious. I have made it eith greek yogurt and normal yogurt and both are great. I omittted the dill because I didn't have any. We love this with the spinach and feta turkey burgers from this site.

Just have to watch the liquid from the cucumbers, can get awfully wet if not squeezed and drained enough. Some of it may come from the fact that we used our own garden cucumbers.  Extremely fresh

Really good on gyros.  I'll definitely make it again.  I loved dill, so I tried this recipe over others that use mint.  I didn't make any major changes: I used Turkish yogurt, and didn't drain it (it's pretty thick).  I used a paper towel to squeeze out the moisture in the cucumber, which worked very well.  I didn't have any garlic cloves, so I used garlic paste.  I did leave out the lemon juice.

Great sauce, light and fresh. I made it on the spot, so I didnâ€™t have time to drain the yogurt. It was delicious on my salmon despite not being drained.

I didn't drain the yogurt by mistake so that was my bad but even tho it turned out thin, the flavor was still good, but not the best I've had. I'm thriving for a more complex flavor I think. I'll try it again and tweak it to see if that helps. I'm happy I gave it a go, good recipe!

I used greek yogurt to avoid the draining step.  This is really good on turkey burgers.

Delicious!   I used plain greek yogurt because I like the thick, rich flavor as compared to regular plain yogurt.  I left all other ingredients as is.  I will definitely make again.

Simple and delicious and healthy! easy to drain both the yogurt and cukes, which ensured a great consistency.  I used this with the turkey feta Kalamata 
burger recipe,  and it was a perfect pairing.

Flavorful and easy! Don't get angry, but I used Low Fat Cottage Cheese instead of Yogurt (because I had to use it up), whirled it in the food processor until completely smooth, drained my salted 'minced' cucumber well, then rinsed off the salt, and dried on a paper towel. I omitted the dill, but the garlic and lemon created the bite and tartness I was hoping for. Thx to jslingo for posting it.

I have made this recipe many times at this point and have found that, like other reviews, greek yogurt is sufficient and just as good. I also squeeze the cucumber between layers of paper towels to remove moisture and use dried dill instead of fresh. I have served this with pitas, lemon chicken, and fresh veggies. It is delicious with all these things and I will continue to make for a long time.
