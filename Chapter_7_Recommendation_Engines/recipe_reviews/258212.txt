Followed recipe with everything pulsed for one minute in batches, and ended up too processed, and after stewed with vinegar and sugar, created poor texture. Seeds were kind of off putting. Flavor was pretty one-note, needs to be rounded out some other flavors, aromatics like maybe mustard seed, clove, coriander.

I made it with Sarrano peppers (I had a bush that got caught in the frost) and sweet green peppers, because I didn't have the yellow/red peppers.  To add a little more color and balance out the heat, I also ground up a couple cups of carrots.

It's definitely got a pop to it, and should go great on burgers, bagels, or anything else!

Super spicy but totally tasty! I actually used a bit less of the hot peppers than was on the recipe only because that's what I had from the garden. Glad I did as it might've been too spicy! Also didn't have any cider vinegar so used white. Smelled delicious as it was cooking and tastes even better. Can't wait to try it on a sandwich or even on cream cheese with crackers!

I have made this several times now.   I use serrano peppers and my husband eats it on burgers or just with crackers.  It is one of his favorites.

Really good basic recipient for relishes. Made some for my wife, who loves the stuff at restaurants, and wound up eating most of it myself. Great for sandwiches, omelets whatever. I didn't do and processing, just diced and loved it. Thanks and looking forward to another batch!
