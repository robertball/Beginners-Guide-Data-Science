Good recipe.  I didn't cut the pork chops open and I slowly cooked them on the stove-top rather than the barbecue.  Tasted great and my husband loved them.

This was really good.  Instead of the Pork Chop- I used the Pork Cutlett.  I had to reduce the cook time to 20-25 minutes because the thinner meat.

I used thin pork chops trimmed all the fat.Instead of 2 cups of Worcestershire sauce,I only used 1 cup & added 1/4 cup kikkoman lite soy sauce.I also added some garlic powder & a dash of dry rosemary.I used a George foreman grill cooked it for 4 mins added some onions to it and served with some mix veggies.We also ate it with some steam rice :)

Mmmm this was delicious. My family is very big on garlic tho, so I added a little juice from refrigerated chopped Garlic (maybe a tsp) and it gave it just a little extra wonderful falvor.

Easy to make. Exactly what I was looking for.  But the flavor was not great. Neither the worcestershire nor honey was too strong. My family will eat it again, but I will tweak it with some other flavor, don't know what yet.

I wasn't expecting to like this because I don't like Worcestershire sauce, but it didn't have a strong Worcestershire taste. It was really, really easy, and tasted great!

The whole family loved it.  They want me to make more.  I added onions a 1/4 of one to mine and a little bit of Chili flakes.

I added some Louisiana hot sauce to the mixture and garlic powder.  I marinated pork and chicken. It was delish.
