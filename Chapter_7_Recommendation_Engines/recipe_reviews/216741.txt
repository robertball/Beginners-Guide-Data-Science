The "old fashion" is a cocktail often ordered when waiting for one of those famous Midwest Friday Fish Frys.  I have been making Old Fashion mix for years.  Angostura Aromatic Bitters found in grocery or liquor stores.

1. The leisure suit is an old fashion.  The cocktail is called an "old fashionED."  

2.) This recipe incorporates two of the essential ingredients of an old fashioned--sugar and aromatic bitters.  However, to build on what another reviewer said, this mix is so simple it hardly seems worth the effort.  Just keep a little simple syrup and bitters on hand if that's your fancy.

For a variation, consider a mix that adds maraschino cherry juice and a little orange juice as well.  THAT particular concoction tends to pair best with a brandy old fashioned sweet, or a brandy old fashioned press, but can be just as tasty with the right whiskey or bourbon as well.

I love Old Fashions so I thought I would give this a whirl. I think it was way too heavy on the bitters so I would suggest cutting them down to suit your taste. That being said, I think making them from scratch is so easy I don't think I would make this again. Thanks for sharing!
