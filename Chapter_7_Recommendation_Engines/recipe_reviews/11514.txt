YUMMY!  I added a tsp of lemon zest to the dough and had to use 1 cup of Agave nectar as I was out of honey; consequently, I added about 1/4 cup extra flour while blending dough to get perfect consistency - these were delicious - my husband enjoyed the hint of sweetness leaving them plain and my daughter and I topped some with a delicious lemon frosting and toasted coconuts & almonds.  I baked these for 10 minutes and they came out perfect - soft, wholesome and super yummy!

Yum. It tastes really wholesome, and if you like the high-fiber taste, this is the cookie for you (don't add frosting).  I reduced the honey to 3/4c. and think they taste great. You don't need to spread them apart so much on the cookie sheet, but they do puff up.

I made these with some kids for a rainy day activity, the dough was the perfect consistency for the kids to roll out without sticking to everything, it was also great that we didn't have to wait while it chilled in the fridge, and I felt good about letting them eat as many as they wanted when they were done, because they weren't junk!

Good recipe. Cookies were cracker-like just as the recipe says. I used 1/2 of the honey, but still found the cookies super-sweet. 1/4 cup of honey would be plenty.

I really like these cookies.  I make a bunch of them and put them in the cookie jar to have on hand for tea guests.  They are crunchy, but can be made a little thicker if you prefer a more chewy cookie. The taste of them is really great though and much better than any white flour cut out cookie in my opinion.

Since my kids are surrounded by so much sugar around the holidays, I was glad to find a healthier roll-out cookie that we could make together.  They reminded me of homemade graham crackers, and I could add sweet decorative icing without feeling so guilty.

The dough is very very manageable, there's no need to flour the counter top to roll. I would add next time more honey or a 1/3C of brown sugar. I made small cookies flower with guava mermelade of these for my niece...the were sort of tasteless. With the remaining dough i made cinnamon crackers, I topped it before baking with brown sugar and a lot of cinnamon: DELIGHTFUL!

Absolutely Delicious! I made these exactly as the recipe says. They are super easy and super good! Just the right amount of sweetness in my opinion. Easy to roll out, and easy to cut. Also good topped with Strawberry Preserves. My picky 2-year old loves them too. Thanks for a great healthy cookie recipe! :)

Great for decorating.  Used a powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk frosting and it was great-not too sweet, just right with frosting.  I cut honey in half but would not do so if I wasn't decorating them... Liked how they didnt stick to things and didnt break like other cut outs.

Unsure at first about these.  I used oat flour to eliminate the wheat, so it needed a little less liquid.  Surprisingly the dough was quite easy to work with even though it seemed too sticky, and my kids loved these cookies.  I used only half the honey, and then frosted them with a maple icing.  Very good!
ETA: This recipe made 5 dozen cookies for me, but I simply cut the dough into squares instead of using cookie cutters.

Great dough for cut-outs.  Used with bone cookie cutter for a dog theme party. Put a sprinkle of cinnamon on top- looked like dog biscuits! Exchanged a cup of the whole wheat with white flour.  Taste was ok.

I ended up having to add an extra cup of flour because the dough was just too sticky.  I also added a bit of salt because I enjoy the taste salt adds to a cookie.  Taste was wonderful and wholesome.  The toddlers I made them for gobbled them up!  Next time I may try substituting applesause for part of the butter to make them even healthier.

Just made these today and they are delicious!  I substituted 1/2 cup of non-fat greek yogurt for 1/2 of the butter, just because I only had 1 stick, but I will do this every time now.  These make a nice, soft cookie (baked for 12 minutes) and definitely remind me of honey graham crackers.  My very picky toddler loves them, and I didn't even frost them!

My new favorite cut out cookie recipe!  This is so easy, healthy enough, and delicious!  I usually dread cut out cookies, but this dough is a dream to work with.  Now my only problem is trying not to eat them all by myself! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and made them a little thicker.  But other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Yeah!

Wonderful cookies! I cut the recipe in half, and used the whole egg (not knowing a way to cut that into half). I added 2 tsp vanilla and omitted the hot water. I also added about 1/4 to 1/3rd sprouted wholegrain flour. I also used maple syrup for sweetener. Perfect!! Rolls out very nicely too. Thanks very much for a wonderful cookie that my 3 yr old daughter can't keep her hands off.

These were great!  I pretty much followed the recipe, except using slightly less honey.  They are super easy.  I like that you can roll and bake them right away.  A great whole wheat/honey with no refined sugars recipe.  I used star and heart cookie cutters.  I can definitely give these away, unlike a lot of whole wheat/honey "cakies."

Excellent!  I used 3/4 cup honey and white while wheat flour after reading reviews, and they were excellent!  Easy to work with, pleasant taste for a base cookie; similar to graham crackers.

The cookies were very easy to make even without a mixer. You don't have to freeze the dough. We used honey and sugar and it came out delicious! It is a very fast process to make the cookies.
Really recommend
(by 10 y.o.)
Mom: We didn't have enough honey, so we substituted some with sugar. Cookies came out very tasty without any additional additives (spices, vanilla etc.).

These are great!  Not as sweet as sugar cookies but perfect for what they are, and still sweet and delicious.  I don't feel feel bad about making them with me girls and bonus: they don't require refrigerating the dough, so it's less than half an hour from "let's make cookies!" to eating them.

Well, I can honestly say that I've been making cut out cookies since I was 10 and have never had such trouble! I was able to salvage these, however.... For some reason my dough was WAY too soft and sticky. (other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem?) The only cause I can think of is that my honey was raw and somewhat granular -though this has never posed a problem in baking before. I ended having to add over 2 cups of flour (yikes!) just to be able to roll it out. This of course diminished the taste considerably (I'm assuming), so I compensated by sprinkling with cinnamon. They turned out pretty good! My 2 year old definitely had no problem eating them. :) I would advise adding the honey a little at a time to see how much you need to reach the desired consistency. I will try this next time. :)

Definitely add the extra cup of flour.  Also added 1/3 c. more brown sugar, + 1tsp vanilla.
