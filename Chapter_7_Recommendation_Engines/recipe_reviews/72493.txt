This is a very good recipe for anyone who isn't crazy about asparagus.  I omitted the extra salt because of the soy sauce, kept out the sugar, and used rice vinegar instead of cider (because I had it on hand).  I also don't like asparagus mushy, so I didn't saute too long.  I liked this so much I made another batch after dinner.

This recipe was so simple, yet the outcome is so delicious!  Anyone with very little time to cook, but who wants to make a delicious meal, should try this.  I substituted white wine that I had for the sherry (Rachel Ray taught me to use any wine if you don't have sherry) and just used regular vinegar.  I also put a handful of asparagus in along with some frozen cooked shrimp.  I make this quite often when I want a great, healthy meal, but don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

Delicious, quick and easy to make. I don't usually like asparagus, but I did using this recipe. I didn't have any sherry, so didn't use that.

This was very good.  I forgot the cornstartch by accident and it was still great, not as thick obviously, but still very tasty. I substituted Splenda for the sugar for a low-cal side dish. I will make this again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I had a similar recipe served to me 35 years ago. I have the MIL's asparagus patch in the back yard, and a craving for nice hi fiber, hi folic acid dish.  This is an aspargus dish I can enjoy.  So glad to have found it!

Yummers!!  I liked this a lot!  The sauce was a unique flavor and suited the asparagus well.  I deglazed the pan with a little white wine.  I can see using this sauce in a vaierty of different dishes---it's that good.  The asparagus was very crisp.  We very fighting for the last pieces!!

I'm not sure what it is but I did not care for the sauce at all.  It had a sharp tang...not a pleasant tang and I followed the recipe exactly.  I added some oyster sauce and it was more palatable.  So many better recipes for asparagus - sorry I will not make this again.

I love all the ingredients listed, and have had them in combination with other foods and enjoyed.  I have to say, I did not care for the blend of those flavors with the asparagus.  did not add salt, as I had some in the homemade broth, as well as the soy.  Subbed a bit of honey for the sugar, and used seasoned rice vinegar.   It lacked 'something'.  Tried jazzing it up a little with a few drops of sesame oil and garlic powder, which helped.  Plan on serving this with chicken katsu,

Asparagus turned out juicy and crunchy. I loved that. But the overall flavor was unimpressive.

Wonderful! Like others I omitted the extra salt & sugar. The soy sauce has a wonderful flavor on it's own. I also didn't use dry mustard because I didn't have any. I added red pepper flakes and finely chopped ginger, and threw in some sliced red and yellow peppers. Served it over brown rice. This side dish also makes a delicious vegetarian meal!!

It was ok.  It was a good idea for a new way to make asparagus.  I think it needed something, though- like chicken or red bell peppers or broccoli or something.

Mmmm Good. My boyfriend would not try asparagus plain. So I hooked this up for him and now he'll eat it no other way. The sauce is really good.
