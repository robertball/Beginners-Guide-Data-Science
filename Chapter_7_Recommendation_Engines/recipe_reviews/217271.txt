Great recipe! When I made it, I didn't realize how long it was supposed to marinate for. I only let it sit for maybe 30 mins. Still great flavor. I also didnt realize the chicken I had wasn't boneless. I still grilled it but turned it into Shredded Grilled Chicken Pineapple Sliders. Also, instead of spreading the teriyaki sauce onto the bun, I added the 2 Tbsp into the shredded chicken and mixed it. It turned out just as Awesome! Great flavors!

Very good!  I made as is with the exception of melting swiss cheese on top of the chicken breast ( I just love cheese).  I really liked the sweetness of the hawaiian bread and the tang from the teriyaki sauce.  This was quick and easy and something my husband can definitely make. Adding this to our menu rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very nice ... Hint of teriyaki sauce and nice balance between the grilled chicken which I butterflied off the grill, red onion and pineapple... I used flat bread instead of the Hawaiian rolls. Just was afraid with the rest of the menu borderline sweetness felt a need to round out with a more subtle bread on this one.

These were really great.  I made them as directed, except I omitted the red onion because we are not fans of them, and added a slice of cheddar cheese.  I have a love affair with pineapples and cheddar, so I could not resist adding it!  I will definitely be making this again.

These were really yummy! The only thing I did different was I carmelized the onions so they were sweet rather than strong. My husband took leftovers to work and had all of his buddies eyeballing his lunch. Definitely a hit and will make again.

Meh. My hubs and I weren't fond of these. We both agree that the teriyaki sauce should be used as a marinade AND to baste the chicken with (skipping the citrus altogether) rather than as a condiment on each sandwich. A dab of mayo would be a better choice, IMHO. We also felt that the pineapple should be basted with some of the teriyaki as well and that the onion should be grilled rather than raw. Thankfully, I grilled both. Maybe these will float your boat, but they need quite a bit of tweaking to suit us. Thanks anyways, Lindsay-Lou. :)

I prefer to marinate this in equal parts teriyaki sauce and pineapple juice. I carmelize white or yellow onion slices along with thinly sliced fresh mushrooms. Top the chicken with slices of provolone for the ultimate chicken slider.

My whole family loved this.  I marinated this overnight and I added garlic, onions, the pineapple juice, soy sauce(instead of Salt) and a circle of teriyaki sauce.  It turned out perfect! Chicken was just right!  Even my 5 year step-son loved it!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Quick, easy, yummy. I added a healthy dose of cayenne to the marinade (~1 teaspoon), to kick it up. Thank you.

A bit bland and  boring. I think it would taste better if the chicken was marinaded in teriyaki instead of just drizzling it on the bread.

Wow! That was the responce from everyone. We were a bit skeptical of the combination, and we were wrong. When I went to get the pineapple, I forgot to get the Hawaiian bread rolls, so we used hamburger buns. Really a great treat, gotta try this with boneless pork chops. Thanks for sharing. I did try this with pork chops, it was ok. I will stick with the chicken.

What a great change on chicken breast. Added siracha-mayonaise and instead of teriyaki we mixed sweet and sour sauce with soy sauce. It's a keeper!!!

My boyfriend made this last night and they were awesome!  He didn't use the Hawaiian buns, but more of a regular slider kind.  We agreed that next time we wouldn't toast the buns, as it made them too hard.  We might try to grill them a bit to still give it a crunch.  I recommend these for parties and if you just want something light, but that is going to fill you up.  Add a nice pasta salad and it would be a great dinner!

Wow! My family gobbled these up! I did marinate the chicken in teriyaki sauce like another reviewer suggested and added a slice of ultra thin sliced swiss cheese - definitely will add this recipe to our dinner rotation!

This sandwich was okay. It lacked a little flavor for us. I made it as stated in the recipe except I allowed the chicken to marinate a few hours longer. I would probably make these again for a nice weekend lunch, but I would experiment with seasonings on the chicken for more flavor. It is a fun idea!

It was just okay...The sour flavor of the chicken overpowered the other flavors.  Would not marinate in the lemon in the future for so long (45 min)....maybe not at all.  I used chicken tenders.

made these yesterday for a party and they were a big hit everybody to love them. I used chicken tenders and marinated them and teriyaki sauce, a lot of pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, lemon, lime and a little fresh cracked pepper.

I just marinated in teriyaki for 24 hours. Used chicken thighs. Dipped pineapple and onion in teriyaki and grilled. Used mayo in the bread. So good!!

Just great.  A terrrific go to recipe when company is coming and you just want a little something quick and different.  I did fine the Hawaain roles a little small although they go with the theme of the dish.  Next time I may use larger roles.  Everyone loved it!!

Ok, I did change it (a bit) but I basically followed the recipe. Love this recipe! Nice change and I will make it often throughout the summer. My changes: I added the teriyaki sauce to the marinade and added an 1/2 tsp of our own homemade spicy pepper blend. (We love spicy) Added grilled jalapeño peppers (from the garden). We also used regular honey slider rolls. Because I didn't drizzle teriyaki sauce on the rolls, I felt it was dry, although the taste was amazing, so we spread a blackened Cajun mustard on each one and OMG! That pushed it right over the top for me. It went from being a really good recipe to an amazing recipe.

I loved how tender the chicken was from marinating in the lemon and lime.  I cooked the red onions on the stovetop.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I forgot the pineapple at home so it was just the chicken and red onions (my fault).

I added fresh chopped garlic and a Tbsp of  teriyaki glaze. I also put garlic and onion powder on the chicken before marinating. I let the chicken marinate for about 3 hrs before cooking. I grilled the red onion and made sriracha mayo. The combination of the sweet pineapple and the spicy mayo was fantastic.  I left off the lettuce as I didn’t really feel it was needed, however it probably would have given it an additional layer of flavor and some crunch since the onion was cooked. Would definitely make this again.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but, we weren't fond of the flavor.   I would have skipped the citrus marinade because I thought it fought with the flavor of the teriyaki.  I used on Hawaiin roll mini sub rolls.

Yum!  I used chicken thighs and these sandwiches were a hit with my 11-y/o daughter and her friend who had a sleepover with us.  She went home and raved about our meal.  It’s beautiful to boot with fresh grilled pineapple.

Yes it was delicious. It's good to have recipies with deferment flavors that I never knew what seasonings since I was brought up in the South with the same old ways to cook over and over.  Thank you so much. I love having your help and so does every one else.  Angel. (Nick name real name Sandra Stokes)

SUPERB! It's not a slider, it's a meal! I let my chicken marinate all afternoon and wow, amazing. I also used my home made herb rolls, fresh pineapple, white onion, and spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Amazing pops of flavor with each bite.

Excellent!   Grilled the chicken, pineapple and red onions.   Did not have teriyaki so used hoisin instead.   Used thighs instead of breasts due to personal preference.   Sliced everything and ate on romain lettuce leaves to avoid the carbs.   Will make again.

So easy and delicious! I've made these 3 times now (once using the grill outside and twice using an indoor grill) and each time they were fabulous. It's a new favorite for my kids. Thank you for posting!

What an easy flavorful dish! I made it as described except I used a different slider roll. Don't tell my husband. He raved about the slider but I am sure the Hawaiian roll would enhanced the already perfect flavors.

This was an excellent summer recipe with the sweet bread and pineapple.  I mixed the sauce with mayo, but that was the only change to recipe.  Will definitely make again.

First time made it as written and it was delicious.  Second time substituted 2 Tbsp pineapple juice (from the can of slices) for the lime juice and added 2 Tbsp teriyaki sauce to the marinade.  Even better and one less ingredient to buy.  The combo of grilled pineapple and grilled purple onions really makes it.  Some people preferred theirs with mayo.

It was very good. The bitterness of the lemon/lime and the sweetness of the pineapple is a great combination. Wonderful summer recipe.

CArmelized the onions. Had pineapple chunks instead of rings so added them to my onions. Sliderers were really good. Amazing flavors.

Family loved it!  They said it tasted like they were eating restaurant food. I did grill the onions and toasted the rolls on the BBQ also. Some added Havarti cheese too. I really liked how the marinade did alittle of the cooking. It made the BBQ cook time faster.  Will make this again.

We made this last night and it was really good.  I drizzled the teriyaki sauce over the chicken when it was done and we used the rolls to sop up extra sauce since it's not really 'spreadable'.  Forgot the onions, but everyone loved it anyway.

I skipped the marinade and used teriyaki sauce instead for two hours in the fridge. Yummy, but a little messy on Hawaiian rolls. I'll use a regular size bun next time.

These sliders were amazing! I served on mini ciabatta rolls.  Refreshing summer alternative to burgers.

We used fresh pineapple and sliced it thinner than the canned slices, cut onion very thin and substituted the sauce with a favorite Jerk sauce.  Next time we may add a slice of provolone cheese and forgo the bun.  Fantast base recipe with so many options.

Delicious! I did add a little hot sauce to the marinade just to counter the sweetness a little and ended up marinating it for a couple hours.

I followed the recipe to the T but at least for my taste, I felt it lacked something. It was a bit too simple though the pineapples did give it a nice touch. I probably will try the sliders with a different marinade next time and maybe something like guacamole instead of the teriyaki.

This was pretty tasty, even though I couldn't find Hawaiian rolls that were big enough to serve as buns.  (We used bulkies instead, and had little Hawaiian dinner rolls on the side.)
