I've tried so many waffle recipes and thought many of them were really good, but this one- WOW!  These are the yummiest waffles I've EVER had-soft, but slightly crunchy, super fluffy, and with just the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't add the lemon zest (no lemons) and thought I had messed it up, as I ran out of milk and had to leave everything to run to the store.  But they still came out perfect.  You have to try these!

Of all the waffles recipes I've tried on this site, this one would probably be the least easy to make with its requirements of grated lemon zest and beating the egg white separately.  However the bit of extra work is worth it.  The recipe says to beat the egg whites until foamy but keep going until stiff peaks form. I only used half the amount of lemon zest as that is all I had and still got a nice, lemony flavour, which went well topped with blueberries.  Finally the yield is incorrect-- I got three times as many waffles as stated.

The boys were bummed out there weren't any frozen waffles in the freezer so we decided to make a couple big batches together and freeze them. I only made one change and that was using "sour" milk in place of the regular milk. My one issue with this recipe was that the batter was SO runny. With waffles I've made before, the batter is a little fluffier and thicker. The waffles turned out just fine, just thin. Next time, I'll try adding an extra half cup of flour or try this recipe with half whole wheat flour. Using whole wheat flour, it just sucks up more of the liquid and makes for a heartier waffle than AP flour does. IMO. NOTE: I made four batches of this recipe today. The last three I added an extra half cup of flour. That made them just right.

These waffles were restaurant quality. My husband and I loved them. Hope the leftovers heat up as good. I subbed 1/2 cup ww flour and 1/2 cup oatmeal for one of the cups of flour to make them healthier. I had to make sure to put cooking spray on the waffle iron each time I cooked up another batch or it would stick. Cooking time was 4 minutes.

Wow! These definitely were easy and tasted great!I cut back on the milk a bit and used buttermilk vs. whole milk. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. This recipe is perfect as-is, but if you want a sweeter waffle you can up the sugar to as much as you like. I upped it to about 4-6 Tbsp and was liberal with the vanilla. These are delicious topped with real maple syrup!

I followed the recipe exactly, I usually make belgian yeast waffles but today i didn't have the time so I tried this one. I found they were a little on the chewy side and didn't stay crisp. The taste was just ok, similar to the box stuff where you add your own egg and milk. For all the work that went into this one ( egg white beating and separate bowls) I would rather go the extra step and make yeast waffles. They taste much better.

I just bought a waffle iron for my sister as a gift and I am printing out this recipe to go with it.   This recipe is just as important as the waffle iron!!!  It is definitely restaurant quality.   This recipe is awesome... every time I make it... it's a hit!  I recently made it for breakfast at my daughter's slumber party ...  and even her friends who are the "picky eaters" LOVED LOVED LOVED the waffles.  The kids love it with butter, syrup, (obviously) and Redi Whip whipped cream on top.  We've also had it with cooked blueberries over the top... YUM.  Another kid pleaser is to put some Hershey's Chocolate chips in the batter and use Hershey's syrup and whipped cream on top.  ANY WAY you serve this you will love it.  (And, the leftovers are even good, whether you refrigerate or freeze them...  not something you can say for all waffle recipes!)   I've tried many other recipes and this is BY FAR the best.  (Also... FYI... ditto on waffle makers and I love the GE waffle maker.)    I suggest doubling the recipe and making it up the night before since it uses different bowls, etc. in the preparation.  It's nice to wake up, have the batter in the refrigerator ready to go, and no mess in the kitchen.  DON'T leave out the lemon zest... a small thing but it makes the recipe much better.

great recipe! I didn't have any lemon, so i added orange zest. it was really good, but i would like to try them with the lemon. I love the crunchy outside and the soft inside. They didn't even stick at all. I thought the batter was a little thin at first, like maybe I had added too much milk, but they came out perfect.

I chose this waffle recipe because it had less butter than others.  It was DELICIOUS. Hadn't used my waffle iron in a year, but now I can't wait to make more of these.  My family loved them.

Really, really good waffles, light and crispy on the outside soft on the inside, just like waffles should be. The only thing I did differently, is I whipped the egg white until stiff peaks and omitted the lemon. Whipping the eggs whites until stiff makes the waffles lighter and crispier on the outsdide. Make sure to fold the egg whites into the batter gently.

Without the lemon, this is a good, basic waffle recipe. I like to make freezer waffles: I make the waffles as directed, I line them up on a cookie sheet lined with Parchment Paper and freeze them for a few hours, when frozen, I pop them off into a zip lock bag. And when I want to eat them, I just stick them in the toaster for a homemade "ego" waffle. These last good frozen for 2 months, thought people might like this idea!

These were good but they were not easy to prepare with the separating of the eggs and zesting the lemons. However, there was good flavor and we like the hint of lemon with each bite.

These waffles are super easy to make.
I accidentally broke the yolk of the first egg, so I threw the whole egg in with the other two yolks, thus ended up with three eggs in he mix, and I also substituted half of the AP flour with whole spelt flour. I use ground vanilla beans instead of the extract, so I mixed that in with the dry ingredients first, and since I had no whole lemons, I used some lemon juice instead of the zest.
So yes I made a bunch of changes, but the waffles came out amazingly fluffy yet crisp, and I’m sure they would have been much like that if I hadn’t made those changes, because the extra egg probably made up for the whole spelt flour.

I have to admit, I didn't do any of the separating. I just added all the dry ingredients, then beat the eggs with a fork a little in a cup, threw that in, and then added the rest of the liquid ingredients. Then I mixed it altogether with an electric mixer. Tasted great! Quick and easy.

I use a similar recipe using 3 eggs and omiting the lemon zest and vanilla. I know I won't eat all of them, so I freeze them and pop in the toaster, for a quick easy breakfast.

I can only rate this the way I made it: I used orange zest rather than lemon and added just a bit more sugar, maybe about a tsp. Otherwise it was the same and I thought they were fantastic! It made enough batter to last my husband and I 3 days and each day they seemed to taste better than the day before!
Though I have to wonder if it would really make much difference whether or not I separated the eggs and added the beaten egg whites at the end. It wasn't *that* much of a hassle, though I think next time I make these (and I most definitely will!) I'll just mix the eggs in whole rather than bothering with separating them and see how it goes.

My family loved them. Perfect for the lazy weekend brunch! I added a little extra milk as the batter seems a bit thick, but it made more then enough to feed my family of 4 with some leftovers to reheat later. Great recipe!!!!

For extra-crispy waffles (even after freezing!), add a heaping Tablespoon of cornstarch for every cup of flour in the recipe.

These were the best waffles I've ever made at home. I did use buttermilk (and added a bit of baking soda) because that's what I had on hand.  They were so light and crisp.  Yum!

We decided to add the lemon zest at the last second - we randomly had some lemons on hand, which is rare - and that is the best part of these waffles. Yum!

YUUUUM!!!!  I followed the directions exactly (except I subbed Lemon Juice for Zest) and these came out absolutely delicious!  I topped them with some pancake syrup, strawberries and whip cream.  Even my VERY picky 2 year old asked for 2nds & Hubby ate 4!!!

Yum!! The only thing I do diff is use olive oil instead of melted butter (not only healthier but also crisper waffle). Thanks!

These always turn out beautifully. As soon as I spill the beans that I am making waffles they are dancing, literally, in anticipation. This morning my husband was looking for a sweet topping and the boys, with my help, ate all the normal ones. I suggested ice cream to be silly, he did it. He took 2 waffles and made a sandwich and said it was "GREAT!" So breakfast and dessert all rolled into one! Sounds better than the strawberry jelly and vanilla yogurt I had. Next time... :9)

Loved this recipe. With 2 tbsp of lemon zest you can clearly taste it, but it's not overwhelming.

I made these for breakfast yesterday and waited until today to review so I could try the extras reheated.   I have eliminated the "waffle mix" from my pantry - what a great tasting and easy recipe that uses items I most always have on hand.  I made no changes to the original reicpe.  Thanks Cooking Mom!

Made these this morning - they were great.  Light and fluffy.  I didn't use the egg yolks due to my high cholesterol and only used 4 tablespoons of butter.  I did use 3 egg whites.  They were still delicious.  My 6 year old didn't like the lemon flavor, but I thought it was perfect! Highly recommended!

Okay, we recently got a new waffle iron, and we were making your standard Bisquick waffles.  The other morning, I decided to find a homemade waffle recipe.  This one looked interesting, and I learned on the Food Network that if you do whip your egg whites, and gently fold them in, your food will be lighter and fluffier.  I changed 2 things however. We like vanilla a lot, so I eliminated the lemon zest.  However, I tasted the batter and it had an overwhelming taste of flour.  So I added 2 more tablespoons of sugar, and it helped a lot.

I made these wonderful waffles after supper as a dessert. They are so light and fluffy. By far the best waffle recipe I have tried. You can add whatever flavor you want for a nice change of pace.

I LOVE this waffle recipe! The only thing I change is adding an extra 1/2 tsp of almond extract and leaving out the lemon zest just because I rarely have a lemon. It's perfect!

I just made these and LOVED them.  They were fluffy and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.    I had never made a recipe that called for the beaten egg whites so I was nervous -- however I was thrilled at how they turned out.  I had almond extract but no vanilla (how does THAT happen?) but otherwise I followed it to the letter.

These were by no means a quick, fix-it-in-the-a.m. deal. My kitchen was littered with dishes and mixing utensils after I was done with the recipe, and I'm normally a very neat person.  Otherwise, waffles came out well.  Took a long time to cook up, longer than usual if I were to use a pre-made mix.  Also, to intensify the citrus flavor, replaced vanilla with two tsp of lemon extract.

Waffles aren't very difficult, but these waffles are no less complicated than the most complicated waffles I've made, so the 'Easy' in the title is misleading. Still, if you are just looking for 'Great' waffles, this is a good recipe to try - the lemon in them is really nice, and they rise beautifully. I doubled this recipe and it made 6 waffles in my Belgian waffle iron. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an absolute staple in our house now!!  Best waffle recipe I have ever tried!!  My teenage boys are very athletic and needed something more substantial in the morning for breakfast.  We literally 4 1/2 times the recipe once a week and then keep the batter in milk jugs in our fridge so that no matter what time my kids are getting up in the morning, they can have good, healthy waffles for breakfast.  The waffles at the end of the week are just as good as the beginning of the week, and my kids never get sick of them.  Don't leave out the lemon zest!!  It is worth going to the store to get lemons for!! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!

The waffles were delicious. I altered the recipe a bit, using 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also added in a tablespoon of flax meal and cut the sugar to 1 tbsp since we use maple syrup on them when they are cooked. I didn't give it 5 stars because it uses 4 bowls (flour, egg whites, egg yolks, melted butter)—too many for my liking.

SCRUMPTIOUS WAFFLES!  I am picky and critical, but these were award-winning for flavour, texture, appearance, and all-around eatability.  I can see adding a bit of berries or chocolate for a variation.  But just as they were, the lemon zest and vanilla made for a delicate touch that blends well with maple syrup, fruit, yoghurt, chocolate, whipping cream.  I melted a pat of butter on mine and maple syrup and with maple sausages, these were divine.  They did not stick in the waffle maker machine, either.

a couple of weeks ago I was looking for a tasty and easy waffle recipe, I found one from this website but I did not save it and when I checked again today I could not find it.  given the high number of reviews and high rating this recipe got I decided to make this instead-I am happy I did.  
to make the waffles healthier I replaced one cup of white flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  as expected this made the batter thicker and the waffles were not as thin as they would be with just white flour.   I also did not add lemon zest and increased vanilla by a 1/4 tsp--they tasted great. I am giving this recipe 4 star just because of the number of steps involved in making the batter.

Perfect! These were so wonderful!!! Worth every bit of work. My kids and hubby loved them. The best part was there was enough batter. Usually recipes have enough for a few waffles. This made enough for my family of 5. Thank you!

I have the same recipe. I got it from a very old cookbook years ago. I wouldn't  say these are easy. I thought maybe I would find an easier one. The one step I thought might be left out but is included, is whipping the egg whites.  I guess this has to be done.  These egg whites are what really make this recipe so special.

My family really enjoyed these waffles.  I used a little less that 2 T of the lemon zest because I don't like a strong lemon flavor.  Next time I'll probably use 1 or maybe even a 1/2 T.  I can see how this would be delicious with orange zest too.  The recipe does take some time to make because of the zest, egg separation and usage of 3 bowls.  Easy is not a good description for this recipe, but I would say that it is GREAT and worth the time it takes to make them.

I love this recipe, it's simply the best! Must remember to separate eggs though, I skipped that step 1 time to save time & it didn't taste as fluffy. Best waffle recipe I have tired hands down.

Wonderful, the only thing I did differently in the recipe is use the zest from 2 clementines instead of lemon. The came out delicious and made the house smell good. Thanks!

These were really great waffles.  I received a Belgian waffle maker for Christmas and was searching for a good recipe.  I omitted the lemon zest and whipped the egg whites into soft peaks but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My teenagers loved them.  I only got 4 good sized waffles and one puny one out of the batch.  I'll have to make a double batch next time.

This recipe took some adjusting.  I halfed the lemon, added an extra 1/2 - 3/4 c flour, 1 TBS white sugar and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  It's a lot of work and uses many dishes, but in the end the waffles passed the kid test.  With the adjustments, we'd use it again. Thanks for posting.

These are so yummy! I whipped the egg whites until they were just about stiff. I didn't have any lemons, so I just used a tablespoon of lemon juice and removed a tablespoon from the milk, so that it didn't make the batter watery :) This is my first time making waffles myself, and they are amazing! Thanks!

I've one word to describe these waffles: INCREDIBLE!  

I didn't have any lemon or orange zest, but the waffles were delicious anyway. With our standard size regular waffle iron I was able to get 6 waffles out of this recipe - more than enough for the two of us. 

Thank you Cooking Mom for sharing this recipe. It will certainly be used in our household for many a breakfast down the road.

YUUUUUM!!  I used 1/2 all purpose white flour and 1/2 all purpose wheat and these were delicious!  I didn't have lemon zest, but these were great.  I've never used a recipe where I have had to seperate an egg and was a little intimidated, but as everyone else said...worth it!  I will definitely be using this as my go to waffle recipe.

I'm not a fan of waffles, but the missus requested them for supper tonight.  I made this recipe and the family raved about them.  I left out the lemon zest, and added some cinnamon.  I think the egg-white treatment made them much fluffier.

very yummy waffles, i made a few changes just because of health issues.  I used spelt flour, instead of butter I used coconut oil, instead of sugar I used agave syrup, and instead of milk I used freshly juiced carrots and apples.  All of the substitutes were 1 for 1, hence the mix was a bity runny, so I added a bit more flour, and the waffles were ohh so tasty and yummy, definetely making them again

This recipe really did make great tasting waffles. However, I gave it 4 stars because I came looking for something I could make just after stumbling out of bed (thus EASY), and this is NOT it. I suppose I should have really read the instructions before attempting it, so it's kind of my fault.  They really are delicious, but easy they are not.

I blame my $10 waffle iron, but they didn't cook up very well, so I used the batter on the griddle to make pancakes. They turned out great! What a treat.

Loved these waffles. The lemon zest gives it a great twist and is perfect with some jam or syrup. The process is a little long especially when i'm half awake trying to make them for my starving family but in the end, it is definitely worth it. De-lish:)

Although I prefer for myself making a pumpkin-wholewheat-flax waffle recipe, I know my family loves waffles made with white flour...so I decided to try this recipe out since I liked the idea of using lemon zest & vanilla.  I used less lemon zest then the recipe suggested and added in a tsp of ground cinnamon.  Everyone enjoyed them and next time I may even try using orange zest.

Yummy flavor. They didn't get truly crispy on the setting I usually use and they required spraying the waffle iron after each waffle to avoid sticking. I didn't have lemons so I used 1/4 tsp orange zest. Worked for me. I don't think I will use this lesser amount of lemon next time I make these.

After mixing all the ingredients I was a little worried beacause it seemed runny to me. But this recipe turned out awesome. Very good. I skipped the lemon zest because I was adding in chocolate chips. Best chocolate chip waffles ever.

This is my first time making waffles with my new waffle iron and these were simple and good! I didn't add the lemon but added a little more vanilla. My fiance said "these are better than the frozen ones!" lol and they really are!! Give 'em a try. Kid friendly too!

great recipe! sometimes my lady an' me like to add a little orange zest as well.  For a healthy spin, we will include rice bran in the flour mixture & just as the batter's poured on the iron, toss a small hand full of raw oats on there and crushed nuts!  If you're also so inclined skip the orange zest and pour some gran marnier in your liquid mix before you blend, whooh!

I loved this waffle. It was light, slightly sweet but the best part, the adding of lemon zest set these waffles apart from others I have eaten. I will definitely make these often.

Great waffle recipe! 
A little bit of work involved with whipping the egg whites, which need to be whipped to a consistency like whipped cream or the batter will be runny. But, all this can easily be done by hand with a whisk in the time it takes to preheat the waffle iron. I
I was surprised that the serving size was spot on. My waffle iron makes 2 square waffles at a time (which we consider a serving).

We loved these!  A little extra work with beating the egg whites but it added to the crispy texture.  I skipped the rind and used only vanilla extract. Very nice flavor.  Will make again.

These are so good, I added a little cornstarch for crispness and added more flour to make them Belgium style. The kids devoured them. I don't like waffles and I loved every bite.

Love trying new recipes and love lemon.  However, I used 1tbls  and it was still way too much.  When making them again I would either omit it or use maybe a teaspoon.  Something you would have to play with to make them to your liking.  Other than that I would make them again.

I've tried about 6 different recipes for waffles after purchasing my waffle iron to entice my picky 2 year old. 

Well I have to say this is the best recipe that received thumbs up from both my little guy and my husband. 

I did end up using orange and lemon zest instead of lemon zest as I didn't have enough lemon zest to cover off 2 table spoons. I think I'll continue using the orange lemon mix in the future!

Thank you for sharing this recipe Cooking Mom!

I've made these waffles several times without the lemon zest since we don't usually have lemons on hand & they are very good without.  Made them with the lemon zest for the first time this morning & they were absolutely amazing. The only negative thing my husband said is that they were a bit too sweet for him, but that was probably because I was using lactose free milk which is a bit sweeter than regular so I'll just cut some of the sugar next time.

Wow! These were great. Let me start by saying that I almost didn't want to make this recipe because of the extra dishes (my "standby" recipe uses just one mixing bowl). The extra effort produced amazing results. 

I also made some serious blunders. I dropped some yolk into my whites. I also only had 2 1/2 tbsp of butter. Despite this, my end results were still 5 stars! My waffles were crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside.

Did I mention they smelled amazing while cooking?

These are great!  I only give it 4 stars because it isn't quite as easy as the title suggests.  I did make half of the flour be wheat flour.  Very filling!  The note that says this recipe makes 4 waffles is correct- but they are 4 true belgian waffles- like you would get at a restaurant.

I loved this recipe.  I ran out of milk so I used a combination of 2% Lactaid- about 3/4c, 1/2c whole milk and 1/4c heavy cream.  We had oranges on hand so I used orange zest instead.  YUM- YUM!!
Very easy to make- and the list of dry ingredients separated from the wet helped me be more aware of the steps.

Awesome waffles!!! I've tried many a waffle mixes in my day and this is by far the best and easiest receipe I've come across. Nothing I can say can explain how good this receipe is, you just have to try for yourself. 

I didn't have any lemons the morning I made this receipe but I did use orange zest and it worked out perfect. I also used half the amount of butter simply because I'm trying to cut down on that kinda of stuff.  All I can say follow the directions exactly and you will not be disappointed, garanteed!!  ENJOY!

These are delicious.  The only thing I did was add some lemon zest and it made them taste so fresh!  Great with powdered sugar.  (4 star rating is for original recipe, I would give 5 stars if including the lemon zest)

made these waffles one morning and froze half the batter for next time. they came out as good as the first batch, which is to say incredibly delicious. this recipe will be a mainstay for years to come.  p.s. they are also just as good with warm honey as with syrup!!

PERFECT! This recipe is easy and quick, resulting in yummy goodness. Kids committed they were better than a restaurant. We had them for dinner one night. I’m going to mix ahead the dry ingredients and store in an air tight container. I’m sure it won’t last long.

I was looking for a waffle recipe I could alter to add coconut and macadamia nut flavors. I was trying to mimic a "to die for" breakfast we had in Hawaii.  I made the recipe as stated only substituting 1 cup of regular milk with coconut milk and omitting the lemon.  They turned out wonderful!  Light and fluffy with a hint of coconut.  We topped them with chopped macadamia nuts, shredded coconut, and coconut syrup. I highly recommend this recipe.  It will be my go to for waffles from now on.

These is a terrific waffle recipe, however I recommend not using the standard butter and maple syrup as a topping. The lemon and vanilla give it a wonderful and unique flavor. We made them in a waffle iron that was made to make 'waffle sticks". I used a simple topping by spreading butter into the waffle holes and springling powdered sugar on top. Delicious!

I realize I'm very alone in this, but we did not enjoy these waffles.  Too dense and thick for us.  The flavor was very nice, but other than that, they just weren't good.  My kids just nibbled at them.  Perhaps I did something wrong..but I'm a fairly accomplished cook and followed the recipe to the letter so I'm not sure what I could have missed.

I'm usually a little apprehensive of using lemon in my recipes. I decided to go ahead and try this one. I didn't have enough zest, so I squeezed some of the lemon juice in to compensate. These waffles were fantastic! Everyone loved them...even my kids! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I have made this twice now. The first time the kids complained about the excessive lemon zest (though they still loved it!) The second time I cut the zest in half and everyone adored it! This may be found insulting by some, but definitely comparable to Waffle House waffles - sorry, they make darn good waffles! :)

Great recipe - worth the extra step of frothing the egg whites! These came out light and airy on the inside, crispy on the outside. My only complaint was my fault - they didn't have a lot of flavor but I didn't have any lemon zest so left it out.. I bet that would have made them divine!

There are simpler recipes but these waffles turn out wonderful and worth the little extra effort. I use a old fashioned waffle iron on the stove top and they come out great.

Very dense and soft waffles. These were easy to make but uses a lot of bowls. The batter is very very thin and for a brown waffle you need to keep it in the iron for a while to get a golden waffle. Otherwise it is a pale rubbery waffle. Better off using Bisquick for quick waffles.

Not awful if chewy is what u want.  Made exact then adjusted twice more... final result was same ingredients, 2 whipped eggs in magic bullet and fold into everything else as stated in recipe.  U dont need the 2 extra yolks which weigh it down.   U could also do 4 tbsp of butter instead of 6.  Third time i added brown sugar instead of white and doubled vanilla.  These changes in 3rd attempt produced a light fluffy non chewy waffle with subtle hint of vanilla that went well with syrup, whipped cream and berries.  Sometimes less is more.  Also wasnt into the lemon zest.  I love lemon but in this recipe it wasnt for me.

These are by far the BEST waffles I have ever made or eaten.  They are very light and flavorful, I believe thanks to the whipped egg whites and lemon zest.  
Make sure, while you are at it to bake the entire recipe and freeze any leftovers to toast for another time.  Well worth “making from scratch”!

This was the first time making waffles, and the batter was extremely easy/quick to make.  

I reduced the butter to two tablespoons to reduce the amount of fat.  The waffles still came out perfect.  

Also, instead of lemon zest, I used about a tablespoon of lemon juice.  It added just the right amount of "sour" to the batter to complement the salt and sugar.

Made these this morning and they were great! Only thing I did different was added a little nutmeg with the vanilla and didn't add the lemon zest.  I also added a extra half cup of flour.

These were excellent - virtually as good as Belgian waffles  and so much quicker to make. Crispy on the outside and very soft and tender on the inside. I might cut down on the lemon zest next time, but if you like a wafflle with a hint of lemon then you will love them.

I definitely wouldn't label this recipe "easy". I was out of my normal baking mix & I was happy this only called for basic ingredients that I had on hand. (I omitted the lemon zest). It was a tasty waffle, but there are more steps required for this recipe than for standard waffle recipes.

My family loved these waffles! They turned out thick and fluffy and had a delicious flavor to them. I made a few little changes, I omitted the lemon zest, just because my family doesn't have such a refined palette, and instead of 2 tbsp sugar, I added 3 tbsp. I also only added 1-1/2 cups of milk  because I like my batter to be a little thicker and not so runny. And that was it, they were delicious!!!!

Delicious.  Kids loved them.  

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I substituted two tlbs of butter with vegetable oil.  I do this, because I've found this adds a little crispness to the outside of the waffle.
I didn't have enough lemon for 2 tlbs of zest.  Even so, the lemon zest really added a great dimension to what otherwise would be a pretty standard waffle.

They cooked light and crispy on the outside with a  custardy inside.  

Keeper.

Followed directions exactly.  Turned out great. The batter seemed very "flat". I was worried they would turn out that way.  They did not! They were fluffy and Delicious.

These are by far the best waffles I've ever made!!  I added a bit of the fresh lemon juice to the batter which makes it a little more lemony in flavor.  Delicious!!!

This is our go to recipe for waffles. We make a double batch on New Years Day to serve sleepover party guests. It doubles well!

I almost never add the lemon zest, it is great without it. Otherwise I make it as described. 

I also tend to add extras for flavoured waffles. I have added chocolate chips, pecans, butterscotch chips, walnuts, the lost goes on, the batter worked well with everything.

One last note. When everyone is full, I use the remaining batter and freeze the prepared waffles . They reheat easily in the toaster and are just as delicious later!

This is my family's favorite waffle recipe. My eight year old daughter loves the hint of lemon. I was out of vanilla so I used almond extract. We freeze the left overs and the kids enjoy re-warming the waffels on their own in the toaster.

The flavor isn't bad, but they were too soft. If I wanted soft I would have made pancakes. As a matter of fact these are just like pancakes. Literally turned to mush.

This was a great recipe! I did however add 1 whole tsp of salt instead of 1/2, and use lime zest instead of lemon. They were perfect, my family was ooo'ing and aaah'ing.

I made this recipe as written except for whipping the egg whites to stiffer peaks. Everything was great, but waffles remained somewhat soft. However we froze the rest of this generous recipe amount and just popped them in the toaster on busy mornings and they turned out just fine.

I wanted a crisp waffle recipe and tried many recipes, picking from the top chefs websites.  No success.  My 11 year old granddaughter picked this recipe for my birthday breakfast.  Best recipe and ever and I have used it many times since.  Perfect recipe!

Very good recipe! I bought a waffle maker as a Christmas present to my family, because we love making waffles each time we stay in a hotel overnight.  We used it for the first time today, along with this recipe, and it was great.  Thanks for sharing your family's recipe with us!

Whipping the egg whites is worth the extra 3 minutes. Good with or without lemon zest. If you forgo the Lemon zest. Try some Cinnamon (1/2 to 1 tsp. ) made 6 belgian waffles. My family loves these! 
Im going to try the savory route as well and add some herbs. Definitely a recipe to write down in the cook book!

This recipe is great! I followed the proportions almost exactly, except for substituting buttermilk for regular milk. This substitution along with the lemon made for VERY tangy waffles, maybe a little too tangy. Next Time I may use half buttermilk half regular and only 1T lemon zest. That being said I did love these waffles and this will be my go to recipe!

The first time I made this I didn't have fresh lemon so I just used a bit of lemon juice.  The waffles were really flavorful and fluffy.  I have a belgian waffle maker so they weren't very crispy.  The second time I used the lemon zest and everyone liked them but thought the lemon was just a bit overpowering.  This is my favorite recipe and i'll just be reduce the lemon zest by 1/2.

These were pretty awful. The waffles come out chewy despite my effort to minimize the initial mix and to gently fold in the egg whites. There also isn't any fat listed in the recipe, I wonder if that might help the issue. I was overwhelming and not properly balanced in the recipe.  Neither my husband or I enjoyed these but our 4yo still ate 'em up so they're not a total waste.

super easy to make and got rave reviews by my boys - even my picky 8 year old.  Will absolutely become a weekend staple.

I agree, this is a fantastic recipe!  I substituted Christmas  Eggnog for the milk and Orange Zest for lemon.  They smell fantastic with the extra spices of the eggnog.  My PICKY eater husband liked them so much I made a double batch and froze them!  Perfect in the morning out of the toaster!

WOW! great waffle recipe..I've made them twice the first time without lemon the second time with it and it makes a huge difference, the difference between good and amazing! I put some lemon zest but mostly lemon juice, some of the best waffles I've ever had. Also added cinnamon :)
