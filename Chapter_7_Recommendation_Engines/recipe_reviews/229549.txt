I love these! Instead of 2.5c water and .5c lime juice, I do half water, half Cuervo margarita mix (or make up the 3 cups total to taste). Put them in a shallow pan and slice em up when they are ready. Fun to put in martini or margarita glasses with a salt rim.  Another great recipe is for green apple jello. Use two parts water, one part vodka and one part green apple schnapps. (Can do the same for watermelon, etc.) Yum! Remember you always need hot water to dissolve the sugar in, so you can't replace too much of it with mixers or liquor. Enjoy....and call your guests a cab!! :) Thanks Jarf!

I love jello shots, but hate little cups!
I added in an envelope of unflavored knox gelatin to this recipe to firm it up so that it could be made "jiggler" style in an 8"x8" pan sprayed with a little non-stick spray. Otherwise, I made as directed.
These really do taste just like a margarita. If you want you can even sprinkle a tiny bit of coarse salt or sugar on top just before you eat it. The author is right, they are strong and taste great, so BE CAREFUL not to have too many! :)
