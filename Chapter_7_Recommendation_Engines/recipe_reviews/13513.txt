This soup is awesome!  Pure comfort food.  I made this using the Thanksgiving turkey carcass.  I pressed a few (4 or 5) large cloves of garlic while making the broth.  I omitted the rutabega, added 5 small potatoes,added some fresh basil I had on hand for another recipe, and added a bit of salt.  The flour/milk mixture makes a nice creamy broth.  I do not have a food processor, therefore I used another recipe I had for the dumplings.  Will definately be making this recipe again and again!  Thanks Christine...

I had to cook the soup for quite a bit longer than the recipie recommended to get the dumplings cooked.  After this, the soup and the dumplings were quite good.  I also found that after allowing the mixture to thicken in the refrigerator overnight, it made a most delicious stew for dinner the next evening.

Great soup for leftover turkey.  I didn't make the dumplings and omitted the rutabaga (whatever that is??)  I used more bouillon probably 6 cubes or so.  Came out really great!!Freezes great too!

Incredibly delicious soup Christine! I cheated and made the dumplings with Bisquik and added a few more seasonings. Perfect dinner on this windy and very rainy night. Thanks so much!

This was the best recipe for turkey soup I have ever come across, it was just delicous.  I followed the directions exactly with exception to the addition of potatoes and I removed the rutabaga.  I did make the parsley dumplings but both DH and I didn't really care for them, they are very gummy and heavy in texture and there isn't a lot of flavour.  I don't believe I will ever use another turkey soup recipe, but I will likely not make the dumplings again.  **EDIT** I just wanted to add that this soup is even better the next day and the dumplings, while still a little on the heavy side, taste MUCH better!

This is a delicious recipe.  I don't know why everyone skips the rutabaga.  They're so sweet and delicous, a nice taste that falls between carrot and potato. I cooked my dumplings the standard way, 10 minutes uncovered and then 10 minutes covered.  That's the best, for a light fluffy dumpling, cooked all the way through.  The 12 minutes recommended here doesn't work.

Our Thanksgiving turkey was a little overcooked this year so I thought this recipe would be perfect to bring a little moisture to the meat. I used 8 cups of organic chicken broth (msg free!) instead of the bouillon and reduced the water to 4 cups. I added a little extra celery & onion to the broth while it was cooking. My local grocery was out of rutabaga so I substituted 2 golden potatoes. 12 min. was perfect for the dumplings.. thou I imagine it would depend on how big you make them.  Mine were a little smaller than a golf ball but grew to twice that big in the pot. I also threw in a half cup of wild rice to the mix which was wonderful, but make sure to add more water or broth to the pot if you do.

I'm giving it only 4 stars because I followed the directions exactly and the dumplings came out too mushy. It could of been my mistake, but I think it may just be the recipe.

Really yummy!! Will cook the dumplings longer next time and follow another reviewer's suggestion for cooking 10 minutes without cover and 10 with cover. Didn't have rutabaga but substituted leftover boiled potatoes instead. Will try rutabaga next time.

This soup turned out great.  I already had turkey stock so I skipped to the second part.  I only had wheat bread & used that instead of white bread for the dumplings - they turned out GREAT!  It was my husband's favorite part.  The dumplings do need to cook a bit longer(depending on the size)- I'll plan for that next time.  Overall a great recipe.

Delicious..even the skeptics in the family, once they tasted it, enjoyed and went back for seconds. One bit of advice - the flour/milk mixture NEEDS to be strained while adding it to the stock...otherwise, you'll have pasty lumps to explain..giggle...(learned from experience)!

This soup was sooooo good. I too used potatoes instead of rutabaga and egg noodles instead of the dumplings. Be careful not to let it simmer too long like I did, otherwise the noodles will suck up all of the liquid. Even with the reduced amount of soup, it turned out great!

What a fantastic recipe.My family loved it and I have very picky children. I didn't try the dumplings and I substituted the rutabaga for potato. We used a free range fresh turkey and there was no fat or greasey texture like with some soups.  It was awesome!

I used this recipe as a base for my Xmas dinner leftovers. I didn't make the parsley dumplings. I used a few small shallots instead of the onion, extra celery and left out the carrots because I didn't have any. Instead of tossing away the veggies after making the stock, I picked through and re-added them to the broth. This where things changed- I used extra turkey, added leftover cheesy creamed spinach (roughly 1 cup) and instead of just one rutabaga I added the leftovers of mashed potato-rutabaga w/caramelized onion casserole. Seasoned to taste. End was result was a nice, thick, stew.

Whenever I make stock, I insert a metal colander into the water and and put my bones, skin, bay leaf and anything else I will need to fish out later.  I cook all the veggies at the same time placing them underneath in the to keep section.  Saves time and all that straining business.

Great recipe, took much longer for us, because we doubled it because of the large turkey carcass, but it was a good lazy day to do it. I would add more chicken bouillon as one other user noted, I put in 4 cubes. We didn't have a rutabaga, so just used potatoes.  Our dumplings were too big, so be careful not to do that like we did.  All in all - GREAT recipe.

This soup was excellent!  It took some time because I wanted to let the stock cool to get the fat off.  It was very good.  I used a different method to make the dumplings because I don't have a food processor.  My husband loved this soup!

The soup was good, but didn't like the dumplings due to a too gummy texture caused by the bread. I will find another dumpling recipe and use this recipe for the soup. I also think wide egg noodles would be excellent in it instead for the time being.

Great recipe for a snowy day.  I did not include the rutabaga (didn't have any), but the soup came out great anyway.  The real reason for the five stars is the parsley dumplings.  Everyone was fighting over who got the last ones!

This is my standard recipe for after Thanksgiving. I never ate rutabagas before and this made me a fan! The dumplings make it pure comfort food- and the smell while it is cooking is out of this world! Yum!

This stuff was great. I also used potato in place of rutabaga (because it was what I had on hand) and I did't have time to try the dumplings. But altogether it was very good. Thanks!

Dumplings ruined my soup. They weren’t cooked enough even after 15 min and they fell apart and made my soup creamy. So disappointed! I’ve tried recipes with baking powder and something like this always happened. Oh how I wished this was going to be the one! I will only use my mothers & her mother’s recipe in the future. Theirs was a chewy dumpling but it’s not undercooked and is simply egg, flour, soup broth, butter , parsley & a hint of nutmeg. (I’ll post in future) My hubby’s not a big fan so I searched for an alternative. Oh well.

Yummy.  It's very pretty with lots of color.

I didn't have a carcass so I simply put meat in and more bullion.

This is the BEST turkey soup I have ever had! You know it is good when my 2 picky kids and extremely picky husband all LOVED it! I also added about 5-6 crushed garlic cloves to the broth. I added potatoes instead of rutabaga and used Bisquick for dumplings. Big hit in this house. Can't wait to have it again for dinner tomorrow!!!
