I really wanted to like this, but this simply doesn't make what it says it does. First off 3 under ripened peaches to 1 cup of wine that is reduced is going to produce wine soaked peaches. Even doubling the wine and spices didn't create any sort of sauce, it essentially created peaches in juice. The peach/riesling/nutmeg/cinnamon combo was great, however using the word sauce here is entirely misleading. Also, the pork only being seasoned with salt and pepper before going into the oven? This made a bland pork, which in all fairness I expected, but counted on the sauce to redeem the recipe. The flavors are on point, however this recipe is no where near a state of completion.

I absolutely loved this dish. This recipe is great for a beginner cook or if you are afraid to mingle with seasonings and spice. I definitely played around with the chops and seasoned to my likings and added ginger. As far as the sauce is concerned, I would not mix it with the tidbits from the pork. This causes the sauce to become salty. I would use a fresh pan and go from there. I used a cp of brown sugar instead of tbsp. And then let it caramel into a thick sauce.Peeled the peaches and diced. The leftover sauce can be used in the morning over frozen or fresh waffles.  Of course salt and pepper is going to be bland on anything esp. pork chops. Like all recipes sometimes they have to be tweaked. TRY IT! you just might be surprised!!:D

With another reviwer's suggestions, this turned out great! I used whole, canned peaches as they're not in season here yet. Diced and added the peaches near the end of cooking the sauce. In addition to the salt and pepper on the chops I used ginger. This didn't come through much, maybe I will use fresh, grated ginger rubbed onto the pork next time. Also, I think ground cloves and/or allspice would add depth to this dish. As for the wine I just used the white wine I had in the house. Very simple and bursting with flavour! Definitely going to make this again when peaches are in season for an even fresher taste.

I chose to modify this where I grilled it.  This was bursting with flavour! I think it's imperative to use a quality Riesling wine. The only other change I made was to marinate the pork chops, and I added 1 Tablespoon of minced garlic.

Wow!  My family chowed down on this!  I made it with a pork tenderloin roast in the crock pot and cooked it on low for almost 8 hours.  I just put everything in the crock at the same time and let it go.  I added ginger and more nutmeg since my family likes those flavors.   The pork had a delicious flavor and when I turned the juices into a thin gravy over rice ... it was amazing!  I cannot wait to make this again.

Please try this recipe as written.  It's an entree, not a dessert!  It's a great recipe for the summer when peaches are ripe.  I wanted to serve some of the sauce over rice, and it didn't make all that much, so I would double the amount if I made it again.  If you reduce the wine as the directions state, the sauce should be thick enough without adding cornstarch.  This dish goes together quickly, and it would be an easy yet elegant dish for guests.

A few changes. We used organic bone-in chops. I rubbed pressed garlic on chops and sprinkled with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and S&P, as suggested. Tasted perfectly! I did keep the yummy brown bits and used the same same pan. I also bumped up the brown sugar to a cup. I didn't measure the spices in the sauce, just went by taste. Boyfriend loved it and said to keep recipe; though it would be good over ice cream too! Liked something different than than my normal apples & chops recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe with a couple of changes.  I used a pork tenderloin, and added a sliced apple to the peaches then followed this recipe.  I also finished the tenderloin on the BBQ weapped in foil.  (great for summer and not heating up the kitchen).

I also used wine I had on hand and used sliced, canned peaches.  I agree that the "sauce" is not very thick, but the flavor was wonderful.  When I make this again, I will tweak it, perhaps thickening with cornstarch, but not much.  Also, I don't think flavoring the chops in the first stages is necessary as the sauce had enough flavor for us.  I served with biscuits and a simple veggie. Glad I tried it!

We loved this!  I used boneless pork chops about 3/4" thick.  I added a little ground ginger to the spices.  When I make this again I will cut back a little on the brown sugar, the peaches are so sweet on their own.  Also, I only brown the chops for about 2 minutes per side and bake for 20 minutes at 200 degrees.  The recipe was adjusted for 2 servings.

This was a huge hit with my family!  Was so easy to put together yet it tasted like I spent hours on it.  After reading other reviews, I did rub allspice on the pork chops before browning them to add more flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely be making this a lot!

I really WANTED to LOVE this, it sounded good.  I read all the other reviews and decided to try some of their ideas because I could see where if the chops were just seared and baked with the sauce poured over the flavors were not going to meld.  So I put the well seasoned and seared chops in a baking dish and poured the wine reduction and peaches over them and cooked until the chops were JUST done... and then set them aside and thickened the juices with some cornstarch and stirred in a pat of butter just for good measure.  If not for the sauce this would have had no flavor whatsoever, and even the sauce doesn't take it 'over the top'.  I used a good quality Riesling too, and fresh peaches from the farmer's market. Sorry Kristie, it was just too bland.  I would have enjoyed my peaches and wine more as sangria to drink along with some marinated and grilled pork chops.

Delish! Love the spicy-sweet peaches in wine. I followed the recipe but next time I would double the amount of sauce. I served the pork (boneless country ribs that where on sale) with brown rice and made a quick tangy vinegar cole slaw as a cold side dish. This made for a wonderful balance of sweet and tart which complimented the entire dish.
