Loved this!  Not as "krauty/sharp" as regular sauerkraut.  The onion gave it a little sweetness which reminded me of a Bavarian style kraut, which is what I prefer.  I made this a day ahead to let it sit overnight in the fridge...it got even better.  This is great hot or cold! Planning on using this on Reuben sandwiches tonight.  I had left over corned beef from last nights corned beef and cabbage...I'm willing to bet it's going to be the best Reuben I've ever had. This goes in the "keeper" column! Thanks onenikol!

I made this recipe, but I tweaked it a bit. I use apple cider vinegar instead of white, and sprinkle just a little sugar in. My husband is not usually a sauerkraut lover, but he absolutely LOVED this recipe. I after I cook the kraut, I bake it at 350 w brats or kielbasa, and the tiny red potatos if I have them. Hubby makes requests for this dish at least every couple of weeks. I love that he enjoys my cooking ! :)

Very tasty! As a few others I did not have celery seed (and was at the super market earlier too, shoot!). So I substituted mustard seed. Then everything also per instructions. Came out great. Looking forward to the many dishes I'll use it with. Sausages, sandwiches, egg scramble. Can't wait to share with friends tomorrow. Definitely a keeper and will make over and over again. But first, headed back to the pot with my tasting spoon.

I have never made sauerkraut before, so I tried this. Reading the other reviews, I thought I'd make it more flavorful by adding my own touches. Don't do what I did! I added an extra half cup of vinegar and a quarter cup of water because I used a huge head of cabbage plus a minced jalapeno, 1/2 red pepper, and a whole onion. I also added a tsp. of whole caraway seeds (probably a good idea) and 1/2 tsp. of mustard seed (BAD idea) and a whole tsp. of celery seed. (probably okay) and a whole tsp. of onion powder (probably okay). The mustard seed and extra vinegar kind of ruined it (it tastes like pickled cabbage) but otherwise it would have been really fabulous. I added some extra water and simmered it extra long so hopefully it will mellow out a bit. It is way too sour with the amount of vinegar I used.

Perfect! Has those onions in it as well which I think makes it that much better! Love the extra spices, find other recipes way to bland! Good job!

5 stars because of the ease of making this and the taste!  If I knew it was this easy to make sauerkraut I would have done it years ago.   Thank you for the recipe.   I did use apple cider vinegar and I only had onion salt, not powder, but it's still delicious.

Decided to try this rather than  make the time consuming  effort to ferment cabbage for a week. Glad I did because this produces very good Sauerkraut very quickly. Far better than store bought. I did not tamper with the recipe, except to add carrots,  but probably will do so in the future. Plan to try different vinegar and whole caraway/mustard seed.

SOOOO GOOD!! made a few adjustments, but such a quick amazing base recipe. Added mustard seed, chili flake, extra salt & dill seed. Used celery salt because we had no celery seed. Used Champagne vinegar instead of Distilled white. Twice as much spice as recommended.

Really good! I will say though, I started with jarred Bubbie's sauerkraut from whole foods. I only used half the ingredients and it was still good. I used celery seed, ground black pepper, garlic powder, dried minced onion and apple cider vinegar. Just warmed in a pot on the stove. I was using this to mix with mashed potatoes.

I made this on a whim one night to go with some amazing sausages. I tasted as I cooked and made a few changes; 1. I cooked longer than the recipe calls for. 2. I added more vinegar and a little apple cider vinegar to achieve desired tartness ( sourness?). This is our go to sauerkraut recipe now.

I made no changes. Not enough whang. Not cooked enough, although I cooked it 15 minutes. (The cabbage made a squeaky sound when I chewed it.) Not salty enough. So, I am cooking it some more, added more salt, and added more vinegar.

No changes to recipe.  

It was easy to make but not super delicious.  
For me the taste  is off. It tastes kind of sweet but you can clearly taste the onion powder.  It is edible just not delicious.  I would not make this again . ~ My mom loves sauerkraut and said it made the house smell really bad.

I'm not a big sauerkraut fan so I made this more for my husband than myself.    It was quick and easy to make without the weeks of waiting and did have good flavor.   I will most likely use this recipe again when making a meal that requires sauerkraut.

Not bad for a quick kraut.  I would have liked a little more kick, so maybe I would either increase the vinegar and decrease the water, or maybe sub in some cider vinegar for the white.

I used a little less vinegar and skipped the onion powder in liue of extra onion.  I cooked it up in my 5qt cast iron Dutch Oven pot, so, instead of keeping the high heat, as soon the liquid came to a boil, I turned it to low to simmer.  

It was amazing with some sausage and potatoes.

this was the best sauerkraut ever, much better than the store bought stuff. had it on corned beef sandwiches, with thousand island dressing. wow great. I ate it out of the bowl. very easy to make, fast and easy. I did add 1 teaspoon of sugar and some caraway seed. will make often

I had to wing it a tad, I cooked an 18 pound head of cabbage.  It tasted amazing, reminded me of the sauerkraut I had growing up at a Bohemian restaurant

I forgot the sauerkraut when I was at the store but had cabbage so looked this up. It was easy, cooked in no time and I like it more than the the store bought! As someone else mentioned it does taste more the Bavarian style which I also prefer.

I rarely eat sauerkraut, but thought this was simple and good.  I did add sugar, and used powder mustard instead of the celery salt.  I sautéed the cabbage a bit before adding the vinegar/water mixture.  made me crave some sausage.

Hubby loved it! I didn't have celery seed so substituted with fennel. Very tasty. Paired with some Weisswurt and steamed potatoes. Prost!

We love this recipe! it is so easy to make and all I had was red onion which worked out just great! Won't buy store-bought sauerkraut anymore.
