Fiery Red Salsa  Haiku: "Oh yea, fiery! I mean, I like spicy food, but this? Pass the milk!" I halved the recipe and used one medium jalapeno, and maybe I just happened upon a freakishly-spicy pepper, b/c this salsa was crazy hot. That's not to say that we didn't like it, b/c I'm a sucker for an easy blender salsa w/ the perfect ingredients as this one has. Maybe a little more lime juice, a little less jalapeno next time for me. :-)
