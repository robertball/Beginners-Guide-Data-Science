Our favourite with 2 modifications to suit our taste. Use 4 cloves of minced garlic, and switch the measurement of basalmic vinegar and maple syrup. I have made this at least 15 times. We love, love it. Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe Group Selection:  17, May 2014 ~ My husband and I really enjoyed this dressing.  I started with a half-batch to see if we would like it.  We did, and that small portion disappeared quickly, so I made another half batch.  We love the taste of balsamic vinegar and liked that you could detect the flavor in this dressing.  For us, this was a hit and I will be making it again.  Thanks, GrammaBeni for sharing your recipe.

I had such high hopes for liking this recipe.  I made 1/2 of the recipe and followed the instructions exactly as written.  The dressing was dark, sweet, thick and creamy but the aftertaste of garlic was just too overpowering. I may try it again and use less fresh garlic. Thank you for sharing your recipe GrammaBeni. This was the AR Buzz Recipe Group Selection for the week of May 17, 2014.

RECIPE GROUP: We enjoyed this very much. I used garlic powder (about 1/4 tsp for a half batch) but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I would say a half recipe would cover 4 or 5 bowls of salad if you like it pretty saucy!

This was amazing!  We live in maple syrup country so i used what is called a dark amber syrup and this had such a strong complex flavor that was delicious.  Had it over field greens with grilled steak on top of it. Wonderful dressing!

This was delicious! Just the right blend of sweet and sharp for us. I wouldn't change a single thing. It was easy-peasy in the food processor.
Later review: Oh my goodness! This has become our new favourite salad dressing. It is sooooooo good!!! I do use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic simply because I think it might keep longer than with the fresh garlic. And don't think you can shake it up in the bottle like some other dressings. If you do that it won't thicken properly. Make sure you stream the olive oil in while blending like the recipe directs. Get your mouth ready for a big treat here! Lots of flavour! It would make a great sauce or marinade for fish or chicken. Tonight I used it to dip my leftover roast beef into when I didn't feel like using ketchup. Ooo la la!

Great with berries, mixed lettuce, nuts, and feta.  I made no changes to the dressing recipe. Perfect as written. Picky kids actually ate their salad first!   A go to for summer salads.

Recipe Group 5/17,2014 - This is a recipe I will keep on file because it is different and would be a good thing to take when you think everyone is bringing the same thing.  I made 1/4 of the recipe because I was not sure how well I would like it.  I am glad I did not make more, it is too much of a good thing.  Too much balsamic vinegar, too much maple.  I might use less of each when I make it again.

I served it to a lunch gathering and everyone loved it. Some  used it as a sauce with their baked chicken. This dressing is something I will make again!

A little sweet and not too zippy. This is really good with a salad of apples, walnuts and lettuce.

Delicious. Only thing I didn't have was powdered mustard so I used a tsp of Dijon mustard instead. When I tasted it straight out of the blender, it did have a bite from the raw garlic, but when I put it on the salad, it was fine. I made a fall salad with baby kale,/spinach/ chard, roasted carrots, pumpkin seeds, cranberries, apples, and blue cheese.

Iâ€™ve made this twice and it was superb both times! We eat a lot of salads so I doubled the recipe this time and it blended beautifully. I think the secret to success is to use high quality ingredients, especially for the maple syrup. We are lucky to live close to Mennonite country where real maple syrup is easy to find. This is a keeper!

One of my favorites!  Try on a salad with salmon and pecans.  I do substitute a squirt of dijon and fresh basil, otherwise, follow the exact recipe.  Thanks for a great one, GrammBeni!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this salad dressing. I used some pure Vermont maple syrup and my dressing dark color was from the balsamic vinegar I used. I may have added a little more lemon juice because I juiced a small lemon. I would make this again.

I love this recipe. I needed a low/no sodium dressing and found this recipe. You don't miss the salt with all the flavor. I use it for salads, pasta and chicken. It is always in my refrigerator. My most recent batch had a shallot instead of garlic. Delicious!  I'm sure I'll be tweaking this base recipe in the future. Thanks for sharing!

I used this salad dressing recipe for a large tossed salad. The salad had lots of fruits as well as some veggies. I needed gluten free for a guest and this worked well. Dressing was easy to make. Followed the recipe as written. Delicious. Had requests from guests for the recipe.

I tasted a similar dressing while visiting Vermont last month.  I loved it.  I hoped this recipe might duplicate that in some way.  It did, indeed.  It is easy and amazingly delicious!  Use real maple syrup.  It is wonderful on spinach salad, arugula, kale, or even shredded green cabbage.

I had this salad dressing in Vermont when visiting and couldn't find a recipe for it. This dressing is fantastic! Great with a spinach and romaine mix. Thank you.
