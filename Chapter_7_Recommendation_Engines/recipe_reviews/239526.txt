I made this the other day for a pi day celebration, and it was delicious- extremely moist with great flavor.  It actually was enough to fill two non-deep-dish pie plates.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

I used real milk &  3/4 real sugar (more sugar because of the other reviews) plus 1 tsp. of coconut flavoring.  Absolutely moist and  chocolately!   It sat in the fridge for only 2 hours and was perfect texture.   Our semi-gluten-free friend took the rest home with the recipe!!

Absolutely disgusting. Probably the worst thing I have ever eaten. It's bad. It looks like mud and tastes like mud. I cannot stomach this thing.

This sounds delicious but again...I hate recipes that are less than accurate.  When you say coconut milk, are you referring to the milk that comes out of the top of can without stirring it into the thicker coconut? Or are you talking about the milk-substitute kind of coconut milk?  Please be more specific with your recipes.

Made no substitutions - I felt it need added sweetness and the texture (even though I under-baked it by 5 minutes intentionally) wasn't perfectly smooth and the pie seemed dry.  The best thing I can say is that it was gluten free.  I dressed it up with chocolate sauce and homemade gelato. I wouldn't make this one again, though.
