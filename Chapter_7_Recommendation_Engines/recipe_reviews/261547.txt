Delicious and very simple to make!  I nuked the potatoes for 4.5 minutes in the microwave to speed everything up, and the meal was on the table in less than 1/2 an hour.  I used soy chorizo, as it's the only type my grocer had, and added a bit more olive oil for cooking because of that - and it worked perfectly.  Husband said he's having the leftovers for lunch!  I will definitely make this one again.

I was a little leery of the amount of chorizo and unsure of the potato but I always make the recipe as presented first before making my own adjustments the second time.  But, I loved this recipe just as it is!  However, I may have to adjust the amount of chorizo to half chorizo and half regular pork sausage to cut the heat down for my husband.  I especially like the potato.

EAsy and delicious, my  hubby thoroughly enjoyed it. I made tacos and breakfast burritos. Only thing I added was avocado slices and tapatio sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

Make sure you put plenty of seasoning in the potatoes and salsa is definitely needed to bring it all together. With that in mind, it was very good and I would certainly make it again.
