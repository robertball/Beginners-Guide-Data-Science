I stumbled upon a Vanilla Extract recipe years ago and have always wanted to try it; most recipes seem very similar to one another. I used a 1.75 liter bottle of Svedka and 25 Madagascar Vanilla Beans that I purchased from Beanilla along with some small bottles to bottle my extract for gift giving. The beans were very plump and seemed to be very nice quality. I split them and scraped out the seeds and placed seeds and beans into the 1.75 liter bottle of Vodka to age for 3 months, stored it in a dark area and gave it a little shake about once a week. After it aged for 3 months, I filtered it through a gold coffee filter to separate the seeds and bean fibers from the liquid, Don’t discard the beans, save them to place into the individual bottles. Gold coffee filters can be found at Walmart for about $5, they are very fine and make an excellent filter and they don’t absorb the extract. I placed one vanilla bean into each bottle so that it will continue to strengthen in the months to come. Used a small funnel to fill each individual bottle, added my custom labels, a gift tag and bow and I have a wonderful little gift to give to family and friends. I filled 10, 4 oz bottles and 1, 8 oz bottle and had about a cup of extract left over that I saved for myself. I would recommend using a 4 oz bottle; it seemed the perfect size for gift giving.

I love the idea of making my own vanilla, and now that I've done it, I will never buy vanilla again.  HOWEVER, after substantial reading across a number of site, this has too few vanilla beans in it to reach the desired alcohol content to technically be vanilla extract.  You also need the beans to sit in there a full 6 months for this ratio to be reached.  For 1L of vodka, you will want 1/4 lb beans.  But you can get a quarter pound on ebay for cheap (~$12).  Also, buy the grade B beans, those are extract beans.  Grade A won't give you as much flavor.

I started making my own pure vanilla using this method. It's wonderful! I use only vodka (tried rum once, didn't care for the result). You can just cut the vanilla beans into thirds and slip them into the vodka; shake several times weekly and notice the color changing. As stated, the minimum time is weeks, but leave it as long as you can... months would be preferable. My guideline is once I can't smell the alcohol, it's pretty much ready. Homemade vanilla can take on a bit of a cloudy appearance, so don't be alarmed. You can strain a little of it at a time into a smaller bottle using a coffee filter, and let the rest hang out and get even stronger and better.

I've been making vanilla extracts and sugars for many years. Here are a few tips:  You want to purchase the grade B beans not because they are cheaper (which they are) but because they have a lower water content.  That is the grade used commercially.  By splitting your beans, or snipping into small bits, you expose more surface area, which makes a better extract.  Commercial V.E. is macerated.  Since my big pantry bottle of extract contains lots of chopped beans, I strain what I need into a smaller bottle for my cupboard, and for gifts.  Don't be afraid to add more beans. I prefer a double-strength extract myself.  When your extract runs low; no need to toss your beans out.  You can continue to use them by adding more vodka and beans to the existing batch if desired.  If you feel your vanilla extract is too weak, just add a few more beans (the drier grade B beans).    Go ahead and experiment.  Madagascar a.k.a. Bourbon beans provide the traditional vanilla scent you are probably expecting.  Tahitian vanilla beans are softer and more floral.  Mexican vanilla extract pairs very well with chocolate.    Hope that was helpful!  Want to learn more?  Search Wikipedia, or check out the FDA quidelines for making commercial extracts which are posted online fda_dot_gov.

I used about 8 pods split lengthwise in a bottle of Smirnoff exactly like the one in the picture (I think it is 750 ml).  After 3 weeks it is so dark you have to hold it up to the light to see the pods inside.  It smells wonderful, just slightest smell of Vodka left but I don’t think it will be there much longer.  I have to try very hard to wait until it is ready before I try it.  I will be putting it though a coffee filter to get all the seeds and stuff out.  I read that if you dry out the pods when you are done and add them to a plastic bag with sugar it will flavor the sugar, good for baking and decorating cookies and cakes.  I will be trying that when my vanilla is done.

I recently decided to make my own vanilla extract for gifts and resale (I want to start a business someday and am experimenting with some of the products I will carry).  I have read a lot about the proper way to make it and cam across a site that states requirements (by the FDA) of vanilla extract.  Apparently, it needs to be 6 beans per cup of alcohol, and anything less than that is just flavored liquor.  Since I'll be selling mine eventually, this is the ratio I will go by.  Also, it technically needs to be 70 proof (35%) alcohol.

This is the best way to make your own vanilla extract! Don't buy those little expensive bottles in the grocery store. Make your own!  So much cheaper. I bought twelve 8 inch long vanilla beans on ebay for 99 cents and had enough to share with everybody in my family!  Just slice the bean, put it in the vodka and sit it in your cabinet.  They say vanilla is a sexual aphrodisiac. I believe it, after a month, I uncorked the bottle to smell it and good lord, talk about a heavenly smell.  Make your own, you will know what is in it, how fresh it is and it will make you feel good that you are making your own homemade products for your family.  I will never go back to buying my own extract ever again. This was too easy and fun to do !

My 6 months are finally up!  This worked SO WELL!  I made 2 kinds - vodka and bourbon.  Lvu 'em both!  So-long store bought!  See ya! ***update***  I have added to my stash and find that I prefer the bourbon to the vodka.  I now use about 10 beans per cup and I have a much truer extract as opposed to flavored alcohol. I also split and scrape the paste out of each bean.  This makes the process quicker and I really like more flecks of the vanilla in my recipes.  If you have trouble cutting your beans I have found that  placing the bean on the cutting board, pierce the stem end with a very sharp knife, keep the knife in the board, hold the stem and then pull the bean across the blade.  This is easier than trying to split the bean as it rolls around moving the knife through it.

I just love how easy and delicious this vanilla is. I messed it up the first time, but wasn't sad with the results anyways.. instead of clear rum or vodka, i used the dark rum I had lying around, and used only a little bit of one vanilla pod (yes, i know, I'm cheap)... The greatest thing was that this was just an awesome drink, and I drank it all within a few weeks in my coffee, hot cocoa, warm milk, not to mention ice creams and cakes. So the main problem with the recipe is DON'T give into temptation... hide it away for a few months, and choose an alcohol that you won't be tempted to drink. Hahaha, the lessons you learn from one little recipe.

I would encourage EVERYONE that uses Vanilla Extract to - MAKE YOUR OWN!!!!   I have made it for years and like others have said, once you do, the store-bought will never be the same.    Even the "good-stuff" almost always has caramel coloring and/or some kind of sweetener?  WHY?    I usually do start with a good but inexpensive vodka but think I will try a clear rum next time?  Don't hesitate - make your own Vanilla!!!!  ebay is a great resource for economical beans as they can be expensive but the bang for your buck makes it a great bargain!!!    The best tip I can give is do NOT skimp on the beans.  The more beans, the stronger the flavor and like someone else suggested - once "used up" in your extract - let them COMPLETELY DRY - then just shove one or two at a time in your sugar canister.  The best sugar around for all your baking needs or just in your coffee or tea.  BE Well my friends!!!

Once you make your own vanilla you will never buy it at the grocery again!  You can also use a combination of vodka & dark run for a richer flavor.  I have also used tequila and dark rum.  Try your own combinations.  Just be patient and let the vanilla sit for several months.  I give it a little shake about once a week.

I have made vanilla extract this way for a number of years and it is SO WORTH it. As another review pointed out, what is better than knowing EXACTLY what you are putting into your and your family's bodies? Besides, most people just buy the imitation vanilla extract that is made from by-products of the paper and coal-tar industries! See under "imitation vanilla" at http://www.vanilla.com/html/facts-extracts.html  It is also excellent to do this in a high-quality clear rum and use either the vodka or the rum in mixed drinks. It doesn't just have to be for cooking   ;o)

This is so unbelievably easy and so much cheaper than the store bought extract.  Really didn't think it could be this easy.  I don't get to bake as much as I would like, so I halved this recipe using 5 pods and a small bottle of vodka.  Even better, the pods were on sale! My husband did not believe that this would work so kept checking the bottle every week to see how it was doing.  And a friend wanted to drink it.  Absolutely amazing.

I have been complaining about the cost of store bought vanilla extract for years. No more complaining from me! It has been three months since i started my vanilla and it's sooo good! The beans can be expensive but i found them much cheaper if ordered online. I took the advise to strain some of the vanilla using a coffee filter and store in a small bottle while the rest of it continues to steep! I thought i would have 10 years worth of vanilla extract but my husband insists on taking a sip of it each day! I can't keep him out of it! I plan on making more and finding cute bottles to give away as gifts. I'm so glad i came across this recipe.

After a lot of research on this I just used a 1.75 Leader bottle of vodka and used 18 Grade A Madagascar beans in about 4 cups. 7 Madagascar beans (Grade A) and 10 Tahitian grade B beans in the other 4 cups. I had already ordered my beans on line before doing extra research. According to the experts(?) you should use Grade "B Extract" type beans for making vanilla. Be sure to scrape the seeds out of the beans & add to the vodka. I have ordered more Grade B Madascar beans and plan to make more with those. I'll see if I can tell a difference and add to my comments at Christmas. This is fun - I got cute bottles and corks from WalMart - $1.00 each. Remember that dark bottles are what vanilla come in-BUT - they sit on shelves for a long time at the store - most people put their vanilla in a dark cabinet - so I didn't worry about that and purchased clear cute bottles (4 oz.) - I'll just tell them to store it in a dark place. I think they will look great with a vanilla bean inside and they can add more vodka to it to replenish! I ordered from "Vanilla Products USA" rather than fighting with bidding. Have fun - its a great project and I'm sure I will have lots of happy friends - family & co-workers! The more beans you order - the cheaper they are!
After 6 days-the smell & color is incredible! Use good beans and you won't need more that 4 (5 max.)  per cup!

Used Stolichnaya vodka, 8 Madagascar beans and 4 Mexican vanilla beans, and as suggested in many reviews, I split them open before adding them to the bottle (Oh yeah, I realized as I was doing this that I had to remove about 1/4 cup of vodka so it wouldn't overflow after all the beans were added!  Then I went here and clicked on CPA's review as being helpful!)  I must say, the fragrance from the Mexican beans was unbelievably wonderful compared to the not-so-shabby but somewhat more "plain"  Madagascar beans.  It's only been 4 weeks, but my vanilla was brown within two weeks.  Used a little for the first time in a coffee drink because I couldn't resist - great flavor! I'm still going to let this batch sit while I use up the other bottles I already had on hand, but I will use this method forever! Only changes will be to mix types of vanilla beans for a more layered flavor, split them first, and probably throw a couple more in than what was listed in the recipe.

We always have 2 large vodka bottles brewing with vanilla beans at all times.  Love it in coffee, hot chocolate, plain yogurt, bubbly water, baking, anything really.  Good Tip is to label your bottles with the date that you started, or you will forget.  Also when the alcohol smell is gone, then it is ready to use.  Give the bottle a shake periodically.

OMGosh All I can say is WOW! This could not have been easier or More tasty. I started the extract in Sept, some time after Labor Day and it is now a week before Christmas. I just used it to make my first Old Fashioned Vanilla Pudding from here and I also made Pumpkin Spice Chex Mix with it. I will Never Ever buy another bottle of the store vanilla. The beans are really Not that expensive considering what you get from them, pure vanilla flavor. hubby got mine on line and in fact, I got them Last Christmas and I finally made another good use out of that purchase. After I was done with the beans, I popped them in my sugar bowl, I guess I should have dried them off a bit cuz my sugar is a bit damp, LOL Oh well, live and learn and Buy more sugar to cover it all up! I payed about $5.00 for the vodka, the cheapest one I could find, it is in a plastic bottle and I kept it under the puter table in my bedroom. Every once in a while(read, when I remembered) I would drop to my knees and give it a shimmy shake. Knowing that in a short while I would be rewarded with a Terrific new addition to my spice rack:) The smell is like no other. You simple Must try this if for no other reason but to say Hey I Can make something that taste expensive but really isn't! You only use a tbl spoon or so at a time any way, the quart will last a good long while. I found another Keeper thanks to the good folks on this site. Thank You Re!! No need to tell you I will make this again and again:)

This is great I been making my own vanilla for over 20 years now. Forget the stuff you buy in the store, home made is better. For Shalaine_1 the longer you keep it sealed and in a dark cool place the stronger it gets plus good quality Vanilla beens are also the key.

I made a double batch of this starting on October 15, 2011.  I made a batch with vodka and another at the suggestion of What's for Dinner, mom? using bourbon.  Each bottle was 750 ml and I put in 10 split vanilla beans that I purchased from spicesage. I waited the 6 months before using it, shaking the bottles every week or so.  The results are wonderful smelling vanilla.  I made a batch of 'Vanilla Wafers II' from this site, spliting the recipe so that I could use both vanillas in the same recipe. Both cookies had a great vanilla taste, and you could tell a difference.  I would like to make this again to have for Christmas gifts.  I won't be purchasing pure vanilla anymore when this one is so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is a good starting point, basic recipe. However, there is no mention of the quality of beans, other varieties of beans, and other alcohols. I've been making this for years, and have made many varieties... Tahitian beans, Mexican beans, as well as Madagascar. I've also used light and dark rums. Madagascar are what you would expect for vanilla. Mexican beans are a bit earthier, with a little smokiness. Tahitian are a bit brighter, with a little florally note.  Through trial and successes (because really, there's no going wrong), I've found my preferred mix is 1/2 vodka,  1/4 light rum, 1/4 dark rum as the base. The rums give it a richer flavor in my opinion. For the beans, I use about 10 Madagascar, 5 Tahitian and 2 Mexican beans per 750ml of alcohol. MINIMUM wait time is 6 months. Leave the beans in for up to 18 months, then use the beans for ice cream. Vanilla extract is like wine, and will continue to mature for years, and will never go bad. So make large batches!

Excellent!  Economical! Purchased vanilla beans off of eBay; used Smirnoff vodka.  Placed 10 split beans per 750ml bottle and let steep 3 months.

One word: IndriVanilla! I got my vanilla beans from them really inexpensively. I did my vanilla extract in a combination of gold and spiced rum instead of vodka but followed the same method and it's amazing. I've been adding the empty pods after I scrape them and use them in other recipes, too, and the flavor is just getting better and better developed. So much better than storebought!!!

I bought some vanilla beans on ebay, following the suggestion of other reviewers.  I love using this.  It is so much cheaper, and fun to be using something I made myself!

At four months, I can see that my extract is moving in the right direction.  I think it will be great at six months but there is no way that I would have used it at three weeks.  Time is this recipe's best friend and I would not try to rush it with the minimum time recommended.

Ok, it's been almost three months and I started to use my homemade vanilla this past week. I love it! It has a smooth rich taste that's much better than store bought. I split the beans lengthwise and used the least expensive vodka I could find. I currently have 2, one quart bottles and one gallon bottle "marinating". Because my taste always calls for more flavoring and spices in my recipes, I used about 12 beans for each quart and twice that much for the gallon bottle. What I'm using now is what was poured off before adding beans to the bottles and for that amount I used about 5 beans split lengthwise and cut in half. I still have plenty of beans left so I'm going to experiment with a bottle of bourbon and I will try a "better" vodka to see if there is truly a difference but, I am very satisfied with what I have thus far and I do a lot of baking. BTW, I am going to use the gallon bottle to make 2oz. bottles of vanilla to use as Christmas gifts for my family and friends who bake. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I will never have to buy store bought vanilla extract again. Homemade is sooooooo much better and over a period of time, cheaper!

I started my extract a couple of months ago in preparation for Christmas gifts for my baker friends and family (I'm also making vanilla infused sugar for them as well).  I decided to experiment with one bottle of Smirnoff Orange as well.  I used the orange extract just last night in a custard recipe - and it was delicious!  I can't wait to finish sampling all the other extracts I've made for my friends/family (want to make sure they taste yummy before I hand them out)!

At first, I was a bit hesitant to make my own extracts/sugars because I thought the vanilla beans themselves were so expensive... but my friend told me to check eBay - and I buy the beans now by the 1/2 pound.  Surprisingly less expensive and so far, they are excellent quality.  :-)  It's especially great if you're making a lot as gifts and need a lot of beans!

Okay, this isn't quite a review this is just to remind me as to when I started making this. Everything went smoothly until I overflowed the bottle of vodka. Silly me! I had to take two cups of vodka out to make all the beans fit without overflowing. After I put all the split vanilla beans in the vodka I was able to add back one cup. The last cup I put in a cute bottle from the container store along with 2 to 3 beans. I used a 1.75ml bottle of vodka. I'll update in 3-6 months!

I have a batch in the making....been about 6 months.  Plan on adding a 4oz bottle to my Xmas cookie packages.  Tip...get your vanilla beans on Ebay.  Just won 30 beans for ONE CENT.  Yes shipping is $5.99, but it's coming from France.  Any tips on the labels for the bottles or where anyone gets their bottles...had an issue on Ebay...won 25 for .99 and I think the seller did not quite like that.  Finally got them, but what a hassle.

Easy.  I used it for the first time today (after the beans had been in the alcohol for about 4 weeks).  It smells fabulous and tastes great.  I put it in my rice pudding!

I followed the recipe and after 5 months I am disappointed in the results so far. Fairly weak flavor, and that's with using extract grade beans. The recipe doesn't even specify to use them and I expect the results would be even more disappointing using regular grade beans. I agree with those who assert that more beans are needed for this to work. I just now added 5 more beans and we'll see what happens.

This is wonderful.  I have been making my own Vanilla in this manner for years and years.  It keeps forever (or till you use it up!).  I'll never buy those expensive little bottles again and this has the strength of real vanilla, not vanilla flavoring which is weak tasting.

I used 750ml of a good-quality vodka, and 24 small vanilla beans I had ordered some months back that had started drying out. It took less than a week before the extract was a good, dark colour, that smelled entirely of vanilla. I admit - I tasted it at that point, and it seemed ready to go. Fewer beans and I would let it steep for longer to extract the maximum flavour. I also sliced each bean in half lengthwise and scraped out the seeds. I tossed  everything into the vodka. I will make my own from now on.

So much fun to make and wait for. I would go in to the cupboard every once in a while just to admire and shake the bottle! I started mine back in the spring to have ready for Christmas gifts. Recipients were intrigued and thrilled with such an unusual and useful gift. I will try more beans next time though, as it didn't seem as strong as it should have.

you will gain more flavor by splitting the vanilla bean in half and scraping the insides and adding that to the alcohol. Try different beans for different flavors and mix them to create a more complex flavor.

Wonderful !!  I have even mixed it up a bit by adding bananas to the vodka first for baking banana & zucchini breads.  Try a flavored vodka for a different kick to cookies.  I will not buy store vanilla ever again.  Thanks !!

Well it's been 4 months since I started mine.  I split open 10 Madagascar vanilla pods down the middle and put them in 750mL of Vodka.  Even after 4 months, the color is not quite up to what I see in commercial vanilla extract.  But it does smell great and surely my family who will receive this for Christmas will love it!  Next time I will put even more vanilla pods and let it seep longer (~6 months).

i bought extract grade madagasger vanilla beans on ebay from a French supplier.  His ebay was in english but his correspondence was in french.  Thank goodness for Julia Child and hi school Latin.  These beans were grade B.  The extract was very pale 8 weeks aging following this recipe.  I then doubled the vanilla been after 2 months. I just added more this morning.  The color is too light compared to commercial extract.  It's starting to smell good, but don't trust my nose to judge strength of homemade vs commercial.       I read that there is a glut of vanilla beans on the market.  My Parisian source sent lots for under $10. My local liquor store had 50 ml plastic mini's of UV vodka for on-the-counter-basket special.  I got four going and also a saved green screw top 350 ml bottle with Svedka poured over the recipe required number of beans.  Pharmacy states all the bottles they use are plastic anymore.  Druggist came up with 2 dusty 150 ml glass bottles and tops.  Had not wanted to use plastic bottles at first but having found the 50 ml mini's....

I made extract a few years ago watching martha stewart but somehow I got the recipe wrong I only added 4 beans to 1liter and it was vanilla vodka. It's been on my shelf for years I recently saw this and found out you can get beans on ebay for cheap. At my store 2  beans are $4.  I added 10 madagascar extract grade. So far it looks great and smells great it's only been a week. For those that say it isn't vanilly enough you need to add more beans online best price.

I have been doing this for years and years.  I use only the single jar of McCormick's vanilla beans found at the grocery store for about $3-4 with two beans in it and then use a pint of the cheapest vodka.  It's still magnificent and a bottle will last me for a couple of years.  It makes an amazing Christmas gift, too.

Until I saw this recipe on here, I would have never thought this was possible to make your own vanilla!  It's expensive to buy and it's still not top quality from the store.  This is great b/c you can continually add to the bottle as you use it up.  Also makes great gift in individual little bottles for Christmas.

This has such a great flavor and so much fun to make.  I made it in August, and used it for all of my Christmas cookies and fudge.  It's nice to have and to use very generously in all of my recipes.  I won't be buying any more vanilla.  Thanks for sharing your recipe RE_BEKAH

I will never buy ready-made vanilla extract again!  This was so easy to make, and the best part is, I know exactly what's in it.  This is a great gift for friends.  I'll be making it all year-round for myself!

Made this today...so easy! I can't wait to try it in three weeks! I used a medium size bottle of vodka and three beans. Update: I used my extract to make frosting. Yum! I plan to add more beans to make the flavor stronger.

Wonderful and favorful. I bought 1# beans off of amazon and used less beans 6 was good for me because I had some other vanilla I needed to use up, so I just let it sit a little bit longer.  I did shake it more than said and it was fun to watch it turn amber.  The bottom is the best with all the little seeds...extra favor.  I use it for more than baking we put it on meat also.  It must be cooked so I also made vanilla sugar with my beans for things I wanted to not cook...vanilla sugar is great on buttered toast.  I bake a lot since we have allergies in the family and this is great for milk, gums, and corn allergies. Don't forget to make enough to share.....

I haven't read through all the comments here as many of them are aged quite a few years. Vanilla has increased in price exponentially because of Issues with vanilla crops in recent years  so you want to make sure you're getting the most bang for your buck.  I've done a lot of research into how to make vanilla extract and I want to put a few things out there. First of all, use grade B beans. They are more dry  and what is used to make vanilla extract.   If you're using grade a beans you're wasting your money. You'll want to get Madagascar  if you're looking to make something that tastes like traditional vanilla extract that you would buy in the store. Tahitian has a more floral scent and isn't traditionally used to make extract. Also, make sure you have the ratio right. You should have 1 ounce of vanilla beans for every 8 ounces of alcohol.  That can be about 10 beans, depending on size.  So just a few beans isn't going to cut it. You also want to cut the beans into small pieces so that none of the beans stray out of the alcohol. If they aren't completely submerged  they can develop mold.  Although it looks really cute to put a vanilla bean in the bottle of extract that you're giving Aunt Edna, she may not know that you have to keep the been completely submerged. You will want to let it steep for at least three months, orherwise  you're just making vanilla flavored alcohol. The alcohol you use does NOT need to be high-quality. 70 proof is all it takes, svedka is an awesome opt

I've been making vanilla extract for over 10 years now.  I give it for Christmas gifts,  preparing a gallon every winter for the next year's gifts.   The ratio I use is  1 pound of grade B vanilla beans to almost 1 gallon of light rum or 4 ounces of vanilla beans to almost a quart of rum or vodka.  Due to the bulk of the vanilla beans some of the rum has to be removed to prevent overflow .  

Pulverize the beans in the food processor or blend the beans with some rum in a blender before adding  to the  container(s) with enough rum to fill.  Seal the container(s).  Shake or tumble every week and time does the rest.

Pulverizing the beans results in a much darker color and deeper vanilla flavor.  Using more beans and waiting a year allows a fully mature, strong  flavor  to develop.

I will be attempting this homemade vanilla immediately!  My husband swears by shrimp soaked in "pure" vanilla as the best catfish bait, therefore all of my vanilla disappears!   Can't wait to try this.  Thank you!

5 stars for the great idea. I´ll update after the 3 months of seeping and used in a recipe. At 2 euros per pod, I hope it wasn´t a waste of money. Thanks.

OK. So it is early stages. I just made this (a week now) recipe. And even though it is way early, I wanted to write on it. The Aroma is so strong. can not wait to use it. WHAT I DID: First, I used American Vodka from Costco (Costco off brand is Grey Goose. They (Grey Goose) make the private label for Costco. ) . The BEAN! I researched and found that Madagascar Vanilla Beans are the most sought after. I found them on Amazon ($36.00 for 10 - Grade A Beans - 6" long) and purchased them. They were very plump and moist. You could just smell the Vanilla when you opened the (vacuumed packed) bag! I plan on waiting for the 6 months. I will have to update once we get to the end date.

I love this! I use a lot of pure vanilla and this stuff is full of vanilla flavor.  I am making enough for holiday gift giving too.  Got some really nice blue bottles on Amazon for my gifts.  After reading the reviews, I used the max beans and it smells wonderful.  After 3 months in storage, I'm now using it for baking. I did use Grade B, like the first reviewer suggested and its wonderful, dark pure vanilla.

8 grade A, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla beans found via Ebay, split down the middle submerged in 750 ml Jim Bean Bourbon. (Walmart $12)started. At 8 months there is very little flavor. You can buy a bottle of 16 ounce pure vanilla extract for $8.

I tried it and love the result-can't wait until it's ready for my friends to use!  I'm giving as Christmas gifts to my foodie friends, and I only started a week ago, so the tag includes directions to wait at least 2 more weeks before using, but they're already turning a golden brown.  Love this easy idea for myself and also for gifts.

I use Everclear rather than vodka. Once the vanilla has been made and the extraction process complete, I put the beans in a plastic container with plain white sugar to infuse the sugar with the vanilla taste.

We lived in Russia for 4 years on government assignment. Vanilla extract is unavailable there and cannot be mailed in due to alcohol content. However, vodka of every imaginable variety is readily available, as are fresh herbs and spices, including vanilla beans. I made this type of extract several times and it works great for anything that needs vanilla. It actually tastes better in some recipes than the manufactured extracts available in the US. I found it best to soak the beans at least 8 weeks, but 12 or a bit longer seems best, then bottle in small, colored, sterile bottles that seal tightly, just as if you were cold pack canning, and store in cabinet. You can use small amounts if necessary after the first 8 weeks, but the longer it brews, the better it is, up to 16 weeks. 12 weeks or so seems best, but the smell and taste test works for getting the strength you want. Don't forget to gently shake it weekly during the entire soaking time or you get vanilla flavored vodka, not vanilla extract!! Not sure exactly why, but my friend forgot to shake her batch for a few weeks and it just didn't have the rich vanilla scent and flavor mine did so I think the agitation helps draw the flavor from the beans. We tried 4 different vodkas and there were subtle differences, but in the US you don't usually find the numerous varieties made from nearly every grain (and mixture) imaginable found in Russia so whatever you get will probably work fine. However, I would try to get at least a mid

I haven’t bought vanilla since discovering how to do this. My preference is using inexpensive bourbon as the alcohol. I think the flavour blends well. I also let it sit for at least 4-6 months so there is always a full and partial bottle in the closet. By the time one is finished the next is ready!

I do love homemade vanilla extract. I also think more beans per liter bottle is better and I prefer brandy.

I've been making my own vanilla extract for years. So easy and useful. This is one of those times where you can and even should just use any cheap, unflavored vodka. Don't use this with your expensive stuff. It won't improve the flavor.  Homemade vanilla extract makes a fantastic gift, especially if you remember to start it in the summer, so it can be used right away. Next year. This is what I say every holiday season. Then, I end up using all that I make. I justify it by giving away plenty of puddings, cookies and other vanilla-infused treats year-round, at least when my two teenaged sons don't scarf down everything at once, as though the goodies all have a one-hour expiration. I go through a lot of vanilla extract. Now their friends immediately start scanning the counters when they come over. But they also do this with yeast breads, so no surprise there.

Have made this before, was the best vanilla ever. I let it set for 10 months before using it. Would like to do it again.When I do I will make a larger amount.

I made it using vanilla flavored vodka.  That gave it a great taste.  I won't buy vanilla in the store ever again.

Made this several years ago and I'll probably use the last of it in the next few months. Thanks to this recipe, I will NEVER buy vanilla extract again. This time when I make it I will make 1/2 a liter instead of a full liter.

I used the 10 Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans with 2 Mexican Vanilla Beans, the Vodka itself is mixed with a little Bourbon and Dark Rum.

These things I listed are what I did with my Vanilla Extract and It's PERFECT!!
