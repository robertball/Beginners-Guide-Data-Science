Great dish! I added a sweet pepper for extra flavour. Sliced Italian sausage would also go really well, especially if you're using the sweet pepper. When they're in season I'm going to add some fresh, slightly saut√©ed snow peas.

Excellent.  I needed to keep it low salt so used coconut oil instead of butter, and only 2-3 Tbsp of goat cheese and low salt fettuccine noodles.  Hubby needs to cut back on meat as well so I used fresh sliced baby Bella mushrooms to round this meal out.  Wonderful tasty dish and I'm not even a vegetable-loving person.  Great recipe, Melinda.   This kind of recipe could change my mind about vegetables tasting like dirt.

Such an easy weeknight meal for a busy mom like myself. The kids loved it and it made great leftovers.

Fantastic. My husband and I both loved it. I had to add some stewed tomatoes, because I didn't have quite enough cherry tomatoes, and I added spinach and a touch of feta. I also just fine diced the zucchini (less mess). I went and bought some more goat cheese the next day to have on hand, because it really seemed to make the dish!

The flavors are good, but it came out a little dry. I would add some grilled shrimp next time.

I added sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe (except I didn't measure ingredients). It was outstanding!

Added this to my Thanksgiving menu since my parents are vegetarian and it was a huge hit with everyone, including my 10 year old daughter, who is super picky.   Make sure you crumble the goat cheese over the pasta while it's hot so that it melts and coats the pasta.  Yumm-a-licious!

Great basic pasta recipe. I was surprised at the amount of zucchini, but it balanced well and added heartiness to the dish. I agree with adding something like prosciutto or Italian sausage.

Soooo crazy good! I love trying new recipes and the name on this caught my eye. Made it for my husband last night and he requested it again before he finished his plate. I added the zucchini to the tomatoe mixture, incorporated it then added pasta, goat cheese etc. So smooth and flavorful. I would make this for guests!!

Made this tonight. Flavors were great. When I added the shredded zucchini, it stayed in a glob. I really had to stir it to incorporated it. I cut up, in small chunks more zucchini, saute it and added it. I also made it all in one pan. I just put the zucchini in a small bowl then continued with the same pan.
 I suggest using small chunks of zucchini.
