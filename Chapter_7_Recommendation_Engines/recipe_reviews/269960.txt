This has potential but as written you will end up with very burnt bacon. I went ahead and experimented with the entire pound package. The basket only holds a few pieces at a time so this was quite a lengthy test. On the very last batch I got it right. I ended up reducing the temp to 350, cooking it for 5 minutes, flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Another helpful hint is to cut your bacon pieces in half prior to putting them in the basket. If you do not, the pieces that overlap never get as done as crisp as the parts that are not overlapping.

this recipe makes Almost Burnt Bacon. some people  like that. I don't at all. I want melt in my mouth Bacon. 350 cook 6 flip then 4 more I feel is perfect. not gummy at all crispy without the meat overcooking and becoming tough. add water to the bottom to prevent the smoke detector from telling your neighbors it's bacon time.

We like our bacon crispy but not burnt. After several tests, I settled on 3 minutes on each side at 390 degrees. That is cooking 5 half strips at a time. Very tasty and quick. Tradeoff is the multiple batches required if you're cooking a whole pound of bacon.

made half a package. cooked for about 7-8 minutes and it was done perfectly. I'm sure time cooked varies based on different air frying ovens.  Still quicker, easier, and less mess than conventional pan frying.
