3.19.17   I just thinly sliced the brussels sprouts, sauteed them in a little butter until they were just crisp tender (don’t overcook), squeezed the lime over them, salt & pepper and they were ready to serve.  Really didn’t measure anything, and they were very good and very easy.  That lime juice really brightens and enhances the flavor of the sprouts.  You won’t need a recipe in the future, this is waaaaay easy.  mommyluvs2cook, excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

These weren't my favorite way to make brussel sprouts.  I used the food processor to shred them (which was easier than chopping) and sauteed them in the butter.  Added the lime juice and salt and pepper but it just seemed to need something more.  I served this as a side dish for a Mexican themed dinner - maybe some more spices might have helped?  The little crunchy parts were good though.  :)  Thanks!

So good!  I let the butter brown just a bit first and added minced garlic.  My 10 y.o. Ate a third helping.
