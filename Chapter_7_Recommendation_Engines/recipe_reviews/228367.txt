I substituted a can of RoTel tomatoes and chilis for the diced tomatoes and added a can (undiluted) of cream of chicken soup and a small can of minced green chilis (drained).  Loved it!

Not bad.  The chicken turns out very tender.  The sauce is ok but not my favorite.  Next I will cook the chicken in green chile sauce.  I bet that will be even better.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Great filling for enchiladas.  I used rotel tomatoes and chilis instead of tomatoes as that is what I had at home.  I wanted a extra sauce so I used 3 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same as written.  After cooking the chicken in the slow cooker, I rolled it in 10-10 inch tortillas, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the additional sauce over top, covered with foil, and baked at 375 for about 40 mins.  Next time though I need to remember to save some of the sauce to the side before shredding the chicken and adding it back to the crockpot.  We love cumin, probably my favorite spice, so I enjoyed the flavor and did not find it too overwhelming.  Will definitely make again.

I made this even easier and faster by substituting taco seasoning for the spices.  It was quite yummy in my enchiladas tonight.  Served it to friends and everyone loved it.

This was easy and pretty good, but I think the cumin was a little strong for our taste. It saved well and I used it to make a corn tortilla layered casserole. I added black olives, shredded monterey jack and baked for 30minutes at 350 degrees. Topped with a tiny bit of sour cream and salsa and my husband loved it.

This was delicious!  I am so happy to know how to make enchilada sauce now.  I accidentally forgot the cayenne, but it was spicy enough for our mid-west pallets.  I did and a can of green chiles.  Turned into great enchiladas.

easy and a lot yummier than canned enchilada sauces!  i substituted chili powder with chipotle chili powder and added a can of fire roasted green chilies, 1 large, diced red pepper and a small bag of frozen corn.  low for 8 hours really let the flavors develop and the chicken shredded easily.  this made about 12 (large) enchiladas, so I had enough leftover to freeze.  I think the filling would have frozen nicely, even without wrapping it in tortillas first.  good recipe!

We enjoyed meal but it wasn't our favorite. Rolled up tortilla with meat mixture and melted cheese on top.  Not sure if I would make again and will look for another recipe.

Yum! I put my chicken in the crockpot frozen and put a minimal amount of chicken broth (if any) in the mix, I also use canned tomatoes with diced chili's and for a full recipe use 3 cans otherwise there isn't enough sauce. Once everything is cooked I put a little sauce in the bottom of a pan roll up the chicken and some shredded cheese in tortillas and then top with the rest of the sauce and a little more cheese.

Yummy! Easy to prep, easy to use. Roll up with some cheese in a tortilla, maybe some refried beans, good to go! Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved these!  I was worried about the amount of chili powder in this, but I'm glad I didn't alter the recipe!  This makes a very good enchilada sauce and filling for chicken enchiladas!  I loved the sauce so much I'm going to try using it for ground beef enchiladas, too!  Thanks for a great (and easy) recipe, Kari Shifflett!

This was super simple and delicious. Everybody from age nine and up loved it. Only change I made was adding a bit of onion powder. Dredged flour tortillas in the sauce, stuffed them with the chicken and cheese and baked until hot. Definitely a staple in our house.

We loved this meat!  We used the meat for tacos, but it would be great in enchiladas or even on nachos.  The only changes I made were that I substituted Rotel for the plain tomatoes and used 5 boneless chicken thighs and skipped the cayenne since I had a 2 year old eating them.  There was still enough heat to taste good and there was the perfect amount of sauce.  I will definitely make again!

Kari, I made it, my kids devoured it. My 5 year old that only likes pb&j and Mac & cheese was the first one done. You nailed it. Thanks. This will be a staple in my house now.

Followed the recipe, except for using Rotel diced tomatoes and chilies instead of diced tomatoes and it was a hit! Even the kids couldn't get enough. Will definitely be making this again!

I haVe changed a few things to make it my own and more flavorful.  Instead of using the seasoning it calls for I use fajita and taco season packets from mccormicks, and blend a can of campbels chicken tortilla soup with the chicken broth.  Makes for a super yummy sauce.  I also use the rotel green chili tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes.

I made this last night and my family loved it. It will replace my old enchilada recipe and this is sooo much easier to make. They loved it so much that I will make it again tonight and serve it over rice instead of with corn tortillas.

This passed the test in our house.  Will make again, likely with more cayenne pepper.  It's fairly mild, yet still flavorful as written.  We wrapped it in soft tacos with cheese and medium salsa.  I used an immersion blender at the beginning, then flopped with chicken breast around in the sauce to cover it, then cooked on low about 8 hours.  Cleaned up super easy, even without a liner.

I didn’t make any changes. Slow cooked 4 hours. Dipped in to flour tortillas and topped with Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream & salsa. Whole family loved it. Even the picky eater ( children):)

Very easy and tastes great.  The sauce reminds me of the Senoran style of my childhood with a little less heat.  Made this dish one night and stored in a covered glass dish in the refrigerator until I had time to make some corn tortillas out of my precious Doña Ripa masa stash that I bring from Costa Rica.  Ten chicken enchiladas done and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper...love it!

There was too much chili powder in here for me.  I did take the advice of others and used a can of Rotel and a can of diced chilis.  That's a good call.  But all I could really taste was chili powder.  To serve, I put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 pan, rolled up 5 enchiladas and then topped with remaining sauce and cheese.  Baked at 400 for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese.  It was good, just not great!

This is now my go to enchilada recipe. Only thing i add is sliced onion and bell pepper on top of the chicken. Once cooked I shred the chicken and roll into corn tortillas with the onions, peppers, and some shredded cheese. Then top with remaining sauce, a little more cheese and bake for 20 minutes. So good!

going to make it now. i have a can of red sauce whoch i prefer (lol boiling dried red chiles, pure, and straining them takes to long). the chicken sounds very flavorful for the insides and im thinking the broth/ sauce made from this will be awesome to make rice with. ill substitute a can of tomatoes/chiles as well.

Great basic recipe but here are some short cuts.  Use a package of HOT chili mix as the spices.  Add in a can of hot rotel tomatoes.  At only 100 calories a serving this recipe rocked! My husband didn't even know it was low calorie and I am using the leftovers to wrap up in lettuce wraps for my low calorie lunch.

This was fabulous! I used chipotle chili powder.  The chicken was SO tender!  My husband and I don't eat many carbs, so we topped the meat with a little fat-free cheese and a bit of sour cream, very filling!

Next time I will try Ancho chili powder.

5 STARS!!! Simply Amazing!!! I was in need of a quick chicken taco enchilada recipe! This is it! It will definitely be my go to from here on out!! It's simple to put together and the crockpot does all the work!!! The entire house was full of this beautiful aroma! I tweaked the recipe a bit for 2. Used 3 chicken breasts, and halved all the other ingredients. I keep a stash of my own homemade taco dry spices I used that and a tsp of  dry Chipotle spice. Full of flavor!!! We're having a side salad with this and roasted corn!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

My family thought this was really good.  The only thing I changed was to use tomatoes with green chilis, and I also added a can of black beans so it would stretch further.  We just spooned it into flour tortillas, topped with cheese and sour cream.  A nice recipe to come home to.

I've tried making my own enchilada sauce and wound up dumping it. But this is A-One!  I just purchased a 4 qt. Crock Pot so was anxious to try this using what was in my pantry and fridge ... so subbed with  tomato sauce; 2 cloves garlic; half diced onion; cut salt in half and used half a whole skin-on chicken. In the pot overnight and WOW!  Skin and bones slipped off chicken like buttah!  There is so much flavor in the bones and dark meat that adds to the sauce and overall flavor of the meat. I thought the half cup of flour would be too much, but it thickens the sauce perfectly without diluting the flavor. Thank you Kari for a delicious resolve to home made enchilada sauce (makes a quart)!

I made this for myself and my roommate this evening. I followed the recipe exactly but I cooked it on high for 4 hours, shredded the chicken then cooked on low for 2 more.  It made great enchiladas. I plan to make it again soon with the addition of green peppers and onions for the filling.

this was pretty good although my initial taste felt like it was missing something so I added a can of green chilis. I also used spicy red pepper tomatoes for added spice. I might do  recipe & a half of sauce and set some aside for laying in the bottom of the pan and on top of the enchiladas for baking.

Very good.  I thought it was a bit salty, so I'll turn it down next time.  I also cut the flour a bit. Unused portion goes in tacos tomorrow.

Excellent, a big hit with my family! Super easy as recipe title indicates.  I used diced tomatoes with jalapeño for a little kick then let chicken marinate in some enchilada sauce overnight.

My family loved this.  I didn't have the diced tomatoes so I used tomato sauce since that is what I had. I found using the tomato sauce helped so I didn't have to use the blender and saved me time before I left for work. I also added more cayenne pepper and I use curry powder instead of cumin.  My kids are picky and they loved this.

SO, so, so easy and DELICIOUS!  I make it almost exactly as the recipe calls for, using Better than Bullion Chicken Base for the broth, so use very little added salt (a pinch).  I can't believe how fast it comes together and love that it only takes a blender, a couple of measures, and my slow cooker, so there's not a massive clean up at the end.  Versatile enough that it can be used for multiple meals, and can be customized to fit the favorite flavor profile of the cook.  Forgot to get it started early enough tonight so we're going to experiment with how it comes out using the pressure cooker function of our Breville Fast-Slow Cooker.  THANK YOU for sharing, this is my favorite recipe!!

Terrific! I used 7 chicken breasts but kept the sauce the same quantity and it was plenty. Used half of this mixture in a layered-style enchilada casserole with flour tortillas, refried beans, cheese---topped with green onion, sour cream and cilantro. Delicious!

Giving only 4 stars as the sauce was a little runny and I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. I decreased the amount of cumin by half (DH doesn't care for the spice). I love recipes like this that give a great base to work with and personalize, as would be easy to do in this case. Thanks!

I added garlic salt as it is a preferred flavor. The potatoes cooked up just right.
