I love the flavor of this. Be careful - I used mild pepperoncinis and the stuffing was still pretty spicy - fine for me, maybe not for you. Next time, I think I'll use thick-cut chops and stuff them, as I think they will hold together better - the stuffing wanted to fall out of the roast when cut. This made a great pickley, olivey "sauce" in the pan. I had already made pasta with a parmesan/ garlic coating - but would have coated it with this if I'd realized it would be there... Thanks for the recipe, we'll do it again!

This was okay; we love olives and muffalettas, but the Italian dressing marinade was a little much for our tastes. Thanks for the post.

After reading the ingredient list, I thought this sounded like a good recipe to try.  But when I went to make it, I noticed that nowhere in the directions does it tell you what to do with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar called for.  I think the cooking time is a little long, because my pork loin came out dry.  I won't be making this one again.

this was exceptional; the only thing that i did differently was trim my roast so that it formed a 3/4 (approximately) slab; i then spread the olive relish evenly over the meat, rolled it up, and tied it with butchers twine; pleasing to the eye as well as tender and delicious!

I halved the stuffing and used it to stuff 2 LARGE pork chops. BF enjoyed it very much but I wasn't thrilled. Not the recipe's fault, just not for me.

very good. did not cook for the whole two hours though. cooked at 300 for an hour and then at 350 for 20 more minutes..I also used a smaller pork loin though. I also used foil so the pork loin could cook in its own juices making it tender and full of flavor.

Needs some sugar.  The italian dressing also makes it a little sour.  May be adding a little bit of olive oil would be good?  Kinda salty, too.

It was over cooked   Only needed 15-20 mins/lb for total of 45 mins -1 hour not 2 hours. 
With lots of mayo it makes a nice sandwich
