Delicious! For as simple as this was and the few ingredients used, this was full of flavor! This would be great as a side or a main topped w/ garlic shrimp or chicken...the possibilities are endless! This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent light lunch! I made exactly as written, then topped with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a tsp or so of lemon juice. Flavors were perfect!

This was terrible! I made it due to the rave reviews I read. I donâ€™t know what flavor other referred to because it lacked flavor.

So yummy. Only changes I made: Used 4 huge garlic cloves. Used 2 Tablespoons of butter and 2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil. Added lots of black pepper at the end. Very flavorful . Certainly making again!

Easy to make, very tasty. I doubled the batch and made as a side for a chicken dish I was dropping off to a friend. I needed something quick and easy. I kept out some for my family and we devoured.  I will make again.

Very good and easy to make. Very few ingredients and pretty healthy. I made it with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. It gives a very good flavor. Thank you for the idea. Definitely something I will make again.

This is a good, basic recipe. I added chicken breast and served this as the main dish - also topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Next time I make this, I am going to add grilled mushrooms to it. I served with Caesar salad. A nice, light dinner.

Loved this dish!  Will for sure make it again!  Had to use Margarine instead of Butter.  Wife cannot tolerate Butter.  Was still very tasty!

Egg Noodles with Spinach Haiku: "Easy nice side dish. Complement any protein. (Had ours with chicken.)" I wish I had used more spinach as mentioned in cook's notes because I always forget how much a huge handful of spinach can wilt into little green slivers, and I really like spinach. I also really like a childhood favorite of buttered and salted noodles, so this was a nice side dish win. We had grated parmesan at the table to sprinkle on top. Vuuuury nice indeeeeed.

2-9-2016  ~Saute up some spinach, add cooked pasta, toss.  Pretty simple, pretty basic, but also pretty darned good.  Went great with the  "Fresh Herbed Halibut"  I served it with.

A good side dish.  It was a little bland.  Add mushrooms & more garlic then it's good.  With ground beef or diced chicken it's a great casserole.

Another great meatless meal, we love pasta and egg noodles.  This was so easy and quick to make.  I would love to be able to make some and freeze it, but not sure how noodles would do in the freezer.
