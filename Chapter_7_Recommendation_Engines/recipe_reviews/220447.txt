I made this recipe from Brown Eyed Baker's blog. It is fantastic.  I followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake, slightly bitter filling, and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center.  I also went one step farther and mixed up a Bailey's Salted Caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top.  (For the drizzle, I used 1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping, a Tbsp of Bailey's, and salted it to taste. )  I'd definitely recommend making these!

Made them for my bf's birthday party and they were absolutely a hit. I had enough for 24 + one larger cupcakes, but had to make another half batch of the icing for as many.

These cupcakes were great!!!!  I was skeptical about the syrup part, but it worked out great!  It didn't harden crunchy, it was smooth.  These are definately sweet and I upped the anti with the booze.  I found that one recipe of the icing was skimpy, but two was too much.  I like decorating though and used a 2D tip to ice it.  They were fantastic and I got rave reviews on them.....and I am not a very proficient baker, so that speaks to how easy this recipe comes together.  I woke up the next day craving more!

So far, folks love these...a perfect Patty's Day treat. A few notes on prep: FILLING: Melting chocolate is tricky business. Heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate. If you end up with a chunky, greasy mixture it means the chocolate didn't temper and you'll need to start over. FROSTING: I agree that the frosting as written isn't quite right and adding more Bailey's is not the best solution for making it fluffier. While it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it (like adding flour), it actually makes the frosting runnier. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect: both in quantity and in consistency.

I made these cupcakes a couple days ago. I followed the recipe completely. These (hands down) are the best cupcakes I've ever had. I tinted the frosting pink and took them to work for a Valentine treat. I got so many compliments. This weekend I have to make another batch for my husband to take to his work. I just started getting into baking and these were very fun to make. One thing I learned is that these take a lot of time to make, especially if your a beginner. If I had to guess I'd say it took me at least 3-1/2 hours from start to finish. All in all I'll be making these quite a bit.

AMAAAAAAAAZING cupcakes!!!! I skipped the filling, as I had a lot of baking (and a lot of parties) to do. The cupcakes themselves were DIVINE, and rich-tasting. I didn't change a thing otherwise, but next time I'll make the filling and rate it even higher. :-)

I just made these cupcakes last night and...WOW!  They have been a big hit so far!  I had an issue with the butter not getting fluffy enough so I added more Bailey's as mentioned in the Cook's Note, and it worked great!  These cupcakes are a must-try!

I followed the recipe exactly except doubled the frosting and added more baileys to it.  I used a cupcake corer and had exactly the right amount of filling.  I did use all the frosting from the doubled batch.  These cupcakes are amazing.  Just the cake itself is delicious and moist.  With the bittersweet filing and sweet icing these are perfect.

I made these cupcakes for a friend's birthday which is the day before St. Patrick's Day.  I made the cupcakes exactly as written with modifications for our high altitude (over 5,000 ft.).  

The cupcakes were fantastic!  The only thing that I might have done differently would be to increase the filling and frosting as I ran out of it before I had filled all of the cupcakes.  

I used the correct alcoholic mixture as well.  FYI you can but small miniatures for the filling and frosting.  Which is what I did.  I also used good quality chocolate and cocoa for the recipe.  

These may take a while to make, but they are truly awesome and worth all of the time involved.  

I also used my Wilton cupcake corer for the first time, which may be why I needed extra filling.  The corer, once I figured it out, made it easy to take out the extra cupcake material in the middle.  

I used the cupcake cores to make my Grandma Scherer's "cake".  She could never get any cake to come out of the pan, so she would crumble it up and fold it into whipped cream along with some fruit. I did the same with my middles adding dried cherries.

Yeah...icing tastes good but started piping and I ran out. Tried to just smear it around and salvage some but still wasn't enough. If it wasn't midnight I'd make more. So I'll just be short a couple cupcakes and they'll look ugly. Oh well. I'll know next time to make a double batch of icing. Ganache filling is easy, I skip butter and whiskey and just simmer a cup of heavy cream and pour on a bowl of 8 oz. of bittersweet chocolate. Let the cream and chocolate sit in a heat safe bowl for a minute then wisk away and it smooths right now! If you're filing cupcakes you may have some left over but dip some fruit in it and you're good!

WOW... These were fantastic!!!!  Made cake batter according to recipe, subbing low fat sour cream & margarine for butter....it made 30 cupcakes!  Made glaze filling, subbing chocolate chips for semisweet chocolate, half & half for heavy cream, 1 tbsp. melted margarine & 1 ounce Jameson's whiskey. Carved hole in center of cupcakes, spooned in filling, then re-covered with the crust of a piece of the cut-out pieces...I recommend doing this to make frosting easier!  Made double batch of frosting with 1 stick of butter Cisco, 10 tsp Bailey's & 4 cups powdered sugar...this was more than enough to thickly frost 30 cupcakes.  These were absolutely spectacular to taste, but somewhat messy to eat. I give this one a million stars...try it, you will LOVE it!!!

I made these earlier today. However I used 8 Tbsp of Bailey's and used 1oz. of Forty Creek Whisky instead of 1 tsp of an Irish whiskey. They turned out absolutely incredibly. Would highly suggest making this.

I made these without the filling to keep them kid friendly. They were wonderful but they were way underdone at 17 min. I cooked them for s total of 22 min before the toothpick was clean. Honestly, they tasted almost exactly like Duncan Heinz devil's food cake. You could use the mix and substitute Guinness for the water. The frosting was amazing and I would recommend using it with any cake.

I actually made this into a two layer cake instead of cupcakes and it was delicious. I filled the layers with cream cheese frosting and then covered the cake in ganache. Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious and rich.  I made almost exactly as the recipe with just a little extra Baileys in the Icing and I used Kahula in the filling instead of the Irish Whiskey(only because I did not have it on hand).  This is now a welcome addition to my permanent recipe box.  Thanks so much, Happy St. Patricks Day!

These were BIG hit with everyone who tried them! I've made them twice, using Guinness the first time and a chocolate stout the second and both were delicious. I increased the whiskey to 2 tablespoons for the filling and it was just enough to give a noticeable flavor. I doubled the frosting but you really need 1 1/2 batches to ice them well. I had no problems with consistency that other viewers reported and used a cookie press to apply the icing. Don't be intimidated by the time: Most of it is 'wait time'--waiting for the cupcakes to bake, then cool and the filling to cool. While the cupcakes are baking make the filling to give it a chance to cool and save a little time. NOTE: the filling must really come to room temp to thicken up; this takes a while. I found the cupcakes didn't rise as well the first time, but my daughter used foil cupcake liners and later read these may be the reason. No problem the second time using paper liners.

Good batter recipe, very fluffy with just enough stout flavor. Mine took a bit longer to bake - about 20 minutes. I made a different filling and frosting so I can't comment on that.

I made these over the weekend and brought them in for my office for St. Patty's Day and everyone loved them!  They are moist and flavorful!  You definitely need to double the frosting recipe if you are using the large decorator tip and piping the frosting onto the cupcakes.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect!  Will definitely make these again!!!

I made these just as a chocolate cupcake without the filling and frosting. They came out nice and moist.  I used Guinness Draught beer. They were very easy to make.  I thought with 2 cups of sugar they would be overly sweet but not at all.  I got 24 cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)

Very different and fun for St Patrick's Day. I made as shown in the recipe. As many others said, make 1.5-2x the frosting, especially if frosting with a piping bag!

Delightful! Incredible meld of all my favorite Irish flavors! My boys said they taste like an Irish Car Bomb  - they loved them! I sprinkled English Toffee Bits O' Brickle on top w some green sugar crystals!

This recipe was delicious! I think I would still give it 5 stars the way it was, but I made some tiny adjustments that I thought I'd share…

I really wanted the cupcakes to have a subtle alcohol flavor, so after I baked, cooled, and cored them, I put together some Baileys & Jameson in a glass and used a small brush to brush it across cupcakes. I think this really helped with that flavor in the end.

I also read reviews about trouble with the frosting… I kind of winged it, but instead of using all butter, I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 cream cheese (and yes, you will likely need 1.5x the amount stated in the recipe), and mixed for a 6-7 mins to achieve fluffiness. I put in several tbsp of Bailey's, and then added powdered sugar until I reached a nice consistency – I believe I ended up adding 3-4 cups. Final result was creamy, thick, and not overly sweet.

One last thing: my filling came out pretty thick, so I ended up with a big chunk of really sweet, rich chocolate ganache in the middle of the cupcake. I happened to like it, but my roommate thought it was a bit much since it wasn't really evenly distributed. Next time, I might experiment with putting a layer of the filling on top of the cupcake, rather than inside it, before frosting it – assuming that it still comes out just as thick next time. That way, it's almost like a "base layer" of frosting, and you end up with a little mouthful in each bite. Ultimately, will depend on the thickness, I think.

All in all, worth the effort!

I've made this recipe several times as cupcakes and as a cake and people LOVE it! I have also made the cupcakes without the filling and they are still amazing. Follow this recipe to a "t" and you will be every chocolate lover's hero!

Loved this Recipe!!! I made them for st. patricks day and everyone loved them. I added a little more alcohol just because I wanted my guest to be able to really taste it. I also had some filling left over so I dipped strawberries into it and put them in the fridge for my guest. I also drizzled the leftover filling on top! (pics submitted)

The original recipe calls for 5 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting, and be sure to use unsalted butter throughout.  Very good cupcakes!

very very good. Time consuming, but well worth it. I will be using it for many celebrations, just changing the frosting color and using different liquors to fit the holiday.

Holy Cow these are amazing!!!!! The cupcake is perfect texture and the gooey fudge middle is the perfect touch! The icing is also the perfect consistency. I used a Dutch pressed cocoa and added some Mexican vanilla to the icing. Delicious!

Made this for St. Patrick’s day dessert and it was everyone’s favorite. It takes a bit of time but well worth it.  You’ll need to make extra frosting then the recipe suggests.

I made this for my husband’s 40th birthday and his two best friends were jealous!  I only had 10 adults to eat 24 cupcakes (the kiddos got fun green alien monster cupcakes, but from a store bought vanilla box mix because I’m crazy, not MAGIC) and I had no leftovers because what leftovers weren’t eaten on the spot were taken to ease the journey home.  I took the advice from other commenters and increased the frosting amount by 50% and erred on the side of excess and used 5 Tbs. of Baileys.  Honestly, the frosting alone is worth the recipe, it would pair well with a pumpkin, cappuccino, or spice cake too!

Couldn't find Irish stout beer so used Breckenridge Vanilla porter--delicious
Everything else was great--made these for my son for Father's Day treat!  He loved them!
Followed directions for the frosting--Perfect! Enough for all the cupcakes!
Definitely a keeper!  Will make again!

I would highly recommend these cupcakes - I would say the first time try was a success.   I followed the recipe exactly.  The reviews were positive and gave helpful suggestions for the icing.   One note about the filling - it looks like there would be a lot left over but the amount works perfectly.  I would definitely make these again.

Beautiful cupcakes full of flavor! I did end up using the cored cupcake centers to sprinkle on top to use up and have no waste; it gave it a nice garnish on top that pulls in colors- makes it look complete with natural colors.

They were very good.  I ended up putting part of the cake back onto of the filling to make it easier to frost the cupcakes.  Oh and I made 12 jumbo instead of 24 regular size.  I split one with my hubby.

This is a great recipe if you love chocolate cupcakes.  I followed the recipe at they were fantastic.  Only thing I would recommend is to make at least 1 1/2 times the frosting, as I did run out and had to make more.  I think 2 times would be too much, but it's great frosting.

I was craving chocolate cupcakes and man 'o man did these deliver!  The cupcakes came out very moist.  I opted out of filling them, and topped them with a peanut butter frosting.  They are very versatile and could be topped with any type of frosting that you want.  
I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It makes a lot of batter so be prepared to make more than 24 cupcakes.  I made 12 cupcakes and a small round cake.  Next time I'll make a bigger cake because I had so much batter that my cupcakes were overfilled and spread out over the top of the tin.  I had to loosen the baked batter from the cupcake tin before I could get the cupcakes out.  Otherwise this recipe is close to perfect (for me anyway).  I will definitely be making these again!!!!!

AMAZING cupcakes!! I am repeatedly asked to make these. Everyone loves them. Double the frosting. Oh...and once the cupcakes have cooled I use a basting brush to brush a little extra Jameson Irish Whiskey on the tops before I frost them. I also drizzle the filling on top of the frosting for a little added touch.

Thank you for one of THE best recipes I have made off of this site or anywhere for that matter. While I am confident cooking I am not a baker and I always feel a bit intimidated. This recipe made me look like all I do is bake amazing cupcakes. Besides the frosting adjustment, I followed the recipe. My only change will be to make mini cupcakes (yes, even with the filling) because that's what I did with the leftover batter and it was the BOMB. These are amazing cupcakes and I cannot exaggerate how well they were received.

Made for St. Patrick's day party.  Excellent chocolate cake with the Guinness.  Doubled the frosting so they had a nice topping and sprinkled with grated chocolate. EXCELLENT!

In a word, these are divine!  I did increase the frosting amount by 50% as suggested by other reviewers, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I served them with a small dollop of French vanilla ice cream to which I had added Bailey's Irish cream to.  One guest at the St. Patty's day dinner  declared this combo to be the best nightcap ever.

I will probably make these again because they were really moist for a chocolate cupcake. Lot of work to make and add the filling which was really just more chocolate. The ones I didn't have enough filling for were just as good! Even my grandkids liked the Irish cream frosting and the guiness beer was not overpowering.

I used two small mini bottles of Baileys for the icing and it was perfect consistency.   I also used the whole 12oz bottle of Guiness and it worked well.  Everyone loved these cupcakes!!  making again and again.  Ohh and do not refrigerate..they get super dense!

These are to die for.  I made no changes; will make them again when my sister comes to visit.  The apple corer worked perfectly to make the center "hole" where the filling goes.  I suspect the beer in the recipe makes the cupcakes turn out like brownies, so next time I would spray the inside of the cups with cooking spray.

These were amazing! Unfortunately, I was short on time, so I skipped the filling and just made the cupcakes and frosting. It was my boyfriends 40th birthday on Super Bowl Sunday and these disappeared at the party within minutes! Everyone raved about them, including the executive chef of the restaurant I work in! I followed the recipe exactly, using a Chocolate Imperial Stout and Bailey's original. I did add an extra tablespoon of Bailey's just to thin out the icing a bit and make it easier to spread. I will definitely be making these again (probably for St Patrick's Day) and will make sure I leave enough time to make the filling! 5 stars!

I love these cupcakes and so does everyone else!  I use Whipped Cream Frosting (found in AllRecipes)  instead of this one, because it's less sweet and it's my favorite.  People at work always want me to bring these!

These were good. The cake part was very tender,  the filling was a tad too chocolatey for my taste (and I'm a real chocoholic!) but my non -chocoholic husband found it to be perfect. I didn't make the frosting as I found the overall product too sweet. I did fill a few cupcakes with a cream cheese/bailey's/sugar  mixture and I really liked those too, with the chocolate filling used as a ganache on top. I might make these again.

we didn't care for this recipe.  The cupcakes sank after they came out of the oven.  The Chocolate filling was yummy, I used 1/3 cups of beer instead of liquer and simmered it longer to get the right consistency.  The icing I also used beer instead of liquer. All part together the cupcakes were pretty good.

I made this recipe. WOW! The flavor of the cake is rich chocolate, very moist. I have never made a filled cupcake before, but I use a strawberry huller to remove the core. An earlier post mentioned the frosting recipe was not enough for 24 cupcakes, so I increased the quantities by 50%. That worked out well. Additionally, I added 1/2 tsp of Vanilla and 1 Tbsp of Cocoa Powder to the frosting for just a little more flavor and some added color. I will be making this recipe again. Thanks ALLRECIPES.

These cupcakes are awesome! The only thing I changed was I just didn't have any  Irish Whiskey on hand so I used Jack Daniels instead and it turned out fine. They were a hit at my local watering hole!

I've made these cupcakes twice for parties and I love it! Though I did add a tad bit more whiskey in the filling but it's a great recipe. The cake is moist and delicious,  I let the filling sit for a while to thicken the taste is  richer with thick filling

Oh. My. Goodness. 

That's it. Totally worth the little extra work - we doubled the whiskey in the filling, needs 1 1/2 time the frosting recipe to frost them all. These are amazing - even our older kids liked them!

Best cupcake ever! So rich, decadent even. I made the recipe as called for, with the exception of making one and a half times the icing as many other reviews suggested. Usually I can take cupcakes or leave them. I mainly made these for my daughter, who is a cupcake lover of the first order. These were a little more work than your average weekday cupcake, but SO WORTH THE EXTRA EFFORT! I would make these again in a heartbeat! Next time I might make a little extra of the ganache filling, otherwise, YUM! Thanks so much for sharing!

These were delish!!!! The cake was moist.  Was nervous about the filling because we're not fond of whiskey but it was really good.  May cut down on the Baileys for the frosting a little. I thought too much but the others that ate them thought it was fine.  The cake batter made way more than 24 cupcakes.  The only thing I plan on doing differently is allowing more time to complete.  I need more time for the filling to set.  Other than that, perfect!!!!

I will make these again. I made them exactly as directed, the cupcake part.  the icing I did make differently as it clumped up so I had to add milk. I ended up doing a buttercream frosting with the Bailey's - no clue how much I used as I did it to taste.  The filling, even when cooled for an hour was still liquid but a thick liquid, when I filled the cupcake. However, I did place the cooled and frosted cupcakes in the fridge over night. The filling did solidify and was no longer liquid.  The cocoa I used was Hershey's Special Dark and Guinness was the stout I used.  I used 2 teaspoons of the whisky for the filling. Prior to putting the cupcakes in the fridge, the filling had the after taste of the whisky.  But, once it became solid, there was not an after taste. I might up the whisky by 1-2 teaspoons next time.   these were a hit, even my Father In-Law liked them and he does not eat sweats!

Made these cupcakes this afternoon.  OMG....to die for!  So moist and full of flavor.  My only error was that I put the cocoa in with the flour, sugar, etc. so when I was beating the beet mixture, liquid flew out of the bowl as I blended it.  But, there was no problem with the cupcake, just a bit more cleanup on my end.  My St. Patrick's Day guests loved them!!

Made it as written except I didn't read the package of bitter sweet chocolate and only had 4 oz's , it didn't seem to matter. Also I used some coffee mate Irish Cream because I had it on hand. Will make these again for sure.

I have made this recipe many times! It is literally the best cupcake I have ever had in my life (and I love cupcakes). It is really easy to make non-alcoholic as well. I've made these for friends, special events, St. Patty's day, etc. I have even made them for my husbands fellow Marines and they loved it! If you are a fan of the taste of booze and chocolate goodness, this is the cupcake for you my friend.

I enjoyed these cupcakes, but I had a hard time getting the frosting to the right consistency. It was runny and I didn't  want to keep adding powered sugar, so I just went with it. I added just a few drops of Bailey's on top of the filling. Topped with sprinkles and they it helped aesthetics. Definitely, going to try this again!

These taste great. For the filling, you definitely want to take the cream off the heat when mixing in the chocolate. Also, I made minis so I had enough frosting for a dab on each, but I would plan on a double batch if you'd like to make and cover a full sized batch with piping.

These are awesome (RICH!) cupcakes... The recipe I originally used called them "Irish Car Bomb Cupcakes," a name I like better. Only change to this recipe - step #8, don't discard the cores, they are perfectly good to eat!

My most requested cupcake!  I make this at least a 4 times a year.  I make my frosting stiff enough to pipe and then use colored sugar.

Now my go to cupcake! I use this now for all my chocolate cupcakes and just leave out the chocolate in the center and change up the icing. My husband always request I make the “loaded” ones for anything he has to take to work! This one is the most requested cupcake by my friends and family!!!

Worth the work. I added a lot more liquor than what was suggested for the filling and icing

When it comes to making cakes and cupcakaes and brownies, I'm a use-a-mix-that-comes-in-a-box kinda guy and find that a few of the mixes, like Ghirardelli's, are good enough with a few tweaks that I almost never bother making from scratch. So making this was a lot more work than I'm used to for a cupcake. And SO freaking worth it!!!  It came out perfectly and was such a huge hit that I know I'll have to do the work again sometime soon. And it'll be worth it that time too.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and the cupcakes were delicious! The combination of flavors complimented each other perfectly. This was the first time I made a cupcake with filling and I was unsure about how big to make the hole. I will definitely make these again and leave more space for the filling.

Outstanding. They are time consuming but worth it, everyone being eaten. Make sure that you devise a method to core the cupcake, paring knife will do, but I'm sure that there are better alternatives.

I did the cupcakes exactly like you said in the original recipe but I did notice the center feeling was a bit then so I cooked it just as long as it said to but then I put it in the freezer for a little bit so it would for him up a little more so I can fill the cup cakes. I then added the caramel ice cream topping with the Baileys and the sea salt on top as a drizzle for the frosting like Jacqueline posted and folks thought that they were amazing!  The next morning I'm microwaved one for about 8 seconds .... pure heaven.

Didn't have the Irish whiskey, so made the cupcakes without filling. Amazing flavor and they stayed incredibly moist. Nice perk, I was able to use stout from a new local brewery. May have to make them again, just to share with the crew there (sounds like a good enough excuse to me! ??)

Oh my goodness!  So delicious, moist, and full of chocolatey yumminess.  Made the batter as directed.  Made the chocolate filling as directed.  The frosting was made with a maple liqeur, as I didn't have Irish Cream, but it was fantastic.  Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday, and everyone loved it! They were some of the richest, tastiest cupcakes I've ever had. The only suggestion I would make to anyone who wants to make this recipe is to double the amount of frosting you make, or multiply it by 1.5, at least, in order to be able to use the amount shown in the photo. I always like to have plenty of frosting, so I know I won't run out. Would definitely make these again!

These are called Irish car bomb cupcakes. Better without the sour cream in them. And not as much butter.

The cake is delicious. I didn't have sour cream, so I used a toasted vanilla coconut full fat Greek yogurt. That was my only modification to the cake.
I did not make the center this time around - didn't have any whiskey (blasphemy, I know!). Next time I will try to get my hands on some.
The frosting recipe made enough for all of my cupcakes and then some. It was very sweet so I only put a thin layer on the tops, but it was thick enough that you couldn't see cupcake underneath. I was a little disappointed because I read the reviews saying there wasn't enough for all the cakes, and was looking forward to some unfrosted cakes. The only change I made was to add enough Irish cream to make it smooth, maybe a splash or two more.
FYI, these cakes expanded a lot in the oven. If you are using cupcake liners on a regular baking sheet, err on the side of caution and leave a good amount of room between the cakes.

Just finished making these, and they were amazing! I'm a huge fan of the shot that these are based off of (Irish "Car Bomb"/Irish Trainwreck). I couldn't get the icing to the consistency that I would have liked, seemed a little too runny even after cupcakes had been completely cooled. Ended up with a LOT of icing/filling leftover, so the recipe seems a little overkill on those two things, but other than that these are delicious and highly recommended!

Icing seems to be awfully sweet to me, so I made half of them with icing and half without. Anyway, these cupcakes are just great, thanks to the author a lot!

These were the most fantastic cupcakes I've ever tasted! I brought them to a party and everyone who had one said they were the best cupcakes they'd ever had as well. I originally wanted to find something simple, but these are totally worth the time and effort. The filling was a bit much for some people, but very decadent and delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and skipped the filling for the cupcakes.  They were moist and very flavorful.  I also used only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and 2 tablespoons of Bailey's in the icing, and still had enough frosting for all 24 cupcakes.

Made these for St. Patrick's Day and they were amazing! Followed recipe exactly. It doesn't make a lot of icing so you might need to make more. It takes a while for the icing to go from chunky to creamy, so don't freak out when beating it.

Awesome! Made it as an Adult only Christmas Eve treat. Everyone loved them. Next time I would make half the ganache and increase the icing. I got 30 cupcakes out of one batch.

These were very good! The chocolate cake, to me, was a bit dry, but usually homemade cakes (especially chocolate) are. The flavors all went together well, and there was no strong alcohol taste, which was nice. I do have to admit that I do prefer boxed chocolate ckae mix to homemade, so I may just use that next time, and sub the Guinness for the water called for and see how that turns out. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were amazing and everyone that I gave one to said it was the best cupcake they had ever had!
I didn't use whiskey, used butterscotch schnapps once and Bailey's the other time, both tasted great!  I had way too much filling left, maybe I was just too skimpy, but next time I may half it as I am not much of a chocolate syrupy kinda person.
My husbands review... after he tried one I asked, "Did you like it?" He says it was ok (as he is putting 6 more on his plate) then asks, "Are there anymore?" :)
