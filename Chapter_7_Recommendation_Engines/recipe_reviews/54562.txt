This recipe is amazing! I doubled the recipe, but kept the fruit in the same amount & it was the perfect ratio. I feel like if there was less liquid (as called for in the original quantity of the recipe), it would be too chunky & perhaps difficult to drink.

The flavor of this was just right! Yum!

**Also, just a little tip for anyone who hasn't thought of it: Instead of adding the soda into the pitcher, I just topped off each glass with a splash of it as I served them, so the soda wouldn't go flat throughout the evening! This worked great!**

The real deal!  Delicious. Took this to a party and it was gone in minutes.  Try adding a little sugar if the red wine is too dry.

I made a triple batch of this sangria and thought maybe I had made too much but by the end of the evening it was gone and people were asking for more.  At first it was too tart so I added a bit of sugar and that smoothed it right out.  Yummy.

I have a very similar recipe that I use: without cherries, lemon or lime, but with a 6oz can or pineapple juice and 1/4 cup of brandy is replaced with orange liqueur. It's delicious!

Excellent recipe, with some changes.  

1) Left out the cherries and pineapple. 
2) Used cherry brandy. 
3) Doubled the red wine, OJ, and soda.

Served in a punch bowl and it was demolished very quickly.

I followed this recipe to the T with the exception of the apple and it was amazing! Everyone loved it! I only had time to have the fruit soaking in the brandy for one hour...but I can imagine what it would have been like had I soaked the fruit for the two hours or overnight! The cherries were expensive...but well worth it.

Are you bloody kidding me?!  This was incredible!  I used to have bartender made sangria all the time in bistros in Quebec City.  They were delicious.  Then when I moved to Colorado, it was not served and lost touch with this excellent elixir.  Move forward almost 15 years later, I go back to Quebec City just to realize that most people use a prepared mix (like margarita mix) and just add wine; what a travesty!  So I looked up this recipe and...WOW!  For those of you who have read some of my reviews I always make the recipes AS IS, at least the first time.  Well, in this case, I could not find fresh pineapple and did not want the canned version, so I unfortunately had to leave it out.
The outcome.... even a doubled recipe DISAPPEARED in less than a half-hour!  Now I call that a stamp of approval.  Here is a nice little trick though.  If you've macerated the fruit in the brandy for the required amount of time, and don't server a lot of them in the actual drink, you can make a new batch in a pinch.  Ok, it will not be "as good" as the first one, but it is better than not having sangria!!!
Thank you so much for the recipe and having rekindled my love of sangria.

Delicious and potent. I added a mixture of fruit and as a personal preference, I would not use citrus or apple. Next time I will stick to blueberries, raspberries and cherries.

This was wonderful and I did add a little sugar like the other reviewers suggested. It felt like I was actually making the wine from scratch!!

Loved this Sangria, but I would make one or two suggestions.  I usually use Carl Rossi wine when making sangria simply because I find the fruit balances out the bitterness of the wine and it's very inexpensive! Also a GREAT tip I came across when making sangria (white or red) is to keep it chilled place frozen grapes instead of ice cubes so that the drink will not become diluted as they melt. Cheers!

I cannot thank you enough for posting this recipe!  I have used it many many times over the past couple years since I first found it and never fail to get less than stellar reviews from my guests.  The only thing I change is the types of fruit.  I always use apples/oranges/lemons/limes, but sometimes vary the others depending on what looks good at the market.  The only one that didn't work is dragonfruit.  Don't waste the money because it doesn't hold up in the liquid and doesn't add any flavor.   Otherwise, go crazy with the fruit.  The more the merrier and different colors and textures just make it tastier and prettier!

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!  Got the recipe from a friend who made it for a weekend away.  I was nervous because the recipe sounded complicated but it couldn't have been easier.  Make sure you soak the fruit long enough and that its all covered.  I made it for 40 servings and put the finished product in one of those 50 gallon orange coolers.  I omitted the cherries and bought the pre-sliced pinapples.  I also added pears  I used 7 bottles of assorted red wines and 1 bottle of brandy.  It was amazing and we finished it off in one night.  We were sad when there was not more left the next day!

WOW - this was really good!  The only change I made was to add the 7-up to the glass before adding the Sangria, if you can't use the whole batch right away.

This was great!  I omitted the pineapple (I just don't care for it), and had to use maraschino cherries because the grocery store didn't have fresh.  I also used plain soda water because I thought the lemon lime soda would be too sweet.

This was a very good recipe, but not as good as Classic Spanish Sangria from this site. I did not add apples because I've noticed in the past that they soak up too much of the liquor. I added frozen strawberries and blueberries instead. I followed everything else exactly except for using white rum instead of brandy since I don't keep brandy on hand. Even with the fruit and orange juice, I found that after letting it sit, it was very tart. Perhaps it was the type of dry red wine I used? I had to make a simple syrup to stir in to add some sweetness. All in all, a good recipe but I might just stick with the other one I've tried from allrecipes.com. I loved the idea of using pineapple chunks though and will continue to do that! FYI: I'm fairly certain that "the Pros" use cranberry juice in their sangria. I know for sure that Olive Garden does!

I made this yesterday leaving out the cherries and pineapple. I didn't have them on hand. I followed the directions as stated but the only thing I did different was I added the soda to the glass I was serving instead of the pitcher due to the fact that I'm the only one drinking it. Hubby doesn't like wine. I didn't want the soda to go flat being it would sit in the fridge a couple days. Other than that , delish!!!!

I like this recipe because it requires few ingredients.  I only used the citrus fruits and peaches and it was delicious.  Great summer beverage.

Used this recipe along with Classic Sangria recipe I wanted to do a taste comparison between a brandy sangria and a rum sangria. Both are good but I preferred the Classic Sangria one. It used rum instead of brandy and didn't taste as boozy. It was much smoother.

I like this recipe. It was very tasty. The fruit was a bit chunky for me. I ended up draining the finished brew and adding fresh fruit to the cocktails I served for presentation.

I varied the fruit some, not everthing is available this time of year.  I also added a little extra sprite and a cup or so of chardonay I wanted to use up.  Everyone liked it!

So good.  I am so happy I did not take my aunt's suggestion and just buy pre-made sangria from the liquor store!  The only variation from the original recipe was that I did not use pineapples - just didn't think it sounded that good.  I soaked the fruit in the brandy overnight - whoa!  Strong!!!  I think I was buzzed after just a few sips (although I was munching on the fruit too so that might have had something to do with it).  I also took some of the other reviewers' suggestion to top off each glass with the lemon-lime soda.  This worked well not only to ensure the fizz, but also allowed people to dilute the sangria (or not) to their individual taste.  My father-in-law kept going for glass after glass... he preferred his without soda!

Very good and very potent. I love it, my husband doesn't. He isn't a huge red wine fan though so he doesn't count. I'm actually feeling the buzz off of it right now. It's very good and fun to make.

Delicious. I skipped the apples and used marischino (is that spelled right?) cherries. I'm making it again soon!

Double, triple or quadruple this recipe or you will certainly run out!  I left the soda out and offered it as an option for people to add to their glasses, most did not.  Wonderful recipe!

This was a fabulous sangria.  I used an inexpensive cabernet that I had in my wine frig along with triple sec in place of brandy.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  It was not too tart nor too sweet.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I love Sangria and love this recipe!  Since I'm not a dry red wine fan, I took other's suggestions and used Lambrusco for a little sweetness.  Although many people haven't had it this way, I love my sangria with berries.  I used strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, grapes and apples. It is it more expensive, but for a berry lover, it is well worth it!

This recipe is idiot proof!  I soaked the fruit for two days in the brandy.  I also used ginger ale.  After this batch was gone in about 45 minutes, I made another with the remaining, booze-soaked fruit, wine, cranberry juice, OJ, ginger ale and a healthy splash of brandy.  People at my party said it was the best sangria they ever had!  This GREAT to make if you're having a large party on a tight budget.

Very delicious recipe. If you decide to double it, the fruit amount will still be sufficient enough. 
someone asked about the wine:
I used Cabernet Sauvignon, but I'm sure Merlot or a red Zinfandel would be great also. You don't have to spend too much. Trader Joe's Charles Shaw ( two buck chuck ) tastes great for this recipe.

I, personally, LOVE Sangria. My bf, on the other hand, had never tried it before. I used this recipe and made him try it (It was also my first time ever making home-made Sangria!). This recipe was pretty good! I did have to add some sugar afterward to balance out the tartness of it. But overall a recipe worth making.

This ended up being a HUGE hit at a New Years party!  As others suggested, I doubled the recipe (using an inexpensive Pinot Noir) and kept the fruit about the same. I also ended up leaving the pineapple and cherries out, and used 2 apples (one green and one red).  It was not quite sweet enough for my taste when all was said and done, so I added some sugar and the lemon lime soda (20oz botttle).  Let's just say that I can't wait to make this again!!!!!!

I doubled this recipe for a party and it was good, but not great. It tasted a bit bitter to me. I used nectarines instead of the cherries and pineapple. For the liquor, I used 1/2 cup brandy & 1/4 cup triple sec insead of all brandy. I put all the fruit, brandy, and OJ in a bag in the fridge to marinate overnight. I added the wine in the morning and then the Sprite right before we served. It tasted a little bitter so I added extra OJ and an extra can of Sprite. It helped a bit but next time I'll either add sugar or leave out the lemon and lime to make it just a touch sweeter.

I may have had to modify it a bit for the amount that I actually had to make but I think I stuck to the heart of the recipe and it was fabulous!  Add a touch of cinnamon for something extra.

Way too much fruit, even without the lime, lemon and cherries, which I did not have on hand. Cut fruit by half. Pretty good, but needs sugar. I will try again, but won't add lemon or lime as I find that tends to add too much bitterness to the Sangria.

The recipe is easy to make! It seems, however, that the ratio of liquid to fruit is kind of off. I had so much fruit in mine that I could barely fit all the liquid (and I didn't even use all the suggested fruit). Make sure you use a very large pitcher to make this mix! Also, I did add sugar to the recipe and it made it much tastier!

I made this last Friday with a few alterations. I used Lambrusco red wine, soaked red seedless grapes, sliced apples, and oranges in malibu rum instead of the brandy. I did use a can of sprite and a cup of orange juice, like the recipe states, but did not include lemon, lime or pineapple and i didnt crush any of the fruit. IT WAS AWESOME!!! My friend and I drank the whole pitcher! I will definitely make this again soon.

HOLY COW!!! This could very well give me a drinking problem.  I revised slightly and failed to read the directions...I didn't soak for 2 hours but it was still phenomenal.
I used Franzia chillable red (a box makes about 5 pitchers of this).
Omitted the pineapple - love it but sounded weird for sangria.
Spiced rum (way good)instead of brandy. 
Frozen can OJ and then just took a 1/4 chunk out and lopped it in the pitcher.
2 cans of 7up/Sprite to "smooth out" - if you plan to drink the whole pitcher pour in right away. Otherwise, as suggested (great idea) top individual drinks off so it doesn't go flat.

I subsituted the fruit in the recipe with a pear, an apple, maraschino cherries and an orange.  I only let the fruit soak for about four hours but it was still delicious!  I served it hanging out with friends in the afternoon and they all loved it.  Later that night I went out to dinner at a tapas restaurant with some friends and we got a pitcher of their sangria which was good but nowhere as good as this recipe!  This recipe has the potential to be very potent but the drunk fruit is delicious!

I made this for a hot camping trip and it was perfectly refreshing!  This will be my go to, when entertaining in the summer!!  I too doubled the batch and kept the fruit the same, then also added mango and blueberries!

i've never made sangria before... happily consumed it but never embarked on making it.  truthfully it seemed a bit intimidating.
but after reading this recipe and the reviewers feedback and suggestions,  what a perfect sangria. i was just looking for simple
and drinkable but this surpassed that and was so incredibly tasty & yummy...  & yes, it's even better then the restaurant sangria i'm use to.
thank u!

Made this for a friend's birthday party and everyone LOVED it.  I doubled the liquid in the recipe with no problem but didn't double *all* the fruit.  The apples and cherries are a must.  Also, used a nice tempranillo wine so there was no need to add sugar.

This recipe is awesome!  The only thing that I did different was double the liquids, and I used Lambrusco instead of dry red wine.  So good!

Outstanding! Everyone loved it. Having lived in Spain, it brought back great memories of "fiestas campestres" and finding relief from the heat with this refreshing beverage. Very authentic recipe! Thank you.

I usually make the sangria! sangria! recipe from this site and never have felt the need to make anything else, because that recipe is wonderful! Anyway, this sounded so good with the addition of apples and pineapples! I doubled this (used Merlot) and went ahead and doubled fruit also. I would not double fruit again. I basically had a fruit salad with some wine in it! ;-) I did really like this as I said (except for the fruit salad part), but will stick with sangria sangria recipe!

Yummy!  Much easier than others I've tried.  I only used the citrus fruits and added the Sprite at serving. If you have left overs to store for later, I'd recommend removing the fruit first. The rinds can make it bitter after a bit.

This was fantastic!  I added a lot more soda and orange juice than the recipe called for.  I also added some sugar water to made it sweeter for our tastes.  The "drunk" fruit is really tasty too!

I thought this was too dry. I would add some sugar, but that's my taste. If you like dry red wine, you may like it. My guests did like it but I prefer white wine sangria. I was very easy to make though.

Pretty much made this as written and can't think of anything that would've made it better. Maybe some cinnamon sticks. The sangria was neither too sweet nor too dry, and the brandy and orange juice added a nice complexity. Used a Sangiovese for the wine.

As mentioned in another review - it is awesome, but there's not enough liquid.  Double the liquid, keep the fruit the same.

I juiced the lemon and lime as my trial batch became bitter, used canned pineapple because it was faster, and skipped the cherries as they were out of season. I removed the oranges from leftover sangria to keep it from becoming bitter.  I added a little more sprite.  I used Cul de sac's merlot for one batch and Beringer's  red moscato for the other. Both came out great, but the merlot looked darker/prettier.  I will definitely use this recipe for all my future sangrias.

I didn't use pineapple chunks, I used lime, peach, plum, apple & cherries. Pineapple juice and honey brandy. This was delicious and a big hit. Served it with my husband's wonderful bbq ribs & broccoli salad & roasted corn on the cob! We finished the pitcher.

Doubled the recipe, used a value Australian Syrah, half peach brandy half VSOP. Served in large glass dispenser. Would say the frozen pitted cherries really added depth. Just terrific. Well balanced without being too sweet. I soaked the fruit for about 3 hrs in covered glass bowl to allow fruit to more fully submerge in the brandy. Truly a pro recipe.
