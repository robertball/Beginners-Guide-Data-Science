While I may not be the first to make this I am very happy to be the first to review it. As with any recipe I make for the first time I try to follow the directions as written and I'm glad I did. This was fantastic! The cake came out wonderful, very moist and flavorful. The bacon and cheese topping really accentuated the dish perfectly. I baked this in a glass dish so I cut the temp to 325 and it ended up taking about 28 minutes to cook. I highly recommend using real maple syrup not the cheap stuff as it really added a sweet flavor without over powering the dish. We made this for dinner and I can't wait to make it again for a family brunch! Thank you for the recipe!!!

My kids said I had to review this & give it 5 stars! For picky kids who aren't always in love with breakfast casserole, they devoured it! This was a huge hit for our entire family. I made no changes & I wouldn't make them in the future either!

I made this for Easter brunch. what a successful and tasty dish. I did however make some adjustments. I added cooked, crumbled sausage to the wet batter. I reserved half of the sausage and added to the top with the bacon and cheese. I didn't have pure maple syrup so I used maple flavored syrup. The dish was divine! Served with pancake syrup on top it was devoured.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good, but certainly not a 5-star.  There was something about it that is a little off.  It is basically a cake with some cheese and bacon on top.  The word "casserole" in the name threw me off a little.  It is not what I consider a casserole.  If I were to make it again, I would leave the cheese off of the top.  The crumbled bacon is a good flavor with maple syrup, but cheese is just weird with syrup.  This was a trial run to decide whether to make this in the cabin for Thanksgiving breakfast with our family, and I am not feeling real confident about it.

This was really good, but a little too cheesy for us (which is blasphemy coming from me - we LOVE CHEESE!!) I would just tweak slightly and this would be perfect for us (and I'm positive I will make this again)! First of all, I used Johnsonville maple sausage breakfast links in place of the bacon because it sounded like a match made in heaven (and it was SO GOOD with the flavor of the casserole!) Next time I would blend the cooked and diced sausage into the batter and leave the cheese on top off (but still blend in a cup of cheese). Then serve with warm maple syrup drizzled over the top. Perfection! Love this breakfast casserole for something different!

I also only used 1 tablespoon of sugar in the batter

I have made this many times now, often doubling the recipe because my family devours it. I don't always use all of the bacon, but other than that I follow the recipe. It's a good weeknight meal that even my picky ten year old will eat.

Really tasty! The whole family enjoyed it and was easy to make. We habitually add extra cheese to all recipes but I would not recommend that for this one. Too much cheese overpowers the pancake & bacon flavors. Enjoy!

I made exactly half portions of all ingredients and made it in the smaller 8x8 pan. Gives 4 nice sized servings. The dish was nice for something different.

Very good and filling, followed the recipe as is. I liked and also agree to use real maple syrup, but to make it even more filling I scrambled 8 eggs and cooked then put on top of cake after taking out of the oven and sprinkled the bacon and cheese then popped back in till melted and served with some sliced peaches. I have 4 small boys and they devoured it and wanted seconds!

Absolutely delicious. I did use less bacon than suggested and it turned out great. Instead of crumbling, I just left the strips over the top in an even distribution and it turned out just fine. This casserole reheats extremely well.

Yummmmy!! Made like some other reviewers said—no cheese on top, but l did drizzle some extra syrup over as it cooled. The maple smell was so delicious, and the casserole was a real hit!! Easy to make, too, so it will definitely be part of our recipe roulette!!

Pretty tasty breakfast!  Just a bit dry. But no problem if you sizzle a bit more maple syrup.

Made this for my Christmas breakfast this past Saturday and everyone loved it they were thrown off by the cheese but once they tasted it they no longer cared it was so good . The next time i make this however, i will use less cheese but overall this is a great breakfast dish !! Also i added bacon crumbles in the mixture as well and then topped off with crumbled bacon and it was delicious !!!

I made this casserole the morning after Thanksgiving. It was good. There's a light syrup taste that compliments this breakfast. I will make this gain.

My kids can be picky eaters but they always seem to like pancakes even for dinner so I decided to try this recipe out. I followed this recipe exactly but I added 1lb of cooked grounded maple sausage to the batter before I baked it because my husband always wants more meat at dinner time. We also drizzled some maple syrup on top after it was done cooking. This casserole was amazing and my picky kids ate it up! I also made it for a friend after she just had a baby and she loved it and asked me for the recipe. I serve it with cheesy grits and it makes an amazing meal for breakfast or dinner!

This was doughy and had no flavor, other than the bacon on top. We ended up just eating the cheesy bacon off the top and throwing away the rest. I will not make this again.

Came out really good!  I'll prolly add some more maple syrup and include breakfast sausage as well.  This will definitely be a regular on the breakfast menu!

I loved this recipe.  It was a great way to change up our Saturday morning breakfast and this is definitely a keeper!!  the only thing I changed was the milk to almond milk bc we have some lactose sensitive bellies around here but it was still delicious.  my two year old who is usually funny about eggs and pancakes gobbled this up.  my husband thought it lacked a little "breakfast essence" bc it is more like a cake so I just served a little eggs and bacon the side and everyone was happy.  thanks!!

My family and I thought this was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little too sweet, but all in all it was filling and easy to make.

Thought this would be a hit with my kids as they love pancakes, Not so much. Something just seemed a little off about the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as directed.

This was wonderful!  The whole family chowed down and I didn't have to fight my daughter to eat it.  I recommend a drizzling syrup over the top when serving.  Highly recommend!

This was delicious.  I used a splenda mix for the sugar, turkey bacon and regular pancake mix.  So easy!

Made this for Sunday brunch and my husband loved it. I added scrambled eggs on top with the bacon as well just for a little more yummyness.
