My family has had this cake for YEARS at every holiday or other get-together in the summer!  You can use any variation you want!  I cut some of the milk to make the topping a bit thicker, and I use yellow cake, with cherry jello and Faygo Redpop. SO many variation possibilities with this recipe!  I love it!

This cake is so versatile.  I change anyone of 2 or 3 all 4 of these ingredients (cake, soda pop, jello, pudding) and have a totally different cake, depending on what occasion I need a desert!

I needed a cake for an office luncheon and I chose this one based on all the great reviews.  It was gobbled up in no time.  Everyone raved! I let the jello mixture get cold (but not jelled) before pouring it over the cake (to which I poked holes).  
I always make cake mixes with the "Cake Mix Extender" recipe, which produces a higher and lighter cake.  I did the same for the Pop Cake and got fabulous results.  Here's what you do:  
Mix the cake according to box directions.  To the batter, add 1 C. flour; 3/4 C. sugar; 1/2 C. vegetable oil; and 2/3 C. water.  Mix well.  If using a 9X13 pan, bake about an extra 15 min. 
I'm headed to the kitchen to make another Pop Cake for my family.  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious! I had my doubts about using the big box of jello but it turned out great. Meant to take a picture but it was eaten before I had a chance. Next time!

I used a yellow cake mix and orange Jello. The "frosting" only needed one cup of milk--two would have made it too runny. I topped the cake with drained mandarin oranges. Not for adults--psh. This is my go-to summer cake. Any kind of jello or soda you use, it always turns out fantastic. My family LOVES this dessert, the adults especially.

GREAT versatile recipe. This is most requested recipe this summer. I have made it with several different flavors of jello and they were all great. Fun recipe!

This is a very versatile cake.  I think it is great for kids, but not for adults with developed palates.  It would be a great summer treat for everyone. I made it for superbowl makingit in Chicago colors. I guess we had too much other food because no one really touched it.  I may try again in the future.

What isn’t to love about cold, refrigerated Jell-O® cake?  This recipe has been sitting, faceless, since July 2004.  I am happy that I was able to add a face.  I made a half batch of this cake as we don’t need an entire cake for 2 people!  I did use diet soda, and sugar-free Jell-O® and sugar-free pudding and the cake was delicious.  The pudding added a nice texture to the cake.  You could make this versatile cake with any soda, gelatin and pudding flavors you wanted.  This was a good choice for our dessert tonight.

Delicious. I made the cake for a birthday party and since I wasn't sure how the cake decorations would fare on soft whipped topping, I omitted the pudding/milk mix and frosted with buttercream icing instead of whipped cream.

I use a straw to poke holes in the cake, that way more of the gelatin gets into each piece. It also makes it look pretty.

I've never made a poke cake before, but I should have followed my instincts when I was pouring the jello liquid over the cake, it seemed like way to much, and it was.  This turned out to be a solid red, jello soaked cake for me.  I looked back to make sure I followed the measurements and directions, and couldn't see where I'd made a mistake.

I made this cake almost as it is written, but mistakenly used only one box of Jello on top. It still turned out wonderful. The pudding and Cool Whip topping is a nice light frosting.
