Great way to make baked apples even better! I was trying to avoid adding extra sugar so I used sugar free instant oatmeal packets. One was Apple Cinnamon and the other was Maple & Brown Sugar.  Each packet had 1/2 cup of oats and I just added the teaspoon of cinnamon to them before adding the butter. Also, I cooked these in a loaf pan so that they would sit up and not fall over on a cookie sheet.

I had 4 apples that would have gone bad in the next day or two...Found this recipe, and let me tell you this was delicious!!! 30 minutes was just perfect.  Also a scoop of vanilla ice cream sends it over the top. I know, I know don't change the recipe, but it did scream for ice cream.

Tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked at 30 minutes.  The house smelled wonderful while these apples were in the oven.  This one takes me back to my childhood when baked apples were typically the first thing my mother cooked to welcome the Fall season.  I scaled this down to two servings, but I must have had small apples because there was enough filling left over to cook two additional.  Served with a drizzle of maple syrup and thoroughly enjoyed.

Very good as presented. I didn't have butter when I made this today so used peanut butter. That was a great variation!

Delicious ~ made as directed using Macintosh apples. Buttery, lightly crisp oat filling was yummy; and did make enough for one extra apple. Four stars given for the time it takes to core apples, otherwise taste is delectable!

Note to the reviewer whose apples "imploded" -- perhaps a baking apple was needed ~ Rome beauty, Granny Smith, Macintosh. Any type one would use for a pie should work best.

I baked the apples in individual foil boats.  There was more oatmeal mixture than could fit inside the apples, so the boats kept the "filling" contained and made them easy to serve.  I served them with vanilla bean ice cream.  Yummy!

This was an extra ordinary recipe. Baked apples surpassed what I expected. We had for breakfast and it by itself was filling. I followed instructions exactly just added crushed blackberries since we had plenty.

This was a delicious and very easy breakfast. I would make the well in the apples bigger and/or heap more of the oatmeal filling on top, because I ended up with two apples' worth of extra filling.

I liked it, but was hoping for a softer Apple. I used Lady Alice apples.  To serve it however, I thought it’d be easier served later open and then cut into bite sized pieces.  Then I got to thinking, why wouldn’t I bake it pre-cut and then dump the topping on top?  Then I’d basically have an apple crisp.  Next time, I may bake the apples for 20 min and then add the mixture, bake another 30.

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe. I had a little filling left over and I just spooned it around the apples. This is a good recipe and I would make it again!

I made it exactly  like the recipe using Fiji apples, but it did not work. Not done after 30 minutes and not done after 20 more minutes of cooking. If a specific apple type was needed, it should have said so.

This was pretty good. Hard to go wrong with tasty ingredients like these. I just had one apple that wasn't fresh enough to eat raw, so I wanted an easy way to cook it up. I pretty much just mixed up some cinnamon, oats, brown sugar, and butter, and patted it in the apple. I ended up piling some on top - even with scaling down, there was a lot of filling. I pulled it out after 25 minutes because I didn't want the loose topping to burn, and I thought the one apple would cook faster, and it was done enough to enjoy. Could have benefited from the full cooking time, but I'm not exactly known as a patient cook :P

every bite was delicious. I used a glass  rectangular baking dish to make four apples for the weeks breakfast. Once they were spotted, I did not get to eat a second one! Next time I will hide them in the refrigerator... Yummy

Super easy and tasty. Hardest part was coring the apples since I don't have an apple corer. Used HoneyCrisp apples and cut down on the oats to 3/4 cup with other ingredients about the same.  Also added a dash of All Spice.

I decreased the recipe, as I was making it for one.  Also, microwaved for 4 min 45 sec instead of baking.  It was delicious, and just right.

I followed directions to the letter and all four apples imploded in 20 minutes in the oven.   Not edible unless you mopped them up with a spoon.

Alter reading the reviews I decided to cut the filling back to two portions for three apples but there was still plenty leftover. I made this as written with the exception of using Earth Balance® in place of the butter. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

They were very tasty, but needed to be cooked longer. I baked them at 350 covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes more, and they still weren't soft enough.

Omitted the brown sugar and drizzled with maple syrup just before serving. Baked an additional 5 minutes & apples were still a little crunchy. Tasted just fine & will make again. I used Honeycrisp apples. Another type would bake up softer if that is the way you like it.

Delicious!! I used less sugar just per taste. Next time I’ll make a separate bowl of oatmeal because it just made me crave more oatmeal. But otherwise made it according to recipe. Very good!

I cut my apples in half and filled them open-face style. They were delicious. Used honeycrisp, should have baked them for 10 more minutes.  Served with a side of caramel sauce.

Wasn't big on this and I love apple anything. 2 stars because we at least ate it. Didn't like how the oats were so coarse and the brown sugar just clumped with the oats. Maybe grinding the oats, or using less oats and adding WW flour, but overall decreasing the ratio of dry ingredients. There was also WAY to much filling for 4 average sized apples that were just voted and not completely hollowed out. We won't make these again.

I used a pouch of apple cinnamon oatmeal mix and mixed that with pieces of the apple I scooped out.  One pouch makes enough for two small apples.  I still added the butter as listed and topped it with just a bit of brown sugar and more cinnamon.  Turned out great!

I love, love, love eating apples made this way. I cant imagine why someones imploded in the oven.  First, I only hand eat Honey Crisp apples, if another kind gets into the bin at the store & I miss it, I'll definitely  fix it like this.  Then I mostly microwave mine, cuz I want it soon; & I guess everyone likes theirs done to different degrees.  I like it barely cooked, or cooked, but not mushy at all.  I cut down on the sugar, use a little Smart Balance or coconut oil (I know its saturated) & lots of cinnamon.  Really good thing to eat anytime !!

Not the best recipe. The oatmeal was clumpy and dry after baking. I would have preferred the filling to be more saucy and moist. I used Fiji apples and they were not cooked all the way after 30 min. I will try wrapping them in foil next time to keep the oatmeal moist and cook the apple better.

So  simple, So easy !    I halved ingredients in recipe because I only wanted to make 2 apples.  So awesome. Next time, I'm gonna add some chopped pecans or walnuts, just for added protein.

My hubby loved these. Added raisins to the oatmeal mix to give the apples more texture. Will definitely make this again.

Shrunk the recipe since I only wanted to make 3 apples. But there was so much ‘stuffing’ that I ended up making 4. And still had plenty of leftover. My husband tasted the leftover filling and remarked how good it tasted - he wants to use this filling, add hot water and make a bowl of brown sugar cinnamon oatmeal with it!

This was amazing!  I added a smidgen more cinnamon and doubled the batch for 6 apples.
