Delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter except I used only 1 large onion (2 seemed like a bit much) and I omitted the slivered almonds (didn't have any on hand).  The  spice flavours were strong but not overpowering.  The recipe is *definitely* a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

11.8.19  What a smooth, creamy, savory, and somewhat rustic soup.  I don’t think cauliflower on its own has a lot of taste, roasting certainly helps, but that’s OK.  The curry flavor adds a lot of interest and is the star, and it indeed shines!  The potato did a great job adding texture and thickening.  Served today with a scoop of tuna salad on lettuce along with fresh sliced tomatoes, hard boiled egg slices, and crackers  Since this is pureed, I also can see this served cold as an appetizer in a small bowl.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it gets a thumbs up in this house.
