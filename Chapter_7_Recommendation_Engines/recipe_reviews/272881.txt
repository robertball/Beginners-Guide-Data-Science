Simple and straight forward just as rice should be in my opinion. I'm not a huge rice fan and  don't typically care for jasmine  but hubs loves it so I make it for him often. He loved the addition of Sriracha and the Sriracha made the rice tolerable for me. It really mellows out the flowery taste of the rice. I'll be using this recipe for jasmine from now on. Thanks!
