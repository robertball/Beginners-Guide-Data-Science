I had to give this a rating even though I failed to add the key ingredients because it still turned out so well.  Due to grandma's inability to eat anything remotely spicy, I did not add the peppercorns or pepper.  I fried the squid in a layer of vegetable oil in a pan, rather than deep frying it.  My kids gobbled it up.  I cut the juvenile squid into 1/2 inch rings, left the tentacles as is, and tossed the whole thing into the mix of cornstarch, flour, and salt, which was in a ziplock bag.  After thoroughly shaking to coat everything, I poured the whole thing into a sieve and shook it until all the excess coating came off, sort of like panning for gold.  Then I dumped the whole thing into the pan.  I practically stir fried the squid, but the coating still stuck.  Then I placed the oily rings between paper towels.  The oil soaked up four layers of Bounty paper towels, even though it didn't look very greasy.  I will definitely be making this again.  Maybe it turned out so tender because the squid was so young--the bodies were no more than 5 inches long.  I can't wait to cook this without Grandma around so I can add some spices.

simple yet effective. I found this recipe to be a great base to work from. I added a tsp of cayenne pepper to my flour mixture which gave the squid a nice kick. I also made a chili garlic sauce that really made this dish a hit .

I did not care for this recipe. I was very excited to make it because I love squid.....but all I could taste was cornstarch. I was curious why the recipe even called for it....just flour seasoned the way you like it works just fine!

I found this dish to be ok, it didn't have enough flavour for my liking. Next time I will use half the amount of flour and double the pepper.

Quite good and easy.  I didn't have time or energy to cook the salt and pepper beforehand so I just added them to flour and cornstarch uncooked and coated both squid and some shrimp.  I lightly spread oil on hot pan and fried on each side for about 4 min instead of deep frying.  Tasted really good

I think I am doing something wrong.  I am looking to duplicate the pepper salted squid served on Sandy Blvd in Portland Oregon (Thien Hong)  I have moved to Texas so I can't ask them.  I am using more mature squid but have a difficult time getting the crunchy texture and it certainly cooks longer than 30 secs!  I have even tried a deep fryer.  Adding about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and serving with wilted green onions gets me closer to my desired results.

Yum.  I've tried to duplicate salt & pepper squid from restaurants, but it was always too salty.  This is perfect.  I didn't have szechuan peppers, but used combination of black and red.  Crunchy and good!

Delicious! I used squid rings that only had to be defrosted and rinsed. I didn't have Szechwan peppercorns so I substituted cayenne pepper. My family loved it and I'll definitely be making it again!

I found the recipe "as is" to be terribly salty. I changed the szechuan pepper/salt ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 and was much happier with the results. Have also taken the lazy way out and used commercial tempura mix, added two heaping tablespoons of the szechuan pepper/salt mixture  to the tempura batter then dipped the squid in and deep fried. Really happy with the results and thanks to individual who originally posted the recipe for pointing me in the general direction of where I wanted to go.
