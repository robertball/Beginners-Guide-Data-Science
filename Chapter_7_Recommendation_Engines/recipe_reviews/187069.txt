I used dum-dum suckers in place of the sticks with gumdrops for ease of assembly.  Everyone thought they were adorable and were excited that they got a bonus treat with the sucker!

These cupcakes are super cute when all is said and done.  I watched the Betty Crocker video on this site of how to prepare them so I think the visual helped quite a bit.  The recipe reads that the gumdrops are small, but in the picture and what was said in the video called for large gumdrops.  It was too late when I discovered and they still came out cute.  Hope you have some time on your hands, but the mother-to-be will love them. :) I recommend lemon cake with lemon frosting, vanilla cake with vanilla frosting, both baked at 325 degrees & they will stay moist for a long time! *Use a new razor blade to cut a small hole thru cupcake liner (on baked cupcake) & it makes it so much easier to get the sucker stick inside.

We made these for my daughters baby shower and they were absolutely darling. We let people design their own and it was a lot of fun seeing all of the different designs.

A huge hit!  I used Dum Dums as suggested by another reviewer.  They looked great and made assembly quick and easy!  I recommend using a toothpick to poke holes in the paper cups before inserting the suckers so that the paper doesn't rip.  I used strawberry cake mix for a girl-themed shower, and everyone loved it!
