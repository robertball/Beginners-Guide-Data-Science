Delicious!
It's often impractical for me to make a recipe exactly as written, but I came close by making substitutions with what I had at hand. Since it's harvest time now, I chopped tomatoes from our garden (not pureed). Also, I used our Swiss Chard instead of spinach. 
I had dried tortellini on the shelf.  Since I wasn't sure what the equivalent quantity of that would be, I just used the entire 8 ounce bag.  It seemed to be the right amount.  
I used only 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning.
Even though this made a very thick and hearty soup, my husband liked it so much that he went back for seconds.

Mmmm  I cannot find enough words to say how delicious this was so I'll just say.. mmmm. I made my own puree out of fire roasted tomatoes and used a vegetarian sausage as I had some leftover in the freezer.. mine sliced instead of crumbled

Pretty good. I think I would use hot Italian sausage next time to give a bit more spice.
