Having been given our family traditional PR recipes, I always switch this up a bit...First after oil in skillet, brown tiny bits of ham or Canadian bacon or pork til just cracklin'....Sprinkle wih some Adobo seasoning...Then add bits of diced onion, tiny bits of potatoes, and then turn down heat some and add 1 or 2 ( I add 2 ) pkts Sazon....combine..then add a good 1 or 2 tbls Sofrito.  Combine.  Add 1 or 2 cans Goya tomate sauce.  Finally add the pink beans.  Combine.  Cover and let all flavours marry.  Simmer on low...Uncover when want to serve and cook liquid down ( only if too much ) but leave enough  for it to have a creamy and not dry consistency.  Now THESE are true PR beans!  :)

Again this was a great recipe. I used canned and drained kidney beans, omitted the salt, used unsalted tomato sauce and added Adobo to taste. It was awsome. I've used the canned and drained pinto beans before and it was without-a-doubt-delicious! The longer it cooks the more the flavors infuse into the beans, just make sure it doesn't burn. If you want thicker broth, try using the water the beans come in, instead draining it. Or use 1/2 water, 1/2 the bean water. MMMM!

this recipe is good but I did make a few small changes.  I quickly diced a small potato and plantain - you can get this at a Spanish food store and even some regular grocery stores - and sauteed them for a few minutes and added that to the rest of the mixture.  The starch helped thicken the bean sauce up.  I also spiced it up with some fresh cilantro and Adobo.  Added juice from can of beans as suggested and let it simmer for about half an hour.  mmmm. came out delicious.

Habichuelas are traditionally kidney beans, not pinto beans.  And I always do my own sofrito; onions, garlic, cilantro, culantro, cubaneli peppers, salted pork, and sweet peppers.  Sautee that in olive oil, then put cans of big KIDNEY beans, liquid and all, half a can of tomatoe sauce and cover with water. Add some cumin and some oregano and you cook it for a loooong time, at least a couple of hours.  A guiso always tastes better the longer you cook it. Then if you let it cool and reheat the next day it's even better! Don't forget to season with some salt and put in like a t sugar to cut off the acidity of the tomatoe sauce. Some people like it with a bit of potatoes (I don't) some people like some green olives (I do). And then you are done.  NOW you got some puertorrican habichuelas!!!! Oh yeah baby!!!!

This recipe makes nice flavorful beans. My famlily recipes are very similar to this one. I add a little more sofito and some chopped alcaparrado. Alcaparrado is a mixture of green olives stuffed with pimentos and capers. My family puts green olives in everthing! This is such a classic dish, it goes with everything. My husband and I put some in a bowl, place a fried egg on top and dip plantian pieces in it for breakfast and dinner a couple times a week!

Nice - I mashed about a half cup of the beans before adding them which helped the sauce thicken and I didn't use the Sazon because I am trying avoid so much salt (and a lot of Sazon is really high in sodium) and instead used cumin, ground coriander (the fresh cilantro is a great idea), fresh ground black pepper and a bit of cayenne.  I also always put a spritz of lime juice in beans too...

This was good.  I didn't have sofrito so I added onion powder, garlic powder and chili powder in it's place.  I made my own sazon seasoning so I put in 1 1/4 tsp. of that.  I also added 1 cup of water instead of 1 1/2 cups.

I love this recipe! My 'adoptive' Puerto Rican family made this all the time. Sometimes with variations using potatoes/chicken/vienna sausage. I'm not a big meat fan but I love the potato version. They made their own sofrito too, and froze them in ice cube trays. Oh and I'd like to add that I accidentally clicked the 'thumbs up' tab on Tata's review. I do not agree with her review at all.

I loved eating this when "mami" cooked it. I have made different versions, such as adding potatoes, or ham, or when my meat freezer is empty, I use Spam. Love it every time.

My step mom is puerto rican so I grew up eating puerto rican rice and beans. I make these  often and the only thing I do differently is add a good handful of green pimento pitted olives, some cubed pieces of ham and instead of pinto beans I use 2 cans of goya low sodium pink beans undrained. Because I don't drain my beans I cut back the water to 1/4 cup to a 1/2 cup at most.  If you don't make your own sofrito  try to find a kind in the produce sections versus the jarred kind. My grocery store sells fresh sofrito, so I just keep a container in my freezer for when I make beans.

These beans were wonderful. I don't have the time to wait for a pot of beans to cook, so I too used canned pinto beans, as the other reviewers suggested.  I couldn't tell the difference.  I followed the recipe as written, except I used a whole packet of sason with a 40 oz can of beans (along w/ 1/2 of its water)and added adobo to taste.  My beans came out perfect. These went very well with fivebrigs white rice. I'll keep this recipe in my box from now on.

I'v never had Puerto Rican food before, so I can't speak to the authenticity of this dish. I didn't care for the taste, I won't make it again. I prefer longer, slow cooking bean recipes so the flavors can mix. This had very, very strong flavors! (Like I said, I'm not accustomed to Puerto Rican food)

Another great recipe and so simple, yet authentic. You definitely cannot go wrong using this recipe, especially if you’re trying to impress your PR in-laws (hahaha). Sometimes I’ll vary the recipe by frying a little bit of chopped up bacon or add pieces cooked ham hock to it. What a difference these tiny additions make! Regardless of my additions or alterations to this simply, great recipe, it’s amazing as written.

If it’s the first time you’re preparing Puertorican style beans, please don’t be confused with all the small changes people suggest here and there. Everyone in the Island has different ways of cooking their beans. The most important thing is the SOFRITO! Sofrito is the base of most of our food. Red kidney beans and pink beans are the most traditional ones used in our cuisine, but you can also use pinto beans, white beans, etc . Whether you use canned or dried beans, you choose. I’m old school, so I use dried beans although it takes wya longer to make. Cooking our style of beans includes some tomato sauce (you can also use tomato paste instead of sauce) and/or sazón. The amount of tomato sauce and sazón will depend on how much you like the tomato flavor and how “red” you want the beans. There’s nothing wrong if you prepare it with olive, canola, vegetable or corn oil... it’s your preference. Some people add  olives, cumin, or bay leaves, again, personal preference! Also, many Puertoricans add either adobo seasoning or chicken bullion to their beans (caution with this if you’re on a salt-restricted diet). Finally, the use of diced potatoes or “calabaza” (our type of pumpkin) is typically added when preparing beans.... but you don’t have to add if you don’t like.

10.15.16  I used homemade sofrito and Spanish tomato sauce for a little additional spiciness.  One comment:  I don’t think you need 1-1/2 cups of water for this recipe.  The pinto beans already are cooked, and it took forever for that amount of water to cook down.  Next time, I’ll add 1/2 cup of water and allow about 15 minutes for the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.  Served with picadillo and yellow rice.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I added some fresh jalapeño from my garden and used the whole 8 ounce can of tomato sauce.

Great stuff. Not quite like the way my mother or aunts made it, but that's fine: beans should be different to match the chefs' preferences.

I fried some onion and bell pepper in a teaspoon of bacon fat until they were nice and brown, and added some homemade sofrito, red pepper flakes, adobo, and sazon seasoning to taste. Delicious!

I am Dominican and I needed to know how to make this dish.  The best I could do was to use this recipe, its taste is just what I was looking for!  It has the authentic flavor of habichuelas guisadas. My husband loved it!!!!

I just love this recipe.  It makes the whole house smell fantastic.  Plus I cant believe that this isnt good for you.  I double the amounts and freeze it for a meat free meal in a pinch.  It freezes very well.

Im making these last minute to go with my carne guisada (recipe carne guisada III).  Since it was last minute, I made a few small changes.  Omitted the oil, used 2 cans of kidney beans, chili powder, cumin, and fresh cracked sea salt and pepper.  I plan on serving both the carne cuisada and this dish over rice.

These were exactly what I have been wanting since a cruise stop in San Juan.  I had some beans at a little cafe on the side of the road and could not reproduce them until now.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  Will make again and again.

This was so easy and SO good!  Wonderful flavor.  I used canned pintos and, as another reviewer suggested, I didn't drain them and I left out the water.  This made the "sauce" a perfect consistency.  I also had plenty of time so I let them simmer about 45 minutes. I served this over white rice and garnished with fresh cilantro.  Yum!  I used this as a side dish to the Puerto Rican Meat Patties...also on this site.

If you make a true puertorican sofrito, no need to add the sazon. I make my own with cubanelli peppers, red pepper, culantro, cilantro, onion, garlic and ajies dulces. Stir fry for 3 minutes and add half cup of low sodium tomato sauce. I Add one can of beans in its water and 1 can of water.  Can  also add cubes of calabaza. Salt to taste but not necessary with all the sodium from the can.  Let it simmer in med-low until flavors blend.  If you make the sofrito ahead, it makes it much easier.

I made this after traveling to Puerto Rico  2 weeks ago. I used the homemade Sofrito Recipe from the site and froze portions into ice cube trays. It was a hit with my guests that I had invited for dinner. I can’t eat rice and these beans tasted perfect without it.

Too much pepper for my  liking. If I make it again I'm going to leave out the pepper. Maybe add jamón de cocinar and calabaza too. The flavor wasn't to bad though. I think I am still going to keep looking for other recepies for habichuelas guisadas. (PS. I'm Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban so don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.)

Next time I'll use a little less water. I let it simmer longer than the recipe suggested so it thickened up nicely. The flavor was fantastic! I've already shared the recipe with my daughter & will definitely make this frequently.

I have made this recipe several times, with no alterations and with some minor alterations (depending on what I have on hand). I usually make my own dried sazon seasoning mix (less salt content than the packets), low-sodium/no salt tomato, and sofrito (from this site by fivebrigs). I find it much easier to add more salt as needed/to taste. Also, substituting kidney for the pinto beans works just as well. End result is always delicious!

This was a fantastic dish. I made no changes whatsoever. So good, in fact, that I am taking the leftovers for my lunch tomorrow, as the main dish! The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because they never thickened up and were very thin.

this recipe is soo great and so fulfilling...it really tastes like authentic puerto rican beans.  add puerto rican steamed rice, tostones and you have an awesome meal.  we love it!  the only changes is that i add a little bit more sazon seasoning because i love it.

i found this recipe a few months ago and i was eager to try them cuz i really dont like plain beans, there is nothing better to me than these beans, i think they taste much better when made with fresh beans and i also add more sofrito, these beans kick butt!!! thee best!!!

Excellent beans. I have been trying to find a good, authentic recipe for my Puerto Rican husband and did not want to use anymore Goya sofrito! These beans tasted so fresh and the flavor was out of this world. I doubled the recipe and it was amazing. I used fivebrigs recipe for the sofrito also.
