I made this last night and my family loved it.  I used chicken breast, because I don't like thighs.

This was really good.  The only thing I have to say is that it doesn't need as much water as the recipe calls for (next time I will not cover the chicken -- it was too watery) and it really doesn't need a whole pound of cashews!  At $10/ lb I bought a 1/2 lb and it was still too much.  Next time I'll use 1/4 lb.

This dish is wonderful; especially if you like asian/garlicy food. I followed the directions with the exception of using chicken breasts, because I needed to use them up.  I served with whole wheat noodles, broccoli, and mandarin oranges. What a great, healthier alternative to take-out; cheaper too!

This is a excellent recipe to use as a base for your own version.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a mixture of corn starch and chicken broth when I added the cashews.  That thickened the broth.  
There's a lot of cashews, which I love, so you may want to adjust that item to suit your own personal tastes.
Next time I'm adding mushrooms and some green and red peppers.  Tastes really good!

While my son commented that it "smelled funny" while cooking, everyone gobbled it up when it was done!  I added some sliced water chestnuts about 15 min before serving and the cashews (much less than what was called for) about 5 minutes before serving over steamed rice.  I made the Snap pea appitizer recipe (also from this site) to accompany it -- perfect!  Will definately make this again!

I thought this was a very tasty dish, although I could have stood to have more chicken in the mix, which is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  I didn't have scallions so I used regular green onions, and I thought it was fine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the cashews.  I was making my meal overnight for a dinner the next day, so I actually chilled it during the day in the refrigerator.  I pulled the chicken pieces out of the sauce and let them warm in the crockpot, while I reheated all the sauce on the stove.  As part of the reheating, I brought the sauce to a low boil and added the cashews.  It turned out perfectly - the cashews were soft but firm, and retained their shape well.  The whole mixture of flavors was really delicious.  I was afraid of the fish sauce after reading other reviews on the website, but there was nothing "fishy" tasting about it at all.  I will definitely make this again!!

this should be called fishy chicken.  I cook a lot of Chinese food and use Oyster sauce & fish sauce all the time, but never does the food taste only like this.

I did not care for this recipe. My entire house smells. It was the fish sauce. Maybe my family isn't used to this flavor or smell but none of us cared for it. It tasted just like it smelled.

A good and easy recipe.  4 stars because my husband complained about the cashews being too soft.

The taste of the fish sauce wasn't a problem for us (we splash it into our Thai curries all the time), but the overall flavor of the dish can be described as nothing if not distinct!  I found it a bit too sweet for my taste - not sure whether this came from the sugar ... or maybe the cashews?  I also don't like my nuts cooked and soft, so next time I would just add them at the VERY end. The chicken thighs were extremely tender - guess that's what a slow cooker does!  Soaked up the flavor well.  We served it over rice noodles and with some steamed broccoli, both great accompaniments. But in the end though, I probably would not make this again. It's been leftover in the fridge for a week now, which isn't a good sign in this house!

I did not like this recipe, too fishy, too bland, but I'm giving it three stars because my teenager loved it.  I think she ate all the leftovers.

the chicken was overcooked, and the flavor was somehow both bland and unpleasant. I won't be making this again.

I am sorry but we did not like this at all. The fish sauce was way too over powering. It gave the meat a bad flavor. I will not try this one again.  I have made several recipes from this site and this is the first one I have not liked
