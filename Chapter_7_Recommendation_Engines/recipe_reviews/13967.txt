This was great! It was easy and tasty! It went at the holiday get together and the recipe was requested several times.

This was rich, but great!  we halved the recipe, and needed to make our own 'stewed prunes' (dried prunes from the bulk section cooked in a little water on the stove until they fell apart) because we couldn't find organic stewed prunes at the store.  My two year old LOVED this, which I was thankful for, because it can be tricky to find ways to keep different kinds of fruits and veggies in his diet.  A really good flavor combo I would not have thought of normally.

I made this because I had the ingredients and needed a dish for an impromptu pot luck.  It was so good and there was none left.
It went very well with the ham that was served.  An unusual combination that really works.
