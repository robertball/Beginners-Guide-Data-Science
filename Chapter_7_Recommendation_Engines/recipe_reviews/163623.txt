Thank you Liza! This recipe was great...even if I've changed a little bit... First of all I didn't have bell peper,but I added garlic;second I didn't marinate the whole thing for 1hour or more,cause I didn't have enough time-instead I cooked it for 1hour(not 30 min.) and finally third,I added some mozarella at the end! It was so delish...I really enjoyed it! This is also a healthy recipe,made with natural ingrediens,not canned stuff,grease, sugar,or syrup.

This recipe is a great idea, but in my opinion, there is too much vinegar. My husband thought it was "OK," so I think that the idea is good, but the vinegar should be reduced.

Great way to change your side dish. You can season it a littler more (adding cumin, cilantro or fresh basil), but I really loved the idea. Kudos!

Outstanding!

Based on one of the reviews I added basil.  Otherwise no change.

Enjoyed it very much.

This made my kitchen smell wonderful as it cooked.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe, only omitting the dill since I have none.  I used white balsamic vinegar to keep the colors bright.  In the future I would add a clove of minced garli or two, but overall, it is healthy, easy, and tastes good.  Thumbs up, Liza

Excellent!  I'm not fond of dill so I substituted oregano.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I drizzled a little bit of butter on it as I baked and mixed. Combined it with pre-made wild and brown rice to serve and it was fabulous.

Easy to make and very delicious!! I found this recipe to be a great alternative to the variation of potato side dishes. I have never had roasted cauliflower but this dish did far from disappoint! I marinated over the two hours and substituted the pepper for a tomato, which went superbly with the balsamic marinade! Buon appetito! !

This is amazing!  I used cauliflower, mini sweet peppers, white onion and some cherry tomatoes.  I added minced garlic to the vinegar mixture (dried dill weed as no fresh) and tossed it & threw in the oven.  Not such a great smell but thank goodness my exhaust is working!   Will make many times in the future!!

I was looking for a vegan side and came across this. I found myself eating the raw marinated cauliflower and enjoyed it raw. I did cook it the next day and found that I enjoyed it more raw. I think the next time I make it I will try red wine vinegar as the dark cauliflower was a little off putting when eating it raw. Looked like it was rotten or something.

Was good...a little dry and Gene thought too many onions, I thought a bit too much dill.  Perhaps bake at 400 instead of 450...worth trying again,
