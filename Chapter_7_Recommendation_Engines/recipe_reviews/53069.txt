Thanks for taking the time to add this very traditional Indian recipe! I have prepared and eaten it all my life. You can pretty much change the proportion of all spices and condiments to match your taste. So feel free to cut down on chillies. If you do not have dried mango power, just use fresh lemon juice and it will be just as good. For a different twist, add 1/4 cup thawed frozen coconut - this is very traditional around the Indian coast. Also, use peanut or vegetable oil instead of ghee to make it healthier.

Wow, these ARE good. the first time i made this dish, i boiled the potatoes too long so this turned out more like indian mashed potatoes. very very spicy stuff, but its also very good. the second time, today, they were perfect. im eating a bowl of it rite now and i have a huge jug of water next to me. we really liked this, but its not recomended for young childern. but for teens and adults, this stuff is great! to bring down the heat a bit, i served this with some sour cream at the side. thanx RG!!!

Really tasty, though I couldn't find any amchoor in the couple of stores I checked in. I used one big anaheim pepper, ground ginger and a bit of dried cilantro as substitutes, along with just regular margarine. These were good and spicy, and went really well with the honey and curry chicken that I made along with it. I'd definitely make them again, whether or not I find the amchoor.

I cooked an all Indian dinner for me and my husband last week.  We both love the flavours from India, and living in the Netherlands we have several excellent Indian restaurants nearby. Since I lost my job one month ago unexpectedly, I have time now to enjoy my passion for cooking ethnic food.  We loved these potatoes! I can handle much spicier food than my husband, so I cut down on the spicier items...I do not think it was necessary...my husband would have liked the potatoes a little less dry...will try perhaps the suggestion of peanut oil next time.  OH! I found the mango powder at at specicialty shop only 4 blocks from my house!!  Curious to see how it is next time!  A real winner recipe! Thank you...

These potatoes were good but a bit dry.  Next time I'll make them spicier and find some way to make them saucier.  I added a can of rinsed and drained chickpeas to make a full meal.

Made this recipe last night with the girlfriend.  I've never been clear about what a chili pepper is exactly, so we used fresh Serranos.  I recommend 1, not 2, for the average eater.  Sour cream was nice on them.  Served with a Yogurt Drizzled Spicy South Indian Chicken, salad, and Plum Wine.  Very good.

We definitely enjoyed these and I will be making again. I used more than 4 potatoes and bumped up all ingredients from there.  I used a bit of poblano peppers as I was not quite sure which kind to use. I think I will try it again with Anaheim.  Did not have amchoor so used fresh lemon juice.  Did add a bit of tumeric for color. Skipped the fresh cilantro as we ate from pots on the stove.  I'll definitely use this recipe again as it is such a welcome change of taste for potatoes. Family ate it down to the last speck, but was waiting for rave reviews. Everyone thought they were very tasty, but no one was raving about them which is what usually happens.  A keeper? Absolutely. If I ever find amchoor, will try them again and revise the stars upward, if warranted.

I made these today and only changed 2 things [as other reviewers suggested]. I used sesame oil and lemon.  Very awesome.

Added tumeric and garam masala to the boiling potatoes.  Also had to use lemon juice as I did not have mango powder.  Also used sesame oil as I did not have clarified ghee, could have used peanut or vegetable oil. Might be nice with a 1/4 up of frozen coconut and for a filling meal, add a can of drained chick peas. Very good and nice and spicy.

Very good and a great alternative to heavier tasting Indian dishes.  Even better overnight.  I didn't have mango powder and just added lemon juice to taste instead.  I'd love to see how this tastes with the mango powder tho' - maybe next time!

I couldn't find amchoor - I don't have a lot of south asian markets here.  I mottied the chiles and served with lemon pickle (not everyone's cup of tea I know!!!),  and it was very nice.  I added some turmeric for colour and my guest (who declined the lemon pickle) was very happy. I serbed it with shaag paneer and garlic parathas (I cheated on these and picked them up from my local Indian restaurant).

This would make an excellent stuffing for a Dosa with some sambal, mint or onion chutney as condiment. Next time and it will be soon.

Excellent.  I'm giving 4 stars because I accidentally added cardamom thinking it was coriander.  When I realized my mistake I went ahead and added coriander as well.  I also used 2 serrano peppers.  This dish reminds me of a potato sabzi I used to make but I don't have the recipe handy and I can't recall the precise ingredients.

I just made these and all I can say is "wow"!! They are so good, I didn't have any chilies so I just left them out and with the chili powder, they were spicy enough for me but I will make them again with the green chilies and I am sure they will be great!! Thank you so much for this recipe, its a keeper!!

We loved these potatoes. Such a delicious combination of flavors! The amchoor really adds that extra touch. I used two yellow sweet potatoes and two white potatoes--both worked well with the flavors. I used coconut oil instead of ghee, and I took another reviewer's suggestion and added coconut (dried and unsweetened). I'll make this exactly the same way next time.

These are delicious. I wish more of the flavors made it onto the potatoes. Mine tasted mostly just like home fries.

I am giving this three stars because as it is, it is just OK.  I doubled the spices and it was much better.  Very enjoyable - thank you for posting!
