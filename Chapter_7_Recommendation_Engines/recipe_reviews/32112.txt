I actually grew up with my Mom making this on a regular basis because she grew up with HER Mom making it on a regular basis. The only change Mom made was using gov'ment cheese, she spread mayonnaise on the bread before making the sandwich, and sometimes, she would add lettuce. It was ALWAYS specifically on cheap white bread. I can't think of anything more comforting than this sandwich.

Ok, so I received a can of Spam for Christmas - a relative back home didn't know you can get it in the US, and included it in a 'grocery care package' - and I didn't really know what to do with it. I thought I'd give this recipe a go, but was pretty certain I wouldn't like it. Well, I was wrong! I toasted the bread as suggested, and it was actually a very tasty sandwich. Blimey!

This was really good, but then I like spam. :)  I topped with velveta cheese instead of sliced American.

Followed the recipe as written, toasted the bread (we used Arnold's Sandwich Thins). It was tasty, but I guess I'm not a huge Spam fan because I didn't love the flavor. I liked the tomato in it to help balance the saltiness in the meat. It was something different, and if you've got spam to use a good way to use it. :)

I have been eating Spam for 70 years and I still like. The only change I make to this recipe  is I put it on a toasted bagel. I take it for breakfast on day bus tours.

This was awesome.  I did cut the calories some by not using butter and using a zero calorie olive oil spray and by using a 35 calorie per slice bread.  THESE ARE A DEFINATE KEEPER IN OUR CHEAP FAMILY!!!

My husband surprised me with this new recipe for lunch today and it was great! I LOVE SPAM! This was a fun twist to the usual ketchup and spam sandwich i've grown up on.  He used Mozzarella cheese instead of the American.

I guess if you never had Spam (or don't like it), this may not sound good. But, trust me, it is great! A perfect quick meal sandwich.

Pretty good actually.  I don't mind Spam but it's a bit boring, so I like finding other things to do with it that are still easy to make.  The bread definitely needs toasted.  Didn't like it as well with the tomato but that was OK too.

Oh my goodness - this was incredible for something so simple!  I only eat Spam a couple times a year so I buy the Spam singles.  Had one in the cupboard.  I cooked the onion til slightly brown which sweetens them.  Added the mashed spam and cooked til crispy.   Then added the egg.   I used a brat or small sub bun that I had on hand and that I had browned/toasted in butter.   Skipped the tomato.   Added thin strip of Velveeta singles slice.  SOOOOOO good I just ate it now and want another!  I have a feeling I'll be keeping more Spam in the house!   This was a great quick meal for me on a night I didn't feel like doing any elaborate cooking.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!

This was delicious and easy, never thought to mash up Spam with a fork, or fry it with onions, so good. I used Jalapeno Spam and didn't have a tomato but would be even better with a big tomato slice. Will make again soon, thanks!

I love this sandwich and have passed the recipe to other spam lovers.
