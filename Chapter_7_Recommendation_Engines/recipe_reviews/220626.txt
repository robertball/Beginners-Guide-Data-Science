I tried this first because I was looking for a 'beef salad' (similar to a chicken salad) type of idea. I had leftover grilled sirloin that I wanted to try to do something new with.  The second reason was, of course, because of my Dutch heritage.  I obviously didn't follow the recipe exactly - substituting 2 cups of leftover grilled sirloin for the corned beef.  I also left out the potato - not my favorite.  But I followed the remainder of the recipe to a T.  I made the dressing according to the recipe but ended up using not quite the full amount - due to the lack of potato.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight to allow blending of flavors.  We were SO pleased with the result. It seems like such an odd combination, but the onions, the pickle, the apple all add their own distinct flavor to this.  You could serve it as an appetizer spread with crackers or, of course, on buns for sandwiches.  We wrapped in it lettuce leaves and served it with a green salad on the side.  Great recipe!!

I live in Holland, and happen to be eating huzarensalade at the moment - this recipe isn't authentic to it...but it seems the right recipe for 'rundvleessalade' (beef salad) - which does have beef & ketchup. Never heard of apples in either recipe, but maybe that is to taste.
