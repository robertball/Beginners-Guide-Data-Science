I've made this recipe about a dozen times before, but never doubled it until yesterday.  I found that adding the liquid from all 4 cans of kidney and butter beans makes it too soupy.  It's usually much thicker.  If I double it again, I will proabably try omitting the liquid from one or two cans of beans.  Regardless, it still tasted delicious and everyone loved it!  I cooked it in a 6-qt. crock pot for 3 hours on high.

Very good recipe-meat definately played the starring role in this dish.  I followed the recipes exactly and this was a big hit.  This recipe is also very generous in it's portion size and could very well serve as a main dish.  I will definately make this again and maybe add another can of beans to throw off the abundnace of meat:)

I just got back from a potluck that I took this dish to. I didn't have any leftovers to bring home and a couple folks asked for the recipe, so it's a keeper. I did add about 1 tbsp.of Worcestershire Sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Also, was out of dry mustard so I used about 1 tbsp. regular yellow mustard instead.

This worked pretty well and was really easy. It's sort of like chunky sloppy joes. I put it in the crock pot for two hours on high but it could've used more. I also would've used less brown sugar, since it was pretty sweet from the baked beans.

This was so easy to make! Fry up the bacon, cook the meat and the onion in the same pan, dump in the rest and voila!  I eyeballed the sugar, ketchup, mustard, etc...

This was very good, and went together quickly.  I used bbq baked beans and cannellini in place of the butter beans.  I drained the kidney beans and cannellini , and added half a beer to make up for the lost liquid.  I cooked it in in my crockpot on high for 2 hours (I think another hour would have been better).  My crockpot was scraped clean at the neighborhood potluck, so I guess it was a hit!

I have used a similair recipe and had lost it so when I found this one I thought I would try it again. I would give it 5 but I used green beans instead of butter and didnt use nearly that much brown sugar. Threw it all in a crock pot for a couple of hours and it was good to go. This one is a keeper.

Awesome!  Only variation is that I didn't have any ketsup so I used half spaghetti sause and half BBQ sauce.  Two people at the potluck asked for the recipe for their kid's graduation parties.  A big hit.

I've been making this for years & it's always a favorite. My recipe calls for a tsp. or so of Liquid Smoke, a little goes a long way but really adds to the flavor!

This is a great potluck/tailgating recipe! I add all ingredients to my crock pot while I am cooking the bacon and ground beef on the stove. I add the browned ground beef and crumbled bacon to the bean mixture and simmer in the crock pot on a low setting all day. Yum!

YUM!! Even with extra lean ground beef and turkey bacon to cut the calories, needs some extra moisture when made that way, however.

Good recipe. I tripled it and added potato flakes to cut down from the excess liquid from canned beans. Recipe should have less sugar. Mine was a bit sweet and carmelized in the baker process. Oh so good though. Suggest minced garlic too

I didn't have vinegar and dry mustard so I used a squirt of yellow mustard. I used beans I had available...baked beans, pinto beans, and navy beans. It was good but seemed a bit bland. I'll season more if I make it again.

I've made this more than once, and everyone (hubby and two little boys) loves it. I'm taking a star away because I feel like as-written, it's too sweet. This time I cut it down to a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and the ground beef package was about  1.3 lbs, and I felt like it was SO much better.

This recipe is about my most requested item to bring to all tge summer outdoor parties.  I wouldn't change a thing until uou have cookec it yourself, but in a crock pot is obviouly the best for transporting. The bacon is the winner here to me!

My family absolutely loves this recipe!!! We sometimes add canned corn to change the flavor a bit. When doubling the recipe, if you don't like it soupy, add the liquid from only half of the beans.

Made this many times. Only changes I make is add 3 tablespoons of real maple syrup, use bushes maple beans, and drain your butter, and kidney beans. Draining keeps this from getting soupy.  Whenever there is a gathering , I get requests for this dish.

All 4 members of my family agreed that this recipe was delicious. That's a rarity in itself. We had this dish as our main meal along with a salad of mixed greens.

We're vegetarians.  I made this with 1 cup of vegan beef flavored TVP from Augason Farms and a package of Morningstar Farms "bacon".  It was delicious.  The combination of flavors was heavenly.  I added 1T of worchestshire sauce.  Looking forward to the leftovers tonight which I bet will taste even better.  Will serve with cheddar biscuits.

This was just ok for me, thought it was very sweet. even with less brown sugar than it called for.  Next time I would try something with some spice to balance out the sweetness.

I have made a similar recipe for years.  Only difference is 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp vinegar and regular mustard.  If kidney beans aren't your favorite (like my husband), try substituting great northern or navy.  Also, to lower the fat I always use turkey bacon.  Sometimes I also used ground turkey just to make it taste different and to justify the cheddar cheese I sprinkle all over the top at the end!  I guess I will admit that even when I use ground beef I still sprinkle on the cheddar just less.

This was delicious, even my kids agree.  I served it over elbow noodles with a green salad.  I used a larger can of baked beans, because that's what I had on hand, plus regular mustard instead of dry.  It was very filling.  Half was frozen for next time!
