WARNING: This can make a huge mess of your oven!  With that said and after cleaning up the mess from the first batch, I have since learned a few lessons.  The cleaniest way to make this is place a cake rake in a roasted pan lined with foil because the basting sauce with drip off the pork and either get burned into your pan taking forever to soak and scrub off, or drip into your oven requiring you to clean if.  This is an excellent recipe and quite as good as what you get in Chinese restaurants.  However, it is time consuming so if you go through the effort of making a batch and you know you like it, make a double or triple batch because it does not take anymore time than a single and extras freeze well.

My family loved this!  I did add the chinese five spice as suggested.  marniated this for about 10 hours, and then put the pork roast on a rotissery cooker.  I basted the gravy on it through the cooking time, and it came out SO juicy and tender! This is one I will definately be making again.  I used the leftovers to make some pork fried rice too.

This recipe is really good.  The flavor is abundant.  I used white wine instead of sherry because I had none on hand.  I cooked on wire rack on a cookie Sheet lined with parchment.  Turned out perfect husband says this one is a keeper.   I am unsure about using reserved marinade for basting,  so next time I will keep some of the mix outside the meat for safety.

Oh this so GOOD! It does taste like bbq pork you get from the Chinese store. I didn't have any Hoisin sauce, so I processed orange marmalade, fresh garlic cloves, sherry, a touch of soy sauce, as a substitute. I cooked it on the grill since it was already fired up. I would make this again and again.

I grew up eating this, and I thought for a homemade version it was pretty good.  Color is not the red vibrant color I am used to, so I did add a bit of food coloring in my marinade to brighten it up. It did come out much more like the real deal. Think I may cut back on the cinnamon a tad next time I make it though. Meat was very tender, thanks to the overnite marinating method.

This came out very nice.  ALMOST tasted like the real thing you get at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  I didn't want to go through the mess with meat hooks, etc. so I just marinated this overnight and then packed tightly in a shallow baking dish.  I kept some sauce on reserve and poured over the meat after 30 minutes of baking and turning the pieces over.  Fifteen minutes later, I took it out and drained the excess sauce into a pan to reduce and then pour over the meat.  I served this with broccoli slaw sauteed with sesame oil.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this recipe again and saving myself some money by not ordering out.

I tried this out with a few  boneless country style ribs and that worked great. Next time I'll get a loin and cut it up so I have some to freeze.  I went scant on the 5 spice and heavy on the sherry. I added about half a cup of water to the remainder of the marinade and boiled and reduced it back down so I could use it to drizzle on the meat. Leftovers will be chopped up and added into eggrolls.

This was almost like the pork they sell in Chinatown. I marinaded the pork overnight and hung it to cook in my oven. Using paperclips work really well. though i found it hard to baste the pork because it was hanging. The color didn't reflect it's great flavor...I guess that's why the professionals use food coloring.

This was really good! I had leftover meat so I diced it and made a soup.  I sauteed 2 large minced garlic cloves, 1 med. onion diced, 1 inch piece of sliced fresh ginger, 1 minced Thai chili pepper, and I diced 1/2 orange pepper, 1 rib celery and 2 med. carrots.  To the sauteed veggies, I added the pork, 4 C. chicken broth, and 1/2 tsp. fish sauce.  I simmered this for 1/2 hour and served over noodles.  It was delicious!

*almost* what i was looking for.  maybe it had too much hoisin... i don't know.  i wanted less sweet (it really wasn't overly sweet to other people) and more savory.  i used to eat vietnamese sandwiches from this excellent cafe in houston -- and they used this kind of meat.  i used french rolls, cucumber, cilantro, carrot slivers & slivered jalapenos to make my sandwiches.  overall this was a huge time consumer to make, using my oven to cook little batches at a time.  i don't know if i'm going to make this again any time soon, but i will more than likely make it again, with tiny alterations.

It's just hard to stop eating this delicious stuff.  
Tweaks I always make: leave out white sugar, use sake instead of sherry, and use a broiler pan instead of hanging the meat to roast. Serve with jasmine rice and sliced cucumbers.

Yummy! I never knew I could duplicate the same taste as restaurant type "char sui."  My kids loved it. Husband was beside himself. I used my turkey roaster and flipped it so that it created more of a shelf for the water to steam under the pork while the pork sat on the shelf. It wasn't messy at all.  I agree with others the color red needs to be made with food coloring. I didn't use it,but if the appearance is important, you might want to do it. I highly recommend this yummy dish.

Made this last night for the first time with a bone-in pork shoulder that I butchered and cut into large strips. My roast was 3.5lbs so I doubled the recipe, I might use a bit less soy sauce next time. It is absolutely delicious. The aroma and look and taste is so similar to my favorite Cantonese resturants.

This was so easy and so tasty.  I didn't add the extra sugar or honey because there is plenty of sugar in the ketchup alone!
I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked on a rack over a baking sheet that I sprayed with PAM.  Next time I make this I will omit the cinnamon.
