This made a very good and very quick dessert. I pretty much stuck to the recipe except for the pie filling. Instead, I made the bottom layer with the cream cheese/pudding mixture. The other thing I liked about this recipe is that I was able to use all lowfat or nonfat items( light cream cheese, lowfat milk, a fat free/sugar free white chocolate pudding mix(instead of vanilla), a reduced fat graham cracker crust  and lite whipped topping) and it was still really good. And I recommend topping the whipped topping with chocolate chips. This recipe was easy, looked good, and tasted great.

I made my own graham cracker crust recipe from this site and I didn't use the glaze either. Also used frozen strawberries, thawed out and instant chocolate pudding since that was all I had. It was really easy and quick.

I loved this pie!  We picked our own fresh strawberries and used them in this yummy pie.  I can't wait to pick more and make another one.  I intend to try it with raspberries in July and blueberries during blueberry season.  Can't wait!

Too much filling for even a deep dish 9" pie. I suggest using two 3oz pkgs cream cheese with 3/4C milk.  I used one can of pie filling on top of the cream cheese/pudding filling.

Had a hard time finding 3.4 oz box of pudding. Made my own flour pie crust (baked in oven for a few minutes before filling)& used real whipped cream.  And of course the strawberries from our patch.  Did not use glaze.  My picky husband loved it !

Yummy! My three sons and hubby loved it! I used low fat whipped topping and added a box of vanilla pudding and a box of cheesecake pudding. Easy and delicious! Will definitely make again...and again...

This pie had a very good flavor. I used low fat ingredients and sugar-free glaze. The amount of filling was a bit too much for the size of the pie crust, and it was a bit messy to prepare. Great taste, though, and my family loved it.

I changed this up a little for a diabetic. Instead of vanilla pudding I used sugar free cheese cake pudding. A whole container of cool whip and mixed crushed pineapples in with the milk, pudding and cream cheese then topped with sugar free chocolate syrup. It was a big hit. See diabetics really aren't hard to cook for. This dessert has a total of 2gm sugars.

Love this recipe. I used frozen strawberries instead.  I crushed walnuts and sprinkled on top. My husband and children loved it.
