In the middle of an oppressively hot, humid Chicago summer, my wife and I chilled this soup in the fridge for five hours before serving under the shade of our oak tree in the backyard, and luxuriated in the taste, the texture and the coolness. 

A perfect Sunday afternoon lunch. Note: You cannot chill this soup too much. 

Be sure to add the tomato for garnish and color contrast. And a glass of very chilled pinot grigio wine. 

A No. 10 all around.

A good basic recipe but needed a little bit of "oomph". I looked at the avocado and cilantro soup recipe and added some of the elements of that recipe (dash of Mexican hot sauce, lime juice). I also blended everything together and added extra cilantro at the end, when I put it in for chilling.

This is my 3rd time making the soup,first time very good, 2nd time,not so good,this time good just not out of the ballpark. This recipe is good but I think it's needs some extra spice, after I ate half a bowl, I added some cayenne pepper, no,didn't taste right so to my next bowl I added garlic powder and cumin, what do you know a hit! Everybody needs to try their own taste so try.

Has to be eaten in small amounts at a time.  Better as a side dish than a main course.

I was so looking forward to this I made it in the winter months and was pleased.  No changes made on a good blend of flavor.

It lived up to it's name as avocado soup but was very rich and very filling. I was quite skeptical of a cold soup but it turned out alright. For being a "summer soup" it was a little too heavy.

This was wonderful, even my husband who was not thrilled about the idea loved this soup.  I liked it room temp and cold.

This was a great!  We added a squirt of fresh lime juice and cilantro to ours. Also, because I did not have any heavy cream on hand, I made a substitute which may have added to the great flavor...3/4 whole milk mixed with 1/3 c unsalted butter.  We'll be making this again and again. I would say to give it some kick you could add well...something spicy but my 6 year old was also eating this so we left it as is.

It was simple to make. I liked it quite a bit, but my boyfriend did not care for it all. Good dish, but not for everyone.

I added chopped walnuts, sunflower seeds and unsweetened coconut to the finished product. I also omitted the tomato. 
To make it easier, I used my immersion blender. Fast and easy cleanup.

This is the first AllRecipes review I’ve ever written, but just had to comment because this was so noteworthy!  I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was to sauté the shallots with a small jalapeño and about one clove of garlic. Also added a bit of cilantro when blending everything together with my immersion blender. Hubs and I both love avocados, but were unsure about cold soup. Never fear, this soup is spectacular regardless of being cold! Take a chance and give this a try. Rich and delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes! We first made it for a themed murder mystery party and it was a huge hit. It's very heavy and rich so you only need a little bit for each person. We like to add bacon crumbles and diced roma tomatoes when we serve it.

This is a great recipe. I'm excited to make it again because now I'm on a low carb diet and this is ideal. Before I started this diet I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk. It made it creamy without the calories of the cream.  Oh, and I just mashed the avocado a little, threw all the rest in the bowl, and used a stick blender on the whole thing. The avocado just gets so gooey in the blender or food processor and then there's one more thing to wash. The stick blender nearly washes itself.
