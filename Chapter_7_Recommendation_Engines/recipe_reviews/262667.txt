Well, Dave. I have to thank you for posting this recipe. I had made this pie many times a number of years ago but lost the recipe book it was in. I've been searching for a recipe for this for four years but no one I know had heard of it. This is a delicious mixture of tart and sweet and I, like you, prefer the rhubarb cooked down into the custard instead of rhubarb chunks. So having said that, I did cook the rhubarb longer than you state and mashed it before incorporating the cream mixture in. Other than that, I made no changes and don't plan on any. This is a great recipe for a great pie. 
PS: I love surprising dinner guests with this dessert. I like to bring the pie to the table and I know they are expecting lemon meringue pie. I can't wait to see their faces when I cut a slice and it is pink!

I love this pie.  Unlike any other Rhubarb pie with a creamy custard filling.
