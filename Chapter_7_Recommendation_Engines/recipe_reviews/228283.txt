This is a recipe my family has made for over 50 years.  One can adjust the amount of each ingredients to suit your taste.  We would use a meat grinder to grind the ham.  Now, a food processor works nicely and saves time.  I process the egg whites and save the cooked yokes.  The yokes are mashed and mixed with the mustard and mayo and then mixed into the ham mixture. (I also start with a smaller amount of these ingredients, so the ham salad is not overly moist.  One can always add a little more to reach the desired consistency)  We serve it between two slices of toast with a couple leaves of lettuce.  Chilling it prior to serving is best, giving the individual flavors time to blend together.  Be sure to refrigerate the leftovers.

This was great!  I made a few adjustments, though.  Instead of ham I used store bought nacho chips, and instead of eggs I used cake frosting.  I don't fancy mayonnaise, so I swapped that out for chicken stock, and then I completely avoided using anything else listed in this recipe.

Seriously, what is with people changing the recipe drastically and then leaving negative reviews?  Don't you realize that as soon as you change the recipe, you're not reviewing the same thing?  Sheesh people...

Instead of sweet pickle relish, I used two large garlic dill pickles. I ran my chunked ham and pickles through my food processor for the coarse chop I was looking for. The mayonnaise/mustard was the perfect amount. The ham salad wasn't too thick or too runny. This reminds me of the ham salad Grandma made for me as a kid--my family all enjoyed this very much. We ate it schmeared on saltines.

My grandmother used to make bologna salad with a recipe almost exactly like this.  The trick to getting perfect ham or bologna salad is using a hand grinder-one that clamps onto the side of the table.  Grind the meat then eggs, then sweet pickles.

I haven't made this recipe, but everyone loved Grandma's bologna salad.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was just perfect.  I used my food processor to grind the ham.  It was delicious with crackers.  My husband used what was left to make a sandwich with.  He has asked me twice now when am I going to make this again:)   thanks for submitting this recipe!

My family loved it. We try not to eat mayo much and really not all. We have changed our diets for two years and have not had mayo since. I love ham salad and found this recipe.  We only used ham, eggs, mustard, sweet relish, onion powder, and instead of mayo used no fat Greek yogurt as a sub. Wow. Very good. Like the others say perfect amount of ingredients. Perfect consistency.

I read the reviews before making this recipe and changed the pickle relish to chopped dill pickles, per Sarah Jo's suggestion, but think the "bite" of the relish might have been better.  I doubled the recipe and I also used about half the amount of mayonnaise and mustard (Hellmans, low calorie) and found that more than enough.  I was also careful to choose an "upscale" ham to begin with.  
I served this as part of a holiday buffet with mini-rye breads and crackers, and it went largely ignored, although people who tried it, liked it, but did not rave as they did over other items on the buffet.  My husband does love the recipe for sandwiches -  a good thing because we had lots leftover.  
Why three stars - I don't think you should have to change a recipe from its original, and if sev Still looking for the perfect ham salad, like MY mother used to make it!

The ham salad is great.  It had the right combination of ingredients in it.  I chopped the ham as I liked it chunky.  If you have a ham dinner save some for ham salad.

I had never made Ham salad before and had some leftover ham from Christmas so I thought I would give it a try. I just recently bought a meat grinder for my Kitchen Aid mixer and wanted to try it out, it worked beautifully for the ham. I upped the celery to 3/4 c and the onion to 1/2 c and added 1/8 t salt and garlic powder. Also added 1/2 t pepper, everything else I did as written. I have made this twice this week and can't get enough, my husband and I eat it right out of the container!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!

4.5 stars actually. I didn't need 1 C of mayo (1/2 C maybe)and used 2 tsp Dijon mustard. Added 1/4 tsp jerk seasoning and a couple shakes of pepper sauce to spice it up a bit. Great as written w/out so much mayo and easy to adjust for personal pref. I think I used a bit more celery and went with 1/4 C minced green onion. After mixed, I sampled. Mine wasn't salty so I added some celery salt. Even as good as it was right after preparing, I found it really rocked the next day. Served on warmed Hawaiian rolls. Real tasty on those or on rye bread with some Swiss cheese.

I liked this recipe, but I wish I had seen the comment about switching out the mayo for greek yogurt first. I don't cook often inside, but I am attempting to blossom out a little from my grill. I used what was left over from the Christmas ham, chopped it in the food processor. I then threw it all in the kitchen aid mixer, and added a little southwest bbq mesquite rub from Costco. I really didn't measure out the onion, and celery, just grabbed some and diced it up. Turns out I just made lunch for a week for pennies. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. Comment: I have a problem with people leaving a negative review if you totally change everything about a recipe.  If your recipe is the best ever, I don’t think other cooks’ recipes should be slammed. This is a good recipe.

I used this recipe when I had some leftover ham from a dinner and was looking to make a ham salad for my lunch during the week.  It was indeed very tasty!!!  I think what I would have done differently is to have ground 1/2 of the ham and finely chopped the other 1/2 for more of a lunchtime ham salad - I used my food processor & it came out a bit too pureed and mushy for a sandwich.  However, I would possibly follow the recipe if I was looking to serve with some crackers or bread for dipping. Obviously you can taylor the ingredients to your liking, which is nice. Thanks for sharing!

I recently made this ham salad and it was great. I had a larger batch from some left over ham. (about 4 times the above amount)  I used some sweet and sour pickled zucchini I made last summer. I also added some carrots, celery,and onion. I processed it all through the food processor, and added mayo. I left the mustard out. This was great taste and the group (mostly men)  I servered it too loved it.

So this is one of the first recipes I’ve ever made as directed with most of the ingredients in the recipe except I doubled it due to the amount of ham I had on hand except I used half greed yogurt and half mayo, only change. This is an incredible recipe!  I kept thinking I wanted to add garlic but it did NOT need it. This recipe is truly perfect as is.  I used food processor and pulsed every ingredient separately.  It helped to create the perfect consistency. Please try this. You will not be disappointed!!!

I just made a sandwich with this completed recipe and it was very good. I used my homemade summer garlic dills instead of the bottled sweet relish because my pickles taste sweet as well.  I chose to use my mini food chopper over my bulkier food processor to grind my ham as it was easier to clean and just as quick to process. I used 1/2 fat Hellman's to cut back on calories & French's prepared mustard.  I skipped the eggs because I didn't think they were needed.  This made the ham salad more moist, but in a good way.  I'm putting the leftovers back in the refrigerator to use again tomorrow, and I'm pretty sure it'll taste even better after the flavors have a chance to mix in.  All in all, this spread is delicious.  Thanks for sharing with us!

I loved this so much I inhaled it! I didn't have onions, so I threw in some extra celery for texture and onion powder for flavor. I also used honey mustard, but I'm not sure if that made a difference. I used my food processor instead of "mixing" like it says. Clean up is fairly ready too. If you like ham salad sandwich spreads, consider making this instead if buying it at the store. It's easy and very very yummy! And you get more bang for your buck making it at home.

Thank you for the recipe! So, so good. Wouldn't change a thing-- in fact I didn't. I did leave out the pickle relish by accident but I still loved the recipe. I made it all in a food processor and it was just sublime.

Wonderful recipe - although I was skeptical about the hard boiled egg at first. Followed the recipe as written, but I did cut it in half and added a tad of worcestershire. I also blended the egg yolk in with the mayo as one reviewer suggested.  Will enjoy making this in the future - thank you smile-u-nut !

I love ham salad but I've tried every store bought salad I could find looking for the right one. I final gave up and decided to make my own. This recipe had all the flavors the others lacked. I'm not a mustard fan so only put in half the amount next time I will not put any in but it was still amazing. Thanks!!

I used to make a ham spread like this when I worked in an old fashion meat market when I was a teenager. Same ingredients and same great flavor. Took me back for sure.I have made it 4 times now and it's a crowd pleaser every time. In other words WE LOVE IT. Thanks for sharing. -Special K

I made as directed, except I didn't have celery. It would be better with it, I just couldn't get to the store. Funny how someone said they didn't like the eggs in it. My son thought the whole thing tasted like egg salad with ham, so I had an extra egg and threw it in for good measure. More protein. Haha. Our AC is down and it is too hot to cook, so we made a batch of homemade bread in the breadmaker to go with this and it made a great meal without heating up the house even more.

I doubled the eggs and ham, celery and onion but stuck to the 1 cup of mayonnaise. I used “Wickles Wicked Relish. It was a hit at the potluck.

I made it just as the recipe says ( I always do the first time I make something) and it was very good. Took it to work and everyone enjoyed it.

Yum! I used leftover ham from Easter dinner and omitted the eggs because I had egg overload at Easter! I used dill relish because that’s all I had and also threw in some deviled egg filling that was left over. It was so good we’re eating on crackers tonight for a light super but this will be so good on a sandwich with lettuce too. Thank you for the recipe!

Made this without any additions or substitutions and it was the best I've had in years!  Everybody loves it - next time I'm going to double the recipe and make one with the sweet relish and one with chopped dill and see which one is better!

My deceased mother and father made the best Ham Salad. Little things you miss, this recipe was very close to my parents. I added a green pepper, a squeeze of honey and used less mayonnaise. Ham that's ground adheres like ground beef, don't have to use to much liquid. The mustard an excellent touch and finally someone didn't use an entire jar of relish. The eggs are new for me, but it turned out excellent. Good job.

I thought this was pretty good. I made it to use up the last of the Easter ham. I liked that it had just a small amount of celery and onion. I minced them and small chopped the ham. I liked the addition of the eggs and relish in this. I used full fat mayo, but cut the mustard and mayo in half and it was plenty. The full recipe makes about enough for 8 sandwiches.

I liked the recipe. But I like to kick it up a notch. I also used dill pickles and jalapeños. Added some oregano, ground black pepper and ground red pepper.

I knew I would like it, but to get my wife to like it would be a challenge, so I added red pepper, Dijon mustard, and a dash of Worcester! Spread it on crackers, and she absolutely loved it, as did I! Thanks!

I love this recipe because it has all the ingredients to make a great ham salad spread.  I like sweet relish over dill for this.  I prefer yellow over Dijon, too.  That’s what makes this recipe great. Use your preferences. I did not use nearly a whole cup of mayo because it overtakes the ham flavor.  This has been my go to recipe for years.

Only gave this four stars because I didn't follow the recipe completely. I omitted the eggs because I don't believe I've ever had ham salad with eggs but it turned out really good anyway. it was a really good way of getting rid of that leftover ham from Christmas dinner.

Great recipe.  I started with 3/4 C of mayo, knowing that I could always add more and that was plenty of mayo.

I followed the recipe although I didn’t measure as I’m not baking. With apprehension, the mustard was added. I of course had to try it before refrigeration and must say the mustard is a pleasant surprise! This is the best ever. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this salad with leftover ham;  My husband loved it.  I followed recipe, however, I didn't have pickle relish but I had my homemade zucchini relish. Great with crackers and as a sandwich spread. Fantastic. Very easy to make too!

Growing up, it was a given that anytime we baked a ham for the Holidays, ham salad would follow.  This is a good spread and is equally good on a sandwich.

Outstanding. I was a little confused by the discrepancy (4tsp. vs. 4 tbs) of pickle relish, so I fudged by putting an amount somewhere in between the two. Also used about half the amount of mayonnaise, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Everyone who tried it LOVED it. We always have leftover ham, so will be freezing some big chunks of it to make ham salad for weeks to come!

I didn't think it had enough flavor so I added 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper. Still wasn't sweet enough for me so I added 2 tsp of sugar. Come to find out the recipe is written with 4 tsp of relish and the video said 4 tablespoons of relish. Makes a big difference; I may not have needed to add extra of anything. I'l find out next time.

Just finished making this and I cut the mayo to 3/4 cup and it still was too soupy.  Fortunately, I had leftover cornbread so ground that up and tossed it in to absorb the extra mayo.  Other than that issue the flavors are very good. Like others stated, just like Mom used to make.

I’ve made this recipe 3 times now.  I think it’s perfect with sweet pickle relish.  Add more or less of the various ingredients to meet your tastes, but don’t use dill pickles then rate this recipe. It will completely change the taste.

Made it, exactly, well, almost exactly, Yummm, but have to say I did use Honey Baked Ham, which is yummm on its own.  I’m not a big ham fan but thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this family goodie.  Don’t hesitate to make it, it will be a hit, oh, and I used my rough meat grinder on my Kitchen Aide mixer, perfect and took about 20 min start to licking the spoon.

This is really good!  I used leftover ham from Christmas and adjusted the ingredients for 2 cups of ham.  I don't have a meat grinder, so I just tore the ham into small chunks.  Next time, I may add a little more celery because I like the crunch it gives.  Excellent as a sandwich or with crackers.

11-26-18  Great tasting ham salad recipe.  I made this with leftover ham from Thanksgiving and ran the ham through the food processor until just the right consistency.  Used Dijon mustard instead of yellow to add a little more punch to the flavor.  Next time I want to try it with dill relish as others have suggested.  My guests I had for lunch remarked about how good it was!   A recipe that rakes in the compliments is never a bad thing!!

I made it right by the recipe and it was pretty good. I am not that big a fan of baked ham, but this was a great way to use up some left overs. The only thing I did different was use one half cup mayo and one half cup salad dressing.

A trip down memory lane.  Mom used to make this with leftover Easter ham and ground the ham up with one of those hand-cranked meat grinders that clamped onto the edge of the kitchen table.  I used this as a stuffing for appetizers. Stuffed it into English cucumber disks (about 1 inch thick, hollowed out a bit to make room for the ham salad), celery, and sugar snap peas.  Took this to a party and they all disappeared.

Love this simple recipe! I used more eggs because I had more ham than the recipe called for, I used my small food chopper to ground the ham to the consistency I wanted, but only the ham. I just used a fork to mash the egg whites, I took a page from a another reviewer and mixed the egg yolks in the mayo mixture. I used mayo that had olive oil and cracked black pepper, mustard, and a bit of cayenne pepper for a little kick. I used onion powder instead of onions, no celery because I didn't have any. This turned out wonderful! I didn't measure anything, just used what looked right, the salad is firm and not runny at all, and the it taste delicious, I have been eating it on toasted hoagie rolls.

Was the perfect way to use up left over Christmas ham. I buy a lot of ham salad from the store. This is far better than anything you will find at the grocery.

We love this, but we make it without the egg! Great as a sandwich, or a snack on crackers!  Sweet relish makes the big difference.

Loved it just put ham in a blender or food processor works out perfect I used a 1/2 cup each of mayonnaise and miracle whip instead of a whole cup makes it creamer and also added a little cheese block of Colby Jack and cheddar cut up real small hope you like it like I do.

This is my first ever review because this is the first recipe I have found on all recipes that I did not significantly change.  I have to say,  I was sceptical but with a massive amount of ham that needed to be used I went with it.  this is really,  really good.  I did not measure anything but the ham (I ended up with 4 cups after processing) I used 4 eggs, 2 dill pickle spears and honey mustard because of course that's all I had.  Next time,  I will use more pickle, yum! and maybe add a little cream cheese because I love ham rolls and that is what this tastes like.  I made this for sandwiches and it's delicious! 
note- I did the whole salad in my processor,  next time I will only process the ham because the texture is a little funny for me,  but still,  so delicious!

Thought it was great. Added a little more mayonnaise, pickle relish and a couple spoons of sugar since my smoked ham was a little dry.

Very tasty, just like my grandma used to make. I added a little bit of cayenne, because I like that little kick in addition to all the other wonderful flavors in this.

Followed the recipe except did not add hard boiled egg this time. It's VERY good, on rye bread as a sandwich and on Ritz crackers as a snack.  Much tastier the 2nd day! So glad to have "revived" this one!!

Fantastic sandwich spread! I did it the way one commenter suggested and mashed the egg yolks and mixed them with the mayo, etc. This one is a keeper!

I have a spiral cut Han that ended up way too dry and trying to find ways to use it. This was great. Used my little "baby" Black and Decker to grind the ham. Followed recipe almost exactly. Only changes - didn't measure ingredients and used a bit of olive oil and reduced mayo. That is something I do in all salads, tuna, potato, etc. Helps cut down of fattening mayo and adds some good fat to my diet. This was really good!  Thanks.

I'm not sure what it was or wasn't but felt this recipe had no taste. I also used a processor and didn't like the texture of it. It was missing some zing.

I've made this twice and it's delicious! The only change I made was omitting the egg.  Great way to use up some of the leftover Christmas ham.

Use onion powder instead of buying a whole for 2 teaspoons. I used a 1/4 cup of celery. I would double the celery again next time.

Definitely a WINNER!
I substituted finely chopped dill pickles and 1/2 tsp of juice from the pickle jar instead of the sweet relish.
Delicious!

I did not make any changes, this is the ham salad spread salad I grew up on, and I am now 70.  It is very tasty with  a distinct ham  flavoring.

This is SO good! Has that sweet-and-salty thing going that I like so much. I over-processed my tiny test batch - too pasty - but was more careful with the rest and ate it for lunch the rest of the week.

To lighten the calories and fat content I substituted 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt for the mayo and used miracle whip for the other half (given it has half the calories of mayo). The taste was still the same and great flavor.

My four-year-old granddaughter "helped" me make this today using some leftover Easter ham.  We made it pretty much the way recipe called with some minor changes:  we used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo (as my hubby prefers it) and left out the raw onion (as my hubby does not like it).  For added "zing" I added about one teaspoon of prepared horseradish.  Hubby loved it, granddaughter ate it by the spoonful. Thanks!

I had a lot of leftover ham in my freezer from the holidays. Looking for ways to use it up... This is pretty good stuff!! Almost addicting! Thank you :)  oh and I used a food chopped to chop the ham up. Easy!

Very good. Made as described using some homemade pickles instead of relish which worked fine. Added some extra celery and onion as well for more crunch.

I thought after reading the ingredients, it would need more pickle relish, but it turned out just great as is.

Excellent ham salad - just like my mom used make.  The only change I made was to omit the celery only because I didn't have any on hand - will add next time.  I was a little skeptical about the addition of mustard, but it works! Great with crackers or on a sandwich (my fave).

Not bad - I prefer a little more celery to add texture and crunch.  Also, try finely chopped sweet gherkins instead of pickle relish!
