Was very good and very easy. I left out the butterscotch chips as i was afraid it would be to sweet. Was very good and sweet enough without them but imagine its great either way. Nice and easy when the sweet tooth hits!

Wow!  Definitely satisfied my craving for the chocolate/butterscotch combo!  It's a little on the sweet side, so next time I may add more peanuts and/or Krispies.  I did not have a double boiler, so I just melted the chips in a saucepan over low heat, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon.  Worked great!
