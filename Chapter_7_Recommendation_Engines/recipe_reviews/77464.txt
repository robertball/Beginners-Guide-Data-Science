call it a perversity, but i had to try this one  with only one (bad) review and i'm glad i did. i accidently splashed in extra vanilla, and my margarine - not butter - was melted in some parts. i used freshly-toasted walnuts in place of pecans. my only problem was that i accidently baked them too long, about 15 minutes. THESE COOKIES have a nice nutty flavor from the whole wheat, and they spread out, but not too much like some other chocolate chip cookies. next time, and there will defintely be one, i will bake these at the suggested time. PLEASE ignore the other reviewer (excuse me) but i have absolutely no explanation as to why this cookie didn't turn out for them. whole wheat does take some getting used to, perhaps that's it. have a glass of milk handy for this one!

These were fantastic! A great way to avoid refined wheat flour and stull indulge. I scaled the recipe down, skipped the pecans, and replaced the white sugar with half as much Splenda. Will make these regularly!

I don't know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars.  We absolutely loved these!  I didn't have any pecans, so I put in about a quarter cup of flax seeds for some crunch.  I might add more next time -- they were pretty good.  Personally, I couldn't even tell these were made with whole wheat.  We'll definitely make them again.

I thought this recipe was great! I had no problems whatsoever- I was a bit hesitant as to how the cookies would turn out before i put them in the oven because the dough was a little grainy, but they cooked fine.  To anyone who likes pecans as much as I do, 1/4 - 1/2 cup of extra pecans works well. Also, I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of the cookies before I baked them :)

These fabulous cookies came out just perfect! I love when I can use whole wheat in a dessert. :) Didn't change a thing and we love these big, soft, gooey, tasty treats! Beware, this recipe makes A LOT! I only made 1/4 of the recipe and got 2 dozen good-sized cookies. Thanks you so much for the recipe! :)

PLEASE NOTE:  I would use the base cookie recipe here again - it is actually very good.  However - I am debating on whether or not to even keep these after baking - the amount of chocolate chips overpowers the cookie! I love chocolate and these are just not up to par as written!... Might as well be eating a candy bar!  Next time - I will add a MAXIMUM of 1 cup of chips for this entire recipe - or just eliminate them altogether and substitute 1 cup of brickle chips.

These truly are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Made even better by not using white flour, in addition to the W.W. Flour I added some Flax Meal.  I didn't do nuts this time, maybe next time.  I baked them for the 10 min. suggested and let sit on the cookie sheet for 2 min. and then moved to cooling rack.  Perfect! Only other suggestion is that if you have a dog, keep these and any chocolate away from him. My 2 yr. old puppy ate 1/2 of one before I could catch him. Chocolate can kill dogs. Thanks for a great recipe. Oh, and have a cold glass of milk available for dunking.

We really liked these.  We're not nut fans, so we skipped the pecans.  Also, I cut the recipe in half by using the handy scaling tool.  Even though they are whole wheat, we didn't need 5 dozen cookies around the house.  Especially when they are this good!

WW Chocolate Chipper Haiku: "Pass me some milk please! These cookies were a bit dry. I might make again." I scaled the servings waaaay back to avoid having this many cookies floating around the house to tempt me, and I'm glad that I did, b/c I wasn't too terribly fond of them. It's not the WW Flour (I use it in most recipes as it is), and I did go w/ walnuts over pecans, as it's the only type of nut that I had on hand. I don't know if it's the overly-generous amount of chocolate chips called for or what, but something about these cookies just didn't call to me right out of the oven with their whispered "eaaaaaat meeeeeeeee" like most CC cookies do.

I had to modify the total baking amounts to half, the original recipe was way too big. It still made like at least four dozen cookies when only calculated for 30! big cookies too.  I added 1/2 extra tbsp vanilla, and cut baking time to 8 mins because my oven is very hot. They turned out great, and I have finally found a recipe I can use whole wheat flour!

Very good cookies.  They don't even taste whole wheat to me.  This makes a ton of cookies, so be prepared to bake them for a while, or do it in batches.  I was getting a litte tired there after a while!  Very nice, and a little better for you than regular chocolate chip cookies.  They don't really spread so I ended up smooshing them wtih my hand before putting them in the oven so they wouldn't end up too round (I like cookies to be a little flatter).  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty darn good. I cut the recipe in half. I used half butter/half applesauce instead of a whole cup of butter. And I omitted the white sugar all together. And I only used 1cup chocolate chips. I will make these again and I hope these freeze well.. I'll leave an updated review after I freeze them.

These are HANDS DOWN the most amazing cookies ever. I even made extra and froze them by the spoonful, stored them in the freezer, and just pull them out when I feel like having a few. I leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes while the oven preheats and bake as usual. Everyone has different taste so I won't knock those who gave poor reviews; however, I am in love with these cookies and thrilled to successfully use whole wheat flour in a baking recipe!

Although I give 4 stars, it is still the BEST I have had.  I suggest use only brown sugar, and 2 cups instead of 3 in the total.  Awesome!  I am still working on its chemestry to become 5 stars.  My whole family loved! If we can use whole wheat flour and brown sugar WHY use the more industrialized?  Think about it!

My daughter is allergic to eggs, chocolate and tree nuts, so I omitted the nuts, substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips and exchanged 1/2 cup applesauce and increased the baking soda to 4 tsp for the eggs. I also did not have enough butter on hand so I used half butter flavored crisco. I used an airbake cookie sheet and baked for 12 minutes. They turned out fantastic! (A bit flat, but I've grown used to that because of the egg allergy) Great basic recipe to alter for your specific needs!

Another reviewer said you can't taste the whole wheat. I definitely disagree, but that's not a bad thing! Whole wheat has a nice flavor and a natural sweetness, and that flavor shines in this recipe. My husband and son loved these! I normally don't like nuts in cookies, but decided to follow this recipe exactly, and I'm so glad I did. The nuts work wonderfully with the overall flavor. This is likely to become my recipe of choice for chocolate chip cookies.

Delicious. I was skeptical, whole wheat? But what a wonderful surprise. The whole wheat (used white whole wheat) adds a really nice texture and depth of flavor not found in the normal cookie.

I followed the recipe (several times now!) For Christmas, I used half choc chips and half colorful M&M's to make them festive. Best tip: FREEZE THEM! I freeze them all (in quart zip bags) and eat them right from there. Set 2 cookies out while you make a cup of hot tea and they are ready to nibble on right away!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This cookie has far too much sugar.  You can see the sugar glistening in the cookie.  It throws off the consistency and flavor.  I might try again with less brown sugar.

I liked these a lot. They were very spongy though, but that wasn't a bad thing (to me). My husband & family did not like them at all; two year old spit 'em out, so I traded 1/2 cup white flour for 1/2 cup of the wheat. I may even just do 50/50 white/wheat combo next time, since they still weren't thrilled w/ the second batch.

Pretty good for whole wheat.  I used the "white" whole wheat flour, aiming for a lighter cookie. Good texture, but you still get a whole wheat after-taste that kids may wrinkle their noses at.

These are fabulous, although I did make a few healthy changes.  I totally eliminated the white sugar.  I also substituted Promise for the butter.  My kids said they are the best chocolate cookie I've ever made.  Little do they know that they we "healthier" than regular cookies.  This is my new chocolate chip cookie recipe.

These were fantastic.  I must say the butter and sugar don't quite make these healthy but they were good.  I let a friend have one and she ended up making them and bringing them to a meeting we had.  Everyone loved them so much I had to send them the recipe. Thanks!

I was very wary of all-WW flour cookies. These are AWESOME. Nobody guesses they are whole wheat. Thank you!

I had run out of white flour and decided to make cookies anyways.  I needed a recipe with high ratings and no white flour in it.  This one fit the bill and turned out excellent.  The cookies were moist and well liked by our whole family and our "white-flour" friends.  We are saying good-bye to the white flour and making this our new chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Was very happy with the way these turned out.  I am impressed with how moist the cookies have remained even 3 days after baking them.  More chewy and thick rather than the traditional white flour cookies that are thin and flat.  I also added chopped macadamia nuts instead of walnuts/pecans.  Yum.

This is a GREAT whole wheat cookie and SO easy to make!!  My kids kept asking for more.  I didn't want to make 5 doz., so I scaled the recipe to 30 cookies and it made 3 doz. cookies.  I accidentally melted the butter as I was defrosting it and they still turned out great.  Probably a little chewier than normal, but still awesome! Next time, I plan on sprinkling the cinnamon sugar as recommended by Karin.  I, like Tangerine Jellybean, just can't understand a one star rating, unless they just don't like the flavor of whole wheat!  Your family will love these.  Mine did!  Thanks Submitter!!!

Loved this recipe. Used less chocolate chips as I thought 4 cups was too much and I used pecan halves I chopped up to blend into the mix. Seemed to be really soft cookies but very yummy and healthy so guilt free!

I usually hate when people make recipes and then change them.  However, due to lack of some items in my pantry and fridge I had to do that since I live far from a store. I substituted the 1 cup white sugar for 1 cup Stevia (the kind that is equal replacement), 1 cup of butter for coconut oil since I didn’t have enough butter, and only 3 cups chocolate chips (that’s all I had). Since I’m watching my blood pressure, no salt. They are very delicious!  I will be using this exact recipe again!

So I used the base recipe to make white chocolatier chip and macadamia nut cookies. I made a LOT of healthier changes. Instead of the brown sugar, I used jaggery powder. I replaced 3/4 of the sugar content with jaggery. Also since white chocolate is pretty sweet, I used 1/4th the amount of sugar.  Instead of all butter, I used half coconut oil and half butter. I must say, this recipe if followed to the T cannot yield anything but the best cookies. BEST recipe EVER. Only thing is that this cookie doesn’t spread too much so when you put it to bake, make sure you flatten it out a tad. Or else you will get a round cookie, nothing wrong there but just saying.

Great alternative to white flour cookies.  I left out the pecans and instead used walnuts as well as chocolate chips and it was delicious!  Great with a warm cup of coffee :)

This is true 5 star. I didn't fuss with anything except my kids are not nut fans so I left those out. GREAT way to use only whole wheat flour and still  come out with a chewy delicious treat. This is clearly a double recipe so keep that in mind. I love it because I have a lot of kids and we go through these quickly. Someone also thought that there are too many chocolate chips. That's up for debate, but I will note that while the recipe called for 4 cups, I had two 10oz bags of chips on hand which I used and it was a nice amount.

We thought this recipe was delicious. I halved the recipe and used half butter/half applesauce instead of a whole cup of butter. I only used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of dark chocolate, which I cut up fine.  It was plenty sweet and my husband loved them.  The test will be if my grandchildren love them!  Even with half the recipe,  I had 4 dozen cookies.

To make these even healthier, I replaced the 2c butter with 1/2c butter plus 1c non-fat plain Greek yogurt plus 1/2c coconut oil.  In place of the 4-3/4c flour, I used 1-3/4c whole wheat flour plus 1/2c each of coconut meal, almond meal, flax meal and oat flour. They were so delicious and with these substitutions are also a decently healthy snack for my kids!

Hubs decided he was going to go on a diet while I'm 7 months pregnant and attempts to refuse my desserts when I make them. HA! Jokes on him because these are healthy (ish?) and now on the counter tempting him. Only changes I made was I was short on the pecans so I mixed in walnuts and cut the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. Honestly, I can't really taste the nuts. I scaled the recipe WAY back like others did and my 2.5 yr old is now inhaling them as we speak. First words out of his mouth were.."MmMmM chockit chip cookies YUMMY!" So there you have it. If the toddler approves, you shall too.

Great cookie. Hard to tell they are whole wheat ! 

Update: 9/8/2014
wish I could find a way to make these a little firmer. They just seem to soft for my taste. I keep making them though hoping to find a solution and the flavor is right.

Great recipe.  I brought these to work and they disappeared! You really can't tell that these are whole wheat.  These are the only chocolate chip cookies I will make from now on.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and used 2.5 cups coconut sugar. I also used bittersweet chocolate chips.  Instead of ground pecans, I used chopped pecans, since I like the added texture.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will probably sub a little white flour next time they were a little too cakey for me.  I halved the chocolate chips and added the pecans as chopped great addition.

Love these cookies.... I added hazelnut instead of vanilla and used carob chips instead also only used about half of the sugar. Had to cook the cookies for about 15 minutes. They turned out great and they will now be my go to cookies. Thanks for this recipe.

I scaled it down to 1/2 (30 servings...made about 2 dozen cookies).  I also used ONLY brown sugar (out of white and wanted to try just brown)...cookies are moist, chewy and wonderful!  Glad I tried it (I wanted to have some cookies but only had whole wheat flour)!!

These were quite good. I had no choc chips, so I had to crush up a dark choc bar..yum. I made a smaller batch, and subbed some applesauce for 1/4 of the butter. I added oatmeal to half of them for some extra texture, and they turned out yummy. I couldn't quite give it 5-stars--though that is not to say it wasn't an excellant recipe. Almost-perfect-but-not-quite I guess.

They were good...they didn't look particularly beautiful and some of them were gooeyer than others.  But the taste was right on!

Very good.  We too have made this our new Chocolate Chip recipe.  I made the full recipe, followed the directions to the letter, they are great.  I have put more than half in the freezer to use for Christmas.

We love these cookies. I divided the dough into two portions. I made 1/2 of the cookie dough less sweet for my husband and me. I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder for more chocolately flavor, without the sugar, and I added 1/2 of a whole freshly grated coconut to our portion of the cookie dough, instead of nuts. I also added 6 tablespoons of low-fat buttermilk to our dough. I baked ice-cream scoop size cookies for 18mins at 300F. (Coconut burns at high heat)! The coconut makes the cookies more crispy, and it curbs one's sugar craving. We do not end up eating all the cookies!!! For our daughter I added the other 1/2 of the freshly grated coconut. She likes her cookies sweeter, we don't. I also added 8 tablespoons of low fat buttermilk to her cookies. Great recipe. Thanks.

I was so happy to find a whole wheat chocolate chip recipe, and this one is great!  The whole wheat flour actually adds a nice texture and flavor.  I shrunk the recipe to 15 servings and made the cookies on the smaller side.  They took about 12 minutes.  The measurements in the recipe were perfect (I left out the nuts).  Will definitely make again!

These are now my family's favorite chocolate chip cookies. The only thing I did differently was omit the nuts (my family has nut allergies). They were so easy and absolutely delicious!  I wish I hadn't cut the recipe in half because they were gone in less than a day!

Amazing; plus, it is only whole wheat flour (unlike most).  I made mine with organic raw sugar (instead of white sugar).  They turned out a little over sweet, but next time I'll use a little less.  I also used pure cocoa chips.

Couldn't ask for anything better!!! The cookies come out soft and chewy! FYI, don't take them out too early. They will already look very brown with the whole wheat flour. Do bake them as long as the recipe says. I had to resist taking them out. My family ate them up, I cut the recipe in half because 60 cookies sounds like a lot, but after seeing how fast people ate them, I understand! I've made it 3 times, and the only change I've made is that I've added M&M's to the chocolate chips. The pecans bring out the great nuttiness of the whole wheat flour, too. Everyone would eat more whole wheat items if they tasted like this!!!

I also made once and added chopped dried cherries which is a nice addition if you feel like getting some more minerals in your diet!

Wow, I wouldn't call them healthy per say, but MAN ARE THEY DELISH!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have pecans and they were perfect!  A nice change from white flour CC Cookies and people are impressed to see you pulled off subbin whole wheat!

WOW! Before I found this recipe I always used to sub 1/2 the white flour with whole wheat in a normal recipe. It was never as good as these cookies! They bake up nice and fluffy....I let them cook till a little bit browner than the recipe said and they were perfect! I will never use another chocolate chip cookie recipe ever again!

Great recipe to incorperate whole wheat into our diets! This is my rendition:

1.33 c   brown sugar 
 .66 c   granular sugar
1    c   Crisco + 6 tbs H2O 
2        eggs 
1    tbs vanilla ext 
 .25 tsp orange ext 
 .75 tsp baking soda 
 .25 tsp salt 
3.25 c   whole wheat flour 
1    c   trail mix > rough chopped 
 .75 c   oats > either type
 .75 c   dried mixed fruit 
 .5  c   ground almonds 

Cream sugars, crisco, van/orange, salt & soda. Add flour, oats and stuff until creamy texture. Tablespoonfuls on ungreased sheet.

350*, ungreased, 10-12 min, 38-40 cookies.

Just made this recipe today and I was surprised they were so good. I couldn't really tell the difference with the whole wheat flour. Just a little bit, but not enough to make them bad! My husband really liked them too! Very tasty and I will make these again. Next time I will use walnuts instead of the pecans, because that's what we're used to in our chocolate chip cookies.

"It was awesome!!" - my 9 year old daughter's review...

I tried these when I did an ingredient search for chocolate chip cookies made with ww flour as I was out of all purpose.  I'll never go back!  These are FANTASTIC!!  I used ground almonds as I didn't have any pecans.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  My husband was also very impressed - although he rarely complains when presented with warm cookies and milk!

YUM. Instead of the white sugar I put sugar in the raw.  They came out great.  Suggestion:  they are kinda cakey, and don't spread out as much as I'm used to, so if you want them more wide and less tall, do that before you bake them. REALLY YUMMY.

These are fantastic!  I've tried so many chocolate chip cookie recipes and been happy with many of them,  but these are the BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  You could not tell they're whole wheat at all.  I'm not typically a big cookie eater myself, but my boyfriend and I could not get enough of these.  The only alteration I made was cutting the amount of chocolate chips in half, which I do with many chocolate chip cookie recipes.

I made a half batch using white whole wheat flour and ground almonds (kids have nut allergies).  I thought the whole wheat took some getting used to, but my kids didn't question them at all.  Kids LOVED them, and my husband's colleague stopped by and ate one, then another, then two more!  Excellent recipe, thanks.

Deeelicious! The whole wheat flour gave these cookies a great nutty flavor. I used almonds and ground them in a food processor so that they were very finely chopped. Also, I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/2 margarine. Still turned out yummy. I topped them with a cinnomen/sugar mix before baking. Family loved them and I love that they are made with whole wheat flour. These were fabulous cookies!
