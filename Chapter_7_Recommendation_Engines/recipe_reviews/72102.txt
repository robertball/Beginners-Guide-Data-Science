I have a ball with this recipe, used everything bagels, stirred galic powder, Italian seasoning salt and black pepper into the olive oil and brushed it on the bagels.  Then sprinkled with seasame seeds and Parmesean cheese before baking.  We were liberal with the oil, which makes this crisp but not dry.  Wow. Thanks so much

Excellent. Very minorly modified by using everything bagels, garlic powder instead of fresh, and Kosher salt sprinkled over them before baking.

These were pretty good little snacks - they were eaten quickly.  I used a combo of olive oil and butter, and used sea salt instead of regular salt.  I also cooked them longer to make them crunchier.  Overall - very good!

Nice little bagel chips.  I made them into small pieces.  I used cheese bagels that were about to bite the bullet, and I used garlic powder--was afraid the fresh garlic would burn.  The cooking times and temp were perfect--nice and crispy.  Thanks for a tasty snack!

Thank you for bringing this recipe "back" - I tried it last year during the holidays and everyone raved about it.  I had two holiday events catered, one I forgot to order appetizers.  I went to recipes.com and this is one of the recipes I had saved.  I omitted the salt and pepper and had it at the table.  I also had marinara sauce in small bowls and chopped eggs, onions and caviar to spoon on top of the bagel chips.  As one reviewer stated, "they went like hotcakes". Thank you, Robyn.

I used 1 regular bagel and 1 everything bagel thin.  It is hard to slice a regular bagel very thin without loosing a finger.  Made seasoning as directed.  At first the sauce went on the bagel slices very easy.  At the end, it was clumpy and would not spread evenly so added more oil.  Baked for 10 minutes.  Next time we will use any old bread/bagels and tear into pieces and drop directly into bowl of sauce to coat, then bake and use in salads.  These had a good flavor but not real strong.  Will also add more garlic and maybe a pinch of salt next time.

OK obviously when I saved this recipe I hoped it would work.  I was floored by the delicious results.  I used plain mini bagels which had been overlooked in the pantry, at the use 'em or lose 'em stage.  It was hard to slice them thin but it didn't matter that they came out uneven. I didn't measure the ingredients in the olive oil, used Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of kosher salt.  I kept an eye on them and removed the ones that were getting pretty brown at the 12 minute mark. They were wonderful!  Thanks to Robyn and thanks to all the cooks who posted hints tips and suggestions.  Made me look like a rock star!

The taste was really good, but I don't think I cut them thin enough to make them more crispy, will try again soon

Good, but you have to keep an eye on the oven.  The thinner slices burned.

You definitely have to cut these thin if you want them to stay crispy. I used garlic powder instead of fresh, and the flavor was good with the parmesan cheese.

Great idea! These baked perfectly in my oven at 350F for 10 minutes, then another 10 with the oven turned off. The chips sliced off easily into bite-sized pieces 1/8" thick. Then everything into a lidded tub to shake spices and oil mixture evenly instead of brushing on each chip. Any variation of spices according to your choice will work. I picked 1 tsp each of parsley & garlic in 1.5 tsp olive oil for one large bakery bagel.

I literally make these every week.  I buy day old bagels at the deli and adjust the seasoning according to whatever flavor bagels are on sale. But this recipe as it stands is still the best. Experiment if you want but this is a five star recipe on its own.

Sooo tasty! I really never knew stale bagels could have a second chance! These would be perfect with a nice dip, but they were satisfying as any chip on their own too with all the great natural flavours. I forgot the Italian seasoning, but it was still great. Needed to keep adding oil to have enough.

Okay, my greased cookie sheet started smoking, burnt a couple of the bagel slices, after 10 minutes. Did a double layer of cookie sheets...maybe too close to the bottom? not sure because both cookie sheets were smoking.

Very good! I used 1 teaspoon minced garlic and 1 or 2 teaspoons garlic powder. I had mini bagels in the fridge and used 4 of those. You can add the spread to them and put them right in the oven without needing to dry them out first.

These were pretty good.  The topping was too thick to apply with a pastry brush, so I just spread it on with a knife.  The flavor of the topping was a little too intense for me and I love SALT and GARLIC.

These were very good.  I placed mine flat and cut them that way (Sorta looked like an 8) The bagels I had were very dense and firm.  I like mine chewy so I cut them thicker.  Definately something to play around with but very tasty the way recipe is.

Served these at a small family get together & they went like hot cakes. 
I made a few hours ahead of time & refrigerated, then baked.  Did not find them to be dry at all.  Delicious!

I've made this three times, and we love it! I slice my bagels in smaller pieces and not only do they take the place of potato chips for snacking, they also make great additions to salads instead of croutons.

Use an electric knife to cut bagel or baguette, makes nice thin slices. I love these chips. I had put some fresh garlic & Chili's in a jar of olive oil 6 wks infusing; this was a great way to use them. I used the oil, and threw the chopped the garlic in. I picked some fresh herbs from the garden and threw them as well. It was excellent!

I had a leftover containers of Papa John's garlic butter so used that in place of the olive oil and reduce the garlic some. Yummy! I made two batches, one with quality bagels and one with cheap grocery store bagels. The quality bagels were definitely better. So simple and caters to my hesitation to throw food away.

These taste good but they were too oily. Next time I will lightly brush the bagels with the seasoned oil and then sprinkle the parmesan on top.

Lots of flavor and easy to make. I used "everything" bagels and the Kraft grated parmesan cheese.  I'd use more garlic next time, and maybe garlic or onion salt.

My family really liked these.  I served them with warm marinara sauce as a previous reviewer suggested - pizza sauce would be good with these too.  Our older son kept snacking on them.  Now I know what to do with those bagels that we don't eat right away.

Great easy recipe overall, but a bit on the dry side.  The olive oil and garlic really mixed well together.  Me ate it with marinara sauce to help ease the dryness.
