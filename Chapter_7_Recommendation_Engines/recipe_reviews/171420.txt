Just a tip for more flavor - when I make my homemade custard, I do so in a double boiler. After the milk is hot (not to boiling) I add (4) beaten egg yolks and a mix (in separate bowl) of 1/4 sugar, pinch of salt and 2-3 Tblsps corn startch. I slowly add the dry mix after adding the yolks into the hot milk and simmer until thick, stirring frequently. Then I add (1) Tsp. vanilla extract and (1) Tblsp. butter. This custard works great for coconut cream pie (wherein I add (1) cup toasted coconut after the custard thickens) and also for filling cream puffs. After it has cooled a bit, I pour it into a shallow bowl and cover w/plastic wrap, being sure to fit the wrap tightly around the top of the custard, thus avoiding watery custard when refrigerated. And using whole milk is the key, not low-fat milk.

Oh gosh this brings back memories. Jessie Parker a friend from years ago used to make this at Christmas to share with our Secretary's group. I remember it having strawberries or cherries sometimes. Oh the sherry was heady with that whipped cream...sighhhhh. Thanks for sharing.
