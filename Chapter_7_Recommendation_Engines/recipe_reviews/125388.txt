Word of caution for others thinking of making this recipe - there are some things wrong with this recipe. I am giving it 3 stars as written. Here is what's wrong, in my opinion: 1 cup uncooked rice takes 1-1/2 cups of water to cook (not 1/2 cup as stated in the recipe). It will also yield 3 cups cooked (Jasmine) rice (not the 1-1/2 cups leftover rice that the recipe states can be used). The carrot and onion amounts are too small compared to how much rice you will have, as well as the cashews and raisins (I actually measured out 1 tsp of raisins, and it actually equals 6 raisins ... that would be 1-1/2 raisins per serving!) The Maggi® sauce and soy sauce amounts are too much. If I had used those amounts, my rice would have been swimming in it. The directions call for salt, but the ingredients list does not show it (and it's not needed). Here's what I did, which ended up being 5 stars:  2 cups leftover Jasmine rice, 1 carrot (chopped), 1/4 of a medium onion (chopped), 1 Tbls Maggi® Jugo sauce, 1 Tbls of low sodium soy sauce, 2 Tbls green onions, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, 1/3 cup cashew pieces, 1 oz (small box) of raisins and 6 lychees. I also cooked the carrots and onion first, then added the garlic and proceeded on with the recipe directions. It turned out delicious!
