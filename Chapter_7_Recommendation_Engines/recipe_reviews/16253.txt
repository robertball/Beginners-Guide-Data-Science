Really good recipe.  I put it in the slow cooker after letting the meat marinade for an hour.  I think the time in the slow cooker really helped.  Meat was very tender and full of flavor.  Added cornstarch to thicken sause and served over rice.  Very Good!!!!

Absolutely delicious! The sweet and sour combination is fantastic, especially with the heat that comes from the chili sauce.  I actually made them in the crockpot.  First I browned the ribs in the olive oil and then dumped them into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients, cooked for about 4 hours on low and they turned out PERFECT.  These ribs were such a hit the first time I made them, I've made them several times since.

Wow!  2 thumbs up!  This was a delicious meal!  I wasnt sure at first, but the results were D-LICIOUS!  I wasnt sure how hot the chili sauce would be and wanted it to be ok for my husband so I only added about 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 cup it'd asked, but we couldnt taste the chili at all so it went great.  I did try using crushed pineapples like others recommended, but I didnt have a preference, but husband would of prefer the chunky afterwards.  Since it was very stewey, which, at first I was not sure about, but was GREATLY surprised by the results, I'd made jasmine rice to compliment it.  I highly recommend having the ribs and its sauce served over white jasmine rice for a complete delicious meal!  You will not be disappointed with this dish!  I'm a beginner in cooking and this is a definate keeper in my recipe drawer!  Thanks Adrienne!

I have made this delicious recipe several times and always get '2 thumbs up' from hubby and son.  It is one of our very favourites.  I use a Thai chile sauce and use less then the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for. Give it a try as you will not be disappointed.

I let the ribs soak in the sauce for an hour before cooking as recommended in a prior rating.  Time consuming recipe since I had to make my own chili sauce but I have to tip my hat, great recipe overall.  Thanks, will make again!

very good. I think it would have been better if the ribs soaked for at least an hour in the cold marinade then baked for the 2 hours.  long process but worth the wait.  like a soaked in sweet/sour taste.

The ribs came out with a excellent flavor of sweet fruit and hot chili sauce. I would usse just half the amount of chili sauce but this is a personal perference.

We all just love it!! I wasn't sure if I was suppose to add the juice of the pineapple, but I did. I also added the whole jar of chili sauce. Splashed some vinegar into it too. At the end of baking,I stirred in some cornstarch mixed with a little cold water.
Served over white rice.

'cest bon!! We doubled the pineapple & onions, and used "Rooster" chili PASTE (hotter/spicier!). Suggest cornstarch to thiken the juice/gravy. Served over extra wide egg noodles. This as also a wonderful recipe for PORK, CHICKEN, or CABRITO!

This recipe sounded so good, but my Family really disliked it. I ended up
taking the ribs out of the cooking liquid, put them in a new baking dish 
and covered them with our favorite BBQ sauce so we could eat them.

Great recipe!!!!  I had some short ribs we had found on sale at the butcher in the summer, and froze them up.  So I just defrosted those and followed the recipe to the tee (except I cut everything in half since I only had 2lbs of meat, and I sauteed the onions with the meat).  The meat fell apart with the touch of a fork, and was fabulous with some of the sauce drizzled over the cut up meat!  Even the 2&4 year olds loved it!  Definitely a keeper!!

We just had the short ribs for dinner.  They were so yummy.  We made mashed potatoes and shredded brussels sprouts with pancetta.  We followed the original recipe using Thai chili sauce and an other review suggested but we would add a dash of hot sauce to kick up the taste next time.  To cut down on the calories and fat, we made the mashed potatoes with a little butter, a little half and half and canned chicken broth to make them moist without adding more fat.  My husband sliced the brussel sprouts and sauted them in a bit of olive oil and a tiny bit of butter along with pancetta and shallots.  We added the pan sauce to the short ribs and mashed potatoes at serving and the trio (short ribs, light mashed potatoes and shredded brussel sprouts) made a memorable dinner!

Fabulous! I used more chili sauce to cut the sweetness, crushed drained pineapple and thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch and stock. Served with mashed potatoes my husband said that mine were better than a restaurant

I slow cooked it too. Added cilantro and chili powder b/c I had it. Not a huge fan of short ribs but this tasted good and was tender.

Loved these.  Made some variations, for what I had on hand.  Used roast, cut into large chunks.  No chili sauce, so used small can tomato paste and Sriracha sauce, about 1/4 cup.  Simmered in a frying pan on the stovetop.  I used the pineapple juice, which may have made it a little more soupy, but it was wonderful!  
Thanks for the recipe; am going to get chili sauce and try that, but will always add Sriracha!

This was okay.  I ate my portion, but my kids and husband wouldn't eat theirs.  It was extremely greasy from all the fat on the ribs and the flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't a meal I'd repeat either.  I think short ribs just aren't a hit with my family, no matter how they are prepared.

I made this for my family last night.  My husband and I loved it, the kids were split 1 to 3.  It was really sweet, I think it would be better with more spice.  I browned the meat in a fry pan, then mixed the rest of the ingredients in that pan and putl everything in my crock pot on low for four hours.  It was easy and therefore will be going into my rotation.l

Pretty darned good - I didn't have the opportunity to marinate like other reviewers suggested, but it was still quite good - used fresh pineaple, tasty!  Also didn't have chille sauce around so I used ketchup and tobasco type sauce - worked out very well.  Will try it again for sure.  I also don't have a Dutch oven so I used a frying pan for the first part (browning the meat) and then a baking pan with foil for the baking part - worked well.

Delicious!!  Never made short ribs before.  Thank you to all reviews-helped me revise for my family and everyone loved it!!  My 12 year old daughter even said it was best "meat" I ever made :)  They told me to send in how I made it.
Read that it was a little sweet, and since my son doesn't really like pineapple..I left it out.  Also, since I was omitting the pineapple and some reviews said too much chili sauce, I used 1/4cup.  I didn't soak ribs in water or marinade, but I seasoned them with salt and pepper after browning and cooked in dutch oven in oven for about 3 1/2hrs instead of 2, turning oven down to 325 after 3hrs.  Added more beef stock as needed and salt and pepper to taste.  Served over egg noodles with bread for dipping.  Was delicious!!!!

This recipe is wonderful...I serve them over rice and with a chunk of crusty bread for soaking up the juices...My parents loved them, and my grandfather who never says he likes anything said they were the best short ribs he has ever had.

I'm not sure this worked for me, but I cooked them in a crock pot.  The flavor was strange, but it could be the result of the slow cooking.

I made this recipe today and it was yummy.  Hubby liked it but said more pineapple would have been better, so will remember that next time. I did not have any chili sauce in the house so made my own from a recipe from this site.  It was better than bottled and much less expensive!  Will make my own from now on.  We will have this again I'm sure.

I'm disappointed. Tastes like something is missing and kinda like stew. Think I will stick to soaking my shortrips in teriyaki sauce and bbq on the grill. Wish I could figure out what the missing ingredient was. It's almost there.

I made these the other night with boneless beef short ribs, substituted crushed pineapple for the chunks, and served over rice. They were fantastic! My husband made me promise to make them again. This recipe is going into my regular rotation. Next time I might try to thicken the sauce a bit with a little cornstarch after they've cooked.

I loved these ribs!!!  I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks so my boyfriend would eat it.  He loved it, even after I told him about the pineapple!!

This was a very good meat recipe.  My husband particularly enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the meat.  Would make again and share with company.

This recipe is amazing. Just the right blend of ingredients. It comes out so tender and flavorful. I serve it with rice or egg noodles as the sauce is so yummy AND you have plenty of it. It's not too runny or thick - just the right consistancy. I have made this dish 4-5 times and followed the recipe to a T. It is just wonderful. I just needed to add...after looking at many of the "other" short rib recipes this one seems to have the fewest ingredients and least amount of prep. In my opinion if you can get the best out of less - go for it.

I followed the recipe then cooked these in a crock pot, and they were delicious.  The sauce cooked up rich and dark brown and very flavorful.  We ate it over rice, but it would be equally as good over potatoes.  It is a recipe that I will keep and use again.  

note*  I added extra pepper since we like our food extra spicey.

These are really great ribs! I trimmed off the extra fat and browned them up. I only had bone broth so that’s what I used and I had to make my own chili sauce. Like others, I cooked it for 4 hours on low in the crockpot and use cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I served it over homemade egg noodles with crusty no-kneed bread. Yum. I also took the suggestion of one reviewer and threw the bones in the brown pot with water to make beef broth. Great idea!

I have made these several times - every time they have been Wonderful - Sometimes I spice them up a bit with jalapenos or  hot barbecue sauce - Every age loves them - I prefer the crockpot method versus the oven - seem to come out better that way. Very tender and moist

I loved this dish but forgot to put in my previous review that I used crushed pineapple and I think that's why it came out excellent. It mixed in really well with the onions and sauce. I suggest trying it this way first!

Superb!!! Only thing I would do different would be to do a little more sauce.  I cooked in 260 degree oven for 4 hours in my dutch oven.  Will definitely use this recipe over and over.

Very good.  Wanted something a little different, so instead of browning the meat in the Dutch oven,  I put them in my smoker for 2 hours, using peach wood.  Then I put them  in the pot with the sauce, 1 HR covered and 30-45 minutes uncovered.  Delicious!

A terrific and simple recipe for short beef ribs. Takes some preparation (browning of meat) and assembly of all ingredients, but worth every minute of your effort !
 I bought half of bone-in ribs and half of boneless of same cut, and it turned out great ! I also used the whole 20 oz can of pineapple chunks in their juice; instead of beef broth used low sodium chicken one and while browning beef to 1 Tabsp of OO added 1 Tabsp of unsalted butter.   

  I browned and cooked the meat in same heavy aluminum pot with tight lid.  Meat was ready in less than 2 hours.  I served it with potato puree- and it was delicious, with a lot of sweet and sour sauce. 
Thank you very much for the recipe, Abloon.

Didn't have any chili sauce so took ketchup and added a couple T. of Tiger Sauce and 1 T. Chili Paste Sauce.  As others suggested, thickened with cornstarch/water.  Made a nice sauce to put over rice.  Used boneless ribs.  Forgot about taking the cover off halfway through cook time, just cooked covered the whole 2 hrs. and they just fell apart.  Really good no-fail recipe.  Thank you!

This recipe wasn't bad but it was missing something.  The sauce was too soupy (although that could be fixed with the cornstarch.) It was also missing something I couldn't put my finger on.  We ate it for dinner but I don't think I would make it again.

I give the recipe an average rating. The Sauce needed something...I added a little cornstarch and it thickened nicely, however it lacked flavor besides the beef flavor. I would add to this sauce a can of whole cranberrysauce stirred in or Whole Black Peppercorns, maybe three or four teabags & some port wine or sherry. The beef ribs themselves are Always Good.

These were not the best short ribs I've ever had. Actually, they weren't very good at all. I'm giving it 2 stars simply because the sauce was good over mashed potatoes. I just didn't care for what the beef turned out to be. :o(

This is an excellent recipe---goes great with mashed potatoes.  Next time though I may try using crushed pineapple instead of the chunks.
