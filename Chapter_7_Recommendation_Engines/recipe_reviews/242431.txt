This was a such a simple and easy side dish to get together, but, looked very impressive with the addition of the toasted walnuts and feta. I loved all the flavors together.   I wanted my green beans cooked a little longer, so, I blanched my green beans in boiling water for a few minutes, immersed in an ice bath to stop the cooking and then drained and dried very well before adding to the hot pan to warm through.  If you like green beans very crispy I would follow the recipe as is. Very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

Used pecans rather than walnuts.  Marinated beans for about an hour in lemon juice and garlic before cooking.  Best green beans I've ever had.

Loved the combination of the feta & walnuts with fresh green beans. Will shorten the sauté time of the garlic as it was beginning to burn with the 4 minutes on the heat before the addition of the green beans. Maybe try sautéing the garlic for a shorter period, add walnuts sooner, then scoop the walnuts out before adding the beans, adding the  walnuts at the end to keep them toasty-crisp. Will definitely make this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving, as I am not a huge fan of the customary green bean casserole.  Fabulous, so easy, and it looks very elegant.  This recipe is one of my new ‘foolproof standard  dishes’.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed the nuts to sliced almonds. Took to church singles where it was served with pork roast, mashed potatoes and deviled eggs. They loved it!!

This was wonderful, though I made some modifications. Like others, I preferred my beans less crunchy, so I steamed them until not quite done (don't like mushy either). Cooled them to keep them green, and added them in at the appropriate time.
This was simple and a huge hit!

Yummy!  Didn't have fresh green beans (its January) so I used frozen french green beans.  I'm not very good about eating veggies, but I will definitely be making this again!

This was so easy and a total hit with my company at Xmas. I'm making it for the next family get together. I loved the mix of flavours!
