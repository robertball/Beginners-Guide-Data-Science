I ended up adding an 2 lemons instead if one for more flavor. When it set, I thought I had overlooked it, but it came out with a perfect consistency and flavor. I cut out the bars with a pizza cutter.

Made these for thanksgiving.  As others stated it wasn't lemony enough I added the juice of 4 lemons and it was outta site! My dad hates just about everything we've ever tried to make in the gluten free world but he raved continuously and kept asking if they were really gluten free!! Plus no one else at dinner knew they were "lacking" either :)

I definitely found that the lemons you use make a huge difference. mine came off a tree in my yard and were used within an hour.  Also my lemons tend to be rather sweet (as lemons go.)  I'm going to try again. soon. Thanks for your comments!

I needed a gluten free dessert for a party and tried this.  Mixed reviews.  I didn't care for the gritty rice flour. Other really liked it!  I would prefer more lemon flavor too.  Not bad.

They definitely were not lemony enough and too eggy.  I would add like 4 lemons and the crust was a little too thick for my taste. Good basic recipe, just needs some tweaking

This is my go to gf lemon bar recipe. I have tweaked it adding more lemon juice and zest is a must. To give the crust more body, I sub half of the oat flour for quick oats. The people at work were raving about the crust. Thank for this recipe, it made me so happy when I could not eat wheat.

It does not taste particularly lemony. I don't think I'll use it again...

Rated with my tweaks - lemon zest isn't optional, it's necessary. It gives loads of flavor! I used the zest and juice of 2 and 1/2 lemons and it was very nicely flavored. Two might be enough if you prefer medium lemon flavor. I loved the crust combo - the oat flour and white rice flour work very well together for a great texture. I did have to bake mine around 40 minutes - as she says, watch for it to set rather than browning or time. When you jostle the pan in the oven, it shouldn't jiggle. Once it set, i gave it a few more minutes and it came out perfect.

I took advice from others and added more fresh lemon juice. Still No lemon flavor, just crust.  I am a lemon bar lover and this was the worst recipe of all the ones I've made.

These bars are amazing!  I will never use a different recipe for lemon bars.  Doesn't matter if you're glutton free or not.  However I do use at least 2 lemons sometimes more depending on how lemony I want them to taste.  I also grate the outside of the lemons for the zest.
