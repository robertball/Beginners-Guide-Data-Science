The kids enjoyed these - thanks for the tips of rolling the corn dogs to set the batter. I had really long dogs, so I cut them in half and that worked much better fitting them in the pan. Thanks.

These are good, it does have a thicker dough that adheres to the hot dogs. We liked the flavor also. Thanks for sharing!

This was so much fun! I didn't have bacon drippings & I think I'll leave out the garlic next time. (Not for kids) I will warn you, this makes a lot! I should have halved it. I used leftover batter to fry up some squash slices...with a little syrup, they tasted just like corn fritters!

I made these for my grown up sons.  We live in South Africa and we've seen corn dogs in movies and wondered what they were like.  I used Vienna sausages.  I substituted soured milk for the buttermilk and sunflower oil for the bacon drippings.  Instead of cornmeal I used maize meal which is a staple food in South Africa and can be cooked in a variety of ways and served for breakfast with milk and sugar, or with a tomato& onion sauce as a side dish with meat.  The batter was a bit thick and I dabbed it on with a spoon, twirling the stick as I went along.  I also twirled the dog in the hot oil for a bit before letting it go to fry on one side til golden and turned it to the other side.  They came out really yummy and were polished off before I could take a photo??

We followed the directions but could not keep the batter on the whole dog. I would dip the dog in the batter, turn it, then as I pulled the dog out of the batter only half was covered. They were still good. I used a small fryer so it worked best to cut the dogs in half.

This is a great recipe - we had to add slightly more buttermilk as the batter was initially too thick to dip the dogs, but other than that, they turned out perfectly and tasted just as you'd expect a corn dog to taste - yummy! For a slightly more "adult" flavor, we served them with the Sriracha Aioli sauce from this site as a dipping sauce. Perfection!

This would be good with ketchup.
