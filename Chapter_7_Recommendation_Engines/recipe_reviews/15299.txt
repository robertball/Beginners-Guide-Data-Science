These were very dry and hard to shape into balls.  They practically fell apart.  They are dry tasting also.

I loved these cookies, but had to use almonds instead of pecans (food allergies!).  The aren't too sweet so my kids weren't crazy about them, but my husband and I really enjoyed them.  I did roll them smaller than suggested.
