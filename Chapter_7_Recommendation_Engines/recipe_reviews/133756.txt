see my notes--use fresh berries, make natural sauce by adding sugar [not much} a squeeze of lemon juice and a little grand marnier.  Cream- add sugar, sugar vanilla and grand marnier!

This is a very refreshing twist to a classic tiramisu. I could only give it four stars because it does lack a little in flavor without the coffee liquer. I will definatly make this again.

Very pretty presentation, but really lacked in flavor.  The cream/cheese mixture does need some added flavor, whether it be some sugar or vanilla.  We had to mix the whole thing together because the cream just overpowered everything else.  Will try it again sometime with some adjustments to the cream layer.

This is an excellent recipe as others have said. However, I agree with other reviewers that it requires a couple of tweaks to make it truly outstanding. First of all, you really should use fresh fruit, not frozen. Also, you need sugar and some type of flavoring both for the berry mixture and the cream mixture. Otherwise, it really is quite bland. I found Grand Marnier was the perfect flavor to complement the berries, much better than coffee liqueur would be. With those changes, it was a hit both times I've made it so far. And it's beautiful to look at too, bonus!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe and it seemed to be a hit. Next time I think I'll try  fresh fruit instead of frozen.  Although it was good with the frozen and still not too sweet.

I made this with fresh berries and I should have read the hints to add sugar and vanilla, as we found it a bit bland, especially the cheese/cream mixture.  I will make again using the suggestions in the reviews.
