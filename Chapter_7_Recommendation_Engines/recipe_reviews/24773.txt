This dish turned out excellently for me, about what I expected, BUT....after adding the orange juice and simmering, I looked at the excess of liquid and did the following:  Drained the OJ off the carrots, added the br. sug. and margarine to the carrots in the saucepan, whisked the drained OJ with the salt, a dash of pepper, and 1 1/2 Tblsp cornstarch, drizzled honey over the carrots, mixed the cornstarch mixture in, and simmered 3-4 min more.  Turned out fantastic!

The taste pf these ingredients together was really good, however, I gave four stars because after reading many reviews I decided to preapre them a little differently than the recipe states.  I cooked the carrots in one pan and then added the ingredients for the sauce to another and whisked in 2 tsp. of cornstarch and brought it a boil.  It made the perfect glaze that I then just poured over the cooked carrots.  That seemed to work to solve the problem with the glaze that many others reported.

I just made these for dinner, having tweaked a recipe from Sue Spitler.  The ones I just made were so good I thought I'd share the difference.  Cook the carrots in a little water.  In a separate pan make the glaze: 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (at the very least), 1/4 teaspoon allspice, 1/4 teaspoon ground mace, a little pad of butter to aid against sticking to the pan, a few pinches of parsley, 3 or 4 dollops of ORANGE MARMELADE.  Heat and stir till thick.  You may want to let the glaze cool a little bit because it gets really hot and stays hot longer than expected.  The marmelade lends some little chunks of oranges and I think is super super ... super tasty.  Obviously NOT for those on a diet... the less you cook the carrots the more carrot flavor... the more you cook the carrots, the easier to disguise them (for children or those who usually don't like cooked carrots).  Though I tweaked the recipe, I think Ms. Spitler is still right that you can also use yams and/or beets for this.  I think the glaze is sooo good that it could be used with ice cream or... basically in dishes replacing caramel.  Yum.  (serves about 4 people as a side dish)

This recipe is terrific! I love glazed carrots, but the syrupy sauce in my normal recipe kind of gets to me.  This recipe isn't syrupy, and has great flavor.  I par-boiled the carrots, and transferred all ingredients to a frying pan, to cook down the sauce, and give the carrots a nice roasted texture. Great recipe Heidi!

add 1 pinch of cinnamon for flavor, and 1 tsp of corn starch to thicken the syrup. PERFECT!

Instead of cooking in water, I cook the carrots in orange juice- it gives a more orangy flavor, I think I added a little ginger with the brown sugar and butter. I've made these also with regular carrots- slicing the carrots in thirds on  the diagonal. Have made these several times now- my whole family likes it.

Oh my goodness, was this fantastic.  I can honestly say it was one of the best recipes I've made from here and such a simple one.  I didn't have any orange juice, but I remembered I had some concentrated in a can in the freezer from another recipe.  While the carrots were cooking I went ahead and scooped out about a forth of a cup, put that in a small bowl, added the brown sugar, salt and just about a TBLS of water, and about 1/2-1 tsp. of cornstarch and mixed it all up, blending well.  I also remember another reviewer adding cinnamon, so add a very small amount about an 1/8 of a tsp.  When the carrots were done steaming, took out the steamer basket and poured out the water, put the butter in and let it melt and poured in the orange juice/sugar mixture.  Stirred well to blend and added the carrots.  As it heated it thickened and produced the most magnificent glaze I have ever tasted. Every single carrot was just beautifully covered in this thick glaze. I will always use this recipe!!  I think the concentrated oj made it a little more pronounced and loved it.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  Goes wonderful with pork chops or any main course for that matter.

Very easy and kind of tasty, but pretty boring despite touch of ground ginger I added.  If you
are looking for a nice carrot recipe, try these.
If you are looking for an exceptional carrot recipe,
look elsewhere.

I loved this recipe.  I used real butter and light brown sugar and they came out great.  I decided to make this because I had some left over baby carrots that I had used for minestrone soup, and I wanted a way to use them up.  HOwever, next time I think I'll use more orange juice because a quarter of a cup just wasn't enough.  I could barely taste the orange flavor.  Other than that, the carrots were fantastic!

Great side dish!  I used a steam in bag of baby carrots and added a little cinnamon and ground ginger.  The orange flavor was a little light, so I added a bit of orange marmalade which thickened it up and added a bit more orange flavor which was just what I was looking for.....

I was trying to make the recipe from memory so used 1/4 orange juice, 2 TEASPOONS brown sugar, pinch of salt and 1 TABLESPOON olive oil, 2 teaspoons cornstarch. Tasted plenty sweet so I don't think the omission of brown sugar was bad at all. Probably would have had a nutty taste with the butter but I was trying to be a little healthier.  I cooked the carrots until a little tender to the fork. Then put them in a colander to drain. I bought the saucepan back on the burner, put in the pre-mixed glazed ingredients and brought to a boil. When it started to thicken a little, I added the carrots and then let the glaze coat them and boil down.

modified the recipe a tad, as honey is better for you than brown sugar. Added two tablespoons of honey and changed the salt for Mrs. Dash's, about a pinch or so......turned out outstanding

I have never loved cooked carrots, but I was looking for a way to prepare then so that my family would like them. This recipe is perfection! I have people eating cooked carrots now that never would before. I do agree with an earlier post to make the sauce separately and add to the drained cooked carrots at the end. Don't change anything else--it's perfect.

This is a good base recipe, but changes are needed.  I cooked the carrots in a separate pot from the other ingredients.  I cut the sugar to 2 Tbs and it was still plenty sweet for us.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and whisked in 2 tsp of cornstarch.  I brought it to a boil and poured it over the carrots.  Making these changes I would rate it 4 stars.

Delicious! I added 1 tsp. cornstarch to the OJ and made the sauce separate from the carrots as others suggested. They were really great and I will definitely make my carrots this way from now on!

I have been making these for years, and I think that many of you are overthinking it a little.  Cook until almost tender in a large saucepan/frying pan with a little water ... add water as needed to get to tender.  Add juice and continue to cook down to tender, adding a little brown sugar now, as the thickened juice will work with the sugar so you don't need corn syrup.  Outstanding with a little ground ginger added.  Can also be made with brown sugar substitute.

These are my favorite way to eat carrots now!! So delicious. The only changes I make are to use regular size carrots, cut up, and I add a tsp. of corn starch to the glaze mix to make it thicker and stick to the carrots. These are so easy and definitely worth a try!

Fantastic simple recipe.  The second time I made this I thought I'd roast the carrots tossed with the rest of the ingredients rather then boil the carrots first and it turned out fantastic.  Next time I think I'll roast it all again but try substituting Cointreau for the orange juice, yummm.

I have been making this recipe for years. I strongly suggest using fresh orange juice not the bottled. It gives another flavor layer. Wonderful at any time of the year.

Quick, Easy, Perfect Flavor, Not Syrupy Sweet
I followed the recipe exactly as written.  What I really enjoyed, besides the ease, was the light flavor, it didn't take away from the carrots, just added a nice light flavor, not too orangy and not too sweet.  Thank you Heidi for sharing a great recipe!

Made these last Saturday when we had my group from work over for a pre-Thanksgiving smoked turkey.  Everyone loved these carrots.  My hubby is not crazy about very sweet carrots, but these had a mild taste, very good!

Yummy! The orange juice seemed to bring out the flavour of the carrots. I followed other reviewer suggestions and doubled the amount of juice and after simmering the carrots at the end for 5 min. in juice, removed them, added the remaining ingredients and then some cornstarch paste, then put the carrots back in and the glaze then clings nicely to them.

The flavor concept was great, but after reading reviews, I was concerned about sauce consistency.  So I  cut the sugar down  to 1 Tbsp., and  cooked the carrots in the orange juice.    (Basically, I made Julia Child's recipe Glazed Carrots, but substituted oj for the broth.   From Mastering the Art of French Cooking I - not an intimidating recipe at all!)  I did not use  the cornstarch.

Nice and simple. I didn't even bother with corn starch because there wasn't enough sauce to fuss over. But the carrots still tasted good, with just a touch of orange flavor. I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe was great! I added a little more orange juice the second time I made it, which made it more flavorful. Definitely a keeper for appetizers!!

This was excellent.  I followed the suggestions of a few people who wrote in.  I cooked them in OJ rather than water.  One thing to definitely follow is to make the glaze in a small separate sauce pan so you can work out the corn starch clumps, no differently then gravy; and you will want to still add the OJ as prescribed (ignoring the OJ you boiled with) to the recipe.

Thank you all for a wonderful recipe!  If you have small kids, you may want to try this to get those veggies into those kids!

WoW! Great carrots! As other suggested I thickened it up with cornstarch, added some cinnamon and I only had dark brown sugar. I think the glaze would be great on other things such as fish or ham.

I love this site, almost everything I cook now comes from here. luv it..but today I saw this recipe and thought why take a perfectly healthy vegetable  and do this to it..I am sure it is extremely yummy, but by all means lets continue to add sugar and fat to it so our children will not think it is a veggie and lap it all up..

This is an excellent tasty carrot dish.  I added a tablespoon of cornstarch along with a tablespoon of water to thicken the orange juice / brown sugar mixture and it turned out great.

These carrots are fantastic & I'm not a big fan of cooked carrots. I did make the glaze a different way because it wasn't very easy as directed. I cooked the carrots & drained first as directed. Then I set them aside while I made the glaze in a separate pan.Then I added the carrots to that pan & stirred & simmered as directed.Very yummy.

I don't like carrots, but I'll eat them this way!  I double the sauce (more sauce per carrot) and use a higher ratio of juice to sugar/butter (a little healthier; I've made this many times now and I just kind of wing it with amounts).  It's definitely better to cook the sauce in a separate pan (thanks other reviewers!) and let it thicken without the carrots getting in the way, then add carrots later.  Great recipe!

This was a great side dish! Tasted Fresh and not too sweet. I used regular carrots, peeled and sliced, because that's what I had on hand. Instead of boiling the carrots, I steamed them until tender. I also didn't have any orange juice, so I used the juice of one navel orange. It worked wonderfully. It was slightly sweet without the tanginess usually associated with oj. I also added a dash of ground cinnamon. This is definitely a keeper!

Not too bad. Easy enough to make but not as strong a flavour as I expected and I think next time I will try to thicken the glaze so that it is more glaze like. A nice change from normal carrots. I will keep trying with this one.

Excellent!  My family asked to have this every week.  I made a few changes to suit our taste:  used 4x the amount of juice (1 cup), 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the butter and 2 pinches of salt.  Cooked the carrots til barely soft (about 5 minutes) then removed from the pan.  Simmered the juice til reduced (about 6 minutes) then added the sugar and butter, then put the carrots back in.  This way the carrots don't get too soft.  If only cooking broccoli this way would get them to eat it . . .

Very good! These were a wonderful addition to my Rosh Hashanah dinner, where glazed carrots of some kind are part of the traditional meal. These were wonderful! I actually halved the butter and doubled the orange juice, and just let it all reduce unti it was glazy - superb. I will try these year round! Went very well with salmon, by the way. Thanks!

I thought these were a tad on the sweet side but good none-the-less. My family really enjoyed them so when I make them next time, I cut back on the sugar. Who can beat a good and easy sidedish? Thanks Heidi.

This was a perfect side dish for roasted chicken, along with parmesan new potatoes!  Hubby decided that instead of cooking on the stovetop, he blended all the ingredients and poured over the carrots in a casserole dish, then placed in the oven with the chicken and potatoes.  They turned out fabulous!

My family loves these carrots.  I had to use granulated sugar the first time I made them (thought I had some and didn't) and they were just as good.  I actually reduced the amount of brown sugar to 2 tablespoons because it was too sweet and overpowered the flavor of the carrots.

This came out GREAT! Changed things a bit according to other people's reviews. I covered the carrots in orange juice and set them to boil. Meanwhile, made the brown sugar melted butter glaze, and added a pinch of nutmeg and a little cinnamon. Once the carrots had boiled and became tender, we combined the orange juice carrots and the glaze. Realized the glaze was too liquidy, so we put it back on the stove and thickened it with some flour and water. Got the glaze to a nice syrupy consistency, covered the carrots, powdered the whole dish with a little additional cinnamon. Served and was a big hit. It was delicious, and we'll make this again next Thanksgiving!

I've been making these for years. It's a nice twist to plain old buttered carrots when you don't have a lot of time. We always called them "sunshine carrots". So easy and they go with just about anything.

Made this last night.  I sautéed red onions in the butter first then added the cooked carrots, juice, and brown sugar.  I also added flour to the juice after it cooked for a little bit and it thickened nicely.  Absolutely will make again!!  Next time I will try roasting the carrots rather then boiling.

Very good, very easy! I did parboil the carrots and make the glaze separately, and added some cornstarch to thicken.

This was wayyy too orange-y for my taste and really liquidy.  I think I'll stick with the regular brown sugar glaze instead.

I really liked this recipe- very simple, and the orange taste complemented the carrots but didn't overwhelm them. The only thing I disliked was how long it took the carrots to soften in the boiling water, but that's not a problem with the recipe itself.

Very good and we enjoyed these. Used fresh squeezed orange juice and it really brightened up the flavor. Even my "I don't like carrots" son commented that he would like to have them again. Thanks for sharing!

Wasn't a fan of the orange flavor with carrots. I'll stick to more of a honey flavor from now on.

A great way to get your kids to eat their carrots. Generally I don't like to "sweeten" things preferring for my kids to learn to like the actual flavor of the item but cooked carrots were just not cutting it for anyone. This dish changed things. Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good. I enjoyed the light citrus flavor. I did add some cornstarch towards the end of the cooking to thicken up the sauce. Thanks

Thanks for sharing this recipe!Outstanding!  My family  loves these glazed carrots. It's my new favorite veggie dish! I tweaked it a bit to our taste.  I boil the carrots in equal part water and oj until tender crisp.  Drain completely, add butter and brown sugar, and crank the heat up until the butter/brown sugar sauce thickens and adheres to the carrots.

A nice side dish.  I dissolved corn starch in water and added to the carrots right before removing from the stove to thicken up the sauce.  Sprinkled with allspice and served.  UPDATE:  Changed this recipe from 4 stars to 5 stars because everytime I serve this people just rave over it.  And it is so easy!

My whole family loved these carrots!  I added some fresh squeezed orange juice to the water when cooking the carrots, plus a lil ginger for added taste to the glaze.  The sauce isn't too runny when you slice up the baby carrots rather than leaving them whole like pictured.

These carrots are the best!  I have made them at least 3 times and am always pleasantly surprised.  The only thing I do recommend is to add a bit of honey to make the glaze a little stickier.

My family loved these. I have tried a few of the carrot recipes on this site and I love this one! I steamed the carrots, added some vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon of all spice. Wonderful!

The orange juice in the recipe gives the carrots a nice flavor.  I think next time, I would try it with honey instead of the brown sugar for a slightly thicker, sweeter glaze.

I had a dinner party last night and used my guests as test subjects, and they loved these carrots!  I ran out of brown sugar so I only had a TBS to put into the recipe, but I turned out perfect to the taste. Not too sweet, but just enough.

The orange juice added a nice twist, but I still like a sweeter glaze. I would also cook them longer to make the carrots a little softer. I'll probably try the recipe again but use more brown sugar and maybe a hint of vanilla flavoring.

Tried this for Easter and it was a hit. I didn't think I would like cooked carrots on their own as a side, but cooked like this they were fantastic!!! I did add a 1/4 tea of vanilla but didn't really have to. Just came back to look up for another gathering I'm having since everyone loved them.

Fantastic! I made this recipe to serve 45 people. I doubled the glaze to be sure I had plenty. This is the first side dish I have given 5 stars. I did add cornstarch to thicken as other reviewers suggested!

I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of corn starch and they were VERY tasty! Everyone enjoyed them at our Thanksgiving gathering.

Used oj concentrate and just enough water to dissolve the brown sugar. Then cooked it down into a nice thick syrup. Added a pinch of cinnamon. Cooked the sauce in a seperate sauce pan and then poured over the cooked carrots. I then had to travel with it so I covered it and all the thick glaze got all watery. Bummer. But definitely liked the reduced sauce and will use again. If I travel I will keep the glaze seperate.

I cooked the carrots in orange juice as suggested by other reviewers.  The carrots turned out very tangy which overpowered any sweetness.  Will not make this again.  I really didn't care for it and ended up tossing the whole thing.  Still on the hunt for a good carrot dish

This was very easy and very good.  I used a little less brown sugar than what the recipe called for.  I cooked the carrots ahead of time and let them sit.  Then I made the glaze, and then right before serving I added the carrots to the glaze and reheated.

I prefer a "candied" carrot.  So I used cinnamon, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla. This gives it a sticky feel, I just pictured organge juice making this too runny.

I made this twice.  It definitely needed cornstarch to thicken the glaze.  I ended up adding ginger & cinnamon to my second batch because I felt like it needed a little something extra than the recipe called for.  My family ended up devouring that second batch.

These were good. I followed the advice of reviewers and mixed the juice with 1 T. cornstarch in a small pan. Then I added the sugar, butter (use only 1 T), salt, and a dash of cinnamon and cooked until thickened. Then I added the mixture to the carrots. The family loved it.

These were delicious! I used regular carrots rather than "babies" and sprinkled them with Apple Pie Spice (cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg) and tossed in a handful of raisins as they simmered in the orange juice (next time I think I'll include some onions, too). Like others, I thickened the glaze with a little Corn Starch. I doubled the recipe and was really glad I did.

I have made this 3 times in the last week, my son and I both hate carrots with a passion, but with this glaze we ate all of veggies:-)) I made the sauce separate and did not put OJ in the carrots while cooking
My family also really liked this and had some left over glaze and step mom kept  it til the next time she cooked carrots. I did however use corn starch the last couple of times, I do prefer it with the thicker consistancy. Mind you I have had a head cold since trying this so hope they are as nice when my taste buds return...:0)

I thought this was good, but husband and kids thought it was a little to "orangey" -- that's what I get for trying to slip something new in on them, I suppose.  Nice change from plain old glazed carrots, though -- and they may get them "slipped in" on them again.  Afterall, Mama cooks what she has a taste for, right?

I would give this 10 stars, if possible.  These were wonderful, and soooo full of flavor.  I have had other recipes for carrots that have been good, but these are above the rest!  Thanks for the recipe - I cannot wait to make carrots again!!

I didn't think this was very exceptional, but perhaps this is a reflection of my taste and not the recipe itself. I much prefer the naturally sweet taste of carrots. Baby carrots are so delicious on their own - why bother sugaring them up? Stewing the carrots in orange juice is a good idea, but drenching them in fattening butter and sugar isn't great for your heart or your waistline! I might use this recipe for very large or slightly bitter carrots (or for family members that wouldn't touch a vegetable with a garden rake otherwise!), but for baby carrots I would just steam them until tender and serve! If you make this recipe, then steaming the carrots instead of boiling them at least preserves more of their nutrients.

The orange juice gives these carrots a nice flavor. Not too sweet at all.  Good recipe.

Easy healthy weeknight veggie.  I boiled baby carrots until fork inserted easily, about 10 minutes.  Drained in strainer. In same pot melted butter, added orange juice (fresh from Orange since I didn't have juice) and then added about half tsp cornstarch. Boiled til thick, about three minutes. Added back carrots and tossed. Loved it.

Good as written with a very mild flavor. The sauce isn't thick or syrupy but its not meant to be. I added a little orange zest the second time I fixed it and it was more to our taste. A nice change from heavily glazed carrots.

I did the recipe exactly as it was written and it was very buttery and sweet but it was hard to taste the orange and I think it would have been nice to have a bit of tartness. But overall it was good.

Interesting flavor with the hint of orange, but the acidity gives it a strange bite.

Brilliant. I wont' use so much brown sugar next time. My carrots were sweet as is. I also think I can save on the fat content and lessen the butter. This was a delish recipe. thanks HEIDI S.

An excellent side dish! I made a vegan version using Earth Balance instead of butter. I used agavenectar instead of brown sugar to sweeten.

I added tarragon and a little molasses for an even tastier carrot dish.  Tarragon is great with carrots and a touch of molasses during cooking makes it even richer.  A little molasses goes a long way.

I like these carrots. I only used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, as 3 is too sweet for my taste. Also added 1 tsp of corn starch, as others suggested, to thicken -- thus, the four stars. Love the orange juice.

I ma giving this 3 stars based on taste, it was good.  But it was more like 1 hour to cook until tender.  Not a dish you can make quickly after work for dinner.

Very simple, quick and easy to make. I was hoping for a stickier glaze, but I will follow the recommendations of prior reviews using cornstarch next time. No complaints from my family/guests - everyone loved them!

I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. It was good (I'm not too fond of cooked carrots, but my family is), though I think I should have added a bit more brown sugar to make it a little sweeter. I did add a little more orange juice. My family loved it, and I will make this again for them.

This was a very tasty side and quite simple to prepare.  We used Ziploc Steam bags (1 lb = 6 min, 2 lb = 12 min) and prepared the sauce separately.  Added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. corn starch to help it set up.  After the carrots were done, just drizzled the sauce over top!  I'd add some fresh cracked pepper next time.  We'll make it again, thanks Heidi!

Wonderful! Did what others suggested and seperately cooked carrots and sauce and mixed at end, adding a little bit of cornstarch, cinnamon, and honey for thickness. Nice orange sweet flavor!

These turned out great due to a combination of suggestions and the original recipe. I simmered the carrots and made the sauce in a different pans and added 2 tsp. of cornstarch before bringing the sauce to a boil and then poured it over the drained carrots. It was excellent.

These were fabulous! I did take the advice of another review and put everything in a frying pan, after boiling, to reduce the sauce to more of a glaze consistency. The results were spectacular. They may have even swayed two people who didn't like carrots!

A good idea, but I agree with another review stating that it doesn't really take on much orange flavor. Fine, but not great.

This was a tasty recipe for baby carrots.  I steamed the carrots, drained, stirred in 1/4 c. orange juice and the rest of the ingredients along with a little honey.  Not a show stopper, but good.

I've been making these for years, one of my husbands favorites. It's best with orange juice, but sometimes I don't have it, so I'll use half a capful of orange extract. If you use that, be careful because it is strong. :)

I really liked this recipe. I read the others reviews but decided to make it the contributor's way first just to see. And there definitely was too much liquid when I was done. I used a slotted spoon to serve the carrots though, so it wasn't a big issue. I used peeled carrots cut on the diagonal instead of baby carrots, though. They had a great flavor and weren't too sweet which seems to be my usual problem with glazed carrots.

When I first started added the OJ I thought I just ruined my carrots. I really dislike the smell of cooking OJ - but once the butter went it it started smelling better to me and the flavor was fantastic!

I personally did not get to taste this recipe after I made it.  I was looking for something my daughter would enjoy and she absolutely did not like this.  My son managed to eat it, but also stated he did not like it.  But, my fiance really liked it.  Thats why I at least gave it three stars.

The whole family liked these carrots! Could probably cut down on the brown sugar to make it a little healthier and it would be just as good. The only changes I made were I added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Very tasty and easy to make!

We loved these carrots.  I didn't have orange juice, so I used fresh grapefruit juice (sweet).  It was still good, so it must be even better with OJ.

This makes carrots taste yummy!  I was disappointed that the liquid turned out so watery, but as other cooks have indicated in their reviews, adding a little cornstarch thickens it right up!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it!  I cooked it the night before and it tasted better the next day.  Instead of boiling the carrots i steamed them.  I also used the pre-cut carrots that you use for dipping rather then peeling and preparing the carrots myself.  I made a ton and there were almost no leftovers.  Thanks!

These were a bit sweet for my taste, but it may have been due to my proportions (I made a much smaller serving). My husband gave it a 6 of 10, stating that the ceiling on carrots is a 7... pretty good, but I'll keep searching for better ways to sneak veggies into our diet!

I didn't have orange juice, so I substituted with mango juice.  Came out very good!

I would actually rate this between a 3 and 4 but I made these for Easter as a quick side dish and was hoping they would have been a tad more flavorful with a thicker glaze.  They weren't bad mind you, just not as "sweet" as I thought.  Very easy though and thats a good thing!

I thought these were great as is.  I made them for Christmas dinner.  For some reason, no one else ate them though. Oh well, more for me.  TFS!!

These tasted good and were a nice change They didn't have any orange flavor hence the three stars. I think next time I will cook in oj as some other reviewers suggested. Also I didn't add all the brown sugar as I still wanted to taste the sweetness of the carrots.

I thought these carrots were OK but nothing special.  They looked very pretty & glazed but tasted very simply like carrots with orange juice & brown sugar.  Not sure what I expected but had hoped for something a bit more "special."

My family liked this dish as a side to meatloaf! I sliced baby carrots and steamed them in the microwave for 3 minutes first. Then I sliced an orange in half and hand squeezed the juice into a casserole dish. I added the carrots with a tsp of honey, a tbsp of brown sugar, sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves and poured melted butter on top. It baked for an hour with the meatloaf and came out with a nice flavor!

Very good, easy to make recipe.  I had never made glazed carrots before.  Mine ended up too sweet.  I added more sugar thinking 3T wasn't quite enough.  Next time I will follow the recipe.  I intend to make this again.  Always looking for a more creative way to make veggies.

Being that my family is very "health-orientated"  I cut back on the sugar and the butter slightly, but they were very much enjoyed by all!

I truly dislike this dish. No taste whatsoever! I follow all the instructions to the "t".  I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving Potluck at work. No one touched it.  It was embarassing.  I would never make it again.

I tripled this recipe and made it ahead for Thanksgiving.  I steamed my carrots rather than boiling them in water.  It came out even better than I expected.  My guests are going to love them.  I'll bet I don't have leftovers of this one!  Thanks for a recipe I will use again!

Great! I cut the brown sugar from 3T to 1T, because of a carb sensitivity. The result was nevertheless gratifying.

My daughter and I are not vegetable lovers.  I am always in search of new dishes that we can try that will change our feelings about eating them.  We gave this recipe a try and we really enjoyed it!  It's easy, tasty, and quick.  I highly recommend it.

I didn’t have orange juice so I used coconut-pineapple juice and it was great. It might be interesting to try other juices too.

I like this very much, partly because it is so easy. My wife is Very fond of it.  I add a bit of nutmeg and a few drops of orange extract.

fast and easy, I think I added more juice then it called for so we had plenty to put over the carrots and whatever else we had but it didn't change the cooking time or anything. 

will make again.

I made these carrots exactly as directed. There wasn't much orange flavor. Next time I'll add some orange zest for more depth of flavor. I would also add a bit more salt. Other than that, it was good. Will definitely make this again. It was quick and simple.

it is yummy, but not enough to entice any of our four boys. I think they need more sugar and butter, which kind of defeats the purpose. :(

Such a great recipe! I make the sauce in a separate saucepan, substitute brown sugar with maple syrup or other unrefined sugar (muscovado) and add 1-2 tbsps of tapioca/arrowroot starch to thicken, then pour over my carrots at the end. I also use just regular carrots, coined. Make these thanksgiving, Xmas, and Easter every year and they’re always a hit.

Slight twist to this. I boiled the carrots in orange juice then added brown sugar and butter. I then thickened sauces with corn starch. Everyone loved it.

I have not made this recipe, but I feel I just have to tell how I make carrots.  After the carrots are cooked and drained into a serving dish,  I put some butter and a spoonful or two of orange marmalade into the pan, melt and stir together, and add the carrots and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon so as not to break up the carrots..  My husband always loves them as does everyone else.  Seems a lot easier than this recipe, which I'm sure is also delicious.

Instead of using baby carrots, I cut full sized carrots into equal-sized sticks it tastes pretty good and I taste the butter, but i don't really taste some of the brown sugar or OJ flavors. I might try and play with some of the ingredients next time. But it's a great quick make as a side dish!

These carrots were very good. I kept the measurements the same but followed suggestions from several reviews. I sliced full sized carrots into 1" pieces and cooked them in orange juice until half done.  Then, removed carrots, added remaining ingredients and  let thicken. Added carrots back into liquid and cooked 'til done. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

The secret to good cooked carrots is to not over cook them. These were very good and the timing was spot on!

I made this exactly the way the recipe directs. My family loved the mild, sweet flavor, and I would definitely make this again. I also like the fact that the recipe is inexpensive to make as well as easy.

I used Halo oranges that were getting somewhat old. Put three in the juicer and that fulfilled the recipe requirement. The dish was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I took the advice of others and added corn starch, cinnamon, ginger, a little nutmeg to the orange juice.  Basically, that is how I cook my yams and sweet potatoes.  The only difference is cooking the glaze separately as others suggested.

I'm giving this 5, because I didn't follow the instructions and don't want to negatively skew the score.  I added the OJ, butter, brown sugar, and salt after draining the carrots and simmered it all together for 5 minutes.  I thought these were good, but not my favorite way to have carrots (which is roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper), but I was looking for something different to try.  If I make it again, I'll follow the instructions exactly and rerate it.

I made these tonight for dinner.  Glaze turned out great.  If done correctly,  no corn starch is needed.  These need to be made in a good quality frying pan,  on medium heat,  as the orange juice reduces, it thickens and makes a beautiful glaze.  Make sure you don't let it burn.  I think the next time I make it,  I will add a little ginger.

They weren't bad. They weren't fantastic. I think maybe my taste buds just couldn't handle carrots that tasted like orange juice. On the upside, my carrot hating ten year old ate one.

This recipe was simple, delicious and always comes out perfect. Everyone including people that normally will not eat carrots loved these. I served them with Lemon Pepper Tilapia, Pan-seared scallops witha white wine reduction and roasted asparagus with a balsamic brown butter sauce. Thanks Heidi S for this wondeful recipe. For those of you that have not tried it yet do yourselves a favor and make it very soon.

I really did not like the carrots. My family didn't really care for them either. I tried adding the cinnamon and corn starch but didn't help very much. Maybe I should have went all out and changed it up as much as everyone else said.

Possibly good if you leave recipe as is. I followed comments from others and did not like the sweet flavor.  The glaze tasted like they should be on a bun!

Carrots were delicious, I would drain off some of the orange juice next time and create more of a glaze before serving.

i cooked this as a side dish with some deer steaks i had, it complimented it quite well. the whole family liked it and there was no leftovers. the sauce that came from the carrots was nice over the deer as well, it gave it a nice light sweet taste to it.

I found the carrots to be too bland tasting and had too much liquid left over.  I think there needs to be a little bit more flavor and possibly a thicker sauce.  I will make a few changes and try again.

These were, as best as I can describe it, "blah".  Edible, but didn't do anything for me.  I used regular carrots instead of baby carrots (which are supposed to have more carrot flavor) and still hardly had any flavor.  I used a little bit more carrot to soak up the juices, so I didn't need the corn starch.  Since it was pretty bland I added cinnamon as others suggested and I added a touch of nutmeg as well and STILL had me thinking, eh, I'm leaving my carrots for stews and soups until I can find a better way to use them up.  Don't think I'll be making these again.  Sucks, I was excited about these too.

These  carrots are very tasty...but the sauce is very, very runny. I added some cornstarch mixed with a small amount of water while the sauce was boiling...this helped a lot, forming the juice into a glaze that coated the carrots. The only other problem I had with this recipe is that the carrots didn't take on as much orange flavor as I would have liked...all in all, this is a simple, tasty side dish that I would make again. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the suggestions of others to make the sauce in another pan and add 2 tsp of corn starch, but I think next time I will add less because there was a slight aftertaste, but this was a really great recipe and I will be making it again.

This recipe adds super flavor to cooked carrots.  I used diced baby carrots so they cooked even faster.  There was some liquid remaining in the saucepan that didn't glaze on the carrots, but I spooned that over white rice.  Delicious!

carrots are like water to me. i know they're good for me, but they just don't taste that great plain. this recipe jazzed them up and made them delicious. i made as is, tho i drizzled a little honey over them (as another reviewer suggested) right after adding the OJ and then added the brown sugar and butter right after that. my goal is to dirty as few dishes, pots, bowls, etc, as possible, so i didn't go to the trouble of thickening it up as others suggested, but i think they tasted great just the same.

I'm sorry, but this was too orange-y tasting.  If you like your carrots to taste like oranges, then this recipe is for you. Otherwise, try brown sugar instead.

This recipe worked fine, 'though I did tweak it.  I didn't have cornstarch, but was able to get the glaze going.  The trick is to melt the butter, then add the sugar, and cook it down, before slowly (bit by bit) adding the orange juice.  Before adding the orange juice, I added mustard seed, and then added a bit of dill after the orange juice.  YUM!

I had to add corn starch to make it less runny and stick to the carrots better. Otherwise it tastes like carrots in hot orange juice. Thickening agent is a must.

Very good. I made a few changes - I added a bit of cornstarch to the oj and mixed it up before adding it to the carrots. I also grated some orange zest and added that for extra flavor.

I was excited to make these for dinner tonight to go with a pork roast.  I ended up being very disappointed.  I didn't have an entire bag of baby carrots.  What I used was probably 3/4 of a bag.  I cooked them in a steamer bag in the microwave for 2 minutes less than it said.  When I simmered them with the orange juice I had to double the amount because it hardly covered the surface area of the pan.  As directed, I simmered for 5 minutes and added the brown sugar and butter.  I wanted to add the corn starch to thicken it but there was no orange juice left to thicken, it had all cooked away even after doubling the amount.  The carrots ended up being way overcooked to the point of mush even after undercooking them to begin with.  They did not taste like orange at all, just like sugary mush, almost like the consistency of baby food.  I am deleting this from my recipe box and will definitely not be making these again.  I apologize for the negative review, but I was thoroughly disappointed.

Very tasty. Thanx Beki! Like others, I mixed turkey w/ sauce vs layering. Added an entire jar of spaghetti sauce to meat. Next time, I'll cut down the sour cream & cream cheese by a few oz. each as it was a bit rich for me. But, very delicious! Also seasoned up the meat alot w/ Italian spices. pepper, onions & garlic. A big hit w/ family.

These carrots were good.  Just a little sweet and a hint of orange.  They would be really good to serve on Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I followed the recipe with one exception (which I don't think changed the flavor)- I cooked the carrots in 1/2 water 1/2 OJ.  Next time I'll just cook the carrots in water like the recipe says and drink the OJ ;-)

These were very good, but I think I'll also add a little cinnamon next time.  My guests all said they liked them.  They were all eaten, so I guess that's a pretty good sign.

this was just okay, I didn't have enough glaze and had to add more orange juice, then it was too orangy. I could have done something wrong...not sure if I'll attempt this one again.

These were tasty, but not nearly as flavorful as I was hoping for. Next time I will definitely simmer them for an hour or so.

Made these for a Sunday dinner at Mom-in-laws; everybody loved them. I did simmer them for 1-1/2 hours to thicken the juice and the baby carrots weren't overcooked. Just mouthwatering. 
Keeping this recipe in my recipe box.

Couldn't taste the orange juice.  Added cinnamon and allspice, per other user's suggestion, and couldn't really taste that either.

These carrots are really good! Something about the orange flavor just goes really good with carrots this way. I didn't have any corn starch, but I'll try next time to make the sauce stick a little better, but really good just the way the recipe says!

We were not too impressed w/ this recipe, I personally thought it was bland. But, we thought it was okay. I don't think I'll make it again, but it was edible.

I cooked the carrots in the OJ first. This did give added citrus flavor, next time I will also add some orange zest.

I used a previous posters suggestion and drained the OJ, added a little honey and used cornstarch.  I think I simmered a little too long, as they came out a little lumpy.  Flavor was good.  Please be careful if you are preparing on a ceramic stove top.  I nearly ruined my brand new stove!  Didn't even think about that when choosing this recipe.

I took the suggestion of cooking the carrots in the orange juice and cooking it down into a sauce, but the flavor was just all off. The carrots were sour without any orange flavor to speak of...didn't enjoy.

These are good!  I added a little less butter than was called for and they still turned out great.  A unique way to add some excitement to plain old carrots.

I would give this 20 stars if I could! Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe and added the cornstarch like another user suggested. I also added ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. I will be making this every time we have carrots!

Excellent!!!  I've never tasted better carrots. I doubled the recipe for our Easter dinner.  I don't think I have enough.  I plan on getting another bag of baby carrots before dinner is served.  The recipe is so quick.  I'll have plenty of time. Just follow the recipe.
