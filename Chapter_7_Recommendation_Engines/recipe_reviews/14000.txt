Did a salad luncheon for 50 people.  I made 6 different salads.  This one was the winner.  I got many requests for the recipe.  The overnight marinade does the trick.

This salad is light and refreshing.  It is great at a cookout when you can deviate from the usuals like baked beans.  It was truly great!!

I doubled the dressing, and toned it down with a little water.  I used cider
vinegar because I didn't have balsamic.  I served the salad over rice and 
soy "ground beef" as a cold dinner.  Everyone liked it, including the kids.

Made as directed and there is a little too much marinade but it does have a great flavor. We will play with this one.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it it's really good. I'll be having it as side with my cold cut sandwiches for lunch this week. I liked that there was no oil and the only fat comes from the beans. The roasted red peppers really give it something special. Next time, I will add more tomatoes and maybe also a can of garbanzo beans and increase the dressing. Great recipe and very versatile. I could see many different types of bean or peppers in it and it would still be delish. Thanks Kathy.

Though not that quick as it tastes better when it's left to sit overnight, it is a nice variation from the typical 3-bean salad recipes.

This is very good!  I recommend adding a little water like the other reviewers to tone it done a little.  This is great by itself or over a little spring mix salad.

This wasn't bad, but it just seemed to be missing something. Aside from using black beans and fresh basil, I followed the recipe exactly, and I let it marinate overnight (I also roasted my own red peppers). I'm not sure the parsley and basil are the best herbs for this dish--for me, it needs something deeper, like thyme or maybe savory. Plus, I think it could use more veggies, but that's just personal preference.

I thought this salad was okay, but not the best bean salad I've eaten.

I added 2 Tb of olive oil to the balsalmic vinegar mixture.  This was relatively easy to make.

A promising assortment of ingredients, but the dressing lets the whole thing down.

we both liked this very much after i salt and peppered the hell out of it.. maybe it's bc my balsamic vinegar is cheap? idk.. left out the sugar.. didn't notice the basil.. i roasted my own peppers.. and used our own home grown tomatoes.. didn't marinate overnight.. so i'll try to blame that.. ~~UPDATE: i tried this a second time and it was much better.. i made this for bf's daughter and realized that this recipe really is meant to be on the sweeter side.. this time i think i went more in the direction for what the recipe was intended to be.. i did make some modifications but followed everything else as written.. i subbed orange bell pepper for the yellow, black beans for the kidney, cilantro for the parsley, soy sauce for the worcestershire, and left out the lettuce.. i made sure to let this marinate for a full 24 hours this time.. bf and his daughter really enjoyed this.. so i'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars.. ty for the recipe
