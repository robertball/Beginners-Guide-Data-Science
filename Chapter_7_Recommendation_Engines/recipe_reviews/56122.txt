I read so many reiews about these cakes I just had to try it.  I prepared with 1 1/2 lbs. of catfish fillets and baked them in the oven 1st.  Added my own special seasonings as if I were going to eat them that way.  I cannot imagine boiling the fish with absolutely no seasonings-- it would have tasted bland for my taste. I used only half of a medium sized onion.  I flaked most of the fish instead of mashing.  I used 2 tbsp. of Hellmann's mayo which is my preference and lastly I used 1 1/2 cups of Keeblers crackers. This recipe is a keeper-- Absolutely delicious!!! The taste truly isn't that different from crab cakes.

Having read the reviews, I decided to make these cakes for dinner last night.  The only change I made was to dredge the cakes in flour before frying to give them a crispier crust.  They were delicious!  They make excellent sandwiches when on a bun with tartar sauce and crisp lettuce.  I will certainly make them again.

Good recipe. I seasoned the fish with salt & pepper, and then cooked it in 1/2 white wine, 1/2 water and added a bay leaf. I used seasoned bread crumbs (as I didn't have cracker crumbs on hand)and used only 1/4 cup of oil (you don't need to drown these - just a little oil will make these browned & crispy). Next time I wouldn't mash the fish so much - I'd leave it kind of chunky, and maybe use slightly more fish (or less bread/cracker crumbs). I was surprised that my husband really liked these - and he even suggested that I should make some "mini" catfish cakes as an appetizer for our next party. You could certainly use tilapia, or any other white flaky fish for these (my mother has even made a similar version with canned tuna!)

The recipe was a hit!  It was quick and easy and delicioius.  I baked the fish (actually used white sole fillet) at 450 degrees for 10 minutes to retain the taste.  Then flaked it and mixed in all the ingredients with it.  I did coat the cakes with flour to make it more crispy.  I would also add a little salt and pepper to give it more flavor.  Otherwise, it was great!

These were great!  Baked the fish instead of boiling, to keep it from being soggy and losing flavor.  Used about a sleeve and a hald of crackers and it was just right.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly, except substituted Orange Roughy for Catfish.  I am a HORRIBLE cook, and these turned out amazingly well.  I always find a way to mess up even the simplest recipe, so these are truly foolproof!  My husband asks me to make these at least once a week now.  I serve them with a big salad and it is a delicious dinner.  I make the fish mixture in the morning (it only takes about 10 minutes) and put it in a Ziploc bag in the fridge, so the prep time is very quick in the evening.

Thank you so much for sharing Bobbie!

I had to rate this recipe because it is hands down one of my faves.  I use Keebler Onion flavored crackers instead of the plain buttery ones the recipe calls for.  I just can't compliment this recipe enough!  Delicious.  So much better than crab cakes!

Excellent. Better than most crabcakes I've had as appetizers in some fancy restaurants. Catfish nuggets were on sale this week at the gocery, and they work perfectly in this recipe instead of the filets. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was watching the Foodnetwork today and Giada was eating crab cakes. My mouth was literally watering, but I didn't have any crab in the house and didn't feel like going out. I happened upon this recipe and I have to say it really hit the spot!!!! I used Hellmans rather than the sweet stuff and coated my cakes with Panko instead of the crackers. So good and thanks Bobbie!

We love fish and crab cakes are one of our favorites, but this is BETTER! Like others have said I baked the fish with seasoning first. Then I used 1/4 cup egg beaters and planko bread crumbs instead of cracker. I also dipped them in the breadcrumbs and baked them instead of frying... much healthier! I sparayed a baking sheet with Pam, layed cakes on it and then sprayed the cakes With more Pam. Bake for about 30 minutes, turning over half way through. Delicious!!!!!

GREAT idea for catfish- I needed to find a recipe for catfish nuggets I had in freezer- this was perfect! Some of the reviews claimed it did not have enough flavor so I doubled the seasoning- added a tad more mayo and when I boiled the fish I used a bay leaf more cajun seasonings and garlic salt.  I did not mash up the fish- I just mixed it in with other intredients- was wonderful! I paired it with creole rice recipe from here that was perfect! made no alterations to recipe

These were so good! i used sweet and spicy mustard instead and used a variety of spices like paprika, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, etc instead of the old bay. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and it was delicious!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe, and only had one sleeve of the buttery round crackers, so added saltines to make up for the remainder. The cakes came out beautiful, and the family loved them.

My boyfriend loves catfish but is super picky about his food. I was bored with just baking the fish so I decided to try these out because he also love crab cakes. These were awesome and easy. I used regular mayo and dijonaise because I didnt have miracle whip or regular mustard. I also used a mix of bread crumbs and that corn meal fish fry stuff because, again, I didnt have the buttery crackers on hand. I also baked the fish instead of boiling.

Have been making these for about 5 years now.  Pls bake the fish first then mash w/ a fork.  They need a good dose of old bay and a little more hellmann's and mustard.  Before serving brush on some buffalo wing sauce, you won't be sorry.  Catfish nuggets work great and are about 1/3 the cost of fillets.  I bake mine 450 degrees for 13 min.  To the lady that said they were not as good as Maryland Crab Cakes, LOL. No, because there is NO crab in them!  Plus $2.98 per lbs for catfish nuggets as opposed to a can of lump is now up to $20.00 per lbs.

I enjoyed the idea of these- a cheaper version of crab cakes.  They had a great texture (I also coated with a little flour to make crisp) and they held together nicely.  I would have preferred more seasonings- maybe some lemon, hot sauce, cayenne, etc.  I think I will keep this in my recipe box but will try again with some stronger seasonings.

I've made this with all kinds of fish - tilapia, cod - it's all good.  This recipe is a huge hit.  I serve the cakes with a sauce made from equal parts mayo and sour cream (or plain yogurt) seasoned with lemon juice, salt and dill, and watered down with a little bit of milk to desired consistency.  Yum!

Excellent.  Took others advice and baked at 450 for 15 minutes instead of boiling.  Used a sleeve of Ritz and that worked great for us.  What a great option for fish!!

This recipe was delicious!!! (although I slightly modified it) I took other reviewers ideas of baking the fish first but instead of just salt and pepper I spiced it up with lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic, cayenne and a seasoning salt. I crushed up the total amount of crackers but added til I like the consistency of the fish (about a cup and a half). So good!!! Will definitely be making these again :)

These were really good.  I'm wheat sensitive so used Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs instead of crackers.  Didn't have Old Bay Seasoning so used Chef Prudhomme's Seafood Magic.  Other than that followed the recipe and they were crispy and yummy!

What a nice change for a quick meal.  I did parboil the fish and it kept it so moist, I liked that idea.  I used non-fat mayo and Egg Beaters for the egg.  I used Special-K tomato basil flavored crackers, only about 3/4 cup.  It made the perfect patties.  I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  I cooked them with Pam instead of the oil and once nice & brown put in a 350 oven that was baking the mac & cheese for about 10 minutes.  Perfect!  I'll make these again.  I'm thinking you could use any kind of fish you like but I like the idea of fresh caught catfish.

I just made these today.  The only thing I did different was I baked them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes flipping them over half way through.  Was very pleased-hubby loved them!  I will definitely make these again!

This is a great recipe--easy, quick and sooo delicious! I used swai fillets, reduced fat crackers and mayo and I don't think they were missing a thing. Family all agreed that this one is a definite keeper...thank u for sharing!

So easy! Very good alternative to crab. I needed a little more spice but this is a great base recipe to start with! I think I'll do a southwestern style next time with cilantro and corn in the mix. I will definitely add it to my arsenal. Thanks!

These were great.  I didn't know what to do with the catfish someone gave me, so I tried these and we all loved them - even my 4 year old and 6 year old.  My husband actually did the cooking the night we made them - they probably tasted even better since I didn't have to do the work!  We did use 3 shallots since I didn't realize I was out of onion, and an all natural Ranch yogurt salad dressing because I was afraid mayo would be too bland.

Our family loved these! We were given catfish after a family fishing trip and none of us are fond of plain catfish, but I made these and everyone loved them... even my toddler. The only thing I would change is they were not spicy enough, I served hem with hot sauce on the side, next time I will incorporate it in the mix. Overall a great recipe!

Just made this. I followed the recipe for the most part but did dredge in flour and bake in oven instead of boil. I didn't have the spice called for so I used some celery salt, crushed bay leaf, salt and pepper as well as some dill. Delish!! Super easy and fast.

Delicious! The only change I made to the recipe was to add more Old Bay Seasoning. My husband doesn't like crab cakes, but he really enjoyed these and asked me to make them again.

Very good and interesting recipe, and surporisingly easy to make! One criticism--I would greatly reduce the amount of onion, and definitely fry the onions in a pan first to tenderize them.  Also, I slightly increased the amount of mustard and Old Bay, to give it a bit more zing.  Excellent dinner, though!

Wow! With a few modifications this was amazing. First of all, I used tilapia as it was the only fish I had. I seasoned it with salt, pepper and Old Bay, then baked it at 425 for a few minutes until cooked through. For the mixture I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of powdered mustard, 1 teaspoon Old  bay, 1/2 teaspoon of Emerald's Bayou Blast Seasoning,  (any Cajun or Creole seasoning would have worked) a dash of Cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons Hellman's light mayo, 1 1/2 cups crushed Ritz crackers, 1 beaten egg, and a dash of salt & pepper. Then I lightly coated the patties in flour and fried until golden brown. I drizzled the patties with Thousand Island and placed them between 2 pieces of untoasted honey wheat bread to make mock crabcake sandwiches. (A burger bun would have worked too). It was AMAZING. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it.

OK, I guess. Seemed like there should have been less cracker crumbs or more fish. Very "bready". Good concept though, hence the 3 stars. I will try again, maybe just add enough crumbs to hold mixture together.

This was simply amazing.  So many great flavors.  I used Ritz crackers, premarined cajun catfish.  I lightly coated catfish in olive oil to keep from trying out, and baked catfish at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Then followed the reciepe the rest of the way!  For an extra treat make the white sauce from the Fish Tacos on this site!!!  You could definetly half the amount of onion.  I coated some cakes in flour and some normal...not a lot of difference.

These were pretty tasty and very easy to make. I didn't have any Old Bay on hand, but I used salt, pepper, and fresh garlic. I also used stone ground mustard instead of the yellow stuff. I fried up a cake, and it was good, but I thought it needed a kick, so I diced one whole jalapeno and added it (seeds and all) to the mixture. This was absolutely delicious; it spiced things up and added a real depth of flavor. I will be making these again, but will probably try them with less onion and fewer crackers.

Much better than I expected.  As others recommended I chose to season (S&P, Old Bay, and garlic) bake the fillets in the oven first at 450 for 10 minutes then flaked.  I also used course ground Dijon instead of the yellow mustard, substituted bread crumbs for the ritz and surface coated with a fine wheat flour to reduce oil permeation.  Turned out great when shallow pan fried.  A great basic recipe that you can tweak a million different ways to suit your own taste.  Moist, flavorful and easy to make substitute for crab cakes that I will certainly make again.

Yum! I am not a huge fan of catfish but these were great.  I used 2 lbs of catfish and doubled all the ingredients except for the cracker crumbs (the double batch was holding together with just the 2.5 cups of crushed crackers).

Pretty good but very crackery. As others mentioned, broke this up into bigger chunks and also dredged in flour before frying for crispier edges.  Made this with homemade tartar sauce (from this site).  Good stuff.

I made this recipe excactly as listed and the cakes were wonderful. Next time will bake the fish first and add more Old Bay seasoning and saute onion and maybe some garlic first before mixing together.

I dont like the taste of catfish and neither does my husband, but we had some frozen that we didnt want to go to waste so i decided to make this. It turned out great with a couple tweaks: used food processor to finely chop yellow and green onion and a little each of red, yellow and orange pepper. Used ritz vegetable flavored crackers chopped finely in food processor, added 2 eggs instead of 1 and baked the fish until flakey before adding to the mix. I didnt have old bay so i seasoned the fish first, and also added my own seasonings to the mix. I saw in one review not to use too much oil but i learned from past crabcake mistakes that if you dont use enough oil to go atleast almost half way up the cake, you'll find yourself with browned top/bottom with the middle mushy and/or not cooked well. Overall I give this 2 thumbs up coming from 2 people who hate catfish, this tasted awesome!

Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.  I NEVER make fish at home, because my teenage boys don't like fish (for such huge appetites, they are incredibly picky).  But I bought this Swai at the grocery store just to try it out  - only to later find out, that it's basically catfish.  I didn't know what to do - so I decided to try this recipe since it got such great reviews.

My 15 yr old almost licked his plate clean and went back for more.  My husband loved it.  Even my little ones (3.5 yr & 18 mos) enjoyed it. A BIG family hit!

Sadly, I did not have many of the ingredients called for so I used: Ranch dressing instead of mayo, bread crumbs instead of crackers, my own blend of spices instead of Old Bay.  

I also grealty reduced the onion - used about half instead a whole, and added green peppers.  Next time I'll chop the onions & peppers a bit smaller to help the cakes keep their form.

I'd love to give this 5 stars - but can't since I made so many modifications.  Next time, I'll try it as is - or who knows, I may continue to mix it up a bit - either way - I'm so excited to find a fish dish that my whole family loves.  Again - thank you, thank you!

OMG, these were delicious!  I made them 99% like the recipe called for.  Slightly put in flour before pan frying for browning purposes.  I loved them!  Mine made 6 nice sized cakes.  I had 2 and my roommate had FOUR!  He really did oooh and ahhh over this recipe.  I served it with homemade Rémoulade that I made on a whim, corn and salad with grated egg and bleu cheese dressing.

Delicious dinner.  THANK YOU for this recipe!

As a somewhat inexperiences cook, I appreciate attention to detail.  There are no cook times and because of that, my first two "crab" cakes fell apart due to my trying to see if they were brown.  Other than that, this is a delicious recipe.  I used tilapia instead of catfish, as they had none at the store.  It turned out really great!  I did not think to make a sauce, but it could have benefited from one.

Unbelieveable.  Blindfolded you would probably think you were eating a crabcake! I used Club crackers, about 1 1/4 cups and maybe 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. All 3 kids ate it - will definitely make again soon!

Though next time I would use more fish or fewer crackers (I used Ritz), these were delicious. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and coated them with flour before frying which gave an almost crunchy crust. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.

I don't know what I did, but my were too loose, and crumbled a little while I was cooking them.  I decided to add a little beer and flour into the mix, in hopes it would get it a little wetter, and bind better...seemed to work.  The beer added this amazing flavor to the cakes.  Highly recommend it adding a wheat beer if possible.

These were good and I will definitely make them again. However, next time I will double the Old Bay and use less of the crackers. I baked the catfish at 450 for 25 minutes as someone else suggested. Nice and quick!

Pretty good flavor.  I served it with a sweet chili garlic sauce and served it over a spinach salad.

My husband and I loved this dish! I changed some things, based on what I had on hand. I baked the fish (as another reviewer suggested -- thanks!), lightly sprinkled with Cajun spices beforehand (to give it an extra kick), and then used Zatarain's seafood breadcrumbs in the mixture instead of crackers. Great alternative to crabcakes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not the tastiest thing I have ever made. It was a lot of work with the cooking of the catfish and then flaking and mixing. I know that sounds like I am whining, but give me a good can of salmon and I am happy. I think the flavor was okay, more onion than I cared for. With all the prep time, I think I will just stick to salmon patties.

These were great! And so quick and easy too! I took the advice some other reviewers had given and used a little more fish than called for and I also only used about 1/4 cup of oil. My family loved them!

Delicious!  So far, everyone has enjoyed these! I probably used more fish than what's called for, so that makes up for some of the negative comments about filler.  Also, I sauted the onions before adding them to the mix.

This is the best recipe I've ever found online.  It's quick and easy, and even my daughter loved it.  The recipe is also very versatile.  I substituted mayo for the miracle whip and bread crumbs for half of the cracker crumbs.  A new family favorite.

Very quick and easy.  A sweet tasting fishcake.  Next time I may substitute a stronger tasting fish, maybe salmon for the catfish.  I didn't really taste the catfish. This will be a regular for me.

The idea was great. Boiling fish in plain water, not so great. Season and saute, then flake the fish. (Any white fish.)I also suggest sauteing the onion to soften and mellow it just a touch. And for goodness sakes, only a couple tablespoons of oil is needed, folks.

I may try adding seasoned Panko in place of the crackers next time. They just needed more oomph for me. Maybe even some jalapeno sauteed with the onion.

This recipe was so delicious and easy to make. It was a hit at a dinner party. The only thing I would say is that I had a very difficult times forming the patties. I tried everything,even used flour per other suggestion, but I couldn't  pick them up, so they looked a little funny. I will make these again, but hope I can figure out a way to pick them up to fried them. Following a few suggestions, I cooked and baked the fish like I was going to eat them as is, with all my regular seasonings. The flavor and the smell to die for. The only reason why its 4 stars is because of the difficulties I had to pick them up. Thank you!

This is a great recipe!  I baked the fish as many have suggested and used toasted breadcrumbs and higher portion of Old Bay seasoning.  I paired this with a creole rice and salad.  Turned out great with no leftovers!  This made my recipe box!

We loved these! I added minced garlic and used a Creole seasoning rather than Old Bay. I also dredged the cakes through a mixture of flour, paprika, salt, and pepper before frying for a crispy golden crunch. Definetly a recipe to make again and again.

Good but not Maryland Crab Cakes. I am from Maryland and although these catfish cakes are good, they are nothing like real Maryland crab cakes. I followed the recipe. Next time, I will use a very small onion, flake the fish, increase the Old Bay to 2 tablespoons, increase the mustard to 1 tablespoon and add 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley which is a must in crab cakes. These would be great as a party appetizer.

Made these tonight, yummy! I added a bit of chives to the recipe as I'm a nut with them, and broiled with a bit of butter instead of pan frying or boiling, still, such a yummy recipe and glad it was here!

i made these for dinner and my husband (usually picky about onions) gobbled these up. A few changes i made....i boiled the fish with a lemon and a bay leaf. also i chopped the onions then pressed them in a garlic press. also instead of crackers i buttered four pieces of white bread and toasted on both sides in the oven (because i didn't have crackers on hand). also i used regular cajun seasoning because i didn't have old bay. i also dredged the cakes in flour to give the extra crisp and hold them together better

Wow, this is awesome. The only changes I made the second time I made it was to lightly stir fry the onions since the hubs doesn't like crunchy onions and I added the old bay to the onions to get the flavor mixed in better, I also lightly dusted the cakes with flour, HOWEVER, don't use to much flour or you will get a burnt flavor towards the end of the batch from all the flour in the oil. Would make great fish sandwich patties.

I've made this recipe twice so far and I love it! It's one of those recipes that tastes like it took a tone of work but really didn't.
Instead of Old Bay Seasoning, I lightly seasoned them with Seasoned Salt, Pepper, Garlic Salt and a little sage. Before I fried them, I coated them with a little seafood breader. This gave em' a light crispy crust.

bake the fish first. i spread mayonnaise on the catfish,sprinkled old bay, and then baked them until they just started to pull apart. this way the meat was chunkier, not flaky. i sauteed the onions with 1/2 a jalapeno-seeds and all. mixed it all together. added 1 tbsp franks hot sauce. barely used 2 cups of ritz crackers. the mixture was a little wet, but it held together nicely and the cakes were not dry at all.  finally i coated them in panko bread crumbs -made them nice and crunchy on the outside.  next time i would add more old bay to the mixture.

Love it! So easy to make but very tasty. It turns out the best when you use the amount of vegetable oil mentioned but I have also used Pam to cut back on some of the calories in this dish and that works really well. You just have to be a bit more careful and move the cakes around often so they don't get stuck.

This is a great recipe, and not exclusive to catfish. I made mine with haddock, and added finely minced red pepper for color. These fry up nice and crisp without greasiness and made a hearty maine course.  I think a little more Old Bay wouldn't hurt.  Serve it up with a Zucchini Relish Tartar Sauce and this is a great meal!

PHENOMENAL! I used 1.75 lbs of catfish based on other reviews that it needed more, and 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1 cup Keebler Club crackers.  So good Hubby said I NEED to make them again and my 16-month old son ate it too.  Great recipe!

I know it's been said, but these are AMAZING! I don't even like fish, but loved these! I used bread crumbs rather than crackers.  I also forgot to add the egg, so the first three I fried disintergrated in the oil. Rather than remix my fish patties, I just dipped each in an egg/milk mixture then flour - superb!

Great base recipe. I added more seasonings, sour cream instead of mayo, less onions, and less cracker crumbs. Also baked in oven as suggested by others. Delish with sauteed jalapenos on top. I'd suggest to finely dice the onions, unless you like big chunks that sometimes too crunchy.

These were very good. I had catfish in the freezer that I thawed out and baked the night before which made everything easier the next day.  Everyone really liked them.  I served them with steamed rice and garlic aioli sauce.

I liked these, it was very easy to make and turned out quite good, somehow though I think for my taste something was missing.   I wanted to make the recipe as-is and see how it was but I think salt and garlic would have made it quite a bit better for me.   The whole time I was eating this I was thinking how good of an eggs benedict this would make.

I thought this recipe had a good flavor, but I will make a few minor changes the next time, and there will be one, I make this dish. First, I didn't know what Old Bay seasoning was before this recipe. I think next time I will definitely add more as I did not feel there was enough of its flavor. Actually, I was searching for another flavor while eating this that was not buttery cracker, but couldn't quite find it. The buttery crackers were good in this, however, they made it a bit rich. I think the quantity, in regards to texture, was pretty right on, but maybe use half of the called for amount of buttery crackers and substitute the other half with a non-buttery cracker. Overall, I think this is a great recipe. I will tweak it for my preferences, but please try this as written to find out for yourself. Thanks for sharing this one. It was my first time making catfish for myself, (I usually make my mom do it!), and it was a good experience.

After reading reviews, I decided to bake the fish at 450 for 10 minutes. Next time I would do 15 instead because the fish was very "wet" in spite of all the draining so it was difficult to get it to stick together. I also doubled the old bay, added a splash of lemon juice and worcestershire and added 1/2 cup of bread crumbs with two cups of crushed ritz crackers. My DH and I really enjoyed this recipe. We cooked it in 3/4 cup of oil on the stovetop and got 12 medium size cakes! Yummy

Great recipe! I really enjoyed this. After reading many reviews, the only change I made to the original recipe is I baked the fish instead of boiling it for 20-25 mins at 450 degrees. I topped the cakes with dots of cocktail sauce as shown in my photo! Thank you for sharing this with everyone!

I cooked the fish in 1/2 white wine & 1/2 water and I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers since I didn'nt have crackers ~ they came out well but not great...I'll try again with crackers to see if the flavor improves.

My mom makes a similar recipe using Salmon, so I thought I would try these.  I like them more than Salmon or Crab Cakes.  I broiled the fish first, and then made them into catfish cakes.  I didn't use as much oil either.  They were terrific!

Excellent. I usually make salmon cakes and my husband liked these even better. I used Duke's light mayo (heaping tbsp) and used only 1/4 c. oil. You could probably even use less oil than that. I went with the 1.5 sleeves of Ritz and that was perfect. I cooked my fish in the oven as mentioned in an earlier review with old bay and olive oil. I later also added about 1 tbsp of old bay to my batter. Everyone raved about them. Went great with Parmesean Edammame!

We live on a lake known for catfish...so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it.  This was YUMMY!!  I've made the meal a couple of times and the only change I've made is that I add celery sometimes.  It's easy to dress up with holandaise sauce...or my kids like it dipped in tarter sauce...or the ever famous ketchup.  It's a tastey way to get the fish servings in!!

Very good. I did add finely chopped red peppers which gave it some nice color  and a little extra crunch it needed. This recipe can easily be played with according to your own preferences. I served this with a Dill Mustard sauce that I made using mayo, dijon mustard, dill weed, lemon juice and a dash of salt and pepper. Will make again but I will try to use a little less breadcrumbs as the catfish is delicate and can blend too much into the mixture.

Mmmm.  Very good and very reminiscent of crab cakes. I loved the smell of the cakes as they were frying up.   I used a dijon mustard instead of plain yellow and also did a few splashes of tabasco for an extra kick.  I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning, but I did find Chesapeake Bay seafood seasoning.  As far as I can tell, its the same thing.  Keep in mind, the chesapeake seasoning has its own spicy kick, if you don't like spicy at all, you could probably just go with regular Seasoned Salt and get about the same flavor minus the spicines.

I've been looking for a way to use up all the catfish I bought I sale...and this was great.  I used less crackers, more Old Bay and more mustard and they came out fantastic. I used only 2tbsps of olive oil to crisp these cakes up and it worked fine.

These were excellent.  I used cajun seasoning instead of Old Bay, it pack more of a punch.  As good as any crab cakes I have ever had.  I served them with Remoulade.  Awesome.

Bobbie, Thanks! I have thrown away so much "left-over" fish in the past....Never Again! I used the recipe as you wrote it EXCEPT that I had some fried Florida Bream that was cooked a couple nights prior. I took the skin and bones off and used the flaky white meat. The flavor was excellent. This one is a keeper!!

I made these cakes were absolutely delicious almost as great a Maryland crab cakes. The only thing I did differently I change in the recipe was I used Ritz Crackers which I believe made the absolute difference in taste. I made this one evening in place of Crab cakes and fooled everyone at the dinner table, my wife wondered when I bought crabmeat. Everybody was shocked that catfish was used in the recipe instead of crabmeat.

I followed what was printed and all turned out well. My guests and I really enjoyed the flavor, however, I suggest the following modifications:
Comments from first usage:
1.	Add salt, it really needs some.
2.	Double or triple the amount of “Old Bay” seasoning.
3.	Low and slow frying until you get the right color.
4.	Pull together early and let it sit in the fridge to allow the cakes to firm up.

We tweeked the recipe because this was our 3rd try at cat cakes. I am from Maryland, so we were excited to try this.  First we sauteed 1/2 onion and bell pepper in olive oil, let it cool and set it aside. We used 2 eggs instead of 1, 3 tbl of regular mayo, 1/8 cup of old bay, 1/2 sleeve of crushed butter club type of cracker.  Mixed it all together and it was wonderful. When making something like this you have to eyeball the fish meat, mix ratio. We fried it in peanut oil. The cakes were wet before fried, but as I recall my mothers crab cakes are wet when she fries them too. They were just right!!!

Delicious recipe!  I'll be honest though, I did not have access to catfish and I used regular whitefish/tilapia as a substitute and it worked well too. Seriously, the spice combination is amazing

Yum! The only change I made was to use bacon flavored "buttery round" crackers, and it was great. The mixture was a little wet to work with though. I think next time a few more crackers.

Loved these!!! Only change I made from reading other reviews was after I made the patties I added breadcrumbs to the outside of the patties for the extra crunch. So good.

Made this with left over swai fillets and it was lovely. Added a bit of chili flakes and used Dijon mustard for our preference. Really good, simple recipe. Definitely one to make again.

These were great with a little tweaking! I steamed my catfish first to retain flavor.  They weren't quite as spicy as we prefer, so I added a little Cajun seasoning and red pepper!  I also fried them in half butter and half oil!  To me, they were better than crab cakes which can taste a little rich at times! This would also be a good stuffing for mushrooms!  This recipe will definitely be in my personal recipe book!

Great.  I used Hellmans,  Just enough to bind ingredients then mixed in egg.  Also, tripled amt of Old Bay.  Delicious!  Pan seared with just a small amt of oil.

This  is certainly easy enough to make.  I ended up using Tilapia because I had it on hand.  Given the mild nature of Tilapia I deliberately added more seasonings which was a very good choice.   I also added a bit more mayo and mustard.   This is a good basic recipe to have on hand.  For our tastes, we'd like quite a bit more flavor and will play around with seasonings even more.

I loved the recipe! When I boiled my fish down I added some fresh sliced lemon for flavor. I also added fresh minced celery, red and green pepper, red onion and garlic. I also added a teaspoon of pickled diced jalapeños for a little zing. It tasted awesome. I added a few spices (paprika, lemon pepper, and parsley) for taste but the recipe is awesome. Ritz crackers (two rows) did the trick though I may use a little less next time as not to overpower the fish.

Ok, let me just say that I never do reviews, but after slapping myself in the face for not making this recipe sooner, and devouring these Catfish Cakes, I had to do one.  This recipe is the best!  My aunt thought she was doing us a favor by purchasing  near 20 lbs of catfish for us to bring home from Memphis, and I needed a recipe.  I used lowfat Ritz crackers and I also baked the fish first with garlic and onion powder and oldbay seasoning.  I used spicy mustard and added some crushed red pepper to the mix.  I fried half with flour and half without, but could not tell the difference once they were cooked.  I will bake them next time.  My husband loved them as well.  The only thing I forgot was to make a sauce, but otherwise, they were percfect!

Ok so I decided to try these while my wife and I were on the Whole 30 diet.  That said there were several items that we were not able to eat in the ingredients list.  Here's the list of what I substituted (everything else being the same:

1/2 an organic onion 
1/2 of a red pepper
1 tsp of fresh homemade whole ground mustard
1 Tbsp of homemade olive oil mayo
1-2 Tbsp of old bay (my wife is from Baltimore, if you were too you'd understand!)
1 Cup of fresh homemade almond flour.
1 Cup of olive/coconut oil blend (most vegetable oil is soybean, which isn't allowed on Whole 30
2 Eggs

So I sauteed the onion and pepper with a little bit of olive oil before I added it to the fish, adding fresh ground Himalayan sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, then added it alongside all of the other ingredients.  I used the pepper to make it a "bit" more healthy, and 2 eggs because I didn't want to over-do it with the almond flour and I needed more binding action.

These cooked up wonderfully.  My wife, who I already mentioned is from Baltimore, said they were the best seafood cakes she had ever eaten!

Only gave it 4 stars because I had to modify it so heavily I don't know what they would taste like "normally".

Enjoy!

Tasty and easy!  Used left over Halibut.  Mashed it up, added the rest of the ingredients, added own spices (didn't have Old Bay Seasoning), used Premium Plus crackers and used just enough olive oil to grease the pan (3-4 tablespoons).  The whole family enjoyed this!

I do not like catfish, tastes too much like "the lake" but we catch a lot of catfish down here in Kentucky. Tried this yesterday , and it was fantastic!  I broiled the fish seasoned with old bay for 10 minutes and added more old bay plus some Tabasco to the mix then dusted with flour and pan fried. We're calling them Kentucky Krab Kakes, and I can guarantee that I'll be making them all summer. Thanks for sharing terrific recipe.

This was a big hit at a recent party. It is very similar to my salmon cake recipe that I always make, I just never thought of using catfish.
I substituted green onions and panko bread crumbs. I used a combination of mayo, dijon and added some sirrach sauce.  I also used fresh parsley. And I used two eggs.  I followed the suggestion of baking the catfish in the oven used old bay, cayene pepper, salt/pepper for the seasoning.  After forming the patties I always put them in the freezer for 20 mins. before frying,which will allow the patties to hold their shape. I also fried them in grapeseed oil.

Good, different way to eat catfish. Dense. No substitute for crab or crab cakes though. It's very clear this isn't crab!! Way too much onion - 1/3 or half it. Needed seasoning! By far not enough Old Bay! Spouse did not like, I thought they were fine.

Husband tickled pink with these. These didn't win me over YET, but, to me, they are a tad better than crab cakes (which I despise). With mods, I hope we all love these soon./Didn't have butter crackers: used saltines: Hubs loved these anyway. We rarely buy butter crackers, so saltines, or bread crumbs, or seasoned bread crumbs need to work most of the time. I agree that the breading/filling was too heavy; however, if I had used butter crackers (which I love), I might have felt differently. B) These were a bit bland: which has an easy fix./NEXT TIME PLANS: 1) make fish earlier in the week then use leftover fish for these cakes, 2) sub some sweet peppers for onion when available, 3) add 2 cloves garlic & good dash garlic powder, 4) double mustard, & use brown or powdered mustard, 5) use only 3/4 C of crumbs at first, then add more IF needed, 5) use tartar sauce instead of mayo IF wanting to emphasize dill & lemon flavor, 6) change up seasonings-try: splash of lemon juice, touch of lemon zest, dash of hot sauce, one T. parmesan 7) double Old Bay OR, sub dill & black pepper, or sage & lemon pepper, or cajun seasoning, or garam masala, or jalapeno, cilantro & corn. 8) Try 2 T oil @ 1st 9) mix in the a.m., 10) if dredging in flower, do so only lightly to avoid burning flour. 11) try malt vinegar, hot sauce, sauteed jalapenos, honey-mustard-onion relish, tartar sauce, lemon juice, ranch, chutney, white sc from allrecipes fish taco recipe, fruit salsa, chipotle in mayo, etc.

Absolutely delicious, I will definitely make these again. I did customise them a bit based on what I had in the cupboard - I used whiting fillets instead of catfish, I doubled the amount of salad dressing (I used tartare), and used fresh chopped dill instead of Old Bay seasoning. Also I used a lot less oil :) Very yummy.

I tried this recipe to make use of a lot of leftover fried catfish from a Boy Scout cookout.  I removed the excess breading and chopped the catfish in the food processor.  I added sauteed onion and red bell pepper.  I used a little more Old Bay seasoning and only 2 cups of crackers and 2 eggs.  They are fantastic!  Great base recipe to tweak to your taste!

Absolutly wonderful and very easy.  My husband does alot of fishing, therefore I end up with a lot of fish (especially catfish).  I seasoned and baked the fish in oven because I (like other reviewers can't imagine boiling fish)  Other than doubling the amount of old bay, I made the recipe as written.  It was great.  My husband told me to double the recipe next time and says they re-heat well the next day.

I was looking for a recipe to adapt using spoonbill (paddlefish) and this is the recipe I used.  The fish cakes turned out beautifully!  I sauteed the spoonbill for a few minutes in a skillet until done and then shredded it to use in the fish cakes.  My only complaint is that using an entire onion is overkill, IMO - they were VERY oniony - but with everything else they still were delicious.  Luckily everyone I made dinner for loves onions!  I'll definitely make these again (thanks to my F-I-L I have a freezer full of spoonbill).  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really good.  I kept calling them Crab Cakes because they tasted just like them.  I had trouble keeping them from falling apart but they still tasted great.  I didn't have Miracle Whip so I used Sour Cream instead and they tasted wonderful.

These are incredible! I used 4 lbs of catfish and primarily seasoned with Tony's rather than Old Bay. I also baked the catfish prior and used the juices from this in the batter. For the batter I used about 5 cups crackers and 2 cups Italian breadcrumbs. Total patties created: 25. Definitely a continual family favorite.

I was about to throw out my remaining frozen catfish nuggets because anything I make is either soggy or really fishy tasting.  So I thought I would give this recipe a try.  Hoorah!!!  My husband almost ate his plate and told me these were better than any crabcakes he's ever had.  I added some garlic and about 1/2 parmesan cheese to the recipe.  They fried up nicely and quickly and looked very appetizing.  Super idea and recipe.   Thanks!

I really wanted to love these but they weren't as good as we were anticipating. This was not a bad recipe but it had a little too much of a bread taste for us. I'll definitely keep this but tweak it to better suit our taste. It needs a little something but I haven't been able to put my finger on what that is yet.

Very good. I had never made crab cakes, so I thought it might be hard. NO! Easy!! And no shell to contend with. I followed someone else's suggestion and microcooked the fish, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. My son, who doesn't like fish, really liked these. I made a simple cocktail sauce with horseradish, ketchup, and lemon juice, but hardly needed it. We'll do this one again.

too many onions...will probably reduce even more next time (I typically reduce for any recipe). I had to cook the cakes longer so that there were no crunchy onions. But other than that...delicious! And I love maryland crab cakes and they do compare! Can't wait to make again.

The family loved this.  I was surprised, there is actually some semblance to crab cakes.  I doubled the Old Bay seasoning and added some salt & fresh garlic.

Great concept and tasty results. I would make this again, but I'd increase the seasoning and probably switch to tilapia, which I find has a larger flake.

I chose to bake the catfish in the oven first (like another reviewer suggested).  I then flaked the whole fillet and mixed with the other ingredients.  I used Emeril's Creole Essence in place of the Old Bay seasoning because I had it on hand.  Next time I will use a little more seasoning.  Absolutely LOVED this recipe - it will be added to our family's favorites!

These were excellent! I give them 10 stars! We love fish and I had some catfish but we were bored with the same old recipes so I was looking for something new. I had to modify because of food allergies, so instead of buttery crackers I used bread crumbs from homemade bread and homemade mayo and Badia Cajun Seasoning.

These cakes were so awesome...I've already made them twice! It's a nice simple way to eat fish. And it takes some of the fishiness that people don't like out of them.

Not a bad substitute for crab cakes - I used catfish nuggets and baked them in the oven. I also substituted bread crumbs for the crackers. You can use a lot less oil than 1 cup, especially with a non-stick pan.

This is a great way to prepare catfish. I didn't have any crackers in the house, so I used seasoned stuffing mix and they were excellent. I will add these to our menu.

Not the biggest fan of white fish, but trying to branch out.  This was great!  I would especially recommend this to parents trying to get their kids to eat fish (and not as fattening as fish sticks).  Made these one night with turkey cakes as well.. both were a hit... although the turkey did win.

I found this recipe awesome and would highly recommend it.  I used half catfish and half talapia as that is what I had handy.  The recipe also called for 2 1/2 cups of their kind of crumbs.  I used only 1 cup of standard bread crumbs and that seemed to work well.  I also used less oil and made it work that way.  I used stone ground mustard as well, and regular seasoning salt as opposed to the name brand.  Would recommend this for sure.

These were sooo delicious! I actually added a little lemon zest and Ritz crackers to the mix. I also boiled the fish in wine and water and some spices. To be more healthy and light I backed the cakes in the oven with a little sprinkle of olive oil. It was great! These cakes are my husband's new favorites! Thanks for the recipe and for all the reviews!

Like others, I baked the fish first. Also used lite mayo instead of Miracle Whip, and added a little lemon pepper. Turned out great - very flavorful. Thanks, Bobbie!

Great idea! I seasoned and baked 1 1/2 lbs. of catfish (instead of boiling) to enhance the flavor. The catfish was very moist/watery so drain it well. I modified the recipe a bit by adding: 1 cup of crushed Ritz crackers, 2 tbsp. of mayo, 1 tsp. mustard, 1 tsp. Old Bay, 1 tbsp. parsley, 1 egg, lemon/salt/pepper to taste. I coated the cakes with panko for extra crunch (I also think this helped hold the cakes together). I used just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan and they still came out crisp and delicious.  Next time I'll try a different fish with a more neutral flavor so they taste more like faux crab cakes.

Very easy & fast.  Kids loved them, I loved them. Inexpensive, yet they taste very expensive.  I didn't have Miracle Whip, so I used Ranch dressing and it worked great.  I served them with Bragg's Amino Acids sauce.  Yum! I will make these for my next potluck event - taste great at room temp.

My family is made of many picky eaters who absolutely hate fish, well my dad loved it my sister wasn't a fan but she doesn't eat anything unless it is made of candy i would add less bread crumbs but other than that it worked out great i will make this many more times .

Yum! My family likes fresh fish the day it is cooked, but they really don't eat any of the leftovers. I used leftover croaker (a mild white fish) and the cakes were all gone!

These cakes are the best!!! We go fishing alot and were trying to find another way to cook the fish we catch. The kids even beg for seconds... I do deep fry these for about 2 minutes each. I also dip in seasoned bread crumbs for added crispness... To help eliminate the dryness I just add more mayo!!!! This is definatly a keeper and will be making several times a month!!!!

These were really tasty.  My husband and I love crab cakes, but good crab is hard to find in the midwest.  I used corn flakes instead of crackers, and used only 1.25-1.5C.  Also used a little more mustard (dijon)/mayo/old bay.  Coated in corn flakes to fry- it was a quick and tasty dinner.  Thanks!

Love these, and is great for those who aren't too awfully fond of catfish to begin with.  Just needs a little more old bay, and it would recieve a 5 star.

We gave a 3 for now, but would go higher if added some hot pepper sauce & a little more Old Bay gives it some zip. I like that it wasn't soggy.

Very tasty!  I didn't have Old Bay seasoning, so improvised with seasonings I have on hand.  I really enjoyed these.

This was a good recipe.  I wish I had paid attention to some of the reviews though.  I thought it needed way more seasoning (I used maybe 3 teaspoons), but that could just be me.  Also, I didn't have a dipping sauce on the side, which I think could have made a big difference.  I will definitely make this again.

These were good but there was way too much filler.  It tasted more like bread mush.  With a little trial and error you could make these better.  Lessen the buttery crackers.

This was absolutely EXCELLENT! It tastes professionally made. I added a little bit of bell pepper, a little bit of black pepper, a little extra miracle whip and mustard. I also added an extra egg. I did not have the old bay seasoning - so I substituted creole seasoning instead and it turned out GREAT. YUM YUM. Have fun cooking.
