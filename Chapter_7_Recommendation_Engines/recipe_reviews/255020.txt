I made them for dinner and the result was delicious!  Thank you for giving us your recipe Chef John.  I made it with four potatoes for five people as a main entree .   The only issue I had was separating them, when it was time to add them to the boiling water.  They stick together even though each one is covered in flour.  So my addition would be to place them on individual trays , don't over lap them, it will be difficult to pull them apart.(especially if it is a large batch).

Not as firm as I like my gnocchi but good. I served it with a brown butter sage sauce

I served this with Chef John’s Rigatoni Al Segreto sauce. It worked so well. Seriously. Try it. This was also the only time I’ve ever successfully made gnocchi without it coming out like little rocks. I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I used butter potatoes, i also grated the potatoes instead of passing it through a strainer (I couldn’t do it). The grating worked just as well, thankfully.

I found it very difficult to shape the gnocchi but other than that it turned out great.  I will try with more flour the next time to get a firmer texture.

Made as directed - pushed through strainer and was very gentle. Wondered if I could use a ricer? Turned out pillow soft! Wished I had put a bit more salt in the gnocchi and in the water. Served with a very hardy home made sauce with lots of veg and ground chicken. Topped with fresh crispy sage, and a mix of fresh ground cheese. (Parmesan and Asiago) Getting a bite with sauce and gnocchi, cheese and sage was amazing! Next time will keep one leaf intact per plate, and gently sprinkle sage.

Made as close to the recipe as I could.  I doubled it.  I think I will just mash the potatoes the next time.  Very tasty and very filling.

These came out miles better than store bought gnocchi, and they are so much easier to make than homemade pasta. I served the gnocchi with vodka sauce, which I strongly suggest trying if you haven't. I doubled the recipe to ensure there was plenty to eat. Two notes: 1) If you are using large potatoes, increase the number of eggs to ensure that the mixture is moist and pliable 2) Once the pieces of gnocchi have been cut, make sure to coat them in flour to prevent them from sticking before cooking.

I kept the flour content to a minimum and the Gnocchi turned out wonderful.  Using a ricer is a part of the success I experienced. Thank You Chef John.

Loved it! Quick, easy and delicious.  The only change i will make is adding a bit more flour to firm the gnocchi up a bit.

Turned out very nice, I loved the use of the strainer to create texture with the potatoes. Lovely recipe ????
