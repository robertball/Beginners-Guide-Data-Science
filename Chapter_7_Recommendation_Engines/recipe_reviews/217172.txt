I make these every year with my kids. It's great for pretty much any holiday, including Christmas seeing as they make Peeps now for every holiday. It really dosen't matter what kind chocolate you use, we've even used Candy Melts and it turned out fantastic! If you'd rather not use sprinkles, colored sugar works just as well. You can also use wooden skewers for this recipe, too. Just use scissors to cut the tips off of the skewers before you use them. NOTE: These sell really fast at Fundraisers, too!

These are just too cute! I usually just dip the bottoms of the 'peeps chicks' and dip them into sprinkles, but this was a nice change. I did some with milk chocolate and some with white chocolate, put them into cellophane bags and tied them with pastel ribbon. These are gonna look great in the kids Easter baskets this year! This is one that I'll keep in mind from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

GREAT, EASY recipe!  Made these for Easter with my 2 yr old daughter.  She had a blast & it was really quick.  Just make sure you use wax paper.  I didn't have any so I used alum. foil & the bunnies wanted to stick. Will add to my list for other celebrations too.

OK, I don't know why this is, but Peeps look infinitely cuter on sticks! These are super easy and somehow more than the sum of their parts. Make a bouquet of them for a centerpiece, or wrap them in cellophane and give as party favors. I melted 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to get enough for dipping. You'll need to keep microwaving (or work fast) to keep the chocolate thin enough. As with cake balls, you're not so much dipping the bunnies in chocolate as spooning chocolate over the bunnies and then giving them a good tap-tap-tap on the side of the bowl to shake off the excess chocolate and help it smooth and settle.

These were totally fun to do. And I'm soo late in rating these from Easter. My kids loved them very much....Will suggestion and/or let others know when deciding to use colored melting chips. Be forewarned that the colored melting chips are thicker and you will have just a tad bit of a problem coating evenly and getting your bunny safely out of the chocolate. Just sayin' I think that was my only problem with the recipe when I deve-ated from using chocolate chips to colored melting chocolates. But otherwise, deck those bunnies out. And grab your kiddos, it was a blast.

YUM!  What I really like about this recipe is how fresh the marshmallows will stay being coated with chocolate.  Coating the bunnies with different flavors of chips will make for a nice variety.  This recipe is so simple yet it's goodness really took me by surprise.  So cute too!  It will be an added treat when I hold the Easter egg hunt this year.  Thank you Ciera for sharing!

Made these for Easter this year and it was a hit with both kids and adults. Five stars for the idea! I only dipped the backs of the bunny peeps so that their color and faces were still visible and I dipped only the bottoms of the chicks. I think the presentation is a little cuter this way.

Fun way to change up the taste of a Peep.  I used white confectioner's coating as I had a half pound leftover from making 'Jellybean Bark', another AR recipe.  I had just returned from the Peep Store in Washington, DC and had lots of Peeps to make something with.  These were cute added to my Easter tray of goodies.

I liked the chocolate bunnies . I had a very small crockpot for dipping things. I used it to melt my chocolate. This way it stayed melted through the process. Instead of trying to dip them into the chocolate. I painted the bunnies with a pastry brush. They came out a lot more even.

Took more effort than I thought but turned out super cute! I melted chocolate chips in small teacup (in microwave). At the beginning I dipped the peep directly in the melted chocolate but it was too thick and heavy. Subsequently, I followed a suggestion by another review and used a small jam spreader to "paint" on the melted chocolate.

My family loved these! It seemed the chocolate was very thick when I put it on the bunnies though. The great thing is that they are quick and easy to make!
