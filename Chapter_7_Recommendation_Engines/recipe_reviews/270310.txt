This is really good, and quick to make, assuming your meatballs are made ahead of time.  "20 meatballs" is kind of vague as it doesn't really indicate size - I ended up using 1 pound of ground turkey to make the meatballs. I do prefer smaller meatballs in my Italian Wedding Soup, so I ended up with about 50 meatballs. Not sure what size was intended?  I used the  "My Italian Turkey Meatballs" recipe from this site.  The only change I made was to use regular broth (as opposed to low sodium) and it tasted perfect. The cook times were spot on.  This makes 4 HUGE servings. You could easily get 6. Looking forward to leftovers!

This recipe is very good and so easy to make! I bet it's even faster if you have pre-made homemade meatballs. I used 1 LB ground turkey to make Italian meatballs (yielded about 30-35 meatballs). I thought I made them small enough for this soup, but next time, I would make them a little smaller (1/2" or 3/4").  I thought it might be lacking in salt by using no sodium broth, but I was wrong. The soup is full of flavor and so comforting on a cold day! I need to have Gluten Free and didn't have any GF Pastina, Acini di Pepe, or even Ditalini on hand, which I'll have to order online for the future. In a pinch, I used a small shell pasta, which worked out OK, but ya know...that's not the right pasta. :-)  I look forward to making this recipe many more times in the future with the correct pasta. I think I'll go make some meatballs to have on hand at all times just for this soup! Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely will make this again: I have a new, quick soup recipe! Couldn't find the pastini in my grocery store, so added Acini de Pepe instead.  Also used Italian meatballs that were on sale at the same store (which came in a one pound package with 12  meatballs): divided each meatball in quarters SO used 48 meatballs which was perfect! Great recipe.

This is fantastic! The whole family loved it and it was a lifesaver on a weeknight where I had nothing prepared. I have to admit that I used frozen Ikea chicken meatballs (I added them to the Instant Pot straight from the freezer) and didn't add herbs because I didn't have them, and even so - this soup was PERFECT! Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. Italian wedding is one of my favorite soups. I made my own healthy Italian meatballs by using 1 pound of ground turkey one teaspoon of Italian seasoning one tablespoon of fennel seeds. mix it together . Roll tiny little balls bake in the oven at 3:50 for 15 minutes. Add to soup at appropriate time.

This is my second time making this. I added more  broth today time and used smaller size pasta.   Instead of using meatballs I browned ground meat for chili, it comes out like mini meatballs.  It’s a great recipe, everyone loved it!!

This soup was wonderful. Only change I made was to substitute orzo for pastina pasta,  simply because that’s what I had available. Delicious and simple to make.

As is, a little bland. I will use it again as a base, adding extra seasonings. I also recommend tearing or chopping the spinach into smaller pieces. For the meatballs, I purchased small (about 1 1/2") italian style and cut them up into quarters. I did not need 20. Maybe it would be better with home made meatballs.

I needed a quick idea for dinner and this was it.  I had lots of odds and ends to use up that were on the ingredients list.  It was so good that hubby requested it a second time in less than a week.  I had left over Italian hot sausage to use up and threw in some garlic and tiny pasta alphabets.

Terrific! Even better the following day.
I made my own meatballs & then browned them before adding to the pot.
Did not find pastina pasta. Used DaVinci acini de Pepe. Perfect!

I made this- I was skeptical at first as my mom used to make this- cooking all day....  but it was delicious!  I did use beef for the meatballs ( as well as the family recipe for them), and added two chicken breasts, shredded.  Also added about a tsp of dried rosemary to bring in elements from my my moms all day cooking recipe. I did change out the spinach to escarole as that’s what we use. Still! OMG YUM!

Fantastic recipe! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this tonight with some nice, crusty bread. I halved the recipe, and used fresh herbs as opposed to dried. I made my own Italian meatballs (1/2 lb ground beef; 1 egg; Italian seasoning and seasoned bread crumbs - shaped into 1/2" balls and browned in a frying pan on the stove). I used acini de pepe in place of the pastina. Flavors were spot on. This one will be made again and again! Loved it!

Followed all directions exactly but used frozen Italian meatballs from superstore (PC Blue brand). A little big but who cares. I added them frozen and it turned out perfect.

I made my own meatballs and browned them first which gave additional flavor.  Also used ditalini pasta as couldn’t find the pastina and I reduced the pasta to 1/3 cup.

This was amazing! I doubled the broth just because I like extra broth. The meatballs with the hint of lemon is so such a great addition to the soup. All I had was orzo pasta and it did not disappoint! I’ll make this again and again.

Amazing! I didn't have dried parsley or basil, so I used fresh ones for both, and it came out absolutely delicious. For the the Italian meatballs, I just picked up pre-made, raw ones from the supermarket, and the flavor was perfect. Wouldn't mind eating this all week!

I made this with homemade Italian sausages and homemade chicken broth. This meal was so easy and so delicious and so quick... and you can’t go wrong when it only takes one pot too. this is definitely a keeper of a soup...Very hardy. Thanks for sharing!!!

My husband followed the directions pretty close and the results were outstanding! We all loved the soup! The only change was the he couldn’t find find “frozen Italian vegetables “ anywhere in our area so he picked a bag of frozen vegetables that he thought would work. They were really good! We have had this soup twice now and each time it tastes great . No changes needed.

Didn't make in the instant pot, made on the stove top. This is incredibly good, everyone who tried it loved it. Made it with "My turkey Italian meatballs", also on this site.

So easy & so very delicious!  I had to use 1/2 a can of greens as I had no fresh spinach. Used cooked chicken instead of meatballs. Will keep this one in my back pocket!

Used orecchiette for the pasta and banh mi meatballs.

The vietnamese flavors gave the soup a spicy eastern pow, and the little half clamshells made the dish even heartier.

Perfect marriage of east and west. Fusion at its best!
