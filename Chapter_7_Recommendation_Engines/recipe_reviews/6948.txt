OUTSTANDING!!! I've made these biscuits twice already, and here's a great tip for you: they turn out the same whether you use sour cream or plain yogurt! I ran out of sour cream, but wanted to make these so I used some plain yogurt. The only difference was that when I used the yogurt, I omitted the 2T of milk. Since yogurt is so "moist," I didn't need it. I also omitted the raisins both times because we never keep 'em around the house. I also doubled the sugar, cinnamon, and salt, and used butter instead of margarine. The icing is great to top these off with, so don't leave it out. I love this recipe. The biscuits are moist and soft, they keep well for atleast 3 days, and they reheat well. I usually cook mine at 390 for about 22 minutes or so on the VERY TOP rack. MMMMMM  MMMMM. This one's a keeper!!!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I make biscuits every Sunday AM for hubby and me and decided to try these (sans raisins) as a change.  Wow, big hit!  I did increase the sugar to 2T and cinnamon to 1t and added vanilla to the glaze.  If you really want to "gild the lilly", try melting about 3 T of butter and spreading it on the bottom of your baking sheet.  When placing the cut biscuits on the sheet, set them in the butter and then flip them so that both sides are coated in butter.  Use a pastry brush to spread any excess butter on the biscuits.  This is how I make my regular biscuits and really adds that extra touch.  I also sprinkled a little cin and sugar on top. Will definitely be making these again!

I made these with nonfat plain yogurt, 7tbsp lite butter and 1 tbsp regular butter to decrease the fat.  They were very good. I accidentally softened the lite butter too much therefore instead of rolled biscuits they became drop biscuits. But it was quicker that way and everyone loved them. I added a little cinnamon sugar to the powdered sugar for the icing too. Thanks, I'll make these again and again!!!

I made these biscuits yesterday to bring to work and everyone loved them! Some people had two or snuck another one to save for later!  I used golden raisins and butter as substitutes and even had to use a muffin tin because I didn't have a sheet pan available (I am a college student in a dorm, so I don't have access to a full kitchen unfortunately) and they were flaky and delicious.  I also upped the sugar to 3 tbs., the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and I didn't even bother with the glaze at the end. Delicious!!

These biscuits are delicious and light. I add some chocolate chips and I found the chocolate flavor goes really well with the cinnamon. They are really easy and quick to make. Thank you Jannifer!

We loved these! They're a new family favorite. To make them lower fat, use fat free sour cream, fat free milk, and only 1/4 stick reduced fat butter. Yes, they will not be the ultra flaky, really really yummy kind, as I'm sure they would be if you made them the way the recipe states, but if you're on a low-fat diet, then give it a try this way! They are amazing! (Oh, and one *little* thing I changed was to use white whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose. Works great.)

This is an incredibly awesome recipe. These biscuits are some of the best I've ever made or eaten, hands down. I was concerned that my family wouldn't like them, mostly because of the raisins, so I kneaded half of the raisins into half of the dough, and then kept the other dough and made plain cinnamon biscuits. It really wasn't necessary to do this, because the raisin ones were gone super fast! I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than that, and they came out super tender, golden brown, and delicious, with crispy edges and melt-in-your-mouth tender middles. The cinnamon flavor was pleasant, not overpowering, with the perfect sweetness. They were a huge hit...I'll definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!!!

I have made this recipe (or variations of it) for years now, and it is THE BEST! Hint: For biscuits to have with soup or dinner, I omit the cinnamon, raisins and icing, and decrease the sugar to 1-2 tsps. I always use non-fat sour cream (or yogurt in a pinch), and have had nothing but rave reviews on how light and fluffy they are!

Just the recipe I was looking for!!! WONDERFUL!!!! As suggested by some others, I doubled the sugar and cinnamon and used butter instead of margerine. I also sprinkled the biscuits with cinnamon sugar before baking. The secret to tender biscuits is to not overwork the dough, handling it as little as possible. I would suggest doubling the glaze recipe and adding vanilla. If you are a fan of Hardees Cinnamon Raisin Biscuits...you will love these!!!  HEAVEN!!!! Thanks for sharing.

I did not enjoy these biscuits. They were remarkably flavorless and neither moist nor fluffy in the least. I have had success with other biscuit recipes but would not make this one again.

My husband who doesn't like raisins thought they were "better than expected." We loved the heftiness of these biscuits and they had the perfect amount of sweetness. Wonderful recipe, thanks for the submission.

excellent! admittedly, i did make a number of changes, but none of them changed the essential proportions, which is the most important part of a biscuit recipe. i used butter (why anyone would every use margarine is beyond me), replaced 1/2 white flour with whole wheat, and because i was mysteriously out of raisins, i used craisins. i don't like frosted baked goods for breakfast, so i brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled the biscuits with cinnamon sugar before baking which gave them a nice crunch. i can't wait to make them again (maybe even with raisins!)

The best biscuits ever.  Would make amazing strawberry shortcake next summer.  These are tender with a crisp top and bottom.  The first pan seemed to brown on the bottom too fast but that might be my new heavy duty baking sheets. I have now made these many times and usually double the cinnamon.  I also bake at between 400 and 425 for 15-20 minutes (depending on thickness) so they are cooked through but not burned.  Like some other reviewers, I bake one sheet at a time on the top rack of the oven.  For shortcake or to serve for breakfast I brush the dough with butter or milk and sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking.

I just finished tasting one of these biscuits, warm from the oven. They are yummy! They have a light, moist texture which must be from the sour cream. I think the next time I will increase the cinnamon as it was a little too subtle. Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper!!!!

Wonderful! Sorry I messed with it a little. The only thing I did different was added a pinch of nutmeg and a cap full of vanilla. Yum! My husband is not a big biscuit eater [ I know he's nuts :) ] But he enjoyed these. I'll be making again. I got 10 fat biscuits out of the recipe. I made these again tonight. But instead of sweet I went more savory by adding garlic, parsley, and  grated chedder cheese. It was good, but I'll stick with the original recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  After reading the reviews, I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and I upped the sugar to 3T.  Also, I didn't have raisins so I used frozen blueberries. These came out so nicely that I think I will try it without the cinnamon, sugar and raisins when I want to make plain biscuits.

This recipe is awesome!  I doubled the cinnamon and sugar as well and omitted raisins per preference.  A fast easy sweet snack that isn't heavy.  And tastes so perfectly fluffy.

I made these the night before and cut them into biscuits and put them in the refrigerator on the baking sheet. I baked them in the morning at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. They turned out great!  Flaky and delicious.  I did double the sugar and cinnamon like the other reviewers suggested and used shortening because I didn't have margarine.  I served them with cinnamon honey butter and everyone loved them!

I printed this recipe years before finally trying it.  Wow! did I miss out on one delicious treat.  I kept to the recipe as written, with the exception of butter instead of margarine.  Yummy.  Maybe these biscuits ARE better with more cinnamon and sugar, like others suggested, but they're pretty darn good as written, too.  Great for breakfast, after-school snack, late night treat--anytime.  Thanks for sharing!

My 8yo really liked these. I didn't add the raisins to them. We loved the crunchy sugar/cinn. topping, really adding a nice touch!

This is a great recipe.  I changed it a little. Instead of 2 tablespoons of white sugar I used 3 and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. If you have a problem making these try it a couple of time. It is worth it.

These are sooo good!  Didn't put raisins cause I'm not a fan of them but followed recipe very closely and these were great. Five stars and I will be making them again. My son asked if I could make them for breakfast and I think I will do just that!

These are very good!  I think the addition of cinnamon chips would make them outstanding!!  I also substituted half shortening and half butter for the margarine.

Amazing!  I make a double batch every week since the end of March. 

I upped the sugar and cinnamon.  I also use my food processor to combine the dry ingredients and when adding the butter.  They turn out great every single time.  I even used them for my strawberry shortcake.

I cut this recipe in half and made these to go with my Quiche Lorraine this morning, just on a last minute whim. I used half whole wheat flour, I added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, I used butter and nonfat plain yogurt instead of margerine and sour cream and because I was out of raisins, I used dried blueberries. I patted this into a large circle, then cut it into pieces like scones. Mine were done at ten minutes, but my oven runs kind of hot. I did change up the drizzle just a bit, I added just a little butter to the confectioners sugar and used lemon juice instead of milk. The family thought these were great. My husband compared these to our local Fair scones, texture-wise, which is a huge compliment, I was pleased.

Got rave reviews at a recent brunch. I increased the sugar to 3 Tbsp and the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.  I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon to the icing.

These were freakin awesome!!! My husband and I loved them. I used splenda instead of sugar, light margarine, and light vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream and milk. I did not add the raisens as neither one of us care for them. I also doubled the amount of sugar(in my case splenda) and cinnamon. I absolutely loved them.

I just made this today; I barely had 1 C of sour cream in my container, didn't have margarine on hand, so I used butter -- forgot to purchase raisins, so I used dried cherries (chopped them up) and sliced almonds I found in my cupboard as well. Didn't alter anything else, and had to add 1 Tbsp of flour at the end when I kneaded it. Cut it w/a biscuit cutter, and popped them into the oven. Out came 15 rounds of Oh-My-Deliciousness! Drizzled on some icing at the end while still warm, and Daughter pronounced it "VERY GOOD" after one bite. Thank you so much for sharing -- this will be my go-to recipe for breakfast/snacking goodness. I'm off to eat another one after I send this. YUM YUM YUM!

I made these and was pretty disappointed that they didn't rise up , really flat biscuits . Taste was good and they were moist . Next time will add more baking powder because it really did seem like a small amount for biscuits . Oh it doesn't make 12 normal size biscuits , must be much smaller .

Holy cow, what a great biscuit!  I made these for a potluck at work and everyone loved them. The best part was that they stayed soft and yummy all day and didn't get hard or stale like other biscuits would. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  It's a real winner!

These are like cinnamon rolls....only way easier! My husband loved them and loaded it up with butter in the middle and icing on top! I used yogurt instead of sour cream and omitted milk, as per another reviewer. When they came out, I felt like they were bit more moist/doughy in the middle than I would like. I put them back in the oven for several minutes longer, but I don't think it helped much. Oh well - the Husband loved them as is. :)

These biscuits are an interesting change from the usual buttermilk biscuit. If you really enjoy biscuits, you have to try this one! The dough seemed very dense to compared to shortening/buttermilk biscuits, but the end result was fluffy and light. Followed the recipe to the T except I was 2 TBSP shy of 1 cup of sour cream, so I added a bit more milk (~2TBSP).

I made a double batch for a brunch potluck at work and they were the first to disappear.  I used half sour cream and half yogurt, and since I didn't have any plain yogurt, I used one pineapple and one peach yogurt since that's all I had.  They were still really good; I could barely taste the fruit, and no one else could tell.  Very moist, wonderful biscuits.  Oh and I also brushed melted butter all over them and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar before baking, plus the glaze and more cinnamon/sugar when they were done. :)

These biscuits were really great!  Moist, perfect with the frosting.  My husband and I just heat them up in the microwave for about 15 seconds and they are so yummy.  The only thing I did differently was I soaked my raisins in hot water for about 10 minutes before adding them to the batter.  Also, I prefer having more raisins so I think next time I'll do maybe 1 Cup of raisins.  Very good!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!!!!

As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the amount of cinnamon and sugar. Next time, I'll put in even more cinnamon, but then, I really love cinnamon. I also added half a teaspoon of vanilla to the glaze and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar. Oh, and I soaked the raisins in boiling water for a bit before mixing them in. I do really like the texture. These are quite tasty, once you up the cinnamon quotient. I also think I will double the glaze next time.

Oh, for the reviewer who added chocolate chips: your chocolate chip batch probably rose higher because of the extra kneading. Kneading incorporates air and toughens the gluten, enabling the dough to "fluff."

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was simple to make and the biscuits were very tasty.  I did add another Tblsp. of sugar and a tiny bit more cinnimon though.  The dough will be on the sticky side but by the time your finished kneading it's fine.

I would not make these again.  The texture is nice enough, a bit dense with so little liquid, but the taste was so bland that after I added more sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice, it's not even the original recipe anymore.

I have made this recipe twice. In the first time a made mixing by hand and the biscuits were very soft and delicious, second time I made with my electric mixer and the biscuits were hard and whitered. I think I over mixed it.

We love these biscuits! A favorite recipe. Light and fluffy, with a light cinnamon flavor. (I leave out the raisins because most of us don't like them.) I've been making them for years, and they always turn out perfect. They are great even without the icing! With the icing, I serve at the end of the meal, and my kids consider these dessert. I always double the batch so my four kids can have leftovers for breakfast the next day. (Sometimes they even save me one!) Still very good the next day, aside from the fact that the icing gets soft, which doesn't bother us at all.

Just about the easiest and best biscuit recipe I've tried in quite a while.  Made it exactly as written and they turned out great.  Had them with fried bacon, an egg and some cranberry sauce slathered on them.  I wouldn't change a thing.

A keeper! I doubled cinammon and sugar but they came out a little too sweet for me. The next time I ' ll put 2 sps. Double cinammon was great and I used yoghurt as no sour cream was available. Also, I used half butter half oil. Thanks for the recipe.

I was just looking for a recipe to use up my sour cream but am sure glad I found this one.  The biscuits are light and moist even though I used whole wheat flour.  I almost omitted the drizzle topping but glad I didn't.

Spectacular!  Loved by All.
I left out the cinnamon and threw in some varied grated cheese  I may have added a wee too much flour , so I moistened it a bit more with buttermilk.  These will be my new favourite go to for biscuits. There are so many variations that are available with this recipe.

12.13.15  Substituted Craisins® for the raisins and used buttermilk, since I had some in the fridge.  Also, added just a little bit of almond extract to the drizzle.   As suggested by another reviewer, I sprinkled the top of the biscuits with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before baking.   I rolled the biscuit dough a little too thin the first time, but rolled thicker on the second round using a smaller scallop-edge cutter, as well, and got a nice rise on them.  Very tender, flavorful biscuits with just the right amount of sweetness.

Made these with butter instead of margarine.  Be sure to use cold, unsalted butter, cut into pieces and then cut thoroughly into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter.  They came out as fluffy as baking powder biscuits should be and tasted good.  The glaze makes them pretty sweet so I left some unglazed, split them, and buttered the halves.
For a higher rise and some additional flavor use buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I absolutely love the taste of these biscuits. You get just a tiny hint of cinnamon every now and then. Just perfect. I wanted biscuits with butter so I didn't put the icing on them, just ate them plain. Heavenly.

Nice, soft dough. I added extra sugar & cinn. as advised.  Didn't like these. Even with all the sour cream they tasted dry. I was hoping for a taste more like Hardee's.  These were nothing like those. I would not make these again.

I went into this with high hopes, wanting to use up some sour cream I had in the fridge. I wish I had just saved it for perogies or something - these biscuits are flavourless and disappointing, despite my doubling the sugar and cinnamon.

These were pretty good.  I didn't have any raisins on hand, so I added chocolate chips to half of the dough.  I prefered the chocolate chip portion, but my husband thought that was too sweet, and he liked the plain.  You need to cut them very thick for them to rise, I made about 13 and the half with chocolate chips rose a lot more than the plain half - don't know why - I used the same bowl and everything just kneaded chocolate chips into the last half of the dough after I had cut the plain batch.

These were good, but not GREAT! I doubled the cinnamon and sugar like people suggested but it was still not very flavorful. Also I noticed someone put they tasted a bit bitter due to the baking soda and I could taste that also. I tried putting some vanilla extract in the powdered sugar glace for the top and that make it more flavorful. They were good though, but need a bit of tweeking I think to be GREAT!

I, too, doubled the sugar and cinnamon, mostly because I didn't have raisins at the time. They still turned out very good. Next time, I will be using raisins.

these were delicious! However, I doubled the sugar and the cinnamon and then they had good flavor. If I hadn't have done that they would have been tasteless. I also used real butter.

I doubled cinnamon but I think a little more sugar would have also helped the flavor. I did use the sugar drizzle which did help the sweetness. Dough was a little too sticky so I had to add 1-2 Tbsp flour to make it manageable; maybe that decreased the flavorings.
