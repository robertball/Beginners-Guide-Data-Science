I always add some vanilla.. I make my own gluten free crust from homemade cookies.... or pre made cookies from home free  or another brand. I always add an extra or 2 philly cheese due to the lemon juice factor and the vanilla :) 
 I always enjoy no bake because less ingredients and allergen contamination :)

Followed directions exactly. It wasnâ€™t rocket science. Refrigerated for 7 hrs. Cut into it and it was like soup

This was one of the first desserts ever put into my repertoire. Absolutely delicious and to make it even better I get the chocolate graham premade crust and top with oreo cookie crumbs and a caramel drizzle!! Yummmmmmm

This doesn't set up like a traditionally baked cheesecake but I didn't expect that it would. I love the flavour,  the ratio of lemon and dairy is bang on. So quick and  easy to prepare and something that I will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

Hi Bren, this recipe needs another block of cream cheese!  :D  This recipe is the same ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18376/cherry-cheese-pie-ii/ ... one block short.  :/  It is really good though - with two, not one!  :)  :D
