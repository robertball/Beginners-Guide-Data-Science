I made this recipe with fresh cherries instead of the canned ones and it turned out awesome! My boyfriend told me everytime I make a "crisp" now I have to use this recipe because he enjoyed the topping so much!

Delicious and very easy. I added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. My husband has been pestering me to make it again!

This was excellent, and Hubs and I both cleaned up the half recipe I made for our dessert tonight. But we both agreed it could have been just a little sweeter. The title, however, does specify that this is a TART cherry crisp. Even tho' a little extra sugar would have made this old-fashioned, comfort-food dessert even better, it didn't stop either of us from enjoying it to the last bite (with whipped cream). I had this in the oven in minutes, and we scarfed it up in minutes too.

I have made this twice now, once with tart cherries and today I used canned peaches.  The topping is delicious, this is a quick and yummy dessert.  Thanks.

This is very good.  I used fresh cherries and made 1 1/2 batches of the crisp since i usually need more and it was too much.  The recipe calls for just enough of the crisp. I CANNOT imagine what subbing tapioca for flour would be like since this is not a pie.  Tapioca would not yield a crisp.

I cut the recipe in 1/2 and baked in individual ramekins for my husband and me.  This was very easy to make and was just what we were looking for in a cherry crisp.  It was definitely on the tart side, so you may want to up the sugar if you don't care for tart.

I made this recipe with fresh plums instead of cherries.  And it came out awesome!
Thanks!

This is good but needs more sugar to balance out the tartness of the cherries.  I also subbed tapioca instead of the flour b/c that always seems to work better.  Will make again!

Wasn't very crisp, but had a delicious sweet and tart flavor.

This was delicious! I made this with thinly sliced apples as well as cherries.  My son is allergic to wheat, so I used brown rice flour instead of ap flour and it tasted great.
