I have been making this recipe for many years and it is always a hit!! I get asked for the recipe any time I bring it to a breakfast. Only thing I do different is 1/2 cup each of bell pepper, onion and celery and maybe a little more cheese because I love cheese!! Don't let the soup throw you off, it gives the flavor depth. YUMMY!

I fell in love with grits on a trip to the south some years ago, but this is the first time I've made them.  I thought this was very good and comforting!  The only thing I did different was to use beef summer sausage.

This was very easy, but I didn't like the flavor. I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe has been in my recipe box for quite some time, so I finally decided to give it a try last night.  It was pretty good and my husband seemed to like it.  My only reservation is that the soup just gets spread on top of the meat/grits mixture instead of mixing in, so that when I cut into it, there was a soupy layer oozing out above the grits.  Next time, I think I would just mix the soup with the grits before baking.  Also, I don't know if it's a mistake, but the directions say to let the grits simmer for about 30 minutes. Typically, grits are done after about 4-5 minutes.  I didn't want to risk burning them, so I removed them after 4 minutes, which is the only change I made to the recipe.  Overall, it's not a bad little recipe, but it didn't excite me too much.

This is a great breakfast casserole - especially for those of us who do eat eggs and want to share a hearty family-n-friends style breakfast.

Overall this recipe was good but not over-the-too awesome. I have only ever had grits as a side dish before so I didn't realize how much this would taste like breakfast. We might have enjoyed it more had I made this in the AM rather than as a dinner. Also, it was a bit too salty for my taste preference.
