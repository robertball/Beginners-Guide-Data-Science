This is wonderful.  I used ground cinnamon instead of sticks because I didn't have any on hand, and it still turned out great.

I love this recipe!  I always add a little more orange juice than water.  I add a little honey to make it a little more sweet than tart.  Additionally, I add a mixture of cornstarch and water to make it a bit more thick.  The flavor is so good and it just gets better as it sits in the fridge.

This was FABULOUS!! I added 1 cup extra of brown sugar (Dark Brown Sugar), and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, and then used 4 tablespoons of corstarch mixed with 5 tablespoons of water, (this is after I simmered the sauce for an hour) brought it up to a boil again and then simmered for another 15 minutes and chilled overnight. The consistancy was thicker and more jelly like, which is what my family is used to.  GREAT RECIPE!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Although it is a personal peeve of mine when people alter the recipe and then review it, I did only have one cinnamon stick and it seemed to be perfect for my tastes. I took the leftover sauce and brushed it on grilled chicken breasts the last 5 minutes of cook time. It made a crunchy, delicious glaze for chicken! We loved it at our house!

I cut this recipe to make 16 servings because I didn't have enough cranberries.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it went really well with ham and Cranberry Nut Bread I from this site.  It's good hot or cold and super easy to make!  It just needs an occasional stir while it simmers away.

Very good. I've made it two Thanksgivings in a row. I add chopped walnuts after it's done, and a little flour or cornstarch to thicken it while cooking. The walnuts really ascent it well. This year I made so much that I made a pie (apple-cranberry) to use up the leftovers, that came out great too. I'll post the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and received many many compliments.  I'm not a fan of cranberry sauce...but I loved this.  It is also easy to make!  If your looking for a good cranberry sauce you have to try this.  I mixed the leftover with mayo and used it on turkey sandwiches!  Yummy!

Yummmmy! I did as others did by adding some cornstarch to make it more like a jelly and didn't have cinn. sticks so I used cinnamon. Also added some 100% pure honey from a local farmer's market. Made it for 24 servings (12 oz bag of cranberries). Amazing and easy!

This sauce was a hit!! I served with turducken (layers of meat from turkey, duck and chicken), the kids loved the flavor.  The cranberry sauce complemented the chicken and turkey and of course the orange sauce was great with the duck.  This is a keeper!!

This has a lovely taste - I am not a fan of traditional cranberries.  I do what I always do when I want a thicker sauce: when the cranberries are soft enough, I take a spoon and smush some of them against the side of the pan, then stir and continue cooking.

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a HUGE hit - I had tasted a similar Cranberry Orange sauce years ago at a Chicken restaurant in Miami and I had been dying to find a recipe like it - well this was Soooooo GOOD - even better than what I had from the restaurant - and even family members that usually dont like cranberry sauce were LOVING this Sauce because they all said the Orange really made it taste Amazing - this recipe has been a KEEPER for me ever since - and not only does it go Excellent with Turkey - its perfect on baked Chicken

This recipe was awesome! Everybody ate it up last year. I used light brown sugar and toward the end I wanted to sweeten it a bit more so I added about 1/2 cup more sugar.

Having never liked cranberries, this was fantastic.  At the end of the simmering process, I added another 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 tblspns of honey.  So yummy.  Easy recipe.  So good, all three of my kids even ate it.

Everyone loved this.  I didn't have the lemon zest, so left it out.  It needed more brown sugar than listed and i just kept adding until it wasn't so bitter and used ground cinnamon since I didn't have the cinnamon sticks. Will definately use this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (my first cooking everything myself) and NO ONE ate any!!! It seems I forgot to ask if my guests like cranberry sauce in the first place. To get rid of it I made cranberry butter (blend 3/4 c. softened butter and 1 c. sauce) for my husband to put on his biscuits and added some to Jiffy Oatmeal mix to make pancakes. Now my husband requests I make this sauce all the time just so he can have the butter and pancakes. He says the sauce is fabulous by itself too, he was just too full to eat any on Thanksgiving day.

I've been making this recipe for years as part of Thanksgiving fixed menu.  It's so easy I don't understand why anyone would buy canned cranberries.   I usually omit the water and just cook the berries in OJ.

I followed this recipe exactly- and WOW!  I will NEVER ever serve canned cranberry sauce again!  I simmered this down to a thick sauce consistency and everyone loved it! The orange was a perfect compliment to the cranberries, although I will leave out the zest next time.  We have enough leftovers to freeze or have as jam! Thank you!

This cranberry recipe has a fantastic flavor. The use of brown sugar and cinnamon really makes it a standout. I simmered it for about 2-3 hours, and it was perfect!

i did this recipe once before but didnt rate/review it. i love this recipe - it is a good introduction for a non-cranberry sauce lover.

update: i decided to make this again for thanksgiving 2008. this time i used the zest of 1 orange and the juice of 1 orange instead of oj. i also put 3/4 c. white and 3/4 c. brown sugar. i added only 2/3 c. water and i think it this helped in the making the consistency a little thicker. absolutely delicious!

This delicious sauce has become our family tradition at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The first two times I made it I reduced it by half thinking it would be too much sauce. Since then I've always made the full recipe. By the second day it's entirely gone and someone is asking me to make more. I'm not sure what it is, the cinnamon, the o.j. but it's really wonderful. Thanks Barbara for sharing this gem!

Good for a change of pace, but still is cranberry sauce at its base.

Worked out really well. As other have said, I added some sugar in the end to counteract the bitterness. In all, I used 1c packed brown sugar, 1.5 c white cane sugar. I zested the orange right into the pot to get all that good essence in there too. I guesstimated ~ 1 tbl.  Another reviewer said she smashed the berries little and I did that too. The consistency turned out perfect.

I made this for the first tim and love it. I made a couple changes however. 
Instead of the 3 cinnamon sticks, I added 1 teaspoon quality organic cinnamon, and instead of a pint of orange juice, I squeezed 2 oranges and boiled them in 2 cups water, 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup raw honey. I did not add the brown sugar. Of course I added some orange zest for looks too.

I wanted to like this so much I made it for the first time for Turkey Day.  I love cinnamon, orange, cranberries, and Jamaican food.  I hoped it would taste spicy and comforting, but I think the orange zest made it too bitter.  I will not make this again.

This was delicious! I found that the orange zest wasn't necessary. I also used ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks. I ended up using more cinnamon than the recipe called for - this helped to cut the tartness. I recommend making it at least a day in advance as the flavor intensifies as it chills.

This is excellent Cranberry sauce. It's not too sweet; not too tart. It set up perfectly. I used the cinnamin sticks as a garnish.

Truley wonderful.  My husband and I have never even had fresh cranberry sauce- only canned.  So, i followed the recipe exactly. It was so much fun to make, and really added a lot of color and taste to our Thanksgiving meal.  We'll never go back to canned again.

I am not even the biggest fan of cranberries, but this stuff is outrageously good.  Next time I think I'll cut back on the liquid a little bit though, as i cooked it for almost 2 hours and it still wasn't quite as thick as I wanted.  But the flavor was excellent!!  I also recommend using cinnamon sticks instead of ground, because the powder adds a hint of grainy texture.  Now if only there were a way to get rid of those cranberry seeds.

This is the best!  I halved the recipe as it makes a lot.  I also only use enough water to cover the cranberries.  I zest an entire orange as well rather than just 1 Tbsp.  Tastes even better the 2nd day, if there's any left!

I thought this was absolutely fantastic!  The perfect balance of tart and sweet.  Both the orange and cinnamon flavors are subtle, yet they change this from just plain cranberry sauce into something special.

I would reduce the amount of water next time to only 1 cup. I had to cook it way too long to get the right consistency. I had to add corn starch to thicken. 1 Tsp of ground cinnamon was enough since I didn’t have the sticks.

Making it now but in reference to the instructions to “add enough water to just cover the berries”...cranberries float.  That’s how they are harvested. The farmers flood the fields. Soooo,  one might be adding too much water if trying to cover them. Just say in’. It smells so good.

This is fantastic exactly how written. I get so many compliments and it’s so easy. I simmer it for hours so it gets really thick, but if you’re in a rush you could add cornstarch.

I love cranberry sauce, and this recipe is amazing! I followed the recipe, using about 1 1/2 cups of water to cover the cranberries. After simmering for an hour, the sauce was too runny for my taste, so I kept simmering the sauce for about 2 1/2 hours total. In retrospect, I would reduce the water by 1 cup.This cranberry sauce is unique and a bit sweeter (due to the brown sugar) than a traditional back-of-the-bag cranberry sauce recipe. I like my cranberry sauce tart, but I did not find it too sweet. I would imagine the added sweetness would go over well with most palates. I will definitely make again (and tweak with the amount of liquid added).

This cranberry sauce is absolutely delicious!
A couple notes about the recipe though. First, I found that I needed to add quite a bit more sugar than indicated to counterbalance how tart the sauce was when I followed the recipe. I didn't measure the additional sugar, I only doctored to taste, so I can't make recommendations on how much to add, sorry. Also, to get the sauce as thick as I wanted it to be, I had to simmer it far longer than an hour. I think all said and done, I probably simmered it for close to three hours. Totally worth it though, because it is amazing!

I'm always in charge of the cranberry sauce and wanted to try something different. I have tried many recipes with orange juice and this one turned out the best! I simmer it for a few hours to make it nice and thick and I also add walnuts or cashews. Big hit! Have already made it for Thanksgiving.

I made it just as directed. After cooking, I blended it a little bit (because I know my thanksgiving audience would rather have that). It converted die hard cranberry sauce haters. We were looking for other things to put it on. It's DELICIOUS.

It made enough for 2 thanksgiving feasts, though- so halve it if you're doing a small gathering.

Easy and delicious. I let it cook down quite a bit and as I was heartily stirring it I noticed the cinnamon sticks were breaking apart. I had to carefully search for and remove woody cinnamon stick fragments. I'll use ground cinnamon next time. Everybody took some home after Thanksgiving dinner.

This was a huge hit, even with my husband who doesn't like cranberry sauce.  I will be making it every Thanksgiving. It was taking a while to thicken as it was cooking, but after I turned off the burner and allowed it to cool, it thickened nicely.

Couldn't find my original recipe, this one is close. I like the orange & you can always add more brown sugar.  I also added a dash of ground cloves, allspice, nutmeg & ginger.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone.  Think I might try adding jalapeno & cilantro for added spice to the leftovers.

I would give it a 5 but I found that with the 2 cups of brown sugar in ends up too sweet. I make this with 1 cup of brown sugar.

used recipe as-is but scaled down (only 3 for dinner) and found it far too tart. added white sugar (based upon the original recipe i think it would be about 1/2 cup) and it was fine. next time i make it i'd only add the zest in the last 15 min or so of cooking (or would substitute an orange twist as you would for a cocktail).

hello out there ..my mom used to make an orange cranberry sauce but I don't have her recipe. It really helps when the cranberries are so tart ! 
How much cinnamon should I add if I use ground rather than the sticks. 

Thanksgiving at home 2012. Our first time cooking this.

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  At the end I did find it to be too loose, so I drained some of the juice out.  I did not care for the flavor.  Easy to make, but very tangy and not nearly as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce.  I'll be looking for a new recipe to spice up the standard.

THIS IS THE BEST..HANDS DOWN..i have made this for 4 years..i can't believe it comes out so great each and every time..and it is so very easy..you just cant compare the fresh taste of orange, spices and berries to canned sauce..make this, and you will be so glad you did..it is more like a jam than a sauce..so good with turkey and great to use the leftovers on buns,biscuits..

I simmered at least an hour, it came out perfectly thick. Very good.

I've used this recipe two years running now and don't see an end to it. I love the resulting sauce. It's tart, sweet, tangy, beautiful, etc., etc. Day after sandwiches with crusty rolls, cream cheese, this sauce and, of course, turkey were simply delightful and made me want to roast another turkey so I can have more sandwiches all week! Thank you for one of my favorite holiday recipes!

The flavor was very good if a little tart for my taste.  And I didn't really care for the texture of the orange zest in the sauce.

My third homemade sauce in row...I don't think homemade cranberry sauce can ever turn out bad, lol. I overdosed on orange zest and our sauce was a little tart but that's the way we like it. On top of sweet potatoes, slathered on rolls, in turkey sandwhiches...always good. I added in some grated ginger, a few cloves, and raisins would be great too.

This recipe was delicious. After cooking it as the instructions suggested it, it was yummy. But I thought it would be perked up by adding a splash of Maple Syrup. I also juiced the orange I bought to zezt and thus came up with half a cup of orange juice. I added Simply Orange juice to top it off and let the kids watch as the cranberries popped and foamed. They loved it. It was a great, simple, but also traditional recipe that helped them feel like they contributed to our meal in a major way. Can't wait to eat it tomorrow with all the holiday fixings!

This turned out great.  My Granmother and Aunt said they do not like cranberry sauce.  I made this and they loved it! They asked me to make it for every holiday get together.  The only thing is I must have added too much water because it just would not thicken, I ended up having to add a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken it.  It still turned out great though!

Added red wine vice water, would use about half of each next time.  Overall, a bit too sweet.

This sauce I thought it would turn out great. It was a little tart for my liking, but made a beautiful presentation and smelled absolutely wonderful when it was cooking. I even added a little more sugar, I am one of those that likes the can stuff.

Wonderful!  I'm not one for cranberry sauce, but this was the best addition to turkey that I've ever had.  And you can make it ahead of time which is really important.  Thanks!

WOW!  I am a craberry sauce hit.  My entire family and friends loved this recipe and it was soooo easy.  I'll never buy the canned stuff again.
My mom uses this as an ice cream topping and my husband loves it on sandwiches.  If you are looking a Cranberry Sauce that will hace people talking - LOOK no further.

This is a great recipe which when I accidentally added too much water created a great Cranberry Ice.  After simmering for about an hour I drained off excess liquid and froze it....YUM!

This sauce was great, we will be keeping this recipe around to use again, thanks for sharing it.  My 16-yo son made it for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it.  We made half the reicpe and used 2 cinnamon sticks.

These cranberries turned out great.  I cooked for closer to 1 hour 20 minutes and had to add more brown sugar than called for.

This is amazing!!! I made this about 2 years ago, and now my family insists I make it every holiday!! It is easy to make and adds aroma throughout the entire house. And it sure beats the canned cranberry sauces!!! You can't go wrong with this sauce.
