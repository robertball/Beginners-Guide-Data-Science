My husband and I had this dish for our New Year's Day dinner. It was easy to make with conventional ingredients that needed no advance preparation. We came home from an afternoon party and fixed this in time for our evening meal. We both liked it, and I will fix it again. I did not tweak it; it is good just as it is.
