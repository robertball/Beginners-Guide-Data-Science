I really liked this recipe.  My two year old wouldn't eat it and my husband didn't even try it.  You really do have to be a fan of green chiles though for it to be a hit.  I won't make again because no one else ate it, but I would like to try it with cream of chicken soup.

My version of this does not call for the soup.  But I tried it and liked it.  Wonderful potluck dish.  I added more cheese for on top, and mixed in a little onion and garlic powder for extra flavor.

I made it a little differently, doubled the recipe and used 3 c cooked rice. I cooked rice until water was absorbed - leaving rice slightly undercooked. Mixed rice with 1 can cr. celery, 1 can cr. chicken (it's what I had on hand), 16 oz sour cream, 7 oz can green chilis, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp garlic salt.  The whole family ate it up, even my 17 month old! Thanks for sharing!

As described it would be quite bland.  However, I added salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic, and more cheese. I also used parboiled long grain rice instead of the instant.  The result is a tasty change from Spanish rice.

This was a quick and delicious recipe that my husband and I really enjoyed.  I followed the reciped exactly and it came out great.  We live in the southwest and this will definitely be a crowd pleaser at an upcoming pot-luck.  Thanks for the recipe, Michele.

My husband and I really enjoy this dish. I have made it for guests and they  raved about it. I am tripling the recipe and taking it to a potluck tonight. I use fresh roasted chilies and the flavor is intense, just the way we like it.

I didn't like this at all-and it smelled "weird" (which is the best way I can describe it). No one really dug this sidedish except for a friend who had stopped by to visit couldn't resist a small bowl. She said it was good w/ a little S&P (thus the 3-star rating) but other than that, I received no praise for this one and I couldn't eat more than a bite. Sorry!

I just tried this for supper tonight, along with pork chops.   And, my other half loved it (so did I).   I guess we are both fans of chilies.   And, I think you have to be because of the flavor.   It's not too hot because the sour cream cuts down on the heat.   We loved it.

I really wanted to like this recipe more than I did. It was so easy to make that it would have been a nice go-to meal. Unfortunately, it was very bland. I tried a few different spices and cumin seemed to help give it what it needed but it still fell short on flavor. If I made this agian I would definitely add a second can of green chile peppers, cumin and a secret ingredient that would make all the flavors pop.

This is wonderful... I made a few changes: used white rice and cooked it first and cream of mushroom and it turned out prefect.  I served it with lime chicken ~Yum~ This is a quick side dish that the whole family loves!

I made this for my 3 teenage boys.  They really liked it.  I thought it was ok, but a little bland.  Might be better with some added garlic & other seasonings.  Will make again for the kiddos.

This was ok. I think next time I'll try cream of mushroom soup, the celery taste overpowered everything else. I used brown rice, 98% fat free soup, and fat free sour cream to make this healthier.

I have made this at least 5 times since the first time I tried this.  I do add more cheese and even some cream cheese and use cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  It's wonderful!!  (modifications is why I only rated this 4 stars)

This is a good  basic recipe that I like to tweak a little.  I never use instant rice, because it lacks flavor and firm texture.    I like to use a parboiled or converted type of rice.   Jasmine would work too.    I cook it first, and then add all of the other ingredients.   A can of cheddar cheese soup works well in this recipe too along with the extra cheese.  I use a larger sized can of green chilies as well.  I used a bunch of minced up poblano peppers I grew in my garden this past summer as well. I had to add some sautéed onion and garlic in butter as well.  Adding half the amount of sour cream will work too.  
 Add some water to the recipe so it has a creamer consistency instead of it getting too congealed or sticky.

I used cream of mushroom soup and doubled the recipe. It was delicious although the sour cream was almost a bit too much. I might try cutting that back next time however I suspect the rice needs that extra moisture.

I thought this recipe was really good for a comforting side dish.  I will add some onions next time, but as the recipe is I would make again as well too.

This recipe was very easy and tasty! I added extra rice but stirred in some milk and extra sour cream to make up the liquid. Otherwise, kept the recipe the same. Yum!

I was looking for a rice side dish with ingredients I had on hand sooo I substituted 2 things: I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of celery and a half cup of diced jalapeños for green chilies. My husband loved it and I’ll definitely make it again. I did have to add about a half cup of water and cook 5 extra minutes to get the rice done enough but I’m using a convection/microwave combo and that’s not unusual.

Very good.  I wanted more of a main course than a side dish, so added cooked chicken, onion, spices, extra cheese.  Would be good with some French's onions on top.

I really liked this recipe.  Thanks Michelle.  I always try recipes on this website AS IS FIRST.  While the "as is" recipe is great, being from New Mexico, I love green chile.  The second time I prepared this dish, I added 3 diced, fully cooked chicken breasts, seasoned the soup with a minced garlic clove and added fresh cracked pepper, and 1/3 cup minced shallot.  The result, YUUUUMY.  SUBSTITUTE CREAM OF CELERY WITH CREAM OF MUSHROOM!!!

I agree with another reviewer who said this was a bit bland. It was good, but definitely lacked something. I may make this again and try a few additions. This doesn't make my definitely a keeper list though.

My family and I absolutely loved this dish! It was so quick and simple. The sour cream and chiles really give this a great flavor. This is definitely one we'll enjoy for the future.
