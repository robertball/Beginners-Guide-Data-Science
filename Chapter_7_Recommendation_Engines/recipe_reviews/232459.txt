Thank you for this excellent recipe! I brought these to a party in a mason jar placed in a bucket of ice, leaving the ice out of the recipe as it would be sitting out for rather a while. I put out a card that people should shake the jar before pouring because the ingredients do separate, and this worked out just fine. I also added some sugar (maybe 1/4-1/3 cup) because I prefer a sweeter margarita.  People loved it, as did I.

For my taste and party members, it was a bit strong.  I added more ice and agave syrup.  It was a hit!

No changes made.  Was very good.  The wife really liked it but I thought it was on the rich side and couldn't finish all of it.  That's okay though, the wife helped me in that department

This was so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only addition I made was to toss in some fresh sliced strawberries after blending.  We made this for Cinco de Mayo and they were fabulous!  My new favorite drink by far!  Not too sweet, just right.  A must try - you won't be sorry!

fabulous!  l love it AS-IS.  Interesting (and annoying) that the only non-5-star rating is from one who altered the recipe greatly.  Very misleading and "inappropriate" to alter  ingredients and then rate the recipe, especially a less than stellar rating for a stellar recipe, but I digress. :)  MAKE THESE; you will love them!

Really great recipe!  I didn't have orange liqueur so I used orange juice.  Also had some fresh pineapple so I added some juice and a couple pineapple chunks to the blender.  Rimmed the glasses with s combination of sugar and salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious blend of both sweet, creamy coconut and tart, savory margarita flavors!  I had it as-is and it was delightful, but also blended some strawberries into the second half of the blender batch and it was even MORE amazing.  Why didn't I think of this before?

Galveston Island last weekend...perfect! If you like coconut (or pina coladas) and margaritas, this is it.
