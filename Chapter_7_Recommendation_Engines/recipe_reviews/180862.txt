I made this twice. It was no betterthe second time when I added more garlic, red chili flakes, and basil pesto. For all that is in it it seems to lack a lot of flavor; there is too much spinach and beans. All we got was chicken and spinach. Very disappointing after two tries, I will not make this again.

Never had cassoulet before, but really liked it.  Very hearty & very EASY.  Could be a one dish meal. This recipe would be good with or without meat.  Next time, I'm going to try it with sausage.

This was the first time I'd made a cassoulet of any kind. I used cannalini beans. It tasted great, but lacks visual appeal. It was very gray looking, and needs something for color. Otherwise, very tasty.

I made this as comfort food on a cold Sat night.  We loved it.  I had to use dried tarragon as I couldn't find fresh in the middle of winter.  Otherwise, I made no adjustments.  This is a keeper.

I made this today, using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast.  I also used navy beans that I cooked from scratch the day before.  (I seasoned the beans with salt and 2 bay leaves while cooking them.)  The recipe was super easy to get on the stove, and made a very tasty, one-pot dinner.  The artichoke hearts add a touch of acidity that really sets off the other flavors in the mix.

I love the Mediterranean angle. Here's a few things I added to give this recipe more depth. A cup of diced tomato - a green tomato would be great. 2 slices of bacon chopped into 1/4 pieces. Small yellow onion fine diced. 5 total cloves of smashed garlic - not 3. Skip the tarragon, add a sprig of extra Rosemary AND a small hand of parsley plus 5 sprigs worth of thyme  - all chopped fine. Use calamata olives for God's sake. Use the suggested amount of chicken stock but add equal portion of lamb stock if you can - reduce by half under a slow simmer. Red pepper flakes, salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. Assemble as directed in original recipe. For extra magic - add a splash of red wine vin., a table spoon of balsamic and squeeze half a lemon in. All this acid helps brake down and blend the favors in addition to adding a brightness that makes everything POP!

This was pretty good. I added mushrooms. I think there was too many olives and next time I would halve the amount. I will also try with less artichoke hearts because they were a little overpowering.

This is a great 1 pan meal that cooks up fast during the week and is tasty.  I made some changes - I used only 2 cans of beans, no spinach, substituted half as many kalamata olives instead of black olives better flavor, and threw in a tablespoon of capers and half cup pearl couscous to help thicken it up.  Still, it's the same basic idea and my husband and sons were happy.  Next time I think I'll double the garlic and rosemary.
