Really really good after they have cooled compleatly. I thought they were a disaster though when I sampled them after they came out of the oven. Then I tasted them the next day just before I was about to throw them out, and they were awsome!

Nothing special, just tasted like a puffy cookie with a hint of some candy bar.
