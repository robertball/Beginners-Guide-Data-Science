I found this very recipe in an old fashioned cookbook I picked up at a garage sale.  My friends and family insist that I make them every Christmas - they don't last long!  The dough needs to be worked into balls quickly, as it gets crumbly.  I found that if you just stick it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time until it's warm again, it comes back together so you can finish.  A delicious crowd pleaser!  Fun to get the kids involved with this one.

Very easy to make.  A tad bit too sweet for me, but others that had them said they were really good.  Really good right out of the oven, as the hug is still soft & gooey!

Great Cookie!  I felt it was an easy cookie to make.  It makes so many with one batch and being that they do not spread you can put alot on one baking sheet.  Perfect for cookie exchanges.  I would scoop the dough with a mellon baller and push the candy inside and it worked great.  I have been making these for years and they have become my signature cookie.

I made these bon bons for the dessert table at my son's after-rehearsal dinner, and they were definitely a hit. There were more comments about this dish than any other dessert on the table, and the other ones were pretty darn good! I lost my recipe, and I'm so glad to have found it again. Thanks!

This is a really good cookie, almost a cross between a candy and a cookie.  I added a 1/2 cup of nuts to the cookie dough.  The whole family really loves this one and wants me to make another batch for Christmas.

I used margarine for the butter and for the shortening in the icing. The cookie part came out very good but kind of greasy, but that might have been due to the margarine? Anyway, the greasiness of the dough was good in that the cookies didn't stick to the pan, and I just transferred them to paper towels to absorb some of the excess oil while cooling. In the end they were slightly greasy but not enough to bother anyone - in fact I got several compliments on them! Also, we don't have Herseys kisses here, so I had to use a different type of chocolate that is slightly bigger. I was still able to make 30 out of the dough and mine came out big enough for cupcake liners - I used greaseproof ones. They still only needed 8 minutes in the oven. Lastly, my icing came out too thick to drip over the tops, so I needed a piping bag.  I had to stop baking halfway through - with one batch out of the oven and the other half still dough in the pan. I put the dough in the fridge and when I returned it had turned solid, but by heating it slowly on the stovetop I was able to get it back to the right consistency and finish.

My family loved these! The consistency is like a fudgey, soft cookie and they are very easy to make. I was a little concerned they may be too sweet so I swapped the semi-sweet chocolate chips with dark chocolate chips and they turned out great.  I also took the advice of another user and used a cookie scoop - inserting the kiss in the middle. Thank you for the recipe!
