Very good but definately use 1/2 cup sugar or else it tastes like a cake.  For a lighter version you could also drop down to 3/4 cup of cheese, it still tastes super.  Would be a really nice addition to a brunch and also tastes good cold!

I have tried a recipe exactly like this one, only instead of Saltines I used Ritz crackers. Definitely makes a difference.

Very easy BUT VERY SWEET.  Less than 1/2 the sugar would be enough.  No wonder a kid will eat it.  It was practically a dessert, not a side dish in my opinion at all.

I made this to go with our Easter ham. It got about a 50-50 favorable to unfavorable response at the table. I liked it and thought it made a good side dish especially since my ham wasn't glazed with anything sweet. The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon of flour to the sugar (I was worried it would come out watery) and I used crushed Club crackers for topping since I had some stale ones in the cupboard. I cut each of the pineapple chunks in half becuase it seemed as though there wasn't much to go around, I think the size called "tidbits" instead of "chunks" would have been the best way to go. I liked the sweet/savory combination of the pineapple and the cheese/cracker topping. I do think I could have cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup it was plenty sweet.

This was good served with ham and the people at the dinner table who had a sweet tooth really liked it.
I think crushed pineapple for the entire dish might have worked out better. I wasn't crazy about the big chunks. 
I halved the sugar and the sweetness was just right. Any more sugar would have been cloying.
I substituted Ritz crackers for the saltines and they were good in this dish.

This is one of my all-time favorites, dating back to my childhood. My mother  always made it with cheese crackers (Better Cheddars) instead of the Ritz crackers for an extra cheesey crunch.

The first recipe I made exactly as instructed, but the flour/sugar sprinkled on top was not satisfactory, did not mix in; made another recipe but mixed the flour/sugar into the pineapple  before I poured into baking dish & it turned out great.  I did decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup, & it was plenty sweet.

I made this for our annual Christmas Eve dinner this year and I have to say I was a little worried. My parents are pretty picky eaters and trying to get them to try something new is like pulling baby teeth, but they both tried it and absolutely loved it. In fact, she wanted me to bring some to her Christmas party. I agree with some of the other users about the sugar. I only used about 1/2 cup and it was perfect. I also used ritz crackers instead of normal saltines. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!

This was so good! Subbed ritz crackers for saltines. This is definitely more like a dessert than a side dish. I believe that 3/4 cup sugar is more than enough. Thanks :)

Surprisingly delicious!  The pineapple/cheese combo works!  The cheese/crackers just formed a crust though; I wish it was mixed in with the pineapple.  Next time I will try to do that. I used crushed for the full amount of pineapple.  I also cut back the sugar to just over 1/2 cup and used Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I prefer it served warm.

Great recipe!! My family raves about this recipe!!  The only thing I changed was that I mixed the flour, 3 tbsp juice, sugar, cheese and pineapple together all at once, and put into pan.  Then mixed my butter and Ritz crackers and put on top.  WAY yummy!!!!

I thought this recipe sounded odd so I wanted to try it. The combo of cheese and pineapple works in a way that I think only peaches and cottage cheese can work... I used thinly sliced cheddar that i ripped up into chunks since thats what I had but I think that shredded would def. work much better. I also don't think I cooked mine long enough... Probably could have standed another 5 to 10. But it was ok.

I used 1/2 cup sugar and that was too much. I also should have mixed the flour and sugar in with the pineapple rather than just pouring it over the top. I believe that would have solved the problem of too much juice in the bottom of the casserole. I also think there was too much cheese on top. I omitted the saltines and butter as a personal preference. I like pineapple casserole but prefer a different recipe from this one.

This was good- a nice combo of flavors. Surprising. I was unsure at first, but the whole family agreed this went well with our Easter ham- and when my sister scraped the drippings of this dish off of her plate, I knew it deserved 5 stars!

I had read about this recipe reading the reviews for a differt recipe and it sounded strange to me. But I love to try different and strange sounding recipes so I made this. This was GREAT! My soon to be daughter in law was helping me make dinner and she said mom I am not sure about cheese with pineapple. She loved it. This is a keeper and I can't wait to make it for one of our large family gatherings. Thanks Wendy for another great recipe

Definitely a conversation piece at dinner. Interesting combination...cheese and pineapple. Suprisingly good.  I've only used the Ritz crackers which are a nice substitute. Great with ham!

I cut back on the sugar, using under half a cup. I also mixed the pineapple, flour, sugar, some of the crackers and most of the cheese together before placing it into the baking pan. I then mixed cracker crumbs and cheese for topping and drizzled melted butter before baking.

Easy to make but even 1/2 cup sugar was too sweet. I even used pineapples in its own unsweetened Juice. Next time I would use 1/4 C , use more melted butter or lesss cracker crumbs.

The crackers were not blended into the butter or cheese. I didn't like tasting saltines with pineapple. I'd prefer less crackers and more butter.

I will make this again for family gatherings and pot luck dinners. Super easy and really good! Everyone seemed to like it that tried it. I used ritz crackers instead of saltines.

People always make a face when I tell them what is in this dish, but those who try just LOVE it. I don't add any sugar and use 100% juice pineapple and it's sweet enough.

It is one of my favorite desserts, but I use 1/2 cup of sugar, I add chopped peacans and use buttery crackers. I also stir in flour instead of sprinkling it on top. It comes out amazing!

My mom was the first to start making this recipe and she used ritz crackers. I've modified it further by using all crushed pineapple and use the pineapple juice to soften the ritz crackers along with the butter. The cracker mixture has a consistency of thick mashed potatoes when I spread them over the pineapple mixture.

I actually got this from my friends Nana in South Carolina! I use less sugar also, but the pineapple tidbits work the best. Always make this with pork!

I tried this recipe out on my family for Christmas dinner. Not everyone loved it, but those that did, want me to make it again. I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe next time.

:( My family wasn't a fan; something about the combination between the cheese and pineapple and crackers.... It was a very pretty dish prepared though!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was very simple and fast to make. Like others said, it was very sweet but accompanied the ham nicely.

This casserole was AWESOME!  The only change I made, was by using Ritz crackers instead of Saltines (I think it gave it even more of a buttery and salty taste).  Could definately be used as a side to pork (or whatever) OR as a dessert.  Think I'm going to try it out as a dessert and serve it over vanilla ice cream!

Very good! My mom used to make this when I was a kid, and I was so excited when I found this recipe for it.  Tasted just the way I remember it.  Goes very well with ham.
