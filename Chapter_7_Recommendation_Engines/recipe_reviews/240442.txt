These are a lovely little truffle, which taste kind of like an almond joy, but with walnuts instead of the almonds. Couple of notes about the recipe: I made a half batch and got close to 60 truffles (using my 1" cookie scoop), so the 36 truffles for a full batch has to be incorrect. It didn't say what kind of chocolate chips to use (milk chocolate, semi-sweet, dark, etc), so I used a 12 oz. package of semi-sweet. It wasn't quite enough to coat all 60 of my truffles, so I quickly melted two cubes (from a 24 oz. package / 12 cubes per package) of chocolate bark. Also want to mention that I used my electric mixer to beat the butter, powdered sugar and condensed milk - but then switched to a wooden spoon when stiring in the coconut and walnuts. It was REALLY thick, and hard to mix (I actually broke the little wooden spoon that I was using), so I added a splash of milk and switched to a heavier wooden spoon to mix the rest. To decorate, I melted a cube of white chocolate in the microwave and put it in a Wilton disposable decorator bag fitted with a #3 tip. Just a litle drizzle over the truffles really makes them pretty.

I made these today and while the flavour is good the prep time and ready in time are way off. I really should have gone with my instinct about the number of truffles that this recipe makes as well. I rolled and rolled the one inch balls and was so frustrated, I ended up with 120 before I gave up and put the last quarter of the dough in the freezer for future use. Would I make these again? Yes, but perhaps cut the recipe down to one quarter. The only change that I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks, I'm sure that the family will love them.

While these came out very good... I did have to make several changes.  First off, this recipe yielded 100 1" balls for me.  This in itself changed the amount of time this took to over 3 hours!  I cut the sugar in half and used only ONE 16oz box of confectioners sugar.  The recipe was vague regarding the ingredients but I used SALTED butter and UNSWEETENED coconut and DARK CHOCOLATE chips.  I used a mini fondue fork to dip the balls into the chocolate and then used a thick flat toothpick to smooth out the chocolate after dipping the ball but before setting onto the waxed paper.

They were a hit with my kids, but WAY too sweet for me to even finish one of them... I am going to try them again and add some salt to the mix to tone it down and maybe use regular condensed milk instead of sweetened condensed milk.
