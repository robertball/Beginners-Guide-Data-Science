I used camembert instead of brie & I did spread some manjo jam on the tortilla before loading w/ pears & cheese. All of the mango jam ran off while cooking though so it might be more suitable as a dip. There is no way this is a 4 serving recipe. My two young grandsons (9 & 5) & I shared it as a snack & we were all wanting more. ;o) Thanks for a yummy recipe nurkdenflurn...I can't wait to have it again!

I made this over the weekend without nutmeg (my BF did not have it at his house)and it was still delicious.  We really enjoyed it and it was good cold the next day as well.  Next time, I am going to try it with nutmeg.  Very easy and fast to make!  Thanks for the recipe. I would not have thought to put those ingredients together.

I followed the recipe exactly and was not thrilled with the outcome.  Something's missing and it's an odd pairing that doesn't work well.  I've made brie and apricot preserves grilled sandwiches before so I love the idea of warm fruit and cheese.  Maybe it's the tortilla that throws it al off.

I made this because I had a bunch of pears that were going bad.  I love it!  Simple, delicious.  In fact I have made it at least 5 times.  It's great for breakfast.  I even used peaches once instead of pears.  Worked just fine with either fruit.

Good idea but it wasn't very flavorful and the pears were juicy and mushy.  I like pomegranate and brie quesadillas.

Unbelievably delicious! The combination of brie and pears makes this appetizer stand out.

The Brie overwhelmed the Pear. When the quesadilla cooled the Pear was mushy.

These were pretty good. However, once they started to cool, the pear went a little mushy which was not very nice.

I think pear is too delicate of a flavor for quesadillas.  I've had mango and brie together in a quesadilla before and it was fantasitc.
