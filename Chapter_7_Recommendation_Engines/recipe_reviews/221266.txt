I made this tonight as a mothers day dinner and followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was cook shrimp with the scallops and instead of eating on bread I served it in my seafood alfredo. The scallops came out SO tender and flavorful! I was actually quite shocked at how good these came out given the fact that I have NEVER made scallops before. Such an easy recipe, all you need to do is follow the cooking instructions exactly. Even the shrimp came out amazing! My family loved this and my boyfriend said these were awesome! He already went and put more scallops on the shopping list for next time!

Wonderful, easy and absolutely perfect.  I have made this twice first as an appetizer served on the toasted bread.  Then I made it to serve over pasta as noted at the bottom of the recipe.  For the appetizer 1 1/2 of bay scallops is a lot for 4 servings but as a main dish it was perfect.  Make sure you have everything prepped and ready as this cooks really fast and make sure your pan is smoking hot to quickly sear the scallops.   The only thing I did differently is to use garlic olive oil on the bread and I toasted the bread in a cast iron skillet.  For the pasta dish I added some Parmesan cheese to the top of each serving.   Enjoy!

Its so ridiculous when people say I made this recipe exactly as written except I used blah blah blah... then you didn't make the recipe exactly as written now did you??!!! I don't think people should be able to give a review until they have made it true to the recipe, then make it again and come back toe with the revisions. Thank you. PS. This one was great. Next time I will do my revisions to make it even better! :)

Incredible! and EASY! Quick to prepare and tastes like you went all out. I used the tip of adding the heavy cream at the end, just until thickened and served over angel hair pasta. Finish with a sprinkle of romano cheese.

This is a winner. Comes together quickly so it's a great choice when entertaining. I served it on a bed of rice since the sauce is a abit thin but sooo flavorful. This time I removed the scallops to prevent overcooking and thickened the sauce with just a little corn starch and water. Returned the scallops to pan  for a quick warm up. A little Old Bay sprinkled on top when serving added an extra layer of flavor. This recipe is all about simple and delicious.

This was fantastic.  Prepared exactly as stated, the scallops are delicious.  In order to prevent super soggy bread, use a dense bread, and make sure it is well toasted.  I highly recommend this recipe, either as an appetizer, or a meal.

I added 1 cup of heavy cream to create a pasta sauce, as was suggested in the note by the chef, and I served it over zucchini noodles. 

The sauce was thin and runny, but ridiculously tasty. I would recommend making the sauce separately from the scallops so that it has time to reduce and thicken, and you are able to get more of a sear on your scallops.

Also, if you're considering using zucchini noodles, I recommend against long, thick strips (like fettucine) and opt for thinner slicing (like angel hair). Thick zucchini noodles fight against the small scallops and don't soak up enough sauce.

Very good with pasta for dinner. Things I changed are, using 2/3 cup wine and reducing the wine for 10 min before using. I also just used the sauce with out the cream over the pasta it was lighter and very yummy. I cut up the Italian bread for dunking and served with a salad.

Only the second time I have cooked bay scallops-1st time, my husband ate them I think out of sympathy.This recipe and watching the video made perfect sense and was so spot on.I used garlic powder and no wine(didn't have any)but we did have a 2 yr.old jar of everclear /w/a cinnamon stick in it a niece gave us.I used a shot of that with the lemon juice,put the cold butter in as directed.I make perfect skillet toast-poured it over and with the sides,we ate like royalty.Thank you

This was really good.  Just enough for two or three people.  Really quick to make.  I put it on fettucini type noodles.

I bought fresh/frozen bay scallops, .89 lb.  I took them out of the freezer for about 15 minutes before throwing them in the hot oil, so they weren't completely thawed.  I used 2T olive oil and I never let my oil reach its smoke point because I think it makes it bitter and is probably unhealthy.  I left my scallops unturned for a little longer than recommended because they were frozen.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly (but I did use 1/4 cup butter instead of 4T, because I read the recipe wrong and it still came out great. you can't make scallops too buttery, right?! I used Naked Cow Dairy Honey Butter because it is incredible and made locally on Oahu where I live.  I supplemented this to a faux-fredo sauce made from cauliflower and spooned over whole wheat fettuccine.  it was yummy.  It added some depth to my kind of bland faux-fredo, which will receive more herbs and nutritional yeast next time.  Over all this was super easy and quick to make even with frozen bay scallops and they came out wonderfully! next time I might try adding clams, mushrooms and asparagus -I think that would meld nicely.

Yum!!  We put it over pasta, and it was sooooo good!  I do recommend a little bit of cornstarch just to thicken it up a bit if you're making this a pasta dish.  Other than that, it's fantabulous!

I made it as written, except for leaving out the wine.   This was excellent!   I think it even made enough sauce by itself that next time I will toss with a little pasta, I don't think the pasta will even need any cream for this to make a delicious sauce.   Sooooooo easy and quick!  Great for nights you don't really want to cook but want a great meal!

I had never made scallops before, and chose this recipe because it looked good. I followed the recipe as written except that I used 1 tbsp. dried parsley because I didn't have fresh, and left out the cayenne because none of us like "hot" foods. I served the scallops as a main dish without the bread, and spooned some of the butter sauce over them. They were very tender and everyone loved them. 

Suggestions I have for anyone trying this recipe are 1) have all of the ingredients measured and ready to go before you start. Each step gets done very quickly. 2) Arrange all of the scallops to the outside of the pan so that they are evenly seared. This also leaves the center of the pan to mix other ingredients. 

The leftover butter sauce was saved to use over veggies for another meal. It was really good and tasty. It was really runny, but perfect to add flavor to veggies.

At this point in time, I have made this recipe a few times, and cut the wine to 1/4 cup because I don't care for the strong wine taste. Tonight I used this recipe to make halibut cheeks. It was every bit as good as using it for scallops.

Flat.  Not nearly enough garlic.  Made it with the 1 cup cream.  Never thickened up.  Used pasta.  Other than that....it was good.  I also suggest less lemon juice.  I think parmasan cheese should be added for flavor in addition to more garlic.

My date/boyfriend requested seafood for dinner.  I'm a grill/BBQ steak kinda girl, NOT a seafood person, other than the occasional grilled shrimp.  I remembered liking scallops as a kid and found this recipe.  I followed exactly and WOW!  This was amazing, tasty, rich, and a total hit.  I agree with another reviewer that as an appetizer 1.5 lbs is a little too much, but that says nothing about the flavor and total perfection this recipe is!  Thanks.

This is a very good recipe and I will definitely make this again.  I rated it 4 stars because I couldn't rate 4.5 and did make some changes from other reviewers suggestions and to adjust to our taste.  As other reviewers recommended, you must have all your ingredients (and pasta or rice, if using instead of toast) ready to go because this comes together very quickly.  I adjusted the lemon juice down to 1T and that was still a bit strong for us.  Next time, I will only use 2t for our taste.  I also thickened the sauce with 1-1/2 t of cornstarch added to some of the reserved wine I saved out for this purpose.  Served the scallops and garlic sauce (did not add cream) over spaghetti and it was wonderful!  Thank you, Chef John for another hit!!!

Wow - this was absolutely amazing.  Made over pasta but now I really want to try it with the crusty bread. Also added a little extra wine and added a bit of cajun seasoning just to kick it up a bit. But so easy, and incredibly good!

I know some folks like to change things right away but I like to try the recipe as is the first time. this one was very tasty.  the only thing I did different was...my scallops were still just a bit frozen so I increased the cook time in all steps. I also saw recommendations to use half and half to make a sauce for pasta. I did save what "broth" was left to do that. I will freeze it and use it later. I would make this again!

Fast, easy and amazing! Following a reviewer's suggestion, I used dense, well-toasted bread, and it soaked up the sauce perfectly. This recipe is wonderful for company--beautiful presentation, quick preparation, and incredible taste!

I made this to serve over a grilled strip loin and I wasn't disappointed. I cut the recipe back to two portions and didn't make the toast portion as it wasn't needed.  I did sub Earth Balance®  for the butter due to dietary restrictions but made no other changes. This cooks up very quickly so have everything prepped prior to starting. A smoking hot skillet is a must to get a good sear on those little gems. Great recipe and video. Thanks again, Chef John.

I made the recipe as written.  Overall it was an ok dish.  The flavor of the sauce tasted good, but the sauce was a loose sauce so it did not really coat the scallops.  The scallops themselves didn't really have much of a flavor at all.

Fantastic! Done as written and my first time to cook scallops. It's hard to find recipes for bay scallops - and since I impulse purchased a 2 lb. bag of frozen ones I have been on the hunt for a good recipe. I was excited to try this one. It is delish!

I've made these a couple of times now as written, minus the cayenne, and they are seriously fantastic. The sauce is a little on the loose side, but is amazingly flavorful. The cooking technique and timings are spot on. I butter my bread and add garlic powder before toasting, and use a thick sliced baguette or Cuban loaf. One point cannot be stressed enough....and that is to have everything prepped and within arms reach, because this is a super-fast cook. Chalk up another win for Chef John....incredible!
