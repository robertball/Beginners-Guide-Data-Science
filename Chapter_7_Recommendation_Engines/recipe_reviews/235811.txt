My husband just took a look at this creation as I was getting ready to photograph it and he said it brought back many memories of his Croatian grandma's work! It is a good thing that I'm about to leave the house too because otherwise I'd sit and eat the whole thing! Well not really because it is very big as you can tell from the amount of the ingredients. This is one of those recipes that looks better each time you make it because it does take practice. I had a difficult time rolling it out to 30x20 but that's my fault because the only thing I did different from the recipe was to use butter rather than Crisco in the dough. I hope the submitter of this gem will post her photo because it is so MUCH better than this one. But I'll keep trying! This is delicious! Now I don't know if I want to give away part of it as planned! Thanks StephaniCCP!

My father is from Rijeka croatia and he raved about this delicious bread. He did correct me when i called it povititsa because his mother called it (Croatian Orahnjaca). I am not sure who is correct but this is a blast to make. i wanted it be perfect so I googled how to roll the dough and roll it out with an old tablecloth. I don't have a link but there are many videos showing the traditional way to make this. I was impressed with the one loaf I made but watching the professionals they make 18 or more loaves at a time to give as gifts during the holidays. Wow. I do recommend that you chop / grind the walnut mixture until it is is very very fine and that the mixture is spread evenly over the entire dough. Sretno (good luck I think).

Wonderful recipe! And looks so beautiful once you cut into it. Will probably replace the lemon extract next time with extra vanilla (the lemon was overpowering for my taste). Really fun to make. Husband loved it.

Used pecans instead of walnuts. Really loved that it was not overly sweet and had a slight hint of lemon. Took Marianne s advice and made two rolls also covered so it would not over brown. Delicious will definitely make again. The dough came out really nice and I rolled with out the towel. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious recipe that makes for a great day spent on a holiday weekend with your family. I've made this with a different filling as well: thin slices of apples with cinnamon and butter. Give it a try just make sure that cut the apples thin and small enough to not rip the dough when its rolled

This was very good... Esp dough. Only change I'd make is lemon zest instead of extract. The extract was fake/overwhelming.
