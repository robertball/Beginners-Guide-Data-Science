I couldnâ€™t find any honey powder, so had to leave that out and I completely forgot to drizzle honey on at the end, so was great even without that.  Next time, I may try spraying the chicken with a little bit of olive oil on top to make sure all of the coating gets moisture.  One of my pieces was still had a white powder look even after flipping and cooking that side down.  Perhaps because there was very little fat left on the thighs by the butcher.
