Overall a great and tasty recipe. However since I'm pregnant and also have small children I was a bit leary about the eggs since they never get cooked so after I got the chocolate and egg mixture blended I heated it to bubbling for a minute or two so the eggs would not be raw. I waited for it too cool off before adding the marshmallows and peanuts and then stuck it in the fridge. It took way more than 2 hours for it to cool (I had to leave them in the fridge overnight) but that could be because I cooked it a bit more. Once they finally hardened they were wonderful and I gave them out as Christmas gifts.:) I will try this recipe again but maybe just omit the eggs next time since they don't seem to serve any real purpose that I can see anyway.

This recipe was perfect for baking with my Kinder class. It was easy to make with small groups and they loved the end result.

Well this was easy enough to make and looked sooo pretty. Unfortunately after 5 hours in the fridge they had set up but the chocolate was still really gummy so I threw them in the freezer. Even frozen the chocolate was still really sticky. I would love to try this again with maybe 1 egg instead of 2. Perhaps my eggs were to large and thats why I didn't set up. I didn't feel comfortable taking them like they were to share with others.

When you do it just precicely right it comes out perfect! I have made it many times but sometimes it won't set I think I just needed to add a little more sugar though. And it really needs like 24 hours in the fridge to set. Great recipe otherwise.
