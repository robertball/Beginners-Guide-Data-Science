I used Brown Sugar & Bourbon seasoning. Other than that, I cooked it exactly the same as the recipe. It was perfect, moist and delicious.

I will never broil salmon in the oven again. This method of cooking salmon is so much better. It is faster, uses less electricity, doesn’t heat up the kitchen , and most important, results in a moist salmon with a crisp topping.

I’m not much for salmon... but my hubby is. So I tried this. Wow! This was perfect! I actually ate all of mine ( instead of feeding to my dogs, like normal) 
Hubby was impressed!

This was delicious!  I’m new to the air fryer and followed this recipe exactly. Not disappointed at all. The salmon was moist and perfect.  Thank you!

Very good! Super fast and tasty! I let the fish sit in the seasoning and sugar for about thirty minutes before air frying. Cooking time was right on for my oven. Will definitely do this again!
