Hi to anyone considering this recipe. I just wanted to let you all know this recipe is for CONDENSED cream of chicken. It will be just as thick as the canned stuff. Also, if you use pan drippings from a roast chicken it tastes worlds better!!

Guess I get to be the first party pooper for this recipe.  This is one of the worst things I've ever made on here.  It should be made clear that it's *condensed* soup - people also just plain eat cream of chicken soup.  One shouldn't have to discover this from reading a review.  But, I just switched gears & dug up a super easy recipe using the condensed soup, so that wasn't a huge deal.  But then it got worse.   First, I don't see how one can "whisk" the flour & milk - it's VERY thick and did nothing but get stuck in my whisk, which was difficult to get out of there.  The "milk mixture" (more like "flour glob mixture") should NOT be whisked into the hot milk.  You put liquid into globby stuff, not the other way around.  So I put a little of the hot milk into the flour glob, adding more, until it was a consistency that I could put that in the pan.  And no way to avoid lumps.  And that's considering I can make almost anything with ZERO lumps, but this was more like big clumps.  And after this big mess and hassle, it doesn't taste a thing like condensed cream of chicken soup, which has a fairly strong flavor.  It had NO chicken flavor, and tasted like peppered flour, more like something I'd dredge chicken in.  Speaking of flour - WOW!!  Lot of flour!  The recipes I used it for were boring - tried adding some chicken bouillon but didn't help much.  Still tasted like peppered flour.  It would be less hassle and take less time making the trip for the real thing!

Ran out of cream of mushroom soup for another recipe so converted this recipe. Left out the lemon pepper, paprika and replaced the chicken broth with beef broth, and added mushrooms for a quick cream of mushroom soup.  Without your recipe I would not have known where to begin, short of going back to the grocery store.  I am sure I will be giving the chicken a try too.

@erimess - the directions clearly state that you are to make a slurry with the flour and remainder of COLD milk. I think you didn't follow the recipe correctly, and because of that your review is extremely unfair and inaccurate. 
I followed the directions except I halved he recipe (only needed one can of soup) - it turned out great and I was very pleased with the results. Thank you for providing this excellent base and substitute for the canned stuff!!

Okay, don't get mad folks (or submitter) but this is backwards on technique. A flour/butter roux should be made first and then slowly adding liquids. Yes, with recipe amount of flour it will be a condensed type of soup. So, the 3 stars is due to odd cooking instructions. Now, this is just a "FYI" - but I decided to create my own version of this soup (which is located in my "recipe box"). I thought I'd share and made it public so if anyone cares to, they can check it out. I'm not sure if I plan to submit it with Allrecipes just yet so that's the only reason I mention it. The seasonings and most ingredients in this recipe is what inspired me - so thanks for that BabyDollPie!

I followed this (except for the spices because I was out) and it turned out really well. Perfect in my recipe for Chicken Vol au Vent. It did thicken up really quickly and I had to add more milk to get it to the right consistency. Great base but it is definitely a condensed soup.

This is a really tasty recipe for condensed cream of chicken soup.  We have to cook gluten free in our home, so a simple switch of flour and we have a gluten free soup base for many of my casserole recipies.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this gluten free w/Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour and added some garlic salt to it to bring up the flavor.  It doesn't need the lemon pepper seasoning.  It can easily be made into cream of mushroom by adding ~1 cup finely diced mushrooms when you add in the stock.

Common sense told me this is for condensed soup...but common sense isn't so common these days. Why give a bad rating for HOMEMADE soup when your fail proof plan was to use the canned soup anyway? I'm glad I found this recipe as the canned soup contains wheat and I cannot have gluten.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it turned out perfect. To those of you that had problems with adding the milk/flour mixture to the hot liquid, this is called a slurry. Made of flour or cornstarch and mixed with some kind of cold liquid. It is a method that is in many of the recipes that my grandmother handed down. I mixed the slurry in a glass measuring cup with a pouring spout, so that I could stream it into the hot broth mixture slowly. Make sure you are whisking properly and don't walk away from it. I get less lumps using this method than using a rue. I used this with leftover cubed turkey and a few veggies for chicken and biscuits. Way better than buying the canned stuff!!!

This was an excellent alternative to canned cream of chicken soup.  I generally find the canned stuff a little gross, and since my husband has a gluten sensitivity, we can't use it anyway.  I used this in a casserole, and it was great!  I used half and half only because our milk had expired.  And we used gluten-free flour instead of wheat flour.  But it thickened up really well and smelled delicious!  Thanks so much!

A little heavy on the pepper and light on the chicken flavor.  I do plan to try this again using pan drippings (didn't have any on hand this weekend) in the future.  Thanks for the base recipe!

First, thank you for a recipe that is all from scratch! :)
Second, I love this recipe, use it as often as I can- never like to use cans so I sub this in all of those recipes. It is a great base and lends well to whatever flavors you want. Just personalize the seasoning to your taste. The broth/stock is also going to affect flavor so use what you like. I sometimes use all broth- no milk- and stir in cheddar cheese... Goes great with chicken and broccoli. I also use this base with taco seasoning, mexican cheese, diced green chilies and shredded chicken for the BEST chicken enchiladas. :)
This is one of my top five recipes since joining. Thanks.

I needed cream of chicken soup and didn't have any cans on hand.  I doubled the recipe and used it to make chicken pot pie in a crock pot.  Perfect!

So so so so so easy to make instead of just opening a can of that gloppy stuff (which I do still use from time to time, but not every time). I cooked my onion and garlic in canola oil. I didn't add all the seasonings because I was using this in a king ranch mac and cheese recipe that had lots of seasonings. I did scale the measurements down for just enough for one "can".

Very tasty!  I had been looking for a good condensed soup recipe for a long time!  I've been wanting to avoid the MSG and additives in the canned version.  This worked great in a chicken casserole.  I mixed half of the soup (froze the other half for later use) with a cup of plain whole-milk yogurt, spread over chicken breasts, baked and served with brown rice.  My husband and kids (ages 4, 2.5 and 1) loved it!

Made it with extra garlic and spices and it tasted good.  However, I have no idea how anyone can make it without lumps by following this recipe.  I had to blend it to make it smooth.  Next time I will try to whisk the hot mix into the milk mix like another reviewer suggested.

I've never written a review before but had to rave about this....I'm gluten and dairy free so made this with gluten free flour and rice milk. I also used Knorr's condensed chicken stock mixed with the 1.5 cups water to give a rich flavor. (Instead of liquid stock as stated in recipe) This turned out perfectly for my husband's famous chicken stew...we've never made it dairy free and now we can!!

I was looking for a condensed cream of chicken from scratch and this was perfect! If you don't want condensed use less flour. It was lumpy for me though and I had to put it through the processor. Next time I'll make a rue in another pot and then add it all together.

Used this as a replacement for the polish chicken and dumplings I was making that called for a can of condensed cream of chicken and it worked so well that I will never use the canned stuff again! The trick is to pour the flour/milk mix very slowly into the broth while wisking quickly and you will end up with absolutely no lumps at at! I adjusted the seasoning just a bit to taste but was very happy with this recipe!

Perfect.  I used  Knorr chicken granuales and water instead of chicken stock and added 2 envelopes of Herb Ox sodium free chicken buoillon to make it more chicken flavored without adding more sodium.  Not sure if I needed to do that  though because I did it without tasting it first.  My family liked it, used it in our usual pot pie recipe and we really couldn't tell the difference.  I understood the slurry just fine and had no problems at all.  I'm going to make a batch of the spices so next time I use it I just have to add milk, water and slurry.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

This was a quick and easy recipe. Be careful cuz it thickens up very very fast. I really appreciate this recipe because I realized I was out and it was really nice to be able to rectify the situation. Thank you so much for the recipe

I make this weekly to replace the condensed cream of chicken soup in recipes. For health reasons, I need to significantly reduce the amount of sodium in my cooking. In this recipe, I use unsalted chicken broth and add a packet of sodium-free chicken bouillion to add a little more flavor. A tip on mixing the flour and milk for thickening -- pour the cold milk into a medium-size mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer or, better yet, a stick blender with the whisk attachment, and gradually add the flour while whisking constantly. This will help to prevent lumps. It tastes better than the canned soup and is much better for reduced-sodium diets.

I made this as a gluten-free, lactose free soup. I substituted a cup of milk for a cup of lactose free heavy cream and then thickened it up to liking with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch (gluten-free) dissolved in two tablespoons of milk which was then whisked into the boiling soup. I did all the spices, except the the all-spice, and loved the flavor. Topped with shredded Gouda and dried parsley. Very nice.

Worked really well.   Needed condensed for the recipe.  Used almond flour for someone on a carb free diet and it worked perfect for that also.  I've made it once before with regular flour and it was very good then too.

We made this for a recipe that required canned cream of chicken, so we did not actually include the chicken, but otherwise this recipe turned out great and worked in the recipe we were making - Creamy Chipotle Chicken.

I have made it twice, now.  I can't have onions, so that was left out.  I have family members who can usually not use commercially canned goods because of either additives or preservatives.   This recipe was easy and fast to make.

Great recipe. I sub TVP chicken, Vegan Imitation Chicken, or veggie broth, and soy milk to make it vegetarian, and it works beautifully. If you don't want it condensed, then just don't
thicken it so much. Use less slurry, and add it a little at a time until you achieve the desired thickness.

I made a 1/2 batch to go with the slow cooker chicken pot pie recipe. Changes: 1. Used left over cream from THX, 
2. no lemon-pepper
3. Added about one more cup of chicken broth because it was so thick when following the recipe. 
4. not much chicken flavor so added a boullion cube,
SO not really stand alone soup- but I believe it will be perfect for the pot pie recipe. 
Will try to review after final results.

This is a great go-to recipe. Another recipe I was making called for cream of chicken soup and I just don’t buy canned anything unless it says no salt added. This was a very tasty alternative and I’ve got to think much healthier.

I made this, using onion powder instead of a teaspoon of minced onion, and using a bullion cubes and stock from a chicken I made. I then added 2 additional cups of milk to make an actual soup out of it. I also added a cup of chopped chicken from said roasted chicken. The kids ate it up and my husband pronounced it quite good. This is a keeper. I just wish I'd known from the title that it is condensed not ready to consume soup.

This came out extremely goopy and clumpy... I followed the recipe and the flour & milk mixture was extremely thick (to say to "whisk" is a joke), and it was a bit bland. I added some extra salt and that did seem to help. I had to use a fine mesh strainer to get the clumps out at the end... will try a different recipe next time.

I have never seen a recipe like this, so I was curious to try it. Unfortunately, I was one of the people that didn't read the comments first. So I didn't notice that it was the condensed version. But having a little cooking experience, as I was putting it together, I did realize that there was too much flour going into this soup recipe. I made some on the Fly,  adjustments. It turned out well just just Okay. Has it really isn't up to par with most of the allrecipe.com recipes. Sorry. That's just my opinion.

This is a great recipe! It's a shame that the one bad review is so prominent. Instead of fresh onion & garlic, I used a teaspoon each of Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion & Garlic Garlic in the first step. I also had some leftover turkey stock frozen from Thanksgiving so used that with chicken bone broth to make up the 1.5 cups of chicken stock. Didn't add allspice, but used thyme, garlic pepper & paprika. While the stock was simmering, I used my Pyrex measuring cup with the pour spout for the milk & added the flour 1/4 cup at a time & whisked each addition until no more lumps appeared. I was a little worried that it would have a strong flour taste but it is truly delicious! It thickens perfectly when added to the stock & makes an amazing soup! So glad to be able to get away from canned foods! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Made using cashew milk and gluten free flour blend, came out great!  I did add 2 bouillon cubes and an extra 1/2 cup water as this flour has a strong flavor.  I used my stick blender instead of a whisk, and it came out very smooth.
Easy substitute for canned processed soup!

I would give it 5 stars, but I changed a few things. I did not add the lemon pepper seasoning or the allspice because I did not have it.  And I  put slightly less than 3/4 cup flour in because I did not want it to be too thick. Oh, I also used onion and garlic powder because I did not feel like chopping up a tablespoon of onion. But the taste was excellent and it was exactly what I needed for my recipe.

Used this in my Cheesy Broccoli & Rice casserole when I realized I didn't have any canned. It worked wonderfully and saved my Thanksgiving dish. I can't believe how easy it was and I will be using this a lot.

I made this to go in a casserole dish that called for two cans of cream of celery soup. I also didn't realize that it was a CONDENSED recipe. However I only used 1/2 cup of flour  (I thought that it was too much flour) and added a Knorr bullion cube since I didn't have any chicken stock, just the juices from the chicken I was sauteing. I made the mixture by melting butter and adding the flour until it made a paste, then slowly added the milk on a low heat.  I then added about 2 cups of water.  It was lovely in the casserole.

This is simple and delicious. Also easy to modify to personal preferences, for example gluten/dairy free. I've now used this in casseroles and even modified it into an awesome biscuits and gravy dish. :) edit: I don't have lemon pepper so I've been doing regular pepper and a splash of lemon juice, works grea

I can't digest msg which is in most commercial soups and the organic brands are expensive and not available in our really small farming town so I was really excited to give this a go.  Really easy to make and paired beautifully with our enchiladas recipe. We are Scandinavian Americans ?? and found tortilla are not any harder to make than lefse. So we don't  really like super spicy but I did add a teaspoon of cumin 1\2 teaspoon of chilli powder and a pinch of Mexican oregano and a dash of dill weed and season salt. For the broth I used 3 condensed chicken stock pods and 2 cups of water this recipe made a good dish an excellent one. My teenagers wolfed them down and my daughter is picky sometimes. This cream of chicken soup has just been added to my kitchen go to recipe also I had no problem adding a flour& water rue to thicken I mixed it like my grandmother taught me 1\3 flour 2\3 water in a mason jar tight lid and shake, shake,shake your booty slowly pour into boiling liquid while whisking briskly I use a silicone wisk.

The directions were easy to follow. I increased the recipe because I had cooked a chicken and had more stock than called for. Was thick and creamy. I used less pepper but added more salt. 

For my purposes I added shredded chicken and a pound of spaghetti to it for chicken noodle soup.  Everyone wanted seconds.

I made this  tonight for my chicken pot pie. Since I have made this before I used butter about a tablespoon to sauté the garlic and onions, and I used only 1/2 cup of flour instead of 3/4 cup. It is plenty thick and the flavor is great. When I uses the 3/4 cup flour it was so thick that I battled stirring in the cold milk. Love this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

After reading many of the reviews i decided to give it a try. And....This recipe is how to make the "cream". You will have to personalize it to your liking. I added leftover poached chicken breasts from the night before, carrots, peas, pasta and some water. TITLE IS A LITTLE MISLEADING BUT OH SO GOOD.

This was a big hit tonight.  I made this soup to make Chicken Pot Pie. It was perfect. I didn't have allspice so I subbed nutmeg, and I did add about a tlbs of bullion. thanks for a winner.

I had to change for our restaurant. I used the 40 serving adjustment but numbers didn't look right. I used 3 gallons of stock and 7 cups flour with 10 cups milk and ran through food processor.

This was a good base for a dish I had in mind.  But the end result following this recipe had very little flavor even though I did use pan drippings.  I had to put in two packets of Swanson Flavor Boost and some powdered chicken bouillon.  I made this to use up some leftover rotisserie chicken which I added with some sliced mushrooms and served over rice.  The end result after doctoring was very good.  Pure comfort food.
