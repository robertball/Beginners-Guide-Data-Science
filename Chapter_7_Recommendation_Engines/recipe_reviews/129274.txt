My husband loved this. He was only sad that the recipe yielded so little. Double it up for serving more than for 2 people.

Wow! I was skeptical about the seemingly strange mixture of ingredients, but it turned out great!  I don't really like mustard , but in this case I thought it really went well with the recipe. I don't like raw onions, so I sauteed them with the diced sweet potato to tone down the flavor. But I might try them raw next time because I could hardly taste them. I also left out the pecans because I didn't have any, but I think it would be yummy with chopped toasted pecans. I will definitely make this again!
