I used hot breakfast sausage instead of the ground beef. Since the sausage already had seasonings in it, I omitted the meat seasoning and the herbes de Provence. I also went very lightly on the salt out of personal preference. The cook time needed about 10 extra minutes. I added a salad for a delicious dinner!
