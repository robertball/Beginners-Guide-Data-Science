Good callout on the applesauce. I failed to specify that I'd used an unsweetened organic applesauce that was quite tart. Thank you!
RE: that cabbage: use the larger head. No such thing as too much cabbage in this one.

With the applesauce, this is on the sweet side!  I think tht the next time I make this, I will use a Granny Smith apple to make the applesauce.  There is great flavor combining the parsnips, cabbage and potatoes!  Thanks for the recipe!

This looks yummy! How many cups of cabbage? I have a tiny head of head of cabbage and a GIANT head so more specific amounts would be helpful....

This was a simple dish to make, however, the flavor was not what I was expecting nor did I like it at all with the cabbage in it. I think I will try it without the cabbage next time and perhaps add another veggie instead.

Didn't mind the flavors but I think half the cabbage and a little more potato and parsnip next time.  Also, using a potato masher instead of using a food processor made for a nice texture.

My husband and I made this dish for the first time, together. It was a lot of fun preparing as my husband is just a 'cut-up' himself! Sorry more of you cooks don't have this ingredient to add to your dishes!  The taste is very nice, we used plain ol' applesauce from a can.  Also, instead of truffle oil we just used olive oil. My husband add more garlic to this dish that what was called for (he always does this!) He enjoyed blending the first part as required, and was very impressed with the way it looked upon return to the pan.  We are simmering it right now, sipping it a little here and there. It's going to be fantastic.  We will serve this as a side dish to main dinners and enjoy it as comfort food, each night, in front of the TV until it's gone. Thanks so much. :))

I liked this. I was trying to use up parsnips and potatoes incredibly so the search found this. I used 3 granny smith apples and added them in with the parsnips and potatoes. I used chicken bouillon cubes instead of the booster. Oh yeah, I used russet potatoes since that was what I needed to use up and cubed them skins and all.

This is not good at all. What a waste of ingredients.
