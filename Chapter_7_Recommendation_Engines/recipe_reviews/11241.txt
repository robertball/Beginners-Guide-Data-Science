My mom used to make potato chip cookies and we all loved them. Unfortunately her recipe went to the grave with her 16 years ago. I thought I hit the jackpot when I found this recipe. It wasn't like hers at all. However it was easy quick and not bad. Just not what I was hoping for...

My family loved these. I just used butter instead of shortening. My only complaint is that they really stuck to the pan but that could have been operator error. Delicious!!

Everyone loved these. Just like grandma's for sure. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!! I used orange decoration sugar too for the tops since it is fall. The kids thought it was amazing:)
