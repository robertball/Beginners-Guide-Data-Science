These are really good tasting brussel sprouts!  Indeed, even people who don't like brussel sprouts may like them.  On the other hand, they are very rich...  If you are looking for a vegetable dish that is healthy and a light accompaniment for a heavier main dish - this isn't it.

Major crowd pleaser on Christmas Day.  Travels well as I made the recipe on Christmas Eve and drove two hours to NJ on Christmas Day.  Also, used frozen petite brussels sprouts (defrosted).

A huge hit on Christmas day...everyone commented that they didn't know sprouts could taste that good! Didn't change the recipe, just subsituted fresh herbs for dried as had them to hand. Many thanks.

I don't care for Brussel Sprouts anyway, but thought I'd try this...need to eat more veggies.  I think it is a good recipe, but I overcooked the sprouts(?).  They were mushy...be careful not to overcook them.  Plus,I used dill seed instead of dill weed and it overpowered the dish.  Otherwise, this is a good recipe and may help convert non-Brussel Sprouters.

I made these to go along side our Turkey dinner for something a little different than boiled or roasted brussels. They tasted pretty good. I will be making them again when I want a change from my roasted ones. Thanks

This was sooo good, I shopped for more brussels sprouts just so I could make it again! The only change I've made is to use 1/3 the amount of bacon so that the dish would be a bit more "low-fat."  Was still Very flavorable.

I am not a brussel sprouts fan but my family likes them. I really enjoyed them this way and my husband did too.

I did not like the sauce that accompanied these, it was too thick and gluey tasting.

Did not care for it... I followed the recipe exactly and my 'sauce' was not much of a sauce... too much flour, perhaps... 

I like Brussels sprouts, though, so I might give it another try with modification someday.
