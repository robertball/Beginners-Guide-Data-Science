Not exactly Galliano. But very close. I had to let mine age a little longer than a week to let the flavor mello out a bit. Next time I'll use more vanilla and less anise.

Reduced recipe by a fourth as it was the first time I was making the recipe.  Wow! It’s delicious and easy.  I didn’t have whole cloves so I used equivalent amount of ground cloves and then used a coffee filter to strain the solids out after 3 days.  Worked like a charm!
