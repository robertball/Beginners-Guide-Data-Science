This is a cookie like scone and very tender.  I used cream, it needed another teaspoon of the cream to come together (humidity off I think).  I used dried cherries which the ones I had looked a little too dry so I added 2 teaspoons of hot water to them before adding to the dough.  There was 1/2 teaspoon of liquid left from that and just added it in.  I will make again for sure.  I gave a piece to 3 co-workers and they said to keep this recipe close by.
