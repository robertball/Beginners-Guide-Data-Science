I admit that I was a bit skeptical of this one. While I enjoy mango, I was afraid it would detract from the crab (in which we were heavily, financially and shelling!) On the contrary, the mango and avocado were great compliments and I would recommend this to anyone looking for variety from eating crab straight out of the shell, or if your crab isn't the highest quality.

There's something to be said about a salad where the ingredients stand on their own for incredible flavor, needing no more than salt, pepper and a little fresh lime juice for dressing. Fresh and refreshing, colorful, elegant, beautiful for sure, inarguably nutritious,  full-flavored, satisfying and, oh yeah, simply delicious.  I chose to use mango, parsley and added a little minced jalapeno pepper.  A true masterpiece.

So Good!! We've made this probably 3 times since finding this recipe!! 
I used some substitutions...
king crab legs instead of processed,
choose peaches
green long onions instead of red,
Found it to be a little "too=something" the first time... mixed it with fresh spinach leaves as a base, and we loved it... so healthy and delicious!
combo seems weird but it works wonderfully!
Humble opinion..
BON APETITE!

This was just the recipe for me to use up a "perfect storm" of ingredients - crab, mango, avacado, bell peppers, and red onion (nice and sweet). Added basil (I pretty much add it to everything!).  I used A LOT more peppers since I had so many (1 1/2 WHOLE peppers), and I'm glad I did.  The avacado is also key to this recipe.  I had to use frozen, imitation crab, but this would be much better with fresh.  All in all, an interesting, BEAUTIFUL recipe - glad I tried it.

This is an awesome summer salad for a light dinner on a hot day.  My husband that runs from anything healthy loves this. I did try it with imitation crab meat and it was still delicious.  All the flavors go together very well.

Easy to make and delicious! I've made this twice. The first time I substituted shrimp and the second I used imitation crab.

One of the best things I've had in my life! I used mango and cilantro and scaled down the recipe for just 2 servings. It was beautiful and tasted heavenly. So refreshing and light yet so flavorful.

This was very delicious. I sliced the avocado since I needed to stretch it a little bit farther and put it on a bed of spring mix lettuces.

This is just great and easy.  I used imitation crab, the parsley option, and I mixed mango and peach.  Very good on a warm summer day.

This recipe was great!  I served it with romaine lettuce (minus the crab) as an accompaniment to a curried pumpkin soup and it was delicious!  I added extra peaches and doubled the red bell pepper.  My boyfriend thought peaches in a salad was going to be weird, but he loved it and asked for the recipe so he could make it this weekend while I'm out of town!  (This is after I sent the leftovers home with him.)

If it is not Dungeness crab from the great Northwest, it is NOT crab. I have eaten the blues and the kings, bt, the Dungeness is by far the sweetest and the most appropriate crab for this recipe.

This Recipe Hit The Spot! I was looking for a quick snack,something different and I had a bit of luck and had all the ingredients. I would serve the avocado on the side and make sure to skin the mango. I used canned peaches and the juice really helped.

This recipe is light and delicious! I too purchased my can of crab at Trader Joes. excellent quality and a good price. Get nice ripe mangos and ripe, but firm avocados. i seasoned mine with the Everything Bagel seasoning from Trader Joes.  It's great on homemade bagels and it's great in this salad too!  I served it on a bed of herb lettuce. My hubby loved it.

I used nectarines, 1/2 a red bell pepper and a lot more cilantro (just chopped up what I had left ˜ 1/3-1/2 cup) Also used 1/4 cup lime juice and did not add salt, let everyone do that themselves. Served it on a bed of romaine with a loaf of bread, what a great summer dinner. My Dad said "that was good for no salad dressing". High praise, indeed

XLNT!  Used peaches, cilantro, Walla onions and lemon juice; all else the same.  Served on gourmet lettuces and packaged crabmeat from Walmart, topped with fresh corn off the cob.  We loved it, but I wished I had some limes.  I will surely make this again with other fruits and combine some fruits as well.  Very unique, impressive and tasty!
