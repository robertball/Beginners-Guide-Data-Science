I came here just to point out that another reviewer, Kboy,  used a comma when he should have used a semicolon. Disgusting. Could not eat his review.

I cut back on the milk just a bit to make it thicker. Otherwise, super easy and really hits the spot when you're having a sweet tooth attack. I like to leave the Oreos a bit chunky. My 4 year-old loved it.

I love this recipe because it's versatile and kids go crazy for it. I change up the pudding depending on what I have or what I am craving. Vanilla, cheese cake, chocolate, and pistachio have all been winners.

Easy to make!!!!! I just wish I had the mint Oreos as this is for a Christmas get-together. I just might crush some candy canes and sprinkle on top, however!

So good! Here's a tip: crush your Oreos in a ziplock Baggie for less mess.

My daughter made it for today, but we started "testing" yesterday and its D lish!The only change is she used 1 box of instant chocolate pudding and 1 box instant vanilla. For travelling it fit perfect in a ice cream bucket!

It has Oreos in it, what is there not to like?!  This is my kid's favorite dish to take to a potluck where other kids are around, it always the first thing to go.
