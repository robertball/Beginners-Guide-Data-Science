Boring and bland...  thank goodness I read the reviews and then took into account the lazy palates of Americans.  For those who want body and flavour, sautee fresh onions, cook rice in stock, add fresh chopped chillies and half a cup of hickory sauce.

Good base recipe, I will make it again with a few changes. First of all I think I will leave the steaks whole next time, as the presentation wasn't very attractive. I also will substitute some or all of the water for beef broth. I'm glad I read the previous review because I would have included the spice pakcet from the wild rice mixture and it would have been WAY too much garlic flavor. Overall we enjoyed it, though, even pleased 2 out of 3 kids. Thanks for the recipe!

If you use a flavored wild rice from a box, be sure you do NOT add the spice packet.  This recipe adds spices, and the combination of worcestershire sauce gives a great flavor. My kids (ages 6 and 4) enjoyed it, and since the meat is cut during prep time, it saves time at the table. I added a 4-oz can of mushrooms, drained. This recipe will feed two adults and 2 children under 6 twice. My hubby had seconds, and we still have enough left over to have another meal.  I think it would be great for a potluck. I served this with steamed broccoli and a roll.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written without reading reviews first. I added the seasoning packet that came with the rice and the dish was excellent. Not too much garlic at all. Not too spicy. Hubby had three helpings and there was none left for lunch!

Good stuff, only I changed it a little.  I sauted onions with the butter and steak.  I also used a rice a ronie wild rice box mix with the sauce packet.  I didn't use the onion powder, garlic powder or worsheshire sauce. I also served it over biscuts which was delicious! guess i changed it a lot.  but my kids loved it!

Love this recipe. My husband keep saying "This is really good, I really enjoy this" My 4 and 5.5 year old loved it too.. It was a hit and I will make it again.
I used the season packet that came with the Rice A Roni Long grain and wild rice.

Excellent dish

After 1 hour the rice was still severely undercooked.  I have cooked the rice outside this recipe before and it came out great.  The liquid ingredients in this recipe did not seem sufficient to steam the rice for as long as it needed to cook.  I gave it one star because the taste was good...just crunchy.

Usually I don't like cube steak but make it because my husband does. This one was terrific. I used a little olive oil instead of butter and some real garlic instead of the garlic powder. Also I made white rice instead.

Came out ok, but we did a white wine deglazing and reduction and felt it added just what was needed.  We also did not cut up the cube steaks, but left them whole.  The recipe was a nice jumping off point.

It was great.  And, yes perhaps I would use half of the packet of seasoning or less of the recommended garlic powder.  It was a great and quick change

First recipe I tried, it was awful.  After making it, I realized it's important to read other's reviews for adjustments or warnings.  I don't think I'd ever try this one again, but if I did I'd definitely replace all the powdered onion/garlic with real.  Also, I don't think I should have added the spice packet that came with the wild rice mix.

This was a close call for me. I tried to make it exactly as written, but because of a couple of problems with the recipe, it wasn't as good as it could have been. This was the first time I think I'd ever bought cubed steak (my package was a little larger at 1.13 lb.). For the rice, I used Rice-a-Roni Long Grain & Wild Rice "Original", which came with a "Special Seasonings" packet. The recipe didn't mention anything like this; is there really supposed to be a package that contains just the rice? I've never seen it. I considered saving the seasoning packet for another use, but decided to use it. Also, I found there was way too much water used here. At 25 minutes, most was still there; I cranked up the heat to medium, and at 35 minutes, a majority of it was gone, but by then the rice was mushier than it should have been. The results tasted too much of the garlic and onion powders; even without the spice packet I thought those amounts might have been too much, and perhaps teaspoons instead of tablespoons would be better.
I liked the idea of this recipe a lot; the cubed steak and mushrooms and rice showed a lot of potential. Based on my experience, I'll only give this 3 stars; with adjustments to the seasonings and to the added water, this could easily be a 4-star recipe.

I only gave this three stars, but I shoudl probably preface that with the fact that I didn't follow it EXACTLY.  I only had rice pilaf on hand..so I used that, without the spice packet.  It was pretty bland.  I am def. going to try this again, and use more of my own spice,and wild rice.  My 1 year old loved it though....and with more spices my 3 year old will too.  I agree, great starter recipe.

This was good. A little soupy but might have been because I used a chopped onion. I replaced the mushroom with jalepeno since that is what I had on hand. I cooked it on low for 10 more minutes to see if it would absorb the liquid with not much luck.

This was a good quick recipe. However, I did make one change. I did not have the Long Grain and Wild Rice flavor of Rice-A-Roni so I used Creamy Four Cheese. We really liked it, however, next time I will use real garlic and onions. I want to try it with the correct flavor of rice as well.

this recipe was decent, i just used plain wild rice instead of one of the packets from the grocery store. It tasted almost too salty for me though.

Great, quick, and inexpensive meal.  I added a little bit of adobo to the meat while it was browning and used the suggestion of red pepper flakes.  I doubled the recipe but only used one of the two seasoning packets.

The flavours were good but the proportions were not right because my rice was very soggy and that just spoiled it :(
