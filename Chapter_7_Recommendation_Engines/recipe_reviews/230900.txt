I didn't have the bay leaf, but this still came out very good!  I added a dash of ginger.  I will be making this again and again.

I loved this recipe. It has so much flavor. I added black pepper too. It helps the body absorb tumeric better. The best part it is very healthy. I'm changing my diet due to post radiation treatment. This dish will be one of my favorites for sure

A great side dish but I'll cut the butter by half next time. I think I'll give it a try with wild rice too.

Took much longer than 40 minutes for this to get done. Rice was crunchy until I et it simmer and continue to add chicken stock to it. End result was good flavor.

Great recipe. I used olive oil in place of the butter, and I had no bay leaf. I added some black pepper to reap the benefits of the turmeric per other review. My husband and I loved this recipe.

I also made Chicken Tikka Masala and had a little extra chicken left over so I sauteed the chicken with the onions and garlic. I served with Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Masala. The entire meal was exquisite.

Didn't have turmeric but still tasted great! Added a can of tuna to sauce and served over rice that I had cooked separately in a rice cooker.

I love a good rice dish and was excited to try this. Was not disappointed as it was very tasty. I used white rice instead of brown rice. It is definitely a keeper.

I made it as described and it was too much thyme for my taste, made it a little bitter. I made it again cutting the thyme in half and was very happy with it.

This is good and easy to make.  I didn't have any chicken broth and just used water.  It still turned out good.  I only used 1 Tbl oil (olive oil) and am looking forward to making it again with the broth!

Easy to make, wife loved it.  Had to add extra water (maybe .5 cup more), and will cut back on the butter next time 3 tbs about one too much for me.

Omg so good, when family came home they were all in the kitchen wondering what I was cooking, so much more tasty than plain rice and great base to add veg or protein for rice bowl.

I thought this was really yummy! I used white rice instead of brown, a little less butter, and parsley instead of thyme.  Really loved the great flavor but simplicity of this dish. Will be making it again sometime!

Yum! I adapted this for my electric pressure cooker on the brown rice setting and it worked wonderfully.  IMHO the recipe needs salt to bring out the flavors of the other spices. The second time I made it, I added salt, increased the curry ('cause I like bolder flavors).  I doubled the recipe for leftover potential, cooked it 3/4 of the way on the brown rice setting and did a quick release.  Then I added rotisserie chicken, rough cut carrots and celery, then finished the brown rice cycle.  After a 10 min natural release I added frozen peas for color and brightness. It made the perfect curried chicken rice bowl. SOOO GOOOOD!  Thanks for the recipe. :-)

This is a very tasty way to cook brown rice. Great flavor. I added some pepper so I can get the full benefit of the tumeric.

This was really good. I used the ingredients exactly (except I omitted the butter for dietary reasons) and steamed it. With steaming, I had to change the rice/chicken broth ratio, but other than that, I made it as directed. This was delicious! I served it with grilled chicken, grilled pineapple, and broccoli for a very nutritious and delicious dinner. One of the best meals I've put together in a while where you just sit and amaze yourself how good the flavors all joined together to compliment themselves. I had the rice the next day mixed with some leftover red beans and it was wonderful! Awesome flavor! Thanks for sharing.

Made it strictly by the recipe except with veggie broth for my vegetarian wife- it was super good and even my low carb bodybuilder son had big seconds.  Went great with butter chicken!

I have made this a few times and liked it but I can't give it five stars just because I feel like it needs something "more". It's a good base recipe but I usually will add things to it for more flavor like fresh herbs or coconut milk. I am a novice cook though and haven't found the perfect thing that it's missing. I'll probably continue to make it because I think it has potential if I can just figure out the magic missing ingredient.

Very good. I made it to go with a scallop dish, and it was a very good accent. I'll be making this again.

I made this because spices and rice were pretty much all we had until I went grocery shopping. I used dried onion since I didn't have fresh. It was good but i am looking forward to the recipe with fresh.

Found it to be a bit too buttery in taste. Might lessen the butter and try again but my mother makes a similar recipe which I prefer.
