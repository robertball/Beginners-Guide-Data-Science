This is my dip and although I am so excited to have it listed on Allrecipes, I have to add that it was edited a bit. All of the changes were minor and do not change the dip, except two: I cook the chicken and then mix it up with the cilantro and that I like to add tortilla chips sticking out around the edge of the dip and more on the side for serving. Hope that helps and you enjoy it!

This was delicious!  The bacon really gave the beans a great flavor.  I would like a little more green onions and a little more tomatoes than what the recipe calls for, and maybe half the sour cream... but that's just my personal taste.  The recipe is easily adaptable.

Wonderful.  We really enjoyed.  Only changes were a) omitting bacon (cholesterol & all), and b) I used left over chicken breasts which I diced and then marinated in a little chicken broth, salsa, and a bit of taco seasoning.  Once I had layered the beans, chicken, and first bout of cheese, I also ran under the broiler to melt the cheese and warm it up a bit.  Then finished layers.  Served with spanish rice, chips, and a lite salad.

Like many other layered dips.  There isn't anything that makes this one stand out.   Good football food.
