I have a similar recipe that is always received well.  I cook the pasta, add the Italian dressing, then add a little McCormick Salad Supreme - about 1/4 of the bottle.  I stir this up and let it sit overnight so that the flavors can meld. Then the next day I add all the other ingredients and a little more dressing if necessary.  Delicious!

This is the best pasta salad I have ever made! I made it for a party for the first time and everyone loved it. I made it the night before, adding everything except the cheese, so the dressing would soak into the pasta. It was wonderful!! Just tossed the cheese in before serving, and add a little more dressing. I also cut chery tomatoes in half and added to the salad instead of cutting up whole tomatoes--less messy.

Great party or gathering salad.  Broccoli and Cauliflower as add in's are a must.  Also squeeze out the excess liquid from the tomatoes to keep from diluting the dressing.

I thought it was a bit bland too and I let it sit in the Italian dressing overnight before serving it.  One of my guests said it looked good, no one else said anything.  I wonder what could be added to "spice" it up a bit.  Any suggestions?

My husband made this pasta salad for a church potluck.  Several people said it was really good.  My husband said he would like it to be a little zestier than it was.  We might try adding some dry Italian dressing mix next time.  Instead of regular tomatoes, he used two pints of grape tomatoes.  We will keep this recipe!

I love this salad.  I have made it several times varying the vegetables each time.  I have even left out the ham and cheese and it's still great!  I also use the colored rotini pasta.

This is a great pasta salad.  I leave out the green olives because I find them overwhelming.  I also use Mozzerella cubes instead of shredded just for the texture change.

GREAT use-what-you've-got pantry salad. I used elbow macaroni, only used one bunch of green onions, eliminated the ham and the green onions, added a chopped cucumber and used a homemade Herbed Buttermilk, Garlic and Parmesan dressing instead of a bottled dressing. (We don't normally keep bottled on hand because homemade is SO much better.) This went really well with leftover Tanya's Louisiana Fried Chicken and BigShotsMom's blue cheese and cracked black pepper bread (only I used parmesan in her bread recipe. I'd make this again and again. NOTE: Husband told me to say this would be excellent with sliced chicken breast.

This recipe got rave reviews and our family KNOWS pasta salads!  The only thing I didn't add was the green onions...I'm not a fan of them.  My husband thought red onions would be good, and he might be right.  I also thought some blanched asparagus tips would be very good too.  The recipe is so easy and makes a huge amount for a summer potluck party.

This is a delicious and easy pasta salad.  It has plenty of ingredients that stick with you, so you aren't hungry only an hour or so after eating.

I was looking for a pasta salad and found this one and decided to try it. I had to cut the saturated fat back some so I left out the pepperoni and only did half the cheese. I decided I didn't want to mess with a block of cheese, so I just used some cheese crumbles I had in the fridge. I change the servings to 8 with the calculate button and it still made a giant bowl. Pasta comes in a 1 lb box anyway. The tomatoes were great in it because they came right from my garden. I used the black olives but left out the green because no one eating it cares for them. I bought seasoning mix instead of a bottle of dressing to mix up my own. I realized I grabbed Italian dressing seasoning mix instead of zesty Italian. I made it as directed on the package and didn't like the taste at all. So, I ended up just making a creamy based dressing like the picture, which I thought it was to begin with anyway. I used mayo with olive oil and added some of the seasoning to taste to it. I used 1/2 the dressing suggested, but it still worked great. This will definitely all get eaten up, thanks!

This was very good - I followed the recipe as written, but halved it. I used a zesty Italian dressing which gave it a very good flavor.

We just had this at my son's 5th birthday (for the adults). It was okay. I thought it was a little bit bland. If I did it again I would let it sit in the dressing for a while.

This is a very tasty pasta salad.  I like to let it sit overnight to "marinate" before serving.

This was very good. I loved the pepperoni. I had to sub salami for the ham, added fresh parsley, Italian seasoning, fresh grated asiago, and fresh cracked parm. I made this the night before reserving some dressing to add right before serving to keep it moist.

This is a great summer lunch side dish -serve super cold! Perfect for the 4th, or Labor Day or the like. I skip the ham, cheese and onions to make it more likable to my kids and pump up the pepperoni a bit. I buy pre-sliced pepperoni. Super easy. I also don't cook al dente. Try the tri-color spiral noodles!

Okay, I wasn't sure exactly how to rate this...but here is my review: I made this mostly to recipe with a few changes. I used rotini pasta, skipped the green olives, and used quartered cherry tomatoes. I also used chopped salami in addition to the ham and pepperoni. It looked beautiful - very summery, light, colorful. But I don't care for pasta salads, so I didn't really try it. (I made it for a party.) I didn't see a lot of people eating it and I don't recall getting any recipe requests, but there was a TON of other foods, too. I'm mostly basing my review on how nice the salad looked.

Terrific pasta salad-very much like an antipasti.  I added marinated artichokes and skipped pepperoni as my son does not like.  Also subbed some finely chopped red onion for green onions-personal preference.  I used Ken's (brand) Greek salad dressing.  Just right and didn't overpower all the flavors.  Thank you Patty!

I simply can't agree with this dish having a five star rating.  I made it for my family, and it came across as very average.  No one thought it was bad, but no one wanted me to make it again.

I prepare a lot of ethnic dishes, so it could be that we expect stronger flavors than normal.

I loved this recipe.  I did it for a Christmas Party last year and I had to leave the leftovers behind!..They would not let me take them home! It took me awhile to find it again this year, but I am making it again for another party.. I am guessing I won't be taking anything home again!

This is a great summer recipe! I have made this twice now for family and friends and they all love it. I varied the recipe the second time. I used the tri color pasta for color and substituted the ham for salami. I also added in brocolli which gave it a nice crunch! A little pepper is also good for flavor. I Love it and is definitly a recipe I will use for years!!! Thanks!

I made this for our church gathering and EVERYONE wanted a copy of the receipe.  I LOVE IT!!  I left out some things that my family does not like and it still tasted great.  I even added some of the extras that was recommended.  Thanks so much for this awesome receipe....

I love how this recipe is so flexible to your tastes and what you have on hand.  I used elbow macaroni and spaghetti and slices of turkey ham instead of the ham and pepperoni sausage (a healthier alternative).  I didn't use mozzarella, but instead mixed in some grated parmesan cheese. I think you should mix in the Italian dressing as well.  I also used lots of grape tomatoes and put the same amount of both kinds of olives (using the larger measure).  Wonderful!

I like to use either grape or cherry tomatoes,and small cubes of mozzarella cheese. I don't chop anything either, sliced onion (green or red), whole olives and meat cubes are better.

I am so addicted to this! I tried this recipe 2 weeks ago just for fun. I ended up eating it all by myself in just 3 days...I couldn't stop! I made it again last week, meaning to take some over to my parents house, but I ate it all again! It's so good! I especially love the pepperoni and black olives. I left out the green olives and made my own dressing, which you've got to try. It's the Dill Vinaigrette dressing submitted by Rinnie on this site...it is wonderful!

I wanted it spicy, did not have time to let things marinate and wanted a creamy dressing like the photos. I used the ingredients listed and dressed with creamy Italian dressing I from this site. With this combo and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper it was delicious and spicy.  Oh and I added green pepper chunks cause I had one that needed used.

Very Very good, we used macaroni shells instead of seashell pasta, our personal preference.  Great thanks for the post.

I too have a very similar pasta salad recipe to this one.  Instead of Italian I use red wine viniagrette, which gives the salad a nice color.  I don't use ham or pepperoni but I use lots of salami, and I always add cucumber and broccoli.  Also it's easier to half cherry tomatoes when they are in season.  The taste is always well received, and pasta salads are economical for the summer.

I only rated this 4 stars because of my own taste.  I think if I had used a better Italian dressing I would have liked it even more.  My husband seemed to like it alot.

Added cubed mozzarella instead of shredded. Used sliced salami instead of pepperoni and added  2 tbsp. Italian seasoning mix. This will be my go-to pasta salad recipe.
