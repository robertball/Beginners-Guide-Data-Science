This recipe is soooooooooooo delicious.  It's extremely rich.  The second time I made it I used eggbeaters for the eggs and lowfat peanut butter.  I also just used a little fat free milk instead of the whipping cream.  Then I covered it with fat free whipped cream.  It was still very good and still very rich.  Some earlier reviews had trouble mixing the peanut butter layer with the chocolate layer so I just mixed it all together before spooning it into the pie crust.

My husband liked this pie.  It is very rich, but very good.  My only problem with it, was that the peanut butter filling was not easily swirled into the chocolate and I ended up with some pretty big clumps.

This is a wonderful pie.  I added cool whip to the top and broke up receese peanut butter cups, added them to the top along with the melted chocolate to drizzle on top.  mmmmmm.  It was wonderful.  Very rich, but wonderful.

This is very rich. My guests really liked it, I found the strong margarine taste a bit off-putting. I used no margarine in the peanut butter layer and it was great. Next time, I'll try cutting the margarine to 1/2 cup in the choc. layer. I layered this pie - choc., p.b., choc and it came out very pretty.

We are peanut butter lovers, but this was just to much. I agree with those saying to cut the recipe to 75%, there was way too much filling.  
I suggest cutting the pieces small.

This was sooo delicious!!! EVERYBODY loved it! I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies, and it actually made enough for 3, so that's exactly what i did! The heavy cream I bought was 8 oz. so i just used it all (for a double batch which made 3) to make it easier to swirl the peanut butter into the chocolate. This will definately be my annual recipe i bring to picnics!!  Thank you for sharing it!

I don't really get what adding the raw eggs does, so I used a 1/4 of Milk instead. Everything fit in the pie crust and it came out really good.

This pie was so good! My family could not believe I made it, and asked where I bought it. Make sure to use chocolate crumb crust. Also, the recipe makes extra batter

I mistakenly hit submit for my last review and I could not figure out how to edit it.  So to finish I was going to add that with the raw eggs in the recipe, I would not be comfortable with serving this to a general group.  That is why I only gave it 3 stars.

This recipe is amazing and people are still talking about it. If you use a store bought oreo crust, then the recipe will almost make 2 pies. You could make one large pie and several smaller ones with the individual pie shells. 

The peanut butter is hard to swirl into the chocolate and it just seems lumpy, but when you cut into the pie it all seems to have worked out. 

Be sure to drizzle the semisweet melted choco over the top. It not only makes it pretty to serve, but adds to the taste as well. Some whipped topping would be nice as a garnish, but not neccessary. 

You have to try this!

8 ounces of chocolate, 4 eggs,  2 sticks of butter, peanut butter, and heavy cream...what can I say...
I had a heart attack just MAKING this pie.

But seriously, every year I make one pie that after you've eaten some, you can hear your arteries hardening.
I made 2 this year, this and the Black Bottom Pie III...
I have a feeling this will be served in very small slices, but there will be more sinful pleasure in those small slices than in all the other pies combined.

Just a note:  You might want to make 75% of the recipe listed here.  Especially if your using a standard store-bought Oreo pie crust...I couldn't nearly get it all to fit

I loved this pie! It was sooo good. The only suggestion I have is that you add way less penut butter, maybe like 1/2 a cup or so because otherwise it just tastes like oure penut butter! But you need to try this, its great!

This was very very easy to make.  I took it to dinner with the in-laws, and it went so fast that there were people upset over not getting any. I'm now known as the great pie lady.  Thanks!

It was very rich and good. But for all work, i would expect more. It's kinda simple, but addictive.

Exceptionally Good, Especially If You Like Rich Peanut Buttery Flavor. Too Much Filling, Reduce To 75%. I Also Have OneOther Suggestion. Use Milk Chocolate Instead Of Semi Sweet.  Just Prefer Milk Chocolate OverSemisweet In Recipes. Fantastic As Is though

This was a great recipe!  I noted the comments below & bought two oreo pie crusts, the filling is definitely enough for two.  I mixed the chocolate/peanut butter mixture in a bowl before putting it into the pie crusts, which worked fine.  I garnished the pie with melted, drizzled dark chocolate & chopped peanuts.  It is very rich and good served with a glass of milk or vanilla ice cream.

This was good. I noted some people had trouble swirling the peanut butter mixture into the chocolate so I did half at a time and it worked out great.

My family loves this pie.  It is silky, and has a great blend of chocolate and peanut butter.  I make my own crust from graham crackers, melted chocolate and butter which adds to the total enjoyment.  It's a great SPLURGE!!
