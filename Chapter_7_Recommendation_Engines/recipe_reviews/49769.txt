TGI Friday's has a dish called the Roasted Veggie Sandwich.  I wanted to duplicate it, so I used this recipe.  Instead of feta, I used a thick slice of mozzarella, added roasted red peppers, and spread the pesto mayo onto the foccaccia bread. Yummy...tasted pretty close to me.  Thanks for the recipe Erin!

This sandwich was awesome!  It caught my eye because I had most of the ingredients on hand but had to make some slight alterations.  I toasted the focaccia bread slightly, then put my pesto sauce on one side and the mayo-mixed pesto sauce I happened to have from another recipe on top.  I didn't have a red pepper so I used a green one.  I sprinkled a little olive oil on top of the gr. pepper and a little black pepper and baked in my toaster oven for about 10 mins.  I used tomato-basil feta cheese and the fresh basil leaves.  Stupendous!  Think it will be even better with a red pepper.

Too fatty what with the oil and mayo. Better to mix the pesto with riccotta cheese in the blender. Also, basil is expensive. We make pesto of fresh spinach leaves, parsley, lemon juice, walnuts, parmesan cheese, and canola oil. We swear by it, try it.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was okay but after awhile the red peppers didn't taste that great.  I think it would be better with a nice grilled chicken breast, but then it wouldn't be vegetarian.  I don't plan on making this again.

Another alternative I like is Herb Foccacia bread with spinach, tomatoes, and mozarella, and pesto spread on the bread. Sprinkle salt and pepper in the sandwich and viola!

Very tasty! A little oily given the roasted red peppers in a jar and the pesto, but you can cut back on that by roasting the red peppers yourself. I also skipped the mayo, and used thin sliced sun dried tomatoes instead of sun dried tomato pesto. (On the other hand, foccacia has a tendency to dry out so don't go over board!) : ) 

I would definitely recommend trying goat cheese instead of feta. Goat cheese seems to compliment the flavors here better. I like feta better with some regular tomato, red onion and cucumber, for a healthier, veggie alternative (untoasted if incl. cucumber). 

All in all, great sandwich! I made a big one sliced into appetizer-size pieces for a tailgate and they were gone in a snap!

I really love all these ingredients on their own, but togther, they were just too overpowering for me.  The cheese and the pestos were just too much.  If I ever make this again I would use mozzerella instead of a stronger cheese.  That said, it was still entirely edible, I'm just not likely to make it again.

A yummy sandwich and a great option for lunch.  The only change I made was to toast the bread, other than that I followed the recipe and enjoyed every bite.  Thanks!

I made this for a laid-back dinner with some vegetarian friends and it was awesome!  They loved it, my carnivorous husband loved it, and even our 1 year old babies loved it!  Excellent recipe.

Wow - what a sandwich!  I toasted the bread and used Hellman's light mayo along with the basil pesto. I left out the sundried tomato pesto and instead opted to add regular sundried tomatoes. I also used thick slices of fresh mozzarella instead of feta. Overall, very tasty!

I added some thinly sliced roasted chicken. Forgot to add the extra basil but I think the pesto was more than enough. Did not bother with the mayo. I did not have the sun-dried tomato pesto, but did use slivered sun-dried tomato pieces. This sandwich taste better if made ahead, wrapped tightly in plastic and then refrigerated to let the flavors get a chance to develop. A good sandwich for the picnic basket.

This recipe was a real winner with my husband and I.  I used my homemade whole wheat focaccia, I left out the mayo and I used my homemade basil pesto.  They kept nicely in the fridge for several days wrapped tightly in foil so my husband could take them to work.  I'll definitely make this one again and again.

I first tried this out a couple of years ago and it's been a staple in our house ever since. My husband often requests it as a light summer dinner and he's a big meat eater. It works great with either feta or mozzarella. I also like to grill it in our griddler for a couple of  minutes.

Marvelous! I couldn't find focaccia so I took a mini round loaf and sliced out the middle horizontally - worked great. Suggest putting in the oven on high for a couple minutes to crisp the edges of the bread.

I probably shouldn't rate this because I made so many changes, but it definitely made a nice and elegant lunch.  I didn't have focaccia, so I toasted two slices of crusty italian bread in the oven, brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary, thyme, and oregano.  Also, I roasted my own red peppers on the same sheet, putting them in earlier.  I didn't have any sun-dried tomato anything, so I just stuck with two doses of regular pesto and the yummy fresh basil.  The feta gave it lots of zing, which I like, but I can see it being just as good with a milder cheese like mozzarella, assuming that it would be broiled.  In the end, mine tasted like a bruschetta sandwich, but I really can't complain!  Will make this again, probably.

We didn't fancy the may with the pesto, so spread the pestos straight. Loved it so much we grill extra peppers every time we barbecue. Also superb with rocket salad instead of the fresh basil

We changed the recipe a bit per one viewers suggestion and made it with goat cheese instead of feta.  Hubby grilled the sandwiches up on the grill - so good!!!  We loved them and will make them again.

Awesome! Easy! Delicious!
I added chicken and have used mozzarella instead of Feta and it is wonderful! Tons of raves from
co-workers. Wonderful on Ciabatta bread also!
Thanks Erin Rowland for your tasty recipe!
I love it.

This was a great sandwich.  
I add a portabello mushroom that I had marinated for a couple of hours in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and then grilled.  To me, that made the sandwich sheer perfection!
Yummy...

I made my own focaccia bread for this.  The sanwiches were delicious and easy.  One assembled, I toasted in the oven for about 7 minutes.  Yummy!  Great with soup or salad.

Very delicious, I used more of everything and used fresh mozzarella in place of feta!

These are pretty good sandwiches, especially when trying to find a veggie option.  We forgot the basil leaves and each person customized them.  My kids liked the mayo with the basil pesto best.  We didn't find sun-dried tomato pesto so we chopped sun dried tomatoes.  To roast the red peppers I halved and seeded a pepper and put it under the broiler at 500 for about 15 minutes.

Delish!!  Made on sourdough with homemade pesto, added roasted red peppers, spinach and omitted mayo.

This was a great combo of flavors. I couldn't find focaccia so I used an artisan garlic and asiago loaf, that I made one giant sandwich out of and then cut down into servings. We LOVED this and I would happily make it again.
