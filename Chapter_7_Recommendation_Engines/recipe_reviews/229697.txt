I made this today and they are very good! I left out the green onions because I don't care for them and I used 7 oz of green chiles just because that's the size I had and I figured extra wouldn't hurt.  Good recipe =)

followed recipe just as written.  Next time would add a little more hot sauce or spicier salsa-wasn't spicy at all.   Also, make sure your layer is thin on tortillas before rolling or rolls right out of shell and makes a mess!  Didn't use end cuts of each tortilla because they wouldn't stay shut and didn't have much mixture on them.  Very much a crowd favorite!  Makes a lot!

This is a great recipe and it makes a lot so a good dish for a big crowd. Make sure you refrige the rolls as the recipe calls for because it makes it so much easier to slice. Trust me.

The flavor in these was fine, not really spectacular but ok.  My problem was with the consistency- even after chilling for much longer than the time specified it was too goopy.  In my opinion the sour cream is unnecessary and waters down the filling too much.  Cream cheese alone would have provided a better consistency for the filling.

This was quick and easy to make for a last minute get together.  Followed the recipe exactly.  If I did it again, I'd probably add a bit more filling and spread it among 10 tortillas instead of 12.

I made this for my daughter's wedding reception, and they were quite the hit.  I had serval people ask me for the recipe.  I loved how easy these were to make.

I've made these for years and they are always a crowd pleaser. I omit the salsa, hot sauce & green onions at the request of my hubby.  I then add finely shredded cheddar cheese.  Very good

Really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made them and they were really good. The second time, I was looking for something easy to take on a day-long boat trip. I wanted more of a "sandwich," but easier. So I added some finely chopped chicken to the mixture and, after it was spread on the tortilla, I also sprinkled finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the mixture before rolling. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. They were a huge hit and went really fast. And so easy on the boat! No mess, bite size, and gave us some real food. I might even make these for lunches! Like other reviewers said, you have to cut off the ends when you are slicing it - but that makes a good treat for the person doing the prep (and, in our case, any kids that happened to be hanging around in the kitchen and want a snack!). And make sure you spread the mixture thin on the tortillas.  A great recipe.

I have been making these forever. They are always a hit. The key to this which makes them easier to cut, is to refrigerate for about 4 hours if you have the time. These get better the next day as well. Great recipe that pretty much everyone loves.

Not bad for an impromptu recipe for co workers. The taste is really fresh when you do add the green onion and the texture is just right. I do want to say that you don't want to leave in fridge too long, overnight is fine but let them rest at room temperature so that you don't collect condensation.

Fan favorite! I used the recipe exactly with the exception of black olives, instead I used black beans which have a great texture. I added additional salsa and left out the hot sauce because I used McCormick taco seasoning-mild which gave it that extra kick. I also used green tortilla wraps for color. Yum!

I liked it. I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'm going to add shredded chicken, spread the filling thinner and hunt for a higher quality taco seasoning.

Cheap, easy and a large crowd pleaser. This has the classic taco roll up taste of the roll ups I had in the 1990s. Exactly what I was searching for.

These don’t look great, and are messy to make. But boy, are they yummy! These were a huge hit a a church function. I put a little extra garlic and that’s the only modification. Definitely doing these again

Yummy, yummy!  I love black olives and my husband does not.  So on 6 of the tortillas I sprinkled the black olives on top of the cream cheese mixture before I rolled them up.  Problem solved and we are both happy!

Pretty good basic recipe.  My guests seemed to like them but as for me, they need to be kicked up a notch.  Next time I will add shredded chicken to the mixture, spread it on the shells and then add fresh diced tomatoes and shredded cheddar.  I will also add more hot sauce or use a hotter salsa.

These turned out great! Didn't add the green onions or hot sauce and did add about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Everyone enjoyed them even my 18 month old!

I prefer these with a smaller amount of onion, but it is a taste issue, and I don't care for black olives so I left these out.  I like the addition of the sour cream to make it easier to spread but I think the ratio is a little high.  I also prefer less taco seasoning.  I added adds about 2 c. finely shredded cheddar cheese and served with picante sauce for dipping (salsa is too watery and hard to get on the rolls).

after reading previous reviews I decided to make these at the last minute.  Rather disappointed.  I was not able to add enough cream mix without it spilling out, so I rolled the tortillas tightly and they ended up pretty tasteless.
