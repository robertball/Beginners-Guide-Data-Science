Oooooooooh. This is good! Unexpectedly good. I didn't think I'd like this at all. I cut back on the rum to one ounce,
and did the remaining liquor the same.

This will be great to make around Christmas. They are intense, though.
Drink them slow!

I used DeKuyper peppermint blast and Captain's Tattoo Rum.

I wasn't huge on the taste, but I threw a holiday party and everyone LOVED these. Plus, even though I wasn't crazy about how it tasted, they were sooo cute with a red sugar rim and the small candy cane garnish. This is such an easy way to impress people! I can't wait to make them again for this year's Christmas party.

My wife loves them. I will say they take your breath away. Myself, I'd cut the drink with a little 7-up or sprite maybe as much as 50-50.

I followed the recipe exactly, but served two, not just the one serving the recipe states.  It is strong tasting, but I don't know what it needs to smooth it out.  I might try it again, substituting vodka for the rum.

Very strong with a cough syrup taste. I made the recipe exactly as written. To strong for me but I like the idea of a peppermint martini. Try cutting the alcohol in half and adding sprite or a 7 up floater.
