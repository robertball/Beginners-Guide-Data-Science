I took a little different spin on this, using tomato sauce put up from my own garden tomatoes rather than chopped, fresh tomatoes.  I cut the chicken into strips rather than chunks.  Didn’t bother with either the lemon juice or cayenne, but did add garlic and fresh sliced cremini mushrooms along with the minced shallots and some chicken broth to the tomatoes, cream and wine.  At the submitter’s encouragement, I used chopped, fresh basil and parsley rather than the tarragon, which I’m no fan of.  Rather than measuring any of the ingredients strictly I simply used them in the amounts that looked right to me, but I think it’s safe to say I probably used about equal parts of my tomato sauce and cream and fairly generous amounts of the chicken broth and wine as well.  I served this over pasta along with a Caesar salad.  Hubs and I really enjoyed this pleasant, homey dish.

We thought this was a very mild, subdued dish that lacked complexity of flavor.  This worked well served over four cheese tortellini.    I made it exactly as written as I was the first reviewer, but I recommend kicking it up a notch with additional seasoning.

Wonderful! I made this exactly as written, except that I left out the shallot (personal preference). I did not find it at all bland, as others have mentioned. It is simply sublime. I served it over mini farfalle pasta (tossed first with EV Olive Oil and butter), with grated Parmesan for sprinkling. This is similar to Alfredo Sauce, and the lemon and tomatoes gave it a nice zing. Will definitely be making this often ... easy and elegant.

It's a very simple and homey recipe. The sauce isn't too flavorful, and when ever I make it I add extra cream and chicken, also I use lemon pepper and hardly any cayenne pepper. I also use extra tomato if I have any extras available. It's nothing amazing , but just tastes so good regardless. I always make it with tricolor penne pasta, and my family devours it each and every time.

I just made this.  I followed the recipe as stated above so I can rate it.  I think it's very mild and it makes me think I should have added more seasoning and cayenne pepper. Next time I make it, I will add red pepper flakes and other herbs, perhaps oregano and basil. It was easy, and looked appealing.  Next time I'll make it tastier.
