I came across this recipe and I just had to comment.  There is an art to making a grilled cheese sandwich.  It has to be cooked on low heat in order to evenly toast the bread as well as melt the cheese inside.  My husband, bless his heart, cooks EVERYTHING on high heat so that he can finish faster.  His sandwiches tend to be burned on the outside while the cheese inside is not completely melted.  With that said, I make mine with whole wheat bread and sharp cheddar cheese, served with tomato soup and a sweet pickle.  This is one of my favorite lunch or dinner meals.  I truly enjoy this site and the reviews and tips, which are mostly well thought out and constructive.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

How can a grilled cheese sandwich NOT get 5 stars?!  I loved to read all of the comments.  So I had to add my variation that I did not see anyone suggest.  Back in the late 80's, when I was in high school, my friends aunt was doing Weight Watchers.  They told her to, instead of using butter on the outside of the bread, apply a thin layer of mayo.  It grills up great, adds a little extra flavor, and is less fattening than the butter.  It spreads thinner so you hardly use any but still have something to give you a crispy crunch.  I also add mustard to the inside.  Yum!  All 3 of my kids love it this way.  Great post!

I do agree this recipe is a classic, one that goes hand-n-hand with "How to boil water" as seen on another site. But for those looking for a truly different addition to an old favorite, try this. 
Make the grill cheese sandwich as usual, but without buttering the bread. When the cheese is melted to your likeing, remove the entire sandwich from the pan. Since both sides of the bread will be lightly toasted, you can now dip both sides of the sandwich in an egg batter and return it to the pan. If desired, one may be creative with the egg batter using a spice of your choice, such as garlic, even finely minced fresh onions. Anything really. If you butter the bread prior to placing the sandwich in the pan, the bread will get soggy and will not cook the eggs properly. Try it and be pleased with your invention.

Ingenious!  I made some changes though.  I switched out the bread for a hamburger bun.  I didn't have any cheese, so used ground beef and made it into a patty, first grilling it.  If you don't have butter you can just toast the bun (I used the recipe on this site called "perfect toast" but substituted buns for the bread.).  This recipe would be perfect for my friend Nicole!

AllRecipes.com has taught me everything I needed to know about boiling eggs, baking potatoes, and, yes, frying up a grilled cheese sandwich.  These things aren't always obvious to people not raised by housewives, and I needed a trusted source to teach me the basics of cooking.  Hooray for AllRecipes.com.  Boo to snarky food-snob commenters!

I personally like it that allrecipes.com has published basic recipes! Although I already knew how to make a grilled cheese it was nice to print this one out for my son who is wanting to learn how to cook. Kudos to allrecipes for knowing their are newbie cooks here! Thanks Sara!!!

I particularly like the suggestion of the proper beverage to drink with this meal.  However, if one uses white cheese, instead of the yellow Cheddar, does one stay with beer?  However, I must keep looking.  I truly need to find a recipe for iced cubes.  I have gotten it frequently from my granny, but never wrote it down.

I had to laugh that someone submitted this as a recipe, but it also looks like the place to put our favorite variations, so here goes.... 

Put a thick slice of sharp cheddar cheese on a french baguete, with a slice of granny smith apple, and cook on a george forman grill (great alternative to buying an expensive pannini press). No need for butter as the forman is nonstick, you just might want to press down on the lid a little while it cooks.

Definitely a classic that goes great with tomato soup!  I use multi-grain bread and add a slice or two of tomato to make it a little more healthy. This is my husband's favorite, especially with the addition of a little ham or bacon.

My variation on this classic recipe is to use rye bread, spread a thin layer of spreadable cream cheese on one or both slices (the surfaces facing the cheese), and use Monterey Jack cheese.  Then butter and fry as usual.

I don't use butter at all. Sometimes we use sharp cheddar, havarti, mozzarella, use a thin slice of tomato, and always use mayo. I use my George Forman Grill, make my tomato soup at the same time and never worry about burning my sandwich.  Hubby loves them done this way.  NEW: now we have to add a bit of crispy bacon and a few slices of Granny Smith apple before we put them on the George Foreman - ohhh so tasty!

I feel like I discovered the best way to make grilled cheese ever, don't know anyone else that does it like this, I tell everyone...how to make the most awesome grilled cheese ever and make enough for a family so they are all done at the same time?  Buy a loaf of nice and wide italian bread, cut nice size slices on the diagonal (looks nice!) put together like the recipe says....and you can add whatever you like, we like turkey breast and bacon with ours!  Put your sandwiches together using two slices of cheese, put your lunchmeat inbetween and BAKE THEM!  I bake them at 400 degrees, keep an eye on them, check after 5 minutes or so....when you lift them up you will see the most beautiful crusty sandwiches.  Flip when you like the way they look and get the other side nice and golden and toasty.  You have to use BUTTER.  You can bake just regular grilled cheese too, its so nice because you will have 6 sandwiches done and hot at the same time.  Let me know if anyone tries this....I just love them this way.

Classic. I took my classic grill cheese to a new level and made cute little cookie cutter shapes. Yes, the Christmas tree grilled cheese pics are my creativity run amok. (:

I love grilled cheese, but I mix garlic powder, oregano, and basil into the butter before buttering the bread.  It tastes so fancy!

I have been a consumer of grilled cheese sandwiches for most of my life.  However, I never really tried anything different with them (other than spreading the top of the sandwich after cooking with a layer of jelly or jam...any kind will do...very yummy!).  But after reading this recipe and all of the reviews/variations, I became a litte more adventurous.  My favorite variation is to use a whole grain, rustic bread (I get mine from Whole Foods), spread the outside of each bread slice with a THIN layer of mayo (still haven't gotten hubby trained...he slathers it on much too thick), 2 slices of Tillamook cheddar cheese, and about 6 or 7 shots of Chipotle Tabasco sauce in between the cheese slices.  I love this sandwich so much!  Thanks for the post to get people talking; it's been ever so much fun to read all of the variations!

Another twist is the pizza grilled cheese...instead of cheddar use mozzarella, add in pepperoni slices and pizza sauce.

Now, now, guys, no need to get nasty. I've actually seen a recipe for salted boiled water on another site. (now that's pathetic) Anyway, I enjoy putting sliced red onion and a little bar-b-que sauce on my sandwich before grilling. It's really good!

I have been very very sick the last few days and my young daughter used this site to make Mommy a grilled cheese sandwich so I would feel better.  I see a lot of people pooh pooh-ing the idea of putting simple, easy to follow, recipes on here but this is why I think it's a great idea.  My sandwich was great, and it gave my daughter a boost of confidence in the kitchen that she needed.

Yes this is truly a classic. I have made it many times. Feel free to use any type of bread and any cheese you have on hand instead of cheddar. I usually wind up with American on wheat. I only give this a 7 for difficulty though. I add some mustard zing to mine by spreading it on the second piece of bread and then placing it mustard side down on top of the cheese. I then perfom the tricky manuever of spreading the butter on the top of the already assembled sandwich. To give the performance real panache, when the cheese is all melted and gooey I place the finished sandwich on the plate and gingerly flop open the top piece of bread to expose the gooey cheese. I then apply a dollop of sweet pickle relish and flop it back together (with flare of course). The cool relish is a nice contrast to the hot cheese instead of grilling the relish as the sandwich cooks. Timing for this complicated gyration is critical though because as the cheese cools the pieces of bread become more and more glued together. The sandwich must be separated when it is gooey and very hot. What your fingers!

Amazing!  This is nearly identical to my family's
closely-guarded grilled cheese recipe.  For those
willing to get a little adventurous - try using
American cheese instead of cheddar.

awesome recipe! i went all out and made a triple decker :) like most of the cooks on this site, im quite an accomplished cook (at least, my husband thinks so) but its nice to get back to the basics once in a while and see how everyone else does it...looking thru the reviews i found 2 great tips: cook on med low-low heat, and use cookie cutters for fun shapes! my 3 yr old loved her snowman GC sandwich. for the triple decker, i did a regular grilled cheese sandwich (becel olive oil spread with omega 3s) and grilled both sides, then on one grilled side i layered 2 slices of honey maple ham, paper thin cucumber slices, avocado slices and some baby spinach with the stems ripped off, then topped with another slice of buttered bread. flipped and grilled the 3rd layer. delish! healthy and indulgent. oh and i spread mayo and mustard on the inner bread layers. oh and i used ancient grains bread for a nice nutty crunch. so good.

Grilled cheese is great even better with a little basil sprinlkled on top of butter before grilling. Went to a little cafe in Key West and basil is what they used on their grilled cheese and it makes it extra special!

Kind of funny how this would be a "recipe."  This is certainly a staple for me on those nights where I don't feel like cooking or I want a warm, quick lunch from the grill.  My only comment is that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE horseradish on my grilled cheese.  Try it, it's a fantastic combination & spices them up just right.

This is good but it must be cooked at a low heat as others have stated. My personal favorite is rye bread with muenster cheese and a dill pickle spear on the side. yum!

Hey...everybody has to start somewhere right??  This is an excellent base for grilled cheese and a great way to experiment with different breads and cheeses.  My son could eat these everyday...I even get to sneak in some ham or turkey on his good days.

Nothing like a classic grilled cheese. My friends and i held a grilled-cheese-off, the winner was a toad-in-the-hole grilled cheese: cut a circle out of one piece of buttered bread, put it in the hot pan and crack an egg into the hole. When the whites are cooked top with the cheese and the other slice of bread and flip. SoooOo good, although there was some controversy amongst the other contestants as to whether the addition of the egg disqualified it as a true grilled-cheese sandwich, personally i think if its grilled and there is cheese involved there is no reason to limit the delicious potental of this culinary delight. I like putting a slice of tomato and some fresh basil in mine, it'll blow your mind!

Something my family always did, which I didn't see listed here, is cook the grilled cheese on a Waffle Iron.  Make sure you either don't care about the waffle iron, or you have a good non-stick waffle iron.  It can get messy, but it is SOOOOOOO good.

Just 5 words: Highly recommended for first timers! (sorry, just had to comment).  Although this presented a great laugh, I have also used red or chopped green onions for some bite.  Add a slice of ham and you have a grilled ham AND cheese!  But who am I to talk...I have a bachelor friend that can hardly make toast...I'll be sure to recommend this one to him.

I think that I have been making this for 25 years (I'm now 32).  Be creative and place 1 slice of the bread in the pan (butter-side down) and spread mustard on it, then add the cheese & a slice of ham.  YUM!

Love all the suggestions!  The ONLY way to eat a grilled cheese sandwich is to add "thin thin" thinly sliced onions (separate the sliver thin rings so that there's just a few in with the cheese) and grill.  yum, yum, oh so good!

I always have a hard time cooking the outside and having the cheese melt.  So what I do is fry one side until golden brown, flip it, remove from hear and put on the cover.  The residual heat slowly toasts the bread and the lid holds in the heat and almost steams the cheese to melt.    I usually don't like plain grilled cheese.  I always like meat in mine, so I add either thinly sliced ham or salami.  Oh, and I always have two slices of cheese.

Give me a break.  I'll give this 5 stars because I simply love a basic grilled cheese sandwich.  However, I'm shocked that so many people actually rated a grilled cheese recipe so seriously.  I'm no master cook by any means but I think I learned how to make a grilled cheese sandwich when I was tall enough to reach the top of the stove.  It's not exactly culinary rocket science.  Shame on me for reading as many reviews as I did.  But it was a nice laugh.

Everyone knows about grilled cheese and tomato soup. I've discovered something better. Use cheddar and mozzarella cheese on your grilled sanwiches and serve with chili. It's a great meal that all my guys love.

When I make a grilled cheese sandwich, I like to  butter both sides of the bread and fry both sides, so that you have a sandwich that's double-grilled. It tastes great, and has a wonderful texture.  When one side of the bread slices are as brown as I like it, I flip both bread slices over and transfer them out of the skillet and on to a tray, browned side up. I spread the slices with mayo, add thin slices of cheese to one piece of bread,  then add thin slices of tomato on top of that, and then thin slices of cheese on top of the tomato. Last, I put the other slice of bread on top, browned side in. You now have a sandwich that needs to get a nice brown crust on the outsides. Back into the skillet it goes, and brown both sides, being careful not to scorch. Gooey, hot, and really good!

I like my grilled cheese sandwich with lots of oozy, creamy cheese. My favorite is two slices of American cheese and one slice of pepperjack cheese per sandwich. Topping the finished sandwich with a very light sprinkle of salt brings out the flavors.

I had to look up "grilled cheese sandwich" on Google to make one.  Following these instructions carefully I made my *first ever* frying pan g.c.w.  Not only did it come out perfect and was delicious, but you wouldn't have believed how beautiful it was!  I should have taken pictures, but I gobbled it all up.

As another reviewer said, you have to start somewhere and grilled cheese was one of the first things my mother taught me to cook.  My 17 month old loves them, and I can spice mine up as needed.  Great for those nights it is just the two of us and I don't want to cook.

I have to say that while many people here comment on the fact that its basic cooking knowledge, MANY people dont know exactly how to make a grilled cheese.   So dont be so rough guys, I guarentee that at least ONE point in your life you had to ask someone how to make a grilled cheese. ;]  As a variation, I like to add ham to the cheese mix, butter on the outside of both pieces of bread and mayo on one side of one the pieces and honey mustard on the other.  As unappetizing as mayo mixed with honeymustard sounds, it is absolutetly delicious.

If you want the bread to remain "fluffy",  melt butter on the preheated pan or grill, then put the sandwich on. Melt a little more butter in the pan before turning. The bread doesn't end up soggy or dense as it sometimes does when you butter the bread before heating.

You would think that such a classic, simple sandwich would be easy to make, but it did take some experimenting to get it 'just right.'  Cooking on medium heat is definitely important (I do about 1 minute 20 seconds on each side).  And more importantly, ingredients are critical.  We normally eat whole wheat bread and use a non-butter spread.  Well, neither of these will make that classic, crispy grilled cheese sandwich.  We now use a loaf of hearty white bread and real butter, and it is wonderful.

This would be a great and easy way to make a recipe...but with a few minor adjustments.  Like another reviewer said, you could keep the pan at a low heat to melt the cheese and "grill" the bread.  Though, to quicken the process, the way my mom and I do it is by heating the bread first until both sides become a little crispy over medium/medium-high heat.  Of course, before heating, we add the butter (optional: melted) on BOTH sides.  Then once both sides have been heated, flip one slice of bread, add the cheese on top, and place the other bread without flipping.  This way, the warmer sides of the breads would touch the cheese and start the melting process sooner.  Then continue heating both sides of the sandwich until both sides have turned golden brown and the cheese has melted.  This recipe is a great treat for a snack or meal!  My family loves them!

I already knew how to make a grilled cheese sandwich, but came across this recipe as I was searching for a quick supper to use up some things I had in the fridge. It sparked my imagination, and here's what I did: Sliced and salted eggplant and while waiting for the salt to do its work, sliced the bread and prepared a salad. Rinsed, patted dry and then fried the eggplant in olive oil. Since I already had the oil in the pan, I used it instead of butter for the "grilling" and the sandwiches were composed of grated mozzarella and fried eggplant with a bit of leftover tomato pasta sauce spread on the inside of one slice of the bread. So yummy!

For an interesting twist to the average grilled cheese, try adding sliced green olives in with the cheese- makes flipping the sandwich difficult but so worth the effort!

It also tastes very good with a pinch of confectioner's sugar sprinkled on one side. Delicious!

How hard can a grilled cheese sandwich be to make? But if you want the BEST one, here's a little hint. Use mayonnaise instead of butter. On one side of the bread, spread mayonnaise and place face down on the pan, put your cheese, then put another slice of bread with mayonnaise on top of the cheese with the mayonnaise side facing up. Make sure not to use too high of heat. When one side is done, flip over and toast the other side. Your sandwich will come out a perfect, beautiful, golden brown every time. No one will know you didn't use butter, but it comes out so much better.

This is a very good recipe. Instead of frying the sandwiches, I knock out 5 or 6 of them at a time in the oven. Set to low broil and flip them over after the first side becomes golden brown. I also use 2 slices of American cheese and 1 slice of deli cut ham. A little mustard doesn't hurt either. Put the ham between the cheese slices so it melts together. You will then end up with a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.

I love grilled cheese. I also have tried various other items within my sandwiches: onions (not bad), barbecue sauce (way too sloppy), ham (good), sausage (okay). I tend to use more than one slice of cheese... Usually at least one and a half. My father's trick to ensure even cooking was to cook it on medum-low. He had a weight that he placed on top so that the bread grills evenly and perfectly. It takes longer than just blasting them on high heat, but they come out better!

You really can't go wrong with grilled cheese. My 2 year old loves "White Cheddar" cheese and it tastes great as well.

My ultimate grilled cheese sandwich is a slice of Tillamook Sharp cheddar between two slices of Dave's Killer Bread (if I didn't have Dave's, I'd use another hearty, nutty or seedy whole wheat bread).  I spread unsalted, organic butter on the outside of the slices and sprinkle them with garlic powder.  If I have any tomatoes in my garden, I will throw in a few slices.  I serve it up with some high quality tomato soup (such as Imagine fire roasted tomato bisque).  It's so easy, and so delicious.

Grilled Cheese is always great. However if you want guaranteed beautiful browned bread, use Mayonnaise, (but not Miracle Whip), in the place of butter. Also I add pickled jalapeno slices in the sandwich and sometimes cooked bacon and always salt and pepper to taste while it is in the frying pan.

Seriously, this recipe is what AllRecipes is all about—ALL recipes. Not everyone here is an expert chef looking for a new challenge. There are some people who need to know the basics. And who among us doesn't need to be reminded once in a while of something we learned long ago.

One thing I do is add sliced pickles (such as dilled hamburger pickles) between two slices of cheese-I try not to use american cheese if at all possible. Then I serve it with  mustard on the side for my kids to dip their sandwich in.

My tip for perfect grilled cheese: Spray a non-stick or cast iron skillet with Pam oil. Butter outsides with real butter and sprinkle a little grated Parmesan cheese on top of the butter before frying. Use any cheese or cheese combo you like. I use Co-Jack and Cheddar, one slice of each per sandwich. Cook on med-low for about 5-6 minutes, flip, spraying a bit more Pam into the skillet and cook an additional 5-6 minutes or until cheese is melted and outside is golden brown. The combo of butter, Parmesan and Pam (oil) makes them crispy and golden. Perfect every time!

I don't know about these people saying to use mayo instead of butter, but I can attest to using mayo IN ADDITION to butter.  Butter on the outside, mayo on the inside.  Yes, it's hardcore, and it's the only way to roll when it comes to grilled cheese.

My all-time favorite grilled cheese recipe used to be found on the Velveeta box. Called the "world-famous" grilled cheese sandwich in our house. Two slices of a good, chewy bread per sandwich (raisin bread is also a good choice), one slice of Velveeta and a sprinkling of raisins or chopped dates for each serving complete the ingredients. Spread lightly with your choice of fat (butter, margarine, mayo, etc.) and saute' until the cheese melts. Delicious!

You can't go wrong with a good old grilled cheese.  I have been using mayo instead of butter for years and it is far superior if you want a great flavorful crust quickly.  {Spread it on the bread instead of butter.}  Try it you will like it!  Enjoy your comfort food.  Smile...

I love grilled cheese, but if you are pushed for time (even though grilled cheese is really quick) hear is a quicker option.  Take a pita that pockets easily, cut it in halves or quarters, open it up carefully so it doesn't tear, and fill with your favorite cheese, then pop the halves in the toaster until the cheese melts (be sure to have the opening up so the cheese doesn't ooze into the toaster).  It tastes slightly different, (but is still a gooey deliciousness!) because it's a different bread, and I never use butter when I make it this way. Sometimes I will add tomato slices, fresh basil or parsley too to switch my sandwich up a bit.

I came across this seemingly obvious recipe and was inspired to make myself one. I used half the amount of butter asked for on each sandwich and it was way too greasy for the white bread. Maybe if I was using a less absorbent wheat bread with seeds or grains in it?

Instead of frying in butter or mayonnaise (as one person suggested) I used olive oil which is much healthier and gave a great crispy outside. I did add some mustard into it as someone suggested and it was GREAT!

For a nice crunchy version, bake this beauty in an oven at 350 until golden brown.  Gives the bread a crouton texture... I also use Gouda cheese which is a rich version of American... Yum!

I am sure there are people who are just learning to cook who find basic recipes to be exactly what they need from this site (since it is called "All Recipes", not "Fancy and Complicated Recipes"). I join the other reviewers who add sliced tomatoes in between two slices of cheddar for the "perfect" grilled cheese. It's great made with whole grain bread. And of course, there is the close cousin of grilled cheese, the Tuna Melt, made by adding some tuna salad between the cheese slices. I'd be SO fat if I could make grilled cheese and its variations every day for lunch!

If simple recipes like this weren't ever posted, my roomate wouldn't know how to feed herself. Plus, its a basic recipe....I think it's a great idea to post it. I've been making these forever ~ just taught The Boy how to make them too. My variation is to put thinly sliced tomatoes and finely chopped onions, sprinkled with salt and pepper, in between two layers of cheddar cheese. YUM. Mozzarella works well like this too. Many thanks, Sara, for posting this old favorite.

I didn't think there was any other way to make a grilled cheese. I use English muffin toasting bread, lots of Velveeta, and dip them in ketchup. Serve with Campbell's tomato soup (made with milk, not water). My favorite Sunday night supper!

This yet another classic that has always been one of my family's favorites. I love to see classic recipes that have been posted and get new ideas for them.  For this one I would love to share one of our family's added favorites.  Once grill cheese is done remove from pan and spread grape jelly over the top of it. Sounds odd but truly a must try!

when I was on WW program, I used to just put the sandwich in the toaster oven to eliminate the butter, etc..  saved me many calories....simple recipe, but always a great "go to " sandwich.

I've been using olive oil or grapeseed oil in place of butter for a healthier version and sprinkle some parmesan cheese on the bread.  (Careful though - the oil cooks much faster than butter!)  Then cook it on a George Foreman served with baked potato soup.  YUM!!  We also add slices of ham every now and then to change it up.

These taste great with a bowl of tomato soup and a pickle slice.  Even my kids make these sandwiches on their own.  We spray the pan with PAM first to prevent sticking.  No need to even measure the butter, use to your preference.

Took the advice of posted reviews and substituted light mayo for the butter.  The sandwiches turned out perfect, evenly toasted with a nice flavor.  My teenage boys didn't notice anything different, I love that it's a bit healthier!

The key to getting the perfect grilled cheese sandwich is to cook it low and slow. I cook mine on 4 (6 being med.), with a generous amount of cheese - use more than you think you'll want as the cheese tends to "disappear" into the bread if you don't use enough. Shredded will melt quicker, or if you use sliced cheddar a foil tent will help it melt quicker also, don't close it up - the steam from the butter melting will turn your bread soggy. My personal favorite variation is a thin layer of mayo on the inside, along with some fresh ground pepper and sliced pickles. For a spicier version I like to use half pepper-jack, with some sliced banana peppers or jalapenos, yummy!

Of course a classical and easy recipe, but very tasty nonetheless! :) I used rye bread and edam cheese, and it turned out a bit heavy. It could either be the bread of the amount of cheese I used!

I used shredded cheddar cheese and it melted faster, plus I was able to put the cheese closer to the edges and the corners.  It was great!

another way to make a grilled cheese a little different is to add a sandwhich meat to it like a hot ham and cheese but my personal favorite is to add bologna.

I've always had a special love for grilled cheese, but the first time my husband made it for me I fell in love all over again (with him and the sandwich) :). He always sprinkles some "season all" on before grilling. Makes all the difference. Mmm

I could hardly believe someone posted a grilled cheese sandwich on here...but I started thinking about my 18 & 20 yr old sons and how they rely on their mom to always through a grilled cheese sandwich on the skillet for them....well, this was such a great idea and so it inspired me to print this recipe out and tape it in the inside of our cupboard door for them to memorize. They can't rely on "mom" to cook everything! Also, I occassionally add some thin sliced ham to make it a little heartier for them. Thanks for posting simple recipes. They will also get this link to help them in the future....

Just a suggestion: The cheese melts better if you use a lid; it keeps the heat from escaping the pan.

Cheddar is a very oily cheese, which makes the sandwich very difficult to get through. I'm still looking for the perfect cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.

Nothing like a good old grilled cheese....but the way we always "stepped it up" was to butter both sides of the bread slices.  Throw them both on the grill and when they are browned....flip over the 1st slice and put the cheese on top...then put the grilled side of the other slice of bread right onto the cheese.  Then when the bottom is browned then flip the sandwich.  Then both sides of the bread are toasted.  Wonderful!!!

My variation, instead of bread use a flour tortilla. Don't be fooled, this is not a Quesadilla, but a mexican style grilled cheese.

All time classic! A way to improve on the taste (albeit maybe not health) is to fry bacon in the frying pan first.  Once the bacon is cooked, add it to the uncooked sandwich and then cook the sandwich in a little of the bacon grease instead of using butter.  A thin layer of mayo on the inside also boosts the taste.

Nothing beats the classics!  Old fashioned grilled cheese, and add a cup of tomato soup!  I make sure the butter gets out to all sides of the bread too.  Good to the last bite!  Still make this for my daughter and now for my 4 year old grandson!  He asks for a "Nanaw special cheese sandwich!"  Passing it down! Yum!

I was just browsing the quick recipes section, and saw this one. Instantly I felt like grilled cheese. I also found DTNYC's comment/review hilarious, but also true. Grilled cheese is so easy, and it tastes great!

Kudos to AllRecipes for publishing classic recipes like this. What a great tool for teaching my 8 year old triplets to learn to love cooking!   We used whole wheat bread just to make it a tiny bit healthier :) Add a side of tomato soup and we have a perfect lunch!!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I read the comments and i made sure that i heated it on low heat instead of medium or high. I also used 4 slices of cheese instead of 2. And instead of white bread, i used some nice italian bread. Thanks!

Pretty yummy, but it is probably easier to microwave the entire sandwich for a short time (30 sec) before grilling it.  Either that, or let cheese sit in room temperature for a while.  (I had trouble getting my cheese to melt without burning the bread.)

I always use mayo/M.Whip on the inside of my grilled cheese.  Now that I'm trying to cut back calories, I've been using an electric grill for almost all my meats.  (like a G.Foreman).  So now I also grill my cheese sandwich on it, with absolutely NO butter (or anything) on the outside.  Just be sure not to cook too long or some of the cheese may seep out as it melts.  *No butter also makes clean up a breeze!

Grilled Cheese is definitely an art.   Try aged cheddar instead of regular, and sour dough bread... if you toast the bread a little before putting it in the pan it doesn't get soggy.

I personally think that buttering the bread first make it soft ond soggy. I melt the butter in the pan first on medium to low heat being careful not to brown the butter. Then I put the sandwich in and cover for about half of the cooking time on this side. Once it's done I place the sandwich cooked side down on a paper toweled plate (soaks up excess butter) then repeat on the other side. Some times I even go so far as to cool the pan back down a bit just to get the butter right. I also use real block cheddar cheese not the american rubber cheese.

I love these!  These exact ones with cheese singles are the best, but then it is always great to add a little change and maybe do a slice of cheddar and a slide of like white American or some other kind of cheese.

Yes, a classic! Try aeasoning ANY cheese sandwich (sarmie in SA)with normal salt & white pepper! Also try adding a few asparagus shoots between 2 slices of cheese on rye and simply place it in the micro on high for a few seconds at a time until done! Delicious....and healthy!

I always used cooking spray on the back of my grilled cheese and for some ridiculous reason it would always burn. I started using this recipe and they come out perfectly brown and nice and gooey in no time. I actually this week made a tomato soup and grilled cheese night just because I found this recipe.

My 2 favorite variations of this classic sandwich are:   1.Rye bread, two classic kraft american singles and thinly sliced tomato, grilled with a generous amount of Plugra butter.  2. Whtie bread, boars head monterey jack cheese with jalepeno and thinly sliced tomato, browned to perfection with plugra butter (gold package)  Delicious!

I love grilled cheese (who doesn't?) but since I ate it as a kid I've developed an overpowering "health freak" attitude toward food. I used nonfat cheddar, whole wheat bread, and olive oil instead of butter. While healthy, the sandwich really wasn't the grilled cheese I was craving! Next time I'll add a thin slice of tomato like one of the other reviewers suggested, and see if I can't conjure up a few more veggies or spices to make it tastier. Three stars 'cause I can't bring myself to give anything as loaded with fat as this recipe is more than that.

Grilled cheese is the best! I make grilled cheese on french bread - the presliced kind that is sliced about 1/4" and use the wrapped kraft slices.

Good with or without tomato soup, but if you have the soup try the Progresso Tomato Basil (smooth) and add a bunch of milk to it to cream it up..great with grilled cheese. Good luck!

You can't beat a grilled cheese sandwich
The only thing I can add to other great suggestions is if you need to make a bunch for hungry kids you can do them in the oven on a cookie sheet.  I have done them with and without butter depending if you want to lower the fat.  You have to turn them to toast on both sides.

This is my first review, although I have enjoyed many recipes on this site. Koodo's for the posting. I too, know how to make a grill cheese, but to find it as a recipe, first gave me a chuckle then I could not stop reading the reviews & will try experimenting some of the variations that sound awesome. Thanks for a recipe that is almost as good as snuggling up to a cozy fire with a good book. Memories have been made for decades from this great GCS.....Thanks again

This is a good recipe to add your own comment, so here is a tip... I am a big cheese lover and always try to use good quality cheese along with some garlic powder and other spices when making grilled cheese. However not all cheese melts as easily as others, so I cover the pan with a lid while it cooks (ON LOW) so that it does not burn and cheese gets very melted! Great recipe!

Glad to see the basics.  My variation is to combine cheddar & american cheese.  Have made with cream cheese & thin slices of leftover roast beef.

Perfect basic recipe - it's exactly what it's supposed to be!  Just make sure you grill on a temperature that's closer to low than medium....the cheese needs to melt AND the bread has to toast (not burn).

I agree with one reviewer who stated that any grilled cheese deserves 5 stars!!  My variations include adding a thin slice of tomato to mine and my husband has me add sliced jalapenos to his!!

Hey it's not that easy to make the perfect grilled cheese.  It's all in the heat and a cast iron griddle is the only way to go.  Try extra sharp chedder too.  I love it that someone posted this.

Okay, okay, I admit I've never made grilled cheese sandwiches in my life (my mom always makes me it), even though I've made more complicated recipes than that and they've turned out! :) So, I needed a recipe. This was beyond easy and I served it to my brother and dad, who gobbled down the calories like there was no tommorrow! Very yummy recipe and good with lots of ketchup! :)

The classics are the best :)  But I couldn't believe that no one mentioned adding ham!  Leftover or sliced taste wonderful with the cheese.  Also, I've heard that you can put a bowl over the sandwich while it's heating in the pan to make sure that the cheese melts, but I just top one side with cheese and stick it in the microwave :)

I laughed to that this would be added, but like others here is my variation...On your bread of choice add about an 1/8 the butter you normally would use. In the skillet heat a garlic infused olive oil. Yum! I use one slice of cheddar and one slice swiss, but my husband like pepper-jack and cheddar. I made it for my sister over thanksgiving and when the family got back together for x-mas she said she couldn't wait for me to make her one, which I then did immediately!

Funny to find this recipe! I love that it's here. I need to send this to my sis who makes her grilled cheese sandwiches by putting her bread in the toaster and then slapping a piece of cheese between the slices!  My variations are similar to some of the others  - on the buttered side I sprinkle garlic salt or garlic powder, parsley, parmesan cheese. Sometimes I add some ham. This makes a good breakfast sandwich, too -- sausage patties, semi-hard fried egg and cheese.  i've also grilled peanut butter and jelly. Mmmmm.... warm, gooey peanut butter. Yum.

I love that there is actually a recipe for grilled cheese, as if no one has made it before! But, as mentioned, definitely a good place to post variations. What I do is sprinkle a good amount of garlic salt on the butter and on the cheese. Mmmmm. I generally use some sort of cheddar. I've made it with jalepeno havarti, too! SO. GOOD.

I do soooo love grilled cheese sammiches, and so do my roomies. Their eyes always light up when I tell them I'm making my version.     It varies slightly, dependant on what I pick up at the store, but normally it's rye or sourdough bread, cheddar/colby/havarti (sometimes mixing it up), thinly sliced tomatoes, and a bit of mayo, oregano, salt and pepper inside. I've even been known to toss in some black forest ham, or a touch of pastrami. The key is taking your time. Put some love into that grilled cheese, and cook it patiently.

Try adding a little onion for variety.  I dice about half a large onion and then put it in a small bowl with a teaspoon of water, and a dash of season salt and microwave the onions for 1 minute.  This will soften the onions a bit so they aren't so crunchy.  Drain the water and then spread a light layer of the onoins on top of the cheese before cooking.  It's very yummy and even my kids request it over the plain kind.  Hope you enjoy!

One of my childhood memories of a grilled cheese is the fact that my Dad sprinkled garlic powder on the butter sides of the bread before placing them in the skillet. I make the sandwiches the same way for my family - my husband won't eat them any other way now.

My sister-in-law makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever.  Simple stuff - white bread, butter, pre-sliced american cheese....  I think the secret is the lower heat (as others have stated) and she covers the pan.

Since everyone's adding suggestions, here's one:  want to make it "gourmet"?  Use harvarti cheese (or harvarti dill) with thinly sliced tomatoes - it's THE BEST.  It's also easier to just melt the butter in the pan, that spread it on the bread if you don't already have some softened butter.

What's better than a grilled cheese sandwich, or as I called them when I was a child a cheese toastie!! Wonderful, I ate them as a kid and I make them for my kids. I always use sargento deli sliced colb. and mont. jack cheese slices. Keep the heat low so they don't get burned. Just have patience.

Thanks for this recipe. It was great and easy to make. I used whole wheat bread and light Cheddar cheese with two slices of tomato with a pinch of freshly ground pepper. It was yummy. Thanks again.

Fantastic! I always either burnt the bread or didn't have the cheese melt all the way, so now I put it in the microwave for 10 seconds or so before grilling so I don't have to worry about the cheese as much.  When I was little I used to love this with pepperoni (sliced in half! other wise you'll bite down and end up eating all the cheese) and mustard. Though, now that I'm a little older and am trying to eat better, i've found just mustard does the trick.

I didn't realize a recipe was needed for a grilled cheese, however, I think it's great to find such a basic recipe. I just finished having a grilled cheese for lunch. I used sharp cheddar that I sliced myself; Yummy!

I know most of you think this is funny, but I had never done GC and tried for the first time yesterday eve, following faithfully this recipe... so this is a great lesson for us all: never take anything for granted, and remember there's so much out there we can share, as it turned out that everyone does it in a slightly different way:-) thank you all!

You simply can't not rate your basic cheddar grilled cheese 5 stars.  It is pure and simple perfection!  And it always turns out good ;P

Like others, I occasionally use different cheeses like provalone or mozzerella. My husband also likes to put garlic powder on the butter before you fry it!

This is an excellent way to make a basic grilled cheese.  We eat a lot of these. Its a staple meal in our family, with soup, canned if we are low on money.  When we can afford it, we upgrade the bread and the cheese, also upgrade to homemade soup.  My favorite way is to use swiss cheese, sourdough or wheat bread, and add some crushed red pepper on top of the cheese.   MMMMMMM!

Thank you! Some may think this recipe is in our dna but I have been trying for some time to replicate my mother's grilled cheese to no avail.  Most of my efforts started by toasting the bread in a toaster - hah, now I see how dumb that was! Now I can enjoy just like I did as a child.

growing up we always had this made with American cheese... I keep to that tradition, but I mix it up a little - I do one slice american and one slice pepper jack, I brush a little olive oil instead of butter (no saturated fats) and serve with Tomato Basil Soup

I made mine with a mixture of butter and mayo to spread on the bread and used shredded cheddar cheese. Also took the liberty to add some halved black olives ( pitted canned olives) - the cheese olive combo was good. This together with some left over bruschettas and portobello mushroom soup made for a simple yet tasty dinner! Hubby loved it!

I prefer 1 slice of cheese to 2. Also using hazelnut bread instead of regular makes it crunchier.

Great explanation of what we sometimes forget that some don't know. For a different flavor add a slice of bread and butter pickle on the cheese. The pickles that are sliced for sandwiches.  Delish

For a nice change, I sometimes use flour tortillas instead of bread.  With the tortillas, the butter is really not necessary.  My grandchildren eat this great lunch both ways...either bread or tortillas...and love it.  I highly recommend this recipe to other grandmothers who are trying to find things that the kids will eat and enjoy.

Like another member, I also love my grilled cheese sandwiches with super thin slivers of onion, preferably red onion.  And, of course, being Canadian I love my grilled cheese with some homemade mayonnaise.  It's sooooo good!

we love grilled cheese in our house.  recently my daughter's best friend made her one and added pepperoni slices to it.  i'm not a huge pepperoni fan, but OMG - it is awesome.  i just make it the traditional way - butter two slices of bread, use 2 slices of american cheese and add 9 slices of pepperoni and cook on medium heat for about 50-60 seconds per side

I love this recipe! So cool to read everybody's spin on this sandwich. I used millet bread, but you could use wheat or french bread etc,, Put mayo, thin sliced tomato, cooked bacon and horseradish cheddar with a pickle slice on the side. If I wanna be REALLY bad I'll whip up an egg and some milk and dip the sandwich in it before I grill it. YUM!!

I love grilled cheese, & yes I already knew how to make it. But like a lot of people I really enjoyed reading people's different variations & additions. I really liked adding "a thick slice of sharp cheddar cheese " and basil and oregano. Very good!

this is wonderful and I agree, you should cook on low heat. i just did one with high heat and had to turn down the heat so my sandwich would not be burnt. i think this recipe words well with whole wheat or white wheat -- it's simply delicious!

Thanks for laying the steps out ;) I've never made grilled cheese before, and it went really well. The cheddar made for a rich-tasting sandwich. Just make sure you let the butter sit out for a while before trying to put it on bread-otherwise, it will be too cold and will tear the bread :P

I used swiss cheese and toasted the sandwich, omitting the need for butter.  Technically not a 'grilled' cheese then, but it was equally yummers in my opinion :) especially when dipped in honey mustard sauce...oh yeah

you can't go wrong with a classic!  I grew up having dill pickle and mayo in with my cheese and still having it fried with butter! It was on whole wheat granola bread so that must make it "Healthy".  I like to make mine with pepperjack cheese! Ole!

Try using spicy Pepper Jack cheese with a little honey on the inside. So yummy. I've used all types of cheeses with all sorts of jelly, too. Swiss with strawberry jam is a nice combo. Don't knock it til you try it.

5 stars because grilled cheese sandwiches ARE the best! Why? Because they're so easy to make, and so delicious! Plus you can use cookie cutters to make fun shapes out of them. If you're on a diet, use healthier bread and omit the butter but use a little bit of mayo like the other reviewer said. ALSO, the heat is very important when cooking a grilled cheese sandwich. I would only suggest cooking it on medium heat in order to perfect it. Don't forget the pepper too!

A timeless classic.  One tip I learned along the way -- a book recommended shredding the cheese(s), instead of slicing. You get a better melt. Not necessary, but a thoughtful suggestion.

I'm with another reviewer laughing at the fact there is actually a grilled cheese recipe!!  Actually, with that aside,  to switch things up a bit instead of butter use mayo.  It gives it a great zip...even layer some ham in there.

I think we can all agree that grilled cheese is wonderful. However, I am finding myself LOL at all the people that have commented on GRILLED CHEESE!!! This really is along the lines of "how to boil water" and "how to bake a potato".

Thanks for the laugh...I needed it.

How can you go wrong with grilled cheese? I seem to like landolake white cheese better than cheddar.  Adding thin slices of tomatoes makes this classic dish even more delicious.

Ahhh, yes ~ like so many said *back to the basics*! I can't think of a better recipe! There's always someone out there that is *just starting out* and this recipe is perfect! :o) I don't eat Grilled Cheese Sandwiches now but I did as a child. Ahhh, the memories, LOL. I do make them for my girls now, though! Anyway, I just wanted to add my rating here since this is such a great *classic*! :o)

This recipe makes me chuckle. I thought to myself , seriously ?
 I do remember trying to make grilled cheese as a kid and having no clue as to what to do so I suppose some would need a recipe or method to follow.  Grilled cheese is the best sandwich in the world.  White bread, butter and American cheese is the bomb. Nothing makes a better sandwich.

Being from WI & a cheesehead, grill cheese will always get the big 5 stars if I'm asked. This is how to make a grill cheese sandwich! YUM! Using many differant kinds of cheese also helps make a great sandwich too! Good soaked in tomato soup! Enjoy :-)

If you ask me, grilled cheese tastes best when it's made with white bread. I use Texas toast and Velveeta. I also sprinkle a little bit of garlic powder on it and sometimes add dill pickle slices.
Yum!

A Classic for sure. No matter what else you add, be it mustard, ham, whatever, a true grilled cheeze sandwich must be served with a healthy dollop of Heinz Ketchup alongside to dip each bite into before eating!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!! They're easy to make and utterly delicious! I would suggest using unsalted butter though as I used salted butter and yielded toasts that are a lil too salty.

I like to use Arnold Health Nut bread for crunchiness, 
1.5 slices of Velveeta for creaminess, 4 slices of cooked bacon for saltiness, and lots of sliced tomato for a touch of sweetness.  I really enjoy reading everyone's variations!  Gonna have to make one tomorrow.

This has been a favorite in our house for years and this is the easiest and best method of preparing these cheesy sandwiches.  Often, I will use a processed cheese such as Velveeta instead of the cheddar cheese because it melts so beautifully.

I searched for grilled cheese to find the different types of cheese people use and found this classic. It is exactly like mom used to make.  She always used cast iron skillet which seems to add just the right amount of nostalgia for me, even if adding nothing to taste. The only change I make is that I melt butter in the pan rather than buttering the bread itself, and I swirl the pan occasionally as it cooks, it seems to more evenly distribute the butter (pre-melting) and toast the bread more evenly (the swirl), you do have to melt the butter for the other side in the pan in the middle of the flip.  Also you need to cook on lower temperature or the butter with brown too much before the cheese melts enough, so it takes a little longer to cook. My Mom used to move it back and forth in the pan with her hand every few seconds or so. I guess the cast iron was too heavy to “shimmy-shake” © Rachel Ray. Any way thanks for this classic.

I was as surprised as many others to see this "recipe" here, but I'm really glad I read through some reviews to get new and different ideas!  For example, I never thought of using mayonnaise instead of butter.  Looking forward to trying that.

This is how I make my grilled cheese, but I cover the pan so I can grill on a low heat but not lose the heat or dry out the bread.  I also usually butter the inside of the bread as well, and sprinkle some garlic powder over that, then lay slices of tomato over the cheese, inside the sandwich.

Can you believe this recipe has been on AR for 6 years and people are still actively commenting on it?  It's wonderful! I personally never knew how to make a GC: I had to order it from delis to enjoy this favorite of mine.  Thank you for the posting!  I can't wait to try out the variations listed here.  We beginners need all the help we can get!  (Where is that "how to boil water" recipe, btw?) ;-)

I have made this recipe a hundred times yet, only found it on the site today.  An oldie but a goody.  Even though every kid in Home Ec makes it, it's still worth posting and rating.  Cheers for the good ol' standbys.  :o)

thank you for adding this recipe.  it was exactly what i was looking for.  i didn't learn to cook the conventional way with the easiest stuff first and so on.  i can make just about anything and make it well, but i had never made grilled cheese before.  thanks from those of us who are definitely not beginners...we just haven't gotten to some of the basic stuff yet.

I am assuming no one actually needed a recipe for grilled cheese...but I melt the butter in the pan first toast one side of the sandwich, add more butter, flip and toast the other side.  No more ripped bread.  I am known for my superior grilled cheese sandwiches.  Also a pie iron over a campfire makes a killer grilled cheese!

LOLOLOL!  For those of you who think it is so hysterical that so many people are interested in a written recipe for grilled cheese sandwich, I have a question. 
WHY ARE YOU HERE???  OMG, too funny!  I'm here because I thought after all these years I might be missing out on how to make an awesome GC sand. and boy am I did.  So many great suggestions!  Let's all keep on cooking, experimenting, sharing and laughing!  Great for all of us and our loved ones.  Peace, Elizabeth

Actually this was my everyday dinner for about 10 years but my mom didn't Use butter . Anyway It's better with the butter but for weight watchers It won't make a big difference if you didn't use it and of course You can replace the white bread with the brown one.

I just made this the other night for the family :-) always a pleaser! I usually use 2 slices of kraft singles when I make grilled cheese and never have the heat higher than medium, what a quick and delicious meal! Don't forget the tomato soup!

Of course this seems kind of easy, but I had a friend recently that didn't know you were supposed to use butter on the bread!  This is still my favorite meal, no matter how old I am.  In fact, I am serving mini grilled cheese in tomato soup shooters for my cocktail hour at my wedding.  Never underestimate what people don't know about cooking!  I had to look up how to boil an egg a few years ago!

Try mozzerella cheese with some fresh basil leaves or pesto on the inside. YUM!! I love that this recipe is on here, made me laugh that it was in the top 20 dinners :) How true in my book! *I also agree these need to be fried on low to get the perfect golden crispy brown. I usually put one slice in the pan, cover with cheese, and put the lid on for a few minutes to make sure the cheese melts to my liking, then top with the other slice and flip. Perfect every time!

So simple, yet never perfect until this recipe. The key is SLOW browning on a low setting. I've tried colby jack and pepper jack...both winners in my house!

*smiles*  Reading all these reviews... GC Sammies have a zillion ways to twist 'em.  Add in lunch / Deli meats (Ham's a favorite 'round here).  2 Kraft American Singles per sandwich.  Muenster is always amazing, too.  Come Halloween time, cut a fun pumpkin face into the bread - or use any of your cookie cutters for shaped mini-sammies.  Finally:  leealli - EXACTLY!  Grilled PB&J's are where it's at!!

So delicious! I tried this with plain cheddar, cheddar and swiss, and velveeta. I liked the velveeta best but my son liked the swiss/cheddar combo. I served these with a bowl of tomato soup, mmmm mmmm good! I did use a little more margarine than it called for.

I have laughed so hard over this until my cheeks hurt!!  But seriously, yall are all right, this is the most awesomeist beginners recipe out there.  Its the first thing I taught my son to cook.  BUT, my two cents is this, back when I was kid and hung out at my sister's house, her husband would cook us his version of Grilled Ham and Cheese.  Here's how, Two slices of fresh white bread, few slices of thinly sliced ham and cheddar cheese.  ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BREAD, spread butter and sprinkle with garlic salt.  ON THE INSIDE, add whole grain mustard on the HAM side.  ON THE CHEESE SIDE INSIDE, add a small smear of mayo.  Grill on MED LOW heat until goldenly toasted.  Ohh and dont forget the side bowl of tomato soup.  Ya gotta dip it in tomato soup, its just like a MUST DO!  (Im still crackin up over this...LOLOL)

I know the secret to the most finger-licking good grilled cheese you'll ever have.  I make it the same way as suggested here--real cheddar, nice quality white bread...but the flavor starts with mayonaisse...hear me out on this one!!  I hate mayonaisse with a passion and even substitute honey mustard in my tuna salads!  However, putting a very light coat of mayo on the outside of your grilled cheese sandwich makes it grill up beautifully and gives it such a nice flavor that I now keep mayo in the house just for this purpose.  For cooking, I use a non-stick spray or the lightest coat of butter instead of the 3 tblps suggested.  It's not the most figure friendly sandwich, of course, but nothing beats grilled cheese made this way with a little Frank's red hot as a dipping sauce on a rainy day.  Give it a try whether you like mayo or hate it--you might be surprised!

Go to a grocery store with an instore bakery.  Most of them make some kind of artisan bread.  Buy that bread and slice for the sandwiches.  Use slices of a nice smoked sharp cheddar or smoked Gouda or whatever kind of cheese you like.  Now follow the recipe.  When done, serve these with hot tomato soup.  Now that's pretty close to heaven.

I think it's great to put recipes like this here, why not? I have to add my way: I melt the butter in the pan first, then put a slice of wheat bread in it. Tope with muenster cheese, thinly sliced ham, and another slice of meunster. Finally, put the other buttered slice of wheat on top. Cook over low heat so that the cheese gets all gooey....THIS is my favorite, served with dill pickle, oilves, and potato salad.

I live in Scotland & we hear references to grilled cheese sandwiches on american tv shows all the time but I would never have known this was how it was made, when the word grilled is used I would always assume it is under a grill in the oven, so a recipe for this was a necessity for me, surely that deserves 5 stars alone? I had mature cheddar cheese & hubby had cheese & salami & quite frankly they rocked! I served with gherkins, coleslaw & crisps.

Grilled Cheese is one of my family's favorite lunches.  To add a bit more interest and flavor, I like to use colby jack and mozzarella cheese, add a tomato, and sprinkle the buttered sides of the bread with garlic salt.  Yum!

Some people are commenting that "who needs instruction on how to grill cheese?" but fail to note that this is a classic north american recipe. My Polish parents have never had grilled cheese, and the first time I ever had it, a roomie made it for me in university. And then I was hooked. I wish I had discovered this page before then, I missed out on years of deliciousness!

So simple, so easy, so perfect. This recipe nailed the art of making a grilled cheese in a non-stick pan.

I love that someone actually put this recipe up! I  never would have thought of it. My favorite way to eat grill cheese growing up was with American cheese,  mayo and sweet pickles thinly sliced and tomato soup. Thanks Mom

This is how mom taught me to make them when I was younger. Only now, to reduce fat, etc. I use the Smart Balance spray on butter and lightly salt each side, with a salt substitute and whole grain bread. Grilled cheese is a classic and need not be improved upon. Everyone has their bread and cheese choices, but nothing really needs to be added to this. Leave simple as simple.

Obviously most of us know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich. This is just the place to get new tips and variations on it. I personaly like to use American cheese with thin salami. Also I like cheese with thin turkey and few dabs of hot sauce. Im going to try it with mayo. I was just too hungry for lunch today..just in case I didnt like it.

I love this recipe also.  I keep my grilled cheese sandwiches very simple.  I do like them crispy.  I toast both pieces of my bread before I butter it and put it in the pan to grill and melt the cheese.  It cooks faster, medium heat is okay, cheese melts and the sandwich does not burn.

I invited some friends over and made this recipe. I added thinly sliced tomatoes and a bit of thinly sliced yellow onions. It turned out great! My swedish friends kept saying 'Det är jatte gott!' (this is very good!).It was so easy to make and delicious! Thank you!

Simply a classic and always a favorite. I usually add some green chilies or jalapenos to it and really spice it up. Also, sometime my bread is toasting faster than the cheese is melting. To speed up the melting, just cover the pan with a lid or another pan--the steam melts the cheese perfectly.

ADD GARLIC!!!  Grilled cheeses are SO much better with just the tiniest sprinkle of garlic on each side of the bread while its cooking.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with it.

Being a student studying abroad really requires alot of time and devotion, especially  when you’re a bachelor. This meal came in so handy at times that it’s seriously underrated. Amazing how bread, cheese, and butter can accumulate together to form such a mouth watering dish. Although the sandwich tastes amazing without any alterations, I would recommend adding a few slices of tomatoes, and a pinch of hot sauce to give it a little flare.Add a bag of chips to the dish and your good to go. I would totally recommend this sandwich if you’re a busy individual with little time on your hands. And I would defiantly recommend every guy out there to try it. Enjoy.

My husband and I love to have grilled cheese for lunch. One thing that I do to make it more filling is I will also but some lunch meat such as turkey with the cheese. It's a little harder to flip but the end result is worth it!

yeah, i had to laugh a little too...but i suppose there are some people just learning to cook who had no idea. here is how i doctor em up, first, use 2 slices of cheese, try some deli meat in the middle, roast beef or ham is good. also tuna is good. i like crumbled nacho cheese doritos too & of course bacon goes well with any combo. now about boiling that water, i allways........

Certainly a classic.  For flair, I like to add a layer of sliced pepperoni (as you'd see on pepperoni pizza).

LOL - I'm laughing because I can't believe this is even on here, but I'm glad that it is! When I started cooking I didn't even know how to boil eggs properly, so I'm glad to see something as simple and common as the grilled cheese is listed here.
And yes, this is THE way to make a grilled cheese sandwich. If you don't have butter, mayo or margarine is fine. Also, I prefer 2 slices of cheese, and sometimes add some sauteed mushrooms. Also, try White American cheese for a change. Yummy! :)

My mom always added a slice of tomato and a sprinkle of oregano inside.  Rye bread or Portugese bread are good, too.  And, two slices of cheese are a must!

As a non-American I never knew that this is how to make grilled cheese sandwiches. We do eat grilled cheese but never spread anything on the outside. I tried this with mayo and used our panini press and it turned out great. Thanks for posting it!

There's NOTHING better than grilled cheese!  My preference is to use any good quality bread, some combination of cheddar, swiss, provolone and muenster cheese.  Muenster and swiss go really well on rye.  Also, I use real butter whenever possible.  It adds a richness of flavor and seems to get more crisp than margarine.  I'm really anxious to try the egg batter idea, though! (Fat? Bah!) :)

I changed this recipe, so I don't know if I should give it 5 stars, however, the method deserves 5 stars.  I took some advice from previous reviewers which made this seemingly simple sandwich into a fantastic and quick snack!  I spread a minimal amount of light mayo on the bread instead of the butter.  One slice of sharp cheddar cheese and one slice of good ol' ham out out of the meat drawer from the fridge.  Did the method as directed but covered to ensure the cheese melted.  After sandwich was done (all of 5 minutes if that), added some seasoned salt and pepper and chowed down!  Thanks for the recipe and advice from you reviewers.  Sometimes the simple recipes are the best.

Of course-the classic grilled cheese sandwich- a true classic in my book. So creamy and delicious, I love this sandwich. It is perfect for a rainy day with some tomato  soup for dipping. Excellent recipe, and easy to remember. I use 2 slices of cheddar cheese for each sandwich, do this if you like it really cheesy!

American cheese is our favorite. To save on calories use butter flavored Pam spray. This is comfort food at its best. This plus tomato soup is great comfort food.

Everyone's a critic or comic.  Even the most basic grilled cheese garners critical reviews simply because it might be as basic as boiling water. However there are many good reasons for the basic recipes to be included on this site including the reason I use them - menu planning and also for those who are just learning how to cook. Grilled cheese sandwiches were the very first thing I ever made for what would be my future husband 40 some odd years ago. I burned them.  Because no one had taught me how to make them properly. He married me anyway, go figure! These basic recipes DO serve a purpose and I appreciate those that post them. Thank you.

I love grilled cheese! There are TONS of variations you could do. Add a slice or two of tomato with a smidgen of salt and pepper. Add mustard and honey, along with some Canadian bacon. (One of my faves.)

Like a lot of other people, I just had to write something.  I've started using specialty cheese for our grilled cheese.  Blueberry Cheddar is awesome and the kids love it for breakfast.  Taco Jack, Smoked Bacon Cheddar, Apple or Cranberry.  For some extra kick we also love Pepper Jack and Habanero Jack.

I love grilled cheese but haven't need a recipe for since I was 7....It's amazing to me that someone actually needs this. I personally love to switch up the bread cheese combo and I always have ketchup to dip in! Never fails even if I burn it.....Fry a slice of bologna before adding it in and it will be like eating a chunk of heaven.

I am always trying to get my children to eat their veggies (without prevail) and have learned that if I chop up broccoli very fine and add it to the cheese in the sandwich, they eat it and ask for seconds! Great way to "hide" their veggies in a kid-friendly food!

Who doesn't love a grilled cheese sandwich?! I like to add mayo on the inside slices and 2 pieces of thinly sliced turkey (although I'm sure any deli meat would be good). Make sure you cook on low-medium heat that way the bread will toast and the cheese will melt.

Very basic recipe. Bit of advice, sour dough bread goes great with cheddar cheese, and make sure to use low heat, this ensures that the cheese melts but that the bread does not burn.

My mother-in-law once invited us over for lunch, made us grilled cheese sandwiches...and forgot to put the cheese in.  Perhaps if she had a written recipe in front of her it would have been different??? Anyway, this is a quick, easy, comfort food meal and extremely versatile - my favorite is provolone on sundried tomato and basil bread....yum!

Believe it or not, there are people in this world who can't make a grilled cheese sandwich.  Note the heat should be medium, or maybe even medium-low.  Slow cook to allow the cheese time to melt without burning the bread.  Also note it's sliced cheese.  My son has *maybe* come close to perfecting keeping grated cheese between the slices of bread, but I'd like to debate that.  At least I don't have to clean the pan after him anymore.  That's about the only good thing I can think of regarding kids growing up and leaving!

Gotta tell ya....this is my comfort food. My husband makes the best and he uses 100% whole wheat bread, I can't believe it's not butter spray and velveeta.

I can use the same ingredients and mine doesn't taste like his. He makes it with love...usually when I need comforted.  Good with chicken noodle soup when you have the stuffies :)

My two cents - I use a combination of American and Provolone.  I really like the flavor of the American and the stretchiness of the Provolone.  And if I ever decide to add chicken or ham, I grill it on the pan for a minute or two to take the chill off and promote the melting of the cheese.

My tip: try mustard on this sandwich, along with extra-sharp Cheddar cheese. It adds a lovely tanginess that complements the buttery, toasty crust. You can cook this sandwich on a George Foreman grill, too. It toasts faster, and the cheese inside melts beautifully.

All that's missing from this classic recipe is a bit of mayo!  Spread some on before you add the cheese.

How can you not love grilled cheese? Nice toasty buttery bread with melty gooey cheese! I make a variation of this. 4 slices of cheese per sandwich, two lorraine swiss and 2 deli american. I margerine one side of each slice of regular old white bread and then sprinkle lightly with garlic salt. I cook over low heat until the cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown. It gets crispy using low heat and gives the cheese a chance to melt.

I make mine this way as well.  Cast-Iron has the perfect grill cheese skillet it is small and squared and fits one sandwich perfectly!  I dunk my sandwich in ranch spiked with tabasco.

Thought I'd add one that's only kindof a variation.  I don't butter the bread, but the pan (just a little quicker than buttering the bread since the pan is hot).  I use mexican velveeta so it gives it a little bit of spice, or I use pepper jack cheese, depends on mood really.  As soon as I put the bread in the pan I spin it around so that the bread soaks up the butter evenly and cooks right.  When you flip it, put a little more butter down, set the sandwich in the pan, spin it again and you're good to go.

Thanx to recipes like these, my 23 yr old 'little' sister can feed herself something other than soup from a can! I forward these to her, as well as adding them to my 7 yr old daughter's 'cookbook'. Thank-goodness for such basic recipes included on this web-site!

To make a GREAT sandwich awesome, just sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on the buttered bread before putting into the skillet. WOW, what an upgrade in flavor. I got the idea from Marie Callendar's "Frisco burger", which they do using sour dough bread for their burgers.

We had this last night with Mrs. Grass' Noodle Soup (or store brand).    It was fit for a king--so good.    Why are some making fun of a simple recipe?    A little humility is needed.

Grilled Cheese Sandwich Haiku: "My daughter made this, part of mini 'chef lessons', I'm so proud of her!" My 7-year old took a summer afternoon, devoid of any activities or plans, and asked me to pull up recipes that she could try out on her own. This was her lunch and I let her loose in the kitchen. How could a simple and classic grilled cheese sandwich be any less than 5 stars? Some of the joke reviews gave me the giggles, but some of the more snarky ones -- well, c'mon, we all have to start somewhere; i.e how to make baked potato, scramble eggs, make Ramen ... She declared it the most delicious sandwich she ever had, and she followed the recipe as it's written except using honey wheat bread instead of white.

This recipe is basic and very good, but I also like to spread a bit of deli mustard on my bread before adding the cheese. It adds a flavorful punch to the grilled cheese sandwich and makes it OUTSTANDING, in my opinion...but only if you like mustard to begin with. I actually got the idea from a Stephen King novel like 15 years ago and I've been doing it ever since.

I already know I'd love this recipe before trying it.  I usually make it with american cheese.  Keep it on ow to let the cheese melt and it tastes amazing.  It's strange how the grilled cheese each person makes can be completely different even though its the same food.

Good, old fashioned grilled cheese.  I lightly.. very lightly, smear French's mustard on the inside of one of the slices of bread and it really adds a nice flavor.  Two slices of cheese too.

You can't go wrong with grilled cheese!  (Unless you have the pan heat too high!)  I love to add thin slices of fresh from the garden tomatoes, absolutely the best comfort food.

Everyone loves grilled cheese, and I read all the reviews.  It's an amazing sandwich when I use a little mayo on the outside, and a little pesto on the inside and some garlic salt before cooking in the pan.  What an amazing gourmet treat to serve with tomato soup.  Of course, this ia another recipe alltogether, but thanks for reminding me about grilled cheese.  I'd gone so gourmet lately, I'd forgotten about this simple comfort food.

Sometimes I add a bit of pesto sauce for some yummy kick.  Surprisingly, it still works well with American cheese.  For those looking for a spectacularly melty cheese experience, use velveeta pre-sliced american cheese.  it's incredible.

This is a staple in the winter months at our house.  I like to butter the pan lightly and then add the wheat bread.  Adding sliced tomatoes or bacon bits is nice too.

To make any grilled cheese truly gormet is to use sourdough bread.  Also butter both sides of each piece... and a good quality medium or sharp cheddar.  Pepper Jack also makes incredible grilled cheese.

I used Natures Own Honey 7 grain bread and promise spread with cracker barrel sharp cheddar cheese. The bread has real grain embedded in it, and the texture and taste was awesome with the cheese. I put 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. My hubby loved it so much he had three! Easy and tasty, it doesn't get any better than that.

I will add my variation to this too... I butter and pam spray the pan, and I fry some taylor ham or bacon and add it to the sandwich.  Delicious!  I also make it without the taylor ham/bacon and make my son his "toast cheese samwich"

My favorite sandwich. But my family likes it best with either egg bread or caraway rye bread. Sometimes when we're really hungry, we make it with two slices of cheese and bacon in between.

Add a cup of tomato soup on the side and it doesn't get any easier...or better. Also, sometimes I spray my bread with non stick spray instead of butter.

Well, at least I know that I am not the only one who needs basic info!  I didn't need THIS one, but found the other review opinions interesting!  A suggestion - use a little olive oil instead of margarine for a richer flavor and nice color. Also experiement and add whatever you like with cheese to this - it all grills up great.  If you use Velveeta (any brand), it will melt better and "glue" your sandwich ingredients together.  Happy grilling!

I have I  a couple of tips ...
1) try using a bit of mayo instead of butter.  You get the same crisp without the oily.
And 
2) soft or whipped cream cheese instead of sliced cheese,  you WON’T regret it!

You cant go wrong with grilled cheese. I think sour dough bread and cheddar are the best but most combos are good!  The old commentary on this “recipe” was my favorite part. I hope everyone knows by now that butter (real butter) is not fattening and that the only fattening part of a grilled cheese is the bread. Fat doesn’t make you fat sweeties, it’s the processed refined carbohydrates that do. But everyone loves a comfort food every now and then!!

I rarely write a review, (I think I have done it once!) but feel compelled to comment for numerous reasons.
I am planning to make this tomorrow, and, it is how I typically make my grilled cheese, but I wanted to applaud those who made favorable comments.  I must admit, I sometimes feel frustrated when someone completely changes a recipe, then rates the original, instead of providing their own recipe to the site.  However, in this case, I found it endearing that some really are trying to learn, and, without a hands on teacher, sometimes simple recipes are beyond their skill level.  Haven't we all been there?  Give us a break, those of you who are sarcastic and offer a 1-star rating (you know who you are!).  You may never have had to learn, perhaps....you came out of the womb knowing how to cook. Not very kind of you.
 I recently learned the tip about using mayo on the bread instead of butter.  I like it! Most of us love grilled cheese with tomato soup.  I looked today for "What to serve with Split Pea soup?", and it was suggested to serve with grilled cheese croutons.  I am going to make plain old grilled cheese, and my book group will be very happy with the Split Pea soup and Butternut Squash soup by Chef John from this site.  If you have not tried this soup, it is delicious!  Thanks! All Recipes!  I am an experienced cook, and a pretty good one, I'm told, but you are my "go-to site when I need a recipe, as most of your recipes are simple to understand, and call for ingre

I tried marble cheese which wasn't that great so I will try cheddar next time. I also have to put less butter on the bread next time. Other than my mistakes, this was great and I will make again.

I love grilled cheeses they're my favorite. Everytime I go to restauraunts ( that have grilled cheese) I will order it. I order 2 just in case I'm really hungry. Besides homemade is better because I don't need to go to restauraunts and buy grilled cheeses. But I never thought until now that I'm wasting my money. So choose this recipe please and enjoy with your fam.

Very simple. I made it with "generic" 45% fat Lithuanian cheese, melted very well. I also buttered the pan. Delicious. Good with hot black tea with milk.

Thank you so much for this recipe! While others may make fun that you have posted such a simplistic recipe, I applaud it. I am a good cook but I have taught myself through reading cookbooks and websites. What is lacking in almost all of those sources is good, simple comfort food like this. I don't want a grilled cheese made with rye bread or gouda cheese. I want the grilled cheese sandwich that my grandmother made me as a child. This is the one!!

Actually, the heat needs to be medium high and toasted quickly - if done on low heat, cheese will not melt.  Med high browns the toast evenly and cheese will melt at the same time.
Have to add that  my son with Downs loves cooking and makes grilled cheese with a little mayo and a tomato slice.  Wonderful.

I just want to tell you thank you for submitting this. Yes, this recipe is simplistic. Yes, most people browsing this recipe site could most likely make a grilled cheese sandwich in their sleep. But when it comes to teaching a child to cook, having good, basic recipes at my fingers is appreciated. I have started teaching my 14 year old son, who has high functioning autism, and I have him choose at least one thing to make per week. Today he chose to make grilled cheese sandwiches. In effort to teach him to read and follow a recipe I turned to allrecipes and found this. The instructions are simple and straightforward. He has chosen to use whole wheat bread, provolone cheese, and is slipping a couple slices of salami into each sandwich to go along with the tomato soup he is making from a can. This is allowing my son to make lunch for his family and feel successful. Again, thank you.

Thank you for giving directions for making grilled cheese.  Some of us have been cooking so long that we forget that there was a time when we had to learn this too.  It's not an instinctive act.  Believe me, when my son made us grilled cheese sandwiches (he was an adult and a good cook), I was horrified.  Talk about burned food.  He can make them now. Again, thank you very much.  I'm sure this will help new cooks.

It may seem silly, but I needed this recipe. I forgot how to make grilled cheese. After reading that someone used coconut oil instead of butter, I thought I'd give it a try but couldn't remember if the bread got oiled or just the pan. I used cheddar in one and provolone dolce in the other. Cheddar wins. :-) Thanks for the recipe!

Guess I knew this one before Lol.   I tend to try to make a dish into a ballanced meal.   So I add a generous amount of spinach and thin slice ham or any type meat works.

Thank you for this. It's something everyone should know but no one thinks to teach. I had a general idea of what to do (as I had watched others make them in the past) but this helped clarify it for me. I personally like to put mozzarella cheese on it with some garlic butter.

LOL . . .all hilarity aside, I like my grilled cheese on whole grain bread with a bit of brown mustard spread on the inside and with sliced tomatoes as a compliment to the cheese.  Otherwise, carry on.  ;)  thanks for the recipe.

I know this may seem a no brained to most of the accomplished cooks that use this site, bit for a guy just starting to take over the cooking this is a god-send.  I'm truly thankful it was posted here because my son demanded "cheese sandwich" and I still doubt my ability to prepare edible dinners without spousal supervision.  Anyway, thank you for posting the simple recipes that we the beginners need.

I'm a grilled cheese pro and this is pretty good however I have some suggestions for making it even better. First use a really good white bread I like grandma sycamore bread. instead of buttering outside of the bread use olive oil, then put some type of hard grated cheese on top of the olive oil like Romano. That way there is a nice crust on the outside of the bread. On inside the bread use a couple of different cheeses, I like cheddar and Havarti, or cheddar and Gouda. Then on the side I like some sliced avocado and diced chili peppers or diced jalapenos. Delic!

I just made Grilled Cheese for the first time and I looked up the recipe here for reference...turned out awesome the only thing I did different was I sprinkled garlic powder and cracked pepper on the buttered side of the bread before frying them and it really gave it a little something extra, served with tomato soup.

Three ingredients to perfection. I always test my friends who say they can cook by having them make me a grilled cheese. Most the time the bread is burnt, or the cheese isn't melted, or the bread isn't toasted. It surprising  how many people can't make a basic grilled cheese. This recipe, while having very few ingredients, is sure to fool a lot of people into a false sense of security.

Thanks :)

Instead of buttering the bread, I swipe the heated nonstick pan with the stick of butter then put the sandwich on top of the melted butter to cook. When that side is done, I lift the sandwich then swipe the pan again and cook the other side- I still get the butter taste and it crisps up the bread, but this way you use MUCH less butter (at least I do!).  Makes it a bit healthier.  And sometimes I'll sprinkle a little garlic powder in the butter - yum!

I grew up on white bread with American cheese, but now I prefer a healthy wheat bread with a mixture of cheddar and monterey jack. I also use butter flavored pan spray on the bread rather than butter, even though real butter tastes the best.

At first I was unsure about taking on this recipe.  A lot of recipes on the web can be tricky, so I am pretty hesitant about spending the money on ingredients for a recipe that I might mess up.  Fortunately this was not the case!  I got out my butter and put it on my bread.  Although I did not use the recommended non stick pan, I still was able to perfectly brown both sides.  I also find that for a bit of a healthier version, cut the amount of butter in half.  A great recipe for the venturing artisan.  I advise caution when setting your flame as too much can easily burn the bread.  Good luck.  Don't F it up.

I always use mayo on my grilled cheese instead of butter because it tends to not burn the bread as fast, and in helps cook the bread more evenly. Also, try a sourdough and havardi grilled cheese. So good!

Despite this being a simple recipe you would be surprised that there are people who don't know how to make this simple delicious sandwich! I actually had to teach my friend how to make them once I started making them for our kids and had them hooked.

Out of all the "quick and easy" recipes, this is definitely the quickest, easiest, and one of the tastiest. I always like mine  grilled to blackening, and usually serve with some soup, or maybe Top Ramen.

UMMM! GOOD STUFF! Hubby's away for the weekend and i was thinking what to have that would be quick and easy. Looked in the cupboard and decided to make a toasted sandwich: Bread buttered outside, thin layer mayo inside, sliced cheese, thin slices mushrooms, salt, pepper, another layer cheese, bread buttered on outside. Toasted slooowly on stove to get cheese melty. Eat while watching favourite TV show.

It might seem funny to have a recipe for this, but I often cruise this site to get ideas...and who doesn't love this classic sandwich?!  One late night after all the pizza places were closed, I made this yummy treat for my friends who I was surprised to find out that none of them had ever tried!  Apparently growing up in traditional families outside of North America, grilled cheese was foreign to them!  

The other great thing about this simple base is how creative you can get; try rye bread and havarti with avocado!  There are restaurants specializing in this old favorite.

Grilled cheese sandwiches are always a wonderful, comfort food at our house.  I usually serve on homemade white bread when we have it for dinner.  After buttering the outside of the bread try sprinkling with parmesan cheese before grilling-yummy!

To make it extra crispy and super yummy,bake it in the oven until golden. Butter bread as usual and flip once one side is brown in order to brown the next. It may take a little while longer, but it is well worth it! I combine cheeses American and a little shredded cheddar or American and swiss. Play around with your choices.

This is typically how I make them however in college I tried them once with American Cheese and sour dough bread. That is now my favorite. Great with tomato soup or Pacific's Roasted Red Bell Pepper and Tomato Soup. I love comfort food.

Great classic.  Add a side of salsa - I prefer the chunky kind - and for lunch perhaps a few tortilla chips.  Great. Every young mother needs this recipe.

A great way to cut a few calories is by using the Crisco spray butter --- it's just like Pam but has a great buttery flavor! Served with creamy tomato basil soup and you have the perfect winter lunch!

Some tips Ive found that perfect the grilled cheese.  
Use REAL butter. Not margarine, not spray, nothing else. 
Sour Dough sliced bread is to die for on grilled cheese. 
dont cook too high, or it will burn for sure.

Just the way I make mine!  Very good basic recipe for first time cooks, also good basis for becoming a creative cook, gotta start somewhere.  Will add to new bride recipe box I'm making along with the "Perfect Baked Potato" from this site also.

Love this recipe.  My husband shared his little tip - try a little salsa on one of the sides of bread.  Not too much or the sandwich can get soggy.  Also if you don't have sliced bacon - bacon bits work pretty good too!

I've always made my grilled cheese this way and I will continue to do so. I personally think it's the best way to have it. The ony difference is I like mustard on mine. I sometimes like to add ham, and tomato for something different. Yummy.

There are infinite ways of making a grilled cheese sandwich. In my mind, this is the only way to do it, including using white bread. For someone just starting out in life, this recipe, and the reviews, are so needed and appreciated. May I add that I've found a pan on a stove works better for grilled cheese than an electric skillet or griddle. The heat is more even. Oh, and don't squish the sandwiches with your spatula. It ruins the fluffy texture of the bread, which is perfect against the golden buttery crispness of the grilled outer layer.

I prefer to rub the stick of butter around on the warm pan and flip it a couple times first instead of spreading it on the bread.  Less work and you use less butter ( aka fat ) with the same results.   A little garlic is a nice addition

I decided to make this classic grilled cheese because I’ve been feeling nostalgic this week. My two twin boys Cody and Brody just went off to college and their favorite meal growing up was a simple no nonsense grilled cheese. It’s scary knowing they’re off forging their own path, but the memories kept in a grilled cheese are keeping me from bawling my eyes out knowing i’ll be waking up without my boys in the home. Even though it hurts, this is a pain that hopefully every parent can experience, to see their children grow and flourish. I even made one with mayonnaise instead of butter. That was Brody’s favorite, but YUCK! I’ll stick to this classic myself. Good work!

You can't go wrong with grilled cheese, in fact I think I may make myself one for lunch. However, you left out the one ingredient that makes it taste so much better, Miracle Whip. Spread a little on the bread then put in the cheese - perfection!

I know there are a lot of rude comments but I appreciate this being uploaded. I have never liked grilled cheese and though I did vaguely know what to do it was nice to have the recipe now that I am pregnant and craving them lol I added a bit of mustard like someone else recommended and it is delish!

I made this, with just a few simple changes. I used pasta instead of bread because that's what I had on hand, and instead of the butter I used chicken broth because I'm trying to go low-fat.  The cheese would have been great but I decide to 'upgrade' by using a mix of shredded chicken, celery, onions and carrots.  

To be honest, this tasted more like chicken noodle soup than anything else.  5 stars.

There really are people who don't know how to make grilled cheese (my husband), and this is the basic recipe. I don't use nearly this much butter--just lightly spread it on your bread. American cheese slices melt the best, but try whatever you like. I used Colby jack this time. Medium heat cooks them too quickly-- medium low gives the cheese enough time to melt without burning the bread.

I think it is great that you included this recipe. Simple to most of us but some people new to our country, College kids, and men or boys can even do this one. If you have never tried a Toasted Cheese sandwich well it is very good and inexpensive and most people have the supplies on hand.

Try using mayo instead of butter! It is SO much better. Also once you flip the sandwich place a saucer on top of it.  It helps the cheese to melt.

Pair this with tomato soup and you have my all-time favorite school lunch. Oh to be a kid again!

PS..Note to REVBUD the only difference between yellow  and white cheddar is the dye used to make it yellow.

Hey guys! Don't make fun of 'basic recipes'....I'm 75, have been making grilled cheese for at least 65 years, & still found some great ideas reading these reviews!  Also, most 'young people' going off to college or on their own these days don't have a clue how to make tea, never mind food!  My version was always exactly like this basic recipe, & I always dipped it in Ketchup! try it....it's great! and Tomato soup with it is nearly carved in stone! lol.

I do exactly what she does, however, I use American cheese which I prefer more than Cheddar.

My kids grew up on grilled cheese sandwiches & tomato soup but when they got older I changed the grilled cheese up with thin sliced turkey, gouda cheese (instead of cheddar) & Dijon, thin sliced London Broil with tomato and horseradish.  

As long as you have bread, butter and good stuff to put on the bread you'll have a great grilled sandwich!!!

I love grilled cheese sandwiches and I pretty much make mine like this recipe, but I also enjoyed reading how people do theirs a little different. Always good to try things. Thank you for posting and allowing others to tweak a little.

Never follow this recipe because it's fatally flawed. The butter should be placed on the cheese side. The heat from the grilling will melt the butter, infuse it throughout the bread, and result in a much tastier sandwich with minimal greasiness on the bread.

Basic recipe to get us started. I put some garlic salt and sesame seeds, piled on some home made smoked sharp cheddar and homemade Canadian bacon. Grilled hot 'ham' and cheese. Cooked slow to heat everything through.

it is good to have this recipe for newbs!  my variation is to put a slice of cheddar, slice of ham, fresh chopped jalopenos, some shredded cheddar or gouda cheese cubes and then top it off with a slice of pepper jack and the remaining piece of buttered bread.  best part is there is so much cheese that it usually spills out and you get some of that yummy crispy cheese as a bonus!

So many variations... white american with potato bread, pumpernickel and swiss with tomato, munster or jack cheese with avocado...oh and bacon... I find that if I use cooking spray on a non stick pan the butter can be skipped for a healthier alternative - or at least swapped for other decadent ingredients

It's perfect - exactly as written.  Just a note that if you're ready to fix your sandwich and discover that the butter is too cold and hard to spread without tearing the bread, just melt some butter in the skillet first.   Add the unbuttered sandwich and it will fry up just fine!

I sometimes use the sharpest cheddar I can find along with thick sliced bread and sliced tomatoes.  Slow cooking gets everything melted and good. Other times I add a slice or two of swiss to the cheddar. Its all good.

I was laughing at this until I realized that my 23 year old step daughter actually would need a recipe to make a grilled cheese.  So, the recipe is dead on correct.  The way my mom taught me over 50 years ago.

Classic grilled cheese :)  However, it is much easier if you melt the butter in the skillet first (dip one side and remove and then place the other piece down in the remaining butter).   I only use real butter to cook with so this is the perfect way to not tear up your bread.

For best results use a stove-top skillet or griddle.. You wont get the same results by using a toaster, microwave, grill or oven/broiler.

Can't go wrong with a classic. One change I sometimes make is I buy a loaf of French bread and use that instead of regular sandwich bread. Some times I put different types of cheese in also , the French bread is the most common though. It gives it a different texture and the butter toast nicely in all those little nooks and crannies

I used "Can't Believe It's Not Butter!" instead and it turned out fine, this would taste good with some ham, and a sunny side egg in between.

Since people are commenting with their versions, I thought I'd add my own.  First, cook on low instead of medium so you can be sure the cheese melts before the bread burns.  Put half the amount of cheddar cheese you would normally use down then add sliced jalapeños (I use pickled in the jar) and cream cheese.  It's basically a jalapeño popper grilled cheese and it. Is. AMAZING.

Always a comfort food. I cook on med/low heat and always make in small frypan with a lid to help melt the cheese. We enjoy garlic salt on our butter side of the bread and use 2 slices of cheese of different kinds. Experiment! Sometimes I even put on a meat such as ham. Great sandwich alone or with a cup of soup.

Grilled cheese sandwiches are amazing!  I love using mayo spread on the outsides of the bread with gooey American cheese in the middle. The mayo  gives it an awesome crunch.

Made this for my family for a quick lunch. They loved it. Quick and easy to make with a few simple ingredients. I used Kerrygold salted butter, Natures Own whitewheat healthy white bread, and Sargento natural medium cheddar. Mom said it is perfect. Win!

Using this basic recipe my grandmother would put one slice of cheese on the bread, sprinkle just a little brown sugar on it then top with another slice of cheese and bread.  So good-it's the only way I like my grilled cheese.

I was going to make grilled cheese with onion and bacon tonight with some leftover chili and for s**t's and giggles thought I would see what was out there.  I just had to laugh at this recipe and spent 15 minutes looking at reviews.  That is 15 minutes I'll never get back....thought I'd add to it AND I think I will try the mayo thing to boot.

Loved grilled cheese sandwiches since I was a kid.(1950's).  The one thing my mom always put on the table was the raspberry jam.  After eating a sandwich with your tomato soup then if you wanted dessert you had another sandwich spread with raspberry jam.  They are awesome.  So many people I have told this to and they all have agreed.  Has to raspberry and jam, not strawberry or grape or anything called jelly. Try it, I'm sure you will love it.

One tip to change your grilled cheese perception: Add a dusting of powdered sugar on each side prior to grilling. It adds s sweetness on your lips that really brings out the flavor. I was sceptical at first but I won't make it any other way.

This is a great recipe, however I went with my own ingredients. In addition to cheese I used Philadelphia cheese spread, laid cheese on top of it, added beef sausage cut into thin slices and added boiled egg (also cut into slices). It was super delicious.

Love grilled cheese!  I use french bread with swiss cheese, feta cheese and colby.  I also sprinkle a litte dill on the inside. It was fabulous!
