With as special as this recipe is I predict that this will one day be in the Hall of Fame. Make sure you skim the fat off of the top prior to eating. Note, my pig's feet came in a package of four, not five. Recipe still worked well :-)

asked my father if there was any thing he could remember as a younger man that he wanted now to eat--He said pickled pigs feet --I used this recipe and made him 6 quarts of pigs feet--at the time I lived about an 8 hour drive from him --and when I  gave them to him he almost cried.(well worth the effort) He rationed them out for himself and enjoyed them for almost a year.

I would like to know before trying this recipe, if the bone can be left intact. The best part is the bone. I sure would like to know if anyone tried to cook these feet with the bone in. Thanks, Newelette Stevenson
