This truly is a wonderful dish -- rich, earthy, flavorful and low in fat and cholesterol. I've made it many times, but changed it quite significantly. 

I find the recipe workes best when I do the following -- 

REPLACE the vegetable oil with olive (healthier), the canned soup with 28 oz crushed tomatoes, the canned chillies with a jalapeno (seeds and ribs removed), the coco with 1 oz unsweetened dark chocolate, the dry garlic and cilantro with fresh. 

ADD cayenne peppers and coriander (to taste) plus one handful of finely ground almonds. Simmer it with about one pound of cooked chicken and add the cilantro close to the end of the cook time. Serve it over brown rice  or in tortillas, toped with reduced-fat cheese, a dollop of light sour, or diced fresh cilantro. My favorite part:  with the addition of olive oil, dark chocolate and almonds this dish offers a nice supply of anti-oxidants, which have been found in studies to lower blood pressure and protect the heart. Eat up!

I am rating this because I used it for a base recipe but added a lot of my own touch. I used 2 oz. of actual dark chocolate because that is what authentic mole sauce uses. I used a lot less tomato sauce (instead of soup) because it tasted too much like doctored tomato soup. I added 2 tbsp cinnamon and more cumin also some cayenne pepper for some spice. I left out the cilantro and peppers according to my own preference.  Mine turned out PERFECT! Thanks!

WOW! I thought this looked too easy (it is) and therefore could not possibly be that good. This recipe is fantastic, it works so well! I added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up and tossed the prepared sauce in to a crock pot with some shredded chicken. Amazing with tortillas!

We loved it!  Used fresh cilantro and garlic and closer to 1/2 cup of onion.  Made the sauce a day ahead and mixed in the roasted chicken before serving over rice and the flavors really melded well.  Couldn't get easier - thanks for the post!

This was the first time I've ever tried anything like this.  I followed a few suggestions made in the reviews, i.e., instead of tomato soup I used two cans of Mexican stewed tomatoes, and added salt.  My kids thought "chocolate sauce" on chicken was crazy, until they tasted it.  This was awesome, and will come into our regular rotation.

This was really good.  We like it a little more spicey so I added a little bit of finely chopped jalapeno.  I shredded cooked chicken and simmered it in the sauce for a bout 10 minutes.  Also, to make it a little thinnner, you could add some chicken or beef stock.

Loved this recipe!  It's quick, easy, and uses common ingredients.  I didn't have any green chiles, so subbed some jalapeno peppers ... not too many.  It added a little zip without being excessively hot.

The easiest mole sauce, and quite yummy! I made it according to the recipe for the first time - next time I'll double the chocolate for a little bit richer flavor. It was terrific over beef & cheese enchiladas!

I had serious doubts about this one--it seemed too easy.  Very good though. I have had better mole, I guess, but when you consider the work involved, this is probably the only one I'll make again--easy and good.

I can't get over how good and easy this is. I used fresh garlic and re-hydrated some red chile peppers and minced them for this recipe as that's what I had, so that took a little more time. But my gosh the flavor is wonderful! Thanks for sharing !

Thank you so much for this recipe and to all the reviewers for the excellent modifications.  My husband loves true mole and he said I did it.  I did change it liberally in accordance w/ the other reviews, but still kept it simple.  I used 2 tbsp cocoa powder; added an extra 1/8 of cumin; used one tbsp fresh cilantro; instead of green chiles or tomato soup, I used one 10 oz can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chiles).  I also added 1.5 tbsp peanut butter; 1.5 tbsp cinnamon, a liberal sprinkling of cayenne pepper and then added 1/2 a rotisserie chicken, letting that sit in the sauce on low heat for about an hour, stirring occassionally.  I then wrapped it in tortillas and covered it with mexican cheese and put it in the oven for 5 minutes on 350.  I added avocado.  Next time, I will make a separate batch of sauce to pour over, but otherwise, it tasted like true mole.

The good thing is that this was easy to prepare and is inexpensive.  However, it doesn't taste like real Mexican Mole.  Traditional mexican mole uses mexican chocolate (which has cinnamon in it) and the sauce comes out richer and thicker.  This has an okay taste, but it's not mole.  We probably won't make it again.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

I made this as part of a Spanish class project, making the sauce during the period and using dark meat chicken I had already cooked at home. It was fantastic! Quick and delicious, even in a less than ideal cooking situation (one hot plate, ten minutes; yikes).

Five stars just for the ease and simplicity of this recipe.  Not quite the mole I'm used to, but very respectable.  I did not use the condensed tomato soup because I didn't have any on hand, but rather  some tomato paste which I thinned with water. I added a pinch of ground cinnamon (personal preference) and a little more cumin.  I mixed the sauce directly into some shredded cooked chicken breasts and served in warm tortillas.  Will make this again.

This pretty good, but I am going to do what one of the reviews said and use Mexican tomato sauce...otherwise it tastes like doctored tomato soup. I added cayenne and a spoon full of peanut butter. I used the cocoa powder but I added about a dozen chocolate chips to. 

I shredded the chicken, another great idea from a review and mixed in with the sauce to let it simmer on our wood stove for awhile. 

Hope this helps. Overall a good recipe, and far easier than the traditional mole sauce.

I jumped the gun...I simmered the chicken in the sauce over our woodstove for about 30 minutes and the flavors really came out. What tasted like tomato soup in the pan tasted like authentic mole on the plate. I definately recommend simmering for a little while so make a bit of extra sauce so the chicken does dry out. I'm changing my recipe rating to 5 stars.

Yummy!!I added a can of diced tomatoes, upped the amount of cocoa powder to 1.5 TBSP, added 2 TBSP of crunchy peanut butter (because an older hispanic woman I used to know always added PB to hers and it was super!)

I had never had mole before but wanted to try it. My husband and I really liked it! After reading reviews, I used this recipe as a base and made some adjustments. I used 1oz of unsweetened bakers chocolate instead of liquid chocolate and melted it in the microwave. I also used tomato sauce, fresh hot peppers, fresh garlic, deleted the cilantro and added cayenne pepper, cinnamon, coriander and pepitas. We put it over chicken, brown rice, pepper jack cheese and avocados. Thanks for inspiring me to try something I've been curious about.

I liked it as is, but LOVED it with the following changes: as someone else suggested, I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the soup. I added 2 Tbsp. of cocoa powder and 3 squares of 70% dark chocolate, 1 Tbsp. of chili powder, 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and approx. 2 Tbsp. of Chipotle Tobasco sauce.

HUGE hit!!  Took to party and they raved it was even better than a restaurant. I doubled the sauce, used garlic powder, added extra cumin to taste.  I poured on top of chicken/onion/celery/yellow and red peppers mix, let simmer about 10 minutes.  Will make again!

Took the gist of this recipe, with a few changes: more cocoa powder, a whole onion, a respectable chunk of fresh garlic, lots of chili powder, some cinnamon, some cardamom (a.k.a. whatever was in my spice rack).  Lacking tomato soup, I used the end of a bottle of spicy V8 and some chicken stock until the consistency looked right.  I didn't have any chiles lying around, so I put this sauce on a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with taco-seasoned pulled pork and corn from a slow cooker, threw the whole thing in the oven at 350 for a few minutes to get everyone happy, and finished with some fresh cilantro and a squirt of lime juice on top.  Whoa.  Will be making this again.  Probably tomorrow.

I found a recipe for Turkey Mole Soup but couldn't find Mole sauce in the stores were I live so I made my own from this recipe.  It was easy, good on the pocket book and tastes great.  It makes a lot more than I needed so I put the excess in ice cube trays and froze, when frozen put them in a lock bag to use another time.

I made this a few months ago and it was absolutely delicious. I did not alter a thing! First of all, it's fine if you choose to use the tomato soup and adding the other ingredients does not make it taste simply like "doctored" tomato soup as another person said; everything blends together beautifully. I also found that cocoa powder worked fine. Reading other reviews it just seems that people try to make this recipe more difficult than it is, and that really isn't necessary at all. It's great just the way it is and you don't have to go through the hassle of melting dark chocolate if you don't want. Use this recipe as is and it will make you a great meal.

This recipe probably would have been milder but just as good as the tweaked one I made. And lemme say, it was AWESOME! I doubled the onion, the cocoa, and cumin, used 6 cloves minced garlic, and tomato sauce instead of soup. Oh and I used a can of diced tomatoes with green Chiles already in it. I spread half the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, put 12 skinless boned chicken thighs on top, sprinkled salt and pepper on top and saved the other half of the sauce to spoon on the chicken individually. Oh yeah, I cooked it at 400 degrees until the temp was right on the thermometer...about 40-45 minutes. PERFECT!!!

This was definitely easy, and stayed delicious. What I mean by that is that my palate didn't get tired of it, even after eating a lot of chicken. However, we used the following alterations: 1. used a shallot instead of the onion, 2. used trader joes tomato pepper base 3. used freshly chopped pepper 4. put in two slices of jalepeno in the base before cooking the base down a bit.  very good. will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe, and so did my wife!  I would say that the cumin took over for me.  I wanted more chocolate taste.  Perhaps I'll try that and report back :)

I don't think I would have liked this with tomato soup but I used crushed tomatoes instead and it was delicious. I also used 2 1/2 squares of baker's chocolate instead of cocoa powder

Dull, bland, no spice no kick.  We had to add half the spice cabinet to make this taste like anything but tomato.

I could taste the tomato soup way too much.  It had a good flavor but definitely tasted like doctored up soup.  I'm going to keep looking for another mole recipe.

This was a good recipe, but it lacked the depth I'm used to from a mole sauce at a Mexican restaurant.  It was easy to make, and I added some chicken that I'd marinated in a chicken fajita marinade, which added a little something.  Went well with Mexican rice.

How does this recipe compare to the mole paste in a jar? I'm asking because if it really tastes like doctored tomato soup, I'll stick to the jar. I am Mexican, and I grew up eating many types of mole, even mole made by immigrants. Although the mole paste in a jar isn't as good as from scratch mole, I use it because it is easy.

This was very tasty! It had a bit too much of a tomato taste for my taste though, so I think I'll increase the chocolate and reduce the tomato amount or replace it with stewed tomatoes next time. But a very good starting point, thanks!

Great recipe for novice mole-makers. Definitely don't use tomato soup! It tastes like...well, tomato soup. I used tomato sauce the second time and it turned out great! I also followed the suggestions and used fresh garlic and added corriander and cinnamon. I think I might try adding chili powder next time.

We had this on chicken and over rice like the picture shows.  It was okay, but not something I'll make again.  I can't define what was missing but something was.  Also I think tomato sauce or diced tomatoes would be better than tomato soup.

I tried this recipe over chicken and cheese enchiladas and loved it.  My family doesn't care for traditional red enchilada sauce so this is a very welcome and easy substitution.  I may try adding jalapenos in the future to make it hotter but this one was great as is.  Thanks for the great recipe, we will use it frequently.

Easy and good base recipe.  We've made this a couple times now and each time "doctor" it a little differently.  Using fresh garlic is a nice addition.  We make the chicken concurrently (cube and do in frying pan or boil and shred) and then toss it all together before serving with tortillas.

This was okay.  I doubled the chocolate as others had suggested, used two cans of tomato sauce instead of the soup asc I didn't have any soup on hand.  I served it over pre-ooked chicken breasts.  If I try it again, I will follow the recipe as written and use it to cook the chicken in.

I only eat at mexican restaurants that serve mole sauce - it is the only thing I order. This recipe is an excellent, easy version. I added about a teaspoon more of the cocoa, and an extra 1/8 teaspoon of the cumin and cilantro. Spread over cheese enchiladas and baked until bubbly - about 15 minutes - YUM! Didn't have any chiles and left out the garlic too - didn't miss them.

Loved this recipe - but substituted 1 can organic tomato paste and 2.5 cans of water for the tomato soup, also used 2T cocoa powder with about a tsp or Turbano sugar, used fresh cilantro, and chipotle chilies instead of green, and a whole small onion, chopped. Very easy and tasted great! Thanks for the recipe! LOVED IT and will definitely be making it again.

This was very easy and quite yummy, although I did make some substitutions and additions.   I didn't have condensed tomato soup so instead used half a can of regular "Hearty tomato" Progresso soup.  Also I didn't have any canned green chilies so instead I sauteed some green bell pepper along with the onions (about a 1/3 cup finely chopped), and then simmered the sauce with some dried red chilies from our garden for spice.  I added fresh cilantro instead of dried (1 tablespoon chopped) and a little bit of salt and cinnamon to round out the flavors.  Will definitely use it again!

This was the easiest, tastiest sauce I've made in a long time!  I loved that it was adaptable to things I had in my pantry withou sacrificing flavor.  I didn't have green chilis so I used a can of Rotel with green chilis and 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle powder for the heat.  I drained the tomatoes and the sauce came out thick and rich.  It was so good I just wanted to drink it!

This is awesome.  I have made it several times, both by the original recipe and also with changes suggested by other reviews.  Any way you make it, it seems to come out wonderful.  A never fail recipe.  I recommend you give it a try, and adjust to your own tastes.

Delicious!!  I've never had Mole before, but wanted to try it - loved how quick this  went together- I may even try a more authentic recipe - but, this will definetly  be made at our house again.

Only change I made to the recipe was no cilatro - but only because I forgot it at the store.

I've made this fantastic sauce numerous times, and every time, I get asked for the recipe!  This recipe is great by itself, but I really love it with a lot of fresh cilantro and some chipotle pepper powder or even hot sauce to give it some zing.  It's pretty forgiving, so don't worry about upsetting the balance of ingredients -- just modify to taste.

Good recipes I will make this again.  VERY easy to make.We put shredded chicken inot sauce and we ate on corn shells.  I do have to say this is not the mole I was looking for.  I'll keep looking.

This was a good starting point for a mole sauce, but left a lot to be desired. I added some red chili pepper flakes, and more cumin and coriander. It did taste more flavorful once you added it to meat. Next time I will try adding some ancho chili, fresh serranos and more herbs and spices to increase the depth of flavor.

I've never had mole before, just heard it talked on and on about in a university class that dealt with Mexican history.  SO I had high expectations and was only somewhat disappointed...and after all, considering it came out of cans and took about 15 minutes, what can you expect...the cocoa makes this earthy while the tomato soup makes it sort of creamy/cloying; I might switch the soup for sauce, or paste with water added, but if you use a fairly tart soup (mine was sweet) that might be fine.  Skipped cilantro as I inevitably hate it.  Used 2 cloves diced real garlic & fried it with onion.

Threw together quickly and was pretty tasty - only change was fresh garlic as that is what I keep on hand.
I deboned a rotissere chicken and simmered in sauce as someone else suggested.  Will make again and try adding jalepenos and cilantro as others suggested.

This was extremely easy. After seeing my mother make her mole from scratch years ago, I didn't think that this version could taste very good. I can't compare it to authenic mole, but if I  make it again, it will be this recipe. Too much work doing it from scratch. I too added jalapenio, fresh cilantro and a minced garlic.

This was a super easy recipe - I didn't have any cocoa so I used some chocolate candy I had and used fresh garlic.  I threw it in the crockpot with some cubed chicken on high for two hours - it was wonderful!

Merinate the chicken with corn flour, white pepper and 1 tablespoon of oil. then fry and mix with gravy.

Threw this in the slow cooker with a pork tenderloin. Added some chicken broth to make enough sauce. The pork was shreddable by the time it was cooked. This was SO GOOD! As in, lick the plate good! I also threw in a can of black beans. Served it over mashed potatoes, although I thought about serving it over baked potatoes. The sauce isn't too Mexican, it just made a very richly flavored sauce for the pork.

We are very pleased with this recipe! My 4year-old loved it. We had it over chicken wrapped in flour tortillas and added fresh avacado, tomato and made corn chips at home. I added a little (1/4cup maybe) extra water at the end before the boil to make sure it didn't get too thick. It turned out perfectly and I was very impressed. I will use this recipe often - we have mexican food several times a week.

This is a pretty good and not too sweet Mole sauce.  Mine turned out a bit thicker than I like, but all in all pretty good.  My husband - who turned his nose up when he saw me putting chocolate in chicken, even liked it.  I just used seasoned and baked then shredded chicken breast and it was perfect over rice flavored with lime, garlic and cilantro.

Quick, easy and good.  The only changes I made were to use tomato sauce instead of soup and to add a pinch of cinnamon. I made Juicy Roasted Chicken from this website, shredded it, and served it with the mole over rice.  A satisfying combination that I will probably try again.

This was a good base recipe that's fun to doctor up. I made it exactly as directed the first time and it was tasty, then decided to alter it the second time, replacing the tomato soup with tomato sauce and the cocoa powder with Mexican chocolate (in a much great amount). It came out great!

My husband makes a mole sauce that will knock your socks off, so I figured I'd give it a try. This wasn't as good as his, so I spiced it up with about 1/4 tsp of cayanne. I also added about 2 tbs of cream and I used tomatoe sauce instead of soup. That helped, but I agree with other reviewers, this still needs some tweeking.

Never having tasted "real" mole sauce, I didn't know what to expect.  I really thought this would taste like doctored-up tomato soup, but it was very good.  I would make this again.

WAY YUMMY! I used it over enchiladas instead of regular old enchilada sauce and it was a BIG hit! The only thing that I changed was using fresh garlic instead of dried. I am definitely using this sauce again!

First time making mole and it was awesome! Followed a few suggestions from other comments. Used olive oil, some extra (fresh) onion, crushed tomatoes, dark cocoa powder, extra cumin, a little cayenne, a lot of fresh garlic, crushed almonds, a little coriander, and a little garlic sea Salt. Made the sauce last night and refrigerated, then put in the crock pot with a couple raw chicken breads all day today on low. Broke the gicken up with a fork and mixed in about 1 loose cup of fresh cilantro. Served with tortillas and rice. De-lish!!!

This is a great base recipe, but the flavors were a little too "dark" for me. I suggest adding more cumin, lime juice, and some tabasco or sirracha sauce.

Excellent! And so easy. I did find that the cocoa added a touch of bitterness that I didn't care for, but I took another's suggestion and added 2T of peanut butter, which helped. Everyone ate it! (!!!) I simmered chicken strips in the sauce and some of us wrapped it in tortillas w/lettuce and some ate it as is. The sauce got very thick; I didn't have any more broth to thin it, but we ate it anyway. Going into the rotation! Thanks.

Used a fresh chile pepper, and it was perfect. My flatmates looked at me like I was crazy when I was putting cocoa into a chicken dish. But they were delightfully surprised and said I should make it again!

Soo good and easy. Everyone in our family loved it (husband myself and two kids under 5). I did go easy on the peppers and cumin and added a couple of cloves of garlic and fresh cilantro at the end. The basics of this recipe are so right on you can adjust the seasoning to your own likes and have it turn out just great.

The sauce was good but definitely could have used more kick. Next time I will toss in some chili powder and more cumin etc.

This sauce is delicious! My boyfriend made it for me since I love it at the Mexican restaurant nearby. I was weary about how it would turn out, especially after looking over the simple ingredients, but it turned out great! We omitted the cilantro because I don't like it. This was easy to make and goes wonderfully on chicken and rice.

I used way more onions and no coca powder or cilantro. It still tastes good, but I want to try with cocoa powder and cilantro next time.

Yummy, quick, easy. Will make it again. Instead of using unsweetened cocoa powder, i used dark chocolate. My boyfriend who only has enjoyed this when made from scratch enjoyed this quick version!

I ate this yesterday at a Mexican restaurant and thought I had to make this! I tried a few more recipes that were much more complicated and read through all of the comments! This recipe is basically perfect! I made no adjustments to it at all and my family absolutely loved it! adding the almonds to it or peanut butter is absolutely a mistake! Its perfect the way it is.Thank you for posting!
