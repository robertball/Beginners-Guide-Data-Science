This is a fabulous guilt free dessert (even breakfast!) Very simple to make, but make sure the jello is ALMOST set otherwise it will either be too runny or too thick! I also thought the recipe would work well with other fruit combinations e.g. pineapple jello and sliced banana. Will try this next time.

This was good, but believe me, a little goes a long way. It was very, very sweet. The combination of the gelatin and yogurt made a very pretty base for my wild black raspberries.

Good, healthy and low in calories if you use sugar free jello and low fat or calorie free yogurt

A nice light dessert. I was stupid and tried to stir in the raspberries after the jello/yogurt mix had set and it ended up looking bad, but still tasted nice.
