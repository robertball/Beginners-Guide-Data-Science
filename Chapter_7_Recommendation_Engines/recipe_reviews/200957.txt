This is an excellent dish with an exotic mid-eastern appeal.  The recipe is easy to follow and the flavors make a nice tangy mix.  I changed the recipe slightly to fit my preference for well browned and crispy chicken.  Therefore, I suggest searing the chicken breasts in a hot pan until the desired color is attained.  Then, turn down the heat to medium and add the pan ingredients.  Cook until some of the juice has been reduced.  I also would cover the dish in the oven to avoid drying out as there is not much liquid in the recipe.  The olives give a beautiful green color but I might also suggest adding some strips of sweet red bell pepper to enhance the appearance.  When squeezing lemons, I never just throw the rinds away.  They can be sliced or cut in rings to add a beautiful side garnish to the serving plate.

What a wonderful and quick recipe!   I didn't have tarragon, though it sounds delicious, so I substituted with fresh chives from my garden.  I also added a few kalamata olives for an extra kick.   Will definitely make this one again hopefully with tarragon!

Tasty and easy.  I used a combo of green, black, and red cerignola olives.  Next time I may double the butter and lemon because I would like a little more juice.

Best Chicken dish I have ever made! I did improvise a little...substituted butter with olive oil, fresh lemon for lemon juice from a bottle, tarragon for a fine herb blend of parsley, chives and tarragon and added capers. I also didn't bother browning it, just baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Kids gobbled it (without the olives!) I served it over salad with a homemade dressing similar to what the chicken was cooked in-YUM!!!

This was very good. I used thyme instead of tarragon because I did not have tarragon. I also only used 2 teaspoons of garlic not tablespoons. I did not have an oven safe pan so I transferred the chicken to a 9 x 13 glass dish and cooked it covered with foil at 375 for 30 minutes. Very easy!

I really loved this recipe, and it was great for my dad, who's on Atkins, because it's so low in carbohydrates. I increased the amount of butter and lemon, and I also added some sliced black olives and a few sweet pickled onions for a zesty flavour. I'll remember this recipe next time I cook chicken breasts!

Instead of tarragon, I used sage and also added Kalamata and black olives. It was absolute heaven. However, to turn this dish into a household staple, I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of the butter and parsley instead of tarragon. It doesn't taste quite as good, but it is much lighter and much healthier!

So good!  Next time I will try it with capers as many have suggested.  It was easy, the chicken was moist and the tarragon gave it great flavor.

 The last time I made this,  I substituted chicken with salmon and olives with capers...very good

A tender, juicy, roasted chicken with a hint of lemon. I didn't have any tarragon, so I added a sprinkling of sage and onion powder. I sauteed the onions with the chicken .  I partially cooked the bacon in the microwave. You probably could cook the bacon to the pan. However, I didn't want any added fat. Before placing in the oven I added the bacon-(held in place with a toothpick) and olives right before putting the chicken in the oven. My husband raved about the dish. Next time I will add more bacon per my husband's request.

This was a big hit at my house! Out of necessity I had to make some substitutions with what I had on hand. I used olive oil rather than butter (watching cholesterol). I did not have tarragon so I substituted Basil--but this wasn't enough flavor. I added marinated artichoke hearts and since I realized I didn't have lemons or lemon juice, instead I used the liquid drained from the jar of artichoke hearts...that added zing. And because I apparently can't read very well, I used black ollives instead of green!  Next time I will use green. I flattened the chicken breasts first which I think made them more tender. 
I look forward to trying it the way it is supposed to be! But this was good too.

This was really easy and good.  I think I will cut up or mash the olives next time, instead of leaving them whole.

The best chicken recipe I have found anywhere! If I could give it ten stars I would. Followed all of Chef Daves recommendations above (Thanks Chef!), used butter and olive oil, only change was Large Greek Pitted Kalamata Olives from Trader Joes (my preference). Husband kept saying, "Yum, Yum, Yum, don't forget how you made this!" A keeper for sure!

My husband, daughter and I all love green olives so I was so excited to come across this dish!  I didn't have any fresh lemon so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and I didn't have any tarragon in the house so I used 10 capers.  I also added a tiny bit of olive juice.  It came out delicious! I am going to try it the original way once I have all ingredients- this is a keeper, thank you!

Very good!  My family loved it.  I did make a few substitutions.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I did not have tarragon so I used thyme.  I used 3T bottled lemon juice.  The pan juices looked so good after baking that I sauteed cooked pasta in them until the liquid evaporated (about 5 minutes) and I am glad I did!

Excellent and easy to make. Followed every step maybe next time I will flour and fry the chicken for extra crunch. Goos as it is though.

Didn't have tarragon so I used thyme.  Recipe turned out well.  Olives absorbed garlic taste wonderfully.  I had a hard time getting the chicken to brown while on the stove as I was being careful not to burn the garlic.  Still, turned out great.

This was super easy and my hubby liked it alot. The olives are a great touch. The recipe doesn't call for salt/pepper, but I added. I think it would have been a little bland without. However, I also didn't have tarragon, so I improvised with thyme as well.

This recipe is very good. Used Kalamata Olives preserved in wine vinegar. Added 1 tsp of olive juice to give it more moisture. Seared the chicken in olive oil to brown than added the ingredients. Served with basmati rice and stemed spinach. Very nice.

Easy but somewhat salty.  Seared first and then added everything to the pan with a little extra stock and then placed in the oven covered until cooked

This was Deeeeeeliscious! And so easy! I used a mixture of Kalamata and green manzilla olives and cut them up a bit to really cover the chicken breasts in addition to a teaspoon of capers. The flavor was phenomenal. I'll be making this often.

This looks and sounds amazing! I will also try it with pork loin and make additional pan sauce with wine or cognac.

This is now one of my top 10 chicken recipes! I did double the butter and I used sliced olives as thats what I had in the fridge. I baked for 15 minutes, because they were Purdue Perfect Portion size and it turned our delish! My 8 year old had seconds, she HATES olives, so she scraped them off and STILL loved it. Will be making this again next week!

This is ok. It has nice flavor and I loved the olives with it. It was more bland than I'd hoped, but I think i'd make it again. Perhaps add a touch of salt and pepper.

I made this using fresh tarragon and it was delish. An interesting combination with the green olives but well worth. I would serve this for guests. A simple easy meal that comes together in no time at all.

I followed this recipe as is and it was perfectly delicious. It was even better heated up the next day for lunch. So simple, but an excellent combo of flavors. Next time I did add artichoke hearts for my husband which was just another layer of delicious.

Simple to make and it has a great flavor. I added black olives, used a few more green olives than called for, used bottled lemon Juice (~3 TBSP) and covered it while it baked, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. My only complaint is it was a tad dry. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it. I did add artichoke hearts (and would love to try capers, but I was out)...plus a little more lemon (used 2 large)and used kalamati olives. It made a good amount of juice/broth Really yummy and my husband loved it. I think that the tarragon makes it :) The chicken breasts I bought were pretty thick, so I would slice them next time, but this was really good- definitely a keeper.

What a tasty surprise.  I did flour the chicken and pan seared in equal butter and olive oil then removed chicken and made the sauce using 4 gloves of garlic.  My husband was worried it would be too much garlic because the aroma was strong but it wasn't at all.  I used green and kalamati olives.  Wish there was a bit more sauce but wouldn't want to use more butter or evoo but it really wasn't necessary.

This is such a wonderfully quick and tasty recipe. I did not have tarragon so I used oregano and it was absolutely delicious and moist. I used Queen pimento stuffed Spanish olives.

I used Kalamata olives instead of green olives, and since my wife is allergic to onion and garlic, I used a little (1 tbsp) of the olive juice in the baking portion of the recipe to add a bit of zip. Loved it! Easy, quick, tasty, and healthy ... hard to beat that! Thank you Nanacooks!!

I was craving something tangy and different to go with my chicken, and this recipe did not disappoint! I will admit that I made a few changes based on our own tastes and what we had in the cupboard (dried basil instead of terragon, olive oil instead of butter).  I baked the dish in a covered pan based on another cooks review, and I think this helped to seal in the flavour.  I crumbled some feta cheese ontop and baked uncovered for the last 8 minutes of baking.  I'm not sure what the one reviewer claiming that this recipe lacks flavour was talking about, this was exactly what I'd hoped it would be.

Very easy, and, to my mind, very good. But I like olives a lot.

Changes--I only had Meyer lemons, so I used a few of those (they're small) for the juice, and savory instead of tarragon. I used up all the garlic I had, but I don't think it came to 2 tablepoons; it was about 6 or 8 cloves. I made it with two big chicken breasts, each sliced into two slices. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. My husband, less fond of olives than I (and, again, I had only small, pimento-stuffed olives on hand, so I used a lot of them), thought it was okay.

I used white wine instead of lemon juice! Yummy, next time I will put more olives in too.

This was pretty good.  I used chicken thighs cause they are cheaper and I like them better.  I ended up with a good amount of 'sauce' and served it over rice.  Next time I think I would brown the chicken in olive oil and then add everything else.  I used cheap green olives cause that was what was in the fridge and also added artichoke hearts.  They weren't bad but I might just make this without the olives or artichokes as the chicken was really good and lemony!!

Excellent!  I had some mixed olives and cubed feta cheese marinated in olive oil and spices from Whole Foods market so I used some of that oil, stirred in the garlic, lemon juice, sage & thyme (I didn't have tarragon). Oh, I added 1/2 teaspoon sea salt to the lemon mixture.  Then I browned the chicken in that mixture and put the olives and feta cheese on top, then into the oven.  I didn't cover the pan.  When I removed the chicken from the pan I used the mixture left in it to make Easy Fried Spinach from this site.  So, so good. I plan to make this often and will always make the fried spinach right after.   The olives added such a good flavor and I will add extra olives from now on.  Thank you Nanacooks, for this great recipe.  Sorry I changed it a little but it turned out just the way I wanted it to.

Loved it.  With just a little bit of tweaking, they turned out wonderful.  Don't be afraid to tweak all you want.  I used large garlic stuffed olives and removed the garlic from the olives and minced those.

Juicy and flavorful.  Made it with deli stuffed green olives and sweet pickled onions.
2-6-13:  Liked it this time too.

Not sure about all the good reviews for this recipe.  I made it for dinner this evening and it was not good at all.  It was baked chicken.  That's it.  There was no other flavor, other than that of the olives.  I even doubled the amount of butter, lemon, and tarragon.  No flavor at all.  Just dull baked chicken.  I can't help but notice that there is bacon in the picture of the dish, but no bacon in the recipe.  Maybe that would have helped a little.
