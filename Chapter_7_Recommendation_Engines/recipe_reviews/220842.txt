I shredded the carrots and used the green part of scallions rather than chives.  The flavors didn't really work together for us as well as I'd thought they would.  It did make for a unique side dish for our meal.  Thanks!

A very good flavor using the chardonnay wine and the only changes I made was plumping the raisins approximately 2 hours and I added a little sugar. The taste was so good, I am making it again and will double the recipe. Oh, and when I drained the raisins, I drank the wine and it was better than the original, so I will increase the wine!

Great riff on a classic.  Added celery and used regular (stale) raisins - white wine helped with the stale issue and is a great idea all around.

I followed the recipe for the most part.  I soaked the raisins for only about 20 minutes, made a smaller patch and used dried chives.  

Although I was dubious about the combination of ingredients, it turned out to be quite tasty.  Even had a second helping.  -YRob
