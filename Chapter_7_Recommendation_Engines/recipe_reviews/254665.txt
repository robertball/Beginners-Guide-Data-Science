This was a perfect balance of sweet, heat, and savory flavor. I am on my second helping now. Yum.

This had a great flavor, but it was VERY spicy!  Next time, I will swap some of the poblano peppers for bell peppers.  To make preparation a little easier, I cooked the potatoes in the broth (rather than boiling them separately.)  I then pureed it to make the soup nice and creamy before adding everything else.

it was not spicy at all.  Next time i will add jalepeno.  we cooked the corn under the broiler to char it.  grilled in the husk corn would be great.  not too hard to make and filling.

Wonderful. I topped with sour cream, diced avocado and bacon.
