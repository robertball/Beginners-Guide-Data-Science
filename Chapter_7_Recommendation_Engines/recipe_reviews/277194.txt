Substituted red pepper flakes for the Aleppo. My wife finished hers before I could sit down! Very tasty!
Thanks Chef John!

This might be the best thing I have ever made. I had all the ingredients, including Aleppo pepper ,so it was a no brainer when I saw this video . I absolutely demolished the plate. WOW is this good. Thank you Chef John !!

Made without the optional parsley and jalapeno oil, and just used regular crushed red pepper. Excellent. I made sure to warm the plate before assembly and made naan for dipping.

Didn't have fresh garlic- the pungency of fresh garlic (rather than powdered or pre-chopped) would have made this even better. Worth it to use Aleppo peppers- find them at your local Mediterranean store. Till next time!

This is really outstanding, and I think both oils are worthwhile. My only note would be to leave plating until the eggs are cooked and draining on paper towel--otherwise the yogurt and oils kind of coalesce into one circular blob on the plate.  Having everything at room temp is pretty crucial to get the flavors to meld, and lines up with how this dish would likely be served traditionally.

I made an account just to rate this recipe. 

I've never considered having eggs and yogurt together, but now that I have I'm hooked! The first time I made it I made it as directed and it was delicious. The last five or so times I've gotten a little lazy and instead of making the infused butter I'll just add the spices to the yogurt, and I've sometimes skipped the jalapeno/parsley blend and no matter what I do it's always great!

It was very mildly spicy, not overly so. I thought I had let the yogurt go to room temp but the dish still seemed like it had gotten cold. Next time I would try warming it. I also might go with just the red oil, the green didn't seem to add much.
