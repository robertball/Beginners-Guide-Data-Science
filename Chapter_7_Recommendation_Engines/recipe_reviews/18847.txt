It takes a lot longer than the recipe suggests to cook clear through, which means that the outside of your burger will almost certainly be burnt beyond recognition.  Also, the ingredients you stuff inside the burger simply do not taste good together.

This has become one of our favorite recipes.  I find that making the burger flatter and using our George Foreman grill makes it quick and easy.
