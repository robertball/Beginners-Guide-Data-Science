I'm updating this review because I've made this pizza quite a few times now and made little changes to lower the fat and calories. I started using the new spray-on salad dressing (I use the Caesar flavor) as the base in place of the olive oil. Just a few sprays and it's ready for topping. I use the fake crabmeat to cut costs and marinated artichoke hearts, cut up, to replace the ones packed in water. Sometimes I add sliced red onion and mushrooms if I feel like it. I top it with the reduced fat Italian cheese blend and a little parmesan. Really delish!  6/07/08The whole family really enjoyed this... thanks for a keeper! Great combination of flavors!

Excellent!  My hubby and I are going to have this a lot!  I bought crabmeat from a package by the meat section of the market instead of the can (it was actually cheaper).  Everything else, we followed to the recipe and it was divine!

It was pretty good as written - although I thought it could have used some more mozzarella and a little more red pepper flakes.  Thank you!

Great combination of ingredients! The only thing I changed was to use imitation crab meat instead of canned and a pre-made thin crust for my base. Will definitely be adding this to my weekly rotation.

This was an interesting combination that I had not thought to use on a pizza myself.  I used the ingredients listed, but used a little extra artichoke and eyeballed everything else.

The crab was an odd flavor on pizza for me.
