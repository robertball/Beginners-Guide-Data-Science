Have always loved these cookies and make them for Christmas each year.  I take a can of cream cheese frosting (tint 1/2 with green and 1/2 with red food coloring) and then frost the cookies.  MMMMMM

These cookies are GREAT!!! They almost melt in you mouth.  For Christmas, I made a frosting with butter and confectioners sugar and vanilla. I frosted the cookies and put sprinkles on them.  Wonderful.

I found these to be very dry & bland. I can see why the other reviewers added frosting.

good flavor and easy to make. had to substitute for self raising flour a mixture of 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt for every cup of flour. Also, did a frosting of powdered sugar dash salt butter vanilla, few tablespoons coffee and few drops of molasses. yum!

Ease of preparation, but no flavor - and I doubled the ginger.  Will stick with GingerSnaps instead.  Kudos to those of you who like this recipe tho!
