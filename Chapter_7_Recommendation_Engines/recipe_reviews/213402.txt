The first time I had mustard mashed potatoes was at an Irish restaurant served with bangers 'n mash.  The flavor is somewhat similar to a German style potato salad.  It isn't something I could eat with just any meal, but when paired with the right meats and sauces, they are absolutely delish.  (i.e., bangers 'n mash, corned beef 'n cabbage, old fashioned pot roast)

Was it going to be traditional (boring) mashed potatoes for supper  tonight or was it going to be mashed potatoes with, gasp, MUSTARD in them?  In the end, the mashed potatoes with mustard prevailed.  And I'm glad.  So glad.  Don't hesitate to make these.  They're awesome good.  Country-Style Steak, also from this site, these Mustard Mashed Potatoes, and green beans.  What a meal.

delicious just as written; the only change I made was using white potatoes rather than red and i don't think that really affected anything.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I was not quite sure about this and thought it would be a fail, but took a chance. I am glad I did. This was really very good. This reminded me of mustard potato salad. I used brown spicy mustard. I would fix this again. DH covered his with gravy and didn't comment.

These were pretty good but the mustard was too overpowering for us. Next time I will cut the mustard in half and try adding in parmesan cheese.

Tears of joy.  Utter tears of joy.  A delicious mashed potato recipe without the tons of butter and sour cream that I usually like to mix into it?  Much like unicorns, I didn't believe such a thing existed!  And yet, here it is, and a perfect complement to the BOMB pork loin with peaches that was marinated, then grilled on my trusty charcoal grill. Not to mention it was a great base to set my over-easy eggs on the next morning, instead of toast...  and then a tasty side dish to my grilled ham and cheese sandwich later at lunch.  And finally, just because I couldn't help myself, a tasty snack on its own mid-afternoon.  

I made this exactly as posted with no changes, but you can dial up or dial down the amount of mustard depending on your preference.  Myself, I am a mustard-o-holic so the next time I made these, I kicked it up a notch. I will definitely make this again.    In fact, I'm making it right now as I type this. Oh joy!

This sounds really great.  Every try adding a small amount of creme cheese while whipping the potatoes?  It adds a great consistency & doesn't change the taste that much.

Big hit with the adults, not so much with the teenagers. The little kids didn't even notice a difference.

I love mustard, but never thought to add it to mashed potatoes. I used russets instead of red potatoes. Mustard comes in many different strengths, so use discretion. Mine was pretty strong so I used less. Not sure how often I'll make this, as a side it won't compliment as many dishes as regular mash but I liked it and I'm glad I visited this one.

These were fantastic!  The flavor reminded me a bit of potato salad.  And they are perfect.

Replaced the potatoes with mashed cauliflower. Delicious.  Perfect with bangers.

I served these with a ham dinner.  They had good flavor, consistency and moisture.  They have a very intense flavor.

These were great! I used what I had on hand...2 Yukon gold potatoes and 1 regular one. I only added a few tsps of the whole grain mustard, and that was a good call. It's a strong mustard, and the flavor just right for me...not too overwhelming. You can always add more if that is your taste preference. As others have suggested, I can see this going really well with corned beef/cabbage. Thanks TaraR for a wonderful recipe!
