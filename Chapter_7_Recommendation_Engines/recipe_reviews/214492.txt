This is a good base recipe.  I followed other reviewers suggestions.  I added the following: 4T of pesto (instead of 2), 1 t minced garlic & 1 t white wine to the pesto mix.  I layered in with the chicken: 1/2 a chopped onion, 1/2 a roasted pepper (chopped), mushrooms.  Amazing!!!!  Don't forget to sprinkle the chicken breasts with some salt and pepper.  Next time I'm thinking I'll add some grilled asparagus (anything to get more veggies in our diet!) Thanks for the excellent starting point!

A little bland so I jazzed it up with some fresh chopped garlic and I let the chicken breasts marinate in the pesto-which I doubled overnight. A great base recipe for a busy working person

This was good, but just a little bland. I would recommend seasoning the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before placing on the spinach and pesto. I did use about double the recommended pesto.

OK, so this time I broke my own rule -- which is to always make the recipe as-is the first time through (how else are ya gonna' know, right?)  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions, adding minced garlic, diced onions, and some fresh sliced mushrooms, along with lots more pesto & a little white wine.  The results were great!  My conclusion is that this is a great base recipe, and has lots of room for versitility.  We will definitely keep this as a regular item on our menu.

5 stars with some small changes.  After reading the reviews I added more pesto.  I make a light pesto in the summer (less than half of the regular oil) and freeze it, used about 6 cubes.  I also salt/pepper'd the chicken prior to putting it in the baking dish.  Finally, I added some garlic and diced sun-dried tomatoes to the mixture.  It came out so good my fiance complimented the recipe about 4 times while we were eating!  Delicious!

What I like about this recipe is there are so few ingredients. I usually have to log onto my computer to pull up recipes but this one, I remembered right off hand! I used much more pesto then called for (or in my case 'to taste') and added a pinch of seasoned salt to the chicken. Instead of putting the ingredients on top, I split the chicken breasts in have and stuff them. Also added shredded mozzerella, mushrooms, and onions. We at with a side of mashed potatoes. Very good!

Easy, delicious and fast.
I was really tired when I searched for something to make for dinner.  This recipe looked simple and I had the ingredients.  Well, this is the 2nd time I've made it this week.  It's a keeper.  I basically made as written the first time and the 2nd time I added chopped garlic and then at the end, a bit of feta cheese on top.  Both times I served it with jasmine rice.  The next time I make it I will add pine nuts.  It works well as written but also is fun to add variations.  This is a great weeknight meal but I will serve this for company.  One of my favorite recipes on this site.

We tried this tonight, and enjoyed it. Like many others, I seasoned the chicken breasts with sea salt & pepper. I also followed the advice of many reviewers who suggested adding a few cloves of minced garlic, about a 1/4 cup diced onions, a little white wine, and more pesto than the original recipe called for.  It turned out very moist, and flavorful.  It was a nice change for boneless chicken breasts. I served it with oven roasted fresh beets and carrots. Thanks!

Only things I changed to this recipe was pre-browning the chicken before adding to the baking dish as it was much for visually appealing having some color  ... and I almost tripled the amount of pesto as my family loves pesto ... I have also made this recipe with boneless pork chops and its very nice too

This was quick and easy! I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed to my preference. I seasoned my chicken with some cayenne pepper and sea salt. I also added some diced roasted red peppers to the pesto/spinach mixture for a little flavor and more color. It was so good!

This was really very good!  I made it with homemade pesto that we made this summer and it had very good flavor.  I like to make something per the recipe the first time out and I will definitely make this again. I can easily see using red peppers, zucchini and/or mushrooms along with the spinach and pesto mix.  Thank you  for sharing!

We LOVED this.  Very easy.  I gave it 4 stars because I took reviewers advice and salt and peppered the chicken first and doubled the pesto.  After it was done I sprinkled lemon juice over all.

Loved this!  I only thawed two chicken breasts but made the same amount of the pesto/spinach mixture.  I also added some sundried tomatoes in an herb oil.  It added a really nice flavor to it.  I added the recommended parmesan cheese for 4 servings.  This was so great and so easy.  The flavors were amazing and it was so simple.  Thanx for sharing!

Very tasty - I added some garlic and chicken stock to make it less blend. Optionally you can cut the chicken into pieces and add feta cheese, too. Tasty, easy and quick to prepare!

Other than about  tripling the amount of spinach and pesto, I made this recipe exactly as written and my chicken turned out moist and delicious.

I hate to say it, but this recipe was a big disappointment.  The spinach and pesto combination didn't work for me because it came out with a very sharp flavor even though I love them separately.  Also, although I cooked it as directed allowing the oven to preheat for at least 10-15 minutes, the chicken was still undercooked in the middle.  I prepared baked chicken breasts the two nights prior using other recipes at the same time/temp, so I think the problem was covering the dish with foil.  I'll make note to cook any raw chicken longer/hotter if it's covered in foil.

I so wanted to like this, but it almost caused me to lose my kitchen cred with the fiance.  I'll have to delete this one from my recipe box, I'm afraid.

I LOVED this recipe.  I added more pesto to this beccuse I love the stuff.  My husband wasn't a fan, but he's not a pesto lover.  I haven't made this again because of him.  But if he ever goes out with the guys over dinner this is gonna find its way on my plate again.

Very good. My boyfriend (who HATES spinach) loved it! I rolled the mix into the chicken and I think it retained the flavor more.

This dish is not only easy but tasty. I always look at the nutritional information and the calorie count. It is low in cholesterol and calories but provides a nutritional punch with the spinach. It will become a family favorite.

I added 2t of white wine and 1/2 an onion. I prepare my own pesto so the garlic is there and there is plenty of flavors (you will find pesto recipes on this site- very easy if you have a food processor). sprinkled with cheese before baking. Wonderful, light, and for all you ITALIANS our there. THIS IS IT!

So moist, delicious, and easy for a weeknight meal.  (I used a lot more pesto and spinach.) Great with a side of angel hair pasta.

I did make changes, so I cannot review the original recipe.  That said, I replaced the spinach with broccoli rabe and added some sliced mushrooms and garlic.  I cooked the chicken according to the instructions and they came out most and delicious.  The pesto adds a nice flavor to the greens.  Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe!

I read the other reviews before I made this, and decided to use a hefty 2 cups chopped spinach and about 1/2 cup of pesto.  I didn't mix ALL of the pesto with the spinach, I saved some and spread it over the chicken before I topped it with the 2nd half of the spinach/pesto mixture.  I also sprinkled a bit of sea salt on the chicken.  I baked it for 30 mins. and then topped it with fresh mozzarella instead of parmesan cheese & baked for another 15 minutes.  It was Easy, Delicious and looked Beautiful.  I would DEFINITELY serve this to guests!

Decent.  The chicken needed more flavor.  I think next time I'll let the chicken marinade in the pesto for a day and see if that helps.

This was just ok.  I salt/peppered the chicken as suggested.  I don't know if I'll try this again.

This truly is a good starting point for experimenting & I can see how so many have put their own spin on it... Like many others I added more pesto & topped the chicken off with some seasoned diced tomatoes before baking. Next time I think I'll let the chicken sit in the fridge for a few hours to soak up more flavor.

Delicious and So Easy!  I did use a bit more pesto than called for and added garlic and white wine to the pesto sauce. I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper prior to spreading the pesto mixture on it. Served with pasta mixed with pesto and a green salad.

This simple recipe is a total hit with EVERYONE from my 2yo, through my teenagers, my husband (who requests it at least once a week) and even my amazing chef friend, whose praise is obviously treasured.

The family really liked with a couple of tweeks. Added fresh garlic like a lot of others, also used more pesto. Once everything was put together I topped with cherry tomato's which added so much flavor to the dish.

Made this for the first time last night. It was a big hit. However, following some suggestions from other comments, I doubled the Pesto, used 3 tablespoons of the cheese and added 2 cloves of garlic to the Pesto mixture. Loved it!!!

I used Italian pesto (not sure how that is different than basil pesto...) and shredded Parmesan cheese instead of grated. My spinach was also torn versus being finely chopped. This was easy to make and very good to eat!

Glad that I read the previous reviews and added more pesto, 3-4 minced garlic since my family likes it and white wine. I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen spinach thawed and squeezed the excess water and I made this with chicken thigh. Sprinkled some salt and pepper on the chicken before putting the spinach mix on top. Opted to make it with no cheese.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I wanted to make something quick and easy with food I had on hand -- spinach and chicken breasts.  So I was happy to find this recipe.  I'm sure it would have been excellent exactly as written but I had sliced mushrooms to use so I added them the last 15 minute when I added the cheese.  For cheese I added some feta with the parmesan just because I was almost out of fresh parmesan.  Followed cooking directions exactly and the chicken was yummy & moist and spinach with pesto delightful.  When I make this again I will at least double the pesto and spinach because it cooks down so much, my husband and I were fighting over it.  Probably plenty though for "normal" people.  :)

Made it for the first time tonight and it was quite good! I went with a few suggestions on here such as adding a touch of salt to the top of the chicken, put in almost twice as much pesto, a splash of chicken broth & a shake of garlic powder to the mixture - came out great!  The juices left in the pan went well on some penne pasta, too. Served spinach on the side. Really good!

Delicious. Hubby loved it.  Like others, increased the amount of pesto and spinach, added sliced mushrooms, garlic and a sliced leek and seasoned the chicken. Will cook again.

We really liked this recipe. I am sure I will use it again.  I also added finely chopped onion and garlic.  I used my homemade frozen pesto so I added a little white wine for moisture. It was moist and juicy.

I saw this recipe in the new magazine.  My daughter chose this as the first recipe to try and we have made it twice now.  I followed the recipe the first time and doubled the pesto/spinach/cheese the second time.  Much more flavour the second time around.  Very quick and easy to make.  Thank you for sharing.

This was much better than I thought it would be. I am not a pesto fan but wanted to cook up something different for my wife.  I was surprised that we both liked it and will be on the menu again.  I did not change it up other than I eye balled the amount of ingredients. I know I added more grated parm.  My wife suggested I use shreaded mozzarella cheese next time.

Excellent as described with added pesto mixed in and dripped over top of chicken. Didn't need the parmesan cheese as plenty tasty without.

This is an excellent recipe to use as a base for many additions or variations. Unless I am baking, I don’t follow just one recipe. I take things from 3 or 4 similar recipes plus add my own touches to suit my taste. I don’t rewrite someone else’s recipe in a review so I not going to do that here. For beginning Cook’s who don’t have the experience or confidence yet to add or leave out things, this recipe as it stands would still turn out very well.

Love this!  And opted to add, like the other reviewers, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, white wine, and chopped onions; as well as salt and pepper to the chicken.  My husband loved it!  Had seconds!!  Thank you for this lovely recipe...and all the suggestions...

These were sooo flavorful.  I used breasts. Cut in half and pounded thin.  A whole bag of spinach chopped and the full jar of prepared pesto. (6oz).   I added half a jar of chopped sundried tomatoes that I had to use up.

I made the changes that other reviewers suggested.  I used more spinach and Pesto.  I added garlic and white wine to the Pesto, also added zucchini (chopped) and halved cherry tomatoes.  My husband loved it and told me I should review the recipe and give it the five stars.

This is a good basic recipe. After looking at other reviews, I went with the recommendations. Added 2 TBS more pesto, finely chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper on the chicken. I also made this with chicken tenders because that's what I had. It was really good with the modifications. Definitely a keeper!

This is an awesome recipe, a true 5 star restaurant quality & thank you so much for sharing it with us all.  Based on other reviews, added, 1 cup of chopped red onions, 2 cups sliced baby Bella's, 1/2 cup of white wine & a tiny bottle of chopped pimento to pesto/spinach mix (which I doubled).  Used 2 chicken breasts only as they were large.  Sprinkled the breasts with salt, pepper & garlic powder.  Served it with basmati rice.

Made this at the last minute on the busy day before Christmas Eve after an ingredient search and because of its simplicity.  I always use more pesto in any recipe and I wrapped the chicken breasts in bacon!  My family raved!

I followed other reviews and seasoned chicken. I followed the directions exactly and the chicken was over cooked. I would adjust cooking temp lower to 350 perhaps and less time.

I usually make the recipes exactly as called for but since this one is well on its way to greatness, I made some adjustments based on other comments.  I only used two chicken breasts so halved the recipe, kind of : ) I used the whole a 1.5 Cups finely chopped fresh Spinach, I used an entire 3.5 ounce jar of Pesto, and added 1 Tsp of Minced Garlic and 1/2 of an Onion Chopped.  This is a terrific recipe and we will be making this again!

It lwas very bland.  I read the other reviews and followed their suggestions but still felt it lacked flavor.  I  have leftovers so will try to spice it up with capers and some basil.

Will not make again! I found this recipe to be bland despite making a few additions recommended in the comments. I followed all of the instructions but made the following additions: 1/2 onion, and mushrooms to the spinach/pesto mixture. I also added  salt and pepper to the chicken. Also, the chicken was chewy, not sure if it was over baked (I followed the baking instructions exactly)

I made this one... I wanted something new and flavorful to do with chicken breasts. I used 4 tablespoons pesto 2 minced garlic cloves and a splash of White wine, with a cup and a half or so of chopped fresh spinach. Then topped the dish with red yellow and orange chopped bell peppers Plus portobello mushrooms. Delicias!

I prefer bone in breast and I used 2 bags of spinach and a small jar of pesto. I cook it a little longer beings I use the bone in breast. We love it. I like to make gratin butternut squash with it. They both use the same oven temperature and time.

I love super easy recipes and ones that can be versatile. This fits the bill perfectly! I read some of the other reviews by adding extra pesto and since I love spinach I added quite a bit more. I also added some sliced mushrooms on the very top and it came out excellent. I also added salt and pepper to the chicken before layering. I intend to try with some asparagus next time too! Yummy!!

I actually bought a gourmet pesto and smothered the chicken. I let it marinate in the refrigerator for an hour or so and then placed dry roasted tomatoes on top. I followed the cooking directions exactly and my meal came out perfect. Even having it left over at the same temperature in the oven was fine. Just cover it. My chicken breast were thick. I didn't need to add anything because the pesto had everything including the cheese and the pinenuts.

I thought this would have more flavor, but it was just bland and boring.  I won't be using this recipe again.

I followed other suggestions using salt and pepper on the chicken breasts.  I marinated the chicken breasts in the pesto all day.  I added some thin strips of zuchinni to the spinach as well as chopped onion and garlic.  It turned out juicy, tender, and very flavorful.

I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the pestos and spinach and coated the chicken in creole sauce, covered in foil and cooked on 170 for 45 mins. It was delicious! will definitely make again, maybe topping with chopped mushrooms next time.

The flavor was fine, but the timing was so off. At 30 minutes it was completely raw. It took at least an hour to cook.

The first time we made this, it was awful. The spinach is so over cooked it is unpalatable.  The second time we made it was much better.  Instead of baking, I pan cooked cubed chicken with garlic and butter, tossed in the pesto to just warm, then the spinach at the last minute - to just wilt the spinach. I used significantly more pesto than 2T - probably closer to 5 or 6. 

Served over fettuccine.

Dinner was on the table in 20 minutes.

Followed the suggestions from other reviewers and added some minced garlic, white wine, and lemon juice to the pesto mix, seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, and added red onions to the layering. Came out delicious! Will definitely make again.

I followed other reviewers suggestions. I added the following: 4T of pesto, 1 clove of garlic chopped & 1 t white wine to the pesto mix. I also added 1/2 a chopped onion, a roasted pepper (chopped), mushrooms and asparagus on top of the chicken.   I'm glad I followed the suggestions.  The added ingredients gave it so much more flavor.

Mine didn't turn out so pretty, but it tasted amazing! I took the advice of the other reviews and add some seasoning to it. This is a great base recipe that you can easily customize to your own taste. I will be making this again!

I have made this recipe so many times!  It's easy and simple to make, and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly the first couple times, but each additional time I made it I added to it.  First I added a lot more pesto and a bit of garlic and marinated the chicken in the pesto.  Other times I added all different veggies I like to the mix (tomatoes, potatoes, and/or carrots) and it was delicious! I have even made it with salmon instead of chicken a couple times.  I love it!

If you make this recipe without heeding the suggestions of reviewers, you will be disappointed. I made it without any changes and I was disappointed with how bland this turned out. I agree with other reviewers that you must season the chicken before adding to the bed of spinach. I added some salt and pepper after the chicken was done and it helped to make it edible, but definitely nothing to write home about. Barely tasted the pesto. Definitely more of a base recipe. Extra ingredients could have kicked it up a notch. The recipe wasn't difficult to follow, just needs some tweaks.

I topped the chicken mixture with sun dried tomatoes, sliced onions, and chickpeas before baking. Sprinkle walnuts on mixture last ten minutes. A fine recipe with an aroma to tantalize the taste buds.

Loved this recipe.  I followed other suggestions and added garlic, salt and pepper to the basil pesto and put the chicken and spinach in a bag with the mixture and let it marinate.  I only had an hour or so but next time I will let it marinate for the entire day.  I placed sliced onion and mushrooms in the pan before pouring the chicken mixture in the pan. My husband ate two chicken breasts.
