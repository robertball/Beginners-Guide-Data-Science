My family LOVES this recipe. My girls are dairy free (sadly) so we just sub out the butter for fake stuff and omit the choc chips. DELICIOUS. A big hit at parties too!

Yummy cookie but not cake like. I would describe it as a brownie cookie. Omitted confectioners sugar because it was omitted from directions.

I make this recipe often for gifts, and it's very popular! I don't add the chocolate chips - with a good quality cocoa, chips are overkill. 

As with any kind of soft-style cookie, the trick is to cook it until the top is just set. It will continue to harden out of the oven, and end up the perfect texture.

I like this recipe a lot. I only add a lit bit of milk (1/8 cup) at the end to soften the dough, so it spreads easily while at the oven. I don't mix the chocolate chips, instead I put five or six of them on top of the dough balls. And the most important thing of all: to bake soft cookies you need to use insulated pan sheet, so the cookies don't burn on the bottom. I don't have insulated pan sheet, so I use 2 regular pans, one on top of each other, then I put a parchment paper. I ake them for 10 minutes only, and then I slide the parchment paper into a cooling rack.

I liked this recipe but based on the reviews, made a few adjustments.  Seeing that in general the dough falls and leaves a crunch cookie, I added about 1/3 cup of peanut butter (I used crunchy). I also put peanuts in mine instead of chocolate chips. I found it also helped to bake at 340 for the ten mins instead of 350 and please make sure your oven rack is in the very top position so that the source of heat isn't right on the bottoms. I did use the confectioners' sugar.  Someone mentioned it wasn't in the directions, but it is. The directions say to sprinkle it on when the cookies were warm. I found it added just the right little extra touch of sweetness. Mine turned out soft and very yummy.

I was very disappointed.  My picky son doesn't like crunchy anything, so I was excited to see a soft chocolate cookie recipe.  This wasn't ANYTHING like cake, it came out thin and crispy.  The ones I took out early fell apart on the the cooling rack and still crisped up when they cooled.

These are the best cookies ever!! So soft and delicious! I followed the recipe except for omitting the chocolate chips (just because i didnt have any!) And i rolled the dough balls in the powdered sugar before baking them. They came out PERFECT and delicious!! I will be making this recipe again and again!!

The only changes I made were that I baked at 340 degrees for 9 minutes. They will seem underbaked but once they cool they will be perfect. Oh and I didn't use the chocolate chips. They taste exactly like my favorite packaged cookies from my childhood - Archway Dutch Cocoa cookies. They are soft, chewy, chocolatey and not too sweet. A sugar coating of some kind is definitely necessary! Also, this recipe made about 50-60 cookies! Will definitely make again!

Everyone in the family liked this cookie! We chilled the dough for 2 hours before rolling into balls and then rolling in the powdered sugar. In doing this, it yielded 4 dozen instead of three! They seem a little flat, so I might try tweaking some of the ingredients next time to get them to be a puffy cookie, which is what I was looking for this time.  The taste is very good.  Oh...did not use the chocolate chips.

When I made these, they stuck so bad to the cookie sheets I now have them soaking so I can try to get them off.  Maybe grease the sheets?  I don't know how others get them off, but I have one sheet I don't know if I can save.  They taste ok, but what a disappointment as I was making them to give away and have maybe a couple that came off in one piece.  I sure won't be giving these away. Horrible!

Fantastic cookies. Got rave reviews with the work crowd.  I made the batter and divided it into three bowls before adding chips, then used mint chips, white choc chips and peanut butter chips.  A variety of cookies from one recipe!

Thanks for the recipe - this is my goto chocolate cookie recipe.  I followed the recipe as written (forgot the powdered sugar!!) and they came out great.  Bonus points - boyfriend gave them the thumbs up.

Good easy recipe, it was probably my finicky oven but mine came out little over done and not so "soft", but I'll definitely try it again. (A few seconds in the microwave and they were still delicious!) Used dark chocolate chips as it was all I had and they were my favorite part.

Just pulled these out of oven and couldn't wait to try them.wish I had before dusting with confectioners sugar, they don't need it at all! Still really good though, I left out choc chips, and they taste like brownies.yum.

Good base recipe. Definitely needs some tweaks to make it workable for me. My dough was very moist causing cookies to spread super thin. My next batch I'll be cutting back the butter, adding a little more flour.

I rarely bake but I can follow recipes. I'm surprised nobody wrote anything about it calling for 2 inch size balls - you'd never get 3 doz cookies that way and they'd come out the size of cake plates. I made them 1/2 inch in size and baked according to the directions. I still had to add at least 3 min baking time because they initially came out raw in the middle. Flavor was good, but too much butter

This was my first time making cookies (and they were by myself w/out any observation) and they turned out GREAT! I even put them in for 13 minutes and they were PERFECT! 
I think these were easy and good treats!

Soft, chocolatey and delicious! These cookies could easily be made into brownies when made right! I baked the first batch on ungreased aluminum foil on a cookie sheet; these came out super chewy and were almost falling apart. If you want that degree of softness, bake them on foil and let them cool for at least ten minutes on the pan before you move them to the wire rack so they don't fall apart.

The second batch I baked on parchment paper, and they were significantly firmer when I moved them to the wire rack. I didn't have to let them cool as long in the pan.  Still soft on the inside though!

I'm going to use this as a base recipe in the future for chocolate peanut butter cookies and maybe try to make a copycat recipe for Le Vain/Insomnia Cookies in NYC. Yummy!

These were good but I, of course, made a few tweaks.  1 cup is a boatload of butter/margarine so I used 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 of canola oil.  I used a stone and a cookie sheet to bake them on.  The cookies on the metal cookie sheet came out flat but still ok.  The ones on the stone stayed fluffier.  With the stone though, I took it out after 10 minutes and they were still doughy.  It sat for 10 minutes waiting for the next batch and then I put them in again for 5 minutes.  They turned out awesome. I also left out the chocolate chips and these are more than chocolaty enough.

They are the best! Soft and chewy like cookie/cake/brownie all in one. So good, even with out the chips!

Great, easy cookie!  I tried Andes mint chips instead of chocolate chips and they were great!
