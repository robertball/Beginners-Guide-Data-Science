I followed the directions exactly with exception to adding the lemon extract; I didn't have any, so I just left it out.  This dessert is just delicious...not too sweet and very quick to put together.  Only one other point to mention is that I used frozen blueberries (which I didn't thaw first) and as a result, the cake took about 65 minutes to cook.

This recipe was superb! It was moist and delicious. The only changes I made were to use frozen blueberries and 1/2tsp of lemon juice since I didn't have any lemon extract.  A keeper for sure.

This was wonderful I thought.  Not too sweet, just perfect.  My grandmother just loved it and she really doesn't even like blueberries.
I used fresh blueberries!  I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon juice and doubled what it called for.  I also tossed the blueberries in lemon juice before I added them to the mixture.  Wonderful!!!  Thank you!

This was a great recipe idea for blueberry's, if you're tired of the muffins & pies. I used Splenda in place of all the sugar and it turned out great!

I don't know how other reviewers got results that they describe as "dry" and "bland". I made this today and it came out SO moist and tasty. I used orange extract since I didn't have lemon, and frozen berries. Love it. Will make it again. The two different layers are both delicious and it formed a yummy crust all around. It's just my husband and I so we have left overs we'll have for breakfast tomorrow for sure. Can't wait!

Very good recipe to start with.  I used raspberries as hubs does not like blueberries.  Once I placed the bottom layer in, I arranged the raspberries over top evenly.  While making the top layer, I combined everything in a large bowl, then used my immersion blender to 'whip' the batter to a smooth consistency, elminating the 'gritty' texture of the ricotta.  End result, a nice, smooth, moist coffee cake type dessert.  Absolutely perfect! I did double the lemon extract as per other reviewers saying it didn't taste lemony enough. Next time I will try it with butter in place of the shortening. I also used reduced fat ricotta.

I'm not really a "baker," more of a "cooker," but this sounded good & simple enough.  I followed the recipe exactly, but for some reason it didn't brown right on the top.  It browned in one spot in the middle of the pan, and about an inch out all the way around the pan, but the rest of it kinda remained uncooked looking.  We tasted the parts around the edges, that actually looked like it was the way it was suppose to be and it was ok.  A little bland.  I still have leftover blueberries, so now I'm going to try my luck with a Blueberry Buckle recipe that I found on this site.  I'm crossing my fingers that my baking skills will improve with this next attempt!!

I used butter in place of the shortening and part skim ricotta.  I misread the recipe and used 1 1/2 cup of ricotta for the topping, but I kept the sugar as written and used 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I was concerned the top would be too crisp so I turned the oven down to 325 and covered the pan with foil for the last 20 minutes.  We liked the flavors, found it moist and light, reminiscent of Italian cheesecake.  I can see lots of possibiliries with the base recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for something different to make with the rest of the blueberries I had in the fridge, and this recipe was great.  I had to make a couple substitutions with what I had on hand. I used 1 tsp of lemon juice in place of the lemon extract and cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I used only 1 cup of blueberries and chopped up 1 banana. I forgot to put the blueberries on top of the first mixture and ended up just mixing the blueberries and banana in with the second mixture. I also used an 8x8 pan since I didn't have a 9x9 pan. I did bake it for 55 minutes and the top of it was very dark, but not at all burnt.  This wasn't too sweet or too bland at all. It was perfect. I think next time, I will only use 1 beaten egg. I could taste more egg than the rest of the ingredients from the 2nd mix.   I really enjoyed this recipe and it turned out great even with the substitutes I had to make. I will definately make this again. I may try this next time with other kinds of fruit like peaches, cherries or pineapple!

This is a great recipe. I grow blueberries so I am always looking for another way to use them. The cake is very moist and the taste of the blueberries really comes out. The only change I made was to add 1/2 t cinnamon to the ricotta mixture.

This was pretty good-maybe a little dry, but I did substitute whole wheat flour.

Lovely moist dessert except I will not use lemon flavoring - lots of lemon zest instead.   One reviewer substituted wholewheat flour - in something like this that is not a good idea because this flour is drying to start with.   Every now and then it is okay to be a little sinful and this is one time it is worth it.

This is a very tasty cake. I give it 4 starts because it is a bit too sweet for my taste.
I followed the instructions except for the shortening, I used unsalted butter instead. I plan to make it again but I will use 1/4 c sugar and add increase the ricotta amount.

Delicious! And very forgiving! I made several substitutions because of what I lacked/had on hand (prune butter for shortening, confectioners&brown sugars for white sugar) and it was still moist, fluffy and phenomenal. My preschooler, 6-year old, and teenager all asked for seconds.

Wonderful! I found this recipe easy to make and delicious. It was made according to the directions with the exception of using w/w flour and raw sugar as this is all I had on hand but it still came out great. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

10.29.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/65071/blueberry-ricotta-squares/ ... 'Read lots of reviews & only changed one thing - one less egg with the ricotta.  That's unusual for this girl.  :)  This was good.  I'm not an "Ooooh, lemon!" or an "I hate lemon" person, but I had the extract & added the half teaspoon listed.  It wasn't overpowering, but not so subtle as I thought it would be.  It's so lemony that I think it should be in the name.  If I make again, I'll reduce it or replace with vanilla.  With the one egg with the ricotta, I'm thinking two would make it quite dry - the ricotta part.  It's not creamy at all with just one.  I've played with ricotta & eggs before.  :D  It isn't a "looker" for sure, but a little sifted confectioners sugar does wonders for this lessthanattractive dish - & a little more sweet doesn't make it too sweet either.  Next day: Sprinkle w confectionary sugar just before serving or realize that overnight the sugar will disappear on the unbrowned surface & look like mold on the browned parts.  :o  'Not caring for this one.  It's not flavorless, just not so good - at least to this reviewer. It sounded so good.  :(

made exactly as written and this recipe was delicious.  my husband said it was just the right mix of cake and custard (the ricotta-egg topper).  use fresh grated lemon peel if you don't have lemon extract.

I used rice milk just because we don't drink cow's milk, and fat-free ricotta because that's what we use.  All else was the same.  I was disappointed that I couldn't taste the lemon extract, but the coffee cake itself tasted sweet and creamy.  I noticed the blueberries sank right to the bottom during cooking, even though the batter looked thick enough to hold them when I mixed it.  Just FYI.  Also, the ricotta mixture sunk down into the other layers as well, which was unexpected but tasty.  THIS IS NOT A CHEESECAKE recipe, folks.  Don't expect anything like a cheesecake and you won't be disappointed.

These are awesome! Me and my 6yo made them and I loved them (he wouldn't try them, go figure) we had to make a few adjustments for what we had on hand. We used lemon juice which we doubled for the lemon extract and I was short 1/4 cup of ricotta so we threw the ricotta with 1/4 cup of cottage cheese in the mini food processor and ground it up. Worked out very well for us and this is a good recipe if you have some extra blueberries on hand.

These were excellent with the following changes:  For those who said the bottom crust was dry - be SURE and beat this batter as directed - 1 minute on low and 1 minute on medium.  Then, I used 1 16 oz bag of frozen blueberries (partially thawed), 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup of Ricotta and 3/4 cup Mascarpone cheese.  Baked in 9 x13 at 350 for exactly 52 minutes.  Also - use lemon extract instead of juice, the flavor pops!  These were yummy and moist.

Yummy.  I added a little extra sugar because some people said it was bland but I don't think I even needed to.  We couldn't wait for them to cool before eating them but they were great right out of the oven!

Very good. I just made this recipe substituting butter for shortening. The cake part is my favorite, but I'm a liitle disapointed in the toping. It wasn't as creamy as I had hoped. My room mate loves it though. All in all a good recipe. Thanks!

Sorry but we did not enjoy this recipe very much.  We did not think it was dry but we just were not thrilled with the taste.  Thanks for letting us try.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. Personally, I liked it though I do think it was too dry. My husband didn't care for it. My friend loved it--he said it was a cross between coffee cake and a cheese Danish. So three different reviews from three people. My only change was to use almond extract instead of the lemon flavor.

Fantastic! I did make a few changes due to the other reviews, they were;
1. changed shorteneing for butter, and sprinkled sugar once removing from over, and dusted with icing sugar.  I am the worst cood when it comes to sweets, and even my family were amazed.  This will be a signature receipe on mine from now on, Thank you

Loved this one! Mom, brother and husband all loved it to. I did not have the lemon extract so I used juice instead. Used butter instead of shortening and frozen blueberries. Usually the first time I cook any of these recipes I don't change anything but this time I didn't have the correct stuff. Really good and better the next day. Thanks, it will be made again and again.

These were delish. I only had a cup of ricotta left and used what I had. It worked out fine.
The texture was moist. The blueberries did not sink and overall taste was worth making again.
Oops almost forgot, I used the juice of one fresh lemon instead of the lemon extract. Maybe that helped giving it 5 stars!

Very good coffeecake that is not too sweet.  I followed the ingredients expect I did not have lemon extract so I added a little lemon oil only a drop and a little dried lemon zest.  It was perfect. Will make again.

I used butter instead of shortening, vanilla instead of lemon, and nectarines instead of blueberries. My family loved it, I hated it. Certainly nothing even remotely "cheesecake" about it which was a letdown for me.

Made these exactly and they came out very yummy! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for 60 min. It only browned around the edges but didn't affect the taste.  I will make these again!

I thought it was dry, but i'm not a very good baker, so it was probably my fault. Generally i thought it was pretty bland, but i used dried blueberries (what i had on hand) so maybe they didn't give as much to the flavor game as fresh ones would have.

Sorry, I probably won't make this dish again. I subbed butter for the shortening and used vanilla instead of lemon extract, but we all had one serving and the rest gotten eaten up by the disposal. There are better blueberry recipes!

We did not enjoy this recipe very much. It was very dry. I think it has a great idea, but I need to make some adjustments...I just am not sure what. I think if you make a sauce for this, for instance blueberries poached in orange juice with a little sugar, it might be ok, it just didn't have tons of flavor by itself. If you give it a try, make some changes and you might get something great!

I didn’t have lemon extract so used 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  This did remind me a bit of a cheese danish.  I should have used lemon zest since I had a lemon on hand but usually try to make recipes as written the first time, before I make any changes.

This was good.  I made as directed, including the lemon extract which really complemented the blueberries.  It did take about 15 minutes longer to bake (probably needed another 20 minutes, really) maybe because I used frozen blueberries.

This recipe is delicious! I was looking for a recipe with ricotta, as i had a lot leftover after making a lasagna. I was a little worry it seems to call for a lot of sure, but No its perfect!! Unfortunately i did not wait for my blueberries to thaw completely which made my cake a bit wet, but i will def make it again with fresh blueberries!

I just made this for breakfast this morning.  As with most recipes, I reduced the sugar by half, used whole wheat flour, olive oil for the shortening and real lemon zest.  Also...I live in a small town in Mexico  where blueberries are virtually unknown, so I used dried cranberries and pecan pieces instead.  All that said, it turned out yummy and I will make it again..maybe with diced mango instead of blueberries.

Absolutely delicious.   Used lemon peel from 1 lemon because I didn't have lemon extract.

Does it have to be refrigerated?
Thank you

I tried this recipe because I had left over ricotta cheese.  It turned out really good!  I substituted white sugar with brown and mixed cottage cheese with the ricotta.  It is a good recipe to be able to exchange ingredients & create a new taste everytime

Finally...exactly what I needed. Have been buying fresh sweet cherries like a madwoman. Even splurged on a cherry pitter (OXO, fabulous). Have made a couple muffin recipes and several batches of Cherry Compote for the freezer (David Leibovitz's recipe). Have been trying to find some sort of cake to use the cherries in (seems like they all use pie filling). Gave up on that and decided to find a recipe to use the last cup of ricotta cheese I had. Came across this recipe and thouht...why not try with fresh cherries. So I subbed chopped cherries for the blueberries and almond extract (1/4 tsp) for the lemon extract and for the vanilla (1/4 tsp). Just took it out of the oven and had a piece while still warm. It is heavenly. Glad I cut down on the almond extract in the bottom layer. Just right. The top did not brown evenly (as mentioned by another reviewer). I think that is just the way that combo of eggs and ricotta does. Well, off to get another piece! ;-)) then off to the store for more ricotta. I do have blueberries to use up!

I really liked it, I only had an 8x8 baking dish. So I had to let it bake almost 15-20 longer. Other than that it is a pleasant treat. It is a very pretty dessert. Thanks for posting.

Easy, delicious and elegant. I've made it about 6 times now and it's great as is. I've been out of ricotta and substituted a mix of Greek yogurt & cream cheese--acceptable in a pinch. Dust squares with powdered sugar immediately prior to serving for extra appeal.

This was a great way to use up some fresh organic blueberries- yummy!   Cake is very moist and delicious.
Love the way the ricotta settles in :)   The only thing I changed was to use almond milk and it was perfect. Will make again for friends.

Really good and not dry at all! I used 1/2C. organic cane sugar in the bottom part plus lemon zest and juice instead of extract and butter instead of shortening. I only used one egg in the top part. I also mixed the top part in the food processor to get it really nice and creamy. FYI the bottom batter was VERY thick and difficult to mix with a handheld mixer.

I've made this easy-to-make desert twice now.   I like it because its not to sweet and doesn't have a bunch of flavors competing for your taste buds.  The second time I made it, I served it warm with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream topped with fresh macerated blueberries.

Taste was great! The top later tasted custardy to me. It took a lot longer to cook then what I had expected. I had a hard time getting the middle done without burning the edges. It was still wonderful!

Since some said the cake was not sweet enough, I added extra sugar in both the bottom batter (used 1 cup total) and the ricotta batter (used 1/2 cup total). I also sprinkled some on top of the cake before placing in oven to give it a crunchy top.  I also used frozen blueberries since some said it was dry.  With these changes, I thought it was sweet and it was very moist.  As far as sweetness goes, it is a matter of preference.  I think I would have liked it with less sugar also.

Sorry, didn't live up to my expectations after reading the other rave reviews. Too vaguely sweet & bland -- no real taste of its own (to me). Still, happy I tried it and thank you for posting it.
