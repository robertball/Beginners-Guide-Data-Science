This is a very good dish. The crepes were rather eggy. Next time, I’ll use two eggs instead of three. I used gluten free flour, which has never been an issue with other crepes recipes that I have converted. Regardless, the chicken filling is delicious. I wrapped the crepes in packets tying them with kitchen twine to serve them for a party. They were easier to dip into guacamole that way. I used Sarah's Easy Shredded Chicken Taco Filling.  Thank you for the recipe.

Saw this and thought it sounded good.  Decided to make it one night and took the hamburger out to thaw.  Well getting ready to make dinner and gathering the ingredients and looking up the recipe, big oops, not hamburger but chicken!  Well, as my husband says, they aren't recipes for you they are just guidelines.  So I made it with the beef, threw in chopped black olives, can of enchilada sauce, can of chilies, some kidney beans, sour cream, cheese, spices and used that for the filling for the crepes.  It was delicious.  My husband raved and put it on his top ten list.  Okay, so the only thing I didn't change were the crepes, but the crepes tasted so good with this, bet they taste good with the chicken, too.:-)

Taste good, but hubby didn't like the hassle making the crepes. He said he'd make these again only if using a different crepe recipe. We topped with tomato & guac, but you really only need one if anything. Hubs had to make a 2nd recipe of the crepes to use up the filling which I still thought was more than needed in each.

Perfect low carb, high protein meal! I had so much fun making this...my first crepes! I ruined the first 2 but the others were creamy and smooth. I put one huge chicken breast in my crockpot overnight for the chicken. I used 2 Tb of canned, chopped jalapenos instead of fresh AND I doubled the spices and the onions then sprinkled sliced black olives over the tops. I served it with taco sauce and sour cream. My brother and I love, love, loved this!

That's how I make my oven-baked Chimichangas!  The homemade tortillas are extra work, but they're worth the effort!

I bought the pre-made crepes which were a little sweeter than I liked but the overall taste was wonderful!

It was good, but I’m wondering if rolling it in a low carb tortilla may have been just as good and easier. I added cayenne pepper and smoked paprika to the chicken mix. I would have also liked to have served it with salsa and sour cream on top. It is something I would make again.
