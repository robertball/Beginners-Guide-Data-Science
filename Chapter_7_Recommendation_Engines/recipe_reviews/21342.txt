My taste buds are still dancing!!!! This dish was fantastic even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I couldn't put the carrots in because I'm allergic, didn't have water chestnuts, didn't have pimento, so I subbed with a small can of green chilies. I threw in some garlic and onions powders along with a little cayenne for a bit of a kick. The Ritz cheese crackers I had seemed to work well. In lieu of cheddar I used grated parm. Even without the suggested ingredients, this recipe was superb. My youngest daughter didn't even bother with the hamburgers my hubby made. No leftovers! (darn) Thanks so much!!!!

I made this last night for our annual family Christmas party.  My cynical relatives (especially the men) turned their noses up when they heard the list of ingredients, but they ate their words - and my ENTIRE dish - once it was on the table.  It was voted the best dish of the day!  My only note is that it definitely does not take only 10 minutes to prepare and I had to cook it about twice the length of time the recipe called for.  It turned out perfectly though!

I followed the recipe exactly.The mayonnaise & cream of mushroom soup completely take over the flavor of this recipe. Neither my boyfriend or I cared this recipe.  How sad. Was nothing like other yummy squash casserole dishes i have enjoyed in the past. bummer (update) i just wanted to add, that i am still teased about making this recipe, my  boyfriend refers to is as that 'hot mayonaisse casserole thing'.

Sauteed instead of boiled, to keep all the vitamins and flavor.  No green onions on hand, doubled zucchini, halved melted butter.  Not sure if the pimentos added anything, so I may leave them out next time.  Used reduced fat crackers, mayo and soup.  Crunchy, creamy, cheesy, crispy - yum.

I've made this several times and it's always turned out well, whether I made it for three or thirty (and yes, I DID make it for thirty).  I've played around with the ingredients, but it's best with only a little extra squash.  Definitely keep the water chestnuts, pimientos, and especially the Ritz crackers -- it's not as good with any other kind.  I've not made it in awhile because it's a better winter recipe, but I'm looking forward to having it again.

Another great recipe! I served this to a husband and 2 preschoolers who don't like squash, and it was a huge hit! I've made it twice, and the second time I was almost out of "buttery round crackers", so I used some saltines. DON'T DO IT! It was not nearly as good...I ended up throwing almost half of it away.:) Moral is: USE the Buttery Crackers!

One word - AWESOME!  A staple for the summer dinner table.  This recipe uses much from the summer garden/farmer's market and packs a big punch.  You have the great flavor and the bonus of the value of serving several healthy veggies in one appealing casserole.  I have shared this with several friends and family members and it has received only raves.  Stop what you are doing and add this one to your recipe box...it's a keeper!
Note:  To save time you can boil the veggies and seperately mix the wet ingredients the night before.  The next day just combine and add the crackers and you can speed up the process.

Yum! I love it! I did leave out the water chestnuts and pimento peppers just for personal preference of taste.

This was by far one of the best squash recipes I've found.  I could've eaten the whole dish myself!  I too left out the pimento peppers.  I will be making this often.  Thanks Meli for sharing this recipe!

Family & friends really love this.  Be sure to drain cooked squash well, or it will be too wet.  I added mushrooms, and used Cheez-Its in the crust.  Great for Holiday meals, and ingredients are inexpensive.   You really ought to make this.

My new favorite squash casserole recipe! With a few small modifications, this is a 5 star recipe. On the suggestions of previous reviewers I eliminated the pimentos and increased the amount of squash. I sauteed the veggies rather than boiling them in water, and then put them in a colander lined with paper towels to let them drain really well for a couple of hours. I subbed out low-fat sour cream for mayo. For the topping, I used light butter and used reduced fat cheddar cheese. It turned out awesome! My boyfriend and I ate the entire pan of this over the course of 3 days, and still would happily have eaten more! I will be making this again soon!

Used stove top dressing inside of crackers. Omitted the sage.Reduced butter by half. Used liquid from veggies to moisten the dressing. Used low fat cheese. I thought it was great.  Next time I will try the crackers but frankly all the fat in the crackers and butter is a llittle scary!

I followed the suggestion to saute the veggies in olive oil. This recipe is the greatest way I've ever found to fix my summer squashes.

This was wonderful!  I had guests this weekends and served this.  Even the 18yr old loved it and went back for thirds.  I didn't  have waterchesnuts, so omitted them.  I also put some dill and tumeric in, and added about 1/2 cup fat free sour cream.  The soup was 98% ft free, and the maynaise was aslo low fat, and it still wwas a winner.  Will definately make this again.

ive made this a few times and loved it!  i only changed a few things...  i left out the pimento peppers(not a fan), i used 2 cans of water chestnuts(i love the crunch), and i added extra squash, and made sure that the zucchini was the same amount as the squash.  also, i use about 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic(lovvvve garlic) and added garlic salt instead of regular salt, i also add about a teaspoon of fresh ground peppercorn instead of white.  i added about 1 1/2 cup shredded colby jack(dont like cheddar unless in cheesey potatoes), and i used 4 tablespoons of butter and a quarter cup of mayo.  thats just way too much in my opinion, especially the mayo.  i agree with a few comments that its too crumby, so i only make half the crumb mixture and put it on top.

This was just okay in my book. Maybe if you add more squash to it, it would be better. Too much sauce for my taste, and not enough veggies.

I have an AR cookbook with this recipe and have made this numerous times over the past few years.  It is absolutely delicious!  Very easy to adjust to ingredients on hand.  I like to chop the water chestnuts.  Great Recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I find it to be even better the next day as the flavors blend. I did not have pimentos but will make sure I do next time.

I chose this recipe because it had so many 5 star reviews.  I was looking forward to a great-tasting dish, but I have to say I was disappointed.  I thought this was very average which surprises me because I almost always agree with the reviews.  My husband wasn't impressed either.  Won't make this again.  Sorry Meli.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!
My 6-year-old and meat-n-potatoes husband both said it was "AWESOME".  I too sauteed the step 1 items in olive oil instead of boiling and used fresh red bell pepper (about 2 ounces diced) instead of pimentos.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!!!

Wonderful side dish! I did not cook the vegetables in the water as directed. I sauted the first 4 ingredients in a tablespoon of olive oil in a large covered saute pan until tender and drained off any liquid. I proceeded as directed for the rest of the recipe. 
thanks to this recipe I'm planting squash in my garden this year!!  Mmm, Mmm, good!! Thanks for sharing Meli!

This was okay, but to cut down on the salt and hold it together I would reduce the soup content and add an egg or two.

Looks like the zucchini bake that my MIL made for our annual family Pre-Christmas party, minus the onions.  It was fantastic!  I will definitely be making this myself for the family.  Delish!

Really enjoyed this dish! I did add a diced turkey kielbasa sausage for my carnivore family. :) The sausage, cheese, and crackers added a really nice flavor for the non-veggie fans in the family. Will definitely be making this again!

This is the best!  I have been making this for several years and always get asked for the recipe.

Update: I have adjusted amounts over the years, just for personal preference.  I use twice as much squash (sauteed), same amount of soup mixture,  half of the butter/crumb mixture, just because I don't like too much crust.  I do like the other vegetables, but it doesn't hurt the taste to leave out what you don't have or don't like.

I really loved this casserole!  I sauteed the veggies instead of boiling them.  I substituted crushed seasoned stuffing mix for the crackers. I didn't have the water chestnuts for crunch, so I left the carrots chunky and they gave a nice texture.

I prepared this to take to a labor day cook out.  I was so embarrassed!  The dish was like half cooked and runny.  I followed the recipes exactly but this definately needs to cook longer and needs something to bind.  Would not make again!

I served this on Christmas Day to a family that doesn't eat much squash or zucchini.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  The family ate up most of it and loved that it was something different from the usual green bean or spinach casserole.  I used steam in the bag zucchini and squash to save a step of par boiling them and then cut them up into quarters.  It is also a very attractive dish to serve with all the various colored vegetables in it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I just made a test recipe for Thanksgiving and this is my new squash dish.  I added extra squash and zucchini as it looked like there was too much sauce for my original quantity of veggies.  That may be what happened to you, Cristin.  I did sautee the veggies in a little butter and olive oil.  Added a little red pepper while sauteeing.  Otherwise, made as directed.  The dish came out better than expected.  Five stars!!

WOW!  I made this multiple times this summer to "use up" all of the extra veggies we were getting from out crop share.  Delicious every time.  I even made an extra casserole and put it in the freezer.  It bakes up just fine once it is thawed as well.

best squash recipe on the planet!!! I've made it as written and with some minor substitutions based on what I had on hand and both ways came out excellent! I made this last night and used sour cream instead of mayo, I also used one sleeve of crushed ritz which did not make two cups (more like 1 1/2 give or take) so I made up the remaining 1/2 cup with equal amounts of panko and Parmesan cheese. I used 2 diced roasted red peppers in place of the pimentos as I happened to have a jar in the house. I also used chopped fresh sage and thyme which gave an awesome flavor. My final modification was to use less butter, I cut it down to 4 Tbls and that was plenty. Oh and be sure to use the water chestnuts as they make the dish. Try this dish you will love it!!!

I first saw this recipe in Southern Living magazine back in 1998 and loved it! The only thing that I change when making it is the cream of mushroom soup; I use cream of chicken instead and it gives it a really good flavor.

I rated this 5 stars because I think it is an awesome recipe, but also because my friend's dad thought it was really good too (he is the head of the culinary dept at a college here)!  I've made it two years in row for Thanksgiving and I didn't change a thing...VERY GOOD!

This is a wonderful side dish.  I used all the ingredients as listed and changed the cooking method only slightly.  I sauteed the onion in a small amount of butter instead of boiling with the squash.  I also used a peeler on the carrot to make long "ribbons" of carrot.  I put the carrots in the strainer before draining the squash which seemed to cook the carrot just enough.  My family loved this dish and the five of us almost ate the whole thing!

Delicious! I was wary of the peppers and water chesnuts but the peppers added a nice zip and the chestnuts a good texture. I forgot the carrots and didn't have sage but I added some herbs de provence which complemented the flavors very well!

Very rich side dish.  I sauteed the vegetables, including carrots, in 1/4 cup water and about three tablespoons butter before folding them into the soup mix. I also used seasoned salt instead of regualr salt.  This is definitely something I will make again.  Thanks for sharing :0)

This is colorful and yummy!  I wasn't sure about the pimento but it works great with it.  I would also think you could substitute roasted red peppers for the pimento.  A very good squash recipe that doesn't taste like all those "squash casserole" type recipes.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous, as usual I did not have some of the ingredients but this is a VERY forgiving recipe, I substituted broccoli florets for yellow squash and broccoli cheese soup for mushroom soup and added pkg saute'd sliced mushrooms
also I had 2 ears of corn left over and sliced them off cob and added. 
my guests all but licked the dish!!!
I used all of the crackers,but,put them only on top.

Holy moly, was this ever good!  I also skipped the boiling process, and sauteed the veggies until tender crisp.  I also skipped the pimentos, as they didn't appeal to me, and I knew the kids would refuse to eat it.  It was the best way we've used our zucchini so far.  I would have eaten it as a main dish.  My younger one wouldn't eat it, and my 9 yr old ate it, but didn't run for seconds.  My husband and my mother both ate seconds and there was hardly anything left.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was disappointed that the vegetables turned almost to mush.  My husband liked it anyway, but I think I'll sauté the vegetables next time instead of boiling them.

Whew! This was spectacular! Can't say enough good things about this recipe! I did change it slightly in order to suit our needs. I did not add the carrots or water chestnuts. Instead, I added mushrooms. For the extra *kick*, I added garlic powder and cayenne pepper. The flavors blended so well ~ simply delish! This is a keeper for sure!

Basically good but I thought a bit salty.  The mushroom soup seems to be a bit overpowering.... but after saying that - my 9 month old loves it!

All the reviews are right.  This was fantastic.  I added almonds instead of water chestnuts and omitted the pimentos because my husband hates them.  This is definately a new family favorite for Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc....

What a great sidedish. I made this for the first time~Easter Dinner, April, 20, 2003. 
 I have 5 children, two who don't eat meat. This casserole was perfect for the family members who are vegeterians. I had to modify recipe for 9- I will make this again and again. Thanks

I assumed this recipe would be soggy because of the squash.  Boy was I wrong!  This was one of the best veggie dishes I've ever made.  It was a hit at our Christmas dinner last night, the dish was scraped clean.  I love this recipe.

Great casserole!  Water chestnuts add a delightful crunch.  Very healthy, tasty, and easy to make.  Shared some with my next-door neighbors and they and their kids loved it and asked for the recipe!

The casserole turned out pretty good although I omitted the pimentos and carrots. I think next time I will omit the water chestnuts too. We like just basic veggie casseroles. I did put in a little extra squash and zucchini, but not much. Love the ritz crumbles!

I made this for a pot luck at work and it was very well liked.  A number of people asked for the recipe and one person told me it was the best thing on the table (and I thought there were some tasty dishes there).  The only changes I made were omitting the salt, adding a tablespoon of garlic power and pretty much doubled the cheese.  After reading comments that said it was too wet, I made sure to drain the vegetables.  I think great additions would be mushrooms and fresh green beans.  I'll be making this again.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  My family loved it!  I used last years yellow and zucchini squash that I had sliced and frozen!  Getting ready for this years crop!  I let the squash thaw in the collander and squeezed the water out before I used some other readers recommendations and cooked the squash and onions in olive oil instead of water.  I did not have water chestnuts or cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken and it was still great!  The cheese I had was cheddar and monterey jack!  I also only had the mayonaise wiith olive oil and black pepper.  This is a very versitile recipe.

I'm new to allrecipes.com & the first recipe I tried was the Calico Squash Casserole.  I've never made a casserole with 16 ingredients.  It was wonderful.

This is an excellent way to use up squash. I left out the peppers and water chestnuts. Made some cornbread stuffing and mixed it with the left over crackers and added cheese. I should have added some corn. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a wonderul recipe! My fiance' begged me to make this a second time! I changed it up just a bit and used french fried onions for 1/4 of the crumb mixture and also cooked the veggies a bit longer than what it said. The only suggestion I would make is that you must prepare more time for prep. Prep is NOT 10 minutes, its more like 30 unless you buy all your veggies cut already! WONDERFUL RECIPE!

I really enjoyed this dish.  It did take a lot longer than 10 minutes to prepare but I think it was worth it. I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

This is a great recipe!  I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, and left out the pimentos.  I also sliced the carrots instead of shredding them, and cooked them with the squash.  Be sure to definitely drain the cooked squash very well.  Not only was this really tasty, it was pretty!

This recipe was ok, I found there to be too much water chestnuts and not enough squash and zucchini.  Next time I would try it with half the amount of water chestnust and an extra cup each of squash and zucchini, and cut the mayo in half.

I gave this 4 stars because I knew what the ingredients were (ie fat content)and made it anyway so I couldn't give it a 3 like I want to. My main complaint is how unhealty this is with the cheese, mushroom soup and mayo, butter and crackers.  The flavor was good. The cheesy cracker topping delish. There was a definite zip and my 1 year old ate it all up.  I just like to see a little more vegetable when I am eating vegetables!  So I guess I would add more zukes if I were to make this again.

Really hearty and delicious recipe...perfect for the fall.  My boyfriend really loved this dish. I used half the amout of sour cream called for, just because I don't like a "tangy" casserole taste.  This casserole is really flexible, so if you don't have all of the ingredients, give it a try any way. I wouldn't sub out the ritz crackers, though, they really make this dish!

This was delicious.  I intentionally left out the cream of mushroom soup though.  It's just too much when you also have mayo.  Also left off the crackers.  Will definitely make this again!

I have to say it was good.  I loved the crunch of the buttery crackers and the creamy consistency of the dish.  I didn't have water chestnuts, pimento's or carrots, so I just left them out.  I did add chopped green olives to replace the pimento's and it added extra zing. . .but I think I will leave those out as well when I try this again.

For those who are worried about the fat in this recipe, I used reduced fat club crackers, low fat mayo and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and couldn't tell the difference in the finished dish.

This was THE best squash casserole I've ever had. My husband couldn't say enough about it. The pimentos are a must as they add a great flavor to the dish. I added a little more squash than the recipe called for and cooked the veggies in olive oil rather than water. I also put a little more of the crumbs on the bottom. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

This is seriously the best squash casserole I have ever tasted!  It's really a wonderful and refreshing change from the usual, with lots of different ingredients.  We served with grilled chicken and a green salad....delicious!  Made exactly like the recipe said and it turned out great, wouldn't change a thing.  A little labor intensive, but WELL worth it!

Made this for Thanksgiving--it was a big hit. This is the perfect holiday side dish as it is colorful,easy and delicious.  Will definitely make again. I did saute the veggies in olive oil rather than boiling.

Excellent recipe.  Because I was out of them I made the following very acceptable substitutions: a can of drained corn in place of the water chestnuts, cream of celery soup in place of cream of mushroom soup and seasoned bread crumbs in place of the Ritz-type cracker crumbs.  I used a 2-ounce jar of chopped pimentos and they added great color contrast.  Next time I'll probably opt for the 4-ounce jar and leave out the carrots!

All in all, this was great!  I did make a couple changes, though.  Sauteed the veggies instead of boiling them so they had more of a crunch, as was sugessted by someone earlier, and I also used regular saltines instead of the ritz-type crackers and it was incredible.  The pimentoes, when used in the correct amount, add a wonderful flavor.  Also added 3 cloves of garlic to the sauteed veggies.

This recipe is pure deliciousness. I used fresh red bell pepper that I had on hand instead of pimientos, and used half the butter called for in the recipe to lighten it up a bit, and it was fabulous. I'll definitely make this again.

To the person below who rated this recipe 1 star, and everyone else thinking of trying this recipe....the recipe calls for HALF of a 4 ounce jar of pimentos, not the WHOLE jar.

YIKES!  After so many wonderful reviews, I hate to give this a one star, but I thought it tasted terrible.  A 4 oz jar of pimento just overwhelmed this dish and made the only thing rather funky!  Sorry, but I'll be deleting this from my recipe box.

My neighbor gave us a bunch of yellow squash and zucchini, and I was looking for a new way to use them.  I thought this recipe was very good, but my husband didn't care for it (he found a small piece of mushroom from the soup and then refused to eat it).  I don't like water chestnuts and didn't have pimento peppers, so I left them out.  It still turned out yummy - but I wish there had been more cracker crust!  (I'll make more next time.)  This is definitely something I'd make again.

This recipe is just wonderful.  I love it, love it, love it.  I made it with no adjustments, just like it's written.  My husband thought it was yummy too.  Definitely a keeper.

Quite good. I would use at least twice as much squash/zucchini, to make it a little lighter. Water chestnuts are essential, as are the Ritz crackers.

Very good recipe. I used almonds instead of water chesnuts but left everything else the same. It does take a while to prepare but so worth it.

Wonderful!! I make this disch for potlucks often. People who don't like squash still like the it. I make extra crumbs to add more to the top layer. You won't be disappointed for trying. It's lso very easy to make.

I made this calico squash casserole for the first time on Easter Sunday. It was a big hit. Everyone loved it even most of the grandkids. I was asked by a few family members for the recipe. Now it will become a favorite at family gatherings.

This looked beautiful and my future mother in law loved it! I thought it was good, but I am not fond of sage, so I would definitely use less or eliminate it next time. My fiance says it's okay, but not as good as other squash casseroles that he's had. I plan to make it again and see how it turns out with minor adjustments.

What a great way to use up the garden zucchini !!  Had most of the ingredients (except pimentos, you can always put in fresh red bell peppers if you need the color, and yellow squash) and used Tex Mex blend for the cheese.  It's especially good when the cheese gets all crusty.  It's even better the next day !!  Definitely a go to for summer.

Very Delicious!!  Forget the nasty supermarket mushroom soup goop though.  Saute mushrooms for 5 minutes over medium heat, add milk and cornstarch (slowly) and some spices.  Voila, FRESH cream of mushroom soup.  I used whole wheat Ritz crackers and doubled them.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe to the dot except for the butter part. Similar to an earlier review, I cut butter in half, and it was sufficient.  The dish is already quite rich from the cheese and mayo, so I thought reducing the amount of butter would be a good idea. I also sauteed my vegetables instead of boiling. It was absolutely delicious!

Gave it a four because of prep time. Made it for the first time Saturday night and took it to a pot luck.  It got rave reviews.  I loved it, but will have to figure out how to make it more diabetic friendly.

We had mixed reviews in our house - I liked it, but my husband agreed with the negative reviewers.  Anyway, I was wondering why we only had to heat the vegetables for 6 mins on medium heat, I thought that couldn't get them very soft....but, the firmness allows the vegies to have a perfect consistency in this dish.  I was really worried when I saw that much pepper for this dish, it ended up tasting fine, but I'll probably tone it down to 1/4 teaspoon.  This cooked for 30 mins.  The water chestnuts added crunch, pimentos added color and the cheese was so good.  I could see this being a risky dish if your husband is a meat and potatoes guy.

Fantastic dish!  The only change I made was to use equal amounts of zuccini.  Other than that I did exactly as the recipe said.  For those concerned about the prep time, practice.  I had it done and ready for the oven in about the suggested time.  That kinda suprised me looking at the number of ingredience.

This dish is very good and the whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe as given omitting the water chestnuts and pimentos since they weren't available at the time.  I also sauteed the squash's and onions in a little olive oil rather than par boiling them.  This is even better the next day.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a good dish to start, but made me a little sick after a few bites.  I misread/didn't understand the "buttery round crackers" and ended up buying oyster soup crackers. Once I found out that it was the wrong kind, I didn't crush them before putting everything together so that they would stay a little crunchy. They didn't come out amazing, but it wasn't bad either. I also used less mayonnaise, but it was still too much for me.  The texture created by the mayo and the squash was so squishy that it made me sick.  The flavor was OK but I will not make this recipe again.

Wow! Everyone loved this dish. I switched out the mayo for sour cream, but other than that, followed the recipe as written. It makes a beautiful dish (be sure to use the green tops on your onions). Don't overcook your squash/onion mix...and only heat in oven until hot through and through. You want the veggies to still have a bit of firmness. We forced ourselves not to clean out the dish, for the promise to have the rest of it for dinner tomorrow night! Yum! Thanks for posting such a great recipe that will be a frequent favorite around our house.

This was too rich, plus I've had better squash casseroles at family holiday gatherings.  Perhaps if there was a way to modify some of the ingredients & make it lighter, then maybe I would make it again.

I was skeptical to try this recipe after bad luck with others like it in the past, but this was wonderful. I baked a little but longer than suggested to get the topping nice and crispy, and I also added approximately a cup of chopped spinach. So Yummy!

Wonderful!  My aunt makes something like this but this beats any squash casserole I have had. I didnt have pimento, green onions or water chestnuts. Still great. I will make sure to have those ingredients next time. I husband started talking about leftovers being his before dinner was over. It made enough but not an overwhelming amount like some others.

A friend made this for a church potluck and it was incredible! She gave me the recipe, and she had photocopied it from p. 271 from either a book or a chapter called "Simple Sides." I found her copy in some paperwork and I was about to submit this recipe, but when I did a search, I found the same one, same submitter. It's listed under "Classic Comfort Food," and I have to agree! Thanks to everyone for your ideas to tweak the recipe. I'm looking forward to making it at Christmas!

This was pretty good. I made it for our holiday church potluck. I made it a few hours before, chilled it and then cooked it for 40 minutes. I didn't make any changes to the recipe itself. It got average reviews.

Dang this was awsome.... after reading each review I modified the topping using cornflakes to the topping with a bit of butter to get a delicate but nice crunch to the topping... a must at any dinner.

awesome!  not the healthiest recipe but definately tasty.  Didn't have pimento peppers but can see how they would add a lot.  Cayan pepper worked well.  Maybe next time I'll try bread crumbs mixed with crackers.

Great recipe.  The pimentoes added a certain zing that other recipes I've tried were missing.  I would recommend it.

I took this to a pig roast, and while it was gone by the end of the night, I just didn't think it was anything spectacular. Don't get me wrong, it was good and I'm sure I'll use it again, it just doesn't jump out at you. Next time I make this I think I'll use a bit more squash and zucchini...probably 3 or 4 cups of squash and 2 or 3 of zucchini. It cooked down quite a bit and made the dish seem sort of thin. I might add more crackers too. That really added a nice yummy touch to the dish.

This is an excellent recipe.  But the prep time is all wrong, I just wondered how you got all this done in ten minutes?  I would love for you to share your secret.  This recipe takes me about 30 minutes to prepare, but it is well worth it.

A definate jewel!  What a great way to use up squash and zucchini.  We loved this recipe!  The flavors all meshed very well together.  Loved the crunch from the water chestnuts and the hint of sage and let's not forget the cheese and butter cracker topping. Yum!  This is a keeper in my book!

You know when I started making this, looking at the ingredients I was thinking "Boy, I must of been starving to pick this recipe!". I mean come on, mayonnaise? Cream of Mushroom soup? Crackers? Except for adding two lg. cucumber size yellow squash and one same size zucchini, I followed this recipe to a T. If this recipe tasted bad it wasn't going to be because of me! I guess that means I can't take credit for it tasting great! Man, it was delicious! My husband had 4 helpings of it and had more the next day! I'm glad I was starving when I picked this recipe and was willing to try something different. It was worth it! Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was exceptionally yummy!  Even my non eating squash children loved it!  I didn't have water chestnuts and pimentos on hand, and it still was delicious.

Great as a "side" for any get together.  It's pretty rich so I generally serve with a fairly plain meat...such as grilled chicken.  Sliced garden tomatoes complete the meal and everyone is thrilled.

This is soooo very good!  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have all ingredients on hand (pimentos and water chestnuts)  I added fresh broccoli and cauliflower because I had them on hand.  All the tastes blend together so well.  We love cheese so I added a little more cheese... I'll be making this all summer!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This casserole was excellent!  For a lower fat/less rich version, I used margarine instead of butter, fat free yogurt instead of mayonnaise, and reduced fat/low sodium cream of mushroom soup.  It made the recipe really great and much healthier!

I found the recipe very flavorful (left out the pimentos), but short on squash and heavy on butter.  I used three zucchini and three yellow squash (medium).  I simmered the squash in olive oil, like other reviewers.  I used one cup of crumbs with two tablespoons of margarine and just put it on the top.  The family greatly preferred it to the original recipe.  I never have enough GOOD vegetable casseroles and this one goes into the "keeper" collection.

This was a wonderful surprise recipe. My family raved over it, and it got more stellar comments from the potluck co-workers. Several asked for the recipe and intend to cook it for Thanksgiving. Although it's very involved with all the ingredients, the taste is well worth the effort!

Excellent dish! I had some doubts at first, but with a bag of squash from my neighbor sitting in the fridge, I decided to try it. We used, Cream of Mushroom with Garlic, and added granulated garlic and lemon pepper to the mix. I let it sit for two hours in the fridge to meld and baked it about 40 minutes. Even my picky anti veggie husband really liked it. Thanks.

I made this for our monthly civic association meeting.  It was very good but I didn't cook it long enough. I also substituted the round crackers for saltines, and put some parmasean cheese on top too.   
Really good!

My husband and I fell in love with this!
I've made it about 3 or 4 times. I used fat free
mayo, fat free soup and whole wheat crackers the 
last time I made it.  It still tastes just as good
with the fat free stuff but you have to have the 
Ritz crackers.  It's just not the same without the
Ritz!  My kids eat a little.  The pimintos and
pepper make it too hot for them.  It's so good I
crave it.

Having just returned from the local farmers market with three types of squash I couldn’t wait to try this recipe.  It did not disappoint!  I ended up using hot peppers from the market instead of pimento.  Other than that I followed the recipe as listed.  My husband and I loved this dish.  It was creamy and very flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.

The only reason I did not give it  5 stars is because I made changes. I did not have water chestnuts or pimentos...but not sure I would want those in there. :) I added red pepper flakes and garlic powder and I sauteed the squash in some coconut oil spray. I also used shredded Parmesan cheese because that is what I had on hand,  I added about a cup of extra squash. Absolutely delicious!!!!!! Will make again for sure.  The mushroom soup/ mayo makes a great mix and the ritz crackers crust and topping are excellent.

This is yummy  and a great way to use those last of the garden vegetables! I did add diced red and yellow peppers to the mix instead of pimentos, used a pinch or 2 of thyme instead of sage, and sauteed  the vegetables as suggested by other reviewers. My husband even enjoyed it and he's not much of a veggies fan. It's a keeper!

This was Yummy, Yummy Yummy!!  The only things I left out (because I didn't have them or I don't like them) was the Sage and Water Chestnuts... But I don't think omitting them ruined the recipe... it still came out really good.  I will definitely make this again!!

In addition to all of the listed ingredients, I added some fresh garlic to the veggie mix. I also do at least double of the crackers- it's better when there's more of a crust to it. Yum!!

This is an excellent recipe!  I'm a lover of any kind of squash casserole, but this is by far the best!  Even ones who don't particularly care for squash seem to love this!  Didn't change a darn thing!  PERFECT!

Several years ago I got this recipe out of a Taste of Home and love it. Typically I make exactly per recipe, but I've also been known to use fresh red bell pepper in place of pimento and French fried onions in place of crackers.

This just didn't go over well at our Thanksgiving.  From the recipe and reviews it looks delicious and a unique casserole but no one out of the 30+ people we had over cared much for this, me included.

I modified quite a few things based on convenience.  I used only zucchini.  Used sour cream instead of mayo, dried basil instead of sage, a can diced chili instead of pimento, Italian cheese blend instead of chedder, and I omitted the cracker part entirely - just topped it with French's friend onions near the end of baking. Really good and different.  Obviously...you can change around quite a few things and still get good results.

I have to say even with all the great ratings I was skeptical but this dish is wonderful.  I had no butter crackers so I used pretzels instead, just ran them through the food processor.  Sliced the carrots instead of shredding and sauteed the squash and onion instead of boiling them.  Will definitely make this again.

My husband loves this recipe! I omitted the pimentos, used one sleeve of Ritz, added minced garlic and green peppers and used Tonys instead of salt. Yuummmyyyy!

This is the best! Don't understand why others had problems... I used the mayo. Left out the chestnuts. Wanted to use the cream of chix but had only cream of brocc. which tasted great! Had a 4oz. jar of roasted red peppers and 1 carrott in it. Had fresh sage. Picked 2, 8" summers & 2, 7" zukes. Used a sleeve & a half of "Hi-Ho" crackers. Cooked w/ water maybe 15 minutes and baked in a glass 13x9x2" pan for 35 minutes. PERFECT! Great colors too! This will be my new summer "pot luck" party dish.

Everything is great about this recipe...except for the water chestnuts. I usually love water chestnuts in Asian cuisine, but thought they felt out of place and gave the dish an odd flavor.  I think adding more vegetables, perhaps even broccoli or more squash, would provide a fuller, more tasteful dish. I do have to mention that no one complained and everyone gobbled up the casserole, but I think I'm going to try it without water chestnuts next time.

LOVED IT!! My husband and kids raved about it!  I didn't use pimentos because I couldn't conceive what they may bring to the dish.  Although I think I will use maybe 1/2 a cup of sweet red roasted peppers next time for color. Definitely use the water chestnuts..they make the texture perfect, sofy and crunchy.  My family can't wait until I  make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I'm always looking for tastey vegetable recipes and this one fits the bill. My hubby and I loved it and it's on my menu for Thanksgiving and maybe Christmas dinner.

This is such a pleasent change from the same old veggies.  Everyone who ate it (including my picky daughter) loved it.  The only thing I did different from the written recipe is I left out the pimentos and green onion.  I can't wait to make it again!

I have made this recipe several times for potlucks and it is always a hit.  Takes time in preparation, but well worth the effort. It is a keeper.
