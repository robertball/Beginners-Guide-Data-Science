I didn't have a leek, but I did use the Knorr Dry Vegetable Mix. I halved this recipe so that it would have more spinach/water chestnuts. I also replaced a lot of the sour cream with greek yogurt. You couldn't even tell. You mention cheese in the description, but I don't see any.

Also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Everyone thought it was sour cream.  Made my own tortilla chips by cutting flour tortillas into wedges, sprinkle with a little cayenne pepper and baked. They worked well too.

I also replaced the Light Sour Cream with Non-Fat Greek Yogurt. Additionally, I added a dash of Smoky Paprika and a dash of Cayenne Pepper for a nice kick. I served it with an assortment of crisp veggies instead of the Bread bowl. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

Doubled the spinach.  Added 1/2 of a Vidalia and 1 Red bell pepper finely chopped.  Will try the Yogurt and half the mayo next time.

Tasty. My leek was quite large, so I used about 3/4 of it. Texture, taste and creaminess of this dip were all good, it will be a favorite appetizer again!

I substituted 1/2 cup of the sour cream for an 8 oz. package of cream cheese. It didn't really have a whole lot of flavor so I added 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing mix.
