I tried this recipe because I didn't have anything sweet to eat in the house so I searched for a recipe using lemon flavor.  My kids kind of liked it but it didn't give me the "something sweet" I was looking for.

I planned to use vanilla for the lemon extract. Not finding any, I added maple syrup and chocolate syrup(a small squirt of each). I did have trouble with pulling an end through the slit, so I made smaller pieces instead. It fries very fast and my family loves it. I think it tastes like a funnel cake.
