First time I made these we didn't like the batter- too mushy.  So the next time we dipped the mushrooms in beat egg and the rolled them in italian breadcrumbs (already has garlic and spices added in).  They turned out wonderful- crunchy and tasty.  Dipped in Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.

Followed directions as written. Flavor was good but the batter never got crispy.  It was more like a pancake-wrapped mushroom.  I like a crunchy outer.  I also missed the beer flavor so next time I'll look for a beer batter for my shrooms.  Dh liked them as well but wished they were more crunchy.

I have made these twice now. The only people in the house who don't like them are the ones who don't like mushrooms! I added a little extra garlic salt. The only draw back was that I had to fry them for a long time to make them crisp enough. But towards the end of the batch they went faster, I guess because the oil got hotter and hotter. I loved these.

I had no problems with this recipe, I was worried they would come out mushy, but mine came out just fine.   I, of course cooked them with my deep fryer at 350, for about 4 minutes.   Will def use this recipe again..

Good, but does need more spice.  Also used a deep fryer and fried until brown and crisp.  Here is a dip I made: 1/4 cup mayo, 1 tblsp each lemon juice, horseradish, milk to desired consistency. Similar to dips we have tasted served with this dish. Will make this again with some cayenne and more garlic.

FABULOUS!! I made this 2x, (husb birthday dinner) second time was even better because I added a little more seasoning to the flour mixture (ie. chicken soup mix more garlic & salt). I added seltzer instead of water, but I know my mom-in-law makes it with beer instead of water. That gives it a tampura kind of taste-YUM! I also "double dipped" the mushroom: egg, flour, egg, flour- I think this gave it more crispy crunch. Trick is to serve it RIGHT AWAY! Make sure to serve it warm, or else it ruins the taste &crunch. Try it with cauliflower too. Do you know how much this costs in a resturant????!!!!

Followed recipes directions, and the end result was good. They were good for home cooked fried mushrooms. I had to add a bit of salt and garlic powder on top for more flavor though. Not bad. 

I'm going to continue to fool around with ideas on this one ;]

I found that a deep fryer worked much better than pan frying. Really good flavor and crispy. You can get a deep fryer at walmart for like $20.

I used beer in the batter, didn't try original version sorry so don't know how it compares. Used 1/2 cup beer and 1/2 cup water, might try all beer next time. Used fresh garlic and you could taste the garlic quite a bit. Will definately try again...thanks for a great recipe!

First off I don't think I did it right, but aside from that, it was definitely not the fried mushroom I was going for. Maybe I would have done better in a real deep fryer instead of just a pan.

Very good recipe. I agree w/ alot of the other reviews, the mushrooms needed to be a tad bit crispier, so I added italian bread crumbs in with the flour. Made them taste AWESOME! Will definitely be making them again. Too easy and too tasty not to! :)

These got really soggy by the time they drained and cooled down enough to eat. I added salt and cayenne to the batter but they still were bland.

This is a very good recipe, although I did double up on the garlic salt and added some onion salt.  Once I did this, the mushrooms were delicious.  I used a Presto deep fryer and they turned out nice and crispy.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I tried this today.  Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much!  Thank you for sharing!  It really brings out the mushroom flavor.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it doesn't come out crispy.  I added a bit more salt, too, because I'm a salt fiend.  Overall, a wonderful taste.  I don't want to change the recipe to get the crisp into the batter for fear of changing the flavor.

This recipe was very bland and very cake like instead of light and crisp. I added hot sauce to the batter to add a kick, which really added flavor. I also only used the egg whites to make it not so cakey. Also like other people suggested I did add italian breadcrumbs which was a great suggestion.

I had some baby portebella mushrooms to use & found this batter.  I did change it slightly & used beer instead of water.   The carbonation made the batter especially light.  One could also use seltzer water for the same end result.  Since the batter was more than needed for the mushrooms, I sliced some Vidalia onions & used it up.  It was bar food at home.  Thanks for sharing.

Added italian breadcrumbs and used pre-sliced mushrooms. Fried in peanut oil. Couldn't keep them on the plate. I am the only one who likes mushrooms in my household, so I thought. This is a keeper.

This recipe is a fantastic base for making fried mushrooms. I had never fried any before, and I am now thrilled that I have the power to make such a tasty snack.

I made some changes to the recipe to suit my liking. I replaced the water with beer, doubled the garlic salt, and I added onion salt, paprika and  lemon pepper seasoning.  I also used a deep fryer and had no problems with soggy batter.

I followed the recipe and it came out ok. It wasn't mushy and was crunchy as I like. My only complaint is that it tasted bland so I ended up sprinkling the mushrooms with garlic powder, onion powder and some pepper. I also added an extra teaspoon of garlic salt and pepper to the flour mix for extra favor. Even with the extra salt it wasn't overly salty. I would make theses again.

this was very good. I am allergic to wheat, so I used sorghum flour instead. I also used egg replacer instead of real egg. I do think it needs a lot more flavor. Next time I will add all kinds of herbs to it, and more garlic.

I tried a variation of this recipe tonight. I cut small white mushrooms in 4, dipped them in 2 beaten eggs, coated them lightly with cornstarch garlic powder salt mixture, fried them in corn oil. They turned out good! I fried them for a while until they turned slightly golden removed from oil and removed excess oil with papertowel. My dipping sauce was Marzetti brand, Southwest Ranch. Very good combination. I have tried other batters but I had made this batter the night before for general tao and thought it would work well for these mushrooms. I will try italian breadcrumbs next time.

This recipe turned out really well. I doubled the garlic salt and made sure that the oil was really hot before I started frying the mushrooms. Very light and crispy!

I've been using this recipe for quite some time.  It is very quick and easy.  What makes them even better is dipping them in ranch dressing.

These are very good. My husband thought they were better than ones from a restaruant because they didn't get really crispy, thats how he likes them. My kids love them to. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I added more seasonings including pepper, onion powder, seasoning salt, all purpose seasoning without salt or Mrs. dash without salt.  I also cut my mushrooms in half instead of quarters.  Next time I will add breadcrumbs and hopefully that will made them more crispy

These were okay but not as good as I had expected them to be..... it seems that for some reason the batter just didn't crisp up like it should have and they seemed bland... I followed the directions and even confirm the cooking temp of my oil with a thermometer ... Needless to say I was disappointed.... we ate them but I won't be using this recipe if I decide to try making them again in the future.

Like many others, added my own combination of spices. Mostly Cayenne, white pepper and chili powder. It also helps the crispness to put the batter in the freezer for about 30 minutes while the oil is heating. (Tempura batter trick)

Delicious! I made a few changes to the recipe. I used a Saison beer instead of water, 1 tsp garlic galore, 1 tsp absoutely onion blend and 3/4 tsp season salt. I fried them in a cast iron pan, drained them on a cookie sheet with (paper towel umder it, not on it)  and they came out perfectly crisp!

I would say this breading is very bland. After the first batch I added seasoning and even a little cornmeal to the batter.

Good flavor but I also had soft breading. I read some reviews and tried there advice but it didn't work. Not sure what needs to be done for a crisp breading, will try to find the answer with this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I'm not sure how it turns out with water, but I used beer and added more garlic and salt seasoning. It was delicious! We'll definitely make this again and again!

Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!  I sprinkle garlic powder on the mushrooms and tossed them. I seasoned the flour mixture with onion powder, black pepper , salt and garlic powder. I was heavy handed on the garlic and that paid off. My partner said it taste like restaurant food. Dipping them in ranch. The best!

I love this recipe. It's so easy to do my twelve year old makes them. I do agree a little more garlic would be great but of course we love garlic in my house. I have made this many times and would recomend it to anyone.

These were wonderful!!! I didn't have all-purpose flour, so I used wheat flour. Great, easy, quick recipe. Thanks so much for submitting it!
