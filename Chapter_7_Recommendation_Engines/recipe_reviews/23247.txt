I love this recipe.  There was not a drop left.  We found that it was best liked with strawberries and grapes.  I added about 1 cup of cool whip to make it easier to get the dip on the fruit.

Defiantly will be making this again!

AWESOME!  I added 1 cup of cool whip per the recommendation of another reviewer.  The consistency was still not as creamy and fluffy as I would have liked so will probably add a whole container next time, but the taste was fabulous!  I have been searching for a fruit dip that I really liked, and this is the ONE!  Thanks for the recipe =)

VERY easy and very yummy.  Not sickening sweet.  It was very pretty with my fruit platter I made for a baby shower.  I will definitely make again.

This has got to be the best two-ingredient recipe I've ever made!  I made it the night before hosting a baby shower, and it turned out the perfect shade of light pink and absolutely delicious.  I had planned on adding some whipped topping as others had suggested, but it already tasted so good without it that I left it out.  I served it with grapes, strawberries and pineapple.  I will make this recipe every time I serve a fruit tray from now on.

YUM!  Took the advice of adding a big scoop of cool whip to make this more 'dippable' It was simply perfect.  6/9/08 I am adding to my review...I made this again yesterday, and added the juice of an orage.  It really lightens this dip up and makes it tase very fresh!

This was nice.  I only needed half the recipe for 6 people and a complete buffet.  I didn't have strawberry creme cheese, so I just added strawberry jam to normal cream cheese.  It was nice with fresh strawberries.

Wonderful.  Added a few splashes of OJ and a few sprinkles of strawberry jello for some extra coloring and sweetness.  Very easy.

I made this for a party and it got rave reviews. I added the Cool Whip, as other reviewers suggested. Served the dip with fresh strawberries, grapes, a can of drained Mandarin oranges and fresh pineapple.  I will probably make this again.

Delicious and so simple to make. I made this once as written and then served the leftovers at another party the next day with Cool Whip added to stretch it out. It tasted great both times, but I think I liked it better the first time because there was more strawberry flavor. I usually use another fruit dip from this site, but it contains alcohol, and this time there were children and a pregnant woman at the party, so I made this instead. I might make this from now on because it's easier and doesn't make quite so much as the other recipe.

I used the suggestion to add some whip cream.  My mother was trying to eat the dip with a spoon since we ran out of strawberries. It was a giant hit.

Delicious, especially with strawberries and Granny Smith apples.  Took the tips from other reviewers and added 1 cup Cool Whip and a small amount of strawberry jello to punch up the flavor and color; also soaked the apple slices in 50% lemon  juice/50% water.  Will being using this recipe again.  Thanks Jodie for a new favorite!

Very, very easy.  Tasted creamy and delicious.  I especially loved it on apples.  I used a hand held mixer to really whip it and it turned out great.

Excellent as is, even better w/cool whip. I doubled this recipe & added about a half of an 8 oz container of cool whip. Really good w/grapes, strawberries & mandarin oranges!

This was delicious. I love strawberries but can't stand their tartness so I thought I'd give this dip a try. It was perfect. Not too sweet. Easy to dip when cool, not cold. Mine turned out nice, light and fluffy. I didn't refrigerate it before eating. I will definitely use this dip again and again and try it with plain cream cheese as well!

I served this at a dinner party for 10 last night.  It was a huge hit.  The men especially liked it.  They ate so much fruit, they almost didn't eat dinner! I added the 1 cup of cool whip to make it easier to dip the fruit.

Made this today for a halloween party... it was AWESOME.  Also added 1 cup cool whip.  Let everything get kind of room temp, made it easier to blend it.  Everyone ate it up and raved about it, and it was so easy to make.

Really good and super easy!  I added about 3/4 cup of lite coolwhip just to make the texture a little lighter.  I brought this to a playdate on a platter with strawberries, fresh cut pineapple cubes and seedles grapes.  It was a huge hit with both kids and adults.  My kids now want me to make this to go with fruit at home too.  I said sure, but only if you choose to eat it as your dessert!  But for special occasions like a picnic or party, I will definitely make this again.

It just doesn't get any easier or tastier than this! I got rave reviews! AND it doesn't matter what brands you use. I used Wal-Mart Strawberry Cream Cheese and an off-brand marshmallow creme. Yummy!

Easy and fabulous!  Kids and Adults loved it!  One friend, even put in on top of his cheesecake because it was so good.  I was sceptical because I am not a Fluff fan, but everyone thought it was great!

I added strawberry flavoring to regualr cream cheese, red food color, and added 1 cup cool whip to the recipe. It was wonderful, an so much more economical than the store bought. Everyone asked for the recipe, and it went fast. I served with apple slices- I poured a mix of 50% lemon juice and 50% water- you could use on all fruits to keep from browning, and it went very fast at an office party.    Just get everything at room temp before mixing and there is no problem at all.     Very yummy, tasty, and fluffy. Better and cheaper than deli bought.

Very good.  I took it to a party, and it got several compliments.  I also added a little cool whip to make it a little softer.  I served it with strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and grapes.

I always get compliments with this recipe.  I even use low-fat strawberry cream cheese.  You can't tell the difference.  Sometimes I do add a little strawberry instant jello to give it more strawberry flavor.  Never a drop left.

Tasy, but too sweet even for my taste, and I love sweets. No one really ate this when I served it at a birthday party. I ended up throwing most of it away a few days later.

I have been making this for years.  With one exception.  I just use regular cream cheese with the marshmellow creme.  It is always a big hit.  Try it with regular cream cheese next time!

This recipe was great because it only took about 10 minutes to prepare and it tasted great. My husband and I don't eat a lot of fruit so this is a good way to get your daily servings of fruit. The marshmallow creme adds the perfect creamy and smooth blend. And you can substitute the strawberry cream cheese for any fruit flavored cream cheese.

I made this recipe using double the cream cheese to the same amount of fluff.  One cream cheese was strawberry flavored, the other was plain.  I added a couple of tablespoons of cool whip to make it a little more dip-able.

I made this for my grandaugters 8th Birthday party. It was for an outdoor pool party with more adults than childred. Served it with a huge fruit salad. I used two 7 oz jars of fluff and added a 6 oz container of strawberry yogurt. It took alot of mixing but was so good. I will make this again for sure.

This fruit dip is WONDERFUL.  Continued to follow the advice of others and added about 4oz of cool whip to the recipe.  So, this 2 ingredient recipe is now a 3 ingredient recipe.  Served this with a platter of strawberries, grapes, pineapple, kiwi and raspberries.  Excellent.  Need to remember this for my next summer picnic

I love this dip! There, I said it out loud ;) I've filled strawberries with it, slathered it on granny smith apples, and my husband swears it's the best thing for seedless red grapes. It seems that no matter which fruit, it's always creamy and dee-lish!

I got this recipe from a friend and have made it several times now over the years and it's always a hit.  It's a tad sweet, but you are in control when it comes to how much you dip.  My favorite fruit to dip is strawberries, but I have used several different types of fruit.

So quick & easy to make! I think fresh whole strawberries and apple slices tasted best with this.  Also had bananas, seedless grapes and fresh pineapple cubes which were good with this but not as good as the strawberries and apples in my opinion.

I have made this before and love it, and am glad to see it on allrecipes.com. I just wanted to say that I take this to potlucks and office parties all of the time, and there is never a drop of it left. Everyone loves it and wants to know how to make it! So easy and so tasty! By the way, I usually use low fat cream cheese to cut down on the fat a little bit.

This recipe is wonderful...and...so easy.
I took it to a birthday party at my daughter's house and it was fun to watch the guests sample it with pieces of fruit and then they came back with a vengeance.  A great hit.   teetyboo

This was good on its own but I made some changes. Be sure to bring the cream cheese to room temp and then beat it to prevent lumps. I also added about 6 oz. of strawberry banana yogurt and squeezed fresh orange juice in to bring it to dip thickness. This is a great recipe and my five year old loves it! Thanks!

I had a barbecue and this dip with fruit was a HUGE success.  Especially amongst my teenagers and friends. The serving tray kept disappearing.

We have made this recipe in my family for years... we've used regular cream cheese and the strawberry... it's awesome both ways and so simple to make.  My kids will eat it without the fruit if I let them..great recipe.

The best thing about this recipe was that the container was easier to clean than I thought it would be. I only got 1 compliment at work on this fruit dip.

This recipe was good, and super easy. I just got home from a party and it seemed to be well received. I added 2 drops of red food coloring just to give it a "brighter" pink appearance.

I had semi-high hopes for this, but to me it wasn't that good. I felt like I was ingesting too much sugar for not enough pay-off in the taste. :) It seems like a dish kids or sugar fanatics would like, but I wasn't a big fan.
