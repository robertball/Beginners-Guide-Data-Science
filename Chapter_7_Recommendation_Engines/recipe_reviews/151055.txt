This cake is extremely moist! Took less than 90 minutes for me, maybe 70-75...I dyed it green for fun, it was a big hit!

I really liked this cake, but made a few changes. I cut down on the sugar and eggs in the cake, to 3 eggs and 1 cup of sugar. It still turned out very fluffy and light. I used a quarter cup of spiced rum in the main cake and a half cup in the glaze. I agree with other reviewers that the glaze is very sweet, so it might be worth it to cut down it's sugar contents too. I felt like the lime and the rum had a nice balance --- but then, I did use extra rum!

This cake was okay.  I made it the morning it was served to company at my house and the glaze had not soaked through to all the cake.  The top half was moist but the bottom was dry.  I would suggest either using a wooden spoon to make the holes instead of a toothpick or not serving to the next day.  However, I noticed even though it was moist the next day the rum flavor seemed to disapate.

This cake was delicious. However, I did notice that the lime really overpowered the rum. Therefore, next time, I will add perhaps a tablespoon more rum. I did not make the glaze called for in the recipe. Instead, I used 2 cups of confectioners sugar and added about 4 tablespoons of lime juice. Also, it only took about 70 mins to bake, not the 90 called for. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and was very pleased with the result: a moist, rich, tangy cake that was the perfect ending to a citrus-themed 3-course meal. I served it about 4 hours after taking it out of the oven, and it was just right.

The cake part of the recipe is wonderful.  Light, fluffy, moist- I added a lot more rum (like two cups worth :), and the lime is VERY strong.  I think next time I'll use a little less lime.  The glaze was ok- very limey- I suggest reviewing a few recipes for regular rum cake, because this is a strange glaze. I'm used to boiling mine for 4 minutes while stirring.  I guess it's what you like! Overall, I would use this recipe again with some changes.

Wonderful stuff. Very rich, though and I cut it into smaller servings. Also, I only baked it for an hour before I tested it. 90 minutes seemed a bit long to me. Maybe the author of the original recipe wanted a thicker crust.

We made this for a birthday dinner. It turned out great. Instead of pure rum on the glaze, we used rum extract. Both of the birthday people liked this recipe.

Made this cake yesterday; found it to be tasty but rather ordinary. Was looking forward to the zing of the key lime juice that others described but it just wasn't there, and I used fresh key limes from our own tree (Floridians)!  As you can see, I used a chopstick for wider holes to let the glaze penetrate and then gave it all a powdered sugar dusting -- that worked well except the holes really show up.  I don't think I'll make this again.  It was almost as dense as pound cake, and not really sweet enough.

I was  not a fan of this cake. For the amount of fat and calories in it i found it incredibly bland.

I just put the glaze on the cake. I'll edit this review after I cut into it. It only took about 1 hr to bake the cake.  The bundt cake came out of the pan perfectly. I used a larger pick to poke the cake. More like a skewer pick. I hope the cake has more of a lime/rum flavor.  The batter didn't so much. The glaze was very citrusy and I could taste the rum. Very moist cake. I will let it infuse for a day before I cut into it. If I think it can use more glaze, I will make more and pour it over the cooled cake. We'll see how it turns out.

Definitely took less than 90 minutes, I think I pulled it out just over an hour and it was perfect. Instead of the glaze I just used vanilla icing with two key limes squeezed in it

Made this for my Boo for Valentine's day & she liked it. Surprisingly, her relatives liked it too. Had a pound cake texture that I didn't expect. Next time, I'm going to poke & soak the cake with some of the glace while the cake is in its pan. After that's adsorbed, then I'll take the cake out the pan and poke/drizzle it on the top with the rest.
