This is awesome, I substitute the "bread crumbs" for crushed graham crackers - MUCHHHHH better =) And I use butter, instead of shortening.
Enjoy!
PS. Store in the fridge - in a tightly covered container.

I cannot imagine using bread crumbs so I went the graham cracker route. This isn't anything different from magic bars but they are still good. They get better the longer they sit. Easier to cut too.

Decadent beyond belief. Yum. I am stingy with my 5 star ratings, and this almost got one. I have to confess, I made a lot of changes, though. Used crumbled up lemon cookies instead of bread, butter instead of shortening, pecans instead of walnuts and omitted the butterscotch chips.
