Made a few modifications. Was pretty good. Added some italian seasoning and used only cup of mozzarella and added some parmesan. Next time I will use fresh mushrooms, the canned ones just didn't do it for me. Will def make again

This is a great, quick dinner. I used ground turkey, low fat cheese and whole wheat pasta. I added a few garlic cloves in with the onion, and added plenty of basil, oregano and a little black pepper. I will definately make this again.

My family loves this recipe!!! It's quick, easy, and kid-friendly... all 4 of my kids will usually take seconds (even my 2-yr old will sit down and eat all her dinner without fussing). I sprinkle the cheese over the top instead of mixing it into the pasta though... I think it makes it look a little more appetizing.

Well, what can I say? I made the recipe to the letter - ok, I added two cloves of garlic - and when I tasted it, I thought it was somewhat bland - but my husband raved! and then he raved some more. Then he raved again just in case I didn't get it before. He liked the flavor (I used chopped tomato and olive oil spaghetti sauce.) He liked it wasn't too cheesy. He liked it a whole bunch and he likes my cooking, but I've never heard him go on like this. So it gets five stars from me.

Simple, easy and tasty. I divide up and vacumn seal the left overs for individual "quick" meals. When it's time to use, I just cut a small slit in the bag and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Let stand for 5 more. Great for those nights when other plans fell through.

Big hit w/ my friends.  A little dry around the edges.  Make sure to stir to prevent this about 10 minutes prior to end.

I love this recipe. I don't add the mushrooms, but I do add a packet of italian salad dressing mix, and some extra cheese on top. My picky husband loves it and it tastes great left over.

This is so simple to make.  I was originally confused by what kind of pasta mostaccioli is--turns out it's penne, but when I was at the grocery nobody knew what that was so I ended up with campanelle (which was the frilly-est one available).  I liked the extra twirl over penne. I added one packet of Good Seasonings Zesty Italian when cooking the meat, and used 4oz of fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I put 1/2 the cheese on top.  I also used a Corningware deep white circular dish and kept the glass lid on until the last 10 min of cooking.  This kept the edges moist and let the cheese brown at the end.

This was fine, but I made several changes to make it less bland. I added a clove of garlic and Italian seasoning to the beef and used some Parmesan cheese in place of some mozzarella cheese. I also omitted the mushrooms because we don't like them. I drained the beef after cooking. I put about half of the cheese on top before baking.

Cooked the hamburger with italian seasonings, onion & garlic.  Poured the spaghetti sauce & cheese in the skillet with hamburger meat.  While it was simmering, cooked the pasta.  Throw the drained pasta in the skillet, mix well and pour in casserole dish. Put more cheese on top & bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes.  For the cheese, I used Kraft's Italian Five cheese (mozzarella, provolone, romano, asiago, & parm.)  Very Good!

Loved it. I did make some changes though. Instead of ground beef I used spicy Italian sausage. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

This was super easy and everyone loved it! I used ground turkey instead of beef and I also left out the mushrooms and instead used sundried tomatoes (that were packed in oil) because my husband isn't a fan of mushrooms.

This is a good basic pasta recipe.  Add more ingredients to make it tasty.  2 cloves garlic, 1/4 c sliced green olives, 1 package sliced mushrooms (not canned), 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper.  I also used egg noodles for the pasta because I just love the texture of them  :)

Made this for my boyfriend and 2 guests. Everyone loved it and we had PLENTY of leftovers. I actually used tomato soup and tomato paste along with the jar of spaghetti sauce (I doubled the recipe) and I didn't have canned mushrooms so I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and it turned out great!

I found this meal to be quick and low fat if you do turkey and little cheese on the top. However I added cloves of garlic, basil, corn and bell peppers. I also seasoned the ground beef with a half of packet of Lawry's Spaghetti seasoning. Will be making this again.

Pretty good easy recipe. I added what I had so no mushrooms, which we don't like anyhow.  Added different kind of pasta, tomato sauce instead of just spaghetti sauce and then seasoned with oregano. Added cheddar/Monterrey jack cheese mix instead of mozzarella and then 2 cups Cheddar on top, and no onion but rather onion seasoning. Turned out great and very yummy! Took about 15-20 exact to prep and then cooked for 30 mins to brown sides of cheese!

Super easy recipe and delicious.  I tweaked the ingredients as a recommendation by some of the other reviews and I was very pleased.  My children loved it and it wasn't a battle to encourage my pickey eater to eat dinner, a rare occassion in my home.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and one that will be used frequently.  Thank you jojolyn for sharing and bringing a peaceful calm to my dinner table.

While browning my ground beef and onions, I seasoned the mixture to my family's liking (s & p, garlic/onion powders, and basil). I also added 1/2 the jar of spaghetti sauce, mushrooms, and then mixed the cheese right in (I used more mozzarella than called for and also added a handful of parmesan for good measure). I did this while my pasta was boiling (I used rigatoni as it was all I had, but virtually any type of pasta will work). After I drained the pasta, I threw the pasta back in the pot and mixed with the hamburger mixture. Since the pasta and hamburger mixture were still piping hot, I knew I wouldn't need the 20 minute cooking time. I tossed some additional cheese on top, as well as a sprinkling of basil and baked for only 10 minutes. The last two minutes, I set the oven to broil to get the cheese nice and golden brown. I let it sit for a few minutes, and it was a hit with the hubby and 3 1/2 year-old daughter. Served with a green salad and garlic bread, and it makes a quick and tasty weeknight meal!

Very simple to make.  The family enjoyed it.  I did add some Italian seasoning as some others had suggested and it turned out great, but next time I might add some fresh herbs to it.  I will make it again.

This is soooooooooo good! Thanks for the great recipe Jojolyn. Family loved it. I added diced tomatoes with green chiles just to spice it up because my family likes green chiles.

This recipe was fantastic! I did use large shell pasta instead of the mostaccioli and it came out fine. The pasta was not too dry or anything like that. Simple to make and my family loved it! Thanks!

Excellent recipe - I made this for the first time for my son's 5th birthday party and it was VERY well received!  I'm very glad I made it.  I browned the meat and onions the day before and kept them in the fridge.  Then a couple of hours before the party I followed the rest of the recipe.  GREAT!

This is a very easy recipe.  I added mrs.dash italian seasoning & salt to the beef.  I also added 1/4 cup of parm cheese to the top before baking.  It was delicious.  Will be making this one on week nights!

Yum! I'm going to do what I don't like doing (changing the recipe and reviewing) but only because I think the recipe is a great base!  I added a bunch of mashed garlic cloves before cooking the beef.  Also added fresh ground black pepper, oregano, and some spicy sausges.  I used a rotini pasta and also added a bit of parmesean over the shredded mozzarella. GREAT, easy dish! Can't wait for lunch time to have some leftovers! Haha! =)

Too much meat, or too little pasta.  Either way, this did nothing for us.  Needs seasonings too - I added dried basil and oregano, but we still needed to add salt and pepper at the table.

This is a very nice, quick and easy dinner for the whole family.  I made a few changes;  I added diced carrots to the beef mix, made a creamy mushroom white sauce for on top, and mixed breadcrumbs and parmesean cheese to create a crunchy topping! Yum!

this one is great, nothing could be easier.  There are so many varieties of spaghetti sauce available today that you can adjust this recipe to suit your taste exactly!  I also like to use the prepackaged 'four cheese italian blend' for more taste and time saving.  This one is great to prepare before your guests arrive and just pop in the oven with garlic bread while you make the salad!  Bon appetite!

Fabulous tasting, very easy recipe!!!
The only thing I changed is that I 
didn't use a separate bowl, I just used
the skillet to mix everything but the 
cheese, dumped it into the casserole
dish, put the cheese on top and baked.
It tasted GREAT!  I made a tossed salad
and garlic bread with it. Thanks for the
recipe Jodi!  I'm very grateful!!!

Yummy! I substituted the mushrooms for butter sauteed zucchinis, just because I love them. Added chopped garlic, garlic powder and the sauteed veggies to the meat mixture. Mixed the cheese into the mixture just as he said, but I also left enough for a bubbly cheese topping- I think that makes it look and taste even more appealing. Also sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top, just cause I LOVE cheese. This is a keeper.

Anything this cheesy is going to go over well at my house. ;-) I took the advice of others and mixed only 1 cup of the mozzarella into the pasta, then I stirred it after 10 minutes of cooking, then added the other cup of mozzarella on top and cooked for the other 10 minutes. It was delish and fun/easy to make.

Very good meal that the kids love. next time, i will only use 1/2 or 1/4 of onion, the full one did add plenty of sweet flavor, however, it was a bit overwhelming for a non-onion eater

Wow, this was the best pasta bake I've made.  Most baked ziti/pasta dishes call for 16 oz of pasta which I think is too much.  Using only 8 oz of pasta really helps the flavors stand out more, I think.  I used ground turkey, 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powders, and didn't use mushrooms or fresh onion.  Also added 2 cups sweet white corn.  Added a can of Muir Glen pizza sauce in addition to the Hunt's spaghetti sauce I used, because my husband likes a "saucier" pasta dish and the pizza sauce was the only extra sauce I had on hand.  I had everything I needed in my freezer or cupboard to make this, which is great when the fridge is empty.  I make baked pasta often so I pretty much kept my usual recipe but only used 8 oz pasta like this recipe calls for.  Awesome stuff.

Fabulous when made with alterations (to suit my picky tastes).  I substitute onion powder in place of the onion and leave out the mushrooms (personal preference).  Instead I like adding a can of diced, seasoned tomatoes and plenty of fresh-pressed garlic and Italian spices.  Maybe a little tomato paste to thicken up the sauce.  For cheeses, I like a combination of mozzarella, provolone and cheddar.  Topped with a little pat of butter and freshly-grated parmigiana.  And I do believe I baked it longer than 20 minutes.

This was really good, better then I expected - I figured it'd be decent but nothing special. I used ground turkey to make it a tad healthier, and add some minced garlic to the meat and onions when browning. My husband loved it! I think I'd add a little more cheese next time though.

I was looking for something that kittykat (below) was describing - basically a lazy lasagna with regular pasta shapes. Like hers, my rating isn't really relevant to this recipe. While I did use parts of the recipe, I really changed it... I used a mix of cooked sweet sausage (which I grinded in a food processor)and hamburger and then also the onion and mushrooms (next time I'll use fresh)and added to pasta sauce. I also used a 15 oz container of ricotta to which I added a beaten egg,  tsp or so of oregano, garlic salt, pepper and mozzarella/parm cheese mix. I used penne rigate as the pasta.  So, I put some plain sauce (no meat) in bottom of casserole dish, then a layer of penne. I took ricotta cheese mix and spread over pasta (next time may even mix bottom layer of pasta with cheese mix). Then put a layer of sauce, more pasta and ended with sauce and then mozzarella. Baked 350 for 30 mins (20 mins under foil and last 10 foil off to melt and brown cheese). Family really enjoyed it!

Very good! I actually didn't have any mushrooms on hand (gasp!), and I used chicken sausage with spinach and asiago cheese instead of the lean ground beef, because that's what I had on hand. My family loved it! We'll have this again!

My nephews always ask if we are going to have this dish and if they can help make it. It's soooo quick and sooo easy, they've even gotten a little creative with it, by adding pepperoni to it among other things. :)

One of my favorite ways to cook pasta ever since I made this dish. The baking part makes the cheese really come out in every bite you take.

Yum! This recipe would be awesome as is, but I did change it up based on what I had at home.  Although I doubled the recipe, I only used one pound italian sausage (no ground beef) , and I put half the cheese in the mixture and the other half on top.  Of course I used two pans.  I also used diced bell pepper from the garden and garlic.  I added fresh basil too.  Amazingly good!  Thanks!

This is a terrific BASE RECIPE.  If you ladies/gents out there make this with NO SEASONING adding then yes, it sure would be bland.  Again, great base recipe.  I used penne pasta, shrededed mozz/provolone cheese, alittle more sauce, basil and oregano, diced onion and minced garlic.  My boyfriend had 2 plates.  Serve with crispy romaine salad.

To make this simpler to shop for and healthier  I made these changes: ground turkey, fresh mozzarella and 12 oz fresh mushrooms chopped, 1 big can of Del Monte Traditional Spaghetti sauce (88 cents a can), and a generic italian seasoning. Fantastic. Loved it. Even better leftover.

This is another recipe that you can change to suit your taste. I added italian seasoning, oregano, basil, pepper, ground chicken and italian sweet sausage as well as onion and garlic and cook them together so that the flavors would blend well before mixing all the remaining ingredients. So yummy.

I did like this recipe but I changed it so my rating isn't exactly the most relevant. I made it exactly like the recipe except I decided to make a mixture of ricotta, mozzerella, parsley and eggs to put in the middle. I put half of the pasta mix on the bottom, the cheese mix and then more pasta with mozzerella on top. I was trying to make an "easy" lasagna but I think it turned out a difficult pasta...lol. I think the real issue was that I bought a mozzerella because it was on sale (cabot) and not my usual (sargento)...Cabot has a little bit of a smoked flavor that I did not care for. Next time I will try it like this again and use sargento and rate again... All things aside, my husband ate two helpings and made a large container for work tomorrow.

I sent this recipe to my boyfriend and he made it for me while I was at work. He said it was easy and it tasted delicious. We don't eat red meat so we substituted morningstar soy ground burger and it tasted just like the real thing and was healthier too.

My kids love a good baked pasta dish and this one did not disappoint.  Of course I tweaked it a bit - omitted the shrooms and added fresh garlic to the onion saute.  I also topped it with additional shredded romano cheese and added a few shakes of Italian seasoning to the meat saute.  It's very meaty and satifying.

Good recipe.  The only pasta I had in the correct quantity was rotini.  It worked well.  This is a very handy recipe to have on hand for a good speedy dinner.  Add some bread with a crunchy crust and a vegetable or salad and you have a great meal.  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy and quick to make. My family really liked this recipe.  I added garlic, Italian seasoning, and olives to the onion, mushroom, and burger mix.  I threw some mozzarella and parmesan cheese on the top for the last 10 min.  I had to use elbow noodles, because that is all that I had.  This one is a keeper.

An excellent family dinner.  Like many others I used fresh mushrooms and chopped garlic as well as Italian seasonings to spice it up a bit.  Had my grandchildren over for dinner and they loved it as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a must at every birthday party I host and attend.  I substituted ground turkey instead of beef.  I also use a jar of Ragu Garden Combination to add a few more veggies.  Use more sauce to avoid it being dry in some spots.

This was simple and easy to make and quite tasty.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I did not have the pasta called for so I used radiatore pasta, which is what I had on hand.  The recipe didn't specify if it should be covered while baking so I left it uncovered for the first 10 mins., then covered it for the last 10 mins.

Very yummy & very easy!  The only changes I made were to added about 4 cloves of garlic, and fresh mushrooms.  I can't wait to make this again.
My 3yr old & 10 month old both devoured this.

Good stuff! I added a little extra mozarella cheese and seasoned the ground beef with a liberal amount of garlic salt. Served it with a yummy garlicky Texas toast. Very enjoyable and I look forward to making it again!

Easy, yummy comfort food. My husband loved that I substituted Johnsonville Sausage for the ground beef because he said the sausage made the dish.   I also added a little chopped garlic.  He's already requested that I make it again.

Very easy to make.  I've never baked my Mostaccioli and wanted to make it like lasagna.  

I used turkey Italian sausage seasoned with Italian seasonings and red pepper flakes 
2 cans of tomato with garlic and onion
2 jars of spaghetti sauce
ricotta mixed with 2 eggs along with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese

Very, very good.  Served 3 adults and 6 kids this and it was all gone.  Perfect amount for us.  I used a 32 oz jar of sauce (that is what I had on hand) and mixed 1 cup of mozzarella INTO the mix and put 1 cup of mixed Italian cheese on top.  Used a lid to keep it from drying out.  When it got bubbly, I took the lid off for 5 minutes to brown the cheese.  Oh, and no mushrooms.  blech.  :)

I almost never give 5 stars, but this dish is SO easy and delicious, everyone in the family loves it. I use fresh mushrooms, garlic, basil, spinach, and added some leftover sausage, as well as some seasoning to the sauce. I love a quick and easy meal!

this was a hit with my family. Myhubby thought more cheese should be added but it was great. Fast and simple. Although I seasoned the beef to my liking. Will be made again :-)

Just awesome. Added a little garlic powder to the meat and a few tablespoons of turbando sugar as I like to take the acidity out of the pasta sauce. Great and easy dish!

This was quick and easy. I used ziti but most any pasta would work. It did get dry around the edges and next time I will stir it once or twice during baking.

Really, really good!  I couldn't find mostaccioli pasta and substituted penne.  I forgot an onion and mushrooms so I just worked without them.  It was so easy to make this that I felt like I was missing a step.  I love melted mozzarella and this made the perfect meal .  My toddler demanded seconds!  Next time I'll be sure to get the missing ingredients.  This was a very welcome change to spaghetti.

Was pretty good, but left me looking for the ricotta cheese!  Probably won't make again, but will make ziti instead.

I tried this with a few variations. I had some Bob Evans Sage sausage thawed out, so I browned some onions, garlic then added the sausage. Then I used Rotini as that was the only pasta I had on hand. I used italian sausage spaghetti sauce and I used 1/2 cup monteray jack cheese and 1/2 cup of pepper jack in the mix and added another cup of that cheese mix on top. Loved it, very easy and very delicious. Served it with a nice tossed salad and warm potato rolls. Yummy.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight.  It was very easy to make and both my husband and I loved it.  It makes a very big batch so it would be great to make for a family.  I made a few changes, but I didn't stray too far from the original recipe.  I added green bell pepper, a little Italian seasoning and I used macaroni because that's all I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jojolyn!

I make this recipe for a lot of get togethers.  The only thing different is I add turkey pepperoni.  If I am going all out for the recipe.  I have added Italian sausage.  This is really good my family loves it.

This was pretty good for such a simple dish. My boyfriend and his friend each ate two servings and we had plenty leftover. Changes I Made: Used ground turkey meat instead of beef, Mixed in some italian seasoning to the meat and pasta sauce, and put most of the cheese on top before baking.

Next time I might add a few cloves of chopped garlic and maybe some red pepper flakes. Great for a quick meal!

Love this! I did use both ground beef and ground Italian sausage and sprinkled fresh grated parmesan over the top for the last 5 minutes (uncovered). I also leave out the mushrooms (kids don't like them) and added minced garlic to the onion. The sausage makes it a little richer and spicier. Tastes even better the next day!

I've made this a few times and although its very good, I think its missing a little something.  I've added a small can of peas along with the mushrooms and that helps.  Overall, very good, easy and takes great the next day.

This was very easy to make and my guests enjoyed it very much.  Next time I make this, I'll have to add more spaghetti sauce as I felt it was a little dry for my taste.  Also, basil and oregano are a must to add too.

This was a very good, easy dish.  At first it looked like too much sauce when I mixed everything together, but it was fine and nothing got dry after baking--not even the edges.  I added some minced garlic while browning the meat, and feta cheese to give it a twist, but I'm sure it would have tasted good as is (I just like to spice things up).  A good weekday staple.

This recipe was very good and made great leftovers, but I found that the cheese did not seem to melt right.  Otherwise it was great (even with the fake meat).

Absolutely spectacular! Used a mixture of parmesan and feta, added fresh basil, carrots, fresh (instead of canned) mushrooms, garlic and herbs. Will definately make again!

My family really enjoyed.  I added garlic and Italian seasoning blend and added extra cheese to the top as it was baking.  Served with Italian Cheese Bread from this site.  Nice and fast.  Thanks

I liked the idea of this recipe, but I modified it to my own liking.  I decided not to add ground beef or mushrooms.  I used only 1/3 of an onion chopped, and sauteed. Then I added 3 cloves of freshly pressed garlic into the sauce. I used Rigatoni instead, and only used about 3/4 of the box.  It was delicious!  My guest loved it!  Garlic breadsticks were a perfect compliment.

I didn't have canned mushrooms, so I used sliced fresh mushrooms.  The finished product is good but basic, with the onion bordering on overpowering.

ok, but nothing special.  A bit bland, I added quite a few spices.  But I also could not add cheese, due to lactose intolerance in the family, so that may add to it.  Tasted a bit like one of those pasta bakes that you can purchase at the grocery store.  So in that case it does save you money.

Quick question: Is 8 oz of pasta accurate for this recipe?  I was just about to make it and realized it says 8 oz so I need to double all the other ingredients if I'm using a 16 oz package of pasta.

Major hit in our house. Doubled the recipe.  Kids loved it. I also,  put the meat sauce over a small amount of shaved zucchini and baked it separately for me. No noodles. It was also fantastic. I did add garlic salt to the meat while it was cooking other than that it was great as written.

This is a perfect base recipe. Certainly variations r endless that is what makes it so good. Mine is add bell pepper and garlic with a blend of ground beef and italian sausage + stir in 1/2 c cottage cheese in red sauce. Mix red sauce and pasta in baking dish and top with grated italian blend cheese and bake @ 350 till slightly browned. This adds rich cheese flavor and good slow release protein without adding too many extra calories.

Surprised this was so good but did need a bit of extra seasoning, at least for us and no kiids around either makes a difference.  Fresh mushrooms and some garlic plus red pepper flakes and then it is a 5 star recipes and easy as well.  Some day am going to try adding a handful or so of fresh spinach.

Simple and tasteful ! I added 1tsp of Italian seasoning and 1/2tsp of garlic powder. Exchanged the lb of beef for a vegetarian substitute and no one knew the difference. Both my son and husband  loved it - I should have doubled the recipe !

I used Johnsonville Mild All Natural Italian Sausage instead of ground beef - omitted the canned mushrooms - it was a great FAST and EASY dinner.  Using the Johnsonville sausage eliminated the need for additional seasonings that this recipe seemed to lack.  I did bake this recipe but I think it would be great to make and put in a slow cooker on warm for a couple of hours to have ready after work or sports practice.  The kids and adults both loved it!

I have made a similar recipe years ago. I like that this recipe used mushrooms. I decided to tweak the recipe and added fresh mushrooms, and one teaspoon Italian seasoning to the pasta sauce. After eating dinner, I will add 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning next time. I like quite a bit of flavor with my food. I also stirred only one cup of the shredded cheese to the pasta mix. I added the remaining cup of cheese to the top before baking. This makes a very nice topping to the pasta. I chose to use Italian mixed cheese. I also added 1/2 cup Parmesan shredded cheese to the top. This was a good dinner with garlic bread on the side!

I have been using the recipe for over 1 year now so I have made it about 5 or so times. My family loves it every time. The only adjustments I have made were taking out the mushrooms (husband is allergic), seasoned the meat while cooking(Italian seasoning, garlic powder, black pepper and a pinch of seasoned salt), ground turkey (no beef), and adding more cheese. Put it with garlic bread and you are good to go. This feeds my 2 sons, my husband and myself, with second helpings for everyone.

I made this for dinner tonight and I'm glad I did!  I just made a few changes.  It was only two of us, so I changed to 4 servings for leftovers.  I used some frozen meatballs (that I broke up) sauteed with onion, garlic, oregano, basil, and parsley.  In a bowl, I mixed sauce, about a cup of diced tomatoes, parm cheese, about half cup of shredded cheese, some more parsley, oregano, and oregano, the cooked pasta, and the meat.  I did not use mushrooms because I don't like them.  I then topped with the remaining shredded cheese!  It came out so good, my bf really liked it too!

This was very good as is. It was easy to throw together and didn't cost me much since I had ground venison in the freezer. The only thing I may try next time is to put dollops of a small container of ricotta cheese throughout and chop up some fresh parsley and mix that in. Like I said, it was quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive without these additions. A side salad would be a good pairing for this dish.

I used colored rotini and cheddar cheese because that is what I had available.  Used others suggestion of using Italian powdered salad dressing.

This was delicious!  I did make a few tweaks...  I used Italian sausage instead of beef (yum!), omitted the mushrooms, used 12 oz of penne noodles and a 33 oz jar of pasta sauce I had on hand.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic and a tsp of Italian Herb spice to the sausage and onion mix.  I saved about 1/2 cup of Mozzarella for the top of the casserole.  I made the casserole in the morning and stored covered until cooking in the pm. I left the foil on for the first half of the baking to keep it from drying out.  Very tasty!  Very easy!  Will make it again!

Everyone had seconds and some thirds!  This meal was a big hit with my hubby and 4 kids! I only tweaked a few things such as sautéed fresh minced garlic with the meat (I used MorningStar veggie crumbles on this one) and the last few minutes I pulled the foil off and added fresh parmesan and shredded mozzarella over top of pasta and finished the baking  time until melted and bubbly.  Served with a nice salad and Texas toast and everyone was too full after for even dessert! I keep recipes in order from absolute most favorites on top of the list and everyone asked to keep this one at the top!  Definitely making again :)

My picky family loved it. I made a few tweaks- rigatoni pasta, omitted the tomatoes (the Bertolli sauce I used had plenty) and onion powder instead of the onion. I seasoned the ground beef with onion powder, black pepper, and garlic pepper season salt when browning it. I also used 2 cups of the Kraft cheddar mozzarella blend instead of just mozzarella. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Being a long time lover of pasta, I felt the bake was very delicious, even more so when I added a few vegetables, and veggie beef. It was just as good as the original pasta bake.

I made changes and loved it.  While cooking the meat I added crushed garlic, oregano, tarragon, basil, parsley and a touch of salt. I also sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese at the top.

Easy and great with some modifications. I used much more cheese, and onions and green peppers go great in it as well.

I made this as posted. I think this could use more seasoning and maybe fresh veggies. Next time I'll try it with a different pasta sauce, but there will certainly be a next time! Thanks!

Really yummy and fairly cheap to make, which is great for a college student budget! I just added more cheese on top and then broiled for a few more minutes to get a golden, cheesy layer on top.

This is a  great base recipe & can be altered easily. Used ground turkey, dried porcini mushrooms, which I soaked in beef broth & drained well before adding to my sauce. As for herbs added dried basil, oregano, Tuscan seasoning, garlic powder & used reduced fat Italian cheese blend (health reasons). I should say the leftovers were as good as the first day. This is a keeper in my recipe file. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all.

This is an easy-to-put-together meal that is tasty.  Because  I felt it needed more moisture, I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I alsoI added pepperoni slices to the mixture, just because I had some to use up.  Made this in a 7 x 12 dish, and it fit perfectly.

I have been making this for years, except I leave out the mushrooms (my husband & I don't like them) & the mozzarella cheese. I put 1/2 to 1 cup (depending on taste) of  parmesan cheese, instead. I sprinkle 1 to 2 cups of mozarella cheese on top. My husband is a pretty picky eater, only wanting to eat basic foods, but he loves this

I make this only substitute Italian sausage for the gr beef, and since I'm not a mushroom person, I leave them out. Highly recommended for an easy dinner and also makes a great left over lunch.

Three as written but can easily be improved to five stars with a few modifications. I added two cloves of fresh garlic and fried the hamburger with the onion and garlic. I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned. I put the cheese on top only. This recipe desperately needs more flavor so I added Parmesan/Romano shredded cheese before I added the mozzarella on top. This is a cheat/easy supper.

We loved this dish. I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and in the future would also sprinkle some more cheese on the top midway through cooking.

I really enjoyed this because it only used 2 dishes and was quick and delicious with plenty of leftovers.

My husband and 2 year old also loved it.

Such a lifesaver for weeknight dinners.  My only change is a little less pasta sauce than the recipe calls for, just because an entire jar is A LOT and I don't want the pasta to get soggy.

This recipe is very good. Quick and definitely is good comfort food! I hesitated a bit, since I read so many discouraging reviews, so I decided to put a bit of powdered garlic. Everything else, I followed to a T.  Honestly, it was very,very good. My only suggestion for next time will definitely be a higher moisture mozzarella to add creamyness. For those who feel the recipe is bland, I would recommend to add garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and Italian herbs. However, in my opinion,  the key is in the spaghetti sauce you choose. I chose mushroom spaghetti sauce for its mildness. Choosing a garlic flavored sauce or choosing a chunky style may make the difference. Try it. Don't be discouraged. In my case, I will definitely make it again!

This was very quick and easy to prepare. I used items I had on hand, so my pasta was a blend of ziti, rotini and small shells (12 ounce package), I used 1/2 of a package of fresh mushrooms (which I sliced), a can of pasta sauce (24 ounces instead of 28) and 2 cups of Fiesta blend shredded cheese instead of mozzarella. I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorite easy recipes.

This was easy and I had most ingredients on hand.  A good one when you don't want a lot of fuss. I'll definitely make it again.

The whole family loved this, and it was so easy to make. Quick, easy recipes are a must when cooking for kids on busy weeknights, and this was perfect. The only change I made was using Ziti noodles because I already had those on hand.

really nice base for a pasta bake but needed a few modifications.   I added garlic and chopped zucchini to the meat while it was cooking. I also sprinkled in Italian seasoning, basil, parsley and oregano.  one jar of sauce wasn't quite most enough so I added a small can of tomato sauce add well.  I also sprinkled parmesan on top.  our came or moray and flavorful after 20 minutes.

The only change I made was to add garlic powder.  Since parmesan cheese is a staple at our house :) I let everyone add their own.  Add a green salad and you are good to go!   Excellent weeknight dish.

This was easy and delicious!  I made a couple of very minor changes by adding minced garlic and Italian seasoning while browning the meat and onion.  I also combined the meat mixture and pasta in the same pot that I cooked the pasta in (one less bowl to wash!).  Finally, I mixed only half the cheese into the mixture and used the rest to sprinkle on top before baking.  I will definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation.

Very good, but you have to play around for individual taste.  First time I made it, it was bland and did not have enough sauce for my taste.  The next time, I added a spicy sausage sauce with extra garlic, and 1.5 jars (I like a lot of sauce).

I followed the recipe.  This is nice large dish and is absolutely delious.  Wait until the third day and it's even better.  I will make it again but do so adding seasonings.

My husband said to save the recipe, which he rarely does unless I specifically ask him.  It's really tasty.  I used a "higher end" pasta sauce - it was a vodka cream sauce.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned - personal preference as relates to texture. Yum!

BIG aspect affecting flavor would be the choice of spag. sauce.  I think I'll use mix of ground beef & Italian sausage along with Italian spice .  Easy to make for a big , especially for a group.

This was a pretty easy recipe to make and it was delicious!  I did make some of the changes I read in other reviews which I certainly agreed with.  I added fresh mushrooms  and about two cloves of minced garlic when  I cooked the meat (I also used ground turkey instead of beef) along  with Italian seasoning and onions.   I used a shredded low fat 4 Italian cheese and rotini for the pasta.  Turned out excellent!

I would like this to have a bit more zing.  I used provolone and parmesan instead of mozzarella because that is what I had.  I also added a clove garlic and oregano.  Next time I think I will add spinach.

Added Italian seasoning and 2 cloves crushed garlic to ground beef when browning. Substituted 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms for canned ones. Left cover on baking dish until last 10 minutes of baking, then removed and finished baking. Moist and delicious with no dry edges. Easy, quick and a family pleaser.

I doubled the recipe and added fresh tomatoes, parsley and basil.  I also sautéed the  onions  with garlic and I added 1 lb sausage with 1lb sirloin.  I used mixed cheeses and topped it with Parmesan and oregano to give it tons of flavor.  I feel like this recipe is a good base and that there are lots of alternatives to make it your own.  My whole family loved it and since I doubled it I'll get 4 meals out of it for my family of five

Unless you make your own pasta sauce, you have to add the spices otherwise it's bland.  I'm glad someone wrote down the recipe for all to enjoy a quick, easy and delicious meal, served with crusty bread and a tossed green salad.  Thank you Jojolyn and NewMommy.

I made it vegetarian - I used veggie ground beef and cooked it and the onions and the mushrooms all together. I didn't "lightly" salt the pasta, I salted it heavily and added plenty of salt during the cooking of the veggie beef mix as well. The mozzarella seemed scant so I added plenty of parmesan. Before cooking I tossed the pasta with one egg. Finally, I made a mix of homemade marinara and vodka sauce and used that instead. Quick and easy!

I added fresh mushrooms, garlic and diced pepper to give it more flavor. Mixed part of the mozzarella in and the rest on top. Wanted a large hot dish for a crowd so I used more beef and pasta and baked it in a 10x14.

I never thought to do this before finding this recipe.  I change it a bit - I use italian sausage and after it's brown, I add a can of fire roasted tomatoes, a 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and onion powder (assuming I didn't use fresh).  Put a little sauce on the bottom of the baking dish.  Add the noodles (cooked first) and dump the meat and tomatoes on top.  Add the rest of the sauce and lots of yummy cheese on top.  I bake under aluminum foil for 30 minutes and then remove the foil for another 15-20 or until good and melted.  It's a winner, winner past dinner!  Never a bite left!

Made some modifications, I added sausage with the meat mixture, by slicing the sausage, I put a bed of pasta, meat, sausage, and sauce. Then another bed of pasta.Then I topped with cheese, baked then broil to brown the cheese. It was AWSOME!!! My coworkers loved it...

This is just ok for me. It's basically a quickie version of baked ziti - minus the best part, the ricotta cheese mixture. If I were to make this again, I would include a mixture of sour cream and ricotta cheese and consider layering it; ziti sauce mix, ricotta cheese sour cream mix, ziti sauce mix.  For me I think I'm missing that part!

Super easy, filling and yummy! I added two cloves of garlic (my family just loves garlic) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delish! Thank you for sharing!

I used a spicy spaghetti sauce for an extra flavor boost!  Yummy and CHEAP eats for the broke college student.

This is a good basic meal recipe. You can add what you like, change meat, go vegan, spice it up, etc. Reasonably quick to make fresh or make ahead of time and pop in oven when you want. Just add a salad, garlic bread, a glass of wine(or whatever you drink) and eat.

Very good. A bit dry once reheated. Everyone loved it. I made no changes to the recipe. Very similar to any type of spaghetti, honestely. It was nice to assemble everything early and then leave it till I threw it in the oven. I would definately make this again. Might use italian sausage next time.

It was good.... I added four cloves of fresh garlic to the mean and onion when cooking and some fresh mushroom.   I think it needed a little something extra, so I will definitely add something to it next time like fresh parmesan or something.  It was quick and easy, and with garlic bread and a salad, it made for a decent dinner.

Very good, I don't want to be one of those people that reviews after they changed the entire recipe but I did add the mushroom and onion to the ground beef while cooking with Italian seasoning and I then added a can of cheese soup after draining the beef mixture and heated that up before mixing everything together.  I only put grated cheese on the top of the pasta before baking.  I have had it both ways and both were delicious!!

FYI...  I also added some ground chili peppers to the mix for an added zip.

It's like making spaghetti but with one extra step at the end to make it extra delicious! Very easy for those days when my brain is tired so we can still have a delicious meal.

As I am eating the leftovers from last night, I can't help but smile at how amazing this dish is!  The only tweak I added to this was fresh garlic - this really was a nice touch. I will certainly make this again.
