This is my first step to a Keto diet and I chose this recipe because it is a casserole I can eat all week.  I need to have my food ready to stick to this.  I changed a couple of things as follows:  I omitted the oregano and added garlic and  cayenne pepper - didn't measure but was about 1/2 teaspoon each.  I added 2 cups of baby spinach.  I also used a whole large yellow onion and my onion was sautéed with the sausage.  After pouring the egg mixture over the sausage and onion I did stir it up to mix it all in.  I'm sure the addition of the spinach made it a big chunkier than just pouring egg over it.  Lastly I save about 1/2 cup of cheese to sprinkle around the top.  Bon Appetit!

Easy to make and prep for meal prep on keto. Others have too many more ingredients or specific  vegetables with certain amount of egg whites and regular eggs and other seasonings. This is simple and good, Only difference I did was double the sausage since i couldn't find an 8 oz package and it seem that was better as it covered the base of the baking pan evenly

I used one pound sausage, one teaspoon mustard powder. and a 9 x 9 pyrex. It took 35 minutes and it was perfect, Oh and I forgot the shredded cheese so I sprinkled it on top and another 5 minutes in oven. My family loved it for Christmas breakfast, I only did 4 stars because I cannot imagine trying to stretch a half pound sausage on bottom of pan, especially a 9 x 13 as specified in recipe. 
Thank you.

This was EASY. I cooked and crumbled mild chicken sausage the night before and spread it in the bottom of a 9x13 pan. The next day I added the egg mixture.  I used half the amount of mustard. Next time I’ll use the whole amount.  Baked up in about 15 minutes.

very good, plus easy to change to whatever you like. I like to cook this in muffin tins then wrap individually in saran wrap this makes it quick and easy to grab for work. I  make a lot because they freeze well

DELICIOUS!!! We're ok day 2 of this casserole, and my husband still can't stop talking about it!!! We have one more day of it, and I am almost sad to see it go. The eggs were perfect... I cut the recipe in half, but otherwise followed the egg recipe to a T. I added other veggies (more onions, mushrooms, and peppers) and did half sausage, half bacon, but the base was the same... sooooo yummy!!! Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

I followed the suggestions of a couple reviewers and used a 16-oz roll of sausage, but I used turkey breakfast sausage.  I don't care for a lot of mustard, so I used 1 tsp instead of 2 tsp dry mustard.  I added a bit of ground red pepper and served the casserole with salsa.  Yummy!  So easy, and will last all week!  This recipe will definitely be used a lot in my house!

This is an amazing base recipe! We are Jewish, so did turkey sausage for the meat. I have a fresh onion allergy in my household, so I subbed 1 tsp of onion powder for the fresh onion and we wanted a little smoky flavor, so I added a heaping 1/8 tsp of chipotle powder. Folks. Even my texture-sensitive, doesn't like anything remotely spicy, pickiest eater in the house devoured it! I am SO happy to finally have a healthy, easy to fix, go-to breakfast for those busy weekday mornings!

It was very good and easy to make. I didn't have fresh onion, so I used onion powder and instead of cheddar cheese, I used a shredded cheese blend. My dry mustard was too old, so I ended up using dijon. 
I halfed the recipe for just my husband and me and we have leftovers.

Love it!!  I've made one with bacon and have made one with sausage links.  It keeps well in refrigerator for days and can microwave single servings easily.

I made this twice and it came out great both times.  The dried mustard threw me a bit, but I didn’t change the recipe and I’m glad I didn’t.  Awesome low-carb breakfast option.

I used half spicy half original flavor sausage. I did not have heavy cream on hand so melted 1/4 c butter to 2/4 c milk and mixed it together. Also omitted ground mustard because not on hand. Added a tap of cream of tartar to the eggs to make them fluffy and viola! Turned out excellent!

A quick, easy keto breakfast - I halved the recipe, used pre-cooked sausage crumbles, and made it the night before.  I cooked it at 350 for 26 minutes in a glass casserole and it was perfect.  Reheated portions in microwave the next morning.  Will definitely be a regular in our keto meal rotation.

I only added a bit more sausage because I had it on hand and my boys love sausage, and as others I cut mustard in 1/2. Rest did as recipe.  My crowd loved it and it was perfect for Christmas brunch.  Next time will try maybe add spinach too. Super easy. Thank you!

It came together well but was a little bit bland. I might try to make it with a spicier sausage next time.

Easy Keto breakfast that is quick and tasty.  Can easily be put into muffin tins for a quick take to work or school breakfast.
