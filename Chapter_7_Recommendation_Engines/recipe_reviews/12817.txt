The first time I made this, I did not like the flavor of the canned shrimp at all, but it was decent enough to tink with.  The next time, I used 1lb medium fresh shrimp shelled and deveined.  Saute them before the vegetables, set the aside while cooking the vegetables and the sauce and readd at the last second.  Much tastier than canned!

I didn't use canned shrimp in this but used frozen, already cooked shrimp.  Since it was already cooked I just added the shrimp at the end and when the mixture started to boil again I served.  I didn't have the veggies called for so I used 2 vine tomatoes, which gave the sauce a bit of a pinkish color.  I didn't follow the instructions for adding the flour, but since it sounded like making a roux, I just did what I normally do.  I cooked the flour first, then added the milk and stirred to make sure there were no clumps.  Flour tastes like flour unless you cook it (very briefly so it won't burn), so that was my adjustment.  Bf seemed to love this, and I thought it was pretty good too.  I served over salmon burgers--his idea, and although it sounds weird, it worked.  We'll probably eat the leftovers over some pasta, maybe spaghetti, as I think it would go well with it.  Thanks for the recipe.
