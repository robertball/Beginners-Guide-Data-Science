WOWZA this is good! I was a little skeptical of putting one whole habanero in, but it's not too spicy at all. We drizzled this over some asparagus and it was delicious! Tonight I put it in our beef stirfry. YUM! This would be fantastic in pork or chicken lettuce wraps. Oh, the possibilities! For the wimps out there, just strain the sauce to remove the pepper (the horror!) before serving and it won't be as spicy. For us though, it's perfect. Definitely need to double this the next time I make it. Oh, and the only change I made was to use one sweetener packet instead of real sugar. Thanks so much for the great recipe Chris!

Just tried this and it was great! We are huge sauce people. (sauces are half of our fridge) This was super easy and just the right amount of kick! And thank you to Chris for reminding about the gloves. I always forget and am miserable for about 8 hours!

I only made half the recipe, well, I halved everything except the habanero, and it was still great. I wish I would have made a double batch now. I like the thought of this on a chicken wrap, as someone else mentioned, and I might try that tomorrow. I was eager to try it today and I ended up dipping pizza in it. It's very good and I think it would go well with a lot of different foods. I bought a lot of habaneros and actually made 3 recipes with them today (!), and this is my favorite. I'm already planning to make more of it.

I made it with jalapenos instead of habaneros due to availability and the flavor was fantastic!

this was awesome with some minor modifications.. i subbed apple cider vinegar for the malt, left out the water and added a splash of olive oil and a couple of tablespoons of sour orange juice.. blended everything and used this as a marinade for cubed up chicken breasts for kabobs.. heated up the marinade afterwards and returned the finished kabobs to coat.. i am so looking forward to making this again.. ty for the recipe

I stumbled upon this doing a quick search for "habanero".  It was hot without being overbearing.  The flavors worked so well together.  We used it as a dipping sauce for grilled pork and it was very delicious.

This is a smooth yet spicy sauce. To keep it gluten free I had to use a gluten free Chinese black vinegar instead of malt vinegar. It has a malty, smoky flavour but accented the habanero in a way like no other. Thank you for the recipe.
