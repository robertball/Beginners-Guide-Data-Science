I loved this recipe.  I made it even easier by using salsa instead of the tomatoes.  It's so good and easy.  I really liked the taste of the flavors together.  I would totally make this again.

This recipe is very good. The only thing I would keep in check next time, is the salt content as I forgot that Spanish chorizo is actually a bit on the salty side. As of anything else, really is a good breakfast or quick meal. By the way, I used Spanish smoked paprika (pimentón) and really the pinch I added gave it that Spanish flavor I so remember while living there!

A couple minor changes... we are in Mexico so I used 3 Spanish chorizo links (casing removed and crumbled as it fried).. also didn’t have cherry tomatoes so chopped up Roma tomatoes.... other then having to drain excess oil it turned out perfect ??... served with tortillas and a little grated cheese.

I used two tablespoons of heavy cream in my eggs.  I couldn't find any hot paprika so I used regular paprika and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  My chorizo was of the dry variety. This is an excellent dish!

I love this. In Lima, Peru, we make iot witha localchorizo or sausage called Salchicha de Huacho. It is hot and has mint .  I suppose many countries with spanish traditions will have local varieties.  Mexico for example.

We made this and served it inside hash brown nests with a simple mixed green side salad and fresh berries topped with whipped cream.  Some crusty bread and olive oil to dip the bread and of course mimosas!   Wonderful brunch at home that felt like we were back in Europe on vacation.  Will definitely make again.
