I lived in Brazil, in the state that made this bread famous, for almost 5 years. I was so excited when I read the "bad" review that the bread was "rubbery." That is exactly the way it's supposed to be! Yeah! I did take out the garlic as that's not a normal thing for this bread, and I switched the ratio of water and oil as there was WAY too much oil in it. Overall, was great to find this recipe. My husband loves it and it helps with the home sickness!

This recipe turned out perfectly for luncheon today - crispy on the outside, almost creamy on the inside. My children loved it and decided it tastes like Cheetos only better! I used the exact proportions stated in the recipe but omitted the garlic because I wanted the cheese to predominate. 
If you don't let the dough rest 15 minutes before you put in the cheese and egg, it will be very runny like a crepe batter. 
Things I Did Differently:
I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil and warmed the liquid ingredients in the microwave until a little white foam appeared on the top of the mixture. I did the rest of the mixing as instructed except I hand kneaded the dough a bit in the bowl to get a smoother mixture. I used the 1 & 1/2 inch scoop that I use to make drop cookies to put the dough on the cookie sheet. But then, I went back and rolled each little ball between my well-oiled hands to smooth them. I had to bake them a little longer, but then, my oven's always slow.

I am from Minas Gerais and since I grew up having the convenience of finding these everywhere, I never bothered to learn how to make them. It took me moving to California to finally try making my own pão de queijo from scratch, so I tried this awesome recipe and it was absolutely perfect. On a personal note, I preferred to use the butter instead of olive oil, I tried both and found that one more authentic tasting.

I am from Brazil and am so grateful to have found this recipe. A few changes to make it taste like the original dish: NO garlic whatsoever, real butter instead of oil and more cheese (about 2/3 cup more cheese). I like to add 1 cup of Italian blend shredded cheese and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Now for beginner cooks like me: make sure all the butter is melted before adding the flour, the consistency of it will be way better ;)

This is the best recipe i've used to far! I would like to point out a few things to those who've had bad results: 
1) heat the water/oil/milk to boiling then the tapioca will seize.
2) when it says to mix till smooth, think more like 10 mins + by hand or use a dough hook on a stand mixer for 3-4 mins...that will help the texture & the air bubbles form.
3) try a mix of parm & queso fresco for a nicer texture.

I grew up in Brazil.  This is a great recipe but has one significant problem. The ingredients really need to be put into a blender, as the Brazilians do.  Otherwise it is difficult for the ingredients to properly incorporate and you may find that your oil or butter does not adhere, but leaks out into the pan. Other than this I would give the recipe five stars.  It is also simpler to mix in a blender, and you do not have to heat ingredients in a pan first. If you try substituting cheeses other than parmesan, make sure to use a dry cheese.  Something moist like mozarella will not give the same result.  I hope this helps someone.

Pao de Queijo, I can't believe I found a recipe for it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I love this stuff.  (Btw the super dense, rubbery, super flavor is intentional.)

I added probably another cup of flour because the batter was very runny and first they came out as little pancakes. Next time I will also add more cheese - I just think it could use more. Other than that, it tasted almost as good as the ones that our Brazilian friends make from store bought frozen cheese bread balls.

I took some ideas from this recipe and another one.  I put more milk and another egg.  I also put a lot more (cheddar) cheese.  I think the garlic gave it a good flavor, but it needs a little salt.  It wasn't as good as I had in Brazil.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but after it baked it flattened out instead of staying in the shape of balls.

My husband grew up in Brazil, and he says these are just like the ones he used to eat there -- only much bigger.  I made it mozzarella cheese.  Next time I make it, I will make them maybe a quarter of the size the recipe suggested.  That will also mean more of the yummy outside (I wasn't as big a fan of the rubbery inside, but my husband was!)

SO GOOD!!!!

I read through a bunch of the "most helpful" reviews and incorporated a few changes:  I used 1/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup water. Melt butter in pot, add water, milk, and salt. Put tapioca flour in bowl, add boiling liquid mixture. Mix with fork until too difficult to mix with fork. “Mix” for 10 minutes by alternating between pulling/ripping into pieces and kneading with my knuckles
like regular bread dough. Let rest 10 minutes. Knead in eggs and cheese by hand. Roll into small balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet. (They don’t really rise so you don’t have to space them out much.) Bake for 18 minutes at 375.

You WILL think you’ve messed them up. (You haven’t.) It is a very weird consistency from beginning to end. Mixing the egg and cheese in is difficult because the dough seems to be already set - you’re not so much mixing it as breaking up the bread dough so much that the little pieces get scrambled with
tiny clumps of egg/cheese mix. I just kept squishing it through my fingers over and over until there didn’t seem to be any big clumps of bread dough left. 

I dip them in marinara sauce and they're fabulous. I think this would be an excellent base for some garlic cheese knots, too, and who knows what else. It's so hard to find a good gluten-free bread base and this stuff is AMAZING.

Made again...this time using grapeseed oil and mozzarella cheese.  Fantastic.  Also I found that if you pour the hot oil/milk/water mixture into a bowl that has the tapioca flour in it already it's much easier to mix.  Also only used 1 tsp of minced garlic.  Also used my hands when adding egg and cheese.  They turned out awesome!

I have given this bread 1 star for flavour, and wow has it got flavour, oooh those garlic's.  I am not sure if it was something I did but they came out very rubbery.  They are definitely eaten warm/hot.

I love this cheese bread. It is similar to the colombian Pan de Yuca. I'll post the recipe for it here, as well as some other traditional colombian "parva".

These are gluten free and very cheap to make. They are rubbery inside but that is the fantastic part about them. They are actually chewy which is a hard texture to reproduce without gluten! I did omit garlic added twice the salt and you have got to let theses rest at least 10 minutes after the mixture is made. The longer you let it rest the puffier they get. ALSO its a good idea to bring everything to a boil then let it all completely cool add the eggs to the cooled liquid with the cheese and flour this way you only have to knead it once. Other wise it a pain to incorporate the dough into the eggs and cheese. You can use any soft cheese you want.

This recipe was awesome!  When I told my husband (who introduced me to Pao de Queijo) that someone had complained that it was chewy, he said, "that's the way it supposed to be!"  I made it exactly like the recipe (used the butter instead of olive oil) for our Easter Dinner and he could not stop oohing and ahing about them.  The only complaint he had was that they were TOO big!  He said that the ones he's had have been about a 1/3 of that size.  He thought that a 2" scooper would have been the perfect size.  I will make these again and again!
Quick Tip: Want to make sure that this sticky batter comes out of your scooper with ease?  Spray the inside of the scoop with Pam and they'll just slide right out in nice round balls!

This has become the backbone of my gluten free breads.  I substitute 1/2 cup sorghum flour with the tapioca flour, add fennel seed, and switch between parm. cheese and sharp cheddar as the mood strikes me.

You have to make some adjustments to this recipe if you want the dough to come our correctly. I experimented and researched other recipes and I increased the flour to 2 cups plus 1/3 cup and 1tbsp. After letting it sit I added the cheese and 1 egg at a time kneading the egg into the dough thoroughly each time. The dough is sticky so you will need to oil your hands before rolling into balls. I increased the cheese slightly also. They came out perfect!

TOO MUCH OIL/BUTTER!!!! I made this recipe twice today; 1st- to the letter, 2nd- using less butter and adapting the recipe as follows:
1) Shredded Mozarella Cheese (1 & 1/2 C.) plus Grated Parmesan & Romano blend (1/3 C.)
2) 1/4 C. butter
3) No garlic

My Brazilian husband approved! 

I will say, this recipe uses too much oil BUT the flavor and texture are good. Nice recipe to play with! 

Thank you SO MUCH for sharing! Now I don't have to go the Brazilian market and spend tons of $$ on ingredients. =)

I followed the recipe exactly and was not happy with the results! Not Brazilian at all.  Very chewy, doughy, and too much garlic flavor.  They didn't even form balls.  Reminded me more of something from Red Lobster.  Anyway, choose a recipe with more flour (and/or manioc) flour and only 1 egg.

The proportions in this recipe are off.  2 cups of tapioca flour resulted in soup--no way to make 1/4 cup size "balls."  Plus, when it says mix will be chunky it is smooth, but where it says smooth it is chunky.  The bottom line:  Added another 1/2 cup of flour and still ended up with cheese flatbreads.  Taste was not bad but the idea that this recipe results in fluffy "balls" is laughable.

I love pao de queijo. As a brazilian I've had it every other day my entire life. This recipe is good but I made a few changes. I did not add olive oil or garlic because traditionally those ingredients are not used. As I am in the U.S.A. right now I had to use an alternate to the ''queijo de minas'', so I used cojita cheese because I think it's a pretty good replacement. The cojita cheese can be salty depending on the one you buy so be careful with how much salt you add. Overall it's good recipe and the paes de queijo turn out great every time.

We have been looking for a great Cheese bread recipe since 2 Brazilian restaurants we've been to that had these delectable munchies. The first was OK, but didn't have that unique flavor and spongy/gooey center quite right.   In our 1st attempt on this recipe, they came out tastier than the restaurant ones. The garlic was a nice addition and the insides were perfect. The weird bubbly exterior also was exactly that unearthly fun look we were hoping for. This is the recipe you were looking for folks.

I made these because my granddaughter eats gluten-free.  However everyone likes them so much,  they are now a regular menu item when the family comes over.  They like them small and crunchy,  so I have found that baking them in small muffin tins works out perfectly.  Also,  I bake them until well browned.  They are delicious warm. I also add shredded cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, and sometimes I add chopped spinach as well.

These were very good--flavor was fantastic.  Next time, I will make them much smaller to get more of the crusty outside and less of the gooey inside.

Update:  I made them much smaller (2 bites) and they were much better.  Tried freezing them after baking and texture suffers--very chewy.  Have an unbaked batch (with Asiago instead of Parmesan) in the fridge right now to see how that works.  I will update with results.

I'm from Brazil and we love cheese bread. I'm not a good cook and I was afraid of trying this recipe but I confess it surprised me! It is easy to make and DELICIOUS!!!! You have to eat it hot though or it will taste like "rubber" when it cools off. Make sure you let the milk boil and then you add the flour. Mix very well, around 10 min until it looks like "couscous". I mixed 1 cup (or more) of Mexican cheese blend and it was fantastic!!!

This recipe is amazing. Tastes like the real pao de queijo from Minas Gerais, and is so simple to make. I am a Brazilian living in US for over 10 years and is the first time I made a sucessful pao de queijo,..all other recipes i have tried have been  a failure so far, this one is easy and is just delicious!!

This recipe must have been updated since some of the earlier comments were posted.  My dough was very, very thick.  I followed the directions exactly, but left out the garlic as I wanted a more traditional roll.  They turned out great.  I also made them smaller.  I used eggs from the farmer's market, which have very yellow yolks, so my rolls turned out much "yellower".

I was dismayed that when I added the tapioca starch, a lot of the oil separated out, so I put it in an electric mixer and that made it better...although I suspect it doesn't matter.  We absolutely loved these rolls, and it works fine to use garlic powder (1/4 tsp.) and parmesan cheese in a can, if you need to.

This is a wonderful recipe!  For anyone eating gluten-free, this gives a wonderful, flavorful bread that is  not grainy and doesn't fall apart.  The texture is unique and addictive!  My whole family loves it.  It freezes well and is almost like fresh when you heat it a FEW seconds in the microwave.  My whole family loves this!  I vary the amount of garlic depending on what a batch will be used for.  I also switch from Parmesan to Motzarella from time to time.  I also use half olive oil and half butter to cut down on the butter content.

I made them and they were cheesy but much more dense than expected.  My kids said that they were okay.  I like the chewy consistency but wished they were a little "lighter"

I made this and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone could not stop raving about it. :) I made it because my mom can not eat gluten, so this was a great way for her to eat bread. I made it first, and then I topped it with tomatoes, chives, cheese, basil, olive oil mixture and made brushetta. Usually brushetta is on really crispy, crunchy bread... but this was great. :) It was nice with the creamy inside.

To make this recipe more versatile I omitted the garlic and the cheese. I was then able to use these tiny rolls for any kind of sandwich I wanted. The dough is very similar to what I used to use for cream puffs! It can be shaped to make little pita like pockets, too, and even an individual sized pizza crust. Yum.

This did not work well for me.  But I tried substituting flaxseed for the eggs, so that may be why.  I will try again while following the recipe exactly and see what I get.

Was delicious! Used butter per reviews from the Brazilians. Everything else I followed. I did make sure all the clumps of powder were gone before I baked it. It wasn't at all watery like some other reviews said. I was worried about that, and put each scoop in a mini muffin pan, but I think that made the bread more dense, and not as round. 
Hard to stop eating. Be careful. ;o)

Turned out good, however, I almost didn't continue after adding the tapioca flour and garlic.  It said to mix until smooth and it immediately got thick and tough to mix (as though I didn't add enough liquid). I used butter (not oil) and will add a little additional milk next time.  Since I was working with the consistency of a moist dough ball after adding the eggs and cheese, I made round balls and put them on a cookie sheet and had to bake approx. 25 min.  They cooked the same size and shape as they were placed on the sheet. They were a bit gooey on the inside but fully cooked so I think they turned out as intended.  I just had a hard time with what I expected when mixing and what actually happened.  I'm glad I stuck with it and cooked them anyway.  You could definitely taste the garlic, so eliminate it if you don't want the extra richness.  Others had mentioned the mix being too thin?  Since mine was just the opposite, I can only assume that using oil instead of butter may be the only factor that could have made the difference.  Regardless, my husband and I liked them and my 15 year old couldn't stop eating them (and they were the size of large meatballs!).

Very much like Yoki Bread mix that I buy in the Latin food aisle in the grocery, supposedly a taste of Colombia I think.  They are rubbery and very strong cheese flavor, supposed to be that way, made with tapioca starch.  Look for it in your store, I live in FL where there is a heavy south american influence.

I couldn't find tapioca flour at my near by grocery store so I substituted it with wheat flour. I mixed the ingredients together as suggested in the recipe but it seemed a bit runny so I added another cup of flour. All together the bread was delicious, but the texture of the bread ended up being more like a biscuit (with the wheat flour at least).

I have lived in Canada for the past 15 years and  greatly miss the delicious pão de queijo we have in Brazil. This is a great recipe but needs the few adjustments below to make it more solid and with an authentic taste. 
- use 1 and 1/3 cups of cheese (parmesan cheese gives the best flavour). Add more flour if your dough is too liquid.
I DO NOT USE GARLIC FOR AN AUTHENTIC TASTE.
Cooking time was 20 minutes AT 375 degrees (f).

Yummy! i fell in love with these scrumptious rolls when we were in Brazil and was excited to find a recipe for them. I omitted the garlic like other reviewers and they turned out wonderfully. I also took them to a couple of potlucks and had everyone asking for the recipe.

The taste was certainly close to authentic ergo a bit buttery.  Mine flattened as soon as they began cooking even though they started out as balls. Will keep looking for a recipe that doesn't flatten and would certainly use much less butter in this recipe

As a Celiac, I am always looking for something that resembles bread.  I went to a Brazilian restaurant, and was told to try them.  Labelled as "Tapioca Cheese Buns" I shied away - buns?  I don't want to get sick in a restaurant.  The waitress made me try them, and i fell in love!  
So I wanted to make them at home, and these are definitely even better than the ones in the restaurant!  I have tried with mozza cheese, and cheddar, but parmesan is definitely the best tasting!  I make these at least once a week since I have discovered them!  Nom Nom!

These are crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle, and a great vehicle for loads of butter. Most cheeses that can be shredded will work in the recipe, though the chewiness/dryness ratio in the final product varies depending on the type you use. With a newly developed gluten sensitivity and a longstanding passion for baking, I was ecstatic to find a no-hassle recipe that's so much like an English muffin, but even faster to make!

I love this recipe!  I have used it dozens of times.   I make this as a gluten free pizza crust.  The bread stays nice and flat if you spoon it out and flatten it with your fingers (keep a bowl of water nearby for easy spreading) Yum!

I didn't know it was that easy to make pao de queijo, I love it. I think feta cheese works better then parmesan though. I also have tried with goat cheese and garlic as well.

The only changes I made were to use half butter half olive oil and mixture of parmesan and mozarella cheese. I forgot to add some herbs. I think adding some italian herbs will enhance the smell and taste. The garlicky and buttery taste complement very well. The bread is very crusty (oh so wonderful when you tease it apart) and the inside is a but gummy (expected as the main flour ingredient is tapioca). Perhaps next time I will substitute some  of the tapioca flour with millet flour (for its cornmeal like texture. This recipe is definitely a keeper! I will rate it 4.5 stars!

I'm also from Brazil and was craving for these. I LOVED it!!! I've made it countless times already and I keep getting asked for the recipe :)

I did not use the garlic though, and used the oil instead of butter. Super easy to make, and fills me & my family with happiness. Thanks for sharing!

These were perfect!  Nice and chewy on the inside just like our favorite Brazilian restaurant.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little mozz cheese also.  Thanks!

Really good! Even better than the bread we had at a Brazilian restaurant last night. We used butter instead of oil and also a mix of parmesan and "Mexican blend" cheeses. Thank you!

I made this for my first Gourmet Club meet (theme was Brazilian food).  Everyone thought it was great!  Just be prepared that it will have a rubbery texture and the dough was more doughy than cottage cheese-like.  I omitted the garlic and rolled smaller balls; chose butter over oil; regular milk over soy.  The only thing I would change is add more cheese...at least a full cup.  Defintley will make these again.

This bread was wonderful.  My mom's gluten intolerent and my family loved the recepie.  I almost though that there was something wrong with the recipe because of the rubbery center but After looking around at the other reviews, I was relieve to find out after reading the review section that cooks from Brazil said that the rubbery texture was how it was supposed to turn out.  It's definitely something to make again, though next time I'll reduce the amount of oil.

Has a decent flavor, but there is something "interesting" about it.  Maybe next time I'll add a different cheese or throw in some cheddar.  It's never good when something tastes interesting.  Maybe the flavor of the flour is coming through too well.

It had a good flavor. The outside was good but the texture inside was stretchy, gooey, don't quite know how to explain it. Maybe substitute some rice flour or something for some of the tapioca next time.

The flavour was amazing, and made my house smell like cheese bread for hours, but mine did not cook like the photo shows, the outside cooked perfectly and inside remained a bit rubbery and clear - though still cooked. Recipe worked better with butter than oil for me.

First time using tapioca flour and the texture is delicious! I used whatever cheese I have at hand - pepper jack, feta, pecorino Romano and parmigiana reggiano - shredded and mixed it all together and they turned out great. I also increased the amount of cheese to about 1.5cup. Overall the kids loved it! Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was incredible. I have no idea if it’s authentic but it’s delicious and super easy. My family couldn’t stop eating them, and almost immediately begged for more. They were cheesy and garlicky and the texture was just perfect. Love!!

Simple and easy recipe and turned out great each time.  I left out the garlic and used half the amount of butter.  I baked them in mini muffin tins for 15 mins and got 36 bite size pieces.  Kids loves them so much, especially when the cheese bread are still warm.

Made these for the first time, and my family loved the flavor!  Already asking me to make more, and I definitely plan to do that!
I do have a question for anyone who might be able to help -
I have never cooked with tapioca flour before.  I found the texture of my rolls to be pretty chewy, almost a little rubbery - didn't detract from the taste at all, but I'm wondering if that is how they are intended to be, or did I have my proportions of ingredients off?  Or not cook long enough?

Amazing! Oh so wow. I omitted the garlic, used unsalted butter & 3/4 tsp of salt but kept the other proportions the same. It was already the consistency of dough after mixing in the tapioca flour. I waited 15 minutes & mixed in the eggs & cheese by hand. After a few minutes it went from a sticky mess to a more dough like consistency. I baked them for 20 minutes & they're perfect!

I chose to simplify the recipe to see whether a number of short cuts will be okay. The good news is that I halved the recipe across the board, and the results are an astounding success! Unfortunately, my family isn't here so I have to eat them all. My mods? No pre cooking. Add an egg and the olive oil and whisk them till blended which is easy. Add fresh garlic. Whisk milk/water mixture which is really easy. Whisk in the tapioca powder and then whisk in shredded parmasean. The mixture was a bit runny so I used a butter-coated non stick standard muffin tin, and used a 1/4 cup measurer, scooping portions into all six vessels (a whole recipe will yield 12 gorgeous mouth-watering portions). Baked at 400 degrees and watched till the tops were puffy and light brown, while the edges at the tims were colored like grilled cheese. They popped out so easy and didn't have the puffy inside but not runny-gooey but just perfectly done. And the taste was outstanding. It's now my go-to recipe because I removed the stove top step, which made me not want to try the recipe before. If you have any portions left, I would be shocked.

That is a texture I've never had before...kind of cool, but my wife didn't like it.  That said, these things didn't have much in terms of flavor going on. I did like dipping them in red pasta sauce though.

This recipe was great! My husband is Brazilian from Minas Gerais and he thought this was so delicious. Just a couple of modifications: even though we LOVE garlic, it really doesn't need to go in the bread. It would have been better without. Could use a tad bit more salt. Also, a lot of other people said to reduce the oil, so we put 1/3 cup olive oil instead of 1/2 cup. They chewy or "rubbery" texture of them is completely normal and is how they are supposed to be. I may add a little mozzarella cheese or Brazilian cheese next time.

This is wonderful!  I have made it several times.  It is best right out of the oven.  I use butter, no garlic and twice the amount of Parmesan or Romano cheese.  It ways turns out crisp and chewy.

Really simple, really good, and totally satisfies the bread craving.  Tried it a second time with sugar and cinnamon instead of garlic and cheese...must have done something wrong because they turned to a strange sort of hard jelly inside.  Maybe I'll stick to the original recipe.  Lol!

I couldn't find tapioca flour and somewhere on the internet it said to use 1/4 cup cornstarch and 3/4 cup regular flour for 1 cup of tapioca flour.  So that is the substitution I used.  I also used butter instead of oil and regular milk, not soy.  Added about 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar along with the parmesan.  Rolled the dough into 1.5 inch balls (made about 12).  Baked for just over 20 mins.  Came out good but a bit dry.  Maybe it would've been moister if I were able to use tapioca flour.  All in all, they were really tasty!!

My husband lived in Brazil for 2 years and was ecstatic to have me make this! I made it for the first time a couple of years ago as written, and he loved it but was not so into the garlic as other reviews mentioned (this is not an authentic part of a Brazilian Cheese bread). I make it now with no garlic and the water and oil ratios switched, and it is perfect. Thanks!!

I love this recipe! They are so chewy and satisfying. I have also made these with cheddar cheese instead of parm and they are equally delicious.

I thought these were great. My wife (Brazilian) didn't care for them much, said she'd never heard of anyone putting garlic in them before.

I lived in Brazil with my husband for 3 months and ate alot of these. So I made Pao de Quijo yesterday with some modifications: I put just a bit of garlic because Brazilian Pao de Queijo doesn't smell like garlic. I am sure with garlic it's delicious, but I wanted authentic Brazilian bread. Also, I used veggie butter. If you are not vegetarian, use regular butter. I am not sure how it will come out with olive oil. I just know that our Brazilian housekeeper used butter when making bread. She was an awesome cook).

Great recipe, you can omit garlic or add herbs if you want to be adventurous.  If your batter ends up being runny, just scoop them into mini-muffin tins and they work just fine...and yes, the "rubbery" texture is normal.

Really good recipe. Although i am not Brazilian and never been to Brazil, the bread tasted exactly as it does in my favorite Brazilian restaurant.

I did NOT add the garlic (i prefer the taste of the butter and the cheese over the garlic).

We have a Brazilian foreign exchange student living with us and I wanted to make her a taste of home. 
I only used 1 tsp of garlic, and mine had to bake for 25 minutes. She said they were PERFECT...exactly like at home. Thanks!!!

From reading reviews, I understand that the rubbery texture is correct.  However, it's just too different for me.  We didn't like it at all.

I had never made these before, but was looking for a gluten free bread recipe for my husband. I tried them a few days ago and they were delicious!! The flavor reminded me of the cheddar bay biscuits at Red Lobster. They were a little too dense, but that might have been my fault. I substitued apple sauce for the oil and only had brown rice flour. I agree with some of the other reviews to add more cheese and if you are a garlic lover like me, add more of it too. Thanks for the recipe and I will surely make this again!!

My hubby, who is gluten free, was so excited when I made these for him. He really loved them, even reheated. I used the garlic, because we love it, and I also used Italian Blend cheese (because it is what I had). Again, he loved them and they were for him.... 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!!

This did not turn out right, instead of being chewy and (almost gooey) on the inside, it was sandwich bread-like.

I added more tapioca flour after realizing that my first batch could not rise. 

I think there’s too much egg (impacting texture)and oil (impacting rise) in it.

I have eaten an irresponsible amount of pão de queijo in my life, from various parts of Brazil, the US and Portugal.  This was the first time that I made it from scratch (I have made a ton using Yoki mix).  I used butter and omitted the garlic (traditional pão de queijo doesn't have it).  The dough was way too wet, with the consistency was like thick pancake batter.  I added more tapioca flour, but it only helped a little. The dough should be thick enough so you can actually roll it into balls.  I poured it onto the cookie sheet.

The resulting bread was okay, but not great.  The texture was correct, but the shape was like a poofy pita bread. For what it is worth, pão de queijo should not have garlic or any other spices.  I think if you use butter, you need to compensate for the extra liquid in the butter (e.g. less milk).  Overall it has most of the right ingredients, but the ratios are off.

Suggestions: 
Less liquid
No spices
More cheese
Use tablespoon instead of 1/4 cup for scooping the dough
Roll dough into balls

I removed 2 tbs less butter and added an extra  1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese. It came out perfect! My fav recipe from now on. Some I added a piece of cheddar cheese in the center and others I added leftover pepperoni. So good!

Love these! always a big hit. I don't add garlic and I use lactose free milk... like that will help any with all the cheese but it's all good! I also go super heavy on the parmesan. Like really really heavy. You can't go wrong. You also need to get good quality parmesan.. Don't skimp out and get Kraft - trust me, its definitely not the same and won't cook or taste as good.  ;-)

I’ve never had Brazilian cheese bread before so I didn’t know what to expect. After reading many reviews, I followed the recipe using butter instead of oil, 2% milk, and cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan because I didn’t have any. I did use the garlic because I love garlic. They did come out crispy on the outside and rubbery on the inside like they should. I’m not sure if I will make these again because of the rubbery texture but if I do I will try it with Parmesan cheese.

These turned out excellent! We go to Fogo de chao once a year on our anniversary and I always fill up on these. I’m thrilled to have found a recipe to make my own. This recipe was quick and easy. I will be making them many more times in the future. I left them in just a little too long thinking they weren’t cooked but they were.

I made them and i thought the batter/dough did not come out right, so i kind of sloppily balled up half of the dough/batter and threw out the rest.  Came out really GREAT!!!  They puffed up just like they were supposed to and of course i regretted having thrown out half the batter/dough mix.  I've been making these for the past 3 Saturdays because my son (and I, of course) both love them so much.  I omitted the garlic because from youtube videos, no one put garlic in them.

Based on Brazilian restaurant and frozen Brazilian pao from the store, I think these turned out right in the end (skipped garlic, used shredded manchego cheese). But, I don’t see how the 2 cups of tapioca will make a mixture with the 1/2 cup plus 2/3 cup liquid ingredients. Mine made a clumpy dough that could not be mixed (let alone with a whisk). I persevered because the cheese and egg would add more moisture but I still had a fairly dry and not very cohesive dough- not like ricotta at all.  Even though I expected “chewy” I think these were a bit dense. I would try again another time and watch the measurements, but I may also look for another recipe, too.

Recipe as is tastes great, but the sodium content is
unacceptable. It's the salt in the cheese,plus the
tsp of salt you call for.   If I make it again, I will 
a) find lowest sodum content cheese available, and
b) eliminate the added salt, .

Update - we made it again and added about 1/3 cup more cheese and all butter. Well, here’s what happened: the bread puffed up a bit but then deflated almost right away, making the bread very flat. We might make it with half butter and half olive oil next time and maybe a bit less cheese. We may even decide to sprinkle cheese on the bread at the end and finish in the oven. Otherwise taste is very good and we still really love this recipe! 

We have a place here that makes these and they’re amazing, but seem to be quite expensive - which is why we looked up this recipe. Our first try came out pretty good, though we all agreed they were left in a bit too long for our tastes. Also, we would like a bit more cheese. So next time, we will probably cut a few minutes from the max cooking time and add a bit more cheese and maybe even some garlic salt to top it off. This is a wonderful, reliable recipe that we will use for years to come!

I add a 1/2 cup of cheese. 1/3 grated parmesan and the rest with either fresh or shredded mozzarella, depends on my cheese budget. If you can afford it, choose fresh cheese! Also, I only use 1 large egg. I like to cover cookie sheet with aluminum foil and baste it with butter to make it really nonstick, then after I take it out of the oven and baste the little bread balls with butter while it's still hot. LOVE these heavenly breads so much!

Absolutely delicious, exactly what I expected, these are amazing and delicious. Will definitely be making again using this recipe. Because the dough is more of a batter and spreads easily, I used an oiled mini muffin sheet to contain the breads. It worked SO well.

Loved them. Easy to follow recipe and they tasted great. A little too dense, but I think that was my fault for working the dough too much. I will make these again.

Turned out great. They were very tasty  just as directed. Everyone liked them in my house. I'm not sure what I could have done differently to make them smooth and round like the pictures. Maybe I needed to hand roll them instead of scooping and dropping them. Tasty either way.

I used the ingredient amounts as listed, aside from increasing the cheese by an additional 2/3 cup as stated in a previous review and they turned out great!  I have made this several times and prefer using butter instead of oil. Awesome recipe! Thanks!

I've been trying to get the perfect recipe for this, and it never comes up just right. This time, it did! I used avocado oil (but I'm sure olive oil would work great) and baked it in my convection oven for 12 minutes. Substituted grated Mexican cheese for 1/2 the parmesan. They look/smell yummy!

I really like it, i love it. the only thing was really hard to make the round shape mostly for presentation, but the consistency , flavor and quality was super. I also did not include garlic, since its not part of the traditional pao de queijo.

This has become a go-to recipe for me. I love making them as a side dish with soup! The only thing I've changed is that I make them smaller - about half the size of the 1/4 cup directions, but that's just a preference thing. I should branch out to try different cheese, but parmesan is just so good!

These came out OK.  Not even close to what is served at Fogo, but considerably better than the last attempts (recipe from a different site).  Not sure what I can alter to improve the ultimate result.  At least they are edible!

When I was a kid, my family hosted Brazilian exchange students for three summers. They taught us how to make a lot of things, but pao de queijo was hands down my favorite. I hadn’t tried any in years since I didn’t have a recipe, but found myself thinking about them and the time we spent in the kitchen together. I stumbled upon this recipe, and decided to make them for Thanksgiving. It’s safe to say they were a huge hit, and my family and I couldn’t stop talking about how nostalgic those amazing cheesy, fluffy buns are. And yes, they are supposed to be “rubbery.” Hands down my new favorite recipe.

Taste so good just like the ones in the Brazilian restaurants.  Very easy to make, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil to equal the 1/2 cup oil needed.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I'm eating lectin-free so have not had bread in 6 weeks. These were just as good as the ones I've had at Brazilian restaurants here in LA. I'll be making them many times!

I have made this recipe many times, and it is always phenomenal. Use different cheeses (cheddar, swiss, parmesan), add herbs, even leave the cheese out- they are always good! You can also use this recipe for pizza crust, cinnamon rolls (without the cheese), and if you make the rolls bigger, make great hamburger buns. My favorite is to make them in 1 inch balls , use extra sharp cheddar, and eat while still warm, although once they have cooled, they have  an internal texture similar to croissants.

Best recipe until now!

I made it with the minced garlic and 1 cup grated old amsterdamer cheese. Next time I’ll try to make them a little smaller.

Fabulous! It’s so great to have a recipe that is a gluten-free option for bread. I use 1/2 cup of butter, 2/3 cup of whole milk, and add extra cheese (my go-to is 2/3 cup of parmesan and 2/3 cup pecorino totaling 1 1/3 cup of cheese).

Bomb!! Our au pair is Brazilian and she keeps bringing these things home from little Brazilian Delia and Markus she runs into. They come pre-made in a box and are delicious but expensive. This recipe is dead on!! From other reviews I used butter instead of oil (yes!!), used a bit more Parmesan than the recipe called for (also yes!), and I dropped them with a portion tool onto the greased baking sheet then coated my hands with olive oil and made them smooth and round, then rolled them in a bit more cheese (because why not?!). Parmesan is the way to go. So chewy and good almost like the whole thing is made of cheese!

I did not read the directions correctly and let the boiled milk mixture sit for 15 minutes BEFORE adding in the tapioca, and then the cheese (I used half parmesan and half extra sharp cheddar). I ended out with a very liquid batter and so I greased my mini muffin tin and poured in the batter and baked as usual. They came out perfectly!

The next time I made them I followed the directions.  Not only was it more work cuz I had to drop and shape each bread onto a cookie sheet, but they didn't come out nearly as nicely--go figure!  I'll do them the next time using the "mistaken" method.

I followed the recipe precisely and these flattened out like very flat cookies.  They taste amazing but are flat.  I'm not sure if there is something wrong with the recipe or if maybe I got an off-batch of tapioca flour.  I used Bob's Red Mill.

Although it wasn't what I was expecting (Chebe boxed mix) it turned out to be really super yummy. You could probably still make small sandwiches with these but as they are noted they really are more like a snack. The boxed mix makes 4 little sandwich buns. I was trying to find a homemade recipe so I don't have to rely on the box I might keep using this one.

Personally, I thought there could have been more flavor, so next time I will add more cheese. Additionally, there should be less oil.

It was great!! we fell in love with these at Texas De Brazil and I finally found a good recipe. I followed it to a tee, but I must've done something wrong because they just didnt turn into little balls like that, they baked more flat. BUT they were a huge hit.

came out really soft and delicious. Made a double batch, left out the garlic. My mistake for not letting the dough sit long enough, so they came out flat. But still delicious. Thanks for sharing.

I love Brazilian cheese bread and make it quite often. I keep it very simple by combining all the ingredients in a blender and pour it directly into a mini muffin pan and bake as directed. The results are just as good!

Made a couple of times already and made some adjustments to my flavor. 
Also after baked, changed to toast (grill) the top with some grated cheese. So yummy!

Oh my god, this is my new favorite recipe for a quick snack.  This recipe is amazing, but me being of Caribbean descent, I added a little something to it.  Growing up in a Puerto Rican household, we would have guava and cheese pastries often, so I figured why not add it to this recipe.  The original recipe is fantastic, but if you want to make it sweet and savory, add a small square of guava. Absolutely love this recipe. Thank you

I tried something similar at a "Brazilian" steakhouse and was pleasantly surprised to see it is an actual Brazilian dish. 
I had to improvise because my husband brought home the wrong kind of shredded cheese but it still turned out great. 
Chewy and yummy.

Very  runny. I had to add a lot more flour. It also needs more cheese. Maybe use powdered milk instead of liquid? Cut back on water?

so the taste is really good but it's coming out cookie-shaped! :( I ran out of fresh parmesan so I used grated. Does anyone know if that's what is getting me in trouble or what is happening? It's very sticky when I roll. But again, it's the right taste of it, so I am doing something wrong!!

Mine turned out as flat pancakes. They did not rise like rolls. I followed the directions substituting butter for olive oil like another eater. What did I do wrong?

I followed the directions. Very easy to make. They hardly took any time. Next time I would add different herbs. They are a chewy bun not soft. But I am glad I found this recipe.

The taste was pretty much exactly like the Brazilian Steakhouse I was trying to mimic. The shape however was very flat, possibly due to the dough being to runny, so they didn't look as good as they tasted. I may try with just one egg next time to see if that makes a difference. Otherwise they were great!

Really delicious recipe! After reading through some reviews I decided to switch the amount of oil and water needed, using instead 1/2 cup of water and 1/3 of oil. I also used shredded parm, but I decided to break down the parm even more by putting it in a blender and grinding it. That being said, I added more parm, around 1/3 cup more. After bringing the mixture to a boil and adding the tapioca flour, I kneaded it with my hands (the recipe didn't specify kneading but I believed it was implied by the word "mix"). After letting it sit, I also kneaded in the eggs and parm. I was very pleased by this recipe and will definitely make it again!

I used all butter and a 3-cheese parm/romano/asiago blend. I also left out the  garlic, but I imagine it would be excellent with it.  I was first introduced to these at a Brazillian BBQ restaurant and was instantly hooked! Thanks to the author for posting this recipe.

While it was delicious, my partner and I found it to be too greasy and cheesey, which I understand is a bit of an unreasonable objection for a cheese bread recipe. I will definitely be making this again, but I will be dialing back the proportions of butter and cheese so we get a nice crust to go with the gooey, delicious centre.  If it is your first go, you should probably just make it as stated (+/- garlic) and see where it takes you.

Did something wrong.   I measured precisely but when I started stirring in the tapioca flour it congealed into rubber  before half the flour was added.  No way I could blend the other cup.   It wAs like a hot rubber ball.   I will try again with cooler liquids.

The first  time I made it I followed the directions exactly and it didn't turn out quite like I had hoped. The second time I didn't really change much, but made them smaller than the recipe recommends and that made all the difference! 

But beware, it's a heck of time trying to pry them off the pan!

I doubled the cheese- 2/3c of parm and 2/3c of mozz. To avoid the "pancake" problem another review mentioned, I poured the dough into mini-muffin tins, as I saw in another recipe. Next time I try this, i'm putting in a little baking soda in the hopes that the puffs will puff a bit more.

Overall a good base recipe that I use all the time. I would recommend not using olive oil as it can overpower your cheese bread. Use another type of oil such as grapeseed or vegetable oil that doesn't add its own flavor.  I also agree with the reviewer on reducing the amount of oil. 

I routinely use sharp cheddar instead of parm which I like better. Try it out.

Putting the mixture in the fridge for a bit makes it easier to roll into balls that hold its shape.

I'm from Minas, and living in Germany I desperately miss pão de queijo! The recipe is the best one I've tried so far. I used the cheap grana padano (already grated) and added some mozzarella. I used only one egg, I didn't want mine to be very heavy, and used salted butter.

This recipe is the closest I've gotten to the delicious buns at our local Brazillian restaurant AND they are awesome because they have a wonderful chewy texture that I think is a great change from the more common crumbly gluten free breads. I did make a few changes but only to the method after reading the review regarding the blender. First off, I followed the ingredients and respective quantities exactly using the olive oil. I took the wet ingredients and, without heating, mixed in my food processor until the oil had emulsified. I then added the whole amount of tapioca flour in one go and processed until the mixture was completely mixed and crumbly. I then let it rest for 15 mins. I then added half of the cheese (I opted for sharp cheddar in my second batch with a bit of black pepper) and one of the eggs (brought to room temp) and processed until completely combined. And then again with the remaining cheese and egg. I let it process on high for 15 seconds or so to mix in some air. The batter looked more like thick pudding and I put heaping 1/8th of a cup measurements into my mini cupcake tin (lightly greased, but you wouldn't need anything with a non-stick version) and baked at convection 350 for 13 - 16 minutes until the tops were golden brown. One thing to note, I live at a relatively high elevation so the cooking time could be off for anyone at sea level. These buns turned out perfect, slightly crunchy on the outside with the warm chewy centers - with hints of cheese and

This recipe is not at all like classic Pão de queijo. Too oily, not cheesy enough. I could not even finish eating a single roll. You should use more milk, half the oil, and slightly more cheese (may even consider a variety of cheeses).

And looked like exactly as on the pocture. Thanks so much! I found a perfect recipe.

As someone who can't have gluten,  Brazilian cheese bread was the first time I felt like a gluten-free bread had a good texture and a delicious taste.    I used to make these with a mix I found, but then I realized that making them from scratch was really not much different. I still had to basically add same ingredients to the mix.I like this recipe, but I did change a couple of things. I left out the garlic, even though I love garlic. I wanted a bread that I could use for savory or sweet. A little dollop of jam on these is lovely, with a little butter.   The other thing I did was to mix in a little bit more tapioca flour so that the dough was less sticky and I was able to roll it into ropes about an inch thick, and from their cut inch-wide balls. It is way easier  and less messy that way.  I encourage you to be creative with the cheeses, and also with added flavorings like garlic and spices.   Today I felt like plain cheese bread, tomorrow I might want to add some chopped green chile ??.

These are delicious! One thing to note is that the batter is VERY gluey before you add the eggs and cheese. So much so that I was convinced that it wouldn't work. I baked these a bit longer than the baking time - about 10 extra minutes. I also did some on a baking sheet and some in a muffin tin - the muffin tin ones were golden and crispy. (I also made some without cheese for the non-dairy crowd, which were just as good!) My husband asked 'can you make these everyday?!'

I just made this and it is yummy. Taste just like the ones I've had previously. I love the crisp outside and the chewy inside. I recommend making it with the butter, gives it a richer flavor. I also mixed a little grated romano cheese with parmesan. I am going to experiment with different cheeses for fun flavors.

Yumm!!! These are sooooo good Ive had these at Brazilian steakhouses which are few & far in between in America and absolutely love these rolls that they serve. I was craving them so decided to make them. Really simple only thing I changed was I used pre grated parmesan (the powdery kind) because that's all I had and omitted garlic so they tasted like the ones at the restaurant & they came out delicious! I chose to use butter bc it has more flavor and if you're going to indulge might as well go all in right? The one thing I might suggest is to make them a bit smaller (1 1/2"diameter) because that's how I've had them before and I personally like them a bit smaller.

Needs changes. I made this recipe twice. First as is, minus garlic, and it turned out heavy and way too gooey. Next I used 1 cup of milk, no water. 1/2 cup oil. No garlic. 1 cup of parmesan cheese. Heat oven to 450F, but turn it down to 350F as soon as you put in the puffs.  Bake 30 min. THEY ARE PERFECT!

I used 1/3 c egg whites instead of 2 eggs, no garlic, used butter instead of oil and added 1/4 c of shredded mozzarella cheese along with the Parmesan...absolutely delicious!!  I will bake them on parchment paper next time as they stuck a bit to the cookie sheets.

Made these today after a round of golf when one of the guys discussed how frustrated he was as a single guy to find decent gluten free food.  He commented"I'm single and like pizza,hoagies,etc".  I made it my missions to try researching some gluten free breads when I came upon this recipe.  They came out great.  He works at our golf course and I can't wait to bring them to him tomorrow to suggest using them as sliders for meatballs.  I even made the last batch as a mini pizza.  I will make these for sliders for my family even though we don't have an issue with gluten.

I've made this recipe several times, delicious every time! A couple things I'd like to point out, from my personal experience: 1) I prefer the taste of the recipe made with melted butter (salted) to olive oil. 2) My bread comes out kind of knobbly unless I spend time hand-rolling each one into a smooth ball. Hand-rolling is what makes them look all smooth like the photo. 3) After making it the first time, I've left out the garlic ever since. The bread tastes lovely with just the parmesan.

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe, but something wasn't right.  I love garlic, so left it in, but it's not traditionally found in Brazilian cheese bread.  I think the ratio of liquids to flour must be off.  These came out much flatter and denser than what I expected.  I'll be experimenting some more on my own.  Thank you for a great starting point.

My kids love to go to Fogo de Chao just as much for these cheese balls as for the Brazilian BBQ.  I have made these twice and had to increase the amount of flour a bit  (additional 1/4-1/3C) and double the cheese (to 1.5C).  I also substituted butter for oil.

Fantastic recipe . I used butter instead of olive oil. 1.5 cup of Grana Padana cheese ( similar to Parmesan cheese  ) . Rest just fallow the recipe and came out perfect . Some reviews said batted was watery not at all . When I rolled the balls I put Olive oil in my hand so balls were smooth .

I am in love with this recipe! I am Brazilian and it tastes really original! Crunchy and delicious! Thanks for sharing with us! The next time I will put less oil, maybe the half! It's the only think I will change.

Great tastw and texture, but be sure to adjust the salt depending on the kind of cheese... used queso fresco and they turned out *much* too salty.

Fantastic recipe! This was my first time using tapioca flour but I'm no noob to these breads or bread making. I made some slight personal preference type changes: omitted garlic, cut back on salt because I used salted butter, added maybe 1/4 cup more parmesan cheese, and reduced the oven  temp to 350 after the first batch cooked a little too fast (my oven tends to run a little hot). I very thoroughly mixed the batter for several minutes with a hand mixer and dough hooks. The batter was sticky and thick and held its shape so I'm not sure why so many people ended up with runny batter. The batter also did not turn out looking like cottage cheese for me; it was very smooth. I dolloped spoonfuls on a greased cookie sheet about an inch apart. They turned into beautiful little spheres and had that fantastic rubbery/chewy texture. The flavor was also fantastic. My family DEVOURED these before they had a chance to cool! This will now be my go to recipe for these breads!

I make this with 1 c shredded Mex cheese or with 1 cup of ricotta cheese.
Add 1T of baking soda for some lift to the dough.

 I have also tried this with substituting 1/3 of the tapioca with sorghum flour and baking soda. Tastes great!  This recipe is ideal for the freezer as it stales quickly. Put into toaster for quick use. I always make more for the freezer.

These were a hit. I made just as the recipe stated and used the butter instead of oil based on other reviews. Next time I will try different cheeses and maybe add meat like pepperoni. Everyone liked these. they are great right out of the oven, crisp on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.

We have tried a few other recipes and LOVE this one! I would suggest using a little less oil (maybe by 1/4).   We use the dough for a pizza crust too! It makes a great crackery crust. Par bake until set, top and cook until brown and cheese is bubbly.

Very yummy. Added alot more cheese (nearly double haha!) 
I just realised I used tapioca starch instead of flour..not sure if that made my bread too gooey.  But it still turned out yummy!

I made some alterations according to my friends mums recipe in Brazil.  I added one  full clove of minced garlic (not sure about teaspoons of garlic) used only 1/3 cup of olive oil, and instead of 2/3 cup Parmesan she suggested 1/3 cup mozzarella and 1/3 Parmesan.  Turned out just like I remembered eating when I was 19 and stayed in Brazil for a month!

Perfections thank you.  It is easier to mix the cheese and egg together prior to mixing with the tapioca mix.  My Brazilian husband liked these better than from home.

I loved it!  My mom is Brazilian and I've always loved eating Pao de Queijo in Brazil, and this was the first time I've tried to make it.  Maybe a tad too much garlic for me, but the texture was great.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't turn out well. I know it's supposed to be "gummy" in the middle, etc, but that's all it was. I expected it to be a little more risen and puffy than so dense. Next time will  let it rest longer. Also, it doesn't have near enough cheese. It had no cheese flavor with just the 2/3 cup, next time I will add almost a cup. Last problem was the mixture was too thin, so when I rolled into balls and put on baking tray, they just spread out into pools.

The bread turn out so good. My boyfriend said it taste like from the restaurant. The only thing I changed was adding a tablespoon of sugar and it still turn out a little salty. So I cannot imagine how it would turn out if I did not add any sugar. Over all  good recipe. I would definitely make it again pretty soon.

I previously tried different recipe with 3 ingredients and dough was runny as some of you describing, but still baked well. This recipe made nice dough, great taste. I kind of dont understand how people got it watery, if you put tapioca powder into hot liquid mixture, it thickens right away and 2 eggs can't make it runny. I used twice as much cheese (monterey jack) and turned out fantastic!

Didn't make this with garlic. Tried it with a mini muffin pan and on just a baking sheet. Either way they puffed up just fine but held a more uniform shape with the muffin pan. Delicious recipe.

I lived in Brazil for several years and thought I would never again enjoy the real taste of pao de queijo. I assumed it was some super complicated grandma's secret with ingredients we don't have in the US. I was wrong. It took me four grocery stores, but I found the tapioca flour, and these turned out delicious.

Just finished making this for my girl scouts to taste tonight. We are learning about Brazil for our national thinking day. They are VERY greasy! Rubbery on the inside. I did see a review that said they are supposed to be crisy on the outside and rubbery on the inside so I guess I will leave the recipe when I make them for thinking day but maybe LESS OIL -- I made them in a mini muffin tin and they are perfect two bite sized! 
Thanks!

I'm an American who lived in Brazil for almost 2 years. Unfortunately I never learned how to make Pao de queijo, or any other salgadinhos. This recipe is fantastic! They are perfect. I'm so excited to have found the real thing. It took me a long time to figure out that Farinha de Mandioca is Tapioca flour. I found some at Winco in their bulk dept. YEY!
My first batch I just dropped them on the pan, the second batch I rolled them into balls, and I think I like that better. I would like them to be a tiny bit more airy, so I might try a little leavening, but that will probably ruin them. I might also try with grated cheddar. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these as a Passover treat, and they are quite delicious!  I used olive oil and parmesan. The only change was to use about 1/4 tsp garlic powder in place of the minced garlic, and to make the balls smaller (about ping-pong ball size). This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe makes GREAT pao de queijo! The only thing is it ends up a bit greasy- maybe because of the amount of oil.

Not a bad recipe, but nothing can replace the cheese which is used in Brazil.  "Queijo Minas" is a white, salty cheese.  The secret "Pao de Queijo" is the cheese.

Easier than I expected from having tried other recipes.  I am from Brazil and this tastes like the real thing - I will reduce the oil tough.
