This was one of the BEST salads I have ever made!  I made it for a dinner party and every single person had two servings.  Absolutely will make again!
My modifications:
~Used half field greens and half baby spinach
~Threw in a handful of walnuts because I had them around
~Roasted the beets drizzled in a garlic-infused olive oil.  I used kosher salt and black pepper to season both beets and avocado-made a huge difference-don't forget this step!
~Used the same garlic-infused olive oil to drizzle on the avocados and also make the salad dressing.
~Threw in two cloves of garlic (pressed from my garlic presser) right  into my salad dressing
~Used sliced almonds with dried cranberries instead of pistachios and dried cherries
~Skipped all cheese to save on calories-and is a great vegan friendly choice

I have made with both avocado and goat cheese. I love 
avocado but goat cheese is really good in this.

I made this and it actually made 3 large salads.  However,  I added roasted chicken to the top.  I should have added more grated Parmesan.  Overall, excellent taste!

Great recipe! I adjusted to what I had in my kitchen so the final product had beets, spinach, pistachios, dried cranberries, and goat cheese. Very close to the original so I don't feel like it should lose stars (I would have done the original if I didn't have such close ingredients at home).

This is a wonderful salad. You can vary the nuts and cheese and it's still delicious. I don't bring home leftovers of this one!

Loved this salad!! We followed all directions in recipe. Added the garlic infused oil to the beets and avacado and used an herbed salt. Best with fresh parm/reggiano grated cheese! Will definitely make this salad again! Paired well with Mean Woman's Pasta Sauce-check it out on this site!
