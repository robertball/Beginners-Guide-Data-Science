Made this for some chicken legs to go in the smoker and it turned out great! This would go great on any grilled or smoked meat. I'll be making a big batch to keep on hand. Thanks for sharing!

This is now my go to seasoning, use it on meats, vegetables and just about anything that I cook. Will definitely keep some on hand at all times.

A food processor can be good for blending spices.
