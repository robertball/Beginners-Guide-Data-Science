I followed the recipe but cooked the brisket on LOW for 8 hours and when I came home the sauce was like charcoal and the meat was completely black.  I was looking forward to the brisket all day because of these wonderful reviews...I even used a 2 1/2 lb. cut.  What did I do wrong?  Were you supposed to add water?

WOW!!!  This is UNBELIEVABLE!!!  This was by far the BEST brisket I have ever tasted!!!  I did a few things differently.  Instead of cooking on high for 4 hours, I did low for 8 hours.  And instead of using onion powder, I finely chopped half of a white onion and threw it in the sauce to cook with the meat.  I also put the entire amount of sauce in the crock pot with the brisket and made a half recipe of sauce and used it when I served the meat.  It was such a hit!  I highly recommened this!  It MELTS in your mouth!  And the sauce is to DIE FOR!  YUM!!!!

This was very good but was a little dry.  I may cook on low for about 8 hours next time.  My crock pot tends to cook too hot on high.  I especially loved the sauce though.  I used celery salt instead of celery seed, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Definately worth a try to make this!

This recipe was my first attempt at brisket-it's wonderful!! My husband went crazy over the sauce, we like spice so I used a "hot" chili sauce. Next time I will try the "busy day barbeque brisket" rub, which has more spice in it, along with the sauce from this recipe. I just don't like the idea of dumping in store bought barbeque sauce, part of the fun is experimenting with the sauce. 8/20/09 update: used busy day barbeque brisket rub, with sauce from this receipt, and it was spicy excellent.

I recommend not serving this to anyone who really likes barbecue- the sauce is way too much like ketchup.

Otherwise- the cut of meat certainly deserves more than this recipe.

Needs a little kick or spice!!

SO GOOD!!!  I do not even like red meat, but I LOVE this brisket.  It came out so tender it cuts with a fork, and the sauce is so delicious!  I will note that I used fresh brisket from the market.  I made this for family when I was out of town and bought grocery store brisket (pre-trimmed and packaged) in the meat case and it turned out okay, flavor was good but meat was tough.  So make sure your beef is fresh and you will not be disappointed!

It was great my husband even loved it.  And that is unusual.  I cooked it on low for 8 hrs.  The only thing I might do different next time is remove the meat about 2 hrs before done and slice it then.  It was really tender to much to slice correctly.  But over all it was great.

Very Good!! My brisket was a little less than 2 and a half pounds, and i used 3/4 of the sauce to put on top.  I didn't want it to dry out, and the homemade sauce is so delicious!  So I would maybe do 1.5 times the sauce recipe next time.  Definitely has some heat to it, which we enjoyed (used a hot garlic chili sauce).  I sliced mine as thinly as I could and we put it on kaiser rolls topped with sauce and some aged cheddar cheese.  Served with cornbread.  Delish!  And easy prep... I love a good and easy crockpot recipe!  Oh and I cooked mine on low, and only cooked for about 6 hours, all I had time for.  It was definitely cooked, I just wonder if the extra time would have made it more tender....or if it would have burnt.  Its hard to say.

This is really good!  After reading the reviews that it comes out a bit dry, I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then low for 1-1.5 hours and it turned out perfect!  Worth it!

This came out SO good, and my wife is not a big barbeque fan. You DO have to watcgh it tho, can't just plop in the crock pot and walk away for 8hrs. At least the two Rival Crock Pots I used, both get WAY too hot even on "low", and its done and ready to serve in about 4hrs. The home made sauce is a really nice touch too, not overpowering like the bottled stuff at the market.

This was very good and very easy.  I put a good coat of a homemade BBQ rub on the meat the night before and let it sit in the fridge till the next day. Before I put it in the crock pot, I charred both sides on my gas grill with high heat to brown the meat, give it a 'frilled flavor. The I put it in the crock pot, cut up and onion and smoe fresh garlic and cooked it on low for 8 hours. After cooking and slicing ( it really falls apart nicely ) I  gave it a good coating of the sauce that I heated up.  Family all loved it, I'll make it again. Pretty easy.

I don't know why on earth anyone would make brisket any other way.  My picky son (who is a true carnivore at heart) was hesitant at first because of the powerful flavor.  It is one of his favorites now and he looks forward to Brisket Day like Christmas.  lol

The spices and flavor of this dish was great- however the cooking time was ALL WRONG. I cooked this in my slow cooker for 5 hours on LOW and it was way too dry. Almost inedible.
If I make it again, I'll cook it for maybe two hours on low.

Absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I changed was subsituting chili sauce with barbeque sauce because I didn't have chili sauce.  Very moist and the kids devoured it.

This was moist and delicious.  Even my kids who don't normally like sauce on things ate this up and asked for more.  I cooked for 8 hours on low.

I made this for 20+ people (8 lbs of brisket) and had RAVE reviews!!  Pan seared all the meat first and then cooked on low for 8 hours - perfect.  I reduced the sugar by half & added cumin to make it more southwest.  I reduced the sauce & served it shredded with lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, flour tortillas, etc.  Made a great entree for a large crowd.

This was an awesome way to make brisket easy for a a weeknight meal.  Mine was not dry, it was perfect.  It is important to leave a small amount of fat on the meat and cook it with the fat side up so that it will stay tender.  Thank you for this recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty easy to make and I think it turned out perfect, we both loved it!   Only think we changed was cooking it on low for 8hrs instead of cooking it on high for 4-5.

I really would give this 4 1/2 stars!  It was excellent!  I used less liquid smoke, but kept everything the same.  Cooked on low 8 hours.  My girls and husband loved it and asked me to make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out PERFECT!!!  I cooked mine on low for about 7 hours and then turned it up to high for about 45 minutes at the end.  It was seriously perfect, my husband could not stop talking about how much he loved it!

This came out so tender. I was intimidated by brisket because I had been told that they can be tricky to cook. I just cooked it low and slow all day and it came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was very tasty but i think that 4 hours on high was too much... the meat was very tough but the sauce was awesome. Next time I will try what the others did 8 hours on low.

I rubbed the spices over the brisket then placed it in the crockpot & covered it with Bullseye BBQ sauce. I did not make the sauce that was included in the recipe b/c every chili sauce I looked at in the grocery store contained HFCS which we do not use. I cooked on low for 8 hours. The meat was very tender & moist but it was bland. Next time I will try a different spice rub. I served with 'Cream corn like no other' from this site. Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out wonderful! To the reviewer below me: You can't make up your own guidelines for timing and expect it to turn out great. You shouldn't have given this less then five stars for your mistake. I followed the instructions and it turned out perfectly! Will definitely make again!

I used this recipe because we had a brisket we needed to use.  Didn't have liquid smoke, so took a chance without it.  My husband raises  cows  and all of us are spoiled by good home-grown beef.  This recipe rocked!!!  Everyone absolutely loved it.

I did in a slow cooker on low for 8 hrs and the beef brisket was not at all tender.  it was like eating leather.  the sauce though was very tasty.  the beef brisket i bought was on special. maybe it was a bad cut???

We used the spice rub from this recipe and cooked the brisket a little differently, so I can't speak for the entire recipe.  The rub was delicious though and really added flavor to our brisket.

I changed the method - not the rub or the sauce. To prepare the meat I rubbed the brisket with Deli mustard before rubbing with spices -then let it sit overnight in the fridge before tossing it in the smoker for 2 hours -finished in the slow cooker with the sauce. Outstanding flavor

This is a fantastic recipe!  We put it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours on low, it melts any fat but makes it moist/flavorful!  I didn't have chili sauce, so I just use ketcup and it was awesome!  We make this all the time : )

Based on other reviews, I added 1 cup of diet ginger ale so that the meat would not dry out.  Also, my brisket was 3 1/2 lbs. so I cooked it on a low setting for 10 1/2 hours.  What a delicious result.  Just the right amount of seasoning and moist and juicy pull apart meat.  YUM!  I will definitely make this again.

This was the best BBQ brisket ever. I made it just as the recipe states.  For those whose briskets did not turn out, you must NOT trim the fat off the brisket--that is what keeps it moist and from drying out. You can easily skim off the fat after it cooks off and before you add the sauce. I always use a bigger brisket, 4+ pounds since it shrinks up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this on recommendation of another Recipe Exchange member.  It is very easy, flavorful & great for hoagies.  I make extra sauce & heat it to make it smooth for use on the side or as a dip for chicken nuggets.

Delicious.  I used the rub from "Busy Day BBQ Brisket" instead to add more spice to mine too.  I agree with others that the time may be off.  My brisket was still a little tough at 5 hours into it.  Ended up needing to cook another 1 1/2 to 2 hours to be fork tender and I would recommend doubling the sauce.

Great recipe.  Recommend cooking for 1.5-2 hours on high then reducing the heat to low until tender.  (Cooking it on high the whole time makes it tough).  Also, I doubled the sauce recipe to have some to serve with it, just warm it up in the microwave.  Delicious!

Used 2 briskets, about 4 lbs.
Used 4 tomatoes instead of ketchup.
Used a pressure cooker of 80 minutes.
Meet needs to be completely submerged.
After 80 minutes, took out the meat, 
condensed the sauce with flour for 5 minutes more, and that was it.
Came out pretty good, my wife and son 
liked it a lot.

This made me wonder why people spend so much time smoking and/or grilling briskets! The only change I made was using 2 fresh garlic cloves, pressed and rubbed over the meat, instead of garlic powder which I was out of. We had this with Golden Sweet Cornbread (also from this site) and tossed salad.

This recipe is excellant.  The sauce is very tasty.  I cooked my 2-1/2 lb brisket for 10 hours; 1 hour on high and the remainder on low.  I think the amount of time it takes all depends on the individual cooker.  I also put all of the sauce in to cook and made a half recipe to serve with the cooked brisket.

I love this recipe! The sauce is amazing and the beef is so tender. The only change I made was to cook on low for 8 hours, and I added all of the sauce to the crock pot. The sauce comes out thin after cooking (I like it like that) If you don't, keep some aside. This is my favorite slow cooker meal, and I have made it a weekly dinner! Thanks!

My husband, who prefers to sacrifice large pieces of meat on the grill, said this is the only way he wants brisket from now on. He thought it was a bit sweet ,but he probably won't change it.  We did have to multiply the recipe.  We live in Texas and I don't think I have ever seen a 2 1/2 lb. brisket.  Ours was 12lbs.  (Yes, we had leftovers.)

This is a terrific recipe.  I cooked the brisket in an oven bag at 325 degrees for 31/2 hours.  It was super tender and there was a ton of juice.  I may cut back on the liquid smoke flavoring next time(just a personal preference). Tasted great on sandwiches the next day. Great job!

This is an excellent, easy, very tasty recipe!  I made the sauce the night before and came home at lunch to put it in the cooker.  It was done, perfectly, in time for dinner.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thank you!

So tender.  The meat literally shredded on it's own when we sliced it.  Even my 3 year old niece loved this one as did the older kids.  This recipe is a winner.

This was pretty good.  The meat was very tender.  The BBQ sauce was alright, but I've had better bottled sauces.  I probably won't make this again, but it was an okay dinner that was easy to make.

This recipe is absolutely excellent. Used barbecue sauce in place of chili sauce and a tablespoon of hot pepper sauce and the result was better than the best barbecue restaurant!

I need to 5 star this one, as it's my go-to recipe for crockpot/slow cooker brisket.  I follow the recipe to the letter, except that I cook it on low for 8-9 hours and it's perfect every time.  The sauce is unbelievable.  The leftovers make for wonderful sandwiches with some sauce and some jalapenos.  Everyone I've cooked it for has loved it, and I'm going to double this recipe next weekend to bring camping and fool everyone that I'm an amazing cook.

This was delicious and so easy to make, although I did have a bit of a run around town trying to find a brisket that was small enough for this recipe. It was totally worth it! Pulled the brisket when it was finished cooking for yummy yummy beef brisket sandwiches!

I agree that the sauce is a little too much like ketchup and needs a little kick.  But the meat itself had a good flavor.

cooked this overnite for about 8 hrs to have for lunch- the meat fell apart, so couldn't really slice it. Used for a sandwhich. Was a little dry. Used the "Busy day brisket rub" and the sauce recipe which was good.  Will maybe try again and not have it on for as long. had a 3# brisket.

Excellent every time!  This is one of those recipes I make every so often, and it never fails to please.  I cook in crockpot on low for 8 hours.

I just made the barbeque sauce from this recipe, but it was very easy and flavorful. I think it could use a little more liquid smoke but all in all, it was great! I made this sauce to go with the rub from Busy Day Barbeque Brisket which is also wonderful! Try these two together, you won't be disappointed.

This was pretty good.  Cooked it on high for 4.5 hours and it was wonderfully tender.  The sauce is excellent.  My 6 year old made this recipe all by herself (with a little help on which measuring cup is which) so it is incredibly easy!

I love the flavor.  I usually cook a smaller piece of meat, so 4-5 hours on low worked better for me.  Also, I make my own chili sauce by adding some tomato sauce and all spice and then just increasing the amount of vinegar and brown sugar.

Excellent! Easy! And very tasty!  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and low for about 6 hours.  It was done to perfection but if I had left it for another 6 hours it probably wouldn't have hurt it. Well, maybe not another 6 hours, but you get the picture.  As I have read before, this is a very forgiving recipe!

This was great! The brisket came out moist and tender. I used the advice from other members and cooked the brisket on low for 8  hours as opposed to on high for 5 hours. The only thing I will do differently next time is to use less chili sauce and add 1 cup of bbq sauce!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was amazing!  The sauce was so tasty and easy to make.  Mine cooked fine on high but you might want to try it on low first depending on your crock pot.  My whole family enjoyed this...so much so that I've been asked to make it again tonight.
