A great curry! I followed the recipe to the letter, most of my meals are curry, this one was spot on.

I'm Sri Lankan, this curry is as authentic as they come. If you don't have canned tomato you can sustitute chopped fresh tomato instead.

Fabulous recipe!! Excellent. I only alter it by reducing the cayenne a bit. This is defiantly a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing it.

Perfection.  I am a 20 year plus cook of Indian and Sri Lankan
food and this recipe is superb.  Since I used a very inexpensive
beef cut, I did marinate the 3lbs of beef with 1/2 cup of
dry red wine, a couple cloves of garlic diced and salt and pepper.
I covered and placed in refrigerator for approx 3 hours.  You may
not ned to do this but Wow what a curry.  I bought my curry powder roasted from my neighborhood Indian supply shop and served with a high quality basmati rice.  I live in Australia and we are blessed with fantastic spice shops, not sure how you would go in a small U.S mid-western town for supplies.
Try this recipe if you can, you will be delighted.

This curry was amazing!  I let it cook a little longer to soften the beef a little more.  The flavours as written are so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

update 6/16:  I've made this recipe several times and always with great results.  Highly recommended and well received by many guests of varying familiarity/comfort with curry.  I continue to omit pandan leaves, use ground spices in lieu of whole (1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp clove) so I don't have to fish out anything after cooking, and use 3 tbsp of ginger garlic paste (equal parts garlic and ginger pureed together, which I always have in my fridge). I still omit the coconut milk most of the time, but I use coconut oil for sauteing to lend some of that flavor.  I also still finish with about 1/3 cup chopped cilantro just because every curry I ate growing up was finished this way so I miss something if I don't have my cilantro. So glad I found this recipe!
-----------------------
original reveiw: I feel a little funny reviewing when I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I hate it when people leave glowing reviews but didn't actually make the recipe.  That said, I was just making due with what I had on hand; thought I'd share so others won't be afraid to try.  I didn't have pandan and I forgot the vinegar and I used ground cinnamon and cloves and used my own family's garam masala mix and finished with chopped cilantro. Also omitted the coconut milk just to reduce the calories.  I made this in my pressure cooker, which worked out well for a weeknight meal, and served with brown rice.  I'm Indian, but beef curry is new territory since my extended family is Hin

This is a great easy recipe. The only thing I couldn't find was the pandan leaf but it was great without it.

This was so delicious!  Looks complicated, but really comes together easily.  I could not find curry leaves, so I subbed a bit of fresh basil and a squeeze of lime.  I found the pandan leaf in an asian grocery, just took several leaves and tied with kitchen string during the cooking, then removed before serving.  I did americanize this for a one-pot meal, I added red pepper strips, carrot, and peas.  Only used the coconut milk to blush, about 1/3 cup, the sauce was so flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe, a do-over for sure!

I turned this into a slow cooker recipe and it was fabulous! I mixed everything but the coconut milk together in the slow cooker. It was cooked on low for 4-5 hours. I added the coconut milk about 15 minutes before serving. I could not find pandan or curry, but it was fantastic without it.

Simply Excellent.  I followed recipe, omitting only the leaf and the flavor was superb.  Next time I will also make Raita (to cool the mouth) and Naan Bread.  But this was not a too hot spicy dish for us to eat with just rice.

Great recipe but do yourself a favor and reduce the cayenne pepper and you can ignore the call for black pepper. Any  cook who puts one tablespoon of cayenne and one tablespoon of black pepper in the same dish which only calls for three pounds of beef is quite mad. I also add brown sugar to the recipe to give it a wee bit of sweetness. Ignoring the pepper its an awesome recipe.

Tasty and a good change to normal food line, adding coconut milk to beef curry is not very Sri Lankan though......

Made this for dinner tonight and it was sensational! I only had a small steak in the freezer and wanted to stretch it out- so I cut it into small pieces and just halved the recipe. Served it over brown rice and homemade naan bread. This will be a regular recipe in our house for sure - husband raved. I also added a kaffir leaf to the recipe (didn't have pandan or curry leaves) and had no tomato paste so subbed heinz ketchup as previously suggested in another review. I garnished with fresh cilantro. Thank you for this recipe!

This "Sri Lanka Beef Curry" was as delicious as similar dishes I have had in restaurants. I used my pressure cooker to shorten the cooking time. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Rob for sharing your recipe. Note: You can find pandan leaves in the refrigerator section of an Asian grocery store. Curry leaves are with the spices, and taste like tea leaves with all the flavor seeped out of them. The Indian grocer tells me that they are mostly for aroma. I think it is safe to leave the curry leaves out of this recipe without spoiling the overall presentation. These are not the same "curry leaves" as used in Thai curries (kaffir lime leaves).

Where in the world do I find all these leaves? I made it without them and it was pretty good!
