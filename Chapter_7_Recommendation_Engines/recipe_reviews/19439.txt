My hubby is in love with this recipe. I only change one thing. Instead of using graham crackers and butter, I just use a regular graham cracker pie crust. I still put it in the oven to get it a little crispy. So, instead of the square desert, it looks like a pie! Great!

Easy, quick and delicious.  What more could you ask for.  There is a discrepancy in the recipe.  It calls for 3 C. of milk but then it says to prepare the pudding as instructed in the package which calls for 2Cups each.  Other than that it was a big hit in my home.  I ground chocolate chips and sprinkled them on top of the whipped cream instead of using the unsweetened chocolate.  It added a nice texture.

My whole family LOVED this recipe. We agreed that it was the peacans and toasted crust that made it exceptional so don't leave out the peacans or substitute walnuts to save money. That would be a tragedy. I skipped the melted chocolate step and just sprinkled chocolate pieces on top.

I substituted all the ingredients to be low calorie/low fat and have made it about 5 times in the last 4 weeks! It gets devoured by friends and family alike!

This was great!  So easy to make and my family loved it.  I used chocolate syrup that you put on ice cream, on top of the whipped cream on top and then some mini chocolate chips. Delish!

I was looking for a way to mimic the dessert served in a local restaurant ("chocolate delite"). This is it! So creamy, decadent and easy! Keep your eye on the crust or you'll get too much crunch in your finished dessert. Doubling was easy- this translates well to a 9 X 13 inch glass serving dish for square servings. Do NOT expect to have leftovers! Great recipe!

I made this for a dinner party and EVERYONE came back for seconds! I doubled the recipe, although in hindsight I wouldn't double the pudding again. One box of each would have been enough. Deelish!

This was awesome! Quick and easy.  I didn't have pecans, so I used sliced almonds.  I did have any melted chocolate so I dusted the top with cocoa powder.  Must put into freezer to firm up prior to serving... many many rave reviews.

My splurge for the night! So delicious!  Used skim milk and low fat cream cheese and cool whip. Crushed my own grahams. Loved the crust w/ the pecans! Still rich and satisfying.  Thanks!

Made this yesterday and even while assembling it, I knew it was going to be amazing !!  The pecans in the crust added a light crunch and I followed the recipe exactly.  This is a restaurant worthy dessert, the presentation is incredible and the blend of creaminess/crunchy was just to die for !!
EXCELLENT RECIPE !!!

This was very good!  I used only chocolate, cook and serve pudding (2 boxes) because I had it on hand.  It worked just as well.  I cooked it and added it when it was set.  I also substituted walnuts for the pecans because it was what I had on hand.  The recipe was still delicious, and it was easy to make!

Just be careful when baking the crust- mine didnt take as long as recipe suggested to bake, it started to get a little burnt. Will be making it again.

This is all my son asks for on his birthday.  I am allergic to nuts, but the crust is fine without them, especially if you add a hint of Heath bar crunch pieces to it.  I also put them on the top and whoa doggy!!!  Simple and delicious.

I have made this for years. It ia a favotite in our house. Instead of the pecans I use sliced almonds in the crust which is a hit. I also chop up a few skor bars and sprinkle them on the top instead of choclate.

This was awesome. I used pistachio pudding instead of the vanilla and loved it. I also one and a halved the cream cheese layer. So good. My crust was slightly overcooked, I would maybe leave out the nuts, but it was still very good. Ate way too much.

Very  good.  Fairly easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Think I put to much whipped topping on the top.  That was about all I could taste!

GREAT dessert!!!! One thing, I follow the recipe exactly, but my crust gets really crumbly & when I spread the cream cheese mixture over it, the crust starts to come apart.

My husband doesn't like chocolate, so I used butterscotch pudding in place of the chocolate.  Received RAVE reviews and pleas for the recipe from almost everyone that tried it at our Mexican night dinner.  Easy to make and simply delicious.

Great recipe and everyone loved it.  This is a very versatile recipe. You can choose any combination of pudding you want, you can change the topping, and you can change the crust to just graham cracker or Oreo cookies.

You can even use low fat or sugar free options. (Can't be totally sugar free since you use confectioner's sugar, but you can reduce the sugar)

I used the pecan and graham cracker crust and it was delicious.

Crust is exceptionally good. The dessert is good but quite a few steps for a pudding style dessert. I prefer the chocolate eclaire dessert with oudding for the quickness and overall ease.

I made this dessert for my parents anniversary and they can't stop eating it! I used whipped heavy cream instead and it turned out perfect, for some reason my left overs didn't melt even though I refrigerated it for more than 24 hours. At least it worked out!

Great basic recipe! I adjusted it slightly.... I dont care for whipped topping, so I made read whipped cream - 500 ml with 2 tbsp sugar. I substituted chocolate cookie crumbs for graham. Because we have nut allergies, I used 2 cups of crumbs. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust, and also to the whipped topping layer. Delish!

Delicious! !! I did have to cut the baking time down to 15 minutes because I burned the crust at 20 minutes.

there is no discrepancy in the amount of milk, you use 3 cups of milk total not 4 as indicated by the directions on the box.  Stick to the 3 cups as the recipes states , your dessert will set  much better.

Excellent recipe.  Took it to a potluck and it was gone in no time.  I used walnuts instead of pecans as that was all I had on hand.  Will definetly make again and again.
