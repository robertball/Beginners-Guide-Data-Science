I changed a few things.  I didn't use shake n bake, but instead made my own breadcrumbs and seasoned them with basil, oregano, garlic powder, and rosemary.  I also used fresh mozzarella instead of the shredded.  It turned out well.  I also made the spaghetti sauce from scratch so I think that helped as well.  Thanks for the post.

I thought this was good, but my husband said it was a "weird combination".  We prefer the chicken parmesan recipe also available on allrecipes.

This was okay, but I won't make again. This would have been better with chicken, but I don't care much for pork or shake and bake for that matter.

I have to say that the pork chops came out nice and tender and my husband said this is a make again. I served it with baked pototoes and corn. For a second it kind of tasted like veal.

Easy to make.  A nice change from chicken parm.  I served with a side of spaghetti and green beans.  Pork stayed moist.
