Wonderful muffin recipe and a great way to use up strawberries!  I used 2 cups of strawberries that I tossed with 2 Tbsp. of sugar and just let them set while I made the batter.  For the batter I used 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of white sugar that I creamed together until light and fluffy then added the eggs and 2 tsp. of vanilla.  I also used added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder along with the baking soda and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon with the nutmeg.  I made these into 6 Texas sized muffins and topped them with turbinado sugar for some extra crunch on top. I baked them at 400 for 25 minutes.  They were so moist and full of flavor - I will definitely make these again!

These are great muffins--a super way to use up strawberries. I added one large mashed banana, an extra 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar to cream w/ the butter instead of the 1/4 c of white. Moist, delicious, and not too sweet. Yum!

The flavor of this is great.  The nutmeg really makes it good. The only problem I found is that I thought the batter was really thick and I wasn't sure if the muffins would turn out.  I decided to bake it in a 9 x 13 bread pan instead.  I cooked it at 350 for 35 minues.  It turned our really well.

Good muffins.  Baking 18 minutes was plenty long for mine.  Next time I would check them sooner.

Very good as written, even better if you add about 1/4 cup chocolate chips with the chopped strawberries. Use 1/4 cup batter per muffin makes 12 muffins.

I changed it by adding 2 cups of strawberries, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  

Also, when draining the luquid from the strawberries, I found there was not very much.  So when I added it, it was rather difficult to mix...very thick.  So I added a little water to the strawberries and kept drainig them and then adding water again until I got a more 'scoopable' consistancy.

They turned out well and not too sweet.  I really liked them!  I give them 5 even with the extra effort I had to put into making them because they were good.

I made these muffins this week, and we liked them quite a bit. I added an extra 1/2 cup of strawberries (I used flavourful organic berries) as some of the other reviewers recommended, and doubled the amount of nutmeg for a little extra flavour. They turned out moist and yummy - would definitely make them again.

These were good.  Not sweet enough for me.  Very mellow strawberry flavour.  I would like them to have more strawberry flavour.  Perhaps a blob of strawberry jam in the middle would work.

Very tasty! I made them just as directed, but I used about 1 3/4 C chopped strawberries, and they're just coming into season, so they were sooooooooo juicy! I had no problems with a dry batter at all (lots of juice!), and the cupcakes were very moist. I only made 6 for now, and I put the other 6 into muffin liners in the freezer so I can make one whenever I want. Before baking, a did sprinkle some raw/turbinado sugar onto the tops of them so they would get that delicious crispy top. A great way to use up some super ripe strawberries that are on their last leg or an abundance of fresh berries, for sure!

I actually would give this 4 1/2 stars.  They were rather good.  Moist.  I followed the recipe exactly. Only thing different was that I added some cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  The strawberries tasted good with the muffins.  Would recommend this recipe ... but would suggest not using any liners as the muffin does stick a bit to the paper.

me and my 3 y/o loved these muffins. i creamed the butter with 1/4 brown sugar. and replaced the nutmeg with cinnamon. since i didnt want to wait an hour, i microwavd the strawberries and sugar for 30 seconds. then prepared the rest of the ingredients. also i didnt seperate the berries from the juice i mashed them together. i put the flour over the butter/sugar/eggs, then poured the berries and juice on top of that and mixed till it was combined. (i was trying not to dirty to many dishes) these came out perfect.

These muffins were really good. I wanted to make them but didn't want to wait an hour for the strawberries and sugar to make juice so I added a 1/4 cup of apple juice to the strawberries and sugar and just let it sit while I prepared the rest. They turned out excellent. The only thing I didn't quite like was the rather strong flavor of the nutmeg, (even though it only calls for 1/4 of a tsp.) I think next time I'll try to experiment a little more and replace this ingredient.

Wow- we loved these muffins too. I used juicy, fresh local strawberries and so had lots of juice to add. I also added about 3 Tbsp. of buttermilk to the liquid after reading reviews about batter being too stiff. They turned out perfect. I am planning on making another batch tomorrow!

I only used the half cup of sugar that I tossed with the strawberries, eliminating the extra 1/4 cup. I made no other changes. These turned out really dry, I don't know if anyone else had this problem as well. I did reduce the baking temp, as I always bake my muffins at 350 degrees for about 18-20 minutes so I can vouch that it's not the adjusted baking time that made these dry. I think these would have been perfect had the flour been cut back to maybe a cup and a half. I might play with this recipe and see if I can't get them to come out a little better with the reduced flour.

These were pretty good, and baked well following the instructions.  I would have liked them a little bit sweeter, or with a stronger berry flavor.  I will definitely make these again, maybe add an extra 1/4 cup sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I made these over the weekend after buying 2 pounds of strawberries on sale and in season.  This muffins really  had a nice strawberry flavor, were not too sweet but sweet enough.  i did use half splenda /half sugar as well as half whole wheat flour mixed with the white.  I love the way the juice of the berry makes for most of your liquid (make sure they are very fresh and ripe). I will be making these again, would probably make a nice cake too with a sweet crumble topping.

I thought these were amazing.  My very ripe organic strawberries produced a lot of juice.  I did add a single banana that needed to be used very badly.  The only change was to use cane sugar instead of white sugar.  Very moist, simple and delicious.

3 year old didn't care too much for this...but then my neighbours ( who were only too happy to get some treats) Loved them. I did as per other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp cinnammon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg as well as a  large ripe banana and I substituted 1/2 white sugar with 1/2 cup brown when mxing with the butter. Very moist.

I really enjoyed these muffins! I even halved the recipe (since it was just for my boyfriend and I) and it still came out wonderful. I had to add a tiny bit of milk to by batter, but strawberries aren't in season yet, so I didn't get much juice out of mine. I don't think I'd have to do that if they were in season and really delicious. And I didn't want to wait to make them (for the berries to release the juice) so I microwaved them for like 10 seconds, worked great, but could've also added to why I didn't have enough liquid. I sprinkled the tops with sugar before I put them in the oven for that nice crunch on the tops like I like my muffins to have. Thanks so much for a yummy way to use up strawberries! :)

These were definately easy to make.  I followed everyone's advise and added an extra 1/2 cup of strawberries and an extra 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of water to the sugar and strawberries, but I don't think that was neccassary as there was tons of liquid to use. These smelled wonderful and were not too sweet. Only four stars because I personally would have liked them sweeter or maybe with walnuts? I would make them again though. Thanks for this recipe.

Now THESE are some muffins!  YUM!!!!!  I made them for a co-worker and I know he will love them.  I could barely pull myself away!  Perfect way to use strawberries in the summertime!  Delicious.  I did use more strawberries then the recipe called for, and since I was fresh out of nutmeg, I threw some allspice in mine.  A must try!

I followed the directions exactly as stated and they turned out great.  I added just a little turbinado sugar to the tops before baking (which I do for most muffins) and it adds a little crunch.  I was surprised at how much liquid the strawberries leached out when sitting for an hour in the sugar.  Works great!

I did the 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup white sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla and added 1/2 tsp. b powder and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in addition to the nutmeg..I found the batter to be quit too thick so I added some Milk about 3/4 cup...turned out PERFECT...no dryness here. I would reccomend adding some milk,yogurt, oil or something with more liquid...I can see why other reviews indicated it was dry....unless you have frozen berries maybe... Will make again with the tips from another review and adding the milk ! thanks !

I made this recipe a few times and I found the key to getting the strawberry juice is to chop the strawberries very small (about 1/2 inch pieces) and leave them someplace dark and covered for half hour. I also added about 1/3 cup water, 8 oz mini chocolate chips and a large spoon of raspberry preserves, and baked for 13 minutes. The last time I made them it was so good it hurt ... and then I had to have another!!!

Nice muffin recipe. Very sweet, with a nice crisp crust.  Flavorful, but a bit on the 'dry' side, not as moist as I would have liked. A guideline as to how much strawberry syrup should be yielded would be helpful, as I would imagine there would be some variation each and every time. Mine yielded about 3/4 cup of syrup.

This made 12 PERFECT muffins.  I was amazed at how much liquid came off the chopped berries but very happy with the results.  These muffins are light and fluffy and delicious.  Followed the recipe except for the baking time.  Mine were done after 15 minutes!  Will gladly add this to my recipe file and look forward to the next batch!

These were good, i used a combo of frozen and fresh strawberries.I also added a handful of ground flax seed.  the nutmeg was a little strong for my taste, so when i make the these again i will either reduce it or omit it all together.

Nice fresh muffins. The color that flowed through themwas incredible and they made for a beutiful presentation. They do not have a veyr long shelf life, so they would be best kept in the refrigerator if you aren't going to eat them within a day or so.

My first time baking muffins and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I added an extra half a cup of strawberries and extra sugar for a bit more juice.  I left the nutmeg out altogether as I didn't have any at the time, and did not substitute it with anything.  The muffins turned out perfect nonetheless!  Very moist, not too sweet and definitely not bland at all.  I don't think I will add nutmeg the next time either as I quite liked them without it.  Thanks for the great recipe!  ps.  They tasted just as good and fresh the very next day.

This recipe is a keeper. I make this recipe for breakfast at a school where I work for 40+ people. I made them in a bakery sized muffin and cooked them a bit longer. I added more strawberries as suggested and I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour. Everyone loves them!

Very tasty and moist. I only added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and the rest I followed to the "T". I had enough to bake 12 muffin cups and it came out nice and brown with strawberries poking out all over the muffins.

I didn't get very much water out of my strawberries & I was afraid that the batter would be really dry so I mixed in some light sour cream & skim milk with the sugar water. I also make a homemade pumpkin pie spice mix that I used for the nutmeg adding more than 1/4 t. They are good & baked up really pretty. I only made 9 so they are huge. They were brown on the outside, but I was afraid still underdone in the middle, so I turned off the oven and left them in a few additional minutes.

These were really good.  I used 2 c. strawberries, 1/2 c. oats & 1 1/4 c flour and I sub. all the sugar for Splenda Sugar Blend, used cin. instead of nutmeg and used applesauce instead of butter.  I also put the berry/sugar mixture in micro for 25 sec.

I read all the reviews and was worried that I would not have enough liquid from the strawberries, but I did! The chopped strawberries and sugar mixture produced more than 1 cup of liquid. Per the other recommendations on this page, I used more sugar and I added some cinnamon to the batter. Also, I used 1 stick of butter due to the extra sugar used. Great muffins! Will bake again.

Made these muffins this morning and i was really pleased with the way they turned out.  I doubled the quantities to make really big ones.  They have a delicious strawberry taste to them.  My kids have absolutely devoured them.  They barely got cooled. will be keeping this recipe.  definitely would use again

I thought these were bad. The nutmeg was too strong, and the color of the muffins was an ugly dark color.  They don't keep well either.

Very good. I too thought that the batter was a wee bit thick, but they turned out ok. Next time I'll try adding some cream cheese or sour cream to make them a little less dry.

These muffins were great!  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the nutmeg which I don't like.  I did have  to add some water to the batter as I didn't have enough strawberry juice.  The muffins had a great texture, and the strawberries made them very moist.  I loved them.

I made half of this recipe using one full cup of chopped strawberries.  As another reviewer suggested, I doubled the butter and added 1/4 t. baking powder (for my 1/2 recipe).  I also skipped the nutmeg as a personal preference.  These smelled heavenly while they were baking.  The only real problem I have with this recipe is the oven temp and baking time.  I lowered my temp to 400 and baked these for about 20 minutes, which was too long, even at the lower temperature.  I can’t imagine what they would have been like if I had baked them at 425, hence only 4 stars, but I would make them again.

Good, moist muffin. Followed recipe exactly. I think putting turbinado sugar on top before baking would send these over the top. I also will use clear vanilla next time to make a prettier muffin.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed Jillian's suggestion with upping sugar and butter and cinnamon,  and also added almond extract.  I used 3cups fresh strawberries and they were extra fruity and husband loved them.  I did as big muffins in paper lined muffin pan, but it's so cakey I would do in pan to serve as a cake for a dessert.  Definitely a keeper,

I think I am giving up on finding a decent strawberry muffin recipe.  I think I have tried most of them on this site, and none of them have been good.  I had a very hard time getting the batter to come together for these muffins.  And, although, I am a huge nutmeg fan, I did not think the spice worked well in these at all.  On a good note, these are beautiful muffins, nicely domed, with the berries oozing out of them.

Just made these muffins on yesterday for my grandson,and he has yet to come and get them, and there are only 6 left They are not the prettiest muffins, but they are simply some of the best you will ever taste. The only thing I added was the zest of one lemon--and that was it.

These were good, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. That may have just been because the strawberries themselves were too bland. My roommate liked them, though.

EDIT: The more I ate these, the more I liked them, and they were a success with all of my friends. The flavor is subtle, but pleasant.

At first I didn't like how these turned out, I thought they were too bland and a little dry. I'm thinking the strawberries just didn't produce as much juice as expected. However I have kept them in a ziploc bag and now (the day after baking) they seem to be a little moister and have a touch more flavor. I might use this recipe again and just add more juice.

These were SO delicious!! I read some reviews that said there wasn't enough liquid, but I didn't have that problem. When I washed the strawberries I left them wet and didn't dry them, which made for more liquid. I also sprinkled a little sugar on them before baking. They didn't get a 5 star rating from me because of the unattractive color they turned out to be. At 1st glance they didn't look to appealing, but the taste made up for it.

We thought the muffins were pretty good.  However, the taste of nutmeg really overpowered the muffin. So, the next time I make these muffins I'll only use half of the called for amount.

Very good. Accidentally melted butter instead of softening, but it still worked.  Used just 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  Watch at the end - mine got a little overcooked.

Not bad.  Missing something.  I too, added a banana, 1/4 cup of yogurt, cinnamon and sprinkled the tops with sugar.  Maybe some nuts or filling would help take them up to fantastic.

I do NOT bake! :) However, since there is such an abundance of strawberries recently, I could't pass up the chance....these were easy and Excellent!!!!!! Just the right amount of moisture and fluffiness! I made the recipe exactly as stated. I will say that there is a lot of sugar in it so I can't have them too frequently...but this will definitely stay in my recipe book. :)

I think this is a great recipe, with just a few little tweaks needed.  As others have mentioned, these muffins were done in 15 min, and they probably should have gone more like 13-14 min.  Also, the batter is really thick so I added a little milk (2-3T) to thin it out just a tad. My final recommendation would be to double the recipe and really load the muffin tin until it's full.  The muffins I made this morning came out a little flat/small.

I made these and thought they were pretty yummy, but only after they sat for a day.  Something about the warm muffin right out of the oven made the strawberries taste strange.  The flavor was much better the second day.  I did use 2 cups of strawberries, and also warmed up some strawberry preserves and added it to the berry juice to stir into the batter.  This gave the muffins a lot more stawberry flavor and added extra sweetness.  Next time I make these I will consider adding a cream cheese mixture, or simply a dollup of strawberry filling into each muffin before baking.

These muffins were AWESOME! Great way to use up strawberries and they have a WONDERFUL strawberry flavor. I added more strawberries than was called for just because I needed to use them all up and I think I wound up with about a 1/2 cup strawberry juice. Also, I think I might not have cut my strawberries small enough (or maybe I didn't cook my muffins long enough) as there was still a little dough around the bits of strawberry.  I can't wait to experiment with this recipe some-I think next time I might brown the butter and use brown sugar and cinnamon

I didn't have enough strawberries so added a mashed banana.  I also added half a teaspoon of baking powder and a dollop of sour cream to help it rise more.  Came out light and fluffy, can't wait to try this recipe again when strawberry season arrives.

They need to be a little bit sweeter for me.  I did try them right out of the oven, and am not a fan of hot fruit, so I'm hoping they are a bit better cooler.

I really wanted to like these.  I hate to say it but I didn't care for them that much.  I did everything per the instructions, except I added some semisweet chocolate chips to SOME of the muffins.  They all had a funny, fermented taste to them, even the ones I DIDN'T alter with the chocolate.  Maybe it was leaving the berries to sit in the sugar for an hour?  Too long?  I don't know, it was probably my fault, but we just didn't like them much.

The color was strange.  Something inbetween pink and grey.  It lacked flavour.  I would try it again with a lot more sugar.  I added a half cup more strawberries but that made some of the muffins with too much fruit and not enough dough so fell a part easily.  This is a good muffin for those who want something healthy and natural.  A good breakfast muffin.

These muffins were alright.  The muffins are very dense.  They were a little dry and not very sweet.  This recipe needs adjusting a bit.

My boys and my husband really liked these....I have had two and still haven't decided what I think.  I used cinnamon in place of the nutmeg, 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the 1/4 white cup when mixed with the butter and I am not a fan of chunks in my muffins so I pureed my strawberries but am thinking next time I will go with the chunks due to it didn't provide a very pretty appearance.  I also used a container of frozen strawberries (but thawed them in the fridge the night before).  I microwaved the sugar and strawberries for 25 seconds instead of waiting an hour.  Overall it was an easy recipe and my goal was met by providing muffins for my boys as an alternative to the sugar filled poptarts and cereal!

WOW.  This recipe is wonderful!  The muffins were moist and not too sweet.  The strawberry flavor really came through.  I pureed my strawberries, only because I don't like pieces of fruit in my muffins.  This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I made mini muffins--they were a big hit with my husband and friends. 

If you make the mini kind, bake between 5-8 minutes.

I thought these muffins were pretty good. I changed a few things, however. I didn't add the nutmeg since I'm not a fan of it, and I used 1/2 cup of oats and 1 1/4c of flour instead of 1 3/4 c of flour. Next time I'd probably use less sugar though, They were  a bit sweet for my taste.

These are pretty good.  I think the bf ate a bunch when he came home last night--I see less muffins today than expected.  I didn't quite follow the directions exactly, bc I wanted to use up some frozen strawberries I had.  I didn't really measure, but I think I may have double the amount of strawberries as a result and ended up with 18 muffins, not 12.  At any rate, I'm wondering if the complaints about not enough juice could be resolved if the recipe called for frozen strawberries.  In my experience--and it held true for this recipe too--frozen strawberries seem to have more juice, so I didn't have any issues with not enough liquid.  I tossed in cinnamon as well, and thought there could be a few more spices added, like cloves adn allspice.  Overall, though, nice muffins for breakfast.  Thanks!

They could have been a tad-bit more moist, but overall, they were good.  What I liked about these muffins was that they weren't overly sweet like most baked goods.  I'll make them again.  :)

The fact that I baked this from scratch when I am not much of a baker says alot.Recipe is easy to follow,tried and tested.Besides nutmeg,I added grounded cinammon too.It turned out just nice,not too sweet and I would definitely bake this sometime again.

Love them!
They turned out really good, the flavour was excellent and overall turnout was amazing. Would definitely make again, maybe substituting the strawberries for raspberries.

I feel like I made these wrong... the batter prior to adding the strawberries was extremely thick. I verified correct measurements, but I used a mixer and the batter came out like bread dough. This seemed to translate to the texture of the muffins which were fairly dense and hardy. Good taste but I'll try another muffin recipie for my next batch.

I wasn't really impressed by these. I followed the suggestions in the comments from other users, and even so I found them to be quite bland. I ended up putting a bit of icing on top to give them more oomph, but I hate having to resort to that. The best thing about the muffins were the big chunks of strawberries...when you bite into those it's fantastic! But the rest of the muffin was just "meh", with a not-so-great texture. I wouldn't make these again.

I always substitute applesauce for the butter or oil in a recipe and use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and these did not turn out very well. Consistency was Ok but I didn't care for all of the nutmeg in them. Hubby and daughter said they were OK but I will keep looking for a strawberry muffin recipe.

Not impressed, very bland.  There is something missing. I tried adding more sugar but it just didn't help.  I also tried with jam in the centers but that did not help either.  
Trying to find a good strawberry muffin recipe for my valentines day baskets...this one will not be it.

Took others adivce and added extra 1/2 cup of berries-still, muffins were pretty blah, despite pretty sweet strawberries to start with.  Will not make again.

Incredibly easy to make these moist, tasty muffins.  After reading the reviews I found there seems to be a problem with the amount of liquid the strawberry/sugar mixture makes. I used 2 cups (1 pound - lg. plastic  container at grocery) of chopped strawberries mixed with 3/4 cups of white sugar. I made sure to completely coat all the strawberries with the sugar, covered and let sit 1 hr. When I drained the liquid I had exactly 1 cup of liquid and I used it all.  I was worried this may have been too much liquid but the result was perfection. The muffins rose, were a golden color and delicious! I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the mixture. I baked for 16 minutes.  Do not over bake! The recipe yielded 15 muffins (probably due to the extra strawberries and liquid and the creaming of the butter/sugar by hand. I always cream by hand so it is very fluffy and full of air but not beat to death! This recipe is definitely a keeper....we love it!

This is a great muffin. I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg. Adding the strawberry juice from the strawberries that you let sit was a brillant touch and added that strawberry flavor throughout the muffins.

These were good muffins.  I liked the unique taste of the nutmeg with the strawberries.  I added a little yogurt into the batter to make the muffins extra moist since my strawberries weren't extremely ripe.  I'll definitely make again!

Muffins looked pretty. Topped off w/ cinnamon streusel. Used lots of fresh strawberries which made the inside very wet and mushy. The muffins that had more batter than strawberries seemed moist yet still harsh down my throat. Others raved that these were good, but I think they were talking about the top of the muffin w/ streusel. I'm off to try a different recipe and to get a muffin top pan! My DD loves muffin tops.

These muffins are amazing!!  I read other  comments and added 1 banana and they came out great.  Tasted like banana bread with strawberries in it.  They were not dry at all, and not too sweet either.  They did not last very long at all.  Would highly recommend these muffins!

I let my strawberries sit overnight so that I had lots of juice to make sure these muffins were extra moist. I served them while doing Craft services on a film shoot and they went over really well.

These muffin are very good! I put 2 cups of strawberries instead of 1 1/2 because I love strawberries. I also left out the nutmeg because I dont like that. Other than that I followed the recipe. I only baked mine for 15 minutes. I think 18 minutes would have been way to long. I will be making these many many more times!!

This recipe was quite good.  I did make some modifications to the recipe by adding 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp of baking powder.  Muffins were nice and light and very tasty!

These were yummy and full of flavor as is, but after reading reviews I:  used 2 cups of strawberries, added 1/3 c brown sugar in with the butter instead, and added 2tbsp cream.  In with the flour, I added ginger and a pinch of ground cloves.  (oh, and dark chocolate chips!)  These are my kids new favorite!

This would have been a decent strawberry bread, though it was a little bland. But it did not taste like a muffin.

Luscious strawberry muffins!!!  So easy to prepare and quick to make.  I only made two changes - adding more strawberries and a little more sugar to the fruit reserve.  The batter smelled lovely!!!!  The muffins were moist, not too rich, just the right sweetness...I've got a new favorite baked good to make for gifts!!!!

These were a great way to use some extra strawberries.  The only changes I made was to use 2C of strawberries and after letting them sit aside on the counter for 1 hour, I put them into the fridge overnight bc I didn't have enough time that evening. That seemed to take care of the issue of not having enough liquid that some reviewers mentioned.  I also only needed to bake these for 12 minutes.  These were great and plenty sweet for our taste!

At first I thought I did something wrong... before I added in the juice and berries, the mixture was so dry i could pick it up in my hands just like pie crust would be (a thick dough.) I mixed in the berries and juice but it was hard to mix it well because of the dough thickness it did not get fully mixed. Baked them and they were fine, but not as sweet as i'd like. Going to try addind in chocolate chips next time and melting the butter instead of just softening it. Also, had to use a mixer for the eggs sugar and butter because it would only mix in chunks.

These are so delicious!  My strawberries did not produce much juice, so I added just a bit of milk.  The batter is really thick and they only took 17 minutes, be sure you check them before 18 minutes or they may over cook.

These were fantastic.  Usually I don't care for strawberry baked anything because it too sweet.  These however were perfect.  Also, as a new baker I was worried about how they'd turn out, but the instructions were easy to follow.  Thank you.

these turned out good for me. very tasty. mine didn't grey like strawberry muffins sometimes do. Prep time should be changed as the recipe says to let the strawberries sit for 1 hour BUT I used fresh/frozen strawberries & just added sugar to those and thawed them in the microwave so it only took a few minutes to get the juice. I didn't have nutmeg so I used apple pie spice.next time I'm going to cut the strawberries smaller.I baked mine for 15 minutes.turned out great.

This recipe doubles great, I made 12 jumbo muffins instead of 12 small ones. I also added about another 1/2 cup of strawberries for extra flavor.

50% White Whole Wheat Flour / 50% All-Purpose. Also, 16 minutes instead of 18 minutes. 

I love the recipe; it makes great strawberry muffins. The only change I made was using a Texas muffin pan and 50% White Whole Wheat flour. 

I check the internal temperature to 190 F. The toothpick test completely failed (lots of liquid inside), but I rolled the dice since food still cooks once it comes out of the oven, and on the wire rack. 

Slightly underdone, but delicious

So, my next experiment might be backing down the temperature to maybe 400 F and keeping the 18-20 minute cooking time

The batter turned out like cookie dough, and I had to add about 1/2 cup of milk. The muffins were so bland it tasted  like hot dog buns. I'm definitely looking for another strawberry muffin recipe. They were such a deception to my taste buds. They weren't sweet enough either. This recipe had so many flaws I can't modify it, and ,so like I said earlier I'm going to look for another recipe and hopefully it's not deceptioning like this one.

I'm not a huge fan of strawberries but my hubby bought a huge basket full of berries and no one was eating them .I thought there was a bit too much sugar( I subbed it for cane sugar) , but still sweet. The batter was a bit weird at first but the more juice you add the more moist it gets .These were very tasty and we gobbled them up in a couple of days.Good for fast breakfast on the go

The recipe was a wonderful way to use up some of my fresh Florida Strawberries! 1/2 cup of sugar seems like a lot and letting it sit for an hour didn't produce much liquid. As some other reviewers mentioned I had to add more water. I think next time I will set up the strawberries and sugar earlier so it has time to create more liquid. The muffins were wonderful, though. Very sweet and tasty!

2.29.16   Florida strawberries are in season right now, and I picked four quarts this morning at a field near my house, so they couldn't be any fresher.  The one thing that didn't seem quite right about this recipe was the temperature at  425.  I've never baked a muffin at higher than 375, but I did bake these for 17 minutes at 400 degrees F...perfectly done.    My chopped berry-sugar mixture sat for probably close to 2-1/2 hours (got distracted with something else). FYI, it took about a pint of strawberries for 1-1/2 cups of chopped berries.  My berries shrunk considerably in size (probably because I let them sit too long, my bad), but I had a LOT of juice available to mix into the batter which sweetened the flavor.  Before going into the oven, I topped each muffin with a sprinkle of turbinado sugar and a strawberry slice.   They are exceptionally tender and moist and full of fresh strawberry flavor, and I'm happy with the way they turned out.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is excellent just as it is. I have two tips, 1. If you cut the sugar or don't let he strawberries sot the full hour, you will get less juice out of the strawberries and 2. The first time I made these muffins, I misunderstood the directions and blended the dry ingredients directly into the creamed mixture. I didn't realize my mistake until it was done but the muffins still tasted great although it was harder to fill the muffin tins because of the texture and I only ended up with 10 muffins instead of twelve. So learning from my mistake I followed th directions exactly the second time and it was definitely worth the extra time and effort that adding the liquid and dry  ingredients intermittently takes. The mixture was much easier to pour into the muffin cups. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

These would be better with more juice, but the recipe never says how much you need, so you guess every time.  I ended up with about 1/4 cup juice from 2 cups of strawberries.  The muffins were dense and heavy.  The taste was good, but the texture leaves much to be desired.  If I try this recipe again, I'll go my own way with it.

Super easy and very delicious!! Great way to use up those day old berries. I baked them for 19 minutes, when I make them again I will bake them for 18.

This was a great way for me to use up a package of strawberries that were almost ready to be thrown away. The only changes I made were to use a half cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar in the batter, substituted cinnamon for nutmeg and I baked at 400 in a nonstick muffin pan. They are excellent!

These were delicious! I used strawberries I had picked and frozen last spring. When they were thawed, there was lots of juice, but I still added the 1/2cup sugar to the berries. I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg. Next time I make these I would add 1/4 cup sugar and maybe put fancy sugar on the tops. They were done after 16 minutes in the oven.

The consistency ended up too thick, I had to loosen it with water. As a result, the muffins also ended up being a little less sweet than we would have liked. But beautiful texture and the strawberries are acidic little droplets in the mix. We tried drizzling frozen-strawberry syrup over them - worked well overall. While I couldn't help lamenting the strawberries as I chopped 'em (I am a huge fresh-fruit-freak) it turned out to be lovely, light bake.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing, both fresh out of the oven and after being refrigerated overnight. The whole family enjoyed them.

I made another batch in mini-cupcake tins and froze them for another day. 

This is a perfect way to use up strawberries that have passed their prime when you don't want them to go to waste!

after reading the reviews, i decided to use 2 cups of strawberries too with a bit more sugar.  but unlike some of the other reviews, i think i had yielded too much liquid out of my strawberries...  after adding in all the liquid, the batter was too watery, and therefore i randomly added in more flour.  also, i baked at 200C only, and perhaps that's why it took over 25 mins baking.  after all these hassles, the muffins came out fine with a crispy top, but the taste of strawberry is still not too outstanding... may add some strawberry yogurt to up the taste next time.

I have made these several times using 2 cups fresh strawberries and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I preheat the oven at 425, then turn to 375 when putting muffins in.  Baked for 18 minutes, turned out perfect.  We love them!!!  Today, I used this recipe to make strawberry bread, I added about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, baked in a small loaf pan at 350 for 30 minutes.   Wonderful taste.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used 2 cups strawberries and tossed with 1/2 cup sugar. Added the strawberries to the Cuisinart and pulsed 2x. 
Jillian's review stated she used 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup sugar which I also did and also added the baking powder and cinnamon.
Another suggestion was adding chocolate. I added about 1/2 cup which I also added to the Cuisinart and pulsed to the consistency I wanted.Baked at 425 for 18 mins.
Great way to use strawberries and will make this recipe again.

A very tasty way to use fresh strawberries.   I followed the recipe as written except I used 2 cups of strawberries with the juice they made.  I am going to try this in a loaf pan next time.

The idea of these muffins sounded really good, but when I made them, I found they lacked a lot of flavor and weren't as fluffy or moist as I hoped they would be.  If I'm going to put strawberries in my muffins again, it will be using a different muffin batter.

Very good.  I made the following modifications:

I used 2 cups part thawed frozen strawberries and then added sugar over the top.  No need to let it set.  I used oil instead of butter and pumpkin pie spice.

After reading reviews, I decided to make a few changes.  I used 2 C of fresh, very ripe strawberries mixed with 1/2 C of sugar and let it sit for about 1/2 hour.  I also used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, 2 tsp of vanilla extract and found some raspberry flavoring in my pantry that I thought would kick the muffins up a notch, so I put about 1/2 tsp in the batter.  I topped the unbaked muffins with a sprinkle of extra sugar.  Yes, the batter was very thick, but they baked perfectly and are very moist.  I'm impressed- great way to use extra strawberries!

these have a wonderful taste.  Thank God for the nutmeg or the muffin would have been a little bland.  Not too sweet, but for the different flavors, the amount of sweetness was fine.  Not sure I will try again, but this is a good recipe.

I didn't have any problem with the mix being too dry, but I made sure to mix in just a bit of the flour mixture and then a bit of juice and repeated this until it was all mixed in. Perfectly moist! Maybe I got more juice out of the strawberries than others because I mixed the strawberry/sugar mixture a few times during the hour that I let it sit. Added some cinnamon and baked for suggested time and they came out great!!

This is a pretty good muffin.  There's just something missing... more sugar in the batter would be a good start, but there's still something else.  They're delicious, don't get me wrong... but next time I make them, I'll be adding more sugar.

I completely changed this up, solely based on the fact that I was a) missing some ingredients, b) wanted to make the healthier and c) was impatient.  I halved the flour with ww flour, used 1/4c plain yogurt and 1/4 c skim milk ricotta in place of the butter and didn't wait for the berries to macerate for more than 15 minutes (had very little liquid).  oh, and I added half a banana as I was just shy of 1.5 cups of berries.  totally changed, I realized, but really delicious.  you don't miss the butter one bit (I swear!).  the muffins are moist, fluffed up nicely and have just enough sweetness (think the banana helped) for a morning treat.  enjoy!

They are no doubt some of the prettiest muffins I've made, and they are tasty. However, I took a bite of the dough by itself (without a piece of strawberry) and found it was pretty bland. With the strawberries though, it's a very yummy little muffin =] Next time I would add more strawberries, definately!

My family loved them! giving it a 4 only because i made alterations!  i almost never make a recipe exactly as is.  i didn't have nutmeg so i used cinnamon and i even added a pinch of allspice.  i like adding oats to my muffins as well but i only had packaged instant oatmeal - added that in too.  i also used sub'd some brown sugar instead of all white in the mix.  Finally, I found 15 minutes was plenty of time in my oven.  I'll make again for sure.

SO GOOD!!!  I substituted the nutmeg with cinnamon and 1/4 white sugar with brown sugar like others suggested.  They came out sooooo moist.  Maybe it's because I cut the strawberries into very small pieces.  They did come out a weird greyish purplish color though... but that might be because I used unbleached flour and I didn't bother to be careful with the way I was stirring the batter (and may have smashed some strawberries).  Once my husband and I tasted them though, we could care less about the color!
