Mmmmm...this was great!  I followed the directions;  pounded the chicken, put in the pesto and cheese then rolled them.  The only think I did different was that after they were rolled, I dipped them in egg and rolled them in breadcrumbs.  They came out moist and delicious after about 45 mins.

I have made this several times, each time it gets better and better, I have made a few changes ( not that it needed it!) but I soak the chicken in olive oil and Italian spices over night, and then after I have rolled it up I cover it in Italian bread crumbs! I serve it over fettuccine and top with a sun dried tomato Alfred sauce! And it is out of this world!!

Fantastic! I took someone else's advice and just covered the chicken breasts with pesto, then mozz. Covered with foil for 20 minutes, then uncovered and returned to the over for 10 minutes. Came  out perfectly.

I was in a hurry to quickly get something in the oven the other night when I got home from work late, so I did not take the time to pound the breasts out flat. Insted, I just spooned  a couple tblsps of the basil pesto over each breast, and then topped them with nice big slices of good quality motzza. I covered the baking dish with foil, and baked them at 350 for about 20 mins. I then uncovered them, and baked them for about 5-10 mins longer, and that browned the cheese nicly, while still keeping the chicken SUPER moist and yummy. Will deffinetly do this again. Thanks for the good idea! :)

Simply delicious, and definitely worth making your own pesto for, which I handily had in the freezer. I used  shredded mozzarella rather than the slices because it was easier to roll up, and added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Perfectly roasted, cooked through and tender at 375 degrees, about 35 minutes.

This was very good...but make sure you lightly season the chicken breast ..i just seasoned with some salt, pepper and garlic powder.  And just a note to all: boneless chicken breast doesn't take long to cook.  I baked in 375 degree preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes.  That's all the time you need. Someone posted that they had to cook the meat almost an hour. I'm trying to figure how the chicken breast can still be moist after baking that long.   Otherwise, this was very nice and if i don't feel like going through the hassle of rolling the chicken up...I just flattened with mallet....topped  (seasoned) breast with pesto then cheese and then topped with another flattened chicken breast.  Next I'll try with the jarred sundried tomato.

These are simply delicious and so easy!  To make them easier to roll I used shredded mozzarella cheese and added sun-dried tomatoes for a little color and a little added flavor (not that it needs any).  To prevent the pesto and cheese from leaking out dip the rolls into egg and then italian style bread crumbs.  These were done in 35 minutes at 350.  Very moist and a nice presentation.  It looks like you spent hours!

This was delicious, and I am a picky eater!  I used nice thick mozzarella cheese slices.  The only suggestion I would make is seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, and after it is in the oven for about 15 minutes, using a pastry brush and brushing the tops of the chicken rolls with the oils that ooze out of the rolls.  The oils are garlic infused from the pesto and it give the chicken an amazing flavor and keeps it from drying out.  YUM!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's simple an quick to make. I pounded my chicken flat, seasoned one side with salt, pepper and garlic powder and then spread the pesto on the unseasoned side. I only cooked the chicken for 30 minutes, at 350, and it was perfect. I served it with Garlic Parmesan Orzo (also from this site) and stewed tomatoes. This is definitely going to be served again when I need to make something quick for dinner.

This was a big hit at our house.I did a little tweaking though....I used sundried tomato pesto and shredded cheese instead of sliced. I topped it with shake and bake crumbs.Delicious!

You can't beat recipes that call for so few ingredients! I admit though that, like others, I dipped the stuffed chicken breasts in beaten egg and then coated them in bread crumbs (panko actually). Drizzled them in a little melted butter, then baked as stated. A bit of the cheese leaked out but, other than that, they turned out great! Next time I might add a little grated Parm or some garlic powder to the crumb mix. Thanks, CHOMPY!

So simple! I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and then sauteed the rollups to a nice golden brown before finishing off in the oven. Yum!

This was fairly tasty with some modifications. We rolled the chicken with provolone and prosciutto. Also, after hearing it was dry we marinated the chicken halves for 4 hours in the pesto sauce. It still came out a little bit dry since all the cheese and oil dripped out of the rolls while baking. We will have to try the breadcrumbs next time and cook it for less time. Thanks for the recipe!

Even better with sundried tomatoes stuffed in with the basil. Orzo with parmesan and lemon pepper is a good side

Brushed each chicken roll with an egg wash and then sprinkled bread crumbs over. Baked covered 20 mins and then uncovered another 10-15. Took out, grated a little feta on top of each and put under the broiler for a couple mins to brown. Next time I'll put the feta inside with the cheese and pesto.  Delicious!

This was great! My teen son asked for 2nds & 3rds, then scraped the pan clean.  I used Asiago cheese and after rolling up, dipped each piece in Creamy Italian dressing, then Italian bread crumbs.   Next time I will make MORE!   It is easy and really delish!

Delicious!  I made my own pesto and loved the fresh taste.  I'm definitely making this again.  I followed a few reviews and baked at 375 for 25-30min.

I tried this recipe and found that it was WONDERFULL! The only change I had to make was to bake the chicken for a slightly longer time. I had to bake for about an hour and 5 minutes which is 15 min. longer then the recipe stated. Also, in order to make this more healthy I think I could cut the amount of chease and pesto and have the same overall effect. A GREAT IDEA!

Very easy. If you like basil, this is great. The boys in the house liked it really well. I was surprised at that. I was looking for something to use up pesto I bought to make something else with. Next time I think I'll put some roasted red peppers in with it, or maybe layer it on flat chicken breasts. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and delicious!! Pounded, salt pepper and Mrs Dash Table Blend to outside, spread pesto on entire insides, added cheddar slices(all we had) rolled up, dipped in 2% milk (have no eggs currently) and plain toasted breadcrumbs, sprayed with PAM Olive Oil Cooking Spray, popped them on the broiler into the oven and 30 mins (also broiled for a minute at the end for an extra crunch) and VOILA!!! Thank you thank you! Served ours with baked potato and green bean, asparagus, onions and mushrooms. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this tonight and  all I can say is WOW! It was fantastic. My husband at first poked at it curiously and asked, "What's the green stuff?" but proceeded to inhale it. The taste was so sophisticated, yet it all came together so simply. I read a few other people's reviews and followed some advice: I used Meunster cheese inside and sprinkled shredded Italian blend on top of the breasts during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I read that some were having trouble with the chicken getting dry, so I cooked it for 35 minutes at 375, but also added a splash of white wine to the pan and covered the dish while baking, so it stayed quite moist. Bravo, I'll definately be making this again.

This recipe was great. I LOVE pesto and my husband is not a huge fan but he loves this dish. I also added a little pesto to the top in order to keep the chicken from drying out. Classico also sells a sun-dried Tomato Pesto - I can't wait to try this dish using that. YUMMY!!

Hey, that stuff was awesome! I didn't bother to roll it up. I just put about 8 oz. of slices mozzarella on top of flattened chicken breasts. It was fantastic. My only minor complaint is that it came out slightly dry, but I guess all baked chicken is like that. Next time I make it I am going to let the chicken soak in the pesto over night, and I am going to cover it in the oven.

I made this for a very romantic dinner, and it was perfect!  It didn't take a lot of time to prepare, but tasted better than something you would get at a gourmet restaurant.  I made rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus with it...and as a perfect compliment, I served it with a light Chardonnay!

Excellent combination of flavors! It's a super quick & easy recipe with only 3 ingredients. I have made this recipe for years and always as a 'topped' chicken breast. The trouble of rolling is just an unnecessary step. The men in our family need more spice, and I've placed sliced jalapeños on top of the pesto. They nestle in quite well, especially with the melted cheese holding all together!

This was so good, and so easy!  I brushed the tops of my rolls with additional pesto. The last 15 minutes I threw some zucchini in the pan to roast.  I couldn't believe how moist my chicken was.  I'm not a big chicken fan, but will definitely make this again.

I rated this 4 stars only because I had to make a few adjustments to turn it into a 5 star recipe. I marinated by pounded chicken breasts in Italian dressing all day. Used fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese and sprinkled fresh grated parmesan romano cheese on top before baking. I served with spaghetti squash and marinara sauce. I live a low-carb life so this was perfect!

Excellent recipe. I modified it: pounded the breast. Spread roasted garlic, cracked pepper & pesto, added mozzarella medallions & baked at 350 for 20 min covered. Uncovered and baked for 15 min more to melt/brown cheese. Sprinkled with fresh basil, crumbled feta, sun dried tomatoes & toasted pine nuts. Served with parmesan cous-cous & asparagus. This is a great, easy recipe!! Can't recommend it enough.

This is a great quick meal. After spreading the pesto, I added a roasted red pepper to each chicken breast and then the mozzerella. I then folded the breasts and coated them in breadcrumbs and drizzled with a little melted butter. This made a fantastic meal.

These are wonderful.  Good enough to serve to company. The only change I made was to roll them in italian seasoned bread crumbs before baking - improves the appearance and adds just a little.  Thanks!!

10 stars!  This dish was soooo easy to make and absolutely delicious!  My recommendation is to let the cheese warm up to room temperature so it's easier to roll otherwise it breaks as you roll the chicken up.  Also, I used chicken breasts marinated in garlic and then dipped the rolls into egg and then italian bread crumbs and baked.  I served the dish with salad and pasta in white sauce.  Definitely a show stopper!

Super!  I used a small jar of basil pesto and 6 chicken breasts.  For the cheese, I simply rolled one piece of string cheese into each piece of seasoned chicken, and it rolled/baked/tasted like a dream!  I spread the tops with a little more pesto, and they turned out fantastic!  I used another's advice and baked them at a higher temp for 20-25 minutes.  They were cooked completely in that amount of time.  I was planning on getting a photo of the finished (beautiful) product, but they left the pan so quickly, I never had time!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Incredibly tasty and simple to make.  I just had some difficulty sealing the rolls with the toothpicks, but it was well worth the effort.  I highly recommend breading it (dredge with flour, dip in egg and cover with italian bread crumbs) before putting it in the oven so you get a nice flavorful crust.  My family, who are all picky eaters, all gave it two thumbs up!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was amazing.  Original recipe gets 4 stars, but with the adjustments made per the suggestions of the reviewers it's easily a 5 star.  I made my own pesto, from a recipe I found here and I breaded my chicken.  I think breading the chicken makes a huge huge huge difference.  I will most definitely be making again.

Surprisingly tasty, I made it for my best friends and they were even commenting about it the next day. I did make some adjustments based on other's comments: rubbed the chicken in salt, pepper and olive oil.  Also sprinkled some breadcrumbs and extra pesto and cheese on top.  As well as adding some white wine... this served as a good sauce when combined with the cheese that oozed out.

I used fresh pesto and asagio cheese. I also sprinkled italian style bread crumbs and drizzled a little olive oil over them before baking. Definately a winner in my house!!

This was very moist & tasty.  I had no fat on my chicken, so I covered it w/foil and it was swimming in juices when it was done.  Very easy too.

This was a good dish but mine came out a lil dry. I think my lack of moisture came from using prepacked thin sliced chicken breast meat which resulted in smaller sized rolls. I baked for 40 minutes uncovered and topped with extra cheese the last 8 minutes. It was difficult to roll and keep the pesto/cheese inside. I think shredded fresh mozzarella may work better than slices. I also dipped the rolls in egg batter and bread crumbs. Next time I would either reduce the cook time to 30-35 minutes if using thin sliced chicken or pound thick pieces of breasts down by hand as directed in the recipe. Lesson learned! Definitely worth another try. The combination of fresh pesto and fresh mozzarella were great. I served with Quick and Easy Grilled Potatoes (with dill) and Eggplant Mixed Grill from AR.

I think I cooked these too long because they were DRY!  I cut the recipe in half in order to just make two and used shredded cheese instead of sliced.  The flavor was really good, next time I will just watch the time better.

Yum! I cooked this over the grill instead of in the oven (it's to hot to turn on the oven), it was done in about 20 minutes. I also hate pounding chicken or any other meat, so I just cut it in half and stuffed it, it turned out great, nice tender and juicy!

I like that this recipe creates a different looking type of chicken dish.  But I will say I cooked for 45 minutes and it came out a bit dry.  So maybe only should be cooked for 30 minutes or so.  Still, interesting flavors.

Excellent.  After rolling the chicken with the pesto and cheese.  I breaded the outside using shake n bake and sprinkled shredded mozerella on top.  Covered and baked on 400 degrees for 35 minutes exactly.  Our guests loved it.  I will definately be making this recipe again.  Thank u!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit. I did as another reviewer suggested and added a small amount of sun dried tomatoes and then dipped the stuffed chicken in an egg wash and bread crumbs. I also served pesto sauce on the side.

Pretty good. I also dipped in egg and bread crumbs, and I'm glad I did. It seemed like there was too much pesto though, and I only used 1 tbsp for each chicken breast.

This recipe was really good.  I followed the other users advice and just put the pesto and mozzarella cheese on top and covered it to bake.  I also seasonsed the chicken a little with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding the pesto and cheese.  It turned out pretty good and I will definitely make it again.

I had some Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto (made with all pine nuts) in the freezer I wanted to use. This was very good! I did follow some other's suggestion and didn't pound the chicken and put the pesto and cheese on top. I browned them first, put the pesto and cheese on top and finished in the oven. We enjoyed this!! Thank you!

YUM!!! I marinated chicken breasts in italian dressing then covered in pesto and good quality, thick mozzarella. I greased the pan and splashed some white wine in the bottom before I put the chicken in the pan. I covered the dish with foil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then removed the foil and baked an additional 10 minutes. It came out PERFECT! Moist and delicious. The white wine and the melted cheese/pesto in the bottom of the pan made a nice sauce and I served it with bow tie pasta. My boyfriend was impressed!

Deeeeeelicious. It's going into my list of go-to recipes. I added egg wash and bread crumbs, and used shredded mozzarella and jarred pesto. I added a spoonful of spaghetti sauce to the cheese and pesto before rolling up. No need to use a toothpick; they stayed together just fine. About ten minutes before taking out of the oven I spooned more spaghetti sauce over the chicken and sprinkled more mozzarella over the top.  Really tasty meal for not too much work; the results far exceed the effort.

Don't let the simpleness of this recipe fool you. It's very tasty! I was a little lazy, so I didn't roll the chicken and pesto. Instead, I just sprayed the pan with Pam, placed the chicken in the pan (after sprinkling with a little house seasoning), and covered it with pesto and Italian blend cheese. Very yummy, I'll be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is without a doubt a 5 star recipe!  I followed the recipe as written the first time and everybody loved it.  The second time I followed the recipe and then rolled in raw egg batter and then in Panko flakes.  I turned the chicken half way through baking in order to get the bottom half crispy as well.  This recipe is definately a keeper!  I liked it so much that I passed it onto my brother and he liked it as well.

I made this for dinner tonight. Husband gave it 5 stars. I butterflied the chicken, added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken then spread the pesto ( I bought at Kroger) on the chicken, put the slices of mozzarella cheese on top, rolled, put tooth picks through chicken, rolled in Italian bread crumbs and baked in oven @ 375 for 35 minutes. Yummy! Will make again. Thanks again for sharing.

This was quick and easy. I have a *lot* of homemade pesto right now, so I used this idea. I dredged the rolled breasts in egg and breadcrumbs to add some flavor. Will keep handy for quick weeknight meals.

This was fabulous.  If possible, make home-made basil pesto rather than the store stuff.  Brushed the outside of the rolls with beaten egg and sprinkled bread crumbs on top. Thanks for sharing this wonderful dish.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the directions exactly as given with the exception of not pounding the chicken (didn't need to use to tenderize) and I added breadcrumbs to the outside of the chicken.  This is definitely a recipe I would use again and again.  Cooking time was perfect and I finally have a great recipe to use my homemade pesto for!

I made this recipe with out making them in rolls. Instead I covered the top of the breast with about 2-3 tbs of pesto sauce, I put a few slices of tomato on top of the sauce, then I added grated mozarella cheese to the top. Then put it in the oven @ 375 for about 25 min covered in foil then another 10 min without the foil. It all depends on how thick the chicken breast is. The chicken was very juicy and smothered in goodness. It came out so good. I can't wait to make this again.

These were just average, and too much effort for the end result.  The chicken was on the dry side.  We thought it needed a light pesto cream sauce to go on top - that would have completely made the recipe. I have to say I hate stuffed chicken recipes - my rolls NEVER look like the picture and the filling ALWAYS seeps out. I topped mine with more pesto and another slice of cheese before serving - still needed a sauce.

I made this dish twice last week. Once to test the recipe and then again to take over to my daughter's for her and the grandkids. Great! The only change I made was to add two slices of prosciutto on top of the pounded chicken breasts. Very, very good. This is definitely a keeper.

Quick and delicious!  The chicken was very moist and a great addition to the pesto pasta I served it with.  I followed the suggestion of only putting it in for 20 minutes covered in tin foil.  After those 20 minutes, I took it out, put a slice of tomato on each breast, and sprinkled it with shredded mozzarella. I then stuck it in, uncovered, for 10 more minutes.  This made it a lot more attractive when I served it.

I cooked this for our church luncheon potluck. It was a hit. I cooked mine over 1 hr because I had about 6 rolls in a baking dish. I followed the suggestions of other subscribers and added sundried tomatoes. It was a hit. I will add mushrooms next time. I baked it covered with foil then uncovered it adding bread crumbs and more mozzarella cheese for topping. I did notice that a lot of oil came out from the chicken, cheese and sun dried tomatoes (bought the one soaking in olive oil and drenched the chicken with it). I took most of the oil and left some to keep the chicken moist. Definitely will make it again!

I'm brand new to cooking, and this turned out awesome! I changed it quite a bit, and everyone loved it. I used mozzarella instead of the swiss, and put in a slice of ham. I also lightly breaded it after I rolled it up, and topped it with an extra teaspoon of the pesto. It was like a pesto cordon bleu! Yum!

This is a good base recipe, but it needs some tweaks.  Be sure to season the chicken or it will come out rather bland.  Also, it isn't the most attractive looking chicken, as it bakes up pale in color.  Perhaps a breading or crust of some sort would do the trick.  It might also taste better with a richer cheese.  I love the inspiration though!

I found that 3 tbs was too much per chicken breast, so I used a little less than 2. The first time cooking these, I followed the recommended cooking time and baked them for 40 minutes but they turned out dry and overcooked. The next time  I try making these, I will cook them for about 30.

Made this for my husband and a couple of friends. We all LOVED it! Everyone's plate was completely clean after dinner! I made my own basil pesto using basil from my parent's garden which I think added a nice touch. I also topped each breast off with left over pesto. Definitely will be making this again!

These were really easy and really good.  Flavor wise, I would give it a 4-star.  However, it being so easy to prepare, it easily earns a 5 star for convenience and oustanding flavor.

This recipe is So good and So easy to make! My family loves it. 
The only thing I did different was to use schreded mozzarella instead of sliced.
Thank You!

This is a 5 star dish. Very delicious and so full of flavor. I made my own basil pesto sauce, recipe from this website, and used fresh mozzarella cheese. I only lightly seasoned the chicken breast with pepper and salt, layerd the pesto and cheese and secured with toothpicks. I was surprised at how simple this was to put together and yet so flavorful. I baked this for 35 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees, the directions were easy and exact.  This was my first time making this dish and won't be my last....trust me I will be making this again and again. a definite winner in my recipe book! I served this with,"Mushroom Orzo," also from this site.

These were pretty good.  I dredged the rolls through egg and Italian bread crumbs before I baked them.  Served with fettuccine pasta and alfredo sauce.

So easy and so good!  I cooked at 350 uncovered and it needed about an hour.  I would suggest trying others advice and cook at 375 for a shorter time.  I also salted the meat and used shredded cheese.

Easy to make.  I used string cheese instead of sliced cheese which made rolling the chicken much simpler.  My kids (10, 8, & 7) all commented on how good it was.  Definitely will make again!

This was great I also made a paste of sundried tomatoes in oil and roasted red bell peppers spread that on the chicken then the pesto and grated italian blend cheese.  I also dipped it in egg and panko seasoned with some italian seasoning and some freshly grated parmasan.  Served it with fetuccini alfredo with sauted mushrooms and chives was a winner
.  I might also do this without panko and slice and eat cold for a buffet

I halved this recipe and had 4 half chicken breast servings. They were difficult to roll, so I more folded them in half. I rolled them in bread crumbs as other users suggested. Served with linguine with red peppers and more pesto. A tasty and easy Valentine's dinner!

I took reviewers' advice and dredged the chicken rolls in panko bread crumbs with greek seasoning.  Served the dish over a bed of orzo pasta tossed with butter and parmesian.  My husband and daughter (7) were very impressed.  Hubby said this was something he would've expected from a restaurant, not my home kitchen.  Was a nice dinner, but it took an hour to prepare.

Perfect way to use up leftover pesto! Quick & tasty. I used the "light pesto" recipe from this site with spinach instead of basil.

So good and so easy.  I butterflied my chicken breasts to get them thin enough.  I chose to use provolone for more flavor.  I dipped the rolled chicken in buttermilk and then in Italian style panko bread crumbs and placed them in a 13 x 9 pan coated with cooking spray and cooked as directed.  The result was fantastic!  Served with ravioli and a salad.

I am a pesto lover but this was just a little too much pesto for me.  I used a premade pesto sauce so that could have been the problem.  Next time I will use less.  I lightly breaded it and added some garlic powder... will make again though, just with less pesto!

Quick, easy, delicious.  I used shredded mozzarella, because I pounded my chicken too thin, and wouldn't have help up against a thick slice.  I used a packaged Pesto that worked great.  I think the brand was Kerr.  It was a great meal.

Hey Guys!  I fixed this for dinner last night.  This was sooo simple and fast.  We LOVED it.  I got a msg from my son,  "OMG! Mom this is wonderful!"   This will be a staple for us now.   I changed it alittle,  I put pesto sauce on the bottom of the pan, then the chicken w/more pesto then the cheese...You need to check your poesto sauce for salt.  I added a little salt and black pepper... Again  this is a winner

I rolled the chicken as thin as I could, and still it was a huge roll.  I obviously had large chicken breasts.  I also rolled it in egg & then bread crumbs.  I didn't have mozzarella, so I used creamy havarti.  This was very tasty.  The changes I will make next time, is to flatten the chicken, put the filling, then top with another chicken.

Absolutely delicious.  My husband and brother both raved about this!  Their exact words were, "tastes like a high quality restaurant meal."  I also seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, and some Italian seasoning.  I also drizzled with olive oil before baking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella because it's healthier and I think it tastes better...and OH MY!!  Delicious!!  I also put olive oil in the baking dish to keep the chicken extra-juicy.  Great recipe!

This was a great recipe, and everyone's comments helped out a lot, especially the one recomending the side dish of garlic parmasean orzo, it went perfectly together. When I made this dish I put it in a glass baking tray and put about 1 inch of chicken broth in the bottom to keep the chicken juicy and it worked out well. I also breaded the chicken rolls with italian bread crumbs mixed with parmasean and romano cheese. The next time I make this dish I want to try and get bacon involved, it should give it an extra boost of flavor, not that it needs more flavor.

This was very simple yet very tasty.  Instead of pounding the chicken and rolling it; I slit the chicken in half length wise being careful not to go all the way through; season the inside of chicken with a little salt pepper and garlic powder then spread the basil on the chicken and added the cheese fold the chicken back in place and baked in the oven at 350F for half an hour then broiled for 5 mins to give the chicken a little extra colour.  If I had cooked the chicken as long as stated in the recipe it would have been dry.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe.

Our chicken had good flavor but unfortunately turned out to be a little dry after 50 min. of cooking. It never browned on top either... I like the idea though and next time will make some modifications to suit our taste. Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good, but not fantastic.  It's easier to pound out thin if you butterfly the breast first and then pound thin, then roll up.

This was so good. I did not have mozz. cheese, so i used sharp cheddar and some grated parm with ramoano chesse. I was worried it may be too greasy, but it was so good, the cheddar gave it a nice bite. I also toped with the remaining pesto. fantastic. even kids loved it.

Amazing. Rave reviews from my fiance and a friend this weekend! I had shredded Italian blend cheese on hand, so I used that and topped the chicken rolls with marinara sauce before baking. Topped with extra cheese during the last five minutes of baking, and WOW! Thanks for sharing this one!

This was a huge hit in our house. I sprinkled some seasoned bredcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese over the tops of each breast after they were rolled a drizzled with just the smallest ampunt of olive oil. Incredible taste, extra moist - this recipe is going in the regular rotation. Oh, and I only cooked them for about 35-40 minutes - they were definitely cooked through.

Yummm Very Tasy!  Like other people, I followed one of the reviewer's advice.  Covered my chicken for the first 20 minutes then uncovered for another 20.  I stongly suggest pounding the chicken or you will find it a little bit dry.  I had to cut my chicken in half after I baked them because they were too thick.  I made half of my chicken rolled and the other half with the pesto spread on top with mozzarella.  Both ways were very good with a good splash of lemon juice.  I served mine over lemon pepper pasta from this site.  It turned out delicious!!

Absolutely easy, absolutely versatile and absolutely DELICIOUS! I added some thin tomato slices to the pesto/mozzarella recipe and loved it. I've also experimented using crumbled feta cheese and bruschetta spread instead of mozzarella and pesto, and I dusted the rolls with breadcrumbs. It's always well recieved and finished off no matter how I do it. I also used chicken breast fillets rather than just breasts since I thought it was easier to roll and made the portions more reasonable. Whether the recipe is followed just as written or whether it's experimented with, this recipe is SOOOO GOOOOOD!

I was told this was best chicken I made in years. Like others, I was short on time (or perhaps long on laziness for me...) My changes are: Rather than just pesto I used basil and pesto mix. Also used provolone cheese. I just thawed the chix and put in glass pan. Put basil/pesto over it, slapped on cheese. Cooked covered for 30 minutes, them 30 minutes uncovered. 
Almost as easy as cooking toast. Easier than Mac and Cheese. No Joke.

DELICIOUS!!! I love how simple this is, but yet so full of flavor! I used sliced munster cheese and Classicos version of pesto; I also rolled them in Italian seasoned breadcrumbs which I think is a must! I also used cooking rope instead of toothpicks cuz the toothpicks can sometimes rip the already pounded chicken. Served with whole wheat ritoni which I tossed in a bit of pesto and steamed asparagus....YUM!!!

This was pretty good.  I made it and put it on top of linguine that I tossed in pesto with some parmesean cheese.  The kids loved it!  I will put an extras slice of cheese on top next time.

Tried this today.  Really good!!  Rolled the chicken breasts in breadcrumbs, sprayed the top of each chick breast with butter flavored spray and baked at directed.  Came out great. Not dry at all.

This recipe is tasty without having to add 2 tablespoons of pesto on the chicken. I only added 1 tablespoon seeing that it's already well-spread over. I used chicken thigh meat instead. With the cheese in it, it's rather difficult to roll up tighted. The cheese still oozed out during baking time but it was not wasted as I could scoop up for serving. I just have to practice rolling more often. It's a great, tasty and healthy dish for the family.

This recipe is delicious!!! It was my first time pounding and rolling chicken breast so it wasn't neat and tidy but was still beautiful once cooked. I took some suggestions and smothered the breasts with scoops of pesto, then used a mozzarella string cheese and attempted to roll them up, securing with toothpicks.

I cooked at 375 for 30 minutes and could have added 3-5 more minutes because I was veering on the edge of undercooked - but it was juicy and delicious nonetheless! Super easy, quick and worthwhile recipe.

Sooooo good! I used the recipe but subbed thick slices of Havarti cheese because I didn't have mozzarella. I also marinated my chicken in sicilian lemon, white balsamic vinaigrette. My guy couldn't stop raving about it! I love AllRecipes!

Very good.
I used shredded mozza and soaked chicken in egg mix and breaded with Italian bread crumbs, kept the cheese and Pesto from coming out.
Browned in Skillet in Olive oil and finished in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350. Had some Pesto left over mixed it with Spaghettini and served with a salad. Delish!

This tasted good, but it didn't look as nice as I had hoped.  Why does the recipe call for a cup of pesto when you won't use that much if you follow the directions?  Next time, I think I'll just top the breasts with pesto and cheese and not bother rolling them up.

I did as others advised and rolled in bread crumbs (panko)and my husband actually said, "We need to have this again!" Never has he said that  before!!! (We've been together for 30 years, so you know what a big compliment that was!)This was the first time I had made pesto from our fresh basil and was looking for a recipe to use it, but I really think this recipe was the key! Thank you for such a wonderful dish!

Simple, quick and absolutely tasty!  I used shredded mozzarella and mixed it into the pesto, I butterflied the chicken breasts, and then placed some of the pesto cheese mixture into the middle and folded the chicken breast over.  Seasoned the outside w/ some garlic herb seasoning.  This is a keeper!

The only thing I didn't do was roll them up. I just put the pesto on and covered with mozz cheese. It was pretty good. I would like to use panko on them in the future.

I didn't roll it either, but I did crush some Caesar salad croutons to use as breadcrumbs and seasoned with salt and pepper before covering with pesto and provolone since I'd just run out of mozzarella.  Simple AND marvelous!

Super easy to make and delicious. The chicken breasts I used were not ideal for cutting/filling, so I just rolled up as best as I could without the toothpicks, and it still came out great.

More than doubled the recipe and got several repeat compliments after cooking this, and there was only one left by the end of the night. I made my own pesto. I didn't have fresh mozza so I sliced up a regular block and then cut those into strips to stuff into the inside, since the regular mozza is too inflexible to just roll up. Will use again!

very tender and juicy. I used 2 chicken breast and after flattening, halved them. I used regular slices of provolone (out of mozz). When rolled, the bundles came out just the right size for a serving. At this size, they stayed together well, and were not clumsy when finished.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was fantastic! I did take someone's advice and dipped the rolled chicken breast in egg then Italian bread crumbs. It was delicous! I baked it at 350 for 30 mintutes and it was slightly dry so I would decrease the cooking time in the future. I will be making this again very soon!

Was ok not great but ok.  Probably won't fix again.  But i'm sure it's just our taste and not in anyway a reflection of the recipe.

This dish is amazing, tasty, and simple to prepare.  I followed the advice from most helpful reviews...I prepared recipe as instructed in the beginning, but adhered advice of others by dipping the finished rolls in egg (I used egg substitute) and then dipping thourougly in italian bread crumbs--delicious! I cooked at 350 degrees for approx. 20-25  minutes. This is a dish you could serve to guests/company confidently:)

Delicious!  My only complaint would be that the chicken started drying out on the outside.  Next time I will try breading the outside to help keep it moist.  I served this on top of tortellini and pasta sauce.

I have made this for many people and have had nothing but excessively positive comments!  I follow the recipe, and, on top of the rolled pesto cheese chicken, I add Panko bread crumbs and chopped onion.  This makes it look more classy and it adds another dimension to the taste!

Great taste. a little dry... defiantly don't need to bake as long as the recipe says. I used shredded cheese instead of sliced.. easier to roll. overall I liked it and will make again.

My husband and I love this because it is very quick, easy, and tasty to make.  Great serving size for two people.  We use a meatloaf pan and place the rolls tight in the pan (as opposed to using toothpicks just because we didn't have any).  We also used some bread crumbs and garlic salt on the top after the trial run and it was perfect!

We make this often because it is different than just marinated chicken.  It can get a little bit messy, and it takes a little bit of time, but tastes great when you get done.  I also roll mine in a little egg and then italian breadcrumbs to make it extra tasty.

This is a great different way to have chicken, my husband and I loved it! It was a little messy. I had a hard time keeping the pesto from running out when I rolled it. I used a nice size cut of Mozzarella. Very yummy and will be making this again soon.

These were just great! It couldn't be easier. Have made it twice now and the second time used shredded Tex Mex cheese(all I had on hand) and they were great too. I imagine almost any cheese would work. I might try just butterflying the chicken next time. Thanks for a super recipe!

This is a good start to something great, the chicken needs to be seasoned, even just as simple as garlic salt and parm is good....next time Ill do it one better and make it  cordon bleu style dipped in egg and bread crumbs with a wine cream sauce.  Its definately a great idea and a good starter.

This recipe was great! I marinated pounded chicken breast in Italian dressing over night (prob. Only needed a couple of hours), spread the pesto, added shredded mozzarella, rolled them up securing with 3 toothpicks (both sides and middle), rolled in flour then eggs and finally Italian style panko bread crumbs and baked for 35 min. I really packed the bread crumbs on each end to keep in the filling. It came out wonderful, both my mother and grandmother asked for the recipe! Thanks CHOMPY!

This was very, very good.  My husband who isn't a big chicken fan even liked it and commented on how moist it was.  I the advise of some others and dipped them in egg whites then rolled in bread crumbs, then baked at 375 for 35 minutes.    Thank you for such a tasty and simple recipe.

Delicious!  When I planned to make this I had every intention of making the rolls.  But time got away from me so I did as a few others suggested.  I brushed the pesto on top of the chicken breasts and covered that with mozzarella.  This was so fantastic!  A must try!

I've been making this (well, a spin on this) for a couple of years.  I'm a little pressed for time (maybe lazier too??)...but usually "pocket" a whole chicken breast & stuff with basil pesto & a few nice slices of shaved parmesan.  The parmesan doesn't melt quite the same way, but melds with the pesto in a way that no other cheese can!  You can bake or even panfry the breasts.....YUM!!  Thank you for your take on this...I just may flatten the breasts next time!!

These were good, but  I thought it needed some more flavor.  I did coat in egg and bread crumbs and it stayed nice and moist.

This is very tasty. My husband said he would like more cheese next time around, but I thought it was perfect as is! I used the Easy Pesto recipe from on here too (added Romano cheese to it). Very easy and delicious dinner.

I loved this recipe; easy and delicious. Made it with the simple and easy garlic and basil recipe from this site using basil bursting from my garden. I will make this again and may try the breading some suggested or top off with more cheese.

This was super easy!  Don't forget to pound the chicken to 1/4 inch thick though.  Some of mine were more chicken "folds" than chicken "rolls" because my breasts were too thick.  I also took the advice of some of the other comments and sprinkled garlic, pepper, and salt on the non-pesto side of the breast.  It was very yummy!  All of the flavors went really well together!

Very good! I didn't actually roll the chicken. Instead I lightly greased my baking dish, placed chicken breast in dish, spooned the pesto onto each breast and sprinkled with mozzarella. I covered my dish with aluminum foil and baked for 20 minutes. Then loosened foil cover, baked 20 minutes more. Finally, removed cover for last 10 minutes for cheese to brown a little. Will definitely make again!

This was really good.  I didn't roll the chicken up, only because it was partially frozen.  I topped it with the pesto and cheese and baked for about 45 minutes, uncovering for the last 10.  I used a pesto recipe also from this site and basil from my garden.  I will definitely make this again.

I added my own spice blend that I use on all meats.  Looked like the picture.  It would be even better wrapped in pancetta.  I served it with chicken and proscuitto tortellni with alfredo sauce.  My husband loved it.  Looks special but is so easy.  I'll be preparing this for company soon.

Very, very yummy and easy! Put salt and pepper on one side of the pounded out chicken breast. On other side, pesto and mozzarella. It was easier than rolling it up and it turned out perfectly after 25 minutes in the oven. I did cover it with foil for the first half of the cooking time, so the mozzarella didn't burn.

Thank you for this recipe! It's one of my husbands favorites. Instead of pounding my chicken breasts I slice them in half so they're thinner. I found it hard to roll the chicken with the thick slices of mozzarella cheese so I shredded it instead. Sometimes I'll dip the chicken in egg and breadcrumbs so the outside is crunchy. Yum!

This recipe was very easy and quick. I did not use quite a 1/4 of a cup of pesto for each piece of chicken as the recipe states, used shredded mozzarella and also took the suggestion of other reviewers and dipped my chicken in egg and then italian breadcrumbs to give it a crispy crust. My husband and I both loved it, the chicken was juicy and tender I will def. be making this again...maybe with sun-dried tomato pesto as alternative.

Super EASY and very very tasty.  I followed the recipe except I sprinkled salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder on the rolls before baking.  I then baked the chicken for 35 min at 350. Perfect!

Speechless....So incredibly good!!! This will be going in my permanent recipe box!! The only substitution I made was shredded cheese instead of sliced and I rolled the chicken in bread crumbs before baking them.

Wow! Everyone loved it. Like another reviewer, I ended up cutting the breasts in half after I pounded them out and "sandwiching" them together with the pesto and cheese. I then dipped them in italian seasoned bread crumbs and baked 35-40 minutes. They were juicy and delicious! Thank you for a great recipe...will definitely be on my recipe rotation.

Loved these!  Even the kids did after they got over the "green."  I sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also took the advice of others and baked it covered for the first 20 minutes.  I served them with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes and green beans.  I will definitely make this again.

I have been trying a lot of new recipes lately. This is one that my husband wanted me to try. It came out pretty good, but I did change it a bit. I used thin sliced chicken breast. I added garlic salt and pepper. Made a pesto sauce myself and added basil. I added a thin slice of mozzarella to the top of each roll. Covered it for the first 20 minutes and removed the foil after allowing to brown. It came out really good, my husband really enjoyed it. Good recipe!

They are good! 30 minutes of cooking would have been good though. I followed the directions and way overcooked mine so they were dry.

This was very simple and easy to prepare. My kids enjoyed it and picking up only four ingredients is a snap.  I didn’t make any modifications to this recipe but I see that others have some good suggestions.

A new family favorite! I used my homemade Pesto, and I also added grated Parmesan Cheese on top and baked for 35 minutes, then put it on low broil for an additional 5 minutes to brown it up a little more. I served it atop Lemon Pepper Pasta from Jane S., also from this site and a nice mixed greens salad. It was delicious! My son who is very picky loved it! Thanks, Chompy! I am going to upload a photo too!

This was easy. Made it with my own pesto . However I felt 50 min at 350 was too long and it would come out dry. Thank goodness I only cooked it 29-30 min. because it wasn't quite dry. Maybe the very ends were, but the rest were good.

This simple dish is just bursting with flavor!  I made my own pesto (from this site) and used the tiny bit left over to spread over a fresh baguette with dinner.  We also had whole wheat pasta with tomato/zucchini sauce, and broccoli.  We made Ginger Lemonade (from this site) too.  The only change I made was to use Provolone instead of mozz.  I had it on hand, and I think the flavor is better with this dish anyway.  It was delish!

Fantastic, and so easy! I make my pesto in large batches, vaccum seal it, and then freeze it, so this is a super easy dinner for us.

Pretty good.  I added some seasonings to pep it up a bit (pepper, parsley and a little garlic salt).  They look beautiful!

Great.  My husband loved it.  I did only cook it for 30 minutes though, and used the thermometer.  I did add a slice of mozzarella on the top because most of the cheese had melted out.

Pretty good, though the mozzarella cheese became a little too hard and rubbery. But, it was a very quick weeknight meal. Next time I would put the cheese on halfway through cooking instead of beforehand.

Maybe it was the pesto I used, or maybe I'm just not a pesto fan.. But I didn't really like this that much. I would've given it a 3, but my dad loved it and said it was restaurant quality.

My family loved this. I did as another reviewer suggested and paired this with the pan-fried asparagus and brown rice with lime sorbet for dessert. I did put pesto sauce on the top of the chicken and cooked it for 30 minutes @ 400 degrees.

Delicious! I've made this with the mozzarella and another time with shredded parmesan. I also add more pesto sauce on top of the rolls, so they don't dry out. I've been making this over and over ever since I discovered it!

I made the mistake of using boneless SKINLESS chicken breasts the first time. I followed the suggestions on the site, salt & pepper, bake covered for 20 m at 375 and uncover, baste with the juices in the pan and finish up uncovered with more cheese on top. That turned out good! But then I made it again with skin-on exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was good, too! Either way, we really like it. Thanks for the recipe.

Really, this was very good! Apart from using thighs instead of breasts, I made the recipe pretty much as written. I'm glad I did. I now have another good recipe for chicken. I would, however, make a few suggestions. (1) Use a thermometer instead of the 45-50 minutes bake time called for. My chicken was done in 30 minutes. (2) Take extra time to pin the rolled up chicken tightly, otherwise the cheese and pesto will run out as the cheese melts. (3) For the last few minutes of cooking, place some cheese on top of the chicken and let it brown under the broiler.  (4) Let the chicken rest before cutting, so as to keep the cheese and sauce inside the roll. (5) Don't be afraid of a little salt and pepper. It does wonders. THANKS, CHOMPY!

Recipe was delicious. I added some rosemary and garlic seasoning on top with some grated parmesan cheese which I think added to the flavor but it was yummy just as it was in the instructions.

First time trying this, using what was in the house, used a jarred red pepper and cheese pesto like spread instead of pesto; swiss cheese slices; topped 2nd layer with fresh thin sliced tomatoes, planko bread crumbs, and thin coating of the red pepper spread; and increased temp to 500 during an added 10 minute browning.  FANTASTIC!

I give this a 4 star for now although I'm going to try it again and I'm sure it will 5 star!  I made my own fresh basil pesto with extra garlic and salt & pepper as well as fresh parmesan.  It was excellent.  What I will change next time:  will brown the chicken before baking and then cover while baking.  Without browning before baking, it didn't brown well so I had to broil it for 5 mins or so to make it presentable.  This contributed to a bit of dryness but not bad at all.  My husband loved it.  Yumm!

This has become a go-to recipe in our house! It is so easy, so pretty, so delicious, and everyone loves it. I usually season the chicken in advance, just a little salt and pepper and maybe a sprinkle of garlic powder. Sometimes the filling oozes out of the chicken into the pan, but that makes for a delicious gravy to put over rice or pasta. YUM.

I used thin sliced chicken breasts, homemade pesto and shredded mozzarella.  Added pepper, salt and garlic powder on top of rolled chicken.  Once rolled I added some white wine, cooked for 15 minutes and covered with tin foil.  Removed from oven and added extra pesto on top and mozzarella cheese and removed tin foil and cooked another 15-18  minutesl.  Came out delicious.  Will make again.

I liked this but made a mistake in trying to combine this with another pesto-stuffed chicken recipe...I neglected to pound the chicken thin and ended up with some REALLY messy rolls.  Tasty combo though; thanks!  I will try again and not attempt to combine recipes again.  Thanks!

I was looking for a decent recipe and I found this. My first attempt wasn't quiet good because by mistake I used too much pesto sauce. But after I reduce it came up a nice, different dish for us to cook once in a while. Thank you for posting this recipe

Amazing! This fool-proof exceptionally easy dinner is a classic that I will be pulling out again and again. My whole family loves it! The only thing that I added was a sprinkle of bread crumbs, because I found that the chicken got really dried out. With the bread crumbs, you can use Italian, panko or regular for different tastes every time!

This was a tasty one but in order to wrap them easy you have to REALLY flatten the chicken. Also I would use less pesto before cooking because when wrapping it oozes out and throw some extra on when serving so you can adjust to each persons liking.

I made this for a family birthday, it was a hit!  I made it just as the recipe is written and it came out perfect! My 85 year old grandparents said they thought they were in a gourmet restaurant!  I will surely make this over and over! And with 3 small children its a breeze to get done! I may try the breadcrumbs next time!

I really loved this, and my husband said I needed to make this again!  I only gave it 4 stars because I did not make it exactly as written, but added some things as suggested by other reviewers.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic before adding the pesto and cheese, and then brushed the rolls in egg and sprinkled panko bread crumbs over them. Delicious!  And so easy!

Excellent. I didn't have mozz. cheese so I added what I had on hand, one was a Mexican melting cheese and the other was a mild cheese with dill, really went well together.

I followed this recipe exactly (except I only had Swiss cheese, not mozzarella)and after the family added salt and pepper they thought the recipe was pretty good. I would have given it 5 stars if the chicken had been seasoned. I think next time I will just put the pesto and cheese on top of the seasoned chicken. One of the other reviewers also mentioned dipping the rolled chicken in egg and bread crumbs which sounds amazing.

I have a similar recipe, I do it the same as recipe, then place them in a casserole dish and pour Bolognaise sauce over them and cheese over top and bake in oven.

Absolutely wonderful! Such a simple recipe, yet outstanding flavor! The only changes I made were to marinade the chicken in Italian dressing & broiled the "rolls" the last 5 min of cooking after brushing the tops w/ egg wash, panko bread crumbs & mozzarella. My changes were simply for personal preference and appearance- w/o the changes it's still a great recipe!

This was good.  I also dipped my chicken in egg and rolled it in bread crumbs prior to baking.  My chicken came out a bit dry but I think that was my fault and not the recipe.  My only regret was that the cheese melted right out of the chicken.  Next time I make this, I may put some pesto and cheese on top.  Would be good with noodles.

Very easy to make - will season the chicken next time and do 375 for less time. Chicken was a little dry after 50 mins at 350. Homemade pesto could be used more generously too!

Try this recipe as is....Then wrap in bacon and barbeque until the bacon is crisp.  Excellent!  I sometimes will add sliced tomatoes or even asparagus.

Very good. I pounded the chicken as thin as I could but it still didn't roll up nicely. I did have to use tootpicks to keep them in the folded-in-half-taco-shape. They were very good though, baked 20 min covered, 10 uncovered at 375. Used shredded cheese and added sundried tomatoes also. Very very good!!

I used sun dried tomatoes in this as well.  Do not use the cooking spray, as the tomatoes and pesto release a boatload of olive oil.  I served this with a side salad, garlic bread and rice.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan of pesto. The chicken was tender and juicy (drizzled with olive oil before baking). I also made cheesy pesto rolls to go along with it. I will definitely be making this again in the future. Oh and it didnt take 45 mins. more like 25

Delicious!  Very easy to prepare, and I used shredded mozzarella since that's what I had.  This was extremely flavorful, and I loved that it only uses 4 ingredients that I always have on hand.  Way to go Chompy, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used feta instead of mozzarella because that's what I had on hand. Also seasoned the chicken and coated in Pistachio-Panko mixture (that I also had on hand in the freezer from a previous recipe), and fried the chicken on the stove before baking. It was pretty good, but not a favorite.

Delish!!! I don't bother with the toothpick. Just roll up with all the goodies inside and bake. I used sun dried tomato pesto instead of the green kind amd I used pepper jack cheese. My family loves this and wanted more.

What a fantastic recipe. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast and fresh pesto. My pesto was stored in oil so the chicken did turn out slightly oily. Next time I will make some fresh pesto and use it immediately so as to avoid having so much oil.

WOW!!! this dish turned out excellent. Even with my picky kids. My wife tells me after every meal that this one was the best. I must say I agree.  For a little twist, add some ricotta, provolone, parmesian and mozzarella cheese in a bowl and mix together (or buy in a bag already). follow directions as normal but instead of tooth picks, use bambo kabob sticks (available at most retailers). hang kabobs over a 9x13 pan open side up (so cheese doesnt just run out).

I made these last night and they were a hit! Simple and easy to make. I used store-bought basil-pesto (available in the pasta sauce aisle). One recommendation: I would cook this dish for about 30 minutes at 350 instead of 45-50 minutes. Great find!

Everyone loved this in my family - even the 9 year old.  The only thing I did change was seasoning the chicken a bit (garlic powder, pepper, salt) as well as doing the egg wash and panko bread crumbs as others suggested.  I served it with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil that I found on this site and a salad.  Will definitely make again!

UN-BE-LIEVABLE GOOD!!! Made this for dinner last night and am still amazed at how tasty it was! And **super easy** too if you skip all the pounding and rolling...LOL!! I did as others suggested: seasoned the chicken breasts, placed them in the greased (Pam) baking dish, then simply spread the pesto over them and topped with thick (1/4 inch) mozzarella slices. Just divine!! My 9 year old loved it as well. This is definitely going to be regular at our house from now on. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

I also did not flatten the breasts - just spooned some pesto over them and then added cheese on top. They baked for about 30 minutes total (20 min covered, 10 min uncovered). The whole family loved it, and I will make it again. It is extremely easy. I even prepared it ahead of time, covered it with foil, and stuck in the fridge until I was ready to bake it. Worked great!

These were great - I didn't bother rolling them though, just pounded the chicken out to 1/2 in thick and then put the pesto and cheese on top.  I baked it covered with tin foil until the last 10 minutes.  Great flavor and texture.

These were very good/very tasty.  One thing I would change is using the thick slices of mozzarella.  These made the 'rolls' difficult to actually roll and not sure that this aspect had any real  influence on the dish.  I think these would work just as well with thinner slices or even shredded cheese; and then they would roll up better.

Good for a special meal, since it's a lot of work to trim, pound out, and roll. I used a lot of toothpicks to keep them together. I dipped mine in egg then dredged through crumbs.

45 minutes is way too long to cook chicken breasts.  I cooked them for 30 minutes and they were still way too dry.

Very good and easy! I did make a few changes though...as most of us do. As per another reviewer, I seasoned one side with garlic salt and basil.. spread the other side with pesto, added chopped sundried tomatoes for color and flavor, and included mozz. and tomato/basil feta prior to rolling it up. Only needed to bake for 35 minutes. But i guess the cooking time depends on your oven and how thin you pound the chicken. Spoon the pan drippings over the roll-ups half way through cooking time and prior to serving to keep them moist. Served it with garden fetuccini alfredo. Turned out great..husband and house guests were impressed. One said it was better than olive garden. Well worth the extra effort to roll them up for a great presentation!

What a fantastic, easy and tasty meal!  I'm always trying to find a new way to make chicken more interesting.  I only had to bake it for 30 minutes.  Dinner was on the table in no time!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and it was very very good!  My husband said he liked it and that it was a definate keeper.  To save myself the trouble of pounding the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch, I bought a pack of the Perdue Fit 'n' Easy thin cut chicken breasts which makes it a lot easier to roll and cooks in less time! (30 minutes at 375 degrees and it turned out excellent.  I served mine with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh string beans.  Great meal. Will do again.

This was a good recipe for something different to try with chicken.  The only thing missing is the advice to seal up the ends of the chicken.  Once it melts a lot of it slides out. It was very tastey though! I'd make it again.

This would have been alot better if the chicken would have been marinaded first. I also added sundried tomatoes with the pesto and it added really good flavor. This was good over pasta

I used provolone cheese.  Family did like it, ate it up, but will add a little salt, pepper, garlic powder next time.  Maybe even a little wine in the baking dish?  So glad to have something new to try, especially for chicken!  Easy, too.

this is a great recipe, I did however modify it a bit because of time constraints. I poured the pesto over the chicken and then laid the cheese on top, however as a suggestion, I would advise you to put the cheese in at the last 5-10 mins of cooking.  ALSO @ DENNA, you could easily find a PESTO recipe online, HOWEVER this recipe did state that you could've used PREPARED/STORE BOUGHT pesto. Try it again, I'm sure you'll like it! :)

This gets 5 stars.  It was so easy to prepare; I did as others suggested and just layered the pesto and cheese on top of the chicken.  The flavor was wonderful, and the house smelled great while it was cooking.  My family loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe, to stop the chicken drying out wrap the outside of the chicken with thin slices of procuitto.  Experiment with the filling & use different flavoured dips, rocket cashew and garlic works well ( I am from Australia).

Based on other reviews, I used the egg wash and bread crumbs.  I left it in until the termometer read 170.  All I can say is YUMMY!  I have tried a few other recipes that turned out good, but this is the first one my husband said was a definite keeper.

These were amazingly good and another recipe to use my homemade pesto in! We used thick slices of cheese and it was a little too much. A lot of it baked out into the pan and didn't stay in the roll. Also, next time I will make my pesto with a little less oil as this also baked out into the pan. Otherwise, this is a great dish that will definitely be made again!

Pretty good. It was a little dry but that might have been the chicken I used. I thought it could have used more filling but overall it's a very safe and easy recipe!

this was excellent !! i used Clssico pesto sauce & provolone chesse. I put the rooled breasts down the middle of my baking dish, then filled in each side with chunky cut carrots tossed in the rest of the pesto , so yummy on the carrots , plus a little chiken broth in the bottom just to keep the chicke from drying,, i did cover with foil for about 40 minutesthen uncovered and added some more cheese acrosss the top of the chicke

This recipe was great.  I made my own pesto and breaded the chicken to help keep the stuffing inside.  Served with a side of broccoli rabe and everyone loved it.

My boyfriend loved this, especially the chessy pesto flavors. I salt and pepper'd the chicken, added a little bit of chicken broth to the bottom on the pan to keep it moist, and then scooped up the juices and poured over the chicken before serving. Very good!

These were pretty good.  I think they need a bit more flavor though.  Next time I will try to add some more spices and maybe a sharper cheese to brighten them up a bit.  Also, you have to make sure you seal the chicken up really well or all the cheese and filling just runs out.

Very good had to add some salt, pepper, & a little garlic powder for seasoning. Also did 2 breasts in Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and that came out great. Cooked for only 30 min and they were perfect. Thanks for a simple yet tasty recipe.

What could be easier, and oh so yummy!  I did roll them in panko (didn't even egg wash) and fried in a pan for just a bit, then popped in the oven to finish.  It's really good left over as well.  Hubby loved this one.

This is the best recipe I've ever used on this site - hands down. Delicious with a capital D. I freaked out at first because I realised when I started cooking that I forgot the toothpicks, but it still came out tasting great. I followed the recipe for the most part - all I did different was I added the step with the breadcrumbs/egg wash and covered the breasts for the first half-hour of baking. The chicken was so tender and tasted amazing with the melted cheese and pesto!! Restuarant quality meal!

Wonderful recipe - easy to make, and it came out great. I put some extra pesto on the top of the chicken before baking it and it turned out great. The cheese inside leaked out a bit but I was able to just put it right back onto the top and it was just as good. A definite hit with my family!

I took others advice and decided not to roll them. I did wrap a piece of prosciutto around each breast, then topped with pesto and cheese. Baked covered initially, then removed foil for last 10 minutes or so to brown cheese. Served with Garlic Parmesan orzo also on this sight. Such a great meal!

After messing with this recipe I was finally able to keep (most) of the cheese inside the roll.  Great taste and good use for the tons of pesto I made last year!

I loved the idea of stuffing chicken with pesto.  But, I took some of the advice from the other readers.  I used the Feta Pesto recipe from this site.  I doubled that recipe.  I stuffed the chicken with pesto, smoked mozzarella, and provolone.  I wrapped it in prosciutto and baked!  It was awesome.  The chicken was so tender.  I took the left over pesto and tossed it with some penne.  It was fabulous together!  My gang couldn't get enough!

I took other reviewers' advice and simply topped the chicken with pesto and cheese and baked for 35 minutes.  Very good served with Pan Fried Asparagus and a butternut squash risotto.

This dish was awesome!  My hubby and I ate all four chicken breasts in one sitting.  The only changes I did, was to dip the chicken in egg and roll in Panko bread crumbs and sprinkle with garlic powder.  I will definitely be making these again and again.

This was pretty good.  I prepared it as suggested by other reviewers, without rolling.  Placed chicken in greased dish, topped with pesto then generous mozarrella sliced.  40 min at 350F. Yummy and easy!  Served with quinoa cooked in chicken broth.

This was a good recipe, but not the best. The chicken came out a tad dry. It was difficult to roll the chicken with the pesto and cheese without all of it coming out, so it probably would have been better if I rolled it better. I'll most likely try it again though

Yummy and moist.  I baked for about 20 minutes.  I added cornbread stuffing to coat.  My boyfriend said it was one of his favorite meals.  I will try it over fettucine and possibly add the roasted red pepper next time like others suggested.

Yummy! I added a few strips of sundried tomato to each of the chicken breasts and sprinkled some oregano and crushed red pepper on top of them for a little extra flavor. These were fantastic (have made them at least half a dozen times now)!

Incredibly good, even having to shortcut it with what I had on hand. No fresh basil in the house so I used dried basil and made a pesto paste (3 tbsp dry basil, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tbsp parmesan, and 1/2 tsp chopped garlic). I seasoned one side of the chicken with Adobo & onion powder and spread the paste on the other side, then layered on some drained diced tomatos and shredded mozzarella. I rolled it, dipped it in egg and lightly breaded it before baking it at the suggested temperature. After about 35 minutes it was juicy perfection that would rival any reastaurant. I can't wait to make it again!

I topped the breasts with my seasoned bread crumb mixture and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Topped them with spaghetti sauce and more mozzarella and returned them to oven for 15 more minutes. They were juicy and tasty! I will make this again.

These were delicious! I made my own simple pesto -- in a food processor, combined 25-30 fresh basil leaves, 1/3 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1 large tsp of garlic and a dash of garlic salt, pepper and Italian breadcrumbs. It made just enough for 4 large chicken breasts. Spread about 2 tablespoons of pesto over each piece and topped with a slice of mozzarella. Secured the rolls with toothpicks, topped with a dollop of pesto and baked in a casserole pan generously coated with olive oil for about 40 minutes. Pulled the chicken out after about 35 minutes and topped with a Parmesan/Romano Cheese blend then baked for another 5-10 minutes. These got rave reviews in my house, thanks again!

We really enjoyed this. Very easy and tasty. I did not do rolls, just layered pesto and cheese on chicken and baked. I think that the leftovers were even better.  Thank you for such a easy and delicious meal.

Wonderful recipe. Flavors go great together and was easy to make. I did exactly what the recipe said other than I topped the rolls with Italian bread crumbs. Will make again! Thanks.

I loved this recipe! I am at the very beginning stages of cooking and this was my 3rd ever dish to make. It was quick, easy, and delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe (no tweaking) and it was a hit. My boyfriend said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's ever tasted!

Simple to make. I pounded the chicken as suggested, and used about 1T pesto on each breast.

I made these for my husband and I tonight and he loved them.  He said they were "perfect" and he is a really picky eater.  I made only a small moderation to the recipe.  After rolling up the chicken with the filling like a jelly roll, I put them into a casserole dish and brushed the tops with olive oil and put a couple tablespoons in the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.  Then I sprinkled them with Italian seasoning and coated tops with panko bread crumbs.  I baked these in my convction oven at 350 for 45 minutes, then put them under the broiler for about 4 minutes until the tops were golden.  I sprinkled a little real grated parmesan reggiano on top as well.  This recipe goes really well with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto recipe on this website.

I was in a hurry to make dinner for my pesto-loving boyfriend so I chose not to stuff the chicken with the pesto and cheese. Instead, I seasoned chicken breasts with garlic salt, pepper, and oregano and seared them in a grill pan. After browning both sides, I placed the breasts in a baking dish and topped each with pesto sauce. In the final minutes of baking, I placed thick slices of mozzarella on each chicken breast and put my oven on broil to melt the cheese. I served this with a side of linguine and steamed broccoli. Fast, simple, and delicious. My boyrfriend gave it two thumbs up!

I just made this last night and it is phenomenally simple and delicious. I followed the recipe except I had only feta cheese on hand and I just dipped my pre-cooked chicken rolls in italian bread crumbs. I did only 3 huge breasts that I had flattened and it did take the entire 45-50 minutes to cook. I kept checking the internal temperature and it took that long to reach 165. My husband RAVED about this dish so it is definitely a keeper!

Instead of pounding the breasts, I simply put the pesto on top of the breasts and then added swiss cheese the last 5-10 mins of cooking.  Outstanding!

These were okay.  I followed a few reviewer recommendations that I thought turned out well.  I seasoned one side with salt and pepper prior to rolling, and dipped the rolls in egg and breadcrumbs prior to baking.  I would definitely cut down the cooking time.  The recipe calls for 45-50 minutes at 350.  I baked them for 35 minutes at 325, and they still seemed a little on the dry side.  Overall they weren't bad, but they didn't really wow anyone.

This was very good and I used a pesto sauce recipe submitted by Sal on this site. I lightened this up a little bit by using shredded part skim mozzarella cheese. I think next time I may try what other reviewers did and not roll the chicken but spread the pesto on and top with cheese. The flavor was great and the chicken stayed very moist. I served it with spaghetti and the same pesto sauce on the side, and a Caesar salad with a Caesar dressing. It all went perfectly together.

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe and added a few of my own ideas (and some from other raters): 1) marinated the chicken with salt, pepper, and red chili pepper, tad bit of lime sauce for 10 minutes 2) topped with easy pesto (from this site), slice of mozzarella cheese and slice of tomato 3) sprinkled with a bit of crushed red pepper and oregano 4) foil covered and baked for 20 mins + 10 mins uncovered= EXCELLENT DISH! will definitely make it again..soon!

I was looking for something different to do with chicken for dinner tonight and this recipe fell in my lap! It was delicious-- I used the pesto recipe from this site, and topped each roll with a tomato slice and extra mozzarella. Great recipe to change up your normal chicken recipe!

Simple recipe for tasty chicken. I took others'suggestion on thinning the chicken to makes the chicken cook faster. I worried that the chicken doesn't have enough favor, so I marinated them with salt and pepper, and a bit of lemon juice for about 20 minutes before I roll them. They came out just perfect!

I thought this was awesome!! I added some chicken seasoning to the inside of the chicken along with extra pesto, then dipped the rolls in egg and crumbs to add more texture, and finally reduced the cooking time to only 25 minutes. They were wonderful, thanks.

Very easy if you leave the chicken breasts flat instead of rolling. I just spooned the basil pesto on & covered with the cheese. Added bread crumbs that others suggested, but won't do that again unless rolling. (to soggy) Next time I'll just add the cheese the last few minutes. I only baked for 30 minutes & that was enough. Juicy, easy & tasted good. I may even tried the dried tomato pesto.

Great recipe.  I sprinkled one side with fresh ground pepper, little salt, and garlic powder.  On the inside I spread pesto and sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese.  Rooled it up, secured with toothpicks.  Sprinkled outside with Italian flavored bread crumbs and a touch of Olive Oil.  Bake time certainly needed to be reduced to about 25 minutes but that most likely varies depending on the thickness of the chicken.  DH loved it and asked if this could be added to our "regular" rotation!

I used the thin-sliced chicken and I probably won't next time.  I also didn't do rolls and just placed a thick piece of mozzerella over the chicken. I baked it for about 30 minutes but not all the cheese melted, although the chicken was definitely done.  I should have made the pieces thinner.  I seasoned one side of the chicken, spread thick pesto on the other side then put the cheese, then olive oil, then unseasoned bread crumbs.  I felt the bread crumbs were necessary for texture!  Otherwise the cheese would have been way too greasy.  I think I put a bit too much pesto on, probably just a thin layer would do.  With the cheese, pesto and bread crumbs, even with the thinner chicken, the meal was very filling.  We had two thin chicken pieces each, so im sure one boneless chicken breast would be more than enough. Overall though it was extremely delicious!  The boy loved it too!  I served it with cooked carrots and green beans seasoned with olive oil, rosemary, thyme and a little lemon pepper.  Boy doesn't even like green beans but had a couple and said he liked the seasoned flavor.

This was pretty good, but if I make it again I would definitely add some pine nuts to the pesto for some added crunch.  Also, I didn't have mozarella on hand so I used Swiss, but I would be sure to stick to mozarella next time because the Swiss didn't have as much substance and seemed to be less flavorful.

These were very simple and tasted great.  I made my own pesto sauce, and instead of pounding the chicken and rolling everything up I simple poured the pesto over trimmed chicken breasts, then sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top.  I also let it marinate in the fridge overnight which kept the chicken nice and juicy.  Thanks!

this was very good. i used the italian breadcrumbs as suggested. the only reason i give it a four is because the pesto didn't really soak into the chicken. maybe i'll marinade it next time. there will be a next time.

I'm sorry.  I thought this was just OK.  I may or may not make it again.  Maybe my hopes for this dish were too high, especially from reading the reviews.  Maybe the chicken should've been marinated in something first - it seemed dry and flavorless, even with the pesto.  Thanks anyway.

I used feta cheese instead of the mozzarella, just because I had some in the fridge and thought it would go well with the pesto. It turned out good, my girls didn't like it but that's no big suprise!

Excellent dish "Chompy"! I was in the grocery store to buy the chicken and saw butterflied pork cutlets on sale and thought why the heck not? I also made my own pesto from this site because the store bought stuff is just too salty. I cut back on the oil in the pesto recipe by half, as I wanted my pesto to have some consistancy to it rather than it being so saucey that it would run out. I had frozen shredded mozzarella and just took off chunks of it from the package. I had no leakage problems, but then again, I brought the sides up first and then rolled forward. I also used a lot of toothpicks. Possibly the frozen cheese helped too. I was so tickled by one reviewers comment about not being happy with the "naked chicken", so I decided to combine bread crumbs with a bit of pesto and place it on top with more cheese. My family loved this recipe so much and I thank you for submitting it!!

This was a great, fast dinner recipe, and I love pesto!  however, it was hard to determine when it was done- and my chicken turned out a little too dry.  It would have gotten 5 stars otherwise!  Since the chicken is pounded thin, I do not think that it needs to cook for the whole time listed.

I really liked it, however the cheese all ran out.  I coated the roll in Italian bread crumbs to keep it moist as suggested.  Good recipe!

This was a good, easy recipe (and my boyfriend loved it).  I, too, made a breadcrumb topping.  In a food processor I combined about 3 slices of whole wheat bread, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspoon of dried basil, and some salt and pepper.  I brushed the rolled chicken with olive oil and patted on the breadcrumbs.  I thought next time I would coat the chicken with dijion mustard (to add more flavor and cut some of the dryness from the breadcrumbs), but my boyfriend said he didn't think it needed it (I did though!).

This was a disappointment. Based on the video and the paleness of the chicken I knew I was going to grill it for some color and flavor.  Even grilled it was underwhelming.  The chicken needs to be seasoned.  I can’t say I’ll try it again.  I did not bread this as others suggested. Maybe that was it?

I took the advice of other reviewers by dipping the rolls in egg & breadcrumbs and baking for only 30 mins (any longer and the chicken would have been dry.)  It was so delicious!  I also used shredded mozzarella because that's what I had on hand but next time I will definitely try fresh slices.  Great with "Orzo and Rice" and "Jacob's Roasted Broccoli" both from this site!

Recipe turned out ok. Nothing special, I must admit. I had huge chicken breasts from Sam's. I sliced in half, and pounded out the breasts very thin. Chicken cab be bland to start with, so I did sprinkle both sides of chicken with S&P. Followed the rest of the recipe. Though I love chicken and pesto, I will not be making this again. Good concept, but I will pass on making this again - even with modifications.

I prepared a fresh basil/garlic/onion basil and used Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella. I rolled the chicken in a seasoning with bread crumbs before baking. I covered with foil for 20 minutes and uncovered the for remainder of time. I ended up serving this with mashed potatoes and gravy and a carrot casserole.

Delicious! I put the flattened chicken breast in McCormick Garlic, Herb, & White Wine marinade for several hours first, and used Barilla Traditional Basil Pesto. Unfortunately, mine are more like boats than rolls, but that is my lack of skill as a cook and not the recipe. Anyway, it tastes fantastic, and my family all  liked it, too.

I'm a vegetarian and I only cook vegan for myself, but I made this for my partner. He loved it. 

I have made a few chicken dishes before, and he says this is the best one. I made fresh pesto with jalapeno, based on another all recipies recipie, and I used vegan "mozzarella" cheese because that's what I had on hand. I only cooked the chicken for 35-40 minutes and it turned out fine inside.

I made these and they were delicious. I first marinated the chicken in Italian dressing to add another level of flavor.  Securing that toothpick was a bit of a challenge with that slippery chicken. I am told of someone who makes these and just bakes them flat , spreading  the pesto on them and the cheese. Cover with foil at the beginning so that the cheese only melts when you remove it.

This was a super-east dish. The only thing I changed was to use shredded mozzarella instead of slices. I had the shredded on hand. It was messy making the pesto, but that's just because I am not a good cook. Otherwise, I made this to the letter. I made  some alfredo ziti noodles and asparagus. Big hit in the house tonight (maybe not to much the asparagus with the teenagers...). I have this stored for future use. It'll be even easier the next time I make it. Yummy.

Delicious!!! Pounded the chicken, topped with basil pesto and shredded mozzarella cheese. Rolled the chicken and secured with a toothpick then dipped in egg then Italian bread crumbs. Halfway through I scooped some of the oil/juices from bottom of pan on top of the chicken. Will make again and again!!

Added fresh spinach,  used grated mozzarella cheese and drizzled olive oil over the breasts prior to baking in the oven.  Make sure to use a good quality pesto for the best flavor. This recipe was easy and delicious! Definitely adding this to my entree list and will be making it regularly!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I made my own pesto and used ball mozarella which I sliced.  They only change I made was to roll the chicken in panko bread crumbs before baking. I made it for a group of friends and they all raved about it and I will definitely make this again.

Pesto and cheese was good, but the chicken was totally bland.  I buttered, salted, and peppered but it was not enough.  Also, cooking for 45 mins. was too long.  The chicken was very dry.  I would probably brown in a skillet next time and reduce cooking time to 25-30 mins.

It's ok. Chicken Cordon Blu is almost the same process and amount of work but a much better recipe. 

It was good but I won't make it again.

Wow, I wasn't expecting it to be so tasty.  The whole family loved it.  Big thumbs up from the 9 year old.  I did use shredded mozzarella as that is what I had.  And I took other reviewers suggestions and dipped it in egg and then put a breadcrumb/parmesan crust on it.  Cooking time took about 25 minutes.

I really like the base concept of this. I felt compelled to put my own spin on it. I only added some garlic powder and Parmesan cheese on top before baking. After baking I added some fresh chopped basil and tomatoes. I look forward to playing with this concept more. I only just read others reviews but I had the same idea of once stuffed and rolled to coat in some Italian panko before baking. This can be a very versatile recipe that I can really play around with.

True it's easy and delish.   I modified it to what I had in my frig.   Chicken breasts fileted by the butcher, jarred pesto and I grated Asiago cheese (what I had on hand). Salt and peppered, placed a pat of butter ontop of the roll and baked as instructed.   I'll make this again for sure and keep with the Asiago cheese.  I am in love with that cheese!

Pretty simple and really yummy. I did substitute  the cheese and used gruyere, and another time I used  swiss raclette. It was desish both times. This might be just the kick Ashley Nealy is looking for! It is now a regular dish in our house.

This was excellent, it was so great I made it a second time but when I made it the second time I put salt & pepper on the raw chicken then put tomato slices & a very small amount of shredded cheese on top then baked it for the 45 minutes.  So if I could I would honestly make this every night

This was just OK.  Perhaps it would be better if the breasts were breaded as suggested by other reviewers.  I won't be making it again. Sorry.

Next time I will brine the chicken first  and not over stuff with the pesto.   I served this with a side of oven roasted red potatoes and asparagus. It was a big hit!

Tasted pretty good. Easy and fast to prepare.  Ensure you use thin chicken breast. I'd recommend first cutting the chicken breast in half, thickness wise, to make it easier to thin out. Be liberal with cheese as some will often come out during cooking. Well worth a try as they come together so quickly. My only complaint would be that they are a little bland compared to other options, but based on prep. time and sides/sauces you could try, I would still recommend these.

Instead of pounding them flat I just butterflied the chicken breasts. Then added a breadcrumb topping. Wonderful, quick and easy dinner.

The chicken was a hit with my dinner guests. I followed the recipe exactly but I did adjust the cooking time. The breasts were punted pretty thinly and didn't need the whole time.

This is my first time using Pesto and it smells delicious.  I used 2T of pesto per chicken breast and shredded mozzarella cheese.  Dipped in beaten egg and coated in Italian seasoned panko crumbs.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Very tasty.

Made a few changes.  Typically don't but was using what I had on hand.  Used sun dried tomato pesto as that is what I had.  Used shredded 6 cheese Italian blend cheese as that is what I had.  Snipped fresh basil onto the chicken prior to the pesto and cheese.  Took another raters advice and basted with the oil and juice from the chicken while cooking.  Served with a bit of pasta on the side with the rest of the juice.  FANTASTIC!  A company dish.

I just put the Pesto on top and sprinkled grated Mozzarella on top. Super easy and delicious! You can also slice Roma tomatoes and put it on top of the pesto then sprinkle the cheese over that! Yummy!

I didn't care for this, which was a shame, because I'm on the (stupid) FODMAP diet and I could adjust it easily for that.  I think the amount of pesto is way too much (and I used very big chicken breasts).  I had to use my homemade pesto, and I'm sure many people would do the same, since many people make pesto, so I don't think that was the problem.  I used plenty of salt and pepper, but they were just kind of boring.  I might try it again coated with breadcrumbs (once I'm off this stupid diet) and use less pesto and maybe some more spices somewhere.  Would probably be better with some sauce, once I figure out how to make a decent sauce with the currently unallowed onions and garlic.

Very good...4 stars because I didn't have time or all ingredients for pesto and followed suggestion for egg wash and seasoned breadcrumb coating. I pounded flat 4 breast, seasoned with salt,pepper,garlic powder. Placed layer of my garden fresh basil leaves then tore up mozzarella string cheese and layer on leaves. Rolled up, toothpicks to secure. Dipped in egg wash, rolled in seasoned bread crumbs with Parmesan cheese. Placed on lined baking sheet then Drizzled melted butter on them. Backed 40-45 min at 375 deg.  Yummy, moist, perfection.

I made it mostly as the recipe calls for, except I dipped the rolled up chicken in Italian breadcrumbs before putting them on olive oil sprayed foil, lightly misting over the chicken again with the spray. Then baking for 20 mins covered, 25-30 mins uncovered. Served on top of thin spaghetti. We'll be making this one again. It's a keeper for sure!

Awesome I followed the reviews and used tenderloins instead and put the topping on top baked them at 350 for about 20 mins. I then uncovered them, and baked them for about 5-10 mins longer.

This was delicious and liked by my entire family. I purchased prepared pesto at my local store and cooked the chicken flat because I was out of toothpicks, and it turned out great. Big taste for little effort.

This was very easy to make with quick prep. I made it exactly to the recipe the first time. Generally I was unimpressed. The amount of pesto was overkill. I don't know how people could handle this much pesto on one chicken breast. My bf liked it but didn't love it.
I made it the second time and made some changes. 
I stuffed the breasts with cheese only. I brushed the pesto (1 tbsp. Per breast) onto the outside of the chicken, squirted some fresh lemon and olive oil on top, and sprinkled grated mozzarella onto the tops.
I also added freshly ground pepper and a pinch of garlic salt to each breast. 
With these alterations the recipe is a real winner! I am giving 3 stars because I needed to alter the recipe for satisfactory results. 

With these changes the recipe will impress. It is an easy recipe and the end result is delicious restaurant style chicken. Tastes so fancy for something so easy!

I served with baked mini gourmet white potatoes with a dallop of sour cream and sauteed whole mushrooms in white wine and crushed garlic.

I made this recipe since I had chicken breast that needed to be cooked and was in a hurry. It was absolutely delicious! ! I did season the breast with garlic salt & pepper and I didn't have time to pound the chicken so I just added the pesto on top of breast and added a good chunk of cheese on top. Turned out wonderful. Definitely a keeper.

Was a huge hit! My hubby loved it. After I read a bunch of reviews I did add a few things which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I also didn't use any of the original measurements. I cut one whole chicken breast in half and added about 2 spoon fulls of pesto and 3 slices of mozzarella on each half then held it together with toothpicks and dipped it in an egg wash with a mix of Parmesan Romano cheese and Italian bread crumbs and salt and pepper and then put it in a sprayed pan, topped it off with a little pat of butter and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 min. Some of the cheese melted out but it was a delicious topping!

Very good, we all enjoyed it. I had smaller pieces of breasts so it only took 25 min. to cook. I will get larger pieces next time as you couldn't add a thicker slice of cheese as it wouldn't roll. Will definitely try again.

Very tasty dish. I made some alterations to the recipe. I prepared the chicken as described but before I popped it into the oven I breaded and fried the chicken in olive oil to get a crispy crust.

This recipe is AWESOME! My only changes are I used Sundried Tomato Pesto instead of regular pesto and shredded mozz cheese instead of slices so they would roll easier.  I also dipped them in egg and rolled them in bread crumbs after they were rolled.  I now call this "Inside-Out Chicken Parm" because that's exactly what it tastes like!

I love dishes that look and taste like something you'd eat at a restaurant.  This is one of those, yet the preparation wasn't too hard. I seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper before adding the basil (my own recipe) and mozzarella, but I followed the recipe otherwise.  In my oven, these were done in just over 40 minutes.  I'll keep this recipe on hand for the next time I'd like to impress company!

Made pesto today, so decided to try this.  Nothing hard about it, substituted in a jalapeño jack cheese for the Mozzarella and served it over mashed potatoes.  Absolutely delicious!!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except for cooking time, the other reviews were right; 35 minutes at 375 was just right, the chicken was perfectly cooked. I served it with asparagus and wild rice which made for a great meal and received compliments from my dad (our biggest food critic).

I made this last night and it was fantastic. I used shredded mozzarella instead of slices and i also brushed the outside of the chicken with more pesto after i rolled them up. Great, easy change of pace for chicken cutlets

Loved this! I seasoned the chicken though (lemon pepper and garlic salt). My friends and family really liked it. I sprinkled shredded mozzarella on top halfway through baking which gave it a nice golden crisp crunch =)

I didn't do them as rolls - just as chicken with pesto and mozzarella, as other users have described. found it bland and boring. will not repeat.

This is a dandy.

The only factor that should be addressed is to find a way to seal up the ends of the rolls so that the internal contents don't leak.

I believe another reviewer suggested a breadcrumb mixture of sorts on each end of each roll before baking; worth a try.

Oh well, I just wait until everyone leaves the kitchen and then I scrape the crispy bits from the pan and scoff them all down by myself.

Yummy!

A friend from work found the recipe and made it and it was delicious. My brother came for a visit and I modified it a bit, layered like lasagna. Used 3 boneless skinless chicken breast and cut lengthwise, flattened out the chicken breast, spread 2TBS of pesto on each, then the mozz. covered with uncooked spinach, then chopped tomatoes mixed with chopped garlic and olive oil and topped with mozz. pesto and chicken and baked uncovered for about the same amount of time as original recipe. Brother loved it!! Thanks Chompy

I was in a hurry when I made this, so I cheated a bit. Instead of pounding it flat, I just butterflied the chicken breast, added the ingredients, the closed it with a few toothpicks. I also added some artichoke hearts and some extra pesto sauce on top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  I may not have had the presentation, but it still tasted delicious! Nice and juicy, not dried at all like some other suggested. It is a great quick recipe that looks and tastes like you slaved in the kitchen all day!

This recipe is so easy and yet so delicious.  I used shredded mozz because that is what I had on hand.  I also followed another reviewers advice and poured a little white wine in pan and baked covered for about a half an hour.  Very tender and juicy but remember you won't get the meat brown with this method of baking.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful! Followed recipe as written, except I seasoned the meat. I took the advice of others and dipped in egg and rolled in Panko. I figured this would keep the chicken from being too dry. It is a keeper. Thank you Chompy!

Wonderful!!!!! I have been making this for a few years my family just loves it. To change things up sometimes I use sundried tomato pesto and provolone cheese. I also have made this covered and refrigerated over night.  We love it both ways.

This was a fantastic recipe. We took a few things from other suggestions and added chopped sun-dried tomatoes and dipped it in breadcrumbs before cooking. We ate it over pasta topped with an Alfredo sauce; rich but delicious.

Sooo good! I followed recommendations and used less pesto, added sun dried tomatoes, and flipped the chicken half way through so the breading would not get soggy. Came out perfect! Thank you!

This sounded like it would be dry so i spritzed on olive oil over the top of chicken pieces... DH had a conference call so it stayed in oven longer... too long probably!  We used some of the drippings to put over the top and that helped, but i think maybe doing half of the cooking covered in aluminum foil would help, then uncovering with a spritz of olive oil and paprika to help it look browned...   Took some to a friend and she said it was wonderful cooked covered half the time... I had trouble getting the edges secured and the cheese came out... I must not be doing it right!  Mine sure didn't look like the picture.

My husband loved this! I never heard of pesto before until my husband told me he wanted pesto pizza. Well I wasn't going to make pizza for awhile, so I hunted for something with pesto in it - your recipe was the winner! Will definitely be making this again!

This was a big surprise hit. I thought it sounded too easy to be good, but figured I would make it anyway. Really delicious. I made it as is, no changes. I do think though it is only as good as your pesto, so better if homemade..

All I can say about this dish is its quick & delicious. Kind of a hard time rolling it but I managed. I think next time I'll waste less time trying to stuff it and just layer the pesto and cheese ontop.

My husband loved it!!  Which if you knew him, says a lot.  I did roll in eggs and bread crumbs, which added even more flavor, only cooked for 35-40 minutes and came out perfect!

I was super excited to try this out and followed suit with some of the other user - added a little salt,pepper and garlic powder and spread the pesto sauce on both sides of the cutlet and wrapped the cheese inside. As someone else noted - maybe wrapping or securing with a toothpick will be a good way to avoid the cheese from oozing out - but oh boy was it delish. I served this with an Uncle Bens 90second rice - the Savory Chicken Rice to be exact with a side of veggies.   I bought prepared pesto and this meal took less than 1 hour to prepare - Hubby gave me the thumbs up! Can't wait to make it again

Yum!  This cooked up so perfect, and had a really nice flavor.  I thought the pound/roll up process was a lot easier than I expected, I had it all together in about 10 minutes.  I used 2% mozzerella, and my cheese didn't ooze out, the cheese didn't get chewy or hard either.  My son was all set to not like it, but he took a bite and loved it.

Very good & easy.  I took other reviewers advise and just covered the chicken w/pesto & I used fresh mozzarella, instead of the slices.  The whole family, even the kids, loved it!

Excellent recipe..our family of five devoured it.  I went with the egg wash and panko bread crumb version.  Served with buttery garlic egg noodles and creamed spinach.  Even the picky toddlers ate it up.  Thanks for the great addition.

Awesome - and easy - added a little fresh chopped spinach and also dipped rolls in egg and then in italian bread crumbs for a nice light breading.  Very, very good.  Would prepare for company for sure.

The pesto I used ended up being way too overpowering.  We used a pesto recipe we had used previously on a roasted chicken and adored but it didn't work well in this one.  I'd be willing to give it a try again if a specific pesto recipe was referenced or included.

Flavor was good but chicken was incredibly dry. All the juice was in the dish! Can't believe no one else had this issue. I followed the recipe exactly. I will try again but will pan sear and cook for less time on top of stove next time.

Another Hit!  In addition to following the given recipe I, also tweaked it.  The basil pesto was wonderful.  I also had some sun-dried tomato pesto and used that in two of the chicken rolls.  I also used panko on half of each variety.  Very simple with little difference in the ingredients, but each one had a different burst of flavor.

This was VERY good. I seasoned the chicken first with season salt and pepper, then I spread the pesto on, added sun dried tomatoes, then the mozzarella cheese and rolled them up. Then I rolled them in Italian bread crumbs and lightly sprayed them with butter flavor crisco. Then I cooked them in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. YUM!

This was delicious!!!! My entire family loved it.  I took the advice of others and dipped it in eggs and covering with bread crumbs.  I also shortend the time to about 35 minutes.   I will certainly add this to our dinner rotation.

This was a great dish! I made a few changes though. I seasoned the chicken with italian seasonings and added sun dried tomotoes inside with fresh basil instead of pesto. I only put two sices of cheese but now wish I would have put 4 like it said. I tied it up with string instead of toothpicks. I served with yellow rice and a caprese salas with left over cheese and basil. Will make again!!!

This wasnt bad but it wasnt great. I followed the directions except that I put some pesto and cheese on top as well. I made this and it was easy, I liked that but while I was eating it, I wasnt looking forward to the next bite. I used jarred basil pesto, maybe that was where I went wrong. It didnt taste bad, I just felt like something was missing.

My family didn't care for it.  They felt 2-3 tablespoons of pesto was too much.  I only had to bake it for 30 minutes.  I may try it again with sun dried tomato pesto (only 1 tablespoon though).

This was nice. It was very easy. I made a slight change. After I rolled the chicken up with the pesto and cheese filling, I rolled the chicken in beaten eggs and then in a breadcrumb and parmesan cheese mixture. It was really good and very simple. Thanks!

Very easy and very good.  I covered in foil for the first 20 minutes, then finished uncovered.  Everyone enjoyed it, even a picky 7-year-old.

Loved it! I purchased the tin chicken breasts from the grocery store, no pounding needed. I also added a little feta on top of the pesto then put on the piece of cheese on and rolled. Mine cooked in 40 minutes. Turned out great, will make again!

My family loved this!  I did the egg wash and breadcrumbs that other reviewers suggested.  Fabulous!  I didn't bake it for the entire time, only about 35 min and it was perfect.

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was use the suggestion of dipping the chicken in egg and then in bread crumbs. Came out perfectly!

This is delicious and so easy if you cheat like I do =)  I used store bought pesto and I didn't roll the chicken up or even flatten it.  I just put the pesto and cheese on top of each breast and it was fantastic.  Thank you for the recipe!

4 stars because I feel this recipe really needs to be coated in bread to be complete, but 5 stars for easiness and taste. In addition to adding the breading, I used shredded cheese. My chicken rolls only took 30min to cook at 375.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs since that what I had...worked well b/c they are easy to roll as is. Used shredded moz b/c again, that's what I had. Def a hit! :) (also, only had to cook for about 30 mins)

This was so easy and delicious!  I made just one the first time.  I pounded a chicken breast flat, smothered it with pesto and topped it with a string cheese divided into 4 pieces (lengthwise).  I then used toothpicks to hold it together and popped it in the oven for the directed amount of time.  I will make this again and again!

I decided to make this because their was only 3 ingredients and I already had the pesto on hand. My boyfriend loves pesto, says I never put enough, so I had a small amount on mine and a lot on his and yet we both thought the pesto over did itself.

This was such a hit with me! I have to eat low carb and any new way to eat chicken is great. I bought a pesto since I have never had it before, and didnt know what it should tase like, and used chicken thighs pounded very very thin. I even made this in my toaster oven and it was great! I love the pesto with chicken!

These were good buy I wasn't amazed by them. Wouldve liked more of a basil taste. Perhaps it was the pesto I used. Will probably try recipe again.

I used boneless skinless chicken and this created chicken that was way to dry.  Perhaps using skin-on chicken would be best.  I don't eat skin so this just doesn't look like the recipe for me.

These were very good.  I used a lower fat mozzerella and it doesn't bake well - very chewy.  I would used a regular mozzerella next time.  The cooking time on this recipe is MUCH too long. I used about 20-30 minutes and they were perfect.  I also dipped the breasts in egg whites and coated with bread crumbs.  Yummy and fast.  Bes sure to secure the sides tightly after rolling or you may get an ooey, gooey mess.  Will make again.

These were really good, especially for how simple they are.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I took the advice of another reviewer and coated in egg and bread crumbs.  It made a nice brown crust.  Next time I will add some salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.  The chicken definitely needed a little salt.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit. I added some chicken broth to the casserole dish and put pesto on top of the chicken. I think this summer I will do this recipe with tomato's from the garden. Great recipe!

I made this for a big family dinner tonight and everyone loved it.  I did sprinkle some seasoned bread crumbs on the top.  Next time I might do what some other reviews said and just layer the ingredients instead of making them into a roll.  It seems like it would taste the same but be a lot easier.

This recipe came out really good.  I actually followed a suggestion from another reviewer and just baked the chicken with pesto and topped with mozzarella cheese.  I did pair this with Garlic Parmesan Orzo from this site. Awesome!  Thanks!

Very yummy. I was a little apprehensive about the flavors, but the chicken goes very well with the pesto. I didn't want the hassle of rolling the chicken, so I just covered with pesto and cheese, covered pan with foil and baked. Served over pasta with a little left over pesto.

This is so easy and taste so good.  Kind of like a pizza.  I actually cut the chickken in the middle and made a pocket.  I put the cheese and pesto in it and folded over the top.  I did not have to use toothpicks and it stayed in perfect form.  Make extra, great left overs.

These were super easy to prepare eventhough I made my own pesto.  I prepared everything in the afternoon during my son's nap, so about 40 mins before dinner I just popped them in the oven.  I did however tweek the recipe a bit.  To my pesto I added sundried tomatoes and hazelnuts (no pine nuts on hand) and used Babybel swiss cheese in place of the mozz. (none of that either) and also added a tad of fresh rosemary for a kick.  I do not eat meat but my husband said he really enjoyed it...although he didn't have to say anything since his plate was empty in minutes.  Thanks for the simple recipe.

Very filling recipe. Pounded out chicken and used light homemade breadcrumbs on one side. Used 2 tablespoons of pesto per breast, sub'd Havarti cheese (last 10 min), and cooked flat. I have never used pesto in the oven before, so I was unaware how greasy the chicken would be. Still good though.

This is a definate make it again.  I did not pound and roll the chicken, that is too much work.  I poured the pesto over the chicken and then put shreaded cheese over it.  My husband does not like pesto, but loved this!

I'm always looking for new chicken recipe and this one was very easy to make and very tasty!  It looks very impressive too.  This will for sure be made again in our house.

This recipie was a little basic for me. I added to it a lot. First I covered the chicken in pesto, put a slice of mozzerella on it, and then I added a little cooked spinach before rolling and securing w/ the toothpick. I then put a little more pesto around the chicken in the baking dish, added a handfull of halved cherry tomatoes, one thinly sliced shallot and a handfull of pine nuts to the sides. I baked 20 min covered and 25 uncovered. It came out perfect. I served over angel hair pasta. My husband LOVED it and so did I!

This was very tasty.  I salt/peppered the chicken breasts after pounding them and added sundried tomatoes to the pesto/mozz stuffing.  After rolling and securing with a toothpick, I rolled the chicken in seasoned breadcrumbs, though I think it would have been easier to sprinkle breadcrumbs on the top of the rolls after I put them in the pan.  Will definitely make this again.

This turned out really good. I used the thin breast cutlets, so I wouldn't have to pound the chicken, it worked wonderfully. Easy to roll (start with small end), held together nicely. Tasted good! Minus one star because there is a feeling like something is missing, or it needs just a little bit more.

LOVE this recipe! I love pesto so this was great. I seasoned chicken as others suggested with salt, pepper and garlic powder, but next I will only season with pepper and garlic powder...the pesto and cheese had enough salt for my taste. I will be adding this to the monthly rotation.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Love this recipe. Very easy. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and seasoned the chicken breast with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder first. I also covered it in foil for the first 20 min. They still took almost 50 minutes to bake.

Pesto was overwelming for us. I would try it again with just enough for seasoning. The mozzarella was good though.

I was looking for something a little different from the normal chicken recipe.  This recipe is delicious!! I followed the advice of others to make it simple, and placed the chicken in a glass baking dish, smothered in pesto and cheese and baked! It was so easy and so good!

This was very good! I also made the modification that others have suggested and instead of rolling the cheese into the chicken, I instead topped the chicken with pesto & the cheese.  It still tasted good! I served this with egg noodles and used some of the extra juices to season the noodles.  Will definitely make again.

the flavor is great, we did cook it a little too long so it was dry I would be careful with that, maybe cover until the last 10 minutes or so, but this is definitely a dish to make again

Very flavorful!  I sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top, placed the chicken in a little olive oil in the bottom of the pan so it didn't dry out.  Also sprinkled some shredded Parmesan cheese on top at the very end.  I would definitely make this again!

This is quite good and I would make it again.  I overcooked it, slightly, so kind of dry.  I also should have added a lot more pesto.  I gave it a 4 mostly because of the appearance.  I looked really boring on top (white chicken).  Next time, I'll add some bread crumbs and butter or a sprinkle of parmesan and put it under the broiler for a few.  Served with pesto pasta.

I, too, didn't roll the chicken. I used thin chicken breasts and spread freshly made walnut pesto and a couple of spoonfuls of roasted garlic-flavored over the chicken, baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes. Also, I added an ounce or so of dry white wine to the dish after it was in the over for about 10 minutes. It was liquid-y when I added the mozzarella, but the liquid had reduced when I took it out of the oven. My husband (picky) really liked this dish, and I thought it was different and worth making again.

Great recipe! I didn't have a meat pounder so instead I put the chicken breast in a baking dish and put 2-3 tablespoons of pesto on top of the chicken. Then I baked it uncovered for 20 min at 175 C. Then I put the cheese on top and cooked for another 3 min. Fantastic Flavor!

This is an awesome change from the normal, boring chicken dinner.  I wasn't sure how the texture and taste would come out, so I made mine with small, thin breast cutlets just to try it.  Because of their size, they didn't need to be pounded thin, but they *were* difficult to roll up and very messy to assemble.  The taste is SPOT ON, however; I used Buitoni's basil pasta and skim mozzarella and the flavors were fantastic.  Also, to tie the chicken in with my ziti pasta side dish, I ladled marinara over the top of the chicken.  You have to try it!  The sauce really made it special.  I'm totally making this with full sized chicken breasts next time.

I wish I had more pesto... I used Alessi's super duke nukem concentrated Pesto, so just spread a very thin layer (barely had any left).  Shredded Mozz cheese.  Prior to this, I let the chicken defrost in a pool of EVOO and Penzey's Italian Herb seasoning.   I'll make this again, only have normal pesto, instead of a teeny tiny bit of the uber-concentrated stuff.

I pounded the chicken, but didn't roll them - just topped them with Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto (easy recipe from this site) and mozzarella.  The final dish was screaming for something more (presentation & taste) so I topped them with chopped tomatoes.  It was beautiful, comapany-worthy, and without any prompting even my 12 yr old said he really liked it.

This is an easy delicious recipe - definitely give it a try.  It's become a regular at our house.  The only thing I've changed is I use asiago cheese instead of the mozz. but either cheese is good - it's just my preference...great recipe!

Super easy to make, but not very impressed. The breast were just too thick, even after flattening. Would use tenderloins next time. I would marinate the chicken in the pesto, too. The pesto inside just wasn't enough taste for me.

This was really really good chicken. I had some of my friend's leftover homemade pesto to used up.  I seasoned the outside of the chicken with salt/pepper, and the inside just the pesto and thin pieces of fresh mozzarella (the kind in water).  I also baked it for maybe 30 minutes.   ALOT of oilve oil from the pesto/cheese came out of the chicken, but I basted it over the chicken every 10 minutes.  The result was EXTREMELY moist and flavourful chicken.  My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had.  I don't like chicken, and I thought it was moist and flavourful.  10++++

This is a great recipe! Our family, which includes younger children, gobbled this dish up and begged for more. I didn't have any prepared pesto sauce, so I used Gourmet Garden's Basil Herb Blend. It's basically chopped basil in a squeezable tube. In addition, I sprinkled salt and pepper on the basil side of the chicken. I also used a shredded Italian cheese blend instead of sliced mozzarella cheese. This is a keeper recipe!! Thank you for sharing it!

5 stars because this is so incredibly easy yet tastes like something you spent a long time making. We will be making this again and again I'm sure.

The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star is because I altered it. But, I only did a couple minor adjustments & it turned out great. I had bought sun dried tomato & basil pesto & was trying to figure out what to do with it. I sliced my chicken breast in half (length wise) instead of rolling them, coated them with Italian bread crumbs, & then sandwiched the pesto & cheese in the middle of the two slices of chicken. Cooked for written time on recipe but covered it until last 10 minutes. I sprinkled a bit more cheese & some parm on top those last 10 minutes. We all enjoyed & my boyfriends nine year old kept commenting on how good it was.

I made this using the "Pesto" recipes from this site and I am very, very pleased. But I adore pesto, so I may be an easy sell. Nonetheless, very tasty.

Good easy recipe. I used cheddar cheese because I had no mozzarella. Perhaps I used too much pesto, my only complaint was that it seemed a tad oily. Maybe some spinach or other green vegetable to cut the oil a bit would help.

I did the 20 min foil bake method for this recipe. The result weren't bad but not impressive. Next time I made this dish, I will add a little garlic and sun dried to add some extra flavor.

This was great and easy!  I took other reviewers' advice and just spread pesto over the chicken breasts, topped with the cheese, baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15 mins.  Came out perfect.  We love pesto.

Yum, Yum, Yum!!!!  Tender, moist, flavorful.  I used the thin sliced chicken breast from the store stuffed and topped with extra pesto and cheese on each piece.  Definitely making again, the kids ate all the leftovers!

I have to say this was one of the most easy dishes I have made to date. I cut the chicken breast in half and did not pound it(although next time I will see if it makes a difference). I then marinated the chicken with sherry, salt, pepper and McCormick's Grill Mates® Lemon Pepper with Herbs Seasoning. I let it marinade for half an hour. Then I prepared as noted and sprinkled mozzerella cheese on top f the chicken with some garlic. I also followed what other users said in baking the chicken coverered for 20 minutes and then uncovering for 10-15 minutes. Make sure you have the tooth picks! As a side dish I used the Lemon Pepper Pasta recipe on this site(also recommended by other users) but doubled the recipe/sauce only. It was a nice, light combination with this chicken. All in all, my husband and his son loved it and said it was better than what we had for dinner at the restaurant we went to the night before. Divine! Will make again and again.

I loved this recipe! Everyone in my house loved it too!!! I made my own fresh pesto with a recipe I found here online. I also added various cheeses to the inside. Provolone and Swiss. I used another user's idea to cover the rolls with italian bread crumbs before baking.

We used sharp provolone cheese instead of the mozzarella but that's the only change we made.  My husband and I loved it!!  We'll definitely be making it again.

I made these last night and they were wonderful!  I made some modifications after reading all the reviews and we both loved them and will definitely eat again.  I used Muenster cheese because I had it on hand and substituted thin-cut chicken breasts, which were already thin enough to roll up and didn’t require any extra pounding.  Then I dipped each roll in an egg/milk mixture and coated in Italian bread crumbs.  I baked them at 375 for 30 minutes and they were absolute perfection.

This recipe couldn't be any easier!  I just seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, then spread some homemade pesto on the chicken and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.  Baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes until the cheese was golden brown.  I think you could do a lot with this recipe, like add roasted red peppers to the chicken, or sliced tomato, or thinly sliced ham.  The possibilities are endless.

Easy, delicious and fast!  Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper and fresh minced garlic after pounding. Did not roll but layered with pesto sauce. Baked covered in 375F oven for 20minutes, then uncovered topped with cheese and heated aprox 5 minutes until cheese melted. This is one of favorites! Many thanks!

The taste was quite wonderful. Most of the cheese kind-of ends up in the pan, but we just scooped it out with a spoon and placed it on top. The only reason I gave it a 4 is the chicken was too dry, I would cut five minutes off the bake time next time.

Tasty! We added breadcrumbs to the top before baking for crunch. Would have added sun dried tomatoes inside as well if we had them on hand.

Husband loved this! (7 year old who is pretty adventurous didn't but .. one never knows day to day !) The husband liking it so much surprised me because in general he does not care for casserol-y type recipes.  He has know asked me 4 times what was in it .. and how good it was. ! made a few mods: Used bagged cheese instead of a piece. Used a combo of swiss, mozorella and cheddar. Mixed up some mayo and lemon juice and poured it over top. (It look like it needed a little sauce) Easy ! Good taste!  Moist! Two thumbs up!

I did follow the advise of others and first seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Then added the pesto and cheese.  I just folded the chicken in half instead of rolling it.  It was delicious!!  I will make this again.

This was very good!  I added more pesto and cheese on top... to much pesto!  But over all, very tasty.  I only needed to cook mine for 30 minutes.

This was great! It sounds like a lot of work, but it really isn't. The pesto and mozzarella cheese are great together.

I loveed it.  I wish my husband was a bigger fan of pesto because I would make it more often.  In addition to the rolling the chicken in the pesto and cheese, I also top mine with the pesto and cheese.

I'm a new pesto lover so I really liked this. I used 1 1/2 slices of meunster cheese per roll and baked the 45 minutes @ 350. It was a tad dry so next time (and there will be a next time) I'll try the higher temp for shorter time that someone recommended to see if that will allow the rolls to stay moist. May even do the majority of the cooking covered and uncover the last 10 to 15 minutes to brown. Yum!

I happened to have smaller pieces of chicken, so I made about 7 mini-rolls. I thought the outside might be a little naked and boring so I added a little bit of pesto on top while baking. I also put a small piece of cheese on top for the last 5 minutes. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. I was pleasantly suprised as I am NOT a very good cook, I have a terrible time with grilled cheese! But that's a different story... I served it with some garlic mashed potatoes (from scratch and with out a recipe, I was proud of myself!) and some asparagus.

This was a very good recipe.  Next time I might try adding a tomato sauce over the top, or some sort of basting sauce.  It seemed dry on the top.

this was okay.  I was going to bread the chicken, based on a prior review, however the chicken would not stay together.  So i sprinkled bread crumbs on top of the chicken with garlic powder.  all my cheese melted out the chicken.
