Interesting twist on a fruit salad - it's kind of like prosciutto and melon (which is very good!).  I liked this but opted to omit the bacon and reduced the amount of dressing - I used 2-3T and it was plenty.  As I suspected the bananas didn't hold up and I would probably leave those out next time.

Maybe I am not a poppy seed dressing lover.  It all sounded good but the dressing made everything "slimey" with a "I don't like this taste" flavor.  Bacon, onions and cantaloupes were great together, though.

Certainly not something that I would have thought of myself, but the sweet, salty and savory flavors really do work! I used a raspberry dressing for this and it was delicious. Thanks!

This was a wonderful salad. I sprinkled the bacon and onions on each plate so any leftover wouldn't get soggy.  A keeper for sure!

This is a terrific salad! Easy to make and yummy.  I really like the combination of sweet and savoury tastes.  I think prosciutto would be nice instead of the bacon when you don't feel like frying.  In my small town I had trouble finding poppy seed dressing.  I eventually found one by Renee's, which was good.  The only other offering was Kraft Creamy Poppyseed, which looked a bit too creamy for this.  I'd be interested to know what other people used.
Great recipe Donna!

I make this all the time in the summer - everyone loves it.  We're vegetarian, so I use vegetarian strips (Stripples or Morningstar Farm breakfast strips - put them in the oven until they're crispy, but watch that they don't burn) instead of bacon.
