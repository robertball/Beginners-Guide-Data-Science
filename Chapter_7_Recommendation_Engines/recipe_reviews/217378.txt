A really excellent recipe.  I was skeptical about the basalmic but it really worked.  My only addition was a splash of red wine at the end.  Delicious a definite keeper.

Best Bolognese I've made!!  The bacon was SO good in this, and even though totally unhealthy I loved how you drain none of the bacon grease!  It made this so, well, bacony ;)  I used some frozen tomatoes from my garden last spring and just added a small can of tomato sauce to make it a little saucier.  My daughter had seconds which is HIGHLY unusual.  Great recipe....thanks!

Not bad! I've been searching for a decent bolognese sauce for some time now. While not "knock your socks off good," this was by far the best bolognese I've ever made. I pretty much followed stefy's directions to the letter except for subbing meatloaf mix (i.e. ground beef, veal & pork) for plain 'ol beef. My grocer usually doesn't stock this, but tonight I was in luck. :) I am really glad I was able to make an authentic bolognese and think it was worth the extra cost to do so. Served with garlic & butter dinner rolls and Caesar salad, this was a very hearty meal. Thanks for sharing your grandfather's recipe, stefychefy! :-)

This was an awesome dinner for my family. I made it a little differently though.  We used  whole wheat pene pasta instead of spaghetti  and added 1/2 cup of red wine  as well as the balsamic vinegar.  Our choice of meat was ground Italian sausage which made the flavor profile deep and  rich with comforting goodness. A must save recipe.

This is the best bolognese EVER! 
I didn't even have all the ingredients (I didn't have carrots and celery, so I added bell peppers and cubanela pepper instead... not that they have much in common :P), and even so it came out delicious! 

The amount of bacon is just right: it tastes "bacony", but it doesn't disguise the rest of the flavors. 

The balsamic gives a great touch!

I used leftovers to make lasagna, and it was another hit! From now on, this will be my bolognese and lasagna meat (or meat sauce) recipe.

Wonderful Recipe !  I didn't have bacon, so I replaced it with diced turkey pastrami. Used turkey/pork sausage in place of hamburger and it was a fabulous dinner !  Thanks so much :)

Too little of everything, and needs more time simmering the sauce. This recipe is okay for 6 people, but not for 8.  I used less tomato paste and no bacon.

You need to let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, or the sauce will really not get it's full flavor. But altered, it was pretty delicious.

I will NEVER EVER make another bolognese sauce again - this one was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! I added a pound of ground Italian sausage, aside the ground beef called for (we like it meaty). I  cooked the sauce at a low heat for 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. I also used low sodium crushed tomatoes and the basil called for but I added another 2 tbsp fresh basil after the 1.5 hrs of simmering  - the flavor was delicious.

I’ve made it twice now and every time it turns out really good; it seems like a lot of work but it’s not.  And if I have any leftover spaghetti sauce -I had a little bit this time- I just throw it in with it.  Used store-bought Italian meatballs.   I think the amount of spices is what makes it so good.

This turned out fantastic! Hubby loved it as I haven't heard a peep as he horfed down his plate. So, thumbs way up on that one.... I did have to make some minor tweaks tho: 1. Didnt have tomato paste,  subbed about 3/4 of a jar of plain spaghetti sauce (Bertolli tomato basil), 2. didnt have fresh basil  (used dried),  Had a balsamic variant (pomegranate) and used sirloin ground beef. Did it say too?? I dont remember... in any case, always better to upgrade on the beef... Will be making this one again! ??

This is a very homey recipe.  You really don't need to add the paste or sugar.  I've always like it with sugar but my husband (an Italian, would go nuts, lol)  I think its very good either way.  reminds me very much of my late husband and the battles we had over the sugar or no sugar.  Either way the basic recipe is fantastic

Love this recipe so much! The only changes I make are adding a few bay leaves when the balsamic vinegar goes in, and also I simmer it for at least 15 minutes at the end! If it’s just brought to the boil then removed from heat there is a lot of liquid and the flavours haven’t bound together.

"Oh dear"....  I do not see what nearly everyone else does!  Don't get me wrong it was okay but not great. It seemed more like a quick and easy meat sauce than Bolognese.  Made it as written but wasn't crazy about the bacon or the balsamic vinegar.  Will not be making it again.

This is an amazing recipe. I just made it for my Italian class and they loved it and I'm hoping to make it for our cook off in May.  I'm 16 and a beginner in the kitchen and it is real easy to make. I suggest it for everyone

First time making Bolognese sauce and I think it turned out great (considering I only have what I made to go on). But judging the ingredients, it was full of flavor and very comforting. I took one reviewers advice by letting it simmer longer than needed and I think that turned out to be the best decision. Only omissions were the bacon since I did not have any on hand and the white sugar since I never stock it. I decided to go with the natural sugars from the tomato on this one. I'm sure that would have given it even more flavor, but  I'm definitely satisfied with how it turned out! Will made this again for myself or a quick dinner for friends.

Made a double batch with venison. Rave reviews all around.  The prep for chopping the veggies was the longest task, so I did those the night before. Added a few shakes of Worstershire sauce after  the salt and pepper. Fabulous.

I love this recipe. I made it for my fiancee's mother the first time I met her, I firmly believe it's one of the reasons she likes me today.

Growing up as a kid the only thing I ever wanted to eat was spaghetti - so I'm pretty picky when it comes to sauces. I like this recipe a lot. Use it more than any other. Thanks

I had been looking for a run of the mill spaghetti sauce, and this recipe exceeded... easy.  I did grate my carrot instead of finely chopping.    This was a delicious dinner, and I would make again... probably without the carrot and the bacon, only because... I'm a slacker :P  I want to get'er done :D  Oh, and also, I did sub the wine for the vinegar because that is what I had on hand.  the aroma was delightful!  

Try it :)  I don't know how this could be watery because mine sure wasn't, and the seasoning was great :)  (and no, I do not even know the OP )

This sauce has far too much liquid and not enough simmering. Otherwise it's not bad.

Loved this recipe! I still added the red wine at the end though and it gave it such a deep flavour. Would definitely recommend. x

I've tried to make homemade sauce before without much success, but this sauce was easy, toothsome, and a keeper! I was dubious about the bacon, celery and balsamic, but those worked out wonderfully. Am about to make this again right now!

In order to stay on my no carb diet I substituted spaghetti squash steamed in microwave for 10 mins. for noodles and did ground chicken with a little chicken stock instead of beef. It was amazing. And just as satisfying as real pasta. And I'm a pasta fanatic!

I wish I could give this a 2.5. We ate it. It was hot and it was over pasta, which made it good for a winter's evening. But this sauce tastes predominantly of canned tomatoes. In fact, it really doesn't taste much at all like the Bolognese I've had in restaurants. We won't be making this again. I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent.. I used the opion of wine rather thn vinegar.  And I slow cooked th finished sauce for 3-4 hours using beef broth(and a littl more dry red wine)  to thin as needed. I tasted the sauce at the point the recipe was complete and i think the slow cooking further improved a good sauce. I think the beef broth made it heartier with more complex flavor.

An excellent recipe by following the steps is a sure win to a novice cook like me. Made some adjustment by adding both balsamic vinegar & Red cooking wine and chopped rosemary leaves just before serving to give that flavour. Best to let in 'rest' for about 1 hour to allow the meat flavour to blend into the sauce. Serve this to my in law relatives and they gave a Thumb up!

A little too sweet for me. I had to add a little vinegar to balance it out. Next time I make this, I will taste it before adding the sugar. I might add only 1 teaspoon of sugar or maybe none at all. Otherwise, I still give this recipe maximum stars because it was absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it and are asking for it again. It's a keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't add the bacon and only had diced tomatoes, which I just blended up to give more of a sauce texture. I didn't have any celery to add and forgot about the balsamic vinegar.

Filling satisfying exactly what you want from this dish. Went down well at work and everyone went back for seconds. Perhaps it was a bit light on the seasoning as a little bland for my personal tastes.

Fantastic sauce! I cooked mine for a couple hours because I also added some white wine for another depth of flavor. It's such an easy, fun recipe and tastes absolutely wonderful. We'll have this again and again.

I used ground chicken, whole wheat pasta, and a quarter cup of wine instead of the balsamic, and it turned out so yummy.

This was a delicious recipe! I made the following changes: I omitted the bacon, and added 1 can of beef stock. I simmered the bolognese sauce for 2 hours on low heat, so that it got nice and thick and reduced. I replaced basil & oregano with a healthy dose of cut rosemary.

this was average.  I think I may not be bolognese sauce lover, so I might be biased.  If you love bolognese, you will probably like this.  I prefer my pasta sauce w/o bacon...it made it feel greasy and unhealthy.
