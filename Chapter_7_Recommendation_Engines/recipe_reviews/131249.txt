I haven't tried this recipe either, but I didn't think it was fair for someone to leave a 1 star review when they didn't try it, just because the recipe calls for raw eggs. The fact is, the chance of getting salmonella from eating raw eggs is 1 in 30,000. And actually, in a healthy human body, salmonella can't do any harm. Most of us have some small amount of salmonella introduced into our systems all the time. In a healthy body the salmonella is controlled and killed by healthy intestinal flora in the gut.

It's a shame people don't get their facts straight before posting a review of an untried recipe, leaving 1 star and ruining the overall rating.

Happy Holidays (and try not to drink 30,000 eggs-worth of eggnog)!! :o)

This is the best eggnog I have ever tasted. It really does need to age the full 10 days. I had made some and sent some with my husband to his New Years Eve party for work the eggnog was at 7 days, it was good but at 10 days it was great!!! I already have set the date to make it next year for both Christmas and New Years.

Save yourself some time and just make a double batch to begin with.  Put 1/2 out for guests; hide the other 1/2 for yourself.  When I offered this to my guests on Christmas Eve, the whole batch disappeared before I even had dinner on the table.  It's fabulous!

Very nice eggnog.  Anyone who had a bad batch failed in sanitary pracictices in the kitchen.  Those concerned with Salmonella would do well to watch the Science Friday test of Rockefeller University Eggnog test.  They showed that if their batch were mellowed for over 3 weeks it was bacteria free, even though they had added Salmonella to the egge at the start of the experiment, longer aging could be the key to good health as well as good taste.

Oh, this is one great recipe!!  I totally agree with another reviewer:  Use spiced rum!!!  It makes such a difference!  I'm an egg nog junkie.  I make this all year round.  And thicker IS better.  This is extremely refreshing when it's hot -- and do not be misery about the ice cream.  The richer, the better.  Also, I have a gelato machine -- and this egg nog is heavenly when it's frozen!!  I urge any egg nog lover not to reserve this recipe just for Yule.  Make it year-round, and no one will criticize you.  (I served this during a great Fourth of July BBQ party, and this was the first beverage that disappeared.  I was ordered that next year, I'd better make a triple batch or else!)

This eggnog was an incredible hit at our christmas party.  I made it with raw cream and raw milk, and the result was irresistable... even lactose intolerant people said they had no problems with this eggnog.  It tasted like Bailey's Irish Cream... only better! Much better! It is great as soon as you make it, but it gets smoother the longer you allow it to sit.  I made more right away for just my husband and I.  Merry Merry Christmas!

This recipe is awesome. I had to make an extra batch because my friends loved it so much. I now live in England where, believe it or not, they are not as accustomed to eggnog as Americans. They thought it was amazing!!! And guess what, none of the more than 3 dozen people who enjoyed it with me got sick in any way whatsoever! We now live in a fear driven society, and so some of us therefore miss out on so much great stuff!!

My first time ever making egg nogg. Made it for my very first holiday party and will continue to make it for years to come. Used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. I got so many great comments and the batch was perfect for about 40 adults.

I have made this twice and it is delicious.  You MUST wait the 10 days for it to mellow and it is still "stiff" but tastes delicious.

I've been making this recipe for many Christmases now and every year, I have to make a bigger batch. Even people that claim to hate eggnog, or hate liquor, love this stuff. In fact, I just got my first request for it this season!

I just made this today after reading many different recipes over the past week. It was a joy to make and the little test taste I took was good, I will update after Christmas (2 weeks) when we drink it!

I made this last Christmas and just finished mixing up another batch. It is EXCELLENT! It's going to be difficult waiting 10 days (ok I won't be able to wait that long). It is so smooth and delicious. So very happy to find this recipe.

Is it weird that I feel patriotic drinking this? And the amount of alcohol in the recipe really says something about our founding fathers. Anyway, awesome concoction! Instead of using 2 one-gallon milk jugs I let my batch brew in a large stock pot. It was a little harder to shake, but it did the trick.

We followed the recipe exactly, but what came out of the fridge for our party smelled of rotten egg and was horrendously unpalatable.  I'll not be trying this one again.

Smooth flavors; the liquors seem to quite disappear in all that luscious cream and milk, and except for the whiff of brandy and sherry (the two scents most discernible to me), one might be lead to believe that there was no alcohol at all.  If anything, this eggnog is a tad too milky for me, hence the 4 star rating.

Make this every thanksgiving for Christmas consumption. Found an early version of this propertied to be G Washington which included the phrase, "taste often". Great advice that I follow. Always triple recipe to get all Brandy in and use a huge Stock pot. 
No-one that tries this doesn't have more! Do not put nutmeg in the pot, just in the cup. I tried putting it in the pot whilst it was sitting, and it made the mixture bitter.

I did not follow this exact recipe but it is identical, except for the alcohol types, to our family recipe that I learned from my grandfather. I tend to like rum and/or brandy but I have never used the sherry and do not care for whiskey as much. The effect of the curing, if you put the alcohols in, is that after 5 days the bacteria that might have existed have been killed and over time the alcohol cooks the egg and dairy proteins, changing them into a smooth, thick and frothy (from all the beating) indulgence. I like to let mine cure with a little cinnamon, fresh nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves actually mixed in then top with a sprinkle of fresh ground nutmeg when served. 

I have seen other recipes where it is cured with cinnamon stick, vanilla bean and a little fresh ground nutmeg. The cinnamon stick and vanilla bean can then be easily removed when serving having already imparted their flavors. We have broken open jars of cured eggnog a couple months after the holidays to find them wonderful treats but have never managed to be able to save them longer than that as it is just too good to leave alone.

Even with all the alcohol in it, I imagine that something could go wrong during the curing process—though it never has for me so far—and if you open a jar of cured eggnog that seems off or has a bad smell then it is wise to not partake of that batch. With canning, pickling, and curing food products you should always be aware of the possibility that the process can go bad.

Don't skimp on the sitting time!  The longer you let it sit, the smoother it is.  I've tried serving this after one week, 10 days, and 2 weeks.  After 1 week, the alcohol still has a bit of a bite to it, but by 10 days to 2 weeks the taste smooths out very nicely--leaving just the flavor of the alcohol without the sharp acidic bite.

I have not tried this recipe but have a VERY similiar recipe that has been passed down from generations.  I'm sworn to never let it out of the family.  Mine doesn't have wine in it though and it's made in a very large batch.  (think 1 fifth each of the rum, bourbon and brandy).  We mix it in a cooler using whisks attached to power drills.  We mix the ice cream as part of the recipe too.  Now some hints to help with this:  Definitely age this!  We shoot for 3 weeks but usually it disappears before then.  Whisk everything until it's very froathy.  That will thicken it up some (why we use power tools).  Shake it often.  I'm thinking maybe that's why the one person said it smelled like rotten eggs.  I have people that HATE eggnog love my recipe so they should love this too.

Excellent.  The second time I made it I used only whole milk and a touch of cream because lots of cream makes my teeth feel coated.  Mellows with time so you can't taste the alcohol.

I made this and it’s amazing. I agree that the more time it sits the better. I left it alone for about two weeks and it was tasty and potent without tasting potent. Recommend for friends around the holidays, or anytime someone is craving some eggnog!

We made no changes, we shook it every other day.  So amazingly good - and I don't like egg nog! It was smooth, and delish, with a bit of ice cream in the glass. This year I am lowering the servings, just so that we don't imbibe too much!

Delicious, I mean delicious! I cut the alcohol in half because i'm not a drinker, but it was smooth like a milk-shake.  Never-liked egg-nog until i drank this. Tastes nothing like the store brand. Great!
