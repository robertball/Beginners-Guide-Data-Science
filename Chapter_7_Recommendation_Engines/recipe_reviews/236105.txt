Hello, Brian here, I have never cooked a full recipe before, decided to start with this simple one. The wings were delicious! I have never cooked before and I nailed this one. Only cons were I didn't know how long to preheat oven, and for the wings I left them whole instead of cutting them. However I like them better actually whole and I cooked them longer then said time by like 10 mins which made up for the preheating time. Cooked at 395 Degrees due to my oven, but it went very well and sauce came out delicious. Now I can do this on my own!!! Thanks!!!

Tried this last night- they were EXCELLENT! Not too hot and not too vinegar-y. Once the sauce was on we put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes. They were perfect! We definitely will be making these again!

Absolutely Amazing. I always bake wings instead of frying. This recipe is definitely the best, giving crispy wings without a lot of prep work. Many other recipes call for laying out wings on a baking sheet and  putting them in the fridge to dry out. When you are trying to get dinner on the table for your hungry family, an hour of prep time is a long time. Essentially after flipping the wings for the second half of baking time, they are getting crispy in their own oil. The sauce was super easy to make. To tone down the spiciness I added a few squeezes of ketchup and I ommitted the flour. The ketchup added the necessary thickness. I too had a lot of extra sauce. I'll store it in the fridge until next week's Wing Night. Also I used fresh wings instead of frozen. Great recipe.

This really is enough sauce for more than 5 pounds of wings.  I used 6 lbs., and there was still plenty of sauce.  When they come out of the oven, and after sitting 5 minutes, I put them 3 at a time into the sauce, then into the serving dish.  Then I pour the rest of the sauce over the wings in the dish.  These are always a hit.

This was my first effort cooking chicken wings and this recipe was perfect! I added seasoning to the wings before baking them in the oven, but followed everything else as outlined in the recipe. Highly recommend it.m

This has to be one of the easiest and best recipes for hot wings I've ever tried.  I pretty much followed the recipe with no substitutions using Franks Hot Sauce and a stick of salted butter (although I did season the frozen wings with a little black pepper before they went into the oven).  Otherwise that, I don't think I will need to tweak this any.  The only extra step I did was to put the wings back in the oven for about 10 minutes after I tossed them in the sauce.  Side note:  Next time I will probably reduce the amount of sauce I make because this makes too much for only 5lbs of wings.  Fortunately, I cooked 10lbs of wings and still had some sauce left over.  Definitely a keeper!

Best chicken wings I've ever had! Used frozen wings and followed the instructions. I quartered the sauce amounts and added a tablespoon on ketchup and a teaspoon of honey. Cooked the sauce in the microwave for a few minutes. Wings were so crispy, but sogged up a bit once tosses with the sauce. Put them back in for 5 minutes to crisp again. Next time I'll leave them in a bit longer. So good! Better than restaurant wings!

Delicious! Turned out amazing...I used a little less vinegar as the hot sauce I used seemed to have some in it already. Turned out great. I will definitely be making this again!

I cooked for Super Bowl evening.  They were a large "hit" my Honey.  I used Texas Pete for the hot sauce ingredient.  My 2nd batch I added a touch of honey (as I don't like them quite as hot.  Both batches - Excellent!  This is a "keeper" recipe.

Really enjoyed!  I like my wings "falling off the bone" and this recipe fits the bill!  I did cheat and use Frank's Hot Wing bottled sauce instead of making my own, but a great recipe!

Made this tonight and they were a hit! I had 4 lbs of wings so I halved the sauce recipe (based on the amount it makes and from reviews). It was just the right amount of sauce. And probably would have worked for 5 lbs depending on how saucy you like tour wings.

I use fresh wings.  I added A-1, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce but sprinkle hot sauce on for the first 30 minutes. I drained the grease and dip in the sauce for the next 30 minutes.

This is where I always go for my recipes.
I love to read the reviews and see what other people think beforehand.
I don't think there was any negative comments so I went ahead and tried the recipe.
The only thing I did different was using fresh chicken wings because I had just purchased them.
I did reduce the cooking time by a few minutes because they were fresh.
I will definitely be using this recipe again, the wings came out absolutely perfect and tasty without havingng too much heat.

This recipe is super simple to prepare and has become a yearly fixture at our super bowl parties. Frank's sauce is truly great but can be pretty hot for some so it might not be a bad idea to put a different tray together with a little less aggressive sauce. Overall a five star recipe though !

We have now turned this into a every-other-week dinner for the family! Thanks for such an easy recipe. I crisp the wings under high-heat broiler for additional 10-15 minutes in order to get a crispier bite.
