Really nice versatile recipe.  My one caveat was not needing even close to the whole box of pasta, I think even 1/2 a box would have been plenty.  My 3 kids ate this with no problem.  Very nice weeknight recipe, comes together very quickly.  I also used pasta water to thicken sauce instead of cornstarch.  Thanks for an easy and good recipe.

A tasty and easy dish.  I love veggies so added fresh sliced mushrooms, white onion & green bell pepper.  I sliced my carrot as opposed to shredding them, cooked them a bit longer than the other veggies.  I used linguine as I was out of Angel hair pasta.  Also did not have Chinese black bean and garlic sauce, so just tossed in approximately 3 tsp of chopped garlic.  I marinated the chicken in Teriyaki sauce prior to cooking.  I only used half the amount of pasta called for, but the same amount of broth.  This ratio of broth to pasta was perfect.  I will make this recipe again with the following changes double the amount of sauce, add a larger variety of veggies, use Teriyaki chicken & chopped garlic.  Overall, a lovely basic recipe.

We really liked this. I think the black bean garlic sauce added a depth of flavor to the dish beyond the soy sauce and sesame oil. Mine was a little salty but that was my fault.I used chicken bouillon instead of broth and then added more soy sauce.I cooked up the whole box of pasta but did not use it all, I think 3/4 of a box was plenty.  I also marinated the chicken in soy sauce and a little rice wine vinagar but I am sure it would have been fine without it.Will make again.

i am rating this a five because i don't want others to shy away from this recipe. if there were more votes than i would rate it a four. this was really good! i was nervous by how little ingredients it called for but i was shocked to find it very flavorful. i only used a half box of pasta like others suggested and i am glad i did. the broth to pasta ratio was spot on. i didn't have black bean and garlic sauce (could not find it anywhere!!) so i used oyster sauce instead. great recipe that i will make over and over again!

I was surprised as to how well this turned out.  I used hoisen sauce instead of black bean sauce,6 oz of pasta, 1/2 to 3/4 pasta water instead of the cornstarch, no broth, added shredded cabage, chopped onions and garlic.

Great base.  I add onion, napa cabbage and use fresh chinese egg noodles.  I also use thigh meat because my family prefers the moisture of the thigh meat in chow mein.

a very adaptable recipe. i did not have black bean sauce so i used oyster sauce in it's place. i doubled the sauce and used a whole box of pasta with double the veggies. i had 3 very large boneless skinless chicken breasts as well. this way we had lots of leftovers for work lunches. you could use any veggies you have on hand and add shrimp in the chickens place.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it very soupy.  The sauce never thickened.  I think 1 1/2 cup broth is way too much.  And I agree, too many noodles.  It also resembles nothing you would find in a Chinese restaurant, which was what I was looking for.

Added more veggies and it just wasn't very flavourful or worth the time and effort. Always on a quest for a good stir-fry and quick meals and this doesn't make the list. Sorry.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding snow peas and mushrooms because we love them in our Asian dishes. My really only complaint is that the dish looks so colorful and pretty until you add the black bean sauce and then it turns everything a greyish brown. Note also that the recipe states to set the cooked chicken aside but never does say when to add it back in. It was easy for me to know when to add it back in but a new cook would not know this and it should state in the instructions. With that said, this is a good base and can be changed up with different veggies for variety and I will make again.

This didn't work out for us.  I make dishes like this a lot and black bean and garlic sauce is a staple in my pantry.  I think the 3 tablespoons was a little much.  I LOVE the stuff, but thought this dish was too salty.  I even left out the soy.

i brought this to a potluck tonight with a theme of recipes we've never tried and this went over really well!  i added some extra broth so it wouldn't dry out on the trip over but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  the noodles really took on a great flavor.  this was really easy and really tasty, thanks!

I made this recipe as written; but substituted shrimp for chicken.   My husband and I liked it, but felt it was missing something flavorwise.  Whether it be to add sweet or spice, it needs something in our opinion.

Very easy recipe!  Easy to change things up and still get good results.   I added a bit more Sesame Oil than called for and bought actual lo mein noodles.

I had to double the corn starch to get it to thicken, but besides that, a really good recipe. I have made this twice now and plan to experiment with other sauces, maybe peanut.

This was delicious. My family loved it and it was easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe but did add fresh ginger to the recipe and used fettucine instead of angel hair pasta.  I will definitely make again.
