this recipe was a waste of time.  the ingredients' proportions were all wrong and it turned out like sugar soup with a blob of jelly-like "dough" plopped in the middle.  i was so frustrated doing the terrible recipe.

This is absolutely amazing and so easy!  It's almost sinful to get such great tasting buns without the added effort of yeast and rising time.  Instead of walnuts, I used Skor toffee bits and added a simple glaze to the top when still warm.  We couldn't keep our hands off of them.  Whoever made these before and said they were a globby mess probably didn't bake them long enough or they prefer the hard rolls.  These are definitely the gooiest!  Wonderful!!

Very delicious and easy! ..... overall the dough came out perfect,a little salty, and the texture was great. I put each bun into an individual cupcake pan with melted butter on the bottom...... this came out wonderfully, added with a scoop of Ice cream on top! Everyone enjoyed it. I will be making this again,for sure!

Very easy and delicious.  The only thing I would change is cutting back a little on the salt.  They had a salty aftertaste.

This recipe is a bit inaccurate. I followed it exactly and wound up with a batter instead of a dough. I added nearly a cup of flour extra and it still wasn't enough. I would recommend using 3 cups flour, plus extra to make the dough workable as necessary, before kneading and rolling out.

Absolutely AWESOME!  It's a family favourite and each time out-of-town family come in, they insist on it.  Having them fresh from the oven topped with a scopp of vanilla ice cream is just heavenly.

These buns were easy to make with no rising time or yeast. Our family enjoyed them with butterscotch ice cream sauce. The dough was super soft so I didn't roll it I just patted it into a square after a few kneads with floured hands. They tasted best fresh out of the oven.

These butterscotch buns are fantastic.  They remind me of the buns I use to buy as a young girl in one of our large department stores that had a bakery on the bottom level. They are easy to make, next time I am going to make them in mini muffin pans.

Oh so yummy!!! These are so gooey and delicious. I added some leftover butterscotch chips I had around which was fun! Thanks for this great recipe!
