TASTES GOOD, BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A "THICK" AND HEARTY CHILI, THIS IS NOT THE ONE. IT WAS MORE LIKE A SOUP.

This Chili was amazing.  I made it one night for my husband a few friends, and they loved it.  I did have to add a little more spice, but over all, it was super easy and fantastic

Pretty good chili and easy to make, did have to change a few things because with the young kids to pack up, just a quick trip to the grocery store is a pain.

I used tomato juice and tomato sauce, instead of the soup and vegi juice. Kept everything else the same and it turned out great. I think next time I will add some different kinds of beans though.

pretty good, since it is only me and my husband i used 1lb of ground beef and since we like it pretty spicy i used the half of a big bottle of spicy v8 juice and half of a chopped fresh jalap.....smelled great in the house and was a good difference to my usual very thick chili

I used a can of crushed tomatoes in place of the juice.  Also, did not use a slow cooker. It was great, will make again.

Thanks, this was a great recipe.  I doubled the beans and used a little less vegetable juice and it turned out fine.
