I didn't really think this was anything special, but it was nice and easy.  I wasn't a big fan of the onion soup on top.  That was the only really flavorful part of the dish, but overpowering when you got a big bite of it.  If I was to make this again, I would probably just mix the onion soup in with everything else.  My 2 year old liked it though and she's my toughest critic!

I make this recipe also and have for years but in order to make it lower calories I use brown rice and low fat soups and cut out the dry onion soup mix and it is still great and easy to make.

It was easy, but I was afraid it wouldn't have a lot of flavor, so I made a few changes. I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water. I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil with an onion and some garlic. I didn't have cream of mushroom, but I had sour cream, so I used that instead. I mixed the cream of chicken, milk, and sour cream. Then stirred the rice in, then the mushroom mixture. I poured half in an oven dish, layered the chicken, then poured the rest on. Then topped with crushed ritz. Pretty good that way. My only big change would be to cut up the chicken and mix that in and just pour it all together.

This was similar to an old recipie my mother used to make. I did add some sour cream and topped with paprika. Otherwise I followed as listed and it tasted great.

Really Great Hearty recipe.  If you are looking for something fancy, this is not it.  If you are looking for a great homemade meal for the whole family, this is great!  Exactly what I needed.  Husband loved it! I suggest serving with colors because as pictured, its not very colorful. :)

I made 2 servings or 1/2 of this recipe. I made 2 ingredient changes. Added 1 t. Better Than Bouillon organic reduced sodium chicken base to rice and water and added 1/2 c. of sour cream to soup and milk mixture. My construction is as follows. Mixed 1/2 of soup mixture and 1/2 of dry onion mixture into cooked rice. Mix well. Spray dish with non-stick spray and pour in rice mixture spreading evenly.  Layer fresh mushroom slices evenly over top. I cut chicken breast into bite-size pieces and layered next.  Pour remainder of soup/milk/sour cream mixture over top and spread evenly. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 of dry onion soup over top. Cover with foil. For my 1/2 recipe with chicken cut in bite-size pieces, I cooked in a 350 degree preheated oven for one hour. Removed foil and cooked 15 minutes longer.  Added green beans as a side. Chose this recipe because I am recuperating and wanted something non-spicy, simple and easy.  After making changes noted above I think the taste is great.  The dry onion soup mix adds just the right amount of flavor to keep in from being too bland.  Will definitely make again.

I give this 4 stars for the "Easy" part.  I thought that it was just OK.  I'm not a big fan of recipes with cream soups but when you're short on time and you have hungry mouths to feed on a work night, this fits the bill!  I made this exactly as written EXCEPT, I mixed the remainder of the Onion Soup Mix with the canned soups and milk.  If I was to make this again, I would definitely use "low sodium" canned soups and only half of the package of Onion Soup Mix as it is extremely salty.  If you like salty foods, you will like this.  My boys, 12 yrs & 7 yrs old thought it was pretty good.  My husband ate it and thought it was "good", but they were not saying WOW!  This is a good dish to prepare when you are short on time for YOUR family.  I wouldn't make this for "SPECIAL" guests.  I served fresh brussel sprouts on the side as my family loves them.  This can be served with just about any fresh veggie, green beans, aspargus, brussel sprouts, or just a dinner salad.  Thanks for the EASY recipe when you are short on time!!!!

Nothing special and needed major seasoning. Such a disappointment.

This is a really good, comfort food type recipe.  It's not fancy, but is definitely a tasty, easy recipe using ingredients that I keep around the kitchen.  I will be keeping this recipe on hand and making it again.
