This recipe was very easy to follow. My suggestion which made it taste like "real Indian" butter chicken was to add 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of butter (it's butter chicken). If not you have a very green pepper or tomato taste. Also maybe another TBSP of garam masala.

Made the recipe 100%!!!

This is a great recipe me and my wife had been looking for! It's not too hard and comes out great. It is wonderful just as it is, but we also like it thicker...

To thicken the sauce, you can try a couple of variations/substitions. Use an equivalent amount of tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes. This will cut down on the amount of prep time and be healthier as well because there will be  more Lycopene. Another possible substitute is yogurt in place of the heavy cream (less fat). Lastly, cook it uncovered. This will thicken it even more. 

A wonderful recipe, do not pass it up!!

I have made this recipe soooo many times and variations.My family loves it, I prefer to use mushrooms instead of the green pepper and 2 tins of chopped tomatoes and not fresh ones, I always leave it to cook for an extra hour as this allows the sauce to thicken and condense......my 11y.o daughter(who hates spice) is now totally addicted to this recipe and would gladly eat it every second day!!!! All I can really say is that if you take the time to tweak it to your own tastes this is an absolute ripper of a dish,mmmmmmmmm!!!!!

I wouldn't call this Butter Chicken.  Not even close, really.  BUT, this is a really good recipe.  I made a couple of modifications and my wife and guests LOVED it.  I doubled the garlic, used three 8 oz cans of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper for a bit more kick and 6 oz of non-fat yogurt instead of the heavy cream.  I am making this again for my parents real soon!

Having lived in India as a kid, I was always frustrated that I could never really feel good about an Indian dish I made - until I made this one!  Anyone can make it and it tastes FABULOUS!  Thanks so much!

I had many problems with this recipe.  It was WAY too bland and has WAY too many tomatoes.  This was nothing like any Indian food I have had out.  The recipe, as is, is terrible.  Luckily (and after an extra 1 hour of time) I saved my recipe by added 5X the amount of spice called for (YES, 5X!!!!) and I tripled the amount of cream.  You have to do this to make up for the overwhelming taste of pureed tomatoes.  Wow.  This was really something.  I will not make this recipe again.  Sorry!

I gave this recipe 4 stars since it doesn't taste any mugh makhani I've ever had. That said, it's a tasty and simple introduction to Indian food. 
I made a half recipe (which could easily serve 4 if served over rice with a veggie side) to start. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I doubled the garlic and chili powder. I also added some frozen peas halfway through. Recipe was still on the mild side, heat-wise, but had a great taste. Leftovers were even better!
My only other complaint would be that the recipe is fairly oily. I'd scale back on the amount of oil called for.

Before making this be sure you have a very BIG skillet. I only used 6 tomatoes and it came to the rim of my largest skillet. Not as easy as I thought since pureeing that many tomatoes in a blender is messy and time consuming (maybe my blender is too small). Anyway, I was disappointed that it was not spicier like the butter chicken we have out. BUT having said all that it was actually VERY tasty. Would make again with less tomatoes and more spice.

Oh wow! This recipe is every bit as flavorful as the other reviewers make it out to be! Totally a keeper! I read a bunch of reviews and based on them substituted low-fat yogurt for the heavy cream, a can of tomato sauce for the fresh tomatoes, and increased the Garam Masala slightly. It turned out wonderfully and I feel so much better that there isn't heavy cream in it (for a healthier meal). Other reviewers suggested substituting mushrooms for the bell pepper, but I found the bell pepper adds a really nice flavor. I wouldn't substitute it at all, it really adds a lot. Anyways, that's my two cents :)

Love the butter chicken at restaurants, and therefore disappointed with the recipe. It was very difficult to get rid of the tomato taste, despite placing extra amounts of sugar and spice and butter to mask the taste.

Love it!  I added double the garam masala, and some curry powder.  I also used canned tomato sauce and extra green pepper, added frozen peas and used yogurt instead of heavy cream.

This sauce is awesome-just what I was looking for!  Unfortunately, I pre-cooked my chicken instead of cooking it in the sauce and it was a bit dry-next time I'll make it as written.  I also added extra garam masala, butter and cream.  Plus, I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1/2 can of tomato paste-it made it super easy and yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this but don't use oil I take chicken quarters and place a dab of butter on each and about 1/4 c gram marsala and 2 T curry and rub this on the chicken and squeeze lemon on them and put in oven at 325 I then take a bowl and add 1 large can tomatoe crushed and to taste crushed red peppers 2 cloves garlic crushed and 1/2 sliced onions and one pint of cream 1 container of plain yogurt pour this on the chicken until cooked thorough and when I serve it I drizzle honey on it to take away the bitter taste you should also remove skin and extra fat first you can use chicken breast deboned I prefer with bone and serve with oven browned potatoes.

I love this recipe! And the kids do too. It's easy and delicious.

 I subbed canned tomato sauce for the whole tomatoes. There was no way I was messing with 8 of them. I put in about 2-3 cans of tomatoes depending on how much sauce I want, and a half cup(1 stick) of butter tasted better than 1/4 cup(half a stick) I've already made it twice more and the kids BEG for it. Hmm.. maybe next week again?

Some Indian recipes are too spice-filled for my tastes, or just have flavors that are totally unfamiliar to me, but my family & I thought this recipe was just perfect. I followed the suggestions to use plain yogurt instead of cream and I added more butter. It was delicious! (And not too strange for those who haven't had a lot of Indian food.) Plus: it was easy to make!

For the amount of time we had to put into it (not much), this was an adequate Indian dish.  Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews beforehand and made the mistake of subbing half and half for heavy whip - the result was a watery sauce that was almost like salsa - very tomato-y.  I found the amount of spice to be just fine as called for by the recipe, but I was disappointed with the consistancy.  Next time (if there is one), I'll use a few less tomatoes and heavy whip, and maybe a touch more butter.

This was easy, and a one pot meal if you ignore the food processor.  Great for an introduction to Indian food if you want to expose your family to new culture.

I wasn't too impressed by this dish.  I thought the pureed tomatoes and green pepper made the dish too watered down.  I wanted it to be creamier and it wasn't and by time you ad the cream, it's too late to really change anything because all those tomatoes are already in there. I thought it didn't have that much flavor either.  I probably won't make this again, but if I did, I think I would use half the amount of tomatoes.

I was disappointed with this recipe, I didn't think it was flavorful enough and all you could really taste was the tomatoes

This butter chicken has a really nice flavor, but it's definitely not as good as butter chicken I've had at restaurants.  I'd give it 3 stars except I think part of the reason I didn't much care for it is because of some changes I made.  I used 3 tablespoons of the garam masala instead of 2 as some people suggested, which made for a really nice flavor, but also made it a bit too spicy for our liking.  I also used half and half cream rather than heavy cream, which made the sauce a little too runny.  Would definitely use thick cream next time.  I used chicken thighs rather than  breasts as we find the darker meat more tender.  I also used margarine instead of butter (which has worked fine in other butter chicken recipes I've used), but maybe that contributed as well.  Overall, the sauce was not as tomatoey as I like, I think in large part due to the pureed pepper. When we had the leftovers I added a little tomato sauce which really helped.  I may try this recipe again but next time will follow the recipe exactly!

omg we loved this recipe!  the only thing i did differntly was i followed the suggestion to add one cup of cream, but only half a cup of butter. and i cooked the chicken seperately, seasoned with salt and garam masala as it cooked.  Then i stirred it in and let it simmer for about 20 more minutes.  Too delicious!

I still rate this 5 stars cause I think *Im* the one who messed up!

Mine was very tomatoe-y... not very creamy or buttery like I've had in Indian restaurants.

I couldn't find garam masala ANYWHERE! I used hot curry and cumin.

I gotta try again.

Excellent recipe!  Quick and easy, yet also delicious!  For extra spice, I added a dash of crushed red pepper.

Such an easy and great recipe!  Next time I'm going to add more of the spices because by the time I was eating the dish, I didn't taste any of the chili powder or garam masala.  
Went so well with rice, it's a must: definitely making this one again!

MY changes.... I grilled the chicken  (to not quite done so they could cook a little further) and then cut and added the pieces the dish after I removed it from the heat (but it was still hot).  I added a cup of frozen peas and a cup of frozen corn about 6-7 minutes before shutting off the heat.  Otherwise I was faithful. It was outstanding.

Amazing tastes.  I did do slight changes .  I used a large can of petite diced tomatoes and half the cream and the rest in yogurt.   I also slightly cooked the chicken in the pan with the onions and garlic, just to make sure it would be cooked thoroughly.  Served it over rice and is was fantastic!!   Will make again.. as a matter of fact I am making it tonight again!!  It will be a regular meal every couple of weeks for me.

This is my first review. The reason I chose this as the first is simply because this was THE most delicious meal I have ever made in my life and I'm no spring chicken! The taste was phenomenal and my husband who has always refused to even try Indian food loved it too. Thank you for this awesome recipe. I did sub the fresh tomatoes for pureed diced fire roasted canned tomatoes because it's what I had on hand and wow it was sooo good.

This will be a regular meal at our house. After reading other reviews, l eliminated green pepper but did add celery and carrots to get more veggies in the kids. I cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours and served over brown rice.

I use 2 cans crushed tomatoes(or 1 large can),  1 stick of butter, and 1 cup of heavy cream. I don't have a food processor, so all of my veggies are just chopped. It turns out fantastic, and my fiance has officially dubbed it 'wife food'. Yum.

I chose this recipe because it called for fresh tomatoes and green pepper which I had just harvested out of my garden.  I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. Instead of garlic i pureed some ginger with the onion because I have a garlic sensitivity.  I also used cayenne pepper powder instead of chili powder.

The big change I did was the method with the chicken, I had seen another recipe that called for marinading the chicken in yogurt and curry powder so I did that.  Instead of adding the chicken to the sauce raw, I did the sauce in one skillet and in another skillet I browned the chicken for a couple of minutes a side.  Then I spooned the sauce on top of the chicken and continued to cook until the chicken was done.  I kept some sauce in the other skillet and reduced it until it was nice and thick and then added it all to the chicken skillet.

This was really a fabulous dish.  Oh, another note, I only used 4 tomatoes and it was more than enough because my tomatoes are huge. I think the number of tomatoes called for must be little patio tomatoes or something. 8 tomatoes would have been way way way too many.  So use your common sense and adjust for tomato size accordingly.

I LOVE THIS!!!  I was entering a chili contest and wanted something different.  This was a great base for Indian Butter Chicken Chili which won second, only behind someone's chili that has won 5 times.  It was a hit!  Thank you for sharing an amazing recipe.  I have created Indian Chicken Chili from this recipe if anyone wants to check it out!

My family loves this! It may not be traditional Butter Chicken, but is a great family pleaser and a great introduction to the basics.
I usually make it as shown, but have found that cauliflower(frozen or fresh) works really well in it for some variety.
Some Basmati rice, a couple of pieces of Naan bread... and no leftovers, ever!

This was my first Indian type dish, so I was a bit nervous.  But after making this simple and delicious dish, I will keep it close in my recipe box!!  I didn't change anything, as I have ZERO experience in this type of meal, but it was great, thanks for sharing!
