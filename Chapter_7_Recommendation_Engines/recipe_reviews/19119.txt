I thought this recipe was very good.  I actually changed it abit.  I smoothed mayo over the chicken, sprinkled the italian seasoning on, (like others thought its way too much seasoning), then baked for 25 min., then poured alittle barbecue sauce and baked for another 25 min..it was EXCELLENT!!!

Since this was such a simple recipe, I only used it as inspiration and for cook times, and I measured freehand. I coated chicken breasts in lemon pepper and then basted with BBQ sauce. I hadn't realized that doing the baking in two sessions (first for the seasoning, then for the sauce) caused the seasoning to stick so nicely; I will definitely use this method again. I think this one is a "use your imagination" guide.

It is very good and simple to make. The seasoning really brings out the flavor of the barbeque sauce. (I did not have "Italian seasoning", so I made my own with garlic powder, basil, oregano, a dash of red pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese.)

This was a great recipe. It has been raining the past week and didnt want to grill so I looked up some bbq chicken ideas to bake. This was so good. I did take some of the others advice and just sprinkle with seasoning and I loved it. My family ate all of it and asked for more. I didnt have boneless chicken so I just used my chicken legs and it was wonderful. Thank you so much for a great recipe. 
This ones a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have 2 things to say about this recipe: moist, but "weedy".  There is waaaaaay too much italian seasoning. My husband and I scraped everything off in order to make it even palatable.

I've been searching for recipes in this site for sometimes now, and giving that I'm half asian, I like this chicken so much coz it has so many flavors and so tasty so  don't have to use my special made chili sauce!! and hubz likes it too, the only adjustment I made is I put a lot of cayenne pepper and hot sauce and add some celery seed and voila, the chicken is fabulous!!! Eat it with steamed white rice or mashed potatoes or just plain focaccia bread with some salad I made just toss few veggies with olive oil and vinegar.. Yum! Definitely a keeper.

My grandmother's name was Camille, my name is Camille & my granddaughter's middle name is Camille, so you know I had to try this recipe. I chose a night that my granddaughter was spending the night to serve this. I too just sprinkled on the seasonings ( I think 1/4 cup might be too much) & I basted the chicken w/ BBQ sauce the last 20 minutes. I think the BBQ sauce you use is going to play a huge part in this recipe... I used a homemade sauce (Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site) w/ excellent results. Thansk Nicki...both of these Camilles enjoyed your recipe.

unfortunately, there seemed to be too much seasoning in this dish. i would have rated the taste good, but my husband didn't like it at all, so i had to rate this a 2-card recipe.

My husband is a big fan of anything with barbeque sauce and he loved this one!  I sprinkled the italian seasoning on rather than using a bag to coat it though.  Very fast and easy.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point.  Instead of Italian style seasoning I used Montreal Chicken seasoning and chicken 'n rib barbeque sauce.  I also placed the chicken on top of a few layers of thinly sliced potato.  I found the amount of spice I used to be too strong, but I think I will make this kind of thing again, but tone down the seasoning.  I did like the way the texture of the chicken using this method of cooking.  I may try coating the chicken with pecan meal and using an appropriate sauce.

My husband gave this only 3 stars, but I definitely think it deserves 4. It was so quick and easy! I love recipes that don't require much effort, and this one is definitely at the top of that list! We're putting this one on "repeat"!

This was okay, but we won't try it again.  I think the italian seasoning was what I didn't like about it.

My husband and I just did not like this that much.  I asked him if he wanted me to make it ever again and he said no.  It is not bad it just does not taste all that good.  It is quick but not that special.

This was delicious! My 3 year old son loved it and so did my husband. I modified it just a little bit by adding minced garlic and cutting back on the Italian seasoning. This dish went well with brown rice and mixed veggies.

Very easy! I used less seasoning than the recipe called for...seemed just fine.  I did bake covered for the first half then uncovered the last portion.

quick and easy to make.  Next time I'll cover the pan because I think the chicken was a little dried out.  But good recipe. I'd make it again

This recipe caught my attention also because my name is Camille too and also I love barbecue chicken. I rubbed the seasoning in lightly and the last 20 minutes added the barbecue sauce because I like the sauce baked in the chicken good and not messy. The extra seasoning made a big difference.

I tried this making an individual serving (just 1 chicken breast), and I loved it. Just use 1/4 of what is called for. Delicious recipe!

The flavor of this recipe is delicious.  I agree with others - Way too much seasoning.  It just needs to be sprinkled w/ seasoning, and add sauce.  I bake it at 350 for about 25 minutes, and don't need extra sauce for serving.  Comes out delicious every time.

Good simple and super-easy recipe. I used less Italian seasoning. It's a great recipe when you don't have time to marinade the chicken. The kids loved it!

This was super easy and very tasty.  I took one reviewer's recommendation to shake on the seasoning to my own liking and that was a great idea.  I will definitely use this recipe, as well as the double baking method again.  Thanks!

This is basically baked barbeque chicken with a twist.  It was very easy, but wasn't very special.  I may make it again if I am in a pinch, but I am not raving over it.

Didn't have Italian seasoning so I used a mixture of marjoram, thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion powder, sea salt, and pepper. It was great!! I'll definitely be having this again!

This chicken was so good and moist.  I did not have italian seasoning so I used St Louis Style Grill Creations instead. I also cooked chicken thigh fillets instead of breasts.  They are perfectly portioned and every bite is full of flavor.  I find that unless I marinade chicken breasts, they do not retain flavor through the center.

This is a tasty way to make chicken. I only had thighs so I cut back on the Italian season a tad and I cooked them on the grill but the Italian season really came out and they were very good. I can't wait to try this with breasts.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this dish.  I just sprinkled the italian seasoning on rather than using so much and added salt and pepper.  We used sweet bbq sauce though and I think it would have been better with a tangy one.

This was a different way to make barbecued chicken. My family enjoyed this very much and devoured every morsel. I thought it was okay but I didn't think the Italian seasoning went so well with the smokey hickory barbecue sauce. I didn't dip anything just sprinkled the seasoning over the chicken and the same for the sauce. This was simple and the family enjoyed it. Thanks.

Excellent recipe. I don't measure the ingredients - I just cover the chicken breast with Italian seasoning and then smother with Diana Sauce at the appropriate time. My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this, especially when there is extra barbecue sauce!

I loved this! So good, I JUST got done eating it for dinner. I sprinkled on the Italian seasoning, I also used Garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, and seasoning salt. I basted on the BBQ sauce when it was time. I used Honey Hickory BBQ sauce. My husband and my 1 1/2yr old son also devoured it.

I made this the other night and it came out awesome,  I didn't put the seasonings in a bag I sprinkled them on both sides and baked it for 25 mins. The chicken was juicy and very good I will make this again..

I made this a couple of nights ago...The Italian seasoning was too much, but other than that, it had a great taste. I will definitely adjust the seasoning for the next time, and will probably experiment with some other tastes.

This is a really quick and easy recipe!! I used drumsticks instead of breasts and it turned out really well. I did add just about a half cup of water and about 2-3 teaspoons of Shedd's Spread and it turned out great! My nephew who is not much of a meat eater at all asked for seconds!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I altered the recipe-- making my own bread crumbs and only seasoning them a little bit.  We then cooked it longer with the bread crumbs on and less time with the BBQ sauce.  We'll probably make it again sometime.

This was very good however I chose to use a Chicken Grill Rub instead of italian seasoning and just sprinkled then pressed into the meat abit instead of putting in a bag.  I like the idea of cooking with just seasoning then adding the sauce halfway through.

I used Italian bread crumbs.  The taste was not very strong and did not clash with the BBQ sauce.  I thought it turned out very well.

Loved it! We had family visiting so I tried this recipe, but used another person's idea for spreading mayo on first then shaking the seasoning over the chicken instead of tossing it altogether. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds! We will definitely be having this again!

This flavor combination just wasn't for us. I used less seasoning than the recipe called for, and I was glad I did because it was still too much. I didn't hate it, but my husband did. It's rare that he doesn't finish a dish, but he left most of this on the plate.

After taking other reviewers advice into account and cutting the seasoning by quite a bit, I must admit that this makes a very good piece of chicken. My husband (who is the pickiest eater in my family) loved this! He even ate the leftover breast the next day, which is another first for him. So thank you for this...my whole family loved it and I know it will become a staple in the household.

Made recipe as written with about 1.5lbs of chicken (two large breasts) and is delicious.  Herb flavor is there, but we do not find it overpowering at all.  Such an easy and quick dinner.

This came out very well, but I do suggest cutting the seasoning measurement in half if you're using 4 chicken breasts.  I used two chicken breasts and cut the measurement in half, and the Italian seasoning still way overpowers the chicken.  So, I'd say to use much less than the recipe calls for, even if you're making the full recipe.  Otherwise, it was very good!

This was alright but a little dryer than I would have liked although I followed all the directions. I will definitely give it another go and see how it turns out with a little tweaking.

I used 8 chicken breasts and eye-balled the seasoning in the bag. I still didn't put in 1/4 cup but it was still a little too much, so I'll do less next time.  The cooking method, however, works great to get the seasoning to stick to the chicken under the sauce.  I'll definitely do this again - and like others will probably play with it a bit, trying different seasoning and sauces.

Easy and good - but not terrific.  Use less italian seasoning - just sprinkle on top - and bake for a total of 50 min.

This was just ok for me but my husband loved it.  I only used half of the Italian seasoning,as other reviewers suggested, just did not care for the BBQ sause and Italian seasoning, may try again with even less Italian seasoning.  But it was a great idea to bake in two steps.  This allowed me to precook the first part, have a walk and still finish our meal at a reasonable time.  Will try this again with other recipes.

This recipe worked well for the most part. I did choose to sprinkle the Italian seasoning to avoid having too much as others had suggested. My chicken(bnls breasts)were done well before the time listed. It was good, but not especially memorable.

The chicken was moist, but this wasn't the best recipe. I don't know what it is, but Italian Seasoning and BBQ Sauce is like using coffee creamer to replace milk in a recipe... decent idea to save yourself, but not necessarily the best choice. It's better to just go with one or the other. Hubby liked it, but he won't miss it if I don't make it again.

This recipe was so easy! I took the advice of other reviews and just sprinkled the seasoning on the chicken. It turned out great and the chicken is nice and moist.  A new family favorite!

This was pretty good, but not great.  The ease bumped it up to 4 stars.  I did overcook the chicken a little so it came out dry.  I may feel totally different about this recipe when I cook the chicken a  little less.  Easy recipe to make in a pinch!

Used chicken legs with skin removed because that is what I had on hand. I sprinkled the seasoning and followed the rest of the recipe.  Great flavor.  Looking forward to having this again with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Good stuff.  Took the advice of one reader and added Montreal seasoning to the Italian seasoning, and did not use as much and it was yummy.  Very moist.

Made this last night for my BF (I'm vegetarian) and he really liked it. I added some more spices to the italian herbs to kick it up a notch and followed others suggestions by just rubbing it on. Very easy to make, it will go in the regular rotation

The meal was really easy and quick but I am not a big fan of oregano and the italian seasoning has a lot of oregano.  I will cook it agian but not with a lot of italian seasoning.  Thanks Camille
