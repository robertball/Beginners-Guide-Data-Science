I made one change and that was using a whole bag of chocolate chips IN ADDITION to the 2/3 of a cup that was melted. I did not bake these in 1/4 cup mounds, I used my cookie dough scoop (overfilled, not level) to make level smaller cookies. Even though they were smaller, the flavor was not lost in any way. We absolutely loved these cookies, especially right out of the oven. Out of the whole batch, only a handful remain. NOTE: If you make them smaller as I did, I did bake mine at 350* for ten minutes.

My new FAVORITE!  I followed this recipe exactly but I will say I hestitated a couple of times.  I tasted the batter and it did taste too salty but not after it was baked.  Also, I hesitated to make them with a quarter cup measure.  I thought surely they would be too big.  Wrong again.  Perfect!  I am a chocoholic and I loved these!!  I am going to make these again and add peanut butter chips, and another batch with mint chips.  They are a nice size cookie to wrap for a bake sale.  This recipe is going to get a lot of use at my house.  Thanks Nestle Toll House!

Chocolate Heaven - I just couldn't think of two better words to describe these cookies! They're so chocolately and so chewy these are sure to be a favorite. These cookies stay soft for days - that is if they last that long! This recipe is perfect so if you're new to making cookies follow this recipe exactly and you'll come out with perfect cookies that taste incredible. I let the dough chill for a bit in the fridge and baked them on parchment paper. Be sure to have plenty of milk on hand 'cause your gonna need it for these chocolate treats!

I LOVE these cookies! Love the dark chocolate taste, love that they are delicate, rich and oh so chocolately. They remind me of a molten lava cake when fresh out of the oven. Slightly crisp on the outside and warm and gooey on the in. I pulled mine out when the tops started crackling up (about 13 minutes but I made my cookies a tad bit smaller than noted here. I got 24 palm sized baked cookies). They are soft and don't seem cooked enough but they will set up. Let sit on the cookie sheet a couple minutes before pulling them off to finish cooling on a rack. I don't feel they need more chips but I will add chopped walnuts to the next batch because I love a chocolate and walnut combination.  If you follow the recipe as written you should enjoy these amazing wonderful cookies.

Delicious!  The only thing preventing this from getting 4 stars is that there were not enough chips. I tossed in some cinnamon chips so this had a mexican chocolate taste. I also cut back on the salt to 1/2 t.

They were good but a little too cakey and not enough chips. I will add butter, bake less and add more chips next time.

These are really good. I am not normally a huge fan of dark chocolate, but they really good.  They remind me of the brownies on the edges of the pan with a little crunch.  Only with the cookies you get more of that crunch.  Yum!

Just a note, the batter is very stiff - this recipe only makes 12 but I wouldn't recommend doubling it.  Just make two separate batches.

Very good cookie. I love double chocolate cookies.  I couldn't find the dark chocolate chips, so I used semi-sweet. These have a nice texture, light and crispy, yet still a little chewy. I wanted to make them more festive for the holidays, so I added 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and about 10 peppermint candies, crushed. I saved the pretty pieces of peppermint to press onto the top of the cookies after they came out of the oven. It added a nice little crunch. No complaints here about being too salty - I used unsalted butter and 1/2 tsp. salt and they are fine. ***Update: I first reviewed this recipe when they were right out of the oven. I really liked them then. But now it's a couple days later and they are really dry and crunchy.

I like to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it before making any changes. I love dark chocolate, but the cookies were so ridiculously salty they were practically inedible. I would try it again with unsalted butter, but if the recipe implies unsalted butter, it should be specifically stated.

These are very chocolaty and yummy! My only issue I have with this recipe is the dark chocolate chips were no where to be found in my area. I used the semi-sweet chips and they were plenty chocolaty!

Love these!!  I used Ghiradellie bittersweet chocolate chips and Hershey Dark Chocolate cocoa.  I also made them normal size and baked them @ 350F for 14 minutes.  Fantastic dark chocolate cookie that isn't overly sweet!!

These cookies are great!  They get a little crispy on the edges and chewy on the inside.  I did add a few cherry chips to the batter for the color and because I wanted a few more chips in the batter (the new lighter package of chips wasn't quite enough for me).  I liked these cookies more than the original recipe using dark chocolate chips.  Thanks, Nestle!

I took the advice of another review and skipped the salt. I used dark brown sugar, and I didn't pack it in since I didn't want it to be too sweet. I baked them for 16 minutes, but I think they needed to be in there for about 18 minutes. My cookies were starting to fall apart when I was tasting one of them. They were fairly easy to make. I love dark chocolate and these had a that rich dark chocolatey taste! They were also a little cake like which I didn't mind.

Hubby went crazy over these cookies.  Would absolutely give them more than 5 stars.  I made them to take to my doctors office tomorrow and I may have to hide them so that I actually have some left to take.

Dark Chocolate? How I heart thee. I didn't realize until too late that I used 1/3 cup for the baking cocoa. I used a bit less baking soda & no salt since I used salted butter. Yum!!

Good, but I think they need more chocolate chips especially for presentation.  This is the second year I've made these for Holiday cookie platters, this year not jumbo size, and they don't look anything like that delicious Nestle cookie photo.  Maybe sprinkle the top with a few morsels before they go into the oven??  I'll try that the next time or perhaps use 3/4 cup of chips.  Rich, decadent chocolate cookie.

I was skeptical about making these because I'm not a huge dark chocolate fan.  However, not only did I like them, but my kids really enjoyed them as well.  I took these to a party, and they didn't last very long.

Overall I am not a huge fan of a chocolate on chocolate cookie. While others thought this recipe was too salty, I actually love the salty taste mixed with chocolate. They jumbo size cookie is also a plus! I followed the recipe as written with the addition of some cinnamon that I added to the batter. Delicious and would absolutely make again!

One word...YUMMY! These were so good!  Very rich and very chocolatey!  I used the entire bag of chips and cooked a little less than the suggested time.  This resulted in a soft and chewy cookie with nice crisp edges.

I wanted to love these.  They baked up so thin and greasy.  So I added extra flour, extra baking soda, and chilled the dough.  Still no improvement.  They are crumbly and fall apart.  I also tried chilling the dough overnight and that was no help either.  I will stick with Carol P's Ultimate Double Chocolate Cookies, just stir some chips into the batter and voila!  UPDATE: I made these again this year for the Allstars Activity but I got some help from my culinary instructor at the college (thanks Chef Petti!)...added a few extra T of flour, used baking powder instead of soda, chilled the dough, and made them a smaller size.  They came out MUCH better, but I still prefer the Ultimate Double Chocolate Cookies with morsels stirred in - I think it's the coffee powder that enriches the flavor.

Great recipe as is. I used unsalted butter (ALWAYS for baking). I also made them regular size. My only difficulty was in determining when exactly they were done due to the dark color and slightly different texture than regular chocolate chip cookies.

These were good, but not the best cookie I've ever had. They were easy enough to make, but I didn't like how much they spread out (I like a thicker, softer cookie), but if you like your cookies on the flatter, crisper side, then you will enjoy these. They had a nice flavor though, and I can definitely say that I am LOVING the Dark Chocolate Morsels (I used the whole bag)! :)

I'm kind of a cookie snob and these cookies were good but not great.  I didn't care for the texture.  Right from the oven they are soft but after cooling they had a dry texture.  I do however love the Nestle Dark Chocolate Chips.

Some yummy cookies here, especially for the chocolate lover!  Make them any size you like, but if you do make them smaller, you'll need to watch the baking time, it'll be a little shorter, and you don't want to burn these!

Flavor was nice, but the dough, after adding everything was very dry and crumbly. It wouldn't stay together so I added a few tablespoons of whole milk to reconstitute. It worked and the kids liked them, but I won't be making them again.

I really liked these. Warm out of the oven these reminded me of a brownie. They do make rather large cookies. If I make these again I will make them into regular sized cookies so I won't feel quite so guilty eating one. ;)

Oh my gosh, these cookies are HUGE!  They're extremely chocolaty without being overly sweet, which is what I love most about them.  The only negative thing about them is that they seem a little "gritty", as if the sugars didn't combine well with the other ingredients for some reason.  One HUGE tip - be sure to let these cool on the baking sheet for a full five minutes before trying to transfer them to a cooling rack.  Until they're almost completely cool, they're VERY fragile and will fall apart easily.

These were absolutely FANTASTIC!  Everybody loved them.  I was concerned when I made (the first of 3 batches) because it was a really stiff, but it came out perfect.  Also, I think the amount of chocolate chips is perfect (comes out to exactly the 11oz bag). As for those that think they were too salty, use unsalted butter.  I always use unsalted in baking unless recipe specifically states otherwise.  I got 20 cookies using a cookie scoop.  This is definietely being added to my normal cookie rotation - Tollhouse Original Chocolate Chip cookies have been a family staple since I was born!

These are very Yummy! Things I found wrong with this was not enough chocolate chips and slightly to gooey. I used a regular cookie scoop instead of a jumbo. I baked mine for 10 mins they came out palm size. Will try cooking them for a few extra mins next time.

This is a cookie that thinks it's a brownie...no, wait!  This is a brownie that thinks it's a cookie!  Either way, I think it's delicious!  This is for the true chocolate lover--rich, dark, not too sweet!  My only criticism is that the recipe only makes 12!  They are jumbos though, so one at a time will really do.

These big cookies are good. Never was a fan of dark chocolate but NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Dark Chocolate Morsels are just right. I always use unsalted butter and added the 1/2 teaspoon salt per the recipe. Perfect.

I thought these were pretty good. I made them for the Allrecipes Allstar group. I didn't want giant cookies, so I used a cookie scoop. With a standard cookie scoop, the recipe yielded 33 cookies and took about 13 minutes to bake. I thought the overall flavor was good, my only issue was they were a tad sweet. Also, I felt that I could sense, texture wise, some of the sugar grittiness and I baked them fully. I never noticed that with regular chocolate chip cookies before. Still, I feel these would be well received at a pot luck or party.

Just what you need when you need chocolate! The added melted chocolate makes all the difference.  Only thing I changed was I substituted some splenda for part of the sugar. This is some where between a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie.  Once again, AWESOME!

Fabulous cookie recipe. Even my non-dark chocolate lovers...loved it. The other reviewer was not nice about the salt. I used half the recipe and it was fine. I also made 42 smaller cookies instead of 12 which cut the serving calories down to 48 calories per cookies. Also needed to lessen the baking time to 13-14 minutes. Parchment paper? Why didn't I try this before. No more "stick to the pan" cookies and messy clean ups. My new favorite cookie for sure.

Theese are really really good!  I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Also do not use the microwave.  This ruins food and makes it carcinogenic.  Melt the chocolate chips on the stove top in a small sauce pan.  It's easy,

These are delicious, very chocolatey cookies.  I used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao dark chocolate chips and it made them extra rich and delicious.  I didn't find them overly salty as others did but I always use unsalted butter so the cookie needs salt added in when you use unsalted butter.  They tasted better to me after cooling completely rather than straight out of the oven.

I really liked these. I only reduced the salt by a little and made them into smaller cookies (10 min at 350). They are very rich and I will make them regularly.

Delicious!  Made a double batch and they were gobbled up quickly!  Make sure not to overcook the chocolate in the microwave.  I almost burned mine.  Melting chocolate in double boiler might be a better solution.

Yummy! These tasted just like Mrs. Fields double chocolate chip cookies and no, you don't have to use "Toll house" brand; I used generic. I might have used a small pinch less salt, but I think it was just fine; husband found it a tad bit salty but absolutely delicious. If it hardens the next few days, just warm it in the microwave. I would make this again!

I made this recipe a little bit healthier by switching the butter for 1/3 cups pumpkin puree and the egg for 1/4 cups pumpkin puree. I also skipped on adding in the melted chocolate for 1 teaspoon more cocoa powder and used some dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips. The result was some deliciously moist, and unique tasting cookies, for less calories and fat. I'll definetly make these again!

Made these the other day and I had to add roasted walnuts, which add a nice flavor and crunch. I have to say these are not a real sweet cookies which I like.

My family of chocoholics loved these cookies.  This is a very dry dough I would not recommend putting the dough in the refrigerator.  It becomes very difficult to work with when cold.

They taste as good as they look! Be sure not to over bake. Get them out of the oven when they still appear to be a little under done and they will continue to set up and be just perfect after they sit on the cookies sheets for 5 minutes. Delicious!

This recipe offers a different twist on chocolate/chocolate chip cookies.  They were not as sweet as I expected, but that's not a bad thing.  The richness of the dark chocolate more than made up for it.

Oh wow...this recipe was DELICIOUS. I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but I really couldn't stop eating these. The only suggestion I have is to either use unsalted butter or omit/reduce the salt in the recipe. I used both salted butter and the 1/2tsp of salt, and I could taste just a tad bit too much salt. They were still DELICIOUS though, and I actually can't wait to make these again!

We substituted 1 cup of chocolate chips with a full package (around 2 cups) Reese's peanut butter chips, while keeping the 2/3 cup melted chocolate chips. The result was incredible.

These were delicious. It was a rare occasion for me to make cookies from scratch, and oh my, everyone loved them! I didn't make them jumbo, just regular size and baked them for 11 minutes at 350 degrees. MMMM!!!

I have made these 2 times already and both times they were just ok.  The first time I made them, they were REALLY dry and crumbly for some reason and not at all something I would want to photograph.  THis time, I cut back on the dark choc chips and added in some chopped walnuts.  THey turned out good, but not great.  I did, however take a picture of this batch to post.  I don't think I wll be making these again.

Fantastic!  Finally really chocolatey chocolate cookies.  These cookies are perfect; crunchy and chewy.  I added walnuts for more flavor but also think shredded coconut might be a good addition.

These were good, but they're almost too chocolatey (I know, it's blasphemy, but these are RICH.)  I undercooked mine just a bit, and I think that reduced the cakiness quality that other reviewers mentioned.  Also, I think I liked these after they were cooled instead of right out of the oven (blasphemy again!)  After I measured out the 2/3 cup chips to melt, I just threw the rest of the bag into the batter and it worked well.  These would be great with some ice cream and a tall glass of milk - which is what I'll suggest to the folks getting them in cookie baskets this week!

We all loved these. The only thing that bothered me was the slight saltiness to them. Granted I'm not a big sweets person but cookies should not be that salty (I'd cut the salt in half or at least use unsalted butter - neither of which the recipe states but has been suggested here already.) Otherwise, they were awesome and I'd make them again.

I should have headed the cautions of the cookie being too salty but I didn't since I typically like the salt and chocolate pairings but in this cookie it was too much. Unsalted butter needs to used or Salted butter and 1/2tsp of salt omitted. My family on the other hand didn't mind the saltiness and gobbled these cookies up. I did chill the dough but found it was a mistake or rather I let it chill for too long and the dough become too hard to scoop with a cookie scoop so I had to let it soften some. I made these smaller cookies as well and baked for 13-14minutes.

Absolutely perfect!  They went in holiday wrapping to be shipped off to family for this Christmas season.  The texture is perfect.  I subbed white chocolate chips for part of the morsels and used the dark for the other part.  I also added some toasted walnuts.

For anyone who thinks these are salty, you are probably using salted butter.  The recipe doesn't state to use unsalted butter, but whenever a recipe calls for salt, I either use unsalted butter, or leave the salt out all together if I don't have unsalted butter.  However, that all said, I love the salty sweet of a cookie!  YUM :)

Oh my! These will definitely work when I need a "chocolate fix," and I didn't even use the dark chocolate! I used semi-sweet chocolate and made smaller cookies. My cookie scoop held 4 tsp. of dough. I baked the cookies for 13 minutes and got 2 dozen. Delicious!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe. I used a medium cookie scoop instead of what the directions called for. They turned out FANTASTIC and very tasty!!!
I cook for my husband's company often and these are sure to be a big hit with the men that work there.

I live in Denver. Making cookies can often be an "altitude" challenge. These cookies came out perfect. Chewy, chocolatey goodness!  I used dark chocolate chunks instead of morsels.  Yummy!
