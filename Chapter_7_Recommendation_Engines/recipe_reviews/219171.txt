This recipe would be wonderful but for the cooking time.  There's no way this is baked fully in 45 min.....2.5 lbs of meat was completely rare.  I cooked it for 45 additional minutes at 350.

It's unfortunate to have to rate this pretty darned good meatloaf so poorly, but the fact that the cooking time is SO way off can neither be excused nor ignored. While he does mention that the meatloaf should reach a temperature of 160 degrees, a professional chef certainly ought to know that a 2-1/2 pound meatloaf would never cook through in 45 minutes, and this error could result in a very disappointing outcome for the inexperienced cook who trusts the recipe. The error should be corrected, as the recipe itself deserves a better rating - and the cooks who try this should be able to rely on the directions.  As for the meatloaf itself, the "almost puree" of vegetables was novel for me, and I liked it. Not only are you getting some extra nutrients, but all these vegetables also contribute moisture and great flavor to the meatloaf.  I'm not a fan of "Italian seasoning," so I just threw in a handful of fresh herbs - parsley, sage, thyme and oregano. I omitted the cayenne.  I also skipped the glaze, which neither of us cares for.  Cooking time will vary given the size and shape of your meatloaf, but my 2 pound loaf was cooked just right at 350 degrees for an hour and a half.  (AR, if you correct the time and temp on this recipe, please raise my rating to four stars)

I increased the italian herbs (I assumed that to mean italian seasoning--I used my own homemade italian seasoning) to two teaspoons and I used homemade croutons (day old bread, brushed with EVOO and garlic powder, cut into 1 inch pieces and baked until crispy, then cooled) that I ground down in the food processor. Those were the only changes I made. Ginormous meat loaf. It fit in my Perfect Meat Loaf pan, but just barely, with a quarter inch at the top. Mine did take almost two hours to bake, taken out the last half hour to pour over the glaze. This was one of the better meat loaves I've ever made. Very flavorful, quite filling. I served homemade biscuits and Cheesy Vegetable Medley with this. Out of that big meatloaf, just under half remains--my oldest boy ate two pieces and my husband ate three! We all really liked it. The rest will be used for sandwiches in lunches tomorrow. I'll make this meat loaf again.

My husband loved this meatloaf.  My advice is to also watch the video because he gives you some extra tips on how to make it moist and tender.  But whoever said there is alot of chopping involved is right.  But meatloaf is easy to prepare ahead of time.  While your chopping, chop extra and freeze it so that next time you will have it chopped already.

I did not have all the vegetables so used what I had available at the time (carrots, celery & onion). I did use a food processor & think the finely chopped veg.s (even just the few I used) positively added to the flavor and moisture. I don't think the fine chopping can be achieved by hand. I watched the video & noted forming the loaf in a dish rather than I had been accustomed to using a bread loaf pan. I doubt I'll ever use a loaf pan again for meatloaf. I liked how this cooked in a larger casserole dish. I gave this 4 stars only because the sauce was too "mustardy" taste. We like a sweeter sauce so I just added more ketchup & brown sugar.

Classic Meatloaf Haiku: "So close to five stars! We weren't fond of the glaze. Otherwise, awesome!" Absolutely adored this meatloaf, but the glaze was just a tad on the sweet side. I halved the recipe for 1 lb. beef, omitted mushrooms (didn't have any, but I just increased the other veggies - pureed veggies in meatloaf = brilliant!!) and baked mine at 350 for an hour. Seriously moist, magnificent meatloaf that I'll gladly make again, but I'd reduce, or drop the brown sugar all together next time.

The time is correct but you must put it in an open pan and shape as he does in the video.  If you are making it in a loaf pan it has to cook longer.  I cooked as he did in video and it was right on.

This recipe is really good and a good way to sneak in some veggies. I didn't have celery, so used green pepper and omitted the mushrooms because of lack thereof, but would definitely add them next time. the main difference was I put them in muffin tins (the big ones, not the little cupcake ones) and they were wonderful. Cooked it at 350 for 30-35min TOTAL. Very flavorful and moist.

The best meat loaf ever!!! I've been using the tried-and-true Lipton onion soup mix and Campbells Cream of Mushroom version for decades, until this!

Since we're lacto-ovo paleo vegetarians, I only made a few changes. I used roadkill skunk and woodchuck for the meat (be sure to remove the skunk scent gland, and the anal sac from the chuck, keep for the glaze), and ground them pretty coarse with a woodchipper. The veggies are critical, and local ramps and fiddlehead ferns worked GREAT!, with seasoning at the minimum (locally sourced road salt). 

The only substitution I made for the glaze was to use the gland oil from both animals mixed with maple syrup (a one to one ratio worked GREAT!). You should get about 1 cup of glaze mix total, and I poured it all over the loaf in a beech bark loaf pan (no pre-bake) before baking.

Like others, I thought the temps and times were a bit off, so I started it like a Christmas venison haunch roast at 550 degrees F ( the highest my oven will go), until I got an internal temp of ouch using my pinkie finger, then finished in a cherry wood smoker until I got really hungry. Then I ate the whole thing myself. I'm still puking, but I'll die happy.

Seriously folks, for those who don't get the satire, the first time you make a recipe, do it to the letter, exactly as described. Get a good probe thermometer and learn how to use it. Only after the first attempt can you reasonably expect to be able to modify the recipe with success, since you have no "b

I really wanted to like this recipe because I love Chef John's Green Bean Casserole and Pot Roast but it may be the most disappointing meatloaf I've ever eaten.  Here is my list of complaints: #1. the flavor of the vegetables is unappealingly prominent, probably would be better to saute the vegetable first to mellow the flavors before processing  #2. the flavor of the dried thyme in the Italian seasoning does not go well with the meatloaf,  #3. 2 T. of dijon mustard in the glaze was overpowering, using 1-2 t. would have been better or substituting regular mustard instead of dijon and  #4. the cooking time was way off.  When I checked the internal temperature after 45 minutes, it registered at 116 degrees.  After I turned the oven up to 350 degrees it still took another 35-40 minutes to reach 160 and by then the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli were cold.  The end result was a dry, dense unappetizing meatloaf.  Sorry, but this did not work out for us.

I didn't read reviews before I tried it.  But watched this video: http://allrecipes.com/video/319/making-classic-meatloaf/detail.aspx?prop24=RR_RelatedVideo

Turned out to be the best meatloaf I've ever made because I accidentally baked longer.  I biled carrot and sauted onion.  I would saute garlic next time.

Best freaking meatloaf ever! My friend said it was the best thing I've ever cooked. I did change the glaze up a bit...ketchup, dry mustard, brown sugar, and lemon juice. I cooked for only 5, cooked for an hr at 350 degrees.

Made this meatloaf for family dinner of 20.  Everyone loved it!  I did cut the brown sugar by half to make the glaze less sweet.  Baked it at 350 for 1.5 hours.

Not bad, but better without the bell pepper, which doesn't agree with everyone. Also, cook it at 350 and it gets a great crust. I also used evaporated milk and it came out perfectly.

AMAZING! I am eating it right now. Definately had to cook it a lot longer than prescribed in the recipie but it is hands down the best meatloaf I have ever had. I absolutely loved seeing how many fresh veggies went into it! 
I followed the recipie exactly except for the dijon mustard in the sauce. I did not have dijon mustard, but I did have powder mustard. So I put an extra 2 tablespoons of ketshcup (in place of the dijon mustard) into the sauce mix and then sprinkled a little bit of the powdered mustard into the sauce.

I would have to agree with everyone that the cooking time is way off for a meatloaf that is 4x6. Maybe if it was flattened out more, it would only take 30 to 35 mins. to cook. At any rate, I thought it was very good. I liked it. I put in too much Italian seasoning by mistake but it still turned out fine. I wasn't sure if the bread crumbs were fresh or dry but I used dry and it was moist enough. I also used the mushroom gravy recipe Chef John posted and it was excellent. I have leftovers which we will enjoy in a sandwich. Glad this was successful.  Let me just add, a 4 inch high meatloaf is extremely high for a 13x9x2 inch pan. Maybe in a loaf pan but I didn't use that. i flattened mine out to about 2-1/2 inches and it cooked quicker too. I turned the oven up to 350 after an hour and it finished cooking in about 15 minutes.

It's a great recipe. The timing is off, more like oven 350 F for 1 hr and 20 mins (therm @170 degrees) when done. Great taste meatloaf. One more change, I use ground beef, veal, pork. It was unbelievable taste. Everyone loved it.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted!  it's fun to make, and my family woofs it down!  I press the juice out of the "almost-pureed" vegetables before adding them to the meat.  Dont know if you're supposed to or not, but I do.

Very good. I made in the morning and let rest all day.  When ready to serve I sliced and put in fry pan with Pam to brown both sides.  I definitely needs to "rest" to have all the flavors blend. And to mention I cooked for almost one hour before the glaze.  With the glaze I put back in oven 20 min only.

No haven't tried this recipe yet but am going to make it for tonight's dinner. I think the problem  with the oven temp is that the conversion from centigrade to Fahrenheit has been incorrectly  calculated The Fahrenheit setting should read 325*approx. hope this helps.----325= 160/170- 3- Moderate    3 being the gas temp
 Recipe sounds great to me.

Amazing!  I am a meatloaf lover and I have been reluctant to deviate from the recipe on the back of the bread crumb box, however this is the new standard.  I love the fact it has lots of veggies, which makes my wife very happy.  This is truly classic meatloaf.  I made Chef John's German potato pancakes, which was a first because I always make mashed potatoes with the meatloaf.  Another "crowd pleaser" to say the least.  This website has done more for my eating habits than any other website or magazine.  I am pleased with the quality of the recipes, especially Chef John's offerings.   As for cooking times, I did have to increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees because it wasn't cooking fast enough.  I also cut the recipe in half but I will make two meatloaves with the original recipe next time.

I think the recent reviews about the cooking time are very critical. Indeed, I am extremely appreciative of the time alterations as I cooked it at 350 for 1 hr 20 mins & a few minutes more wouldn't have overcooked it. That said, the ingredients & directions were great! I did use roasted red peppers & bottled shiitake mushrooms as that's what I had. I would repeat this going forward for sure. The added moisture can never hurt a meatloaf I think. Anyway, my husband & I loved it! I will definitely share my altered recipe & cook it again for us.

I have spent years searching for the perfect meatloaf and this is the best I have found.  It has wonderful flavor and is moist and holds together well without being tough.  I recommend watching the video as his suggestions are very helpful. I only had Italian seasoned breadcrumbs so I left out the Italian herbs. I also left out the cayenne pepper as a matter of personal taste. I made this into 2 loafs and wrapped and froze them for later use.  It froze well and baked up beautifully.

I shredded the carrot, celery and onion to help with chopping. This took no time at all. Put the garlic thru a press. Meatloaf was alittle salty, will cut back on salt and cayenne pepper next time. Cooking time was right on for me. I used a meat thremometer to be sure. I had wathced the video and I think shaping the meatloaf as directed in the video helped.

This needs to bake at 350 for total of 1 hour. Best meatloaf I've ever had. Have made it 6 times now. "Moist and magnificent," I would agree. The vegetables make it flavorful. I add 1/4 cup catchup and 1/4 cup honey or brown sugar to the loaf and double the glaze because we like it on the sweet side. We use ground turkey, and it's better than beef. But the original recipe is awesome, too, with longer cook time.

I made this recipe but used just ground beef, not ground chuck. Yes it took a lot longer to cook. It makes very good next day sandwiches as its nice and firm.
Very delicious!

It was my first-ever meat loaf. I didn't have a meat processor so I just chopped everything really tiny (of course that had to take a lot of time--so I skipped the carrots). But everybdoy just loved it. It was nice and moist and flavorful. Oh! I forgot to mention that I added half a pound of ground pork which I believe added to it being moist and flavorful too. And based on the other reviewers, I added more cooking time, around 20 minutes more.

Chef John does it again. This unique approach to meatloaf is perfect for me, because I live in a country where the beef is grass-fed and very lean (Mexico). I have tried various approaches to making meatloaf that does not taste like sawdust. This is it. Thank you, Chef John. I did use half the salt and half of the brown sugar in the glaze. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and I cooked it for about an hour. This is an excellent, healthy meatloaf, and we are looking forward to having sandwiches tomorrow.

This is a good basic recipe but my method is slightly different.
Process the first 6 ingredients to small chunky state. Then the 7 ingredients after the ground beef, go into a bowl & get mixed.  Then I put in the processed veggies, all the seasonings & eggs, etc & the ground beef and carefully & loosely mix it all together.  I want all the veggies and seasonings to be thoroughly mixed BEFORE I add in my meat.
Also, I use 1 egg/pound of beef. For 2-1/2 pounds, I would use 3 medium  eggs. For a glaze, I only use ketchup & Dijon mustard.

Great recipe except for the cooking time. I have been making meatloaf like this for years. Sometimes I use other vegetables like sweet potatoes or zucchini. I don't really think you can get the veg fine enough by chopping (unless you plan to chop for AGES). Before I had a food processor I used to grate them. Also if you use oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs it becomes Gluten Free.

I just made this recipe for my family and it was absolutely delicious.  The only difference was I used Ground Sirloin and left out the mushrooms.  The sauce on top I thought would be sweet, but the cayenne and dijon mustard take the sweetness out of the mix.  Would diffently make again.

This was an awesome recipe.  I was concerned because I did not have any eggs. So with a little research I found that some have used potato flakes or potato flour as a substitute in meatloaf. The ratio is 1 tablespoon per egg.  I put in potato flakes: 1 1/2 tbs and it turned out great.

Similar to another reviewer the ingredients didn't agree with me.  The uncooked onion and green pepper upset my stomach.  Other than that, or the next day it was quite good.

Not as good as I was hoping it would be. Plus cooking time way off.  To me this is not a classic meat loaf. Classic for me is how mom used to make it, way to many ingredients in this one to be considered a classic.

This is one of the best meatloafs I've ever had!!  I doubled the glaze recipe thinking the meatloaf may be a little dry but I was surprised to find that it was very moist and tasty.  It didn't need anything...it was great.

So delicious! I did not puree the vegetables, but I did cook them until tender in a skillet. I also used 1 lb ground pork, 1 lb ground beef to make it larger. This was very moist and tasty.

I Use my SLOW COOKER to cook this meatloaf and it is amazing! I do not add mushrooms, bell or Cheyenne pepper.  I also use a meatloaf mix (beef pork & veal).  I also do not add mustard to the glaze.  These are the only things I do different & that is due to my family's taste.  And if you think this meatloaf is good, you need to try chef johns meatballs-totally amazing!!!!!!

I would suggest to everyone to watch the video on this recipe since the cooking instructions are different than the printed recipe. The cooking time is stated to reach a temp of 155Â°, and he states up to 40 more minutes or longer depending on the size of your loaf and pan you use. I heavily rely on a cooking thermometer when it comes to cooking meat in the oven. After the 50 minutes at 325Â°, my temperature was at 136, so I baked for 15 more minutes, it was then 157Â°,  perfectly done in 1 hour 5 minutes. I always use a casserole dish with room on the sides in lieu of a loaf pan for meatloaf so the juices have some place to go instead of my oven floor.
I only gave four stars, because although the flavor was close to excellent and certainly a very nice moist meatloaf, it just wasn't juicy like we're used to more like mushy moist, it had quite a different type of texture. We don't mind little chunks of veggies, and if you're one than needs to hide your veggies, this is your recipe. I think I prefer to very finely chop the veggies and give them a quick saute then add into the meat. The glaze was a bit strong on the mustard flavor even after I added in more ketchup. I left all the hot stuff out. We all liked it, but all three of my guys said they liked mine better.

This was fairly easy to do and tasted pretty good but not FANTASTIC. The biggest problem I had with this is that after 45 minutes of cooking it was raw inside and the juices were running red. I kicked the oven up to 375 and cooked for another 30 minutes before it was cooked enough to eat. Actually the best part of the whole dish was the glaze.

Loved this!! I cut the servings in half to do this as I was only cooking for 4 people.  I didn't do the glaze and the only other thing I changed was that I didn't have mushrooms or bellpeppers.  I did all the other ingredients exactly as the recipe said. Tasted delicious and was a hit with the others that ate it! It was a bit more moist than I would like it to be, not sure why that was. Bumped the cooking temperature to 350 and ended up cooking it for about 50 minutes.

This was fan-frickin-tastic. Best thing I've made so far. My only tweaks were adding a little extra egg for better binding and I threw some BBQ sauce and steak sauce into the glaze, plus went about 25% more on the seasonings.

my husband and I are always trying to outdo each other with the better meatloaf recipe.  I think I have finally found the one!  the family really liked this recipe. I think the only change that I will make in the future will be to eliminate the cayenne (or reduce amount) and put BBQ sauce on top instead of the sauce in the recipe (or eliminate the hot sauce). I guess I don't like spicy meatloaf!  otherwise this is by far the tastiest meatloaf recipe I have found!  love the addition of all the veggies-they give great flavor!

This meatloaf was absolutely delicious, I love red pepper so I used a whole pepper. I cooked mine at 325 for about 45 minutes to an hour and it was done to perfection, I would not change anything else.  Some of the reviews stated that it took a lot longer, it may be due to the fact that you used a smaller pan I used my 10X15 pan, it all depends on how high the meatloaf is. on the cooking time. Thanks for the great recipe.

Love this recipe, it is my go to meatloaf recipe going forward. Really like the purÃ©ed vegtables in this dish. I made recipe as is with a few minor tweaks; made into 2 smaller loaves vs 1 large loaf, this way you can freeze one for a later dinner. I added 2 tablespoons of chili sauce to the glaze. I baked for 30 mins, then removed from oven and added glaze and cooked for another 45 to 50 minutes.

This is the 3rd time using this recipe. I LOVE IT!  It is so good! Cooking for one and this makes a big loaf, so I freeze a meal or two and give the rest away to friends and family. Everyone enjoys it. I  do increase the cooking temp to 350 for about an hour to an hour and 1/2...I start checking the meat temperature after about an hour. Thank You Chef John....its a KEEPER!!

After watching the video and reading many reviews, I made this meatloaf,and followed the recipe exactly. I shaped the meatloaf as written (6" x 4" high), cooked it for 15 minutes, glazed it, then stuck a thermometer in for the duration of cooking. Also, my oven thermometer verified that the oven temp was 325 degrees.  At the 35 minute mark, the meat thermometer registered 100 degrees.  In all, the cooking time to reach 155 degrees F was 1.5 hours. I let is rest until the thermometer registered 160 degrees, another 5 minutes.
The cayenne made it too hot for us, otherwise, it was a good (but not great) meatloaf. It is a good way to add veggies if you need to hide them, but for us, it was not worth the extra effort.

Have to say that my hubby and I both loved this recipe (we followed the higher cooking temp and longer cooking times) I do not eat meat and therefore have substituted veggie-ground-round* for the ground beef in my "meat loaf".  Both versions turned out beautifully! In order for the veggie meat to hold together I did use 2 eggs. I used fresh herbs; rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano and Italian parsley instead of the dried (I know you said "no substitutes" Chef John, BUT..I had to try) in both meat and meatless versions. Also, we do not own a food processor so I just finely chopped the veggies and this worked well (probably because of the longer cooking time). In some of the reviews people have omitted the glaze, but, I have to say that we really did enjoy it. My hubby isn't a saucy guy, but he is a true meatatarian and therefore loves all things meat. So, I lined the baking dish of the meat version with bacon. I would recommend that if you do this you should omit half of the salt in the recipe. The bacon will add the extra saltiness. Bon appetite!!!

This  meatloaf was  excellent!  Just the right texture, and loaded with veggies. I did change the sauce as others suggested. After it cooked for about 15 min. and it starts browning, pour off most of the fat,  then pour the sauce over top, and cook  for the remainder of time, which takes longer as other reviewers stated.   For the sauce I used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and mixed some catsup in to taste.  This will make more than needed, so cover the top of the meatloaf and use the rest as needed for leftovers.  Finish cooking till browned on top and no longer pink in the middle.. I put mine in a regular size loaf pan and another small loaf pan.  I also used 15/85 Ground chuck, and it was very moist.

Made this tonight, very tasty, easy  recipe to follow. Did increase temperature  and  cooking  time. Substituted ground oatmeal for bread, everything else the same. Made the twice baked potatoes  which also  came out terrific. Will make again.

My husband & I made this for supper tonight. We upped oven temp to 375 & baked it 1 hr total to get temp to 160 degrees. My husband is a meatloaf hound & couldn't get enough. Moist & seasonings were perfect. Definitely 5 stars & a keeper!

So tasty, moist and tender. For those of you that have been following Chef John for awhile: you should know that he underestimates cooking times quite often because I don't think that he accurately times anything outside of his perfect prime rib recipe. Just use an instant-read thermometer and remove the meatloaf from the oven when it reaches 155 deg F. The addition of pureed veggies to the meat was essential for making it so moist and the Sriracha sauce added the needed kick for the glaze. I have enough leftover meatloaf to make cold meatloaf sandwiches for awhile. YUM!

I altered it but it was amazing. This is the first meatloaf I have ever made. This chef made it so easy!! I made this in a smaller portion for just me and my boyfriend. I used 1.13lbs of ground beef, pork, and veal mixed. (Stop & Shop sells it that way as a meatloaf mix) I only used garlic, white onion and red bell pepper for veggies. I did not use italian seasoning. Instead I used italian style breadcrumbs. I cooked it at 350 for the times he said but had to add 15min to the end. So it took 15min, coat it with sauce, then 45min at 350 to cook through. And that was only 1.13lbs! So, yes, the time is off but whatever. All ovens are different so people should be checking their food anyway when following a recipe. The meat was SOOO MOIST! I believe thats from using a food processer to mince the veggies vs chopping them. This is super important. My picky boyfriend LOVED it and I loved it too! We ate the whole thing ourselves! Thanks to this chef, I mastered making meatloaf on the first try.

I tried this recipe for the first time, looking for something new. This recipe is without a doubt, a G R A N D S L A M!  I've made meatloaf before and never had it taste this good! This certainly a WOW for dinner. Even our four year old picky eater cleaned her plate.

I agree with other reviewers.  Not long enough bake time.  Should be 1-1/2 hrs. at 350/375.  I've not made this but liked the addition of all the veggies to give moisture and flavor.  I usually add ketchup or tomato sauce right in to the meatloaf ingredients...(it adds flavor but may need a little more crumbs to balance that extra moisture)

The addition of the vegetables made an incredible difference to a classic comfort dinner.  I have always made my meatloaf using the "onion soup mix" recipe.  My husband, however, had always loved his mom's meatloaf with lots of chunky veggies.  I found this recipe, and it made the best meatloaf using both styles.  I prepared the vegetables as Chef John suggests, then added them to the meatloaf recipe on the onion soup packet and cooked the loaf for the time recommended on the packet.  (No other ingredients or glaze.)  The results were wonderful; it was easily the best meatloaf ever.  The meatloaf was very moist and juicy, and had the most interesting flavor and texture.  I won't use any other method from now on; there is no comparison.  Hats off to Chef John for another wonderful technique!!

I ended up making two small portions instead of one. I thought the Dijon mustard was a bit over powering in the glaze sauce, next time I'm going to cut it in half and add more spice.

Super tasty! Cook time was off by a long shot, but it was worth the wait. Glaze was awesome. I used Crystal hot sauce for mine. Didn't have any Italian herbs so I used Italian bread crumbs instead. Also substituted chipotle pepper powder for cayenne. My new favorite meatloaf.

I LOVE meatloaf but my wife never let me cook meatloaf because she HATES meatloaf. I found this recipe and made it and now my wife requests it one to two times a month. The only thing I do differently is I add four slices of chopped raw bacon into the processor with the vegetables.

This recipe is Amazâballz!!!!!! Tonight is my 4th time and there isnât one thing I would change. I do make a second batch of the sauce minus cayenne powder for my mild flavored daughter. Anyone that has an issue with you cook temp and cook time, just use a thermometer. Itâll be done when itâs done. You want it faster, split into two loafâs or cook at a higher temp. All recipes that include temp and time are just a ball park estimate meant as a guide. Make adjustments as needed. No recipe is worthy of the Bible. Ha that book is also up for interpretation. ??????????????

The family loved it!  The veggies kept it from getting dry and gave it lots of flavor.  If a person is bothered by the gook that cooks out of it, slices of bread (even stale) can be placed under the meatloaf during cooking and discarded afterward.  Lining the pan with tinfoil also makes cleanup easier.

Just made this. I have made many meatloaf dinners and this is the best that I have made. It is moist, very flavorful and easy to make. 
The only thing I changed was the cook time. Cooked at 350 for 45 min with a convection oven .It came out moist ,and the internal temp. was 172.
Thanks CHEF.
Stu.

Once again , John guided this aging new cook to  making a great dish. I was forced to substitute honey for the brown sugar rock I had in my cupboard and left out the shrooms since my wife hates them. Other than that I followed the recipe and the meat loaf had great texture and flavor. It had just the right amount of zing to it but wasn't  too spicy hot. Will definitely be making again.

Excellent recipe. Will definitely be making it again. Even hubby says it's a keeper. I finely chopped the vegetables since we both like a little texture. I definitely  agree with everyone else, it definitely  needs more cooking time. The initial cooking time of 15 Mins.  I  increased to 30 mins. After spreading the glaze on I increased the cooking time from 45 min to 1 hour 15 Mins.

It's a great meatloaf, flavorful and very moist. I made a couple of changes. I didn't have Worchester so I used soy sauce. I also added red pepper flakes along with the other seasonings the recipe called for. The glaze I did exactly how stated and added a good amount of Tabasco ( we like spicy food). The only downside is that the cooking time is off. It is closer to 1 1/2 hours rather than 45 min. What really made this recipe great and different are the almost puree veggies.

We love this meatloaf!  I make it often. In the past,  I've even used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey but, I always substitute Stove Top Stuffing or croutons smashed up for bread crumbs. The last time that I made it, I didn't have mushrooms so, I threw a small zucchini in instead.  Delish!  Note: You do have to check it with a meat thermometer every 10 or 15 minutes after the initial 45 minutes.

Absolutely love, love, love this.  Doubled up on the sauce, but that's just personal preference. Served up with cheese and spring onion mash, mushroom gravy, and fine green beans. Can't wait to make it again. Thank you for sharing :)

The cooking time was off, otherwise thus was a great dish to trick my kids into eating more veggies than normal. I also added some zucchini as a bonus. Nice and moist!

Followed this recipe with everything except the mushrooms & bell pepper. The Italian herbs was a bit too much & the glaze, just using 3 drops of hotsauce, was awful.

Awesome... family loved it. Tender, juicy, very flavorful. I added more spices it called for, but I like spicy food. My husband is allergic to gluten, so i tried his gluten-free bread for the crumbs.  You don't need to cook them- the bread is dry & hard enough, but works great. (It's a good way to get rid of gluten-free bread u don't eat often & that tastes ucky, in my opinion!)  ;)  Only thing- cook longer than it says. :)

Made this evening.  Hubby loved it; I thought it a bit bland.  Maybe some more seasoning?  The texture was great!  I increased cooking time and made two smaller loafs.  Definitely needs the glaze to have some flavor.  Good base recipe but will add some things in the future to give it a bit more flavor.

A hit with the whole family! This was moist and full of flavor.  My loaf was 2 pounds but otherwise followed the recipe,  omitting the hot sauce.  it took about 1 1/4 hours at 325. Highly recommend!

Very tasty and I love the idea of the added "hidden" veggies. My fussy daughter has no idea she ate mushrooms, red peppers, and onions! As previous reviewers mentioned, I definitely had to increase cooking time. Baked at 325 for about 1.5 hrs. But depending on how you form the loaf, that can vary.

Great flavor so much better with the fresh vegetables as the flavoring in stead of some of the more prepared things. I made no change and it was perfect and moist.

Not my favorite meatloaf recipe. When in comes to a purely ground beef meatloaf, however, this pretty good. My husband didn't really care for it, I thought it wasn't bad but my mother and roommates loved it thus the four stars. My husband and I both think the glaze is too sweet. We'll probably keep looking for a new meatloaf recipe.

I reduced the amount of brown sugar (it was a little too sweet) and omitted the hot pepper sauce. I cooked it at 325 as it said but it was still very rare after 45 min. So instead I cooked it for another 40 min. Beside all of that, it was okay

Hip Hip Hooray!!!  My husband is the world's pickiest meatloaf eater.  His favorite meatloaf is Boston Market's.  I have tried a gazillion recipes (well, maybe not quite a gazillion).  Many friends have said, "Oh, I make REALLY good meatloaf... here's the recipe".  He didn't like any of them.  THIS RECIPE HE LIKES!!  I asked him if I should make it again and he said YES!  Thank you, Chef John.  You ROCK!

I basically halved the recipe because there's only two of us. I sauteed the pureed vegetables for a few minutes.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. 80/20 ground beef, 3 mushrooms, 1 clove garlic, 1 whole egg, a PINCH of McCormick's Italian Seasoning, no cayenne, seasoned bread crumbs AND a squirt of ketchup in the meatloaf mix. I reduced the mustard to about a teaspoon and added another squirt of ketchup after tasting.  Shaped it into about a 3x8 loaf and baked for 1 hour, 5 mins. total (internal temp 160).

As written, the cayenne is a bit too much.  Next time I will omit or decrease to 1/8 tsp.  I omitted the red pepper and mushrooms and increased the carrots, onions and celery.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.

Made this for the homeless shelter last night.  12 pounds of meat for 40 guys made into 4 loaves.  It was great.  The guys are always appreciative, but last night they said "thank you" with feeling.  One gentleman requested meatloaf 3 times a week.  I served the meatloaf with Chef John's mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.  Comfort food for sure.  I cut back a tad on the cayenne, pepper and salt, but otherwise followed the ingredient list very closely.  The food-processed veggies are a genius addition.  Baked in the oven for 1 1/2 hours and the meat loaves were perfect.  Thank you Chef John.

I love this recipe. Made it several times. And even though I don't like when people unnecessarily modify recipes, because then it's not the recipe given anymore. I have to say that I changed the cooking time on mine. Because you can't cook 2 1/2 lbs of raw ground meat in 45 minutes, without getting sick. The cooking time is closer to 90 minutes-to 1 hour 45 minutes. And it's still moist. Real comfort food for me and my family.

This meat loaf is delicious and I love the spicy zip to it!  I omitted onions & celery due to preference, cut the recipe in half, and made in a bread pan packed in.  Even though I halved the recipe, it still required the long end of the baking time (35-40 min) to get up to the needed temperature.  This will be my "go-to" recipe - husband loves it too!

Thanks to these reviews I knew exactly how to adjust the cooking temp and time in advance.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to exchange the brown sugar sauce for bbq sauce and to substitute 1/2 of the ground chuck for ground turkey.  It was a big hit with some very picky eaters !!!

After trying for a very long time to make the "perfect" meatloaf I stumbled upon a method similar to this. Mostly all the same ingredients. One difference is I use two pounds ground chuck and one pound ground pork. Also, I saute the veggies after they're ground in food processor adding the herbs since heating herbs brings out their flavor. I also used a bit of cumin and creole seasoning. But definitely use the veggies as listed here. Almost "perfect"!

This was delicious!! Very moist & flavorful. Very close to 5 stars. We followed what others did and turned up the temp to 350 degrees, and put it in for 25 min longer than the recipe called for.

Lots more trouble than our favorite meatloaf and not nearly the flavor. Guess I should just stick to the old standbys, but I do love to experiment. Anyone who has ever prepared a meatloaf would know this cooking time is way off.

Made this tonight for supper and it was a big hit....and even better was the fact that it was so quick and easy to make! The minced veggies made it very moist and tasty. I baked it for a total of 1 hr 15 mins at 325 degrees like others suggested. I will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I just got through eating this. The flavor was amazing, and it was perfectly moist and delicious... But I took the advice of everyone else, and cooked it at 325Â° for the first 15 minutes, then glazed it, and turned it up to 350Â° and cooked it for an additional hour. My whole family loved it.... And I also made the mushroom sauce that was mentioned in the video... It was killer!! :)

My mom made great meatloaf. Never the same each time. Mine was hit or miss. This recipe is perfect. Perfect consistancy, never crumbles and reheats well. Make your own tweaks for flavor but delicious as is. I  add fresh parsley to the veg blended in my food processor.

Very tasty, A little bit dry, so I highly recommend a little milk. I made this into two meatloaves, cooked @ 350 for 1 hour. Was delicious. I used a heaping tablespoon of preminced garlic. No mushrooms because I didn't have any, nor the carrots and celery. I have done it with them before and I do highly recommend it. I used one of the "stir fry" frozen Onion & Pepper mix. Very tasty!

I followed the directions exactly and the meatloaf was very mushy when it came out.  I thought it was the pureed veggies that did it.  I used fresh veggies too.  We did make the best of it and the entire thing did get eaten. I don't think I will make this again, unless I hear of a similar recipe that maybe solves this issue that a lot of people seemed to have.  I do like the idea of the veggies being in it.

O. M. G....the best meatloaf I've ever made!  Moist and a perfect balance of flavors.  If I stopped the review here, it would be correct, so this other stuff is just me...

I only used 2 lbs. of good quality ground beef - 80/20 blend.  Using only 2 lbs. of meat *may* have cut down on the cohesion factor, but it wasn't too bad.  I doubled the recipe for the glaze except for the brown sugar, which I halved.  I used half yellow mustard and half spicy brown (because I didn't have Dijon).  I used Crystal's hot sauce, but only a little.  It turned out great.  It really is very important to get the vegetables "finely chopped, almost to a puree" because this is the key to a lot of the flavor and the moisture.  If your food processor is up to the job, that's great, but I had some pieces that didn't get chopped as well and and stuck them in there anyway.  That was a mistake.  (Hate food processors!  I guess they're a necessary evil for some things...)    I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and cooked this for 1 hr, 15 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!  Can't wait for the sandwiches I'll make later this week.

Made a different recipe for a meatloaf last Sunday, but made this glaze and it was truly wonderful.   Made my meatloaf in a tin and the glaze gave the juice from the loaf a really lovely taste.

I wish I would have read the reviews.  The cooking time was off so I put it back in the oven at 350 for another 30 minutes.  Next time I would omit the bell pepper which I usually love. I would also eliminate the cayenne pepper that my husband was not fond of. I think the dijon mustard was slightly over powering so I will only use 1 T next time.  We needed it to be gluten free so we omitted the bread crumbs and ground up some Trader Joe's Gluten Free oatmeal.  It wasn't a hit with my kids this time but I'll try it again with the above changes.

This was thumbs down for me :( This recipe called for a lot of ingrediants and was very time consuming. Not a good recipe for a busy Mom. I thought I would make the effort for my son's sake....to get some healthy veggies in his diet. Did'nt work out.

Good. Tastes very Italian, which is different than meatloaf I'm used to. I added a lot more ketchup for the sauce, which I think was necessary. There was WAY too much liquid in it when it was done. Poured MOST, but not all of it out to keep some for moisture sake. Don't know if that was even necessary to keep any.

This recipe was great. Added few more mushrooms and a little extra spice, but otherwise followed the directions (and video) exactly. I used about 3 lbs of mixed lean ground beef and turkey, made two loaves and froze one for another night. I cooked one 1.5lb loaf for about 50 minutes at 375. The glaze was so-so, I might have used a little too much ketchup though. I would definitely make this again!

Bake time is way off. Takes closer to 2 hours.

I'm never rated a recipe or anything else for that matter but I gotta say this changed my go to meatloaf recipe forever!
The only change was to replace Â¼ of the beef with ground pork, only out of necessity, it's what I had.
I had to keep it in the oven a little longer than suggested but that was to please certain guests ;)
Thanks Chef John, I use a lot of your recipes!

Skipped the glaze, had to cook longer than recipe stated (not the big deal for me as it is for others), best meatloaf I ever made, and if I have had better, it been such a long time ago I can't recall it.

I really enjoyed this recipe and I noted in the comments the disparity in estimated cooking time versus actual cook time. I did not have this problem but the shape of mine wasn't nearly as thick, only about as high as the width of my hand (basically child size fyi). I learned from my mother to always put an indent in the middle of meatloaf for more even cooking as well, that made a huge difference. The indent was roughly half an inch deep and ran down the middle, leaving the full height of loaf on the entire perimeter. I put the loaf in for the initial 15 minutes and then glazed it with equal parts, brown sugar, dijon, and chili sauce and only a tiny squirt of ketchup. The sweetness of ketchup can be overwhelming and the zing of chili sauce contrasted nicely with the sugar. It was only in the oven for another 20 minutes, 35 in total. I let it rest as I was finishing my potatoes and it was perfect. Juicy, and only the barest touch of pink in the thickest spots. Unfortunately no pictures, but the uncooked loaf was probably 7.5-8 inches wide and about two thirds the length of a 13x9 pan to give an idea of why my cook time was so limited. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

I read reviews, watched the video then followed the recipe except for the glaze. I changed ketchup from 2 to 3 tablespoons, mustard from 2 to 1, and a little less sugar. I followed instructions exactly as given. My meatloaf cooked perfectly. It was moist and the texture was perfect. Rating could be 5, gave 4 because the amount for vegetables is not a measurement. I wondered if the amount of vegetables I used was correct. Think I'll try more next time. The recipe is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe, very moist but held together.
I used my Italian gravy that I had on hand, as a topping.  I also threw in three big Calabrese sausages to spice it up.
On Keto so used gluten free panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.
This is now my go to meatloaf tecipe.

This was so tasty! I am going 2 weeks without bread and pasta to see what I notice so I needed some good recipes. I left out the flour and added 1 small Zucchini to the veggie list and 2 eggs instead of one. I baked it 1 Â½ hrs at 350 because of the comments I saw and it turned out perfectly. My whole family gobbled it up. Will definitely make it again

A little too spicy!
I will reduce the cayenne pepper next time. 
I did not have a good processor   So the shredded carrots stayed along with the diced peppers and onion. 
Will have to re think this recipe next time.

Made it with Chef Johnâs Mushroom Gravy and some mashed potatoes on the side. Delicious! Did what everyone else did and baked at 350 for about an hour and it was perfect!the cayenne pepper does add a little kick as your eating. Iâll probably omit next time since my family isnât a fan of spice, but overall we loved it!

I didn't have all of the ingredients listed but did chop and add sweet bell peppers and onions. For spices I used 1T of Essence and chopped garlic. I also used Italian spiced panko bread crumbs and it turned out great! Highly recommended meatloaf!

I made this last night in my 3 qt Instant Pot. I had to do it in two batches. I used paprika for the cayenne and oatmeal for the bread crumbs. I added a little bit of garlic powder to boost the garlic flavor since I couldn't smell it. Since I used 93% ground beef, I added a bit of light olive oil. 
The first half I cooked plain. I had it for dinner last night with ketchup on top. It was pretty good and will make good sandwiches later. Need sourdough for it though. 
The second half, I made a glaze out of 2 T Ketchup, 2 T Dijon mustard, 1 T Baby Rays Hickory & Brown sugar BBQ sauce and a short T of Worcestershire sauce. I spread it on top before cooking and refrigerated once cooled. 
The second batch was dinner tonight. And WOW! I don't know if the second batch will survive the night for freezing for later.  The difference between the two was amazing, if I do say so myself.

It was dry,  unappetizing, and bland and didn't even add the bread crumbs.  If I did it again, I would add eggs and mayonnaise to the mix (I know that will horrify the fat phobes in the audience).

I agree with others in that the cooking time was wayyy off!

I usually love Chef John's recipes, but this one was a dud for me and my family. My 12-year-old wouldn't eat it. My husband ate it, but asked me not to make it again. Sorry John!

Great recipe! Very flavorful,  very moist. I didnât have any issues with the oven temperature. My loaf was lower than in the video, 9x6x2-1/2â,  my baking time was 15 mins, then sauce, then 45 minutes. At that point the temp of the meat was 170. I think itâs very unfair when people take off 4 stars because THEIRS didnât come out when baked at the temps given. Everyoneâs oven is different.
I will say that itâs a little labor intensive with all the chopping and the use of the food processor, but it was definitely worth it. My husband said that didnât even need catsup because it was so flavorful.
This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

First, I made this recipe with elk; because I could.  Got it at our local Safeway.  It turned out great; not like venison in any way.  The texture was superb and the subtle flavors excellent.  The prep time was very reasonable although I am no fan of cleaning the food processor.  Best of all, my wife rated it an "A" without condescending remarks.  She could not tell it was elk, had peppers (which she does not like) or had a Dijon mustard glaze.  It certainly makes enough for 6, and maybe more.  Also makes a great leftover, which is what meatloaf is famous...

At 325Â°, this took close to an hour and a half to cook.  After 40 minutes I turned the oven up to 400Â° so it could cook faster.  Didn't add in all of the vegetables, but I did mince fresh onions.

Loved this!!!  I made a 1/2 recipe (only had 1 lb beef) and it was amazing. I love the flavor! I love all the veggies in it! Cooked in 45 minutes at 375.  Did not use the glaze, my family does not like anything sweet with meat.

This is a great tasting meatloaf.  I made this in combination with Chef John's mushroom gravy.  I didn't use the glaze, but I will next time.  The whole family loved it.

Kept to the original recipe. Came out great!  Made sure the height was only two inches high so that the cooking time was about 50-55 minutes. And it worked perfectly

Very first time i made a meatloaf and everyone loved it. I baked it for an hour and 45 minutes. Since I donât like celery, I didnât put any but it turned out to be really good. The glaze, so perfect!!!

This meatloaf gets 5 stars because it was moist and flavorful!  I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil until tender  before adding it to the meat.   I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just added a 1/4 tsp each of basil, parsley flakes, garlic powder, celery salt and thyme.  Wow! This is a seriously delicious meatloaf!

This came out super good.  I didn't put the topping on it, that was all.  Hubby wanted bell pepper in it, so next time I will do that.  I did go with the 350 degrees and it took a good hours and 20  mins.  But I was using my toaster oven.  Great recipe.

Delicious! My picky five-year-old even asked for seconds! I didn't have enough ground beef so I blended in ground turkey, which turned out to be quite tasty. I suggest doubling the glaze. The recipe as-is didn't yield enough of it. This one is a keeper. Manga!!

I can't believe people quibble over the cooking time for this amazing moist meatloaf. It does take more than 30 - 40 minutes but put your meat thermometer in it as the note at the end of the recipe says and let that tell the tale. I added some catsup to the meatloaf itself because I think that pops up the flavour a bit. This is my standard go-to meatloaf from now on.

I was drinking...   and didnât read where you had to make a glaze.  That being said... I put it ALL together in a bowl and it was amazing!   What an awesome recipe!  Using our ninja to purÃ©e all the veggies definitely added to the flavor!  The combination of all the flavors was perfect.  As to cooking time, we are at 3,500 elevation so we always add cooking time to recipes.

Everyone in the family loved it. It was moist and had a great texture. It did take quite a bit longer to bake than the instructions said. Other than that, I made it exactly as the recipe said.

Added some Pepper Jack cheese, micro planed 3/4s of a cup. added to the mix with the bread crumbs. I'd give it 4.5 stars. I think if I had cooked it to the 170 mark instead of the 160, say 5 min, longer than the 40 it would have been a 5 star.

When I mention "meatloaf for dinner", the enthusiasm isn't necessarily at the top of excitement level--Until Now! This recipe & way of putting together a meatloaf turned out beyond Fantastic! I didn't have mushrooms & mixed in a can of hatch green chili peppers as didn't have a bell pepper on hand. Everything from Chef John has been a hit & this one is now at the top of the request list from the family!

It was delicious! my family loved it.
It is moist and full of flavor.
I made it in a rectangular glass recipient, not in a loafl form.
Gravy is delicious too.

I have to confess I did change the recipe but the result was awesome.  My changes were: I used Anaheim pepper instead of red bell pepper, and I added a little turkey ham and a little bacon (raw).  Finger-licking good!!!

Pro tip: those that had issues with cook time and temp, most likely didnât watch the video... where it was explained that the meatloaf should be placed in a wider pan , not a loaf pan, 4 inches high & 6 inches wide

This was the worst meatloaf I've ever made and actually choked down. I actually made it into 12 large meatballs and baked it in a 9x13 pan, though. It was strangely moist (to the point of wondering, "Is this totally cooked?"....so I did bake it for additional time, just in case). The Italian seasoning ruined it, though. I think without that, it would have been tasty although too moist. My husband said he liked it, but I think he was just trying to be nice. I ate it only to not be wasteful of all the meat and other ingredients, but did not like it at all (and I am not a crazy, picky eater, either). I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans. I will try making this again sometime WITHOUT the Italian seasoning. The glaze: I made it was jalapeno mustard (not dijon) because I did not have dijon. The jalapeno mustard spiced it up, so I did not have to use hot sauce. It was pretty good, especially after I put the meat with the sauce on it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. I tripled the glaze recipe since I made the meatloaf mixture into meatballs.

Chef John wins with me again with this fantastic meatloaf recipe!  I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  I also found it freezes well once cut into individual serving slices.  I'll be making it again today, but this time I'll be mixing in some ground turkey or chicken to cut down on the fat, and trying sriracha instead of tabasco (hot pepper) in the glaze.

Good.. second time making it. Didnât add the cayenne pepper and the glaze just made it with the ketchup and brown sugar.. I like it better that way. Cooking time for me is about an hr and 10 mins. Figured that out after a couple of tries

I used sriracha instead of ketchup and hot sauce because I didn't have any. I also only had a cookie sheet and tried to make a heart shaped so it came out a little lopsided. I only used 2 lbs of beef, and don't have a food processor, so I minced the veggies as best I could and it came out a little heavy on the vegetables. Delicious. Will definitely make again.

Honestly, I feel bad giving this 2 stars, but it really was not a great meatloaf for us.  There was too much vegetable flavor, and the glaze was not great either.  It was moist, though.

Made this instead of buying premade  and was easy and delicious.  I did use 1/2 of Italian sausage for more flavor.

I almost never digress from Chef John's recipes because they are always so spot on. The only thing I did differently was to go to my fab local butcher and get their meatloaf mix which was a combo of ground beef and ground pork. He told me that it was already seasoned so I added no spices except a tad of cayenne. The primary reason I make meatloaf is to chop it up in my homemade marinara for our spaghetti night. This recipe made plenty of leftovers for sammies. For those of you experienced cooks who complained about the cooking time, you really need to remember to use your instant read meat thermometer and ignore the recommended cooking times. Ovens are all different... your oven may not be perfectly calibrated, or you may be using the convection setting which changes the cook time. This changes cooking temperatures. Using a thermometer makes a world of difference between and undercooked and an overcooked meat dish. For newbie home cooks, seriously, get an instant-read thermometer and use it for all dishes that contain meat. I use the Thermoworks Thermopop. It never fails me. I cooked this dish to 160 in my Breville Smart Oven (made 2 meat loaves instead of one) and the cook time was an hour. Don't go over the 160 because it continues to cook once it comes out of the oven (tented with foil). Seriously incredibly recipe... it was worth the time to drag my food processor out. The flavor blew me away.

WONDERFUL! If you don't have a food processor don't fret! I used a blender and while not easy to achieve the finely minced texture called for,  the chunky carrots still manage to cook down and blend just fine into the meat loaf. I took the advice of others and baked it at 350 for at least an hour and a half (didn't time it, just knew when it was done). I had small eggs so used two. Also, as others said, i used one tablespoon mustard instead of two and added a little soy sauce and extra hot sauce in the glaze. It was an amzing meat loaf. It had a fine smooth moist texture almost like pate. I am so-so about meatloaf but this one's going to be a repeat offender!!~~

Doubled up on carrots, celery, onion, pepper and garlic and used 4/5 a lb more ground beef.  Also doubled Worcestershire  sauce.  My family loved it.  It made enough meatloaf for 8 adults who like a little spice in their food.  Great!

My granddaughter made this for her in laws and she said they enjoyed it a great deal. She gets along with them really well already, but now they want to be dinner guests more often. I thought that was hilarious. She says thanks for that recipe. Going to have to get her to sign up herself before she burns my tablet up on my account lol.

I didn't use a food processor for veggies, just chopped up very finely. This recipe is a great way to get my kids to eat more vegetables, because they're chopped so small they don't notice them!

No no no. The cooking time/temp is way off. Otherwise a great meatloaf if you cook this properly.  Dang chef John, what is up the raw meatloaf?
I use my own homemade ketchup for this 'glaze'. I also sub smashed up pork rinds for the bread crumbs as I'm a low carb person. Works just fine. I also skip the carrot and add few more of my own spices to suit my own taste.
Anyway, I start this huge meatloaf on 425 for 15, then drop to 375 for at least an hour. Let it rest for 10 and it's great. I like rare steak but not meatloaf...LOL. ugh.

I wish I liked this more, but I didnât like that that the Worcester sauce was distinct and 3 cloves of garlic was too much.  I also wasnât  crazy about all the Dijon, it was also distinct.  I wish the flavors had melded more than stand out.  
I think the basic recipe is good, but if I make it again Iâll use less Worcester, less garlic and less Dijon.  .

Of course!  If you want the definitive take on the classics, nobody does it like Chef John.  Even better, Chef John has a wonderful instinct for unexpected, off-the-beaten-path ingredients and modifications that take a classic from ordinary to awesome.  One of the biggest problems with homemade meatloaf is that home cooks get discouraged by the result when it doesn't jibe with their memories of the best ones they've had:  Mom's or Grandmom's or Aunt Lil's.  Creating the iconic meatloaf can seem like an insurmountable challenge.  In fact, it's easy-peasy, and Chef John shows you how with his usual flair for designing accessible and direct techniques that don't require a lot of fussing, pre-prep, or advanced knowledge of techniques.  My spouse always thought I made the best meatloaf he'd ever had ... until I made Chef John's.  Thanks, John!  I think ... :)

Not sure why this fabulous dish was rated poorly because of cooking time, so it takes longer to cook...who cares! The meatloaf is absolutely fabulous and my kids who have hated meatloaf their whole lives sure liked this one! My boyfriend who has only worshiped his motherâs version likes this one better, so Iâll take it. I added equal amounts of Italian sausage and upped the veggies, especially the mushrooms which all I had were baby portabellas. The hot sauce in the glaze adds a phenomenal kick and all I can say is that the flavor explodes in this. It does not taste like tomato-ey hamburger shaped in a loaf. Try it, you wonât regret it!

Finally!  A meatloaf that doesn't taste like a giant hamburger patty!  This is really, really tasty.  Even my 4-year-old who "doesn't like meatloaf" had two helpings.  The only changes I made were to delete the Cayenne pepper.  My family doesn't like spicy.  In the sauce I used dry ground mustard (1/4 tsp), as one reviewer recommended instead of Dijon.  My kids don't like Dijon and the dry mustard did the trick.  This is our family's go-to meatloaf.  Thanks, Chef!

I made this recipe almost as written and scaled it up for the crowd I was feeding.  I used 2/3 ground beef and 1/3 ground chicken, and also used panko instead of breadcrumbs (since I was out of breadcrumbs).  I used Peri Peri as the hot pepper sauce requested in the glaze.   I also used a longer cook time, and increased the temp to 375 degrees for the last part of the cook, mainly because I had increased the size of the loaf from the original recipe.  The meatloaf was moist and extremely flavourful.  I fed 4 adults and 6 teenagers and every single one of them LOVED it.  I made the recommended mushroom gravy with it as well as garlic mashed potatoes.  There were leftovers immediately after dinner, but they were long gone by morning...

3.28.18 Since I only wanted enough for meatloaf sandwiches today, I cut the recipe in half and baked in a mini-loaf pan for about 42 minutes @ 350ÂºF.  I did omit the mushrooms and used chili sauce in place of the ketchup in the glaze.  It was plenty moist and made a darn nice sandwich.

I made this and it turned out marvellously.  I do however have to say that I do consider chef John to be my spirit animal.  Having said that, I felt the need to post a comment on here about the other critics.  I believe the benefit of reviewing a recipe is to help others decide if the food is tasty or not, if it is worth the effort to make in the first place.  Chef John clearly states that the cook times will vary and points to an instant read thermometer as a means of assessing the readiness of the final product.  So even an inexperienced cook can, for 10$ to purchase an instant read thermometer, follow his cooking instructions which are just as important as the ingredients themselves.  Rating a recipe 1 star is more likely to cause people to pass on it, than the amount of people who would errantly not follow the cooking instructions in the first place...?  Rate the food prepared as explained by the poster perhaps?  I would hate for individuals to miss out on something delicious because youâre afraid they may or may not follow the correct cooking instructions...

Turned out fantastic! I increased to 3# and divided in half to making 2 loaves. They were moist and the glaze made it even better!  I also put in 2 eggs.

The ingredients and amounts are perfect. I add a can of Rotel no salt, use oatmeal when out of bread crumbs. Also the temp and time is off. To adjust, I made four small loaves on a sheet pan. Bake 15 min at 375. Glaze a little. 15 minutes at 350. More glaze then only 15-20 minutes itâll be done

This Meatloaf was Simply Delicious.. The best meatloaf I ever made.  If I could rate it with more stars I would. It had the right amount of spice I did add a little  mustard and chili sauce and then I added the chili sauce on top but you can make it your way.  delish I definitely cooked it longer and I turn the oven up at 350.

I usually make a recipe EXACTLY like written the first time.  It annoys me when I find a well-rated recipe and read the reviews only to find people rating the recipe based on all of their changes.  I made this as written, with the exception of using half ground beef and half ground pork.  Seasonings were perfect and cooking times were very close (I checked internal temp with my Thermapen).  The only meatloaf Iâll make from now on.

  Well done Chef!  Thanks for another stellar recipe :)

Great "classic" meatloaf recipe if you ask me.  I had no idea adding in the vegetables made such a difference.  He's right, if you don't add the vegetables it's just a big hamburger.

I'm personally not a fan of ketchup-based toppings on meatloaf so I altered this just a bit - but my personal preferences didn't (and shouldn't) affect the rating.  So the next time I make this, which will be soon, I'm going to omit the topping.  It's just not needed IMO and makes it too sweet.

Tasted slightly salty to me so I recommend cutting that back just a bit.  You can always add salt if you need it - hard to remove though.

I served this over mashed potatoes along with a homemade mushroom gravy (also by Chef John).  Wife doesn't like mushrooms so I may do just a normal beef gravy next time.  

The only other alteration I recommend is once it's done and cooled, finish by browning both sides in a skillet with butter.  This gives it a nice crust that I think makes a big difference.  Plus you can make the meatloaf ahead of time and quickly sear it when ready to serve.

Followed to the recipe but changed 325 to 350 and it took about an hour and a half.  Best bet is to use a thermometer wonât guide you wrong :). Almost ate the whole thing lol

I'm not a huge Meatloaf fan, however, my husband is.  I decided to give this a try last night and my husband said this was one of the two best meatloafs he's ever had. I thought it was pretty good-for meatloaf. LOL I did have to increase my cook time but since I was forewarned by other reviews I allowed myself a bit of extra time just in case.  I served this with mashed potatoes and Chef John's Mushroom Gravy and it was PERFECT.  Will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  That is it's the first time I have ever made a meatloaf that did not fall apart.   Adding the vegetables is what makes the flavor really pop.  The only change I made was an extra clove of garlic just because we love the flavor.

The basic recipe was excellent.  However, I did make several modifications. First I took the purÃ©ed vegetables and sautÃ©ed them 10 minutes in olive oil to soften the flavor. Secondly, I increased the eggs to 2 and added 1/4 cup of milk to ensure the meatloaf would be moist. Lastly, I modified the sauce for the top: 1 tbsp dry mustard powder, 2 tbsp of brown sugar, and 4 tbsp of ketchup added to the top of the loaf after 30 minutes of cook time. As other reviewerâs have noted, the cooking time is off considerably. With the amount of meat prescribed in the recipe, it will take approximately an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and 30 minutes to completely cook. My recommendation is to use a remote internal meat probe and set the temperature to 155Â° and remove the meatloaf from the oven and loosely cover it with aluminum foil for 10-15 minutes to allow the the juices to redistribute.  With all of these modifications the meatloaf came out absolutely tasty. My family loved it and wants me to make it again for dinner in the near future. Thanks Chef John!

The ingredients are FABULOUS, However if you are a new cook, or as I am an experienced cook, the cooking time is way off. ...... I made. 2lb. Meatloaf, which I placed on tin foil, sprayed with non stick spray for 2 1/2 hour and it was done to perfection. Iâm sure this is a slip up from the submitter.
I would have given it a 4 , but the time is way off. Thank you for Sharing your recipe.

I made it as written. It was flavorful and had a wonderful texture- tender but not falling apart. I did not think the glaze was too sweet.

And yes, it needs longer to bake.

Made the meatloaf as per CJâs instructions pretty well to the letter. The cooking times were perfect to yield a tender, moist meatloaf full of flavour. The meatloaf was accompanied by creamed potato, CJâs perfect sprouts (see recipe), left over sweet potato and  CJâs mushroom gravy (see recipe).
All in all, a great plate of food, would definitely repeat the exercise.

The almost pureed veggies added the extra moistness, as advertised. I did not have mushrooms and (forgot the garlic) so I used a bit more of the other veggies. I was hoping the lower temperature would make the loaf hold together better than my usual experience. But this one had major fissures too. I might try a leaner burger next time (mine was 80/20). I shaped the loaf as in the video - 3 1/2" x 5" x very long. It was done after the 15 minute then 40 minute cook time suggested. I love the traditional glaze with yellow mustard, so used that but then added 1 1/2 tbsp. sriracha sauce as in the video. That was the highlight of the recipe for me. I'll be using it all the time.

I exclude mushrooms cuz my family doesn't like them.  I also shred the veggies on my mandolin, which seems to work really well. The kids never find chunks of veggies they won't eat.  Everyone loves the sauce, so simple but so much better than just ketchup.  I've also made the mixture into burgers and cooked them on the grill for summer nights when it's too hot to turn the oven on. Also with that much meat, it takes almost 2 hours to fully cook. But this is mine and my families favorite meatloaf recipe.

I really did not like this.  I followed it to the tee!  No modificatons.  Too much cayenne pepper to let other flavors out.  I did like the glaze.  I threw away 2.5 lbs of ground beef.

I didn't have mushroom, so I doubled the egg. I tried with 2 lbs of ground beef instead of 2 1/2 lbs. After the first 15 min., I baked 50 more min. I didn't grease my baking pan since the ground beef produced lots of fat later on. Those are the changes I did. My meatloaf tasted delicious. My hubby and my kids liked it. I will definitely tried this recipe again. Thank you Chef John and allrecipe.com.

This was one of the most flavorful and moist meatloaves I've made.  I made sure to buy really good meat.  I wasn't really exact about the amount of veggies, and I made a purÃ©e of them because I was too lazy to chop them so finely. I tried not to over mix the meat and I think that helped make it very tender.  I shaped the meat mixture into TWO loaves and placed them in a large shallow baking dish.  I doubled the amount of sauce and slathered it on about 20 minutes into the cooking time.  I also added more catsup and less Dijon mustard to reduce the strong mustard taste simply because my family does not care for mustard flavor.  Total cooking time was 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees.  Meat temperature was just at 165.  I let it rest before cutting as was suggested in the video.  I will definitely to back to this one for the red meat lovers in the family.

I can always count on Chef John - made it pretty much to a T only I didn't have Italian spices so I combined what I did have. Texture, everything - great. Like others, it definitely needed more cooking time and I think the next time I make this, I'll put the oven to 350.

After 40 years of cooking for family and friends, this is IT!  I have found the meatloaf recipe of my husband's dreams!!  I followed the basic recipe to a T.  I made some minor changes as follows:
I purÃ©ed the veggies separately first then combined together for one last pulse.  (Yes, I know I'm OCD! :)  I omitted the red pepper because I did not have one around and did not miss it.   I also substituted a small amount of pork for some chuck because the package at the store came that way.  It was fine, but no major changes, I am sure.  The GLAZE!!  So, so good!!  We loved it.  I did not put in any hot sauce.  To finish it off, I made it Metro Diner Style (Jacksonville, FL) by adding a wee bit of butter in an iron skillet and gently browned each side before serving with a spoonful of mushroom gravy.  This was excellent.  I will definitely make it again.  BTW:  Because there are just two of us, I made the whole recipe and divided it in half putting one in the freezer for another treat!!  I also baked it as described, but turned the heat up to 350 F as I was also baking mac and cheese.  So, so good!!

My husband LOVES this meatloaf and he grew up hating meatloaf.  He would never let me make it for dinner.  However, after tasting this meatloaf, it's the only one he'll eat.  
The only change I made to this recipe is I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork; and I put sliced mushrooms around the pan while baking.  I then used the mushrooms and drippings to make a mushroom gravy. Delicious!!!

I love this meatloaf recipe and I've made it numerous times. My husband never liked the old "traditional" recipe of meat, onion, and bread because it was lackluster and never seemed to stay together even with the addition of egg. This recipe on the other hand always comes out moist and holds its shape. I don't always have all the veggies on hand but I just use what I have and have never been disappointed. The glaze is great, more of a sweet and spicy, nice twist on the classic catsup or BBQ sauce, and you can always adjust to your taste or omit altogether if you roll like that. The cooking time is definitely off, I cooked at 325Â°(f) on convect which is equivalent to 350Â° (f), for one hour 15 minutes total. One day I'll get around to trying this with Chef John's mushroom gravy, his recipes never let me down.

The only item I do not add is celery. I have been making this meatloaf forever and we LOVE it!
Every time I serve it everyone LOVES it.
A homerun!

One thing,  I make no more than 1.5 lbs. and cook at 375 degrees as it will not cook in the time stated. No biggie just a minor adjustments. If you guys cook you know it will take longer based on how much meat you use and how you shape it. I tend to flatten it versus making it into a ball. Mu preference.

I followed the recipe totally.  Very moist and tasty, much enjoyed, and will use this recipe from here on.  Living alone I made three small loaves rather than the one prescribed, and even then had enough of one meatloaf left for another meal and a sandwich.  Froze the other two for future use.

I only had to cut back on the cayenne because my husband doesn't like spicy....but this was a moist and delicious meatloaf.

However I had to cook it longer than the recipe suggested.

thumbs up to Chef John

I always made the dish as written by the author the first time and did the same with this recipe. I have to admit it was a little disappointing. We did not care for the glaze. It was way too sweet and just clashed with the flavor of the meat. The veggies did make the loaf less dense, and they do not interfere with the taste. Overall, it was an ok meatloaf. I've always loved Chef John's contribution so this was just a little less than his usual.

Excellent - stays together, remains moist, and very tasty - and the vegetables make it a little healthier than most, though they don't interfere with the taste!  Will definitely make again and eat the leftovers tomorrow :)

I used 1 lb and it baked perfectly in 45 so larger amounts probably take longer.  Also, while I didn't pull out the food processor, I grated the vegetables and then simply finished the cutting with a rocking cut - took about 5 minutes for all the vegetables to be cut - no problem.

I used ground elk and cooked it until the internal temp was 140Â° F. In spite of the lower final temp, it still took about an hour at 325Â° but I wouldn't rate the recipe itself on that technicality. I read the complete instructions ahead of time, including the notes, and expected a longer cooking time.

This meatloaf was amazing. I did increase the cooking time since I put it in a large loaf pan- 350 degrees for 90 minutes but otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I can't believe how moist the vegetables made the finished product. The glaze on the top was delicious too. I had lots left to freeze- that was part of my goal. I am sure this will be just as tasty reheated.

Made this for family over the holidays and it was good.  My grandsons said it was not as good as their mom's mratloaf.  It was made as recipe written but not a big hit.  Will probably not make again.

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half. I used 1 lb. extra lean ground beef & kept the onion, garlic, egg & bread crumbs according to the recipe. I used 1/2 Panko & 1/2 Italian bread crumbs. I used green & red pepper plus fresh parsley & added more garlic. Instead of plain salt, I used onion, garlic & Seasoning salts & added dry parsley, oregano & thyme. We love seasonings. It really was delicious. Double the glaze, it's great to use as a spread when  making sandwiches with the leftovers. With the recipe cut in 1/2 I still followed the same cooking time & it was perfect.

This was a very good meatloaf. My husband loved it and he made the comment that any meatloaf without shaved carrots is a good meatloaf! :-)  The secret was in almost pureeing all of the vegetables so he didn't know they were there.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used sugar free jelly and extra hot sauce in place of the brown sugar  to make this more diabetic friendly.

First time I ever made a meatloaf! 
Didn't have a food processor or. blender so I just finely chopped up alll the vegitables. 
My sculpting skills needs to be fined tuned!

I had to add an additional 15 minutes to the cooking time as well. 

The best part was the glaze.

I made it and it came out very good.  My family enjoyed it and liked the carrots also. It was a firm and moist meatloaf. I will make again but it does need more cooking time. So I cooked it a little longer and it was perfect

loved it...did not use cayenne or dijon ,mustard...next time I will shred carrots and mince the red pepper,,,looked very good...took double the time to cook...or longer ..I used an actual loaf pan to cook the Meatloaf in...and substituted the dijon for regular mustard...so yummy there were barely any leftovers...I made mashed potatoes with whip cream, butter and an egg to go with the meatloaf...

I've made meatloaf for years, but never thought it was memorable. This recipe is! I had my neighbors over for dinner (it makes a lot of meatloaf), and it was hit with everyone.  The vegetables make a huge difference (I was skeptical at first), and the glaze is so yummy.  I made Chef John's "perfect" mashed potatoes to go with it and we all had seconds.  Try it - you'll love it.

My husband loves meatloaf, but I was finding all my recipes bland and boring and a pile of mush on the he serving plate. I chose your Classis Meatloaf because of the interesting ingredients. I made the meatloaf and both my husband and I were thrilled. Taste was a little tangy and zesty. I added a small can of green chiles and made the best meatloaf my husband and I have ever had. I will definitely make this again!!!

My family loves this recipe! I used brioche breadcrumbs the first time we made it (that's what I had on hand) and like that flavor best. For the topping, I have made it as written and swapped the honey mustard for a horseradish mustard, and we all agree the zing of the horseradish mustard is best.

Great supper for a cold winter night! I had all the ingredients on hand except brown sugar for the glaze. Used maple syrup instead - came out perfectly. Agree that cook time is a bit longer than recipe suggests but otherwise this one is a keeper.

This was an awesome recipe.  I found it to be a hearty meatloaf that holds together well.  I loved the robust flavor paired with the sweet glaze.  I also loved how quick and easy it was to chop everything together in my little hand chopper.  Since there are only 3 people in our family, I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount for us.  We did omit the mushrooms and substituted the dijon mustard with yellow mustard, as we didn't have these ingredients, but it was still awesome.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time - it took about an extra 20 minutes to cook.

Cook time for me was 70 minutes (after the glaze was added) so a total of 85 minutes. My son and wife liked it a lot. My daughter was ok with it, which is the real victory.

Had to cook 30 minutes longer to get to 160 degrees. Next time I will leave out the red pepper and hot sauce.  Otherwise loved the taste and consistency.

It's a keeper! Delicious and can't wait to make it again, I luv a recipe that lives up to my expectations. Don't let the good processor requirement hold you back, I just finely chopped my veggies and was good to go.

This meatloaf was delicious! I love the extra veggies in it.  I cheated on the topping - I just used some of my favorite BBQ sauce and it was perfect.  My husband loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is my new favorite recipe for meatloaf! I followed the recipe as is, but, as others have commented, total baking time is 90 minutes, and the oven temp should be 350. Love this!

I will definitely make this again but with a few changes to suit my family's tastes:  reduce salt to one tsp, replace Italian seasoning with just dried basil &  eliminate the cayenne altogether. I also think cutting the garlic back to just one clove and sautÃ©ing it with onion before adding to the celery & carrots in the food processor will soften the harshness of the raw onion/garlic flavor in the finished product. This was the most moist meatloaf I've ever had, probably due to the fresh veggies. No gravy was needed. A very good meatloaf.

This is the best meatloaf recipe that I have ever tasted or made.  Both the taste and the texture were perfect.  Well almost perfect.  For my taste it was a little heavy with the garlic but that's just a personal preference.  Chef John got it right.  The key is all those fresh ingredients which gives it such a delicious flavor and it's so moist without falling about.  Meat loaf can be dry, dense, and blah but this is one that ends all searches for meatloaf recipes for me.  I must add that my oven is off so I did add more time but I see that others commenting mentioned that the time is off.  I always use a thermometer to be sure.

I made this meatloaf,  best ever!!  Instead of the glaze included in the recipe, I used the Creamy mushrrom gravy recipe, than cook it on top of the meatloaf.  Oh so good!

Also, I only cook it for an hour.  Not 2, I think that's the total time it takes to prepare the meatloaf and glaze, and cook.?!

Good,  but something was lacking for flavor.  Only thing I didn't add were the mushrooms and hot sauce in glaze.  And yes,  1 15mins cooking time.

Awesome meatloaf. Very flavourful and moist. I don't normally like meatloaf but this one was so dilicious I would definitely make it again. As other reviews said, increase temperature to 350 degrees and cooking time to 1 hour or more. I just put barbecue sauce on top instead of glaze.

I agree with another reviewer who'd stated that the meatloaf needed more time. With 2 lbs. of ground beef, after the initial 15 minutes at 325-degrees, I increased the temperature to 350-degrees, and it was another 1:15 until the thermometer reached 170-degrees.
Having the vegetables within the loaf was a nice addition, but I prefer a more savory meatloaf; the red pepper and sauce made of brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard added sweetness.

I rated this a 4star and i made this as stated. 4 stars because of the glaze. It was good but I think the mustard put me off even though I generally love dijon. The only difference was the size of my loaf... split the meat mixture in two and baked each in a 8x8 foil lined glass baking dish at temp and time stated in the recipe. For all those who had to bake it longer.... watch the video and read the directions carefully. This is a free form loaf. If you use a loaf pan you will have to  bake longer. Chef John is still the boss.

I made it as directed except that I used 3/4 lb each of ground beef and pork and used 1 cup mixed vegetables, 1 celery stalk, 2 asparagus spears, 1 small onion and 3 cloves garlic instead of the veggies Chef John used.  It was very good!  I would use less Italian spice and less brown sugar in the glaze when I make it again.  This held together well and had a perfect moisture level.  I was able to lift it easily from the loaf pan without it falling apart.

I wanted to make a meatloaf for my Dad, so I checked to see if Chef John had any meatloaf recipes. I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't use the glaze since I didn't have Dijon mustard. I used bbq sauce instead of the glaze. My Dad really liked this meatloaf. The vegetables give a little more flavor than just ground beef and onions. I might sautÃ© the vegetables and let cool when I make this again. I will try the glaze next time,too. Thanks Chef John:)

For those of you complaining about the cooking time, it is way off. Watch the video. Chef John clearly states that over an hour is needed. Idk if it's a typo or what, but it's not Chef John's fault. Allrecipes, you screwed up.

The only thing that I did differently is I left out the mushrooms don't care for them. My husband really liked it. This is our favorite meatloaf now.  The cooking time is a little off.  I used a 350 oven for 1hr 15 min. The cook had a foot note about the cooking time though.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had. It is so worth the extra effort in chopping veggies. They add moisture and taste - and nutrition. One way to decrease cooking time (I agree it's much longer than the original recipe takes) is to bake in a 9x13.

I've made this meatloaf 2x now, and just assumed that the other reviewers were right, I baked the loaf 90 minutes at 350. Definitely it needed it. I'm not a meatloaf lover, I make this for my husband, but with this meatloaf I'm sold. It's just like a meatloaf he used to get at a restaurant in Raleigh, NC, I think the carrot makes the dish. My kids like it less, but they do eat it, and they enjoy working the food processor (very, very carefully supervised). 
I served this meatloaf both times with Chef John's mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes with the skins still on and steamed green beans. Great recipe, I'll use this often.

I didn't have cayenne pepper powder, so I threw in some sriracha and oh it was wonderful.  I used the stone ground dijon mustard as well.  I doubled the sauce on top because I love a lot of sauce.  I have made this at least 5 times, with a slight variance each time and it's always amazing.

I made a little different. I sautÃ©ed all my veggies in olive oil and let cool before adding to the meat and egg mixture. And I cooked about an hour and a half. It was so good!!! This will be my go to meatloaf from now on!

I just didn't like the texture.  It was too firm.  I cut the ground beef to 2 lb and added 1 lb reduced fat ground pork.  It was hard to mix this with all the other ingredients and to mix it loosely - which everyone says to do.  Anyway, the taste is fine, it just isn't a recipe I will repeat.

Excellent recipe.  I followed exactly accept I tripled the sauce and drizzled on the meatloaf after plating.  It's a keeper.

I finally have a meatloaf recipe I will definitely make again!  It did take much longer to cook (shape) but it was worth the wait and I was SO hungry!  Only change I made was to the spicy ingredients (less) because I am a wimp.  Even so, was YUMMY!

Awesome. I pureed the vegetables with a food processor. Mixed the rest of the ingredients together in a large bowl, then added the beef and pureed vegetables and bread crumbs. Mixed well by hand. I've done this before with finely diced vegetables, yet found it easier and better to hide the vegetables from the kids to puree it.  Yes, my cooking time is longer than the video, yet I LOVE it every time. Just check the temperature. As for the coating, I double up on it. Thanks.

I am not a real meatloaf lover, but I decided to try this recipe and I was not disappointed. The glaze added a much needed sweetness to it and the veggies mixed in was a plus. The meatloaf was not dry, it was very tasty. This is my new meatloaf recipe.

I stuck to the recipe except for not having a food processor so I very finely chopped the veggies. The meatloaf came out great!. Delicious and juicy.  The Glaze, however, was really distracting to what was a Classic Meatloaf. The mustardy/sweety concoction ruined the meal for me. Do you like left over meat loaf sandwiches or cold next day ML from the fridge? Forget the Glaze. Next time I make it I'll stick to ketchup glaze or nothing at all.

Best meatloaf I have ever had! But of course I did make changes. First I formed loaf into a bread pan, then flipped it into a larger Pyrex baking dish. Next I doubled the glaze, putting half on at the beginning, & the rest on toward the end of baking time. Bake for a total of 80 minutes (15 +65) Turned out perfect! Definitely my favorite meatloaf recipe!

I have made this 3 times in the past several months and it comes out fantastic each time. I use about 3.5lb of ground chuck and increase the veggies slightly. 1/2 onion to 1 onion, 1 carrot to 2 carrots, and do on. Put it in 3 1.5qt Pyrex meatloaf dishes and cook as directed. The sauce I mix up and do slight changes with the same ingredients. Outstanding!!!

This was my first time making a meatloaf and I was really impressed with this recipe! I didn't put all of the veggies in it, just onions and garlic. I also adjusted the cooking time and temp. I baked at 350 for 20 mins, put the glaze on, then back in the oven for an hour. Came out perfectly. I also added A1 sauce to the glaze. Will definitely make this again!

I left out the onion and bell peppers due to personal taste, but added more celery and carrots to make up the difference. This turned out moist and delicious. I did have to increase cooking time to an hour and 15 minutes.

the only change I made was not adding carrots because I didn't have any. I will cut down on the garlic the next time but otherwise this is a fantastic recipe. I don't have a food processor but I have a great chopper that got the veggies just right! I will certainly make this again. Lastly the cooking time is a little to short. I baked it for a total of  about 1.25  hours at 325.

Having read the reviews, I allowed for additional cooking time.  1 hour at 350 degrees, then an additional 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  Meatloaf had a beautiful color, and was done without being dry.  This was, by far, the best meatloaf I have ever made.  Husband and picky 6-year old loved it.  Clean plates by all! I am adding it to the monthly rotation.

I made a few changes - left out the mushrooms, added another egg,  some chopped tomato and left out all the hot sauce  and anything that would add "heat".  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut back on the brown sugar.  My family liked it and I'll probably make it again, but will try to add more glaze on top.

Very good. I think I might saute the veggies ahead of time. Just note, some other people say the cooking time is off - that was not true folr me! I think people are skipping the step of cooking it for 15 minutes, and then applying the glaze. And then cooking it for another 45 minutes.

Great taste and texture on this meatloaf, though it did take 1hr20min to reach the correct temperature, even with using the recommended size/shape.  Forgot the hot sauce in the topping, but we did use a spicy mustard, would likely taste good though.  Tip: We use a broiler pan to make meatloaf; this allows the grease to drain away as it cooks.

Adjusted temp & time. 350 for 60 minutes or so (after the initial 15).  The glaze is sweet with a kick of spice with the Tabasco. Overall yum!!

I didn't have carrots or mushrooms, but I made it according to the directions, only I cut the recipe in half.  It made a nice loaf that cooked in a metal loaf pan in about an hour or so.  I'm not a meatloaf fan, but it was tasty and my husband was pleasantly surprised.  It's only the second meatloaf in over 30 years of marriage!

I made it pretty much straight, except that I cut the onions and peppers into slightly larger dices to improve presentation and plating.  If I had it to do over, I'd have been more gentle while mixing to promote a more tender texture, but the flavor was excellent and the texture was still very good.  It's a keeper recipe.  BTW, I made the recipe a 50% lager and it made two loaves.

Delicious! The family gobbled it up. I traded bread crumbs for seasoned croutons (that's all I had). I took not of the comments on cook time, so I made smaller loafs and followed the cooking instructions. Perfect!

Neither the children or myself liked this meatloaf as much as my other meatloaf recipes .
I was excited about the added nutritional value from the veggies, but, for us,  the added vegetables really altered the  taste of the meatloaf. It wasn't beefy enough. Also the glaze had too much Dijon mustard  flavor.

I added the herbs separately, about a teaspoon each except extra parsley.  Left out mushrooms. Used chopped French's French Fried Onions instead of bread crunbs.  Everything else as written. Best meatloaf I have ever had.

This turned out very moist and tasted good. The cooking time was slightly off though, even with the small loaf I made it cooked for almost an hour. Would suggest increasing the cooking temperature.

Besides the cooking time being off, I decided this recipe is not as good as my old-fashioned meatloaf with just chopped onions and garlic.  I cooked in a 9 X 11 inch baking dish and patted to 2"H X 5"W X 11"L and still had to cook 50 min. more after the initial 15 minutes and that was to get the thermometer to 160 degrees F.  Thanks anyway Chef John

Very good recipe. My husband said "your best meatloaf ever" but the cayenne was a bit much for him. Our friends loved the little bit of kick it gave. The veggies definitely held the hold loaf together along with the egg. Looked beautiful with the glaze. It'll make this my main meatloaf recipe - with less cayenne.

Wonderful recipe !!  I have made this 4-5 times exactly as written except used 1-1/2 lbs meatloaf mix and 1 lb ground beef.  Hard to find ground chuck!!   My grown son says best meatloaf he ever had.  I cook at 350 and use an instant read thermometer.  Takes a little over an hour in my oven.  Oh, I forgot to say I didn't care for glaze first time I made this so now I do not do a glaze.

This meatloaf recipe is wonderful, it is moist and very flavorful. However, the cooking time is off. As stated in other reviews the total cooking time is at least 1 1/2 hours. Great recipe but the cooking time should be corrected in the recipe. 
I use this meatloaf recipe with Chef John's mushroom gravy recipe with is delicious!

This worked very well; I made a couple of mistakes, so I feel sure if I fix those, it'll be quite good.

Mistake number 1: I had trouble with my food processor, getting it to cut up the carrot properly. Since I put it all in together, the other vegetables ended up totally pulverized, while the carrot was still kind of chunky. I think it would have worked better had the vegetables all been cut about the same.

Mistake number 2: I ended up cooking it a little too long. It was still good, but would have been far better had I pulled it out a bit before.

Changes: I didn't have any ketchup! So I improvised with some tomato paste. And I used Franks hot sauce, because that's what I had. It worked fine, although my glaze was more intensely tomato-flavored. Not a bad thing. I didn't add any sugar, because I didn't want it too sweet.

Bottom line: the texture and flavor were very good. I served this with some sautÃ©ed mushrooms, and that was a good combination.

I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I made per the instructions but substituted a Savory Spice blend for the Italian herbs. I didn't add the sauce on top and we didn't miss it. I did add a few slices of American cheese on top. I may add some cheese the next time. Overall, moist and delicious. What you expect from a good meat loaf. I formed mine in a Pyrex baking dish and it cooked in 50 mins. I think a loaf pan extends the cooking time.

I tried this last night, it was fantastic. I used plain ground pork and added the Italian spices, just perfect. Fantastic recipe, however as with anything good, it takes time!

Quite delicious. For whatever reason this took a lot longer to cook than the directions indicated...I think because I used a deep casserole dish rather than a slightly deep metal pan. Amazing how much of a difference a pan can make. It was delish when we finally ate it though!

I want to thank Chef John for his videos. He makes everything look so easy. I tried the classic meatloaf and I have to say my (a little fussy) daughter (now in her teens) must of liked it cause she had a second piece of meat. Since her and I don't care for things like onions, and/or peppers, grinding them worked great cause I couldn't taste the onions but could the flavor (which is ok). We add more spices than solid items.  I have been looking over other recipes I certainly am going to try. Thanks again--ceb

Best meatloaf ever. I added a small portion of pableno pepper. Decreased salt to one teaspoon.
A hit with my family who has never been fans of meatloaf.
I will probably make it again, by request.

I pureed the heck out of the veggies so nobody would know they were there.  Skipped the cayenne and controlled the heat with the hot sauce in the topping.  Next time I will add some spinach or whatever veggies I have a little left of.  Once they were pureed (to liquid state so nobody could identify anything "healthy") nobody knew they were there.  The fam loved the topping.  I prefer parmesan cheese on top so made two with parm and the rest with Chef John's sauce. Chef John never fails.  And because I added so many veggies to this we splurged and had Chef John's Ultimate Mashed Potatoes - 3 1 lb potatoes to 1lb of butter!!! (Only I couldn't go that far, I did a 1/2 lb plus another half stick and it was perfectly divine... didn't splurge on the European butter THIS TIME).  This is the first time I have ever made a meatloaf that my family could eat.  I can cook some pretty fancy stuff but basic meatloaf is beyond me.  I think one of the tricks was not over mixing the meat.  Next time around I am going to add even more veggies (spinach maybe).  Once pureed it adds moisture to the meatloaf and great flavor.  My 7 y/o budding chef wanted to try it as meatloaf muffins.  So I upped the temp to 350 and started checking them at 45 minutes.  I also drained the grease and turned the muffin pans about midway thru (be sure to put a pan under the muffin pan to catch any grease that may spill over).  Only other change was whole wheat Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Enjoy!!!

Although this recipe yields a moist meatloaf, my family did not care for the flavor.  The onions and bell peppers along with the seasoning upset my stomach.  I also think the cooking time was off. Thank you for the great video, though!

This recipe is amazing!  I agree that the cooking time suggested was not enough however in adding 20 minutes it 
Was perfect.  A huge hit in our home.  I have been using my own meat loaf recipe for years BUT it's Chef John's classic for me in the future.  Definitely a five star.

We made this recipe exactly like the recipe called for but we replaced the beef with ground venison...WOW, it was awesome.  Even folks that "don't eat mealoaf" tried it and loved it.  The flavors were great...The glaze can be spicy but very good so you need to pay attention to that but it was awesome!  We also used a temp probe to ensure the meat was done...I think that is better than timing.

Great recipe. I used ground turkey instead of chuck, forgot the mushrooms, and added teaspoon of cocktail sauce to my glaze instead of hot sauce. That snap of horseradish to the already great recipe is fantastic!  Try it.

This is a slightly altered version of my standard meatloaf recipe that I have made for years.  No celery in mine. Mine calls for more mushrooms, which absorb moisture and gives it a nice moistness.  It takes a long time to prepare it and to bake it. But I like it because it is so healthy. Be sure to cut the vegetables to a very small dice.

Delicious, I used 1/4 c bread crumbs topped up with rolled oats for the almost 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.
Served with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and mushroom gravy.

We liked this meatloaf and it made good leftover sandwiches the next day. I left out the red pepper and mushroom though because we do not care for red pepper and I didn't think 4 mushrooms would make or break the dish.

This was a great recipe to follow. I did not use all the veggies that it called for because I did not have them all and I did not want to take a trip to the store so I improvised! But it was still a good meatloaf. It did take longer to cook than suggested but otherwise a great recipe to follow and alter to your own tastes if needed!

I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in a loaf pan.  I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It definitely had a distinct taste - I think from the vegetables.  I changed the glaze a little - more ketchup, less brown sugar, etc.  Just to my own tastes.

I love this recipe but the cooking time is way off..  I've tried this three times and each time have raised the oven temperature.  Love the texture and taste.

Before I try this, has anyone made this with veggie protein crumbles, i.e. vegetarian hamburger? I know its a lot drier so maybe an egg.  New to cooking

I had the same problem with the cooking time being way off. Luckily I knew that 30min was to short so I adjusted ahead of time, and cooked it for an hour. 
A nice alternative is to substitute to bread crumbs for crushed tortilla chips. Depending on your love for salt you may want to reduce the salt by 1/2-1teaspoon as most tortilla chips are salted. Gives the meatloaf some more texture.

Yummy!  We especially enjoyed the topping.  This was my first try at making meatloaf.  I watched the video of the chef making it, and mine turned out really good.

DELICIOUS! I adore your recipes- they always are so easy and yummy. I gave some to my friend at work and she asked what the special ingredient was because it had some zing to it! Of course, it was your signature the Cayenne!

Very rich- but super good! I used the recipe from the shepards pie to make the mashed potatoes (used yellow) that had the sour cream and cheese in it too.

The whole family loved this one! The pureed vegetables seemed to add a "fluffiness" to the result, while the loaf still held together well.

We loved this one but made one change and that was to use 3 lbs of extra lean chicken instead of the chuck....I know...its a big change...BUT it was excellent and cut way down on fat and calories. I kept all the other ingredients the same and even used the glaze on half of the meatloaf since the kiddos dont care for it. Great flavors here with all of the veggies and actually nice and moist again due to all of the veggies. Will make again!
