Very refreshing!  I used fresh garlic & also added a bit of freshly chopped basil.  I also added a dash of salt & pepper.  I think next time I'll also add some parmesan.  Thanks!

This recipe shows that you really don't need to go overboard all the time to have a dish taste good. I used an organic orange bell pepper and fresh ground pepper and sea salt. I ate this with fresh-baked Pseudo Sourdough for the Bread Machine and really enjoyed it. Next time, I might add some fresh garlic.

great salad. refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving so that the tomatoes can break down a bit and you have a terrific salad. fresh garlic also adds a bit of extra flavor.

This salad was refreshing and healthy, but nothing too spectacular.  I got all the veggies at the farmers market, so they had a lot of flavor, but I think you need more seasoning than the recipe calls for. I also added cucumber for a little more depth.
