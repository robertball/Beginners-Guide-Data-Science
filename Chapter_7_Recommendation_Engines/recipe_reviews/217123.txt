Very good recipe!!! My family loves 'sloppy joes', but I hate the sauce out the can because it is so sweet.  This made a great sloppy joe that my family loved and I did too.  I cooked it in a skillet instead of in the slow cooker and it turned out great.  I omitted celery, upped the garlic, salt, pepper, and vinegar.  I also used a can of tomato paste and cut down the ketchup to get rid of some of the sweetness.  Overall, very good recipe!

Oh my goodness this came out great. So tasty and super simple to make. The only thing I tweaked was I seasoned the ground beef with seasoned salt, pepper, cumin and a dash of red pepper flakes before I added it to my slow cooker. Also, I added 5 cloves of garlic instead of 2 (I love garlic).

I made this using vegetarian fake "beef" crumbles, and it was so delicious my fiance forgot it wasn't meat (we're on a low calorie diet)!!  the only thing I changed was using a chipotle flavored ketchup as it was all we had.  I think it would also be great with chicken or brisket!  Thank you so much for sharing, we will be making this again!!

This is the basicly same recipe I use minus the celery and slow cooker.  It's only a half hour in a pan.  Very tasty and fast.  Great with veggie and salad or fruit.

WOW!! I made this tonight for the first time.  I was only making it for myself so I pretty much cut the recipe in half.  After a few hours of cooking the smell made me just want to add pickle slices and a touch of pickle juice, it was amazing.  I ate the meat on a hamburger bun like a sloppy joe and in a tortilla as a burrito.  Both were unbelievable!  So easy and so good

Great recipe! Only thing I did different was omit the celery and use Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. It was awesome as sloppy joes on some Hawaiin buns, even my very picky 2yr old ate it up! I will never make sloppy joes from a can again!

This is exactly the same way I have always made mine. I dont add celery or the minced garlic but do add finely chopped peppers. My soon to be hubby does not like the sweetness, so I compromise by adding a can of tomatoe paste to cut down on the sweetness. I also use a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce (more or less to taste) and a dash or two of chili powder.

LOVE this!  Used it for a Girl Scout dinner.  Added 4lbs of beef, so also added a Manwich can too, but the flavoring was SO good!

I made this with ground venison and ground beef.  It was delicious.  Will definitely keep this recipe to be used again.

Turned out very well.  I also included 2 tbsp Sriracha chili paste to provide some extra heat.  I served this as wraps on romaine lettuce leaves with light sour cream.

Mid summer we are tired of burgers, brats and hot dogs at parties. This was the perfect alternative. Like others I added tomato paste 2 - 6 oz cans) to cut the sweetness. I'm not an onion fan yet since it was cooked most of the day, the onions were stewed and blended great. I will make again.

Very yummy.  I decreased the celery to 2 stalks and decreased the ketchup by 1/2 c and added a 1/4 c of chili sauce and a 1/4 c of bbq sauce.  I also seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin while it was browning.  Quite tasty.  :)

These were good. I didnt have quite as much brown sugar as called for and these were pretty sweet when we ate them Im glad I didnt add the whole amount. I would make these again with a few more tweaks. Thanks.

This is awesome.

My changes to this: 2 cans of tomato paste, subtract the ketchup, 1tsp cumin, 1-2 tsp of Sriracha (I used a lot more, personally:) A bit of sweet, a bit of spicy, and enjoyable enough to even make my husband and daughter fight over the leftovers the following night.

I made this for a pot luck at lunch.  Wasn't able to let it sit for 6-8 hrs so I made it the night before and cooked the celery (only 3 stalks) and onion with the burger.  Mixed it all and turned on low in the morning.  DELICIOUS!!!  Will make again & again and will never buy another can of manwhich!  Thanks for sharing a very yummy & easy recipe :)

Way too sweet! When you find this unbearable, add cheese of your choice to hide the sugar. I couldn't handle it on the ketchup alone, I never added the brown sugar thank god!

I'd go with 1C Ketchup, 1TSP Worcestershire sauce, two 8oz cans tomato paste or make your own preferably. 1 full cereal bowel of onion, at least 5 cloves of garlic (fresh) and a touch of Jack Daniels (original) BBQ sauce. Seasoning is up to you, but I would add 1tsp of Basile (dried) and use apple cider vinegar in the recipe.

If you like candy between your buns, use the recipe as written! Otherwise, try it my way and tweak anyway you like. Either way, if you shy away from sugar as I do, stay away from this unless you make my modifications. Just fair warning!

I'll write my own recipe here coming soon, until then, I'd suggest you look for another.......

My family has never been a fan of "Canned" Beef BBQ sandwich, but I had a ton of ground beef and a new slow cooker so decided to give this a try!! It is amazing & only half done. (I prepared it the night before & will cook it on low all day while I work tomorrow) I took several review suggestions including using Plain BBQ sauce (Added spices, a dab of Hickory Flavoring & splash of honey), also added a touch of Pickle Juice and can of Tomato sauce. So far it's amazing & wanted to get this review w/ modifications out there :) 
Bon' Appetit!!

I scaled down to 7 for 1 lb of ground beef, and found the seasoning too bland for our tastes so had to increase / tweak, but love the convenience of letting this simmer and cook in the crock pot and having it warm and ready to serve up at dinner. To up the veggie content I also grated in a couple small carrots. They seem to disappear nicely into these types of dishes.

Made it as an easy dinner option, and we will have plenty to eat for a few days!  For two people I would recommend breaking the recipe down into thirds.  We put our beef on onion buns and topped with provolone.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce for 1/2 a cup of ketchup to add a bit of a smoky and zesty flavor.

This was really good. Since there's only two of us, I shortened some of the ingredients instead of 3 pounds of hamburger I used 1 1/2 pounds- instead of 3 1/2 cup of ketchup I used 1 cup. I omitted the salt and mustard (don't eat ), I also added about 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. And used only 2 stalks of celery and 1/2 tsp of vinegar. I agree with the other reviewers forget about the can (of manwich) this is my go to for sloppy joes now! Will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks for posting it!

It was very good and quite tasty. Although, 1 large onion was way to much. It made it very oniony. I'd recommend using a small onion instead and you probably don't even need all of it. (If you can get it chopped really good, it's probably better but I'm good but not that good...) Still very flavorful and tasty.

I used 2 lbs of beef instead of 3, so I reduced all other ingredients by 1/3. It turned out OK...it's better than Manwich but it didn't drive my husband or I wild. I think it's too ketchup-based for our tastes.

I made a lot of changes because I don't like sweet for a meal and I could tell with the ketchup and brown sugar it would be too sweet for my family.  I omitted the brown sugar all together and replaced it with 4 tablespoons honey.  I used one cup of ketchup and 1 can of tomato sauce.  We love garlic and pepper so I added extra.  I was also out of apple cider vinegar so I used balsamic.

Really tasty! Instead of 3 lbs ground beef, I used 2 lbs and added a can each of kidney beans and great northern beans. Got rave reviews from three people who really like ketchup--if you want to cut back on the ketchup taste, consider subbing some of it for tomato paste.

I followed recipe exactly, but bit salty for my taste. Maybe next time, I'll omit the salt. It was better with my toast. I will make again, but with moderation from other viewers to add some cumin or little bit of taco seasoning? Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly except I left out the celery as I had none and it was excellent.  My family loved it and finished it all!

I did a trial run with ingredients for 1 pound of beef before making a larger batch for a group, and I'm glad I did.  While I liked the flavor, between the brown sugar and the catsup, it was way too sweet.  The second time I made it,  I substituted tomato paste for about 3/4 of the amount of catsup, and that helped tone down the sweetness.  I think a total substitution would have worked as well, but I wanted a little of the catsup flavor.  Initially the mixture was very thick, but after cooking, the onions and celery produced enough liquid to make the consistency better.  (It actually was a little too liquid with only catsup.)  Also, just a heads-up:   the second time, I made it adjusted for 32 servings, which was just under 5 lbs. of meat, but it yielded about 25 servings on the slightly  larger brioche buns I had bought; maybe it would have made 32 on regular sized buns .

I didn't have enough time to make it in the slow cooker, so I used the stove top method.  No celery on hand so on impulse I used sliced black olives!  Instead of using all of the ketchup (ran out) I used 1 cup of bbq sauce.  I really hate to modify new recipes but I really couldn't help it because at the last minute, I didn't have enough of the ingredients.  It was superb & I thank you for the recipe!

This was good, but too sweet for us. I'm  going to use molasses in place of the brown sugar. And I made adjustments for 2, so cooking time is less. We really liked it!??

This was delicious. Only used 1 stalk celery as I think 5 would have over-powered the recipe. Added way more garlic.  Enjoyed the taste as it was not as sweet as the canned version. I think I would use 1/2 C less ketchup (for the full recipe) . And one more thing, I will make more because this was gone quickly and  because I cut the recipe in half. But not next time.

We really liked this...not very acidic. Took other suggestions and used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup bbq sauce and 12 oz tomato paste along with the mustard and vinegar. Did it all in a stock pot. Added the onion and celery and also tossed in a couple handfuls of shredded carrots to the raw meat. Once cooked, added the sauce and simply heated through for about 10 minutes.

I made this as written, doubling recipe for a group, but omitted the sugar, as we prefer savory all the way. Ketchup adds enough sweetness. Loved it and so did all the folks at our neighborhood night out potluck.

My only complaint is that  you don't use stalks of celery.  You use ribs. The stalk is  a bunch of ribs.

Too sweet. Also why bother using the slow cooker all day when you have to brown the meat in a pan. Doesn't need that all day cooking to develop the flavor.

I made a few changes. Reduced the Ketchup added a cup of Zing Zing another tablespoon of the cider vinegar to cut the sweetness of the brown sugar and about 3 tablespoons of crushed red peppers to step it a notch along with a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce .

This is good. Cooked meat with onion and bell peppers, I also seasoned w cumin, pepper, garlic and Worcester.   I only used a little ketchup, a little mustard, some spicy home made sauce and part of the bottle of Kraft mesquite smoke bbq sauce since that's what I had on hand.  Also added additional onion and mini bell peppers to the crock pot.

This was the second time I made this.  My husband didn't care for it the first time but liked it the second time. I substituted no salt tomato sauce for ketchup because I'm trying to cut back on potassium for my dad. I also prepared on the stove top since I didn't have time for the crockpot. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was a hit! I'm putting this in the  summer meal rotation. Thanks!

This is a very tasty recipe, almost like mom used to make. Very easy to make. Added crushed red peppers to meat and added more garlic. Will definitely make this again, family loved it.

Yummy!!!
I too did not have enough ketchup, so I used the 2 cups of Ketchup I had on-hand, added one 8-ounce can of tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup of Costco/Kirkland Signature Organic Salsa.  I also added 1/2 of a red bell pepper, 1-1/2 tsp celery seed seasoning (instead of the fresh celery), 1-1/2 tsp Cumin and, of course, 4 extra cloves of garlic. The only thing I will modify on the recipe above to my preference the next time around will be to add in 1/2 tbsp of the vinegar. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. :) I will definitely be using as appetizers with mini-buns for my next large gathering!! I truly enjoyed it and it was WONDERFUL in my lettuce wrap!!(shared a picture for you all above).  Aloha ;)

My whole family loved this, and I thought it was great too. The only change I made was I used 3 cups ketchup and 1 cup barbecue sauce. It was tender and delicious, and would probably reheat well but I didn't have any left over!

Good recipe.  First time I had made sloppy joe without a mix and this was easy to make.  I did think it was a little sweet so ending up adding a little Worcestershire sauce and dashes of allspice, ground mustard, and ginger.

My husband thought it was too sweet, but I liked it.  Next time I make it, I might try it w/o the sugar.
