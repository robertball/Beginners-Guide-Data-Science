These were awesome.  Made them yesterday and everyone loved them.  The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the caramel topping is really, really chewy.  Not what I expected on top of a cupcake.  We left the nuts off because the kids won't eat nuts and we left out the stick, but I bet that would be perfect for a party.  After sitting all night the caramel on top became runny (not sure why) and it ran off the top and down the sides of the cupcakes.  Glad we made them the same day we needed them.  Next time I will make a regular caramel icing to put on top, not just caramel mixed with a little bit of evap. milk.

Great fall dessert.  I tried these out and wasn't crazy about the frosting so I tried them again with Caramel Frosting IV and mixed in some the the caramel frosting that this recipe calls for and it was much better.  I also put extra apple in the cake and I liked it better also

OMG!!! These cupcakes are AMAZING!!! I couldn't find spice cake mix, so I used yellow mix and put in two medium size apples. After reading some of the other reviews about the frosting, I decided to use vanilla frosting mixed with half cup of caramel dip/topping. It was fantastic!! I'm taking these to work tomorrow for a Halloween party and can't wait to hear what people have to say about them!!

These were wonderful! I used 2 medium sized McIntosh apples because they are just so great to bake with. Instead of using the caramels and evaporated milk I just frosted them with caramel frosting. They were amazing! I share a house with a bunch of girls and they were gone in hours. The apples made them so moist. This recipe is perfect for the fall.

I substituted the frosting by just mixing white frosting with caramel topping.

The cupcake is awesome but the carmel topping gets to hard to eat like a cupcake... next time ill either do a carmel sauce or a frosting with a carmel drizzle.

I used a caramel cake mix and frosted with the Caramel Frosting IV from this site...so good!  The next time I make these, I will add more apple for more flavor.

I used this recipe for the cupcake and am making a different frosting. But I was disappointed because the cakes didn't rise. They are pretty dense and small. They only changes I made were that I shredded my apples instead of chopped and used applesauce instead of oil. Flavor is awesome however. Hopefully the flavor will make up for the lack of rise.

The caramel hardened before I could even put the peanuts on top - all the peanuts fell off. In addition, it was hard to take a bite out of the cupcake because of the touch caramel.

Me family enjoyed these a lot, i did think that the frosting was going to be to sticky, so i frosted with caramel frosting VI of (was it IV) the only thing i regret about this was the frosting it was just like eating a huge spoonful of brown sugar. the cup cakes we good with out frosting though.

Awesome...served them at a party and everyone loved them.
At the advice of other reviews, I did not use the frosting listed.  I used the Duncan Hines frosting creations with caramel mix and added two apples.
Definetely recommend!

These turned out better than I thought they would! I couldn't find the exact ounces of cake mix, so I bought a slightly larger one and added oil, water, and egg amounts according to the package's directions.  Based on several other people's suggestions, I also added some more apple and used Caramel Frosting IV. They looked, smelled, and tasted so good! I will make these again!

Amazing!  I shredded the apples, this pulled out some juice, which I threw into the batter, and they were tasty and moist.  Made home made caramel instead of melting candies, and it was a hit.
