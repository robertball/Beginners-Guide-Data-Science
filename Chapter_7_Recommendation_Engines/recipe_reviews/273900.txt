I read a lot of the reviews.....and several people expected this to be more' 'cake-like'.....and able to be cut....even though cobblers generally are not.  If you want to cut it....just mix everything.....and I mean everything including the melted butter.......together well.  This makes it able to be cut into squares.  I personally like the original way better ....but it is nice to know in case you want to be able to cut it and serce it with more fresh fruit/ilce cream/whipped cream....on top.  I would be interested to hear if anyone else has made it this way.

We loved it!!!!!  I used the exact amount of butter called for but still had a bit of dry spots at the end of the bake time.  I melted a bit more of butter, covered my dry spots and put the cake back in for another 5 minutes.  Delish!
