Very chocolatey and spongy with a nice chewy crisp. The first time I made these I beat the eggs way too much (according to the directions) and the mix turned liquidy. I recommend adding the pinch of salt to the eggs before mixing, then once the froth starts to form, add 1/8 tsp cream of tarter (not sure if this is kosher) per egg white (this helps keep the eggs stiff when you add the other ing.) and once the eggs become med stiff add the sugar in a few quick shakes and maybe after 10 sec or so add the cocoa mix also in a few quick shakes. Only mix 10 more sec. just enough to blend the cocoa in. The more you mix after the dry ingredients are added the eggs whites become liquidy. Play it on the safe side, less mixing is better to keep the egg whites stiff. You're looking for a fluffy consistency. I think I used the mixer for two minutes total. I used the mini chips and the baking paper, and they came out great. A light, fluffy, chocolatey treat.

Decided to try this recipe as I've got three egg whites in the freezer that needed to be used soon. Was disappointed with the outcome as the batter tasted really nice, but, like another reviewer, my egg whites did not whip to a stiff peak. Probably put in the flour in one batch too soon.

I didn't like it at all. It may have been just me and that I didn't whip it enough but i'm pretty sure I did. They came out flat and burnt. So if your going to try them be sure to whip it not just till peaks form but until the egg white is stiff. Also put them on for about 30 minutes NOT 40 and be sure to check on them.

Delicious, light, and fluffy.  Great meringue cookie for the holidays, or any time of year.
