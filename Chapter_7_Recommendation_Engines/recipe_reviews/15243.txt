I agree with the many reviewers who found this recipe wonderful. And if you want it to come out wonderful, too, there are two keys to success: 1) Follow the recipe when it says to beat the filling mixture for 3-5 minutes. This is way to get the right consistency. Like some other reviewers, I also added a little extra lemon for some added tartness. 2) Don't exactly follow the recipe for the crust. Start with chilled butter instead of softened. Then, like pie crust, try to handle it as little as possible, hand mixing only enough to get it the right consistency. This is the key to getting the crust crumbly instead of tough. I made this recipe for this first time tonight, and served it to guests. One of them said, "I don't usually like lemon bars, but these are great!" Can't argue with success!

Every time I make these everyone raves about them ! It is easiest to cut them if they have been kept in the fridge ... they do get soft if they aren't . Also , someone mentioned the edges become tough and chewy , I had this problem the first time and so now when I put the crust in I push it up the sides of the pan so when it is time to put the lemon layer on that batter doesn't actually touch the side of the pan ... I no longer have had a problem with the edges . This is a favorite recipe in our house!

This is a great lemon bar recipe, a favorite of my friends and family.  A friend's grandmother actually advised me to change up the filling mixture just a bit: I beat the eggs at least 5 minutes, and used  1/2 tsp of salt, only 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 4T flour in the filling, along with 2 T of lemon zest.  I like it better without icing, too, with just powdered sugar and a pinch of nutmeg sprinkled over the top.  Here's another tip: I find it faster to "cut in" the butter with my hands.  Just rub the mixture together between fingertips until it is evenly crumbled with the butter.    I think next time I'll add more lemon juice.

Absolutely perfect - sweet and tart at the same time.  Recipie is easy and the results no matter how you put it together are always the same.  My daughter *12* loves to make these and they are always a great treat.

This is the classic! You can leave off the icing for the usual lemon bar, or try the icing for a different presentation. The filling is just the right tartness, though I also add the rind of one lemon finely zested to mine.

These bars were just okay.The crust came out too hard and the filling was too soft. Also, the edges were tough and chewy so I had to cut them off. These bars aren't worth the trouble, I will not be making them again!

I've made this recipe a few times now and I love it. I make it for our youth group and it always goes fast. I haven't done it with the icing yet, but maybe someday. It's a great, simple recipe which doesn't take too much effort. I do reduce the sugar and I add a little extra lemon juice (about half again extra). But it's a great recipe. I love it!!!

Fabulous! I made them yesterday and they're almost all gone. I subbed a half-cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup splenda for 1 cup white cause I had them on hand. I also ended up using quite a bit of lemon zest because someone knocked over most of the juice while I was stirring. Luckily this totally worked. In fact, it had the perfect sweet tartness. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

what a wonderful bar!! i used a little extra lemon juice since i like things tart, and i also added the lemon zest for more flavor and colour. i did not ice these bars but i did dust them w/ powdered sugar after cutting them to hide the messy edges.

I thought this was ok, but not great by any means. The crust was good, but I didn't like the lemon part. I was expecting the lemon filling to be more like it would be in a lemon meringue pie; but this filling was "airry". I also didn't like the topping. 

I am glad I made this before I went to the picnic next weekend, so I now know not to use it for that....

to eat it with a spoon.  (And not very 
lemony either. - really disappointing!

This recipe is excelent. I made it for the first time last week and served along with brownies, cookies, etc and the lemon bars were a success! The icing came out too liquid with the given proportion of sugar:lemon juice but it is easy to see when the consistency is just right for spreading.

this was amazing! these were the best lemon bars i have ever made. they did not stick to the sides of the pan or anything. i use the icing to give it a little extra lemon taste and it was perfect. i am only 14 years old and i had no problem making them it was wonderful.

I have been making this recipe for years, but the name I have on it is "lemon love notes".   Have taken it to many potluck and always asked for the recipe.   When I feel like something totally decadent I top them with lemon cream cheese icing.

These had a nice lemon flavor, but there was a hint of chaulkyness that may have come from the confection suger.  Will try again changing the ratio in the icing on top.

This is the same as the Pillsbury Book recipe. Its very good, though I find the original directions to use a 9x13 pan results in thin bars, so prefer a 7x11 pan

I LOVE these lemon bars!!! They are incredibly easy; even my 3 yr. old looks forward to whipping up a batch! I've made them about five times but had one flop. The second time I made them I used butter that was softened (instead of straight out of the fridge) and the crust was way screwed up! It was hard to "cut in", crubly, didn't fit in the regular baking dish, and the bars were thrown out - they tasted very odd. BUT - other than that this is my all time fave recipe! :) THANKS!!!!

these were ok the crust was not what i expected it to be. I followed the recipe to a tee...It was very chewy but we did enjoy the filling. I think the next time I make these i will change the crust but keep the filling.

Very good. My husband isn't typically a fan of lemon desserts, but said this was his favorite. It's a little over-the-top sweet however... and I love sweets! Maybe I'll cut back on the icing next time.

My first attempt at these I halved the entire recipe, and put in an 8x8 pan. I also made the crust and filling in my food processor (worked great!)  I definitely needed more filling, so I added another 1/2. (Ended up with 1/2 the recipe with 3/4 filling.)  Consistency was fine, but not as "lemony" as I would have liked, and I even added much more than originally called for.  I think next time I will use lemon zest.  I wanted a thicker "icing", so I piped it on, and added raspberries as decoration.  They looked great - if only they tasted a little more like the "lemon" squares I was hoping for.

These were phenomenal! Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I followed the pointers from other reviewers - using chilled butter and for the filling I used 4T of flour, 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/2 tsp baking powder, and beat for 5 minutes. I added more lemon juice than was called for, since I like my lemon bars lemony. I skipped the icing, since I'm not a big fan and just put conf. sugar on top. These were so good, it's ridiculous!!

This is such a GREAT lemon bar recipe, that I have searched for it for over 3 years now!  I lost the recipe while moving and still have not forgotten about it!  The uniqueness of these bars is the icing that goes on top to add a sweetness.  I have found all other bars to be too drystally or too tart.  Thank you KATHY E!

Something is amiss with the recipe because my center always comes out too soupy and the crust/top always gets too brown before the filling even has enough time to cook. I even covered it with foil and baked another 10 mins and the filling was still too gooey. Also, not enough lemon flavor and way too much sugar. I made the mistake of trying another lemon bar recipe when I love my lemon bar recipe out of my old Better homes and gardens cookbook (With the famous red plaid cover). Now THAT'S a great lemon bar recipe! This one, just doesn't cut it.

These bars are tasty, but can be sensitive to the weather.  Baking them on a humid day can make them mushy.  Also, using margarine instead of butter in the crust makes a softer bar.  I prefer them without the icing.

Very simple instructions with pastry shop results! VERY important to beat the filling for 5 minutes, and chilled butter works better than softened for a tender crust. I prefer to shake a bit of plain icing sugar over the bars when they are fully cooled---messy but good!

This is the same recipe as my beloved Lemon Love Notes, except that I add 4 teaspoons grated lemon rind to the filling and skip the glaze. I dust the top with powdered sugar before serving. They are always a big hit and I get requests for the recipe whenever I take them anywhere. I have been making these for 30 years and plan to continue to make them often.

I tried this recipie twice and it just wasn't working out for me. Both times the crust was great. It was really buttery and easy. The filling was another story, both times it had an eggy taste, and not enough lemon. The second time I used more lemon in it and some zest, but it was not very tart at all.

I love these, but I dont care for them much once they're 2 days old. I tried them in the fridge, or in an air tight container just on the counter and both times I thought they didnt age well. But in the first 24 hours, they're amazing!

Fantastic recipe!! Subbed the regular sugar for confectioner's sugar in all and added lemon zest to garnish the top... all was perfect!

Lemon bar perfection! My co-worker introduced me to these. If she bakes it, it's bound to be the best thing you've ever tasted. She follows this recipe but adds the zest of 1 lemon to the glaze. It doesn't get better than these lemon bars!

These were awesome!  My friend and I finished the contents of a 9x9" square pan in one sitting!!  We halved the recipe and used the juice of 2 whole lemons and it turned out the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.  Next time I will make more filling since this time it was a little thin.  We also burned ours a little, but after cutting away those unwanted edges, we noticed a lovely, chewy layer on top.  We nixed the icing and just sprinkled some powdered sugar.  And the rest is history!

My 12 year old daughter kicked me out of the kitchen and made these bars to serve at a Church function. Everyone loved them! She decided not to "frost" them but instead just sprinkled with powdered sugar.

These are the best!  The only difference I made was put some lemon zest in the icing.  Oh, so lemony and delicious!  Even my 8 year old son told me this was a "keeper", and asked if I would make them again tommorrow!  My mother-in-law said they were the best lemon bars she has ever had and insisted on getting the recipe before she left.  Fast and easy recipe that will get you compliments galore!  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!

It had to bake for nearly DOUBLE the time listed as the center was WAY too soupy.  However, after all the extra baking, it turned out okay.  The crust is a bit heavy on the butter, though.  I'll be looking for a better recipe for sure.

Unfortunately, I must have done something very wrong, because the crust was dry and the lemon mixture separated from the crust when cut.

I really liked the crust - more shortbread like and flaky.  But I did not like the lemon topping. So I will combine this crust with another topping and I think I'll have the one I like!

I love this recipe and always make it for parties and potlucks.  The only thing I do different is instead of icing I just sprinkle powdered sugar on top and it's just perfect.

This is really tasty! Everybody loved it. I might try to use key lime juice instead next time for a different flavor.

I've made these twice now and I LOVE the crust. However, the first time the filling was way to sweet and not lemony enough. I made them again tonight decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increasing the lemon juice to 1/2 cup they still just don't taste right. Plus the filling separated from the crust and developed a wierd tasting "skin" on the top. Could it be the baking powder? I'll continue to search for the perfect lemon bar.
