We really liked this! I made it because my husband was out of town and he can't eat asparagus. My son asked right away that I make it again!
I had 3/4 lb asparagus so I halved the topping, I used basil for the thyme as I am not a fan.
The cooking time is way too long though, mine was almost burnt at 25 minutes, 20 minutes would probably be spot on.
I made this for the Allrecipes Allstar Canada April challenge #ARFaceless
