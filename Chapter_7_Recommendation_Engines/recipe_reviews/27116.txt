It's a shame so many "non-reviews" have skewed the ratings for this drink.  As a general rule, I'm not a fan of SoCo...in fact, I bought a "nipper" sized bottle just to make this drink.  I'll be hitting the liquor store (we live in PA; we have antiquated liquor laws...) for a regular sized bottle just to make this.  The tagline hits the nail on the head.  This is a great social sipping drink for someone who wants to sip at a drink, but isn't interested in high alcohol.  I used Dr. Pepper 10 and a full nipper bottle (slightly more than a shot) and it was perfect.  I didn't notice a distinct alcohol taste and enjoyed the drink.  I can see this becoming a nightcap staple in our world....CHEERS, DEEJAYDOC!

Not a drinker, but agree with anither reviewer that it's good to sip.  For me, it was a happy accident while looking for sauce made with Dr Pepper :)
