The first time I made this recipe I added two eggs like other reviewers suggested and it was fabulous.  The second time I made it (this time for a crowd) I forgot to add the second egg, but it was still delicious.  When I make it again I will add the second egg though; it was better.

Giving this the highest rating because I tried another corn pudding recipe from this sight and this one was much better.  Didn't like the other one because it was too much like bread.  Followed this one just as written, but admit I did add a little milk because I was worried it might be dry like the other one.  Actually, had to bake it a little longer (due to the added milk).  Next time I will do just as written and I am sure it will be the creamy consistency I am after. Be sure NOT to drain the can of whole kernel corn. Very good!!

This is a good one-be sure to add two eggs when making this.  This can also be doubled very easily and made in a 9X13 pan for a larger crowd.

This is a Great tasting dish, yet it requires minimum effort. I think it taste best without the sour cream. As one reviewer stated earlier, be sure to add the liquid from the whole kernel corn. This taste exactly like the corn pudding served in one of the well known restaurants in New Orleans.

this was so easy and very, very tasty! the best part was the top gets golden brown like cornbread, but the dish's consistency is that of a thick pudding. i used "no salt added" corn (but then added a scant teaspoon), threw in a small handful of grated cheddar cheese, and mixed in a can of mild green chiles on half of the casserole. very good!

I am always trying new recipes and rarely like them, but this one was a very welcome exception!  It's very easy to put together - one dish and one spoon.  I did drain the can of whole kernel corn (my guess is this explains why a few others thought their's was too runny).  I also added a bit of sugar & used the sour cream.  When I doubled the recipe, I had to cook it for 45+ minutes to get it to cook through.  This recipe will be a regular dish in our house.

Awesome.  Even better the second day.  I added a bit of sugar to the recipe, and topped the casserole with graham cracker crumbs mixed with butter toward the end of baking. Delicious.

Loved it and so did everyone in the crowd. I added 2 eggs, and didn't drain the corn. The 2nd time I cut the butter down to 1/3 cup and still it was great. Tried it both with and without the sour cream and liked it both ways -- with the sour cream it was softer, creamier consistency, without it was a little more bread-like.

Took this to a family dinner at my new in-laws and got rave reviews, even from one who claimed not to like corn pudding! Make sure you add 2 eggs, gives a better texture and adds richness to this dish. Great comfort-food!

I doubled this recipe for a family reunion and everyone loved it.  My brother thought our mother made it (because she's such a good cook). Very easy to make and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

I can't imagine adding eggs to this.  There is no need for them, and why clog the arteries when it's not necessary? In fact, my family has been making this for years and we have never added butter.  It is every bit as delicious without it.  The creamed corn and sour cream gives the pudding plenty of moisture. Trust me! Leave out the eggs and butter and save yourself a trip to the emergency room.

Not my gramma's corn pudding, but it's a yummy alternative! I added 2 eggs,1 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and used margarine (had no butter). Took exactly 30 minutes. Was soo easy. I liiiiiike it. Added Note: The first time I made it w/out the corn juice and it was the consistency of pound cake (although tasty). The second time I made it, I did leave the corn juices - MUCH BETTER MUCH BETTER (almost like grammas :-))

The hubs has been doing ALOT of "self-teaching" with grilling/smoking lately so I've been on the quest for different, down-home style side dishes to go with his latest experiements. That's what motivated me to try this simple dish. I followed the directions, being sure though to NOT drain the whole kernal corn, then added 2 beaten eggs & a pinch of salt. Mine had to cook almost 60 minutes in an 8x8 pan but...we & our guest loved it! Comfort food - not diet food to be sure, but tasty & a nice texture change from cornbread. The following night I crumbled the leftovers in a hot skillet (no added butter or oil) & threw in a finely chopped green onion to mimic what one of our local restraunts calls "corn fritter casserole". This too got rave reviews from our guests. So, I love that it tastes really good, can do double duty & for us as a side dish over 2 nights fed 8 adults & 1 child!

I always add a cup of cheddar cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes of cooking. If you add eggs then drain your corn, if you don't add eggs the don't drain your can/cans of corn.

We've been making this forever and it couldn't be easier.  If you use a deeper dish, as opposed to a 9x13, it will take longer than 30 minutes to cook.  I always put the sour cream in it and I do drain the can of whole kernel corn.  It doesn't need anything added to it, it's just good.

A wonderful recipe, can be changed to suit you. I sometimes add a can of Mexicali corn & add a small can of green chilis, sometimes sprinkle top with Mexican stylw shredded cheese, totally yum! If not making it south of the border style, I add a 1/4 cup of sugar. Never  tried it with the eggs, I will try it, sounds really good.

I served this last night to a group of 14.  I don't know what I did wrong since so many like this recipe but I did not care for it.  It was gritty and mushy and I was embarrassed.  Are you suppose to mix the corn bread mix up as directed and then add.  I added it from the box and I suppose that made it gritty.

I found this recipe last holiday season and made it four times!  It was a hit each time...  I added two eggs and left out the butter.  I added a pinch of sugar and a dash of cayenne.  Delish!

I did not use sour cream...  but I did add a cup of cheese to the mix......  Shocker though is that my dh lovvvved it...  He had never had corn pudding before...  He hates cornbread and cream corn..  of course he had no clue was was in the recipe...  but he loves sweet type- savory type meal items...   He said most def  ****5 stars****- If you don't like sweet sides, don't make this or use reg corn meal mix and not "jiffy mix" as I did...  thx

This was good, but I had to cook it a lot longer than called for to get it done in the middle.  I will use a more shallow dish next time.

The only change I made the first time I made this was the addition of two eggs, as others have suggested.  I was really good.  I just made it again tonight and added about a cup of sugar and it was WONDERFUL!  Not only was it sweeter, but it turned out more custardy than it did the first time.  I will be making this again and again - with the tweaks, of course!

This recipe is fast and simple, I get requests every Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday, as well as gatherings during the year, from my family to make this Corn Pudding.  The best thing about it is its simplicity and doesn't take much room in the oven.  I highly recommend this dish.

Perfect creamy pudding. I used jiffy rmix prepared with 2 eggs and heavy cream and a touch of sugar. I drained most of the corn liquid. I can now stop searching for a recipe. Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and baked it for 45-50 minutes and it was delicious. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I felt it was lacking a bit of direction. I drained the whole kernel corn cans but NOT the cream corn cans. I also combined all the "wet" ingredients first and then added the corn bread mix and incorporated that well into the wet ingredients. Also make sure you incorporate the butter into the batter DO NOT just leave it in the pan. I will be making it again and again! I'm going to try it again with a gluten free corn bread mix.

IF YOU DOUBLE THE RECIPE, DOUBLE THE TIME!  I had read some of the reviews that said it took a little longer if you doubled, so I gave it another 10 min (total 40 min), and it was just as soupy as it was going in.  I moved it to a commercial convection oven (church kitchen), and after 20 or so more minutes, it was set.  I added the eggs as other recommended (4 eggs for the doubled recipe) and skipped the sour cream.  It fit perfectly in an aluminum toss-away casserole pan.  Despite the frustration with the cook time, it was really good.  I liked the texture - not as dense as corn bread, but a little more so than my other corn pudding recipes.  Just plan on an hour in the oven if you double it.  I will make this again.  I even plan on using the regular sized recipe for a regular family meal, and I don't know that I've ever made corn pudding that wasn't for a pot luck.  Very easy and good.

This was fantastic. Used the eggs as suggested and it was the perfect texture. I didn't have whole kernel corn so used all creamed corn and it worked just as good. Made a double batch for Thanksgiving and it was my favorite dish! Does have to cook much longer when you double it.

I have made this recipe for years and I can no longer arrive at a Thanksgiving celebration without it.  The only difference is ...1 egg, salt, pepper and garlic powder, all to taste. If I have a lot of dishes to prepare for the holidays, I will sometimes half cook the night before, so as to cut down on the cooking time the following day....-Lena

Very good side dish. Quick to make. I just added one egg. Turned out perfect. Also, I know it says the sour cream is optional. But, I used it and it made more creamy. So I would recommend using the sour cream. I will be making this again.

This is a great tasting and simple dish to make. It was a big hit at the holiday dinner. I used less sour cream which makes the recipe more like a very moist corn bread.

I have been making this corn casserole for years, and I also add two eggs. I want to remind everyone to drain the whole kernel corn, otherwise it will be too runny. Because of the corn muffin mix, it puffs up like a soufflé.  It is delicious as well as appealing.  I always add the sour cream.

Great easy recipe! I like that there is no cream in this. I also added two eggs along with cajun seasoning, 3 tablespoons of roasted red pepper, fresh pepper, 3 tablespoons of onion and 2 tablespoons of thyme--delicious!

Made this for first time yesterday for Thanksgiving. Used 2 eggs, 2 T splenda, light sour cream, and undrained corn. Very good!It's delicious cold for breakfast too. YUM. Next time I'll try it using nonfat greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and only one large egg, to make it healthier.

This recipe has become a holiday staple in my family now.  The only thing I do differently is add a few tablespoons of sugar to the mix, but that's because we like it sweet (and yes we do use the sour cream).

Fabulous! I did as others suggested and added 1 egg to the mix. Only thing to add, use a shallow casserole dish if you want the cooking time to be true and if, like me, you love more of that lightly-browned crunchy top crust!

Tasted really terrific, but a bit too runny for my taste. I retained the liquid from the canned corn and pureed the creamed corn to a smooth finish, which might have altered the way it baked. Added a splash of vanilla and only had corn MUFFIN mix (8.5 oz), so hey, maybe that is what changed the consistency...all in all, a yummy pudding. Will try with corn BREAD mix next time to find my consistency issue - gotta cancel out all the variables!

My goodness!! So very easy, and it was delicious. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. The corn bread mixture makes it extra yummy. I omitted the sour cream, and did NOT drain the corn. I will be making this again and again. It's a no-fuss dish - I was able to throw everything together and put it in the oven all while tending to the main course. Try this recipe!!

This was the all around favorite dish at my Thanksgiving! I doubled the recipe (putting it in a 9x13 baking dish) and pretty much made it as it said. No eggs, no sour cream. I left it in the oven a little too long so it would stay warm while everything else was getting made and it got brown and crispy in the bottom corners. Some people said they preferred those sections.

This was very tasty.  I followed the directions (and added 2 eggs) and was a little confused with the butter.  It pooled on top of the corn bread in places.  So after 30 minutes in the oven, I stirred it and baked for another 25 minutes.  That got me what I wanted.  And boy did it taste good!  Next time I'll reduce the butter to a half stick and see what happens.  Great with Simple Whole Roasted Chicken.  Thanks Elizabeth!

I remember buying a package of a mix that had this recipe on it... I didn't know it was just corn bread mix! :D  My boys are allergic to egg and the original recipe didn't call for egg, I do remember it calling for a bread pan and to keep in in the oven longer than 30 minutes, but not long enough to have the texture of bread.  We always loved it topped with chili.  I can't wait to try this recipe!

I made this for the first time for a larger crowd.  I easily doubled the recipe, and added eggs like one reviewer suggested...and voila!  It turned out to be a HUGE hit to my surprise, since it was not a "corn pudding" crowd!  Everyone raved about it.  It was moist, slightly sweet, dense, and had a great corn flavor.  Be sure to add 2 eggs, and sour cream for a rich, dense, moist texture.  I will definitely make again.  I was asked by several guests for the recipe too!  Excellent!

Easy and delicious recipe.  It produces a pudding with a texture like a very dense, moist bread.  The sour cream sets off the sweetness perfectly.  I would just clarify that I would be sure to use salted butter, OR add a bit of salt.  Also, make sure to cook it until it is completely set; if you take it out too soon, you will end up with a mushy texture.

This was delicious and so easy. I added the two eggs as previously mention. Excellant. This is a definite keeper that will be made again.

I've made this recipe around the holidays for years.  It always gets great reviews.  I've never added the sour cream before but after reading other reviews I'm going to try it.

Very yummy and delicious-a carb lover's dream.  Best eaten with melted butter.  Sweet yet not overbearing, creamy, and decadent-make with real butter instead of margarine and look out!

This a.m. I made the corn pudding for luncheon guests.  In the past I have made various corn breads and corn pudding...but this recipe beats them all.  I followed recipe almost exactly but took the advice of some of the suggestions in the other reviews.  I left the liquid in the corn, added the sour cream and two packets of Splenda plus two beaten eggs (with a fork).  It needed one hour at 350 deg. In addition I used Jiffy mix.  I ate so much of it that, for the first time, didn't have dessert.  It was soon easy to prepare and no mess.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's my new favorite.

best corn pudding recipe ever. I don't ever add eggs because we like the creaminess. I have had others with eggs and think they are kind of grainy.

This was a winner at my last potluck. I doubled the recipe and it worked out great. I did add the two eggs as others suggested. I also drained one can of the corn.  It was gone in minutes!

I followed the recipe, including the eggs and sour cream.  Added a can of green chilies and about 3/4 cup mixed shredded cheese to the mix as some others suggested.  I also mixed butter and margarine.  Sprinkled a little more cheese on top after about 30 minutes.  It needed around 45-50 to be completely done.  Turned out great.  May try the "corn fritter experiment with the left overs.

I made this according to suggestions, and it was fabulous!  I'm sure it'd be great as is also!  I actually had bags of frozen corn on hand, so I used that, I included the sour cream, added two eggs and 1/4 cup sugar.  It took about 1/2 an hour longer to cook because I made such a large batch.  I quadrupled the recipe and took it to a family gathering last night.  The first pan was gone almost instantly, and my godmother made me put the second pan in her freezer so she could have it another time!  Hahaha!  It was so delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I always prepare this for the holidays for my family. This is the first time I tried the recipe with packaged corn bread and my family wasn't as partial to it. It takes the pudding like consistency from the dish. The taste was decent but just not an overall favorite.

My grandmother use to make this years ago. Her recipe adds 2 eggs and 4 green onions chipped fine. You have to bake for 45 min if you add the eggs. However, either way, this is a great addition to holiday tables!

This is very tasty. I drained the water from the can corn. The recipe didn't say one way or the other. I also cooked it longer until the edges were browned. This is one the kids want third helpings.

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make. I have made this recipe 3 times. 1st time I used generic brand can corn and cream of corn. Not flavorful at all.  The second time I used Delmonte and Jiffy cornbread mix. Excellent taste. The third time I added 4oz more of the Jiffy cornbread mix to make it more cake like.  It taste a little gritty after it came out of the oven. After the flavors settled, it tasted exactly how I imagined.  It was no longer gritty.  That is the recipe for our home.  My family could not get enough. The next day it was even better. Thanks for the foundation. I gave a friend the recipe and she loves it just the way it is for her family. I told her where I got it from...All Recipes!  I just love this website.

The new winner for corn pudding recipes. I did make some changes by using duck eggs, fat free sour cream, honey butter cornbread mix,  2 tablespoons of raw sugar and a pinch of cinnamon. I also baked it covered with foil containing 3 slits for the first 20 minutes and uncovered until done from there.  Made enough for 12 people, should have made more. However only eight people were there..lol... This one is an annual keeper.

This was my first time making it, so I took lots of advice from other reviewers. I doubled the recipe and added three eggs, didn't drain the corn, mixed the melted butter in, and added a little shredded cheese. I pre-cooked it about 35 minutes the night before, then cooked it about 45 minutes the day of. It was a big hit. Will definitely do this one again.

I made this recipe with bis quick and corn meal with 2 eggs. I also topped it with honey when I served it. It was delicious. I wouldn't consider what I made pudding; it was more of an awesome corn bread.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit  I HALVED the butter and sour cream and it was very tasty and popular, melting the butter in the bottom of pan as suggested. I also drained the whole kernel corn (not suggested in recipe) and consistency was just right. No leftovers. SOOOO easy! Next time I will sprinkle some cinnamon as someone suggested. I used Jiffy Mix. I thought the original recipe lacked a few details.

Skip the sour creAm and drain the corn. So delish. Similar to something I used to get in New Orleans.

Definitely try the eggs (or egg whites). Better yet you can really reduce the sodium and fat and calories and add some protein by substituting plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. I have made a version of this with no butter at all, and with less butter. Both are still great!

I've been making this recipe for years. I do not drain the kernal corn. I usually make a double batch to feed everyone and I've even made it in a crock pot and it turned out perfectly. The corn muffin mix is dumped in directly from the box, this is the small size, I use Jiffy brand. I forgot the sour cream once and most people didn't mind it, although it really is better and creamier with it. I also have added sauteed onions and grated cheddar cheese - about 1/2 cup for a single recipe. Those additions were great too. I find it heard to botch this recipe. It's a good stand by, easy and inexpensive. If you like corn pudding or scalloped corn you should try this.

TASTY! This recipe is super easy (and super cheap, which helps when you're a poor college student like myself, haha). I also liked that it only required one dish and one spoon - easy cleanup! However I did follow some of the suggestions from other reviewers: I did not drain the liquid from the whole kernel corn, I decreased the butter to 1/3 cup (5 & 1/3 tbsp), and added two eggs. Additionally, I did not have any sour cream on hand so I substituted plain greek yogurt. Perhaps because of the extra liquid, the pudding require much longer to cook (maybe 15-20 additional minutes). Although, I'm afraid with out the extra liquid from the canned corn the result would have been more like a souffle, and I prefer a moist, dense pudding. With these modifications, I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a good recipe but after 30 minutes it was still liquid.  I think the sour cream lengthens the cook time.  I'll try it next time without the sour cream and see.

I doubled the recipe and this came out rather mushy, the bread seemed to be cooked enough but the dish itself seemed a little under done. It is basically a fancy version of creamed corn, I might try this again without doubling it and with less liquid from the canned corn to see if it comes out better next time.

I made this recipe just as it was written and it was good but very buttery. Then I made it again and left out the butter all together. It was just as fabulous and much healthier. It doesn't need the butter at all! Either way you make it, it takes closer to an hour to cook in a two quart casserole dish.

Really like this! It is a tad on the heavy side, could be a little tiny bit lighter, but other than that it had a great flavor and is definitely a comfort food!  I think this is a great dish to bring to a potluck or gathering.  This recipe makes a lot.

This was very good! I made a few personal changes: I added a bit of sugar and only about half a container of sour cream. I also took the advice of others and added two eggs to the mix. The result was a bit cake-like, not too eggy, not too wet or pudding-y (which I prefer!). Also, I used frozen corn, which I thawed a bit in cold water. This for me is very close to being the quintessential corn pudding--the only thing I will try to experiment with in the future is the crispness of the top. Mine did not turn out crisp, but was finished nevertheless. Being that my husband enjoyed the crisp sides so much though, I will experiment later with crisping the top.

This is delish ... and a keeper! I did drain the corn from the can. I did NOT add sour cream. The recipe did not call for eggs or milk, so I did not add them either. I used a 9x13 baking dish. The only difficult time I had was figuring out how to measure 1/4 lb. butter, from a stick of butter. (Yes, I'm a beginner cook.)

I doesn't get any easier than this quick side dish. It can pass for for el torito's and chevy'sweet corn tomatillo! A little to wet but next time maybe I won't include all the liquid from the can of corn or add more cornbread mixture.Great taste! Will be making this again and again!

This was a truly easy and simple recipe.  I liked the fact that it didn't call for eggs, giving it a more 'pudding' texture.  I double the recipe making it in a 9x13 and adding 10 more minutes to the cook time.  Its always a hit at get-togethers!

i'm giving this recipe, as is, 3 stars because it was good, but not fantastic. i doubled the recipe and changed up the second batch & would give that one 5 stars.  i added: 1 c shredded cheddar, about 1/4 cup (maybe a smidge more) chopped jalapenos (from a jar), and some garlic powder.  also, i left the corn "juice" in this one, and drained the corn before putting it in the "normal" one.  the jalapeno cheese one was the favorite dish at our thanksgiving pre-feast potluck last night.  it was very hot and full of flavor.  VERY moist due to corn juice - thought it wasn't cooked through.  can't say which consistency we liked best, but the flavor of the jala one was awesome.  will definitely make that way again - probably for thanksgiving thursday! i did put the sour cream in both of them - think that's important.

My boyfriend recently introduced me to this recipe and it is one of my favorites. We decided to try the version with corn meal and I have to say the best thing is baking your own bread and tearing off small chunks to put in it instead of the corn meal.

Wonderful.  I've taken a batch of this to several people, along with a pot of chili.  My sister wants to create a chain of restaurants around this dish.

I can only give this one 1 stars at this stage of the game.  I made this the other night and it didn’t turn out well at all.  I followed the recipe but for whatever reason-I know how to cook so I’m willing to take the fall-it came out a gloopy mess.  I swear at first I thought I had forgotten to turn on the oven!  Anyway, I love corn pudding so I will attempt this one again another time.  At that time I will either update and/or delete this review, I promise!

Quick and easy corn pudding recipe--just what I was looking for!  Next time, I think I will add the eggs, as suggested, as well as possibly substituting the sour cream with French onion dip.  Great dish for a fast dinner!

I used a can of gold and white corn in place of the regular whole kernel corn for a sweeter taste and added two beaten eggs to the mix as others had done. Came out awesome!

I host an "Orphan" Thanksgiving at my home every year and since I served this Cord Pudding recipe (Tripled!) It's the first menu request out of the mouths of invited guests!

It's the biggest payoff for the least work!

I used 2 boxes of jiffy mix,and 1/2can of condensed milk, 3 eggs along with the sour cream. I also put the whole kernel corn in the blender.  I was absolutely pleased how it turned out. I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Wow this was a big hit at the family Christmas dinner today! No leftovers! Lots of compliments! I doubled the recipe & made it in a 9x13. I had a green bean casserole cooking along side it for the 1st 30 minutes but it ended up needing about 50 minutes total! Easy and delicious! I’ll definitely be making this again!

I followed the advice of reviewers and added two eggs and didn't drain the corn and did not use the sour cream. I added just a small splash of almond milk. It took longer to bake than 30 min, but it turned out to be a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner with my fam. Will definitely make again.

Just made this for the first time formThanksgiving dinner.  It was as easy as it was good, better than some of the more labor-intensive recipes I’ve tried.  I did add a couple of eggs which I do think gave it a better consistency.

I added one egg, omitted sour cream, and baked for 35 minutes at 350. I served it with Turkey Chili on a very cold autumn evening and it was wonderful.

Yummy as a fresh & hot side dish, as cold straight-out-of-the-fridge leftovers and as re-warmed snacks... If it lasts that long.
... and cleaning the baking dish is a do-the-dishes-incentive... I will definitely be adding this to my recipe-rotation and I highly recommend this for any home-cooking special occasion

I should have made it following the recipe instead I read some of the reviews and added 2 eggs. It was too thick like so when I make it again I will follow the recipe exactly. My mistake.

I make this exactly as is (leaving out the sour cream). It always turns out amazing. I usually sprinkle some sugar on at the end. Either way, it’s so yummy. Make sure not to drain the whole kernel corn!

I really liked this pudding, I have never been able to make a moist corn bread, but this is really nice, its crusty on the outside and soft and delish on the inside and very easy to prepare. I t will be a side dish for me from now on when I feel like having it. Its also surprisingly sweet, fyi

I am NOT much of a cook, and when I found this recipe, I figured it sounded delicious, and simple enough to make.  As many comments suggested, I added 2 eggs into the mix.  As I LOVE Garlic, I also added some garlic powder in the mix.  I also added some shredded cheese and fried onions to the top after about 25 minutes.  Total cook time was around 40-45 minutes for me.

This is an amazing recipe!  Based on reviews by others, I made the following slight changes: added  2 eggs, did not drain the can of corn, added 1/2 c of plain yogurt (rather than sour cream), and added 1/4 cup sugar.  This is a keeper!

One of my favorite go-to's for a quick and easy potluck dish. The eggs and sour cream are a good addition. Doubling for a 9" x 13" pan is super easy. Made it for a Thanksgiving potluck for my class, and my students remembered and requested it the following year.

I did make changes.  Added 2 eggs, some sour cream and sugar, and cooked in a deep 10" stainless steel pan at 355 for one hour. My oven doesn't maintain heat that well so that might account for the longer time. It was excellent, creamy and the consistency was perfect. I'm only one person so I froze  the rest in several small containers.  I hope that doesn't change the consistency.

I've made this several times and have always enjoyed it. This year I decided to add a little oomph to it. I included about a quarter of a yellow bell pepper, less than half of a small jalapeño, and the white part of a green onion - all diced. Put these in the bottom of the casserole dish along with the butter when melting. Also, to make it creamier and less corn-bready, I left out about 1/4 cup of the Jiffy mix. I also reduced the sour cream by nearly half. Lastly, I diced the green part of the green onion stalk and sprinkled that on top. (And I did use two eggs.) RAVE reviews. "Best ever" and "Can I have the recipe?" I'll make it this way from now on. The additional flavors were not over-powering, but they definitely added that bit of oomph, taking this old standby to the next level.

My entire family loved this.  I drained the whole kernel corn but not the cream-style corn and added the sour cream as well as 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of sugar.  It took about 40 minutes to cook.  Delicious!

Mine I believe is ruined because correct me if I am wrong but are you supposed to make the corn muffin mix BEFORE you mix in with corn and sour cream? The recipe did not state to do so but in regards to the comments I see people saying add eggs and such which this recipe did not say to do so. ;(

I didn't have creamed corn, so I used 2 cans of kernel corn (used the juice from one of the cans), added 1/2 cup milk, some sugar and 2 eggs.  I will probably add add a little more milk next time.  Got a lot of compliments on it.  I guess it's become my new dish at family get togethers!

I made a version of this...had to tweak it some mostly based on ingredients I had and some food allergies in my family.  I used frozen corn but blended 1/2 of it (to "cream it") with Emerson blender with Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream), 2 eggs (I used egg substitute), and added 1 small box of instant vanilla pudding mix and 1/2cup milk...whole family enjoyed

I have always been wanting to make corn pudding and I had company for dinner and decided to give it a try.  I tweaked it a little by adding 2 eggs, not draining the whole kernel corn and adding 1/2 tsp. of salt.  It did however take longer to cook than the 30 minutes due to the eggs so I baked it for 1 hour at 350 degrees and it was perfect.  It puffed up like a soufflé and my guests LOVED IT!!!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This dish is excellent and very easy to make.  Multiple people requested the recipe.  I doubled  the ingredients and baked for around 50 minutes in a 9x13 in pan.   I did modify by using Mexi Canned Corn and added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper, three eggs, and a half cup of white sugar.  Typical additions for other southern corn recipes.

I make it with the sour cream and add an egg. Can also be made with half the suggested  amount of butter. Must be baked a lot longer than 30 minutes.  I left it in 40 and the inside was still soupy. **Edited to add:
I just made this again without the sour cream so I added the whole stick of butter. It would've been fine with half the butter like I usually do.

This is a standard at my home and has become part of our regular holiday tradition.  I also like to make it any time of year. Everyone loves it and it brings back memories of home.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I tend to cook it a little longer than suggested, it takes about 45 minutes for it to reach the right consistency.

This was a simple & delicious addition to our Thanksgiving feast . I used a sweet cornbread mix, so the sour cream really added the savory to the sweetness of the corn. I've already shared this recipe w/ friends,and will definitely be making it again!

Tasted very good. Maybe don't add all the eggs it took way longer to cook and was not done enough.  I doubled the recipe when I made it also. Next time ill try not doing so much egg and butter or water..

This is SUPER easy (feels like cheating) & it was delicious.  Made it for 2 different Thanksgiving meals & everyone enjoyed it.  

Do like everyone says.  Add 2 eggs & drain the corn.  I used 1 container of sour cream for 2 batches & I added Mexican shredded cheese to the last 10 minutes of baking.  I think I baked it an extra 10 minutes at a lower temp because I had a dark pan.  It was perfect.  The only change I will make next time is adding more corn (I like it chunky).

After last Thanksgivings mistake with the candied yams, I decided to try this Corn Pudding recipe. 

I made it exactly as written and everyone loved it!

It came out really well and there was no left overs. 

My mother in law and my mother told me that it was a keeper. They also told me to make at New Years.

Finally something came out right! I think they were getting tired of Green Bean Casserole lol

Thank you!

I didn't grow up with this, but a friend who often invited me to Thanksgiving when I lived in NYC made it. I've been craving it lately. It was similar to hers and the scoop of corn cake served at Chevy's. I made a double batch, which filled a 9x13 dish, plus two ~6" ramekins. I baked the ramekins on a baking sheet for about 45 minutes. I turned the oven off and left the 9x13" pan in. The sides were brown, similar to baked stuffing. The tops were not crusted, except one I put cheese on. I used what I had on hand: 2 Jiffy corn muffin mixes, 15 oz can creamed corn, 30 oz can whole kernel corn (that's 15 oz less than called for, but it was plenty of corn), 3 eggs, about 8 oz of a 10 oz can of condensed cheddar cheese soup (sub for sour cream), 1.5 C sugar, the melted butter (1 stick, forgot to dbl), 1 C shredded cheddar cheese, and half the juice from the corn. I wasn't sure if the juice would be too much, so I strained it first. It was about a cup total, so I used about 1/2 C. I eyeballed it, assuming it should be thinner than  cornbread/muffins batter. If you like it dense, you would not want both the corn juice & 2 eggs. At first, I was disappointed it was too thick, but it was perfect: dense, but soft, and creamy. Couldn't taste the cheese, except on top of the one ramekin, so I don't know how much difference it made to the taste or texture. Could have used 1 cup of sugar, it was about as sweet as Chevy's. It's amazing. I'm glad I made enough to freeze!

I added 2 eggs, added the water from the canned corn, some extra corn from a shucked fresh ear  to make it more corny and sweeter, the sour cream and some seasoned salt.  Turned out moist and perfect,  the key is the eggs and cooking in a shallow pan, took about 30 minutes till the center wasn't jiggly and a knife inserted in center came out clean. The 2 eggs help bind the extra liquid from the canned corn and the sour cream with the rest of the ingredients, just like eggs do in a soufflé, French toast, meatloaf or stuffing.  I've made this recipe for the holidays and gotten rave reviews, it appears every thanksgiving, Xmas and Easter now.  Plus it's good comfort food anytime, works well at potlucks too.  The butter in the bottom of a hot pan does the same trick as in cornbread cooked in a cast iron skillet with extra butter melted in the bottom, you'll get the tasty golden brown crispy edges, but if you'd like to save some calories, opt out of the butter and use some Pam spray instead, edges still get a little crispy anyway. If you double the recipe or cook in a deep pan be prepared to increase or double the cook time.  This is a fantastic recipe with the additions!

I followed the recipe, then I read the reviews. Mine came out  mushy. After reading the reviews. I discovered that eggs should be used in the recipe.The original recipe does not show eggs needed. I was disappointed. But it tasted OK. Next time I will use eggs.

Great side dish for bbqs and Thanksgiving.  Be sure to drain the corn. No need for eggs or sour cream. Very simple and tasty recipe. Just melt your butter in your baking dish, mix everything together in the baking dish and bake.

Great recipe for pot lucks, as well as home; I always have to double it to have enough. I mix it in a bowl with 2 eggs per recipe (thus 4 ), and pour it into the melted butter in the pan.  People have asked if this is a family recipe, and I tell them it was somebody's family recipe, but not mine.  Thanks for sharing.

Tasted great.  Took much longer to cook than expected but I'm using a new oven.

This has become a big hit with my family! I like it better with the sour cream.

I added to two eggs as suggested and the 2 tsp of sugar. I used the sour cream and a jiffy cornbread mix.  It required longer baking time in the 8x8 glass pan that I used. I just watched until middle looked set. Due to needing other items in my oven at the same time, I increased the temp to 400 degrees F after 40 min of baking time had elapsed and that helped the middle to set in about ten minutes more. Each oven is different, though, so keep an eye on it if you raise the temp. It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving.

I've made a similar version of this for a couple years now. I add a small chopped onion, a small chopped bell pepper, 8 ounces sour cream mixed with a cup of cheddar cheese. Even the grand kids like it!

I've made this too many times to count.  Has become "tradition."  I don't use Sour Cream, but Cream Cheese.  Be sure to use all the liquid in the can of corn, don't pour it out!

Very simple recipe, yet delicious. I add green chiles and shredded cheese for a little zesty element. I also add the egg per most corn muffin mix directions. My family loves it.

It is definitely a family tradition for my family, my sister's hands down favorite holiday dish, and the first one to go! We have made it every year without fail for both Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. It is a recipe I will get from my mom and make myself with my family one day. :) 
Don't forget! My family always tops it with a whole bag of shredded cheese too!!!

Great food - added 2 eggs as suggested and a small can of chilies. The added moisture required a 20 minute increase in cooking time.

I just made it and I haven't had any in a long time so I'm hoping it's cooked through. I do think you should use less butter perhaps a stick of butter instead of two. I also mixed the two cans of corn together in a bowl with the corn bread mix and used a little bit of milk to make it moist.

I love this recipe as is.  I make a few additions to give it a kick though.  I use two packages of muffin mix, two eggs, one bag of cheddar, and two small cans of green chilis.  It gives the recipe a southern feel.  I also like the addition of the eggs and extra corn mix package because I am a fan of a more cakey casserole.  

I have also tried the above additions and chopped bacon.  This recipe has so many possibilities.

Fast & delicious!  I didn't read the reviews prior to making this dish, so I pretty much made as it is written.  I debated as to whether or not to keep the liquid from the corn kernels since that wasn't mentioned, but glad I ended up using it in the recipe.  I only made a couple adjustments so it would marry up well with my main Mexican chicken dish. I added chopped chili peppers and a pinch of Splenda - OMG - delicious!  Thank you for sharing such a terrific recipe!

My mother-n-law gave me this recipe. I use 2 cans of cream corn instead of the 1 can of whole kernel. To me it's even better that way. Everybody loves it and ask for it.

I love corn pudding so I am planning on trying this one, but I am going to layer a can of chili and shredded cheese on top. I do this with the recipe I have and my family loves it. This recipe sounds enticing because I've never used sour cream in the pudding before.

The eggs help bind and you must add garlic and mild green chilies to this for flavor!  Goes great with any BBQ meat!  I also add shredded sharp cheddar!

I have made this dish for years. I add two eggs. I also add a bit of sugar to sweeten it a bit. It is an amazing dish for Thanksgiving. I have also left out the sugar and added a can of chopped green chiles to make it more Mexican. Great stuff. I could eat it all myself!

I have made this particular recipe for years, it's always a huge hit and there's never left-overs - the only changes I've made are:  I drain any liquid from the whole kernel corn and just before it's done top the casserole with 1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded 2% cheddar cheese (my family is cheese-crazy). I have never added eggs, I use unsalted "veggies" when I can, unsalted butter and low-fat sour cream. This is so yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as is except (haha) for using fresh corn from the cob.  I'm sure that gave it an even better flavor BUT the key is that I did not add eggs, milk or any seasonings.  Everyone in my family loved this recipe the last 3 times I have made it.  We actually keep cornbread mix and frozen sweet corn on hand just to make this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

Loved this corn pudding recipe. I added the sour and two eggs suggested. I used a 7 inch round casserole dish and it took about an hour and 15 minutes to bake but it was creamy, rich and very yummy. My 18 month old really enjoyed as well.

This is very similar to my "good 'ole standby" corn recipe.  The main difference being using a 2-qt. casserole dish rather than a 13 x 9 pan.  It was very good, but the finished product was a lot more "wet" than what we are used to.  I fixed this with 'Brown Sugar and Pineapple Glazed Ham' from AR and we had a nice meal.

Made this for Christmas and it was delicious!! I had to bake it for an hour though because my dish was a little deep and it was still runny in the center at 30 minutes. It was super easy to make though and I will be making it again I am sure.

I did a trial run of this recipe for corn pudding with the intent of using it for Thanksgiving dinner. Mine came out exactly like the photo but I was disappointed. There was nothing memorable about this dish. It lacks color and pizazz. I will keep searching for other options.

Brought this dish to a pig roast potluck last weekend. It was voted the favorite side dish by the 40 attendees!  I added some finely chopped sweet red pepper to give it a little color. Easy to make and tasty. With sour cream, took about 50 minutes (not 30) to finish baking. Tested by sticking a knife in the center until it came out clean. Crisp crust and soft inside -- perfect!

It turned out really well, I cooked it 15 minutes longer than required (to make it less soupy) and added 1 cup of shredded cheese during the last 15 minutes. I decided I'd try this recipe because my family usually gets together for Thanksgiving dinner and this is the first dish to go. So instead of being sad I didn't get seconds or any to take home, I figured I'd make my own stash!

I made this recipe from another source and you can also add cubed ham as that is how my recipe was written and it gives it more substance.  2 eggs is a good idea, I will do that next time.

Love this recipe with a couple of modifications: I use 3+ cups of frozen corn instead of the creamed and canned corn, 3 eggs, and add dehydrated onions.  I also melt the butter and pour it over top of the batter; it just sits on top while it cooks, then soaks in once it is removed from the oven.  Perfect!

My sister made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago and it was an big hit. Now we can't have a holiday dinner without it.

I get asked for this recipe when I make it for dinner guests. I'm embarassed to tel them how easy it is!

I use this recipe every Thanksgiving.  I call it Rose's Corn Pudding because the recipe is from my cousin's mother in law.  It's so yummy and everybody loves it.  Plus, it's the easiest recipe to make!  You'd be making a mistake not to make this recipe.

Made this and brought it to Thanksgiving dinner--it was a HUGE hit! Everyone asked for the recipe. I used a can of creamed corn and a can of frozen corn kernals (thawed), and sprinkled the top lightly with sugar before baking.  It had the taste and consistency of tamales. Yumm!

So easy to make and it was delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.  I had to bake it a little longer than specified, though.

Great Dish.  I took this to a church potluck and had to give ot the recipe.  I will definately make this again.  Everyone loved that it was not sweet or full of sugar.  Uber easy to make as well

Got this from a friend years ago.  He called it "Corn, corn, corn and corn."  It has become a Tgiving standard.

Have made this twice. The first time I used eggs as suggested by other reviewers and it was a winner, the second time I was out of eggs and it was still good but had to increase the cooking time by 10 minutes to get it done in the middle. The natural sweet taste of the corn made this dish a winner.
