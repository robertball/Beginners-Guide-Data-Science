My family loved this recipe. I doubled this for my large family size, and added about 1 cup of milk to the vegy/soup mixture. I also sprinkled cooked/crumbled bacon over the beef once it was in the baking dish. The bacon makes all the difference. Thanks, I will make this again.

I love this title!! Perfect casserole for hard working MOMS. I had2 boxes of scalloped potatoes and canned milk. I added the cheese sauce mix and the milk to make up for my lack of cream of mushroom soup. This was tasty and rib sticking. Thank You Kristen

Mom made this when my sister and I were kids. Instead of using frozen mixed veggies, Mom would use frozen broccoli. She also doubled the cheese. I want to say she added whatever spices she had on hand as well and added a soup can of milk. Great to make to take a walk down memory lane, but needs a little more gussied up for me now.

My family loved this recipe. I also added about 1/2 can of milk to the soup mixture. And I sprinkled onion powdered on the ground beef. (Next time I might throw in some chopped onion). I also used frozen green peas as the vegetable, I didn't think the mixed vegetables would be good. I will definately make this recipe over and over again. Another thing, I did not peel the potatoes!

This recipe is yummy, we tried it with cream of onion soup (it's Campbell's & hard to find) since I don't like cream of mushroom. I also used a package of frozen onion, green, yellow, & red peppers. Hubby and kids said we should eat it every week!

Very bland. I made this twice. The second time I used the frozen cubed potatoes (next to the hash browns). It turned out faster, and I followed another reviewers ideas and it was better.

It was good. To better it, i would use ground pork, instead of beef. Also instead of frozen veggies, i use fresh cooked ones, tastes much better better... And, of course, more soup (2 cans), definately.

This is a good basic casserole and easy to make with what is in the pantry.  Like other reviewers I added some spices such as italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder.

This was very good and very easy.  Like previous reviewers I added spices to increase the flavors... cumin, italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, in addition to the salt and pepper.  Yum, will definitely make again.

This recipe has potential. I thought it lacked a bit of spice, so next time [yes, there will be a next time:)] I will add some garlic and maybe onions with the meat. Maybe try various spices. I used extra lean ground beef, because I prefer it. I only used the one can of soup, and thought is was enough liquid. The frozen vegetables has a bit bit of liquid in them, so using 2 cans would make it to soupy in my opinio

My husband loved this.  Very quick and easy and great on a cold night.  I used canned green beans instead of the mixed frozen vegetables.  It was good, but I think the mixed veggies would have added more flavor and texture.  I also added a small can (4oz) of diced green chiles.  Next time I will add two cans of chiles.  Per the other reviews, I did add an extra can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  It was a little soupy for me, but would have been too dry without it.  Next time I will go with one can of soup and a little milk.

I have made this for my family more than once and they love it. I love being asked what's for dinner when I cook this meal so I can say "I don't know"!  It's not difficult, it's tasty and at least includes vegetables.

I make a recipe very similar to this one but instead of ground beef i use ground turkey; its much cheaper, much leaner, and honestly no one would ever taste the difference. Also I use tater tots in place of the sliced potatoes;make sure they are nice and crispy YUM. Also I throw in a chopped onion in with the ground turkey along with some S&P and garlic.

This is a nice and hearty casserole, but it was kind of bland.  I added some crumbled bacon on top and that helped but the recipe really needs some more seasoning...maybe garlic powder or I see someone used onion powder.  That would certainly help.  This makes a good leftover, but I now eat it with ketchup.

This has become a family favorite, my husband asked me what was for dinner I told him I didn't care, he told me he didn't know. So he decided to Google " recipe for I don't know" this came up and we gave it a go needless to say I'm making I don't know for dinner again tonight, the only thing we did different was cream of chicken instead because I don't like cream of mushroom.

Sounds good. I bet some modicum of randomness would add variety to I don't Know. Microwave up some I Don't Know when you have several leftovers in the fridge that you want to knock out.

I love this recipe! And my family liked it to!
Only thing I would change, maybe put 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. And a little more cheese on top ;) my family loves cheese
