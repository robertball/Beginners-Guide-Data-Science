It was so easy to make and absolutely yummy. I threw in some cherry tomatoes for added color and flavor.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was lacking any flavor. My family and my mother thought the same thing.

Good and light. I think there's a lot of rating inflation in general. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's good..

Tastes kind of bland. I had to season like crazy and eat it with hot sauce...but I guess this is healthy

Fast and Easy!!!  I added one can (6oz) Dave's King Salmon.  I also added pear tomatoes.  I didn't have pistachios on hand and I don't think it would add that much.  Basil is unnecessary too.  A very nutricious meal.

Thought this was delicious.  Added extra salt and pepper and high quality grated parmeasn/romano cheese.  Heated slightly the next day for lunch-even better!

Thanks for the recipe! What a light & refreshing way to fix smoked salmon. Don't be bashful with the salt & pepper. I had to keep re-seasoning because it didn't want to hold a flavor.  I will definitely make this again although I will make a few changes like using more salmon and maybe adding some onions.

Very light and refreshing meal! I used baked fresh salmon, added red onion and diced tomatoes; exchanged toasted pine nuts for pistachios, because that's what I had around the house. Husband loved it, and he's a picky seafood eater.

Really good and easy to make!  I took a lot of liberty with this recipe...used more than half a pound of fresh salmon and mixed it with a bit less pasta than recommended.  I think the lemon added a lot of flavor.  Also, it was served warm.  Will definitely make again...

This is a great dish on a nice spring day.  Make sure that it fully comes to room temp before serving though so that the flavors can really blend.

I made this recipe for dinner last night.  I used gluten free pasta and canned Alaskan salmon because I didn't have any smoked salmon.  I also substituted toasted pine nuts for the pistachios because I didn't have any pistachios.  My husband raved about it and told me I could make it again anytime.  I bet it would be good warm too.
