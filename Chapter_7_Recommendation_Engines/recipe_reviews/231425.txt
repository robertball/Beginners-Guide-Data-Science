This was pretty good. Very pretty. I made a homemade angel food cake because I don't like the taste of store bought. The cheesecake pudding was not very cheesecakey. If I made this again I would use the filling from a Jello No Bake mix. Tasty cool dessert for a hot summer day.

It was a very lovely dessert to look at, but, once tasted it wasn't anything special.  It was a light dessert that was enhanced by the fresh fruit, but, it basically just tasted like a layered pudding parfait. I also prefer pound cake to the angel food cake used in this recipe only because it became a little soggy from the pudding.

It was too thick & too much. If I make it again, I'll use less pudding so it won't be too thick. It needs other flavors as well. Had too much of an instant vanilla taste

I made this to take to dinner at someone's home.  It was very popular. I made a couple of changes and was happy with the result. I added raspberries to the strawberries and blueberries. I made whipped cream pretty well sweetened to use instead of the whipped topping. I placed a dozen raspberries around the top and sprinkled it with slivered almonds.  It all worked well and was a big success. My husband and I ate the leftovers the next night and it was still delicious.
