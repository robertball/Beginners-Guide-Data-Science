Really like recipe. First time I made muffins they were a little dry. So the second time I made, I added more coconut oil, a banana and carob chips. The muffin was absolutely delicious. My new breakfast muffins that is also healthy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Definitely will.. Delicious !

Though I would like to know how much is the calorie intake of one of these muffins?  It is not written in your recipe along with the nutrients please.  Would be great to know.  Thank you.

The taste was good, but mine did not rise at all. Did not look like the pic in the least. I followed the directions completely. What did I do wrong?
