This is dry like alot of chicken dishes, my trick for all chicken I make is to marinate in BUTTERMILK for 30-40 minutes.  Makes any piece of chicken tender no matter how you cook it. Hope this helps

Kiev has always been the requested "birthday" meal, even now that my children are adults and home for a visit.  Also was the end of term foods lab test for my high school classes.  If it did not "squirt butter" you did not get full marks :-) so here are a few tweeks to an already good recipe.  Include oregano, parsley & real minced garlic to the chilled butter.  Once wrapped around the butter, first roll the chicken in seasoned flour, then the egg wash, then the seasoned bread, cracker or potato chip (plain) crumbs THEN wrap tightly in wax paper and chill for at least a half hour, longer if time allows.  Can be made a day ahead.  Only unwrap when you are ready to place in the hot fat.  This avoids the need for tooth picks completely.

A lot of work but very tasty. To keep it a bit healthier, I baked in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes and it browned up nicely.

This was FANTASTIC!! Fairly easy to prepare, & the taste is incredible! The only thing I had a prob with is using toothpicks to hold it together. I LOVE the way the butter squirts out when you cut into the chicken. I made this for my in-laws & they LOVED it! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

At our lake cottage without any cookbooks, I wanted to make chicken kiev so went online and found this great recipe. My nineteen year old daughter, the food critic, loved it, as did we all.

This was delicious.  Sure there's a mistake in quoting 6 cubes of butter versus 8 chicken breasts but the contributor goes on to state that 1 cube of butter is required for each chicken breast.  Obviously you are meant to cut 8 cubes of butter.  It was an honest mistake/typo.

Let me admit this first:  I did not read the entire recipie before proceeding so I ended up taking short cuts.  I did not make the seasoned butter.  I just sprinkled the pepper & garlic (I used garlic salt) on the Chicken & rolled in the pat of butter.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GOOD STRONG TOOTHPICKS!!!  I breaded it but didn't put in the fridge.  I fried it right away.  The taste was still INCREDIBLE!  My family LOVED it.

William, you have a really good personal recipe here! Thanks for sharing it!


I don't keep bread crumbs on hand because I prefer the lighter, crispier Panko crumbs so used them instead. I also sprinkled one tablespoon of Panko on each piece of butter just before rolling the chicken to add more depth in the center.


I am with others who are disgusted at the juvenile comments being left here! 


For those who mentioned the chicken being dry either the oil was probably not the right temperature and/or was over cooked. One other possibility is that they're simply not a white meat lover (white meat generally is on the dryer side) so just use chicken thigh meat instead.

Have made this a few times and on the 2nd time the chicken after frying was still a bit raw, so I took to putting it in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400F afterwards and not worrying about how well done it has to be on the skillet. I don't bother with the toothpicks. After it is rolled in the bread crumbs, I just put it seam down right on the skillet and it seals  it nicely.

I had never made Chicken Kiev before, but found out it's one of hubby's favorite recipes, so thought I'd try it.  I picked THIS ONE and it was GREAT!!!  I actually didn't get to serve it the evening I prepared it, and was worried about the coating being soggy, but it still turned out GREAT!!! ~ I don't think I made any changes, maybe some more seasonings to the chicken and/or flour, but tried to stick to the recipe this time FOR ONCE lol :o) Thank you!! ~It's a KEEPER!!!

Absolutely perfect!  I didn't change a thing and it came out beautifully. Tender and juicy, and FULL of flavor. I was surprised but the chicken sealed itself around the edges, so the butter never leaked out.

Very filling and great for my crowded table.

My only suggestion - because stove temperatures vary, make sure the oil isn't too hot or the chicken won't cook all the way in the center.

Instead of pounding out the chicken if you cut a pocket in the thickest part. Insert filling.  Push flesh together and let sit in Fridge for 20 minutes then bread it make it a lot easier (in my opinion)  enjoy.

This was very good. I'm impressed I actually was able to contain the butter, so that once you cut the chicken the butter squirts out. I didn't use toothpicks...I just placed it in the pan seam side down first. I browned both sides then put the whole pan right in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Next time I will have to add more of the spices. I liked the flavor, so I wouldn't change the spices...just add more of them. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing my favorite dish from the famous restaurant...the Russian Tea Room in NYC.

Takes WAY more fry time than is listed. Fried them for 10-15 minutes on each side and they were still uncooked in the middle. This was too much effort and hassle for a mediocre outcome, I will not be making this again.

So delicious! Changed the dried dill with fresh dill. Used panko instead of bread crumbs. And on cooking, I fry on a cast iron pan for 5 mins each side. Then put it in the oven for 20 mins to cook all the way thru. I love this recipe.

This receipe has been a favorite of mine and my family for years.  I've been making it for forty years or so.  And when made right, nothing can beat it.  Why someone would say it was dry is beyond me.  They should say actually how they made it, because if you go according do any directions for chicken kiev, it won't be dry.  Absolutely great!

I made this yesterday for my mom, dad and hubby. Hubby was hesitant at first as he doesn't like boneless skinless breast at all. Well he actually loved it. He said it was the first breast he ate that was moist and full of flavor. I was happy that it fried to a beautiful color in the time stated on the recipie. It was quite a challenge to get them rolled up tight and secure, then floured, dipped and breaded again. More work than I anticipated, BUT well worth it. I did use the suggestion from another review in that after I completed the the rolls, I put them in the freezer for 1/2 an hr. and then in the fridge for 2 more hours before I cooked them. I didn't use any toothpicks and to my surprise they stayed together beautifully. When I went to cut my mom's (she had a stroke and can't cut her own food) well OMG the butter squirted out and she was look om my that is so beautiful and juicy. This well be a spacial occasion dish because of the work involved, BUT thank-you for sharing, Brenda

I made this last night for friends, and we all loved it.  I did, however, fry them in our chip fryer, and then was not sure how long to do so, as I did not really need to turn them.  I tested one after about 5 minutes, and even though it was fun to see the butter squirt out, the centre was not done yet.  Even at that stage the cooked part tasted fantastic!  So I probably cooked them for 7 to 8 minutes in total.  Problem is we did not want to eat immediately, and the butter seemed to melt away inside.  Really loved the taste and appearance, but believe it has to be eaten immediately after being cooked.

This was pretty good, but there was a lack of seasoning (salt) which I thought could be overlooked but very noticeable when eating it. Agree with reviewers that making a slit in the chicken would be easier than pounding, but the chicken held together well in the pan when rolled and skewered. All the flavored butter oozed out; maybe this would not happen if the breasts were slit and not pounded.

This recipe suffers from a total lack of salt (unless you use salted butter). I use unsalted butter, so I added 1/4 tsp. salt to the butter and also the flour. I oven-baked mine and mine came out looking very sad & anemic but I think that's because I forgot the golden rule of flour-eggs-bread and went eggs-flour-bread (so as you can imagine the bread crumbs didn't stick and I think this is ultimately why it didn't brown.) My chickens were done in 20 minutes at 400 degrees. P.S. Do not use Italian bread crumbs in this recipe; I guarantee you won't like how it tastes with dill. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Instead of pounding the chicken, make a slit in the thickest side of the breast without going through and stick the hardened butter mixture in it and then smooth the chicken over it.  If you chill it for about 15 to 30 minutes, you won't have to use tooth picks then finish as recipe says.  I got that info from America's Test Kitchen and it really works.  It's very successful with cordon bleu also.

This was very good, very light flavor. I used Panko bread crumbs and baked instead of deep frying.

I would like to try making these again, but I don't think I'm a good chicken pounder and roller upper :( It's an awkward process for me. But for my first time making chicken kiev this was a really good recipe to go off of. After trying some of the kievs I had to salt them before rolling them up, and I think next time I would like to add other kinds of ingredients for more flavor. Overall my family was quite happy with them :)

This was a really great dish but only if you are a fairly advanced cook. It was slightly out of my range so it didn't turn out as well as i would have liked. For beginners such as myself, I would recommend butterflying the chicken instead of cutting it in half, so it's easier to encase the butter. I would also recommend tying the chicken with cooking twine instead of using toothpicks, because it holds it more securely, but over all this was a great recipe!

OMG!!! i have never rated a recipe before but this one was DEFINITELY yummy! i used panko crumbs instead of dry bread for an extra crunch and added some salt and garlic powder to the flour mixture but besides that, I stuck to the recipe. It was a little messy but i loved it and my son loved helping me roll the butter in the chicken! thanks for the great recipe!

My family decided to make this dish for mother's day, it was exactly what we were looking for. We added green onions into the butter mix to better suit our palette. We had a lot of trouble folding in the edges of the chicken (even after repeated attempts at further flattening the chicken). I would recommend making a pocket in the chicken to stuff the butter in, rather than the sizable amount of toothpicks we had to use to keep the chicken rolled up.

Followed the instructions but even after 4 hours my butter did not freeze up. The coating was very tasty and you definitely would need to cook it longer the instructions say.  I think next time i will put it in the oven to make it juicier.  for the most part it was flavorful but i expected more from it.  Basically its just another way to fry a chicken cutlet.

Great recipe. This is the first recipe I tried from this site and my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about it. He's a very picky eater with a crazy stomach but i cook a lot being young and from culinary school and although i had problems with the toothpicks. This is a keeper!

This is the best chicken I have had in a long time. My daughter loved it and so did my Hubby, and he's not a real chicken fan. The only thing I altered was I didnt rolled the butter into the chicken breast. I simply took the chicken breast, cut it into thin slices dipped it in the flour-egg-bread crumb mixture and fried them in butter. It was delicious!!

This is so delicious!  I used thighs as that's what I had on hand.  I followed the directions completely, just increased the amount of the spices called for.  I know some people said it was a lot of work to make this, but really, it was so easy and didn't take that much time to prep. everything.
I chose to bake these on a rack in a baking pan in my Breville convection  Toaster oven, preheated to 350F for 45 minutes.  The results were these perfectly browned, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside little bundles of deliciousness.
Oh!  I almost forgot...I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs because I only had the Italian kind in my pantry.    I think, it made them better because I don't know if the bread crumbs would have been as crispy.
I served it with the Ukrainian Salat Vinaigrette (Beet Salad) from this site, peas, and mashed potatoes (leftover from last night)
It was a great meal that I will be making again for sure!

First time I have ever made this and it was delicious.  Even my picky kids loved it.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was quite hard getting the chicken thin enough without tearing it (gonna try a different method next time). I added onion powder to the butter mix and a few different spices to the flour mix(to our liking) and used Panko breading(made it so super crunchy!!).  I will be making this again.
