I was looking for a great crust recipe for mini tart crusts and this is it! A few additional suggestions for this recipe: Getting tarts out of a tart pan can be frustrating. I even made this great crust in mini tart pans which are expecially a problem.  Be sure to spray your pans with a non stick cooking spray. Otherwise, you will not be able to remove the tarts without breaking. Also, I always put my crusts in the freezer for about five minutes, right before baking.  This allows the butter to get cold and then the hot burst from the oven makes the crust puff much better so the crust is not crackly.

This dessert was delicious! I started by making the tart shell, but the consistency was too crumbly, so I added an extra 2 tablespoons of butter and another 1/8 cup of sugar, and it came together quite well. I used my hands to combine the dough, and the warmth of my hands made it very easy to work with. I also stuck the cupcake pan with the dough in the freezer for 5 minutes (as another person suggested), then added the almond mixture on top. I followed the recipe exactly for the rest of it, and the finished product was amazing! Can't wait to impress my guests tomorrow night!

These are very tasty and not difficult to make. I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception: my almonds were sliced rather than slivered. To avoid problems removing the tarts from the pan, run a butter knife around each one after removing from the oven. After the recommended cooling time they pop right out. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

pretty good, but not the AMAZING dessert I was hoping for. Maybe more almond flavour would have been nice, like some almond extract. The crust was a nice shortbread crust, which everyone likes. I would give it a  4 1/2 stars just because its really good, but not perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy and adorable!  The dough was a little crumbly to put in the muffin tins, but stayed together once baked, no problem. I didn't have trouble getting them out of the muffin tins.  Just coaxed out with the tip of a knife. I thought maybe they could have used a bit more filling so next time I might make 1.5 times the filling and see how that works.  I will make again for sure!

They were okay, but won't make them again. The family didn't let them go to waste. I did double the filling because for some reason I ran out half way threw.

OMG absolutely DIVINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Would only recommend doubling the pastry mixture and making half as much again of the filling.  Also silicon cases are definately the way to go with these if you want to be able to remove them easily without breaking.  Gorgeous - an absolute must

Very easy to make, coming from a person who cannot make any type of crust without ruining it.  Kids love it.  Made these as a treat for my daughters friend from college who is from Sweden.  She requests these each time they come to visit!

Love it. Definitely doesn't make enough. I usually 1/2 again the filling. Have used slivered and sliced almonds - both equally good. Even better to add a bit of almond extract. Also, add maybe a teaspoon or so of water to the dough until it forms a ball. Easier to work with and doesn't seem to change the texture.

Really delicious and easy to make. Like another reviewer, I ran out of the fillings and had to make more. Still, I will definitely make again.

I had gotten some mini tart pans from Pampered Chef so I wanted to try them on a simple recipe and this is what I found. It divides pretty nicely into six mini tart pans, though I remember needing to make some more of the filling (I made it last year and am about to remake it for the first time). I also added a few drops of almond extract to the dough, which was a really good idea, though it may make it too overwhelmingly almond for some. I made it for my parents and brother previously, and everyone loved it. I'm hoping to make them again and again.

These are so good! I had to double the amount of the filling, though, for some reason. I baked them in a silicone muffin pan that I didn't even have to grease prior to baking. Afterwards, I let them cool off completely and they just popped out without any mess.

Yes, the filling needs to be doubled. Even then, I just made it for the 12 . And yes, a little more butter for the crust
