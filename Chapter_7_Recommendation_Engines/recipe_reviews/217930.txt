I just wanted add a note to my recipe.  Two important steps were changed when the recipe was published so I want to clear that up.  I brown the chicken in the skillet, cover with foil and finish it in the oven so I have time to caramelize the onions.  I don't fully caramelize them as that would take a while to do, but I cook them for a lot longer than "soft and translucent" to get more flavor from them.  They should be pretty mushy.  We also like the dish a bit more garlic-y now, so I add a good bit of garlic powder to the cream sauce as it is thickening.  Thanks for trying this recipe!  I hope this info is helpful :)

Meghann, this was really good.  I did follow your directions on putting the chicken into the oven after browning (I used a combo of butter and olive oil) while finishing the onions.  When I fixed the onions, I added the garlic too soon, so use caution because you do not want burned garlic.  I used a little more butter for the onions, too, to help with the caramelizing.  I was lucky to be making this dish when Vidalias are in season--they are so good.  When I went to make the sauce, it just called out to me to add something, so I used a little garlic powder and a few sprinkles of tarragon.  I made the sauce a little more in bulk for the meal we were having so that I could pour some over some capellini.  Yum!  We have some leftovers for another night!  Thanks, Meghann!

My husband loved this! He raved about it several times after dinner was over. Of course he loves all creamy sauces. I used fat-free half and half to cut down on the calories. I will make this again.

This was delicious! I made the sauce with half and half and it came out nice and creamy and wonderful. When the sauce was completed, I mixed 2/3 of a pound of brown rice pasta into it and then served the chicken breast sliced on top. It was soooo good!! I also added some minced fresh parsley that I wanted to use up. That added even more flavor! Will definitely make this again!

This was great! I had to add a little more flour to get it to thicken up, but I think I added too much liquid, so that was my fault. I will be making this again!

It also depends on the wine. I used a really nice moscato. I think what wine you use affects the final flavour a lot.
