I have used this SIMPLE recipe many times and it always works. Used it for a large dinner - served 400+ - received rave reviews.  Like it particularly because it's not BBQ brisket.

This recipe is probably pretty good, but I messed it up by buying a pre-packaged brisket that (I think) was already seasoned.  The brisket that I made was way too salty for my taste although my husband and mother liked it (they both love salt and have the high blood pressure to prove it).  So my only comment is to make sure you don't use a pre-packaged cut of meat.  I will try it again and I'm sure I'll get better results.
