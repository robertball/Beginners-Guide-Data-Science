When I made this I added a package of fat free cream cheese to with Fat Free cool whip and it thickened it and made it taste so much better. I used frozen fuit, raspberries and blueberries for the 4th and sprinkled coconuton top and it turned out great. Everyone at the party loved it. Freeze it for like a half an hour before serving and it is better.

Excellent!  I used a 9x13 cake pan for the crust (I was taking it out of the house and wanted an easy way to transport it) which used the entire tube of cookie dough.  I also added about 5 oz. of low fat cream cheese to the low fat cool whip mixture.  Then used cut up strawberries, blackberries, bananas (with pineapple juice mixed with them to keep them from browning) and pineapple pieces.  Next time I will cut the pieces of the pizza before adding the fruit, because when I cut the pizza after adding the pieces fruit, it got all messed up and didn't look as pretty.  This was really wonderful - thanks for the recipe.

Make sure to spread the dough fairly thin - I left mine kind of thick and it took a really long time to cook! (but was still delicious)

The cookie "crust" is very chewy and the cream cheese "sauce" was a great touch.  I didn't use all the sauce though.  I used mango, banana, blueberries and apples for the toppings.  Very simple and a good way to get your kids to eat fruit.

this is a family fav. with some changes: we use cream cheese, marshmellow fluff, little conf sugar instead of whipped topping. *squirt lime juice on banana slices to slow browning. Usually use lime zest also. Thanks for the starting point!!

Lovely simple recipe.  Instead of whipped cream,  I use fat free cream cheese, 2/3 pkg, and fat free/sugar free vanilla yogurt, about 1 cup.  Just tangy enough to compliment the sugar cookie dough.  I also sprinkled brown sugar around the "crust" while baking, and would flatten down the middle while it was baking so it didn't get too big.

This was so delicious and easy. I mixed together 4oz cream cheese and 4oz of whipped topping for the sauce. I also cut it into pieces before adding the fruit. I did not use pineapples. Fabulous recipe!

We served this at 4th of July and had to make 2 (one for the kids and one for the adults).  It was the 1st dish to go at both tables!  If you are using an open pan (no sides), I recommend putting a dish on the bottom rack to catch any excess dough.  I know cookie dough spreads, but this was the 1st time I had make a large cookie and was not prepared for it to spread as much as it did.  No worries though, it still turned out beautiful and delicious!

A light, not-too-sweet, but satisfying dessert! My only issue was that I had trouble getting the cookie off the pan, not sure how to fix that problem. The coolwhip definately needs creamcheese mixed in OR use a thin layer of creamcheese or vanilla icing.   Some people said the cookie got soggy, but mine didn't because I used a thin layer of creamcheese icing (instead of coolwhip).  Just keep it refrigerated and it'll be fine :)

Was yummy, i put strawberries, blueberries and kiwi on the top.  The only downside is it needs to be eaten quickly because it gets soggy and is not good the next day!  Delicious and easy though!

Really simple, fun, and delicious!  After reading the reviews, I decided it would be best to slice the pieces before putting the fruit on top but after adding the whipped cream/cream cheese mixture.  Because I didn't want my bananas or apples to brown, I decided to have fun and make it a decorating contest.  Everyone decorated their own slice, and it was really fun and tasty.  I'll definitely do it again.

So good! I used a tub of Cool Whip mixed with 8 oz cream cheese for the spread. Topped that with kiwi, frozen strawberries, bananas, and grapes. Delicious!

This was great!  I made it just as the recipe suggested with strawberries, blueberries & crushed pineapple.  Everyone raved about it & I will definitely make this one again.  The variations you can make with different fruits are huge.  I would stick with the cool whip as the base.  I think some of the suggestions of using fluff would make it too sweet and take away from the natural sweetness of the fruit.

My husband and I loved this!! I did change up a few things. I used chocolate chip cookie dough because I prefer the taste. I baked it in a 9 x13 pan because I didn't have a pizza pan. Also, I added 4 oz. of cream cheese and a little bit of sugar to the whipped cream. I topped it with strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and banana. It was delicious!

This was a huge hit at our gathering!  I made the sauce with cream cheese and marshmellow creme.  Added strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and kiwi.  I refrigerated the cookie crust with topping for an hr. before I put the fruit on.  Then I froze it for an hr. before transporting to the party.  Everyone loved it!

Delicious!
What's so great about this recipe is you can use any variety of fruit- I used kiwi, strawberries, grapes and pineapple. As recommended by other reviewers for the "sauce" I used half whipped topping, half cream cheese. Turned out GREAT

Easy to make and modify to your taste.  I added blueberries and drizzled caramel sauce over the top of it.  Made a great valentine's day treat for my guy :)

This is my favorite dessert and I am so glad I found the recipe on this website!  As another user said, it is difficult to cut up  after frosting and placing the fruit pieces in a beautiful pattern.  I suggest frosting (with whip and cream cheese mix), then cutting, and adding a selection of smaller fruit pieces to each "cookie".  Decorating each piece at a time is a great way to involve the kids too!

My oldest son (a teenager) wolfed it down. My picky-er eaters were more reticent about it and my husband just thought it was OK. I highly recommend for teenagers and Moms.

I used this recipe to create a dessert pizza for my son's class at school to share. It was a big hit! We also mixed in cream cheese with the whipped cream to make the "pizza sauce." Because of foood allergies, we had to omit strawberries, but used pineapple, mandarin oranges, grapes, bananas and blueberries to top our pizza and my son loved helping to create our masterpiece!

Oh my goodness! My family loved this pizza. I'm no artist, but it looked so good that everyone was taking pictures of it. LOL  I used strawberries, kiwis, canned peaches (because I wanted the slices to look perfect), and one banana cut into fourths in the center.  I would gladly give it 10 stars if I could.

Winter Version!!!  Put the crust on an actual pizza stone and when it is still warm add the "sauce", (I prefer the cream cheese/whipped cream version), then add apple pie filling on top...tastes even better in front of a fire!

This recipe was quick and easy, exactly what I needed with a toddler running around.  My co-workers completely devoured this within 5 minutes flat and it got rave reviews.  Will definitely be trying this again and adding more fruit as the seasons are changing.

This Dessert Pizza was a HUGE hit!  I've taken others' suggestions and used 4 oz. of fat free cool whip and about 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese.  I also cut the cookie crust into slices and strategically placed the strawberries, kiwi, and berries so that when a slice was taken, the presentation was well kept.  As my son says, "It's not an option to not make this again!"  Delicious!

great recipe. Will make it again and again. I mixed cream cheese with whipped topping and it was great. Next time I will add a bit of raspberry preserves to the cream cheese & whipped topping to create a soft pink color and a tangy sweet taste. Everyone loved this dessert!

Everyone loved this dessert and it was so easy to make! I made vanilla pudding and mixed it in with the frozen whipped topping and it came out great (I imagine any kind of pudding would be good). I topped it with kiwi, mandarin oranges, strawberries and blueberries. Fantastic!

This was really good, I made my own sugar cookie dough (had enough left over to freeze and make 3 more) I used a glass pie plate, 1/2 block of cream cheese, 1/8 cup sugar and 1/2 tub dream whip.   I topped it with drained mandarin oranges and chopped up pieces of honeydue melon.   YUMMY

I had to substitute a few items but the recipe was a hit for the mini cook out.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I had to use pie crust instead of sugar cookie though (my local grocer didn't carry the dough mix).

I loved this recipe. The second time I did it I made a different "sauce." Try 1 part cream cheese and 1 part marshmellow fluff. It is a fruit dip my mother used to make a lot and it was SO GOOD on this "pizza!"

Awesome!!! I added cream cheese to the whipped topping as suggested by others and used pineapple, raspberries, strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, grapes, and boysenberries. I had to cook the cookie dough much longer than 20 minutes though, maybe it was my oven?? Definitely worth the wait :) Everyone ate this up. Will DEFINITELY make again!! Thanks Michele!

Delicious, super simple, and a guaranteed crowd pleaser.  I was making it for 6 so I used 1/2 roll sugar cookie dough pressed into a 9 in cake pan.  Try to make it even and leave a rim for the dough to expand.  For the topping, I really wanted to avoid cream cheese yet wanted something more substantial so I used 1/2 c lowfat vanilla yogurt and whipped in 2 heaping spoonfuls of lite whipped topping until smooth.  This was airy and creamy without being too sweet.  I frosted the cookie and refrigerated overnight and the topping set up really well. I wouldn't put the fruit more than 4 hours before serving bc it can get soggy.  I have requests to make this for future birthday parties now!

Just made this with the kids.  We made and decorated individual cookies.  We used 8 oz. whipped topping with 6 oz. whipped cream cheese + 1 tsp sugar for the frosting...good consistency and great flavor.  Topped with thin sliced fresh peaches, strawberries, kiwi, blueberries.  Will make this again soon, especially because it's a recipe that's easy and fun for the kids to help with.

WOW - Amazing!  Had to pull together a quick dessert and found this one.  Didn't have a pizza pan, so I used the largest baking dish I had.  I used everyone else's suggestion of mixing fat free whipped topping with fat free cream cheese and it worked beautifully.  Fresh berries are really expensive right now, so I bought frozen pre-cut smoothie fruit pieces, thawed them, and just scattered them over the top of the "sauce".  Omitted the bananas because they turned gooey when thawed.  Sprinkled sweetened coconut shavings over the top and then drizzled with chocolate and caramel syrup.  HUGE hit at the Father's Day BBQ!!

I used this recipe for a party and people loved it!
I used 5 oz. of soft cream cheese with the 8 oz. of lite whipped cream. I did not have an electric mixer so I had to mix it with a whisk. Even though I used soft cream cheese, it was hard to get the chunks out. I would recommend leaving the cream cheese out and letting it get to room temperature. 
Also, to make it more party friendly, I made sugar cookies and then decorated each cookie separately. It made it much easier to pick up.

This was Awesome I only used strawberries because that's all I had my husband wasn't to keen on it but everyone else LOVED IT!!!!all you do is take one of those chocolate chip cookie dough roll thing, roll it out flatten as thin as you can bake it then take and put in freezer for a little bit cool down but not all the way then you take package of cream cheese and 8oz, cool whip mix together than spread over cookie after; first cut cookie into pieces will make it easier to work with, than cut strawberries up then bananas add a little lemon juice on bananas to avoid turning brown , the combination of the chocolate, cream cheese, strawberries and bananas puts your taste buds on a frigin journey as Ashley  my son's girlfriend says ,,,

Made it with a 16oz package of sugar cookie dough for the crust and used a glass pie dish. When it was done cooking, I pushed the dough back down, added the fat free whipped topping & cream cheese mix for the filling, and added the fruit on top. IT WAS A HUGE HIT with the guests and even their 2 year old loved it!

I love this. I use the cream cheese and whip cream with sugar blend as noted in other recipes but this cookie dough crust is the best!!!

I let the kids make this-using an egg slicer for most of the fruit and it comes out looking like art everytime. Simple, kid friendly, and tasty, what more could you ask for?

Simplicity and perfection. There has not been a party we have gone to where this desert was not the first to be scarfed up, with rave comments. There is a reason the recipe is for two of them. It seems wherever you go, or even at home, you always want more of this dessert.
