A little info on mangoes: For North Americans, probably the closest similar fruit (but NOT close in flavor) is the peach. A ripe mango should have about the same consistency as a ripe peach. And a green mango feels about the same as a green peach. You can ripen green mangoes in a closed brown paper bag in 2-4 days. If you try to cook this dish with green mangoes, you will not get any juice (or flavor), just as if you tried cooking a pie, or some other dish, with green peaches.  Use only ripe mangoes to cook this dish.

It's true the mace and pecans are not necessary for the main flavor of the dish.  They are added for the pleasure of those whose palates enjoy more complex flavors and textures.  It is perfectly fine to leave these out if you so wish.

This was really tasty.  I felt the pecans werent truly necessary, nor the mace seasoning, but it was delicious.  I really enjoyed it!

Was good, even with frozen mango instead of fresh. The sauce is on the sweet side but complemented the chicken well that was seasoned with course black pepper. I served it with saffron-caraway basmati rice Yum!

Oops, forgot the pecans (darn it, I had them, too).  I did add a little bit of sliced red bell pepper and used red onion to give this a little color and make it more eye appealing.  This was good, but I think it would have been better had the chicken been marinated, giving it more flavor.  The mango topping was good, and really is the star of this recipe, because the chicken simply doesnâ€™t have much flavor.  Made the mango topping early in the day, warmed it up in the micro, and grilled the chicken breasts.  Good, but I think it could be better.

I made this dish exactly to the recipe .  It was excellent.  Enough mango sauce for 2 more servings as there was only 2 servings cooked today.

Provided sweet balance off a blackened chicken that we prepared.  Easy to make... just have to prepare more the next time as we ran out of the sauce before all the chicken was consumed!  Will prepare again.

It could very well be my stupidity, but where was the "sauce" supposed to come from?  Was the mango supposed to be super juicy?  I followed the directions & there wasn't ANY sauce, it was just cubed mango with onion.
