We love cabbage and curry but this was lacking something for our taste buds. Added a granny smith apple  peeled and sliced and omitted the tomato.  This seemed to be what it needed so perhaps others might light to try this adjustment.

This was exactly what I was craving tonight- something fresh with alot of veggies, spicy, and sweet. I followed the recipe, and served it with grilled chicken spiced with garam masala and white rice. With the fresh cilantro, green onions and tomatoes on top of everything, it was so colorful and a delight to eat.

I thought this needed more curry flavor. I added fresh ginger, cumin and more garlic. I simmered the veggies and coconut mixture longer to let the curry flavor come out, about 10 min. I made a yogurt sauce to top the dish and it was great.

So delicious! I added green peppers, celery, cauliflower, and russet potato to give it a serious veggie makeover and added an entire can of coconut milk. Served over quinoa. Delicious vegan yumminess!

This kind of "grows" on you!  At first, I wasn't sure if I liked it.  Then, I knew I did!  To make this, I bought a whole coconut, and made my own coconut milk and chopped coconut!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and I actually toned down the amount of curry so the kids would eat it and they did.  Very yummy way to incorporate cabbage into the menu.

Not great at first. I added crystallized ginger and lemon juice and it was ok. I mixed it with some aloo gobi and it was FANTASTIC. Needs some futzing, but we will make it when we make aloo gobi because they are fantastic together.

My husband loves all things curry and doesn't really like cabbage.  Well, he loved it in this recipe!  I didn't add in the tomato, green onions, or cilantro since I didn't have any on hand.  I added some cooked shrimp to this and served it over rice for a filling and easy meal.

This recipe was missing something, not as good as other coconut curries i have made, but it was not horrible just a little blander than i am used to.

Wasn't a fan right after I made it, but MUCH BETTER cold the next day. I would make it again and serve it as a cold side dish. I would cut the curry also to 1/2 tablespoon.

Very easy recipe. I added more spices to give it more depth of flavor- Garlic, cumin, paprika, etc. Also didn't have carrots so I used frozen peas instead. I think we actually liked it better that way. Thanks!

Needed more coconut milk in my opinion, loved it though! Yum with brown rice/millet mixture on the side.

We all enjoyed this curry. I was looking for something different to go with rice and Kahlua pork and it went well. I did leave out the cilantro as a favor to my son, but I'm sure it would taste great. I'm pleased to find a new cabbage dish; thanks!!

Loved this! I used what I had on hand which meant no shredded coconut and no fresh tomatoes, but it was delicious anyway. After tasting, I added a sprinkle of cumin and coriander, and stirred in some chili paste & a tiny bit of salsa for heat, as we love strong flavors. So good!

Cooked until most of the liquid was gone.  We like fried cabbage well cooked and I had a head of napa from mom's garden. I made very few changes:  used unsweetened dried coconut instead of fresh (you can find that at Indian groceries) and no cilantro (my husband is not a fan), but it would have worked well here.  Served as a side dish to grilled t-bones.  I am thinking that if you added chicken this would make a fine meal.

I did not follow it exactly, but it was a perfect base to use up a bunch of veggies in my frig. Used Napa cabbage, red cabbage, Bok Choy, some peppers and onions. Came out great and my vegetarian husband ate 3 helpings.

This was a home run! I added about 1 1/2 cups of fresh crab to it. Will make this again! Next time maybe with some chicken.

I liked it better after it had sit in the refrigerator overnight to soak up the flavors.  I also thought it was good cold.

I substituted olive oil for the ghee (clarified butter) for health reasons.

My husband and I loved this recipe BUT I must admit we love INTENSE food. I used 4 cloves of garlic and 1/4 c habanero salsa. I also added 1 c julienned celery and deglazed the pan near the end with 1/4 c dry white wine. We served it with haddock in a lemon-cream sauce. GREAT easy, healthy supper. Thank you, Sonia!

Delicious!  I made some slight adjustments: I used 2 tablespoons Indian curry powder and 1 tablespoon regular curry powder (regular curry powder has less heat than Indian curry powder), I put the tomato into the dish when I added the coconut milk, I used 1 can of coconut milk, and I doubled the garlic.  My husband is South African and is therefore the curry expert in my house.  He thought the recipe was fantastic (but said he would have used 3 tablespoons Indian curry powder).  This recipe will be a staple in our house!

I loved this recipe it was so easy to do and delicious! I omited the carrots as Im not a fan and added tofu as the protein as it is healthy and inexpenxsive :) I found the green onions a little overpowering as a garnish but worked much better when I reheated left overs so I would add them earlier next time so they can cook a little. But it was really yummy and I might try adding the hot peppers next time for extra kick :)

Great taste!  I added mini corn and thai noodles and it was a more fulfilling side dish.  It was very easy and quick to make.  Would even be great by itself for a light meal.
