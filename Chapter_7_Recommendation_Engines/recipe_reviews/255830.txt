LOVED LOVED LOVED this! The one change I did make is that after making as written it was weak on the black bean side. The flavor was there due to the blended can but the end bean/bell pepper/tomato ratio was way off in my opinion. There were only a few black bean left floating in the soup. Plan on an extra can OR two. With that being said, the flavor is GREAT! Save some bacon or make extra for topping.

I love trying new recipes for company and this was no exception.  The school my children attend have an International Potluck Dinner.  The senior class picked Guatemala and I made this recipe for over 100 people to sample.  It was absolutely amazing.  My husband keeps asking for it ever since.
