I think this turned out excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly!  Only thing is I think it's better when it's first made.. If you eat it after chilled I would add some more salad dressing and some salt an pepper as it tends to get dry and bland after it sits...  Would be great as a meal with some chicken cut up in there!

I used a fresh pineapple that I had on hand, and frozen peas instead of canned peas.  One change that I made was cutting back on the number of hard-boiled eggs, concerned that the eggs would just take over the salad.  This was a superb side dish to Kalula Pork (slow cooker) and such a nice break from the same-ole macaroni salad.  Love the sweetness from the pineapple and the crunch from the apple.  I also love that this can be made early in the day for a no-fuss dinner on a hot summer day.  Thanks, Alicia, we enjoyed this new macaroni salad.
