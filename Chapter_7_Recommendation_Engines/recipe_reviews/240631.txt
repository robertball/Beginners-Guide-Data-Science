This is Giada De Laurentis' recipe with an addition of tomatoes.  I have made Giada's version many times and it is always good, so I suspect that this is very good as well.  I usually leave out the lemon zest, use a cut up whole chicken and don't bother with the parsley.  For those that question amounts, the mustard should be 1/4 cup and the balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup, olive oil 1/2 cup and 1/4 lemon juice (hopefully the juice of one lemon).  Gilda's recipe calls for 3 cloves of garlic which I think make it very tasty.

I marinated the chicken for 4 hours, however next time I'd probably prepare it in the morning and let the breasts marinate all day.  Instead of marinating in a dish, I find it much easier to marinate in a ziploc bag (with air squeezed out) so that the chicken is evenly coated and you don't need to keep flipping the chicken.  Do not omit the lemon! The tartness perfectly balances out the sweetness of the balsamic. Without the lemon, I found the chicken too sweet. My second bite had lemon on it and it was much better.  Most importantly, 40 mins is much too long for chicken breasts at 400*F.  I cooked the chicken for 20 mins, added the tomatoes, and cooked for 10 more.  I might even cut back 2-3 more minutes next time, for a total of 27-28mins. A simple dish to prepare on those busy weeknights. Just pop in the oven when you get home from work. With a few tweaks, this could definitely be 5 star.  I thought it was 3.5-4 stars but my boyfriend did not like it and asked me not to make it again.

AgaIn - if you need to tweak and alter so much why don't you list your own recipe.  
After reading so many reviews - all of which add alter and change so many things I wonder ...
If you're like me and are just looking for something different and a pretty decent recipe to start with. Just follow the suggested recipe.  It's very good.

I've been making this for over a year now - I increase the mustard, leave out the zest and swap out the tomatoes for a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and I mix the can (with juice) into the marinade. This cuts most of the acidity of the balsamic while

Sounds delicious.  Do you remove the chicken from the marinade to bake, or bake it in the marinade?

My date and I made this recently and absolutely loved it! I love anything balsamic and he had never really had it before so I took a chance at this recipe to sway him over to balsamic. He thought it was so good he insisted we make it again sometime! Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.

I really enjoyed this dish.  Very easy and healthy. I used lemon balsamic vinegar and skipped the zest.  I also paired it with the recipe for "slow roasted tomatoes with feta, olives and pine nuts" from allrecipes instead of adding tomatoes directly to the chicken.  I marinated and then cooked the chicken on the grill.

I just made this recipe for Father’s Day.  The only thing extra I added was more fresh garlic (4 cloves) Herbs de Provence and basil.  I served it with Pesto Pasta mixed with fresh broccoli.   Also when I marinated the chicken I cut it in strips so it would soak into the chicken better.  I cut back on the cooking time 5 minutes because of that.
Next time I will add toasted pine nuts and fresh basil.  My husband and I both loved it.  Best new recipe I’ve tried in a while.  Absolutely delicious.

I've made this a couple of times now; it makes for a great weeknight meal!  I marinate the chicken breasts in the refrigerator for the duration of the day, and begin preheating the oven the moment I walk in the door.  Simple and tasty!

Whole family loved this including picky 16 yr old.  I sliced up 2 breasts into 8 pieces.  Cooked 10 minutes with foil, then 10 uncovered.  Then I  sprinkled goat cheese over all and let it sit for 10 minutes out of oven with foil on.  I really enjoyed the tomatoes too and cooked just enough for me as rest of family doesn't like them.  Chicken was very moist since cooked in the marinade.  I also halved the marinade ingredients and didn't use any lemon.  This is full of flavor!

I reduced the recipe to half because I only used 2 breasts.

Like other reviewers, I felt the vinegar was a bit overpowering.  However, I think the flavor would have been better had I used the full amount of garlic and mustard!

I also reduced the cooking time to 16 minutes only before adding the tomatoes for an additional 10 minutes and they were certainly done by then.  I did cut the breasts (they were big breasts) into 3 pieces so they would cook quicker (also since I have 2 kids and they wouldn't be eating the whole breast for themselves anyway).

Even with half of the ingredients (1/4 cup of vinegar), there was still a lot of marinade left over to use it on other things.

My husband is a very picky eater and he even mentioned it was good!

I will definitely make it again but with more garlic and mustard!

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I did double the marinade so that we would have enough for the rice. I cooked Basmati rice, as I did not have any brown rice.  The addition of the cherry tomatoes did not really add much to the dish and the skin of the tomatoes were tough.  Other than that, it was very good.  I also used boneless, skinless thighs rather than chicken breasts.  I made enough for left overs and I did remove the tomatoes and if I make this again, I will not use cherry tomatoes.  I am too lazy to skin a pint of cherry tomatoes.  An enjoyable change to the routine chicken recipes.

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was really good.  Be sure to use a high grade balsamic or the flavored eon't be as rich.  I used the measurements of another reviewer and had way too much sauce.  I did the tomatoes and will add a bit of feta to it next time.  Am making it again tomorrow night serving it with brown rice with some vegetable flavored Better than Bullion (yummy) and asparagus.

Loved this recipe, was enough liquid to pour over rice.  Just had the leftovers and there even better than the day before.  Add lots of garlic! And I did lower the cooking time by ten minutes as another reviewer suggested. Took out of the oven covered pan with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes.

I liked the flavors in this dish and especially the roasted cherry tomatos.  I prepared it as directed and served it with angel hair pasta with alfredo sauce and some fresh snipped basil on top.  Yummy.

My new go-to summer recipe.  I love grilled chicken, and this has a fantastic slightly-charred taste when grilled.  It's not nearly as good when baked.  

It's also a great way to get rid of the huge amount of cherry tomatoes we get from the garden.

I marinated the chicken in a freezer bag all day.  I made it for 2, and used 2 large cloves of garlic in the mix.  Beautiful presentation with the cherry tomatoes - a great company recipe.  I also sliced the breasts at an angle before serving.  I didn't use all the lemon juice mixed with zest ... just drizzled it over the chicken.  I was afraid it would be too lemony.  Soooooo delicious!!

This was very tasty!  For those that don't like balsamic vinegar you will NOT like this recipe.  That seems obvious but felt it should be stated based on the reviews.  I don't typically like cooked tomatoes but adding these at the end allowed them to keep their pop.  Will be making again, thanks for taking the time to post.

I thought it was really good. I added 4 cloves of garlic, a pinch of red pepper and also a teaspoon of pre made pesto and marinated overnight. I cooked it covered in all of the marinade for the first 25 mins and then turned the chicken over, added the tomatoes and cooked for an additional 10. I think the chicken was slightly dry but I think it's a personal preference. My boyfriend likes when the chicken is dry...he somehow thinks juicy chicken means it is raw and it grosses him out. I served over brown rice and roasted zucchini. I think the fresh lemon is important to cut the sweetness from the balsamic. Also, I would invest in a good balsamic for this which I suspect could be why some reviewers didn't like it.

We all loved this recipe.  Had balsamic vinegar and olive oil from Italy after my visit there.  Would not change anything.  Quality of Basamic made it special.

I will make again and didn't make any changes this time.  It did look like an herb was added that was not in recipe but it was also obvious that it was just a flat leaf parsley garnish to finish. Cooking should be fun and every recipe can be adjusted to your preferences so just have fun and color out of the box a little.

Super easy dish. I was out of dijon and swapped in spicy ground mustard, but no other changes, other than adding a thin slice of lemon atop each piece of chicken because it made it look prettier. Based on the smell from the oven, I thought it would be strong, but the flavor is actually quite mild. My husband asked me to make it again and the kids ate it without complaint, so I'll be adding it to the rotation.

I loved this and it was incredibly easy, I let the chicken marinate overnight and cooked it the next evening, I might try adding some sprigs of rosemary next time and I don't really know why it just seems like a good idea.

This was fabulous. The only change I made was I added fresh herbs to the sauce since my garden is over flowing. Then I sliced the chicken breasts diagonally and laid them in the sauce and marinated it for about 4 hours. Followed the rest of the recipe as written and it came out so good. Served it with brown rice and a kale salad. Thank you for sharing??

Made this almost the same as per the original recipe. As others have done, I used 4 garlic cloves, cooked for 20min, added halved cherry tomatoes & juice from a third of a lemon, then put back in for 10min. Large chicken breasts but we're cooked to perfection. 

I that I needed a bit of salt to balance the sweetness of the balsamic, so I added kalamata olives (halved) into the original marinade (adjust to taste)

Simple recipe, healthy and a lot of flavour. Serve on top of pasta, rice or even baby spinach. Next time I'm going to break up a little bit of creamy goat goat cheese over the top when serving.

I made this today and it was delicious! The chicken marinated overnight. The only thing I did differently was add some sliced tomatoes and slabs of mozzarella and basil on top of the chicken during the last 10-15 minutes. I was a little concerned that the balsamic would burn  while baking, but it actually turned out really good (just the stuff along the sides of the dish burned a bit). I put the chicken over some penne pasta and drizzled the sauce all over it, very good! I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first time using balsamic vinegar.  It's my new favorite ingredient after making this recipe!! My husband really liked it too and he's not a fan of mustards or vinegars, or so he thought. Ha!  He ate his chicken over brown rice and asparagus and I had mine over shredded lettuce and raw zucchini with a little (clean) ranch dressing.  Flavors were definitely there!! Followed recipe and will make again!

I was a bit hesitant about this recipe, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise for us last night!  I did make a number of changes to the ingredients and the process, but I think my version was very similar to the submitter’s recipe.  I made basically half the recipe.  For the marinade, I used ¼ cup balsamic vinegar, ½ T. EVOO, 2 T. Dijon, a clove of garlic and salt and pepper to taste.  After combining the marinade, I tasted it and I thought it was too tart for us, so I added 2 T. of honey, which helped mellow out the acidity of the vinegar. I marinated two skinless boneless chicken breasts halves in half of the marinade for about eight hours.  I had Hubs grill this instead of roasting it in the oven, and while he was grilling, I heated the other half of the marinade along with the tomatoes and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  When the chicken came off the grill, I topped it with the tomatoes and sauce, and sprinkled on some julienned fresh basil instead of using the lemon juice and zest.  It was delicious!  Next time I may cut back on the honey just a bit, maybe to 1½ T, rather than two, and I’d like to sprinkle on toasted pine nuts for a little crunch!  We’ll do this one again!

Only change was cooking time.  Twenty minutes then added tomatoes and baked for an additional 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  Enjoyed by all.  Recipe is a keeper and lemon juice and zest are a nice touch.

This was great!  Cooking it in the marinade it had been sitting in worried me a bit, so I actually drained the chicken, put it in the oven and boiled the marinade for a few minutes before adding it back to the baking dish.  Probably not necessary but that's just me.  We loved the end result with no other changes to the original recipe. ??

Cooking at suggested temp and time dried out the chicken.  Too strong of a vinegar taste for our liking.  An OK quick, easy meal served with rice.  Probably won't make it again though.

This made a delicious company lunch. I served it over a bed of arugula on a platter with crusty bread and butter on the side.

Turned out great,  I followed someone else's review on adjusting the proportion of  ingredients.   So not sure if it would have turned out as well. I didn't add tomatoes because I didn't have any.

we love making this super simple and easy recipe. Sometimes I double the amount of the ingredients but keep the same amount of chicken. And I have also used just chicken tenders instead of the chicken breasts cut in half. Comes out perfectly every time. I added heirloom cherry tomatoes and they turned out absolutely divine! I only use half of the lemon instead of whole because if I use whole it makes it way too tart. 
I have made this with simple roasted potatoes, green beans as  sides and even used Zatarans Jambalaya rice pack (occasionally) . Pairs great and is a win win for a busy mom like me

Loved this dish and so did my husband. Made it pretty much as described, just didn't add the salt and omitted lemon zest but did squeeze a bit of lemon juice on just before eating.

I marinated the chicken for about 7 hours which allowed the marinade to really penetrate the chicken.  My husband (the Meat Eater) and I both enjoyed this dish but it seemed to be lacking something.  I will make it again but probably experiment with adding some fresh or dried herbs such as rosemary or basil.

I had the chicken marinating when my husband called to tell 3 more people were coming to diner. There was not enough chicken. I made a stir fry with the chicken cut into pieces and added a bag of stir fry vegetables. I used part of the marinade to gloss but not all so it would not be soggy.  It turned out great!! It tasted fantastic. I served it with rice

This is a good one and I would definitely make again.  My picky daughter snorked it down (I ate her tomatoes).  Delicious and although it's tempting to skip the lemon (and you could) the tang against the sweetness is lovely

Muriel, balsamic vinegar is the first ingredient.  I  have made this, and (the little green herb), yes I add parsley to most of my dishes for a garnish, makes the dish very presentable.  I leave out the zest.  Have made with fire roasted and cherry tomatoes.  Great recipe, thanks for posting.

The one reviewer who called for increased ingredients, (half a cup of balsamic and quite a lot more lemon), must have very savory taste buds! Stick with the regular recipe, this chicken tastes so tart with extra lemon and balsamic  that it’s not much fun.

Delicious! I only sprinkle a few shakes of salt and pepper and that was plenty. I also marinated the chicken overnight and baked it at 375 in my convection oven rather than 400. I was perfect.  We will definitely have this again.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first go round the dish had a really good flavor but the chicken was dry and like some other reviews the vinegar was a smidge overpowering. Don't get me wrong I love balsamic... it just needed some more oomph. I increased the dijon as one reviewer recommended to 1/4 cup and viola. 30 minutes total was more than enough time to cook the second go round and the chicken was tender. Lastly I marinated the chicken overnight... do this folks and your taste buds just might dance a little.

I followed this EXACTLY. The flavor was incredible. I think this would be better with Chicken Thighs as the Breasts became tough and chewy.  The tomato skins were a nuisance  and next time (OH! There will be a next time) I will blanch them. This was NOT good leftover (We tried the next afternoon) and it  just did not have it. So for a dinner this was very good. We served this with an arugula salad and plain cooked Orzo to go with the sauce and nice warm fresh, crispy Italian Bread. I will make this again just need to adjust a few things. Otherwise, this is delicious.

Made it following the recipe, no alterations or substitutions.  We all agreed that this would be better using a pork tenderloin instead of chicken breast.  Good flavors though!

This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site.  I used very thick chicken breasts and the timing was just right.  The only thing I did differently was to add the tomatoes after fifteen minutes in order to let them cook down a bit more, which was perfect, and I added the lemon zest and juice about ten minutes before the dish was fully cooked instead of after the end.  I served them with oven roasted potatoes and green beans.  My wife and I loved this!  It's a keeper that we will make again and again.

This has been one of the best dinners I made lately.  Easy and low on the Weight Watchers point system.  I marinated overnight I had some fig balsamic dressing so I did 2/3 balsamic and 1/3 fig dressing.
I ended up roasting the tomatoes for 15 minutes vs. 10 just because they didn't look cooked enough.
I am not a leftover guy but ended up eating leftovers for lunch for a few days.

Added fresh crushed basil to marinade.  After use I strained it,  reduced it on stove then returned to pan at end of cooking.  Baked the chicken covered until adding tomatoes, served over quinoa with the liquid fm the baking.  Very time friendly, no leftovers!

Very good, very easy!  A bit too much lemon for our taste, perhaps my oversized lemon was to blame. Next time I will add the tomatoes sooner, as 10 minutes was not long enough to roast them to any degree of doneness. I served it over brown basmati rice, spooning  the balsamic “sauce” over the top. I will surely make this again.

I made it and it was actually very good.  I made it with chicken legs and it came out very well.  I did take the chicken off the bone and had it over greens.  Very good.
I will definitely make it again - when I do I will make it with the chicken breasts.

It tasted good but nothing spectacular. It did have a different taste than other dishes I make, so it was a nice change of pace. The balsamic flavor was strong.  Because it was so easy, I’ll probably make it again sometime.

This was awesome!  We used chicken thighs instead of breast, and marinated it for less time.  I love how the sweet tomatoes paired with the balsamic vinegar!! YUM!! Another addition to our chicken menu.  Absolutely loved this!

Made this for dinner tonight. The lemon was a bit overpowering,  I think I'll try half the lemon juice and zest next time and add some rosemary, sage, basil, cayenne  pepper  powder and a little sugar substitute. I served this with tumeric long grain brown rice with stir fried veggies ( onion, garlic,  green bell peppers,  celery,  carrots, dice diced tomatoes,  No Salt,  fresh ground black pepper) in sesame oil, unsalted butter, rice vinegar, low sodium soy sauce,  and eggs.

I cut the recipe down to make just 1 serving and instead of the canned tomatoes, I used grape tomatoes that I cut in half. The dish was very flavorful, with the sweet and tangy flavor from the balsamic. I will definitely make it again!

The balsamic flavor is a bit overpowering.  I tried it with some maple syrup added and that was much better.  Otherwise, It was very good and presented nicely.

I did not cared for it.  The instructions were confusing for me. I followed the recipe step by step at no time did it say take  the chicken out of marinade before putting in the oven. I baked it the marinade.  Turned out terrible I might try it again but do it right next lesson learned

I thought it was great as is.  However I do have one complaint 
I thought it was too vinegary.  Do you cook the chicken in the marinade or do you cook it without?  I think this would make a difference or maybe a better quality balsamic vinegar perhaps?

This was a great recipe.  I might add more cherry tomatoes next time, but there will definitely be a next time.

This one was not so great for me. I used chicken breast cutlets, which are thinner than regular chicken breast, and I marinated it for 4 hours. The cutlets absorbed a lot of the marinade and the taste was too overpowering for us. Also the recipe did not say to discard the marinade, so I baked the chicken still in the marinade. This recipe has potential and the pictures look great. I may have to play around with this one. Any suggestions are welcome.

so this was very simple to make,  but the balsamic was just very overpowering. i know another reviewer on here was ticked that this recipe gets tweaked, but i didn't have any lemons and i cut up regular tomatoes that i had instead of using the baby ones.  it was good it was just way too much balsamic.  not sure how to get that to be less strong. i also agree that i don't think you need 40 minutes to cook the chicken. i had 3 small pieces and i think a half hour was enough time.

Tastes great. The author is not kidding about serving with rice, you will need something to mop up all the sauce that results.

Made it without the butter and flour and it was plenty thick enough. I think it's tastey as is, but may consider additions from other reviews in a future, too.

No mention on how you use the tomatoes in the recipe. Do you cook them with the chicken or use them with the lemon zest.

The family really enjoyed this.  Due to changing circumstances, the chicken ended up marinating for about 4 days vice 4 hours...but feel it just added to the flavor.  I'm not formally a fan of tomatoes, but used orange cherries tomatoes fresh from the garden and enjoyed the flavor after they cooked in the dish/marinade.  Feel they really added to the dish.

This recipe is a keeper and I would make it for family, company, whoever.  I would add even more marinating time - throw it together and keep in the fridge that morning or night before even.  I served with green beans only and it was perfect (no big carbs for us)

Instead of marinading in a baking dish, I prefer marinating in a zip lock bag. I turned the bag over a few times while marinating.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It turned out great! I served it with a spring mix salad. Nice simple meal.

We liked it and will make again.I followed the recipe as written.  The beasts were done early so I removed them from the marinade and returned the dish to the oven. I let it cook a while longer to reduced the marinade which was essentially for my tastes . 

A also had a Bosch part that was quite ripe which I added to the marinade during the reducing period. Delicious.  

For serving, a sliced the breasts as shown in the picture and topped  with the balsamic tomato sauce. The pears were served on the side. 

Next time I may increase the marinade as I would have liked more. However as written it's a good Weight Watchers meal at only 3 points.

Not sure what happened here, since I totally followed the directions to the letter. But unlike the dozens of wonderful recipes I've found on Allrecipes, this one was barely edible.  I think it was the balsamic vinegar - just too strong a flavor.  And the acid from the lemon juice contrasted in a not-so-tasty way.  I won't be making this one again...too many long faces at the dinner table.

This is a fast and easy recipe that tastes great. I made it according to the directions, except I didn't cook it quite as long. It's a keeper.

Loved it!!  I marinated the chicken overnight and made it according to the recipe.  It was both flavorful and juicy.  I served it with homegrown purple potatoes and homegrown Bryce squash.  My husband made me promise to make it again soon!

I followed the recipe as printed, except used split breasts (bone-in, skin-on) instead of BL/SL. Cook time ran a little longer, and one of the breasts was smaller than the others, so I pulled it out first, finished the others, and returned it for the last few minutes to reheat. It went over well, served with a basmati/wild rice medley.

Delicious.  I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.  I also skipped cherry tomatoes and used the suggestion of another reviewer by putting a can of roasted tomatoes into the marinade.

Delicious and very easy with ingredients I usually have around anyway.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead and ended up marinating it overnight because our plans changed.  Also I grilled them because it's 95 degrees here today. Squeezing the lemon juice and zest on at the end gave it a refreshing flavor that balanced out the balsamic vinegar.  Definite repeat.

This recipe is fantastic! I increased the balsamic vinegar by 1/4 cup and added 4oz of sundried tomatoes and 3/4 cup sliced portobello mushrooms before baking. I also seasoned it with 1 tsp. each of oregano, parsley, basil and thyme to give it more of the Italian flair. Then I served it over pene pasta, and it was one of the tastiest, succulent chicken dishes I have ever eaten! And it’s so easy! My boyfriend said it’s his very favorite yet, so I’ll be making it again, and often!

I found this dish very acidic and therefore very unbalanced.
Just look at all the acidic ingredients, balsamic vinegar, Djoin mustard, tomatoes,lemon juice, lemon zest!!! It also also doesn't mention whether the dish should be covered when baked/roasted. Not a favourite.

I will definitely make this again! Of course I made some changes... I added fresh basil to the marinade. Also - I was out of little tomatoes but had lots of mushrooms so added them instead - very good! AND then I used lime juice and lime zest since my husband loves limes. The FINAL change I made was to make it with Cornish hens instead of chicken. VERY good!!!

Wow - this chicken was so flavorful, tender and moist.  I made it exactly as written, used the cook's note and let it marinate over night.  My guest loved it.  Definitely will make again.

My family really enjoyed the tangy flavor of this chicken. I used honey dijon mustard instead. The marinade was yummy. I served the chicken over white jasmine rice.

I didn't change anything other than adding extra fresh garlic and grilling the chicken. The chicken was very tender and full of flavor. Complimented it with steamed rice, spinach salad with cucs, olives, red onions, and hummus with pita bread. Everyone loved it! Definitely will make it again
Thanks for the recipe!

As I do with all recipes, I made this exactly as written the first time.  It was fabulous!  But I like to subsequently get adventurous with recipes, as I did with this one, and I hit a home run by adding torn fresh basil leaves, sliced kalamata olives and thinly-sliced fresh mozzarella at the end, leaving it in the oven until the cheese was deliciously melted and gooey.  Yeah. That worked.

I chose this recipe because the marinade was new to me I added some tarragon. I separated the marinade, some for the new potatoes and asparagus, some for the chicken. I had no time to let them marinade so I put the potatoes in first for 10 minutes then the chicken then finally the asparagus and the tomatoes.

total cooking time 20 minutes. 400° for the first ten 350 for the final 20 minutes.

squeezed lemon and the zest right before serving.

as I would never mix marinade the chicken was in with anything else so, the marinade was just enough. if I was cooking for more than one person as I was tonight, I would double the marinade. the lemon and zest is a must yes is a high quality balsamic vinegar.

it was delicious and I savored every bite grateful for few dishes to wash

Delicious. A few tips, the marinade needs to be doubled. The cherry tomatoes is not a must have. A regular cubed tomato/ tomatoes will deliver the same result. 
Chicken tenderloins is our preference and the tomatoes should be added at the beginning. 
Thank you for sharing. I will make this again.

Excellent dish! Very simple ingredients and easy to prepare. I marinated it overnight although that probably isn’t necessary. Very flavorful. Served it with a mixed green salad with homemade balsamic vinegar and oil dressing. Wife loved it. I’ll be making this again.

These were very tasty. I loved the marinade. We are not fans of lemon so I did not use that but added a couple tablespoons of blue cheese with the tomatoes and it was so good. I think the cooking time was too long and shortened that but will make this again...so good.

Easy and delicious! Add dry rosemary with the balsamic before marinating and to save calories used water instead of the oil!

This was excellent! I followed someone's comments about adding fire roasted tomatoes into the marinade and omitted the lemon and we really enjoyed this. I also marinated the chicken all day.

This dish really hit the spot with me.  I used high quality stone ground mustard and authentic balsamic vinegar (from Trader Joes), and the results were delicious.  I increased the mustard to approximately 1/2 a cup in the marinade, and used almost an entire bulb of chopped garlic.   In addition to increasing the mustard in the marinade, I rubbed the raw breasts down with even more mustard before I stuck them in a Ziplock bag to hang out in the marinade for 24 hours.  I chose to add my baby tomatoes at the very beginning of the cooking time (instead of partway through), because I wanted them to caramelize and release their sweet, sticky flavor, which they did.  They were an excellent companion to the chicken which was rich with balsamic flavor, but not overpowered by it.  I served this dish with butternut squash risotto and sauteed spinach with asparagus.  An easy, (yet impressive) nutritious meal that I was delighted to serve.

Change: I used what I think are Giada's measurements. 1/4 C. balsamic, 2 Tbl. each Dijon, lemon  juice and EVOO, 2 garlic, full pint of cherry toms, but I only baked 2 breasts. I know I shouldn't rate this with changes, but it was so durned good! My neighbor has been giving me cherry toms all summer, and this was such a nice change from pasta. Someone suggested Yukon gold spuds, so that was my accompaniment. Yum!

I guess I did something wrong because my chicken looked more boiled than roasted. I guess there was too much marinade in the roasting dish. The flavor was good but, I like my chicken browned. I ended up putting the broiler on but by then, my chicken was overcooked. Thanks for the idea. I will use these flavors again in a different way.

This is honestly the best chicken I have ever cooked at home, plus healthy! I let marinate over night, and put the tomatoes in halfway instead of 3/4 of the way. Highly recommend!

This is very good!  For those who question whether to cook the chicken in the marinade - don't - it's marinade, not cooking sauce!  Just make sure to marinade for a long time (at least for six hours, but overnight is better).  Do use the lemon juice - it cuts the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar.  I use extra fresh garlic, because we like it, and always use fresh tomatoes; I don't usually much like tomatoes, but when they're baked fresh, along with the heavily marinated chicken - yum!

This was good! I followed the recipe exactly and let the chicken marinate for 4 hours. it came out perfect. We've never cooked with basalmic vinegar before...it tasted a little tangy and almost like barbeque. Thanks!

I used chicken tenders instead of full chicken breast. I also put bits of fresh mozzarella and bits of ripped up fresh basil on it right before eating. So delicious. Have made it twice in the last two weeks - whole family really enjoys it. Served with brown rice and steamed green beans. Nourishing, satisfying meal.

Just made it again and reduced cooking time to 15 min then 10 min  based on size of chicken tenders.  Also added some additional varieties of larger tomatoes and some parsley and basil from my garden for the second cooking period. Turned out great again!

Someone else said not to cook the chicken in the marinade, but I always do and I like having the sauce so I can put a little on it with the rice. Since I use chicken tenders,  I don't let it sit for that long in the marinade before cooking, maybe a half hour out of the fridge at the most.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to make.  I didn't add the tomatoes as it was a last minute decision to make.  Marinated for about 45 minutes and it still was delicious.
Highly recommend.

Very tart which one should figure when using balsamic vinegar and lemon. Not sure about the comments that said this recipe was too sweet. I cooked as noted and all I tasted was bitterness. To tame it I added a little brown sugar and cream/milk. Was edible after these additions.

I made this for supper and I had unexpected guest pop on as well. Happy I had made extra. Anyhow, these were delicious. For sides i made arugula and baked potato put the chicken on top of the arugula and it was delicious. Asked if it was a keeper and including my picky 10yr old said yes definitely. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe will be making it again.

Tasted good but the chicken was quite over cooked. Probably would have been fine with 25-30 min cooking time total.

I liked this, as did my wife. My adult children were not as keen. As we have a fan oven, I baked at 180C for 20 minutes plus 10 minutes with the tomatoes, and the chicken came out cooked and moist.

This was really tasty!  I cooked it for less time than it called for - 30 minutes total and it could have been 5 minutes less.  The chicken was just a tad dry.  But, the tomatoes more than made up for it.  Next time i'll do about 25 minutes and expect it will be perfect!  Served over white rice.

Ok, added extra garlic (My family loves it.. and I use the pre minched garlic), a little extra vinegar,  a descent amount of unseasoned meat tenderizer (secret ingredient to any meat based meal!), freshly ground pepper and salt. Marinated overnight in a bag. Cooked for the first  thirty minutes per recipe. Added a variety of yellow pear and sungold cherries (they're what's ripe, lol!). I then cooked itor another 20 - 30 minutes... until the tomatoes burst from the heat.
Plated with grated Parmesan (just a pinch), fresh cut basil (you pick the leaves, and after washing and drying, pull all the leaves off the stalk. Roll them, length wise, so they resemble a cigarette. With a VERY sharp paring knife, cut thin sliversoff your basil smoke.). After adding the Parmesan and the basil, drizzle with balsamic vinegar glaze in what ever pattern looks appealing to you. 
(I need up cutting chicken into thin slivers before topping it.... OMG!!!!!! So, so, so very good, we just had that and a garden salad and all three of my kids loved it!)
(Only downside: we made a plate for my husband (he works graves) and he said that after it had set in the microwave for several hours the chicken completely dried out)
Moral of the story, eat everything, leave the husband cereal and/or salad!

Oh!! And I forgot the lemon juice and zest.. until we had all sat down. And by then... have you ever see how hyena's eat? Well....that would be my three teenagers once they got their plates.

l usually don't like tomatoes cooked but the vinegar really brought out the sweetness in them . Absolutely delicious recipe. Paired with an antipasto salad. Very light summer dinner. Great with a cold glass off Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.

Well, I could eat it--it was edible.  Not worth the ingredients to marinate that's for sure. Terrible.

Marinade did nothing for the chicken.  Very bland.  You are better off just dry roasting a chicken breast with butter and garlic salt.  Blech.

We found this to be overpowered by the balsamic. If I make it again, I'll experiment with alternatives like white wine and just a small amount of balsamic.  Otherwise it was okay, I didn't have to throw the chicken away, and I found the tomatoes to be surprisingly tasty (though also too sour from the balsamic) but my husband didn't like the tomatoes.

Was an ok recipe. I really like balsamic vinegar but something about the flavor here didn't hit home with me. 
I did full amount of marinade for 2 breasts and cooked for total 28 minutes, putting in tomatoes and asparagus in last 10 minutes.

I made this recipe and the family loved the taste.  The tomatoes really added to the flavor.  It is easy to make and is a nice dish for company.

Delicious with fresh salad. Will definitely make again. Agree with other comments that twice the quantity of mustard works best. If you cam marinade the chicken for 24 hours.  If you like olives and feta add them into the salad as this really enhances the overall flavour of the dish.

I marinated the chicken breasts for a couple of days in the refrigerator. I then grilled it outside (instead of putting it in the oven). I did not add the tomatoes. My husband loved it.

Amazing flavor! The marinade made the chicken tender and juicy. Definitely a pleaser in our house, and we have some picky eaters. Will be appearing on our table again.

Excellent change of pace dinner. Use internal temp to be sure not to overcook. The longer you marinade it the better.

I thought this was okay, but wouldn't make it again. Presentation needs some help because it's not pretty out of the oven - sprinkle with parsley or chopped green onion for some more color. I didn't think the lemon zest was necessary. After four hours of marinating I was hoping for some awesome flavor, but not impressed. The upside is that it's a super easy dish.

I made it exactly like the recipe, and like a few others,my husband and I thought it was dry. The flavor of the sauce was good, and the tomatoes, made it taste better, but we  both thought it was just okay. I might try making it one more time and cooking for only 30 minutes total.

I'm not a fan of chicken breasts - find them too dry- but I enjoyed this dish!  I also cut the cooking time by 10 minutes.  I forgot the lemon so next time would try that to see if it made any difference.

Considering how easy this was to prepare, it was a very good week night recipe.  I made this last minute so I didn't have enough time to marinate according to the directions and it was still very good.  I look forward to making it again when I can marinate it at least for 4 hours, if not longer.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe except that I added a little extra Dijon.  Not much though, just about half a tablespoon.  I marinated the chicken for four hours and that seems like enough time. I use Nature's Promise individually wrapped chicken breasts which are small so I also cut back on the time.  I roasted for 15 minutes then added the tomatoes and roasted for another 10 minutes.  Came out perfect.  I drizzled the lemon juice but did not sprinkle the zest.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious!!! This pairs well with steamed green beans, or over an arugula salad with baby mozzarella. Just make sure not to serve it with too much of the leftover balsamic, or you'll end up with a puddle on your plate.

Made this for dinner.   Marinaded overnight.   Pan fried the chicken instead of baking.   Loved the flavor of this marinade.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a big hit with everyone in our family. We are trying to eat healthier and this certainly fit the bill and was very tasty besides. I used a bit more garlic and didn't bother with the lemon zest, just the juice. Thanks for sharing!

The recipe  was a hot mess for me.  I did listen to others and turned the oven down to 350 degrees too.  I marinated the chicken all day - 8 hours (as several suggested) - this was too long and the chicken became mealy after cooking literally disintegrating in your mouth.  The chicken was very dry as well.  

The flavors were good and if I decide to try this again I would marinate for 2-3 hours and grill.

I used 3 Roma tomatoes cut into quarters instead and added some shredded parmesan cheese rather then lemon zest.  It is a great recipe.  I would cook this again.

This was pretty good! I have to say my fiancé and son both devoured this recipe! I didn't marinate for 4 hours because I didn't have that kind of time, literally cooked it right after I made it, but we threw it on the grill and it came out so delicious. We paired this main with a Taziki basmati rice for a light and healthy dinner. Yum!

I really liked this. It was good even the next day warmed up, shredded and stuffed into a tortilla with some cheese. I followed the recipe exactly, though I did cut it in half. I marinated the chicken overnight in a baggie so the pieces really got a chance to soak up the marinade and cooked it for lunch.

Very yummy, I did end up overcooking it a bit but next time will keep an eye on things. I didn't do the cherry tomatoes. Definitely increased the amount of garlic I added. Marinated for more than 4 hours. Just roasted some potatoes and broccoli in a separate pan but next time will put them in together.

Made this today and was a little worried hubby would not like it. He love, loved this... He said the only reason he stopped eating was because he was afraid he would pop. I made it to the recipe. Even the lemon juice at the end. I think this is needed or the balsamic is too stronge. I did marinade for two days and the chicken was cut up into chunks. Served with brown rice and bacon with sauté cabbage. It was very good.

Great, good-looking dish. Easy to prep and cook. I'd cut down on the balsamic just a bit next time. But it went great with the basmati rice and veggies.

I thought this was very good, but my husband (who doesn't like balsamic vinegar) didn't like it.  I used about 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, and a Tablespoon of minced garlic in addition to everything else in the ingredients. Cooked for 30 mins, broiled for 5 mins, then added tomatoes and cooked at 400 for 10-15 mins more. Yum!

My family did not enjoy this at all.  The chicken was tender but the balsamic vinegar overpowered the recipe. Still, there are many reviewers that liked it so don't let this stop you!  You may just be a better cook than me.

Made this for the first time tonight, and it was awesome! I just put in a little be extra dijon and olive oil, and reduced the cooking time by about five minutes. I served it basmati rice and a vegetable medley.

I think I would have given this 5 stars if I had been feeling a little better.  As it was , I wasn't at my best but my boyfriend vouched for me that it was delicious!  I used 6 boneless chicken thighs, and marinated for about 5 hours in a tupperware container.  I put the chicken in a baking dish, added the halved-tomatoes to the leftover marinade, swirled it around a bit, and dumped it over the top of the chicken.  Baked as directed.  Squeezed juice from 1 small lemon over the top.  Served with couscous.  I will make it again, and re-rate if necessary!

Simple and delicious. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so did as another reviewer suggested and added a can of diced. I also made the balsamic glaze here on AR and spooned some of that over the finished chicken. We didn't have a starch, but this would have been delicious with rice, I believe.

This was really good, with great flavor!  I'm not a huge chicken fan, as many times it's rubber-like and grisly.  My son and husband loved it, however, my 13 year old daughter, did not.  I used 7 frozen chicken tenders, instead of fresh chicken breasts.  My family aren't tomato fans, so I left those out, although, I love tomatoes!  I baked chicken covered for the first 20 minutes, and the last 10 minutes uncovered.

Very good, excellent with a side salad. I used chicken thighs, since that's what I had on hand.

I made this recipe as shown. I really liked it, but I may eliminate the zest next time. I did find it dry, mine wasn't juicy at all. I'll make it again but I need to fix that part. Anyone have suggestions?

Yes, I omitted the tomatoes as I had none in hand and we barbecued it.  Next time I will follow the exact recipe to test which I prefer.

Will make this again! If you like balsamic and lemon, you will love this.  It came out tender and juicy and the tomatoes added a nice touch - I marinated them separately in some balsamic vinegar before adding to the chicken.  Went well with asparagus with lemon.

Didn't have the red wine, so I just eliminated it.  Also, I used chicken tenders instead of the whole breast.  Good flavor.

the only change was I marinated the chicken in a plastic bag for 5 hrs. I turned out great and everyone loved it.

I made this for my husband, a diabetic whom I'm always trying to tempt with different flavors for boneless, skinless chicken breast.  He loved this!  He gave me a taste and it was WAY TOO DRY.  If I got this served to me in a restaurant, I would've sent it back as TOO overcooked.  Next time, for my preference, I'd cook it for WAY less time.  But, the flavors were THERE.  I'm making this again.

The only thing I did differently to this recipe, I didn't use lemon or zest and no cherry tomatoes. I did marinate the chicken overnight. (Added extra garlic & mustard YUM!) Hubby put on the grill the next day. It was excellent!! will definitely make it again!!

Delicious! Hubby liked it, so that is a big plus.
Very tender, great flavor.
I only used 2 breasts, since there are only 2 of us, so I think next time I'll use less vinegar. 
But I will make it again.

I love you guys' reviews; always rely on input before making the recipe now.  I didn't have cherry tomatoes and was going to skip it (like I may often do if I don't have a specific ingredient) but read some of you use canned, diced tomatoes which were great!  Also someone mentioned feta and since I'm  cheese person grated some on top just before leaving the oven.  Oh and I had a 1/2 zucchini and 1/2 little yellow one and sliced them up too along with 3 little green onions and of course fresh basil herbs!  Served it over my fave brown rice and it was great!
Sufina  PS I also marinated it in a plastic bag overnite.

The balsalmac vinegar overpowered the chicken.    I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

This is good and easy. I only made two modifications. I doubled the mustard as I thought the vinegar might be too strong. The other change was I used whole legs - less expensive and better flavor in my opinion.

Tasted too much like vinegar. my hubby and I and all 3 kids were not impressed at all and we made it exactly according to recipe.
