I have made a similar cake like this for years.  This was a good recipe, but still like my old favorite.  Marshmellows, butter(real butter), vanilla, popcorn, M & Ms and cashews.  I salt the popcorn and then the added sweet things are just right!

I have this recipe and for my daughter while she had braces we adapted it by using the popcorn that is hull-less from the store. We also add gumdrops that you can usually find cheapest at Wal-Mart(do NOT add BLACK..yucky flavor! Add them at the end so they don't melt, we also like to add M&M's- we add them last also. We find it fun to coordinate colors with the seasons. Holiday time with red and green M&M's and red and green gum drops is really fun, esp with my 40-50's singles group! It works for all age groups!!!

i did this a little bit different using the itmes i had onhand. i omitted the peanuts and peanut butter and added orange food coloring to the marshmallow/butter mixture to make them orange for halloween. i added the chocolate chips last to limit some of the melting due to the warm marshmallow mixture. also, i just pressed into a large greased bowl and allowed to cool. it tasted good though my husband could't get over the fact that the orange coloring made it look like cheese popcorn with chocolate chips.

I made this recipe and sent it to a party I did not attend. The reviews I got back were very positive. I changed the peanuts to peanut butter chips, and I added a few extra chocolate chips. I did not get to taste it but it seemed to be a hit. The only negative words were from my boy friends' 18yr old daughter who wants me to make it with Rice Krispies next time. It looks like a keeper. I want to add, this was the dish I made for the kids at the party.

Yummy and easy, if you let the peanutbutter mixture cool just slighty and add the chocolate chips at the end you shouldn't have a problem with them melting. I spread them out in a cake pan and cut them into squares.

This was a disaster! Since others liked it, I'll assume it was the cook. I found the popcorn tough and chewy.

This was a Mother's Day hit!  Our family has already requested it at Christmas.  The only changes I made were to use real butter and I used mini baking M&Ms in place of the chocolate chips.  My M&Ms melted a bit, so I can only imagine how much uncoated chocolate chips would melt.  This came together in no time.  The hardest part of making this was finding a bowl large enough to mix it all in.  THANKS, for the recipe!

My husband and I make this cake at Christmas time. We use all different kinds of nuts (mixed nuts in a can), baking chips (chocolate, butterscotch,white chocolate) M&M's. Cut it into chunks and take to gatherings, My in-laws love it and our neice asks for one espcially for her to have and eat. The kids like it too, I will have to make one and add gummy bears to it, sounds good to me. I have never thought of using them until reading these reviews.
