i HAVE to give this five stars...it's MY recipe! however, reading all the reviews (thank you)' i felt compelled to write and say "yes, thirty minutes IS too long!" my mom-in-law got confused on the cooking time! 15 minutes is plenty. you can also add a little dry wine (red or white)instead of balsamic vinegar, and throw in a chopped shallot or two just for fun. 
thank you for all the wonderful reviews and ratings! good eating!

Since we eat sauteed mushrooms frequently, both in restaurants and those I prepare at home, maybe that explains why we didn't think these were anything special. I usually saute mine in butter, Worcestershire sauce, Lawry's seasoning salt and pepper--so I thought the balsamic vinegar and oregano used in this recipe would give them a different flavor twist. In the final analysis, however, hubby and I both agree that these were just....mushrooms.

Me and my wife ate an entire batch!!! I did substitute the oregano for thyme and I cut down the cook time by about 10 minutes finally I deglazed the pan with red wine when the shrooms were done cooking. This is a very tasty recipe and goes great with steak

After so many years of great reviews, I felt like commenting again on this recipe - since it is, after all mine. I've spent a lot of time refining this recipe, and thought I'd share my thoughts on the subject. These days, I start with an 8 oz. package of mushrooms - 1 pound was another clerical error by my mother-in-law - it was always 8 ounces. I start with medium-high heat, and just the butter and mushrooms. Once the 'shrooms start to give up their moisture, I lower the temp to medium andI add crushed garlic and sea salt - two cloves usually. I try not to add the balsamic vinegar too soon, so it doesn't get scorchy and lose its punch. This only takes around 10 mins or so. After I add the vinegar, I kick the heat all the way to high for a couple of minutes. This quickly reduces the balsamic/butter mix without overcooking the shrooms and killing their flavor. The mushrooms shouldn't spend more than 10 -12 minutes on average. Glad everyone has enjoyed the recipe all these years!

UNREAL! The balsamic vinegar was the PERFECT touch. I just added a little salt. This is going to become a weekly dish for me.

Just an update: this HAS become a weekly dish for me. I even made it for my boyfriend a couple of times. Definitely a winner in my book.

These are sooo good.  I was definately apprehensive about the vinegar, but curiousity got the best of me and they are awesome.  I have made them twice, the first time with balsamic, and the second time I was out so I tried rice wine vinegar, and believe me.. balsamic makes all the difference.

Awesome! I was looking for a different mushroom saute to go with my steak and i found it. I used regular mushrooms and garlic powder instead of crushed garlic. It turned out great!

These were well received by my crew.  I'm not a big mushroom person, so I skipped on this one, but everyone ate this with smiles.  Thanks Lanni.

This recipe didn't come out tasting like much.  It almost seemed like 1/2 an hour was too long to be cooking the mushrooms, causing them to lose the taste of the sauce.

I used to make a similar dish years ago.  I tried to remember the ingredients but just couldn't get it to taste right.  I was so happy when I found this recipe!  They were great!  I made them exactly the way the recipe called for this time, but I can't wait to play with different herbs such as tarragon or basil.  Thanks to Pat for sharing this recipe with his mother-in-law,Lanni.

Yum!  The caramelized balsamic brings a little sweetness to the mushrooms.  Next time I will reduce the butter to 1 tablespoon and only cooked for 15 minutes.  Seemed like too much.  Great served over a burger with swiss cheese!

YUM!! We absolutely loved this mushroom side dish. Didn't change a thing! They were flavorful, beautiful, and oh so easy! The balsamic really adds that perfect touch. I slow sauteed my thick-cut mushrooms (it took about 20 min.) and they really soaked up that rich, buttery glaze but still had a little firmness -- just how we like them! The key is to saute until they reach your desired tenderness, no matter how long. Thank you for sharing this great recipe! It's a keeper! :)

We LOVE these! I use 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil, and about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, then I sprinkle about 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning (best from Penzey's). The photo shows onions, which would be good by themselves in the same spices on fajitas, but not with the mushrooms, IMHO. Happy cooking! TRY THESE!!

Simple and delicious. Subbed Mr. Yoshida’s Original Marinade & Cooking Sauce for balsamic vinegar.  Topped with mozzarella cheese.

A new fav!  This was delish!  I only had 1/2 lb of portobella mushrooms on hand so I added chopped onion.  Will be making this regularly.

Good mushroom recipe! I only sliced enough mushrooms for a single serving but I didn't change the amounts of the other ingredients (I actually added more balsamic - not on purpose, I thought it said 1 tbsp!) and it was really tasty. I thought it burned really quickly but it was just a really nice caramelization from the balsamic. Mine didn't even need 10 minutes cooking time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good!  I used an egg slicer to slice the mushrooms (I think next time I might just slice the mushrooms in half), eyeballed the ingredients, and added half a white onion, salt, and pepper.  I let it simmer 5-10 minutes.  Yum!

Killer idea using the balsamic. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because while I was getting everything ready I let the shrooms saute with just salt, pepper, olive oil and balsamic for a few mins before I added everything and that alone tasted amazing. Everything else was delicious too but I really don't think you need the butter - lessens the balsamic goodness. Thanks Pat, you rock.

funny this look familiar...  I'll have to try the balsamic sometime.  I use red wine vigegar and fresh parsley instead of oregano.  Lotssss of garlic cuz I love some garlic.  I've tried white/red wine but the vinegar gives it a little bite.  I would probably use 2 lbs of mushrooms because I like them 'over cooked.'

I love this recipe! It's so easy and it's so tasty! It's great for a quick and easy side dish. I increase the vinegar and oregano a little bit, but that's cause I love balsamic vinegar. This is a definite must try!

I didn't think I was a mushroom fan until I made these, and now I make them all the time. To make the dish a bit more friendly to my new year's resolution, I've taken to adding a bit more garlic and leaving out the butter and reducing the oil. The mushrooms have enough moisture and the balsamic is so flavorful, I don't really miss it.

Fabulous, and even better with a bit more balsamic vinegar!  If you're using pre-sliced mushrooms, which tend to be thinner, 10 minutes is about right for cooking time.  The flavor is great, but not overpowering enough to clash with whatever seasoning you use on your steaks.

These mushrooms are soooo good. I made them as I side dish. Didn't use buttons but instead regular mushrooms on the larg side. I cut them in quarters, sauteed them for 20 min. Had to make more because my daughter and friend could not stop eating them and my husband didn't get any from first batch. I think these are best served and eaten immediately and not reheated. Haven't been able to find out though as they do not last long enough.

These mushrooms are delicious- but 30 minutes is WAY too long to cook them. Make a lot- they go fast!!

These were excellent!! Nicely seasoned without overpowering the delicate mushroom flavor.
I quartered whole mushrooms instead of sliced and had them as side dish. Highly recommend for mushroom lovers and non lovers alike.

Delish!  After tasting it as written I added a little garlic salt and fresh ground white pepper (felt it more appropriate for this dish than black pepper).  Results were amazing, and the hubs-to-be moaned over every bite.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe from the start!

The mushrooms will put off a lot of juice, so be patient for the sauce to reduce at the end of cooking.  I brought the temp down to medium low and left it uncovered for a few minutes.  Would pair wonderfully with any dish.... steak, pork chops, or grilled chicken like we did in this instance.  Very tasty!

worked out very well and simple to add to a brown sauce for salisbury steak. I did substitute savory for oregano. I dont do mushrooms without savory.

These were very good.  We love using a good quality balsamic in anything from salad dressings to sauteed veggies, it adds great flavour!  Very nice side dish...definitely does not need the 20-30 minutes of cooking time, around 15 should work!

My husband loved this. He likes mushrooms but I am not a big fan, I just started eating them and I did like this recipe. The combination of flavours is nice, I like the taste of oregano in it. I used two tablespoons oil and 1 tbs butter. Came out great!

This is good. Never thought about the oregano or vinegar. When we had a RV I used to put mushrooms in a container with butter salt and a splash of A1 in the microwave for 3 minutes and serve over steak. It tasted about the same.

My husband was kidding me saying "I bet you can't find a recipe for sauteed mushrooms on Allrecipes". I replied "I bet I can". Ha, Ha. You can tell who won. (He thinks I can't cook without a recipe from Allrecipes). These were really tasty. Added more garlic. A little less balsalmic vinegar. Thanks once again to Allrecipes!

I don't really like mushrooms but I thought this was nice. My fiance is a mushroom lover and he really liked it. The only change I made (apart from the cooking time) was using thyme instead of oregano.

This dish is great because I always have the ingredients on hand.  Be careful about burning the butter!  At first, I thought that there was not enough sauce for the mushrooms, but after adding 8 oz, then waiting for it to wilt, I was able to add the other half, especially since the other half had already released its liquid.  This dish was great with City Chicken.  Thanks, I am already passing this recipe to my roommate, and she just had it 1/2 an hour ago!

It does seem that 30 minutes is too long... but... this recipe made me fall in love with mushrooms. It is great and my whole family loved it when I served it at Thanksgiving. I highly recommend making this.

I don't like mushrooms, but I made it for mine and my husband's family for Easter dinner and everyone said they were the best mushrooms they ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think these were too bad, but the balsamic flavor was too much. My husband didn't like them at all... he did not like the sweetness of the vinegar. If I make these again, I will cut the vinegar down or take it out completely.

My teenage son has loved mushrooms since he was young and I was looking for a little something different. I thought this recipe looked great! When we sat down to eat I asked how my son how he liked it. He looked at me very seriously, "I will tell you when I am done." Everyone else said they loved them right away, but I was anxiously awaiting the mushroom experts verdict. He put the last bite of his second serving in his mouth and said with a big grin, "Are there anymore?" Well, I think we have a winner! :D

Very good! I've made this a few times and I've found a good shortcut to the garlic and oregano is to use some garlic butter (see recipe by Denyse on this site), something I keep on hand all the time. With that, I've got the garlic, butter and herbs in one. When I make some dishes, such as pot roast, I've also taken to using a mix of veggies, with an 8oz container of sliced mushrooms and some frozen harvest veggies. I saute the frozen veggies first for a few minutes, then toss in the mushrooms for the last 15 minutes. The garlic butter also comes in handy to serve with dinner rolls or bread sticks.

The only change I made to the recipe was that I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic (as I did not have any on hand at the time). I also used both white button mushrooms and baby portabello (4 mushrooms each) as I was only feeding 2 people not 4.  I sauted it for 15 minutes as recommended in one of the reviews. The dish was a hit and got two thumbs up from everyone. Will definitely be keeping this recipe to use again.

Yum yum. I am actually not a  fan a of mushrooms all but this was absoultely delicious. I made these to top grilled steaks and now I'm going to make them just to eat alone. Thanks to Pat I think I actually like mushrooms now! Reminder: You probably only need to sautee for 10 min or so and add a touch of salt.

This is a great mushroom recipe!!  If you buy pre-cut mushrooms, don't get steak cut, as they're a bit thick and don't absorb the flavor of the saute all the way through.  Sliced should work fine.    I also added about 1/3 cup sliced tomato because it happened to be in the fridge, which made the recipe more saucy and sort of gave it the flavor of Chicken Marengo.  Also, I didn't find any problems using the leftovers the next day.  I just put them on some panini bread with a slice of mozzarella cheese and put it in the toaster oven.  Delicious mushroom panini.

Making the recipe as stated rendered fairly bland mushrooms. The balsamic vinegar lost it's bite and the mushrooms were way too soggy. I revised the recipe to double the balsamic vinegar and added worchestershire sauce in addition to 2 more garlic cloves, 3 shallots, salt and pepper. I cooked it for about half the time and the mushrooms turned out well.

It's easy to play around with different ingredients for this recipe. This is good plain; with just salt, pepper and butter. This is the best with a grilled T-Bone. So good.

We make this just as the recipe says and we LOVE it! My husband has never really liked mushrooms, but I made this one day and put it over some garlic chicken I made on ciabatta buns with provolone cheese. Oh my word! It was HEAVENLY! The PERFECT topper! I have made this a few times all for different uses and have loved it with everything we have made!

Great Recipe!!!  I used the mushrooms over a t-bone cooked medium rare.  The flavor was robust, and the mushrooms were tender, but not soggy.  I have been searching for a good mushroom sauté recipe for a long time, this is the one I will use from now on.  WOW were those mushrooms great!!!!!

This recipe was tasty.  I made these and we ate them on burgers for mushroom cheeseburgers and they were very good like this.  I didn't think they were anything super special though which is why I'm only giving them 4 stars.  I would however make them again.

These were excellent! I also added a whole Vidalia onion. I tend to like garlic salt so I added about a 1/2 tsp since the minced garlic did not seem to be garlicky enough. Goes excellent with steak.

Very good side dish.  I added a Vidalia onion to which was wonderful with the sweetness of the Balsamic vinegar.  We will definitely have this again.

these were good, but in no way a culinary 'experience'.  i added sliced onions and a little cayenne pepper to the saute.  good stuff (pretty hard to mess up 'shrooms), but same ol' same ol' at the same time.

This is good.  Although not 5 stars good.  I love balsalmic vinegar, so I really had high hopes for this dish.  Don't get me wrong, it was very edible.  I'm just looking for one that knocks my socks off!

I was looking for a low carb side dish and found this.  It was absolutely amazing.  I doubled the garlic and oregano then sprinkled more oregano and some garlic powder after doubling.  I love garlic though.

Best sauteed mushrooms I've ever had!  I normally make them without the oregeno and vinegar, and that change added a ton of flavor.

These were excellent w/ our steaks. I skipped the balsamic vinegar and used a little lemon juice instead. I also used fresh oregano just b/c I happened to have some on hand, but, I am sure the dried would be just as good. I also added some sliced onions, which I sauteed for a couple minuted w/ the garlic before adding the mushrooms. yum, yum!

I always have to fix these with steaks now.  I add 1 diced shallot and when I get done cooking the steaks, I make a point of adding any accumlated steak juices to the mushrooms.  Always gone within minutes of putting on the table.

I made this with fresh portabella mushrooms and cut the portion size down to   1, upped the balsamic and garlic (can never have too much garlic) and it came out as a great side dish.

i took the suggestion of others and added more balsamic which turned out to be too much. i don't know how i screwed this up but i wasn't fond of the result so i drained the mushrooms, put them in an oven safe pan and covered them with shredded mozzarella to bake at 350 until browned. not spectacular but better with cheese.

These were good, but I wasn't blown away or anything.  You couldn't really taste the spices so next time I will marinate them and see if that makes a difference.

I once worked at a restaurant that had the most amazing sauteed mushrooms for an appitizer, and I made this dish and they tasted exactly the same!  These are amazing as an app, a side dish, or on top of a steak.  Thank you for the recipe!

Even my little boy liked these!!!  So easy and good!!!  I didn't use fresh mushrooms, as I'm a freak and prefer the canned.  But so flavorful and tasty!!!  These would be great on steaks, or to use on a cheesesteak sandwich.  Thanks so much for adding some pizazz to mushrooms!!

These mushrooms turned out pretty tasty.  They definitely tasted better hot than reheated.  I only sauteed the mushroom for about 10-12 minutes, which was more than sufficient.  I found the flavor a little lacking, so I think next time I might just add a tad bit more garlic and oregano.

Delicious-good enough for company! I substituted dried parlsey, for color & taste, for the dried oregano as my husband isn't an oregano fan.  I'm not sure why they were so tasty; maybe the balsamic vinegar is the secret.  I'd say 15 to 20 minutes of sauteeing is plenty.  You want them nicely browned but not dried out.  I had them as a side with grilled steak last night & made some more this morning for a mushroom omelet.

We make sauteed mushrooms at least 2ce a month to go with our dinners and these were a little disappointing.  I made them exactly as written in the recipe.  The balsamic gave it a wonderful little taste boost but they lacked something I cannot put my finger on.  I added salt and pepper and they still lacked.  IF I make these again, I will delete the olive oil as they were a tad greasy even when they were done and the  carmelization was there. I would add onion and maybe some of my own little tweaks.

This is my favorite version of sauteed mushrooms on the site. It was delicious. I love the balsamic vinegar.

Edit: I've made it several times now and it's still great. I accidentally made it with half the mushrooms last time. I may make that a permanent change.

I thought the balsamic vinegar added Pop to the mushrooms without overwhelming the natural flavours.  I liked it!

made this tonight, turned out well. I only needed to saute about 12-13 minutes, though. would make again, though the quality of the balsamic makes a difference, I'm sure.

These are pretty easy. I, however, did not have the balsamic vinegar and added regular vinegar instead. I will have to try the balsamic because I hear it makes the recipe. Overall, very similar to most saute mushrooms I have already tried.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I doubled the vinegar & oregano.  They were still pretty bland.  I'll pass on this one.

Great recipe but it also needed something else so I added roughly chopped onions in as well.  I think next time I will add roughly chopped parsley as well.  Recipe is still really good without these changes and tastes like it would in the restaurants.  Bon appetite!

I personally do not like mushrooms, so I didn't eat them.  My husband gave them 5 stars.  He only added a little salt and pepper to them.  I served them with smoked salmon and a romaine salad with lemon vinaigrette.

I agree with a reviewer that the balsamic vinegar lost its flavor in the midst of cooking.  I had to add some halfway through.  I also added some onions.  Like other reviewers I only cooked it half the time and it was excellent in the end.

I tried the recipe as is, but I prefer mushrooms sauteed with diced onion, olive oil, and salt and pepper. So good! Thanks for the idea.

As someone else suggested we added a shallots to this recipe.  It was fantastic!  I've always loved sauted mushrooms on top of steak - this is good enough to eat by itself! Thanks Pat for the great recipe!

Great! The cooking time listed is WAY too long so those who gave this recipe mediocre reviews probably cooked them at the suggested rate and lost all the yummy mushroom flavoring. I tasted it in less than 10 mins and thought it was wonderful. Unfortunately my main dish wasn't ready yet so I left it on the stove on low heat for a while longer to keep it hot. When I ate it after cooking it longer, it tasted so much more bland and was rubbery.

Wonderful - and I made do, instead of running back to the store. I didn't have balsamic vinegar and had just ran out of Olive Oil. So I modified with what I had available 1/2 tbspn of Zesty Italian dressing and 1 tsp of distilled vinegar and it turned out wonderful. Not sure that it would have even needed the olive oil as the butter and the moisture from the mushrooms themselves made it plenty greasy. I had extra butter sitting next to the stove but never needed it. Turned out flavorful and yummy even with my crazy (out of necessity) substitutions.

This was very good!  I didn't have the vinegar so used the white cooking wine. I sauteed them with pork chops and my husband and I both thought that this made the pork chops very tender. I definitely will use again

This is a delicious and easy recipe. The mushrooms come out so tender and buttery. A great side dish for grilled fish. Thanks!

My husband and I love this recipe. He usually hates it when I use balsamic vinegar, but not with this dish. I toss a small handful of shredded hard italian cheeses over the top and stir it in right at the end. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Mushrooms almost always went bad in my fridge, because I never knew what to do with them!  As a newleywed, I am always on the lookout for easy, delicious recipes to make my new hubby happy.  This one did the trick, and more! Thank you!

These were good but a little bland for my taste. They definitely needed a little salt, so I added garlic salt. I also added more fresh garlic and used baby bella mushrooms too because that is all I had on hand.

This is a good and very easy recipe--I would say that it is more suited as a topping for steak or other meat, rather than as a stand-alone side dish.  The balsamic vinegar adds a nice, mellow tang.  The only thing it needed was a bit of salt.  Also, I turned the heat up from medium to high at the end of the cooking to ensure that all of the juices were absorbed.  A nice, simple dish!

I'd been looking for a good recipe for sauteed mushrooms, and this was it. Instead of button mushrooms I used a blend of portabello, crimini, and yellow oyster.

Thank you so much for giving me that ever elusive recipe for restaurant style mushrooms!  I agree with the other posters, they do not need to be cooked that long.  Don't be scared of the oregano, I almost didn't add it but I think that's what gives it that restaurant taste (along with the vinegar).  Next time I am going to add some onions.  Thanks again for the five star recipe.

I added onions and used sliced baby portabella mushrooms, but kept the recipe the same otherwise.  Oh and I
shortened the cooking time to only about 5 mins and covered with a lid to let "steam", as another user also suggested.

I followed the recipe as is, except I only had half a lb. of mushrooms, but I kept the measurements on everything else the same. They weren't anything special and I couldn't taste the vinegar or the oregano.

Pat!  Thank you!   These were TERRIFIC.  I added way too much oregano (tried to do the Rachael Ray thing and not measure -- got me into trouble!) And even with too much oregano, these were awesome.  The balsamic vinegar is the key to this recipe  ;)

This is the best recipe mushroom saute that I have tasted. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting back a little of the balsamic vinegar. I'm not really a big fan of that taste. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce and some onions. Absolutely the best and my search for sauteed mushrooms is over!! Thanks for sharing.

Not in a million years did I ever think I'd be RAVING about mushrooms, but these are simply amazing!  Great tangy flavor.  I had some big mushroom slices so I increased the oo and bv just until all the slices were lightly coated.  Only had to saute for 10 minutes until they were perfectly tender.

These were very good. I also used more balsamic vinegar and a bit more oil. I only sauteed about 8 minutes, maybe heat was too high but they were fantastic anyway. I don't see why you need to let them simmer but maybe I will try that next time. I served them over French Dip Sandwiches from this site. Whole meal was excellant!

I added sliced onions in with the mushrooms and let them marinade together.  Sauted as stated but I also added about 2 tbsp. of the balsamic vinegar.  My husband really enjoyed the mushrooms and I really enjoyed the onions served over steaks on the grill.  Thanks

Good 'shrooms.  I added a lot more balsamic vinegar and garlic than the recipe stated.  I also used fresh oregano from my herb garden.  And like other reviewers, add salt and pepper to taste.  I didn't saute anywhere near 20-30 minutes.  A nice side dish for almost any main meal.

Ok, so I changed the recipe a bit...but we loved these. Omitted the olive oil, forgot the balsamic (will try next time), used Italian seasoning v. just oregano. Plus, I started with one thinly sliced onion, then after a couple minutes added the mushrooms and 3 tsp chopped garlic. Also cooked at a high heat bc we like them camelized a bit. Thanks for the springboard Pat!

These mushrooms are great on steak or as a sidedish.  My husband & I loved them but thought they could use more balsamic vinegar.  I agree with others about the portion size.  The mushrooms really shrink up.  The two of us ate all of these.

Ohhhhh soooo good!  Added a little more chopped garlic and two pinches of salt.  Will definitely add this easy recipe to my favorites.  Other reviewers are right about the portions, though - the 2 of us finished this recipe off in one sitting (4 people would come to blows dividing this up!!)

This is a fantastic recipe Lanni! Added more garlic and some minced onion, lots of black pepper and a bit of salt at the end. Used cremini mushrooms and served this with steak. Kids and hubby loved it! Thanks so much!

I LOVE this recipe!!  The only thing I do differently is cook the mushrooms over a higher heat so they caramelize and get a nice deep brown color.  I also add a little bit of precooked crumbled bacon about mid way through to add salt & additional flavor.  I might try mixing this with some green beans tonight....yum!

This is a quick, simple and tasty little side dish. I make it on a regular basis. I usually use just a good squirt of butter-flavored Pam, and Italian seasoning. I agree with Janessa that a little pinch of salt improves the flavor. Thanks, Lanni!

I personally hate mushrooms but I served these with Thanksgiving dinner since my mom LOVES mushrooms.  Many family members enjoyed these and used the leftovers to fry up in their omelets this morning.  This was very easy and I will definitely make these for my family again.

Balsamic vinegar seemed to overpower the mushrooms, and since I love mushrooms, I like them just sauteed in butter better. Might try it again with a touch less balsamic vinegar and see how that works, though.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I have made this recipe as is, I've made it with fresh oregano instead of dried and I've done it with about 1/4 cup white wine and it always turns out delicious. I've had it with steak or just on top of a cheeseburger. It's also good on a burger with a spoon of sour cream...mmmmmm.

wasn't too fond of this.  It just didn't have that ummph that I was looking for.  I didn't like the combination flavor of the oregano with the balsamic vinegar.  Won't make this again.

fantastic recipe. First time I made them used 8oz white button mushrooms and 8oz baby portabellos along with vidalia onion.  Served with charcoal grilled ribeye steaks. Wish I'd have made more!  Then we tried it with whole portabella mushroom caps, topped with smoked mozzarella and roasted red pepper, served on a toasted crusty roll....GREAT sandwich!
The garlic, balsamic vinegar and oregano really makes this recipe special, you've got to give this one a try.
Thanks for sharing this recipe Lanni!

This is a great & easy recipe. I am a horrible cook, but this recipe is so simple, it's hard to mess up. I love garlic, so I usually add a little more & some green onions. I added pine nuts to tonight's batch, & they also added a nice flavor.

I spaced out and forgot to add the balsamic vinegar, but the mushrooms turned out so well anyway that I didn't notice my omisson until this morning (I made them yesterday) Funny, especially since I made a trip to the grocery store to get the balsamic vinegar. I'll make these again soon with the vinegar.

So good with grilled steak!  I also add 1/2 thinly sliced onion since I love the flavor of onions & mushrooms together.  Every time my husband fires up the grill for steak (and sometimes burgers - great on them too!), I make these.  We love them!

I'd give it TEN stars if I could.  It is DELICIOUS!  I've made this perhaps 5 times and everyone raves.... Yay!  I also add red wine to the pan for additional flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

this was okay and not bad by any stretch.  but i was expecting something more. i followed Canis Canon's corrected instructions including using 8 oz of mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic. i omitted the olive oil and used half the butter because i find mushrooms provide their own liquid as they cook. ultimately i ended up doubling the oregano and adding some cayenne. i agree with naples34102's review.

I made these to go with shaved steak and cheese sandwiches. They were delicious!! Followed the recipe, but I did not chop up the mushrooms. They were small so I left them whole. Fantastic flavor and so simple! It's a keeper!

I have made this recipe before but forgot to review it. I must say that I changed it a bit. I did not like the flavor that the balsamic vinegar left on them so I changed it a bit. I replaced the vinegar for 1 Tbsp of white wine and 1 Tbsp of chicken broth. The final result was restaurant quality mushrooms!

It was so easy and so delicious! The only changes I made were to make the amount of mushrooms to 200ish grams and then change the time to 20 minutes.

I am so looking forward to this recipe. I am saying this now, before I try it, to say that
we go to a great steak house that serves spinach & mushrooms that sounds like this
flavoring. It is excellent and look forward to trying this.  Thank you Lanni for the base
of the side dish I have been searching for!

What an amazing flavor! I made them this way to pair with sirloin tips in another recipe which called for canned mushrooms. These really enhanced the flavor and were delicious on their own, too.

These were very good and even easier to make!  Minus one star because I feel it could have added a little salt, and less butter/oil - mine came out a bit greasy.

This is not a good combo at all and the recipe has the mushrooms cooking was to long. There was nothing left in the pan.

This recipe was just what my steak needed.  They were so good.   This is the only way i will sauté mushrooms from now on.  The only thing that i changed was i only used 1/2 of the garlic as garlic bothers my husbands stomach.  i don't think he even noticed.

A really nice basic mushroom saute.  I did add another clove of minced garlic (we love garlic) and, after making this a few times, now sprinkle the Balsamic over the mushrooms just before finishing the dish, toss, turn off the heat, and let it sit a minute or so--it keeps the lovely Balsamic flavor from disappearing do to over-cooking.  Dresses up simple grilled ground turkey burgers, steaks, and even fluffs up grilled or sauteed chicken breasts.  Just add a big green tossed salad and it's a great simple meal.  Many thanks.

We enjoyed these mushrooms.  The only thing I did differently was to add only 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. I wasn't sure if my family would like the full amount. Next time I will add the full amount. Will be making these again.

These were nice mushrooms to pair with the ribeyes my boyfriend grilled last night. I added one chopped onion, as well as some extra garlic and italian seasoning. Without the extra spices these would've been a bit bland. I wasn't overly wowed, but these did the job. Thanks!

We weren't very excited about the oregano in this dish.  Was good but we like to put sauteed onions and mushrooms on our steaks that are highly seasoned steaks, therefore, I just sautee the onions until soft in butter and sherry, add the mushrooms, turn off the heat, cover and let the mushrooms 'steam cook' for no longer than 5 minutes so they don't lose their fresh taste by being over cooked.

This recipe was great!  I think the person that didn't like it maybe didn't add any salt.  The recipe doesn't call for salt, but I definitely added a bit.  I actually made this with a mixture of mushrooms and zucchini thinly sliced.  I cooked the zucchini in the microwave for two minutes before I put it in the pan with the mushrooms, since they tend to take a little longer to cook.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks!

This was good, but I think I will take others' advice and double the vinegar for more flavor next time.
