I don't know if the recipe submitter had an issue blending hot liquid in his/her blender but I did. Even half full, it tried to spew all over my kitchen. What I was able to salvage was tasty. Different, but tasty. It's like drinking liquidy banana bread. NOTE: For those who want to blend this, maybe cooking the banana/brown sugar mixture, then blending it with cold milk and warming it after it's blended might be a smarter way to go.

I was expecting this to be good because I love bananas and banana milkshakes but this was...weird.  Not very good.  I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious! I added about double the cinnamon and brown sugar, and I used molasses instead of honey. It still came out great! Overall, I would just add a bit more spices:)

I really like this recipe! I cut it in half and used a banana I had in the freezer (softened a bit in microwave before mixing with brown sugar and browning on stove). It did just fine...even with skim milk. No problems with the blender spewing everywhere either. This would make a very good after dinner drink to take the place of a dessert or to satisfy that late night craving.

Just made this recipe.  As written nothing special and I love bananas.  I added a little hot fudge sauce thinking I love bananas and chocolate even better and it was slightly better but still probably won't make again.

This was different, but I liked it. I looked at the reviews, and did double the honey and cinnamon, definitely recommend doing that. I would make it again.

Good flavor.  Needs better blending than just smooshing. If a  submersible blender was available, I probably would have experienced better texture.

I hate to say that I did not like this. I really thought I would. It was just too thick going down, even using skim milk and adding a little more. I gave it 3 stars because I think the recipe is OK, just not for some taste buds. I added Nutella, which helped a little bit.  It's in the refrigerator now, because I think it will be much better cold. I used a Ninja single serve blender, and just a little of the liquid spurted out when I opened the lid.
