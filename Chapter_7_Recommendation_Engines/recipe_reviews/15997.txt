This pie is extremely tasty, but these directions didn't work for me.  My pie, after baking for 30-35 minutes and setting for *two hours*, was still soupy (the bottom half).  After all night in the refrigerator, it still is. The next time, I'm going to treat it like a pumpkin pie (which has the same consistency when poured into the pie shell) and bake it for 45-55 minutes.

After a lot of searching and trying different sugar pie recipes, i tried this one!  IT'S FANTASTIC!  Better than the last sugar pie i picked up in Quebec.

The taste was great but it was incredibly soupy.  Had to eat it with a spoon.

I give up...I've tried this recipe twice with the same results...a syrupy mess!The flavour was beautiful but like another reviewer, mine was soupy and after hours of being in the fridge never set. WI guess it was still good served over vanilla ice cream...LOL

This was delicious.  However, despite using a 9 inch pie crust, the filling still bubbled over the side and the pie never really set.  But, it's still delicious.  Maybe I'll try making it into a milkshake tomorrow.
