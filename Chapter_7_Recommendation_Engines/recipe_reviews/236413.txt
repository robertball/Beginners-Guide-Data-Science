Having never had anything like this before, we liked it! I used fresh pineapple, but I froze it overnight, so it would be on the slushy side, and that worked well. Hubby and I shared this and we both thought it was refreshing and we both felt 'healthier' after drinking it, lol. I don't think that this is something that I could drink every morning, but it will be good maybe once or twice a week for us. Thanks for sharing. :)

Actually tastes really good! Didnâ€™t know what to expect but the pineapple made the difference I think!

I love it !!! I changed it a bit. I added tumeric, Cayenne pepper, honey. I didn't have cucumber or lemon so I left them out. Next time I will try spinach in it.

Delicioussss! I changed it a bit, with the things I had on the fridge: no lemon, orange juice instead, half of coconut water and half of orange juice, added spinach instead of parsley...and thats it! My family  LOVED IT!
