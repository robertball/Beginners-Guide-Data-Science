It was very good, easy  to make, and easy to substitute with what you had on hand... used thighs, apricot and half and half.  Still was delicious.

Pretty good and definitely on my keep list. Nice and easy to make. I did substitute skim milk for heavy cream and it was still plenty creamy. Next time I might add a little more marmalade to suit my taste.

I really liked this chicken. I cooked the chicken in the crock-pot for about 6 hours, then drained off the fat and most of the juices. I made it gluten free using the  Soup Mix recipe from Irresistibly Gluten Free in place of the campbell's soup and otherwise followed the recipe for the sauce, then poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked it another hour (still in the crock-pot) We ate it over rice. It was loved by the whole family.

My family really loved this dish. The dog AND cat were even snooping around any scaps the kids may have dropped.  I enjoyed the flavor, but would have liked more of a "zip".  I think next time, I might add a bit more mustard to strenthen the flavor.

I thought this was delicious.  I substituted Whole Milk for the heavy cream, and left out the red peppers.  I usually am not a fan of mustard- but I really liked the flavor of the Dijon in this.  It made me reevaluate my stance on mustard.  We shall see.

Nice easy dish. I didn't have heavy cream so I floured the chicken pieces before browning and used whole milk instead of cream. For serving i topped chicken with pine nuts and added finely sliced green onion tops for flavor and color.

This is my favorite recipe :) very easy to make, for my hubby who hates sauce I take his chicken out after being sauteed with the butter, pepper and almonds.  Then I mix in everything else and serve over brown and wild rice.  Do not have to use the heavy whipping cream, can use milk instead.
