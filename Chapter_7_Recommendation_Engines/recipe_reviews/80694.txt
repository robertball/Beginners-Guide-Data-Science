This is a very good rendition of the retaurant soup. To bring it closer to authentic we added more cornstarch until the right thickness. Added chile paste for heat by the quarter teaspoon and individuals added a bit more soy for saltiness. But a good base to start with. Nice!

I've had this recipe in my "meaning to try" box for ages, and I am mad for waiting so long!  This is serious hot and sour soup.  I added chili-garlic paste (about 1 1/2T, Huy Fong brand) instead of the red pepper flakes as I'm afraid mine have lost their "kick," and also tofu and leftover chicken.  This is truly a fantastic base, I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  One thing that particularly impressed me was that the texture is right.----Update---- If you don't have fresh ginger, I really wouldn't substitute powdered ginger for the fresh - it will significantly alter the "bite" fresh ginger brings. Jarred, minced ginger isn't bad - not great, but not bad.  What I do is buy a "hand" of ginger, wrap it in plastic wrap then a freezer bag and freeze it. You can just peel a little bit, grate or slice what you need, then back in the freezer.  It also grates very easily when frozen and keeps forever this way.

This soup is my favorite way to revive leftover Chinese food (as long as it's not breaded, as this would get soggy and gross).  Make the base with the liquids and seasonings, and before you add the vinegar and cornstarch to thicken it up, add your leftover noodles, rice, stir-fried veggies, chicken, beef, whatever.  It's amazing what works in this soup, so experiment around.  Then add thickener, heat through, and serve.  Puts a little variety into eating leftovers, so you don't really feel like you're eating leftovers.

Wow that is beautiful! I made the recipe just as described but doubled the red pepper flakes for some extra heat.  Make sure you chop the chicken very thin.  The texture in the final soup is just like the restaurant. I would also recomend adding the cornstarch mixture prior to drizzling the egg to get that ribbon effect.

Very easy, yummy recipe! I used tofu instead of chicken and it was great. I also substituted rice vinegar for the red wine. This will become a favorite for me.

This is a very tasty soup.  To make it a bit more authentic tasting I doubled the starch for consistency and added 1/4 tsp of white pepper.

Seems like in restaurants this is always made with pork -- but who ever has pork broth?  It worked really, really well, and even my picky daughter loved it.  I made it more hot and more sour, and added tofu, but this is really excellent, and I'll be making it as often as I have the makings for fresh chicken or turkey broth.

Before I wrote this review I had to look over the recipe several times to ensure I had not done anything incorrectly. Not that I thought I had, I just could not understand how neither my girlfriend or myself cared for this recipe given all the great reviews. We really scrutinized this and decided it was the red wine vinegar that gave it a funny taste. Also, I felt that this dish was lacking some sort of a sweet component. I personally would not even consider making this again, but my advice to anyone who really wants to try it is use white vinegar instead of red, add brown sugar and maybe some teriyaki to add a bit of sweetness. Also, I used to work in a restaurant that made a soup similar to this and their recipe added the corn starch mixture before the egg.

I have made this twice in the past week and love it.  The first time I used chicken and the second time shrimp.  Both were excellent.  I also served it over white rice, which was delicious. I love the fact it is quick to make and flavorful.

Delicious. I added an extra cup of broth and an additional tablespoon of vinegar. I also added about a tablespoon of Tabasco and an extra teaspoon of soy sauce. The soup had a great flavor and I really enjoyed it. Will make again. Thanks so much!

In desperation to get rid of a cold, I made my own version of this recipe tonight: since I don't like canned bamboo shoots (and heaven knows there are not fresh in my neck of the woods), I sliced up the stems of bok choy in place of the shoots; I also sliced up the two leaves of bok choy and added them toward the end; only used one chicken breast, but added one extra TB of red wine vinegar; some sriracha sauce at the end put it over the top. I think my soup turned out better than any Chinese restaurant in my little town. Take that you nasty cold!

Very tasty!  I have a similar recipe for egg drop soup that I've used for years.  This is more substantial with the chicken and vegetables.  It had a wonderful smooth, creamy texture that we loved.

I love, love, love this recipe!  Super easy and delicious!  I used a can of tiny pink shrimp from Trader Joes in place of chicken and it was awesome.  I didn't have bamboo shoots but I added shredded carrots in place-YUMMY.  I also increased the cornstarch just to make it a bit thicker (personal preference) Great recipe and definitely worth making

I always try to be as true to the recipe as possible, and I was with this one.  The results were rather bland.  My husband and I are hot and sour soup fans, and I know this is different, but I expected more flavor.    Once I added 1/4 tsp white pepper and a slpash of rice vinegar along with a few shakes of salt; we were pleased with the results.  It's actually a nice easy recipe; I would definitely make it again but I would add the white pepper and extra (rice) vinegar.  I may only use rice vinegar next time and skip the red wine vinegar all together.

This is a lovely versatile recipe and is great for warming you up and fighting off colds! I sometimes add shrimp instead of chicken and, if I have some in, some lemongrass for a citrusy flavour.

This soup is pretty good but still doesnt compare to our favorite resturant. We added ramen noodles and cabbage and upped the spice factor. Overall, I think this recipe is good for an at home fix in lue of a chinese place.

I don't particularly care hot & sour soup in general.  I made this for my boyfriend. He gave it 4 stars & said that it tasted alot like PF Changs... but who knows, maybe he was just being nice. :)  Was certainly easy to make. I used 1tbsp dried cilantro, low sodium soy sauce, & rice vinegar i/o red wine... I covered the soup & boiled for an extra 10 min at the end to bring out the flavors.

It was good. Next time I'll add a bit more cornstarch. This time I left out the chicken as this was more of a starter course. UPDATE: Made again, per the recipe this time. Very good chicken! I had probably slightly less than 2 cups of mushrooms, and I threw in the whole can of bamboo shoots so it was probably more than half a cup. I found '3 slices' of ginger a bit confusing, I ended up using 3 slices that were about 1/4 inch thick, and I minced them before putting in the soup :) My only other comment is that I used a couple dashes of cayenne pepper instead of the chili flakes, since DS and I don't like super spicy stuff. Great recipe, goes great for dinner on a chilly night with some homemade egg rolls!

I did find that I needed to add more soy sauce and a generous amount of Sriracha to bring the flavor to the point where I wanted it. The end product looks nothing like the "main" picture; it looks like the user-submitted pictures (and like the restaurant-style version). Thanks for sharing!

OMG!! My dad and I just made this soup and it is absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Fried up some home made egg rolls to go with it, which took a little bit more time in completing the meal.  All in all though...great soup recipe. Nice change from all the same old soups I always make.

The only change I made was to double the red pepper flakes as another reviewer suggested. It could probably use a full teaspoon, actually. Other than that, this is the one, folks. Never had better! Thanks so much for this recipe, Morphius_Rae!

I love this recipe. I tastes very much like what you find in real asian restaraunts, but even better and obviously home made (which is a good thing). What i like also about it is that you can make it as spicy as you like (i like mine spicy!!) ;) enjoy!

Yum. Yum yum yum.  Made exactly as directed with exception of doing the vinegar/cornstarch mixture before adding the beaten egg.   Devoured.  Oh - and only used 1 chicken breast - which was perfect.  Next time I think we'll pour over steamed rice as hubs only complaint was that he missed his starch.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I'm very spoiled by having the worlds best hot & sour soup at Margaret Kuo's in PA. There is definitely something missing.  A small addition of brown sugar helps cut the sour so the balance between that and sweet is perfect but the depth of flavor is missing. Would love to know what it is that's missing because this recipe is soooooo close to perfect.

Great recipe!  I used beef stock, added more corn starch, used broccoli and water chestnuts because I had them.  I also used rice vinegar which I think is much more authentic, and more than the recipe calls for - the sour is what I find is missing from too many restaurants..  Used chili oil instead of sesame.  Definitely cut the chicken into very thin slivers, not cubes or slices - cut it while it's partially frozen and it's really easy!  And when you cut the chicken this way, add it after corn starch and vinegar and cook for no more than a minute or two, that small it is cooked almost as soon as its added to the mixture.  Finally, I added sriracha to help spice it up and add more flavor.  Great recipe that I'll make again and again!

This was excellent, with one big adjustment and one recommendation.  Adjustment: the red wine vinegar came across too strongly.  It overwhelmed the balance of the broth.  Once we realized what was off-kilter we had a hard time finishing our soup because that is all we could taste.  With a little reduction in quantity of that ingredient, this recipe is definitely one to make.  Recommendation: cut your chicken in smaller pieces than you think.  For a soup, you want the chicken to be small enough to not overwhelm the limited real estate of your spoon.  With those notes, I will share this recipe and make it again.  Thanks!

Very good. I added green chile peppers instead of red flakes. I like fresh pepper more than flakes. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken from another time so I used that. This will be another staple soup recipe in my house and for soup parties. Thanks for the recipe. Very good.

I made this with the last bits of rotisserie chicken leftovers. Fantastic! Just what I needed on a chilly day.

This was very good - didn't use mushrooms or bamboo shoots, don't think I will in the future either. Only had jarred ginger and that was fine but I will use the real stuff in the future. Used a little bit of chili garlic paste which really added some flavor. It was fantastic!

This soup was excellent and my husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  In fact, his response was that the soup was "awesome". I agree with the modifications made by other reviewers.  I upped the chicken broth/stock, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.  I'd like to try the chili paste another time. Also, I substituted rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  I put a little less chicken in it as well.  I think the more green onion the better, so we sprinkled more than the recipe suggested as a garnish. We ended up taking the leftovers in our lunch the next day.

This is the closest restaurant quality hot and sour soup I've found at allrecipes. My wife loves this kind of soup and it's the closest I've come to pleasing her with this type of recipe. The only addition we (my wife helped) made was to add a small amount of cabbage, which we simmered for about an hour or so (while our roast pork was cooking). We served the soup as an opener for the Mandarin Roast Pork recipe, also an allrecipes select recipe. Cilantro has a strong and distinctive taste, so if be sure that you like it before using it as a garnish.

I used tofu instead of chicken & increased the soy sauce to 3tsp (lite). oh & I omitted the bamboo just because I didn't have any... this will be a popular recipe at our house from now on, thanks!!

Good substance to this soup, and healthy.  My only complaint is that it was a little too sour for my tastes.  If I make again I would only add 2 tablespoons of vinegar.

My daughter and I really liked this.  We kicked it up a notch and increased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp - we wanted "hot".  Also, substituted firm tofu for the chicken.  This is a great low fat soup that we will have often!

Excellent recipe!  It tasted very much like the soups at asian restaurants.  I didn't expect it to, not sure what I thought went in those soups, but this seemed right on!  I thought there was too much chicken as this recipe was written, but next time I will probably use tofu anyways.  Thanks!

This was my first time making hot and sour soup - it turned out fantastic!!  I did not use ginger b/c we do not like that flavor...and did not use cilantro.  I used about twice as much sesame oil to coat the chicken - and next time will marinade the chicken overnight to set in the flavor a bit more.  I took the advice of other reviews and used rice vinegar with the corn starch instead of red wine vinegar - but used twice as much cornstarch to get that nice thick consistency like you get from the restaurant hot & sour soup.  My husband LOVED it.  I will definitely make this again!!

We did a few adjustments and LOVED it! We used a package of Extra Firm Tofu instead of chicken to make it more like our local Chinese restaurant. We also added Sriracha to it at the table to make it a bit spicier. We will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I crave hot sour soup when I have a cold.  A bit more meat than I'm used to so I'll cut back next time.  I hate it when people rate a recipe that they've altered but I didn't have all the ingredients and I NEEDED some cold cure.  I used one 8 oz. package of fresh mushrooms and half a package (1 oz.) of wood ear mushrooms which I soaked and sliced.  I used white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I didn't have any bamboo shoots because I'm not fond of them...besides, I didn't have any.  I used 1/2 tsp. of hot pepper flakes because I like spicy and I increased the garlic to I heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic.  Used 3 Tbsp. of cornstarch to make up for added mushroom liquid.  Perfect cold cure! Next time I'll half the amount of chicken in the recipe....and have some green onion on hand to garnish.

Great recipe! Everyone thought it tasted restaurant-quality and couldn't believe it when I told them how easy it was to pull together. I gave it 4 stars because there were a few things I think it was lacking. For one, it definitely needed a bit more kick. I upped the red pepper flakes from 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp and it still wasn't quite right. I think next time I'll add chile paste and hopefully that'll do the trick. Also, I think it needed a 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of salt. Or maybe next time I will just marinate the chicken in some salt and pepper-- as it is in the recipe, it tasted a bit bland compared to the deliciousness of the soup. Overall though, this was great and I can't wait to make it again with these minor tweaks!

I loved this very much! DH not as much. He thought the flavor was really good, but would like it better if it had pasta in it which wouldn't be the same at all but that's how he likes his soup - oh well :) I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the 'optional' cilantro which I didn't have. It wasn't too hot, the 1/4tsp red pepper flakes was the perfect amount in my opinion.

Great soup!  Tastes like it's from a Chinese restaurant!  Added more vinegar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes to make it more sour, thick, and spicy, respectively.  Will definitely make again!

YUM!! this was SO good! MY changes: I used 2 cups chicken STOCK and 1 cup low sodium, fat-free chicken broth; PLUS, 2 bouillon cubes and 1 extra cup of water. I used garlic-infused rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I also added probably 4 Tbsp. red pepper flakes and it still was not spicy enough for my husband. Everything else I followed as directed, but I topped with crispy wonton strips (our store sells them). The FRESH ginger root flavor was SO good!! I'll make this again!

This is pretty good. The only change that I will make is I will add way less Sesame oil. I thought it was way to strong but other than that it was great and super easy. I made this when we were sick with colds and it clears ya right up!

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have red pepper flakes or red wine vinegar BUT I did have red pepper and regular vinegar.  All I did was add extra red pepper and extra regular vinegar and VOILA! it was perfect!  Sure, it didn't have the deep coloring as a result of not using red wine vinegar, but it tasted just as good as the restaurant!

Very yummy soup.  Hubby & I will make it again.   It worked very well as a meal for us two.  I think the kids will enjoy it as well.  Not overly "hot" for them.  However, we are still on the hunt for one that is more like the restraunt version we like.

Excellent soup!  I adjusted, of course, with double the soy, exchanging ginger root for 1 tsp ginger powder, adding grated carrots, water chestnuts and Top Ramen noodles instead of egg.  It was fabulous...although I would suggest doubling the broth portion if you choose to "noodlize".

Very good.  I used already cooked leftover pork loin instead of the chicken.  I left out the mushrooms--not to my taste but tried to follow the rest.  No cilantro or fresh ginger, so I used dry ginger.  It still worked fine.  I love hot and sour soup in restaurants and this was just as good, if not better, bc I can add what I want.  I did add some mixed veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Both my husband and I loved this recipe and it was so easy. I felt like it needed more chicken broth than it called for so I added 2 more cups which didn't seem to detract from the taste. Definitely would make it again.

This was good.  I just had to tinker with the vinegar and red pepper flakes to suit my taste, but all in all, it was good.  I omitted the chicken because I was serving chicken and steamed dumplings.  I will definitely make again. I had some left over and ate it for lunch; it was even better, but not quite as pretty.

Really good starting point.  I made this exactly as written, except I did not add the chicken, as I was serving this with the Asian Chicken Noodle Salad (also from this site).  It was neither hot nor sour enough for us - will increase the hot pepper flakes and vinegar next time.  I also used homemade chicken stock, which is salt-free, and even though we really tend to make our foods low-salt, due to health reasons, I think I will increase the soy sauce to open up the taste buds a bit (maybe an extra tablespoon).  Thanks for the recipe - I will definitely keep this as a starting point for many future meals, as hot and sour soup is one of our favorites, and now we won't have to go to our favorite Chinese restaurant to have it!

Wow, we super love it!  Better than any we had out.  Made 2 changes: a block of tofu instead of chicken and some arame (seaweed) addedin the begining.  My kids said that it was the best soup they ever had.  Oh, my youngest says to add that he ate 3 bowls of it.  Thanks so much!

This was very good... It could have stood to have a little more heat and flavor, so I added a few shakes of soy sauce and some red pepper flakes to the individual servings. I also cooked white rice and put about 1/2 cup in each bowl which added even more substance.  

Very easy, healthy (other than sodium), and delicious. For any complaints that it is too thin, just mix 1 part cornstarch and 1 part water (or broth) and stir into the soup until you reach the desired consistency.

This was a good rendition - The only thing that I might try next time is rice or regular vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. I didn't have bamboo shoots and added more flakes. Otherwise followed the recipe. I will make again.

Used dried shitake slices instead of fresh mushrooms. Also added in some slivered water chestnuts for an extra crunch. Yum!

This was okay. Not at all like the hot and sour soup that I am accustomed to- It's thinner than expected and I could tell that the sour part came from vinegar. Not my favorite recipe, but not terrible.

I made this for my husband who loves hot/sour soup.  He said there were things he loved and things he didn't like but couldn't put his finger on it. I did add more pepper flakes, vinegar, and soy sauce b/c he loves it spicey. He did say there was too much chicken. Thanks for the recipe.

Neither of us were wild about this soup. It was just OK. All I could taste was the red wine vinegar. I left out the mushrooms (maybe that was my problem, but I don't like them), but upped the bamboo shoots to make up for it. I used dried cilantro, but it probably could have used more than what I put in (around a tsp). I used vegetable broth, and I thought the chicken itself was really good. I liked having it instead of pork.

This has got to be one of the best soups I've ever eaten!  Even my picky son likes it.  And it's so easy to make.  I used dried, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms and it turned out just great.

Yummy! This was part of our asian dinner last night and loved by my whole gang. I used hot sauce in lieu of the red pepper flakes, used more vinegar to give it more of the "sour", added green onions and skipped the cilantro. Delish and thanks so much!

I liked this soup very much. It is very easy to make and ready to eat in no time at all. I like vegetables a lot so I added carrot,cabbage,celery and onion. I used lime juice rather than the suggested red wine vinegar.

Made this today for my husband, who awoke at 2:30am with chills and achy joints. It seems to have helped a little. Next time I'll add just a little more red pepper flakes, but the recipe as stated was mild enough for my DS to eat.

Over the past 30 years of my chinese cooking experience, trying to duplicate fantastic hot and sour soup like that served in non-buffet restaurants has been an elusive task - kind of like trying to keep it up after a prostate operation.  But I give the author credit for trying.  The texture is good.  I used tofu instead of chicken to keep it authentic.  While cilantro is used in a lot of Asian cooking, I don't think it helps here - to Mexican.  I threw in a touch of sugar to cut the saltiness down a bit, that didn't do the trick.  Oh well, got to keep searching for the dream ingredient............

It's missing something from my recipe of long ago but still better than any restaurant around here. I  upped the vinegar and added black pepper since m y old recipe called for white pepper. also added cubed  tofu at the last minute with the scallions. Very satisfying on a sick day with a sore throat.

Very good!  I've tried it with tofu - which is how one Asian restaurant here locally serves it.  Also today I had it with chicken.  Excellent!  I mixed the corn starch with the vinegar first - (to soften and introduce the starch to the liquid) then added the resulting mix to the soup, whisking all the while - soup thickened almost immediately!  I then turned the heat down low, still whisking, then added the beaten egg and allowed to simmer for 2-3 minutes to thoroughly cook the egg (and/or chicken) and to allow the corn starch to finish cooking.  Excellent!

This was a great recipe! The flavor was well balanced and it became a complete meal by adding tofu. I make a few minor adjustments after reading the past reviews. I cut the red wine vinegar to 2 TB and cut the cornstarch to 1.5 TB. I added some water chestnuts to give it some crunch and it was the perfect hot & sour soup. You can really experiment with vegetables and meat since you have a great base to work with. This will be in my regular rotation.

This soup is fantastic!  I ended up making 2 batches within a couple days of each other and we ate it all!  This is a great base to start with, and can be done exactly as described and still taste wonderfully.  I actually tweaked this to make it a bit more hot by adding a extra crushed red pepper, a bit of tobasco, and some cayenne.  I also added the red pepper to the chicken while it sat in the sesame seed oil.  I also used baby bella's and cooked up some soba noodles and added them to each individual soup dish before serving.  My first batch turned out outstanding!  The tweaking of the flavor was the hardest part for me, because my second batch didn't turn out quite as phenomenal, but still excellent.

This was barely acceptable. I ended up adding much more vinegar because the taste wasn't right, and some chili paste and extra red pepper flakes. I feel like it started to smell a bit odd when I added the bamboo shoots, so maybe I used a brand with an off taste? Next time I will buy ingredients at the Asian market instead of the co-op! EDIT- At the very end of cooking, I tried adding some oyster sauce as a last resort. It helped. I also added 1/2 tsp salt. Still not perfect, but better.

This was fantastic!  I used cooked cubed chicken as I was in a hurry, and it still turned out great.  Perfect amount of spiciness with a real kick, but not enough to really bother most people.  We didn't care for the flavor of the cilantro garnish with the soup, but it was still fantastic.

I had cooked chicken on hand, so I just used that. I used homemade chicken stock, and probably used almost double the amount of broth. Easy to ,ake and very good.

I like the original version better with Tofu. The chicken is too heavy. Overall, the soup was easy to make and full of flavor.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Not only was it delicious but super easy to make; no hard-to-find ingredients.  I served it before a main course so I skipped the chicken that the recipe called for and bulked it up with bean sprouts.  Amazing!

Pretty good but it's too sour and not enough hot. I think I will use rice vinegar next time instead of the red wine. It also doesn't taste as good the next day. Better to eat it right after it's made.

Yum! I added shrimp AND tofu to make it a meal. And upped the heat using chili paste to make it truly hot. Also, used rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar as per the recommendations of other reviewers.

I tweaked this recipe a little bit so that the indredients were similar to a china bistro we frequent.  I was looking for a recipe with similar indregiendents and this was it.  Thanks for the help!  I used shitake mushrooms, 4 tsp soy sauce, added tofu, omitted red pepper and in its place I used white pepper, 1/3 tsp.  The recipe came out great, even though it was slightly modified.

This tasted like soup you get at a restaurant, delicious.  I did make some changes though:  I left out the chicken, used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and I left out the cilantro.  I also forgot to add the green onions.  This was quick to make and easy too!  I will definitely make this again.  I made it with the Chinese Cabbage Salad I and it was a great, light meal.

I'd rather give this 4 1/2 stars, it was really good! the only changes I made were to sub extra broth for the water, seasoned rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar and an extra cup of mushrooms (I like lots of "stuff" in my soup). It tasted wonderful, and we had to stop ourselves from polishing the pot off in one sitting.

This soup could be a little "hotter" since it is hot and sour soup.  I think next time I make it I will add a few drops of Mongolian Fire Oil found in the Asian section of your grociery store and finely chop the ginger.

Enjoyed this recipe--not nearly hot nor sour enough though, for lovers of authentic H & S soup.  I tweaked it quite a bit and thought it definitely needed cilantro, which I didn't have handy.  I'll definitely make it again.

A great recipe, but I do change a little bit up. I use regular vinegar instead of red wine vinegar-gives a little more bite. I add more red pepper flakes, mince the garlic and grate the ginger to bring out more of its flavor. Try that!

I changed the Soy Sauce qty  from 2 tsp to 2 T. It made the color better and improved the depth of flavor.  Will make again,  substituting tofu for chicken.  I used Shitake mushrooms.

So VERY BLAND.  I didn't add any water and used only chicken broth. 

When all was said and done, after tasting the recipe as it was written (minus  the water), I ended up adding 2 additional teaspoons of red wine vinegar, additional soy sauce, hot chili peppers and chili paste to bring it up to having some flavor.  I probably will not ever make this again.  I gave it  2 stars since I was able to salvage it into something edible with flavor.

I made it per the recipe. Its  good and I'll make it again. Maybe next time if I make something heavier to go with it I'll omit the chicken and have it as an opener.

Delicious soup. I used leftover garlic rotisserie chicken, shiitakes, and a mix of apple cider vinegar and white vinegar. skipped the egg, garlic, onion and shoots. added a tiny fish sauce and Sriracha. I garnished with sesame oil and cilantro, the aroma+flavor combo is truly awesome.

If you would like slightly SWEETER soup, simply add Carrots  (I prefer toothpick size, 1/2C) to step 1.

read many reviews before making.  Realize that depending on where your Asian cuisine is from, you may be having a soup that uses tamarind instead of vinegar.  Different countries have different variations of the "sour" aspect of this soup. I preferred it a bit thicker.  Fresh ginger is wonderful in this. The addition of some shredded carrots added a nice sweetness. Thanks to those who mentioned that. White pepper added nice pepperiness to this. Great recipe depending on what you have experienced as hot and sour soup!!

This soup was delicious.  I adjusted it a little bit to our liking though.  I only added in 1 tsp. of Sesame Oil and since I am a mushroom lover, I added in more mushrooms.  This wasn't very spicy at all, so if someone is looking for it to be more spicy, my suggestion may be to add in more red pepper flakes or some red curry paste.  Thanks MORPHIUS_RAE for sharing.

Delish! Made a 4x size batch. My hubby said we couldnt have bought better asian soup in a restaurant. Loved it. Stayed pretty close to the recipe (as I have never made asian soup and didn't have a clue)....but we did add shrimp to the mix and covered it in sesame oil, just like we did with the chicken. It was really good and surprisingly filling.

This is such a delicious recipe, it is one of our new favourites! It is comfort food, just warms you up, fills you up, and it's delicious fresh flavours of cilantro and chile transport you to an exotic place. Perfect when looking out the window at snow coming down and more on the way. We serve this with potstickers for a full meal.

Although the soup was good and tasty, it had very mild flavor.  Plus I don't remember the hot and sour soups I've had in restaurants having egg in it.  That was called egg drop soup.  This soup had some, and very little at that, sour to it, but no hot to it.  I do not like my hot and sour soup to be too hot and spicy, but this had none to speak of.  I think this is a good soup to introduce kids to.

I made this for my fiancé. He loves traditional hot and sour soup when he is sick. So I decided on something a bit different. I did add a bit of teriyaki and a dash of brown sugar and a bit more of the red pepper flakes. It turned out nicely. A good balance of hot and sour with the hint of sweetness and tang. We loved it!!!

Love love love this recipe!  Super easy to pull together.  I typically double it because it’s just soooo good.  Have made it with chicken, with tofu, and with pork.  As written, it’s excellent although Over time I’ve adapted it a bit for my taste.  I usually add extra soy sauce and extra of the vinegar/corn starch mix.  Try this one, you won’t regret it.

Dreamy!  I used rice wine vinegar, as that what I had.  It gave the soup a slightly sweet taste, which I love--I usually add some sweet & sour sauce to my hot & sour soup at a restaurant, but didn't need to with this recipe. As others, I added the corn starch vinegar mixture before the egg.  I added some white pepper at the end.   I'll be making this repeatedly!

Excellent recipe, except you need to substitute the red wine vinegar with a malted vinegar. Zhenjiang vinegar if you can get it.

I made this without the chicken, but still added about a teaspoon of sesame oil. I also took another reviewer's advice and added more cornstarch to thicken the soup before adding the egg. Delicious, quick and easy!

Not a fan of bamboo shoots, next time...noodles. doubled up the red pepper flakes (we like it hot) and added the whole 32oz of chix stock ,why waste the other 8 ozs.? Used 1 1/2 eggs and an extra Tablespoon of  the corn starch/vinegar mixture to make up for the extra stock. Will definitely have this many more times.

Good recipe, but for me way too much sesame oil.  I find sesame oil to be very potent.  I used about 1/4 teaspoon and this was plenty.  Like another reviewer, I used rice vinegar, but I reduced the amount to about one tablespoon.  Also I added about 1 teaspoon of sugar.

My husband requested me to cook a hot and sour soup and i found this recipe.. It is very tasty and really helps if you have a cold.. Not only my husband and i loved it but also my 9 year old son who likes spicy foods too.. I just added a little amount of salt into the chicken after slicing it, then coat with sesame oil. Let stand for a couple minutes before placing it in the saucepan. Add a pinch of white/black pepper at the end. Will definitely make this again.!

This soup turned out perfect and was great for my cold! I made a couple of changes based off what a majority of people suggested and I am glad I did. This was a easy and quick soup.
1. I was confused with the ginger part of the recipe, it just says three slices? So I went ahead and grated about two tablespoons of ginger and added that to the soup.  I like things spicy and I was sick. So i would suggest starting with one tablespoon and go from there.  
2.  I also doubled the ingredients for the  broth  (everything except the mushrooms, chicken and bamboo shoots). I used rice wine instead of the red wine vinegar. I did find that I had to add additional  extra tablespoon or two.
3. As suggested, I used chili paste and hot red pepper flakes, I like things spicy! 
4. I broiled two chicken breasts and then shredded them. I tossed the chicken in a little bit of the sesame oil (went easy on it to cut some calories), salt and pepper.  I added that to the soup and it was plenty of chicken. 
5. I also used a can of bamboo shoots I bought from the grocery store. The shoots were pre-sliced but next time I would cut them in half as I felt they were too big for the soup. The can was small so I just used the whole thing but next time I would also only add 3/4 of the can as I felt there was too many bamboo shoots. 
6. I also used egg beaters instead of a normal egg, it was all I had on hand and it turned out fine! 

I topped the soup with a little bit of cilantro and green onions, mostly just

Four stars because it needed a little tweaking to be just right. 
I added a package of firm tofu, cubed, and a couple of heaping tablespoons of chili sauce with garlic.  I'd also recommend braving your local Asian food store for a variety of mushrooms (other than the white or brown ones in the supermarket).  The final result was really, really tasty.  I'll be making this again.

Just made soup.  Very disappointed!!  Could not believe so many people  rated it so high.  Needed some more flavor and some heat.  Some chili paste might help.  Have made much better hot and sour soups before.  Will not be making this again.

I didnt have chicken. Added some small colored peppers. Pickled ginger instead of fresh. More garlic cloves. Half braggs and coconut aminos. Shiracha sauce to taste instead of red pepper flakes. Added red onion in soup. Used Rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Basil leaves instead of cilantro. Use what you have!

Very good recipe. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider and it turned out great.

I had no chicken, so I made a vegetarian version of this soup. I had no wine vinegar, so I used a wonderfully rich apple cider vinegar from a health food store. I had no fresh ginger, so I used pickled ginger like you see on a sushi tray. And I added a pack of Udon noodles that I had in my fridge. Despite all those changes and improvisations, it still tasted much like the traditional hot sour soup that I get at every opportunity in Chinese restaurants. I will at some point go back and make the recipe by the book, which will likely be even more delicious, but what I'm most excited about is that I learned the combination of ingredients that gives hot sour soup its characteristic flavor. It's like the old saying of "give a man a fish and feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." Well, I've learned to make hot sour soup for a lifetime....

Delicious and easy. The store didn't have bamboo so I used a can of sliced water chestnuts. Also used oyster mushrooms. So good!

The only change I made was to add an entire 32 oz. container of chicken broth rather than the 3 cups called for in the recipe. It turned out delicious,and way better than the hot and sour soup from the Chinese restaurant down the street that inspired me to look up this recipe in the first place. This will definitely become a regular in my household.

Very, very good! I used low-sodium soy sauce, so I had to put a bit more salt in at the end. I also added a few drops more of soy sauce and vinegar to my bowl. My husband loved it as is. Would definitely make again!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I was actually surprised how good the flavour was.  It was better than expected  considering how easy it was to make. I had no red wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar.  I also used shitakke mushrooms. It rocked! Definite keeper.

This is delicious, better than what I've eaten in restaurants. I crave this every time my sinuses start acting up, it's much better than chicken noodle soup for a cold, in my opinion. I made it exactly to the recipe, didn't add or subtract anything. I've made this several times already and it's high on my favorites list.

Very good and very easy to make! I used the tubes minced garlic and ginger to make it even easier. Should've sliced the chicken thinner but otherwise very tasty.

This tasted quite close to the soup I'm used to getting from Chinese takeout places, but was less greasy and had more depth of flavor.  It did seem to be missing something though, perhaps seaweed?   I'm not really sure.  There are usually a couple of ingredients in hot and sour soup I can't identify.

Also, the measurement given for ginger was confusing for me; it seems imprecise.  I would have said 'slice an inch of ginger root thinly' or 1/2 inch, or whatever the author thought appropriate.  I ended up chopping a half-inch finger of ginger, myself.

If I make it again I may also try putting the sliced chicken in the sesame oil before I do anything else, leaving it in the fridge to marinate while I do everything else.

I made exactly as the recipe said. This was ok. Close to what I eat at the restaurants. I like less chicken then what it called for.  I will make it again, just no chicken just the broth, no bamboo shoots. I guess I want it more "brothy" then "stewy" if that makes sense.

Got a sore throat over the weekend and this really hit the spot!  I added tofu, and added a tablespoon each of vinegar and corn starch to compensate.  I also used a full teaspoon of red pepper flakes for extra spice and a little bit of mirin to give it a slight sweet component (I noticed that some of the other hot and sour soup recipes I looked at before deciding on this one had sugar or mirin in them)   Will definitely be making it again.

I was fighting a bad cold and decided it was time to really take it to the next level, so I used this recipe as my starting point, but made almost all the suggested changes. I exchanged rice wine vinegar for red wine vinegar, thickened it a little more than the recipe suggested, and added the egg at the end.  As well, I used chicken thighs, and added small diced tofu. Wanting some crunch, I added a few handfuls of frozen Asian mixed veggies. I julienned about 5 coins  of ginger and added that as well, and of course, extra red pepper flakes.  It was hot, and it was sour, and it was also a big hit with the family. Will definitely make again.

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe very closely; I just threw in the ingredients without much measuring and skipped a few ingredients that my husband doesn't like.  But it turned out terrific even with my haphazard preparation!  I'll definitely make this again.  I looked at a lot of similar recipes before finding this one, and most of them called for a lot of ingredients that I don't normally buy.  I appreciated the relative simplicity of this soup.

My soup was too thick so I added extra broth- and then had to adjust the spice and vinegar accordingly. Also, I used rice wine vinegar rather than red.

I also did my chicken by popping a few breasts in a slow cooker with some broth (lightly seasoned w/ S&P and garlic powder) on high for 4 hours yesterday. This prep left the chicken beautifully moist and shredded and shortened the prep of the soup. Imma portion and freeze the remaining chicken for other recipes.

The freshness of this recipe is outstanding.

My family loves this soup. I like to use TAMARI  less sodium soy sauce  however (it is non-GMO)  and I find that I need to add salt to heighten the flavors. Delicious! I have been making it every 1-2 weeks since I found the recipe - it is great for a winter warm up.

Followed recipe exactly.  Bland on first day.  A bit more flavorful the second day.  Turned out cloudier than I expected, but my egg pieces turned out pretty small, so maybe I goofed up there.

after living in china for 3 years i was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe as it  is incredibly close to how my chinese family and friends made hot in sour soup in the liaoning province. Truly is excellent. Most americanized chinese restaurants sweeten hot and sour soup and take away that tart and spicy zing which is funny since it is hot and SOUR soup. But Americans tend to like sweet over robust or tang. I  make this exactly as written( as my own recipe from china is basically identical though i always add the vinegar and corn starch before the eggs) as well as times i add just more of most ingredients ( extra garlic, or ginger or mushrooms, add the cilantro and onions in the cooking process, etc. The beauty of chinese food is they almost never measure so you can just dump in and experiment)  And I even make it in a crock pot. To get the chicken very tender i actually cook the whole chicken breasts right in all the ingredients (minus the corn starch, vinegar,and egg)  and once cooked all the way through i pull it out, shred it, and put it back in before adding the final 3 items and the soup s extremely flavorful and wonderfully done. I have made this at least a good 20+ times. thanks for submitting.

I love this recipe b/c it's so darn easy.  I used leftover chicken and canned mushrooms and it still came out great.  Next time I might get some tofu and add it to the recipe. I would recommend replacing the water w/more chicken broth.

I would definitely make this again!  Tastes like restaurant soup.  I did add a half a teaspoon of the chile garlic paste for some added heat for my taste.  I used rice vinegar to soften the effect.

Honestly, this is the best soup I have ever had! I used two cans of chicken broth(about 4 cups) and a little extra soy sauce. I seasoned my chicken with onion powder & garlic pepper! Me and my husband are in love with this.

Just made this for my partner and I to eat for lunch. Delicious! He loved it and I liked it, but next time I'm going to add a bit more spice in it to give it that extra kick. I added shredded carrots and cabbage in it to make it more like the stuff we buy at the Chinese restaurant. Would definitely make it again, but try to cook it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator so that the spices blend better.

Needed to find a recipe so I can avoid going to our local Chinese place once a week. Did everything the way it called for except fresh ginger as I didn't have any and also no chicken. I like some crunch in my soup like how my local place makes it so I added water chestnuts, bean sprouts, baby corn and Chinese cabbage. I also used rice vinegar with just a splash of red wine.

I like this recipe since it is an easy way to get my Chinese take out craving fix. I also like the authentic recipe but those ingredients are hard to find unless I order online, and there are more steps involved.

I added the white pepper, and used tofu instead of chicken. This recipe is definitely a keeper since I have most of the recipes on hand and can put this together quickly.

I loved this recipe but thought the chicken was a little overwhelming.  Will use 1/2 cup in the future.  Husband liked it but also felt it didn't have quite enough broth/ chicken ratio.

I followed this recipe exactly and it tastes nowhere near traditional hot and sour soup.

hot and sour soup is always our family's favorite dish at a nearby restaurant called "Chinese Happiness." my dad and i always joked about kidnapping the  cook and force him/her to make us the soup day and night. but thankfully that wasn't necessary since i found this awesome, amazing, and delicious recipe. few tweaks were made to this recipe because it was practically flawless. i do however recommend adding less egg and using siracha sauce for extra heat. plus more cornstarch as other reviewers commented to have a thicker soup. (after i realized that there was enough red wine vinegar but not enough cornstarch i whisked together slightly salted water and cornstarch.) it might take a long time to make but its so worth it!

I am torn between 3 or 4 stars.  It's good.  It cuts the craving when you want a hot and sour soup.  But, I think it needs more playing to get that more intense flavor,  I had to give it a 4 bc I like it enough to keep trying it.  It's added to my recipe box to definitely make again and really appreciate having a nice starter recipe like this.

This is one of my favorite soups - it is fabulous. I made a slight few changes - increased the garlic, soy sauce and red pepper flakes . Used my favorite rice vinegar instead of the red. Fabulous soup . Doesn't make a lot so I am making it again tomorrow and doubling the broth. Better than the restaurant . So glad I found this recipe. Enjoy !!

This is a good recipe.  I made this recipe as written.   The recipe lacks the spices required for a good Chinese Hot and Sour.  The recipe is neither hot nor sour - If you read the reviews....you will see that most others gave it 4 / 5 stars (because it is good....it is just not hot or sour).....but added additional vinegar and additional pepper of various kinds.  The recipe also needs quite a bit of more salt...either from soy...or possibly sea salt.  I rated the recipe 1 star - because on its own...it does not produce a hot and sour soup.  I'll use the recipe again...as a base...and then work on getting the spices right.

I adore this soup! 
This soup is really versatile. I use sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes, ginger and soy sauce. I add slivered pea pods and carrots - yummmm. OOH, I also use bamboo shoots that come as strips instead of slices. They are almost like noodles. DO NOT try to substitute the red wine vinegar though, trust me. :)

A good, solid recipe. I substituted 1/4 c snap peas and 1/2 c bok choy for the bamboo shoots and found it still tasted great with the extra veggies. My only suggestion would be to add a touch more pepper flakes, since we found it lacked the pop of heat we're used to. Will definitely be making it again!

Made it exactly as listed, except without bamboo shoots.  (The store was out of them.)  I loved it!  The only thing I would change is maybe trying to use half of the sesame oil next time.  I hated the smell of it in my house the next morning, and I didn't care for the taste of it much.

My husband loved this--and he's super picky about hot and sour soup!  I kept everything the same, except I added half the red pepper--spicy food and I don't mix. It had enough kick for me, and I would definitely make this again (with a mild version for me and a hot version for my hubby!).  Next time, I'll look for shiitake mushrooms instead of baby bella mushrooms.  Glad I gave this a go!

Really, we thought it was just 'meh'. It was an OK soup, just not the hot and sour soup I was expecting or wanting.
