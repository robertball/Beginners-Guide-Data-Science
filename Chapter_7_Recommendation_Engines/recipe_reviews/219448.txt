I added a half teaspoon of garlic powder and onion powder when I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper. Right before serving, I added a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. I DID take the recipe submitter's suggestion and serve this over whole wheat pasta (with garlic green beans on the side). NO leftovers. My family ate every single bite of this dish. Very good. Noone could tell that this was "lighter", which tickled me.

This recipe turned out well. I did add about half a tsp garlic powder and I changed it up a bit. I coated the beef with the flour I would have used for making the gravy. the beef browned up nicely. I returned the beef to the pan and added the liquid. It thickened right up with less mess and no lumps.

WOW!! This was really tasty and really easy to make!! The only thing I did different was I added garlic (yeah, no vampires in my house! lol) and I didn't use the white wine but only because I didn't have any on hand! I also used wafer steaks because it's what I had on hand (not the pressed steak-ums)... My teenagers and I have doing Weight Watchers+, hubby refused til he ate this! :D Nice job on the healthy version!!

This recipe was okay.  Did not look as appetizing as the picture.  Taste was decent.  In all fairness, I think I keep trying different beef stroganoff recipes hoping to like beef stroganoff, when perhaps there's no recipe that will make me like it.

Mix more than 1/4cup of flour and beef broth.  It turns to a gooey paste that adds a lot of time to making the sauce.  Try at least 3/4 of a cup for a better rue

A good solid beef stroganoff.  We cooked the mushrooms, removed from pan, then added the beef, which we sliced thinner than recommended. Seasoned that with salt and pepper, then added the flour. Once the beef started to brown, added the onions. When the beef was almost done, crushed in a large garlic clove and a little bit of rosemary, marjoram, and thyme.  Poured in the wine and substituted 1C water for the beef broth.  Forgot the mustard. Probably used a little extra sour cream.  Very enjoyable.

I did this in a slow cooker, on Low for about 6-7 hours, adding the sour cream during the final hour. I didn't bother to brown the beef chunks and I left out the mushrooms - because my wife's not a fan of them - but I added two handfuls of baby carrots at the start. It was great !

Scrumptious!!! So glad I spotted this in the Allrecipes Magazine - made it for my son and a couple of his college buddies - they all went for third helpings. Made it a "gluten free" meal by using GF flour and served it with Chef Johns mashed potatoes - yum yum! No white wine? Try red - it was just as good!

This is the same recipe as Beef Stroganoff III, with some healthy changes.  Use this one instead of original going forward.

This was so good.  No one could the that it was a light version.  I bought meat for stew at the grocery store that was already cut up so it saved me a step.  I made every thing as stated but instead of simmering meat in the pan for one hour I placed it in the slow cooker for a couple hours.  I love that this is a healthier option recipe!

I made this as healthy as I could--even using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  Used thinly sliced sirloin and low-fat sour cream--served over whole wheat egg noodles.  It was delicious and the family loved it!  Will make again.

Very good but did have to add some herbs and spices to give it more flavour - oregano, paprika, garlic powder.  And I agree with others that next time I would dredge the meat in flour rather than mixing the flour and beef stock.

This has become one of me and my boyfriends favourite meals. The kids really like it too. I add green pepper slices for last 20 min of cooking. I used pork tenderloin once too instead of beef and it was still do good.  Thank you for creating this

I made it just as the recipe was written.  When I make it again, I will add about a teaspoon of chopped garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of parsley to give it just a little more flavor.  Was easy and delicious!

Dredged the meat in flour instead of mixing it with the broth, added basil, oregano, and some smoked paprika, garlic and onion powder, used 2% greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and tossed with a box of whole wheat rotini. Very pleased with the result.

I changed the recipe to suit what i had on hand.  I used ground beef.  I added the noodles to the pan and just added extra beef broth and cooked until done.  I liked using one pot to complete the meal.

This was so easy to make and was delicious. The only change I made was I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder before serving to give it a little extra flavor. It was a hit and is very WW friendly!
