These were surprisingly really good!!! I think I 'd like mine in a pita pocket topped with yogurt or hummus. I made a few slight changes in that I left out the cheese used oats instead of what germ and ended up adding a few Tbs of flour to tighten it up. I cooked them in a nonstick skillet with a little olive oil. I will gladly make more of these. Oh and because I didn't have a hot pepper I made no substitutions. Still good!!

Had to add another egg to this to even get any binding to it. Took three (3) days to make it. Flavor was flat had to use about 1/3 cup of a special blend of spices to even give it a hint of flavor. Better use of this recipe with spices adjusted would be as a dip in a casserole or possibly more in a stew/chili.

I gave this recipe a rating of three only because the burgers were rather difficult to keep together. In fact, one time I ditched the idea of making burgers altogether and used the mixture as a sambousa filling. Those were tasty! Despite the failures of this recipe, I have now made them four times tweaking the ingredients each time. I've added an extra egg the last three attempts and resorted to using two spatulas to flip them to try keeping the burgers in one piece start to finish. Next time, I will add a few tablespoons of flour like another review suggested.

The reason I keep coming back to this recipe is the flavor as I am in the habit of cooking lentils with dried onion (1/2 t) and red chili flakes (1 t). This makes a world of difference for the flavor. I even keep a bowl of lentils like this in the refrigerator as they add a little protein pop of spice to salads.

Also, I make them for my vegetation daughter, who eats one at a time, so I freeze the rest between sheets of wax paper. I reheat them from their frozen state in a small glass pan given a light coating of nonstick cooking spray. Then, I pop it in a 400 degree oven for about 15 to 20 minutes - until heated through. This allows for them to be heated without disturbing them in the process affording them less of a chance to fall apart.
