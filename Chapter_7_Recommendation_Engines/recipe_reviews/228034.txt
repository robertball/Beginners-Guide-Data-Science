This was good. I really liked a vegan version of risotto. I will definitely make some adjustments in method next time, though. I'll add the tomatoes after toasting the rice. It never toasted properly because the tomato left too much liquid. Also, I'll add some chickpeas when instructed but reserve a few for the end of cooking. They become soft giving the risotto a creamy texture like when adding cheese, but I wanted a few solid ones too.  We like things spicy so the amount of spices was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

Super easy and fun way to make vegetarian risotto.  It uses ingredients found easily in the kitchen without having to run out and I love using all these spices.

I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika in this and it was still REALLY spicy. There should be some sort of warning about that. It had a really good flavor but was just too spicy for me. Also I needed an extra cup of broth to finish cooking the rice, which was annoying because I was using bullion and had to boil more water to make it. Make sure you have extra broth when you make this.

This was my first time making or even tasting risotto so I'm not sure if it turned out the way it was supposed to. I do know that the flavours were delicious. I think next time I'll add a bit of chicken; I think that would turn out good. This was so tasty I think I'll serve it to my dinner guests next week.
