I used reduced fat whipped cream cheese an organic Granny Smith apple for this sandwich. Instead of using an aluminum non-stick skillet, I used my cast iron skillet. I heated the skillet, added a pat of butter and fried away. To say that my kids liked this would be an understatement. My son asked for a second sandwich.

Oh my, this is scrumptious.  Had this for breakfast today with fruit salad.  We probably would have been satisified with half a sandwich (rather than a whole) because it is so rich and decadent.  The apple lends a nice crunch to this sweet and wonderful combination of ingredients.  Don't change a thing on this, and do use the cinnamon-raisin bread as I think it's important.  Now I have to find something else to make with the leftover dulce de leche (other than eating it by the spoonful out of the can).

I just happen to have had inherited a big can of dulce de leche from someone who wasn't thrilled with it.  I've made this without raisin bread (because I didn't have any), but this was still very delicious.  I've made this as dessert for a brunch using croissants  That was really good!!

This is a really great recipe. My 3 yr old LOVED it. It's not super sweet.  Just right. Will definitely make it again. Someone wrote that they just used regular bread.  Definitely have to use the cinnamon raisin bread because that was what made it perfect

we used goat dulce de leche which gives it a slight goat cheese taste. I wasn't a huge fan and would make it with regular, but our friends loved it with the goats milk version.

My girlfriend had me over for brunch yesterday and she prepared this. it BLEW ME AWAY! it is so delish! She used maple bread instead of raisen bread and used caramel syrup for the dulce de leche - she said it was easier to just buy it. this was the best thing ever - i will be making this for guests for years to come in my kitchen. surprising and unique and very individual. BRILLIANT! EASY!!!

This was really good.  I will definitely make again, but the next time I make, I will use a more tart apple like a granny smith.  There's so much sweet that it needs to be balanced out with some tart.

I just learned about La Lechera dulce de leche last week for another recipe. Well I can eat that stuff with a spoon. So I started searching for recipes to use the left over. When I first read the title of the recipe I thought no way. Then I read cream cheese and dulce de leche. And turns out this is the yummiest thing I have eaten. Iâ€™m hooked. I made exactly as recipe called for. I will be making again!

If you have leftover dulce de leche and are looking for a way to use it up, you need to be making these sandwiches.

I love all the ingredients in this individually, and was sure based on the reviews putting them together would be fantastic, but it was just okay.  Not bad, but not anything to write home about.  I'd rather just dip the apples in the dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture than go to the trouble of grilling the sandwich.  But even then, the mixture wasn't that great. The cream cheese added nothing to the dulce de leche, and the dulce took the bite out of the cream cheese.
