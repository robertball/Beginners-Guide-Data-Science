8/2/2000 
This is a great recipe!!!
I have been making this cake
since Mar-99 and I get requests
all the time for it again and again.
It works as a bundt, layer, or even a 
sheet cake!
I've made it with chardonnay and chablis
but really, really good with merlot!!!!
Also great, plain with powdered sugar,
great with fresh berries, whipped cream.
I make it with a cream cheese frosting
that people love.
8 oz cream cheese
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 tsp. vanilla
about 4 cups powdered sugar
   - more or less to make creamy and
      smooth
Mix with electric mixer for about
   2 minutes
AWESOME!
14-Nov-2003
Still making this cake and people love it!

Delicious! Used ultra moist yellow cake mix, as someone suggested. Also cut down the nutmeg to 3/4 teaspoon and 1/4-1/2 cinnamon.  Also used Pam first in Bundt pan, then buttered it and dusted pan with cinnamon sugar.  Used Chardonnay from a box -- so not the best quality, but it was FABULOUS.  Will definitely make again!

Later review: I've made this cake about a half dozen times since first trying it in late December.  I have come across with a wonderful change.  I had pecan chips (the really fine, almost powdered ones).  I mixed those with cinnamon sugar. Coated the inside of the Bundt pan with butter, then dusted the pan with the cinnamon sugar/pecan mix.  This gives the cake such a wonderful crunchy coating, with the divine moist cake inside.  Hey, definitely worth a 15 star rating, if possible!

A cake with wine...now that caught my eye!  Ok, let me start by saying I love to make my own cakes from scratch, however...this bundt cake was fantastic with a little semi-homemade kick!  The cake was so moist and flavorful!  The only thing I changed with the recipe was to reduce the oil by 1/4 cup and replaced it with applesauce, and I followed other reviewers advice and dusted my bundt pan with cinnamon/sugar.  I also made a cream cheese and white chocolate drizzle to go over the top...the entire cake was gone before I knew it!

This cake is by far one of the best cakes I've made in a while. My husband asked me to make a cake for his mom's birthday (no pressure) and he loved this cake. He is the biggest critic when it comes to what I make and he actually had three slices of it at the party. We were disappointed when my mother-in-law didn't offer to take the leftover cake home which she usually does! I dusted the bundt cake with cinnamon and sugar and it worked out great. Letting the cake cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes allowed the cake to release itself from the pan with no breaks. I also dusted the cake with powdered sugar and made the cream cheese frosting that was suggested by another reviewer. The cream cheese frosting was used sparingly on top of the cake with a little coming down the sides. In the center of the bundt cake I placed a small cup with a little water and made a flower arrangement to dress up the cake a little more. This recipe is foolproof as long as you follow the directions. Thanks for sharing!

This is a very tasty cake, let the cake sit, it needs hours or preferably overnight, before it's at it's best.  The bake time was perfect.  I really liked the taste of this cake, thanks so much for the recipe, this is so easy and one of my favorites.

I used yellow cake mix, butterscotch pudding and cream sherry because I didn't have all the ingredients in the recipe. I also added about 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. Delicious!!! I will definitely make this recipe again. =]

This cake was so moist. I made it for my friend's birthday, and everyone loved it. I used 1 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and I thought 1tsp would have been enough. I used two 9-inch round pans instead of a bundt pan. I baked them for 20 minutes and I think 17-18 minutes would have been enough.

My mother-in-law used to make "wine cake" often, for special occasions or  Sunday get togethers. There were never leftovers. I wanted to know how she made it, but it was a family secret not to be shared. After 25 years and the invention of computers and the "internet", YAHOO, i entered "wine cake" in the browser and low and behold, here is a recipe thats  near close to what she baked. I spoke with my sister-in-law the other night about the recipe, she has offered to give it to me, but it seems its the same as this one. One difference, I doubled this batch and used one box white cake mix and one box yellow cake mix. I also used 3/4 applesauce and topped off with the veggie oil.  I used chardonnay, although any dry wine will do.  Make sure you use INSTANT pudding. I think the vanilla pudding mix gives it that added moistness.  I couldn't find the exact frosting she made, so I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II and added 2 tsp white wine. After frosting the cake, I sprinkled chopped walnuts for a great finish.  The family loved it and requests are pouring in for Christmas. Thanks Again!!

I DESPISE box cake mixes, this one is different.  I use a yellow cake mix, which seems to give the cake more body AND I use sherry wine instead of white wine, which also gives the cake more flavor. I sprinkle a GENEROUS amount of powdered sugar on top.  My guests devour this cake and always ask for the recipe.

Really moist and delicious! I used merlot instead of white wine. The cake mix looked really weird, but when the cake was cooked it was beautiful. Everybody liked the nutmeg...I probably used a little extra. I topped this cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

As recommended by someone, I substituted a box of red velvet cake and a five oz pkg of chocolate pudding and 3/4 cup raspberry wine, and kept everything else the same and it was fantastic! It was 10x better than the version made with white cake. Frosted it with cream cheese frosting. Served with a sweet Italian sparkling wine. It was to die for!

Oh this cake is so delicious.  Can't believe it comes out of a box... I used Flore de Moscato 2009 wine from Trader Joes. I must confess I did add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg because I just adore it.  The baked cake was so light and I loved the nutmeg, spicy taste.

This cake is the BEST for a quick, simple and tasty choice!  I also make a chocolate version using red wine and ground ginger with chocolate cake and pudding - delish!

I prefer the confectioner's sugar on the chocolate cake and I coat the inside of the baking pan with colored sugar or holiday candy pieces (the type from a shaker in the baking aisle) for the vanilla version.  This one is always a winner when I make it - everyone LOVES it!

Just WOW!  This was amazing.  I made this for my sister-law's birthday party.  First people were intrigued because it was made with wine and after they tasted it they couldn't stop raving about how good it was!  I followed the recipe but frosted it with a homemade buttercream frosting and decorated it with sliced strawberries, blackberries and sliced almonds.  And it was EASY to make.

My mom actually found this recipe and askeed me to make it one christmas, and we have been making it every year since! I always "flour" the pan with the cinnamon sugar mixture because it makes the outside a little crunchy and sweet. This cake is really good with whipped cream and raspberries!

I have never tried a wine cake, but it sounded interesting. This is very good! I'm eating some right now. I used cooking spray in the pan and used the cinnamon-sugar. This gave a nice crispy crust on it. (I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, just because we love cinnamon.) The crunchy crust in combination with the soft, tender center was a nice contrast. The wine added a very slight background flavor. This recipe could be the springboard for many variations. It really does scream for the addition of fruit & sauce of any favorite flavor, and I would highly recommend planning on adding it.

This was really yummy and everyone liked it!  I had to make a few changes to suite what I had on here.  Here are the changes/additions that I made: 1/2c applesauce + 1/4c canola oil, to replace the whole 3/4c of oil, added about a cup of chopped strawberries, used some old white zin. that was in the fridge, used super moist white cherry chip cake mix, used 3.5oz package of pudding because it's all I had, and left out nutmeg because I forgot it (LOL).

This recipe was made by my mom since I was a little girl. It was always at our family events, now that I am grown up I see what all the fuss was about. The smell reminds me of my mom and my family. Made small cupcakes for my sister for her wedding honeymoon to have a little with coffee every day in Maui. she loved it like I do.

We loved this cake!  Admittedly I only had a small box of the vanilla pudding on hand and used that, but I used the kind of cake mix that already had pudding in it so maybe that came out even.  The texture of this wonderful cake was just as good as the great flavor!  This will definitely go into my preferred recipe box!

This was quite a good cake. I'm still searching for a good wine to use with it. I didn't like the merlot (it was not the best flavour combination; or at least it wasn't my preference) and white zinfandel is too mild. White cooking wine didn't do it for me either. Will keep trying new wines until I find the right one. Great base recipe!

Just a note - the pudding is equal to 2 x 4 serving packages of pudding. I messed that up the first time. It wasn't bad, but not the same flavour.

I've been making this cake forever! we usually add poppy seeds and leave out the nutmeg. Lately, I've been adding 8 oz of sour cream which makes it really moist. For the wine I used sherry. I made the mistake of taking it out at 45 minutes once and it was not very good. Make sure to leave it in for 50 min even if the outside is getting brown. Next time I'm going to make it lowfat by using apple sauce. I think it will taste the same but I won't feel so guilty!

I've been using this recipe for over a year now, and it's fantastic.  It's the best when you use a chocolate cake mix with port for the wine.......absolutely delicious!

Delish!  I dusted the bundt pan with cinnamon and sugar before adding the batter and, although I served this after dinner, it would make a great coffee cake as well.

Very good. My husband as well as my coworkers love this cake! I used Japanese plum wine instead of white wine (because it was too late to get one from grocery store) and the result was exceptional.

I made this for my husband's birthday and it turned out SPECTACULAR!  I actually made it in two 9" round pans and for the topping, got some store-bought vanilla icing, mixed in some champagne extract to cut the store-bought taste and decorated it with fresh berries.  I served it at a little party and everyone RAVED about it- it's so flavorful and moist.  I will be using this recipe over and over again!

Easy to make, tastes good and is very moist. I like the fact that you can add various fruits or just dust it with powdered sugar and it makes a nice presentation with a small amount of work.

This cake was easy and delicious! I used two 9" round pans and the bake time was 26-28 minutes. I used a very sweet white table wine, not sure if anything else would have been sweet enough for a traditional birthday cake. Frosted it with butter cream frosting and topped with red raspberries. It turned out beautifully. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I used Merlot and the cinn/sugar mixture suggested by others ... delicious! The taste is perfect, light and airy, super-moist, and not quite detectable as a wine flavor. Sprinkled cinn/sugar/powdered sugar mixture on top too. Would probably be really good with a bit of vanilla glaze. yummm!

This was a really good cake.  The cinnamon sugar on the crust was a nice touch, and the cake went well with berries and sugar or cream.  I used a white merlot.

The cake was great!  I did take into consideration other reviews and didn't add as much nutmeg and did let is sit for a couple of hours.  I used white wine and it was very moist and flavorful.  I made a double batch and used two 9x13 aluminum pans.  One was for a bake sale and it was beautiful dusted with powdered sugar and lined with the cinnamon & sugar mixture, the other with cocoa - both wonderful.  My family is asking for it again!

This was excellent!  It baked up so tall, and was so moist.  The cinnamon-sugar coating was a definite bonus.  I did think it had a 'holiday' flavor with the nutmeg, so I think I would serve it only at Christmas or Thanksgiving.  Surprisingly, I found it was very similar in taste to the 'Eggnog Quick Bread' on this site, which I bake during the holidays.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great cake and so easy!  I dusted the sides of the cake with cinnamon and sugar, as suggested, and I also frosted the top of the cake with white chocolate almond icing and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.  It made a really pretty birthday cake for my sister, I put a fresh flower in the middle and candles all around.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious just as written! The aroma while baking was a bit out of the ordinary, but not unpleasant. The cake was super moist and even better two days after making it. There are lots of possibilities for variation and tweaks too. Thanks for sharing.

This was easy to throw together and turned out very moist.  I chose to "flour" my pan with the cinnamon-sugar as suggested in the foonote.  It has a delicate flavor.  My husband ate his slice with strawberry jam, but I can see this going well with strawberries in a lite syrup.

I made two batches of cupcakes for a friend's birthday party.  One batch with merlot and topped with white icing and one batch with white zin and topped with pink cream cheese frosting.  Everyone loved them and had to try both flavors and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

Except for the nutmeg, my Grandmother has always made this cake! It's amazing, it does taste best the day after it is baked. This is my favorite cake ever. ( Oh, you can use red wine but your cake will turn out greenish in color, the taste is still amazing!) We use Mascoto white wine.

The cake is in the oven now, so not sure but it looks great!  Just wish they had specified which "white" wine to use!  I thought it might be sweet so got a sweet red thinking it would be pink but it's gray!  But as long as it's great tasting, that's all that matters since it's for an anniversary party that the baker at the last minute backed out of!

My friend gave me a recipe that's very similar to this one. Used yellow cake mix, 2/3 cup of wine and oil. Had red wine and it worked just fine. Fresh ground nutmeg is better, I use a whole nutmeg but less can work too. The cinnamon sugar dusting on the pan makes for a nice light crust, and I think it helps keep the cake from sticking in the pan. Everyone I know who has tried this cake loves it.

Fantastic dessert. I always get rave reviews whenever I make it. I often take it pot luck meals. Easy and tasty. Make sure you mix for the full 5 minutes and it will come out perfect. I dust the pan with chocolate power as someone else suggested and it turns out great.

I love this cake.  This is a family favorite.  Instead of white wine I use a raspberry rhubarb wine (that is homemade).  The flavor is awesome.  The last time I made it I used two circular pie plates and filled it with raspberry preserves.  To top it off I used a cream cheese frosting.  Everyone loved it.

After reading the other reviews, I used merlot instead of white wine.  It tasted great and the nutmeg really gives it that extra kick.  One problem; using red wine kind of turns the cake a grey color.  It didn't effect the taste though.

This cake was SO good! I used Chardonnay, and covered it in homemade cream cheese frosting. Even family members who won't usually eat dessert had a piece after others went for seconds!

I used yellow mix and 3 oz pudding with sweet sherry. I also added a sherry glaze on top mixing some wine with powdered sugar and a bit of butter. I think the flavor is better if you let this sit a day or two before devouring.

This is a great recipe! I made it with a white late-harvest dessert wine since I didn't have any regular white wine.  Now I'd like to try it with a red velvet mix and a red dessert wine.

This was just ok.  It still tasted a lot like regular white cake mix even after doubling the nutmeg.  The wine added some moisture, but it was barely detectable.  The white cake mix and vanilla pudding were definitely the primary flavors in this cake.

Good, I took the advice of other reviews and added merlot - the taste was great, although the color (pasty grey) left something to be desired.  Also, I didn't have nutmeg, so I use cinnamon instead.  I served it at a dinner party with raspberry sorbet, and it seemed to be a hit.

Very moist, good texture, good baking instructions.  I used the cin./sugar sugestion as well and served w/ fresh berries.  Personally I think it could use more spices/flavor.  Good, easy, quick recipe to thr. together for a quick brunch. Maybe I'll try it with merlot as others have sugested. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I only had 1/2 cup of wine, so I subsitituted 1/4 cup gingerale.  I added 1 tsp vanilla too.  I cooked the recipe as cupcakes and topped with the Cool Whipped Frosting on this site.  They were delicious!  My whole family LOVED them.

Great for the holidays! Amazingly moist and fragrant. I made a glaze by combining 1/2 cup wine and 1 and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. Pour half of the glaze when the cake is still warm and then the other half when it has cooled. Then I dusted with powdered sugar.

I made this recipe with yellow cake mix instead of white because I like it better.  I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg because I wanted only a hint of it.  I felt a whole teaspoon was too much.  For the wine I used a Riesling because its my favorite.  I served it with whip cream and strawberries (Riesling goes great with strawberries).  My sister who doesn't even like sweets even loved it.  She described is as a sophisticated shortcake with the hint of nutmeg and wine flavor.  I will continue to make this again and again because its easy, tastes amazing, and very affordable.

I started using this recipe about a year ago for one of my clients who wanted something different for her husband's birthday.  I use white chocolate pudding mix (when I can find it in my rural grocery store) and rose wine.  Baked in rounds and then frosted with a white chocolate buttercream.  It's the only cake she orders now!

Yum! I made these for christmas as gifts for all my friends. Everyone loved them. Its super moist and the flavor is amazing. Ive used different wines and it always tastes great. Ive used different cake mixes: yellow, white, french vanilla, etc. The cinnamon and sugar is good, my husband loves it that way, but I prefer it plain or with powdered sugar.

This cake was easy, and came out moist and wonderful. It was a big hit at the 4th of July dinner at work. I used Merlot and  it left a nice subtle flavor but not overpowering. Highly recommended.

It’s a good base, but definitely needs a wine glaze. It needs more wine flavor. As is, it’s a little bland.

This is a wonderful cake!  I made it for my husband and me and it didn't last long. The only change I made was to use a half teaspoon of nutmeg and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I found that one bottle out of a wine four pack was exactly 3/4 cup of wine. I used Pinot Grigio and it gave the cake a delicious flavor.I didn't have a Bundt pain, so I used a 9*13 pan and baked it for 45 minutes. When the cake was slightly cool, a poured a glaze of powdered sugar, milk and lemon over the top of the cake. The light citrus taste of the glaze added nicely to the taste of the cake. I can't wait to make the cake for a family get together next month.

Very surprising how much everyone liked it!  I usually bake from scratch but was in a hurry and wanted something easy.  I  made it in a bundt ring using  French Vanilla cake mix with vanilla pudding and a muscato wine the first time, dusting it with vanilla sugar. The second time I used a Lemon cake mix and didn't enjoy it nearly as much.  The original recipe was perfect!

This was a wonderful cake!  After reading the reviews I made changes in regards to the applesauce and cinnamon. Also dusted the side with cinnamon and sugar.     Does it matter what size bundt pan you use?

Moist, delicious, simple, and versatile -- any cake mix/pudding flavor combo you can dream up (and they'll all be great). Oft-requested, outstanding cake.

I made this for an office birthday and everyone loved it. I used some leftover prosecco that was several days old and therefore flat- it was great! I did not have nutmeg so used cardamom and a little cinnamon. I dusted the greased bundt pan with cinnamon sugar as suggested. Everyone raved about how moist and delicious this cake was! I served it with wine soaked strawberries (used up the prosecco) from a recipe on this site- excellent!

It is really a winner. I used chardonnay from a box since I didn't want to buy a bottle. I did cut the nutmeg to half following one of the suggestions from a review however, next time I will not use it, I'm just not a fan of nutmeg.

Great recipe! I made it "as instructed", although the I used a 9 x 13 pan, as I was taking it to a BBQ and wanted a cover on it. I used a Chardonnay wine. After greasing pan, I "floured" it with the cinnamon and sugar mixture instead of flour, and when cake cooled, I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top. Moist and delicious!

I didn't care for this cake recipe.  My sister and her family loved it tho. They said it was very moist and had just the right amount of a nutmeg flavor.

This came out really good! I used a chardonnay, but I think I might try a merit next time, see what the difference is. I did drizzle it with a vanilla glaze as well and that made it nice and moist.

I made it according to directions and no one, including myself cared for it. We used whipped cream for topping & that made it ok to eat, but basically I will not be making this again.

It was good but felt like it was missing that something special... Can't put my finger on it. I drizzled a cream cheese icing over it which was yummy.

All I can say is "WOW!"!  Best cake I ever made.  I used a sweet red table wine and pistachio pudding which is what I had on hand.  Made it as directed otherwise.  Throw it  in a sugar lined bundt pan, poked holes in it when done and drizzled a powdered sugar and 1/2 and 1/2 glaze on top.

Love this old fashioned cake.  I made for a wine tasting just how described except replaced white cake mix with yellow cake mix which I feel makes for a richer taste.  Next time I will add a full cup of wine & additional 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg for more enhanced flavor.
Everyone raved about this cake & I love it as it is not super sweet .  For a finishing touch, I mixed some powdered sugar with a small amount of ground nutmeg and dusted it on top of the cake.

Make this cake for a bake sale at work and it sold out quickly!!!  People thought it was home made!!!!  

Quick and easy and great when you don't have the time or skill to make something harder.....

The stars are for the recipe potential, b/c mine did turn out good, it's just that I couldn't get past the alcohol.  Word to the wise...or just those that have more common sense:  only a limited amount of the alcohol bakes off.  So let's just say someone made the recipe with moonshine (no judging, but that's what I had in the house)...it's like taking cake shots, folks.  In fact, I should go to the local college and sell these to the frats.

I stayed true to the original recipe because I was curious to see what the basic one was supposed to be like.  (Playing it safe.)   It was a tremendous hit at a birthday party.  It did shrink up after removing from the over though.  I don't know if this was normal for this recipe, but there was about an inch margin on each side.   To hide the margin, I spread whipped cream on like frosting.   Wonderful.   I can't wait to experiment with other ingredients.  Bailies??  Mmmmm...

I made this last year for Christmas and because the store was out of vanilla pudding, I substituted French Vanilla pudding, and it was awesome. I am afraid not to make it without French Vanilla!  Everyone loved it.

I love the way the wine makes the cake taste.  I feel that it also makes it lighter.  I like to use this for cakes even if it's not a bundt.

This cake disappeared quickly!  I agree with some of the other posters that all you can taste is the cake mix.  But that's when it's warm.  When it's cold the wine flavor really does come out.  This is a keeper for sure!
