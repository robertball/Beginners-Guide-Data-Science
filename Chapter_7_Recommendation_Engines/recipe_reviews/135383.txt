Very good. I used a combination of frozen berries(cranberries, blackberries and strawberries) and used low-fat vanilla yogurt. My kids gulped this down.

Berry good! I used a mix of frozen strawberries and blueberries. I also froze my banana. I didn't have strawberry yogurt, so I subbed non-fat vanilla yogurt and instead of the sugar added a bit of low sugar strawberry preserves. What a thick, frosty treat that's really good and good for you too!

What a perfect, healthy, refreshing snack. Very thick too! Some changes I made:
1) Halved the recipe (it was just for me)
2) Substituted plain yogurt with no added sugar for the strawberry yogurt
3) Substituted 2 packets Splenda for the sugar.

If I could have found no sugar added strawberry yogurt I would have used that, but I could only find plain. It still tasted wonderful!

We loved this recipe!!!  For variations we used different frozen fruits and decided we always liked the banana added to it.  We NEVER added the sugar and the kids loved it!

Hubs is the big smoothie drinker in this house (I could take 'em or leave 'em, personally) so what matters with a smoothie recipe around here is if it scores with HIM. Now while I was making this, I thought to myself that this would be "just another smoothie," and one that was heavy on the banana flavor at that. Surprisingly, according to Hubs that turned out not to be the case.  He said this was a nice medley of flavors, no one flavor dominating.  Why the 4-stars then, I asked him.  Well, he said, it was good, and not heavy on any one flavor, but still a strong, fruity flavor didn't pop out at you.  (Hmmm, he gave it 4-stars, but that sounds like an average, 3-star smoothie to me...)

The first time I made this I was ready to give it a 3, but that was mostly because it had too strong a banana flavor which I do not like - I want the banana more subtle.  But, I had used an over-ripe banana and had left out the sugar, and thought it only fair to make it again.  So I used a less ripe banana and did add the sugar, which unlike many people, I did think was necessary.  (And I'm no sugar fanatic by any means.  I think it had more to do with flavor than sweetening.)  I'm sure it depends on the selected berries somewhat, and how good the fruit is.  I used blueberries, strawberries, blackberries and raspberries.  (Less strawberries the second time because I also like the strawberry flavor more subtle.)  I don't like the seeds of black/raspberries, so I've started straining them.  This can be quite thick and the only good way to strain them is put them and all the milk only in the blender, strain, and then add everything else.

Good recipe, but you absolutely do not need the extra sugar.  Fruit is sweet enough and adding yogurt adds sweetness as well.

Very quick to throw together and it was an excellent breakfast drink. Came out a very pretty color with wild blueberries, raspberries and banana.

I thought this was a delicious, healthy treat. I used skim milk, and really liked the way the frozen fruit chilled the drink. It is a pretty color, too!

Yummy, easy, quick, healthy, refreshing, great way to use up left over bananas!  I just make a few batches and keep it in the fridge (since there is no ice in the recipe).  Great for a quick breakfast in the morning if you are getting ready fast.

Yay for healthy things that taste good! I made one alteration - I used Greek plain yogurt, which gave it a really nice consistency. Next time I'll definitely try strawberry yogurt though. This probably doesn't need the added sugar unless you use plain yogurt.

Wonderful smoothie recipe.  Mine varied from the original with frozen strawberries, an orange, and Activia Light Vanilla yogurt, milk, and no sugar.  It was fantastic and made enough for me to have a smoothie for breakfast the next day.

A delicious, refreshing smoothie!  I didn't have strawberry yogurt, just plain so I used that.  I didn't use the sugar so my smoothie was likely a little less sweet than the original smoothie with the strawberry yogurt and sugar.  It was still great!  My kids loved it too, bonus.

Absolutely delicious. The perfect mix, that doesn't need the optional sugar at all. Served for a quick and light supper with BLTs. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I've tried a recipe similar to this and it's awesome. Yeah, it has a lot of seeds, but what do you expect, especially if you use stuff like strawberries and raspberries? Personally,I love it with the seeds! Reduce the milk by half and add 1/4c. of apple juice. Gives it a bit of an extra sweet kick! Yummy!

I thought this tasted okay. I did use the calculate button to change it to 2 servings. I didn't have mixed berries, so I just used blueberries. I didn't have a problem with the taste, but more from the texture. It was kind of thick and goopy. I am not sure why because I make smoothies all of the time. I think I could have added some ice cubes, like I usually do, to give it a more frothy texture like I like. It will fill me up well this morning though. TY

Been meaning to rate this for some time, but keep forgetting to.  I made this a while back when friends came over fro brunch on Sunday.  It was a big hit with everyone and of course, had to give them all the recipe to take home. I will definitely make it again in the future.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

Very good smoothie! Servings are small, so for breakfast, I made two servings of this smoothie for myself, added flaxseed meal, and used the whole banana (for 2 servings, it should have been half a banana). It turned out great!

I used low-fat milk, no sugar and vanilla yogurt because that is what I had on hand. It was still very good.

This recipe is fantastic -- easy to make and my daughter, who is a picky breakfast eater, loves it.  The only thing I would say is that the sugar is unnecessary.

A very creamy, thick smoothie. I halved the recipe, used non-fat milk and yogurt, and used a little bit of Splenda instead of the sugar.

We've made this a few times now and the kids love it! They beg for this for dessert. The first time we used frozen strawberries and two bananas (no sugar). Tonight we used frozen raspberries, one banana, and vanilla yogurt (we were out of strawberry), and again no sugar. I'm not a big fan of smoothies myself, but I love that the kids are raving over this healthy dessert!

This is awesome! My kids absolutely love it! I left out the sugar, used frozen strawberries, and made it once with strawberry yogurt and once with strawberry banana yogurt. It came out great both times. My kids actually thought they were drinking shakes! Little did they know it was good for them!!! I will be making these again and again!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I tried this recipe and it was delicious. With most smoothie recipes that I find and make, the banana takes over the recipe, and I'm not that big of a fan of bananas, but with this one it was wonderful. It was perfect, and not too much of anything. If you're trying to go healthy, I would suggest no sugar because it doesn't really change the flavor. The fruits add enough sweetness. Everything about this recipe is awesome, and I totally recommend it!

i used Greek yogurt, almond milk, and did not put in the sugar. nothing makes me feel healthy like making a fresh smoothie in my own kitchen! a good base recipe to have on hand. our blender is not high powered, and after breaking the blade on a black and decker after only doing one smoothie with frozen berries (blender was supposed to be able to crush ice), i defrost anything frozen just in case!

I made this recipe as written, except I used plain yogurt instead of strawberry.  The taste was good (definitely needed the sugar because of the plain yogurt) but it was just a little bit runny for my tastes...I prefer smoothies a little thicker.

I generally include 2 or 3 bananas and substituted almond milk for dairy milk. I am not a fan of almond milk for drinking or on cereal but it is good for baking and cooking. I sometimes drink it for breakfast and sometimes as a desert. I prefer water during the day.

I'm so grateful to the original poster for putting this recipe up! I have struggled to make a good smoothie for far too long, and this one is perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness and a good consistency. I did substitute and put my own little twist on it. I used Greek vanilla yogurt, unsweetened almond milk, and a frozen berry blend that included cherries, strawberries, and raspberries. I added about a teaspoon of honey, although I don't think I would have missed it if I didn't. I also used a scoop of Green Superfood mix. My biggest takeaway is to use the same amount of liquid as frozen ingredients. It makes it the right consistency. Now I feel brave enough to experiment with other smoothies since I've got one great one under my belt!

I made this and other than using vanilla yogurt I made the rest of the recipe as it calls for. I have to say that it was good enough that my youngest daughter and me drank almost the entire thing as soon as it was made.

This is a delicious, creamy, not too thick glass of goodness!  I did not add the sugar, but did add in 1-1/2-tbsp of pumpkin seed protein powder.  Thank you  for sharing.

It tasted great, and consistency was smooth. Not exactly a morning smoothie every day though. Everything else was all good.

A very simple and good recipes for breakfast. For  a healthier smoothie, i used almond milk instead of regular milk, greek yogurt , and added a spoon of rolled oats and chia seeds. I changed the measurements to suit one serving and added 1/4 cup of water as i thought it was not enough liquids but it did give it a watery taste at the end.  Next time i will probably try it with ice instead.

I made this with mixed berries (had strawberries in it), a banana, vanilla almond milk, and lactaid vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt (can't have lactose for the time being) and it was so good. Once I can have dairy I will replace with yogurt.

Cut the recipe in half, still made about 16 oz. Used frozen mixed fruit and added 1/2scoop vanilla protein powder. No sugar. Will be making it again, yum.
