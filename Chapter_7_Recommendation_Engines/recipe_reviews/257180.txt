Thanks Cindy,

We like salmon and really liked the tomato-addition of  Cindy's recipe. I only made one small change. I used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and chilies for added spice. Jack

I was looking for a new way to cook salmon and this fit the bill. It is very simple to put together and quite tasty.  I'm sure to make it again.
