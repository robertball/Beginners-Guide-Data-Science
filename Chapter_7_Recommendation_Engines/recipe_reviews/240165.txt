This definitely lives up to it's name with great flavor. I used Spanish peanuts. The sugar butter combination melted at around 10 - 12 minutes and the parchment paper made for an easy cleanup. I will be making this again and I'll add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I had no idea that sugar did that if you got it hot enough!  For the few minutes before it started melting, I was worried that I'd read the ingredients wrong and was about to end up with a bunch of burnt sugar, but it turned out great in the end.  Absolutely fascinating.

This recipe turned out exactly as I had hoped. I did not add the salt since I used salted peanuts. And I would recommend that you warm the peanuts before adding them to the melted sugar or the sugar will cool too quickly and cause it to mound up instead of spread out in your pan. I made this as a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law and I know she will love it.

I changed the recipe slightly. I doubled it, but used 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, I also substituted pecans for peanuts. The directions didn't say how long our what temp to cook to, so I used my candy thermometer and cooked it to 302° for hard crack. 
Delicious!

I substituted the white sugar for brown and it was delicious. Just a pity my friends like it so much.

I loved it! I do not have corn syrup so it was perfect! I did not need to refrigerate it to make it brittle, it became brittle itself, I made it five times!

I reckon it was great ya gota be quick when it's time to put the nuts in and spread out. You could vary with chocolate chips spread on top when it is laid out, chilly or vanilla extract. Thankyou Love4 for the recipe.!!

Made my first ever peanut brittle and it was more than amazing! Such a great recipe and very easy to follow, although for people who haven't cooked it yet it would be nice if you could add that you would have to wait awhile for the sugar and butter to start melting as I wasn't sure if I was to put more butter in the mixture and it was quite solid. I read a couple of reviews and saw that I just had to wait! Works really well, tastes awesome! Tastes even better with Salted Caramel Ice Cream ;)

First time making peanut brittle from any recipe. I was skeptical when I started melting the sugar and salt, nothing was happening.  I thought I had missed an ingredient but after reading I saw that it takes about 10-12 mins.  after putting in the peanuts and trying to pour it on to the parchment paper it stuck in a big pile.  It was still hot, so I put another piece of parchment over it and rolled it with a rolling in.  Worked like a charm.  I had to taste the spoon I stirred with and it was soooo good.  Can't wait for it to cool to crack it and give some to hubby.  Yum  I didn't change one thing, and would make it again.  But double it next time..

I didn’t know it was this easy to make perfect peanut brittle. It truly was simple and quick. It turned out perfectly. I must say at end move quickly to get it spread in a pan because it hardens quickly. This can be made ahead or in a pinch.

Delicious!  Set up really fast so next time I think I will heat up the peanuts to give me a little more time to get it poured out.

Wow! Talk about easy! I've tried to make peanut brittle a bunch of times with little success. This worked. Just make sure that the sugar is completely melted--no grainy bits--before you add the peanuts. It hardened very fast, before I was able to spread it out. That did not mean it did not get eaten pretty darn fast. Try it; you'll be amazed.

Delicious, I made it just as the recipe says. You have to move fast after you add the peanuts. I have made it without the butter , just caramelize the sugar and add the peanuts,  it taste the same.

Make a double batch and was hard to get into the pan, only went half way across and isn't "brittle " just gooey even after being in the fridge all day. Very disappointed
