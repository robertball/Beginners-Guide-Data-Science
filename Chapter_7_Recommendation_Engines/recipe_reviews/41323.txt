Esy to make - makes a ton - tastes great.  What more could you ask for?  Although my husband maintains that it's horrifying to "abuse" a good bratwurst this way - he ate as much as anyone!

This recipe is a winner.  First I halved the recipe.  I cooked this recipe in my slowcooker (4 qt).  I fried the sausage links beforehand, and instead of using canned beans, I soaked one cup of navy beans overnight.  Cooked on slow for about 8 hours.

Very good!  I made this about a couple of weeks ago.  I added two cans of Rotel tomatoes and several green chili peppers.  The family is asking for it again.  I like to eat mine over buttered cornbread.

Made one substitution - swapped out the beans for potatoes.  Boiled them most of the way and simply added them to the pot at the final step.  It was a bit salty for me, but I blame this on the canned broth that I bought.  Will go with low sodium next time.

The biggest compliment for the recipe.  My wife turned her nose up at the bratwurst that I cooked on the grill the day before.  I made the stew with the leftover bratwurst, had two bowls (I liked it :) ) then I went upstairs to put the baby to bed.  I came back downstairs and my wife had a silly smile on her face.  I looked at the pot of stew and it was demolished - she confessed that she had 2 bowls of it herself.  She asked when I could make it again.

Hearty and delicious.  I was short one brat, so I used a pound of ground turkey in this stew.  It was excellent.  I prefer more broth than the recipe called for, so I added another 1/2 can of chicken broth.

This is the winner in my family.  I usually serve brats with sauerkrat(which noone likes but me) and this was a great change.  Only thing I was asked to do differently is to add more brats!!  GREAT recipe thanks!

wow, does this recipe makes a savory stew! i followed the directions as written, first simmering my johnsonville original bratwurst in beer then frying them to a dark brown. the stew's broth stays thin until you add the brats & beans then it thickens up nicely. mmmmm, so tasty! i made this dish ahead of time because it's our out of town dinner two nights from now. i expect the stew to get even better with age & will serve it with warm crusty bread. thanks taste of home!

This was a lot lighter than I thought it would be--the name "bratwurst stew" made me think of a really heavy meal, but it was surprisingly light!  I doubled the carrots and celery and didn't have thyme so I didn't add that, but it turned out just fine!  I can't wait until summer so I can add fresh zucchini!!!

This recipe was so easy, and tasted fantastic!! I used apple brats which are hand made by a local butcher which gave it a little different flavor. Will be sure to use again.

I just had to review this recipe simply because of how easy to prepare and tasty it turned out to be. I followed the recipe as written but added one final touch at the end to add some thickness...I mashed some of the beans with a potato masher.  I thought that made it just the right consistency.  What a great way to use up extra bratwurst!

Pretty good. Followed the recipe exactly except I used kielbasa instead of brats. I prefer the Lentil and Smoked Sausage Soup from this site though. I doubled the sausage and my kids really gobbled it up. Good stuff on a cold winter's day!

Quick, easy, delicious!  I have used pre-cut veggies from the grocer to make it even quicker.  Everyone always loves it!

I put this on my Thanksgiving weekend menu plan as a break from poultry.  I thought my German in-laws would like this stew.  Well, there was a LOT of unexpected hesitation, but it turned out to be a winner!
I bought good quality brats and removed the skin.  Next time I will also slice them lengthwise for smaller mouths.  I set a brown mustard on the table & some folks dipped their brats.
I also opted for potatoes over beans (per another reviewer's suggestion).  There was A LOT of concern about digestive gas.  Turned out not to be a problem.

This was great up until the last step. The beans were very overpowering. Next time we'll definitely leave them out, and probably dice up the bratwurst.

We really liked this, I added a pack of spicy hot dogs to it for me and my husband.  It warmed us up on a cool day!  I added an extra can of broth to make the soup go further also!  I'll make this again.

This was great!  We use 1/2 the beans, but besides that, don't change anything else. We use Johnsonville German Brats and they add a great flavor.  I don't really messure the cabbage when I make it anymore, and sometimes it turns out a little low on liquid.  It makes a lot but, it reheats great!

This stew is really delicious.  There's plenty of ingredients going on in this one, so the broth, which isn't thickened as much as I prefer, doesn't hurt it one bit. Very nice, different kind of stew. Definitely will make it again.

Delicious! I used pork and cheese brats, and added a small diced potato. I'm not too sure about the northern beans though - there's something about the texture. Still, this is a great recipe. Will make again!
