I have done this for years with the grandkids!  For a variation, I dye the ramen noodles green and pile the octopi on top of the :sea weed!  turn the cooked hot dogs upside down and they are flowers! ( for the girls)

Simple and fun to do, I'd suggest the next time I do this, I use low sodium hot dogs and chicken broth. But the recipe did just what it said it would. The hot dogs curled right up and I thought that was fantastic! My local commissary didn't have a very good quality of fresh chives. I was totally disappointed. But for a small package at just under 3 dollars. I would have needed 2 to almost 3 containers of fresh chives to follow the recipe exactly, and I would have had it not been for the commissary's selection. However, I had to go with green onions and at 34 cents a bundle and using 2, and chopping only. the greens and saving the other part for another use. This recipe was made very inexpensively. What a great budget recipe. Hot dogs-- .89cents, Chicken Broth(Dollar Store)-- $2.50, Green Onions-- .68...total $4.07 WOW right? Less then 51 cents a serving. I'll make this again for sure. My kids loved how the whole hot dog trick turned into an octopus. A BIG THANKS!!!

My kids love this! I just boiled the hot dog octopi in plain water & served on plates with ketchup.  The kids loved pulling apart the legs & dipping them one at a time. So fun.

I am rating the excellence of the idea of cutting the hotdog and cooking it to make an octopus! All four of my children from 11 to 3 thought this was so cute and loved watching it curl in the water. Thank you!
