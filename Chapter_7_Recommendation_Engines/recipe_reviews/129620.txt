Really easy to make and has great taste.  I changed it a bit.  I like a more peanut buttery taste so I added about 1/3 of the whipped cream to the pb mix instead of the half it calls for.  Came out very yummy!  Loved by everyone who ate it.  Thanks

This was so easy to make and was loved by all that got a slice. I did lighten it up a bit by using reduced fat grahm cracker crust, light cool whip, 1% milk, reduced fat peanut butter and sugar free fudge topping. No one could even tell the difference. I will be making this many times to come.

Very good, and very easy.  I used a chocolate crust and added some chopped up peanut butter cups to the filling.  Went over great, everyone loved it.

This pie was great! I did make a few changes. I made the crust from store bought cookie dough with mini Reese's. Just break off one row of the cookies and mash the rest into a pie plate and bake for 12-14 minutes at 350. I only used one layer of the chocolate fudge. I was a bit dissapointed in the Cool Whip topping. It got a bit runny and flat, but everything tasted great! Everyone loved this pie. My mom said it was the best pie she ever had.

This was not only easy but delicious.  I used fat free cool whip and skim milk and it was still rich and addictive. I put mine in the freezer for a few hours before serving which made it easy to cut and serve. Truly YummY!!

This pie is delicious and super easy to make!  It was a big hit at a recent party we had.  I had to slice a piece and hide it in the fridge for my husband!  If you need a no fuss dessert that gets rave reviews, make this pie!

This pie is easy and delicious. I didn't have the chocolate fudge topping but sprinkled chocolate chips on top.
