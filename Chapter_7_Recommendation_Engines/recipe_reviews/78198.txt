Really great flavor and very easy.  My only changes was to use pancetta instead of bacon, added some Italian seasoning to the chicken.  Next time I will probably only use half a jar of the sauce since it was a little much for only 1/2 lb of pasta.

This dish is fabulous!!  Love the kick of the spicy sauce and the chili peppers.  Plus, having chicken, shrimp and bacon in the same dish is a great combination.  This also works well with Asiago cheese instead of the Parm.

This was good and spicy!  Very tasty and satisfying -reminded me of a jambalaya over pasta.

Oh, this is sooo DELICIOUS!!!! This made plenty of sauce for a whole pound of pasta, so I went with that. I did use about 1 pound of chicken and almost 1 pound of shrimp (just to use it up). After I poured in the sauce, I thought it was a bit too thick, so I added a little water to the jar, closed it and shook it to 'clean' it out, and poured that in too. The flavors are really, REALLY good, and everything seems to compliment each other nicely! This is definitly gonna be a repeat recipe in our house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Simple and delicious - everybody loves it!  We left the shrimp out for the folks who don't care for it - good either way.

I liked it, but next time I would either cook the bacon alone until crispier, or use pancetta.  Also needs some other spices.  But I will make again.
