This is a great recipe and a wonderful way to use up the summer bounty of fresh veggies as almost any vegetable can be subbed for the zucchini, squash and eggplant.  A suggestion to others who try this recipe ~ use more of the pesto sauce and don't crowd the mix of vegetables, otherwise the tart will not crisp and you lose the flakiness of the pastry sheets.  I have made it twice since receiving the recipe and it has been wonderful each time - perfect appetizer paired with a refreshing glass of Sangria poolside.  Definitely a keeper!!!

My husband likes everything and would probably have rated this tart 4 stars.  I have a few quibbles.  First, I found that it look much longer to roast the vegetables in the oven to get them soft and slightly browned than called for.  Second, while I used a regular size eggplant (not baby) and a large zucchini, I did not use any summer squash.  I did add a few mushroom chunks.  Even so, I almost could not fit the vegetables on the tart pastry in a single layer.  Last, I used the amount of pesto recommended and thought it needed more.  I could hardly taste it on the finished baked tart.  The end product looked terrific, but I would recommend alternating the veggies as they are laid out on the tart, not in rows.  That way, when it is cut, each piece gets a sampling of each vegetable.  I liked it well enough to try again with more pesto and maybe some additional other seasonings.

I didn't have a squash on hand so I tossed in a little sauteed kale because I wanted more veggies. Even without the squash I had WAYYYY too many veggies for such a little pastry!
I also thought there wasn't enough of the goat cheese but I was out so I added some fresh mozzarella as well. I had a very strong goat cheese though so I feel like they balanced really well.
Lastly, I threw the red peppers on before baking it along with some kalamata olives.
I served it with some spicy lentil soup and it made a great meal! I would definitely make this again!

This was delicious, and you can add just about any veggie you want on top of it. We added some broccoli.

This is awesome! I used Humboldt Fog cheese (which is extra yummy). I spread the cheese in a neat layer over the pesto and under the veggies. I like "wet" pizzas with consistent flavor better than dry. I steamed the veggies for faster cooking, then sprinkled veggies with seasoning to make up for the lack of roasted flavor. Also, I used a different brad of puff pastry. Maybe it was smaller, but on mine, I could only fit the yellow squash and 1/2 the zucchini on it, and only about 1/3 of the roasted red pepper on top. I'll have to make it again with the remaining veggies!

Like everything, I had to tweak this.  First, I'm reducing my sodium and so I didn't want to use jar pesto.  So I decided to use herd de provence and hazelnut oil in place of the pesto.  I also made 6 individual tarts, I think I have 3" tart tins.  It used most of both pastry sheets.  I used 1 yellow squash and 2 baby eggplant from a garden.  I used 2 fresh garlic cloves, but jarred roasted red peppers.  I sauteed the veggies in hazelnut oil, then finished with 2T of Herbs de Provence and 1T more hazelnut oil.  I put the goat cheese on the bottom, followed by veggies, and topped with red pepper strips, and halved grape tomatoes.  Then I baked according to instructions.

It was great! (so good, I ate 2 for dinner!).  Wish it looked a little...idk, prettier? for the amount of work I put in making it.  Still, not a terrible effort, considering I don't bake much.  I'll absolutely make it again.
