Wonderful Flavor. Before adding the cashews, I separated the batch into 4th. I made 1 plain, 1 with chrush candy canes, 1 with mini M&M's, and of course 1 with the cashews. (My favorite)
Sweeter than I remember from my family recipies. 
I did not use parchment paper. I very lightly sprayed an old cookie sheet and as long as I only let the cookies set for a minute or two after coming out of the oven, they stayed together fine. Leaving them on too long, they do stick and may break due to being fradgile cookies.

My husband declared these AWESOME!  I personally thought they were a bit sweet even after using salted cashews.  They are very good however.  I've never made meringues before but had 5 egg whites to do something with and this recipe fit the bill especially since I had cashews!  I think I may be making these again!  Thanks!

This recipe is great!  So easy to follow.  The meringues are slightly crisp, with a airy, buttery center filled with cashews. Not too sweet, either, although I used lightly salted nuts so that might have offset the sweetness. This recipe filled 3 industrial-size baking sheets with about 30-50 cookies per sheet.  They did crack while baking, so I'm wondering if there is a way to prevent that...
The best part about these is that you can eat several of them without too much guilt :)
