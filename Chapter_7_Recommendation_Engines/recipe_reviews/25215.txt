This bread is pretty good.  I didn't have frosted wheat, so I used shredded wheat instead.  I also put in more than 1 cup of shredded wheat.  It does taste pretty healthy that way; I'm sure it would taste a lot sweeter with the frosted wheat.  In my opinion, not as good plain as some other breads I've made.  It's good for sandwiches except it crumbles a bit, so not for hefty sandwiches.  Maybe for grilled cheese, actually.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. It had a little sweetness from the cereal and it was dense and filling. It is so good in the toaster. I'll definitely make it again
