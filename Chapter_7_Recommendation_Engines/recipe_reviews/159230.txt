I don't usually like the peanut sauce at Thai restaurants -- it's too sweet for my personal tastes. But this recipe caught my eye, and it was so amazingly delicious! The balance of flavors was perfect. I can't wait to make this again, and I'd love to try the sauce on grilled veggies and grilled tofu. Yum!

This is similar to dishes I've had called "Rama Thai", "Royal Thai", and "Phraram Long Song" (Meat in Peanut Sauce).  I think this version is a little too thick and peanut buttery.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of water.  Next time I will only use 1/3 cup of peanut butter and add a 14 oz. can of coconut milk, and 1/8 cup water.  I thought it needed a little more flavor, so I used 2 1/2 tbls. soy sauce, 2 1/2 tbls. rice vinegar, 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (to add some kick), and 1/8 tsp. sesame oil.  I thought it was just a bit too sweet, so next time I'll only add 2 tbls. of sugar (esp. if I use coconut milk).  I like my tofu crispy, so I drained and cut extra firm tofu into 2"x1" pieces, salted the cubes and deep fried them in 175F degree veg. oil for 3 minutes until golden.  I wilted the spinach in a couple tsps. of oil in a skillet and drained it in a collander.  I also added a 10 oz. can of mock duck.  Top the dish with some chopped peanuts and it's perfect.  YUM!!

This was an EXCELLENT, restaurant-quality recipe! I sliced & baked my tofu (400 degrees, 20 min on one side, 10 on the other) and followed the recipe exactly - it was delicious.  Next time I'll reduce the rice by half - we had way too much left over.

Mmmmmm this was delicious. I took advice from another review and sauteed the tofu and spinach in sesame oil instead of baking and steaming. The peanut sauce was perfect!!

It's okay, but probably won't make again. Neither of us cared for the blend of flavors. On the plus side, I had my best day since developing arthritis after eating this.

Fantastic! This is my favorite Thai recipe, and I order it all the time at restaurants. This recipe is restaurant quality. I made it with chicken- cubed, seasoned with salt and pepper, dredged in flour then sauteed in a little butter. Amazing. Favorite meal right now. Can't wait for the left overs!!

This was soo good!  I took the advice and scaled down the peanut butter to 1/4 cup for 2 servings.  Also, I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce as well.  Four stars because, as written, it would have been too much peanut butter and not enough tang!  It was a great guide to an awesome meal, though!!  This is a keeper for me!

This was just okay. The sauce was great in the pot, but once I put it over the rice and tofu, for some reason it lost a lot of its pizzazz. To be fair, I did make some of the changes suggested by others. I added a can of coconut milk and ginger. We ended up adding lime juice, soy sauce, and peanuts to our plates and this helped. I will probably make the sauce again and use it as a base. Still definitely worth the try

5 star for being simple inexpensive and very tasty. I'm amazed. I did not put as much peanut butter and I used corn starch to thicken sauce. I also used snow peas I lieu of  spinach w/ is
very expensive at this time . I'll definitely make this again.

This was simply awesome. I used Better N Peanut Butter from Trader Joes which has a lot less fat and it was delish.

Oh...My...Gosh...It *IS* like the restaurant dish I love and crave! Followed the recipe more or less with the ingredients I had (and didn't) and followed  MamaNicole's suggestion for baking the tofu and it was FABulous!!!  The secret's in the sauce. Mmm...

This was absolutely delicious. We decided to make it a more veggie packed dish, so we added snow peas, red pepper, onion and mushrooms. I also fried the tofu on the stove top in a little of the sauce so it would absorb the flavor. thumbs up.

Sorry, but I thought the peanut butter was really overpowering and not at all that appetizing.

This was soooo yummy! I used Jasmine rice and instead of steaming the tofu and spinach, I sauteed them in a mixture of sesame oil and peanut oil. I sprinkled a few tablespoons of flour in the pan when I added the tofu to give it some crisp. I sauteed the tofu for about 10 minutes on medium heat until it browned, then added a bit more oil, then the spinach. This makes great leftovers!

I made this recipe because I had all the ingredients. The sauce was too peanut buttery. It also seemed to be pourable so I did not add the extra 1/4 cups of water, but after keeping the left overs the sauce got too thick. It tasted fine, but I would not make it again.

Yum yum and YUM!  I didn't have the green onion and only had fresh tofu, but this tastes GREAT.  I gently sauteed the tofu beforehand.

My husband and I both love Thai food, so we were excited about trying this recipe out.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I just left out the red pepper flakes since my husband doesn't like spicy foods) After having this, neither of us are interested in making it again.  The peanut sauce was a little strong, as some others have mentioned, and we werent big on the mixture of the spinach with the dish either.  The amount of tofu didn't seem enough; there was a lot more spinach than tofu when it was all cooked up.

Well, I put the sauce over chicken with broccoli and mixed peppers. And decided to chop some peanuts and sprinkle over the top to garnish. But the main part of the recipe was really the sauce. And man was the sauce fantastic! Might try the tofu and spinich at some point (couldn't last night cause my mom won't eat tofu) but this was the best peanut sauce I've ever had. My family raved!

Really good and the kids liked it too. I used chicken instead of tofu and sautéed the chicken with garlic first and when the chicken was almost done, I added one chopped yellow pepper, asparagus, 1/2 an onion and broccoli and cooked all of that. I made the peanut sauce on the side and added it to the chicken/veggie mix. The peanut sauce wasn't too sweet but I used mostly natural peanut butter.

Very yummy but a tad sweet for my taste. Next time I'll either use freshly ground peanut butter and/or cut back on the white sugar. Will try the sesame oil saute as well. Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe.

Made this for dinner. Took the advise of most and cut down on the peanut butter, because of this adjustment I had to add cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I followed the tofu and spinach directions but next time I may take the suggestion to bake it. I would of liked a firm texture. Over all I thought this was a great dish to make when u need to mix up the usual weekday dinner schedule. 
I will say it is a tasty dish !!!

I'm rating this for 5 stars because this is the first time I've EVER made anything like this and a) have my husband actually try it and b) have my husband like it AND compliment it.  I made a few changes, but nothing major - I used agave nectar instead of sugar in the sauce and left out the green onions because I didn't have any.  I sauteed my tofu in some garlic and garlic-infused olive oil before I added sliced white onion, sliced bell peppers, and the spinach.  I like this because I CAN use up a lot of vegetables for this dish and I can vary it to fit what I have in my fridge.  I thought the sauce was great, also.  A nice consistency (I didn't have to add any water to mine, but you easily could if you wanted it a bit thinner.) I also used brown rice instead of white, based on pantry contents.  
Overall, VERY pleased, especially when my husband nodded and said, "Huh.  This is really good, hon."  SUCCESS!

This was good, but a little too strong in peanut flavor for my taste, i felt like the peanut flavor overwhelmed the rest of the flavors (and I didn't even use the full amount of peanut butter).  I added extra pepper too, I wanted it spicier.

This was amazing! I pan fried the tofu, added carrots and broccoli, and my fiance couldn't get enough.  The sauce was great, even though I didnt have regular vinegar, I added extra rice vinegar as well as some spices and it still turned out perfect.

i agree, this peanut sauce is delightful!! i scaled back a wee bit on the peanut butter and the sugar and added chopped fresh ginger...it was perfect over tofu, onions, spinach, and broccoli. i will be making versions featuring different veggies/proteins a lot, and maybe even trying it with noodles!

couldn't get any better and my hubby is picky!  We like things alittle spicier so I would add some cayenne next time.  Baking the tofu was also great - 400 for 40 mins (salted/peppered).

Trust the ratio of peanut sauce to spinach & tofu, my friends. That sauce will make you want to be the swimming angel, floating inside of a salty, sweet and nutty world. I doubled the dish (way too much rice though), and made it for five friends -- who all asked for the recipe.

This recipe gets 5 stars for the peanut sauce, alone! It was fantastic! I personally added about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes as I like my peanut sauce to have quite a kick, but I followed the rest of the recipe to a  T and it was wonderful. Can't wait to enjoy the leftover sauce with some celery sticks!

This was good. It was not too sweet, but it felt heavy. I added mushrooms. I personally thought it needed more soy sauce, and added it to my serving. We'll probably make it again, maybe reducing the peanut butter a bit. It was very peanut buttery.

Very good.  My husband and I both enjoyed this.  Used Jasmine rice instead, though.

By far one of the best recipes I have found on this site.  It was my first time cooking tofu and it turned out perfectly!  This is going to be the dish I turn to next time I need to impress someone!

I really liked the sauce in this recipe.  I'll make it again with different vegetables.  Followed the recipe exactly just changed the tofu to bake at 400, 20 min one side, 10 other as recommended by another poster.

I really liked this. Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars. I subbed a powdered peanut butter product for the peanut butter to cut back on the calories, added broccoli slaw, baked my own tofu and forgot to add the sugar to the peanut sauce. I also served this over brown rice because I was out of white short grained. I enjoyed this and it was pretty quick to put together once I baked my tofu. If you used pre-baked tofu, obviously this would be a snap. Great way to eat tofu and get lots of veggies.

Excellent recipe, only change we made was to add 1 tsp ginger. Served this with the spicey bok choy and curried asparagus dip from this site. Great dinner.

a sweet peanut-y dish. we halved the recipe and fried extra firm tofu in sesame oil. used carrots, green peppers, and onion instead of spinach. added some ground ginger and reduced the sugar a little. served over thai kitchen rice noodles. simple and quick.

This is very similar to thai coconut curries imo, but this tastes better imo. I took another reviewers advice on how to bake the tofu, it turned out really nice. I  prepared the sauce (as the recipe stated + 2 tsp of thai galic chili sauce,    I'm a fan of spice). In the wok I stir fried 2 medium onion, broccoli, and a red pepper, then I added the spinach in, let it wilt and added in the baked tofu. Poured the sauce, I did find that it needed some salt, so I added in a dash.
