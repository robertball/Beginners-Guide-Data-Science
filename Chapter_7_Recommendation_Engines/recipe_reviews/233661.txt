Chef John, I hope you read these sometimes.  This is the absolute best lasagna I've ever had.  Thank you for teaching me how to cook, I'm a total noob.  After having a heart attack at age 47, I was diagnosed with depression.  Doc said to find new hobby, I found you.  I've made several of your recipes, all have been fantastic!!!!  My hubs and step sons are having a blast being my lab rats :)  Thank you for making cooking fun and easy, I never would have thought I could make restaurant quality food.

I have made Chef John's Lasagna two times in the last month and both times it was a huge hit!  Don't skimp on the quality of ingredients, it makes all the difference in the world.

I would follow this recipe as written the first time, it is fantastic as is, but I know we all like to tweak and make it our own, I do too.  Even my 1 year old grandchild was given a little to taste, and he seemed to like it.

Thank you Chef John for another incredible recipe!

I noticed that this recipe says 1/2 lb lean ground beef but the one on Chef John's website says 1 1/2 lbs which is what I've always used.  1/2 l/b is probably not enough!

Except for using Romano instead of Parmesan cheese, I followed this recipe to the letter and made it for the first time this past weekend. It came out perfectly and beautifully. After you have assembled it all and just before putting it in the oven, it may seem as if there is too much liquid in the pan. Don't worry. It cooks off.  I used six lasagna noodles per layer, and that seemed to be plenty.  After taking our portions, I let the tray sit overnight covered with foil in the fridge. Then I cut the lasagna in equal portions, wrapped them in plastic wrap, and put them (bagged) in the freezer. It's a lot of work up front, but well worth it; and now we have ten easy-to-heat meals left. (Oh, I did add a little red wine to the sauce.)

Best lasagna ever- but sadly, fewer leftovers than with my previous recipe. I do add 1-1 1/2 cups red wine to the pot after I brown the meat/veggies and turn up the heat to reduce the liquid by about half, but I am a wino. I'm sure it's just as good without. I've thrown all my other lasagna recipes away.

OK, I haven't made lasagna in years. The stuff I used to make was icky and the noodles were uncooked. Made this recipe last night and the family raved over it. My only question: where is the garlic???  Yes, I cheated and tossed in a couple cloves of minced garlic... anyhow, my aching hands from grating cheese were totally worth it and this will be my go to recipe!  As always John, your recipe was phenomenal. I'm trying the maple-brined pork loin next!  :)

OMG! This dish is absolutely fabulous.  My picky  kids give it 5 stars and have stated that I need to make it again.  This delicious dish weighted 13 lbs when I finished assembly.  It is tasty and very satisfying.  My only regret is that I  could not stuff more in my stomach.  I would also recommend making your own marina sauce using Chef John's recipe.  Don't cheat yourself by using a jar sauce.   It will be well worth the extra effort and Chef John's sauce is pretty easy to make.

I fixed this for the first time while I had family in town and it was a huge hit.  I followed another recommendation and I did 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound sausage.  Regarding the sausage, anyone that has a Wholefoods close by....I highly recommend using the store  made mild chicken Italian sausage.   It so unbelievablely tastey!

Also, next time I will make extra sauce so that I can pour some on the individual slices.  Just a preference. 

Great recipe, thank you Chef John!

I love Chef John but sometimes I think he's not giving the whole story.  30 minutes at 375 covered and then 20 uncovered does not even come close to making this done.  It needs at least 50 minutes covered (increase the temp to 425) and then another 30 minutes uncovered (at 375) for this to be complete.  Chef .... dude .... be  realistic with your timings ... come on man!!!

Followed recipe almost to a T except I left out the mushrooms and I shredded some mozzarella to add in addition to the fresh. What can I say, we like cheese. I give this only 4-stars because it really needed additional seasoning. I added fresh and granulated garlic as well as way more Italian seasoning.  Half a teaspoon for a whole lasagna is just ridiculous. I also added thawed and chopped frozen spinach to the ricotta layer. It was the perfect addition and I never leave it out.  Both my parents AND my inlaws have deemed it the best they've ever had.

As usual, Chef John's recipe does not disappoint! Only two of us so plenty to freeze for another day. Made as written, wonderful! I have in the past used no-boil noodles (I like the flatness and they work) but this time I just put regular noodles in pan of hot faucet water to soften (think a previous reviewer gave me idea) and found this to be an excellent method. I've hated how boiling the pasta can leave some broken. Anyhow, only tweak for me was a bit more red pepper flakes for our taste. Thanks, Chef John! You are my "go to" chef!

I always thought my lasagna was great until I made this recipe.  Absolutely awesome!  I did check his blog to verify the meat amounts.  I subbed chicken sausage for pork, cottage cheese for ricotta and cheated with canned parm.  Rave reviews from the entire family.  It freezes and reheats very well.  Thanks Chef John!

I have prepared lasagna following this recipe a couple of times now and I Love it!  Leaving the noodles in ice cold water really makes a difference in the consistency of the noodle.  I make my own marinara sauce most of the time but once in a while I buy it and when I do I buy the best because if you want your lasagna to be the best you gotta buy the best ingredients!  Thanx Chef John ... there's a few recipes of yours that I've tried and they are all fantastic!

This was amazing.... I followed recipe but added a few of the suggestions... Added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture, doubled the ricotta, omitted the sugar & salt and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, and soaked raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min instead of boiling... AWESOME!!!!!! Husband asked for it a few times these past few weeks... so glad I froze half of it!

Used Jared marinara... Cooked sauce 2 hours... Soaked noodles in boiling water for 15 min... Made exactly as written. Came out pretty darn good... Not at all soupy... Held its shape beautifully.

How delightful! This recipe easily displaced the one I had been using for years. It is more time consuming than most lasagna recipes because of cooking the noodles and simmering the meat for 2 hours. But that can be cut in into two parts if you cook the meat one day and prepare and bake the casserole the next day. As Chef John says, use fresh cheese. It really does make a difference.

This came out delicious! I made this almost exactly but I used Tomato paste, sauce, and diced tomatoes instead of the complete prepared one. I added Italian seasoning also. My family really really enjoyed this dish. Plus its almost unheard of, of people making their own homemade Lasagna these days. Will DEFINITELY be making this many many times.

I cannot imagine sullying this amazingly delicious recipe using sauce from a jar (despite the fact that I am a shameless and long-time fan of Chef John). I make my own marinara, and since I live in a country where Italian sausage is unavailable, I make my own using the recipe provided on this site by Vinnie Bag o' Donuts in feedback on another sausage recipe (look for Hot Italian Sausage by Jim Wyllie, Vinnie's feedback is the most helpful critical review - adjust according to the amount of meat you're using) . Thanks Chef John and Vinnie!

Good, but recipe was hard for me to follow - two different 8oz Mozzarella pkgs in 2 different locations?  Missed it when shopping.  
There seemed to be way too many noodles and too much meat and cheese for a normal 10x15 pan, I made an extra one and froze it - which is great, but for one pan, I'll reduce the ingredients next time.  
Cam e out great, and tasted good as well - the italian sausage really helps.

I added about 1/4 tsp. of fennel, because I've always thought it makes lasagna "pop".  Honestly, this recipe is so good I don't know whether or not it made a significant difference. 

If you want a fantastic dinner for 6-10 people, and you have the time to let things simmer, this is the only thing you should bother looking at. 

A word of caution: make sure your meat-sauce saucepan/saute pan is *really* spacious. Personally, I find it easier to make the meat sauce in a stock-pot, then soak the noodles in cold water for 20 minutes before par-boiling in a "large" saucepan. 

But if you know your way around a kitchen, you can solve logistical problems like that already. 

This is simply an excellent recipe. 

I used to make really good lasagna. But now that old recipe seems almost insipid. This is WAY better.

Was very tasty.  Also my first attempt at a lasagne and I did pretty well.  I made more layers than the recipe called for, though.  Also added garlic to the meat/sauce mixture.  You can skip the cayenne if you don't want a little kick to the dish.

Another great recipe from Chef John! My family loved this one. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x11 pan. I used shredded mozzarella because I didn't notice that the recipe called for fresh mozzarella, but it still turned out great. I also drained the meat after cooking - I don't see any reason to leave that nasty fat in there. Every recipe I have made from Chef John has been 5 stars. Keep them coming!

Super tasty!  Will likely use less of the sausage next time - a tiny bit too spicy for my wimpy tastebuds.  :)

This was the best Lasagna I ever made! I was a bit confused about the  mozzarella because it was listed twice on the ingredients list. I added one pack of mozzarella to the cheese mixture and added the rest of it on top and throughout the lasagna. I didn't use any added salt except in the boiling water, and I'm glad I didn't because it didn't need it. Next time I will make my sauce and meat mixture the day before, so it won't take up so much of my day.

I rarely give 5 stars but this is a winner and loved the video that went along with it, really helped and easy to follow.  Husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I served it with a salad. The only thing negative is the ingredients list is a bit confusing, ricotta amount, but I figured it out.  Will use and make again.

Absolutely amazing, best lasagna I've ever had. Made it exactly as indicated except I didn't boil the noodles, just soaked them  in hot tap water while prepping other items - and only let the sauce cook down for 30 minutes instead of the 2 hours advised.  It probably worked out well because my noodles needed some of that excess liquid to finish cooking in the oven.  I had 4 noodles left over after using 6 per layer.  Used a high quality jarred sauce - Lidia's tomato basil.

This is virtually the same recipe I’ve been using for years. This is almo Identical to the old Better Crocker cookbook recipe. I don’t use all fresh mozzarella though.  But very rich and delicious for sure.

I would definitely add more marinara sauce. Each layer seemed thin and the top layer suffered the most. This was my first attempt at lasagna and it turned out well. I would make it again.

Yay me dinner! I pretty much followed the recipe, I used hot Italian sausage so I lowered the red pepper. I also made the pasta noodles because I was off work and needed to smash some dough ;) I used all the fat and cheese because sometimes you just need that! I added Cabernet instead of water during the two hour simmer time when it started to thicken.  I divided the recipe between 3 foil dishes, ( one for my man, one for my adult child's home, and one for my friend's house). The house smelt so good we were licking the cabinets! Salad and garlic bread to go with.... couldn't ask for anything better! Thank you, Chef!

I loved this recipe, even though it took 4.5 hours start to finish. My customer (wife) agreed that it was excellent. We had it with our favorite Caesar salad, also from this site.
Changes I made:
1. I had a leek that wanted a home so I chopped it up and sautéed it before adding the meat to brown.
2. I added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic to the leeks just before adding the meat.
3. I had some chives on hand so I added those to the cheese mix.
4. I added red wine rather than water when it got too thick. No big deal.
5. I cooked the noodles VERY al dente, i.e. for only 6 minutes, though the box instructions said 12. I knew it would be OK because they cook again in the oven and absorb all those delicious flavors.
6. I committed sacrilege: I did use whole mild ricotta, but I didn't have any fresh whole-milk mozzarella so I used a part skim-milk heresy. And it was pretty good. Go ahead, report me to the authorities :). 
I'll definitely make it again.

I use Allrecipes all the time, but this is my first review because it was so good.  (Although I may be justifying the 3-1/2 hour prep, as my guests seemed to be underwhelmed.)  But I write to let others know it can be great even with substitutions/omissions.  I used one pound ground chicken instead of 1-1/2 pounds ground beef to save money on an expensive dish!  I left out the mushrooms as everyone doesn’t like mushrooms.  And I used no-boil lasagna noodles, which worked beautifully.  My best lasagna yet.

Due to a very hectic schedule I had to make this in stages. Meat sauce after dinner last night. Cheese stage after lunch today.  Made pasta and assembled the lasagna around 415.  It was in the oven by 445. Cooked, rested and on the table at 615.
I followed the directions (other than stages) as written, with the exception of using seasoned pepper as my family prefers spices that are finely ground.
This was very good.  My Granddaughter even said "good supper".
Thanks for the recipe AND for videos that teach and entertain at the same time.

I added peppers- red, green, yellow and orange. I transferred them to the meat fat in the skillet and cooked them with onions, garlic, and herbs before transferring them to the meat sauce.

I also made it again with turkey and it's just as amazing. I love Chef John!

I usually love Chef John's recipes; however, my mom was Italian so I have always followed her recipe with a few of my own additions. I found this recipe just too meaty  for my liking; however, a good friend of mine preferred this recipe to my own regular recipe. I should say he is a meat lover and I am not! One takeaway I did get from this recipe is the use of fresh mozzarella cheese rather than the grating kinds or pre-sliced, I will from here on in use fresh so for that tip, I thank you Chef.

Once again, Well Done Chef John. Made it with just a few tweaks to fit my family. no cayenne and Ground turkey instead of beef. Made marinara sauce in advance so I wouldn't have to use jarred. Extra sauce is always a plus.
A definite hit. Thanks

Chef John comes up trumps again, this is undoubtably the best lasagne I have made or tasted, bar none. Gone is the greasy cheesy bechamel gloop that I always associated with lasagne. Instead a much firmer dish and rich without being gloopy. It's my 'goto' lasagne from now.

This is a great recipe; the meat sauce is incredibly delicious. I used sweet pork Italian sausage from Trader Joe's and it was perfect!

Changes: 

I used 1lb of beef and it turned out great.

I opted for a little less tomato sauce (and possibly next time will use even less because it turned way too watery for me; although leftovers were VERY good).

I will DEFINITELY make this lasagna again!

Followed the recipe from beginning to end. It turned out beautiful and tasted delicious! Served it as Friday night supper to 14 family members. Everyone loved it! It took a while to prepare, so make sure you have ample time. I did mine in advance and froze it; reworking it for the dinner. I’ll definitely make this again!

This recipe was very flavorful even though I didn't include the sweet sausage. I used 2% cottage cheese and packaged grated mozzarella and it was still delicious. Mixing the cheeses into the cottage cheese nicely simplifies the recipe. I used a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and mixed spinach into cottage cheese. I used "oven-ready" noodles, though left the top layer of noodles off fearful that they'd be too crisp. Used  half the salt and it was still salty. Everyone loved it!

I make it just as written. The secret is simmering the sauce. Don't cheat on the time. It's worth it.

We made this lasagna and it turned out pretty great! The meat sauce was AMAZING, but there should have been a bit more. The ricotta sauce was good. We used no-boil lasagna noodles. They were slightly overcooked. Next time, I would make more meat sauce, and boil my own noodles. Overall, it was pretty good.

My 12 year old daughter asked me to teach her to cook. Her first dish she wanted to make lasagna. This is the recipe we chose. It was easy for her to follow and she did a great job. We didn't change a thing. I just recommend simmering your sauce for a few hours. Like my grandma taught me.

I adore most every recipe Chef John publishes! This one was no different, but, needs a little tweak or two. First- what kind of Italian dish doesn’t include garlic?! That is a MUST! I added in 2 minced cloves. And, the sauce turned out to be way too watery. I opted not to add any water to begin with, even though it calls for it, and still ended up removing over 2 cups of excess liquid from the simmering sauce after 2 hours. So, I don’t recommend adding any water at all! You’ll need to strain out what is already liquid, to begin with. The ricotta sauce was plentiful. But, I feel an additional egg should be added- it was a little dry. I only ended up using about half of the noodles. And the pan was well overflowing- definitely need that drip tray! Hindsight- place tinfoil down!! I also felt the cheese was a little weak. The recipe didn’t say what to do with the remaining 8oz of fresh mozzarella, so I dumped ALL of the remainder on top and that was a fantastic move! It created the perfect, slightly browned but melty top layer. The final result was delicious! There is definitely something to be said about letting that sauce simmer for 2 hours! But- add some fresh garlic & use ALL the cheese! And don’t add any additional water! The flavor is fantastic & I will definitely make this again with the tweaks.

Followed the recipe as closely as I could. Used spicy Italian sausage so I left out the red pepper and cayenne.  Everyone loved it! Making it again for the second time this month since I had so many requests for it.  The prepared marinara sauce I use is a predominantly basil in flavor so I added a little oregano instead of the Italian herbs.

First time making lasagne with ricotta. Five adults, one loved it, four (including cook) said 'meh' preferring the bechamel version. If making this version again I would par-boil the dried pre-cooked noodles and use a much looser ragu as it turned out dry on this occasion. I found the consistency was similar to cannelloni but not as good. This is the first time Chef John has given me a miss rather than a hit.

This is really a great lasagna. I am generally "Meh." on the dish but this was great. Made a homemade pomodoro to include and it was stellar.

Delicious for a traditional lasagna.  I felt that it had a bit too much sauce, so next time I will probably cut out about a cup.

Delicious! Easy! The very best! I didn’t have a lasagna pan I just used my 9x13 pan which works but it will spill over so make sure you put a sheet pan under it while baking. Also this recipe cost’s me 40 bucks to make but worth it for me considering I put half of it up and freeze it so it feeds my family a few times.  I love Chef John’s recipes they never fail. Always good, crowd pleasing and easy to follow. He always explains in detail his method which is greatly appreciated! I know when I make a recipe of his, it’s going to be good every single time, ?? It’s safe to say I’m a Chef John fan!

So delicious! I have tried a 1000 lasagna recipes and have a lot of good ones, but this one!? This one is awesome. Simple and decadent. I made this for guests and they raved. I didn't spend all day in the kitchen and I didn't spend all night cleaning.
Worth making over and over!

Tasted good, but I would give it 5 stars with more cheese and more sauce added.  I liked the ricotta mix since it was smooth to spread.  Be aware the recipe calls for a larger pan than normal, so I split mine between a 9 x 12 and a smaller pan for the remaining amounts.  Would make again!

Add several garlic cloves, minced, to the ricotta mixture. Fresh parsley really does enhance quality.
Add what pleases you. Enjoy

The only change I made was adding garlic and a couple of bay leaves while the sauce simmered. I’ve cooked for my son and his wife every Tuesday night for the last 5 years or so now
and always use one of Chef John’s recipes. They are all exceptional!

Best lasagna ever, and it's HUGE.  Recipe says 12 servings but we got an easy 16 out of it.  Use Chef John's marinara sauce.

I made this just as the directions say.  Where is the cheese? 
 Way too much tomato flavor.  The Italian sausage was the second flavor that came out.   No cheese flavor what so ever!  Disappointing after putting the time and effort into this recipe.

FANTASTIC lasagna recipe, don't change a thing!  It was hearty and delicious.  Chef John is right - it's all about a great meat sauce and a great cheese mixture.  Simmering the sauce for 2 hours made it so tender, almost like a stew, and I loved the combo of ground beef and sweet Italian sausage.  It was a labor of love that I was happy to take the time to make on a rainy Sunday afternoon with the football game on.

Made this recipe for the first time for a friend. I made a few small changes; used a pound of hot Italian sausage and left out the pepper flakes; only simmered the meats for about an hour and a quarter, that was a little too long and I had to add a little more sauce. All in all, an excellent lasagna. Be sure to have some garlic bread and nice dry red!

This recipe is delicious - I followed it exactly except I used BARILLA oven ready NO BOIL lasagna noodles.  These noodles are like homemade, very thin, and made the lasagna so light! My son-in-law loved the fact that it wasn't a heavy lasagna.  I would definitely use these noodles again when I make this recipe.  Just be sure every inch is covered with cheese and sauce.  Best lasagna I ever made!

It turned out okay. A little bland though. Next time I’ll add a lot more spices, and maybe some sautéed mushrooms black olives. It needs something!

I'd give this receipe 10 stars if it allowed me to do so.  This is the absolute best lasagna I've ever tasted.  I made it 4 times since discovering it and EVERYBODY loves it.  At large family gatherings  it's perfect to serve with a large salad and fresh bread or garlic bread.  I've even had requests to make it when we get together.  

I didn't change or add a thing, but I do use high quality ingredients when I make this lasagna.  (I will take a photo the next time I make it).

I've made this 5 or 6 times and every time it comes out amazing! I usually add a little more of each meat and mushrooms because I use a slightly bigger pan. It is sooooo yummy!

This lasagna recipe brought out some really nice spice and heat from the sausage; I was really happy with the texture and flavor! No changes needed except that the wine recommendation I see in all the reviews was totally on the nose. I loved the flavor I got form adding about a cup of wine, and letting the sauce thicken up to a ruby red.  The sauce can definitely withstand 2.5 hrs of simmering without a problem, just stir frequently.  Also, I used the no-boil lasagna pasta from trader joe’s And this is not recommended- came out too hard and required more time cooking.  Just use fresh or boiled pasta!!!

This recipe gave me my first attempt at making a lasagna that stayed together, It Worked.   My husband took some to work and am now under pressure to recreate this wonderful dish.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I did substitute the ground beef with brisket.

Simmering the sauce for 2-3 hours on low made a significant difference (in the past I had not simmered but 30 mins or so) - it gives the meat a texture that is pleasant with Lasagna. Another check in the "win" column Chef John - thanks for another great recipe!!!

I made this tonight. The setting up,  flavor and looks were amazing. However mine did not come out as I would have liked.  It seemed really dry to me, my husband loved it, but it did not have enough sauce for mine. First of all I bought 2 jars marinara  think this would be enough it was not. I measured it out and it came to 5 3/4 c but the recipe calls for 6 . Do you think that 1/4 cup changed my texture and dried it up? Otherwise it was perfect and plan to use again but would like to know if the 1/4 shy  I was of marinara caused it to be dry. Thank you

I made my own sauce and cooked the beef and Italian sausage with it in the pressure cooker to speed up things a bit. Instead of boiling dry noodles, I used fresh lasagna noodles. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was well worth it. My Italian grandma would be proud.

What a great lasagna recipe.  Easy to make and the meat in the sauce is what really sets it off.  You need patience when spreading the pot cheese, it will move the noodles.  Great tasting lasagna, everyone enjoyed it.

Very tasty. It does seem to be a lot of work. Followed the recipe and everyone loved it! (except the one that does not like mushrooms) It went over big and had only 2 small pieces left over.

This lasagna is delicious, I already can’t wait to have it again! I’m wondering if this recipe is freezer friendly - can I freeze it after assembly but before baking? Has anyone tried this? Thanks!

I usually don't put Italian sausage in my lasagna, but if a recipe is from Chef John, I won't make any changes. This lasagna recipe is no different: no changes. My only stumbling blocks were that my lasagna dish is 9 x 13, and that I didn't know how small to dice the mozzarella, so not only was there a lot more sauce and cheese than needed - certainly not a problem! - I'd made the chunks a bit too large so the cheese layers were thicker than optimal.  This is now my go-to lasagna recipe! Big hit; thanks, Chef John!

Cher John makes this seem easy to make and it is so easy to make. Watch the video, go shopping and then enjoy. We opened a nice Cab to go with this. Plenty of leftovers. I would suggest this to anyone. Fun to make!

I love the meat sauce in this recipe. Changes I made were mainly due to what I had available. For the meat sauce I did not use any sausage, only ground beef. I also added 2 onions while cooking my ground beef, and 2 cloves of garlic. In addition, I add spinach to my lasagna . I mix it in with the ricotta cheese. 
I use tomato juice to line the bottom of the pans , rather than sauce, and I pour in extra juice for the noodles to absorb.

I followed   the recipe exactly and Chef John doesn't disappoint me. I'll definitely make it again. I got it ready the night before and took it out of the refrigerator and baked it an hour with foil over it and baked another 30min. uncovered. Delicious!

I'm a single dad and I love to cook. Just to be clear, I don't follow recipes. I use them as guidelines. Chef John nailed this one, prepared marinara sauce.  It makes things much easier. I followed CJ's recipe closer than I usually do and hands down this is the best Lasagna that has ever come out of my kitchen. My son loves Lasagna and told me it was the best Lasagna I've ever made. My neighbor said the same thing.  Thanks, CJ!

This was my first time making lasagna, and it turned out perfectly!  I followed the recipe to a tee and I didn't skimp on the ingredients.  The hubby and son raved about it!  We also shared this tasty lasagna with other family members and they all agreed---it was the best lasagna they ever tasted!  Chef John never disappoints me with his recipes!  This is definite keeper and I look forward to making and eating it again!  Thanks, Chef John for another winner!

I made my own sauce with ground turkey, using sausage spices in the turkey. I omitted the mushrooms, sausage, and cayenne pepper to suit family preferences. The lasagna was delicious, everyone in the house wants to know when we’re having it again.

This recipe was amazingly easy to make and cost me $27 to make using quality ingredients. I made two of these partially cooking one so I could enjoy a fabulous lasagna when family comes over. After removing from the oven, it was left to cool near room temperature. Once cooled, it was frozen. When I decided to cook it, I thawed it in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough time for it to thaw so I placed it in the sink in a cold water bath. It turned out as well as the first!

Normally use Nonna's recipe for Lasagna, but wanted to give this a try.  The only thing I changed was a touch of fresh garlic and bay leaf in the marinara sauce while it simmered. Everyone enjoyed especially complimented on the lack of soupy lasagna.

This is, hands down, the best recipe for lasagna! The only miscalculation I made was for the prep time. For me, it was more like 45 minutes  including browning the meat and putting the cheeses together. Don't scrimp on the ingredients...they are SO worth the effort of using the best.

DELISH!  I made this for a dinner party of 8 people and it was MORE than enough.  I also made my own marinara sauce which I think helped with the 5 star rating. :)  I will definitely make again but the only thing I will change is cooking the noodles a few minutes longer.  They absorbed a lot of the sauce in the oven ( I had about 8 cups of sauce in my Lasagna) so the dish was a bit dry for my tastes but not enough to change the rating.  Excellent and worth the effort!!

1st time I ever made Lasagna at age 74, my sister always made it.  I live in one state, my sister lives in another.  I seen this receipt and made it and I can say it was as good as my sisters and she made great Lasagna.  I would highly recommend this receipt it is just super.

I just felt like I wanted some Lasagna so I looked up Chef John's.  I really loved what he had for ingredients even though it took some time to get it all together.  Best ever I love using ricotta for the filling that is the only cheese to use.  I dressed it up with fresh herbs, it was wonderful.

Top notch lasagna.  This is a very hearty and filling meal that is full of flavour and comfort goodness.  Like most lasagnas it takes some work and time to put together but it is well worth it.

I kinda tweaked the recipe as I obviously can't read a recipe.  I used ground pork instead of the sausage and added more spice than called for as well as a tin of tomato paste.

Turned out beautifully for my first attempt.  Great recipe and easy to make.  This is my go to for lasagna!

WOW is all I can say. When my husband comes to the stove to see what was being taken out of the oven and says...OH MY Gosh does that look good, you bet this is a recipe that I will continue to have in my file. It is time consuming to make this recipe but once you prep all the items that go into the lasagna and place it into the oven, the wait is worth the effort. I did not change a thing and that is why I am giving it a five star rating, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, thanks Chef John.

Thank you, Chef John, for teaching me the correct way of making lasagne!  I didn't grow up cooking Italian meals, so this simplified it.  Love the sausage/ground beef combination.  I did add garlic because one can never have too much garlic .....

Excellent recipe! I've been making lasagna for several decades so this wasn't my first rodeo. Mixing the mozzarella in with the ricotta mixture (rather than a separate layer) made the assembly go a tad quicker and I think it melted more evenly. I make my own marinara sauce to add to the meat mixture. That makes a huge difference to the quality and authenticity of the dish to me. I added a pinch of nutmeg to the cheese mixture as I do for most cheese sauces. Bravo, Chef John!

Easy.  My first attempt at lasagna.  I omitted the mushrooms because there's a finicky eater and I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta since I had it.  Everyone loved it.  Will do it again.

Outstanding recipe! I've made it with and without the meat in the sauce - either one is fine. Important key is to use best quality jarred marinara sauce, not the one's on sale for $1.99...

This is the BEST lasagna I have had or made ever!  My husband raved about it, and I totally agreed. Chef John has never failed to deliver the best recipes, and with this one he exceeded our expectations!  We did add onion and garlic but because we always do. You won’t regret for a second making this dish!!!  Thank  you Chef John!!!!!

I've made lasagna often enough I was really just looking for a reminder of the ratios...and this one was absolutely perfect.  I swapped the amounts of sausage and hamburger; swapped cayenne for nutmeg; omitted all added salt; and left out the mushrooms.  But the ratio of sauce to cheese to noodles was spot on. I baked as instructed; let cool on stove for a couple hours then baked again just prior to eating.  Outstanding!!

This is so good. I have made it 5-6 times. You can add different vegetables in the sauce as it's cooking - zucchini, eggplant, spinach... It always tastes amazing. It takes a long time, so I only do it on the weekend but it make a lot of food and freezes well to have later.

You can't go wrong with a Chef John recipe… he is the very best! I made this sauce with a few small changes... I used hot sausage and omitted the ground beef. Now,  it will add a kick to the taste but my family loved, loved, loved it!  This will be my go to Lasagna from now on.  Just remember to go the extra mile and use high grade ingredients, it's worth it!

Fantastic Lasagna. I found the comment about cutting into squares wrapping in plastic wrap and then placing in freezer bags helpful. I had not made lasagna in a long time because it makes so much - so this is useful.
I also added some onions and garlic.

Just made this tonight and was delighted!  Followed the recipe, but added minced garlic (can't seem to cook without it), diced  jalapeño peppers, and additional cheese.  One of my favorites!

Chef John has made me a better home cook and I followed the recipe but not the exact ingredients - we are having leftovers for the next few nights, the lasagna went perfectly with a 7-year old cab sav/merlot blend we were saving and chose to celebrate a successful first lasagna instead.  He said not to use grated mozzarella but that was what we had and it worked just fine.  Next time I will try out more closely to the actual recipe, but rest assured just beef mince works perfectly you don't have to add sausage meat.

Followed recipe exactly. It was awesome but we couldn't eat it all so I divided it into portions and froze them in airtight bags. This made perfect dinners after work later. This recipe is a keeper. I've never made lasagna before and Chef Johns step by step video made it so easy.

I followed the recipe except left out the red pepper flakes due to the hot sausage being in the recipe.  It makes a huge amount.  I served it to family guests, and they loved it, and the next day they took it out of the refrigerator, and helped themselves, reheating individual portions in the microwave.  I will definitely make it again, and I may add a little additional mozzarella to the top next time

This is hands down the best lasagna I've ever eaten! I usually skip the meat (most of my family is vegetarian) and use chef John's tomato sauce recipe from the Food Wishes website. It's delicious!

As I've been saying for a number of years now, you cannot go wrong with any of Chef John's recipes.  I prefer to cook my hot Italian sausage for several hours, along with Chef John's meatball recipe, and then slice the sausage and meatballs into the lasagna.  I also use Chef John's pasta sauce recipe for the sauce.  If it comes from Chef John, it's great!  Did I mention I really like Chef John's recipes?  Kidding, but he's the best!

ROCKSTAR LASAGNA.  Using diced-up mozzarella cheese (not the bagged shredded stuff) makes a huge difference.  Fantastic.

Great flavor and the first recipe I found that uses the correct size lasagna pan.
I liked the mushrooms, but several friends don't like mushrooms.   So, I will try it without the mushrooms next time.

Best lasagna we've ever had.  Loved the use of fresh mozzarella in it.  One thing to beware if you don't care for your lasagna on the spicy side-don't add the extra spices and take care that your sausage isn't hot.  I didn't add the pepper flakes or cayenne, but the sausage was hotter than expected.  My 2 year old loved the lasagna, but the meat mix was too spicy for her.

Best lasagna I've ever made!  I used all sausage as my husband requested and it was a big hit with my family. Don't change a thing. Maybe next time for fun I'll add some chopped pepperoni.  Thank you Chef John!

Finally a lasagna recipe for us!  This was time consuming, as is any lasagna, especially because I used Chef John's delicious homemade tomato sauce.  An all day affair - would be easier if you make the sauce one day then make the lasagna the next day or just use good quality jarred sauce.  Next time I will reduce the amount of meat, maybe by a third.  It really absorbed the sauce and was a bit much for us, though meat lovers will love it.   It's also a bit spicy for my tastes so I may reduce the red pepper flake or even omit it.  Overall an excellent recipe.  Once again, well done Chef John!!

This recipe has replaced my old lasagna recipe, which is very similar but with less cheese. My old recipe was always a favorite in my house until this little beauty hit the table. Even my daughter, who hates melted cheese, (weird I know) had two helpings. Such an awesome comfort food!

My favorite lasagne recipe.  It's great for big family meals, but since I only cook for 1 or 2 at the most I divide it in thirds and freeze two (loaf sized) pans.   Once I substituted 2 parts sausage to 1 part hamburger, which worked out really well.

Delicious!, Great recipe, I adjust 2lb of beef to turkey still very delicious. Also the final product was a little watery, why, I put to much water in the meat sauce. When the instructions ask to clean your marinara sauce jar/can and pour water into sauce, you only want to start with a cup. While cooking if you notice the sauce is too thick add more water accordingly. Regardless excellent delicious recipe. Thanks Chef John.

This was fantastic.  I had to omit mushrooms, as I didn't have any.  For the sauce, I did not have any jar of marinara sauce, so I made Chef John basic marinara sauce and added the ground meat to it, browning it in a pan.

The mixture of ricotta cheese was so delicious I had to resist the urge to eat spoonful of it.  

The pan makes a bit difference.  Mine was a little too big and so I ended up being a little short on sauce and cheese.  But that doesn't appear to have altered the end result.

It was delicious and my husband declared he could eat this everyday.  Considering how many portions this makes, his wish will be granted for a while.

Made it for my family and they loved it!  Made 2/3 as recommended but substituted vegetarian Italian sausage and Morningstar crumbles for meat.  Other 1/3 was made w/ vegan cheeses.  Bought Kite ricotta, healthy for life Parmesan and Daya mozzarella at Whole Foods.  This mix was smooth, and tasted similar to the real cheese mix.  I added fennel seeds to the meat mix...this is one of the tastes of Italian sausage.  Next time will ask for house vegan ricotta at Whole Foods deli.
Chef John's recipes convert well to vegan variations with a little know how.  Thanks.

This is a wonderful recipe and never dry. It calls for 10x15 pan m,   if you use a 9x13 pan like I do   it needs to be 3" deep to hold everything .  Breaking hamburger and sausage into smaller crumbles seems to work better for me

Pretty much followed the recipe except accidentally bought about 1/3 of what was called for ricotta. I still think I had plenty though. First time cooking with hot sausage so I didn't add the pepper flakes not knowing the level of spice with it yet. Not much of any spice at all with just the sausage! Thanks Chef John!

I really don't like lasagna and I loved this one!  I had to go to parent conferences at school and wanted to leave something for my family.  As I was making it and started to taste the parts along the way I knew it was going to be delicious!  For some reason I found this lasagna recipe less labor intensive than others I've made.  I think it was probably because I started the meat early in the morning and treated the recipe as two parts (meat & the rest of it).   I put in 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and I really  think the cayenne and the red pepper flakes added so much flavor to it.  I also took Chef John's advice and made sure I bought the fresh cheese. He is right, it did make a difference.  I did not have a large lasagna pan and as I watched the video I realized that my baking dishes would not do.  I bought a $1.99 tin pan and that was a huge help.   I found the video very helpful.  I am already looking forward to eating the leftovers.

I made this the second time for my cousin who had gotten out of the hospital. I assembled the lasagna without baking it and put it in the fridge. My cousin baked it the next day and she really liked it. Thanks again Chef John :)

OK, for me there was good news and bad news. The good news is that having made this recipe exactly as written, this was the BEST lasagna recipe I've made in my 58-year-old life. The bad news is that it took the better part of a day for me to make it. Admittedly I squeezed other things in between the steps to complete this lasagna, but it still felt as though making it went on and on and on. I received rave reviews from my family and guest, so it was worth it. I won't make it again, though, until I know I have the better part of a day to spend PLENTY of time to complete all the steps.
P.S. The list of ingredients includes 2 8-oz. containers of fresh mozzarella cheese, but the instructions only dictate using a total of 12 oz. (8 oz. in the ricotta mixture and 4 oz. dotted on top).

Question hopefully someone can answer. 
Can I make the meat sauce 1 day prior to making the lasagna or will the meat become less tender? I am making this for my boyfriends birthday but I wont have time to spend 3.5 hours on it.

I made this for the first time last night. I was cooking for someone who doesn't like spice so I omitted the cayenne and pepper flakes. I also added a splash of red wine to give the sauce some depth. I was short on time so I baked at 375 for 20 minutes then broiled for 10. It got the crunchy cheese topping that I love. I'll make this again with the spices.

I made it with ground pork, ground turkey & ground beef.  I also put in some fresh spinach.  This was the best tasting lasagna ever.  I truly believe it has to do with simmering the sauce for 2 hours.  Wasn't the easiest recipe - there are a lot of steps and a lot of ingredients, however, I will definitely make it again for a crowd!

I followed the recipe, best tip was to crumble the Mozzarella cheese, not to grate it.  Second best tip was keeping the meat and cheese layers thin, but doubling up on pasta noodles.  Be sure to watch the video. 
Finally, a lasagna for company!

Made it by recipe.  Firm and taste lasagna! It was good but blander than I thought it would be.  Which means the average person will love it.  Next time I will add crushed red peppers and more sweet basil.  My family loves spicy !

This is hands down, the BEST meat sauce recipe I've ever made. Thoroughly enjoyable and very easy to make. I used fresh crushed tomatoes in lieu of those from a can. After letting this sauce simmer overnight in my Le Creuset cast iron pot, I got up in the morning, baked the lasagna and the family and I enjoyed and early dinner meal that evening. The dish was heavenly.
