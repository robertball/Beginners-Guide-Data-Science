A big hit at thanksgiving. I reduced the sugar by half but added some maple syrup. Very easy to make.

I loved the idea of combining the figs and cranberries. However,  I reduced the amount of brown sugar a bit in order to substitute a good quality maple syrup for the maple extract without making it overly sweet. Will definitely make this again for the holidays!
