Tried this recipe tonight.the only change I made was I used 2 cans of cream of chicken (because I like a wetter pie)  and a bit more chicken. It was phenomenal!! Better than I anticipated!

I have made this dish for my family more times than I can count and they never tire of it (it has actually become a special request for birthday dinners). The only changes I have made are that I add all of the cheese to the filling (I do not sprinkle any in the to of the crust) and instead of frozen pie crust I make a crust recipe that I found on this site (Grandma Ruth's Pie Crust)...DELICIOUS!!

This was a major hit with my family. I did not have the roll out pillsbury ready made pie crust, so I used two deep dish ready made pie crusts, one for holding the filling, the other for the top. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and used two cans of soup and I used one can of milk ( approx. one cup) I like a wetter pie as well. Other than that all stayed the same. I even had some left over filling so I kept that, heated it the next day, put it over some toast and the rest is history! Loved this recipe!!! It is a keeper.

I just put this recipe in the oven and I decided to use the 2 cans of soup and 1 can of milk and it was almost too much liquid for my deep dish 9" pie pan.  In fact, I know it is going to boil over in my oven.

Had a TON OF LEFTOVER CHICKEN after a Graduation Party a couple weeks ago and stumbled upon this recipe.  My husband ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!??I froze the remaining chicken in 2c increments to use specifically for this recipe!  Actually making it again tonight!  Note:I DID add additional seasoning to suit my taste buds. ??. Definitely a keeper and SO EASY!!

This recipe was great tasting and no time to make!  Used two cans of soup and 1 cup of milk instead.  Also added more chicken.  For the vegetables I used frozen peas and carrots, and also added some diced onions and sliced mushrooms.  Quick and easy to make.  Definitely will be using again.

Pretty good recipe.  I'd recommend using smaller dishes to cook them in to make the pot pie more personal.  My wife says its a little bland but then again I've spoiled her with some flavorful foods.
