Very nice vinaigrette because of the use of fresh basil, but very heavy on the oil.  I cut the recipe in half and used less than half the amount of oil.  Start off with a small amount of oil and add it according to your tastes and you'll have a nice dressing.

Excellent flavor!  I used red-wine vinegar instead of baslamic and had to increase the vinegar just a little to suit my sour taste.  But, I am getting rave reviews!  Thanks Richard for sharing the recipe.

I loved this dressing! It looks a little dark and not so appealing once it is mixed up, but it tastes wonderful over just a basic salad. A good salad dressing to go with a beef dish.

Great salad dressing Richard! I cut back the oil by half, yet still used the same amounts of the rest of the ingredients. After tasting, I felt it needed a little brightening, so I added the juice of a half of a lemon. My new favorite!!!!

Loved LOVED LOVED the fresh basil!  I doubled the vinegar (white balsamic) and added the juice of half a lemon and a good squirt of dijon mustard.  Left the cheese out and added it on top of the salad.  I may still reduce the oil a bit next time, but still a good recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I cut the oil to only half a cup and added a few tablespoons of lemon juice.  After this was blended I put it over a fresh spinach salad with cilantro and onions.  Heavenly!!

The roasted garlic is an interesting idea,if you have time.  I used raw. The ratio of oil to vinegar is way off; typically 2:1 or 2.5:1 is about right, which is what I had to do...add vinegar.

Way too much oil. Needed more vinegar. Mixing it the blender made it very pesto-y. It turned out below expectations cause I love balsamic vinegar and roasted garlic.

Good use of all that fresh basil growing in the garden.  Was very nice on a chicken pasta salad with lots of tomatoes.

This is a FABULOUS recipe!  I roasted the garlic which made this recipe. I had tons of basil in my garden so this was a great way to use.  Use less oil if using on salads but I made a bunch up and froze small containers of it. It freezes beautifully.  My favorite way to use this is to flavor salmon or any kind of meat.  I cook it with the meat and it makes the meat super delicious!  This is my favorite recipe for my herb garden.

I really wish I had read the reviews before I made this. It had way too much oil and so I ended up just using it as a marinade for some boneless skinless chicken breasts. Good flavor...will probably try again with less oil.

It really is quite good but I think it needs something to give it  bit more of a flavor to it. Maybe some roasted sesame oil or garlic.

I actually added little bits of apple cider vinegar to this to give it some acidity and it burst the basil flavor so much!

Made it with fresh basil from my garden, used  extra virgin olive oil and cut the oil to a 2:1 ratio to the balsamic vinegar. Came out perfect! Delicious!

After reading other reviews, I adjusted the oil and vinegar amounts.  I used 1/2 cup champagne vinegar and just over a cup of olive oil.  I also added a teaspoon of white sugar.

This was easy and quick. I threw everything into the blender and blended it all on high for 20 seconds. I added a pinch of sugar, then seasoned with salt and pepper. Came together quick and was quite tasty! I will make this again.

Delicious but way too much oil. Next time I will use 2 cups instead of 3
