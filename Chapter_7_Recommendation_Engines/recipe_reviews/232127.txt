My husband is an avid fisherman. Lots of Salmon in the freezer from Pulaski to use up so this sounded great! We liked all the veggies in there and cooking in milk was a great way to prepare this and get that strong fishy taste out of the fish. I was not able to find wheat germ in my local grocery store but I did find wheat bran. Other than that I did it just as explained. We both liked it but it was too "runny" I would not add all of the milk next time I would add some than mash it up and see if I needed more. Other that that this was great! I also tried a couple patties with Chipotle Panko crumbs on the outside and they were our favorites.  Thanks for sharing we will be trying this again with some modifications. Maybe some of that shredded zucchini that is in the freezer instead of white potatoes and crushed flax instead of wheat bran.

Great dish and family loved it.  Thank you for sharing.  Agree that you need to be careful with the milk to avoid it being "mushy".  I had to add breadcrumbs to "stiffen the mix".  Other than that it was great.  Will do better next time.

I followed the recipe and it did come out a little too wet but still great.  Not too fishy.  When they cooled, I wrapped each one individually in tin foil and froze them.  It's been very helpful to know that I can heat one of those up instead of eating junk when I'm busy.  Freezes beautifully.  Time to make another batch!  Thanks for sharing!

So yummy!!  I altered the recipe to be gluten and lactose free, and only used regular potatoes (no sweet potato).  I used light coconut milk instead of milk.  I substituted the whet germ with flax seed meal, and I substituted the bread crumbs with a mix of almond flour, a little bit of coconut flour, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  DEFINITELY add the milk slowly, the recipe seems to call for too much which makes the mix too runny to form cakes.  I had to add a lot more flax seed flour to thicken it up. I fried the cakes in grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil.   I also created an aioli with aioli olive oil mayonnaise, lemon juice, fresh garlic, salt, and pepper to drizzle over the top!  DELICIOUS!

Tastes great and although it takes quite a bit of prep, cakes freeze well and make quick microwave leftovers. Used only sweet potatoes and left skin on (remove large pieces of potato skin as needed when forming patties). Substitute

I did not use any of the milk and they were fine! I also put the mixture into the refrigerator before making into patties. That firms it up.

I love how moist this recipe came out! The key is to not use all of the milk in the salmon. I only used about half of it and added a little bit more breadcrumbs, which helped to absorb any extra liquid. My husband and I loved it!

These were a bit more time consuming than my regular recipe for salmon cakes.  They were delicious but very wet and messy to make. I only used about a quarter cup of milk and they were still very loose.
