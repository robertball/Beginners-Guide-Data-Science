This bread was good. I made the following changes: I used unmelted butter and then mixed the cheese along with 1TBSP of whiskey and the walnuts into a spread. I skipped toasting the bread, topped it with the pears then spread on cheese mixture. I baked these at 425 for 10 minutes. They came out perfect! I made them for a party and they were gone in less than 20 minutes.

What a delish crostini! The flavors go together so well. Next time I'll make the pear slices a little thicker- I absolutely love how the pear just melts in your mouth.

I used Naan (indian flat bread) instead of Fr. bread. Saute the pears with sweet yellow onion slices in butter until limp. Then arrange on the flat bread with gorganzola-infused brie and sugar glazed walnuts (or pecans/almonds, etc). Amazing, especially with a nice wine!

use butter the oil is too heavy of a flavor and  changes the taste also though not as nice as the gorgonzola you can use any blue cheese (reg blues are a bit less costly)

This was yumminess.  Not outstanding, but good.  Don't use too much gorgonzola as it's a pretty potent cheese and not everyone enjoys that!  Otherwise, it's an easy appetizer with good flavor.

If only I could give this 6 stars!  I made some of these for Christmas Eve with the family over - these were amazing!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!  Easy and gourmet quality.  I did spray the bread with butter flavor Pam ratheer than using olive oil or butter (trying to cut a few calories) and they came out delish!

Surprisingly non-descript, and I was so excited to try them, too.  Maybe a touch of honey?  I did use my oil-mister for the first time and the bread came out perfect, though.  So, there will be bruschetta in the near future.

I tried this recipe due to all the rave reviews.  I made a bunch of appetizers for dinner as a trial run for our holiday party, and I'm glad I did.  This recipe was very dissapointing.

This was a BIG hit.  The flavors work so well together and it is so easy, no one will believe it.  So...don't tell them!
