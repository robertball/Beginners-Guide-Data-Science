I've cooked my prime rib like this for years ... always delicious!!  One rule of thumb - if you're using a smaller roast - cook at 500F for 5 minutes PER POUND of meat (so a 5lb roast would cook for 25 minutes) and your roast will turn out perfect every time.

Although this would "seem" simple enough, I sit here, fuming, because the lack of experience on this board continues to befuddle me.

I purchased a 3.5lb boneless rib roast.  I let this roast sit for 30+ mins, to achieve room temp.  Following this, I rubbed this roast with the mcormicks steak rub, followed by smothering with dijon mustard.  Because I wasn't 100% sure HOW to cook this, I placed it in a 500 degree oven for 17mins, covered, following the 5mins/lb @ 500 rule.  At 17 mins, the roast hadn't even BEGUN to cook.  Uncovered, and returned to the same oven.  Mild smoke ensued.  Retrieved from oven after 11mins, and let rest to continue to cook. (Approx 15mins)  Began to cut roast, and noticed that, although it "appeared" cooked, the inside was still very very rare.  It is now BACK IN THE OVEN, over 1.5 hours after the original attempt.

People, please, if you have a convec oven, or notice something particular in your cooking, please, please, please post it in your reviews.  I cannot give this recipe a decent review, as the instructions (5mins/lb@500 degrees) are, like I thought, simply untrue.

Loved the garlic and mustard taste. However, as one reviewer noted, this is very easy to overcook, which I did the first time. For those of you who prefer prime rib medium rare or less......I suggest: Preheat to 400, Roast for 1 hour in OPEN pan, in center of oven. Shut off for 2 hours (Also, DO NOT open door) Turn oven back on to 375 for 30-35 minutes. Tighly cover with foil and "rest" meat for 15 minutes before serving.

I used a 5 lb roast.  I cooked it at 400 for 60 minutes and then let it sit for 45. It was a little bit more than medium.  I would probably cook for 45 and let it sit for 45 next time.

I loved this recipe.  I do not understand how some people could have gotten anything but exceptional results with this method.  Now I used a Whopper of a Prime Rib…an 18-pounder.  I compensated for the size by using the 5 minute per # rule and it worked out superbly.  I stuffed tons of garlic cloves into the roast and also used Montreal Seasoning as well as a little extra Lawry’s Seasoned salt because I like it so much.  I cooked my roast at 500 for 90 minutes and let stay in there for an additional 90 minutes after turning off the oven.  Definitely will use this recipe again and I am looking forward to tweaking it here and there to get different flavors.

I made this for the first time on Christmas Eve 2002.  I put it in the preheated oven just as we left home for Xmas Eve services and man did the house smell amazing when we returned home.  Instead of salt and pepper, I use 'Montreal Steak Seasoning' which you can find at Costco.  I believe McCormicks makes it so you might find it in your local grocery store where the spices are.  Be sure to cover with foil before placing in oven.  Otherwise it gets smokey and can set off your smoke alarms...I speak from experience as I have made this at least 6 times in the past 6 months...usually when we entertain.  It gets rave reviews.  I flew some of my husbands friends in from New York for his 40th birthday in March...every single 'man' wanted to go home with this recipe to have their spouse/significant other make it.  It really is SO simple.  Also, if you have a local Meat store/butcher shop, get the rib from them, it's only about $1 more per pound and really does make a difference.  Enjoy!

This recipe is absolutely awesome!  For a previous reviewer, the reason your roast came out raw was because you did not let your roast come to room temperature before cooking.  You need to let it sit out for atleast 1/2 hour before cooking, and you should do this for any roast, but especially for this recipe.

Like many others, I followed the recipe and ended up with barely cooked beef that wasn't particularly flavorful or tender.  I know this receipe does work for some folks and their ovens, but not for me and I wouldn't recommend anyone to take a chance blowing a $50 piece of meat and a holiday meal on this one!  I get far superior results with the method whereby you pack your roast in a bed of Kosher salt, cook high heat for 20-30 minutes then drop down to 325 degrees.
Always tender and flavorful, and no surprises when it's time to eat!

My family loves this recipe.  I do recomend adjusting the temperature for a smaller/larger roast to 500 degrees for 5 min/lb.  Ex. 5 lb roast is 25 min at 500 degrees.  Also make sure your roast is room temp to start, and, make sure you don't have an old oven that might leak heat to fast or this recipe won't work for you.

I was very unsure of the dijonmustard; however, I have not been disappointed with such highly rated recipes this far.  I used a 4lb rib, and roaseted it at 375 in a convection oven for 45 min, then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for another 30 minutes, it came out at 155 degrees, which was perfect.  I served it with an au jus sauce, that contained sauteed mushrooms and onions, also a dill horseradish sauce, and a baked potatoe.  Huge hit.

I used this recipe for two years in a row.  The first year it turned out perfectly, and the second year I ended up with a raw prime rib and a lot of frustration.  The difference... the first year I used an electric oven and the second year I used a gas oven.  My gas oven didn't retain the heat the same way my electric oven did.  If you have a gas oven, you may want to make sure this recipe will work for you.   I've sadly had to find a new way to cook my prime rib, now that we have a gas oven.  Just a word of caution!

I have used a similar recipe for years- we call it never fail roast beef- cause you can't go wrong.  It needs to be made clear that "standing prime rib" means BONE IN!!! I sometimes buy a boneless rib roast-when on sale and then buy the bones seperatley and have the butcher tie them on! It also makes it much easier to carve. The bones hold the heat when you turn the oven off and they continue to cook the roast. This is the reason people in previous negative reviews had undercooked meat.

Here's the lesson I learned for this recipe: Use a meat thermometer BEFORE you put the roast in the oven to make sure that the meat is at room temperature (70 degrees) inside and out. I took my roast out of the frig two hours before I intended to start it cooking. When I went to put it in the oven, the interior temperature was still 41 degrees. I am supposing that is why my 6 1/2 pound roast was not done after 35 minutes at 500 degrees and 90 minutes in a brand new, tightly closed oven. 

With more cooking, it tasted great. The mustard and garlic proportions are just right for our tastes.

We made this for Christmas dinner, and after following the directions exactly, we ended up with an almost raw piece of meat. After researching and reading the reviews, I think we determined the problem - it seems to not work with a gas oven. I think a gas oven cools off a lot more quickly than an electric one.  Our roast was salvaged - we just turned the oven on 375 again and roasted it for about 45 more minutes and it came out fine.  So, I would NOT try this if you have a gas oven.

I would omit the dijon and also cook this at 280 degrees F for a good 2-3 hours or until it is at a medium rare state.  It comes out much tender cooked slower and longer.

Make a batch of au jus in a pot, and if someone wants the meat more well done, place it in the au jus and simmer it in that until it is where they desire.  My father used to sell this as a dinner at his deli with a baked potato, roll and tossed salad - and it would never fail that they would sell out of it.

Just a thought....some people get confused when cooking a smaller roast with the 5 min/pound rule...that rule is for the 500 degree cooking part only, you then have to continue to cook it for 90 minutes after shutting temperature/heat off, in an oven that you NEVER open. Use an oven safe meat thermometer or your oven probe.

I haven't yet had a taste of the rib roast to rate it, but I'm rating anyway.  I followed the 5 lb review.  OMG, it smells good, but I wasn't warned about the smoke!  My whole kitchen and family room are smoked!  My hubby's comment was "at least it smells good."  Will post more later.  Has anyone else had a problem with the smoke or did I do something wrong?  So far, because of the smoke, my rating is as shows.

I am very sorry that I wasted my time as well as my prime rib on this recipe. I had a 10lb roast (with bones...don't know if that makes a difference), after 45 minutes in the 500 degree oven all of our smoke detectors were going wacko (thank goodness our guests were family and therefore forgiving b/c there was a tone of smoke). We had to open several doors, etc to air it out. We put in a roasting pan and covered with foil and a ton if liquid got into the bottom of the oven (not sure how, we had it covered tightly and it fit in the pan). Needless to say, we shut the oven off at 55 minutes and never opened the door. After the 90 minutes with the oven off, the smoke had cleared but our roast was waaaay undercooked, at around 115-120 degrees. After the oven incident, we ended up re-wrapping and putting the grill on medium and trying to cook the roast in there. We finally got a decent temperature, but at that point our roast was pretty much shoe leather. Finally, and this may happen with all prime ribs, I am not really sure, this sucker started out one huge hunk of meat, it was 1/2 the size (lengthwise) when it came out of the oven...and I am not exaggarating....It was litterally half the size! Anyhow, next time I think we are going to order pizza for New Year's Eve, and when we want prime rib we will go to J. Alexander's (our favorite restaurant).

I am a young wife with little experiance in cooking, the prime rib was an excellent Easter dinner.  I made 5lbs. at 400 degrees for 45 min. then 1 hour 15 mins with the over off.  Three adults ate and we still had left overs.

Err on the short side of the time.  The first time I made this the roast was well done.  It really cooks much faster than you think.  The flavor was great.

I tried this method but I was afraid the prime rib would not cook.  Here are my facts.  I had a 4.22lb prime rib roast with the ribs cut off and tied back on.  I used a gas oven and I did not open the oven at all.  I cooked the prime rib at 500 ° for 25 mins before turning the oven off.  I inserted a remote thermometer from the begining.  I didn't realize I could see my oven temp thermometer through the door until the oven had been off about an hour and 15 minutes and the oven temp was only 125 and the roast was only 112 degrees.  I then turned the oven on to 300° and when the roast temp reached 135° I removed it from the oven.  While resting the temp continued to climb to 143°.  I have times and temps throughout the cooking period, but I can't display it, because allrepices will not allow the formating.  Rst turned out very good, if you like it medium.  I would have perfered it more bloody, I should have removed it from the oven sooner or not turned the oven up to 300, maybe only 250° would have worked.

This was a very tasty dish.  Note:  garlic provided taste to the outside of the meat.  You need to insert small slivers into the middle of the meat.  Also, when changing the weight, it was difficult to adjust cooking times given the two stages of cooking.  For 5 lbs we cooked for 45 mins, then let sit in the oven for 60 mins.  This seemed to result in medium meat.

Have a newer oven, let roast set out for an hour (room temp.), cooked 500 degrees at 5 min. per pound, let rib roast set in unopened oven for 90 minutes.  Outside was perfect, inside wasn't even 130 degrees.  Had to turn oven back to 325 degrees and cook about an 1 hr longer to reach rare temp.

I have never left a review and I have used many recipes from this website.  I was very nervous after reading everyone's review.  I made the prime rib exactly as described (5 min/lb) and then let it set for 90 min, and perfection.  Everyone loved it!!  Thank you for a great experience!!

When I bought the prime rib, I had absolutely no idea on how to cook it. I logged on to allrecipes.com and found this recipe. I admit that I was skeptical (mustard on a $100 cut of meat??) but I told myself to trust the process, my peeps at allrecipe.com have yet to fail me and I'm glad I did! This was by far the best prime rib I have ever had. I followed the cooking directions to the letter (this is a MUST) and it was hard not to open the oven during the 90 minute wait but I made it through and with spectacular results! I used horseradish mustard and montreal steak seasoning instead of what the recipe called for. Yes, there was smoke but I knew what to expect (this is why I read reviews) so it was not big deal, just open a few windows and kick on the ceiling fan. My husband thought I was crazy with the mustard so we made two prime ribs - he smoked one and the one I made - mine was the hands down favorite - try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This is great!  I made this on Christmas day and again New Years day. It is that good!  Remember- 5 mins. per pound at 500 degrees.  Use a thermometer for best results.  I made a paste with the mustard- using minced garlic from a jar, and tons of Montreal Steak Seasonings (a favorite year round) and garlic salt.  Very tasty!  My husband hates roast beef- after a childhood full of bland, dry ones- and loves this.  This is a keeper!! Remember--5 minutes per pound at 500 degrees then turn the oven OFF and DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN FOR TWO HOURS. Perfect every time.

We have always roasted our prime this way, and found it to be the surest defense against dry meat! Searing in the juices ensures that the meat stays moist and holds the flavor of your marinade. Just a quick heads-up: this method also does womders for a roasting chicken or a Thanksgiving turkey!

I used a 5 lb roast. I cooked it at 400 for 45 minutes and then let it sit for 45. Came out medium rare in the middle and medium on the ends. Perfect for me. I only checked on the roast once and that was right before I turned off oven. I followed all the same seasoning directions as in original directions. Not sure why other folks had an issue with meat not being cooked or oven smoking up the house (maybe an unclean oven?). My guest raved: "This is the best!"

First of all I am not a cook by any means!!  But I wanted something different for our early family Christmas party.  My cousin suggested a Prime Rib roast ... I used this recipe for the temp and cooking time for my 10 lb. roast.  I took it out of the fridge and let it sit out (still wrapped) for about 2-3 hours and cooked according to directions.  The thermometer read 145 when I took it out.  I just used Montreal Steak Seasoning but not enough - and that is my fault.  But the meat still tasted good, and was tender!

I tried this recipe for our Christmas dinner last year, it was a HUGE success. The prime rib turned out so delicious and juicy. I had bought 15lbs, rather than the 10 lbs which the recipe call for. I calculated leaving the meat for additional 5 minutes for each pound; so for my 15 pounder, I let it cook for an additional 25 minutes. It turned out great. Hopefully it's a tip you all can use.

I followed the advice of the gentleman who used a 4 lb roast at 400 for 45/45 and it was perfect!  I would even leave out the garlic next time to savor the flavor of the meat only.

Cooked this yesterday for Christmas dinner.  While the flavor was fabulous, I didn't notice any other reviewers having the same problem I had which was with the oven temperture.  At 500 degrees once the drippings hit the pan I had a MAJOR smoke problem.  It was pouring out the burner vent and when I opened the oven door there was an incredible woosh of smoke.  I had to open every door and window.  I ended up turning the oven down and then off much sooner.  It did come out fine in the end (everyone raved) but I might monkey around with the oven temps next time.

I highly recommend this recipe. It was my first time cooking prime rib and I was very apprehensive about leaving it alone in the oven. I followed the 5 min. per pound rule for my 5 pound roast (25 min. at 500 degrees) and then turned off the over and left it for 60 min. instead of 90. Also, I did mine in a cast iron roasting pot, lid on, in a regular oven.
I also tented it in tinfoil and let it rest for 15 min. after removing it from the oven. It came out medium/well put was super moist. Perfectly cooked. If you want it a bit more rare, maybe cut down the time a bit more. 

An excellent and easy way to cook prime rib!

Yummy! Made it on New Years Day.  Used 5lb top sirloin and halved the ingredients and cooking time.  Came out moist, tender, and medium rare.  (Make sure your oven is really clean or you will smoke up your kitchen at the high temps).

The secret is making Prime Rib for 2.  Use the basics listed here on a four lb. roast...pop into a 450 degree oven, reduce heat to 350 and cook 20 minutes per pound.  Let rest 15 minutes....Carve off the bone and make Prime Rib Soup with it.

I've coooked my roasts this way for years, but make a rub of dry mustard and butter.  The trick (sipmplicty 123) is DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR until the cooking time is done and it has been left in the oven for a further hour........by opening the door you distrub the cooking process, be patient........I cook for Med rare, 9 min per lb at 500......then let it sit for an hour......and yes you will have some smoke......but don't panic.  (rare cook for 7 min/lb for well done 10 min/lb.

This is a great recipe...HOWEVER>>>>if you open the oven door at all, you totally ruin your effort. The cooking is managed with the high heat of the oven and the time lapse. This meat is too expensive to not investigate the method if you are unsure.

Absolutely amazing!!!! I was a little scared of making this because #1 I had never attempted prime rib before and #2 I was making it for a packed house.  I was thrilled with the results!! It came out juicy and tender and made incredible sandwiches the next day!! My family has been begging me to make this again.

My son-in-law bought a prime rib for Christmas and I used this recipe.  As many of the reviewers had used Montreal Seasoning, I bought some and mixed that in too.  I made sure to have the roast at room temperature prior to cooking and to use a covered pan while cooking it.  It came out perfect and everyone loved it.  The smells coming out of the kitchen while it was cooking was enough to make everyone starving.  Very easy and very good.  Thanks.

OMG! Like many others I too made this for Christmas dinner. So tender so succulent. My husband raved about this and if you use the drippings to make a sauce yummy yummy. Good with horseradish sauce or without. I stongly suggest that if you go the uncovered route to make sure your oven is clean, due to the fact intense heat may make your oven smoke out. This recipe goes great with the Make Ahead potatoes found on this site.

I used the reviewer's suggestion of 5 minutes at 500 degrees per pound.  I had a 4.2# roast that I sprinkled liberally with garlic powder and sea salt then rubbed it in with olive oil.  I did not have any mustard.  It was AWESOME.  Perfectly Medium Rare, pink all the way through, and delicious.

Excellent!  I took the advice of others and cooked 6 minutes per pound at 500 degrees since I had a 7 lb. roast.  I also rubbed the roast with 1 tsp of each: salt, pepper, garlic powder & onion powder.  Will definitely make again.

Made this for xmas dinner.  I started with a 14 pound roast which was 5 ribs.  I did what another reviewer suggested and used the 5 minute per pound rule and put it into a 500 degree oven for 70 minutes.  I had a thermometer in the oven with the panel on the outside and the temperature had dropped below 120 within 45 minutes after I turned the oven off.  I have a gas oven and am wondering if they are worse at holding residual heat than electric ovens.  I turned the oven back on to 225 and left it there for the remaining 45 minutes.  Despite the oven cooling and having to be reheated, the roast was fabulous!

I've used this recipe many times on various sizes of meat and it always comes out perfect. I follow the directions (60min./10= 6 min/lb. cooking,90min./10= 9 min/lb.) I keep my oven clean and have never had a problem with smoke.

Don't know where I went wrong! I read all the reviews. Put my 5 lb roast in the oven at 500 for 25 minutes then let sit for 90 min or so.  Came out cooked about 1" into the meat and the rest was absolutely raw. Then baked at 350 for 45 min hoping to save this $55 roast - but no luck.  I'd never try this method again!

I was skeptical about the mustard, but it gave the roast a wonderful, subtle flavor... this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Super easy to assemble and bake, too!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for Christmas Dinner, and it was the first Time I made Prime Rib .. ever. What a hit. Everyone raved!  I had a 12 lb Prime Rib, I cooked it on 500 (covered) for 70 minutes, and then turned off the oven for 95+ minutes and it came out perfect. Due to the cut of the meat, I had well-done to med-rare and that pleased everyone.  This will be the ONE recipe that I used EVERY time I make Prime Rib from now on! Thanks!! (as we are now enjoy prime rib sandwich leftovers too)

I have over cooked prime rib in the past, as I looked for new way of cooking, I found this recipe.  It turned out perfect.  I cut down the time a bit , and I was so excited the way it turned out.  My guest were amazed and everyone wanted my recipe.  I loved it!

I made this almost to the letter of the recipe.  I cooked it at 500 for 40 min's (5 min's per lb)  Then shut the oven off for 2 hours and it was perfect.  If you like your rare which we do.  Will cook my prime rib like this every time.

As rule of thumb I don't like this style of cooking prime rib. However, if you do make it this way it is very important that you take your roast out of the refrigerator at least an hour before cooking . . . two is better.  I like to have the internal temp. at around 60 - 70 degrees when I put them in the oven.

We cooked a 7 lb prime rib and cooked it for 5 minutes per lb at 500 degrees and then let it sit for 1 hour in the oven with the temperature turned off never opening the door.  Then we let it sit out for 15 minutes before slicing and it was one of the best prime ribs we have ever made.  We seasoned it with garlic salt, pepper and garlic seasoning.  PERFECT!!!!

I have ruined very expensive prime ribs in the past, so I was anxious to obey all the rules of this recipe.  I have to say it was the absolute BEST prime rib I've ever cooked!   My husband who is quite the steak connoisseur actually reacted with a surprised, delighted "This is better than any restaurant prime we've had!"   I created a paste of mesquite, italian and various other savory spice seasonings with olive oil, coated the entire prime and then followed the recipe.  Just before serving, I warmed it at 350 for 15.  PERFECT medium rare...and TENNNNNDER!!! MMM!

The BEST. Even better than some restaurants who seem to treat this like a regular roast. The key is DO NOT open your oven after the specified cooking time! Leave it in there for the 90 min. without peeking! I've made this without letting it come to room temp and is still very good. Prime rib isn't supposed to be done all the way thru..well, not well-done. Have made it this way using a cranberry mustard too. yum. I always give this recipe when asked how in the world I got such a good prime rib. Thank you!

I made this yesterday for Christmas. I was afraid to use the dijon because I didn't know if my guests would like it. I was freaking out over cook times. I looked in several sites, here, and then also tried Martha Stewart and Food Network. I went with Stewarts as far as bringing the 10 lb roast that I used, to room temp for TWO HOURS. I put the roast in a 450 degree oven for 15 minutes, then dropped the temp to 325, for 1 hr 45 min., inserted thermometer and it was at 140 degrees.  Took it out let it sit about 20 min and it was perfect medium rare. Seven people devoured a 10 lb roast.  No leftovers

This is a wonderful recipe! I have tried several versions of cooking prime rib with many of the recipes on All Recipes. What I would suggest to ALL, is placing FRESH rosemary atop the roast. I donn't see rosemary in any of your resipes. Amazing! I would Never cook a prime rib without using rosemary.

I thought this roast was amazing!  My guests were raving about it all night. The mustard gives that extra "oomph"! Not only that, but it was soooo easy! For those who had trouble with it being undercooked I would suggest a meat thermometer.  I too had issues with the cooking time but since ovens are different and some prefer there beef cooked "a little more" I always trust the meat thermometer.  Super recipe. Thanks!

I see no need to use the mustard. I rubbed kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. I make slits in the prime rib roast and stuff with garlic all over. This is all you need to do. Cook in 500* oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temp to 325*  Then use a meat thermometer to gauge the correct timing.145 to 150 degrees for medium. 135 to 140 for rare. If you follow these instructions you will not go wrong. Note: Use kosher salt like a paste, about a cup or more. The meat will not be salty but will give you a nice brown crust.

This recipe was GREAT! So easy and delicious. I was a bit hesitant with the dijon mustard, but it was great. I cooked my 5lb for 30 min at 500 and let it sit for 1 1/2 hours after shutting the oven off. It was a bit rare. Next time I will do the 5 lb. for 45 min. at 500 and then let it sit for about the same time. Everyone loved it and it was soo easy!

This was a hit for those who liked their prime rib well done. I like mine on the rarer side. I didn't have any problems with smoke, however next time I will reduce the time that the roast is in the oven. I used a 4 lb roast and will not peak for 60 minutes. Although it was cooked more than I would have liked, it was still very tender.

My suggestion is to cook at 475 for about half hour, then bring it down to 375 until desired doneness. Don't forget, take it out before you have it to your desired doneness. It will keep cooking while it rests.

I am an experienced cook and I have always wanted to try this recipe. It was disappointing for the following reasons. I had an 8 pound prime rib at room temp. I cooked for 40 minutes at 500 and left it for 90 minutes. The house was full of smoke (my oven is clean), the roast turned out to be medium well on the first 1/3 of the slice and rare in the end of the same slice ! I gues this is fine if you really want to have different degrees of doneness but I wanted medium rare throughout. I will not make it this way again. I will just roast it at 350 until the proper temp. Usually about 1.5 hours for a roast this size.

Easy!  We were a little nervous about cooking a $90 prime rib for the first time, but it came out PERFECT!!!!  We ordered a 10# roast with the bone on.  We just took it out of the fridge 3 hours before roasting, sprinkled on some s & p (didn't do the garlic or the mustard) and followed the directions exactly.  I usually only care for the rare part of the meat, but on this roast even the well-done ends were succulent.  The meat browns even though it's covered.  The smell was incredible.  Every person was "oooohing" and "aaaaahing!"  Great recipe!

Loved this recipe but I had to change the roasting method because I realized that I would not have been able to bake my appetizer since the oven could not be opened! Glad I thought of that before I started! I wanted to mention that we LOVED the seasoning with the mustard. I cooked a 7.5 lb roast and I stuffed in 8 garlic cloves slivered, sprinkled with Montreal Steak Seasoning and the Dijon mustard. I laid fresh thyme sprigs on top. Roasted in covered pan @ 500* for 20 minutes, uncovered and continued @ 350* about 15 mins per pound. It was very rare and everyone LOVED it!!

I've cooked my prime rib like this for years with awesome results. ALWAYS allow the roast to come to room temperature before placing into the oven. I don't use the mustard, and I generously cover the roast with McCormicks Steak seasoning salt.  I also have a remote thermometer that allows me to keep a close eye on what my roast is doing. Our family always requests that I cook the roast!!

I let the roast come to room temperature, rubbed it with Kosher salt, didn't use the mustard and left it in just a couple of minutes longer. It came out absolutely PERFECTLY medium rare. I no longer have any fear of spending such a large amount of money on a cut of meat. Thanks!

After reading some of the reviews, i was skeptical of the outcome of this recipe, but i got the courage and tried it 2 nights ago.  I made a few mods to the cooking time though, keeping in mind that i have an electric oven...I had a 12lbs pork ribs, i had them cook @ 500 for 60 minutes, then i turned off the oven and let the oven do its magic, after an hour and 15 minutes, i turne the oven back on to 250 degrees and had it cook for anothe 30 minutes and turned it off and let it sit in the oven for 10 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR! the ribs turned out PERFECT!!!! My friend said those were the best ribs he had, i personally thought it needed a little more flavor.  but the outcome of the meat texture was really an A++

Great recipe.  It was a hit with my teens and boyfriend.  This was a run thru for Christmas eve. I used a 4lb standing roast. As suggested, I cooked it at 500 for 20 mins. Let sit in the oven for 60 minutes. It was a little too rare for us, I will let it sit in the oven for an additional 15-30 next time. 
I used jar minced garlic rather than fresh and at least a half cup of dijon.

Excellent ideas in this recipe. I cooked the roast 5 min per pound at 500 and then left it sit for 90 min in the oven.  I didn't have any mustard, so rather than the seasonings, I used Montreal Steak seasoning. I made a basic au jus to finish the slices to peoples liking. it was a hit. There was very little leftover.  What was left, was so tender, it could be eaten cold.

This was so good my family has requested it for Christmas dinner this year. Using a meat thermometer is the key. I did not use mustard I used garlic and steakhouse pepper blend mixed with olive oil.

This came out excellent. Followed the timing and directions. Let the roast come to room temperature first (about 45 min) before cooking. If you take it righ out of the fridge, it will be undercooked.

Excellent!  I put the roast out on the counter for 1 hour before putting it into the oven.  (I cleaned the oven first.)  12# roast, I cooked 70 min. and turned it off.  It was so good.  Everybody loved it.  I liked that this one was roasted with a cover.  In the past I had done Prime Rib in an open roasting pan (as per other recipes) and my oven was always a MESS afterwards and it was always so smokey.  I dind't have a bit of problem with smoke.  I'll definitely do this again.

My husband and I both loved this prime rib recipe.  My husband, who normally adds horseradish to all beef dishes, left it out this time stating it didn't need it!  I served this with wild mushroom risotto and a green salad.  Yum.  (Our 4-year-old wouldn't try it, but that left more for the rest of us.)  :)

Extremely pleased with this one.  In addition to being easy and delicious, leftovers could not be better.  Will definitely use over and over again especially for guests and special occasions.  Will cut back on cook time about 15 minutes the next time.

I have never been happier with the results of a recipe in my life! I followed it to the letter and it  was perfect. I have cooked many rib roasts but the meat never came out with the right taste or consistency. This was better than any I have eaten out. All I can say is thank you, thank you, and thank you, for this recipe!

Excellent recipe! This is the best prime rib I have ever eaten!  Tips: meat has to be at room temp before cooking and 5 min per pound at 500F does work ONLY if the meat is at room temp.  Will make again and again!

For the seeming very frustrated simplicity123, I am giving this recipe a 4 star due to the reason's you mentioned to this recipe.  Not because it is a bad recipe but it seems to me that the recipe might not include a bit of information about this cut of meat that is important: it is traditionally served extremely rare, hence the very high temperature for a short period of time. (my mother adds a bit more depth in flavor by searing the cut off very quickly on a high grill first before setting it in an oven YUM) Anyway, despite tradition if you like it more well done, do so to your taste of course =) however, I would suggest that you leave the foil ON the meat to speed the cooking process as the very high temperature of the oven will, indeed, scorch the fats and smoke out your kitchen (HAHAHA, fire alarm time, one of the joys of learning to cook, no?) Hope I helped, and that you wont be discouraged from trying this recipe again as its a tasty one.

Cooked perfectly.  The only addition that I would make is to add more herbs such as rosemary and thyme or your favorite, and insert a meat thermometer in the middle of the roast to determine when to remove the meat from the oven (rare=125F, med rare=130F, med=140F, med well=150).  The meat will be more done towards the sides, so give those cuts to those who like the meat done more than the middle cuts.

Some reviewers (e.g. simplicity123) did not follow the directions and complained that the roast wasn't cooked.  You have to turn the oven off after cooking for 5 minutes / pound and leave the roast in the oven for 90 minutes to finish cooking.  Adjust the cooking time for how you like it (rare, medium rare, medium).  Use a meat thermometer!

The only reason that I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because I like more herbs.  Rosemary and thyme go wonderfully with dijon mustard.

Did it for 7 minutes per pound at 500 degrees.  Then turned it off and left it for the 90 minutes.  It didn't get cooked well enough so bumped it up to 350 for a few additional minutes.  Had a thermometer in it so we could monitor it through the window without opening the door.  Was a great recipe and a big hit with all for Christmas dinner.  Will be repeating it for sure.

I made this for New Years Eve dinner for our family. It was fabulous and tasted just like a restraunt's. Get your roast from a good meat market.  OMG though, this cut of meat is so greasy. Not when you eat it but the cleanup! It took me twice as long as normal to clean up the kitchen afterwards!

Made for Christmas Eve dinner last year and tasted amazing although the house smelt of garlic for days and I don't think people enjoyed sitting next to us at church after we ate because we wreaked of garlic.  I loved it!

Okay, the flavor was awesome when I got it to cook completely so a five star on that...however, it did not cook at all.  A fellow reviewer pointed out that you need to start with the roast at room temperature...that was my mistake--I had it in the fridge.  Next time I will use your seasonings but cook for 500 for 30 minutes and then 325 for 10-15 minutes per lb if I have it in the fridge.  Although, I may try it one more time the correct way.

We were given a gift of a rib roast and I had never before cooked one. This recipe was extremely simple. The aroma alone was heavenly,  but it probably cooked alittle too long because it was slightly overcooked. Even still, we had it for Easter dinner 2001 and it was delicious! We can't wait to have it again. Leftovers were wonderful too!!

A perfect NO FAIL ALWAYS PERFECT recipe. Just make sure not to peek in the oven. I use a digital thermometer though to make sure the center is rare.

Have made this numerous times.    Mostly with bone in roasts.   I add fresh rosemary and thyme to top of roast after covering with Dijon mustard.   I also use the 5 mins per pound process for smaller roasts.    I have covered and not covered roast - with same results.   When I don't cover - the roast is a little more crunchy on the outside (which we like)   Enjoy !!   This is a definite keeper....

Cooked perfectly. Thanks for the tip! I would add ALOT more seasoning though.. I doubled what was in the recipe and it still didn't enhance the flavor.

This is great and quick have used this recipe the last 4 New Years and it is always great, though I have had to adjust the time a few minutes due to the size we usually do but always a great Prime Rib

This sounded so good, but cooking it this way didn't work for me.  I had a 4 lb roast and cooked it 5 min per pound and let it sit for 90 min.  It was not done.  We like rare, but this was way too rare!  I had to cook the slices on the stove to finish them up.    Also, I didn't like how the mustard crust wasn't crispy.  It was soft and soggy since the pan was covered.  Without a lid it would have crisped up nicely.  I'll keep looking for a prime rib recipe.

I used this recipe last year & loved it. I had never cooked a prime rib roast before & it was absolutely perfect. In reading some of the other reviews, it seems like the people that didn't like it couldn't leave the oven door closed. The 5 minutes per pound rule works @ 500 degrees & 90 minutes after that & DON'T PEEK !!!

I used a meat thermometer all during cooking. After rubbing with dijon and a good sprinkling of montreal seasoning I put my 4lb. roast in a 500 degree convection oven for 30 minutes and turned off the oven until my thermometer read 145 degrees, approx 2 hours. It was wonderfully rare with a crusty covering over the largest side of the roast. The roast rested 20 minutes before carving to let the juices redistribute throughout. My guests loved it.

I didn’t have any dijon in the pantry so I tried horseradish mustard mixed with a little honey. It was ok but I would stick to dijon.

recipe good. i just didn't trust that it would be done at 145. my husband bought the cut of meat and chopped it in half. ended up only having a 1.5 pound rib to cook tonight. i had no idea how to adjust the cooking times and temps for such a small cut of meat so i followed others' suggestions. i baked at 500 for 10 minutes (5 min/lb) and had the meat therm in it the whole time. shut it off at 10 min and let it go till it climbed to  150 (about an hour). i was afraid of under cooking it and i shouldn't have been. the taste was good with the garlic and mustard, but it was definitely over cooked :(  at least we have the other half to do better on. thanks for the good recipe!

Excellent!  Thank you.  My Prime Rib Dinner was a huge success with the meat a perfect medium rare, edge to edge.

Now I can make this "dining out" meal at home for those special occasions.

I scaled this down for 3 people using a 5 lb. roast and had plenty left over.  Everyone wanted medium to medium well so I cooked it at 400 degrees for 50 minutes, turned off oven for 45 minutes and it turned out well.  Personally, I'm not a big mustard fan so I would use a little less and I also might used garlic powder mixed in with the salt and pepper.  I felt that slivered garlic flavored the immediate surrounding meat too strongly - plus everyone ended up picking out the garlic anyway.

I only used about 2.5 pounds, and did not scale the cooking time, so it came out way well done, but it still had good flavor.  Thanks!

This was just about perfect for a 7 lb roast. I added 15 minutes in a 300 oven after 90 minutes because we like it a little more done, and it came out a perfect medium. Also, it takes around 6 hours for a large piece of meat to come to room temperature from the fridge. If you forget to put it out early (like I did), bring it to room temp before cooking by double bagging the roast in ziplock bags and submerge it in warm water for 15 or 20 minutes. You can check the internal temp with a meat thermometer to make sure it's around 70 degrees before cooking.

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner and adjusted according to reviews.  I had a 4.6 lb roast.  I cooked it at 500 for 22 minute and then let it sit for an hour without opening the oven.  I had a meat thermometer in it while it was cooking and it was only 95 degrees after 60 minutes.  So I cooked it at 375 for an additional 45 minutes (until the meat thermometer reached 140).  I took the roast out of the oven and the outside did not sear and the color was not very appetizing.  I am not sure if my oven door did not seal properly or if the roast should have been at room temperature before cooking.  I'll try this again but I will not use as much dijion mustard if any at all.  Meat was very tender but did not come out medium rare.  Was more like medium.

I tried this recipe with a 5 pound roast, cooked for 30min then left in for 60min.  Roast was not done yet (130f), cooked for an additional 20 minutes at 375 and roast was medium-rare(140f).  Flavor was excellent (I did rub with "Famous Daves Steak and Burger Seasoning" before applying mustard)!

Yup... this was awesome... I made a 4lb prime rib and roasted it at 500 for 20 mins and then turned the oven off... but then I had to turn it back on again at 400 for quite a bit longer b/c it was no where near  160 internal... so plan for it to take longer than you might expect.

I didn't have any garlic cloves so I mixed minced garlic in with the dijon mustard and spread it on, also I used montreal steak spice instead of the salt and pepper. I'm sure this would have been very good if I had used a 10lb roast but unfortunately I had a 2lb roast and I completely overcooked it. I set the oven temperature at 500 degrees to start and then tested the meat with a meat thermometer after 30 minutes. It was close to being rare at that point so I turned the oven temperature down to 375 degrees and kept it in for another half hour. When I took out my roast the meat thermometer reading was way above well done. What a disappointment for a person who likes it medium to medium rare! It was edible but not close to being as good as it could have been.

It was a waste of a very expensive cut of meat. It was overdone and lacked the flavour that everyone has raved about. I think I will go back to my old way of doing this.

Dale this rocked but I agree with the last post Laurilan, we made it for Christmas and after following your instructions EXACTLY, it was still mooing ;) We had a lot of fun all hanging out at the "meat seat" near the un-opened oven and even concocted a "meat diary" of how blessed long we cooked it. It was quite amusing entertainment value on Christmas eve. Just allow a bunch of time when you attempt this because it sure needed it even for a medium doneness. OK...One hour at 500 in a CLEAN oven to prevent smoking, covered roast with foil. Turn oven off then LEAVE OVEN CLOSED for 90 minutes. Then turn oven up to 200 and cook for half hour, 300 for another half hour, 350 for another half hour. This was a 7.5 pound roast and this extravaganza took a total of 4 HOURS to get the internal temp up to 140. It was worth every minute. Thanks for the recipe, Dale.

This was very easy to make and it came out perfect.  The only thing I would change is omit the the Dijon Mustard I didn't think it gave it any flavor.  I would just rub the roast with garlic salt, and pepper the night before and store in refrigerator over night covered.

I minced the garlic and added it to the Dijon.  It was still scrumptious.

My fiance won a 5 lb. rib roast in a pool tournament on New Year's Eve.  I had never cooked a rib roast, so I went searching for an easy recipe.  This won worked great -- I had the ingredients on hand and prep time was minimal.  The results were fantastic.  The only thing missing was what the core temperature should be, which I found in the Joy of Cooking.  We had a fabulous New Year's Day meal with minimal fuss.  Thanks!

I was disappointed with this method of cooking my expensive prime rib.  It was too rare.  My oven had cooled and too late to reheat it.  We were so hungry we ate it anyway.  Next time I'll cook it at the 500 temp another half hour.

Excellent recipe!  This was my first stab at prime rib, and the cooking time was *just right*  I used a bone-in cut, and was generous with seasoning.  Key is to let it sit in the oven--tough to do!  Also, have an oven thermometer so you are sure of oven's temp.  It helps!

I cooked a 3.25 lb. prime rib for 30/30 at 400 degrees. It was rare, too rare.  When I finally got it cooked to medium it was dry, very dry.

Very easy and tasty. Made this for Thanksgiving because we do not like turkey. The only complaint was the price of the prime rib, which is not the recipe's fault. I will make this again.

Way undercooked. I used a 7.5 pound roast at 500 for 45 minutes and 2.5 hors in oven turned off. I like rare, but it was still cold inside. On the plus side, it was delicious. We cut off the outside, and recooked the rest. Will try again with longer cook time.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out wonderful! I was a little nervous that it wouldn't turn out and didn't add quite as much Dijon as it called for, but next time would add the entire 1/2 cup for more flavor.  I did need to lower the oven temperature to 450-475 due to smoking at the higher temp, but it came out just perfect in the end.

Tried this and I will never make it another way. I didn't use the dijon because it just didn't sound right - just kept it simple with salt and pepper. I had a 5lb roast that wasn't quite up to room temperature so I I put it in at 450 until it reached about 70 degrees on the inside. Then I turned it up to 500 and cooked it for 45 minutes and shut it off. I had the probe inside so I knew exactly when to take it out but it was about a 45 minutes later. Amazing! Perfectly medium. Medium rare would be easy though with the temp probe.

We read many of the comments before trying this and finally settled on convection roast at 400 degrees for 45 minutes for a 4.79 lb. roast.  Then we let it sit in the still hot but turned off oven for 45 minutes.  It was PERFECT.  Medium rare in the middle and both ends were medium.

This was my first attempt at Prime Rib & let me tell you, the whole family thought I was a pro... mom, dad, aunt, cousins, sisters, etc..
Great recipe and very easy!  I didn't measure everything out, but followed the instructions as they were written.  A meat thermometer is KEY to making your prime rib right.

I would rate this a three only because I listened to others and used Montreal Seasoning on the outside and unfortunately it made the pan drippings way too salty to make a decent gravy. It cooked pretty much perfectly...I had a 15# boneless prime rib. I covered it and cooked it for 85 mins then left it in the oven for another 90 mins. The ends were pretty well done but the middle was rare and perfect. May try a long, slow roast next year w/ plain old salt and pepper so I can get a nice gravy.

My little roast was 3lbs. I put in in covered with foil on a grid in a roasting pan at 500 for 45 mins figuring 15 mins a lb for medium. I tested it and it was 160 as required for medium and I left it sit for the recommended hour. I just took it out and we carved it and it was RARE RARE RARE so it went back in :( UNcovered at this point in time. I am so interested in that reviewer who suggested 5 mins per lb for a small roast. Do you like your roast very rare? I don't think you said. After 30 mins at 350 it was cooked medium rare.

Make sure your roast is completely thawed.  I had a hard time finding a covered pan that would fit a 10 lb. roast.

Excellent!  I've been following this recipe for a couple years now, and it turns out great every time.  I typically don't start with 10#, since I'm only cooking for two.  Weigh out your roast and multiply the weight, in pounds, by five.  Use that for the time the oven is 'on'.  Always let it stand for 2hrs, no matter the weight.  Also, make sure your oven door seals well.  Old ovens can lose temperature quickly due to poor seals or insulation.  So, five minutes per pound at 500°F, and let stand in oven two hours. Do not peak!! You'll lose the residual heat! Enjoy!

Rule of thumb, “Bone in”make it 7 minutes per pound, shut the oven off and don’t open for Two Hours.   I can’t believe I actually read a review where Simplicity123 said they couldn’t give this a good review because they couldn’t follow directions and leave the  oven closed

Simple recipe to follow and good results. I tweaked the cooking times for the oven to 10 minutes + ( 5 minutes * weight of the roast in pounds) - in my case 30 minutes - at 450 and then 40 minutes at 325 without opening the oven.

Recipe calls for 10#; however, I used a 3.5-4#.  I only seasoned with salt and pepper (that's the way I like it).  I was skeptical about cooking an hour at 500 degrees, but I followed the cooking instructions TO THE TEE, and this was SUPERB.  I have tried various cooking methods--this turned out exactly how I get it in a restaurant.  I like mine rare; my husband likes medium-rare.  We got the best of both worlds.

Delicious - but watch your roasts weight. My roast was about 5 pounds so time had to be adjusted but absolutely melt in the mouth good.

Works really well - If using smaller roast you will need to reduce 1st cooking time.

Easy to make and the rub and rosemary are good compliments for this who love the taste of beef.

I always use the high temperature roast beef recipe method found on this sight , make small slits in the roast, insert minced garlic, paint the roast with gravy master ( found in the gravy aisle, little orange bottle), season with salt and fresh ground pepper. You really can't mess it up. ENJOY!

This was fantastic. I use a digital thermometer and it makes everything so easy. I did cook it at 500 F for 30 minutes (5 mins per lb) but then I dropped it to 325 and kept an eye on the thermometer. I pulled it out at 126 F, covered it in tin foil and let it rest ~ 30 minutes (it was so hard to wait). The final temp was 137 F and on the rare side (we like it that way). 

Great dinner!

I often find to follow someone else's recipes I have to tweak a little to be successful.
I didn't have it warmed to room temp and I was cooking for a crowd and not sure if they were med-rare people so I took the chance and did the following:
 500F for TWO hrs (versus 1 hr) then turned off oven for the 90 min recommended. I couldn't have been more pleased and yes I will make it again. It was succulent with just a hint of pink, melt in your mouth delish!

Well, I followed this recipe to a 't' but the meat still wasn't done enough and we like med.rare beef. Anyway, I ended up keeping the roast in the oven at 225 for about another 40 minutes and then it was fine. Only prob...guests had to wait for their Xmas meal. Another prob...even with a very clean oven, house still smoked up!

Followed directions to the letter, way under cooked! Thermometer didn't even make it to 120 degrees. Ended up slicing it and cooking it under the broiler. Will find a different recipe next time.

Just fixed our 13lb Christmas rib using this recipe. It was by far the best so far. Used montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I had to give the roast another 30 mins at 400 degrees at the end, as the center temp was only 125. Took it out at 145 degrees and had medium to medium rare for everyone. The mustard adds a great taste!
