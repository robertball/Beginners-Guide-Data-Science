Very tasty!  I love peanut butter, but I don't like peanut butter pies that have the cream cheese fluff. This pie has lots of peanut butter flavor without being too rich. I couldn't get the egg whites with sugar to form stiff peaks - they were more like marshmallow fluff, but it baked up fine. I'll definitely use this recipe again. I may recommend putting it in a chocolate crumb crust. I referred my mom to the recipe and she let me know that you can make the custard easily in the microwave.  Just stir it after a minute or two until it's thickened. So much easier!

I use whole eggs in the custard and do NOT top with the meringue.  Everyone requests that I bring this to all pot-lucks!

I've made this recipe for years, but I only use 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar on the bottom mixture.  I use Cool Whip on the top, and sprinkle it with Peanut Butter/Confectioner's sugar mixture.

I've been making this recipe for years, and it's excellent.  I also use this basic recipe, along with some homemade peanut butter cookies and whipped Cream, to make a killer trifle!

Directions are perfect, so the result is a delicious treat.  Remember to cut small slices as this is intended to be a rich pie.  This is a real peanut butter pie and the cooked custard is the proof!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

If you're looking for a cream pie that has a powerful p.b. flavor, try Peanut Butter Pie I.  This one was a fine pie, though.  The cream layer takes about 10 min to thicken on medium heat, another 10 to get the egg whites to the hard peak stage; the recipe is worth the time.  The only change I made was to use an Oreo crust at the behest of my husband.  :)

I wonder if that Florida restaurant was Bradenton's Amish restaurant Miller's Dutch Kitchen.  This looks and tastes just like it. I can't tell you how many times I bought a slice to go for my husband.  If he was with we were too full we would still buy a slice to go!

Just what I was hoping for.  Followed directions exactly and got the perfect peanut butter pie...the only thing that might make it better...chocolate custard?  Maybe next time.

To.  Die.  For.  Seriously, like restaurant quality.  Very very sweet.  Made it exactly as the recipe reads, except I only left enough PB crumbles to sprinkle on top of the meringue, maybe 1/4 cup is all you need.  The rest goes in the pie.  Awesome.

This was a great peanut butter pie! Very rich... I wasn't crazy about my store bought crust though. It would have been even better with a better crust.

This is honestly one of the best recipes I've found on Allrecipes. I've probably made it 25+ times.  It's very easy and most of the ingredients will probably be in your pantry. I make it exactly as directed. Just watch the peanut butter to powered sugar ratio.  I feel like it comes out better when mixture is super fine and not round little balls.  You'll see what I mean when you make it.  Just add a bit more powdered sugar if needed. Enjoy!!

When I was growing up, my fatherâ€™s favorite pie was a peanut butter pie that he could only get at a restaurant someplace in Florida.  This pie is exactly the same and it made him soooooo happy the first time I brought it over.  Now he constantly calls me to ask me to make 2 pies, one for him and one for a neighbor.  Thank you S_ST for helping me to make my difficult father so happy!!  This pie is very easy to make, and I follow the directions exactly.

Fantastic Recipe. Just like other reviewers this pie is just like one we used to get at our home cookin restaurant. The restaurant has since closed so my Mother was super excited to taste this pie! The only thing I omitted was the cream of tartar in the merange since it really doesnt need it. Thanks!

I made this pie for Christmas Eve Dinner and it was so good, that I made it for Christmas Day Dinner as well!  I used three egg yolks and four egg whites which made more meringue for the top.  It is an impressive looking pie as well.  Truly restaurant quality!!!

WOW! I didn't know what to expect and had a hard time deciding on whether or not to make it. I'm so glad I decided to! It was fantastic! It was also a big hit at our Christmas dinner. Now I don't want to go back to the other peanut butter pies we're used to.

This is a great peanut butter pie!  The only thing I did different was to cook the custard in the microwave.  The peanut butter flavor is so pure  and the meringue compliments it beautifully.  It will begin to weep after a day in the refrigerator but it doesn't affect the flavor.  I soak up the moisture with a napkin and all is well.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was a difficult one to rate. I had this last minute idea to make a peanut butter pie for my husband on Valentine's day and this was the only recipe I could find that I had all the ingredients for.  We definitely enjoyed the pie, but it's definitely not a traditional peanut butter pie.  I agree with other reviewers that this pie should be called something more like peanut butter custard pie. So, I'm not a huge custard fan and I'm not sure if I'd ever make this again. BUT, the pie did taste pretty good, especially the second day. If you like peanut butter and you like custard, then this pie is a winner.

My mom has been making this exact recipe for as long as I can remember. She got it from a friend of hers. I'm so glad the recipe is out there for others! Simply the best pie hands down!

*******Note: if the custard is coming out soupy, you didn't cook it  on the stovetop long enough! This is meant to be served cold. I just realized the recipe doesn't say at the end to chill it after baking. You gotta chill it! Allow it to set in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours. The longer it sets, the better it tastes!

This is hands down the best peanut butter pie recipe I,ve ever tried I did change it a little to keep the corn starch and egg yokes from clumping. I mixed the cornstarch,sugar and salt together first then added gradually to the milk I already heated to a boil stirring con.then cook over med.heat 2 min. till thick and bubbly. Take off heat add a small amount to egg yoke mix and pour back in pot cook 1 min.stirring con.add peanut butter and va.this way also takes off baking time you only have to brown top.

This had a delicious peanut butter flavor!! I decreased the sugar in the pudding because there is plenty sweetness in the PB crumbles. Instead of separating eggs for the pudding I used whole eggs and Cool Whip for the topping. It was perfect! Will definitely make this again!!

This pie was a very good version of a peanut butter pie but I was looking more for something like a Peanut Butter Custard Pie and not a separation of the peanut butter bottom layer and the custard on top. It did get me started on trying to come up with the more traditional peanut butter pie recipe that I grew up with though. Thanks for the great recipe!

I searched and searched for the recipe that my grandmother always makes, but can never give me measurements for. ( I just don't know how to measure a pinch of this, about a cup of that)  This is exactly what I was looking for and it is just as perfect as hers.  I made it for me and she was so excited that I could now begin to bring it to all of the family functions.  Thanks!

I really appreciated that this was a peanut butter pie without cream cheese or whipped cream. When I split the peanut butter mixture, it seemed like I had way more than I needed to sprinkle on top of the meringue--next time I would probably leave only 1/4 of it for the top of the pie. Also, I'd say that this would be equally delicious with or without the meringue topping, but it looks prettier with the meringue.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it! It had just enough of the peanut butter to give it great flavoring.  My husband was expecting a lemony tasting pie because of the meringue, but was very pleased with the peanut butter taste. He asked me to make another one soon. The pie crust was a little soggy, though, and separated from the filling while cutting, but no one seemed to care.

My husband just raves over this!  The only thing I do different is I use more egg whites and carefully fold some into the filling with no cream of tarter.  Gives the filling a nice texture.

This was exactly what I was looking for!!  Making this pie was also a lot easier than I thought it would be.  The change I made was to omit the meringue for the top and used Dream Whip.  If you're very careful to chill the pie (after adding filling) and the Dream Whip (after whipping according to box directions) completely before topping, the result is pretty appealing--especially if you're not great with meringue.

I really liked this recipe although it wasn't what I was expecting.  It's more of a peanut butter custard pie.  I would have given it 5 stars, but neither my husband or son were very crazy about it.  So, I gave it an average combined score of 4 stars.

The taste is well balanced with just enough peanut butter for it to be a presence but not so much that its overpowering. The idea to have part of the crumble on the bottom is great because it soaks up the moisture from the meringue "weep". The only thing I'd change is that I will probably use half of the sugar that the recipe recommends for the custard because it is a bit on the too sweet side.

I attempted this recipe 4 times and had to throw the pie away every time. Poured filling into pie crust and peanut butter crust floated to the top every time. Turned out soupy every time. I read and re-read the directions over and over wondering what I was doing wrong... couldn't figure it out. Makes me question these reviews...

Family loved it, but very sweet.  Was nice to find a recipe where every ingredient was already in my pantry.  Will make again, will cut back on sugar as others suggested.

Made this with slight variations for "Pi" day and it was a HUGE hit with my family!  I dont think I'd ever had a peanut butter pie of any sort before, and I was blown away!

I reduced powdered sugar to 3/4 c as mentioned by some reviewers and it was still plenty sweet for us.  I cooked the pudding in the microwave.  I used almond and coconut milk and a gluten/dairy free home made crust.  

Thanks for such a treat!

Winner winner after dinner! The peanut butter balanced perfectly with the thick custard and light meringue. I used most of the pb mixture on the bottom and sprinkled a circle on the top, leaving a center of toasted meringue - very pretty. Tip: if you're having trouble with your meringue separating, be sure your eggs are room temperature. I started by separating my eggs and leaving them on the counter while the crust was par-cooking. Also, don't wait too long before starting to add the sugar to the whites, the sugar needs to dissolve before it's stiff.

I made this pie and thought I followed it exactly.  I checked on it the last 5 minutes or so and it seemed the sugar had separated and was seeping out. Any insight on what I did wrong? I'm not sure if it was coming from the meringue or the custard.

I felt the eggs weren't necessary.  They clumped together on top.  They should have just been mixed in with the entire filling.

I made this the other night and it was amazing, I used an Oreo pie crust that happened to be sitting around, I'm going to try it in a casserole dish with a small increase in the recipe size using crushed chocolate graham crackers.  What they don't mention is how amazing this is with the layers, crust, peanut butter and powdered sugar melted together into a crunchy layer, the custard, meringue then another crunchy layer on the top.  Make it, it's magic in your mouth!

This was good.  I didn't do the meringue, I just put the 3 eggs, whole, into the custard.  The first time I ate it, it was still a bit warm and I cut the slices too big, and I thought it was okay, but after being refrigerated overnight it was better.  You don't want to keep it too long though because it gets a bit soggy.  I'll probably make this again sometime.

This pie is delicious, but most of my family complained that it was very rich, and a bit too sweet.  No one cleaned their plate.  My advice: Don't serve too big a piece as it is too rich to finish!

This is delicious as well as an attractive presentation.  I want to try a whipped topping with it, and also maybe a crahm cracker crust, or oreo crust.  This is a recipe you can do many different things with.  If you haven't tried this, you must.  We tried it while it was still a little warm, however the presentation is better once it has been chilled.  It is delicious.

I'm not a big fan of peanut butter.  There are a couple of local restaraunts, however, that offer delicious home-made peanut butter pies.  But i have to admit that this one has them both beat.  I'm not a professional baker but found this recipe extremely easy to do.  It has a beautiful presentation and tastes best if left to chill at least 8 to 10 hours.  Definately a must have for peanut butter lovers.

I know this recipe! I too got this from my grandmother! It is the best!!!!!! It might take longer to make than some of the other peanut butter pies listed in allrecipes.com, but it is well worth it!
