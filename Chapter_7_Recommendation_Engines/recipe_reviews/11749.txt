This turned out fantastic.  My husband raved!.  Next time I might try adding a little more sun-dried tomatoes and maybe some artichoke hearts...

Of all the recipes that I've tried on allrecipes.com, this one has to rate as the tastiest.  The pesto flavor comes out well but is not overpowering.  I put the feta cheese on a little too early, but that just added to the tanginess of the sauce.  I highly recommend this.  Thanks, Lisa!!

This was pretty good but not my favorite. Maybe I did something wrong but I had to add a lot of spices. Family said it was ok!

This was excellent.  I am eating the leftovers for lunch right now.  I think next time I will cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and after browning, cook them in the sauce to keep it moist and flavorful.

I've tried this recipe several times now and it turns out great every time.  Try this recipe if you want to impress your friends and family - it really does look and taste like restaurant food...maybe better.  By the way, pesto is super easy to make if you don't want to buy it already prepared.

Feta cheese and sun-dried tomotoes really make this dish great.  I also added broccoli, sliced grape tomotoes and used whole wheat penne pasta. Took the advise of another and substituted 1/4 cup white wine for some of the chicken broth.  Can't wait to make again.

This recipe was great.  I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend isn't so I divided it up in half and sauteed his chicken with the sauce in a separate pan at the end.  I used the sauce for the 6 serving to serve the 2 of us since we love sauce.  I also added fresh spinach.  For rehydrating the sundried tomatoes boil the chicken broth first then soak the sundried tomatoes in that for 5 minutes.  They will turn out nice and soft and easy to chop.

Sorry, I haven't actually tried this one. I was rating another one and accidently clicked on this one. They should have a delete review button. It is on my list to make though!

This was very good.  I used only 3 chicken breasts, half the amount of pasta called for, but used the full amount of sauce, along with my own homemade pesto. I did thicken the sauce with twice the amount of cornstarch because it was still a little on the thin side as written. Used penne, rather than fusilli pasta, as that is what I had in my pantry. I think adding some fresh chopped tomatoes or sliced grape tomatoes at the end would be a nice touch.  Thanks for the nice recipe, Lisa!

I am on the south beach, so i skipped the pasta and the corn startch, used "south beach approved feta", and this was still DEEE-LISH!!!! Really great! Found that chopping up the chicken into chunks  after its cooked, simmering in the sauce for a bit when its almost done and serving it "ala Cacciatore" style makes it yummy and easier to eat!

Awesome!  I added a about a 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes.  I also add about 2 tbs. of milk to make it a little creamier.  The recipe didn't call for onion, salt or pepper but I added a little of all of those too!  :)

This is probably in my top 5 recipes that I have made from this site! So good and was loved by my whole family, everyone had seconds (or in the case of my 3 year old, thirds!) and I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I thought this tasted so good that it's almost restaurant quality. In fact, it surpassed my last visit to an Italian chain. Very quick to make so it's great for a weeknight meal without much fuss or chopping. Next time I make it I might leave out the feta cheese because we really couldn't taste it at all, not a complaint, just an observation and another way to save a little money. Thank you for this fantastic meal, Lisa!

My husband thought this was great; the rest of us thought only "good". The chicken broth seemed to overpower the dish and I couldn't taste the feta . I liked the ease of preparation and cooking method though. I did leave out the pine nuts to spare both the expense and the time to toast them. I think I would try adding next time. I might replace some of the chicken broth with white wine.

Very good recipe.When it was time to eat, I did mix all the sauce in with my pasta and served with a vegetable salad on the side.  Plus, I added half the feta cheese into the sauce near the end to melt it a little and then sprinkled the other half when serving the dish.N.B: Some Fetas are saltier then others so if you want this recipe less salty use less feta or buy a feta that has low sodium in the brine.

The taste of this recipe was excellent.  I reconstituted the sun-dried tomatoes and then chopped them, this was much easier.  I did forget the fresh basil but again, the taste was wonderful.  I can't rate this 5 stars because with the amazing ingredients, this was an absolutely ugly meal!  I mean, this looked like stew and not a good one.  The color of the sauce ended up being really dark and weird.  So the flavors were perfect but I always eat with my eyes first and I was worried.  Good meal for home, not so good for presentation.

This was very flavorful and surprisingly easy!  The only note I would make is to use a good strong feta for flavor contrast.  I used a mild version and it would have been better with stronger feta flavor.

This was very tasty. Lots of flavor! I cooked the chicken breasts whole in a pan in olive oil and then cut the chicken up in small pieces before mixing it in with the pasta and sauce. It made a lot. There were four of us eating and we have a lot of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Excellent!!  Used chicken sausage and didn't have the pine nuts.  Sauted 2/3 bag of baby spinach with the sausage, garlic and olive oil.  Used 2 cups of broth and 3/4 package of pasta (we like more sauce).  Can't wait to try again, maybe with some shrimp.  Thanks Lisa, this is a keeper.

I loved it and my family too. I tried first just with my husband, we liked so much that I made it again for the whole family for my husband's birthday, 16 people, everybody loved it. Thanks so much. I felt like a star. :) I made it with whole wheat past for us but white pasta for the family. Loved the whole wheat better.

What a delicious recipe. After reading some reviews, I didn't change a thing, except I put the chicken mixture over penne pasta. I made homemade pesto several weeks ago, and also had toasted pine nuts left over from that, ready to use. My husband raved about the meal - a definite keeper.

This is one of our favorite recipes on this site although it's one of the more expensive to make with the pesto (if you don't make your own) and the pinenuts. I follow it to a "T" except that I also use some white wine with the chicken broth.  I've doubled it and had leftovers cold and it's great that way as well! Love it!

Oh .... this is my recipe.  Well I should review it then.  One of our all-time favorites!  It's especially cool when my family members now make it for other family members and they tell me how much they love this recipe.

Everyone in the family loved this recipe. I browned chicken strips first and then removed the chicken and added 1 onion and the garlic to the pan to fry up.  I then added the chicken and remaining ingredients together and simmered for 30 minutes.  the chicken was very moist.  I added the cheese and pine nuts just before serving.  It's a keeper according my young adult family of 5.

Made this tonight for my hubby for his birthday. Wow! This website has definitely changed my cooking, and this recipe exemplifies what great tasting recipes can be found on here. Made this pretty much exactly as listed. Added a few more cloves of garlic though, cus you can always use more garlic! Next time I might toast more pine nuts though - they added such a delicious nutty flavor to this, it was definitely a great touch. The feta I had on hand was sun dried tomato feta, and I was worried the flavor would be too much because I already had chopped sun dried tomatoes in there, but can't say it hurt it any! Also had to add a teeny bit more cornstarch because sauce was still a bit too thin. Served it over whole wheat fusilli. This is definitely a keeper!

My daughter walked in and said, 'That smells delicious'!  Honestly, I felt at that moment that if it tasted half as good as it smelled and looked, I would be happy. 

It smells and tastes good.  Would look great on the table at a potluck supper too!

The only thing I might do different is to cook the chicken longer and on lower heat before adding the cornstarch mixture.  My chicken was a little chewier than I would really like.  I also would double the sauce portion, as my family really loves sauce.

All in all, this is a definite 'make again' dish!

This dish is really yummy!!!  I made it exactly like the recipe said to and I made my own pesto with homegrown basil.  My children even liked it!!!  This dish feeds more like 8 people instead of 6.  We had lots left over to have again the next day!

There are few recipes I get so excited about, but this one was amazing!  I added some fresh chopped tomatoes to the finished sauce as another reviewer suggested, and threw in some extra parmesan.  YUM!

Very tasty! Added sliced fresh mushrooms and artichoke hearts as I had them on hand and needed to use them.  Used fresh roma tomatoes as I didn't have sun dried on hand. Definitely make this one again!

I loved the dish, or at least how I made it.  I made my own pesto and didn't think that it needed any extra basil or pinenuts after I mixed everything together.  I also subbed out about 1/4 c. of the stock for some white wine.  I also used orchetti pasta, and next time I think I'll add a touch of cream to the sauce at the end.

This dish puts Italian restaurant recipes to shame!  Wonderful flavor!  Didn't have fusilli pasta but whole grain penne worked just fine.  I also used low sodium chicken broth since the cheeses had enough salt.  Next time I'll double up on the sundried tomatoes- they're my favorite. I'll be keeping this one on my favorites list!

This turned out great, but only got 4 starts becuase I did some touchups...ok, first I marinated 4 chicken breast overnight in chicken broth, a bit of olive oil, garlic, basil and black pepper (the chicken came out really tender).  I did not use the sun dried tomatoes...which I do not think you need at all.  The other change I made to this was instead of the feta cheese I added 3/4 cups of a shredded mix of Asiago, Parmesean, Provolone and Mozzerella cheese...soooo yummy!!!!  The leftovers were really great the next day too...!!!!

This was good but if I make again I will double the sauce, I skipped the pine nuts, and instead of frying the chicken I baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and sprinkled with basil garlic salt and cayenne.  I will use more feta next time to, very flavourful

This is very good, the recipe was forwarded to me by a friend that uses this website regularly.  I used sun dried tomatoes in olive oil because that was what I had on hand, and browned the chicken (which I cut into bite sized pieces) in the tomatoes which had been drained and chopped.  I have also made this with feta that contains basil and sundried tomatoes and it was very good as well.

Sorry but I have to give this a thumbs down.  Even with the sauce, the chicken was lacking flavor.  I had put some salt and pepper on it when I was cooking it but it was pretty flavorless.  My husband, who is not very picky, gave it an "eh".  My suggestion is seasoning the chicken before cooking it.

This was good and fairly easy too.  I enjoyed all the various flavors. Family liked it too. I will make this again. I was tricked up a bit with the cornstarch instructions, so read that part carefully - it's clear if you read it slowly.  Yummy.

Very yummy. I skipped the part of soaking the sun-dr. tom. in chicken broth, b/c I use the kind that come packed in oil. I added a bit more pinenuts and more pesto than what the recipe called for, but other than that, I did everything as it said, and we really liked the dish a lot -- yum!

Mmmm, delicious, as I expected!  I only used 3 chicken breasts but left everything else almost the same, because I was only serving 2 people & was sure we would love the sauce.  We ate it ALL, with half a box of angel hair!!  The only thing I did not do was add fresh basil to the sauce - I used all my basil to make an extra-large batch of pesto, forgetting to reserve a few leaves.  Fabulous dish in any season; thanks so much!

Excellent recipe!  I cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces and mixed the whole thing up with the pasta in a big bowl.  It turned out awesome!  I think next time I'd like to add a few fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My family loved this recipe but I used the brand new Classico Pesto which may have made a difference. It was very quick to make and it tasted almost too fancy for a weekday meal.

This dish is VERY good.  I use the precooked, precubed, frozen chicken to save time.  The ready to use sun-dried tomatoes are also a time saver.  My husband loves this one!

When my husband exclaimed, "MMMM!" when he hadn't even chewed 3 times on his first bite, I knew we had a winner. 5 stars for yumminess, ease, and flexibilty.
I made this recipe as-written except for the one big thing- I had a grocery store rotisserie chicken on-hand instead of boneless, skinless breasts. I sautee'd a bit of the chicken skin before adding two chopped zuchinnis. I still wanted to get that "pan-dripping" flavor from the chicken since I wouldn't be cooking any new chicken. My broth was homemade and probably a bit more rich than store-bought, too. Other than those (admittedly significant) changes, I followed the directions to a T and I KNOW I will be making this again! Used prepared pesto from Aldi (a special in the cooler section, not their regular jar pesto in the pasta section).

This was a big hit with the Fam!  I made fresh pesto (thanks to a co-worker's organic garden)The only changes I made were leaving out the sun-dried tomatoes and I used penne pasta.  Also didn't add the basil leaves as my pesto was basil-y enough.  Actually it was quite green but delicious! Thanks for sharing...

I love this recipe! I follow the recipe almost exactly except I omit the cornstarch. Instead, I just keep cooking the chicken pesto mixture until much of the liquid has thickened on its own.  I don't always use the feta; sometimes I just add more Parmesan cheese. Yummy. Thanks for this one!

I used homemade pesto and I didn't have sundried tomatoes so I added fresh tomatoes to the sauce at the end of cooking, just to warm through. Very nice flavor.  The feta cheese is a must!

Very easy, very colorful, very versitle, and the fresh herbs explode in your mouth. I didnt have any pine nuts on hand but sub'ed in some crushed peanuts from a Thai meal the night before and it worked out wonderfully. Even the picky eater of the family liked it!

This was really good. It was a little salty, but still very, very good. Definitely a keeper. It was even better reheated the next day. Thanks Lisa!

recently started cooking, and made this for the entire fam (all 5 of us), and they were so happy with the results. toasted the pine nuts with a bit of paprika on its own for a few minutes, then added half of it to the sauce... left the other half dry in a bowl for people to add if they wanted more. used more basil for more flavor...otherwise... definitely a good recipe

really enjoyed this dish, there's a fantastic range of flavours.  there's 2 of us but we always cook for 4 (saves cooking time during the week, as we both have full time jobs), and discovered that a night in the fridge allows the flavours to develop even more, so it's extra delicious on reheating. :)

I made this using very little of the feta cheese.  I thought it would be way too salty for us if I added the entire amount, and I was right.  I gave it 5* with the elimination of the feta cheese.  Next time I make this I won't use the feta at all, as I think it tastes better without it.  This is a beautiful dish to serve.

This is a really good recipe, great for company. I use my own pesto using the "Pesto" recipe on this site that was submitted by Valerie (3 c basil, 4 cloves garlic, 3/4 cup Parmesan, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup pine nuts)

This recipe is excellent; it tastes gourmet without the difficult preparation.  The dried tomatoes were hard to chop, even when rehydrated, so I might use oil-packed next time.  I sauteed the chicken in garlic olive oil for an even better boost of flavor. Mmmmm!

I made this for supper last night, after working all day, and it took very little time to whip it together.  My spouse, who is a tomato sauce/marinara lover, raved about it and bragged it up to my folks this morning.  He gave it an A+.  I used the Pesto Sauce recipe that I found here as well.  Delicious!

This is an excellent dish!  The pine nuts and the feta cheese totally make the dish.  My husband(who is a verry particular about how his food tastes) actually asked me what restraunt I ordered it from.  Its a little time consuming but worth the effort.  I used pre-made basil pesto sauce to save time.  Freshly made pesto would make it even better.

This was the first recipe I tried after becoming a member of Allrecipe.com. It was easy and very, very tasty. My husband is somewhat picky and my daughter needs bribery to try different menu items. Thank you Lisa for such a great recipe. I can't stay away from the site now!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

Really delicious. I forgot the feta cheese, the grocery store was out of fresh basil so I omitted and they didn't have any pine nuts either so I subbed in cashews and it was still fantastic! I added chickpeas when you add the pesto etc. instead of making pasta and it was really good.

SO FREAKING GOOD!! My boyfriend, who claims he hates pesto, loves this dish. The flavors are perfect together. I do add more sun-dried tomatoes and basil and use cavatappi pasta instead, but keep everything else as is. The addition of the cornstarch thickens it up just enough and the pine nuts give it some added crunch. It has surely become one of my favorites!

My family absolutely LOVES this dish! I have made it for company many times as well. I add about 1/4 cup more sun dried tomatoes, 1 more clove of garlic and a little more basil cuz we love the flavor! I also mix the pasta right into the sauce so it soaks the flavor a bit more. (mini bow-tie works great too!)

This receipe was a huge success. I put more sundried tomatoes (a bonus) and too much feta. I would do it over in a second by removing or cutting down the feta byhalf an dadding more parm. cheese! Good choices fo any occasion. I Was told it was "restaurant quality"

Great recipe! Very easy to play around with too and change it up.   I leave out the pine nuts because my family doesn't like them.   I also marinated the chicken for a few hours in Zesty Italian dressing, salt and pepper. It really kept the meat moist and it was delicious.   Also added mushrooms. I start them before I start the chicken because I chop the chicken into bite sized pieces.   I use a lot more garlic, I think like 10 cloves the last time I made it. But my family loves garlic. What I like to do with the garlic (for those that like garlic) is I like to mince a few cloves for when I'm cooking the mushrooms and chicken together, then for the rest  of the cloves I use, I chop them into bigger chunks.  I've tried with fresh tomatoes and sun-dried now and don't see much difference. Sun-dried is very hard to find around here so I think we'll just use fresh from now on.   I also use radiatore pasta.   It's very tastey! And really good the next day, although it doesn't look too good, lol.

Excellent!  I used my own pesto recipe (which is published here on allrecipes as "Spinach Basil Pesto").  I only used 3 chicken breasts and 2 cups of fusilli, which is perfect for 4 servings.  I kept the other ingredient amounts the same.  I also added a few handfuls of fresh spinach.  The sauce thickened up nicely and I loved the addition of the feta cheese!

Fast,easy and delicious..and that makes a '5 star'. Did not use the Parmesan as I felt the Feta made it salty enough. Did add fresh tomatoes from the garden and some diced red sweet peppers.Fresh Basil is a must. It's one of those dishes you can play with. Thanks for the recipe Lisa.

This is fabulous! I've made it several times. I actually just use 2 frozen chicken breasts, and boil them for 15-20 min. Half way through I add my whole wheat pasta, and a bag chopped brocoli to the boiling water. I chop the chicken and add everything back into the original pan. Just fabulous! It's even good cold the next day for lunch.

I made a few modifications to this recipe and absolutely LOVE it!  I use goat cheese instead of feta and it is to die for!  I highly recommend the swap if you like goat cheese.  My hubby was requesting it for dinner- so that is a good sign!

This dish was wonderful.  I cut back on the chicken (I used three half breasts cut into bite sized pieces) and added one pound of raw shrimp.  On the advice of other reviewers, I added additional cornstarch and fresh, sliced mushrooms.  I have recommended this to others and will prepare it again for my family;

I made this recipe a little differently because I had sun dried tomato pesto on hand, so I just used that. Very good, will make again! Also, it's nice that I had everything on hand.

This was awesome. I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. It was restaurant quality. I omitted sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts. Instead of pine nuts I chopped up a couple of walnuts. So good!

Yummy!
Very good dinner!
I have made this several times.
Sometimes I cut down on the sundried tomato for my family. I have tried a variety of
pasta shapes and premade pesto. I also have made it with lemon and shrimp.

This recipe is awesome; my husband and I just love it, and have served it to company with rave reviews.  It is very easy to make, especially if you prepare the ingredients ahead of time.  Delicious and healthy, especially since we use whole wheat pasta. We don't bother with the parmesan; it is fabulous without it.

Thought this was great - and I very rarely give 5 stars.  Made with homemade pesto and marinaded the chicken in a little olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil, oregano and garlic for 1/2 hour before sauteing.

I've made this twice now.  I didn't add the sundried tomatoes b/c I didn't have any.  I used home made whole wheat fettuccini for the pasta and this recipe was a hit both times.  Our friends asked for the recipe.

Another fabulous and fast pasta dish.  I didn't have any pesto or pine nuts, but added extra garlic, a small minced onion and red pepper flakes to the saute.  Used double the broth, a little white wine, extra basil and about a cup each of grated mozarella and parmesan in the sauce along with the feta.  I really love the idea to soak the tomatoes in broth - so much more flavor than plain water.  Thank you Lisa!

This is delicious, but it has a very strong flavor of the sun dried tomatoes. It is also very good using gorgonzola cheese instead of feta--just use 1/2 cup of cheese instead of 3/4 cup!

The only reason I gave this a 4 stars and it isn't Lisa's fault - is the saltiness of the recipe - not sure what exactly - maybe you can find a low salt Pesto - but other wise - excellent - I kinda skimped on the pine nuts - don't - add more - overall my wife loved it - another hit.  Thanks.

My husband said this was the best meal I've made in a long time - it came out delicious.  The only thing I did different was that I didn't add the extra two cloves of garlic (I don't like things too garlic-y!).  It came out fine for my tastes because the prepared pesto had plenty of garlic - it was incredibly flavorful without being too rich or strong for me.  I will make this again!

Very good but very green. My husband added half a jar of alfredo sauce and I think that, too, helped make it a weird color. Opening the container the next day for leftovers was like looking into a diaper!

I thought this was a great recipe.  Both of my roomates were very surprised that it turned out as well as it did.  I added extra feta, and this created an even better taste.  If you like pesto, you'll love this!

This Pasta was SO good!  My family was EXTREAMLY pleased!  It wasn't hard to make at all.  It took me about an hour to make the first time, but I'm sure the next time it'll be a snap!

This is a wonderful dinner.  My family loved smelling it cook and ate every bite.  I usually double the batch and freeze one or give one away.  Get many compliments on it.
