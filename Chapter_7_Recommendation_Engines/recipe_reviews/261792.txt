The video was very helpful they turned out perfect both times. First time I used baked sweet potatoes the biscuits were a lovely color of orange. The second time needing a shortcut I just mashed them straight from the can. They were not as beautiful in color but still an awes9me biscuit. From now on I will used the baked potato for sure.

I never worry that a Chef John recipe is going to be less than perfect, and this one is a case in point. Minor adjustments I made: I increased the amounts by 50%; I made ersatz buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice; I followed John's instructions on making self-rising flour; and I skipped the pomegranate spread. Froze most of the yield to be brought out on Christmas. Really delicious recipe, John!

Really liked this recipe!  Made it as mini size and probably won't do that again.  It was good, but lost some of the "biscuit" texture.  I made it as is, but w/o the pomegranate butter.  My office loved them!  Plan to make again and might up the sweet potato & add some cinn/sugar topping, just cause I love it!

Two words, Da bomb!!  Made no changes to the recipe.  That being said, we did not make the Pomegranate Spread.  And yes, we will make these again and again!
