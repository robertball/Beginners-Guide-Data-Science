Great flavor, but I found this recipe to be very difficult to make especially when trying to squeeze the oil from the ground walnuts. It just didn't happen for me. I ended up adding mayonnaise and making chicken salad,which was not my initial intention for this dish. Too bad because this dish has a lot of potential.

I used 7 saltine crackers, omitted the potato, added a bit of real Hungarian sweet paprika (about 2 tsp), and garnished the dish with pomegranate seeds for added eye-appeal.
