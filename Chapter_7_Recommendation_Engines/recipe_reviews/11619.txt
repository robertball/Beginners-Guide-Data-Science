Delicious! Using "chopped dates" makes the preparation even easier. I usually end up with about 36 cookies instead of 2 dozen, and they don't last long!

You need to avoid getting scrambled eggs in your cookies if you put the eggs in while the skillet is hot. I had the heat on low and I was able to get most of the egg stirred into the sugar/butter/date mixture quickly. But if any egg touched the skillet anywhere prior to incorporating into the mixture = scrambled eggs. Fortunately I was able to salvage most of it, but I think it's a must to put some of the hot mixture into the egg first and mix it prior to adding the eggs to the skillet. I'll try that next time. The cookies that survived are delicious. A great way to use fresh dates. (UPDATED to give this 4 instead of 3 stars. I do make these every year. I always stir some of the hot mixture into the egg now and avoid touching the egg mixture to the side of the skillet until it has been incorporated into the date mixture. These are chewy and delicious.)

At first I thought these cookies would not turn out well because they did not stick together too well and had a sweeter taste than desired. But, I put them in the freezer and then they were a big hit with my family. A very good change from the other rice type cookies.

Tasting! I thought I was going to have trouble with them forming into balls. I let the mixture cool a bit longer and then had better luck.
