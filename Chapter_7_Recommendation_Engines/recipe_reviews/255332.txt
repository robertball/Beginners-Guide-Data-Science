Like many others mine came out very with a strange texture. The shrimp and corn came out good and the taste was good but I wonder if adding sugar,more seasoning and a couple of ounces of water or milk would have made it better.

I did add roasted red pepper  to the mix, plus I semi cook the shrimp with garlic  and a blend of fresh spices and a touch of lemon. Also I subs the yellow onion mice for sheredd red onion.

This had an interesting texture. Unfortunately, mine came out a little dry. Possibly because I tried to cut the recipe in half without doing the math. I will try again!

This had a really nice flavor! I used a combo of shrimp and crab. Mine did come out a bit on the dry side, but  that could've been my fault. The spicy/sweet combo was great! I would make this again. Thanks for sharing. :)

I would have never thought to add shrimp or other proteins to cornbread...but what a great way to get extra protein! This was a crowd-pleaser!
