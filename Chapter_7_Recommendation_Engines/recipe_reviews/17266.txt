WOW..Thats the 1st word that popped into my head once I made & tried this recipe. Put it this way, now at every famiy function it is my duty to make this. I scaled it to 25 people & had it for a christening & a 50th  bday party. Very rich & so tasty. I added some parsley for a lil extra taste. But I make this at least once a month for my family. My niece eats it for breakfast! Enough said...

Hi this is Dawn, if your meal tasted too much like vodka, chances are you did not simmer it long enough.  The vodka taste burns off!  Enjoy

Very good.  DH and I thought this was a nice change from the regular marinara sauce (even if it did look a little too much like tomato soup LOL).  I added frozen Italian meatballs and chopped mushrooms to the sauce while it cooked.  We really liked the flavor.  Thanks

Very yummy and easy to boot. I like that it's quick and also made with ingredients I usually have on hand. I did add a bit of garlic and a bit of ground oregano to round the sauce out. I served this topped with strips of pan-friend prosciutto. Our guest, my two toddlers, my husband and I all cleaned our plates, it was a hit.

I just made this meal for my boyfriend and we loved it! I modified the recipe slightly. 

I added garlic to the butter as it melted to give it more flavor and a can of crushed tomatoes with Italian seasoning for texture as the other tomato items were added. 

I also chopped up about eight fresh basil leaves and added them to the sauce at the end with the parmesan cheese. 

Next time, I plan on halving the amount of butter used in the recipe to cut back on fat. 

Overall, this recipe was quick, simple, and really really tasty at the end of the day. It's definitely going into our hearty food rotation.

I have been using this recipe for years, it is a family favorite - thank you Dawn!  I agree, anyone ending up with a strong Vodka taste didn't simmer long enough.  We've never had an issue with that.

We didn't like this at all.  There was an after-taste that was not appealing.  I will not make this again.

Fantastic! I used ground red pepper instead of the flakes. I also accidentally doubled the amount of red pepper but it came out perfect for us! We love spice. Thanks for such a great and easy recipe.

Thougt this was pretty good.  I cut back the butter to 6T, the cream to 3/4 cup and the pepper flaked to 1/4t.  I think I could have use the whole 1/2t of pepper flakes and will next time, but next time I would add about 1/2 of a chopped onion with the butter and a few cloves of garlic and fresh mushrooms.  I'll be making this again.

No words for this recipe except WOW!! A big hit with my family. I even tripled the recipe and frozen the sauce for my daughter to take to college. Simmer till you can no longer smell alcohol and the amount of pepper flakes is perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!

This sauce was very good.....very rich.  That's a lotta butter and cream, but worth every bite.  I could live on pasta, and vodka sauce is one of my favorites.  I'll definitely make it again, just can't do it toooooo often, unfortunately.  A keeper!

So, I've made this recipe twice, sort of. The first time, I got all set to start cooking and realized what I thought was a bottle of vodka was really flavored rum. I made the recipe as stated, but substituted white wine for the vodka and it was yummy. We finally bought a bottle of vodka and I made this again last night. Wow wow wow. Wonderful, velvety rich sauce. At hubby's request I added onion, mushroom and vegetarian chicken strips. Great sauce. Great recipe. Thank you!

This was great, I did follow other suggestions, by cutting vodka to 1/2 c. and I used lite cream, I also add some fresh garlic to butter. This was so good, and reheats very well.

Excellent as a base recipe...but it needs some extra flavor and additional cooking time to reduce the strong vodka flavor.  Do not think that this recipe will take 20 minutes....it needs significant cooking time.  I added much more heavy cream and tomato as well as garlic, spices and extra cheese.  Everyone raved about the recipe.  Use this as your base....then modify to your taste.

YUM, this was fabulous.  I pan fried some pancetta and added it to the dish at the very end.  I do think I will double the red pepper flakes as suggested by other users as well.  Great Simple Recipe!  I also double this recipe to ensure I can feed everyone and have leftovers.

I followed this almost exactly, although I didn't have quite enough heavy cream, so I added a little milk.  I didn't even put it on top of the pasta, as I thought the sauce was to vodka-y and DF thought it was too tomato-y.  I made it on a whim, so it was VERY easy, but not the sauce for us.

Eating this as I type. The sauce came out soooo delicious. I may have to double it next time since my pasta dried out a bit and it soaked up a lot of the sauce and it wasn't so creamy anymore. Doubling and making my pasta a bit later. I added some chopped garlic to the butter and cooked sausage and mushrooms in a separate pan, adding them in with the tomato sauce. Super tasty.
For any who think the vodka is too much: I used super cheapo vodka (on a budget lol) and followed the measurements exactly. Also followed the cooking directions exactly, even using a timer while simmering both times. During the first simmer, I was a bit worried as the steam burned my eyes with alcohol. But after both simmers (and the small amount of cooking in between to get it to a boil and such) the vodka taste was there a bit, but not the alcohol. Just be sure to give it plenty of time to evaporate away. If it's still too alcohol-ey, cook it longer, making sure there's steam coming off of it, as that's where the alcohol leaves.
I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious & romantic!  The little bit of heat from the red pepper flake is great! I followed the recipe to the T, and it turned out great.

This dish was AWESOME! I added to large cloves of garlic, chopped, and after the sauce was cooked, I threw in a can of diced tomatoes (because what ISN'T better with diced tomatoes??). :) Scrumptious! And it has a nice kick, too, with the Red Chili Pepper flakes. I think I'll add cooked, diced chicken next time.

If you haven't tried this, you're missing out on a terrific dish.  I'm not generally a fan of cream based sauces, but the proportions listed here are perfect!  The sauce is unbelievably delicious!  You do have to simmer the vodka for longer than 5 min.  (Keep smelling the butter/vodka mixture until you barely detect the scent of vodka.)  Great for a large group of guests.

This was very tasty!  I used linguine noodles and added grilled chicken and sauteed mushrooms, bell peppers, and zuchini.  I also seasoned the sauce with garlic powder.  YUM!

Was a quick meal. Kids liked it. Was a little bland and I wish I had put some veggies or something into it. Would make it again!

This is one of my family's favorites as well as mine to make. It's easy, yet super delicious!! Since my boyfriends dad refuses to eat a meal unless there's meat in it, I added some Polska kielbasa, some sautéed mushrooms , red onion and zucchini and it put the recipe over the top!!!

Made this thinking it was going to be tasty and quick.  Sauteed garlic and onions in with the butter as others suggested.  And I will have to agree with those that say there is a pretty prominent vodka taste.  The after taste is in fact a little over powering.  I let my sauce simmer for at least thirty minutes...so it was not due to to "under"simmering.  When you cook with alcohol--the alcohol cooks off but the flavor remains.  Maybe if it was cut back to a half a cup it could possibly taste better.  Im glad I made meatballs to go with--cuts the taste a little.  Cannot say that I would make this again.

So easy and SO good!

This was the easiest and tastiest recipe I've made so far from "Allrecipes".  The family loved it.

Do yourself a favor and try it soon.

This was a great recipe that I made for our cooking club. It was a Halloween theme so I used spaghetti instead so I could call it Intestines in Vodka Cream Sauce. The only thing I changed was that I used double the cheese.

Delish! Made it for New Years Eve and all my guests loved it. I sautéed garlic and onion also and although I used heavy cream for the main meal for left overs I added reg milk to thin it out a little.  Perfect people thought I bought the sauce. Looking forward to making it again for my next party.
