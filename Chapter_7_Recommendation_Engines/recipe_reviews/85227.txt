Great! Low cal too. Unless you really like hot reduce the chipotle powder in half. I have also made this with chile powder instead of the chipotle and I prefer the chile powder.Absolutley everyone asks for the recipe when I make this. Easy too!

I took this to a Mexican themed dinner party and received rave reviews!  With all of the veggies, it tastes so light and fresh. (even in the middle of winter!)  Only 1 change, I didn't have Chipotle Chile Powder, so I used 1 canned Chipotle Chile and 2 Tbsps adobo sauce.  Super recipe!

Great recipe especially when you have left over grilled corn.  I didn't have chipotle chile pepper so I used regular chili powder and it was fine.  I think next time I'll add a little bit of fresh diced jalapeno for an extra kick.
