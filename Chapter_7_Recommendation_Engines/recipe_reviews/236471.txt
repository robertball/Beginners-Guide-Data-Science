This is a very delicious hummus!  I was out of tahini and do not like feta so omitted those.  I added sundried tomatoes to mine.  Very tasty.  My entire family enjoyed it.  This is now my go-to hummus.

Absolutely worth all the ingredients.  Slight sweet and salty twist on the traditional hummus flavor.

I fricking love this recipe, it's so adaptable. I've made it a dozen times now, with subtle variations (based on available ingredients at home) and it's been excellent every single time. Rather than adding water, my trick is one can drained, one can not. Perfect smooth consistency. If I want a little thicker, I "sploosh" out a little water from the second can. I've done none with fresh basil. One I used canned chopped black olives, store brand. Then no olives. Then kalamata, etc. One without cheese, for a vegan consideration. Etc, etc. Every one is perfect, whatever seasonings you add.

This hummus is definitely full of flavor! Realized after I made it that I'd forgotten the feta; when I make this recipe again I will add it. The only change I would make is to use one teaspoon of cumin; a little strong for my taste.

This is a great recipe, but I didn't have some things.  I was out of basil (how did that happen?). I substituted the feta with plain yogurt. It was a little too sweet so I added another 3 tablespoons of olives and 1 teaspoon sambas oelek to spice it up. I'm sitting here with a mouthful .... so good.  Next time I will try it the way it is written.  I don't think it needs any water, because I like my hummus thick.

Need more feedback from others but I sure like this!  I subbed 1 tsp. of turmeric for 1 of the cumin as I'm not a huge cumin fan.  Love the salty/sweet and the consistency was perfect.  Very versatile recipe as others have noted.

I must admit I was a bit sceptical with all those ingredients, but I had to try it. it's really good, but I might use a different chili sauce since the one I used made it a bit too sweet. maybe use a harissa instead. thanks for sharing the recipe. it's worth a try!

Just made it now for my dinner party....DELICIOUS !!! I’m Greek and we never put tahini in our hummus but I tried it and love it with this recipe- I think it toned down the salty ness of the olives.

So delicious and creamy! Must say though, it was more on the sweeter side than anything else but I added cayenne pepper for a little kick. 
Will be my new go-to! Thank you!

Lovely base recipe - I used great northern beans and because I used adobo sauce in place of sweet chili, I left out the lemon and dill, I never use tahini because I don’t like it

Not much flavor to this. Followed recipe except for adding a dash of cayenne.  Will stick with Roasted Red Pepper Hummus.

This hummus is jammed packed with flavor and has to be the best I've had. Amazing flavor, simple and quick to do. I have no need to buy the store junk ever again.

this is a winner every single time I make it! Love the addition of the feta and Kalamata olives for the flavor. I always use the tahini as well. This is so much better than anything from the store. it is frequently requested for any party I go to!

This is the best hummus I have ever had and will be the only one I make going forward.  I made a half batch, using 1/4 cup water instead of a 1/2 tablespoon...otherwise it would've been way to thick.  Everyone loved this so much that I regretted not making a whole batch.  I did not take the skins off the garbanzos, but that would probably have made the consistency smoother & I would've therefore had to use less water.  Regardless, this is absolutely delicious!

so my picndoesny look appetizing, but this is the BEST.
I read the recipe and was trying to go from memory; consequently, I forgot the sweet chilli sauce.
This was amazing.
I still might throw it back in the food processor with the sweet chilli sauce

This is the recipe you use when company is coming!  This is a very special appetizer to serve with pita bread or veggies to dip.  Lovely rich flavor.  I used black olives instead of kalamata and it turned out great!  I also used goat cheese feta due to cow milk allergies and it gives it an even more exotic flavor.  I will make it again for our Christmas party!

This was the best hummus I've ever had,  I highly recommend this recipe especially for parties. I didn't use the tahini because it wasn't in my budget. I used fresh dill instead of dry and added a little black pepper. Next time I make this I would like to roast the garlic.

This was a hit. Love the taste & would change a thing. However, if I had someone who didn't, like the slight olive taste, l may try black olives in place of the kalamatas.

A wonderful hummus! I am allergic to garlic and so cannot buy hummus in the store. Making it plain was just not tasty enough, and then I found this. I omit the garlic and the dill due to allergies, and it is still delicious. Thank you for solving my hummus issues.
