This was a very easy recipe to make. However, I did change a few things. First, I skipped making the crust and just used a ready-made graham cracker crust. Second, I scaled down some of the ingredients a little bit. I only used 2 packages of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 2 eggs, and about 3/4 cups of sour cream. The rest of the ingredients I left as is. In addition, I also added fresh lime and orange juice along with the lemon for more citrus flavor. Turned out great! Thanks!

I tried this recipe for the first time for a dinner party. Dessert is my flare and I am always asked to it. This is one of the best cheesecakes I've made.  I dressed it up with a ring of sliced kiwi, then a ring of mandarin oranges and finished it with crushed pineapple in the middle, I dried the fruit well before using. I topped it with the marmalade glaze from the recipe. It turned out just beautiful.   I always cook my cheesecakes in a water bath. I will definately make this one again.

I made the recipe as directed, but I made the glaze with lemon curd (store bought) instead of orange marmalade.  I tossed a pint and a half of fresh blueberries in the lemon curd glaze and then dumped it on top of the cake.  Delicious and beautiful!  I had two New Yorkers say that this cheesecake is the best they've ever had, which is a great compliment!

Awesome! AWESOME! I used juice from the lime and orange as well as the lemon. For the topping I couldn"t find a marmalade made with seville oranges at the nearby store, so I was stuck using smuckers, which usually does really well with their products, but in the case of orange marmalade is really way too sweet, so I just added a whole lot of lemon juice and reduced it for quite a while...it tasted excellent! Loads if citrus flavor instead of corn syrup! My friend who loves cheesecake and orders it out regularly said it was the best he's ever had!*****Just made again (this time with higher quality marmalade:)), and the response was overwhelming!!! Another friend who loves cheesecake tried it and said "Oh my gosh, you are going to make me so fat! This is unlike anything I've ever tasted before.....yum!!!!" Last weekend I had made the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake for this friend, which he also really liked, but definately not any more than this one!

I made a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the one in the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and the result was wonderful.  My picky husband said it was really, really good (a huge compliment from him) and that it was probably the best cheesecake I'd ever made!  And it was easy to make, too.  Update: Took this to a fund raiser bake sale and it brought in the most $$ and had a bid placed by almost everyone there!

I can understand why this recipe got 5 stars! This was my first cheesecake and I made 2 mistakes. 1. I need to practice more on making the crust, and 2. I could not wait the overnight refrigeration! Nontheless, this cake was wonderful. The glaze turned out perfect! This cheesecake recipe is definately a keeper! I will be more patient the next time I make it so that it will set up better. An absolute elegant dessert!

This was awesome.. only thing I did different was following my four rules for cheesecake. I blend the room temperature cream cheese and sugar in a food processor till there are NO Lumps. Add the eggs last and don't over beat so as to not mess up the consistency by adding to much air. Bake in a hot water bath! This allows the cake to cook evenly and you get a better consistency. Turn off the oven a little before the cake is totally finished baking, Don't open the oven door. Just let it cool as it finishes baking (this took me a little bit of practice to perfect) then take the cake out and let it cool in the bath for a little longer. finally let it cool to room temperature before putting it in the fridge. Rapid temperature changes make the cheesecake crack and can make it rubbery.
I always let my cake cool overnight in the fridge.

This was a pretty good cheesecake, I unfortunatley served it the same day I baked it, it was so much better the next day. I had to cook it a bit longer than instructed and used 1/2 marmalade and 1/2 mango jelly since Im not a big marmalade fan. Nice and easy, I will make it again for sure.

The crust and cheesecake were fantastic. Nice, fluffy cheesecake. The marmalade glaze was a little bitter for the kids, but all of the adults liked it!

Wonderful flavor and really easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2 tsp orange extract (Penzey's).  If you've never heard of Penzey's, it is definately worth trying.  The only place I'll buy my spices and extracts.

I made this cheesecake a couple of days  ago and followed the instructions/ingredients exactly. My crust was slightly burned and mostly came off from the sides when i pulled the ring off of it, but it may have been because I forgot to run a knife around the edge when it came out of the oven. About 20 people tried it and although a couple of people thought it was kind of on the sweet side, still loved the citrusy flavors. I baked it in a water bath and also, when baking time was up, turned off the oven and left the cake to cool in the oven to prevent center from sinking so I had a flawless surface! DH thought the center was too squishy and we had a long debate about whether it didn't get to cook all the way thru in the center so I may leave it in the oven a bit longer next time. I got a request to bring it to a party in a month. Overall, big hit for a cheesecake with a citrus twist! (BTW, I topped it with the kiwi, mandarin oranges, and pineapple and topped with the mandarin glaze and it was BEAUTY-ful!)

i liked this a lot, between 4 and 5 stars, but i would definitely recommend baking this with a "water bath".  any cheesecake site will tell you how to do that.

I agree with another reviewer--one of the best desserts I've ever made!  I like to bake and always get asked to bring the dessert to functions we go to.  I've made many different cheesecakes, and wanted to try a new one.  This was excellent!!  I added a little more of all of the zests, squeezed a little of the fresh orange juice in, and a used a little less corn startch.  I also had to bake mine a little longer.  Everyone loved it--thanks for the great recipe!!

I have made this twice to take to a couple of summer parties.  It is delicious and a huge hit.  Never a crumb leftover to take home! The citrus makes it a great summer dessert. I did make it with a graham cracker crust instead of the flour crust but added the citrus zest to the graham cracker mixture.  Love this recipe!

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe.  I made mine with tangelos substituted for oranges, as I had some fresh picked ones on hand.  The crust was not my favorite, but it suited this recipe better than a cookie or a cracker crust.  It is hard to rate this cheesecake as it is pretty unique, but based off of the reaction from my fans, I have to give it 5 stars.  As always...follow the recipe basics, cook in a water bath, and do the jiggle test...it is done when it jiggles only slightly and uniformly.

If you've ever had some New York cheesecake (in New York City, please!), this is exactly like that.  If you like it, you'll love this one but this has a hint of citrus flavor.  Just like the NY cheesecake, this is very rich and very dense.  I prefer to get a bit more citrus flavor from the cake and glaze, so I will add more lemon or orange juice & zest next time.  Also, again, this is super rich, next time I will use just two packages of cream cheese instead of three, but for people who don't think NY cheesecake is rich then just go for it.  Instead of using this crust recipe, I used a crust recipe from "Bake Sale Lemon Bars" and added some lemon juice and zest.  I just like their crust and it tasted great but if I make this recipe again, I'll try the crust recipe from this recipe or the chocolate one since some reviewers mentioned it was good.  I used a springfoam pan and baked in a hot water bath (no crack!) but it took 75-80 minutes for me to finish baking.  I also wanted to take this cake to a party and baked it in the afternoon.  But it still wasn't set after four hours so I gave up bringing it but I was glad I didn't because it probably wasn't ready and wouldn't have come out as good unless you rest it overnight.  I don't really care for this type of cheesecake because it's just so rich and sweet, but I'm sure some people will love this.  Besides, with that orange glaze on top of it, it'll make a wonderful cake for a party and people will be impressed to find out that y

Fantastic recipe, with no modifications, but I tend to add 1- 1.5 teaspoons of lime and orange juice, simply because I want to use those fruits after zesting them.  For the zest, you'll need two reg lemons, one reg lime, and one large navel orange.    Other suggestions: don't skimp on the crust by using a store bought graham cracker crust. This crust recipe is far better and is easy and quick to make.  And, let the cake settle for hours because it really needs this time to firm.

This was a pretty good cheesecake, but too rich. I made a chocolate cookie crust. The flavor is rich, fresh. But I think this cheesecake has more home flavor in comparison with White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Chocolate Cappuccino Cheesecake, Praline Cheesecake from this site, which have a restaurant style flavor.

This was a very good cheesecake!  I made it as written except I didn't have quite enough orange marmalade for the glaze.  I added some of my homemade ginger-peach jam to make up the difference.  Watch the step of browning the crust, my oven at 450-degrees caused the edges to burn and I had to cut them off.  I baked this in a water bath, as I do all of my cheesecakes.  The only thing I would do differently the next time, is to bump up the quantities of each citrus zest to give it even a MORE citrusy flavor.  But the truth is, it's very good as written.

This recipe makes an excellent cheesecake just as it is, with no alterations except to bake it with a pan of water hot water on lower shelf of oven.  I prefer this over a water bath because there’s  no risk of water leaking into your precious cheesecake. When it’s done baking crack oven door and leave cheesecake in oven for at least an hour to prevent cracking.  I like the cookie-type crust as a change from traditional graham cracker crust.  I’ve never been crazy about marmalade so when I saw recipe called for it in topping I decided to use fresh oranges off my tree and make my own.  I topped cheesecake with berries and spooned fresh marmalade on top.  I’ve been making cheesecakes for 20+ years, this one tastes great and looked heavenly with berries & marmalade on top.

This is the first cheesecake I've made in many years and it turned out great. There was enough filling to make a second small pie or maybe I should have used a bigger pan. Even so, the bake was great.

Made this cheesecake for my daughter's boyfriend who loves citrus verses chocolate/ caramel desserts.  I was not sure if I would like it, but boy was I wrong.  It is delicious! I will definitely make again. The only change I made was topping it with crushed pineapple and kiwi after reading another review.

I made this with a chocolate graham cracker crust.  Simply added a great element to a cheesecake recipe that is already great on it's own.

Have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews.  Unfortunately, the original chocolate crust that appeared with this recipe has now been exchanged for a basic cookie crust. I searched & found a chocolate crust which I have been using & just top with the sweetened sour cream & fruit. Can't go wrong with it.

Great cheesecake! The crust is delicious. I should've cooked it about 10 mins longer (65-70 mins total) though. I baked it in a water bath and let it cool slowly. Tuened out smooth and beautiful.

Disappointed it sank somewhat, although evenly across the top, but it didn't crack.  Cooled it first in the oven with the door open.  Made it in the morning and Served it that same evening with sliced of Terry's dark chocolate orange, edged cake with whipped cream to cover up the obvious higher sides and shaved a little of the dark chocolate on the cream.  Looked great and tasted fine,  light and not too sweet.   Will rate the left over slice today to see if it really is better the second day.

Very good! Kind of tart like a key lime pie, but not overpoweringly so. It's also not too sweet like most cheesecakes are. The orange marmalade glaze on top really tied it all together.

Have been making this for years now, always with great results.   It's requested at our Easter potlucks and I'm happy to oblige as it's relatively simple to make.  It's the only cheesecake I can make with assurances of rave reviews from any crowd.   I add drained fruit (mandarin oranges, pineapple, etc) on top before glazing for presentation.   When feeling lazy I substitute juice for zest, but the zest does add a nice quality.  You can't go wrong with this one.

Made this cheese cake for my husband who loves cheese cake. I used finely crushed shortbread cookies as the market here does not carry graham crackers. I followed the recipe otherwise but added slightly more lemon juice to the marmalade to offset the sweetness. I was careful not to stir the cream cheese filling too much and I cooked the cake in a water bath. The cake came out beautifully. I can't wait to surprise my husband.

I made this for Easter last year and plan to make this year. Many people asked for the recipe. It was really good and refreshing. I did not decorate the top and it was still pretty. Thanks for this recipes.
