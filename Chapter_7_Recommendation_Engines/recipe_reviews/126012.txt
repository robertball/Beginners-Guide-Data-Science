I admit I've never made this as it's written, but I've changed it many times.  Try throwing in chopped broccoli or different cheeses.  Almost all amounts can be changed and it still works--more or less cheese, eggs, and any veggies you add.  This has become one of our staples, especially as meat prices go up and we look for other proteins.

Brilliant recipe!  May I suggest blending the cottage cheese to achieve a more consistent texture.  Variation- I usually add 2c. chopped, mostly-cooked vegetable.  Change up the cheese or the vegetable...ie Gruyere/spinach, Gouda/broccoli, Muenster/zucchini, Swiss/mushroom, or Jack/peppers. If you make it every Sunday, no one will tire of it. It reheats nicely for breakfast burritos.

Easy, quick, delicious! Nice brunch recipe because you don't have to make it the night before.  I do suggest using less salt or omit it.

This was really good!  I however did want something that was thrown together the night before, so I made it up to the point of adding the flour and stuck it in the fridge until morning.  Then I added the flour, gave it a quick mix with the electric beater and popped it in the oven.  4 adults were very happy with it.  I do have one thing to comment on...I haved the recipe and in doing so, the cooking time was also cut.  It took less than 45 min to cook.  Just a heads up in case anyone else cuts it back!  Great egg bake and am so pleased to not to have it include bread in the recipe!

Excellent. I have made it a couple of times. I add vegetables (pre-cooked, whatever I have on hand), and bake it in muffin cups. Easy to grab and bring to work.

Everybody at the Easter buffet liked this a lot!  Doubled it and it took at least another 45 minutes to cook.  Ended up microwaving for 5 minutes to complete so we didn't hold up the meal.

I got this recipe from a friend a few years ago and have made some variation of this dozens of times since then.  My recipe includes a teaspoon of baking powder, which makes it puff up nicely.  As written this recipe is five star, but here are some other things you can do.  If you want to speed up the baking process, put it in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes.  I sometimes add spinach and mushrooms instead of diced chilies.  I usually use just 8 oz. of reduced fat sharp cheddar to cut down on fat and calories, and I use eggbeaters instead of whole eggs. You can substitute olive oil for the butter, too.  It keeps pretty well for a few days, but is best when it's fresh out of the oven.

I loved this recipe. It's very easy to make and is even easier to tweak with some of your own ingredient choices. Before starting, I adjusted the serving size to 4 which is still more than 4 average folks would eat. I prepared the recipe exactly as presented with the exception I added 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 1 cup of small cut broccoli florets. Another version I tried, instead of chopped onions I used chopped water chestnuts... All versions so far are 5 star in my book. Even with the smaller serving recipe I still baked 1 hour @ 350° and the texture and taste were excellent... I topped servings with salsa, your choice mild, medium, hot. Then all I had to do was eat, sit back and enjoy the compliments.... -Jornie1

Try using Riccotta cheese whole milk is best ( if you're not counting) instead of cottage cheese. even smoother and fluffier.
Then throw in anything else. use cheese and topping that's appropriate for the other throw ins.

Very Yummy for my family!  I used triple cheddar and mozzarella cheese in place of the pepper-jack and just sprayed the dish with olive oil instead of melted butter.  Really cheesy.  Didn't quite take the full hour, more like 40 minutes and it was perfectly browned.  I will try other variation in the future like added spinach and bacon to the dish to make it a one dish meal.

The recipe came out beautifully!  I basically followed the recipe except substituted butter-flavored cooking spray for the butter, but looking at the ingredients, felt it might be a bit bland. So, I took some suggestions from others and added some rosemary, onions and about half of a Serrano pepper.  Also threw in some garlic powder (about 1 tsp), and about a tsp of baking powder to make it fluffier (which someone else had advised).  Even with all those strong flavors, the final product had a very subtle co-mingling of the flavors.  It definitely needs some type of topping -- we used the sour cream, salsa and sriracha.

Delicious and easy to make! Used cooking spray instead of butter and eliminated the salt. Also used whole wheat flour and it was fine.

I have made this dish too many times to count and I omit the flour, cottage cheeser and salt. I always added the larger can of diced green chiles and a personal taste amount of jalapeño.  

My dish was always served with a nice big glob of chunky salsa, hot sauce, and warmed tortillas...with the option of sour cream.   Throw it together so quickly and sit around for an hour visiting with your guests and family over coffee or mimosas and still present an awesome breakfast.  Salsa Fresca takes it over the top!!!  I use shredded cheddar in the recipe with extra available to top with on the plate.  I've never added vegetables, etc., but now I will sure give it a go sometime!

Very easy! I took Hammertime's suggestion and added one 4 oz. can of diced green chilies. Because I didn't have pepperjack, I just used regular monterey jack cheese. I did not add the whole teaspoon of salt, just a pinch. I also added fresh ground pepper. This made just enough for our family (plus the company we had for dinner) and everyone loved it!

For the gluten-free foodies, flour is not needed.  The eggs do a fine job of rising and getting fluffy on their own.  Whole milk goes a long way to help with that....just sayin.  I just love any kind of breakfast casserole/baked eggs.

Easy and tasty!  I used habanero cheddar cheese, gave it a kick.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9 X 9 pan and it took about 25 minutes.

This... is the most delicious breakfast egg dish I've ever had. I made a pan of it for Thanksgiving breakfast and took it out to my Grandmother's house since they hadn't eaten yet. My grandpa was leery of it because they hate trying new things but as soon as they tried it, everyone loved it. Most came back for seconds. I'm gonna make a pan this morning I think but play around with the cheese combo. 5 Stars!

I used low fat cheese and cottage cheese and it was still absolutely delicious!  You can alter this recipe to fit your dietary needs, so pay no attention to the naysayers. I added 1 tsp. of baking powder for fluffy eggs, per an earlier comment, and also combined all ingredients in a blender.  This recipe could not be any easier...and I've got a week's worth of breakfast ready to go!

Yum, these were so good. I used a blend of monterey jack, cheddar, and mozzarella cheese, and garlic salt. I served them topped with a mild southwest salsa.

I love this!  Never would have thought to combine cottage cheese and eggs.  Eggs are good for you.  Cottage cheese is packed with protein.

Really enjoyed this though don't know that it's the healthiest. Love the cottage cheese in here (hidden healthy).  I also didn't think it needed salt though I threw in a shake or two of garlic salt but didn't taste it. I thought it was perfect and followed the recipe to the T without the salt.

reduced down to 2 servings & it was great. Hubby even liked it & he refuses to eat anything with cottage cheese in it. What he doesn't know about this recipe won't hurt him!

Wow!  Delicious and easy...killer combination!  I made it according to the recipe except that I added a small can of drained diced green chilies.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  It was one of those breakfast-for-dinner meals, and I served it with fresh fruit.  This one is a keeper.

I've been making something similar, substituting Bisquick for the flour, Mexican blend cheese or whatever I have on hand, and adding green chilies, sliced olives, and/or marinated artichokes or chopped mushrooms.  It is wonderful for company because you can make it the night before and it reheats very well in the microwave.

It is better without the added salt. Adding herbs or chopped veggies would be more than enough flavour.

This was really good! Very creamy and great flavor. I did add in some extra spices, and veggies, but the base recipe is great as a starter. Super easy weeknight meal!

Delicious!  Halved the recipe, but added 2 extra eggs (8 instead of 6) and cut back on the salt.  Used monterey jack instead of pepper jack.  Took about 35 minutes to bake.

Followed basic recipe amounts exactly but substituted a mix of cheeses on hand for the pepper jack...  before baking, added veggies from fridge that needed to be used:  sliced fresh mushroom, diced red, yellow, orange & green peppers, sliced green onion and chopped spinach ~ Oh so YUMMY!  
Only change I would make is to use olive oil or non-stick spray on the dish rather than the butter.

Great taste, but cooking for an hour caused it to be too brown on top. Have made a note to check it after about 40 mins.

I've made this recipe a gazillion times down through the years. Everyone likes it. I've made it for breakfast, lunch, or a meatless dinner--mostly for 6-8 people. I would suggest not blending the cottage cheese, as another poster suggested, because it adds nice texture to the dish.  I use the small-curd cottage cheese. I use plain Monterey jack instead of pepper jack.  Some people don't like spicy, and spicy can be added on top with salsa, etc.

This recipe is from an old book from the '70s or '80s called Frugal Gourmet Cooks... something--American (or maybe another of his books)listed under crustless quiche.  I still have the paperback.   Chunky tomato sauce or green chunky salsa is good with it, and for a change, we like chutney of the Major Grey variety on it.

Really, really good base recipe that lends itself beautifully to adaptations. I've made it three times in the past week, adding a variety of veggies each time. It's come out perfectly each time -- never over- or under-cooked. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I add sliced jalapenos, cooked crumbled sausage and a small amount of Tabasco. I cut into large Brent size pieces and wrap in plastic wrap. My husband takes it to work and warms it up with a tortilla. ?I don't have to get up early and fix breakfast. My husband's motto is "I'm not hungry but I could eat."

Tried this on my family and everyone loved it.  Next I served it to a large crowd at an RV Club outing; it was gone in a flash and I had requests for the recipe!  As most others I've "played" with the recipe but mostly I keep it simple and allow everyone to add their own choice of salsa, sour cream and hot sauce I provide on the side.  However, I always add at least 1-Tbs of Onion Powder and 1-tsp of garlic powder to the mix.  It's a great casserole for vegetarians too.

It turned out really great. I liked the consistency the cottage cheese gave it. and the pepper jack made it nice and cheesy. It works well for larger groups. We have too much leftovers but it could save you time in the morning, just reheat it.

Very nice recipe.  Manufacturers of cheese and/or cottage cheese may have added more salt to their products.  Having added only 1/2 t.to this recipe,  I will omit the salt next time. Happy cooking. d

I've made this recipe a lot, and have gotten so many compliments.  It's great for company - you get an egg dish without having to stand over a pan while guests are there.  I made it mostly as written the first time, except I had to use cheddar cheese instead of pepperjack (for the kids).  With the cheddar, it turned out too salty for my taste.  Now I just use about 1/4 tsp of salt instead.  Baking the eggs makes it taste like there's a crust on the bottom.  This one is a keeper - so versatile and delicious!
**Edited to add: almost 3 years later, I find myself going back to this recipe (with just a pinch of salt instead of the called for amount) over and over, and have served it to brunch guests so many times - our family still loves it!

This is a really easy tasty dish. I made as a side dish for dinner and it was amazing. I also added a 7 oz can of diced green chilis which goes well w the pepper cheese. Can't wait to try other combos with veggies and other cheeses. Winner!

I changed the recipe to be healthier by substituted low fat cheese and low fat cottage cheese and used butter spray instead of butter.  It turned out delicious.  it was done in about 40 minutes.  I also added fresh salsa on top of each portion.  Very yummy...

So good!  I cut it down to 4 servings and it baked for 30 minutes.  Nice browning on top.  I also used gluten free flour!  Definitely a keeper.  I like everyone's suggestions for alternate fillings.

I added some sliced carrots and used vegetable oil cooking spray to prep the baking dish as I didn't have a way to brush on any melted butter. I baked for a full hour and the eggs browned nicely to form a crust. Delicious and a good way to get my oldest to eat some eggs.

Love this recipe!  I check it after 45 min in the oven because an hour is too long. I’m doing the low carb thing; so after the first time I made this, I gradually reduced the flour. These days I don’t use any flour at all, and it still comes out great. You can add veggies and meat (pre-cooked). My favorite add-ins are spinach and turkey sausage.

This was so easy and yummy!  I just dumped all the ingredients in a big mixing bowl and mixed altogether before putting it in the oven. All my family ate up the whole thing in one sitting. Just with shredded mix cheese from Costco and whatever leftover cream cheese, it was so good. Hubby even thought that i had put expensive Gouda in. I recommend using whatever meat you have, just chopped fine and mixed in if you can.  I will definitely make again.

Delish and easy, made a half recipe and don't think it takes nearly as long to bake so watch carefully.  Kids loved it, not too spicy, very good with sour cream +/- salsa
Made a whole recipe- 45 min was perfect

I did not have pepper jack cheese.  I subbed medium cheddar.  Worked great.  I will make this again and again.  Good crowd pleaser.

I've made this for two people so I used only 6 eggs, and that's too much cheese, I've put one cup of swiss instead of half a pound of pepper jack.

I made this tonight with one change. Instead of cottage cheese, I used ricotta. Devoured by the family & tasted great!

Great as an egg dish to bring to a brunch.  Basically followed the recipe, but with Costco's mexican shredded cheese instead of pepper jack but I think pepper jack would have been better.  It was done after 40 minutes.
It was easy, and turned out great, should feed 10 people fine, but it was a little boring. Adding chiles, peppers or veggies would be an improvement.  
Husband described it as "Egg cake," needs more cheese or something.

I served this for our traditional Christmas morning breakfast.  I made the casserole as directed by the recipe, but didn't add any of the other optional ingredients.  My family raved about it, and two 12x9" aluminum baking pans of it were barely enough!  It's delicious just using the basic recipe.

I used a combination of Colby-jack and sharp cheddar cheeses . To make it gluten free I substituted Bob's Red Mill garb-fava flour that had been roasted 90 min in the oven at 200 degrees to temper the strong bean flavor.  I also added onion and garlic powders to taste.  It was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

We have done this with everything as written except we've used other shredded cheeses instead of pepper jack.
Have also used different types of meats, such as bacon, ham and sausage. 
Here's a great tip if you're having issues with your cake pan. We have recently did the recipe using italian sausage, italian shredded cheese blend AND used deep dish pie crust. It came out absolutely perfect!!

Divine. I used 9 jumbo duck eggs, used regular Monterrey Jack, added dice scallions, and roasted green chilies. I will definitely be making this again. It cooked very nicely in a cast iron (Le Creuset) baking pan -- it gave it a nice crisp bottom.

Fantastic!  Only thing I do differently is to add grated sharp cheese on top and put it back in the oven for 5 more minutes.  You do need to let it rest before serving (at least 5 minues) if using a glass baking dish or it will seriously stick!

I sprayed deep muffin tins then lined it with wafer thin prosciutto
and added jalapeños from a jar as suggested by other reviewers.
popped them into the oven after a sprinkle of cheese on the top, baked for abot 15 mins.  The smell when I took them out of the oven was amazing!
Great 'on the go food' cold...fab warm with salad.
Thanks for sharing.

All the family enjoyed this recipe, although they won't have anything to do with quiche.  I loved it because it was easy and I could prepare it ahead.

I am not much of a cook but I made this recipe for two of us. I did two things differently. As recommended by another reviewer, I used 16 ounces of ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. Also I FORGOT to add the flour, however when I took it out of the oven it was perfect and puffed up something like a souffle. We both loved it!! There was so much left over that the next day I gave it to my sister and her husband. Refrigerating overnight sort of deflated the souffle effect, but it tasted just as good. They absolutely loved it and I shared the recipe with her. I also made a ditalini salad I found on this website to go with the egg dish as a side dish. It had ditallini, black beans avocado,...if you search it, you will find here. It also was excellent and it went well with this cheesy egg dish. I will make dishes again very soon!

This was great! I wanted to try something different for my husband and found this recipe. SO easy!! Since I only wanted to make it for him, I scaled the recipe down and used a mini ceramic loaf pan. I also didn't have cottage cheese so substituted ricotta cheese and used shredded cheddar instead of pepper jack. I also added sautéed mushrooms, spring onions, green pepper & 1/2 a diced peperoncini. My husband loved it!! It was finished baking in 30 minutes. I'll def be making this again!!

Turned out great! Used bisquick instead of flour was the only real change.  After baking I wrapped in a tortilla with sausage links, salsa & a dab of sour cream. Best breakfast burrito ever!!

I halved this recipe, added some crumbled bacon and baked in a pie plate. I topped with some additional cheese and paprika. I whisked the cottage cheese to make very smooth. Yes, its probably rather fattening but its not something I would eat every week but great for a holiday brunch or special occasion. It could certainly be made using low fat ingredients but since its not something I would eat often I will prepare as written. I have made something similar using cream cheese but I liked this even better. I can see the potential for adding just about anything including basil,vegetables and ham. It was creamy and delicious and will keep this recipe as one of my favorites!

Nice soufflé-like dish.  Will definitely make again with some fresh herbs, diced veg, etc.
