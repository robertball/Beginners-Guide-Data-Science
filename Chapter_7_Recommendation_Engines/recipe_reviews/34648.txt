Very rich, but good. I used the blue cheese and it was a little strong, so would use a little less if I made again, also less butter & wine.

I left out the grapes since I forgot to put them on my shopping list....this was still a winner.  My guests raved about it and I was asked by three people for the recipe already.

I used frozen/thawed crab meat (leftovers from a king crab feast), used finely minced red onions instead of scallions & I used a white stilton w/ apricots. We were both very skeptical of this recipe but it was very good. I served it in martini glasses, garnished w/ a couple of ruffly lettuce leaves & wafer crackers, shaped like butterflies. Heated up the leftovers, the next night, by moistening it all w/ a tad  more melted butter & wine & then nuking it for a minute. Wsa just as good as the night before! Thansk for the recipe Michelle Long...we enjoyed it!
