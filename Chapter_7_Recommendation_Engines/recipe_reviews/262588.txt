[Editor's Note: We have corrected the oven temperature in this recipe. Do to an editing error, it was listed as 250 degrees F instead of Celsius. We are so sorry for the problems this caused!] I had this flan (pudim) in Portugal last year from Doçaria Cruz de Pedra and was blown away!  It was AMAZING!  As I spoke to one of the  bakers there about the recipe, I knew it contained port wine and bacon, though he told us it was important that it was NOT smoked but rather just cured.  But I was anxious to try this recipe as is and made it last night.  I typically use recipes as more of a general guide but as I was hoping this would be the recipe of the flan I had in Portugal, I followed it to the letter... or thought I did.  Unfortunately something went wrong somewhere as it wasn't even thinking about setting up after an hour at 250°F... or two hours at 250°.. or another hour at 350°.  I have a pot of awful looking egg soup that smells like bacon.    I hate to give it one star but it is truly inedible.  I will try again because it will so be worth it if it's anywhere close to being as good as the one I had in Portugal!
