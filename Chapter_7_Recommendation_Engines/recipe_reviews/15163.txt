This was a great recipe - I used the frozen, pre-made tarts since I'm really not a pastry person, and they turned out wonderfully!  Using the regular-sized frozen shells, this recipe made 13 tarts.  I served them with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream on top to counter the uber-sugaryness of the tarts.

These were great!  I prepared the recipe exactly as indicated but used the small, mini-tin to make them bite size!  Delicious!  Will make these again!

These were pretty good. The filling was too much for 8 tarts, however. I filled mine almost to the top of the shells and they boiled over in the oven. Next time I will fill shells 3/4 full - maybe making 10 - 12 tarts.

THESE are a little too sweet.  they puffed up when i pulled them out of the oven but deflated after a minute.  like any other tart recipe, i made a variety - pecans, walnuts with choco chips, raisins, and cereal.  what i do is i just add a tablespoon or more of the choices in the molded crust, mix the filling then pour it over the "variety" and crust.  i didn't double the recipe and made 24 regular cupcake sizes.  (by the way, i don't roll the dough.  i divide it by 2.  take one and divide it by 4, then divide those by 3s.  repeat for the other one, and ask help from my 5 year old daughter  to mold the doughs :D).

Extremely easy to make, my very first attempt and they came out excellent. I also used store bought tarts shells it yielded about 18. I recommend this recipe if it's your first time.

I have made these several times (over 100) I sold them by the dozen to raise money for my daughters boxing trips. I always have satisfied customers that always come back for more.

First skeptical about this recipe's claims, turned out being very, very pleased. A super quick, fuss-free preparation when paired with pre-made pie/tart shells that is perfect for surprise company. Added extra pecans as previously recommended...very regal results! Made it to one of my favorite recipes!

I made these in a mini muffin pan as suggested by another reviewer - they came out well, however I had a lot of trouble with the crusts.  I used pre-made pie crusts and used a wide coffee cup to cut out circles.  They fit into the tin prefectly, but when I put them in the oven to brown them slightly before putting in the pie filling the crusts shrunk a lot!  Just thought I would add as a caution for the next cook that is still learning!

The old standby recipe, my only change is brown sugar to get more of a caramel taste.  If you have left over syrup, pour it over a layer of graham crackers and pecans, cook with the tarts for 10 - 15 minutes ... a delightful treat!

I added more pecans and as a result I think the center mixture was a bit dry. This recipe didn't say how thin to roll the dough - I did about a 1/4 inch and thought it was a too thick, next time I'll roll it out to 1/8 inch or less. I should mention that I made these in the mini muffin pans. I decided to make a quick caramel sauce (melted caramels and cream) to top these since mine were a little on the dry side. I still think I need to play with the proportions to get these exactly the way I want them to come out. Great start, though!

Yummy! I also made these in the mini muffin pan and they were fantastic! The filling made about 40 mini tarts but you'll need more dough. Will definately make these again!!

I used my own family pastry recipe for this one. (it never fails me) And I cut the sugar in 1/2.  They turned out delicious and not overly sweet!  I used the mini tins and this recipe made me 4 dozen, and I had enough filling left over for more, except I ran out of pastry!   Wonderful recipe!

Yum! I used another reviewers suggestion and used the cream cheese tart shells. The only other change I made was using light corn syrup since that is what I had on hand. These are so simple to make and turned out very yummy! Even my hubby who normally doesn't care for pecans said these were really good. I actually have another batch in the oven right now!

Everyone liked these tarts. I thought they were a little sweet but the nuts balance that. This recipe made 36 mini tarts using pre-made tart shells. I doubled the recipe because it said it yielded 8 and the photo shows mini-tarts, so I had enough for 36 mini tarts and a pecan pie!!

This was unbelievably simple to make. I used real maple syrup and subbed brown sugar for white. I think my only fault was in adding too many pecans. I missed the holiness of a butter tart. Will use less next time. This was my first try at butter tarts. It only takes a few minutes to throw to getter and if you are using ready made shells its pretty hard to screw up. Will never buy butter tarts again. So easy to it make these. Thanks for the great reiepe.

My husband and I went to a carnival and bought pecan tarts and loved them so I sought out a similar recipe and tried it.  He actually loved this recipe better. It was very easy and he's happy.

I was trying to find a recipe close to my deceased Aunt's, and this is it! Hers did have a homemade crust on it, but that's even better for me...less work!!  :o)   My brothers raved about it, just like they remembered. Thanks for sharing!!

Really good!  I used store purchased pie crust and used mini-muffin tins.  Be careful not to overfill- they expand as they cook.  You can also had a handful of chocolate chips if you wish to the batter before you put into the muffin tins.  Yummy....chocolate pecan pie :)

This was a great recipe. I will never buy pecan tarts again. I made 18 mini tarts and 7 regular size. The mini tarts were pre-made frozen from Tenderflake and the 7 were cut out from Pillsbury pie dough. Yummmmmm

First time making tarts and this recipe was a great success! I used the frozen tender flake tart shells (regular not mini) and it made 15. I split the sugar mixture into two bowls and put 2/3 cup pecans and 2/3 cup raisins/currant mixture in the separate bowls and made half butter pecan and half butter tarts so that everyone gets something they love. They are a big hit! Will make again :)

These were a huge hit at an office party!  I did use brown sugar instead of the white.  I will definitely make these again!  Perfect bite size treats!

Honestly wish it came with a crust recipe, so you don't have to go searching around for one that may-or-may-not be able to cook within the time frame, though it looks very delicious!

So good!!!!! I didn’t change anything. I used a mini muffin tin and a tablespoon scoop. I don’t recommend that size scoop haha Use a half tablespoon. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. I def should of used a homemade one but this batch was just a test. Next time, homemade crust is the way to go.

These were great. I made them with my mother in law's pastry recipe which worked perfectly.  I made 9 tarts and a couple were a little too full and overflowed (my fault, not the recipe).   Will definitely make them again.

Great recipe, the only problem is it doesn't tell you how many tart shells to have, so I doubled it, had bought 24 frozen standard sized shells,  and there was still filling left-buying more tomorrow. :)

Amazing!   Thanks to other reviewers I used brown sugar in place of white, and only 1/2c instead of a whole cup.  I still have a sugar headache - I can't even imagine you'd seen a whole cup!  Lol. I also used real maple syrup instead of dark corn syrup.  This time I was making them to bring to a party so I used Pillsberry piecrust but next time I will make my own vegan ones.  I love that the core elements were easily substitutable for better quality ingredients.  I top with Coco whip topping and it's absolutely delicious.  One Pillsberry piecrust rolled out to make 24 mini tarts.  I only have one mini tart pan so I use the second crust in a normal 12muffin pan.  For me the filling made it through one and a half pans so I had to make up a small batch to finish filling the tarts.

A very yummy recipe. I think the only way to cut the sweetness (look at the ingredients!) is to add some raisins, which I did. 

I used the Tenderflake tart shells, twelve in a box, and filled not quite to the top. I did a test baking of two in advance to see if they would overflow. They didn't, and shrunk a bit after cooking.  I would make again. Great for a dinner party where people do not want to eat a whole slice of pecan pie. The raisins were a hit too!

Filling was yummy but overflowed and crust was dry.  I should have used less crust and not fill the cup to the rim.

Excellent tarts! I used the mini muffin pans. Greased them with butter. This recipe is similar to the Karo corn syrup recipe for pecan pie.

Love this recipe. So easy.. I used frozen tart shells and made exactly 2 dozen. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I also added a splash ( approx. 2-3 tbsp. ) of cream.( cream is personal pref.)I also topped each tart with one pecan for décor. They turned out scrumptious. Will definitely use this again and again. Thanx for the recipe. :)

Very good.  I did add little extra pecans, and I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar.

This was a simple and yummy recipe. I as others used the small store purchased shells and tripled the recipe. When I tripled the recipe I still had more filling than would fill 48 of the small shells. 
If I were to want to make 48 again I would cut the nuts to 2 cups likely giving a bit more filling in each tart and not have a surplus left over. 
Good tarts!

Store bought pie crust is a treat to make these easy!  This is the second time making these and I know they will go fast at my tennis match tomorrow, so I am eating my share (2 for me) today.

easy to prepare (for my first try I used packaged pre-baked shells), great taste, not too sweet
