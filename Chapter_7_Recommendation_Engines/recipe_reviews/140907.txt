I hate to rate this low, as I LOVE Natchitoches meat pies (that's pronounced "Nack-a-tsh" btw), but this recipe needed some work to get it where it needed to be. First, onion, celery and bell pepper cooked in the roux are a must. Then chopped garlic, then I added my meat, and immediately turned the burner off *before* the meat could brown - if anything it just got a bit "gray." Then I seasoned with a heavy-handed blend of white, black and cayenne pepper. Meanwhile, I re-rolled pkg'ed crust into about 12 5" circles (will DEF make my own crust next time, that was a pain) and put about 2T of filling into each pie, placing each on a greased pan after forming the pies and cutting tiny slits in the top for steam to escape.  I then baked for about 30 minutes at 350. But here's what sends this over the top - you should have quite a bit of meat mixture left over at this point - now you can go ahead and brown it and use that to make gravy, either from scratch or with a brown gravy mix - it is phenomenal over mashed potatoes and the pies.

Having gone to school in Natchitoches, these delicious little pies have a special place in my heart. I haven't been there in years, but it felt like I was back again when I made these pies! They were delicious and so easy to make!

I baked them in the oven for ease and they were still scrumptious. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt for a bit of a fresher flavor. Yummy!

Mixed up a batch of pie crust dough to use instead of buying the prepared kind. Fried them in hot oil until browned and they were so good. Taste very much like the ones I had in Natchitoches Louisiana.(Made these again and they were even better with some changes: added 1 chopped bell pepper in with the onion. Added 1 bunch green onions chopped. About 4 cloves of garlic and about 1/4 tsp red pepper.)

I, too, grew up in North Louisiana eating Natchitoches Meat Pies.  I miss them so much!  This recipe has potential as it captures the taste of the meat pies.  I did, however, feel that the "crust" was lacking.  First, there is no way I could get 15 meat pies from one store-bought pie crust recipe.  The ones I bought (and I tried several) were much too crumbly to reshape into dough and reroll.  Also, very little meat would fit in there without breaking the dough as it was too crumbly as a pie crust.  Basically, I didn't get very far with this recipe, but I think with a different type of dough, it would work better.  Maybe a homemade pie crust dough?  I may try that next time, though I'm a little hesitant after all the work this time that produced no edible results to speak of.  

That being said, the recipe has the potential to be a 5 star for me if I can tweak the dough issue.  Thanks for trying!  It gives me hope that it can be done!

Used Old bay seasoning in place of Cajun seasoning at end of cooking meat as well as the garlic powder. Definitely cook via oven over fry method. Started out frying and then discovered could of baked so finished via baking. Served with garlic mashed potatoes,fruit salad, & stuffed peppers.

I used to live in New Orleans and eat meat pies for lunch almost everyday, I was in love with them and so excited when I came accross this recipe. This recipe wasn't even close. Or maybe it was me, I did follow the recipe exactly as I do all recipes the first time.

Loved these and will definitely make them again. I used a homemade pie crust and added green bell peppers to the mix and they were delicious.  They're even better the second day!

I made these for my card group at my house and they were met with rave reviews.  I used more pie crusts than it stated and I baked them to cut down on the fat.

Good meat pie, but a little tame.  I added some extra hot sauce. I suggest you bake them. I fried them in oil and they were good but too greasy and fragile.

When my husband says 'We're going to Jazz Fest', the first thing I think of are these delicious little packets of tasty meat and pie crust.  So when I found this recipe I was really excited.  I made these today (exactly as the recipe says) and I was a litte impressed but I think I'll make a few changes next time. The meat filling is good (even though I had to make my own Cajun seasoning living up here in NJ) but after reading other reviews I think I'll add a little green bell pepper next time. I was able to get 15 pies out of 2 store bought pie crusts but whatever you do, do not fry them.  They don't fry well.  The seams come apart letting all of the oil seep in and making them almost sickening. Thank goodness I only fried five of them.  The other ten are in the oven baking right now.

Good recipe!  I changed up the filling a little by leaving out the pork sausage; added 1/2 a chopped green pepper, 1/2 of a  chopped celery stalk and 3 minced garlic cloves to the onion in the roux.  I browned the meat (barely).  I added about another tsp of Cajun seasoning, and about 1-2 tsp of ground cayenne, as well as a pinch of sea salt and a few shakes of garlic powder after browning meat.  Make it to your taste!  I've tried frying the pies in the past, but they were too heavy.  This time I made my own pie dough.  Good, but a little too hard to hold.  Hot tip:  use refrig. crescent roll dough; take a piece a little larger than a walnut and roll out.  Works great and tastes great!!  Brush top with butter towards end of baking; Use instructions on package to bake.

I didnt exactly follow the recipe but loved what the outcome was.  I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef season with cayenne, garlic powder and salt...browned with onion and fresh garlic...then added roux with water to cook down together...then I added diced zuchinni...I poured mixture in a unbaked pre-made dough...added slits for steam...and baked for 30 min.  Was really great!

This is not what I remembered having in New Orleans.  It was also, not a simple thing to make.  It would take several times to get the dough consistency and frying down right.  My first batch was undercooked and my last batch was over cooked.  The pies broke apart coming out of the oil.

Love the recipe.  I substituted minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also used crescent rolls instead of pie crust.  I baked mine.  My husband loves these.  He wouldn't mind if I made them every night.

Very Bland. Made as per directions. The only way I salvaged this was to make chili out of the base.

Great recipe! I used all ground beef as i didn't have any ground pork or pork sausage. Also used sweet mini peppers. Recipe turned out fantastic! Made believers of my family.

This was great. I'm 70 and my great grandma taught me to make this at her home in Natchitoches, La when I was a girl. Only change we made our own dough. E. Mitchell

My girlfriend gave me 2 of these pies to try because I'm used to eating and loving Jamaican beef patties, or Haitian patties, both of which are excellent. Well now I've added a 3rd pattie (or as my girl would put it meat pie) that I love just as  much. The only drawback is that this is only available in Louisiana, which is where she's from!

The filling was ok but the store bought pie crust is not right at all, maybe baked instead of fried would have produced a better result with the crust. Grew up eating natchitoches meat pies and this was terrible.

These are pretty good but I like a little more seasonings added to the ones I make and I have made a lot of these.  First, I like to use a little bacon grease to make the roux or just roast the flour in a medium heat skillet to brown it if you do not want the oily taste. I also use just a bit of thyme, oregano, parsley and red pepper. Then, rather than fry them, I bake them at 350 - 375 degrees in the oven.
