Interesting, but why not make the traditional grilled-egg-and-olive sandwich? Use your favorite egg salad recipe, add sliced green olives, make the sandwich, and grill like a grilled cheese. Voila. Easy, tasty, a kid pleaser, real comfort food.

The recipe doesn’t state what type of bread to use, so I used what I typically use for crostini, and that’s french bread.  I cut into 3/4” slices that were deep enough to create the “shallow hallow” for the filling .  The instructions say to cut a slice of bread into triangles, but if you use the standard-size sandwich bread, the triangles would be tiny.  This was OK, it pretty much just tastes like egg salad (not necessarily a bad thing), but I’m not sure what purpose the cream cheese served as opposed to mayonnaise.  Bottom line, I was expecting more flavor, and did end up adding a few more olives and some salt to ramp up the flavor.
