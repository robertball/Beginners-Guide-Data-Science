A very easy recipe for someone like myself who had never made cornbread.  I only had half a cup of sour cream but the bread still came out very moist.

I did not care for this recipe. It is missing a key ingredient.

We really enjoyed this! I used only 1/2 cup sour cream because that's all I had, but it still turned out wonderfully. I also used mexi-corn in place of regular corn. This was a very moist bread! I think next time I'm gonna use a smaller loaf pan, as the 9x5 made a pretty shallow loaf. Thanks for sharing. :)

EPIC fail.  I should have known--it was like soup.  This recipe is missing a crucial ingredient--maybe flour?  One cup of corn meal couldn't handle the liquid.  I wanted a gluten free cornbread, but obviously this is not it.

great tasting, even with some of my modifications.  i couldn't make it to the store, so i used 1 cup yogurt +1tsp baking soda for the sour cream, and 2 tbs heavy cream to sub for one egg. i used fresh corn, b/c i don't like creamed corn. i was in such a hurry that i goofed up on the pan size; i used one bigger than a 9x13.  For a get together with about 12 people, i would double it next time.

This cornbread was excellent as a start. I altered it a bit since I didn't have the self-rising cornmeal.  I mixed all the wet ingredients first with the 2tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of baking soda. I included 2 heaping tbsp of apple sauce and  1 heaping tbsp of sugar.   I also added 4tbsp of flour to the cornmeal.  I also reduced the corn to 1/2 can and drained it very well. I followed the directions exactly other than using a 9 X 13 pan This turned out so good. It's a keeper.

Great recipe! I changed a few things. To be a little more heart healthy, I left out the butter and added more applesauce. I then added a small can of chopped green chiles to give a little spice. I exchanged the whole kernel corn to a 1/2 can of cream of corn. It had to cook a little longer, but turned out great!! My husband loves it!

This was the first time I ever made homemade cornbread.  It was so moist tasted perfect! I'm impressed!  easy and yummy. I made it along side of my roast. has the southern style taste just more flavor!
