I am from Santa Maria,CA and I can tell you that Santa Maria tri-tip experts are purists, with the simplest of seasonings being used, powdered garlic, salt, pepper and maybe some parsley.  One of the other things about Santa Maria-style tri-tip is that it is cooked over red oak wood.  The oak and the simple seasonings are what brings out the excellent flavor of the meat.

Very tasty as is, but If you have the time and a smoker this can be amazing! First, salt with kosher salt and refrigerate for 24 hours. Next, coat meat with olive oil and rub with dry ingredients, minus black pepper. Also, I like chipotle way better than cayenne. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (yes, that makes two days).  Preheat smoker to 165-180 degrees and place cold meat straight from the fridge over active smoke (for this I like roughly 50% oak, 40% cherry and 10% mesquite). Smoke until internal temp reaches 100-105 degrees, then place the meat on the grill over a bed of hot coals. Baste with vinegar sauce. Sear but try not to burn the meat too much. Grill to 130 degrees internal then remove from the grill and hit all sides with a little freshly ground black pepper, tent with foil and let stand for about 5 minutes or so. Slice 1/4 inch thick cross grain. Magnificent!

Wow!  This was great.  I followed the directions exactly however I cut the crushed garlic down to one clove.  Wife and kids loved it.  Will definitely make again. I don't really care if The Santa Maria residents state that it doesn't taste like Santa Maria style. It was delicious.

We loved this recipe.  I am going to save the spice list for other meats it was such a great combination.  The meat was a little hotter on the inside than stated but it may have been because it sat out longer than 4 hours. I will take that into consideration next time. The left overs are tender and can be used a variety of ways. The next day I sliced thin against the grain and made steak salads topped with homemade shoestring french fries...yum.  I seriously cant wait to make this again.

This was the most fabulous beef I can remember ever eating!  We had dinner for 7 with rave reviews from all.  My only change in Chef John's recipe was crushed fresh garlic, rather than powdered, and chopped fresh rosemary, rather than dried.  Being concerned about blacked beef being carcinogenic, however, I followed Chef John's grilling directions only until the tri-tip was totally browned and sealed.  Then the heat was lowered, allowing the meat to cook more slowly until it reached Chef John's recommended inside temp of 130 degrees.  With an electric knife, I sliced the roast on the diagonal & arranged with wedges of B Follick's marinated Grilled Portobello Mushrooms.  Yum!

I am a big fan of Chef John's recipes and being born & raised in Santa Maria, CA i was skeptical of this change from the traditional Santa maria style seasonings of garlic salt w/parsley, black pepper, and beer(optional). I BBQ'd 2 tri-tips this weekend, 1 traditional and 1 using this recipe. Both were delicious, but heavily critiqued, as is the Santa Maria way when it comes to such serious business as tri-tip! Many people said this 1 tasted as if i had used seasoned salt instead of garlic salt, others disliked the mustard/ vinegar flavor. I personally think this recipe tastes more like San Luis Obispo (SLO) style which is usually served w/ bbq sauce than Santa Maria style which is usually served with homemade salsa.

Made this exactly as directed, but it charred so badly that the flavor of the meat was lost.

I've grilled tri-tips for years and years.  I've used more than a few different rubs and marinades over that time.  I've now made this version quite a few times.  I've shared this recipe (and the grilling technique) with my brother and with my parents, and they've all made it multiple times.  Not only is it my favorite; it's theirs, too.  This is a go-to summer grillin'/BBQ recipe that we all simply love!  Superb as usual, Chef John!  Kudos, and many thanks!

Very good Recipe.  However if you wanyt true Santa Maria Style TriTip your rub should consist of Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Salt.  However this Rub is very good as well.

This was amazing!! Simply awesome! I cooked the tri-tip to be more on the rare side, since that's how we like meat. And it was perfect! The rub and marinade would be awesome on other meats! :) Will be making this 100 times again!

This was phenomenal.  I made it exactly to the recipe except I ran out of propane for my grill and had to finish it under the broiler.  So fricken' tasty!  Mom raved about it, saying it was seasoned perfectly, and the boy and I thoroughly enjoyed it thinly sliced on a sandwich the next day.  Will definitely make again!

Living in central California I have to say this recipe is right on...  During the summer the air permeates with the scent and smells of BBQ tri-tip/oak.  Of course tri-tips are plentiful here.  I have my oak branches (also plentiful here) dried and cut, ready for the summer grilling.  Good one Chef John. I do marinate much longer though..at least 24 hours.  Also I take the meat off the grill at no more then 120 degrees F.

The seasoning is very good, but it does need to be grilled over Red Oak chips. That's what brings the wonderful flavor out in the meat.

I found it to be very salty, especially at the tail ends of the tri-tip.  We can get a pre-marinated Santa Maria tri-tip form our local small specialty grocer and it's amazing.  This wasn't what we were expecting.

We loved this. I used 1 T fresh rosemary instead of dry, and omitted the mustard. For the marinade, I pulverized the vinegar, oil and garlic in the blender, using double the garlic, to make a paste.

Instead of grilling, I pan browned each side for 4 about minutes at medium high heat, and finished in oven at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes. (About 10 minutes per pound.) It came out rare which we like.   Make sure to let the meat rest for at least 20 minutes before slicing against the grain.  The seasonings are great. Phenomenal recipe. I will next try the recipe with the Oregon Rub but do not see how it can top this.

With the Roast Potatoes (on this site) with Rosemary and Garlic, and salad, this was a very delicious meal.  

Thank you very much for this recipe. I cannot remember a better Tri Tip roast.

Wow! This was as easy as it was delicious. I used a tri-tip that was a bit smaller than the recipe called for so I reduced the dry rub ingredients by one half, which turned out to be plenty.  The flavor was wonderful, although next time I will reduce the salt a bit. My husband loved it. This is definitely going into the recipe box.

I made this recipe and added a teaspoon of  parsley, as suggested by some of the reviewers.  I also added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Just my little addition.  

I also modified the cooking process a little (or a lot) by cooking it with a sous vide for 6 hours.  I mixed all of the ingredients, dry and wet, in a bowl.  I reduced the amount of oil in the recipe and then placed them all in a sealed bag.  Allow it to sit at room temperature  on the counter while the sous vide warmed up.  Then cooked it for 6 hours in the water bath.  I then placed it on a super hot grill to sear the outside on both sides.  

Everyone agreed that this was one of the best Tri Tip Roasts ever!!!

Terrific results!  Followed the recipe exactly and grilled the tri-tip on a Weber charcoal grill.  It turned out juicy and had wonderful beefy flavor.  This was a real winner!

I had a hankering for SMBBQ (grew up in Lompoc, CA, just a half hour south) so I used this recipe to make a dinner for the family.  Boy, did we all scarf it down!  Today I did a repeat. In the past I've just done 'dry SMBBQ' with the garlic salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and oregano, but since finding this, I guarantee I'll be finishing it hot off the grill with the red wine vinaigrette.  It is awesome.

Or You can place your beef in an oven pan and pour McCormicks garlic and peppercorn packet on top of the beef ...and have a delicious never fail dish...saves lots of measuring and effort..and better than putting the ingredients together yourself...is my opinion...used it for years

I was raised on SM style BBQ & absolutely  love it..pinquito beans(a bean from Lompoc), garlic bread, salad & salsa..the best. I use Suzie Q seasoning for it (& use it in everything else I cook) over red oak (it's just not the same without it). The vinegar basting mixture just adds that much more flavor to all the seasonings.  Us Santa Marian's are very passionate  about our BBQ & nothing else compares!

Always a winner!  I follow the recipe exactly. Our guests always rave about how delicious this tri-tip is. Many of these folks have never had tri-tip so we or they don’t give a rip what the Santa Maria purists think!  On that note - I’ve had tri-tip in California and it is great. This is altogether a different outcome but it is none the less awesome. Give it a try!

This SM Grilled Tri-Tip Beef was incredible. We BBQ'd it and the only complaint I had was we should have taken it off the BBQ sooner. But even with that we couldn't get enough of it. I loved the rub and the marinade was also delicious. I can hardly wait to do this again but take it off the BBQ sooner. Turn the meat 4-5 times only if you like it Medium Rare. Thank you Chef John, another wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! I used a 3.0 lb cut and trimmed the excess fat.  It is very difficult to keep it over a hot direct fire for so long (I cooked it 24 total minutes, 4 minutes a side basting every turn) if you're like me and usually cook a ribeye but my oh my it sure was worth it.  I let it rest a full 20 minutes after I pulled it from the grill tented in aluminum foil and it was worth the wait. 

Don't forget to cut across the grain! I ended up cutting mine into two pieces because the grains on my cut changed direction. 

P.S. if you're hesitant to use rosemary because it isn't a favorite spice like me just go for it!  The rosemary flavor is very subtle and pairs perfectly with the red wine vinegar baste!

So I had every intention of making this the other night, bought all the ingredients, put the rub together, coated the meat then read it needed to rest for 4 hours... bummer. Didn't want to eat at midnight so I just set it in the fridge. Planned on grilling it the following night only to get rained out. Ok 48 hours for it to rest should be fine. Was informed I had dinner plans that evening... So long story short I ended up having to cook this in a pan on the stove.. Holy Cow! I followed the flip and baste for 35 minutes and this was by far the best piece of beef we have ever had! I will probably let it sit for longer than needed next time too but I really want to grill it. Simply delicious... Oh and I roasted some garlic heads to go with it...mmm

I absolutely LOVED IT!!   I was a little afraid of that I had charred it too much and finished it the oven, but it was absolutely AMAZING!! I plan on finishing it on the upper rack off the grill after I get some good char on it next time. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!

PERFECT!!!   I never make changes to a recipe the first time around, and I can't think of how this could be any better! My 14 year old son said he liked it "because it's so juicy".  YUM, and thanks!

I can't speak to if this "the way they make it in Santa Maria" since I have never eaten tri tip in that zip code.... However this recipe is great, I was shocked at how delicious the tri tip turned out and the combination of ingredients brought out the flavor. Don't change the recipe it is perfect as is. Another great recipe by chef John, thank you.

Omg! I'm in heaven right now. I grew up on the central coast of California and always enjoyed tri-tip BBQs. Since moving to Oregon several years ago, I have been looking for an authentic Santa Maria style tri-tip. I just found it! I made this exactly as the recipe said, and it turned out just like back home. I can't wait to try Chef John's Santa Maria style beans. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!

I don't care about he history lesson. This is great! I put it on the smoker until it hits 110°-115° internal temp and then sear it until rare-medium rare. So good.

Saved the rest as bulk an sliced to desired
thickness as to how I was going to use it.
Got a li'l too much char but next time I will turn 
direct burners down a few

Been getting our Tri-Tip from a restaurant that features Tri ONLY.I've used this recipe four times now and it just gets better and better.Would never get the restaurant meat again.I felt like taking pictures of last nights meal but thought that might be 'bragging'.It wasn't me..it was the recipe.

Delicious marinade with many layers of flavor. Very good detailed instructions about how to grill this for the best results. However, cooking on high started a fire with black billowing smoke. Probably from the oil in the marinade. My advise is to lower the flame a bit after getting it on the grill. It was very delicious!

My family loves tri tip and we really enjoy this recipe.  I use 1 tsp of Dijon mustard. I also used balsamic vinegar too when I was out of red wine vinegar.  Both are great!

I made this last night and it was the BOMB! My husband said I have to make the next tri tip this way again. I love that all the ingredients are all natural. The only thing I did different was mince the garlic and I didn't have paprika so I used chili powder. I also didn't cut the meat as others have suggested and it still came out super juicy!

I have made this recipe several times and it received great reviews from my dinner guests.   Follow the recipe exactly for consistent results.  Twice I cooked this in the oven using the broiler mode for the direct heat, trying to mimic the grill.  Both times I set off the smoke alarms... keep the exhaust fans running on high !!

This was an unbelievable good recipe, as all of Chef Johns recipes. It is -30 Celsius here so seared it in cast iron and finished it in the oven till 135 internal. Made Philly cheesesteak sandwiches out of it. Amazing.

This roast was amazing. I was concerned that it would be too tough since my roast was about a pound larger than what the recipe called for. It came out great. I cooked it on a gas grill at about 500*F for about 30 minutes turning and basting just like the recipe called for. I will definitely cook it again. it was incredibly juicy and had a range if levels from medium well at the edges to medium rare in the center.

Crusty outside, tender, juicy inside. Perfect! Did not leave on the grill as long as stated in recipe. Checked temp at 20 minutes, roast was already above recommended temp. It was a hot fire! Pulled and let rest - fantastic. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Excellent recipe. I only had about 3 hours for it to sit with the rub on it and that was plenty of time for great flavor.  I used smoked paprika instead of paprika, so it had a smoky flavor even though cooked on a gas grill.

Beautiful wet/dry ingredients. I did use smoked paprika, fresh rosemary chopped. Only difference will be turning grill heat down a bit, up the time. It was too raw in the center. I don't have a thermometer. Otherwise, a definite keeper. Thanks (again), Chef John!

I didn't "love" the flavor of the rub/baste combo. It was fine but just fine. I will not use this recipe again. 

I truly appreciate the folk(s) who took the time to upload everything, thank you (all) just wasn't thrilled by the flavor.

It was good and easy to make but super salty. If I make it again, I will probably omit the salt.

I made this with a 2.8 lb tri-tip roast. It was good but not amazing as I was hoping.  A couple things fell short for me flavor-wise, and it wasn't as easy to grill as it appeared to be in the video.  I'm going to try it a few more times though. 

The amount of rub just barely covered the roast.  If I make it again I would double all of the ingredients except the salt. You will end up with more than you need but you can just toss the extra.

Grilling was tougher than expected.  The juice from the roast and the basting sauce continually fell into the fire causing the flame to rise.  The roast caught on fire several times. So I had to move it over to the other side of the grill, wait for the flame to go down, then move it back over.  I understand the video shows a high flame, but if I kept the roast in that high of a  flame for whole time it would have been charcoal on the outside.

It took 35-40 min to cook.  That could be because it was 0.3 lbs more and/or because I had to keep moving it aside.  I definitely recommend using a meat thermometer.  You won't be able to tell when it is done from looking at the exterior or by the amt of cooking time. 

In the end, the roast was flavorful.  The ends were well done and the middle was medium, just like the video.  The outside was crispy and tasty.  Though next time I would double the ingredients except for the salt.

One small modification was that I replaced paprika with chili powder because of a food allergy.

I found this recipe with the video years ago. Remember Springpad? I saved this video recipe to that pretty awesome web clipping app that grabbed the video and the recipe nicely formatted. Then went belly up w/o silicone valley investors. Evernote/OneNote and recipe software apps like AR/BO nicely format recipes, though. So glad it's here on AR!
This is DELICIOUS!  The part I have to remember is to start the rub and get the meat up to room temperature before it's time to start cooking it on the grill. The mix of spices just get into the meat and it's so darn good.  
It's amazing when I follow the directions.  Better than any restaurant!  Yummy!!!!  I've used this for years, now!

I've made this once before for my brother in law.  We bother really liked it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.   I followed the recipe and it came out tender and juicy, perfectly cooked inside with crust on the outside.  I'm making this again this weekend.  I've coated the meat this time with olive oil, then applied the rub.  This will sit for 24 hours in the fridge.  I'll repost how this one comes out.  Tri Tip is not readily available here in north Texas, but Market Street carries it at $7.99 per pound.  Good quality as well.

First time grilling a tri tip! Worked out great didn’t use the cayenne pepper and only used 2 garlic cloves in the bast. Let it sit for about 20 hours in the fridge with the seasoning. When flipping every 4 mins I rotated just a tad. I had a water gun ready for flare ups. Grill heat was high till 8 mins then med high for another 24. Came out med well juicey and perfect for my family tastes. Didn’t cut into till after a 10 min rest. Served with grilled potatoes, grilled zucchini and maple baked beans.

This was amazing! We cooked it a little longer (to 145) because my husband likes his medium well, but there were still some medium rare slices after letting it rest for 15-20 minutes. Juicy and delicious! And not too salty - though I didn't follow the recipe exactly for the rub - I didn't have some ingredients, but I had a Trader Joe's Seasoning Salt that had most, plus a few extras, and I added rosemary, sage, dill, and a little extra salt - actually, I think that was the rub from the Oregon herb tri-tip rub recipe I found on here, but whatever - it was delicious! I didn't have red wine vinegar for the basting, so I added a little red wine to the white wine vinegar mixture. And we ran out of propane during pre-heating and didn't notice until we put the tri tip on the grill - we changed, put it up to high, and didn't baste until the 3rd flip when it was up to temp, and it still turned out great!

Next time we're making this for guests and serving Margaritas with it!

This was amazing. And yes I have had tri tip in Santa Maria, and yes I know this isn’t smoked. But this is just a deliciously wonderful recipe (as usual Chef John!!) I allowed the rubber meat to rest in the fridge 24 hrs. And I made my basting sauce with golden balsamic since I didn’t have any red wine vinegar. It turned out amazing. Thank you for yet another winner recipe Chef John.

Oh my gosh!!! This recipe was amazing! I followed the instructions, except that I used my own dry rub mix. I didn't refrigerate the meat for 4 hours, but did let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes with the dry rub on it. The garlic-vinegar mixture added so much flavor to the meat. It was surprisingly juicy and tender. Grilling took about 25 minutes to achieve a nice dark exterior, and medium rare inside.

I went for the more simplistic route, as in no cayenne pepper or paprika but it was delicious and beautiful. It was raining so I made it on my stovetop grill pan instead of my outside grill.

My family loved it.  I had a large tri tip planned on making tacos tomorrow.  Not a chance it was gone.  I did one slight change.  I added cayenne pepper I used just under a teaspoon It was not spicey at all next time I may add 1/4 more cayenne pepper.  Even my 3 year old granddaughter ate it up.  

I was so unsure of the vinegar mix.  I just wanted to follow the recipe, so I actually made a special trip to buy apple cider vinegar.  When I returned I looked up recipe... UGH  Red wine.  Lucky I had it on hand..

Thank you Chef John love your videos.  I doubt you read these reviews.  Do you make new viedos on a regular if so how do we sign up to receive notifications?

Great history behind this recipe.

Cook as instructed and make sure you don't let the heat get away from you on the grill (it is all to easy to do with propane).  You can EASILY up the spices if you want a little more flavor, but don't skimp on the basting each time you turn it over and do that at least as frequently as they advise.

This might have been good had my husband not killed it on the BBQ. The flavor was good, the crust was good, but he choose to cook it for the full 30 minutes and it was over done, not what I was going for, but perfect for him (I wonder if that was his plan all along?). I will use this rub again, but use a meat thermometer, 20minutes would have been better for our tri-tip.

I made this recipe the first time exactly as stated and it was awesome! The second time I accidentally reversed the marinate with the rub:) So I marinated in the vinegar mixture and then added the rub and it was also amazing. You can't go wrong with this.

We followed this recipe to the T, it turned out perfect. This was our first Beef Tri-Tip, 1.9 lb the flavor was out of this world. A little kick, just enough everyone loved it. Had leftovers the next day, planning to cook again. Leftovers would be great in a salad for lunch.

This is a great recipe and easy to make.  The finished product is reminiscent of prime rib.  I usually don't get this cut of meat, but I will not shy away from buying it in the future.

Wow! What a delicious dish this turnout out to be. The hardest part was trying not to eat it all while I was carving it up. Will make again.

Chef, your recipes are always good and dependable. I have begun to rely on them for new items that I am trying. But it's a little hard to follow your cadence some time. I'm listening on a laptop with small speakers.  The tri tip recipe was perfect. I was afraid it would be tough and we like extra rare meat. But tri tip has to be cooked so I followed the temp. setting and it was fine
Thanks

My 16 year old seasoned it and my husband grilled it. It was extremely flavorful and moist. Two teenagers and two adults gobbled up 3lbs in no time! Thanks, chef John for such a tasty, easy to follow, crowd pleaser!

Well...I made a mistake that turned out to be just fine. I added the spices (used Red Pepper flakes and some black pepper, too)  to the red wine vinegar and oil. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Marinated a Sirloin Tip Roast for 4 hours in the frig and then grilled it according to the instructions. Yum.

No changes, I now live in Wa. State, but I grew up in the heart of tri tip country.  We used to grill it over red oak, no red oak here but good quality charcoal did it up right. What you need is a smokin hot grill and a hunk of tri tip. Cook to 130 internal temp totaly charred on the outside and there you have it. Santa Maria style tri tip. Yummy. Thanks chef John!

Great flavor! I added some of the basting sauce to the meat 20 minutes prior to putting on the grill. I removed the meat at 120 degrees and let it rest for 15 minutes. It was perfect.

This is simply amazing. We've been looking for a good recipe for awhile and decided to try this one. I read the directions wrong and placed meat in oil and vinegar marinade instead of using as a baste for it.
 It. Was. Amazing.

Made this last weekend and it was delicious. Only had the dry rub on for 2 hours but still had a ton of flavor.  Had a 5 pound tri tip so ended up doubling the recipe.

Hands down, the best tri tip I've ever had.  Absolutely delicious, moist, tender, and outstanding flavor.  I used a 3 lb. tri tip.

This will now be my go-to recipe whenever I do tri tip and I may try it on other cuts as well.

This was amazing! The only thing we did differently was to let the meat sit with the rub for 24 hours. Of course this was not on purpose, the hubby and I had an emergency and were unable to grill it the night we planned. I have no idea if it made a difference but the results were awesome! We actually fought over the leftovers. :)

GREAT FLAVOR ! Perfect volume amount of Marinade/Basting Sauce. Over hot coals, basting & turning every 4 minutes, the cooking times should be :

20-25 minutes for Mid Rare (Warm Red Center) 130 Degrees
25-30 minutes for Medium...(Warm Pink Center) 150 Degrees

Add 10 Degrees as it "Rests" off heat, for 15 minutes.

Adjust accordingly.

EXCELLENT RECIPE ! THANK YOU.

This was very good switch up from plain old roasts. I pierced the meat with a pairing knife prior to marinating and let it marinate all day so there was not any vinegar left over as it sucked up all the liquid. I also increased the paprika and cayenne as we like it a little spicy. Will definitely make again as this was a hit the first time round. I never worry that I will have an epic failure with chef John’s recipes!

Followed the recipe exactly. However, I didn't have onion powder so I left it out. I did double the vinegar oil mixture and used a mop to apply it throughout the cooking process. At 130 internal temperature, the center is about medium rare(which we love) but if you want it well done might want to cook longer than 30 mins.

Turned out great! I cooked a 3 pounder along with mesquite smoke.  I actually added all the ingredients,  even vinegar, garlic and oil together in a gallon bag and marinated the meat for 24 hours In fridge. Saving this recipe.  Easy and delicious.

I started off to make this recipe exactly as described. Unfortunately life got in the way and I was unable to grill it after only 4 hours marinating time. Instead it marinated over 24 hours! I then grilled it as described using the sauce that was also made the day before. It was delicious! So don't worry if you have to leave this Tri-Tip marinating in the rub overnight. The recipe is very forgiving.

so I don't mean to be a sour ball but clearly I'm going to be. just a thought, wouldn't it be better to cook it over a lower heat so that you don't have that black crust, all that black crust is is carbon material that is not going to work well with your biology. (i.e. probably not good for your health in the long run). other than that this recipe seems delish!

I just made this with some slight revisions.  I made the rub but added some thyme & a favorite coffee rub I buy at Gordon Foods Supply.  I cooked it on my Vision Kamado Grill first over direct coals at 500-550F 4-5 minutes per side twice.  Then I installed the lava stone, closed the vents down & finished it at 350-400F for about 20-25 minutes until it was 132F internal.  Fabulous!

Tasted great. The basting liquid helped make it moist and not tough and chewy. I put the dry rub on and let it sit in fridge for 24 hrs before cooking. As it is winter I pan seared 4 mins per side in cast iron pan, then put it in 400 F oven for 20 mins flipping and basting as suggested. Let rest for 10 mins. Served with Kale and Broccoli Salad.

Exceptional ! We will be serving this deliciousness time and again, the recipe doesn't need to be modified but at times if one doesn't have the exact ingredients, I don't think it would harm this recipe at all...

Finger licking good, very tasty. Grilled it on my gas grill + some wood chips to give it a good smoking flavor. Bet it tastes even better on a charcoal grill.

I made this more or less as specified, but I used tri-tip steak instead of roast. I didn't measure the ingredients precisely, and perhaps put in a too much salt because my wife said is was a little too salty. But the next day when she had the leftovers she had no complaints. In any case we really enjoyed it.

The tri-tip was delicious. Very tender with a crisp crust of flavor.

This was so delicious!  My meat was even frozen prior to this and you couldn't even tell.  This recipe was not nearly as salty as other pre-packaged ones.  This was tender, juicy and flavorful, my whole family loved it!

I too am from Santa Maria, California and this is not traditional Santa Maria Style tri-tip. Garlic powder (or granulated garlic), black pepper, and seasoned salt are all you put on as a rub. The secret is that it must be grilled over oak wood. To make a great tri-tip sandwich, fill a toasted-on-the-grill sourdough hoagie roll with sliced tri-tip and then top the tri-tip with some homemade salsa! Perfection.

This has become our Sunday dinner go-to.  We didn't really care how "authentic" to the Santa Maria original this was, not being from there or anything, so we weren't worried about that comparison.  But this is a simple and delicious way to prepare tri-tip.  I usually tweak recipes, adding more spice, etc.  This one is on point just as it is!

My wife loves this recipe! I don't change the recipe but  I do marinade with the wine vinegar/oil mixture about an hour before starting to grill. The flavor is amazing.

This is an excellent tri- tip recipe. I also used crushed garlic as well as garlic powder. I cooked out on the grill for 20 minutes until black and on all sides , and then let bake on the grill for five more minutes. The outer portions were medium rare and the middle of the roast was closer to rare which was fine for us. As others have mentioned I let the roast rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. The roast was perfectly cooked and juicy; I would highly recommend.

Our family loved the flavors of this recipe! Instead of grilling, I decided to try cooking it sous-vide. I coated the tri-tip with the dry rub for 4 hours in the fridge, as instructed, then added the vinaigrette to the sealed plastic bag when I put the meat in the water bath. I let it cook for 6 hours at 130F, then finished it by searing all sides in a very hot pan and letting it rest 10 minutes. It was perfect! We will be making this again.

We raise our own beef, and the only roast I had at the time was a chuck roast. This recipe was wonderful. The roast was a beautiful rare to medium rare, the flavor was spread throughout all of the meat, and the outer crust was absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a fan of roasts on the grill, but I'll be making this one again. I'm not a rosemary fan, so I left that ingredient out.

I made the rub exactly as described.  I used it on a 3# tri tip and loved it so much I made a batch 6x larger to save for later use.  I imagine this will go great on beer can chicken.

I would for sure make this again. Not much better then tri-tip leftovers for lunch the next day! I wouldn't change a thing! It's so easy a caveman could do it. Delicious! Black on the outside and pink in the center just like my women!

I made it using bottom sirloin steaks and it was excellent. I will definitely make it again. I cooked about 5 minutes to long so we didn't have any rare. It was very easy!

Mine and my hubby's favorite trip tip recipe! Always juice and full of flavor!

The only thing I do differently is I use olive oil instead of canola.

I loved this recipe! I just used the spice rub, (from step 1) put it in the refrigerator for  several hours, then I let it sit for 30 min before cooking it in the oven on 350 for 35 min then 405 for 25 more min. But my roast was twice the size of the one in this recipe. The oven worked well. I did baste it in its own juices a few times. So delicious! A bit spicy though for kids.

Fantastic!  I've used the same Tri Tip rub for years and saw this and tried it for a change.  My family loved it!  I was unable to grill the trip tip, so I roasted in the oven at 425.  (I did use a roasting pan and rack.)

Smoked it with my kamodo grill  at 300 degrees using pecan and cherry wood; finished in the oven at 450 degrees with a cast iron skillet for a reverse sear. It was unbelievable - the kind of food that makes it seem like all in life is pretty dang good.

I can't say whether this recipe approximates the taste of Santa Maria tri tip beef , but we have enjoyed Morton's of Omaha Steakhouse Classic Tri Tip roasts from our local Costco.  When they were no longer available, (after a brief period of mourning), I went on a hunt for a home remedy.  Eureka!  This recipe is the solution for us.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and was very pleased with the results.  For our taste however, the next time I will cut the salt to 1 teaspoon instead of 2.  So very happy to have found this recipe.  Thank you Chef John!

No changes other than no BBQ available. So it was done indoors on a cast iron skillet.  This was a delicious recipe that we will definitely make again!

This recipe produced great flavor.  We bought the meat on sale at a grocery and it was tough.  Any ideas on how to make it more tender?

The family loved it and I used it on Tri-tip steaks grilled on the BBQ.  I did make a small change because I did not have any red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and since this was the first time trying it, I am not sure if it changed the tasted significantly.  Will use it again.

I had to substitute the rosemary with thyme, thawed and marinated it in 1 hour and ended up over-cooking it a bit and it still turned out delicious! Definitely have to try it again when I am better prepared and can do it proper.

Holy cats, this was great! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but it did sit in the fridge wth the rub overnight... But that can only make it better, right?! Wound up doing 6 turns after 4 min each, and while it was blackened on the outside it was definitely not "charred" but had a perfect BBQ flavored crust and the middle was a beautiful pink. The basting truly is the key to this delicious meat! Served over a mixed greens salad (made a half batch of extra marinade for the dressing) with crumbled smoked blue cheese, and fresh corn on the cob. A huge hit with the family, even the pre-teen girls, and will add this to the favorites rotation!

Best tri tip recipe ever!!!!  My kids love steak and this did not disappoint.  The spices were perfect.  I have made it twice once with a tri tip, and once with a sirloin roast that was on sale.  Both were perfect.

Have made this several times and it is excellent. I think the key is in the oil/vinegar/garlic sauce used during grilling. The crusty outer layer adds great texture and taste.

This is my first tri-tip and it is so delicious! Even though it's not "authentic" the flavor is incredible and the cut of meat does so well on the grill. This will be a repeat in our home.

WOW! I doubled everything for two tri tips, following the recipe to a T (actually added a little extra cayenne). The flavor and texture of the meat was incredibly good. Recipe is now "in the rotation". Can't wait to try the amazing rub and marinade on other meats. Kudos Chef John!

Wow! My family and I all loved this, which doesn't happen often with beef. Not ever eating Santa Maria before, I had nothing to compare it to. I didn't have charcoal so I broiled it, 7 min each side, a total of 35 minutes for a temp of 135-140 depending on its' thickness.  Beware that your smoke alarms will go off and to cook while the windows are open.

Made it exactly like the recipe. I'm not positive what Santa Maria is suppose to taste like I've never had it but I can say that it came out awesome! I seen one person say they didn't like the char not sure if you used a trimmed Tri tip but that's what I used I can see one with a lot of fat on it getting pretty chard just my opinion to use a trimmed one. Still will get a little char from the basting.

Cooked the meat in the Toaster Oven broiler, since meat was thick, cooked 12 minutes on each side and it was medium rare and juicy.

This was wonderful, although next time I think I'll not add cayenne pepper.  The meat came out perfect, and now I know how to get that beautiful crust on the outside.

I've never grilled a ''whole'' Tri-Tip before... I followed the recipe to the ''T''.... It's amazing how moist & delicious this is with all the spices.. I did leave the seasoned roast overnight in the refrigerator.. I took it out about an hour before grilling to bring it to room temperature.. then on the grill it went... I turned it every four minutes, basted, then turned after 4 min... It ''blackened'' up nicely and had great flavor, even the next day!  Will definitely make this again... Thanks Chef John for the video too... was very helpful for me!!

Simple and awesome. I did experience 'charring' mentioned  in another review, but it was on the very fatty side of my cut only and easily removed. The rub and sauce are perfect, though I had no dijon, so I just used a little mustard powder. I recommend making more of the marinade.
I cooked mine on the standard Weber charcoal BBQ and found it probably took 5-6 flips to get the meat to an internal 130... Also, keep a little water bottle for flare ups when you baste.

Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Love the flavor the red wine vinegar basting gives.

Marinated for 24 hr's and the taste was great.  Those that are sensitive to the spicyness of cayenne should probably cut back on it.
Keep your thermometer handy and check your the meat temperature often since your cut of meat may dictate a shorter grill time.

Excellent and relatively simple. I don't care for Rosemary, so I left it out and it still turned out great, the whole family loved it.

I used only the dry ingredients as a rub on a 2.25lb piece... I am in love with this cut and seasoning. The whole family ate it and begged for more!

Delicious recipe. I would recommend you watch the video for the grilling technique, it really helped me in not over charring the outside. I did over cook it (160 degrees) lost track of time...however everyone said it still tasted delicious. Next time I make this I will be sure to check the temp after 30 mins max. and cook to 130 - 140 degree temp.

Made this exactly as directed except I left the seasoning on the meat all day instead of just 4 hours and I turned the grill heat down from high to medium. It turned out great. Definitely will have this again!!

This was a total Home Run right out of the batter's box!!!  I really pride myself in grilling especially steaks.  I have to tell you it was about the best grilled beef I have ever had!!!  The only advice I would give would be to check your meat temp after 25 minutes.  Mine was done at that point.  If I went with 35 as mentioned I would have over cooked it.  Grills vary as most outdoor cooks know.  Try it and you will not be disappointed!
