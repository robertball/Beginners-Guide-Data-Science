I made two cheesecakes, one using Pam's crust recipe and the second using the traditional graham cracker crust recipe (Crumbs, sugar, melted butter).  The cheesecake that had the traditional graham cracker crust recipe was the best.  (Sorry Pam, I did not care for your crust).The cheesecake filling itself was awesome, it was very tastey.  Very easy to make.  I give this a thumbs up (except for the crust)

I chose this cheesecake recipe because it only calls for 3 pkgs. cream cheese, which I preferred over some of the other recipes that called for 4 or 5! pkgs.  I wanted a classic cheesecake, and this fits the bill.  Texture is very creamy.  I did use another recipe for the crust (1 1/2 C graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 C melted butter, 1/4 C sugar - bake for 10 minutes).  I've made other cheesecakes in the past, and have had problems with cracking or sinking in the middle.  This one looks perfect, due to the water bath.  I did have trouble with water leaking into the springform pan (I ended up making the crust twice because the first one was ruined), but will experiment a bit more with the technique to get it just right.  I read online to use a plastic turkey oven bag instead of the foil.  No leaks! I served the cheesecake with a seedless raspberry sauce I made from frozen berries and sugar. This made an excellent birthday cake for my BF.

This is the best tasting cheesecake. 
I added two tablespoons of Grand Marnier and grated some orange zest on the top. Also a sprinkle of allspice..

This was my first from scratch baked cheesecake.  It was awesome.  I did not use the crust I used a traditional crust but otherwise followed the directions to the letter and it came out perfect.  This has become a new favorite.

Followed recipe exactly and loved it! I actually prefer the crust over the traditional crust. Only difference is that it only took about 45 minutes to bake. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made cheesecakes for years, and this was a good one, easy and quick to make. It is also probably the prettiest one I have ever made,  the top was perfectly smooth no cracks (have done them in water baths before none ever came out this good). My only regret is that Jumbo Eggs were on sale for the week, purchased before I decided to make this cake and I believe that 4 of those eggs were a bit overpowering.  Other than that,  the family seemed to really like it.

Excellent creamy cheesecake recipe!  I added a blueberry topping to the last one I made with fresh blueberries and it was outstanding!

I made this cheesecake feeling a little skeptical...all the cheesecake I have made in the past are always to sweet and not cheesy! But this one is so delicious. I get request to make it all the time! Didn't change a thing except I like a thicker graham cracker crust with another recipe from here and its the most delightful thing in the world! Love it!

This cheesecake is very tasty! I changed the crust recipe to be more like the Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe on this site and it turned out wonderful. Also, I let all the ingredients stay out to get room temperature. One of the reasons I like this recipe is that it makes a smaller cheesecake than usual. The only problem I had with this recipe was the cheesecake nearly poofed out of its pan while it was baking! However, I think it was my fault because I used a hand mixer to whip all the ingredients together...! The cheesecake did fall back on itself after cooling and tasted and looked just fine. All in all, I would use this recipe again when I want to make a smaller cheesecake, but without using a hand mixer!

This was an awesome cheesecake. It was my first time to bake a cheesecake and it came out BETTER than any I'd ever had! The only alteration I made was to add 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract and baked only 60 minutes. I got fresh pitted cherries and soaked them in sugar overnight in the fridge and used them as a topper on the cake. AWESOME! I chilled it overnight before serving. Nice dense, creamy cake!

This is hands down the best cheesecake and talk about easy.  I did bake this in a 2" water bath with foil around my 8" springform pan. Make sure you use a slow cooker bag on outside of your pan  to prevent water from seeping into the foil of your springfoam pan (water will still seep even with 3 layers of foil, LOL)

The crust listed does not do this justice, so I highly recommend making a graham cracker crust just Like others stated as well (who knows what this baker was thinking as the crumb crust she listed is a joke).
Thanks for the great cheesecake recipe!!!!

This is hands down the best cheesecake ever! Funny allrecipes doesn't give it as a result when searching cheesecake recipes, because this is really 5 stars! 

I use a traditional crust & never use that bath idea. I'm too scared the water will get in the pan & why waste all that foil?

I just use a cake pan of water in the rack below & stick it in the oven at the preheating stage.

You can also make 1/2 this recipe & it fits perfectly in a regular 'ol pie plate.

When I do that - I just put some water in the bottom of an oven proof skillet & plop the pie plate in that & stick it all in the oven. Works like a charm!
