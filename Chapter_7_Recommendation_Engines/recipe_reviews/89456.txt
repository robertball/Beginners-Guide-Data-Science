These are great.  My husband keeps telling me not to ever lose this recipe.  I made a dip using a mashed avocado, 1/2 cup ranch dressing and 1/2 cup sour cream.

We changed this up a bit and loved it!  Adding cilantro makes the flavors pop.  We used pepper jack cheese, more cumin, chopped garlic and a bit less spinach.  My husband and I enjoy finding recipes, adding our own flare and making it together!  It's a great thing to do on "date night".

this recipe is great, just like the ones they serve at Chili's!  I made a WASABI -RANCH dipping sauce using equal amounts of ranch dressing and Wasabi sauce or a little more Wasabi than Ranch if you like it spicy.  IT TASTES SOOO GOOD with this dipping sauce.

I make these all the time and my family loves them.  I usually double the recipe, add at least a cup of chicken and less spinach. I wrap the filling in tortillas and bake.

The egg rolls turned out absolutely perfect.  I doubled the recipe just in case as I have a large family, but ended up with 20 extra egg rolls (can anyone say LEFTOVERS!?).    Being inexperienced I wasn't quite sure what to do with the spinach (leave raw or cook).  I took the safe route and cooked the leaves down in olive oil and salt beforehand.  Tasted just fine in the end product.    The recipe calls for frozen corn.  Again I took the safe route and brought them to room temperature before the mix.  I added extra cumin, as the amount recommended didn't seem to come out much in the pre frying taste.  I also sliced up some avocados and reduced the amount of filling to a little less than 1 /4 cup to compensate.    Prior to filling the egg roll wraps, I drained the filling one more time.  I noticed any left over moisture would go right through the wraps.  Anyway I think the inside of the rolls should not be wet at all after the frying.  A tip on the sealing of the wraps was to not only use water but to add flour and water (1 part water to 1 part flour).  It made a much better paste as opposed to just the water.  Obviously excess flour just fried off anyway and wasn't noticeable.  But it sure made closing the fat wraps easier.  For half the batch I used just corn oil for frying.  For the other half I used half olive oil and half corn oil.  I thought it turned out crispier and tastier with the second route.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you.

Yummy - thanks for the recipe - a couple things I did for personal preference only - omitted spinach and added cabbage, marinated a chicken breast in lime juice, honey, cumin. garlic, S&P and then cooked - sheredded and added to filling mix. baked the wrapped egg rolls in 350 oven to reduce the oil content.

I have been looking for a recipe like this to match the southwest spring rolls served at Damons.  I just made this recipe and it is awesome!  The only thing I changed about the recipe was I I added a 10 oz. can of white chicken.  I served it with ranch dressing mixed with Frank's hot sauce.  My husband and I devoured them and it made enough that we freezed some for another night.  Thank you so much for this great recipe...Damons doesn't have anything on you.

Wonderful, flavorful filling. Couldn't find egg roll wrappers so I used the 7" tortillas an earlier reviewer suggested and very glad I did. Instead of frying, I sprayed with Pam and baked at 375 for about 15-20 minutes, until the filling was bubbly. We ate these with the cilantro cream dip and it was phenomenal. Need to add this to our menu rotation!

These were really good.  I was so pleased that the egg roll wrappers were easy to work with and they turned out great!  I didn't have the right cheese, next time I'm going to play around with different types of cheeses.  Great recipe!

Wow - these were amazing!

We put a little lime juice on them after they were cooked, which made them even better.  I think next time I'll make a lime-ranch sauce to serve with them.

Delicious!  I loved the idea of putting a southwestern twist on egg rolls, but I wasn't sure if what sounded good in theory would taste good in reality. I was very happily surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of increasing the amount of cumin by 1/2 tsp and adding a tsp. of chili powder (but the spice amounts are really a matter of personal preference anyway).  Oh and to keep these guys sealed, I found that mixing cornstarch and water really helps.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I have made this several times and finally found the way to cook these that I like best.  I add more cheese, more corn for sweetness, and use cilantro instead of spinach. I also use a minced jalapeno pepper for some heat.  I use Amy's cilantro dip and add a half of guacamole to it. My favorite way to cook these are using  Mission Ready to Cook flour tortillas.   I make a paste of flour and water to seal all the seams and deep fry them at 375.  They sealed and cooked perfectly.   I was worried these might get soggy, but they didn't last that long.

I read the reviews beforehand so I kicked up the spice a bit but these were really good and a lot easier than I thought they would be. Thanks!

Lovely! These were a huge hit at a Mexican themed party recently. They didn't need meat at all and are very versatile. I used an 8-ounce bag of cheese and I suggest increasing the cheese and maybe using half cheddar and half pepperjack, because southwest is spicy, right? And I also increased the corn and added some taco seasoning. I used half of a white onion in addition to the green onion and I might use a jalapeno next time, too. For a sauce, I mixed pre-made ranch dip with hot salsa and that was a perfect complement. Yum!

I make these often!  Instead of egg roll wrappers, I use flour tortillas, and I bake them in the oven at 375 for about 16 minutes.  (spray them with olive oil first to make them crispy)  I've made these for guests and they love them too!

Delicious! I couldn't find egg rolls at my grocery store so I used small tortilla shells and it was amazing! The ingredients seem so simple but when they're combined and heated up they come out tasting fabulous! Will be making this one again and again!

These are great...however, I make an Avocado- ranch dip like they serve in the restaurant...the wasabi ranch mentioned by another user is served with the boneless shanghai wings...also, I use 7-inch tortillas instead of egg roll wrappers.  They are more like the restaurant style.   ( and I actually like them better than the restaurant!)

My first attempt at making any kind of egg roll, and I admit it took a few attempts to get the rolling right.  Pretty happy with the way they turned out for an egg roll novice.  Next time I make these, I may add a little cayenne or hot sauce to the filling (just a matter of taste preference), and maybe some chopped red bell pepper or pimento.  Very good.

Needs a good sauce, like chipotle ranch, possibly a little more cumin and onion. I also added shredded chicken. Still, the boys loved it. I heard primo! at least 10 times.

Definitely a keeper for Superbowl Sunday and other holidays! We tried these baked and fried - the verdict was that fried was the way to go. Super yummy and an interesting fusion. Like!

Have made these several times...my ex-GF suggested broiling in lieu of frying for a healthier way to cook these. Both ways were equally good.
Variations have included adding shredded chicken, various spices and tossing in a can of diced green chili peppers.

I left out the green onion, and used cheddar instead of monteray jack (that's all I had). These were AMAZING. Even the kids gobbled them up. Served with a mixture of ranch and salsa. Definitely a keeper!!!

I think the insides of this could be changed up to suit any taste.  I didn't add onions and used frozen, drained spinach and added brown rice in part of the batch.  My family loved them.  I will be making them again!

These were relatively bland.  To kick them up a notch, I doubled the cumin, added 1 tsp chipotle powder and 1 c chopped chicken, and used pepperjack cheese.  That definitely did the trick and would have earned this recipe 5 stars to begin with.  These are also good in tortillas as "burritos" and you can substitute kidney beans for the black beans without losing too much of the "southwest" flavor.

Great idea! I had some egg roll wrappers that needed to be used, so I did a search for fun ways to fill them and this recipe came up. I ended up jazzing my filling with more cumin, some chipotle pepper, and salt & pepper. Thanks for the recipe = the guys loved them!

First, I used canned, drained chicken breast instead and it came out great. The weirdest thing happened though... the filling mixture tasted awesome until I added the cheese....then the flavor sort of disappeared. So, next time I will add less cheese, or none at all. Second, I used actual egg roll wraps and baked them instead of fried...they came out very crispy and yummy! I think next time though, I will flash fry them, just to get that traditional egg roll greasy flavor.

i used garlic salt and added some chili powder and a little cayenne pepper and some cubed chicken. instead of making these into eggrolls, i wrapped them in tortillas and put them in the oven at 350 for a few minutes, just to be a little more healthy. i also made a dipping sauce with some mashed avocado and equal amounts of ranch and sour cream. my boyfriend and i gobbled it all up.

Almost every restaurant now has it's own variation of this recipe, but I have to say the ones I make at home now are my favorite!!! Thanks so much for this recipe. I did try a little variation of my own...I used jalapeno pepper jack cheese to give an extra little kick and instead of the egg roll wrappers I used lumpia wrappers. They are very thin and crispy like a phyllo dough. I made mine thin more like spring rolls this made it easier to be a finger food and I served with avocado ranch dipping sauce - one part mashed avocado, one part ranch dressing. Easy and goes very well with this dish. Thanks so much!!!

Great recipe, did add a few things to give it some pizzazz: 1 teaspoon chili powder, dash of cayenne pepper if you like, and I used the mexican blend of cheeses from the grocery store instead of just monterey jack...it consists of mont jack but also 3 other mexican cheeses for extra punch. Also threw in finely minced 1/4 cup red bell pepper.  I rolled in eggroll wrappers sprayed with pam in the oven for healthier version but still crispy. WOW this is a KEEPER!

This is a good recipe, with room for additions, which I will do when I make them again. But, I made them just as the recipe states, and enjoyed them, but know I will like them much better with a little more spice, maybe some chicken, and try different wraps. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy.  We made the filling exactly as the recipe called for and then added a few things given what we had on hand.  We added a couple jalepanos to each one, a small amount of sauted chicken and a small dollop of sour cream and salsa just before we closed it to put it in the oven.  We used small tortillas and baked them in the oven @ 350 for 5 ~ 10 minutes. Perfect.  This is a new favorite.

Made per the recipe, these were bland. I think they will be much better if I had roasted poblano peppers or at least some jalapenos. I dipped them in a combination of salsa and sour cream. This is definitely a versitile recipe.

I LOVE these eggrolls!!!! I always order them at Chili's and TGIF's, they used to sell them frozen at the grocery store and I haven't been able to find them anymore, so when I saw this recipe I was so happy I can make them myself now!!! Thank you for posting this one! This is the only way to get myself and some of my family to eat spinach!!

I made a few changes to this dish and it turned out really great. Instead of baby spinach I doubled the corn, green onions and cheese, and added 1 cup finely diced chicken. I then baked the rolls in the oven by coating a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray, spraying the rolls and TURNING HALFWAY through for 15 minutes at 425 degrees. It was great, espcially with Asian fried rice on the side.

This recipe is great! It's been my favorite for a long time. You can also use the filling for chicken quesadillas. Instead of deep frying, lay them in a baking dish, pour a mixture of cream of chicken mixed with sour cream over, top with cheese, and bake it all together. Yam!

I loved this! I would added a little more cumin and some red pepper flake for heat. I also used small wonton wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers, for a smaller treat.

Great with ranch dressing!

So delicious, I make these all the time. For extra flavor and spice, try with chipotle-cheddar cheese (made by Sargento)--I make it with this all the time. Don't be afraid to add lots of extra cumin and chili powder. Add 1 lime of lime juice too, really good extra flavor.

I took the suggestion many had about using egg roll wraps but I thought they were tasteless.  I found the best thing was to use the large 12 inch wraps. They come in a varitey of flavors and I just microwaved them in the moist cloth and they were easy to use as well as tasty.  Many people suggested Amy's Cilanto sauce with it. I hated that. It went straight from the blender to the garbage. I used a spicy duck sauce for dipping.  They are time consuming to make but worth it.

Not bad, but I wish I had followed others' advice and added some chicken. I put them together, sprayed them lightly with butter-flavored Pam, and did them in the oven. Very good. Thanks!

I wanted to love these so much :(  I've had them at restaurants and like them, but these turned out pretty bland. I want to try them again, because I'm wondering if I did something wrong. I know there was WAY too much cheese for my taste, but I think that was my fault. I also assumed I was supposed to cook the spinach till it wilts - perhaps not? I added cilantro, but it didn't help the flavor much. I think it definitely needs chicken, but I'm not sure what else. I'll try again one day and see what I can come up with and update my post if I have more success.

My hubby really liked these, I used frozen spinach and after I squeezed a whole lime juice into the mix I put the shells in and boiled off a little of the extra liquid.  then continued as recipe stated.  I removed the lime shells before putting filling into wrappers.  I also used wonton wrappers since I had then on hand.  My hubby loved these, and that they had veggies in them.

I made these this weekend and they were ok. I made them just like it said but added a little bit more seasoning and chicken. I think next time I will add some peppers to kick it up a notch just to add somemore flavor. All in all I will made them again.

These could have been so yummy if they wern't so bland! All the ingredients were so good & I added chopped cilantro too. It definatley needed some flavor & I"m not exactly sure what kind. Maybe some salsa in there or chili powder, and some garlic & definatley needed more lime juice & lots of cilantro! I cut the baby spinach in half becuse its not my favorite. I might even omit this part & just do the other ingredients or add chicken or something to it. The concept is great & the ingredients were good, but it just needed a little more something to it! Otherwise, my kids ate them & I thought they were good dipped in ranch or sour cream.

These lacked a real southwest flavor to us.  We added a bunch more cumin, maybe some tomatoes and cilantro would help season the filling a bit more.  Were still good though.

These were a hit.  I made them in advance and froze them for a party.  I used carne asada in half and shredded chicken in the other half and omitted the spinach.  I also served them with Amy's Cilantro sauce and it was great!

These were amazing! I doubled the amount of cumin, added chopped fresh cilantro, added 1 fresh chopped jalapeno and a shake of red pepper flakes. I also used a whole 8oz bag of shredded cheese. This is a keeper for sure!

I used egg roll wrappers and took into account the "blandess" that others had reported.  I mixed in diced jalapenos and added some garlic salt.  Absolutely delicious!  Perfect vegetarian roll!

Loved them!! I made them for a New Year's Eve party that I am going to tonight and I know they will be a hit. My boyfriend and I had to try one right after we made them. I was pleased at how easy they were to make and how easy the egg roll wrappers were to deal with. I'll definately make these again!

These were good.  I did add some seasonings to give it a little more flavor.  I added red peppers, onion powder and cilantro.  I think next time I will add some diced chicken. I served this with the creamy avocado-ranch dip from this site, which was also good.

Made changes the second time, added some smoked chopped chicken thighs, everything else remained the same.  Oh and I added a big pinch of cayenne pepper to amp up the heat.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were delicious and easy to make. After reading some other reviews I used more cumin and less spinach. I actually used a box of frozen spinach ( what I had on hand) steamed and drained. I doubled the green onions ( we like them) and used a Mexican blend of cheese ( what I had). I made a dipping sauce for these using equal parts of wasabi and ranch- YUMMY. I froze what I didn't fry up and fried them up today and they were great. I love a recipe I can double then  freeze and have it available to me on a busy week day night. Thank you for sharing :-)

These were very good. Changes I made were to saute minced garlic and chopped fresh jalapeños with the onions. Also adding black pepper and a little cayenne to the spinach, corn, and beans. My sister liked sour cream as a dipping but I think I prefer chipotle ranch. Either way you can't go wrong. Very good.
