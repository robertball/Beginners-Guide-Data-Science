A hit at my home. I will definitely make it again. My family says “Soon”. Loved it with mashed redskin potatoes.

This was so good. I used a mandallin to slice the carrots and onions super thin. The gravy was amazing... scooped it over a baked potato. Added some salt to the chicken with the lemon pepper. My boyfriend literally licked his plate (he thinks he’s a Viking).

The "gravy" was too thin, so I added an additional slurry of 1 tablespoon of flour and broth. Otherwise quite good.

I was not a fan of the pan gravy. The taste of the chicken and vegetables was vibrant and tasty though. I’ll probably play around and tweak the gravy next time
