this is one of my all time faves, mom taught me.  I do it a bit different, just put the margerin on the split pita, I use scissors to cut and split.  Then I use an italian spice combo on the light side, add garlic powder and then top with parm.  I do not bake, I broil, takes maybe at most five minutes and is supper crispy.

Delicious! In fact they're so good, it's hard to eat just one! I did opt for olive oil vs. butter, but WOW were these good. You could eat them all by themselves but we dipped them in "Hummus IV"  from this site which took them over the top. My only caution is watch your baking time as they can burn easily. Overall, a definite keeper!

YUM. I did quadruple the garlic as we REALLY like garlic. Mine didn't come out crispy either but we didn't care anyway. We ate these with Garlic Cucumber Dip and really went to town. I always seem to find pita bread on the clearance rack so I know I'll make this quite every now and then for a fun weekend snack. Next time, I might try this with EVOO and maybe double the ingredients for the garlic brushing sauce.

These are really good and extremely easy to prepare. You can do the same thing with flour tortillas. Thanks Lisa.

Did not come out very crispy - use olive oil next time instead of butter?

These were great. I dont think 10 minutes was long enough to get them completely crispy so I will go for 12 next time. Very good served with any type of dip. Will make again as they are a great alternative to chips.

Very tasty!  These are so quick and easy, creative, and a good side when you don't want to fill up on tons of carbs.  They have just enough to satisfy that craving, but not fil  you up.

Not bad.  Mine came out really dry, so I served with garlic hummus.  Next time I will use less Italian seasoning, more garlic, and add some olive oil.  I served with the Bow tie sausage, tomato, and cream pasta recipe from this site.  Love that recipe!

Better than store bought!  I was hesitant that these would be as good, but they are so simple and so much cheaper that purchasing pita chips at the grocery store.  I spray each side of the pits pieces with olive oil and sprinkle seasoned salt on them...great!

If it were possible to give something a 6 star rating these would be it. I have been making something almost identical  for 3 yrs. It was one those off the top of my head recipes. I open the pita bread and separate the 2 halves so they are extra thin and turn out super crispy. After brushing the butter mixture over them I give them a sprinkle of Kosher salt and then bake. Betcha can't eat just 10!

Very easy. I usually just cut up pita bread to serve with dips, but this was way yummier, looked nicer and holds the dips better. I didn't have parmesan cheese and they still taste great.

Yummy!!!  Very quick and easy to make.  Tried 1/2 with Parmesan and 1/2 with shredded Mozerella - both ways delicious.  To get extra crispy turned on broiler for last few minutes.

Only had Honey Wheat at the store. Thought it was gonna be a flop...but was great. Everyone loved them. Use a well insulated pan and be sure to spread them out evenly.

I thought these were very yummy! It was a nice snack in the middle of my day. I did not cut the pitas in half before making into triangles. Thats the only change I made. I will say that I also made the Garlic Aioli from this site and used it to dip my pita bites into. It was the perfect combination of flavors. Thanks!

Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was just pita with cheese taste and they got very hard when cold.  Fresh pita and butter might have done the same trick.

Thse are fast and tasty, and a great way to use pitas that are a bit stale. I like to split them and brush on the butter mixture and then use a pizza cutter to slice them up. Thanks--this is a winner!

My family attacked these! They're so good and easy. I used a brush to quickly dab the pitas with the butter mixture. We had it with spaghetti and my daughter would open the pitas then stuff it.

I changed the recipe a bit and used Epicure pizza seasoning as I didn't have Italian and thought it would be similar - also baked them on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet and turned out fabulous!  They were eaten up in a matter of minutes I should have made more!  Quick and easy and will definitely make them again!

These are tasty little bites!  My pitas were very thin so they crisped up very well in the oven.  I just ate them by themselves.  I will make these again.

These are quite addicting!  All of us grabbed for these first, before touching the spaghetti I made with them.  I brushed on the 'sauce' on both sides and baked them on the lowest rack in the oven for 7 minutes each side. PERFECT!

Very good and you can certainly use olive oil instead of butter, if desired.  You can also try cooking them in a pan rather than in the oven!  Yummy!

I just popped these out of the oven and had to rate them right away. Delicious!!! They were so easy to prepare. I used whole wheat pita bread. I am taking them to work tomorrow to dip in hummus for lunch. What a wonderful (and healthy) alternative to greasy chips!

I made these for myself for a light/quick lunch.  At first it seems like there won't be enough sauce to pour over the pitas, but the flavor is VERY strong and you don't want too much, trust me!  They were a little too crunchy for me, so I will take them out of the oven sooner next time, also I didn't cut the pita's in half because I wanted them to be softer and not like a chip.  They were very good, I didn't even use a dip. Very good flavor.

Excellent!  We enjoyed these alongside sugar snap peas and carrot sticks with a roasted red pepper dip.  I combined a little melted olive oil spread with olive oil, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.  I brushed it over the pita and sprinkled with shredded Parmesan.  They made the house smell wonderful and were delicious to eat!

I wasn't crazy about these, and my company wouldn't touch them. Best straight from the oven, not very appetizing later, and overall the flavor wasn't fantastic.

These were so simple and so tasty-  warm and buttery and seasoned awesome.. Great snack size pieces for appetizers-  especially for hungry football fans..  Definately try these - Didnt even think they would turn out half as tasty being that it was such a no-brainer...

These were awesome.  I used a pastry brush to put the butter mixture on the cut up pitas.  I made these to go with a tzatziki recipe on this site and I have to say these saved the tzatziki (pretty bland) from being a disaster.  The little kids loved these by themselves.  Thanks!

Added 2 tbsp of olive oil and garlic salt along with minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh. Soaked the bites in a baggie with the mixture, then baked 3 minutes and flipped for the last 2 minutes. They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Paired well with Greek Lemon Chicken Soup.

These were so easy to prepare and they are super yummy!  My kids loved them too.  We originally made them to go with the Easy Roasted Red Pepper Hummus but have been dipping them in pizza sauce too.  These would be great with just about anything!  I only used 1 Tbsp. of Parmesan cheese.

Very good, and easy.  I put in olive oil simply bc I didn't want to bother with melting butter. I also just kind of dipped and brushed the pita with the garlic mixture, then baked.  They took more like 20 min to crisp up--I baked about 10-15 min on one side, then flipped over and baked some more.  However, I had pocketless pita so mine were twice the thickness the recipe calls for.  Thanks for the recipe idea!

These were great with some changes. I used olive oil instead of butter and I baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes until they were crispy and browning a little. The spices provided a nice flavor and they were delicious with the spinach and artichoke dip II I made from this site. Thanks!

I made this as side with Indian dish. I used kraft grated  Parmesan cheese instead and mixed all ingredients with few dashes of kosher salt and melted. I cut pita  as suggested but then sliced open and lay facing up on baking sheet. I then brushed mixture on each piece then placed into 375 oven until crispy (15 min). It was so good I had to make a second batch for the family.

Loved these! I used a butter flavored spray to make them a bit healthier. Served with a side of hummus for a healthy snack. I always have leftover pita around the house, so I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These tasted great!! I substituted olive oil for butter. I will use less of it next time as some pieces were thoroughly soaked with too much olive oil. That may have been user error on my part (; I also didn't open the pita bread for some pieces. I found I enjoyed them more than the ones I left open..Thank you!

The only thing I did differently was to mix everything together and with a pastry brush, spread it over whole pitas and then cut up with kitchen shears.  Way way easier and faster.  Very good.

Quick tip: I, often, make these as part of an antipasto platter. I use a pizza wheel to easily slice the pitas. It makes for quick work. Also, broiling in the oven makes them crisp as long as they aren't oversaturated with butter/oil.

I didn't have Italian seasoning. Instead I used liquid smoke, French fry seasoning and chunky Verde enchilada sauce to season the butter. Also I used whipped butter. I first cooked the garlic in a little butter and then mixed it in the other butter and ingredients and microwaved in a butter bowl. I also used fresh garlic finely chopped and a lot more than suggested here. The timing was perfect with 10 minutes. After all was done, I typed it off with finely chopped tomatoes and scallions. Yum!!

Very good and easy! I served them with Broccoli Cheese Soup tonight.  They were gone very quickly. I followed the recipe except that I had shaved parmesan on hand and used that and I was very generous with everything else. ;)

Awesome flavor. I baked for ten minutes and it was perfect and made the house smell wonderful. I'm excited to find a recipe like this with better flavor than pre-baked pita chips, but also much cheaper too! It's a win win :o) The only thing I would suggest is double the ingrediants since I didn't have nearly enough sauce to drizzle on the pitas (Maybe half butter and half olive oil) I will probably make this using olive oil spray and garlic salt sometimes to save calories. I'm serving it tonight with spaghetti but I can't wait to try these with hummus and other dips too!

Incredible! I had the pitas in the fridge for days waiting to be made into these. I followed the instructions exactly except baked a little longer as my bread was kinda thick in places. They are delicious!

Just assume you"ll need more than you think. These are so good and go fast. I made them exactly as the recipe said and they are delicious as a snack or with a meal. Be sure not to let them get darker than they are in the picture - like I did with my first batch!

Very tasty, I made a few changes--omitted the Parmesan and used spray butter.  Very versatile recipe, next time I'm going to try using Greek seasonings instead of the Italian herbs for a different flavor!

These make store-bought cardboard-textured pita pockets actually palatable, and I did't even have to go to the trouble of kneading and baking my own pita!  I served these with hummus at a recent family gathering and was complemented on them.  Thank you for this recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing.

Very easy to make. However I read the recipe wrong and used dry Italian Dressing seasoning (a whole packet).  I served with a grilled chicken salad and my family loved them.  In fact, they were gone in minutes.  I am going to make another batch to determine which I like better, but a totally easy and awesome recipe to make.

Love these!  The only change I made was to add garlic salt.  My family loved them!  I served with pasta instead of bread sticks or garlic toast.  A nice alternative!

These turned out really good on the second batch.  10 minutes isn't enough and 15 minutes is way too long. Tasty!

I modify this recipe when I make these. They need to be cooked longer and I usually need more butter to completely cover all the pita bread. With those changes, though, they're a huge hit. I like to serve them with a feta spread.

A great, quick and easy appetiser. I did use a little more butter than suggested in order to cover all of the pita bread. They only took about 8 minutes in my oven. I served with Fresh Herb Dip from this site and it made a great start to our dinner. Many Thanks.

I make these Garlic Pita Bread Bites to go with the Veggie Delight on Garlic Bread recipe. I made the two together for a dinner party. Everyone loved them! Nice and crunchy and plenty of flavor!
