Carrots are my favorite vegetable and this soup is delicious. I've made it twice in two weeks. I usually always follow a "new-to-me" recipe exactly as written the first time, then tweak to my liking if necessary. But, this time, I thought I knew better and added freshly grated ginger because I also love ginger. It was very good, but the fresh ginger overpowered the carrot flavor. And, afterall, this IS carrot soup. The second time I made it, I used powdered ginger as the recipe called for. Still delicious, and the the carrot flavor was much more pronounced. I will make this again and again following the recipe to the letter, but I think I will roast some (bite sized) carrots in the oven to add at the last minute. My DH needs something to chew. A wonderfully satisfying comfort soup. I LOVE this stuff!

How Fantastic this is! The ginger and curry is an unexpected and delicious hit of flavour in what I imagined was going to be a basic soup.  Even the kids liked it - and you know what high praise that is!!

Easy and delicious. I love this soup. I did use vegetable broth in place of chicken and also added some garlic. Used my immersion blender and dinner was on the table in less than an hour. Perfect for hectic nights. Served with a salad, and felt like I was doing my body many favors.

Great tasting simple soup
I am not a fan of carrot soup but I had a delicious one at a restaurant and wanted to recreate the same thing at home.  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I ajusted a few things: being lactose intolerante I ommited the cream and just put more broth; also added 2 gloves of garlic and used 1/2 sweet potato instead of regular potato. This recipe is a keeper, everyone one loved it!

I doubled the recipe other than the spices, (not a big fan of ginger and my 17 yr old hates curry.) I added garlic and 1/4 t. of nutmeg. Trying to save on calories, I used olive oil instead of butter and I also used nonfat milk rather than the cream. It was delicious; my boys had two big bowls each. I love the sweet carrots with the curry and hint of ginger. Will definitely make again with my changes.

This was so good! The perfect carrot soup if you ask me. I must add that I modified slightly using Land o Lakes light butter and 2% milk since that's what I had. It was so perfect even with this reduction in fat; silky smooth, mildly sweet, with a hint of spice.  The curry isn't a strong presence here, which was fine by me...........but if you really like to taste the curry you may want to add more.

This is a favorite of mine!  I almost never follow a recipe exactly, but the spices are just perfect and the ginger gives it a wonderful twist!  I enjoy making in extra large batches on the stove top (instead of dutch oven).  It freezes well, is inexpensive, healthy, and it is often what a bring friends in need of a home cooked meal.  I always get complements!

This was amazing but I changed the recipe slightly - instead of removing veggies to place in food processor after cooking for 30 mins I grated the carrots and chopping all veggies in the processor prior to cooking. So at 30 mins everything was already blended well and at that point I just added 1/2 cup cream cheese and 1/2 cup milk to substitute the heavy cream with 1/3 cup of curry paste and stirred on low for 10-15 more mins. I also left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand - but feel like it didn't need it. Yum!!

This was super easy to make and made for a nice dinner on Meatless Monday served with fresh rolls.  But it wasn't a standout and I probably won't make it again.  Taste is extremely subtle. In fact it took several mouthfuls to even detect a taste at all.  I suppose experimenting with the spices might improve the flavor but with so many great soup recipes on this site, I'll probably just file this under not repeatable. Inexpensive and easy though so if you like mildly flavored, try this.

I've never rated a recipe before but felt I had to with this soup.  It is delicious.  I've made it twice now and both times my picky four year old gobbled it up!  Yeah hidden vegetables!  It would also be just as tasty without the hint of curry flavor.  I used 1% milk with a dash of half and half and I think I prefer it like that, without the super creaminess of the heavy cream.  But, also, if I didn't eat dairy this would be such a great recipe, too because the soup was YUMMY before the milk.  All around an outstanding recipe.

Delicious! I will make this again!  I didn't have access to cream so I substituted 3/4 cup of milk with 1/3 cup of butter.  Based on other reviews I also doubled the recipe.

My husband can't handle too much spice so I halved the curry.

Excellent- but then, carrots are one of my favorite vegetables. Only substitution, I used EVOO rather than butter, and skipped the curry. Definitely a 'keeper'!

This soup was delicious, and so easy and quick. My 2 year old ate it right up. The only thing I changed; I increased the the chicken broth by about a cup because I box of I chicken broth held 4 cups and I just wanted to use it up. I used an immersion blender and it was even faster. Definitely a keeper.

Good and super easy!!!  I followed exactly except for increasing carrots to 3 cups.  It ended up being extremely thick so I had to thin it out a little using more chicken broth.  Next time I won't make any changes.  I loved the taste of the soup before adding the curry powder and did like it with the curry powder.  Next time I think we will eat it the first time without the curry and add the curry the next day for a different taste.

I have made this 4,5 times already and my entire family loves it. The only thing I altered was less curry. It was very over powering. However, I know there are different types and I think mine was very strog. So , I only use a pinch. Otherwise, awesome! ;)

Absolutely delicious.  No tweaks needed.  I suggest doubling the recipe, because as it stands this is a one meal serving with no leftovers.

It is a good recipe! I did make it with plant based substitutions such as almond milk for the whipping cream and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I omitted the butter. Other than that I made it according to how it was written. The only thing I will change in the future is use half of the ginger. It was a little much for my taste. It freezes well. I make soups and freeze them in individual servings to pull for my work lunches or to have something quick to eat on hand.

With carrots straight from our garden & our special "Ghost Curry" spice from the Savory Spice Shop in Encinitas, this was a 5 star for us!!
Didn't make any changes to the original recipe our first batch, but forgot to add the heavy whipping cream to our 2nd & it was STILL great!  With the new year upon us, will probably continue to make it w/o the cream to cut down on added calories.  This is another allrecipes.com recipe that will become one of our family's homemade classics.

Delicious-  to make it healthier, I substituted 1/4 C Cream cheese with chives and onion for the heavy whipping cream.

I love this soup, and am actually making it right now! The recipe is easy, not time consuming, and very good. I add a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to my recipe (it just seemed right), and the flavor is even more lovely. I will always be making this in the future ??

Delicious!  The only adjustment I make is using milk since I usually don't have cream around - and it still comes out great.  As others have said, double the recipe!  Doubled and served with bread and salad makes a just right dinner for our family of 5 (3 tween/teen boys even;)

Yummo! What a great blend of flavors! I had leftover steamed baby carrots and roasted potatoes so I used those. It was thick but used some extra stock to thin as noted. As well, I only had skim milk so I added a Tbsp of butter at the end. Oh, and I sautéed the onion in olive oil first for a minute or two. But in all this recipe was really great! My husband, who doesn't like steamed carrots, tried this reluctantly and loved it. Even wants me to make it for Thanksgiving! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so easy to make and it turned out just amazing! Yum! I did make changes, however, based on convenience and judgement. I doubled the recipe and added an extra cup of sliced carrots (total of six) as I knew I wanted extra for later. I omitted the celery as I didn't have it on hand, and I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I didn't want the ginger to be overpowering, so I added a 2 inch chunk of fresh ginger to the pot and removed it later. As well, curry is not my thing, so I added a pinch of cinnamon instead. It really added the perfect kick of flavour. Lastly, I used half and half instead of heavy cream and free poured based on consistency of the soup. It sounds like I changed almost everything, but the beauty of a soup like this is that you can make these changes and it will still come out wonderful!!

This was delicious, but the portioning information was misleading. I was cooking for two, so halfed the recipe from 8 to 4 servings, expecting leftovers. The halved recipe made exactly two regular-sized bowls of soup. I'm so glad I didn't quarter the recipe! Next time I'll make the full batch and expect 4 servings...

I love this soup! The first night I ate it, I literally licked my bowl. :) I added a touch of cinnamon and used a teaspoon of medium hot curry paste. I also used the minced ginger in a jar (only 1/2 teaspoon). I was afraid of too much fresh ginger based on a previous review. Next time, I'll probably add a bit more. I also used plain soy milk for the "cream" and it was fine. This is a great soul warming soup! The next time I make it, I might add some orange zest and oj in place of the curry.

This was delicious and a good break in of my new food processor. I made a double recipe and mostly stuck to it with a few revisions that made it better IMO. I added a bit more curry and salt and also added some spicy chili powder to give it even more heat. Also added more ginger and added only half of the whipping cream as I used a cup of coconut milk. Turned out great!

This is absolutely perfect! I rarely review recipes but this was so delicious I couldn’t resist. I love carrots and had some in the fridge I needed to use up-little did I know that I was making what was to become my favorite soup. The only thing I changed was that I left out the curry as I didn’t have any on hand. In my opinion it was perfect without it.

love this soup!  I did roast the veggies instead of boiling because I like the way it brings out the flavor in the veggies.  I used coconut milk instead of cream for a dairy free soup and it tasted great.  even my son that hates carrots liked it.  I told him the orange color was from curry powder and he ate it!  sneaky mom...

This recipe is so fast and easy for such a distinguished soup. I use curry paste instead of powder and I increased the amount of ginger but I make it and share it a couple times a year. I'm always asked for the recipe! Simple ingredients for stay at home days. Add fresh buns and it's simply comfort food!

The soup tastes great.  I finely chopped fresh ginger and used Madras curry paste because that is what I had.  Great flavour.

I made this for the first time tonight. Did not have curry powder or whipping cream so used 1:1 coriander and cumin to total the needed curry, and used sour cream with a touch of milk to make it a little more cream like in place of the whipping cream. I had adjusted the recipe for 9 servings (we are 3 adults I thought it might make 2 meals that way), and we had nothing left, it made a little more than a bowl per person. It was delicious! We will definitely be doing this one again.

Yuuuuuummmyyy it was above my expectations.  Very tasty and restaurant quality but better because it was home made. I may make this soup for Thanksgiving. I followed the directions precisely and I normally don’t do that. The ingredients are simple and few. I will be making this again and again.

Soooo delicious! I made the recipe exactly as described but omitted the cream at the end - it’s not necessary and saves on calories :) You won’t even notice that the cream is missing as it is the perfect thickness (I like a nice, hearty, thick soup). A keeper for sure!

I tried this recipe when I had oral surgery and couldn’t eat solids. It was scrumptious! 
I made some changes since I first made it. I only added half of the amount of curry and used 5 carrots (I didn’t measure it in cups).
My husband and I love it! We like to buy sourdough bread to go with it. It’s delicious!  I will definitely be making this over and over!

I decided on this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand and needed to use them up.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this soup is.  My teenagers even liked it.  I was worried the curry and ginger flavors would be overpowering; they were not.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is simply DELICIOUS and I highly recommend it. 
I doubled the recipe but only used 1 1/2 cups of onion, I didn't have celery so didn't use it, as well as the heavy cream, I used 1 cup of low fat milk instead. Still this soup came out great.  Family loved it so definitely keeping it!

Really good soup, the potato adds a nice flavor.  I did add extra ginger and a couple teaspoons of cayenne pepper to add a bit of a kick.

Fresh ginger would be best to use if you have it.

Awesome Carrot soup!!  I did not put the potato in the  recipe, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I have tried other carrot soup recipes and this is my fav by far.

Excellent. Really enjoyed this  and will make it again. Only tweaks I made were to add about 1/4 of a fresh jalapeno  (diced) and  about 1 tsp of chopped garlic to the mix. Flavor was great.

Amazing!! I was given a large grocery bag of carrot (several pounds) and I made about 6 quarts of this recipie. I made it in my instapot by putting all the ingredients in at once and when it was done I added the cream, ginger, curry, salt and pepper to taste. This is my new favorite soup - and I can’t believe it carrots! And healthy!

Very good.  Didn't have any celery.  Was out of chicken broth and just used water.  Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Added one clove of garlic, minced.  Used freshly grated nutmeg instead of the ginger.  Added a teaspoon of sugar and about 2 teaspoons of dried parsley flakes.  Used an immersion blender.  Will make again for sure.  It was very tasty and I didn't miss the celery or chicken broth, although I will include them next time.

Today was my first time making it and it is by far the best soup I have ever made. It has so much flavor and it is not boring, I will definitely be making it again. I discarded the heavy cream, It creamy enough without it.

This soup is amazing! I didn't have heavy cream and used half and half and it is still creamy and delicious, so go ahead and lighten it up and enjoy!

Omg i had too many carrots to eat so i made this soup. didn't have celery, so i left it out and i used ginger out of a jar. I sauteed the veggies a bit then dumped water and veggie broth powder in... rest as per instructions.... it is sooo good... my kids love it. Thank you this is a keeper.

I was going to make it just as it, but then ended up changing a few things (not much!).  I used a combination of butter/oil and a teaspoon of coconut oil (to add a subtle coconut flavor) and  sauteed the veggies a bit before adding the broth.  The only other change I made was to add a sweet potato that was aging in my vegetable bin, and used half and half and milk instead of heavy cream (because that's what I had on hand)!  Also, to keep it simple, I used the immersion blender instead of the blender.  Tastes great!

This was really nice. Super easy to make and a nice way to use up the gigantic crop of carrots that I had. Next time I will up the spices as I doubled the recipe except for the ginger and curry as they are not my favourites. End flavour was good but quite mild so I won't play around with the recipe in the future.

OMG.  S-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o good.  I used my own dried celery leaves instead of a stalk.  Added one cubed sweet potato, rather than use white potato.  Ayurvedic herbs and spices.  My new favorite soup recipe.

Simple, quick and super tasty. Works equally well with cayenne pepper and/or smoked paprika instead of curry powder. Dress with chives or fresh coriander/parsley. Awesome.

This soup is really good and fast.  It took about 30 min.  I put all the vegetables in my processer first so I didn't have to take time cutting by hand.  I added a crushed clove of garlic.  Puréed it all at the end before the cream went in.  Delicious!

I had 5 lbs. of organic carrots to use, and although I more than doubled the recipe, I still have carrots to use. Anyway the soup is so good. I am sharing it with my daughter and son in law and sis in law. I followed them recipe with one exception. I had 1/2  and 1/2 so I used that. I would recommend to anyone. It is a keeper for sure

This was easy and a huge hit at the soup-er bowl luncheon at work. I put in a whole onion on accident and then took most of it out after simmering / before blending. It still turned out great.

I used an immersion blender to give the veggies a nice creamy texture and I added about a teaspoon of cayanne pepper for a nice kick. I think it would have been fairly bland otherwise. Yummy!

I had an abundance of Carrots, so decided to make this Carrot Soup. Due to what I had on hand, I replaced the potato with a large Sweet Potato and 2% Milk & 2 Tbl of Kefir Cheese for the cream (with a dollop at serving), 3 Chicken Bullion Cubes & Water for the broth, and about 1 Tbl of fresh Ginger.
Will definitely make again and keep the Sweet Potato & Kefir substitutions.

I made this and tasted it before adding the heavy whipping cream. It was so good I decided not to add it! I also left it a little chunky and not completely pureed. It was very simple and I will definitely make it again.

Once upon a time, I went to a little hole in the wall pub in the middle of nowhere and had cream of carrot soup for the first time ever. I LOVED it!
Then I went home and craved it all the  time.
Until one day I found this recipe, and cautiously made it, hoping that it would be half as good as the soup I had in that wee little pub. 
Worries be gone! This IS that soup! SO Bloody Good! I Love it.

Wonderful soup that warms a winter's day.  As a gardener , I have lots of carrots so I double or triple the cooked ingredients and then process with the blender.  I freeze this base in 6 cup increments which is equal to one recipe. Add the curry and cream after thawing the base and reheat at medium low.

Made this twice in 2 weeks now! So easy, and easy to modify for Vegan or Dairy-Free. I added parmesan croutons and added a bit of garlic powder. It's a soup that hasn't had any haters or leftovers!

I made this tonight with 4 cups of homemade chicken stock.  It is delicious.  I added about 1/2 cup of fat free cream cheese and half cup of  fat free milk.  It is very creamy and the whipping cream is not missed! I will make this again!

I made a vegan version using coconut milk instead of cream, veggie broth in place of chicken broth, and olive oil in place of butter, and it was absolutely delicious!

This was fantastic!  The flavors and aroma were out of this world!  As I did not have celery or potato on hand, I substituted shredded zucchini.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a super simple carrot soup recipe. I followed it with one exception.  I substituted half and half cream for the heavy cream.  I was able to use my hand blender instead of pulling out the table blender. My company loved it and so did we.

I had to change it significantly, but it was fantastic. I made it as written (with half and half instead of heavy cream bc the supermarket was out of it), and realized I needed more (would feed about 5 people as is). I tasted it, and the curry was overpowering (and I like curry - it just overwhelmed all other flavors), so I made another batch, but included 2 chopped apples as well, and garlic (4 cloves worth). As I mentioned, I used half and half, but when I doubled the recipe, I didn't add any more cream, and didn't add any more curry...and it was AMAZING. Definitely the best carrot soup I've ever had. My boyfriend was amazed. I told him there was likely no way I could replicate it, so enjoy it today! I didn't measure the ingredients much in the 2nd batch. Really fantastic soup. Hope I can make it again!

While I generally don't like carrots I once had a wonderful carrot soup several years ago at a fine restaurant, and it made me want to explore.  This recipe was AWESOME.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting the curry in half.  I typically don't enjoy the taste of curry.  That said, this soup was marvelous.  Thanks to the chef who authored it.

My version of this soup was delicious.  The ginger and curry make it so tasty.  I used a potato masher instead of  blending the soup.  I also used low fat sour cream in place of the heavy cream and added small pre-cooked meatballs .

This is definite hit with my little ones.  My adaptations are to add half a can of tomato paste and leave out the whipping cream.  I add cold whole milk to the children's' bowls to help cool the soup  down and to add a little creaminess for them.  My partner and I prefer it without any whipping cream or milk.

Wow. this recipe is fabulous. I needed a quick nutritious vegetarian meal with the bits and bobs around my kitchen and I came across this recipe. I don't usually like carrot soup but this had the right amount of spice and awesomeness to make me a fan. I served it with garlic naan bread.

This is such an easy recipe and actually makes a large pot.  I added another cup of carrots and also increased the cream to 1 cup.  Also kept back a few carrots from the pureed and put them in at the end.   Very Delicious!!!

I didn't add the ginger because I wasn't feeling it at the moment, and this soup was great. I had some last night without cream and it was great and then added the cream tonight and it was so good. It tasted like cheddar soup, so I added some broccoli.  The curry was not overwhelming at all, it just added something nice. I love curry and it usually blasts the taste buds, but not in this soup.  Nice work.

Great recipe! I was generous with quantity of carrots, celery and onion and added enough liquid to cover rather than going strictly by the recipe. I made it vegan by eliminating butter and simmering the veggies in stock made with about 3 tbs nutritional yeast. For cream I used raw cashews puréed in food processor with equal amount of almond milk (i.e. 1/2 C cashews to 1/2 C almond milk yields about 1 C heavy non-dairy cream). Also added generous pinch of allspice along with curry. Served topped with homemade onion-garlic croutons.

This is an excellent recipe that I have made several times.  The only change I made this past time was substituting whipping cream for heavy cream (b/c that was all I had) and it turned out fine.  The only mistake I make was not doubling the recipe b/c it is so delicious and even tastes as good cold.

This is a pretty tasty little soup. Personally, I need some kind of texture to my soups so next time I'll set some cooked carrots, onion and celery to the side and leave them a little more chunky so I can add them. I also use fat-free half and half instead of the milk. Garnish with parsley or a little cilantro.

Good base recipe but definitely needs more curry, salt and pepper; I cut calories by using FF half and half but that wouldn't have changed seasoning issue. DH did not like it at all but then he doesn't like curry or soup without meat so I'm not factoring in his review at all :) since this was just for me I put half in the freezer for later.

Made this exactly as written (well...halved it and kinda regretted it, no leftovers).  It was delicious.  I served it on a hot summer day with a hefty spinach salad.  My husband and I had small bowls and my soup loving but ginger disliking 9 year old had seconds to finish off the pot.  Will definitely make again.  Would be easy and reliable to make for company.

Honestly, I probably won't make this again. I guess we just aren't "cream of vegetable soup as a main dish" type people. I served it with a crusty sourdough loaf, which was the wrong bread choice. The tangy bread made the soup taste even sweeter than it was. It would be better with a mild bread, like a crusty warm french loaf. I also used a sweet potato in place of the regular white potato in an attempt to add more nutrients. I would suggest sticking with the white potato. The sweet potato made the soup almost too sweet for a main dish. The soup in general would be better as a side dish or starter course, but I likely won't invest this much work on a side dish. For a main dish, it was simple. Definitly needs the spices to keep it from being too one-note. Did have a nice silky and buttery texture. I had debated roasting the carrots to give them extra flavor, but was glad I didn't waste time... The extra step wasn't needed and there was plenty of carrot flavor. Used my own curry spice recipe based loosely on Alton Browns curry powder recipe. This way I can control the taste better (we arent big curry fans so I use more of the spices I like and leave a few out in our curry powder). 

Also my 1 year old ate a modest amount, but my 3 year old was not a fan. Hubby liked it, but said it probably wasn't a meal he'd request.

I really enjoyed this recipe and actually just finished making it for the second time. This time I doubled the recipe. My only adjustment was replacing the potato with sweet potato because I absolutely love them. My honey really loved it also. I was short on time and had it for breakfast the other day!

Loved the soup, tweaked it to our own likes by adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg, Tbls curry, 3cups carrots, 1/2tsp garlic powder. 
Thanks great with nice salad and hot crispy french bread.

I don't normally like carrots, but gave this a try. Was amazing garnished with a little shredded cheese.

This is a great soup!  I had no use for the extra 1/2 cup heavy cream (had to buy 8 oz.); so I just added it to the soup.  Made it extra creamy and rich. Served with a green salad and crusty French bread.  A new family favorite.

Really good, I didn't use the ginger, because I don't like it, and it still tastes great.

Delicious!  I followed the advice of others and doubled it as I wanted to have enough leftovers so that I could freeze some.  However I left out the celery becauseI didn't have any and I did not double the ginger because I am not a big fan of it.  The only other changes I made were: I added the curry right at the start with the stock, used puréed ginger in place of the ginger powder and used 18% table cream instead of heavy cream.  We enjoyed the soup with naan bread and it hit the spot on a rainy and cool fall day.  Thank you for sharing this one!

I am on Weight Watchers, so did a few substitutions:  swede instead of potato, 0% fat Greek yoghurt in place of cream! and this is now my new favourite 0 point soup!  I would make this for company, really lovely! Fantastic!

An absolute hit. I scaled up the quantity and took 24 quarts to an elementary school fundraiser soup day, and several kids and staff asked for the recipe. So yummy!

Tried this recipe tonight.  Absolutely delicious!!  The juxtaposition of the flavors with curry and ginger gave it an interesting flavor.  It was simple to make.  The cream is optional but adds richness to the soup.  A do-over!

this came out super good.. i'm a huge fan of blended soups.. used about 5 small white potatoes in place of the large.. 2 small stalks of celery.. halved the butter.. used plain yogurt instead of cream (lactose intolerant).. tripled the curry.. salt and peppered to taste as opposed to the exact amounts.. added a small boneless skinless chicken breast to make it more hearty.. ty for the recipe

this soup is fantastic!  i increased curry powder to 1 tbsp and used 1 cup 5 percent cream instead of 1/2 cup whipping cream.  Beautiful colour!  Definitely guest-worthy!  Bonus - it's very easy to make!

Made this for my picky kids and they ate it! (I personally really liked it). I have a hand blender which makes this such an easy soup to make. Used half and half cream (because that's all I had) and it still worked. The next day I didn't have enough to go around so I added a can of tomato soup to make it stretch...so good! Great recipe...it's going in my meal planning rotation.

YUM!!! I had a carrot/ginger/curry soup at a bistro a couple years ago that was fantastic. I have been trying to find the right recipie for it. This was it! I made this last night for dinner and even the picky hubs cleaned his bowl. This soup is delicious, not spicy, just enough of each seasoning to add great flavor! I did not have a dutch oven, so I used my largest non-stick stock pot and tried to keep the lid on tight. As the steam was leaking out, I just added about 1/2 cup more or so of stock (I used vegetable stock)to replace the evaporated liquid. I also added about 1/2-1 cup more of water after pureeing it to thin it out too. I will be making this again and again. I could eat this soup ALL DAY! Just perfect!
