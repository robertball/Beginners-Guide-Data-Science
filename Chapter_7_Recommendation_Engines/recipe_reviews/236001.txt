I made this recipe tonight for my husband and three young children (6 year old, 4 year old and 20 month old). They absolutely LOVED it!!! It was very tasty and very simple! The sauce is delicious! I didn't have sirloin steak or beef stock so I used turkey meatballs and chicken stock instead and it was still fabulous!! This is a going to be a keeper in our house and next time I will be sure to use the sirloin steak. Thanks so much for posting this husband and kid friendly meal. So quick to make as well. Oh and one more thing, I also didn't have regular onion. I used a red onion which added a sweetness to the sauce. YUMMMMMY!!!! Thanks again for adding a staple meal to our house!

This recipe is pretty good. It doesn't make much sauce though. I would suggest using at least 2 cups of beef stock so there is more sauce. I took the advice of another person and cooked my noodles in beef stock. It was really good. I will be adding mushrooms next time to the beef mixture. I used stew meat instead of sirloin. I made homemade mashed potatoes with it as a side.

I made this last night with some minor modifications. I seem unable to use a recipe without making at least one change. I doubled the recipe (I had 2.37 lbs. of sirloin) and added an extra cup of beef stock and half a cup of red wine. I cooked the onion with diced garlic, around 6 cloves worth. I make a batch of garlic every two weeks, at least two bulbs, diced in the food processor and stored in olive oil in a glass jar, so I can only guess at the amount. Instead of peas I used two 7 oz. cans of drained, sliced mushrooms. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon of thyme instead of pinches. This came out amazingly tasty. I highly recommend adding red wine to the beef stock. My boyfriend and I ate huge portions last night and it made a great lunch for me today, too. I will make this again.

I have tried a few recipes in the past for beef tips and noodles, all with not so great results.  This is by far the best one that I have made.  My husband, who always rolls his eyes when I "experiment" with dinner, actually loved this one and said that I could make it as often as I wanted too!!!

This was really good, I had some leftover peas and a sirloin steak in the refrig so I whipped this up for dinner.  I didn't have any beef stock so I subbed a beef bouillon cube and cup of water but it was still very good.  I used fresh thyme from the garden and I made homemade egg noodles from this site.  I will definitely make this meal again.  (After this simmered for an hour plus, there was very little liquid left, next time I make this I will add another cup.  A little red wine, garlic and mushrooms would be nice additions too.)

I only had ground beef so I browned that and left it in big chunks. I followed the rest of the recipe but did double the stock and I am glad as I actually would still have liked a little more gravy.  Hubby liked it, even though he hates peas.

I made this for dinner tonight, followed the receipt exactly.  This was amazing and so very simple.  The only thing I would do is make more!!  Thanks for posting I am newly retired and trying all kinds of new recipes for my husband & myself now that I have time to cook.  My 1 yr. old granddaughter is going to love the leftovers for lunch tomorrow when I babysit.

Before I browned the beef, used 1/4 cup flower, 1tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic. As suggested by others I added 2 cups beef stock as well as mushrooms. Will be on the menu rotation, yummy and easy!

Very yummy!  We're not fans of peas, so we skipped those, and I poured in about a half cup red wine & a little more corn starch.  I used a half lb. rib eye steak and 4 small portobello mushrooms, cut into cubes - fabulous!

I'm certain it would have been perfect as the recipe is written, but I added a couple of items just because I needed to use them before they went bad.  With the onion, I sauteed minced garlic, yellow & orange bell peppers and sliced mushrooms.  And because everyone in my family (but me) is big on gravy, I doubled the sauce part of the recipe, as well as the peas and incorporated red wine into the beef broth. Served over a nest of mashed potatoes.  YUM!!!!  This is a keeper!! Thanks for sharing this delicious and easy-to-make recipe!!!

This was great! I doubled the recipe, seared the cubes of meat, and put everything in the crockpot for a little more than an hour. We used macaroni instead of the flat egg noodles and when the noodles were cooked, mixed the beef and gravy with the noodles. Very good!

My husband has asked me to make beef and noodles for years, they were always an epic fail, never met my expectations.  I was so surprised at the end product of this recipe, delicious.  I have made this several times after the first time following the recipe, made a few changes to suit our taste!  Thank you for sharing this easy and flavorful recipe.

Great flavor. I used a sirloin steak cut into meaty pieces. After browning the meat and onions I put it all in the crockpot for 3-4 hours on low. Tender and delicious.

Good comfort food.  I used left over roast beef which was already cooked, so it was an even quicker dish!  I would add a little sour cream next time.

This is excellent.  I used veggie broth only because I didn't realize I was out of beef stock. After it simmered for an hour, the sauce had cooked down quite a bit, so I added 1/2 C more  veggie broth when I added the cornstarch.  I served it with no peas to my super picky eater and she inhaled it.  The rest of us devoured it with peas.  Next time I make it, I will increase all the ingredients by 1.5 since I am feeding teenagers, but I will double the broth. Oh, and I thought I was going to have to pick out the onions for my super picky eater too, so I cut them in pretty decent size slices, but they were completely cooked into the sauce and she never knew the difference.

This was excellent! I added 2 cups water and used 2 teaspoons Wyler's beef powder since I didn't have beef broth on hand. If I had only used 1 cup as directed, it wouldn't have had any gravy. Still....5 stars!!! Yum!!!!

I took some advice from previous comments and I doubled the sauce, next time I'm going to triple it the noodles drink it up!

This has great flavor, I used canned peas since I didn't have frozen it was alright but frozen would have been a little better.

I would recommend this one, it's pretty easy and it tastes great!!

I've loved it! I've changed some things :) i didn't have onion so I put onion powder and freshly minced garlic. I didn't have corn starch but used tortilla corn mix which is basically the same. I didn't add the peas but added gravy to the meat n had prime steak for my beef n noodles ontop of my creamy mash potatoes

This was easy to make and we all liked it.  My husband had two helpings! I also used two cups of the beef stock which made for a nice amount of sauce, and I added mushrooms with the onions too!  This will become a regular in my meal planning.

YUM!! My family absolutely loved this! Very simply to make comfort food. The only thing I did differently was double the beef stock; other reviewers stated it wasn't enough sauce. I cooked for approx. 1.5 hours and the meat was very tender and there was a perfect amount of sauce. Thank you SO much for a fantastic recipe, will definitely make again

Hearty and great, especially for fall/winter.  I personally like when bay leaf flavor is more subtle in recipes, so I liked it better with one that two bay leaves.  You could add peas or green beans, but I though green beans went much better with this because of their subtle flavor.   I doubled everything except for the meat and peas/green beans.  I subbed beef broth because I didn't have stock, and it was fine.  I subbed a dry red wine for a third of the beef stock and loved it.  I also used about a half a tablespooon more of corn starch because of the other reviewers suggesting it, and I'm glad I did.

It is pretty good. My toddler really liked it. One thing was I might have cooked it a tad too long so it was a little dry but I will do this one again. :-)

I added mushrooms when sautéing the onions.  Served over quinoa to add some nutrition.  Great flavor that wasn't overwhelming.

Made it exactly as was written and it was sooooo yummy and the meat was very tender! Cooked it for about 90 minutes. Oh, I did add some garlic when I sauteed the onions. It was delicious! I agree with whomever said there wasn't enough sauce. Next time I will add more beef base and water.

We used rice instead of noodles and yellow bell pepper instead of onion. I had to use green beans, no peas. This was the perfect recipe I was looking for. It's a keeper!

I would make this again if I was needing to make Beef & Noodles.  My wife's /  Grandmothers receipt is much better.

I did add garlic, mushrooms and molasses to the receipt and it was very good.  I added the frozen peas near the very end and let it simmer just long enough to get them up to temperature with everything else.  I don't care for mushy peas.

I love simple recipes with great flavor. This came together fast and I could do other things while the meat was 'tenderizing'. I did add some mushrooms and garlic, but other than that  I stuck to the recipe.

This is my go to recipe for beef tips and noodles which is my absolute favorite dish so it has to be right. I made a couple of personal tweeks because I have a big family and everyone eats a lot but this is the base recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

My husband has emphatically asked that I add this to the regular rotation! It was quick, simple, and so so good. Instead of the cubed sirloin, I used a thin-cut top round that I had in the freezer; it wasn't as tender as it probably would have been otherwise, so I think I'll go with the thick cut next time. But for someone as short on time and money as I am, this was a great easy dinner!

I made this and added garlic, celery, green pepper, and carrots. I used angus beef chuck - 50 minutes cooking was adequate.  Excellent taste, and super easy.

My husband and I really liked this recipe!  It was something we were able to make with ingredients we had on hand.  Since my family likes things on the saucier side, I listened to other reviews and doubled the beef stock/ cornstarch. It was great!!  The only other change I would make would be to double the amount of beef as my husband was digging through the noodles and stealing the pieces of beef!!

LOVED this!  I used 2 cups of beef broth instead of water as several commenters suggested.  Also used stew meat instead of sirloin and cooked in a heavy, covered Dutch oven at 250 all afternoon - 5 hours or so.  I added the noodles dry and cooked for about 30 more minutes, then stirred in the frozen peas and let it go for 10 more minutes or so.  Everything else was per the recipe.  It was so easy and delicious!  Will be in serious trouble with the hubby if I don’t make it again!  T

This was absolutely delish! I added mushrooms, I sautéed them in a separate pan with butter the same time I was cooking the onion. After cooking, I added the mushrooms with the steak back in pan before the bring to boil step. I doubled  the liquid one cup beef broth one cup beef stock.

I've made this many times but finally made an Allrecipes account so I could tell everyone how much I love it!! My wife and I dont like peas so I always leave those out and usually add a 1/2 cup to 3/4 more beef stock before letting it simmer so that the beef is a little less dry. Also I use arrowroot as opposed to corn starch since it takes a lot less for a nice thick texture.  Overall this is a nice easy recipe you can just let cook away while getting other stuff done. I always serve mine with a nice slice of bread and over mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe for my husband and he loved it. I didn't have any steak on hand so I used 85% Ground Beef. Also used 2 cups of Beef Stock and 1 cup of Sweet Marsala wine. 1 /2 large sweet onion and 1/2 of a container of Baby Bella mushrooms. When browning  the beef I sprinkled about 1 tbs of flour over it which later helped thicken the stock and wine sauce. Also used the Bay Leaf but only used about 1/2 the Thyme. Put GB mixture over some fresh  Fettuccini... Came out absolutely Fantastic! My husband ate two helpings for dinner. Asked if I'd make it again  next week. This recipe is definitely a keeper. It's good for Steak or Ground Beef.

Good basic recipe that is easy to adapt to your own preferences. I added mushrooms to mine. I also added 1/2 cup or so of red wine with the broth. We had dinner guests and everyone liked it.

We tend to make beef stroganoff without the sour cream because of allergies. Wanted to try something new and we were not disappointed. I cooked the steak pieces in a bit of crushed garlic and paprika but other than that I stuck to the script. Very good, added to the favorites!

I made this today. It was tasty. I put it in the pressure cooker. I added more liquid but I think I over did it. had to simmer it down before adding the noodles. As the recipe stands it would have been good. I did read the reviews and took a few suggestions. I added extra broth, garlic, and mushrooms. Had I done it on stove top the extra fluid would have been needed. flavor was very good. Will make again. Easy to make.

My hubby loves this. One precaution, don't add any extra salt without tasting it first. The beef stock should be enough.

Very bland tasting. I added some club house gravy mix. Then I added Maggi to it. The Maggi gave it more flavour. I will use this recipe again but major tweaks to it.

I doubled the recipe but made it exactly as it called for. The meat was very tender due to simmering it for almost 2 hours. Phenomenal recipe and would definitely recommend and make it again!

Oh wow~!  I made this yesterday for dinner, and the entire family loved it.  Even my picky little brother who hardly likes anything liked it.  This is definitely something I'll make again and again.  I served this dish with mashed potatoes from the garden and steamed carrots.
I think the only change I'll make to this recipe is doubling the sauce for next time.  We just love drizzling sauce over everything lol!

I made this, and it was delicious!  I didn't tweak it too much, I used a roast instead of steak, and I didn't add peas.  I used Ream's frozen egg noodles and cooked them in the broth from the roast, of course I had to add extra water and more beef broth but they turned out perfectly.  And then I served them over homemade skin-on mashed red skin potatoes!

I made this and we loved it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the beef turned out.  I had to leave out the peas because me husband is a picky eater and won't eat veggies in things.  Peas stand alone.  So does corn. It's weird. Anyway, this recipe was great and I will definitely make it again.  Soon!

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I used chuck fillet.  Definitely could use some more sauce though  I kept adding beef broth but still needed more.  We ate two portions, it was that good!!!!

...followed other suggestions- added mushrooms, 2 Xtra cups stock/red wine as well garlic. ... boiled noodles in beef broth- great for leftovers. Thank you, nice simple recipe.

wonderfully tasty and easy. I did add minced garlic and did not use the peas. ( really don't like peas all that much) but did add mushrooms . I threw it all in the slow cooker, then just had to do the noodles and it was so tender, grandma ate it without her teeth!

On the advice of a friend I used Reams home style frozen noodles mixed in with double the gravy. It was good. The kids didn't go for seconds but mthey husband and I did.

This is one of our favorites. I do find that we want more liquid/sauce so I just add plenty of the beef stock, comes out great and with plenty for everyone.

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled the beef stock and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with equal part water to make it extra creamy like gravy.  I also tripled the bay leaves and thyme, as a personal preference.  We really enjoyed this and I will make this recipe again.

OK, added a can of broth pinch more corn starch.  I will try this meat part again, no noodles potatoes I think better with the broth sauce.  For me thick slices  of onion add more to the dish peas I love but they didn't link the dish for me.  The meat wanted to go stew, all I could think was I needed to peel some carrots.
The meat sauce is a keeper  for fast and easy thanks

My son literally licked his plate and my husband got seconds and said it was one of the best dishes I have ever made. That is the best compliment he has EVER given me on food. I doubled the gravy recipe, but used the original amount of salt and soy sauce. It was perfect.

Very good, basic beef tips recipe. I substituted a 4 oz. can of mushrooms for the peas and found one bay leaf to be plenty. This is my go-to recipe when we're in the mood for comfort food!

It's a good recipe and my husband said it was a keeper. I increased the  stock to two cups but forgot to increase the corn starch so it wasn't as thick as I would want it. I will remember that for the next time. I will also make a rue with the cornstarch and butter. I had the leftovers the next day and they were very tasty.

It turned out better than I thought it would. It was very tender, it should have been since it simmered so long. I served over rice & we ended up eating it all!!
Very good!

This is really good. Used 2 cans of beef broth (low sodium) so increased the corn starch to 2 Tbl. Otherwise followed the recipe and It was great!!
Made this again and this time instead of removing the beef after searing I added 2 TBLSP of flour, thyme, paprika, and let cook for a minute then added broth and some shredded carrots and let simmer for about 30 mins.

My husband who seldom says much-loved it and that's the final answer. This was an excellent basic reference recipe and I made it with the same basic ingredients, except all I had were beef tips so I cooked them in the crockpot the day before  to make them fork tender.  Also,  I felt it needed more beef broth for gravy so I had beef concentrate in my freezer that I made from scratch and added that with more water (you could use 1-2 tsp. of beef bouillon) and thickened it with flour(browned in the skillet to take away the raw flour taste)and then added water to make the paste instead of corn starch.  I feel like corn starch is too gelatinous  in leftovers if I was fortunate to have any.  That said, it was a great comfort food meal served with crusty bread and real butter.

KEEPER and so easy!  The flavor was absolutely delicious, and the meal was enjoyed by my hardest to please picky eater, husband!  
I used a petite sirloin steak which weighed .68 lbs.  
I only altered the recipe by using veggie broth instead of the beef stock.  Also, I added a small clove of garlic.  I used all the measurements as directed to simmer meat with since others suggested doubling the sauce if using the full recipe.  I simmered my meat for only 30 minutes on low heat/covered.          
Because I was only feeding 2 of us, I only made 2 cups of egg noodles.
