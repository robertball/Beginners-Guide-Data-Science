I am the submitter of this recipe.  The amount of tofu is one package/box of tofu.  I use a box of Mori-nu Tofu which is 12.3 oz.  And I use half of romaine lettuce "heart," not the whole romaine lettuce itself.  You can definitely use any lettuce you like, but still, I think 1/2 head of it will be too much for one serving, especially to make a rice bowl.  I also noticed that you can't see the footnotes when you use your mobile app.  I don't recommend to substitute the Korean chili powder with any other chili powders.  It will be too spicy and alter the taste drastically.  But if you must, make sure to add small amount at a time and taste it. Hope you enjoy!

This is so simple and delicious.  The topping makes the dish.  I roasted the sesame seeds and used sesame seed oil to char extra firm tofu.  I also added fresh sliced mango with the cucumbers!

Perfect for those days when it's too hot to cook but not  too hot for spicy. I addd some rice vinegar to the dressing and added carrots and garbanzo beans.

Delicious!  minor changes... I did not have romaine but had cabbage so I chopped it and mixed with the cucumbers.  It added a great crunch and worked well with other textures.  I also seared the tofu in sesame oil and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.  Wonderfully light - great summer meal.

Excellent. If you can tolerate super hot food, use fresh thai green chilies 4-6 instead of the korean red pepper

I really, really liked this recipe. The sesame mixture is not only authentic, but makes this dish!  I used exactly the ingredients listed. Most can be found at large grocery store chains or you can buy online.  I have made this several times and have substituted brown sugar or honey for the white sugar with each substitute giving it a bit different flavor. I also used spinach and spring mix salad combo once with friends and they all loved it. If you want a crispy fried tofu, you can use firm/extra firm tofu drained very well and pat it very dry and fry in a nonstick pan till brown and crisp--about 3-5 minutes a side. You can't go wrong with it as written either so enjoy!

This recipe is fabulous!  It is very easy to make.  I don't make any changes to the sauce except I add the chili pepper powder a little at a time so it's not so spicy.  When  you eat a little bit of everything (vegetables, tofu, sauce and rice) all at once it is so incredibly delicious !  I'm hooked!  I make this all the time for my husband and myself.
