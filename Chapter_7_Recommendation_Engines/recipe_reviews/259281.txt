I've made these muffins twice so far, both times using agave nectar instead of maple syrup and adding a 1/2 tsp of allspice. Highly recommend the allspice. 
The second time I made the recipe, I added more spinach and they were tasty but a bit too wet, even though I extracted as much water as I did the first time. Next time, I'll probably only loosely pack a cup's worth of spinach. 
I'll also cook these 25-30 mins. Finally, they remain pretty dense so you can get away with filling the cups more than 2/3 of the way.
My 15 mo. old twins couldn't get enough of these and I liked them as well.

Pretty good! I used broccoli instead of spinach and added some semi sweet chocolate chips and the kids loved them! Next time though Iâ€™ll do it without the chips ;)
