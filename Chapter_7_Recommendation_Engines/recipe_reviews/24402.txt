Tasty, but the dough for the noodles needs less water. Start with half as much and work your way up from there.

This is a variation of my german great grandmother's soup.  While tasty, I still prefer the family version I grew up with. Instead of bacon (and the grease) we use real butter to taste and we also add celery to the soup.  The spaetzle or dumpling dough we make just calls for egg and flour.  I didn't add the water the recipe called for as other reviewers had mentioned problems with the dough being too runny.  Thank you for sharing, I enjoyed trying this recipe

My Grandmother use to make this...love this recipe, My Grandmother never drained all the water off of the potatoes...and I didn't either. gives it added flavor.  I made this for a gathering and my family and friends couldn't get over how good this is...AWESOME comfort food

Easy recipe.  You may have to add extra flour to get the right dough consistency, but great taste and easy to do.  Even better the next day.

This is as good as it gets :-) I skipped the noodle making and used egg noodles
