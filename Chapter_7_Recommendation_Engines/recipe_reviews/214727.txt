I had high hopes for this recipe and really, really wanted to like it, but for the life of me, I can't get this to turn out.  I've tried several times, each with an oversized 2c. ceramic coffee mug.  It always looks great from the outside, but it keeps burning on the inside.  I've reduced the cook time to 2 minutes with little success.  The inside just wants to change colors to an unappetizing burnt brown and is very chewy.  Flavor wise, the cake is great, especially when topped with lemon glaze.

This was a fun experiment but not one I'll repeat. While not exactly inedible, there was just something offputting about the texture and taste. I added a lemon glaze to top it off which definitely helped.

The texture is a bit wierd but it might be because I used Splenda, Egg Beaters and fat free buttermilk.  The taste is right on for a lemon cake.  I thought I had poppyseeds but alas, I didn't and already had the rest made.  So cooked in my microwave for exactly 2 1/2 minutes, worked perfect.  I put a little glaze on top of powdered sugar, skim milk and lemon extract.  Thanks for a great idea, and I'll buy some poppyseeds for sure to make this again.

I used a large cereal bowl and it turned out quite well at 3 min.  The middle looked different/soft at first, but cooled to the same shortly.  I reduced the sugar to a bit over half but then ended up sprinkling it on top. Not as lemony since I used lemon juice.  The milk/vinegar substitute for buttermilk seemed to work, doesn't take long.  Used a bit more poppy seeds and ground them for more flavour.  If I'd thought of it, wonder if soaking them in milk like in some other poppy seed recipes would have improved it?  Also I used whole wheat flour.  For a microwaved cake I was impressed.

If you're at high altitude like me, better split it between two mugs... mine spilled over during the cook time.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I used juice and grated peel... probably would have been more flavorful with the extract... not bad overall, especially if you sprinkle it with more sugar.

The taste was okay, but I'm reviewing to say DO NOT use yogurt as a sub for buttermilk as suggested in the Cook's Notes. I did & it was horrible!!! It came out rubbery & chewy, ick! But I will try it again, I just didn't want anyone else ending up with the mess I did :o)

I've had the microwave chocolate cake many times, and I've never once gotten it to turn out. I tried the vanilla option for this, and for a microwave cake, it was fantastic. I'm out of eggs, so I tried it without an egg and a little extra buttermilk and hoped for the best. I microwaved it for 45 seconds and sampled it then, it was very moist and dense.. But with a much,  much better texture than microwave chocolate cake.

I was expecting it to be a Little more lemony but the texture was pretty good for a microwave cup recipe.

It was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I think I could have put it in two different cups or bowls, a lot of it spilled over, most likely because my egg was an extra large egg.  Lemon glaze would enhance the taste.

I tried this and it would just burn and change colors in the middle. I tried changing the cook time because of the high wattage my microwave has. It still burned on me. It was a good experiment but I won't be doing this again.
