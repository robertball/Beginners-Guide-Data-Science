The meatballs are wonderful! I've made them several times now and tweaked the recipe a bit with more spices for flavor and mixing a pound each of veal, lamb and chorizo for a little more kick.

I made the meatballs only and they are fantastic!!!  The only change I made was using fresh mint instead of dried.
