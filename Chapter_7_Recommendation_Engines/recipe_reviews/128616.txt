I put these in the oven while guests were arriving at my son's birthday party. The aroma of cinnamon filled the house and they were a hit with the guests. I had about four cups of pumpkin seeds that were soaking in salt water overnight. I dried them in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees and then added the sugar and cinnamon and turned them every 10 minutes because of the moisture in the soaked seeds. They were nice and crunchy with a sweet and salty taste. I started eating them and couldn't stop. YUMMY!

I've always done roasted seeds with salt and decided to try a sweet version this year ... this recipe was pretty good, but not really what I expected.  They were very well coated and crunchy - almost like a caramel corn, and if you ate them with your eyes shut, you'd be hard-pressed to know there was a pumpkin seed underneath.  I think they would have been fine without the last one or two coatings.  I did not have parchment paper and just used a lightly greased cookie sheet and it seemed to work out okay.

The flavor is a nice change from the norm but the texture and recipe gave me a little trouble. Everything was going great until the last addition of the remaining 2 TBS of sugar and the last 10 min in the oven. The final bake resulted in the sugar burning a little, quickly melting and  spreading out and making more of a "brittle" out of the seeds. As "christalmiron" mentioned, they had to be individually broken apart and the excess "brittle" broken off each seed. The pumpkin is lost a little under all the sugar and cinnamon but the coating flavor is very good. We enjoyed trying a new recipe and I will try again and watch them very closely toward the end. Thanks for sharing!

yummy and perfect. I don't even like pumpkin seeds usually but these are good. I followed the recipe to the letter except I think I used about 2.5 TBS of butter since that is what I had left of one stick.  I had no issues with it turning into brittle at the end.  as soon as I pulled it out of the oven I stirred it and tapped any clumps with the edge of my spoon so maybe that was the trick.  Oh, and per one suggestion I dumped the seeds back into the bowl I used to coat them with butter and Cin/Suger the first time and stirred them in that after each baking cycle so again maybe that help my seeds to stay separate.

These turned out really good!  I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin seeds, but wanted my kids to try them and I have to say, I was impressed.  They were easy to make and not messy at all... I didn't have parchment so I used aluminum foil and lightly sprayed it with cooking spray.  I stirred the seeds and butter in a bowl to coat, then added the cinnamon and sugar (per recipe instructions)... stirred again to coat and baked... at each interval, I put the seeds back in the bowl to mix and recoat.  Had to cook an additional 10 min to get the consistency I wanted, but other than that, I didn't change anything :).

I wanted to refrain from rating because I dont know what went wrong...I followed the directions, but it was a disaster!  :(  I tried 2 different trays with the same end result, hardened, candified, stuck on seeds that I eventually had to heat up and scrape off the pans.  Anyway, the house smelled good...

Ok so this was the first time I tried this recipe it tasted great but was a pain in the you know what to make first it was impossible to dry the seeds 100% second while it was cooking it was a sticky mess third after i took them out to cool they were all stuck together like peanut brittle so i had to take an extra hour to separate every last seed due to the fact it is my sons snack day to bring snack to school on Monday and he is only in kindergarten and this is what he wanted to bring for snack. I never thought it would be this hard to make a snack for my son. the only thing good I can say after all that was said and done was that they had a great taste to them.

After reading all the reviews, I was a little skeptical, but they turned out great!! I may have used a bit more butter than it says, but they were crispy, sweet & cinnamony! They didn't stick together or burn, just had to separate them after cooling. Thank you!

I only used about 1 Tablespoon melted butter. I also have a big shaker that has cinnamon and sugar mixed already(we love cinnamon and sugar). So this was really easy to follow. They did come out good, but may have over baked just a little.  So, just keep checking them and turning them.

I'm not sure why this recipe calls for so much of the sugar mix in so many layers.  2 coats was enough.

This was yummy! My seeds might have been a bit watery still because they never brittled like other people said. I did add some nutmeg to the sugar mixture which was a nice touch!

I followed the recipe exactly (with the minor exceptions of mixing the first portion of sugar and cinnamon in the bowl before spreading it in the pan and using foil instead of parchment) and it worked perfectly for me.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers might have done differently except perhaps they didn't have a full 2 cups of seeds? I will definitely make these again!

I have to say even though these taste great, they are not worth the hassle. I found it was a huge waste of supplies as most of it stuck to the paper. And I had to pick them apart...one by one...it was exactly like peanut brittle! Although I have a sweet tooth, I will go back to my reg. recipe for pumpkin seeds.

I followed the recipe through three rounds of the coat with sugar and cinnamon and the 5 minute bake.  But at that point I decided there was plenty of coating and just finished off the bake time after a stir.  I only read the troubled reviews afterwards.  I think cutting down those last coatings would solve the problem of brittle that others were describing.  It tastes fantastic, just what I was looking for.  We'll just have to see if there will be any seeds left when the kids come home from school!!  :)

I love the original pumpkin seeds seasoned with just seasoning salt, but these were so much more delicious! They taste more like cinnamon-sugar almonds. They are fantastic! Thank you so much! Definitely a new tradition.

I enjoyed this recipe alot. It was very easy to make, and turned out delicious! I did accidentally stray from the recipe a bit, and added a bit more cinnamon and sugar than called for, but that just made it even better! My family loved them, my neighbors loved them, and I got addicted to them. Definitely a make again.

These are DELICIOUS!  I add a sprinkle of salt on the last coat, it makes them just right.  When you coat them, I find it easier to dump them into a bowl and mix them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  It seems to stick better that way.  I did not find these to be difficult at all, and really not too messy.  Well worth the effort.

This recipe turned out great! I was a little apprehensive when I read some of the previous reviews so I made few a few changes and was very pleased with the results. I substituted homemade pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinnamon and I baked them each stage for 10 minutes. They were terrific! Like honey roasted peanuts except they were pumpkin seeds! Will definitely make again!

It got very sticky for me and I have had better tasting sweet seeds. The seeds also didn't cook all the way thru.

YUM! Reminds me of the flavor of Kettle Corn! I didn't use the butter as I didn't want the extra calories and fat. Instead I just sprayed the baking pan with cooking spray. I used only enough sugar and cinnamon to lightly coat them.

This was our first attempt with pumpkin seeds - just found it to be "meh".  The cinnamon stuck to the seeds but the sugar - not so much.

Sweet and crunchy. I made it a little less messy and used less dishes by tossing the seeds, butter, cinnamon, and sugar in a freezer bag and then poured right onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper. (:

Followed directions and it burned really fast. I recommend lowering the temp and not doing the last 10 minutes.

My kids loved this recipe.  It is a nice change from the usually salty seed recipes. I followed the recipe as directed.  Only difference is that I washed and dried my seeds the day before so they were good and dry.  There were some seeds that stuck together like brittle, but that didn't seem to bother my son who is devouring them at this moment.

These were very good.  I followed the recipe as written and it took some work to mix and re-mix in cinnamon sugar, but I think that resulted in the seeds being very well coated and evenly cooked.  This was my first time making pumpkin seeds that were sweet and we thought they were yummy.

I made these yesterday for my family along with the "traditional" pumpkin seeds my whole family raved about them and my daughter asked why I didn't make all the seeds this way.  Needless to say we went and bought 2 more pumpkins to care so I can make them more of these seeds!

These were awesome.  My husband and I don't usually like pumpkin seeds, but I decided to give this recipe a try since we usually do a salty version.  These were great.  I did cut back on the sugar a bit.

I made two batches of this tonight with our pumpkin seeds from last night's pumpkin carving. I was in a hurry and didn't read the directions very well. Instead of 2T of sugar, I was using 2t sugar each time. They turned out really good. I think maybe using less sugar prevented the "brittle" version that several reviewers complained about. I also used parchment paper on my baking sheet and just slid the seeds back into the bowl to add each round of cinnamon and sugar. Very little mess for a very yummy result.

Delicious! I just put the ingredients in a big plastic container and shook them around at each interval. Worked like a charm. I also use a silicone sheet on my pan so very easy clean-up without added grease.

First time I've tried pumpkin seeds, let alone roast them. These were awesome! I only did the cinnamon sugar coating twice as I thought it would be sweet enough for me, and they were! Thank you for sharing :)

Have been using this recipe for a couple of years, now.  I love it!  This year I decided to add a pinch of ground cloves and a pinch of nutmeg to the mix.  Talk about Delicious!  Its like having a pumpkin pie!  Minus most of the fat and calories generally associated with any pie.  Always fun to tinker with and experiment around some of my favorite recipes.  This is definitely one of them.

Fabulous recipe...they came out perfect.  I used parchment paper, so every time they needed to be mixed with sugar it was easy to pick up the paper and slide the seeds into the bowl.  I spread them out as best I could every time and after the last 10 minute bake I didn't think they were quite roasted enough so they went back in for another 5.  I did use 3 cups of pumpkin seeds because that's what I had on hand, which may be why I needed a little more cooking time.  Anyway they're delicious...roasty, toasty, crunchy and cinnamony!

This is an excellent recipe. Considering I have, not a sweet tooth, but rather a sweet jaw, this was right up my alley! I actually skipped pouring butter for one cycle (running low) and they still turned out perfect. Definitely will be making this again.

These were so tasty! I had never had sweet pumpkin seeds before, what a treat! I also added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spices. The house smelled so good while these were baking - we could hardly wait until they cooled down. YUM! They didn't last long :-) I saved a handful and used them the next day to sprinkle on top of a pumpkin loaf before I popped it into the oven - this turned out great :-)

Yum! Reminds me of caramel popcorn.  My 3 year-old thought it was so much fun!
