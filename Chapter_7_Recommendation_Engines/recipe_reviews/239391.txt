I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used pumpkin pie mix instead of pure pumpkin puree. I also put a tablespoon of it in the frosting. At the end, I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar mix on top . Instead of cupcakes, I used 2 of Pampered Chef's brownie pan and they made perfect squares. Made them for a party  and they were a hit!

The cupcake was very moist. Didn't care for the frosting had to make adjustments with some more powdered sugar , vanilla and butter. Will make it again.
