I made a batch but doctored it up a bit because the reviews were less than likeable.  I added sugar to the topping, cinnamon to the cookie batter then topped it with finely shredded coconut.   I like the idea of a bar because it is so much faster. Will keep checking back on this to see if anyone else tried my trick!! goodluck

I grew up with snickerdoodle cookies and I was amazed to see this recipe for snickerdoodle bars.  I was really disappointed with the outcome.  It was cake and after they sat for about 1 hour they were dry and bland.

I loved the spongy texture of this, and I loved how simple and easy it was.  Unfortunately, I found it very bland.  Maybe with a little tweaking it can be more flavorful.

WARNING!  This is a  1 inch high cake!!!  It is NOT a COOKIE bar. I was hoping and  expecting it to be like a cookie because I had to mail it to Aurtralia!!!!  And it was very plain to boot.

These are okay, but They are missing something.  Definately not sweet enough.  I will have to play with the recipe & adjust it to my families tastes.

This cake bar turns out very bland; I even added cinnamon to the batter and sugar to the topping.  Perhaps substituting butter for the shortening would help.  I will not make these again; my family would not eat them.

Something went wrong with this recipie.
It baked up kind of like a cake.
My walnuts may have been a little old.
It was hardly worth eating.

I don't understand all the negative reviews.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out like snickerdoodle cookies except it didn't fall like the cookies do.
This recipe is moist and buttery and makes allot a bars.
We enjoy this tremendously and will certainly make it again.
I was raised on Snickerdoodles and this is so much easier than baking batches of cookies.
It does need to bake about 8-10 minutes longer.

Makes a cake bar with nuts and cinnamon on top. Tastes like Snickerdoodles too, and isn't so sweet. Easy to make but might not be the first choice if there is  chocolate bars right next to them

Not sure how to rate these.... I was wanting a bar type cookie, but instead, this is a coffee CAKE!!! These are NOT BARS!! (I was really wanting bars) That said... it was a very moist and delicious cake. The first time I made these, I put cinnamon in the batter, but I prefer a white cake, so the next time I made these, I left the cinn out of the  batter and made a topping of sugar, cinn, nutmeg, walnuts and finely shredded coconut. It turned out delish! Also, in a 9x13 pan, the cook time is longer than the stated 10-15 minutes. I believe mine took about half an hour.. but I can't remember... I just took it out when the toothpick inserted in center came out clean.

This recipe didn't taste anything like a snickerdoodle, or even a snickerdoodle bar. It came out tasting like a not moist sponge cake, but it was ok. I hope it turns out better next time if I make it.

Warning! This is NOT any type of bar! its a cake and it is mediocre AT BEST. Would not recommend this recipe unless you are looking for a sponge cake and even then I don't believe it is worth it.

As others have said this is more cake than cookie. I love snickerdoodles and found this lacking the bite that snickerdoodles should have.  I used cinnamon sugar as the topping rather than just cinnamon. While mine didn't dry out as others did it was a little bland. I will probably try it again with some tweeking. Maybe add some cinnamon chips to the batter and some cream of tartar to get the bite.

I used butter due to lacking shortening. While this is certainly not a cookie bar, it makes an excellent, if somewhat short, cake. I thought it would turn out eggy and custard-like.  Going with the cake angle, I would prefer a more pronounced cinnamon taste, and so, next time I make this, I intend to add 8 tsp cinnamon to the sugar to make cinnamon sugar and make a cinnamon streusel topping with nuts, baking the topping on top. I also will add vanilla extract.

I made these for our Kids n Christ wednesdays . I love'em, but we will see how the kids like them.
I had to use margarine and I did put brown sugar on top. I also placed saran wrap over the dough and
Rolled it into the pan. A little difficult but still easier then using my hands.

Following some of the comments made I made some tweaks to it myself. Added teaspoon of vanilla used margarine instead of shortening did not melted just mixed up as I would with cookies or cake. Added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and some walnuts to the batter. If I had had some coconut would've probably added coconut on the top along with the cinnamon walnuts and I did add some sugar too. And it did need to be baked about 30 minutes. Maybe it should be called snickerdoodle coffeecake instead of a bar.

For those of you who thought it was bland - ADD MORE SALT! A pinch is not enough in any baking recipe.  Salt is great for bringing out flavors.  I used 1/2 tsp salt and this Snickerdoodle CAKE was delicious.

These were delicious! I followed everything, except that I added two teaspoons of cocoa powder for personal preference, and baked for about 25 minutes. But they were fluffy and tasty. :)

Wish I would have read reviews before making this. Is nothing like a bar and tastes like eggs! It is pretty much a dry, thin cake!

This is a cake and it is AWFUL.  I tried tweeking it several times but nothing takes the egg-flavor out.  My husband wouldn't even touch it and he loves cakes.

This was okay. Kind of bland. But it is not a Snickerdoodle. Not even close. The classic Snickerdoodle has cream of tartar in it.

Very disappointing in terms of taste and texture.  It is very egg flavored and not the bar cookie I expected, although with a bit of tinkering it would be an acceptable sponge cake.
