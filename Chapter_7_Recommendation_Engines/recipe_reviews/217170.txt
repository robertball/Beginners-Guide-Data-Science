Followed all the directions, even added extra vital wheat gluten because it felt like it would fall apart.  I was still nervous but went ahead.. I simmered most of it and the rest I sauteed.  It fell apart like crazy.  The flavor it good but it's practically mush.  I'm currently trying to salvage it by baking what was simmered. I'm hoping that will pull enough moisture out and not have this be a complete waste.

Added about an extra 1/2 cup of VWG based on previous comment but texture and flavor both turned out nice.

This is a basic recipe, and the proportions of liquid to dry are about right. Seitan needs oil IN the dough to develop the gluten--not in the cooking liquid, and never let it come to more than a slow simmer. 
I like to roll a log and then slice into cutlet then simmer them in a skillet with just enough water to cover, turning halfway. I also use more seasoning- usually using a variety of condiments that seem to accumulate in the fridge. 
I like this best dredged in seasoned flour and lightly sauteed.

Soggy, but tasted good!!!  I'm going to try it again, but add less liquids.  We'll see how it goes!

I made this for my son and did not know what I was doing, but followed the recipe exactly.  It came out great and is ready to be seasoned and cooked in a pan!

This was excellent. Loved the flavor and it was moist. I sauteed them similar to a recipe on here and it was fantastic.
