I have always been fond of potato soup but stayed away due to the calories.  I was so excited to find this recipe -- it's sooooo good!

Delicious!
My family and I really enjoyed it. The measurements for 5 gave just over 2.5L.

I only used 1 1/2 onions and it was still way too much, the canadian bacon was overpowered. Might be ok in a small amount as a soup course but I found it too creamy/monotonus to stand as a meal alone. The next day I ended up adding 2 med. cubed baked potatoes, a cup more chicken broth, and bacon bits to add some texture.
