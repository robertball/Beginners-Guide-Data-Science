What it lacks in pizazz it makes up for with mush. This is a homely sandwich -- Swiffering in sweatpants, shopping without makeup, watching Rachael Ray. It forgives you your lack of properly calibrated measuring devices, and this commitment to mediocrity is oddly endearing. Sometimes we don't want to feel held to society's standards of excellence. Sometimes we don't want to compete. Sometimes, maybe more often than we'd like to admit, we just want to melt two or three pasty-white ingredients together and look at Facebook for an hour. This dish is almost an act of rebellion, if you think about it.

Uber-quick and easy to make, and tastes great to boot.  Have discovered that certain brands of tuba make this filling a little more watery than desired.  Bumble bee is the best brand I've found to use so far.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an excellent, yet basic tuna melt recipe.  It was not too difficult to prepare, and it was so tasty.  I enjoyed the balsalmic, dijon and dill pickle flavors, they blend well together.  I found that the tuna mix was enough for two sandwiches.  What a great idea to have the bread toast in the oven while you make the filling, I like multitasking! I would definitely make this recipe again, I wouldn't change a thing!

I put the toast in like the recipe said and then when it was done preheating I put all the goodies on top...at 4 minutes my sandwhich was pretty much burnt. 

Also in case anyone wants to kick a few calories out of the equation, don't use mayo...just relish, a little lemon juice and some cracked black pepper.

This is delicious, fast, and easy to make because everything is on hand!  It doesn't need the salt though, I've never added it.  I make it as an open faced sandwich and just let the cheese melt over it, I think it would be great with english muffins too.

We really enjoyed this! I love the addition of the balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard, which in my opinion is what makes this recipe stand out. Also, be sure to taste this first because you could easily add more mustard and vinegar to what you prefer.  I did add a tad more mayo  and a dash of freshly ground black pepper. I served these open faced, adding a few slices of tomato and topped with the cheddar. I definitely will make these again, thanks for sharing :)

fantastic!I used cheese slices and four slices of white bread and put tuna and a cheese slice on each piece. Then after taking out of the oven I placed the slices together making two sandwiches!

This was delicious! I used this recipe with a thomas' hearty grains 100% whole wheat bagel and split it with my boyfriend. I also used Cabot Vermont Extra Sharp Cheddar and just the littlest bit of Chalula hot sauce on top. Gave it a little extra something :)

This isn't bad at all.  I've never had a tuna sandwich with balsamic vinegar in it, and the kick was refreshing.

I made a few changes -- I used white bread and Famous Dave's Hellfire Pickles, because that's all I had -- but I don't think either of those made much of a difference, beside the obvious.

The fat American in me wants to butter up the bread and grill it properly, next time.  And I'm sure there will be a next time.

Loved the recipe, but for me, next time I am going to put less dijon mustard. But it was easy and has a light, not heavy taste.  I will be making it again.

Perfect for week days, easy and good!  A little heavy though: next time it's going to be a meal for two, with a salad on the side.  Used bell peppers instead of celery.

Wow! I never thought that balsamic vinegar could could taste good in tuna! I substituted the Dijon mustard with deli mustard because I was afraid that it would have too much of a kick with the vinegar. And I used mazarella cheese (I only had string mazarella cheese so I shredded that). This is such a great recipe because everyone should have these ingredients laying around the house. But the best part? I only made one sandwich so I had a ton of leftover tuna. Which you can save, or be like me and eat it plain while waiting for the melt to finish. I just couldn't resist!!!! THIS IS THE BEST! IT'S A NEED TO TRY RECIPE!

Pretty simple and yummy. Added a little less mustard and included chopped jalapenos. Do not need to be in the oven for more than 3-5 min.

I normally don't like the thought of hot mayonnaise and tuna, but I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised! The combo of balsamic, dijon and dill pickle really made an interesting flavor. I will make it again. Very good.

Very good. I liked the idea that this recipe had of using Dijon mustard and vinegar, which is why I am reviewing this particular version of this classic. My preference is to add a little more mayo than this calls for, minced celery and minced onion, a dash of cayenne pepper, and no salt. A couple slices of tomato and lettuce are wonderful with this as well, and served on a hoagie roll.

I agree with a previous reviewer to skip the salt.  Next time I may add pepper, paprika and a bit of chopped onion to the mix.  Nonetheless, a simple, fast cheap recipe that I'll use again.

I altered the recipe a little bit (well maybe a lot once I was close to finishing this review!)by switching the dijon mustard with a spicy brown, regular for fat free mayo, the salt with pepper, threw in a pinch of celery seed, a little bit of chopped purple onion and changed the cheddar with swiss for the hubby's. Rather than fire up my oven, I cooked the sandwiches on my panini grill.

An excellent tuna melt, and the recipe is forgiving, as I misread it and used a TBS of balsamic vinegar instead of a teaspoon.  Oops.  It was still delicious, and with the correct measurements, would probably earn that elusive fifth star.  Preheating the bread while putting the tuna together worked perfectly, and made for a crisp, cheesy, wonderfully heated sandwich.

Kind of sodium dense...I would add  light cheese, diced onion, peppers, sliced black olives, some spinach, just half a can of tuna.
I don't like balsamic vinegar or mayo for this melt, and i'd simple use one slice of bread. and when taken done toasting just top it off with a nice, heafty lettuce leaf.

Yum! Will make again. I left out the salt, and also the pickles because I didn't have any, and it was great. I'm sure it's also great with the pickles; I'm just not much of a pickle person so I never seem to have them around. I also made it as an open faced sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad, but nothing to write home about either.  Instead of toasting the bread, I used my new panini press and turned it into a tuna panini melt.  I think it needed just a little more flavor - perhaps next time I'll add more dill pickle and more dijon mustard.  We'll have these again.

This was so delicious!! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I made a number of adjustments based on what I had - I used pear infused vinegar, mozzarella cheese instead; and I added sprigs of dill and red chili pepper flakes for some spiciness. We'll be making this often!

Great taste, easy to make!  I didn't have shredded cheese so I used slices and it worked just fine.  Also used sourdough instead of wheat bread.  My family really enjoyed this recipe!

This was one of the best recipes I have tasted!  Loved the balsamic vinegar - gave it a great taste.  Less salt for those who should watch their intake though.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing

My family was not impressed with this recipe. I like balsamic vinegar but don't think it belonged with the tuna salad.

very yummy! I used fat free cheddar cheese & only mixed in the fat free mayo & some pickles into my tuna. I lightly toasted my bread & I'm glad I did that because it became quite brown when I baked it in the oven to melt the cheese. thanks for such a fast, healthy recipe!

Quick and easy.  I also omitted the salt, you don't miss it.  And I added some chopped
onion.  Whoever heard of tuna without chopped onion?  lol  Was very good!

Pretty good and quick!  I add a little Bay Seasoning instead of salt and place tuna mix and cheese on each bread slice and then combine.

I enjoyed the recipe thoroughly, though I did have a few issues. Next time I don't intend to put my bread in the oven while it preheats. I ended up with very, very toasty bread. I also ended up with extra tuna salad, and that's after putting a giant lump onto the sandwich! Thankfully I do have some crackers around today to make up where the sandwich lacks. I omitted the salt and the vinegar... salt because I really don't need any more in my diet, and vinegar because I just don't like the stuff.

I'd have to say that the people making this recipe probably aren't looking for haute cuisine--just a quick and tasty lunch. Don't worry folks, "brooklynsurecooks" seems to be queening. Maybe it's his time of the month. ;)

If you have a Costco available, the Kirkland Tuna is great.  I do not add salt.  I  cook in a skillet on stovetop (like a grilled cheese sandwich). For us, one can of tuna makes two generous sandwiches.

This recipe is so yummy! I tweaked it a little- I substituted the dijon with ground mustard, and added tarragon and a dash of ground red pepper. Great midnight snack!

I've always made a more traditional version of this but thought I'd try something new. I didn't like it as much with the balsamic vinegar and mustard.

Toasting the bread in the preheating oven is a GREAT idea and the timing was perfect - I used only 2 teaspoons mayo instead of tablespoons and the tuna mixture was still a little softer than I'd like - and I did drain the tuna well!

We have made tuna melts for a quick, cheap dinner for years.  I toast a sourdough english muffin lightly, pile on the tuna and cheese then bake a few to melt everything together.  serve open face alongside a cup of cambells tomato soup and that's dinner.

This was okay, but there was nothing special about it. I don't think the addition of the vinegar and dijon mustard did much to enhance the flavor. It tasted like regular tuna salad. Nothing bad about it at all, just not amazing. Thanks :)

Pretty good.  I like the idea that this melt is on an English muffin.  But instead of hot peppers I used sliced pepperchini's. As well as a little mayo, salt and pepper. I made these for dinner and and the leftovers for lunch the next day, cold.  They're good cold too.

Easy & I thought these were just what I wanted...a tasty little tuna sandwich.  Not fussy, no showing off...but an easy and yummy tuna lunch or dinner! Great because I had all of the stuff already! 2nd time I made it, kids ate theirs cold on saltine crackers and they liked it better like that (no cheese for them).

I used solid white tuna and a little more mayo (2.5 tbsp). I also used celery salt, which gives it more flavor. 

Chunk tuna doesn't need more mayo.

Sourdough bread works best for tuna.

Taste was great, but the tuna seemed to be too wet. I doubled the recipe and doubled the stir-ins to the tuna. Next time I will probably try using the stir-ins as is with double the tuna.

First time ever making a tuna melt and I will be making these again.  I was out of pickles so substituted marinated asparagus which gave it just the tang needed!  Added sliced avocado and tomatoes on the side...YUM!

Best tuna melt!!!

I never liked tuna melts,  I was raised thinking they were tuna,  mayo,  American single YUCK. But hubby requested and I found this.  We've made it at least half a dozen times now. 

Only changes are a little more pickle (I misread as Tbsp the first time) and we use this amount of filling for 2 sandwiches. 

Quick,  tasty dinner!!

A good Tuna Melt is one of my all time favorite sandwiches~and this was good enough to enjoy, though I added a little minced onion to pep it up a tad. 
I was raised with Miracle Whip, and I prefer my own Tuna Melt hands down. All it is:
Tuna, Miracle Whip, chopped sweet pickles, minced onion all mixed- over oven toasted wheat or white bread with a slice of cheddar popped back under the broiler til melted and served  open face. Oh so yummy—try it!

Absolutely delicious! Who would have thought to add balsamic vinegar to a tuna concoction? I lessened the baking time to about 5 minutes just until the cheese was melted and the tuna was hot and I made sure to mush out the extra juice in the tuna as other reviewers mentioned. This will become my favorite afternoon snack!

I don't like tuna much but pickles et al make all the difference! I mixed up half the tuna acct to the recipe and the other half with just mayonnaise for the girls. A slice of American on top instead of shredded cheese. I used Grands biscuits. It made about six sandwiches. Jeff loved it!

I used Kraft sliced cheese because I didn't have shredded cheese.  Also I didn't have the dill so I left that out. I added a little pepper.  This recipe is very tasty.  The the Dijon and vinegar gives it a little tang which is a nice change on usual tuna melts.

Liked it a lot!  
Was easy, had everything in the pantry.  Used Dark Rye bread and sharp Cheddar cheese.  Did not have Dill pickles, so left that out.
Delicious, had a taste like Deviled ham.

This was so simple and easy (huge bonus for us - as working parents of a 3-month old we rarely have time for elaborate meals anymore!) and surprisingly good. The balsamic is a great, subtle touch. We used a relish instead of pickles, and high-quality tuna. Skimped on the mayo b/c thats just our style. Paired with some greens it made an easy and healthy dinner. Will add this to our regular rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

I've used this recipe several times, but I liked it best when I made it with kalamata olive sourdough bread from the bakery and freshly grated mozzarella cheese. I always use Natural Sea brand tuna. It's less watery and more tasty than other brands and can be found in most health food stores.

I love this recipe! It's a quick easy meal. I spiced mine up by adding a dash of hot sauce and a pinch of paprika. Perfection! Served with either salad, a whole avocado, or chips

Well there has to be some big eaters here!

I'd say this is enough for two people; especially if served with fries ;-)

I added some pepper; then some tomato slices on the cheese and some lettuce before joining the two halves together.

I thought these were really tasty.  I added chopped celery and red pepper because I just prefer that to dill pickle, but the addition of balsamic vinegar gave it a really nice flavour. I toasted the bread about half way in the toaster and then covered each piece with tuna and shredded cheese, popped it in the oven, and then had it as an open face. Yummy and easy!

Lovely! Was sceptic about the balsamic vinegar and mustard but all the flavors compliment each other. However, I did add finely chopped onion and cellery. Thanks for sharing

Couldn't really taste the vinegar or mustard.  Tasted like your basic tuna sand.

I skipped the balsamic vinegar, and subbed regular musarted for dijon.  I also used 2 tsp minced onion for the pickles and added a splash of granulated garlic.  It was great!

This tasted good, but a little too vinegary for me, next time I will decrease the vinegar and increase the mayo.  Other than that, it was quick and easy!

I have my own tuna recipe I've used for 45 years but I never knew how to put together a tuna melt. This helped me very much, but don't use rye bread, it toasts a little hard. Sandi

This recipe was great! I didn't add the salt (as previously suggested), I also halved the amount of mayonnaise in the original, but it still had wonderful flavor.. It was a quick & easy, certainly a pleasant surprise!

I split it into two sandwiches and used what I had handy.  No pickles.  Swiss cheese instead of cheddar.

I liked the way it turned out.  A good quick lunch. Very easy.  I'll make this again.

I may have added too much salt to the tuna, but this was outrageously salty, in my opinion. Next time I will leave out salt all together.
