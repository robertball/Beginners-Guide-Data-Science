This meal just tasted tropical! I didn't know what to expect but it was great. I used 1/2 the coconut milk to cut some calories a whole can of black beans and 2 bananas.

I kept stumbling on this recipe while doing ingredient searches. Since I had all of the ingredients I gave it a whirl. It was certainly interesting but a little on the sweet side and very soupy despite using less than half the coconut milk.

I thought the dish would be too soupy too sweet under-seasoned but it's absolutely perfect. I served it on rice and as it takes no time to make it's going to be a staple meal in my house. My kids also loved it no doubt because it's rich and sweet and comforting. I will likely add the entire can of beans next time as well as the whole lime and an extra half of a banana so that I might have left-overs.

I quite enjoyed this sauce. It was good over the rice... I think I may try it over some pancakes as well since it was such a sweet dessert-y flavour. My husband did not enjoy this when I served it hot but actually liked it better later on after it had soaked into the rice and been refrigerated. I also really loved finding a sweet recipe to use blackbeans!

This definitely seemed more like a breakfast porridge than a dinner. It tasted good but was very rich and sweet. Odd for dinner! FYI - I made 1/2 cup (dry) basmati rice with this dish and it seemed to be the right proportions.

This tasted just as I thought it would. Really perfect for Winter blahs! Hubby loved it and the kids enjoyed it as well. It is sweet but not too sweet and the beans mellow the flavor. I used coconut oil as the cooking oil and the bananas were perfect! Yeah there are a lot of calories... that said this is a VERY filling meal and the serving size is (in my opinion) very large (I am a big person and I couldnt eat my whole portion!). Thank you for sharing! (I forgot to mention we served this over jasmine rice)

This intrigued me I had all the ingredients and gave it a try. My rating is closer to 3 1/2-4 stars. I used the entire can of coconut milk and the whole thing turned out very soupy and runny so I'll cut that back next time. I served over brown basmati rice and the dish kind of felt like a breakfast porridge. I liked the taste and may just eat it for breakfast!

Add a little extra honey if needed and it will give it a sweeter taste.

Definitely interesting...but didn't suit my taste. Not bad at all. I think the sweet/soupy/warm situation just confused me. I decided to put in some oatmeal to thicken it and will eat it for breakfast. Give it a shot for fun and curiosity!

My husband loved it but I wasn't that thrilled. Not my preference though it was good for what it was. Just too unusual for me! My husband wanted to add chicken to it so I think we are going to take the leftovers and pour them over a chicken breast and see how that tastes. May be better than over brown rice!

Made this for breakfast. It was good but I will try with plantains next time. I think they will give it a more authentic and better flavor than bananas.

The recipe is great but I found it to be a little sweet and bland. I see that a lot of people said it was soupy if you start with a roux (which I did) it will thicken the sauce. I added a clove of garlic minced 1 diced tomato 1/2 an onion chopped and crushed red pepper to taste (also some garlic chicken sausage). It turned out GREAT! I served with some brown rice and enjoyed thoroughly!

My kids had a friend over for dinner and I needed something easy and quick they all raved about this dish! I added a dash of cinnamon and served it over rice it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely make this again!

Quick. Easy. Kids hated it. But to me this really was okay like acceptably good but not something for which I think I'll spend the extra money for coconut milk........ BUT because I love the idea of a new bean breakfast dish - I thought about what I could do to try to make this work for me.....: I'LL ADD EXTRA LIME JUICE ALLSPICE RED PEPPER FLAKES (just a touch) BLACK PEPPER (just a touch) FRESH GINGER (tossed in before the banana) JALAPENOS (on top at the end - the tamed type so I can eat a lot of them) AND (well for me... salt is a must but I've salted ice cream before......)... HMMMM AND???MAYBE SOME FRESH BANANA SALSA w/Ginger ON TOP??? That might make it work (might try plantains instead though - both in with the beans and in the salsa)........ OOOOOOO AND TOASTED COCONUT FLAKES - at which point I might be able to forego the coconut milk and use some other type of milk........ that's it..... gotta make this again!

Wonderful and simple. I used 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt instead of coconut milk since I was out. I used coconut oil for my cooking oil though so it still had the coconut flavor. I think the yogurt might have made it slightly less soupy than some people have mentioned although it'd still be good over rice. Next time I want to try it over chicken.
