Everyone loved this nice cool summer salad.  I did revise ingredients a little.  I used fresh, blanched corn and green beans.  I left out the peas, but they would have been good in it.  I used red pepper instead of green, and skipped the pimentos.  I also added sliced black olives for color. The marinade was excellent.  Try 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup white balsamic for a variation.

This was an easy, delicious salad to make. The only change I'd make would be to use frozen peas, green beans, and corn rather than canned. The canned veggies were a little gray and detracted from the visual appeal of the salad. But overall, this is a great recipe.

Excellent recipe, I made a rather large batch for a food show and everyone loved it.  I did make the following changes - I used frozen whole green beans, frozen cut corn and frozen peas.  I ommitted the pimentos (because I think they are gross so everyone else should too ;-)), used red, green and yellow bell peppers and used olive oil not vegetable.  Yummy!

I had a "salad tasting" dinner - we tried 5 new ones from this site and THIS was everyone's favorite - from my 10 year old daughter through my teenagers and finishing with my husband and very picky mother in law!!!  I omitted the peas (I hate canned peas!) and added a small can of slivered water chestnuts - fabulous.   Thanks Patsy - this will be a favorite for years to come in my house!!

This was one of the best vegetable salads I've ever made. I'm not real big on green lettuce salads but vegetables like these are great. The flavor of this salad was wonderful. I made this for a womens prayer group I go to and they all loved it. Thanks.

A very big hit at the office. Even the lady who doesn't eat veggies asked for the recipe! Tastes extremely sweet, though, so I may back off the sugar measurements next time, but overall a definite winner for the pot luck list.

We really enjoyed this recipe (don't have children at home anymore so can't say how "kid friendly" it would be).  It keeps for several days in the refrigerator and the last serving tastes just as great as the first.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few changes-- Splenda instead of sugar (cut quite a few calories off), olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used some onion powder instead of onion (wife doesn't like onion texture), 1 stalk of celery and no added salt.  It turned out great.

I'm not really fond of green bean salads, but those who ate it said it was VERY good  :)  I put in a handful of green olives as well and many people said they couldn't get enough of it.  Very good!  I will use less sugar next time, however, as I don't like how sweet it is.

Although I made some changes, this is a spectacular tasting salad! First, I used 1 1/2 cups each of frozen green beans & corn instead of canned (one reviewer asked if they should be cooked first - no, simply put into a strainer, run under water and toss into bowl. This keeps them crisp!) I also added a can of 5 bean medley (Unico brand), didn't use pimentos, used red pepper instead of green, 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and 2 tbsp of onion powder instead of onion because my husband can't eat onions. What a great tasting salad for summer! Thanks so much!

This is a delicious twist to the ever popular 4 bean salad...one that I like better and tastes much fresher! I did make a few changes based on personal preference. I made this using foods I had on hand...to the frozen corn,green beans and peas I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies (the carrots added a punch of color),cut the sugar to 3/4c cup, used 1/4 cup garlic infused olive oil, a teaspoon of tarragon flakes, 1 teaspoon mustard powder and a teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice. I omitted the pimentos,celery & water.  Thank you for such a tasty & healthy salad:-)

This is a delicious and unusual marinated veggie salad that would be good to tote to a cookout or potluck.  Best eaten within 2 days!

This recipe has been in my family for years and everyone likes it.  The only difference is that I would advise using La Soeur Petite peas and french cut green beens.  This is a great dish for cook outs , picnic and potlucks!  The longer it sits the better!!

I omitted the pimentos, used a can of white shoepeg corn instead of regular, and added 1 small can of mexican style corn.  The only other change I made was reducing the oil to 1/4 cup.  I feel that 1/2 cup just makes the salad too oily, which is my reason for 4 stars and not 5.

My family really loves this!  It is a cool and refreshing summer side dish.  I usually use frozen vegetables, red pepper instead of green, and omit the pimiento.  The frozen vegetables give the dish better color. Thanks for the recipe!

This came out wonderful.  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used about 1/3 of the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Used leftover fresh string beans and leftover corn scraped from the cob. Left out the pimentos, not too crazy about those.  Everyone loved and said how fresh it tasted.  Even the picky eaters liked it.  Will make this every summer now.

Very tasty...did not add pimentos because I didn't have any.  I reduced the sugar some but it could easily be reduced by half in not more without affecting the taste.

This tasted OK but it looked horrible. I made it just as stated in recipe (only halfing dressing) and it just looked ugly. I will not make this again unless I use all fresh veggies.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe. Instead of making my own dressing for the salad, I just used Italian dressing and it was delicious!!! I used 1 can green beans, 1 can corn, 4 small celery stalks chopped up, about 1/2 cup of chopped carrots, and 1/2 an onion chopped up. I then mixed it with about 1/2 cup of Italian dressing. Everyone loved it!!!

Excellent! We took this to a picnic. It held up well and was a nice, crisp veggie side dish. Used fresh or frozen veggies, no canned.  Used red pepper instead of green.  (No pimentos.) Replaced white vinegar with apple cider vinegar and used WAY less sugar.  I actually used agave nectar to sweeten it and only used 2 tablespoons of it, or so.  Will make often. So yummy!

Great sweet and sour type salad! I wouldn't recommend using the canned peas, they are mushy enough even before marinating. I used frozen peas straight out of the bag, no need to thaw. I prefer yellow or red peppers over green, so that's what I used. I would make this again, it's quick and easy to throw together.

This recipe is a keeper.  I ended up putting in a can of drained black beans, to make it a little more substantial for my fussy teenager.  This salad is good the day it's made and I think better the next day.

I have made this recipe for about 15 years. (Mine is called Marinated Vegetables and came from south Georgia.) Except for the corn and water, and using just a single serving can of peas, it is the same.  I would leave the water out.  It gets crunchier the longer it is refrigerated.  It will keep a week or longer in the refrigerator because of the amt of vinegar and sugar. We love it with meals and as a relish with sandwiches.

Too much dressing. No need to add water.Cut way back on the sugar, oil and vinegar.

Really good. The only thing I did differently was to use Splenda instead of sugar, and I omitted the water. It tasted even better after 12 hours in the frdige. Thanks, Patsy!

This is a delicious salad and lovely to look at as well! I used frozen veggies also and added chopped onion. It keeps several days in the refrigerator and in fact tastes even better the longer it marinates. I'll definitely make it again.

This is very good! But being a woman I had to change a few things, I only use 1/2 cup sugar(and next time I make it I am going to use sweetner have to watch my sugar) and I use blanched frozen peas

This is a fantastic summer salad, with a few modifications (yielding a 5-star rating).  I used all organics vegs (canned), just 2 T oil, perhaps 1/4 c white balsamic vinegar, and a sprinkle of Stevia, completely eliminating the need for white (yikes!) sugar, and no water. I can't stop eating it!

I was able to use garden fresh green beans from my father, as well as some various peppers he had grown in his garden, it was a big hit with the in-law family, so it's a keeper!

I'm sorry but we didn't like this at all. It was WAY too sweet and we weren't a fan of the sweet/vinegary concoction.

I made this salad today and couldn't wait four hours so tried them after an hour and a half. It was so good, I can imagine how good it will be after it sits a little longer. Can't wait. Followed the recipe. Thanks Patsy. I have something new to serve for the next family gathering.

This is a great recipe the only change I made was using 1/2 rice vinegar along with the 1/2 cup white vinegar.  Delicious after just an hour in the fridge

Awesome!!! I just made this salad, even though I didn't have all the ingredients.  I had frozen green beans, and frozen mixed vegs, onions, vinegar used olive oil, sugar, salt & crushed red pepper. Will make this again these ingredients I always have on hand.

There is too much dressing for amount of salad.  I also agree that frozen veggies would be better than can.  I could not find pimentos at the grocery store so subbed 1/2 fresh red peppers with roasted red peppers.

This was fantastic!  I really loved it. They only things I did differently were to use green onions, red pepper i/o pimento, and frozen peas i/o canned. It had only sat about 2 1/2 hours before we sat down to eat, but oh Yum!  Still great the next day. There was an awful lot of liquid after our first meal with it, so added a can of kidney beans. Still pretty liquedy the next day, but hey, that's why they invented slotted spoons!  I prefer this over regular 3 bean salads.  Maybe it's the combo of colorful veggies that make it so good, or a little different dressing than a 3 bean.  Great way to have a lot of veggies!  Thanks for this keeper.

Always looking for vegetable-based sides, and this fit the bill.  I used frozen (thawed or blanched) vegetables, and substituted mini-garbanzos (soaked overnight and cooked) for the corn (due to food sensitivity).  Otherwise, I used the recipe/directions as submitted.  I would reduce the amount of sugar next time, and maybe use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Thanks for posting, and giving us recipe-philes a starting point!

Awesome recipe Patsy! I used parboiled fresh veggies and added a diced roasted red pepper instead of the green pepper. (I roasted the red pepper on top of the burner on a gas stove and removed the blackened skin under cold running water.) I also heated the dressing in a sauce pan to dissolve the sugar. Yummy! A keeper.

This was really good!  It did remind me of the 4 bean salad that my mom used to make.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and fire-roasted red peppers instead of pimentos, because that is what I had.  Next time I'll cut back the dressing ingredients to about 2/3 because there is a lot more dressing than needed.
