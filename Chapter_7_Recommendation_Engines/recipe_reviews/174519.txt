I usually do not like recipes that begin with "already prepared" ingredients, but was in a hurry last night with soccer practice, etc. THIS WAS FABULOUS!
I didn't have fresh sage, so I used the dried, and used a generous amount of  it. The green onions on top add just the right fresh taste and crunch!
There was not a speck leftover, kids and adults alike ate it all gone! 
Will definitely make again!

This was good.. The pumpkin was a little strong, not as smooth as I thought. Could not taste the sage, and it seems like the proportions are off. Use your gut and adjust as needed with this one. I sauteed some scallops in olive oil and white wine to go with this.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. I absolutely love the combination of pumpkin and alfredo sauce. I never would have thought of it on my own, but it's delicious! However, I did not like the white wine part or the fresh sage. Here is how I will make it next time: Saute shallots and mushrooms in a bit of olive oil. When soft, add 3/4 cup pumpkin and alfredo sauce and heat through. Toss with freshly cooked pasta. I did add the mushrooms this time I made it and I liked that. I used Sam's Club Chicken and Four Cheese ravioli.  I like to use ravioli with meat filling when I am using pasta as a main dish. I did not like the shallots and white wine reduction. I didn't think it went well with the flavor of the sauce. And I really disliked the sage. It did not get soft at all, and we kept biting into chunks of sage. Not good eats. I don't think the sauce needs any flavors in addition to shallot and mushroom. I added extra pumpkin because I thought it could use more. Don't forget to thin the sauce with cooking liquid. I forgot this step and wondered why it was so gloppy! Oops! So, as written, I have to give this recipe 3 stars, but I am so glad I stumbled across it and I can't wait to try it again with these changes. Thanks Buitoni. (I love their filled pastas, too.)

I made a alfredo sauce from the website rather than purchasing pre-made sauce and I was still disappointed in the results.  It was lacking in flavor, and maybe needed more pumpkin, or spices or something.  For the work and the expense, I won't make this again.

This is a really great idea. Not quite enough pumpkin or sage for me as written, so I added a little more of each. I think this recipe could be fantastic with a homemade Alfredo where there is more room for preference adjustments. I served my sauce over mushroom ravioli and added toasted pecans. Thanks for the recipe!

The family loved this. I used Tortelliniâ€™s because I had them and I used a 4-cheese Alfredo for more flavor. I will make it again and chop the shallots much smaller.

I thought this was VERY good!  I was a little unsure at first taste off my finger, but once I got it on the pasta and dug in, it turned out to be delicious!  If you're a pumpkin lover, you will LOVE this!  Oh, and I didn't change a thing, made exactly as recipe says.

This was fabulous and a great way to eat pumpkin, which is so good for you!  My friend's two year old didn't like the "green stuff" in the sauce but the five year old loved that the sauce was orange.  I didn't think it was too bland, but next time I may add a little more sage just to make the taste stronger.  I served "Apple Avocado Salad with Tangerine Dressing" on the side.  This was beautiful, yummy and I will definitely make it again.

Talk about easy to make! I only used 1/2 C of the water in the sauce, I like a thicker sauce. Next time I would like to use fresh sage instead of ground. I am sure the flavor would be different. Otherwise, I really like this for a quick meal. Maybe I could try butternut squash instead of pumpkin for a different flavor profile.

I followed the exact recipe and found the balance of flavors to be perfect, as did my guests.  There is a nice marriage of flavors with no dominant taste, rather layers of taste.  While the pumpkin is gentle, that is the purpose.  If you want to clearly taste pumpkin, you could easily double the amount and then add more pasta water.  As is, it is a delicious, fun, and creative change to traditional pasta with a great fall color.

This was really good! I used whole wheat ravioli and light alfredo sauce to make it healthier. I didn't have any shallots so I used chopped onion instead. I think next time I will saute the onions in a little margarine first, they were a little too crunchy for me.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I used a bag of frozen whole-wheat raviolis (not the Buitoni refrigerated kind).  It came out great!  Has a nice mild flavor, which I think is a good thing because sometimes pumpkin can bit a bit overwhelming when it is a part of a main dish.  Also, I agree that the fresh sage makes all the difference!

This was great - I didn't have white wine so I used red wine vinegar and water - added a little kick! I also didn't have heavy cream so I used the other reviewers suggestion and used evaporated milk. I like pumpkin so I threw in an extra dab of it. It was really good!

I think the fresh sage made a HUGE difference in this dish.  It really gives it a great flavor.  This is a quick, easy, and delicious fall recipe.  The pumpkin was not overpowering at all.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. It was great for the fall with the pumpkin. We added a little Romano cheese on top just for added taste.

OMG, 1 word: AMAZING! I can't even describe how good this was! I even used jarred Bertolli Alfredo sauce and frozen stop & shop brand cheese ravioli. I can't imagine how good it would have been if I used the better "stuff"!  Oh, and FYI, I did not use the chopped green onions. I CANNOT wait to make this again! A definite keeper!

I think the pumpkin in this recipe makes this dish so yummy!  I've only ever made this with the regular four cheese ravioli, but make it lighter by buying the "light" four cheese ravioli".

The sauce is so great! This tasted like a 5 star meal at a restaurant. I stopped at my local italian deli & picked up lobster stuffed ravioli & made the sauce in October, was too die for! The ravioli were a bit large & the sauce is very rich so now I just use 1 or 2 lobster stuffed ravioli as a starter or app before a dinner- would serve this meal to guests!

This was delicious. It was not to strong in pumpkin flavor so I could serve it to my fiance ( who thinks he hates pumpkin) I made it with with homemade pumpkin ricotta ravioli, a recipe on this site and they went great together. Unfortunately the ravioli was way to time consuming and I will probably not make them again but the sauce I will definitely be making it again.

The original recipe seemed to be lacking a bit so I added in a few more ingredients:   I used canned squash instead of pumpkin 3 tbsp brown sugar some ground pepper 1 tsp Cinnamon plus (Pampered Chef brand, but allspice works as well)  This turned out great and will be added to my permanent recipe box!

Yummy. I thought I could have used more pumpkin though. I substituted apple cider for the wine and it turned out great.

Delicious, very quick and easy - perfect for dinner after a long work day.  I used the Light Alfredo Sauce and thought that worked well.  I served this with a "salad in a bag".  My family loved it.

I thought this was just ok, I added spices and it still tasted not like a restaurant, but will work if you want to have a pumpkin ravioli that is ok.

I made this sauce last night with some tortellini...it was a huge success!  Loved the sauce and so did the other 3 people eating it.

This was even better than I anticipated.  The pumpkin flavor was mild and I really enjoyed the fresh sage flavor.  The wine smelled horrible while cooking with the shallots, but it did add great taste to the dish.  (That smell was gone once the pumpkin was added.)  I topped this dish off with some sauteed onions and shrimp and some fresh tomatoes.  I think it would be great with some freshly shredded parmesan cheese.

Very good, my husband wanted seconds!.. I didn't buy shllots because I didn't want to go to the store...  I used white onion and it was tasty; also used about 2 tsp. of rubbed sage instead of fresh.    We skipped the green onions on top because of preference!  Yummy!

I only added about 1/2 cup of water also.  And as that I am not a huge pumpkin fan I thought the slight hint of pumpkin wonderful.  There was not a drop left!  Even the 2 year old ate it!  It would get 5 stars if some tweaking was done to add a more complex layer of flavors, such as makng your own sauce.

Very tasty! I used light alfredo sauce and a splash more wine at the end.

As written it gets a 4 star. If you use your own homemade alfredo sauce it gets five stars. Fresh is always best.
This tastes really good and perfect for a fall evening meal. Of course, the purchased sauce does make this easier, but I go for taste usually instead of ease. With the pre-prepared sauce, this is a very quick, festive and good tasting meal.
