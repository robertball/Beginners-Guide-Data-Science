What a great way to prepare lamb. Quick, easy and delicious. I didn't have any tomato sauce so instead I substituted two 14.5 oz cans of Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes for the Tomato Sauce and Water and it turned out great. I served it with rice pilaf.

We wanted to give this one ten stars! I used 2 cans of tomatoes and a can of beef stock instead of water, which gave it almost a stew consistency. I had mine over brown rice, but hubby and son ladeled it into bowls with the Light Wheat Rolls from this site. Fresh mint (out of the yard, since we had it) was the key. Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe is very easy to make and very delicious too!  The only thing I would suggest is to adjust the amount of green beans to your own liking.  Thanks for a new quick meal!

I used london broil instead of lamb and it was wonderful.  
It was served over rice and we tried it over egg noodles.  Both were very tasty.

I needed a different idea for dinner - and used this one!  I used my slow cooker - on high for the first 2 hours - then on low for another 3.  Regarding the ingredients:  I added 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, and 1/3 cup ruby port.  I added lots of dried mint, Herbs de Provence, and a little sugar.  I did brown the onion and meat -  and used about 2 cups of French cut frozen green beans - came out just fantastic - will use again and again!!!  For us - this dish must be served with warm, crusty bread!!!  Melt in your mouth comfort food - great for our 12 degree night here!

We really liked this recipe. I read all the reviews and ended up using 2 cans of diced tomatoes (seasoned w/ garlic & basil)in place of the tomato sauce, and 1 C. of beef stock in place of the water. Also, I used frozen green beans because I had those on hand. It turned out delicious... kind of a "stoup" as Rachel Ray would say... a cross between a stew and a soup. I served this w/ couscous... very yummy! Next time I think I'd serve some Feta cheese on the side to sprinkle on top... oh, and don't leave out the mint. It makes the dish (IMO) :)

So delicious! I followed other reviewer suggestions and made a few changes... more meat (2 lbs), fewer beans (1 lb), and use stewed tomatoes (2 cans, replacing the tomato sauce and water). It was delicious served over quinoa, and very healthy!

This dish was a favorite at my Lebanese grandmas. I would add 2 cans of tomato sauce, 3/4 T cinnamon. 
1 t  allspice, juice of 1/2 lemon.  The dish is served over rice. With these changes, you will definetly taste the wonderful flavor of the lamb, and the amount of green beans will make sense.

My mother gave this 4 stars, my father gave it 3 and I gave it 5 - so I'll settle on 4.  :)  I thought it was delicious, but I used lamb stew meat that was on the bone and it wasn't nearly enough meat.  Next time I'd search until I found boneless lamb stew meat.  Very tasty dish!!

Excellent recipe! I used some lamb ribs I had plus almost a cup of fresh mint! I've never used mint in stew before and I'll always remember to use it from now on! The flavor is wonderful with a tbs of lemon juice right before the stew started to simmer.

I could not find lamb stew meat anywhere.  I ended up buying a leg of lamb, cutting it off the bone, and freezing half of it.  I threw all of the ingredients into the crock pot and cooked it on low all day.  I added a handful of raisins (very yummy!)and served it as a soup with crusty bread and lemon, feta, and mint for topping.  My real complaint is that the lamb was dry....but that's probably because I had to use leg of lamb...

This was my first time cooking lamb. My husband and I both really liked this dish. I used soy beans instead of green beans. Quick, easy and yummy!!!

I thought this dish was delicious!  I used cubed beef tenderloin, and addedd a large jar of sliced mushrooms.  I served it over whole grain penne pasta so that the sauce was retained in the hollow centers.  It all tasted even better the next day!

I used left over leg of lamb, cut up in cubes.  I then added a can of tomatoes with jalepeno peppers and a can of beef broth and a can of drained green beans.  I let it all simmer together for about 1/2 hour.  I then served it over noodles.  It was delicious.

Wouldn't change a thing. It was absolutely delicious. Even my fussy teenage daughter loved it. It so reminded me of the green beans in tomato sauce I use to get at a wonderful Lebanese Deli I would go to for lunch when I worked in California. Finally I can make it myself. I would add a tiny bit more mint to it though.

Although I followed the recipe to the letter, it just didn't taste as good as I thought it would. There were far too many beans and it was very watery. It was easy too make but tasted somewhat bland. My husband and I both decided this would not remain in the recipe box.

Not being a big fan of lamb, I decided to try this recipe and was very pleased with the mild and comforting flavors.  Thanks!

Really simple and delicious.  I was a little confused about whether it was a stew or a soup or just something whose broth you disregard when serving, but however you choose to serve it, it is scrumptious.

I just happened to have 1 1/2 lbs. of left over lamb leg in the freezer, so this worked out perfectly. I did sub stewed tomatoes as others suggested. I also added about 4 oz. sliced mushrooms along with the beans. Great recipe. Thanks Liz.
