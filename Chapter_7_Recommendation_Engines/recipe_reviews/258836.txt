I love this recipe! A good, basic one to build on. The only things I did differently was to substitute 1Tbsp of sesame oil for the olive oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds once finished. Yummy!

Good.  Just found them to be a "little" too oily.  Will try 1/2 the olive oil next time.

I reduced cook time due to personal preference (I like them crunchy) but other than that this is perfect as written.
