My family really enjoyed this recipe, however I did only use a half a stick of butter instead of a whole.

This was an easy and delicious side dish.  I used half the amount of butter.  Also, I sautéed the onion until soft, then added the other vegetables and quickly sautéed them until al dente.  It’s a wonderful dish.

This is fantastic and a crowd pleaser! Way too much butter though. I cut the butter to about one tablespoon and it was plenty. I usually serve this with my enchilada's. It's a nice compliment. Enjoy!

1-12-2016 ~Prepare this using the ingredients in proportions that appeal to you and this is really, really good.  For me that meant not measuring and just relying on what looked right to me - less butter, less corn (made it easier for Hubs to pick out and push aside given his sensitive innards) and more olives.  For a recipe scaled to three servings I was to add just two olives, so I wasn't overdoing it when I added more than that!  I did use the amount of Cajun seasoning called for and I found I actually could have used more (Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning).  Hubs is not a big fan of zucchini but he did enjoy this - nothing wrong with straight zucchini as far as I'm concerned but the embellishment beyond the plain and simple made the difference for him.  It looks kind of pretty too, colorful and inviting.

I had  4 small zucchini, in my fridge, I didn't know what to do with them.  I made a spaghetti and meatball dinner, for myself and decided that this as a side dish would be great since I had all the ingredients. I was too lazy to saute , so I sliced, the zucchini and the red, onions and chopped the garlic and everything else and layered it into a glass baking dish, and drizzled it with a little olive oil and dotted it with 2 tbs. of butter. (I used frozen corn, by the way). I didn't feel like  getting my Cajun seasoning, so I just sprinkled it with a little salt and pepper. I covered the dish with parchment paper and sealed it with tin foil. This smelled so wonderful baking in a 375 degree oven for 40 minutes.  The taste was even better, it was great with my meatballs and spaghetti! I was never a big fan of zucchini, but  I will be making, this dish often. The lazy girl that I am, will always bake it !

Easy with a good amount of flavour.  Don't saute too long or corn may go mushy.

Zucchini and onion sizes vary, so that could have a bearing on how it turns out.  We thought the garlic was a little too strong.  Perhaps a larger zucchini would have helped.  As others suggested, we used only 1-1/2 Tbsp butter.

The whole family like it a lot. I used less then half of the butter. I used just enough to saute the onion and zucchini. After adding the corn I added some left over white rice and heated it through. Then I topped it off with some shredded parmigiana cheese.  I will defiantly make this again.

Very good.I used all the butter it called for but I will not use as much next time.  I also put more of the seasoning than it called for.  I didn't have olives but I put black beans in it.  Yummy

My husband and I enjoyed this very much. Naturally I didn't have all the ingredients but I was able to modify it with great success. I used zucchini and yellow crookneck squash, kalamata olives in place of regular black olives, frozen corn instead of canned and Old Bay spice, as I didn't have any Cajun spice. I also cut the butter in half as you can always add more if needed. Definitely a keeper!

This sounded interesting, but didn't taste all that great. We felt the various flavors didn't meld well.

I used a green & yellow zucchini as well as some red pepper I wanted to use up. Other than that I cooked as directed. After cooking I felt it needed just a bit of flavour so I sprinkled on some season salt. This was delicious and I could make a meal of just this dish. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

I loved it and will be making it again many times!!  I didn't have the Cajun seasoning but used a sprinkling of Cayenne pepper instead.  I will get some Cajun seasoning before making it again.  Usually, when someone gave me Zucchini, I would make bread or a cake.   I like eating it this way much better!

A great veggie/ side recipe! I omitted the olives and used half the butter. Came out delicious. I have made it twice, once with canned corn and the other time with frozen corn. Great either way!

I plan to play with our favorite seasonings.  This time we did not add Cajun seasoning.  I had company and got distracted and forgot to add seasonings.   We also used 1/2 stick butter instead of a whole.  I will try 3/4 next time for a little more butter flavor.  i 'd like to add more olives, and maybe some fresh lime juice.  We will definitely make it again.

I had some garden zucchini left over and this was perfect. Thanks for sharing. I added some Johnny's garlic seasoning to this, yum, the whole family likes it. Thanks.
