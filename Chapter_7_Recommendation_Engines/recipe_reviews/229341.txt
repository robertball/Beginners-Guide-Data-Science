I am on the fence about this cookie, it is so cake like it almost isn't a cookie. They don't hold together well you need to serve them with a plate or napkin because they are crumbly and do fall apart. They are light and moist even 2 days later they are still nice and soft. They are a tasty cookie and everyone enjoyed them, still I am not sure I would ever make this cookie again.

I think these were excellent. They were soft almost cakey. My husband took to calling them muffin tops because they were a little crunchy on the outside but like cake inside. I made a few changes to this recipe:

1. I used canola oil instead of butter because I never bake with butter for health reasons
2. I put raisins instead of nuts
3. I left out the orange zest because I didn't have an orange at hand only orange juice. Next time I would make it with the zest.

Wonderful and moist. I used some coconut oil and greek yogurt in place of butter. My advice would be don't be shy with the zest and juice- it really makes these cookies shine and doesn't taste odd like I was afraid it would. I only had a small orange so I made some cookies plain and they were drier and didn't set as well. Great recipe.

The way to make these not be so crumbly is to put a whole egg in them instead of only the white and beating it. I added a whole egg after beating the butter and sugar together and they came out beautifully. They are not crumbly at all.

These were delicious. The only issue I had was the very cake-like consistency of them. They fell apart very easily, but everyone still liked them a lot.
