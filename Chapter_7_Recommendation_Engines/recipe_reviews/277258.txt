Made as written originally but then ended up adding more worcestershire and hot sauce. This is one that gets better as it sits so I recommend making it a day ahead of time.  This had really good flavor but as I was eating it I said to myself that it could use some chives. Chives are not listed in the ingredient list and it wasn't until just now that I saw the part about garnishing with chives up in the recipe description. I will definitely make this again and will be adding the chives.
