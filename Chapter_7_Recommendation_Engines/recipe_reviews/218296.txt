Pretty good sauce. I didn't have pina colada so I used a little coconut extract and a little extra sugar and pineapple. Used with some frozen breaded shrimp.

This was pretty good! It's very sweet -- my kids kept saying "It tastes like ice cream!" -- but it's perfect for a summer BBQ. Since my family won't eat shrimp I pan-seared some chunks of chicken seasoned with a little garlic salt and pepper. I served it with brown rice and a green salad making a lovely light meal on a hot summer day!

I thought this was VERY good!!! I sliced about 1/2 inch deep down one side of a pineapple (top to bottom) and scooped out the insides then used the scooped out pineapple as a serving bowl for this sauce. I served this with coconut shrimp on platter...the presentation was lovely!

I didn't know how to rate this really because I had to variate greatly from the recipe. I just used this recipe as a guide and used what I had in the pantry. Instead of pina colada mix I used sweetened condensed milk. I omitted the sugar. I used reduced fat sour cream. Lastly I squeezed the juice from one fresh lime in and viola!!! it was GREAT!

Wonderful! I used half sour cream half Greek yogurt. "Skinny" pi√±a colada. No extra sugar. Oh and one of those tiny 3" mangos finely chopped. Just great!

I made it exactly to the recipe like I always do the first time I make a new recipe and it was just what I was looking for it was a little more thin then I thought it would be. I will get a thicker sour cream next time I m sure that was it because I had not added the pineapple yet.
