This marinade is sweet, tangy, and absolutely delicious!  If you like balsamic vinegar you'll love this one.  I did this on 4 boneless chicken breasts pounded thin.  I added 1 Tbsp. of jarred minced garlic, 2 Tbsp. of honey, 1 Tbsp. of dijon mustard, and a little chopped fresh parsley.  I let it marinate all day and these were so tender you could cut them with a fork!

I used this marinade for portabello caps and it was delicious!  In addition, I used just a pinch each of dried basil, rosemary and cilantro and TONS of fresh garlic.  I marinated for about three hours and then covered with foil and broiled for about half an hour.  Next time I will marinade for less time (they were a bit too strong).  This was the vegetarian/vegan alternative to burgers and was a huge hit.  Served with roasted red peppers, pepper jack cheese, sprouts, avacado and the "typical" burger garnishes.

One word: SCRUMPTIOUS!  Can I just say that I will never use another marinade as long as I live?!  If you love balsamic vinegar, as I do, then you MUST try this marinade.  It makes your meat burst with the flavor but without the acidic burn.  I marinated my top sirloin chunks for 24 hours and OMG they were to die for!  When you try this, make sure all parts of your meat have a chance to soak in the vinegar and don't be alarmed when it turns almost black.  I can't say enough good things about this marinade...it is the BOMB!

Wonderful marinade.  My husband remarked about how much he liked this and really wants me to make it again.  i used with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  The meat marinaded about 4 hours and came out tender, juicy and with lots of flavor.  I froze the remaining marinade with more chicken breasts for future use.

This was really good and easy! I would say that if you don't like the flavor of sauerbraten, you probably won't like this, but my husband and I loved it.

Delicious marinade for balsamic lovers! I skipped the onions and added a clove of minced garlic and fresh grated ginger. I put this over chicken and let it marinade for 4 hours and it was delicious!! I will definitly make it again, but the only mistake I made is that I pounded out the chicken before I marinaded it and it fell apart when I grilled it, but it was still yummy!

I liked the sweetness but I think the balsamic was very overpowering.  Next time I might cut back on the vinegar.

I loved this with pork chops which are not my best meat to cook, I fail too often but not with this.

And when I don't marinade I just fry then simmer in this!

This is great...I added a couple of mashed garlic cloves and used it with pork chops.    I am trying it today and adding a bit of Dijon mustard.  Gave the chops a good flavor but not overpowering.

This is really good. I used it to marinate chicken breast . The only change I made was that I used minced garlic instead of onion.  The chicken was moist, sweet and tangy. I will definitely use this marinade again.

This was just ok. I like the idea that there is no salt in the recipe because my husband has high blood pressure. I used the 2 Tbs of brown sugar, but it tasted like I added none. Added more brown sugar, still nothing. The balsamic overpowered the whole thing. will not make again.

Very good and SWEET!  A little too sweet, but I should've known than from the title.  I used it on a flank steak I bbq'd and it was very tender and flavorful.

I tried this marinade on chicken, it was really good. I think the brown sugar really makes the difference. I will definitely use this again.  I cut up the  chicken in bite size pieces and cooked on the stove top. I did not like  how the chicken looked, because the balsamic turns it brown.  Other than thought it was great.

Wonderful and sweet. Bingbangboom its done and the results were wonderful with boneless chicken. I could really take this recipe and do nice things with it. I can imagine garlic, herbs, pineapple, papaya, even mushrooms accompanied. Not carb friendly.

My whole family loved this marinade! I put boneless chicken in the marinade for about 1-1/2 hours and then grilled it. The only thing different that I did was use canola oil instead of olive oil, but it still tasted amazing!  The sugar really does add that extra touch.

My entire family loves this recipe w/pork roast.   I usually add a bit more brown sugar, but there are never any leftovers!
My father-in-law would prefer this over Thanksgiving turkey (and always uses the extra sauce as an excuse to consumer more rolls!).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had high hopes for this marinade, but my girlfriend and I were very disappointed. I used it to marinade chicken breast. The only thing I could taste on the end result was vinegar.

Used it on chicken breasts and only marinated about 2 hours.  Very delicious....my husband thought it tasted like liver?!?!  But, I guess this is a compliment because he loves liver.  Will definitely make over and over again.

This recipe is wonderful!  I had 10 people over and they were amazed.  No extra sauces were needed on the chicken!  It went very well with wild rice and vegetables  Thank you

Outstanding marinade.  I don't know if I got lucky wiht a great flank or this marinade but this was THE BEST flank steak I have ever made.  My husband was still talking about it the next day!  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

This was very easy and tasty, my husband is an extremely picky eater but he loved this! I used it to marinate my chicken for our block party and everyone wanted the recipe.

I wanted a teriyaki sauce, but was out of soy sauce, so I tried this one as an alternative. It was nice and simple and very good, but VERY TANGY. I doubled the brown sugar, which helped. Next time, I'll try adding honey along with the brown sugar. I also added garlic and ginger, for personal preference, but it didn't "need" any additions.

Only added more onion to use up a piece of onion in the frig.  I thought it was too vinegar tasting but my husband liked it.

This is really good with pork chops seared in an iron skillet.  It was not as good with pork chops on the grill.  For whatever reason, the sugars caramelized better with searing than when grilling.

This was quite good. I used it on chicken breasts and added some dried cherries toward the end--very tasty!

It was quite tasty, the balsamic taste sunk into the chicken very well. I also added a little garlic salt.

Not very impressed with this I was expecting something with a little more kick. It was lacking something.

My chicken was marinated for 8 hours and I baked it.  I was excited since I love balsamic vinegar.  However, this recipe was bland, dry, and "blah."  Perhaps I cooked it too long or didn't add enough pepper.  It needed some salt.  Maybe next time...
