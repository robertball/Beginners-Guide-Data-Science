I added oregano to the dish for more flavor and used chopped walnuts instead of sunflowers. It was pretty good! I would serve it next time with rice or potatoes.

So easy and delicious. Loved how the melted cheese and tomatoes made a nice gooey sauce in the bottom of the pan. Kyle send more recipes like this!

This recipe was a hit with my family. My husband and I are low carbin it but we also have 2 boys to cook for. This recipe kept us on our diet but also please picky 2 and 6 year old boys. My husband simply said Kyle knows his chicken!!! Gave 4 stars because I thought the tomato was a little over powering that's okay though next time I'll use a little less.

I did not care for this recipe. I found it very bland like it was just missing something.

02-04-16 Simple way to prepare chicken. We thought the chicken needed a little more flavor then just the s/p and lemon juice. I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned and my cheese will co-jack as that is what I had open. We enjoyed the chicken served with a toss salad.

So good! I made it exactly as written. These are not ingredients that I would have thought to put together but they really work well. My favorite part was the sunflower seeds - they add such an amazing nutty flavor. The only thing I'd suggest is maybe marinating the chicken in the lemon mixture a few hours ahead of time since I thought the chicken could use a bit more flavor. Garlic powder would be a nice addition here. You could also used seasoned diced tomatoes to add even more flavor. I'll be making this one again and again. Thanks Kyle!
