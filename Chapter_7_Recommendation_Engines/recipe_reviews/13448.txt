Awesome soup I bowled potatos in chicken stock instead of water... used real cheddar cheese shredded about 2 cups and also 4 cups milk and 2 cups non fat cream with 3 tablespoons sour cream... thicker,richer! But still excellent base recipe

Everyone I have fed this soup to really love it and it really is easy to make. Kids seem to really love it. I make this at a middle school I work at and the kids really eat it up.

this was a great base recipe. my husband doesn't care for carrots or celery, so i added extra potatoes, garlic and onion. to give it a little  more flavour i used roasted garlic potato flakes. it was a huge hit!

Pretty good, not the best cheesy potato soup I have ever eaten.  It was missing something.  
Well worth if for the little effort required.

I increased this recipe from 8 to 12 servings and ended up with a LOT of soup.  And that's fine--I'm a soup maniac.  This wasn't quite as good as another potato soup recipe I tried from this website, but was still excellent.  I used this recipe to inaugurate my new food processor, which works great.  If you still don't have one, consider buying one!  It sure beats chopping all those vegetables when you are in a hurry!  I picked this recipe because I had all of the ingredients without a trip to the store.  Without any added spice to speak of, I expected a soup that was a little bland.  Surprisingly, it was very tasty.  Thanks for the submission!

This was very good. I did some add in's, and adjustments. I used smoke sausage instead of bacon. velveeta jalapeno cheese sauce instead of slices cheese, and a can of Ro-tel for a bit of spice.

Very good and easy! I used real bacon bits and skim milk but other than that...followed the recipe exactly. This makes a lot so I ended up adding extra potatoes (boiled on the side) because I wanted it hardier. Loved it and so did my neighbors!

I and my family loved it.  I changed it up a bit.  I just boiled the veggies covered in water until tender.  then added the milk and simmered.  I added velveta cheese and then the dried potato flakes.  I also added grilled cut up chicken strips to the soup.  The potato flakes add to the the thickness and they were garlic herb flavored so added to the flavor.  Extremely yummy and perfect for cold winter nights.  tomorrow night i will put the remainder of the soup in to a pie crust for a delicious cheesy potato chicken pot pie.  Thanks for the original recipe.  Chow

This was an easy soup and very tasty using chicken stock instead of water to boil the potatoes is a very easy way to season the soup. I omit the carrots.

This soup is awesome, but I ususally leave out the potato flakes anymore.  they never really disolve or whatever all the way so they look like floaties in your soup.

This is a good base recipe, and by base I mean bland.  For my taste, I need a little Tony Chachere's, garlic, mushrooms etc.  Then it is a great recipe

Outstanding!!!  I broke it up into 2 cup servings and froze a good portion of it!  I added some left over ham and it was fabulous.  Thank you so much.  By the way it was snowing the day I made it and it made for a perfect day.

This tasted so good and my family loved it 
I didn't use pork though and it turned out just fine. I also added extra cheese
