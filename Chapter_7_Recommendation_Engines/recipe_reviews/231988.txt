Wonderful! Tip:Don't discard the skins!! Prepare them as potato skins, add cheese and bacon and flash freeze them, then seal them in portion sizes freezer bags for an easy homemade potato skin appetizer later! Just put frozen potato skins in preheated oven at 350 for 10-15mins.
Now about the Casserole! It's wonderful! Followed exactly except I added seasoned salt instead of regular salt and tripled the recipe. By tripling the recipe I have plenty to put in the pan for the casserole as well as extra potatoe stuffing to put back into my potatoe skins to freeze for last as twice baked potatoes. Love the versatility of this recipe and being able to use up all of my potatoes

This recipe has all the ingredients of a rich and creamy, flavorful twice-baked potato dish.  Unfortunately, the measurements are way off.  It calls for 1/2 lb bacon and 3/4 c. cheese for 2 potatoes...then to top with another 3/4 c. cheese...Holy Mother of God!  Would you like some potato to go with that cheese and bacon?  And those must be some massive potatoes, to fill a 9x13 pan...I couldn't find those, my supermarket only sells potato-sized potatoes. Nevertheless, I went ahead and tried the recipe as written, and while I stuck to the original ingredients, I ended up abandoning the recipe and  finishing by taste, texture and consistency.  The casserole turned out great, however since I walked away from the measurements, it's pointless to say so.  The main reason for my review then, is to share this:  it occurred to me as I made this casserole that I was very close to duplicating (in ingredients and process), a similar and much-loved recipe from this site:  Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes By Dannon Oikos.  I make this recipe frequently, and the only reason I wasn't making it this time, is that I'm always looking for the next best thing.  It's the best Twice Baked Potato recipe I've found. The ingredients are almost identical to this recipe, and you could simply spread the filling in a casserole dish rather than putting it back into the potato skins.  If you like the like the look of this recipe, try the Ultimate TBP recipe...the measurements are spot on with amazing flavor.

I made it a bit easier.  I used instant potatoes (made according to package) and didn't use sour cream (didn't have any on hand) or milk,  instead I used half and half.  I also topped it with 1tbs of bacon bits and parsley.

Grew up with this recipe with a couple of alterations. I use sharp cheddar & half and half. Also, cut the baked potatoes in half lengthwise and SAVE them. I make a large casserole of this using 6-8 potatoes and increase the rest of the ingredients proportionally. 5-10 minutes before the casserole is ready, put all the skins in the oven (on a baking sheet or even just on the oven rack) to warm them. Serve in a bowl so that guests may fill the skins with the casserole. I have family who always want to fill skins and much prefer it that way!

I made this for Easter dinner and had 15 people.  I boiled and mashed the potatoes. EVERYONE LOVED IT!  I actually prepared it the day before and then covered and baked for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was delicious!  I actually have several people asking for the recipe.  I will definitely be making them again.

My roommate picked this recipe to make for some friends of ours. We made it to serve 12 instead of 4 and ended up using an entire 4oz package of organic 'living' chives, and it was a complete hit! Everyone LOVED it, and we're definitely keeping this recipe to use again! My only regret is not having taken a picture of them. :)

We enjoyed this dish but there's something really wrong with the proportions given. I doubled the amount of potatoes, did not double the remaining ingredients, and it came out just right and fit perfectly into a 7x11 baking dish, about half the size of a 9x13. I don't understand how anyone could stretch two mashed potatoes to fit into a 9x13 dish. Other than that, everyone liked it. I did use sliced green onions in place of dried chives.

Why in the world would anyone that considers themselves a cook use instant potatoes and bacon bits?  Follow the recipe and you will be pleased with the result.

Tasty casserole. I didn't use any dried chives on top and instead of baking the potatoes I just boiled them then mashed them. Brought this for Sunday dinner after church and it was a hit.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I plan to. I don't have to make to advise people that there is a total difference in the flavor of a baked potato over instant and even mashed potatoes. I would much prefer people would first review the actual recipe then any adaptations they have used.

This was a yummy dish!  Just right for the steak meal we planned.  I followed the directions as written,, but it could easily be adapted with other spices.  Next time I think I will add some sauteed onions to the potato mixture.  Definitely a 5 star recipe.

This has become a favorite in my family. Especially popular side served at steak cook-outs. An easy make ahead dish. Try roasting some garlic while baking the potatoes. Squeeze out 1 or two cloves into the potato mixture. We also like thinly sliced fresh scallions in place of chives.

Flavorful, rich potato dish with these changes:  for a 9x13 pan I used 5 lbs. of potatoes, 1 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup milk,  about 2 1/2 cups Cheddar, 1/3 cup melted butter and the seasonings adjusted accordingly.  Mashed everything well with a potato masher, but left it a little chunky, not smooth.  This makes a generous amount, as you can imagine with the amount of potatoes, just right for a holiday potluck.

Great recipe! I've read some reviews about throwing away the potato skins :(  This simple change to the recipe is for all of the potato skin lovers who hate to throw away those delicious skins. I have made a recipe like this many times, However, I use the potato skins.  Bake potato as directed. Cut the cooled baked potato in half lengthwise, scoop out the flesh, saving the skin (set aside).  Mix the ingredients as directed.   Scoop the potato mixture back into the saved skins.  Put the stuffed potatoes into an appropriate sized baking dish.  Bake  for 20 min. or until cheese is melted.

I have a question for those who made this dish.  Did you use a 9 x 13 dish?  This does not seem to be enough food for a 9 x 13 pan

Yummy! I guess the potatoes called for in the recipe would be like those huge ones you get at McAllister's Deli. I used 5 of the largest potatoes I found in the bag I bought. It wasn't enough potato for a 9X13 pan. I did use the same amount of all the other ingredients and it came out great.

I made this tonight and it was so good! I had to increase the recipe to serve more people. The only other changes I made were to boil potatoes rather than baking them. And I used precooked real bacon pieces, because that's what I had. It was a huge hit; they ate the whole pan! Thanks for a great recipe :-)

I invented this years ago because my husband does not like baked potatoes because of the peel, all the peel has to be removed before he will eat it.  This recipe has never failed to please any crowd.

i made this as an alternative to mashed potatoes. To say it simply they were an absolute smash hit! The only changes were extra bacon for the meat lovers and extra garlic. I did in the name of time boil the potatoes rather than bake them but nevertheless it turned out fantastic. In the words of two guests it was the best mashed potatoes we have ever had!

The amount of potatoes to the amount of other ingredients is way off. You need at least 4-6 baking potatoes for the rest of the ingredients. Heck, use 6 potatatoes, lb. bacon, etc, and put in 9x13 pan.  Don't get me wrong, putting the ingredients in a pan instead of the skin isn't a bad idea but the amount of ingredients needs to work together and this recipe doesn't. I'll use the twice baked potato recipe I have and put it in a casserole dish next time I make it because the ingredient list works together for a very tasty dish.

This was pretty amazing.I used 3 russets and didn't come anywhere near being able to fill the 2 Qt. casserole dish I used more or less a 9x13 dish. I also used fresh scallions in place of the dried chives. I just used my sous chef Mike for the potatoes because who wants to wait an hour just to start this delicious meal (side really. This will go great with a grilled steak). I wish I had more potatoes so there could have been more of this to eat. Next time I will definitely have way more potatoes and probably double everything else.

These potatoes are delicious, I will definitely make these again, they are a nice treat! I served them with Tri-trip steak, and had zero left over! I did double the recipe, using 5 lbs. of potatoes, and doubling all the other ingredients, with exception of bacon, you could still one 1/2 to 3/4's lb. of bacon. I do recommend baking the potatoes, versus boiling as some reviewers suggested, as this gives you the true"twice baked" flavor. After removing the potatoes from their skins, I did mash the potatoes some before adding the other ingredients.

So far, I've made this twice! My family of seven LOVE it. The only adjustment I've made on it is to add a pound of ground turkey, and it's a meal in and of itself! I season the turkey as it is cooking with seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and parsley, and it's wonderful!! Definitely on our menu for future dinners!

This recipe was OMG delicious. So easy to make. I made It early enough to bake the potatoes and let them cool then just before dinner put it in the oven at 350 for 15 min. This will definitely be made again and again.

Love it!!! I get requests for my stuffed baked spuds by family and extended family a lot.  They are good but time consuming.  This is the answer!!  Will use fresh chives or green onions.

Yummy!  Like everyone else, I cut the prep time way down and made it way easier by boiling my potatoes.  I also omitted the dried chives and used fresh ones on top.  And I substituted garlic powder and salt for garlic salt.  Just minor changes.  Took this to a dinner with friends and they cleaned out the dish -- will definitely make it again!

I love this recipe but I use instant potatoes and it works just as well.  Also remove it from the oven during the last 10 minutes and add some chunks of Velveeta Cheese to the top and then finish baking.

This is super tasty. I used 6 potatoes (2 lbs). They have to be unusually large potatoes for just 2 to fill that size casserole. I also feel fresh chives and garlic are better for this recipe. For those reasons I gave this 4 stars. With the fresh ingredients and proper amount of potatoes and some added crispy skin, it is definitely 5 stars! Changes I made: I ended up using 2 lbs of yukon gold potatoes  (about 6) 1 tablespoon freshly chopped chives, and 2 cups shredded cheddar with the remaining ingredient amounts as written and this filled an 11"x7" casserole dish nicely. I also replaced the garlic powder by combining 1/2 teaspoon freshly minced garlic with 2 tablespoons butter and microwaving that for a minute until the butter is melted and the garlic is softened and added that to the potato mixture. For added flavor & texture, I chopped up about 1/2 of the crispy potato skins and mixed those into the potato mixture. It was a great addition!

Extremely good!  I used 5 Russet potatoes, nuked them first for 15 minutes to reduce the oven time.  Saved the skins for tomorrow's dinner and followed the rest of the recipe.  Good Recipe which reminded me of twice baked potatoes from years gone by....or bye, bye!

These were the first mashed potatoes I've ever made and my guests said they were the best mashed potatoes they'd ever had!  I put all ingredients (except cheese) in the mixer and it was the perfect consistency and perfect flavor.

Big hit today at a family brunch! 2 potatoes is simply not enough, I used 5 potatoes and doubled everything and still used a 9x13 pan with no issues size wise. Creamy double baked goodness. I’ve been told I need to make it again for Christmas.

The twice baked potato casserole came out perfectly. I suggest using only 1/2 the bacon. I also suggest that you use the bacon grease left over from cooking the bacon and the skin of the potato and make potato chips out of it. I would highly suggest making it and I would make it again.

I have another family favorite. I was looking for something different so as not to have the same old potatoes and this turned out great. I make my own bacon bits with applewood smoked bacon. Delicious

Twice baked potatoes are a favorite at my house, so this was too. What a great idea, and super easy. I baked my potatoes in the microwave and then baked the casserole for 10 minutes. Made the process much quicker and was still delicious!

I finally tried this recipe tonight, to serve with a small boneless ham -- it sounded good, and I figured with a little tweaking after the initial trial I would have a keeper.  I was totally wrong... no tweaking needed here, other than I used 6 smaller russet potatoes from my garden and baked it in an 8x8 casserole, which seemed like the perfect size for the amount of potato mixture.  Although I understand the reviews that mention saving the skins, or stuffing the mixture back into the skins instead of a casserole (because I love baked potato skins), the real beauty of this recipe for me is that you don't need the big, beautiful, more expensive baking potatoes -- use smaller, less perfect potatoes, cut in half, scoop out the potato, discard the skins (or add them to the compost pile, if you have one), and still enjoy the loaded twice-baked potato experience.  And if you do want to make real twice-baked potatoes, in the skins, go ahead and do that.  Love this recipe, Tay -- thanks for sharing!!

Heaven.  
i used 8 small potatoes & baked them earlier in the day, left the rest of the amounts alone but used ~ 6 oz bacon because that was in the fridge.  Left the green onions off about 1/4 of the pan for Conner,  Used 2 handfuls of shredded medium cheddar for each 3/4 cup.  baking at 350 for 25 min.

The dish was very delicious. Instead of using milk I used evaporated milk and cayenne pepper. Next time I will boil the potatoes instead of baking them. Thanks for the outstanding recipe.

IF YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR A FUNCTION DOUBLE THE RECIPE!!!!
Great tasting side, everyone LOVED it.
The problem was, it didn't come close to filling my 9x13 pan. I made this for a family dinner and had to rush like a crazy person to double the recipe in order to have an actually full casserole dish.
And yes, I followed the instructions to a T.
The amount was perfect for a 9x9 square pan.

This was a great casserole, and it got rave reviews from the fam! I did make a few changes, I used more bacon (6 slices I think), halved the sour cream, and added cheese on top before it went in the oven. This is a keeper!!

The concept is great, but I'm not sure why it's written for only 2 potatoes and 9x13 pan.  It would be VERY shallow. I put it in a 9x13 and it hardly covered the bottom.  I used 4 potatoes and put it in an 9x9 dish and it worked great! I substituted the sour cream with Greek yogurt and it also turned out well!  Either way, I'm happy this was posted, but some things needed changed.

We've made this at least five times for dinners as our go-to mashed potato dish.  Depending on the size of the potatoes, I might add a little extra milk for some extra creaminess.  We also place half of the bacon in the dish and add some garlic powder for added flavor.  We've always gotten rave reviews on it.

This recipe tastes great. Anyway, if you add a dose of common sense and use 2 or 3 *more* potatoes OR less cheese and bacon, it works out fine. (Keeping other ingredients like sour cream, milk, butter, spices, as listed.) This is also an awesome way to use up leftover mashed potatoes!  Substitute the baking potatoes for about 3-4 cups of mashed.

I'm not one to overcomplicate or change recipes . However , 2 potatoes for a 9x13 is not enough . Also to save time I microwave my potatoes (always) . anyway , they were delicious.  Even my picky son loved them . Will definitely make again , several times .

This is really good. I did have to do some guessing on how many potatoes to use, wish people would put in how many pounds to use instead of a number.

My  first review and this was definitely worth it. Hubby loves onion and real garlic so only change I made was to saute a little chopped onion and about half a teaspoon in the butter as it melted then added them to the potatoes. Can't imagine usint a 9 x 13 pan. I used my largest pyrex casserole from my 24 piece set and had plenty of room.  Baked for about 15 minutes while I grilled the ham steak and we had a really great Easter meal. For a lot less than a restaurant. Thanks for such a great recipe. We'll use it often.

Made mashed potatoes instead of baking the potatoes.  2 baking potatoes are definitely NOT enough for a 9x13 casserole.  Takes about 2-1/2 pounds of medium size potatoes.  Used sharp cheddar for extra flavor.

Turned out pretty well.  I used 4 medium-large russet potatoes with all other ingredient quantities the same, and it turned out fine.  I also added a can of diced mild green chilis and some sliced jalapenos on the top layer of cheese, and both of those additions worked well.  I think it's better if you mash up the potatoes pretty thoroughly, rather than leaving them chunky.  I will make it again.

Made this at my son's request , for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved this dish. I think the size of the pan is off. I doubled the recipe and used a 1.5 quart casserole dish and could have doubled again with room to spare. This was a huge hit and I will be making again, without doubt.

I make this all the time, but never used a recipe, just the same ingredients...with minor changes..1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, fresh chives, REAL bacon (another reviewer said she used bacon    bits)  I would never go through all the work without using at least 6-8 big potatoes! It is just as good when warmed and eaten the next few days. An old time recipe similar to my moms and grandmas! Easy and comforting!

I've never made a twice baked potato before.  I added chopped mushrooms and steamed broccoli.  Turned out really good!

Used red potatoes, left the skins on. Cut the raw bacon into pieces & sauteed it with diced onions. SO GOOD. Will make again when I'm allowed to...Lol.

This was delicious and the perfect accompaniment to Chef John's Sweet  Mustard Chicken Thighs. I added dried shallots to this as well, and rubbed the baking dish with the tiniest amount of bacon grease. The casserole lifted out easily and had a nice golden brown bottom and edges.

I made this for my Grandchildren. They were a little hesitant, but ate it up. I made it in advance, and put it in the oven when they were ready for Dinner. They let me know that it’s a winner.

Delicious!!  Made two large batches using the exact recipe, no tweaks except I left the red potato skins on, for a family picnic and it was gone practically in minutes.  Family loved it!  Can't wait till the Holidays to make this again.  This time I'll make double.

This turned out just as expected. I should have put a little more salt/pepper but otherwise it turned out great and was a hit at a bbq.

I have made this several time and have made some changes which have proved to be a hit.  First, I make sautéed caramelized onions and layer them in the bottom of the 9"x13" casserole dish.  I also double the bacon and mix half of the bacon into the potato mixture (the other half I put on top of the cheese top as the recipe calls for.  Last change is that I also mix green onions into the potato mix.  The sautéed onions on the bottom of the dish really adds to the flavor of this great dish.  I get regular requests to make this for family gatherings and most people have two helpings.

Made this as my contribution to a 14 person family dinner for Easter.  I used a 5lb bag of russets and scaled the other ingredients up though not in equal proportion as with cheese, bacon and whole milk it's already fat and calorie heavy.  Also used additional seasoning as others suggested.  Russets didn't whip smoothly no matter what I did.  For all the work and cost of cheese and bacon, this was just a potato dish.   I have other potato recipes that are more impressive and take less work.   The only highlight is I did flash freeze the potato skins for use another day and I'm looking forward to fixing those later.

I doubled or tripled some of the ingredients to have a full pan for a Thanksgiving side dish, because the recipe seems more like an appetizer.  Can't really say how much of each ingredient I used, but everyone loved it!  It was delicious!

Delicious! I added more garlic powder to mine, just cause I am a fan of garlic,  but I'm sure it would have been delicious with the original amount, too. I mean, cheese + potatoes +  sour cream... How can you go wrong?

This is a good recipe, but I did change a few things.  I doubled the quantity of potatoes and everything else, and I made them by baking them in the oven, then mashing them.  
Came out  great.

No way 2 potatoes would fill a 9x13” dish! I used 6 large potatoes & used rest of ingredients as called for.  Someone must have made a mistake on potato amount?!?  Anyway ...it was sooo good!  Great for potlucks.  Oh, I cut back on time as it was limited & microwaved the potatoes.  I usually bake them tho,..cuz I LUV the crispy skins! Yum!

This is a huge hit with our family. But I do it a bit differently. I like easy... 	• Boil [skin on] potatoes until tender • I used already cooked bacon crumbles. • Mash potatoes until desired consistency. We like ours a little chunky. • Mix Bacon [to taste], 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, butter, chives, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder with potatoes.  • Spread potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. YUMMY

This is an absolute hit with my family. We've always liked twice-baked potatoes and the casserole is so easy. I made it once exactly as written, once I added onions, and once I put in onions and broccoli (my kids always liked twice-baked potatoes with broccoli). Both onions a broccoli went in raw.  

My very Irish father loved it. Now, whenever I make it, I cook extra and give my parents one as well.

A good recipe but as others have mentioned, you need way more than 2 large potatoes. I used about 3 lbs of potatoes (could have used 4lbs) & did not alter the remaining measurements. 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed it. My picky son was not a fan even with the bacon & cheese.

This was awesome! Of course I added more potatoes then called for. I used 8 med baked. Put in as much cheese/ bacon as I wanted, kept the sour cream to half cup, splash extra milk for the extra potatoes. This dish could be great for lots of meals , I'm thinking for breakfast with eggs and sausage for a crowd. Etc.

I used five large baking potatoes instead of two and baked it in a 9 x 13" pan. Increase the sour cream, milk, bacon  as well as the cheese to take into account the added potatoes. It turned out wonderful! Everyone loved it!

Great dish,  loved it!  I used 2 very large potatoes and had to double the sour cream and milk.  Did not have any chives so I minced about 2 tablespoons of red onion.  Everyone liked it.

I didn't use exact measurements and I did it for 8 servings. Yummy!!! I individually wrapped potatoes in foil and poked with a knife. I didn't scoop out potatoes either just cut them in cubes/slices and followed the other instructions.

I don't know where two big potatoes come big enough to make this but using six small to medium worked great and I cut my prep time by baking them in the microwave. Got the dish all ready and put it in the fridge until half an hour before dinner.  Let it bake as oven heats. Met with rave reviews!!!

Excellent!  I had some potatoes that were about to go bad and didn't have the prettiest skins to make the traditional twice baked dish. My family loved this. I made as instructed with no substitutions.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I used all the listed ingredients just used my own measurement for each.  I needed to make more so I guesstimated on how much of everything I needed.   Its a very easy recipe to make.

I was looking for a potato recipe I could make before Christmas dinner and bake that day.  This fit the bill, so I made it.  Had to increase the number of servings, but it turned out great! Everyone Loved it & they all wanted the recipe.  I did mash the potatoes before adding the other ingredients & again after adding them.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this as written with the exception of an extra potato, because I wanted a little extra.  This barely filled an 11x7 pan!  If you make this, you will need to double everything.  Tasted very good though!

Was a hit at Christmas Eve dinner. Multiple people raved about it.  Only dish that did not have leftovers.  I agree the measurements are off though.  I do not know how the author managed this dish with only 2 potatoes and in a 9x13 pan to top it off.  I used 4 potatoes, kept all other ingredients as is, and used a 7x11 pan.  It turned out perfect.

To feed 15 (7 were kids) , I used 8 potatoes and followed the recipe up to step 5 to make ahead - using a 10" x 13" casserole dish.   I made the bacon and placed the crumbles in a baggie to transport, adding them on top for the reheating.  One hour covered in foil, at 300 worked fine, with the last 15 min. uncovered at a higher temp. There was about 1/3 left over.  Everyone loved it.  It did take quite a while to prep that many potatoes and mash them by hand. And  I adjusted the milk and sour cream for correct consistency, not measuring.

Great recipe .   I did triple it to be able to provide more servings.     Really liked  the fact that it could be made ahead of time and then just heat it up.  That way I could spend more time with guests!  Will definitely make this again.

I made this for a potluck, and everyone really liked it. I did make a few changes... mainly by tripling the amount of potatoes, but only doubling the other ingredients. I also added about a cup of green onions instead of using dried chives.

I think the measurements are off.  I used 4 baking potatoes that were a pound a piece, yes that's 4 lbs.  I tripled all of the other ingredients.  I mashed the entire potato in a bowl (skins and all) added half the bacon and stirred it all together.  Put the cheese and the rest of the bacon on top and put it in the oven for about 20-30 min.  Made an ENTIRE 9x13

I trippled the recipe and used less than 1 tsp each pepper and garlic powder.  Still a little too much for our tastes though.  I also ised real bacon bits rather than cooking bacon.

I make this recipe often.  I only change one thing.  I peel potaotoes and make them like I am making mashed potatoes but instead of the milk part, I use the sour cream.  Everything else is the same.  My family loves these and ask for them often.

I'd give this recipe 12 stars if I could! This is so much easier than making actual twice baked potatoes, and we followed everyone's advice and made loaded skins, too! The taste? This should come with a warning label. It's THAT GOOD!

This was a big hit. I used instant potatoes to save time and have actually substituted french onion chip dip for sour cream (just because that's what I had on hand) and it's turned out awesome every time I've made it.

I made this in a smaller portion size  without all the cheese - we had large baking potatoes from a neighbor so I baked them - looked up this recipe and used the ingredients for 2 large baking potatoes.  I only used 1/4 c. cheese for entire dish - this was delicious and my husband says ' it's a keeper'   These were the right combo of ingredients.

Made this for family and there wasn't a spoonful left.  I doubled since there were 7'of us.  The only change I made was I used Colby and cheddar on top and only a half pound of bacon.  I also added half the sour cream and the other half cream cheese.  The next time I believe I will use all low calorie cheeses.  Since with all the great spices, the flavor is fantastic!

This recipe was AWESOME!!  Did modify  preparation, as others suggested.  Peeled the potatoes and cooked on the stove top.  Then used a potato masher to mash.  Once the casserole was prepared, covered it in foil and put in the refrigerator for a few hours.  When it came time to bake it, set the oven to 350 degrees and cooked for 40 minutes.  I also used 1 cup each on cheddar instead of 3/4 cup since we're big cheese lovers.  Other than that, remainder of recipe was followed as written.  Many thanks for posting!!  One of our fav "go to" side dishes now!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! The only thing that I did that was different from the recipe was use red potatoes (unpeeled) and medium cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again for Christmas, but it is great for any occasion.

Used more potatoes for thanksgiving and just added more of the ingredients to match the number of potatoes. Used fresh chives instead of dried. Very easy to make and delish! A big hit this thanksgiving.

Made this for 12 for Thanksgiving.  I think it needs more chives and some of the bacon mixed in with the potatoes.   Also think sharp cheddar would be the way to go.  Just my opinion.  It was pretty good.

Simple to make, delicious, and a big hit with my family. Instead of frying and crumbling the bacon, we used a small package of pre-cooked bacon pieces instead to save time.

Depending on the flavors you want, you can easily use different spices in this dish for variety. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This past weekend I made this for the first time and I WILL make it again!  Thank you!  I needed to take a side dish to a dinner and my husband thinks veggies is what his food eats :-( so I try to make something everyone will love.  The dinner was for four adults.  I used three baking potatoes instead of 2.  I baked them @ 400 for one hour and let them cool. Then, instead of cutting a slice and scooping out the insides, I peeled the harder thin layer of the skin off, leaving the more tender yet thick and flavorful under-skin intact.  I used half & half, probably about a cup instead of a half cup of milk.  With a half pound of bacon in play, I saw no reason to add salt.  I used more chives than called for, but did so because I love them and I used my own fresh.  Instead of using just shredded cheddar, I used shredded sharp cheddar and shredded parmesan.  I also used a tad more garlic than called for.  This dish went over very well and MORE than half was left over.  I split the remainder with my hostess and we were both happy :-)

I made this for a family birthday gathering and everyone raved about it! People who usually aren't fans of white potatoes even came back for seconds. I'd doubled the recipe, plus added additional potatoes and I didn't have chives, so substituted onion powder.  Other than that, I made it as written and it's definitely a keeper. I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I can't imagine making the original recipe with only 2 potatoes, but it was just so good I'll overlook that and give it 5 stars. I'll be making it again!

Great a few problems the potato to other ingredients does match.  Used 6 large and next time will use 8 and add more milk and sour cream as needed. I also added end 1 cup cheddar to the mixture , then added more to the top as far as the bacon goes I also put that into the mix as well . I come from a restaurant background and have been making this version in the twice baked skins for at least 30 years.  Glad to be reminded to put the mix in a bowl and in a casserole ,great for large gatherings

It doesn't seem right that this recipe calls for 2 potatos and a 9x13 dish.  I have used 4-5 medium size and that fits nicely in my 9x13 dish.  I also double all the other ingredients.  It is very good, the whole family eats it up! This is a nice change when the regular 'party potato' recipe gets boring, you know the one, it calls for frozen hash browns...

Everyone in my house loved this recipe. I used an 11x7 pan because I thought the 13x9 was too large. I followed the recipe as written except used light ingredients when possible. We served 4 hungry adults and one 10 yr old and still had some left overs. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I made this recipe for my husband and his Aunt and Uncle. They loved it ! I pretty much stayed with the recipe but doubled it. Making it again tonight and my husband is so excited. The only thing is, that it is a lot of work. But worth it.

Made this along side  http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/74705/spicy-hot-chicken-legs/
Husband didn't want to share with me! Short cut: "bake" the potatoes in the microwave for the first baking phase. The only substitutions I made were heavy cream for the sour cream and milk, and bacon drippings in place of butter. Next time I'll make a much larger batch because my husband wanted to eat all of it and leave none for leftovers.

I made this last night & it turned out very good.  I agree with several of the other reviews in that you don't want to discard the potato peals.  If nothing else put butter in them & eat them while still warm or even chop them up & put them in the potatoes.  This is a definite keeper.

I loved it as is.
I also made it using cream of chicken soup, undiluted, instead of milk. Wonderful that way, too.

I made this last night and my family totally enjoyed it.  I too made a few changes by using a white sharp cheddar, chopped green onions, along with using some of the potatoe skins.  To make sure we got the goodness of the skin, I ripped up some of the skins, placed in the bottom of the casserole dish, and then topped with the ingredients.  We enjoyed being able to have the goodness of a twice baked potatoe and choose the amount we want. Thanks for the recipe.

This was quick & delicious!   I baked my potatoes in the microwave to save time.  I also used 4 potatoes instead of 2 because only had some smaller Idaho potatoes on hand.

Loved this recipe!  I took the advise of another and peeled and boiled the potatoes. What a lovely trick- no need to scoop out hot potato , less mess and shortens cook time. Kept everything else the same.   I was doing a beer can chicken on the grill and put potato casserole on grill instead of oven. What a way to keep house cool and still get comfort food in June.
