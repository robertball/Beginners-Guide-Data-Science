Made this last night with the following adjustments: browned the beef with the taco seasoning to give it more flavor, used a 10.75 oz. can of tomato soup instead of the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, added a packet of ranch dressing, only used 1 can of beans, used 1 can of "southwestern style" diced tomatoes (diced tomatoes and jalapenos) and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes, and only added 1 cup of water. It was perfect  -- had a great consistency (not too thick, not too runny) and was spicy but not too hot. Definitely add a dollop of sour cream! Delicious!

Best taco soup I've ever made!  I made it a day early and took it to an office lunch (oh, was much better the second day), and it got raves.  I did make a few small changes to the recipe, but nothing substantive...I browned the ground beef with chopped onion and garlic.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that had jalapeno peppers mixed in, instead of a separate can of chili peppers.  Omitted the water and added a second can of tomato sauce, and substituted black beans for kidney beans.  The final addition...was a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, instead of the corn water.  As I said, it got raves, and this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Janeen!

This recipe is a good base but I felt it needed some spicing up.  I sauted the onions and about a teaspoon of garlic with the meat.  I also added the dressing and the taco seasoning to the meat before adding to the crock pot.  I tasted the mix before adding water and felt it was too bland, so I added extra cumin and chili powder and a bottle of Mexican beer rather than water.  I think the beer really made a big difference.  I also served with cheese, sour cream, onions, and cheddar-jalepeno beer bread.  I will probably make this again as it was a good start to the chili.

What an awesome, simple recipe!!  It can cook well over 8 hours, too.  I made mine with ground turkey and the beef was never missed!  Thanks for the recipe!

Five stars because this is very easy, really tasty, super economical, can feed a crowd, and makes great leftovers. By the time all the ingredients were added, my 4-quart crockpot was completely full.  This is a HUGE amount of food!  All I had on hand was chicken taco spices, but it worked just fine (with a little extra salt & pepper while browning the hamburger).  We topped ours with shredded Colby-Jack and lite sour cream, and warmed our tortilla chips on a cookie sheet at 350 for 3-4 minutes for extra crunch and flavor.  YUM!!

Excellent and Easy!  I added a package of Ranch Dip mix as well.  Once meat was brown, sprinkled a bit of the taco mix & ranch mix in to flavor the meat some.  Left out the corn and didn't miss it.  But added a small can of diced jalapeno peppers as well as the green chili peppers (they really have no heat to them!) and it was rather spicy.  Might suggest 1/3 to 1/2 can of jalapenos for the tentative!  Used black beans also...very good!  Cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips a must have!!

This is a nice recipe for the winter!  I like to use black beans instead of chili beans and ground turkey instead of beef.  Yummy!

This tasted just like chili and nothing like tacos.  I won't be making this one again.  My husband is not a chili lover for some reason.

Soup was very good. I also added the ranch dressing packet. I added too many green chiles and the family thought it was a little too spicy but very tasty.

Thanks for such a great recipe! I did make a couple of changes though. Instead of 2 cups of water, I used 2 cups low sodium beef broth. Also, about an hour before cooking time is done, I added one can of fat free refried beans. It thickens the broth some and  I think it gives the soup a better texture. What makes this such a terrific recipe is that its so versatile. You can add black beans if you like them or change the meat as well. I've made this with ground beef and also with ground turkey and both are delicious. Try it... you'll like it!

I make this a couple of times a month as a double batch in my crock pot.  Then I divide it out into single portions and freeze for my husband's lunches.  It is one of our favorites!

I make the following changes:

- 1 lb shredded chicken in place of the ground beef (I boil the chicken breasts for 20 minutes, let them cool, then pull apart).
- I use black beans in place of chili beans
- I cut the tomato sauce back to 4 oz
- I omit the water

We like the soup to be more like a thick chili, which it is without the water.  It is GREAT for dipping tortilla chips into... yummy!

Me and my kids love this recipe. The flavor is awesome. I have made this recipe alot and I have tried it doing different things. It comes down to this: Instead of 1 package taco seasoning use 1 1/2. If you want more of a stew then leave out the water. To serve, put tortilla chips on the bottom of bowl with some cheese and add soup. The cheese melts real nice. Add sour cream to top.

Just looking at the Nutritional Info, it has way too much sodium.  I would NOT add the liquid from the cans, substitute water or low sodium broth and would find a low sodium taco mix.

I make this recipe all the time for my family!  We LOVE it!  Defintely a change from chili.  We vary the types of beans we add in this recipe sometimes. Also for lowfat version - we use very lean beef and no cheese or sour cream - baked tortilla chips too. HEALTHY!  One big change though - I do not add the whole cans of beans w/ liquid.  I read about how the liquid is what causes GAS because of its reaction after being canned.  Rinsing, highly reduces gas effect.  Trust me!  Add a little more water, but rinse those beans!  THANKS FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!

Excellent soup, Janeen. I followed your recipe to the letter and everyone loved it! I used my own homemade Taco Seasoning off this site.(Taco Seasoning by Bill Echols) Together, they are a match made in Heaven! Thanks so much.

I took advice from other reviewers and made the following changes: added 2 TBS chili powder and 1 tsp garlic powder along with the taco seasoning and cut the water in half (mostly because my crockpot was so full).  I used garlic and onion seasoned diced tomatoes also.  We ate this with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips, Y-U-M!!!  A keeper!

OK...I planned this meal for my family.  However, my husband decided he would put it together while I was at work instead of me.  I was worried.  I showed him the recipe...but he never read any of the alterations.  So, he made it exactly like they said to.  Well...he had already eaten 1/3 of it before I even got home for dinner.  He has since been eating it out of the pot..while it is still cooking.  He loves it.  He's planning on making this for all of the guys at work.  Yes...I would say 5 stars!  haha  Next time I wouldn't mind doing some of the changes to see if it's even better...but just as is...it's great.  :)

This was really good! I did sub cannelini beans for the chili beans and I didn't add the green chile peppers. We aren't spicy hot people but more on the mild side. But, wow! This was good. I used a 5 qt oval crockpot for those who are interested and it came to within an inch of the top. Perfect! Served with shredded cheddar and some sour cream. Delicious and thanks Janeen!

Pretty good.  More of a chili than a soup.  I cooked it for 7 hours, and I don't think it needed that long.  There's nothing that needs "cooking", so the longer it cooks, the blander it'll be.

I served it up with cornbread and it was great, the sauce/juice goes perfect with the cornbread.

I made this thicker (more like a chili) by omitting the water and served over tortilla chips. I also drained and rinsed my beans (can't stand the juice in canned beans). Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning and Mexican oregano and a can of Rotel tomatoes helped pump up the flavor. A squeeze of fresh lime finished it off perfectly.

This was soo easy, and just as good! I work full time, so in the morning I hurried and browned the meat, opened all the cans, threw it all in, and ran out the door. I came home to an awesome spicy smell and served it to my husband and some friends of ours. I didn't put any water in it and it was perfect. My husband even went back for more and we had no leftovers. The corn chips, cheese, and sour cream are a must. It's a lot like chili, with a spicier flavor. I may even replace my chili recipe with this one! It was great!

I used two cans of drained black beans instead of the undrained chili and kidney beans, and omitted the corn.  I also used 2 cups beef broth instead of water, and added some spices (chili powder, cilantro, cumin, paprika, a little fresh garlic) on top of the taco seasoning mix.  Combined with some shredded cheese and corn chips, it was ridiculously good.  I'm definitely going to be making it on a regular basis.

This was an awesome recipe!!!! I only used one can of beans (the hot kind), drained the corn, and used 1 1/2 packets of taco seasoning. I also used canned tomatoes packed with garlic. I didn't add any extra water because we like our soup thick. I topped it with cheddar/jack mix shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped raw onion, chopped serrano peppers, sliced avocado and hot tortilla chips! Delicious! The only thing I will change is to only use 1 can of tomatoes next time.

Great recipe!  I've made something like this before, but never with an actual recipe.... it was nice to have one.  I just didn't have any chile peppers, but it was great without it.  I had a bunch of fresh corn on the cob I needed to use, so I cooked it, cut it off the cob and then added it to the crockpot after it was about halfway done.  I also used some fresh chopped grape tomatoes since I found I was out of canned ones.  The corn and tomatoes made it taste so fresh and yummy.  Served with sour cream and corn chips.

Tasted a bit bland, so added a second package of taco seasoning mix - this was much more flavorful - also rinsed the kidney beans before adding and didn't add all the water, since there wasn't room in the slow cooker - topped with cheese and sour cream and crushed chips, this was absolutely excellent.

We all liked this alot.  I have a taco soup recipe but this one is a little bit easier since there is less chopping and the use of canned goods.  I increased the tomato sauce to 2 cans, decreased the water to 1 cup and used a can of Italian stewed tomatoes.  Sprinkled shredded lettuce, sour cream and 3 cheese mexican blend cheese over each bowl. Tasty!

we loved this soup! made almost exactly as written except used frozen corn, i make my own taco seasoning and i never use chili beans, but normally have pinto or great northern on hand and used those. we topped with avacados, shredded cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and cilantro. DON'T forget the cilantro - it makes all the difference!

We make this often at our house. I use the Hunts diced tomatos and use a regular size can of enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce. Such a good recipe to break and change the rules on by using what you have on hand. It also comes together pretty quick as a stovetop meal. LOVE!

This soup was excellent!  I especially liked the fact that it used ingredients I tyically have on hand, so I could just throw it together on a moment's notice.  I use my crock pot all the time and am always looking for new slow cooker soup recipes.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband suggested using leftover beef roast instead of the ground beef next time, so I may try that, too!

Fantastic taco soup!  I did make one alteration: because I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, I used canned enchilada sauce and it gave the soup a nice tangy flavor.  I will be making this again because my entire family enjoyed it!

I followed this recipe but added a package of ranch seasoning, as I had seen in other similar recipes, and the soup was delicious. I really think the ranch seasoning is a must and that's the only reason for the 4 star rating; otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.

We like this recipe because it's not as spicy as chili...which I like 3 alarm, but my family does not... but, it's got the seasoning flavor of tacos, which we all like. I serve it with Fritos and sour cream. Thanks for a good recipe that satisfies us all!

Great base recipe. I made a few small changes to use what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe, used three cans of organic black beans (that I drained and rinsed...I don't ever add the "juice" from a can of beans) instead of the chili and kidney beans. I just prefer black beans, organic tomato sauce, one can condensed beef broth instead of plain water, two cans fire-roasted tomatoes with the juice, just one can of diced green chilies, one 8 oz. container organic salsa that I had to use or lose, and I made my own taco seasoning mix. Because I wanted to up the vegetables, I used two large organic orange bell peppers and 1 large chopped zucchini, that I sauteed in extra virgin olive oil with the two onions and 12 cloves fresh garlic. I think this recipe was made extraordinary with the addition of the few ingredients I had on hand, a homemade spice mixture and organic ingredients. I have to say that this is the best soup I've had in a long time. GREAT for making your weekly pot of soup and cleaning out your fridge/cupboard right before the big shopping day of the week. This was so good it didn't even need extra "toppings", like fat free sour cream or shredded lowfat cheese!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for!  I have used this countless times to make meals for those in need, new babies, sick friends, etc and everyone loves, loves it!  I follow the recipe exactly and one thing I use for sure is Busch's brand of chili beans...the best for this recipe!  Thank you so much...I have probably made it at least 50 times!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent! One of the great things about taco soup is that it can be made very quickly on a busy night, but this method of slow-cooking really allows the flavors to blend. The house smells delicious and, unlike many slow-cooker recipes, the flavor matches the scent. I usually add about three cloves of minced garlic, and serve it over tortilla chips or shredded corn tortillas, topped with pepperjack cheese and a dab of sour cream.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious! I didn't have time to do it in the slow cooker, so I made it on the stove. The only thing I did different was to omit the water since there was enough liquid once I added the canned ingredients. This is simple and very good, definitely a keeper!

I really liked this recipe but had to add some additional spices for it to taste like tacos. I used everything as directed and added two packets of Sason. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then on low for another 5 hours. In the end the soup tasted not only like tacos but had the same flavor as menudo. It was a big hit and a very easy and cheap recipe.

This soup is beyond easy and is delicious as well!  I made it according to the recipe (no additional seasonings or ingredients). Something to note is that using one can of chopped green chilies doesn't make for a terribly spicy soup so pump it up if you want more heat; you can also use medium or hot-heat chili beans to up the heat-factor. And just to make a point, this recipe ISN'T about making an overly spicy soup. That's why I made this; I didn't want it to taste like my chili. I just wanted a good, solid delicious soup and that's what I got. So do yourself a favor and make it according to the recipe (which is what rating these recipes is about, yes?), serve it with some cheddar and sour cream on top and ENJOY!

This was so not what I was expecting based on the reviews... unfortunately we ended up wasting most of it as we didn't care for it. Way too soupy and lacked flavour.

As written, this recipe is too high in sodium. But that can be easily solved. The kidney beans, tomato sauce, canned tomatoes can be purchased as low sodium products. I will use my roasted and frozen green chiles and I buy a Mexican seasoning that is sodium free. And I will use 2 cups of frozen corn. And then I can eat a healthy bowl of taco soup!

This was a very tasty soup! After reading many reviews I basically used this recipe as a launching platform. First I used already prepared taco seasoned ground beef then pretty much followed the recipe. Then I added the ranch dressing mix as others had suggested and also added extra taco seasoning, 1 tsp. cumin, 1-1/2 tsp. chopped garlic, 2 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp. chili powder and also I added a small can of sliced black olives, after all how can you have tacos without black olives. It cooked on low all night and after having a cup for breakfast I put it in my garage refrigerator for two days. Its against the law good warmed up! This one is a keeper!

I don't know why people keep saying this recipe is a lot like chili...maybe I make my chili more meaty than most, but I thought this was exactly as described, TACO SOUP!  I typically don't like corn (except creamed corn) in anything but thought I would give this a try, and decided that I still don't like corn in stuff!  LOL  I will omit it if I make this again.  I also took the advice of several other reviewers and browned my meat w/ the taco seasoning, and then added a bit more to the crock pot.  I also added a packet of dry spicy ranch dressing mix, and a can of black beans b/c I love them!  I used beer instead of water.  I thought this was good.  I served w/ shredded cheese, sour cream, and crushed chips.  This made a HUGE crock pot full!  My son had a bowl, the BF had 2, and I had a bowl and a half, and there was still more than 1/2 the crock pot left!  Great if you are feeding a crowd or need something to eat on for a few days!

This soup is delicious. I made the modifications a couple of other reviewers mentioned-adding beer instead of water really gives it a great flavor and replacing the beef with turkey lowers the fat a little. My husband has been asking for this almost daily since the first time I made it.

I made this exactly as written and we thought it was delicious.  An added bonus is how simple it was to put together.  I had the ground beef cooked, all the ingredients assembled in the slow cooker, and the kitchen cleaned up in less than 20 minutes before I rushed out the door to get to work.  I added a bit of sliced avocado, crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheddar, and a bit of sour cream to individual serving bowls.  Served with a cornbread muffin and we were set.  This is a keeper!

I have never made Taco soup before but I sure picked the right recipe to use!  Thanks Janeen!  I did use fresh corn though, as I had some that needed to be used but I stuck to the rest of the recipe as stated.  Loved the blacks beans, (have never used them before in all my years of cooking).  It will become one of my go to soups for sure, especially with cold weather coming quickly.  Happy cooking!

I've been making a similar recipe for years.  Tacos do not have beans so I don't use them.  Beans make a good filler tho.  Corn reminds me of a tortilla & tastes great in this soup.  A friend suggested adding a packet of Ranch dip mix so I do.  Yum!!!  I top each bowl of soup with a generous sprinkle of cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, sliced green onions & a drizzle of hot sauce.  I serve warm Juanita's Corn Chips on the side.  It's not only really tasty, but beautiful to the eye.  Everyone raves about it, especially hubby's poker group.

Excellent!!  I followed others advice & only used 1 cup water & can of tomato soup instead of sauce, plus extra taco seasoning, garlic & cumin.  Don't forgey the shredded cheese (I used TexMex) & sour cream. It really enhanced the flavor.

this was too bland for my family's tastes.  we also didn't care for the tomato sauce.  we were expecting it to taste like chili, instead it tasted like tomato sauce with beef, beans and corn.

I made this soup for a dinner party the other night and it was a big hit!  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used ground chicken for the beef, a can of mexicorn, a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, chicken broth, Rotel mild diced tomatoes, 1/4 t. ground cumin and 1/2 pkg of dry ranch mix.  Great flavor and will be making again.

This is a very good, simple recipe!  I'm a big fan of Taco Soup, but I like to make homemade taco seasoning to brown with the meat & onions (instead of the packet) & I only use 1 cup beef broth instead of the water.  Those only two changes aside, this is a tasty soup!  Add a chopped jalapeno for some heat.  :)  Makes for plenty of leftovers for another night, which is a plus!  Thank you for this good slow cooker recipe!

this was very good and super easy. i mixed some shredded lettuce, chopped cilantro, sliced black olives, and freshly squeezed lime together and i topped each bowl with that mixture, a dollop of light sour cream, and some homemade tortilla strips i made the day before. i will definitely make this again. i liked it even better than the popular slow cooker chicken taco soup from this site. this was a great way to use up some of my frozen venison.

I've made a nearly identical recipe for years.  I love the ease, convenience and overall result.  The difference in the recipes is that the one I've used doesn't use a crockpot.  You can just brown the meat in a dutch oven/stock pot and dump all the other ingredients in.  It's ready to eat in 30 mins.  Good, hearty and fast! Great for a quick weeknight meal.

This is a great recipe base for sure, but I have tweaked it a little. I like to make it thick like chili, so I omit the water.  I also add more taco seasoning and throw in some chopped jalapeños (not too much, just enough for a little flavour). Like others, I usually serve it up with some cheese, sour cream and nacho chips. And sometimes I don't have the right kind of beans, so I just throw in navy, black, kidney; whatever combination I have in the pantry goes in and it always turns out great.

Amazing! I have been making this for several months now...Always a hit! I add extra corn (2 X 12 ounce cans), a can of mushrooms, white kidney beans (more fiber) instead of red, and one cup of water with great success! Great with chopped green onions and tortilla chips. Excellent for lunch the next day! My husband's colleagues always request I make this delight for them after seeing his taco soup leftovers for lunch!

This was WONDERFUL!!!  I put it on in the morning and tasted at lunch and YUMMY.  I couldn't wait to get home to eat some.  I made a few revisions after reading the reviews: 1 can stewed tomatoes w/jalapenos, 1 can ROTEL tomatoes (instead of 2 cans diced tomaotes) added a packet of ranch dressing mix, added 1/2 cup of water and 2 cans of beef consume instead of 2 cans of water.  I also seasoned the meat with cumin and chili powder while it was cooking.  It was FABUOUS! The only bad thing was that because I was gone so ling it ended up cooking for 10 hrs on low instead of 8 so it had a tiny burnt flavour to it. Next time I will cook for about 6 hours on low to insure that doesn't happen again, because this is the best soup i have ever made.  And, I don't think it's at all "soup-y chili" To me this is definatly a soup, it reminded me of a vegetable beef soup with a tex-mex twist!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

WOW!  My house smelled so good.  I added some chopped garlic to "kick it up a notch".  It was a big hit when nine people came to help us move into our new house.  We topped with sour cream, cheese, and blue corn chips.  Best soup ever.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I have to say this dish is AWESOME. I think my husband was skeptical when I told him I was making "taco soup", but as soon as he tasted it his skepticism immediately went away. I LOVED it! Even my 3 year old liked it, and that's saying something. The only thing I did different was I added one whole pkg. of regular taco seasoning and 1/2 pkg of mild seasoning!! GREAT recipe..definitely recommend it :)

I have a recipe like this but have not done taco soup in the slow cooker. I add hominy (in place of regular corn) and black beans for color contrast! Love this in winter; so does my family. G-R-E-A-T

This is an excellent soup.  After making it and letting it cook a full day I tasted it. It seemed to lack something so I added 1/2 can of tomato paste to it to strengthen the tomato taste and now it's perfect.  We couldn't get enough of this wonderful recipe.

We really enjoyed this soup.  We always used another taco soup recipe and love it as well, so we were skeptical about trying a new one, but I think this is my new favorite.  We topped our soup with sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, and shredded cheese.

I have made this a couple of times with a couple of minor modifications.  Instead of using taco mix I just use the spices I use for taco meat (cumin, chili powder, red pepper, picante, onion, garlic).  And I used one can of regular Rotel (tomatoes and chili peppers) and one can of diced tomatoes.  We all loved it!  We froze the leftovers in individual servings for a quick meal.

I forgot to start this in the crock pot early so since I worked from home that day I started the entire thing stovetop, brought it to a boil and then dummped it into the crockpot. It simmered on low in the crock pot for about 4 hours and it was absolutely delcious! The only change I made was to double the green chilies because we love them.

Very simple prep. I did put it in the slow cooker, but can always just simmer on the stove if want to. It has the taste of a minestrone soup with a lil zest from the taco seasoning. The kids enjoyed it.

Perfect taco soup.  I forgot to start it in the morning, so I made it on the stove top instead.  I made a couple of changes because of this. I cooked the onions first in a little cooking spray until soft and only added one cup of water. I also did not add meat because I prefer mine without. I cooked the soup on low for two hours and the texture was perfect.

Yum!  I love recipes that call for opening cans and dumping in ingredients - that turn out yummy in the end!  Based on another review, I substituted tomato soup for the tomato sauce. And, I added some chopped celery as well (another vegetable - never hurts!)  Another reviewer said this was "chili" - take it from this Texan....this ain't chili! It's definitely taco soup. And, very good.  I did make the mistake of draining a couple of the ingredients before adding them just because I didn't realize how important the juice was.  I'll keep it all in there next time.  This one's definitely a keeper.

Quick and easy to prepare.  One of the best flavored taco soups I've ever had.  I topped it off with shredded cheese and poured it over tortilla chips.

I used ground turkey and added beef boullion to the mixture to trick my boyfriend into thinking he's eating beef. I only put it on about two hours ago, but it already tastes amazing and I can't wait to eat it for dinner.

Great Recipe! I will be making this on a regular basis. A made a couple of changes. I chopped up 1 med onion and minced up 2 cloves of garlic to brown with the meat. Also added 1 tsp cumin,1 pkt ranch dressing mix and used all black beans. I don't think it needs to be cooked 8-10 hours or the beans will melt.I also omitted the water and used 1 can chicken broth. Thanks for great recipe.

...This soup is good as written.  What comes to mind is more of a SW chili...The second time I made this, cooked my onion with the beef and added some roasted garlic, salt and pepper...I replaced the tomato sauce with cream of tomato soup, added more green chilies and a bottle of beer for the water.  Ladled this over tortilla chips and topped with shredded cheddar...very good AND easy. I let this slow cook on low all afternoon..will play with this one again..Thanks for a great post.  :)

This was fabulous!!! We all loved it.....with these alterations: I omitted the 2 cups of water. It would have been just too runny. I also drained the corn but left the sauce of the beans in. I also added 2 tsp of minced garlic.
I have made this several times and have given the recipe out to friends.....no complaints!!!

This was very good and very easy. The only thing I did differently was add one chopped green pepper, and then I added about 1 cup of uncooked brown rice during the last hour of cooking. The soup turned out really good and really filling, and it made A TON!! Thanks for the recipe!

Oops. I forgot to grab a few of the ingredients at the grocery store so I made some adjustments. I neglected to get tomato sauce, the green chilies, and taco seasoning. I used 2 cups tomato juice & 1 cup water instead of 2 cups water & 1 can sauce. I added a 16 oz. jar of salsa, 2 Tbsp. chili powder (if i hadn't run out, i would have used 3), 1 tsp. of oregano, and 1 1/2 tsp. cumin. Also sprinkled in cayenne pepper to taste. I used 1 can kidney beans, 2 cans great northern beans, & 1 can black beans. Browned the beef & dumped everything into the ceramic pot the night before. Kept in fridge overnight. The next morning, I just got it out & plugged it in. Great with shredded cheese and tortilla chips. mmmmm.

I wanted to try this but it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon, so I skipped the slow cooker and did it stove top.  I omitted the two cups water.  I added cooked rice when it was done.  It was excellent and got rave reviews from my family.

This deserves all five stars because...easy to make, better second day, very nutritious, and a hit with everyone! I added a can of black beans (rinsed) and tomatoes with mild green chilis. Served with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips. Might add a can of homeny next time too. Very very good. I love soup!

This was really really good.  I did change the recipe a bit though.  I made it for my boyfriend who dislikes beans very much so i put in an extra pound of ground serloin.  I also used a can of mexican tomatoes and instead of water i added 2 cups of beef broth.  I used spicy taco seasoning and the soup was delicious.  He loved it.  It tasted better than the taco soup we had at Harrahs in Tahoe.  I will definetly make this again, maybe next time i will add potatoes.

Chili with corn, that is the first thing that came to mind when it I first tasted it.  I made this last night for my Dads "32nd" birthday gathering, (or so he says, he's really 57, ha) and the family all enjoyed it.  I added 2 cans of Rold Gold Fiesta Mexican Style Tomatoes (with lime juice & cilantro).  Don't forget the sour cream (it makes all the difference) crumbled tortilla chips & the shredded cheese on top!  Thanks Janeen!

This is the easiest soup I have every made.  The only time consuming part of the prep was opening the cans.  Every time I take this soup to a potluck, everyone asks for the recipe.  I add cheese and sour cream and serve with tortilla chips.  Thank you Janeen for creating a family favorite!

This is a great recipe for those who work.  I assemble the soup in the morning and forget about it until dinner time.  I substitued ground turkey for the beef to make it more heart healthy.

Extremely bland! I had to add so much to this it no where near resembled the original recipe. I added taco sauce, Mexican cheese, paprika, onion and garlic powder, tripled the taco seasoning, added some salt and black pepper. I omitted the extra water too.I ended up changing it so much I am calling it Taco Chili.

This was quick and easy.  I halved the recipe and it was just right for my crock pot and my family of 4 with some leftovers for lunch.  I substituted with some bulk hot turkey sausage to cut down on fat, increased the cumin and chili powder and omitted the jalepenos for the shake of my two adolescent children. We all enjoyed it and will prepare again this season,I am sure.

This definitely was super easy; I'm a big fan of any recipe that involves a crock pot; however I felt it really needed seasoning.  A little bland; (I didn't add the peppers so that may be why). I added Adobe all purpose seasoning, which helped and served it over rice with shredded taco cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips. If you are going to make this recipe I recommend using "small" red kidney beans for presentation purposes.  Overall it's quick and great for a weekday meal when you have no time to cook.

This is good as written, however, I am not a big fan of chunk tomato. I used one can of rotel tomatoes with green chilis and 1 can of diced tomatoes and use my immersion blender to puree them before I add.  I also leave out the beans suggested in the recipe and use black beans, or no beans at all. Only because that is a preference as well. (Optional) Added sliced black olives, and sliced green olives. I have also added a package of dry ranch dressing mix. Its good with this addition, but its not needed. We also top this with fritos, sour cream and cheddar cheese. Its really good. Will definitely be making this again and again.

Call it soup, call it chili but this chili soup is really good, and that is what matters. I changed this recipe as follows: turkey for beef, black beans for chili beans, omitted corn, 16 oz. tomato sauce vs. 8 oz., 2 tablespoons Taco Seasoning I by B. Echols (on this site) for package taco seasoning mix; added: 1 (15 ounce) can refried black beans (for thicker consistency) & 1 teaspoon wasabi sauce. Can goods were all low sodium. Due to plans getting sidetracked, did not have 8 hours for slow cooker so used stockpot on stove to cook (brought to boil, and then simmered for about 1-1/4 hrs.). We will be making this again soon.

Wow, HOT! The green chilies left my mouth and lips tingling for 20 minutes! If you like that, make this soup as is! If you're a MILD/MEDIUM heat person, make this WITHOUT the chilies the first time & add them later if you want. I will definately make this tastey, flavorful, yummy soup again, but without the green chilies!

Made this recipe with exact ingredients and it was perfect! It's not too spicy for those who don't like a lot of kick but I'm sure would be easy to add Frank's hot sauce to it to spice things up. Will cook again!

Easy and delicious! I threw in some leftover ground pork sausage from breakfast, and it added just a touch of extra flavor and was a good compliment to the recipe.

Subs. Used 1 pound of tofu, 1 can kidney beans, didn't have chili beans, roasted some corn, and 2 cups of beer. I'm living in China, so it's hard to find things. I made my own tomato sauce (yum-o). Added a little old bay seasoning...delicious :)

I make something very similar to this.  Instead of the chili beans, I use one can of kidney beans, one can of garbanzo beans, and one can of black beans.  I don't use the water or tomato sauce, there is enough liquid in all of the beans and the corn that you don't need the water.  I also don't use the peeled tomato or chilies.  Instead I use one can of Rotel.  Then, I use have a block of Velveeta, you can adjust to however much cheese you want.  It's a delicious soup!!

This sounds really good.But it is really nothing more than chili.Slight variation from chili is the taco seasoning which I can tell you has way too much salt in it.This also needs cumin to be authentic mexican flavor.I use cumin in my homemade chili as well.I never use those pre-mixed seasoning packets just because they are always too salty.Use individual seasonings and you can regulate the amount of salt that goes in.

Made this for a potluck at work.  I doubled the batch and used half the water. I also only put 1/2 can of corn in for the entire batch.  Everyone used the tortilla chips as the spoons and used it as a dip.....a favorite loved by all!

I used 4 chicken thighs (precooked & shredded), added a can of Mexican Rotel and seasoned with chili powder & Lauery's Black Pepper Seasoning (original recipe was a bit bland for my taste). I had to use my big crock pot and when it was done, I had lot's of leftovers which I froze and took for lunches at work.

This was the best soup I have ever made and highly recommend it. Serving with shredded cheese and sour creame puts this 'over the top'.

What a fantastic recipe! I made just a few changes. I used ground Turkey instead of beef for lower fat content. I used half of the taco seasoning to brown the meat then poured the second half into the actual soup mixture. Like suggested, I served with cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. A bit of hot sauce was added for a little extra kick. 
Serve with corn muffins to complete as a hearty meal. I will most certainly be making this again- I can see it becoming a favorite in my household! Thanks Janeen :)

Easy recipe- and the whole family loves it! I did exactly as the recipe- except I made everything spicy (hot taco seasoning, diced tomatoes- hot, and the 4oz can of chilies became diced jalopenos.) Yowzer- my lips are still tingling- lol. But that was my own fault. We had sliced French bread to dip into the soup. Anyway- great recipe- deff making again.

I have never posted a comment on this website, although I use tons of recipes from here.  I tried this recipe last night and my goodness it was delicious!!  I took bits and peices of other member's advice.  I added taco seasoning to the hamburg.  I put in a can of chile tomatoes, corn, chili beans, kidney beans, and a big can of tomato sauce with 2 cups of water (added bouillon cubes to this).  I added ranch seasoning.  I cooked it overnight in my crock pot and voila!  This is simple, delicious and nutritous!  I added a few taco chips and some shredded cheese.  I didn't have sour cream but it still tastes great without.  Thanks so much!! :)

We all liked it.  I made the following changes: Used 1 tsp cumin, 1 Tbs chili pepper and 1 tsp salt w/meat rather than seasoning packet.  Used tomato sauce in place of water.  Used 1 can chili beans and 1 can black beans.  Drained corn and added 1 Tbs brown sugar.  Used package frozen onions in place of fresh. Used one can tomatoes with chilis and one that had chipotle peppers in it.  Added package of dry ranch seasoning mix at end of cooking.  I added diced avacados to mine - Yum!

It was perfect. I have enough for lunches this week. I did admittedly add some beef stock as well but it was still delish. It also works well on five hours on high in the slow cooker if your cooking at breakfast time and want it ready for lunch.

This tastes more like chili than tacos but it is still a good soup.  I omitted the kidney beans and used black beans instead. I also used rotel instead of one of the cans of diced tomatoes.

So easy!  Just prepare everything the night before, turn on the slow cooker before you head out the door, and by the time you come home, dinner is ready!  This makes for a good chili (don't really get much taco taste).  It is a bit mild, though, so if you want a little more kick, add some more peppers or use a spicy taco seasoning mix.  I omitted the can of kernel corn and used 16 0z of tomato sauce instead.  Turned out perfect!  Will make again!

Try adding some dry ranch mix (I add two packs)... I think it adds even more flavor. This is a really good recipe that my husband and I both enjoy, and leftovers are always a treat! Oh and I add 2 packs of Taco seasoning to mine, but then again I am a Texas girl. ;)

This was awesome.  I was skeptical but we had alot of ground taco meat left over from taco night and I just threw it in.  Everyone liked this including my 4, 6,  and 9 year old.  Everyone had seconds.  The only change I made was I used mexicorn instead of plain canned corn.  Delicious!

I really liked this, i added olives and a packet of ranch dressing seasoning and the flavor was really good. I think next time I'll add a can of black beans, it didnt seem to have many beans.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it is lacking one very important ingredient. Adding a packet of ranch dressing mix is KEY to making this recipe a sucess! I have been making this soup for about 5 years now. I make it often since everyone likes it (including my picky 4 year old and my husband who isn't "a soup guy"), it's super easy, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I like black beans instead of chili beans but that's just personal preference.

Absolutely delicious!  Family, company and the kids loved this dish.  Took a few suggestions from other reviews.  No water just extra tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with chilies instead of a can of each.  Added taco seasoning, onions & ranch to meat as I cooked it.  So good and so very convenient.  Was able to toss it together @ 8am & have a stress free dinner that evening.

Terrific! I realized when I was making the soup that I had only half a pound of ground turkey. I used that, and then I put in about a half pound of chopped turkey bacon. I used 1 14 oz can of tomato sauce (no water) and two cans of Rotel (for the extra chilis). I added cumin, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and at the very end some fresh cilantro. Sprinkled the top with some shredded cheese, and my husband said I should make it every week.....

This is such a nice change.  My kids loved it and they don't do soup.  I put black beans in instead and used crushed tomatoes instead of chunks.  I used two packages of taco seasoning.  Served with a cheddar cheese bread and tortilla chips.  It's a keeper!!

Tastes like a taco in a bowl!  I made the following modifications:  used 3 10oz. cans of Rotel in various flavors instead of the diced tomatoes, used 1 Corona instead of the water, added an extra 1/2 packet of taco seasoning (low sodium), and added about a teaspoon of cumin and a few tablespoons of garlic.  We served over Fritos corn chips and with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Definitely 5 stars with these modifications!!

I have been making this recipe for years, but we call it "SANTA FE SOUP". The only difference is I add a packet of Ranch Dressing Mix and use hominy instead of corn. (I'm not a big fan of kidney beans, so I usually forget to buy them. The soup is just as good without them). Serve w/ grated cheese and some cornbread.

I don't know what I did that was different from everyone else.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but we found the soup to not have very much flavor.  I should have cut down the water to only one cup rather then two.

Made this yesterday ( with some changes ) and was very well pleased with the results. First I down sized to 4 servings, then doubled the following items. Ground Beef, Chili beans, Green chili peppers. Left out the Kidney beans as we do not care for them. Added one teaspoon of ground Cumin and about a half teaspoon of chili powder.. Mixed everything well in my slow cooker and cooked on high for three hours. Came out perfect.

We love this soup!  But the recipe written as is tasted a little one dimensional, so the next time I made it I made a few changes based on my taste and other reviewers' suggestions.  

I used 2 pouches of Boca instead of the beef, mostly to cut down on labor and time.  I used 3 cans of Ro-tel instead of the 2 cans of diced tomatoes, and used black beans in place of kidney beans.  I added 1 beef bouillon cube and extra taco seasonings for flavor boost.  Served as suggested with cheese, sour cream and chips.  I have now made this many times for many people and always receive raves and requests for the recipe.  Fabulous!

My husband and I really enjoyed this easy meal, but I did have to add a few things to give it enough flavor. I added a few cloves of minced garlic, a chicken boullion cube (I used turkey instead of beef), salt, and chili powder. Overall it turned out very well. Instead of adding all the extra spices, I would have just added an extra taco seasoning if I had one on hand.

This was delicious Janeen.  I added a package of ranch dressing mix and served this over corn chips with shredded cheddar cheese.  Nothing but raves!

Great starter recipe.  I followed most of the suggestions from the other reviewers and used tomato juice instead of water, added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, added a can of black beans along with the other two kinds of beans, two cans of rotel instead of the diced tomatoes and can of diced green chilis, ranch dressing, red onion, chopped cilantro and some green peppper.  Made the mistake of putting in a cup of rice and it ended up more like chili than soup, but it still tasted great.  Will make again with all the changes except the rice.  The cheese and the sour cream are a must.  Thanks Janeen, I know I changed the heck out of it but you gave me a really great start too a really good "soup".... :)

This is an excellent soup.  I omit the tomato sauce and the 2 cups water because I only have a 3 1/2 quart slow cooker but we don't seem to miss those items.  This is just delicious and it is even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I used an extra can of beans, and lean ground turkey instead of beef and it was great.  next time I'm leaving out the corn liquid because I thought it added a little twinge of sweetness I could have done without.  Good soup!

This is an EASY and great tasting recipe.  Great for large parties.  I think the can of jalepano would be too much.  I used two teaspoons of canned and that was plenty.  I also used the beans I had on hand, small red kidney and black beans.  Thank you

This was sooooo good! My husband has not stopped raving! I forgot to add the water and it turned out fine. I also improvised with picante sauce since I didn't have the chile peppers or tomato sauce.  Great recipe to play with and make your own...Loved it!!!!

What can I say ? 
Absolutely delicious !
A tip I will add is instead
of useing water,use jalapeno
juice instead to add more "hot"
to the recipe .

This was really yummy. I had a can of mixed beans so I used that and also threw in chick peas. I added a can of mushrooms too. I really like the flavour and even with a can of chiles it didn't get to spicy. I have tons of leftovers and it really seems to thicken up the next day. Served it with "homesteader cornbread" from this website. The only thing is that it didn't seem to agree with us as we both were up most of the night. I would probably make this for a group event. Very easy.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good.  I really liked that it was so easy to whip together.  However neither of my kids would eat it--my daughter said she thought the hamburger was too bland and my son didn't like the tomato taste.  Next time I'll probably omit the water (it was a bit soupier than I was anticipating) and add extra onions plus maybe a little bit more chiles.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a Kid Pleaser!!  My 7 and 9 year olds loved it served with grated cheddar and tortilla chips.  Sour cream really added to the flavor for the adults.  For those worried about heat, using mild green chilies added flavor and minimal heat. One can always add a dash of hot sauce to individual servings.  Thanks!!

I have this recipe simmering in my crock pot as I type. I bumped the soup just a tad by using two cans of Rotel tomatoes and just one can of regular diced tomatoes.  Also added hot taco seasoning mix.  We don't have kids, nuff said.  Sandy

Great Soup.  It makes a lot so freeze it if you do not have a large family.  I used the chilli beans which were a $1.00 a can at the store may next time just try using pinto beans or another can of kidney beans and add some more spice!

A friend of mine gave me this recipe and we loved it!  It was more of a chili though because of the thickness.  Also, her recipe included one packet of ranch dressing mix.  I thought that really peculiar, but it added a great flavor to it!!

This is a super easy recipe to make and it is very tasty. The only change I make is substituting the water with additional tomato sauce. The sour cream finishes the dish off nicely and we serve it with nachos. Awesome!

Very easy & good. We substituted ond of the cans of diced tomatoes with one can of diced tomatoes & green chilis, then cut the water to only one cup. Served with cheese, sour cream & chips on the side to add. Yum!

Everyone loved this!  I left out the water and this made a very filling, almost chili-like soup.  I made my own taco seasoning and used Johnsonville ground breakfast sausage instead of the beef.  I also followed other reviewers which said to use: 10.75 oz. can of tomato soup, a packet of ranch dressing, 1 can of cannelloni beans instead of the chili beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes and jalapenos and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes.  Can't wait to make it again!  Served with cornbread and topped with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.

Great easy dinner. Used 2 tbs homemade taco seasoning (recipe on this site); crushed tomatoes instead of diced; added 3 chopped small carrots and 1 chopped celery & only 2 oz of green chilis. Serve over rice and added Tortilla Strips (salad topping). Didn't use crock pot today - cooked in Dutch Oven on stovetop. Might serve with grilled cheese and tomato sandwich in the future.

It was just ok. Nothing spectacular and not as flavorful as I thought a taco soup would be. We are it but will not be making it again. Regular tacos are easier.

Five stars because it was both good and very easy! I had it ready in 20 minutes! I through in some extra beans, a small can of tomato juice and used Janeen's taco seasoning recipe from the reviews. My family enjoyed it, and my mother-in-law and several sisters-in-law all loved it the next day.

Easy-- kids loved it.  Even my picky eater.  Like others, I browned ground beef with onions and taco seasoning.  (I used taco seasoning recipe from this site-- never buy it any more).  Yummy!

I did everything. But instead of water I used beef broth. It is requested a lot at work for myself to bring. It gets a 10 everytime.

This was very good, with extra points for being quick and easy.  Hubby is allergic to beans, so I substituted an extra can of corn and an extra can of tomatoes instead.  Has a little bite, but not too spicy (I used the entire can of green chiles, plus your brand of taco seasoning might impact the spice level).  Served with cheese, sour cream, green onions and diced avocado on top.

This is our of my favorite recipes! We substitute the ground beef for a pound of shredded chicken, and add a can of black beans to the mix. Plus, we always add an extra can of green chiles for a little extra kick. Serve with some cheese and tortilla strips on top for extra tastiness!

This is one of the easiest meals I've ever prepared.  I made this as is (which I wish everyone would please do before they review).  I found no reason to change anything.  This is a fantastic weeknight meal...a few minutes in the morning and a complete, delicious meal ready when you come home.  I served it with Fritos, shredded cheese, and sour cream.  It doesn't have a lot of 'kick', but that is easy enough to remedy for personal preference with some hot sauce, jalapenos, etc.  I liked the 'crunch' from the corn and I would definitely not leave it out.  This would be great for pot lucks and family gatherings.  I will definitely make it for family and guests.

Saw this reicpe and thought I would give it a try.  I really like taco soup ever since I had some a friend made and I loved the fact that this was done in a slow cooker.  The problem is it didn't taste anything like taco soup.  It tasted like a much milder and blander chili.  I have to say I was disappointed and so was my husband.  Neither one of liked it.  To be honest I think this recipe is completely miss labeled and should and instead be called slow cooker chili but even then the recipe would need tweaking.

Excellent soup. I added a dollop of sour cream & didn't add diced tomatoes because my husband hates diced tomatoes. And only did half a can of green chile peppers.

Excellent. Subbed beef broth for the water. Used frozen corn in place of canned. Love Trader Joes fire roasted and diced tomatoes which add additional heat. Cooked up dry kidney beans and used them instead of canned chili and kidney beans. This recipe will definitely replace my old Chili Soup recipe. We loved it.

I made this a few times now and its a huge family hit :) It makes plenty and is great for freezing and reheating. We like to warm up leftovers and use it as a chip dip too. Its so simple! I used turkey burger for it this last time and it still turned out fantastic.

I followed directions exactly, cooking on low for eight hours. I find that the soup is on the blander side and needs a little more seasonings. My kids (4&6) do NOT like spice, and they really like this version. With a little more kick, it all blended nice and was a welcome dish to come home to.

Easy recipe. Made this last night. Used 1/2 lb ground turkey & 2 oz diced green chile peppers. Accidentally used 3 c water. Still came out great! Next time will use 4 oz chili peppers & a bit more ground turkey. Looking forward to having it for lunch at work.

I made this for Super Bowl sunday. Everyone loved it and had some of the guys going for seconds.
Made it exactly as is. Added one more chicken breast, because it was in the package from the store. Diced onion (my hubby likes uncooked onions too) grated cheese, tortilla chip crumbs, sour cream and diced avacados made up the add tos for those who wanted them. So easy and so good.

Made this for potluck, substituting Crumblers for the hamburger, and tomatoes with green chilies instead of separate cans. Good stuff! But I forgot to add the 2 cups of water - still good! Had a nice kick to it. Hey, no leftovers!! :-)

Excellent! Very easy to prepare. I cooked ground beef with taco seasoning as taco packet suggested early Sunday morning, then put all ingredients, except corn (my 14 yr old doesn't like) in 3 1/2 qt slow cooker. Just fit. 8 hrs later, yum! I did make it clear to my family this was a taco SOUP, not chili. They ate it happily with corn chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream as Janeen suggested. Seasoning just right. We all kept going back for more while watching football and it was all gone by the time I was going to make the entree! Everyone was full. Will definitely make again!

Had to give this recipe three stars because it was a little bland as is.  If I make this soup again, I will use fresh tomatoes (not as many) and kick up the heat with jalapenos.  Not a bad starter though.

Got this recipe from a friend and made it a couple weeks ago.  We agree with those who think the chili beans made it taste too much like chili.  You put it in your mouth and you get the chili flavor but, hey, it's not chili!  I'll stick to making chili as chili and use another bean in this soup if I make it again.

This was easy to make, but it tasted more  like chili w/corn in it than taco soup.  I didn't get the taco flavor even with following the recipe as written. The hubby loved it, but he thought i had made a new chili recipe, when i told him it was taco soup, he just said it was good chili that needed a bit more spice added. :) I like my chili recipe better, so probably will not make again.

We had this last night on a chilly, dreary night and it was so good, the whole house smelled wonderful.  WE all loved it.  Will definitely be making again.  May add some cumin next time.

I add rotel vs. tomato sauce and the Ragu cheese sauce.  I also add a package of Ranch.  I know, not healthy, but I only make this dish for parties and people rave on and on about it!

This was pretty good. The kids all liked it which is the big test in my house.  I browned the ground beef with the onions and added taco seasoning to that before throwing it in the crockpot.  I also only added 3/4 cup of water, but I don't even think that was necessary so next time i'll just omit the water.  And instead of tomato sauce I added the equivalent of my homemade enchilada sauce and also added garlic and cumin.  Great base recipe that you can customize to your tastes.

Didn't taste too much like taco but more like a chili with corn in it.  I made the adjustment of added an extra can of green chilis but wish I added a can of diced jalapeno to it to give it more of a kick.  I will probably make again but if I do I won't add the water, it was REALLY runny & it would be nicer to have it a little thicker & more stew-like.  Overall it wasn't that bad though.

Loved this recipe. Even my 6 year old picky daughter ate every bite. Super quick to throw to gether in the morning. Not spicy at all...even the baby ate it. If you like spice make sure to use hot peppers or cayane/chili powder with the taco seasoning.

My fiance loved this meal! I made it on a snowy day and he ate it for lunch and dinner, and again for lunch and dinner the next day! I took the advice of other reviewers and added half a packet of dry ranch even though I was skeptical that it would add the right amount of flavor. It's definitely the missing piece of the puzzle for this recipie--did everything else as written and was very pleased!

I accidentally added half the amount of diced tomatoes, and I couldn't find a 4 oz can of chile peppers, and had to just buy a larger can of jalapeno peppers and guesstimate.
This turned out really well! I didn't find it bland at all, but that's probably because I added a random amount of jalapeno peppers.

Great slowcooker recipe, we perfer black beans to corn, and didn't have any green chiles, so we used 2 cans of black beans, added the water from them, and followed the tip to add water.  We added one cup.  Used our own spices.  We're dairy-free, so we topped it with mashed avacado, and stirred in corn tortilla triangles.

this is a 5 star soup.  after reading the reviews, i made some modifications: omitted onions, substituted one can of black beans for chili beans, substituted one can of tomato soup for tomato sauce, reduced water to 1 1/2 cups.  Instead of 2 cans of diced tomatoes, i added 2 cans of Rotel original tomatoes and chilies (thus eliminated the separate can of chilies).  I mixed the taco seasoning in with ground beef according to directions on the package.  And finally, I added one package of dry ranch dressing mix to the crock pot before turning on.  The finished product was topped with crushed tortilla chips, shredded mexican cheese blend and a dollop of sour cream.  this is a restaurant-quality recipe.

Very delicious! Both of my picky eaters loved this! I substituted one of the diced tomatoes for chili ready tomatoes, and used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. Also instead of cooking the hamburger prior I just put it in the crock and turned it on high for a couple hours before turning it to low. The only problem with that is the soup is a little greasy.

This was a hit with my family.  I sauteed the ground beef with onion, taco seasoning and a packet of ranch seasoning.  Added to slowcooker with other ingredients and let it cook all day.  EASY for a busy weeknight!  Served with cornbread and honey and a cold glass of milk.

reminded me of chili a lot but still pretty good! i changed it a little by browning the meat and preparing with the taco seasoning before adding it. also decided using a can of beer instead of the water which added some good flavor, using only chili beans (we aren't a big bean family) and omitting the corn. Used a can of tomatoes with habenaro peppers added in, and one can with tomatoes and green chilies. Was spicy but very good. toped with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips. then sprinkled with chives. will make again!

I make this all the time and it always is so good. It's a lot of food too, if you don't adjust the servings and freezes well. I love that really the only cooking I have to do is browning the meat, which I like to do the night before so I can toss everything in before I go to work the next morning. I believe another reviewer called this more of a chili and I do agree with that but it doesn't change that we have this at least once a month if not more.

A staple for us.  Love, love, love it!  Serve with fritos scoops, cheese and sour cream.  AWESOME! I usually let it cook longer than it says.

Very good recipe!  A few changes to make it "great!"  Instead of plain tomatoes add tomatoes w/habanero peppers (I used rotel), brown beef with onion and taco seasoning also adding chili powder, cumin, and 2-3 garlic cloves, and definitely serve this soup with shredded cheese, crunchy fritos, and sour cream....you'll get RAVE reviews!

I just cooked this over the weekend. I was very good. The whole thing was eaten by the next day and my husband was upset it was gone before he was home from work.. I used ground turkey to be healthier & I cooked a quarter of the package of taco seasoning in it before throwing it in. Im cooking this again soon and I think I will use half the seasoning package on the meat...

What a hit with the fam! I make chili at least once a month and everyone was ready for something a little different. To me, it was just soupy chili, but the hubs and the kiddos all liked it better this way. Maybe it was the soupier consistency, maybe it was the taco seasoning. Either way, they've all asked that I start making this instead. My personal touches: I used extra-lean beef and browned it with the taco seasoning and onions (because I didn't have the time necessary for the onions to cook all the way in the crockpot). I also used beef broth in place of the water called for in the recipe.

WOW, this is one of the best soups I've eaten!  I made very little changes to the recipe, but did do the following; substituted a 14 oz. can of chicken broth for the water, used two 10oz cans of rotel for the diced tomatoes, added some diced jalepeno (I like it spicy) and as many suggested, added a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  It was so simple, after browning the meat it all went in the crockpot and 8 hours later we had a great meal.  I garnished each with cheddar cheese, some sour cream and tortilla strips and it made it that much better.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is so good. It is more of a meal. I served it with crushed tortilla chips that I ran under the broiler for about a min, and a dallop of sour cream and called it chicken fajita soup!

Use your favorite salsa (mine is chipotle) as a substitute for a can of tomatoes to give this recipe extra kick.  Its a rainy day staple!

This is a staple at my house.  I make this at least once a week.  I substitute 1 can hot enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and I use chili and black beans instead of kidney beans.  Personal preference.

Very good.  A bit too much for my crockpot (It's a 4 qt, I think), as it boiled over a bit at the end.  Good thing I was home.  I do believe I'll halve it next time--makes  a ton!  I froze a good portion of it and took some to a sick friend.  It has a good flavor, and if I wanted more of a chili, I'd say there should be less liquid, but since it's a soup, it works well.  I used some seasoning with the ground beef, and added the amount called for to the soup, so I used more seasonings than it called for.  I don't have onions right now, so I put in dehydrated onion and added onion powder.  Also tossed in garlic.  All in all, very easy and a good meal.  Thanks!

Great fall recipe!  And the best part is that you can play around with the ingredients to use what you already have.  I even threw in some elbow macaroni (to use it up) and it turned out great.  Typically soups like this taste better the next day - but by then, my macaroni had sucked up a lot of the liquid, keep this in mind so you can account for it. :)

I tried this the other night and it is very good. I think I followed the recipe to a 'T', except I used ground turkey instead of beef,just because I always do. It's sort of like a cross between chili and vegetable soup. Very good!

I have been looking for a slow cooker recipe for tace soup and love this one!  I accidentally added 1 can of black beans instead of kidney beans so then added a half a can of kidney beans to the pot in addition to the chili beans.  It turned out great. I'd probably make that "mistake" again as we love the taste of black beans and they cook down more than the kidney beans.

Fairly good.  I think next time I'll drain the corn and kidney beans to make it a little less watery.  It has a chili-esque flavor to it.  Quick and easy.

Yum and super easy.  I of course made variations as everyone does.  I added an extra can of chilies and corn and extra taco seasoning.  A can of black beans and El Pato (yellow can) instead of tomatoe sauce.  The ease alone gives this recipe 5 stars.

this was great but i did make some changes. i didn't add any water and i used frozen corn and 2 frozen chicken breasts instead of canned and beef. i also just added some chili powder, cumin, brown sugar, minced garlic and a cube of beef bouillon instead of taco seasoning. i let it cook on low all day, then added a can of beer and turned it up to high for an hour. really good!

LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers.  I cooked and drained the ground beef, then browned the onion in the beef fat and drained before adding to crockpot.  I also added a packet of ranch dressing mix and used black beans instead of kidney beans and used two cans of mexican rotel tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes.  

Served with shredded cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream and fresh chopped cilantro.

I would give it 3.75 stars. I used ground turkey. This is a "dump and mix" recipe as I call it. Easy! The soup gets more flavored as it sits/or next day. I did add some cumin as someone suggested. You could cook this on the stove fro 2-3 hours and get the same results.

This was really good and the first time I had ever heard of Taco Soup.  The recipe as given makes enough for me to divide it into four portions and freeze 3 of them for a later date.  I wasn’t sure it was going to taste as good as it turned out to, this is a keeper, and as others have said, I can’t wait for winter to come.  This will make for a great cold winter nights dinner.  The other thing I like about it is that it is very economical to make, always a good thing when you’re trying to be frugal, but eat well at the same time.

I've reviewed this before but I just had to do it again because the recipe was sent to me in my e-mail this morning and it reminded me of what a fabulous soup this is.  We have made this taco soup a bunch of times and it's such a hit each time.  It changes up the regular ol' nacho night and it's easy to eat on it for a few days in the slow cooker.  Thanks.

This is really good, and so easy to make, even my picky four year old enjoyed it. I used two cans of rotell instead of tomatoes and also added a packet of ranch dressing. I seasoned the ground beef with lots of extra cumin to spice it up. I think next time I will throw in an extra packet of taco seasoning and a can of black beans and it will be perfect!

This was very easy to make!~That was great!. I thought it was okay however, and really probably will not try it again except with some adjustments~needed more flavor to me, and I think two packs of taco seasoning would do that trick. I think that it would have been tastier by upping the taco mix to two packs.

Wonderful and so easy.  I make a few changes, I add, 1 pkg. lipton onion soup mix,  1 can refried beans,1 can rotel tomatoes, 1tblsp. ground cumin, and 1 can chili without beans.  Makes it a little thicker and double the taco seasoning mix.  I serve it with Jack cheese on top in the bowl and a dollop of sour cream.  I also serve Mexican cornbread with it.  Everyone who has had this soup raves about it and I always get requests for the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was super easy to make and has tons of flavor! I used ground turkey instead of beef and substituted some of the water for enchilada sauce. I also sauteed the onions with garlic before putting them in the crock pot. It turned out wonderful! I'll definitely be making this again!

This soup is very good! I cooked the beef the day before to save some time. I mixed in a package of taco season, chopped onions, chopped green and red pepper. The next day I just put the meat and other ingredients in the slow cooker. I mixed in another package of taco seasoning and used 2 cans each of kidney beans and corn, 1 can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno chiles and 1 regular can of diced tomatoes. I like my soup kind of chunky. However, I only used 1 can of chili beans. This was soo good and taste better each day.

I have made this several times. We really like it.   I have made it in the slow cooker, but also on the stove, for a quicker meal.  I also make it with chicken, which we like as much as the ground beef.

This is REALLY good.  I recommend using a can of Ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chilies - the variety with cilatro and lime - as one of your cans of diced tomatoes.  It made a really great soup AWESOME!

Oh so good!  I cooked the ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested AND added another packet in the soup when I was adding the canned ingredients.  I added a bunch of green chile powder (we're addicted to the stuff here) to each step.  This soup got better with each bite and was still better when I took it for lunch the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Deelish!!  made a few changes, 1. I omitted the corn (love by itself, not a fan in food) and added a can of black beans. used a bigger can of kidney beans since we love those too.  I also browned the onion with the meat. used less water than called for by about 1/2 cup and next time will probably eliminate it to make the soup more thick.  probably used closer to two packs of taco seasoning, i have a big one from Costco so I didn't measure. All and all a great dinner, I sliced avacado and put sour cream on top and had chips to crush in. Thanks!!

A great recipe for cold days. It is one easy and quick to go together when you are running late for work! I like to serve this soup in a tortilla lined bowl (just cut 3 or 4 slits in the tortilla and push into bowl) sprinkled with cheese.  Absolutely yummy!

Excellent, fast prep recipe that tastes great! Very easy to adjust to your taste. You can put this recipe together the night before, then just crockpot it the next day. My group loves hot 'n spicy, and thought the initial result was a little on the mild side. So we made a few adjustments and also used a few of the tips in the other reviews. Added more ground beef, substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes with Rotel diced tomatoes, used 2 packs of taco seasoning instead of 1, added some garlic salt and cayenne pepper. Also had Tabasco for each to add to their own bowl, along with the chips, sour cream and cheese.

This is such a yummy & easy recipe and I love that it is easy to customize, as the other reviewers have noted: you can change the kind of beans, add an extra can of corn, replace the tomatoes with Spicy Rotel.  It is all good!!  I do want to share that if you happen to accidently over spice it, like I did the first time I made it, you can add a can of diced potatoes, it decrease the heat and adds some heartiness to the soup.

Took the advice of a few reviewers and made these changes: 1) Use 1 bottle of Corona in lieu of water. 2) Used  1 can each of Mexican Rotel, Milder Rotel, Original Rotel. All of these already have chilis so  3)I added 1/2 of a 4oz. can of chilis and 1 TBS of minced jalapenos. 4) Added ranch dip. 5) Cooked ground beef with onion and packet of mild taco seasoning. My husband loved this recipe. I will definitely stick to using beer instead of water. It really brings the flavors together. Thanks for a simple and awesome recipe!

2015 Edit - I have made this soup with ground beef, stew meat, cubed pork, leftover rotisserie chicken and strictly vegetarian.  It is a great, versatile recipe.  My family especially loved the pork version in which I substituted hominy for 1 can of beans.  I love this soup!!!!!  It freezes well too.  I use all pinto beans, 2 taco seasoning packets and add the Ranch Dressing mix also.  Definitely a hit when I share with friends and family.

I substituted ground turkey and used a can of seasoned black beans instead of kidney beans, and used Rotel and homemade canned tomatoes in place of other canned tomatoes.  Also used jalepeno peppers for a little extra spice instead of chili peppers.  It was very tasty and recieved a nice response from my guests.  I froze the extras, will be great on a cold fall night!!!  I will make this again.  Thanks Janeen!

Super easy and tastes great. I drained the corn and beans. I used black beans instead of chili and kidney since that is what I had on hand. I used 4 TBS. of taco seasoning from my big container to equal the packet of mix. I can see where you can switch this up and personalize it easily. This is a great base recipe.

While I have used many recipes from this site (several very good), I felt compelled to write a review for this recipe.  It was wonderful in at least three ways -- it was extremely fast and easy to prepare, it was delicious (to teen & preteen kids too), it is full of nutritious ingredients.  I made a super simple vegetarian version -- instead of the ground beef, I used 2 pouches of BOCA crumbes (didn't even defrost before adding); and instead of chopping a fresh onion, I used just less than 1/4 Cup dried onion.  For serving we used a reduced fat shredded cheese (Cabot 50% Light) and then for another meal used shredded part-skim mozzarella -- both were yummy.  Sidenote: the 1.25oz pkg of taco seasoning mix is approx 4 Tablespoons if you're measuring from a larger container of seasoning.  This is the very first, of many many unsuccessful tries with slow cooker recipes, that we found a recipe worth repeating.  Brava Janeen!

I also use Rotel style(no salt added)tomatoes, no salt added tomatoes, and frozen corn to cut down on the sodium.  The taco seasoning I use is also low sodium.  Instead of water I use very low sodium chicken bouillon.  Herb Ox has a bouillon with only 5 mg of sodium per pkg. that makes 1 cup.  To lower the fat I use low fat or fat free Morning Star Farms crumbles.  It is frozen, already cooked, and no one has guessed it is a soy based product and no saturated fat.  I add a package of Dry Ranch Dressing to the mixture.  This soup freezes great and I usually make a double batch.

I'm thinking I should have added more chili peppers than I did to spice it up a bit. Otherwise, quite good. I also added sliced black olives (personal fave).

I made a vegetarian version of this and it turned out great! I substituted a 12 oz bag of morningstar crumbles for the cooked beef and added two extra cans of beans (one black, one pinto) as well as an extra tsp cumin and chile pepper, and reduced the water by 1/2 cup to make it thicker. Very spicy and good!

Really really tasty!  The only changes I made were to drain the corn, add a can of black beans, and add a little bit of fresh cilantro.  This was super easy and I had everything on hand.  Goes perfect with a batch of cornbread.

With a few modifications, this makes a wonderful chili recipe. It may be a fine taco soup, too, but I wanted to make chili.  I used 1 lb of ground turkey because I prefer it over beef.  I used 1 can of chopped tomatoes with jalapenos and 1 can of plain chopped tomatoes.  I drained the liquid from the kidney beans and corn, and also left out the 2 cups of water in the recipe.  As recommended by another reviewer, I used a taco seasoning recipe from this site submitted by Bill Echols.  After 7 hours of cooking, I added a mix of 2 tsp corn starch and 4 tsp warm water to thicken it up even more.  It came out very good!  Thanks for the great recipe and wonderful reviews.

I used black beans instead of kidney beans, low sodium taco seasoning, and a half package of ranch dressing. Topped with taco cheese and lowfat sour cream, this was a big hit with the whole family.  I will make this often and freeze it for lunches.

It was a good BASIC recipe.  Nothing special. It would probably be good for a party or something when everyone has different tastes, it's somewhat bland, but you can dress it up.  I think next time I will add cilantro, garlic, and cumin.  Maybe jalapenos instead of green peppers.  Pretty good!

This recipe makes alot of hearty soup.  I doubled it and was giving it away to everyone.  I used 1/2 gr. beef and 1/2 gr. chicken.  We don't like kidney beans so I didn't add them.  In a double batch I used 14 oz cans of these ingrediants:    I used 1 can chili beans, can of black beans, tomatoes n Jalepenos, stewed tomatoes with mild chili and mexican seasonings=all 14 oz. cans.  Then I added several 32 oz.  cans of chopped petite tomatoes.  I didn't double the corn and used frozen. The sour creme is but the cheese optional. My soup came out perfect.  You can mix and match to your tastes. It really is good recipe to play with.   My kids wanted me to thicken it and have it be a dip.

Yum, Yum!  This recipe is oh so easy. Throw it together in the morning, come home to a wonderful smell.  Even my 5 year loves this soup.  I only put in 1 cup of water to make it more like a chili.  I also threw in some sliced black olives.  Next time I will try with chicken.

Really good soup!!We think the sour cream and chips are a must!Used frozen corn instead of canned so I used a little more chicken broth to compensate for the juice in the canned corn.We don't care for kidney beans so I used Black Beans,worked great.YUM!!

This recipe is easy to prepare and tastes excellent.  I intentionally left out the chili peppers and everyone raved about how delicious the soup tasted.  My family loves it when it is served with tortilla chips.

Excellent recipe.  i did use the liquid from the beans, but did not add the extra water the recipe asked for and the consistancy was great.   i added the packet of ranch seasoning which gave it a nice flavor.  i also added 3 fresh hot green chili peppers...perfect if u like it spicy.

VERY GOOD, VERY EASY.  My friends liked it so much they had me make it one week later for the super bowl party.  It's more a chili than soup, but I prefer it that way.  I actually like it better than my favorite chili recipe.

This is great and so easy! Second time we made it we were out of green chilis and used chili powder instead. It was still just as delicious. Probably will just use the chili powder from now on. This is my wife's favorite recipe because it is so easy and yummy!

Yum!  We just finished eating this soup and my husband and in-laws thought it was great.  I prepared it just like the recipe said and it turned out wonderful.  It had just a little spice and was very filling.  We served some shredded cheese and sour cream on top with a side of chips and salsa.  Thank you, Janeen, for an easy, delicious meal.

This soup is very good tasting and easy to make. I did not add corn. We found it not a very good "soup", but really enjoyed it as a snack. Topped it with sharp cheddar & sour cream, & ate it as a dip with tortilla chips. Would not recommend it for a "bowl of soup".

Everyone loved this!  I put it in my crock-pot in the morning for my visitors to have for dinner along with some cheddar cheese bread.  I set out fritos, tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese.  I did leave out the green chiles because my husband cannot tolerate the heat.  I put them on the side so everyone could add them.  I also added about half a package of ranch dressing mix, as others.  My 13-year-old niece has already asked me to make it again! Thanks.

Fabulous!  Who cares if it's chili-like?  We heaped on the sour cream and shredded cheddar and ate it with tortillas (also very pretty added to the soup in thin strips over the sour cream and cheese).  My 4 kids LOVED it and I plan on making it for our neighborhood food circle.  Really good, thanks Janeen!

I was disappointed.  It did taste like chili.  It was good chili, but chili nontheless.
I added cilantro which helped.

This has a really neat flavor, the taco seasoning makes all the difference (I love spicy food, and used McCormick hot seasoning -- worked great).  Per other reviews, I used 1 cup of water instead of 2, and got a perfect consistency.  I also don't like chunks of tomatoes & peppers, so I pureed the tomatoes, peppers and onions before cooking, which worked out fantastic.  Will definitely have this again.

I made this soup for a few friends and it was a hit!  I substituted the beef for five chicken breasts, cut in chunks and slightly pre-cooked in a skillet.  It worked really well.  I wouldn't change anything about the rest of the recipe.

This is so good and has become a regular cold weather meal in our home.  Great for football games.  This recipe makes a lot and will feed a crown and is SO SO easy to make.  I did find that the taco seasoning gives it a rather tart aftertaste, so I added 1 TBSP of brown sugar the next time I made it and it was perfect!

This is a very easy and quick meal to make! I have made many variations of this soup and this one is good. I did add more tomato sauce and I think shoepeg corn would be better but really there probably isn't much difference. It is a little bland, so if you like it spicy you may want to add something to it. My husband and mom loved it, though my 3 year old and my 6 year old nephew wouldn't touch it. I loved it too and will make it in the future!

This soup is delicious.  Like chili, without the heartburn.  I used 1.5 cups water, the Ranch dressing mix, the sour cream, Italian style stewed tomatoes and shredded Cheddar, as per other recommendations.  May try using steak or beef chuck next time.  Cannot WAIT to make this again.  AMAZING!  THANKS!

I've made this several times now and my family asks for it over and over again.  I agree that it was a bit bland, so I added a can of Rotel.  It was much spicier the next day.  Chips and shredded cheddar made it perfect.

This couldn't be easier and there are lots of ways to make variations of it.  I used ground turkey and white beans.  My two year old loved it!   This is going to be a staple in my house.  It also freezes well.

Not great, I'm afraid.  Too watery and tart.  I expected a more well rounded flavor.  Will not make again.

This is a delicious, quick and easy soup to make! The only suggestion I would make is too add more water if you like it runny. Otherwise, it's a little bit more like a mexican chili. I like to top mine with crushed chips, cheese and avacado.

So so good! I've made this multiple times now. I sautéed garlic and the onions with the meat (I use ground beef or turkey depending on what I have). Instead of water I used chicken broth for more flavor. Also I add one packet of ranch seasoning with the recommendation of the other reviews. I haven't made it in my crockpot because it is so easy on the stove. Just let it simmer 30-60 mins. Would be great to have it ready when I get home from work so I'm sure I'll be using the slow cooker soon.  Topped with shredded cheese, avocado, and some cilantro and it is a filling and satisfying meal. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this last week but I didn't use a slow cooker, I browned my meat in my dutch oven then drained it and added the taco seasoning mix and water. I also didn't have canned corn so I used frozen. I didn't have any canned green chilies so i used a can of rotel. Other then that I cooked it on my stove and let it simmer on low about 30 minutes and it was great!!!

Love this for a windy cold day! This needed a little more flavor so I sautéed the ground meat with onion and garlic. Added the taco seasoning, chilies and extra chili powder and cumin. In the crock pot I had already put the beans (drained and rinsed the kidney beans) , tomato sauce (14 .5 oz), and corn (I used sweet white corn). I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, and 1 can of beef broth for more flavor. Did not add any water. Stirred in the meat and cooked on low for 7 hours. Oh my goodness!! The house smells soo good. Can't wait for leftovers because tomato dishes are even better the next day!

Tastes great! For the chili beans I used a can of Bush's chili starter. I also browned the onion with the meat(ground turkey). It was fine the way it was but it didn't quite have enough flavor for me so I added some more taco seasoning at the end.

This taco soup was ok.  It was hearty and the consistency was more chili than soup, but it lacked any punch.  The taco flavor is very, very mild - almost nonexistent - and the tomato flavor is much stronger.  If I made again, I would add more taco seasoning and diced jalapenos or something similar for some punch.  Best tip - throw in some tortilla chips; they provide a delightful crunch to an otherwise "soggy" soup.

I really loved the taste of this soup. I used my Instant Pot pressure cooker (30 minutes). In the future I would not add any water. I had to drain about 2 - 3 cups of water off of my soup. That may be due to using a pressure cooker so I didn't take off any stars for that since I altered the cooking method. I did take off one star because the soup was way to spicy for my kids. Next time I would skip the can of diced green peppers and would maybe just stir some into the adults bowl of soup. I did add one packet of Hidden Valley Ranch powder and instead of using chili beans and kidney beans I used pintos. I preferred those and imagine it didn't really alter the overall taste. I added shredded cheese, sour cream and a little salsa to the top and served the soup with baked tortilla chips. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loves it when I make this recipe. Instead of water, I use 1 bottle of Mexican beer and I go heavy on the taco seasoning. We top it with avocado, cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. So good.

Really good, really easy, really cheap. I made it exactly as written, and had a ton of leftovers I shared with coworkers the next day. The only thing I added was I had an avocado sitting around so I put half an avocado on top, really good.

While trying to find low-budget uses for ground beef (there are two of us and four pounds of it in our freezer right now!) I stumbled across this recipe and was instantly intrigued. Everyone else suggests chili, goulash, chili, bolognese, chili, CHILI... and that gets so boring. But taco soup I can make without having to buy lettuce for actual tacos! I had to change the tomato sauce for condensed tomato soup since that was what I had on hand, and also used plain pintos instead of chili beans with a tablespoon of my own chili seasoning. No green chilis because we don't like our food too spicy. Put it all into my slow-cooker and let it all sit togethr until it was time to turn on the machine, then let it do all the cooking while I went to work! All in all it came out pretty good, though it could certainly use some tweaking. Next time I'll skip the chili seasoning and just use two packets of taco seasoning instead. My favorite part is the ease of making and cleaning up, and how inexpensive it is to make.

Love this especially in cold weather. I don't add water (it's not necessary) and I use fresh jalapenos instead of canned chili's. Freezes well.

Added one cup of water. Cooked on low in crockpot for about 6 hrs. YUMMY! Topped with shredded cheese and ate with Frito scoops.

Good base recipe. To control sodium I used canned veggies without added salt and reduced sodium taco seasoning. Next time I make this I would either omit the water or cut down to 1c for a thicker texture. I think it needs a little more spice so next time will probably add a packet of ranch dressing mix.  However it is a good recipe just needs tweaking for my personal tastes.

Made this today and it was delicious!  Used 1 can of beef broth & 1 can of chicken broth instead of water.  Also used a small can of tomatoe paste instead of the canned tomatoes as I didn't have them on hand.  I left out the chili peppers also.  My husband loved it.

This was really tasty, and pretty simple to make.  I did make a few changes, based  on others' reviews.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and browned the turkey along with the chopped onions, as well as 2 cloves of garlic.  I substituted black beans instead of kidney beans, and rinsed and drained them.  To make the soup a little thicker, I used only 1 c. of water but added an extra 8 oz. of tomato sauce. To add some extra spice, I used canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Overall, I thought the soup was flavorful but certainly not too spicy.  I also added a package of ranch mix based on other reviews.  I will certainly be making this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and felt the soup tasted watered down (my husband agreed). Next time I will omit the 2 cups of water and just use the liquid from all of the canned ingredients. I'm sure doing so will make this a 5 star recipe.

I am not a slow cooker person but tried this and what a hit.  I used ground turkey and added noodles when serving.  Wonderful.  Would make it again and again. Didn't think about adding cheese but definitely next time.

this recipe is amazing and so easy to make. it did need an extra kick. it seemed a little bland so I added a little salt, fresh jalepenos, cumin, paprika, and chili powder. I only used 1 cup of water and also cooked the hamburger meat with the onion and minced garlic. afterwards I topped with cheese and green onions on top of Julio's chips...omg yummy!!!!

Someone made this at work for a soup exchange and I loved it so much I needed to make it for my family. So easy and incredibly delicious! Only changes I made were I used chile with beans instead of chile beans, I used a larger can of tomato paste,  I didn't add water, and I made my own taco seasoning from another recipe on this site (if you already have a lot of spices on hand it's easy to make). This soup makes great leftovers too! Make sure you add the sour cream, cheese, & chips when you serve it, to balance out the spices.

We had tacos last night and always have leftover meat so tossed the leftovers into a slow cooker and followed recipe, except for the beans which I omitted, and I omitted the canned green chilies and added a couple of fresh jalapenos instead. SO DELICIOUS!

OMG, this is so good that it lasts less than 24 hours in my house with just 2 people. I love when my husband sets it up before he leaves for work and I'm welcomed home from work with the spicy aroma! We like adding cheddar cheese on top or mixing in a little sour cream. My husband does both.

Very easy and delicious. I too, made a few teeny tiny changes to the original recipe.  For starters, I used ground chicken instead of beef. I also used Fiesta ranch seasoning packet. I added 1/2 can of diced jalapeños. I used Southwestern Corn, black chili beans, and chili kidney beans. My tomatoes were salsa ready which gave it a taco like flavor. I did not use water because I forgot. I browned the chicken with onions, garlic and the taco seasoning. Threw it all in a pot for 45 min on medium and that was it. Very good and will keep as a staple. Hubby loves it!

So as someone else mentioned -cook this the day before.  It tastes so much better the second day.

Also - forgot to buy the chili beans - so used one can of beans - imo it turned out better. I did add some garlic salt, cumin, and chili powder to make up for the beans, but missing 1 can made it very soupy.

Also - cheese on the end is a must! Great recipe made both ways.

My daughter hates chili, but loves this soup!! I don't eat beef, so I made it with ground turkey and added some taco seasoning while browning. We added shredded cheese on top and eat with some tortitos chips. Nice to make on cold rainy mornings and have ready by dinner!

We cooked this in a pot on the stovetop for an hour on medium high. Used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce since that was all we had. Did not add chili peppers. Subbed light red kidney beans for chili beans. My whole family liked it so much we had another bowel for a snack! A keeper in this house!

Just ate this for dinner tonight.  Browned the ground beef last night, and added the exact ingredients into my crockpot last night.  Started the crockpot early this morning, for 8 hours on low.  It was great!  My husband and 2 tween/teen boys really liked it.  Our toppings were cheddar cheese, sour cream, cilantro, avocado, fresh lime.  Served it with yummy freshly made corn bread (with butter & honey).  Will make again for sure!  Thank you, Janeen Barlow.

Yum! I was skeptical at first due to the beer in it but it was very good! I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes in green chile so I chopped a Roma tomato and a green pepper instead.

I love this taco soup! Quick and easy to make and you can use chicken instead of the ground beef.  Plus you can spice it up to make it your own.  It does taste even better the next day as the seasoning soaks into everything.  YUMMY!

I'm very much a beginner in the kitchen, and this was super easy to make and delicious!  It was a HUGE hit with my family.  We added some grated cheese and ate it with corn chips.  I refrigerated the leftovers, and the soup was even tastier the 2nd day.

I really like this recipe over all - although I only used black beans in my batch.  This makes a full pot and people really seem to like the flavour and taste! Its good with all the fixings like sour cream, cheese and taco chips or just plain by itself.  Enjoy!

One of our family favorites! Defiantly brown the meat with the taco seasoning as directed on the packet.

I also love Taco Soup, but I would add more Taco seasoning, and a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.

This recipe was so easy to make and has excellent flavor.  The only drawback is that it made so much.  Way too much for just me and my 5 year old.  No complaints though.  I plan on freezing some for the upcoming cold, autumn days ahead of us.

This was AMAZING! I  incorporated some of the suggested modifications. In order to make it a bit more chili-style, I only added 1 cup of water. My husband is a big health-nut so I also added added some yummy healthy ingredients. I substituted meat for "Lightlife vegetarian ground meat". I "browned" the meat with 1/2 of the taco seasoning, and sautéed onions and kale in olive oil and minced garlic. I put the other 1/2 of the taco seasoning in the pot, threw in some broccoli, and didn't include corn as it is just extra carbs and salt. I then added one chopped red pepper and substituted the canned chili for fresh roasted green chili. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours, but it probably could have gone for less as there was really nothing to "cook".  I topped it off with cilantro, avocado, and substituted cream cheese for "Greek Cream Cheese & Greek Yogurt" (you can find it at Costco.) Finally, I made my own tortilla chips by using low carb whole-wheat tortillas. I brushed it with a mixture of fresh squeezed lime and olive oil and baked it for about 10 minutes. It literally came out as the BEST meal that I have ever cooked! The next day, we used the leftovers for a yummy taco salad. This is the first review that I have ever written but I wanted to share these modifications for the rest of my health-conscious chefs out there!

I took the advice of others and substituted a can of tomatoes with chilies already added and added one can of tomato sauce in place of water.  I also sauteed the onion in a little oil, added garlic, spices (my own taco seasoning) and ground beef to brown before adding to the slow cooker.  Entire family was pleased with results!  Thanks!

Very tasty!  I added a bit of cooked orzo pasta.  I also added a bit of tomato juice to make it more like soup and less like stew.  Served it with a tossed green salad and french bread.

This was simple and easy. In the interest of good health and economy I substituted 2 each of chicken legs and thighs for the beef. Also, I used hominy instead of corn, since It was what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and simple. Next time I will make it a  little spicier though. Instead of taco seasoning in a packet, I'd suggest home made seasoning. The recipe for that can be found on this website, under Taco Seasoning I. Trust me, it makes all the difference :)

Delicious! Three out of four family members loved it, one wouldn't try it. His loss! I will definitely make it again. The only changes I made were 1) accidentally adding extra tomato sauce, 2)  substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar for corn juices as suggested by another reviewer, 3) using chicken seasoning in place of the celery seed (because that's what I had), and 4) reducing the chili peppers to our taste (just one:-). Great recipe for a beginner like me. Very simple.

I also found it a bit bland as is so I added a little extra taco seasoning, some crushed red chillies and a half pkg of ranch dip mix. You must add sour cream and nacho chips to your bowl... trust me it makes all the difference in the world! Delish!

Another favorite in this house. The last hour of cooking I throw a cup of rice into the steamer and once it's done I mix it in with the soup. It helps thicken it up a little and it's delish!

We are vegetarian and I used boca veggie crumbles as a substitute for the hamburger. I put them in a large pot and cooked them with the onion then I added everything else to the pot, I also substituted the water and used vegetable broth instead. I also added a splash of V8 as well. The end result was very good. We all loved it and I will be making it again for sure.

Instead of using water try using chicken broth.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper instead of using jalapeños like the others because of having young children eating.

Added taco sauce, in addition to the cheese and sour cream, to my portion when we sat down to eat. Gave it that little extra taco bite it needed. I also noticed mine was way more on the Chilli side than soup due to the lack of juices, but it came out great! Reheated well too.

I made this recipe and honestly don't find it all that impressive. It is simply a recipe for Chili Con Carne done in a crock pot. I will be sticking with my old Chili recipe in the future and not bothering with the 6-8 hour crock pot endeavor this recipe calls for. Additionally the taco seasonings are processed food additives I try to avoid in my cooking that can easily be substituted by using Cumin, Chili Powder and for some extra punch Siracha sauce.

Minimal preparation.. I made mine on stove-top in large stock pot and doubled most ingredients. I used Ro-tel tomatoes and spicy chili beans also. Everyone enjoyed.

One of the best taco soup recipes ever. I did adjust it a little. I used already cooked chicken and simmered everything over the stove. The great thing about this recipe is its so quick and easy. Its taste is very good, and you can adjust it from the meat you use, to the beans, to the amount of heat. Definitely a great recipe.

I LOVE this soup. It's always a big hit with my family and friends. I fry the beef up and add the tomatoe sauce and taco seasoning in with the beef before adding it to the soup. I don't use the onion or green chili peppers. I also decided to use canned beef broth instead of the water. Gives the soup more flavor. LOVE it topped with the sour cream, Fritos and shredded cheese.

This is a great soup that makes a ton.  I've made it several times now, and it never disappoints.  I use my own taco seasoning creation -but I make enough to be the equivalent of 1 1/2 packets of taco seasoning.  I usually try to find Mexicorn in the canned food aisle, and sometimes I skip the green chiles, only because I don't always remember to buy them.  I try to keep the ingredients for this on hand in case anyone suggests a get together on short notice.  I don't ever have to add the full amount of water because the liquid from the other ingredients takes up most of the room in my crock pot.  I love to serve this with crackers, or tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Sometimes we have beer bread with it, which is fantastic.
Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper!

I added the taco seasoning to the meat while I was cooking it.  Maybe next time I'll add some spicer peppers to it.  This soup is super simple.  My family really liked it.

This was not like soup. I would consider it more of a bland, thick chili. I had to add chili powder, cumin and hot sauce to make this flavorful.

Hands down, my #1 favorite find on this website. If I could give it 10 stars I would. I make it a little bit different every time though! Just depends on what I have on hand. I, too, brown the meat with the taco seasoning, and add a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning. My crock pot is small, so I ix-nay a lot of the water, and add 2 cans of chopped jalapenos, or chop up a few fresh ones and throw them in. It usually turns into an amazing chili by day 2. SO GOOD. I make it once a week lol.

I actually put a little twist on this and it came out great. First, I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used plain low fat yogurt instead of sour cream. And I also cooked my turkey with the taco seasoning in it. Loved it, and makes great leftovers.

Yummy!  I made this recipe exactly as written and it tasted really good.  It definitely has a kick to it and my kids didn't like how spicy it was.  The next time I made this I left out the can of diced green chile peppers and instead of using 2 cans of diced tomatoes, I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  It was a nice compromise because the all the flavor was there but not all the spice.  I can't wait to make this again!

Made this on the stove yesterday. My boyfriend's four year old is the pickiest eater in the world and once we convinced her to try it, even she loved it! I added Chile Lime Cholula sauce to mine and it was perfect! Everyone loved this soup and I'll definitely make it again.

I followed the original recipe, all the stated ingredients and amounts.  All I added in addition was about 1 tsp chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin, and salt to taste.  I did drain and rinse both cans of beans.  Many people stated they didn't add the water.  I guess if you want more of a stew that's fine, but I added the 2 cups of water and thought it was the perfect consistency.  Dollop of sourcream and some shreaded cheese on top it was yummy!  Kids ate it with fritos.  Also made some cornbread to go with it.  I simmered on low in 6 quart crock pot about 7 hours.  Next time I think I may substitute the chilli beans with garbanzo.  Great recipe!  Will be making this lots.  Thanks Janeen!

Love the premise of the recipe, The only one of her ingredients I actually changed is the beans - canned beans skeeve me out so I used dry beans. I also never buy seasoning packets - too much salt. So I put what is usually in one: ground cumin, little salt, pepper, garlic, chili pepper. And I added cilantro and green onions because I really like those. Dry beans to done with a couple hours on high then about 5 hours on low. Took to a potluck, they ate the whole thing, a six quart crockpot full.

I just made this recipe for Taco Soup and it is absolutely wonderful.  My husband and daughter love it and I do too.  It is so easy to make and adding the dollup of sour cream, shredded cheese and crumbled nacho chips is excellent.  I will definitely make it again.

This was great.. I did make one change though.. we had just slow cooked a bunch of boneless skinless chicken breast, so I sheaded it up and used it instead of the Beef. I also use homemade salsa unstead of the can of green chile peppers, because that is what I had on hand. I was very good.. Next time will will use the beef for a whole new meal..

I have made this recipe many times in the past three years. I followed the advice of other and it came out great. I made the beef just like I would tacos but added the onions. I used a can of tomatoes and chilies in place of the regular chilies as I like my soup a little spicier and it's easier. I added another 1/2 of taco seasoning mix to the slow cooker mixture for a richer taste. I also add shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream in each bowl before serving. I pair if with honey or jalapeno cornmeal muffins, tasted great with the soup!

One of my favorites! I added a packet of ranch dressing mix, and we always just use whatever beans are on hand- we didn't have chili beans, so we used extra kidney beans.

TheCcafe' I worked for made this every Tuesdayand called it Taco Tuesday. When we had left over I made Taco Salad with a base of lett, then the soup which was very thick, diced tomato on top along with french dressing and sour cream and surrounded it with Taco Chips. Never a bite left!! They seemed to like it better than the soup, because  as a soupit  just seemed to heavy. I am so glad to come across the recipe again.Thanks

I loved this recipe the same as everyone I have ever made it for! I do prefer black beans to kidney beans, but it is great either way!

My family LOVED this soup!! I added 1 cup of salsa to it and it turned out great :)  It's also really easy to double it and freeze some for later too!

This tasted like not-that-great chile. It was pretty tasteless. We have a way better chile recipe that we make.  This needed more spice and seasoning.

This is the best taco soup I've ever had!!! I used frozen corn instead of canned (since that's what I had available) and added a half cup of extra water.  I also added a little salt and pepper to add just a little more flavor.  Oh and I left out the onion.   I wouldn't change a thing!  I even left it going for 9.5 hours (unexpected long work day) and it was still perfect- didn't burn, beans didn't split, it was just perfect.

Added some extra peppers and this came out great.  It's a bit on the basic side, but that's the idea and it works great for a base to work off of and be creative.

This is really good!  I used soy crumbles instead of the hamburger for a vegetarian taco soup! Most people would never know the difference.   I also just cooked it on the stove and added a little cayenne pepper. Thanks for this great recipe!

I would give this a 6 star rating, if I could. The only thing I did differently was to use leftover spicy green chile pork, which is a recipe on this website also. I didn't have hamburger on hand. It was fantastic, and I think, restaurant quality. Way to go Janeen!

Pretty basic, easy to make.  i used turkey instead of beef and chopped fresh serano peppers to kick it up a little instead of green chile.  might be better with sour cream and cheese on top??? not sure, just feel like its missing something

Made this exactly as printed and took the taco seasoning recipe exactly as stated from the person who submitted the original recipe. I was not in love with this on the first day. I thought the taco seasoning was way too strong. HOWEVER, and that's with a capital "H" - I thought this got better and better as leftovers as the week went on. The flavors just needed time to meld.  Will make it again - terrific soup for a cold winter night. Thank you for the submission.

This was delicious! It makes a lot...I could barely fit all of the ingredients into my regular-sized crock pot. It was filled all the way to the top. I cooked it on high for a few hours then turned it down to low for an hour. I didn't have 8 hours of time when I made it. Very tasty!

My husband & I loved this.  It reminded of us of the flavors in the chili served at Wendy's.  We just used turkey instead of beef, pinto beans in place of the chili beans, and the tomatoes also had chilis in them.  So easy and quick to prepare and so delicious to come home to a warming bowl topped with corn chips, sour cream and shredded cheddar.  Yum!

we were having guests and so i decided to double the recipe.  it wouldn't fit in my medium crock so i slow cooked on the stove.  i substituted chili powder and cumin because i didn't have any taco mix.  well, what a hit!  fantastic and most definitely will be made again and again!

My family LOVED this.. I subbed 3 cans of Rotel in leu of 2 cans tomato and 1 of chili pepper and black beans for chili beans. It was spicy! I did add Ranch powder and brown sugar like some others posted. It filled my crock pot to the brim! **sidenote, if you leave it in the crockpot all night, it burns to the bottom and then you can't taste the leftovers :(

Great too come home to after a day at Disneyland!  Will add a package of Ranch Dressing next time (like others have suggested).  I also used two cans of tomato sauce and omitted the can of water.  I also used the diced tomatoes that included the jalapenos - we like it spicy.

Delicious soup! The only change I did is that I added a bit of salt because it was not salty enough for me.
Thanks for the recipe!

Good.  Had to change a bit to fit what was in my pantry.  Used 1 can ranch style beans, 1 can black beans.  No corn 1 1/2 C leftover taco meat from tacos the night before so omitted the taco seasoning.  Weight Watcher Points plus = 3 pts./Cup with the changes.  Not bad!

This soup was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did differently was add shredded chicken instead of ground beef, substitute black beans for the kidney beans and add 1 clove of minced garlic.

I found the suggestions from other posters helpful. The adjustments I made did not distort the original recipe. I prefer black beans to chili and thought it was a delicious exchange. I used 2 cups of homemade ketchup that I had on hand but in and of itself was thin so it was a perfect substitute. I would not think twice about using tomato sauce as the recipe called for. B/C I used 2 cups of my own tomato concoction, I reduced the water. I had fresh, frozen tomatoes but canned would be great, too. We don't tolerate spicy too well nor green peppers so I used fresh, frozen diced red, yellow and orange bell peppers. Even a friend who doesn't like soup enjoyed this recipe. Using things like ground deer or turkey and fresh instead of frozen would work well and allows versatility w/o compromising the overall point of the dish. Great recipe - thanks for sharing! Will definitely make this again!

This soup was quite good, but tasated more like a chili than a taco soup. It could have used a bit more taco flavor, but I still enjoyed it!

This was great! Only change I made was adding about 1 cup of brown rice the last hour of cooking to thicken the soup and add a little more substance. A definite keeper!

Delicious!! I really liked this! I used a can of rotel diced tomatoes with chilis. I left out the can of kidney beans, only used the can of chili beans, used frozen corn, used a homemade taco seasoning (from this site) and used chicken broth inplace of water. Seems like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't. Turned out fantastic!! Served with brown rice mexican rice!

The only change I made was I substituted 1 can of pinto beans for the chili beans, and only because I didn't have chili beans!  I salted & peppered the beef while cooking and used about a third of the taco seasoning on the meat.  Next time I won't do that because I couldn't drain the meat without losing the seasoning. :(  This taco soup was SO good!  We sprinkled cheese on top and ate it with tortilla chips. :)  I will definitely make it again!

This was pretty good! The comment about adjusting the amount of chiles is quite true. It had a good amount of spice. I added sour cream to mine though and ate it with tortilla chips and it was quite tasty. This one is getting filed in the "will use again" stash!

This was great, it was a cross between the texture of chili but a great flavor of the taco. I did add more spice such as cayenne pepper, flakes, and tapatio, overall wonderful!

Delicious. I was afraid to make this because I'm not too fond of the packaged taste of packaged taco seasoning, but this soup does not have it. I suppose that the slow cooker cooks it out. Will make this again.

SO good, and really not bad in calories, either. I didn't use chili beans, I had kidney beans and black beans, so I used those. SO tasty! Everyone loved it!

I have made this soup a few times and it is amazing.  I find that I crave it from time to time.  I make in on the stovetop with gilled or boiled chicken.  One of these days I will have to try it in the slow cooker.  Very tasty just the same.

I loved this, and so did my fiance. I didn't have ground beef so I used ground turkey, but I don't think that made much of a difference to the taste. It's going into the rotation for sure!

Amazing!  I didn't add the water, so it was more like taco chili and used ground turkey.  My entire family loved it.  We topped it with crushed tortilla chips and cheese.  Delicious.

Great soup, definately add taco seasoning to ground beef before adding everything else. I added black beans instead of chili beans and reduced the water to 1 cup. Served with shredded Monteray Jack cheese and crushed whole grain tortilla chips. Will be making this again.

Delicious!  I wanted to make it last minute, so I cooked it on the stove and it still turned out great.  I just brought the ingredients to a boil and then simmered for a half hour.  The sour cream really made the difference in this soup for me!

Wonderful! Really tastes like a taco and so easy. I used black beans, left out the chilis (not a family favorite). Everyone loved it. Have made it twice with rave family reviews! Also good way to use crushed corn chips in bottom of bag.

Delicious! Very flavorful with just enough zip. The only substitution I made was to use a 15 oz. can of yellow hominy instead of the whole kernel corn. This change gave the soup a yummy, more authentic taste.

very good.  used ground turkey and added tortilla strips.  also seasoned the meat with some garlic, cumin and chili powder and cooked with the taco seasoning.  Instead of the suggested tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with green chillies and I used fiesta corn instead of the plain corn - both add lots of extra flavor.  My family enjoyed!

I made this and it turned out great. It was easy for me as a beginner cook. I added a can of black beans and also cooked the meat with a packet of taco seasoning as well as adding a packet in the slow cooker. Fantastic!

Good soup, but not great.  Wish I would have cooked the meat with the seasoning and maybe even tried the ranch I noticed some added.  Added a little hot sauce which helped as I was eating it.  Will try again, but maybe use beef broth in place of water and add a few more seasonings.

This is great "As Is"...no altering required. I'm giving it 5 stars based on that alone. No changes are necessary to make this a keeper. Another great thing about this recipe is that if you want, it lends itself to modifications very well too. For instance, I used 1 can pinto & 1 can of red beans. I used hominy instead of corn, because...well, I think hominy is a fun starchy thing and it has a "taco" feel to it. To pep up the flavor, I added 1 cup of salsa & 1/2 a small packet of ranch dressing mix. What I liked about this was that the finished soup had more of a "soup" feel to it and less of a "chilli" feel.

Yummy soup! It was a hit in our family. I mostly stuck to the recipe, but added a little more canned chile peppers. We will be putting this recipe in the dinner routine!

The original recipe was very bland and didn't fill my crock pot, so the second time around I made some changes. Instead of chili beans I used 1 can of black and 1 can of pinto beans. Furthermore, I sauteed the chopped onion with garlic in butter before browning my ground beef (which I increased to 1.33 pounds) in the taco seasoning. Since I was increasing the recipe, I added 1/3 of a packet of burrito seasoning that I had laying around as well. I also doubled the amount of tomato sauce and added an extra 15oz can of diced tomatoes (I used one pre-mixed with celery and some other things). I also added another 1/2 a can of green chiles (I used the the other half to make Absolute Mexican cornbread) and seasoned the soup with loads of cummin and "Nature's Seasoning" (I also added a good amount of paprica and a little bit of oregeno). If your chili doesn't come out as spicey as you like, I also reccomend that you add chili pepper.   My most notable addition to the recipe, was instructing my guests to add sour cream (the more the better!), crushed corn tortilla chips, shredded cheese, and a handful of cold chopped white onions that I had prepared for them. This made the soup creamy, thick, and crunchy - PERFECT!   Don't be afraid to prepare this a full day ahead of time: the longer the ingredients mix together the better! I cooked the soup in my slow cooler on low for at least 12 hours, but it was still even better reheated the next day (Not that my guests left very much!).

This was very good but I think it can be tweaked a bit. The taco seasoning mix made this soup VERY salty...too salty for me. I would suggest seasoning it yourself with chili powder, cumin, coriander, salt, pepper, however youd like, or just use a mexican seasoning blend.  Also for those concerned about gas from the beans- I suggest draining and rinsing the beans as much as possible as it is the liquid that cases folks to get gassy and bloated.  Finally I think its a good idea to add a little extra water or tomato with liquid since the beans absorb quite a bit. You can also do this before serving. This soup does not need to set for 8 hours. 5-6 is perfectly fine. Its delicious with melted cheese and broken tortilla chips on top!

I'd say this is more like a chili than a soup, but it was still worth 5 stars.  I followed a few reviewers suggestions and used beer instead of water, and instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of tomato soup.  I also added some green onions while sauteing the meat.  I'll be making this again for sure this winter!

It was really good. I'm a college student so I made everything up in the morning, threw it in the crock pot, and was able to serve it up to my roommates that night. It is a really cheap meal to make, everyone loved it.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  I have a batch cooking in my crock pot right now :).  I've made this several times.  My family of five loves this as a hearty, satisfying dinner.  It makes a lot, and the leftovers reheat beautifully.  I only changed one thing.  I didn't have any ground beef on hand, so I threw in some frozen sirloin cubes instead.  They were falling-apart tender at the end of cooking time, and they were a delicious change!  To sum it up, this recipe couldn't be easier, is hearty and filling, and inexpensive to make.  Two thumbs up!

Made this for dinner last night..it was a BIG hit with my husband and my parents! Super easy to make (didn't change a thing) and the aroma fills up the entire house!  Can't wait to make this in the fall/winter with Mexican Cornbread. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my kids.  None of us thought it tasted like a taco, but oh well.  Super simple to throw together.  I only had 2 hrs, so I browned the meat and onions then let it simmer for 2 hrs on the stovetop.  Perfect with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream on it

This is pretty much chili but very good. I added a pinch of cayenne, used frozen corn, garlic and only used one cup of water. I wish I would have gotten spicer green chile peppers I think I got the mild kind. B-f liked my chili better than this recipe but I would make this again if I didnt feel like cooking on the stovetop. Thx!

Tasty but does not elicit a "wow".  It's certainly better than any canned soup.

Very good soup... but I did make some changes.  I didn't put any beef in it (it was our vegetarian night), so I skipped the onion also.  I used two cans of tomato sauce and only one cup of water.  I used black beans instead of the kidney beans, and next time I would use two cans of the black beans.  If the ground beef would have been in there, we would probably only use one can of the black beans.  Very good recipe, I will definitely be making it again!!!!

I made this for my son and daughters birthday party and everyone went nuts over this.  Another great soup for a cold day and great to make for parties.  Easy recipe because you just throw everything in the crock pot and let it simmer all day.

loved it, it was so easy to throw it all in that morning and it was done in time for dinner that night. I didn't change anything and it was great as written. We topped with sour cream, cheese, salsa, and served it over chips. Mmm..

Like another person, I added 2 packs of Hidden Valley Ranch dry seasoning.  Definately have to have the tortilla chips and sour cream and some shredded cheese.  Yum!

LOVE IT! This was delicious.  So quick and easy to make.  I made a few changes.  I used 3 cans of rotel mild diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of adding green chiles and filled the empty can twice with frozen corn.  I don't like the taste of canned corn.  I   added 1 package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  I did rinse and drain the black beans (used in place of kidney beans) but didn't drain the chili beans.  I also added a clove of minced garlic and a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I subsituted a can of condensed tomato soup in place of the tomato sauce.  Cooked on high in crock pot for 2-3 hours.  I made this recipe for my church at a soup get together and all of it was eaten.  I even received a comment that this soup was "the bomb".  Definitely better topped with sour cream and crushed fritos.  Even better the next day.  This has been added to my recipe file.  Thanks so much for the awesome recipe Janeen!

Great EASY, hardy soup.  Will make this again for sure.  We served with tortilla chips, cheese, fresh tomato and avocado just to add some variety but this recipe will stand on its own as well.

Probably the best soup i have had in a long time! My dad is the family cook and we were getting tired of cooking the same things over again, so we tried this. We followed the recipe, but we also added 1 cup of chicken broth in place of 1 cup of water. He also added fresh sweet corn (not canned) as well as a can of black beans and fresh chopped jalapenos. If you like zip to your food then add these extra ingrediants to your pot. We lastly used a half pound of ground beef and a half ground turkey, and a pack of ranch dressing.

This taco soup is awesome!  We eat this pretty regularly.  So easy, good for you, inexpensive...what else can you ask for?  I use ground turkey when I make this, and even BF who (always) prefers beef loves it.  I've made in the crock pot and also on top of the stove - great both ways, but don't use as much water as it calls for. I find if I cook it on top of the stove it thickens up a little with time. Love the addition of chips, cheese and sour cream.

I followed the recipe exactly because it was my first time making it- delicious! Husband ate it when he got home and kept it on low for me and I ate about 3 hours later...it held up well and we both loved it! I also made some cornbread to go with it, so put a chunk of that in the bottom of the bowl and topped with the soup/chili...yum! Thanks for sharing- definitely a keeper!

WE LOVED THE SOUP!!!! it was a little spicy for my son, but my husband and i chowed down on it. We did add ranch mix and the taco seasoning to the meat while it was cooking. Great recipe, now a regular favorite in our home!

We LOVED this recipe.  I calculated it for 4 because I have a two quart slow cooker.  I added a can of black beans instead of the kidney and chili beans and tomato juice instead of sauce (was out of sauce) Ate it on broken up tortilla chips and cheese and topped with sour cream.  Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing.

We liked this soup, but I must agree with some of the other reviews: This soup tastes like chili. That's OK for me because I LOVE chili.I added an onion and some olives. Also I used only a half pound of meat.

Sour cream is a must for this. My husband said tasted like chili, but that we should change it to be our regular chili recipe.

Great soup, I followed the recipe with two exceptions I replaced the corn with a can of mexicorn,I replaced the 2 cups water with a 14oz can of chicken broth. YUMMY!!! my wife loved it and the leftovers were even better two days later I had my neighbor over for lunch and had to e-mail him the recipe he loved it.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count since finding it on this site several years ago so I thought it was about time I rated it. FANTASTIC ! Easy to throws together when I'm home for my lunch hour and dinner is ready when we get home. It's always a hit. The only changes I've ever made are the addition of extra peppers to our hotter than normal humans taste. We serve it with a large bowl of Fritos Scoops and the spoons hardly get used. Great weekday recipe, especially in the cold months.

oh my gosh! This is AWESOME! I added hominy for an added flavor. I have made it as written and then when budget runs tight I have made changes. I cooked the hamburger with the taco seasoning. I think it has a little more flavor that way.

This taco soup is AMAZING!!! I have made it for the third time today and my family loves this taco soup! The only change I make is I add an extra taco seasoning packet, I add a bit of red chilli flakes and some garlic salt. I also LOVE the fact that it is so simple to prepare. It takes me about 15 minutes to brown the hamburger and open all the cans and toss them in the crock pot in the morning. Then, when I come home,dinner is done. Who doesn't like that?

Fantastic! This is a great winter recipe! Warms you right up. My husband loves it, and for awhile we were making it once a week!  I did make a few changes to the recipe after reading other reviews. I used two packages of taco seasoning, one mixed in with meat. For the diced tomatoes, I used the celery, onion, and pepper mix. I make a chili recipe that is very similar to this one, so instead of using kidney beans I substitued black beans. I also added cumin and a bunch of ground red pepper for an extra kick. Top with shredded cheese and serve with fritos.

My husband and I both love to cook, so it is hard to impress each other since everything turns out good.  This did it for me!  I usually serve with Zucchini quesadillas (which work well, by the way, even for my veggie haters.  Everything tastes better if it has enough cheese on it!)

I really liked this recipe. I made some adjustments after reading the comments. I added two cloves of garlic and half of the onion when I cooked the meat. I also added some worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, cumin and paprika to the meat. We really loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  Some changes I made - used black beans instead of chili beans and ground chicken instead of ground beef.  We topped with cheese and added chili powder to our bowls to adjust the heat to our tastes.  Outside of this sodium (and the added cheese), this is a hearty, healthy meal!

This recipe is so easy to make the night before then just start your slow cooker while you are at work.  When you come home it is ready to go with shredded cheese, sour cream and some corn chips.  The recipe also makes a lot so you have lunch the next day.  I was super happy with the results!

This recipe was extremely salty...I think it was because I added a cheap package of taco seasoning to the mixture in addition to the meat. I probably won't be making this for a while.

This soup is great!  On occasion I omit the chicken for just a veggie soup and I use frozen corn instead of canned and add it only in the last 10 minutes of cooking so it stays somewhat crisp.

Pretty good! I made it on the way out the door for Sunday morning church service. Left it on low, only to find that when my dad walked by and saw it, he turned it to "keep warm." Urg! As you can imagine it wasn't at its best. BUT, I turned it up and let it cook some more. Then we had it for leftovers the next day and it was very good. All the flavor had been allowed to cook in then.

To me it tasted just like Wendy's chili. I agree with others this is a good base recipe. I think you should add what you like. It would be yummy with chicken instead of beef.

This recipe tasted more like a chili than tacos although my young children and husband loved it.  I skipped the 2 cups of water and made it thicker and when I served it, I added grated cheese on top with a dollop of sour cream and a dollop of guacamole and served chips with it....this made it a little more like tacos to me.  I'll probably make it again because it was so easy.

I agree with the person who said this is chili, but it's a very good chili.  I found a can of tomatoes with green chiles and used black beans and kidney beans.  Also used a little less water, just the amount needed in the cans to rinse them.  My husband makes a great chili, but he said mine is almost as good as him.

This recipe gets top stars!  Incredibly fast and easy, and you can't mess it up.  Mine comes out different every time because I rarely have the exact same items in my pantry.  But EVERYbody loves it every time.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor! Easy to make. I took the advice of another and made in a dutch oven instead of slow cooker...much quicker! Also, I only added about a 1/2 cup of water instead of the 2 cups it calls for. To me this is another rendition of a chili, I suppose if you added the water it would then be a soup. I also used lean ground beef as well as ground turkey. Served over tortilla chips with grated cheese, sour cream and chopped jalepenos. Very good!

I was surprised how much this tasted like a mild, soupy chili.  The flavor is good, but it could definitely use more seasoning - chili powder and green chiles.  Next time, I might omit some or all of the water for a thicker consistency.

Great recipe.  I used moose burger and Jalepeno diced peppers rather than green chili peppers.  WOW, too hot.  I added ranch dressing mix per suggestions from others.  Did not notice a difference but maybe the Jalepeno peppers killed the ranch taste.  Also used creamed corn rather than whole kernel corn because that is all I had.  Seemed to be ok except you can't see corn in the soup.

This recipe was so easy!  The other reason why I liked this so much was because you could have these ingredients in your pantry whenever you wanted to make this.  I used ground chicken and sauteed that with the onion.  I also added some of the taco seasoning to the meat and the remainder to the pot.  One thing I did that I felt added a ton of flavor was chop up some fresh cilantro and top the soup with the dollop of sour cream and chips, as the recipe says, but sprinkle each bowl with some fresh cilantro.  It was delicious!

This was very tasty but not at all spicy (even though I used "spicy chili beans").  I did not add any water and it was still very liquid.  I'm taking the rest of it to a potluck tonight and think I will drain off the excess liquid so it can be eated on a plate.

I absoultely love this soup. I used only black beans though. I don't like kidney beans so I omitted them. I think I put a little more corn than called for also because I simple adore corn. My husband and I gobbled this soup up. A friend even stopped by on this day (not a planned visit). We offered her some soup and she ate two bowls! Fabulous! I highly recommend it!

Very tasty and super easy recipe to make.  I cooked the onions first before adding the beef.  Cooked thoroughly and then added the remaining ingredients and transferred to crock pot.  I have also substituted one of the cans with black beans.  I added a package of Ranch dressing (the dry mix). It seems to give it a really nice flavor.  This recipe is pretty versatile.  You can use ground turkey to make it healthier.  Great meal to make ahead of time and easy to alter so you can feed a large crowd.
Thanks

A staple for me and my family.  I substitute a small can of rotel tomatoes for the green chiles.  I also add one envelope of ranch dressing mix, which really kicks up the seasoning.

Delicious & very hearty.  I added a can of black beans and omitted the cans of diced chiles so soup would not be too hot for my little dudes.  Very flavorful.

I will definitely be making this again!  My husband loved it and was craving more the next day.  We ate it a spoonful of sour cream and cheese on top, with tortilla chips of course.  It's also very good with rolls.  Makes great leftovers!

This recipe deserves so much more than five stars.  It tastes great, is extremely easy, and is also good for you.  What more can you ask from a recipe?  Although excellent as is, I only made some changes because we love lots of heat.  I use Old El Paso "hot and spicy" taco seasoning, canned diced tomatoes that include jalapenoes, and add approx 1/4 cup (maybe more, have never really measured) of diced jalapeno peppers that you can find in the pickle/relish section of your grocery store (another time saver).  Once it is ready to serve, break up tortilla chips and put over the top with some shredded cheese, and corn muffins on the side (also made with jalapenoes), and ta-da.  Thanks Janeen for such a great recipe to add to my favorites!

Wow!  This soup was so easy and tasted so good!  The hardest part about making this soup is having to wait to eat it!  The great thing is you can make it as spicy or mild as you like by using different degrees of spice available through the ingredients.  Awsome served with home fried flour tortilla strips sour cream and fresh avocado.  Thank you so much for this recipe we will enjoy it for a long time!

This was pretty good. Not as much flavor (or kick) as Id like but that could be because I don't use taco packets due to the sodium content. I instead substituted cumin & chili powder. Next time I will use more cumin, add a chopped jalapeno or two, and more onion. Boyfriend ate his only with grated cheese, but I had it with a dollop of sour cream, grated cheese & crushed tortilla chips. If you ask me it made the dish so much better! The second day we ate it over rice, which stretched it out. We had this for two dinners (one with two helpings each) and a lunch. The only thing I would add (on top of the other additions) is some chopped CILANTRO with the sour cream, cheese and crushed chips. I think this would make it a 5 star. Oh, I also used ground turkey.

I loved this. I am not the biggest fan of thick types of chili, not that this is chili. But I used all black beans because I wasn't sure what type of chili beans the author meant. I loved the corn in it, what a twist. I just have to say this was so fabulous. I will be making this instead of chili!!

Mmmmm! We loved this. Of course, my boyfriend dumped a ton of hot sauce into his, but it was just perfect for me. I omitted the onion, and browned the meat with a clove of garlic. I realized I didn't have any chili beans, but I did have chili ready diced tomatoes. So I used those and 2 cans of kidney beans. Served topped with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Yum!

This is a very good recipe for the person at work all day. I am not a bean person so I only added 1 can of kidney beans, I didn't add any water at all, I also followed others advice and added cumin and chili powder.

This recipe is fabulous, easy and versatile!  
HEALTHIER OPTION:
I prefer to add fresh veggies, chopped(carrots, celery, mushrooms, zucchini)  I subtitute ground turkey for the beef.  This is great served over tortilla chips, sprinkled with nutritional yeast and with a dollop of plain yougurt.  I have not served this for anyone that did not absolutely LOVE IT!!!

We love this recipe! I make it all the time for my husband and two daughters. I only use one can of crushed tomatoes instead of the two cans of diced since we are not tomato fans. We top it with Fritos, sour cream and shredded cheddar and eat bowl after bowl!

this is a great recipe! I cook it on the stove(simmering) for a couple of hrs. its a large recipe for myself so I usually give some leftovers to friends. all my friends love it! it freezes well but I like sharing the love.
changes Ive made: brown beef with a few cloves of minced garlic. add an extra half cup of water or so to keep it  less thick in the end. I use an extra 4 oz can of sliced jalapenos & half a red & green pepper chopped. I use one pack spicy taco seasonig and half a pack regular seasoning. I serve over whole wheat tortilla chips. topped with cheddar & cilantro. wonderful dish & soooo easy. thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as the directions said, and it was phenomenal!  To serve, I crunched up a handful of frito's and put them in our bowls before laddling the soup over.  I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of shredded taco cheese.  We loved it!  Very simple, and very good.

I've never had taco soup before and i've never made it either, but i figured, i like tacos and i like soup so i'll give it a try. i prepared this as described minus the beans because I'm not a fan. The taste is good. I'm a salt and seasoning person and I don't think its bland at all. Like many have said, for a thicker stew consistency, use less water. I will make this again but next time I will add the corn in the last hour.

This soup was a huge hit at a big pay-per-view fight party we had over the weekend.  My husband had all of his buddies over and they downed it fast!  I made just a few changes to the recipe - based on other reviewer's ideas.  
I added an additional pound of ground beef, used 2/3 c. bulk taco seasoning instead of one packet, an additional can of chili beans, a can of black beans, an extra can of corn and 1 packet of ranch dressing mix.  I didn't want to change the ingredients much, just needed more, but didn't want to double so I improvised.  I mixed everything together in a big bowl first and then poured it into two crockpots (one 6 quart one 4 quart, I think).  I didn't add the corn until about 2 hours before I served it.  The result was delicious!  Very easy to add to without compromising flavor. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I love this soup!  I thought it needed a bit more spice, so I added a very small amount of chipotle seasoning.  I also added a hand full of frozen corn in the last few minutes of cooking to add some sweetness.  It was so great!

My daughter and I LOVE this! I don't add any of the beans because I hate beans. I also omit the water because I wanted it to be more like chili and less like soup. The next time I make it I am going to put the corn in when it's done so the corn stays sweet.

I made this in the middle of the night, and my husband started eating at breakfast time! Whole family loved it, but I threw in a couple of tablespoons of chopped jalapeno, I used salsa instead of tomato sauce and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce. I served with cheese, sour cream and corn chips! YUM!!!

Excellent soup!  I like thicker soup, so I only add one cup of water.  I took someone's suggestion and I put in half a packet of dry ranch dressing mix. I also double the taco seasoning.  I love serving this with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and Fritos!

I am not big on the tomato sauce broth, but I make my own version of this soup and use a can of red enchilada sauce and it is delicious.  With this sauce there is no need for adding chile powder.  We love this recipe.

So simple and so effective.  I used 1 can of Ro-tel and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chilies, then I skipped the can of chilies.  Have sour cream, cheese and plenty of corn chips to crush and put on top.  Awesome cold weather soup.

Just what I was looking for! I used chicken instead of beef, and substituted one can of Rotel for the green chiles. Super recipe that everyone in my family enjoys.

The only change I made with this soup, is I only added 1 can of kidney beans.  It was still awesome!  I served it over rice for some of us, and tortilla chips for the rest of the family.  The leftovers are great, too!  Thanks!

My friends and I baked this for a spanish project. It came out pretty good... it basically tasted like chilli. We served it with shredded cheese and tortilla chips.. which are both a must. We didn't add the 2 cups of water, and we were glad that we didn't. Overall, a good recipe.

Use half the water to make this soup more like chille. Best severed over a bowl of tortillas and topped with shredded cheese. I served this at a party and EVERYONE loved it!! One of my favorite entertaining dishes!

I took other reviewers advice and cooked the burger w/ one seasoning packet and put a second one in w/ the rest.  Perfect amount of seasoning! And also did not add any of the water as suggested, again, perfect amount of liquid.  A very good chili consistency & flavor. Served w/ corn chips & cheese on top.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this soup however I made one small change. I substituted ketchup for the water. It gives the soup a richer tomato flavor that we really liked.

A great dinner idea that every one of my picky eaters loved!  I used canned tomatoes that already had chile peppers, so I didn't add any extra.  I also used 2 packages of taco seasoning and cut the water in half.  Sour cream, cheese and chips are a must.  Terribly fatting, but terribly good!

I didn't have time to use the crock pot so I cooked it on the stove. I used canned pinto beans and left out the chili beans and kidney beans. We added shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream to the top. This was very good and dinner was on the table in 30 minutes. My kids liked it too.

This is such an easy recipe (though with all the cans it makes a lot of trash!) and it is so very, very good.  I want to show my young teens how to make this so they can make dinner for us now and then.  It would be a good recipe for a beginning cook.

This is a great soup!  After putting in the ground beef, onion, and all the canned ingredients I had no room in the slow cooker for more than about 1/2 c. water.  However, it turned out we liked the consistency as it was.  I topped it with some corn tortillas that I cut into strips and fried, as well as shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  I had never bought chili beans before and didn't really know what they were like, so I bought mild.  Next time I would get spicier beans or add more taco seasoning or Ro-Tel tomatoes as others have suggested.

This was wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that I added only 1 can of chopped tomatoes and substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the other.  I also drained the corn first.  I also added more taco seasoning.  For such an easy recipe - a can of this and a can of that, the flavor was really great.  I topped with shredded cheese and sour cream.  I've been eating the leftovers all week.  Thanks!

To bland for us, but after we added red pepper flakes it was a keeper. I did drain the corn, but that was the only change from the original recipe.

This is a favorite when I substitute chicken for the beef. No need to brown - just throw in with all the other ingredients. Chicken will shred easily after cooking for the full time. I also reduced the water to 1 cup to make it thicker.

This was a good recipe, but we weren't over the top nuts about it.  Like some others stated, it definitely needs some added zip.  We added more chili powder and then put in hot sauce just to give it some kick.  Good recipe, though, and will make again.

Pretty good.  I didn't have enough room in my crock to add the water, so I just left it out.  Other than that, the only change I made was the addition of garlic when browning the beef.  Served with fritos, sour cream, cheddar, and green onions for a hearty meal.  I like that it makes a big batch because it's good for freezing.  Thanks.

This is a great soup.  The only change I make is to omit the water.  I forgot to put it in the first time and found that it doesn't need it.  You have to have corn chips, cheese, and sour cream to serve with.

I threw this together at 1:30 in the morning.  By dawn, the house was filled with a great smell and I had a little soup for breakfast!  I used ground turkey, which lowered the fat and calories, of course.  I wish I had followed other reviewers recommendation on adding another packet of taco seasoning.  Compared to other chili recipes I've prepared, this was a tad light on flavor.  In retrospect, maybe I should have added some salt.  I did add a few shakes of hot sauce, which seemed to bring the recipe into it's own.  I'm giving the recipe a four, only because I've had better chili type recipes--but for economy, ease of preparation, and taste, this recipe is very good.  One could do a lot worse.  Enjoy!

This was good, but I am only giving it 3 stars because to me it was just chili.  I added more taco seasoning but didn't taste it. It was still a good chili and easy to make, but needs more spices.

I LOVE this recipe!  I serve this will Fritos on the bottom of the bowl, then the soup.  And I have lots of topping options and everyone helps themselves.  We have olives, green onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sometime guacamole.

This was easy and delicious.  All things I had in the cupboard.  I added jalapeno peppers and cajun seasoning for more spice and everyone loved it.

SCRUMPTIOUS! We loved this recipe. I didn't have kidney beans so I used more chili beans. It was wonderful! I give it 5 stars and then some! So easy too. You can make it easier on yourself by browning the meat as you buy it and then freeze it. Then it's already prepared for the right amount portions needed. Less fuss and a quick to do meal! :)

This recipe is wonderful! The only change I made was to substitute Great Northern beans for the kidney beans. This is fast, easy and great for when company is coming! I have made this several times and it has always come out wonderfully. It is just as good warmed up the second day as well!

I followed others' advice and made it the day before, used two cans of black beans and a can of pinto beans and diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of seperate cans of tomatoes and chiles. I added about a teaspoon of cumin. Instead of water I threw in a Mexican beer I had on hand. It was too watery so I let it cook on high in the slow cooker with the lid off all night. By morning it was pretty thick and concentrated but way too spicy so I threw in a can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomatoe sauce  and enough chicken broth to bring it up to the right consistancy. I then added a pkg of ranch dressing. This filled up the cooker.  Wow! With the dollop of sour cream the shredded cheese and taco chips it was fabulous. Got compliments all around. I'm making this again for the Super Bowl but will leave out the cumin.

I used 1 can of rotel instead of the can of chilis and left off one can of diced tomatoes which took a liitle heat off of the recipe. I also added garlic powder. My kids say its a keeper.

This was excellent. Didn't use the water and subbed 1 can of rotel diced tomatoes with chilies, for one peeled and diced tomatoes and omitted can of diced chile peppers. Excellent. So good over tortilla chips and sprinkled with cheese too.

I made this for the first time for my in-laws and I couldn't have been happier with the results.  I forgot to add the onion and didn't notice until the end of cooking time so I added some onion powder.  Super recipe!  My husband demands that I make it again in the  near future.  The recommended toppings are a must!

Yummy!  Okay, my changes were:  2 cans of pinto beans instead of chili & kidney, 10 oz. box of frozen corn, 4 oz. can of tomato sauce, and 1 can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I don't care for overly-tomatoey stuff, so this works for me. I also use the "hot" variety of the taco seasoning.  This is sooo good.  The crock pot is a great idea, but I usually just throw it all on the stove & it's ready in about 20 minutes.  We also put crushed tortilla chips & cheddar cheese in the serving bowls.

Very good!!!  Used 1 cup water and 1 cup chicken broth.  It would have been too thick with just 1 cup of water as other suggested.  Used 1 pkg. of Old El Paso Taco Spice and 1 freshly chopped jalepeno instead of green chili peppers, which I couldn't get.  My kids loved it with the a 3 cheese blend on top (mozz+cheddar+montery jack).  I put the cheese and the sour cream on mine.  YUMMY!!  This recipe is very similar to chili.  Will make again, thanks.

Wonderfull slow-cooker recipe!!  I doubled the recipe for my large family and substituted a pkg of chili seasoning for one the the taco seasonings.  We love cilantro so I added a couple handfulls of it and the juice of 1 lime about 20 minutes before serving. I also substituted the canned chili beans with canned Great Northern beans because I needed to use them up. It is also really tasty without the sour cream, cheese and corn chips if you are watching your fat intake.

What can I say!!!Don't let the simple ingredients fool you! I did make some changes. I used frozen corn in about the same quantity as a can of corn. I did top serve with frito type chips and topped with fat free sour cream, jack cheese, green onion, chopped cilantro. I am serious. All 6 of my picky kids ate every drop of the soup and wished there were more. I strongly recommend the cilantro. It is awesome. Also I made mine on the stove top for time saver and only simmered for about 20 minutes.

This was awesome and inexpensive--great for me, as I'm a starving college student.  Made our apartment smell great and my roommates loved it.  Didn't use the can of chile peppers and it didn't seem to matter.  Also substituted black beans for the chili beans.  Great recipe.

Tried this recipe over the weekend. I'm really paranoid about using a slow cooker and can't bring myself to do when I go to work, but I don't mind so much when I stay in town all day.  Went to the high school football game and my kids baseball game after.  When we got home it was all ready. Everyone loved it!  I thought it was spicy enough, but hubby and kids all put hot sauce in before eating.  I cut back the amount of water to 1 cup, because we like our soup a little thicker, and I added  a bit of minute rice, between games, which thickened it up quite a bit.  It was delicious!  I served it with cornbread on the side.  A great way to kick off the chilly fall season.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was just ok for my family.  I didn't make any changes and it seemed like too many beans.  Also, there were too many ingredients for my 3 qt slow cooker and I had to remove about 1 1/2 cups so it would not spill over.

Very very yummy... I too added the packet of ranch dressing, and I used black beans in place of the kidney beans.  It was perfectly seasoned for me, though a friend (with Mexican heritage) added Tobasco (a louisiana hot sauce).  My husband's only request?  Next time make cornbread, too!

I was really disappointed with this. My husband liked it all right, but I felt like something was missing because it tasted really mediocre. Maybe I was expecting more closer to chili than soup. Perhaps, if I made it again, I would use more tomato sauce and less water.

This is wonderful soup and goes very quickly in my family. I think it makes a lot more like 14 servings than 8, though. It's sure good, though!

One word....no make that two words.EASY!!AWESOME!! This was so good. I have made it numerous times and have found that this recipe is almost impossible to mess up. My kids absolutely loved it. We always sprinkle on shredded cheddar and break up corn chips over it. My husband, who is a big chili lover, requests this dish now instead of chili. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was wonderful and very easy.  I added a can of Ro-Tel for one of the cans of tomatoes, but other than that I didn't change anything.  It was perfect for a rainy weekend.

This is definitely more like chili than soup. Other than the misleading title, I have only one other complaint - this was very salty! It went over big for the Superbowl though. I will make again. Make sure you top with crushed tortilla chips, that makes the dish.

This soup turned out excellent. I used one can ROTEL tomatoes, and one can diced with green chiles instead of a seperate can. Served it with chips, cheese and sour cream and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was excellent and so easy. I didn't use a slow cooker. I just put it in a large pot on the stove and cooked it for about 5 hours. It turned out great! We enjoyed it with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips on top.

This has got to be one of the easiest recipes in the world!  It tastes like my mom's chili!  I ate it w/ low-fat cheddar cheese melted on top & some baked tortilla chips to keep it relatively low in fat.

It was ok, nothing special. If I try it again I will use canned pintos and maybe ranch style bean instead of the kidney and chili beans. Needs more flavor.

This was wonderful.  I cooked for 9 ladies and they all loved it.  A couple asked for the recipe.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans.  This is a crowd pleaser and easy as well as cost-effecient!

Great soup and so easy.  I subbed a can of hominy for corn, black beans for kidney beans, used some of my homemade freezer tomato sauce (similar to V8)for the canned tomato sauce, added garlic, a dash of brown sugar, mexican oregano, black pepper, and cuz we like things a little extra spicey I added a few dashes of tabasco.  Would be great with chorizo sausage instead of ground beef.  Will do again.

Good soup. I made a number of changes. First I don't know what chili beans are supposed to be. I found another recipe for homemade chili beans that was based on pinto beans so maybe that's what was called for. I just doubled up on the kidney beans although next time I think I'll substitute black beans for the chili beans just for more colour. I also rinsed and drained the beans and increased the added water to 4 cups to make up for the loss of fluid. Makes a less gassy soup. I also didn't know what green chili peppers were so used pickled jalapenos instead. Not 4 ounces but just to taste. ( I think about a tablespoon). Instead of the seasoning mix which usually contains MSG and a good deal of salt. (Both No-No's in my house) I used the following spices. 3 tbsp. chili powder, 3 tsp dried oregano, 1 1/2 tsp freshly ground cumin, 3/4 tsp dried red pepper flakes. When measured this recipe made 22 cups of soup which is more than 8 servings to my mind. Adjusting the calories accordingly and it is only 132 calories per 1 cup serving. I have frozen some of the soup to see if it freezes well since the recipe makes such a large batch. My kids (9 & 11) were both too cowardly to even try it. I'm still trying to convert them from canned.

Delicious.  If you can brown meat and open up cans, you can make this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the kidney beans to black beans.  Kept everything else the same and it was definitely more of a soup consistency than chili.  Great with a small dollop of sour cream or without.

I think I am one of the only people who did not like this soup.  It had a very odd taste to it but it may have been the taco seasoning I chose.  My husband tolerated it but said he wasn't sure if he was eating chili or soup.  I may try again with another brand of seasoning.

I was wary about this recipe simply because i didn't know if it would be too spicy for my four year old. But it was a big hit with her as well as my husband. I did add about a teaspoon of sugar to the soup in order to cut the tanginess of the tomatoes and i added extra corn. The chips and sour cream really make this dish. My daughter even said "i wish i could eat this forever!"

This is a great tasting low-fat soup, if you use lean beef. The only thing I think it needed was salt. The recipe didnt call for it (maybe that is just a gimmie) I added grated cheddar cheese to my bowl as another review suggested. Tasty and simple recipe.

This is a very easy, quick and tasty crock pot soup.  I added the ranch packet, as did others.  I felt like I couldn't taste the flavor of it though BUT I haven't tried this without it in there so it may change the flavor.  It is a very "chili type" recipe though but I really liked the flavor, it tastes great as left overs too.

A wonderful soup with zip!  I didn't have chili beans, canned corn, diced tomatoes, or chili peppers on hand, so I added 2 cans Rotel, 4 large cloves of garlic, and a 16oz can of tomato sauce instead of an 8oz can.  I found I needed to add 2 extra cups of water with some corn starch also, and some cumin and cilantro for extra seasoning.  I cooked the grnd beef with the taco seasoning mix, and followed the pkg directions.  We topped the soup with shredded cheese and sour cream, and had toasted flour tortillas on the side.  It was excellent!  My kids all had seconds and loved it! Will make again!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Great soup!  I added a packet of ranch dressing like some other reviewers said.  I also garnished with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips like the recipe recommended.  It was easy to make.  I will definitely make again.

This was great. Was looking for an easy, make-ahead thing for a couples' baby shower. I gave it a "test run' the other night by making it for my parents. We all loved it. I did use only half the water, and added an envelope of Ranch dressing mix to it. Served it with Homesteader cornbread from this site, and sour cream, taco chips, and shredded cheese. I will serve this with confidence at the shower!

Very good! Even got my picky 9 year old sister to eat it (with lots of cheese of course and picking out the tomatoes). She does like tacos though. Will use recipe again.

so good!  I am not a huge fan of corn and was a little afraid of adding in the liquid, but it was not overpowering at all.  Thank you for giving me a new family staple.

Very good! I added an envelope of ranch dressing mix as suggested by other reviewers and  simmered on the stove for about 1 1/2 hrs. Garnished with home fried corn tortilla strips, grated cheddar cheese and sour cream. Great!!

This almost couldn't be easier - brown some ground beef, chop an onion, open some cans, that's it.  The taco seasoning mix I prefer comes in a 1 oz package, I mixed that in with the beef while it was browning, just as I would making it for tacos, and then mixed another 1/2 package in with the rest of the recipe.  I loved the corn in it and might add some chopped bell peppers next time.  From prior reviewers' suggestions, for one of the cans of chopped tomatoes I used Rotel Mexican Fiesta style tomatoes, and only 1 cup of water instead of 2.  Next time I might not even use any water to start with, this had plenty of liquid for my taste, with all the tomatoes and not draining any of the canned things.  Topped it with Fritos, sour cream and cheese - cilantro, avocados and slived olives would be great toppers.

I would have to agree with the other reviewers that this recipe does taste like chili, but it's chili with some zip!  I enjoyed this recipe but the rest of my family told me just to make my regular chili next time. I think it was the corn that threw them. Oh well, thanks anyway!

This is such a fun recipe, and so easy too. I serve tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese also on the side for toppings. Make this for someone who doesn't cook much, because they probably don't get to have neat homemade recipes like this - - they will be delighted even though it's very simple!

Wonderful!!!  Used fresh green chile peppers instead of canned.  Also, I only had 1 can diced tomatoes, so I substituted 2 diced fresh tomatoes instead.  (This may have cut down on the watery factor that others experienced).  Since I got a late start that day, I cooked on high for half the time.

I had also hoped this recipe to be a more kid friendly with my two little ones, but no such luck.  I omitted the green chiles for this reason and I am afraid it was on the bland side.  I will make again though with a little more spice just for the adults!

Wow! I don't think it gets any easier than this.  What a great soup to throw together.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours, then on high for 1 more and it was perfect.  I served it with cornbread and it went over wonderfully.  I didn't make any changes, and none were needed.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  The flavours were good but it just didn't seem like a "soup" to me, but more like a runny chili dish.

I made this on the stove-top in less than 30 minutes because I was looking for something quick to fix for lunch.  I sauteed the onions with the ground beef, then added all the other ingredients (but only 1 cup of water) and simmered it for about 20 minutes.  WE LOVED IT!

Loved the recipe!!  I recommend using regular taco seasoning instead of mild.  I have tried it both ways and find the regular to be much more flavorful.

I love this recipe! I lost my original recipe and I had a craving for Taco Soup, this hit the spot!  I did add a package of Ranch Dressing mix which I remembered from my original recipe, not sure if it made any difference though.

My friend (and co-worker) made this for her family last evening, and brought some left-overs for me to have for lunch today....it was superb! I plan to make it soon for my husband and 3 teen boys. She accompanied it with 'the moistest cornbread'[another recipe on this site], which I will DEFINITELY fix with it!!!

Very easy and great for left overs.   I subsituted the ground beef for turkey.  I brown it the night before, and then throw everything in the crockpot before leaving the house the next morning.

I made this soup the other day.  It was excellent.  I didn't had all the chiles because I was afraid it would be too spicy.  It tasted excellent!! I even ate the leftovers the next day.  I highly reccomend it if you need something warm and are in a hurry.  I definetly plan to have this again.

I was in a hurry so I made this over the stove and cooked for about 1 1/2 hours. Subsituted 1 lb of ground pork and a can of garbanzo beans for the chili beans, and used 1 11oz can of niblets corn. The soup was wonderful. It's so hard to find a recipe that the whole family loves, thanks a bunch for sharing.

I decided to add twice as many Chille beans and no add water, mine was really really yummy (a definite boyfriend pleaser)
Very very simple too, minimal chopping and preparation which is very nice, throw a bunch of stuff into a pot, go to work and when you come home the flavor is nice and developed and ready to eat.

This recipe was delicious.  By the time I got home my boyfriend already had eaten two bowls.  It reminds me more of chili then soup, but it has delicious flavor and it great as a left over.  I topped it with cheese and sour cream it was wonderful!

Love this super-easy meal.  We line a soup bowl with a flour tortilla, then add the soup, then mix in a bit of sour cream.  It's fantastic - my 2 year old son can't get enough (so it's obviously not too spicy).  Thanks for the super recipe!

Makes much more than I expected! We had our neighbors over to help eat it, what a hit! The kids added extra cheese and sour cream for a more mild flavor.

My husband & I really enjoyed this meal. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos and one can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic & basil. I also used 1 can of pinto beans instead of the chili beans. It turned out great. My husband wanted it for lunch & dinner the next day. Even with the added jalapenos the recipe was not too hot. Thanks for a new & easy recipe.

This has to be the best soup recipe I've found yet.  I added some extra things like sliced black olives, some "Essence" by Emeril, leftover turkey, and used frozen corn versus canned.  My husband and I are contractors, so we eat out of coolers every day, and this has to be by far the highlight of our day.  Thank you!!!!

Fixed this for a neighborhood moving crew.  It was super fast to put together, convenient, and they INHALED IT..ha! I made it the day before, and gave the flavors a day to pull together. In addition to the suggested toppings of sour cream, and corn chips; I set out a bowl of fresh, chopped cilantro. Everyone raved!

This is a great recipe. It is easy to make and very tasty. To make it healthier, I used ground turkey, and low sodium corn. Also, I used black beans instead of kidney beans. I used about 1/2 the water recommended, based on suggestions from other reviewers. I had to make it two Sunday's in a row, at my husbands request.

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  It tastes alot like chili, but had the consistancy of soup.  For our family of 10, I doubled it, except the beef and green chilis, and it was just the right amount. The nicest part was having dinner done by 8:00 in the morning.

This was pretty good, but required alot of ingredients!! It does make quite a bit so if you don't have a large family and don't want to eat it for a week, only make it when you have company! Definitely add the sour cream, it adds great flavor!

Very easy to make.  I only used half of one can of green chiles because they said it might be too hot and my children were going to eat this.  However if I make it again, I will add a whole can and maybe just a hint of tabasco for extra flavor.  It was almost too mild.  Experiment a little with flavor and you have a winner that is simple to make!

This recipe was so easy to throw together - it literally took me 15 minutes. Eight hours later and BOOM!...We had a yummy, filling, flavorful Taco Soup! (I did skip the peppers to make a more mild soup for my taste.) Thanks for the recipe!

A "keeper" said my husband, we loved this.  I did use the ranch packet and I also pureed the tomatoes so we didn't have big chunks.  I added about a tsp. of vinegar and LOTS of tobasco.  We wanted it a bit thicker so for the last hour, I turned it up to high and took the lid off.  This was delicious, we will definitely add this to our favorites!

We loved this recipe!  It was so easy to prepare.  I did omit the onions for our taste.  I have passed this on to several friends.  Everyone loves it.

I omitted the water, used black beans instead of chili beans, and added an extra packet of taco seasoning. Pretty good!

I was so excited to make this soup!  It was disappointing that it had no flavor.  I would substitute the tomatoes with salsa and use only one cup of water.  I won't be making it again.

Added fresh garlic and omitted the corn.  It was a delicious hit with my husband and friend.  I served it with a salad and 
Texas toast.

Pretty good. I added 1 package of ranch dressing mix as suggested. The two cans of diced tomatoes had oregano, basil & garlic included. Also next time I will add salt before cooking.

This dish was Amazin,Simple and Delicious!! I used turkey meat instead of beef! I made mines more spicy by adding crushed red peppers,and I cut jalapenos to add to the crockpot!!  To get that taco flavor I added more taco seasoning,when it was done I added cheese ,sour cream and I dipped it with some Italian /French Bread!! Finger licking GOOD :-)

I used extra taco seasoning and less water, but very tasty.  My sons swear it's Mexican Chili not Taco Soup, but whatever you call it it's good.

Light, delicious flavors.  Healthy, very easy meal.  I omitted the can of chiles because I don't like the heat.  I simmered it for two hours on the stove instead of in the slow cooker.  It was very good, healthy, satisfying.

Delicious. Only change, didn’t have a crock pot. An hour on the stove did the trick. Add a little cheese on top and you’ve got a winner.

I made this last night, and it was great!  I guess I really used this recipe as a stepping off point--I did not have tomato sauce, so I used salsa, and I did substitute a beer and a little bone broth instead of water, based on other reviews.  I used petite diced tomatos and a little bit of Rotel I had leftover.  The family loved it!

This was awesome.  I froze half and then put it in the fridge again because the first half was gone immediately.  It even looked as good as the picture and that rarely happens for me.  I like that is is easily thrown in a slow cooker and that you can adjust the ingredients to what you have on hand.  This one is a keeper!

Easily one of my favourite things to make! So much flavour and it's so easy! The only thing is I like it more thick so I leave out the 2 cups of water... Also if I add the 2 cups my crock pot will overflow lol,

I loved this and so did the eight family members I fed!  I doubled the recipe, drained the kidney beans and corn cans. Then I ended up with 5 cans of rotes diced tomatoes with green chilies due to a shopping error so I added all of those and no separate cans of green chilies. Then NO water. Mine still ended up having quite a lot of liquid so I made some cilantro lime rice in another pan and everyone poured it over a scoop of that with crushed chips, cilantro, and sour cream on top. Delicious!!

Yes I will make it again. I tripled the recipe!  I used 3 cups of beef broth, and rinsed the beans. And I added a little wahoo chili powder, 1 teas.  I served it with tositos chips, sour cream and shredded Mexican cheese!!! DELISH!!!

This is absolutely amazing. Love this soup. I use beef broth instead of water. I top it off with cheese, sour cream and some southwester tortilla soup strips. AMAZING!!!

Made as written. Delicious! My husband really enjoyed it as well as my 6 year old. Made enough for lunch leftovers after feeding 2 adults and 2 young children.

Awesome soup! I used the entire amount of chile peppers and we didn't find it to be spicy at all. So good I made 3 batches in less than a week. I am going to share this recipe with friends and neighbors. Thank you!

This was good, but I made so many changes to the original recipe that  my version bore no resemblance to it whatsoever.two stars for the basic concept.

Instead of water use V8 juice or if unavailable use tomato juice. I add the seasoning to the ground beef along with a chopped onion. Add I use twice the amount of taco seasoning along with red kidney beans.  I serve it with sour cream, cheddar cheese and corn bread on the side.

I omitted the corn and used green chiles. It was a bit thinner than I like my soups, and I don't know if I'd call it a "taco soup" so much as I'd call it a chili soup, as it has a deeper smokey heat than the brighter heat of a taco. Still plenty delicious, though, but next time I might omit the additional water. There was a LOT of liquid in my slow cooker, and it was quite full.

My students chose this recipe to make and everyone loved it. The only thing we did different was to use frozen corn added about an hour before it was done and to use a lot more tomato juice to thin out the mixture for a more soupy  consistency. Very yummy!

I just wanted to say you don’t have to crockpot this for hours! Follow the directions, and simmer it for 45 minute. It still comes out great and like any soup, stew, or chili it will taste even better the next day!

Very tasty.  Only thing I changed was adding some garlic.  A little too spicy for me but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy stuff, usually mild is too hot, haha.  Sour cream, cheese and tortilla strips are a must!

Amazing soup!  I substituted rotisserie chicken instead of beef and added sliced olives. It was delicious and if anyone is on weight watchers, it’s a 0 point soup with all the flavor!

This recipe is easy and definitely a keeper. I used ground tu4ke and also sautéed the onions before adding them to the crock pot. I also used black beans instead of the kidney beans

I used the following ingredients (this is all I had at home)
Leftover taco meat, large jar of Aldi salsa, large can of crushed tomatoes, small can of tomato sauce, small can of green chilies, a few scoops of frozen corn, more taco seasoning. Heated on high for a couple of hours. Quick and delicious!

This was sooo good!  I did change it a bit, cut ingredients in half (because I didn't need that much soup), but used the same amount of liquid. I did use 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup water instead of all water, and just used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies, instead of separately, and as other users suggested, I added taco seasoning to the beef as it was browning... otherwise, I followed the recipe. This was so good, thank you for a great recipe!

I have a question for anyone that can help me. Would it be okay if I put the hamburger meat in the Crock-Pot raw? I do not have a stove at the moment but I do have a Crock-Pot and the ingredients for taco soup.

Came out great! Added some additional spices and would probably do a hot and spicy taco seasoning next time to give some added flavor.

This is always a popular soup for a crowd and it’s so easy! I added a half packet of chili mix in addition to the taco seasoning mix.  To serve I add a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheese and a few strips of corn tortilla chips

I doubled this recipe thinking 1 lb of hamburger wouldn't be enough for our family.  WRONG!  I ended up with 2 crockpots full!  Not a bad thing, we ate one and I froze the other.  I thought there were too many beans.  Next time I will omit the kidney beans.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, half with garlic and the other half just fire roasted.  Other than that, I made as is.  I did brown my hamburger with 1 pkg of the taco seasoning and onion then split the second packet between the two crockpots.  This was good and will be better without the kidney beans.

My mom and I have sensitivities to tomatoes and such but we love a good bowl of taco soup. I knew I wanted to make a few slow cooker meals during the cool weather so I chose this as one after a failed attempt at old fashioned goulash. This was so good and will definitely make again. We added 1/2 onion as my uncle doesn’t like them, and for add ons sour cream, cheese, and Fritos. It lasted us 2 1/2 days, I made 15 servings worth for 4 people. Yumm!

My husband LOVES this soup. He always wants me to make it for his friends. I usually just"wing it". But I took the advice of some reviews and made a few alterations.

I browned the meat with half a pack of taco seasoning, a smidgen on minced garlic, and the chopped onion (I only used about 3/4 of a large yellow onion). I also used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapeño and a can of regular diced tomatoes, both 14oz. I substituted tomato sauce with 10oz can of tomato soup, then filled the can half with water and added that. I only used 1 can of kidney beans with half of the juice from the can. I also added fresh cilantro to the top of the pot and a bit of sea salt. In the last hour of cooking, I added salad size shrimp for extra pizzazz. Served with shredded cheese and soup cream on top, with scoops chips. Absolutely LOVE!

I used seasoned black beans instead of chili beans since I always have them on hand.  I also added more green chili simply because that is the taste I prefer.  I made a green chili yeast cornbread to go with it.   Added a salad with Lime vinaigrette for a great supper.   Gave it 4 stars simply because I had to make a couple of additions to suit my taste.  Easy to put together and great aroma to come home to at the end of the day.

Easy, quick and delicious. Will definitely make this again. I added a packet of ranch dip mix though. Next time I will substitute the corn with a can of hominy.

Instead of diced tomatoes and green chilies, I used a jar of salsa. It was absolutely delicious and one of my families all time favorites! Thank you for such an easy recipe to follow!

Didn't have much of a taco taste even with two packets of taco seasoning but it was still good. I used Tostitos Scoops and it goes well together. I also used 2lb of meat instead of 1, just because my husband and I prefer more meat in our meals. For the diced tomatoes and green chilies I bought the rotel that has them mixed together. It would probably taste more like tacos if I mixed the seasoning with the meat. Otherwise it was still delicious. Always taste better the second day!

Taco soup is one of my favorite meals, and this one was quite good. The only way I varied from the recipe was by using a 7 oz can of diced green chile peppers instead of a 4 oz can. At the end, I found the recipe did not have enough flavor so I added some salt and garlic powder and...YUMMY!!!! If I had any cumin, I would have added that as well, but unfortunately I was out.

This was awesomely easy! I used a can of "black chili beans" and a can of mexican/pinto beans. I also used 2# of ground beef with 3 packets of taco seasoning. I added water to the ground beef when adding the taco seasoning (like the packages ask for), but didn't add water to the soup itself.  This recipe is so quick & easy in the crockpot. And I get rave reviews from anyone I make it for! (even my 2 year old & 5 year old.... Which is a huge feat)!!!!

This was nice. Decided something different to pasta and/or chicken was in order tonight and settled on this. After reading reviews I did half the tomatoes and water so it wasn't too soupy, and the consistency was good. I personally rate this 3*, but my super fussy 6yo ate this up prior to the corn chips on her plate and polished off a second helping as well so I had to bump it up to 4 overall.

I strangely didn't have the can of tomato sauce in my pantry so I used some leftover zing zang bloody mary  mix & subbed pinto beans for the kidney beans. My family agreed that it was the best taco soup ever.

This base was very good, i substituted a can of rotel, and black beans instead of kidney beans. Cooked to meat with half a packet of taco seasoning, and the other half in the soup.added a tablespoon of jalapeño Tabasco, ended up wonderful tasting!

I followed the basic recipe but needed a huge batch for my book club.  I added an additional 1/2 lb ground beef, can of tomatoes, can of black beans, and can of  rinsed pinto beans.  I also added an additional 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning.  Served with sour cream, fritos, and shredded cheddar cheese.  My friends raved about the wonderful flavor.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

My family has been enjoying this recipe for years! One thing I do to combine ingredients and make easier is using Rotel tomatoes  in place of tomatoes and green chilies. I also add tomato paste instead of sauce for a thicker base.

My step-daughter shared this recipe on her Facebook page yesterday.  My husband and I made it today and just had it for dinner.  My oh my was that good!  We made a few changes based on recommendations from my step-daughter.  We cooked the onion with the beef.  We added one can of drained black beans.  We added the juice from one small lime.  We left out the chile peppers because I have a sensitive stomach.  After serving, we each added some shredded cheddar cheese, some sour cream and some crunched-up tortilla chips.  This meal was truly delightful.  We look forward to leftovers tomorrow!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Doubled the recipe but may need to tweak my next batch.  2 cans of tomato sauce was just too tangy so I’ll cut that part in half next time and use just 1 can.  I also prefer a little more meat so in addition to the 1 lb of ground beef I added 1 lb of ground chorizo.  Really enhances the flavor!  Served with a side of avocado, Mexican corn cake and tortillas.

Very yummy. The whole (extended) family loved it. I forgot the corn at the grocery store and I'll add it next time. I also added a can of black beans. I'll definitely make this again!!

I made it, it was simply wonderful! Very tasty! I only added one cup of water added onion flakes instead of onion, added garlic and cumin.  Also added a pinch of sugar to neutralize the acid in the tomatoes. The sour cream and cheese really sets it off! Ate two bowlfuls!!  So so good!!!

I made this soup for our Christmas Cookie Baking Party at my church. I doubled the recipe to feed 20+ ladies and teens and it was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe for my slow cooker which for he entire soup perfectly and I literally left with nothing! Served with sour cream, cheese, and tortilla chips for the toppings. Great, quick soup!

It was delicious!! The only change I made was, use black beans instead of kidney and added extra can of corn just because I love corn. Other than that, it was perfect! Not to mention all of my friends did as well.

I doubled the meat and added more taco seasoning. Add some cheese, salsa and sour cream as garnish and it's pretty good. Didn't have much "taco" flavor though, so it was basically a Crock-Pot chili.

If this tastes like chili to you you're making your chili wrong. This is not earth shattering but I wish I'd thought of it before. It's a very simple yet tasty and super easy throw together meal. The only way I parted from the recipe is that I didn't plan ahead so I simmered it for about an hour on the stove instead of using my slow cooker. 

I imagine it would be even tastier after being slow cooked for hours but my big thing is almost everything in it comes right out of the can into the pot, no rinsing, no draining. I put the onion in my food processor and it was hands off in no time. 

Thanks for submitting this. It will become one of my regular soups now. I can already think of a few ways to change it up a bit for variety.

Man this was awesome. I didn’t make any purposeful changes to the recipe. I forgot to take out hamburger meat but had 4 large chicken breast that had been cooked I shredded. I think I doubled the recipe too. Fabulous the one person that I thought wouldn’t eat it. Loves it.

This soup is really good. I made two changes. I used vegan meat and only one cup of water. Even with reducing the water, there was too much liquid for my liking. I'm thinking it is because of the "meat" that I used. Next time I might use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to thicken it up. Other than that this soup was taste great and eating it the next night was even better. Thanks for the recipe!

When I first tasted this soup. I thought it was a little bland. We like spicy food so I added more taco seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder and a jalapeno and it tasted much better. I think it is a great base that you could adjust to your taste. I also added tortilla chips, cheese and a dollop of sour cream. I served it with jalapeno corn bread muffins and it was very good. I would make it again and recommend it to a friend.

Pretty easy to make with good flavor and low calorie per serving.  As suggested by another I added the taco seasoning directly to the meat (venison) before combining.  We also found that it tasted a little more like chili than tacos, but that didn't bother us at all as our bowls were very quickly emptied.

Really easy soup that you can set and forget. My onions were still crunchy though. Next time I will start on high for maybe 3 hours and low for the next 5.

This turned out great!  I made it into chili instead. Only added 1 cup of water, used to cans black bean without juice, corn without juice, added two packets of taco seasoning, and used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added jalapeños for more spice.

This is a good base for Taco Soup. I added everything, but added numerous seasonings like garlic, two cubes of cilantro,  black pepper, garlic salt and a standard table seasoning from Italy because there's not enough flavor. It's still heating, but so far it's delicious! To add in some more flavor, I would suggest either seasoning the ground beef while cooking, or while adding the water, mix in some chicken bouillon with it.

I did quite a few things differently. I like more meat to veggie ratio so I used only the can of chili beans and dropped the kidney beans. I also used hominy instead of corn, which is just my preference. I changed the tomatoes to a can of fire roasted which I chopped a little finer in my food processor before adding them to the soup. It was pretty good. I will definitely be making it again.

Excellent even though I didn't follow it to a T, only had black beans on hand.  Also went with another reviewers suggestion of making it more of a chili consistency instead of soupy. I also adjusted how much taco seasoning I needed based on taste. 

Also, I didn't use a slow cooker,  did it in 15 min. Everything else came out of a can so was already ready, only cooking was the beef/taco seasoning. Then mixed together.  Then melted cheese ontop and served with lettuce and sour cream and pringles tortilla chips, made a taco bowl!

This recipe is one of our go-to recipes when it's cold outside. When it's warm outside we will scoop out the meat from the broth and make nachos.  While the recipe is great as written, I also prefer to add the taco seasoning as I'm browning the beef.  The other night I didn't have any tomato sauce so I improvised by adding some homemade bar-b-q sauce.  This substitution was not my personal favorite, but the family loved it.

Is a very good recipe I also put the ranch dressing in there and put the cilantro in the recipe. Use pintos instead of kidney beans also put in two cans of green chilies I will definitely make this again very good everyone loved it. When I Brown the ground beef I put the onions in there caramelize them and also put in taco seasoning and the dried ranch dressing for a little bit just to add flavor to the meat great recipe!

First of all: if you have a regular size crock pot, you might want to cut the recipe a little bit. I followed the ingredient amounts to the letter and it was right to the very top of my slow cooker, which required some cooking ingenuity to prevent overflow. Additionally, the description warns against putting in too much chile pepper if you can't handle spice, but there isn't anything remotely spicy about this. For something with so few ingredients, it was pretty bland- probably because the taco seasoning was the only actual seasoning in it. It could benefit from some spices added. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't dislike it, but it didn't stand out in the slightest.

This recipe is very good. It is also very forgiving as far as substitutions. I regularly sub a 10 oz can of rotel for the green chilis. It ads a slight heat that my kids will tolerate and the few extra ounces of tomato are unnoticeable. We also prefer more beans so I usually add another can or two. I've subbed low salt beef broth for the water. It's a full meal on its own but toppings make it heartier and of course the kids think it's way more fun. Thanks!

Wow! This was so good!  I made Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning and mixed it with the browning ground chuck and onions. I also used 2 cups of low sodium beef broth in place of water. The beans and corn were also low sodium. I served this with fat free sour cream, some diced green onion I needed to use up and a little bit of taco blend cheese.  We ate it with corn chips and Mexican Cornbread II from this site.  Yummy. The only thing I would do next time is add a little more ground chuck just to make it meatier. This is a keeper!

Very easy, and delicious.  Used 2 cans of rotel tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and chiles.

My family loves tacos and when I saw this, I had to make it. They loved it so much and so did I. 
TIP- THE GREEN CHILE PEPPERS ARE NOT SPICY IF YOU GET THE MILD ONES. THE DISH TASTES SUPER GOOD WITH THEM! 
Thank you so much. This was a 5 star dish Must make dish.

Great concept for a Mexican slow cooker meal. I doubled it, and made in two slow cookers. I did not use the peppers because I didn't want it to be hot for the little ones. I also skipped out on taco seasoning because I can't stand it, and prefer to make my own seasoning combos. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin powder. Turned out fantastic.

I made it exactly by the recipe directions.  This was just "okay".  If I make it again, I will need to tweek it and add some spices or something so it will not be so bland.

I make this recipe exactly as the recipe states.  It is good every single time.  We like to put a dollop of  sour cream and squeeze fresh lime juice on top.  Please don't worry about making a bunch of changes.  If you follow the recipe it will turn out perfect!

I gave this 5 starts because I think this is a wonderful "base" for taco soup.  I made this - and although I usually hate when people review and made variations - but in my case the variations were because I used my homemade canned tomatoes and pureed tomatoes.  So - I basically eye balled everything else.  I added canned corn, drained - 2 cans of green chilies (because I love them), I drained 1 can of black beans, added 1 can of the chili beans, I added 1 chopped onion and then added my homemade taco seasoning.  I also eye balled that to taste.  If you are saying this tastes like chili - you are adding too much chili powder - and probably not enough cumin in your taco seasoning.  I found this tastes just like the taco soup I was looking for.  I also sautéed my home grown frozen green peppers with my ground beef and did as others suggested - seasoned with extra taco seasoning.  It's in the crock pot now and I couldn't be happier.  Thank you!

I thought it was okay.  I lost my favorite taco soup recipe I used to use and thought I'd try this one.  I felt it was lacking something.  I would definitely add sliced black olives, maybe more seasoning.  I think I will keep looking or a better recipe.

One of our go-to soups now! Except, I don't like chunks of tomato, so we add 1 more can of tomato sauce, and a can of a Mexican tomato sauce with jalapeños in it. So smooth and so delicious!

Very easy to make. I don't know what the benefit is to let it cook for so long - I stopped mine after 5 hours or so. 

It needs topped off with a little salt and a healthy dose of sour cream - once you add those two things, this is pretty good.

Ours turned out pretty spicy which was great. Possibly from the green chiles we bought or the fire roasted tomatoes we used. Not sure. Either way turned out great. We sprinkled some cheese in it and added some plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.

Really good soup, but I agree with other reviewers that this is more like a chili. I followed the recipe's instructions, except I was using leftover taco meat, so I added the ranch mix when I was heating the meat, but it's really no different. It comes together really easy.

We loved this! The two minor changes I made were I added a pack of ranch dip seasoning and instead of water I used one can of beer. Y'all it was delicious. A little velveeta in the bottom of the bowl to melt and it was on point. We will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I followed (mdoron5131) suggestions to a T. This person is right! This was so superb and delicious! I bought a premade French loaf with garlic butter as a side dish. I had to try to control myself eating two or three balls! I won't ever need to make chilli as this tops any hamburger soup or chilli that I've ever made! A definite staple!

This is a very good soup for a cold winter night! The taste is well balanced. This is one for chili lovers.My wife ask me what would would change in it and I said, "absolutely nothing!" I can imagine that instead of ground beef, you could you a ground and beef and pork mixture, ground turkey or bite size cubes of stew meat. If you wanted to kick up the heat, more cayenne and jalapeños should do the trick but it was just right for me as it was presented in the recipe.

I love this.. Probably my favorite thing I've made from this site so far. Because it's so incredibly easy and so freaking good.. Only thing I do differently ifs add a ranch packet and brown the beef with taco seasoning and half an onion.. One cup h2o

I've also got the canned veggies I use Pinpointed to what makes this perfect. .. I have to stop my boyfriend from eating half the crock pot in one sitting.

This is very good and similar to a weight watchers recipe that I have made before.

Made the recipe exactly as listed. It was pretty good though taste don't a little too much like chile to me. In the future I'll probably not use chile beans.

I made some changes because it reminds me of Chili. I didn't use meat at all nor the Chili Peppers. Instead of water I used Low-Sodium Beef Broth, instead of Chili beans use Black Beans. I also added Onion Soup Mix. I made this soup for family dinner at my house to go along with the Mexican meal. It was delicious. The soup was ate up before the evening was over.

I made a double batch (which filled my crock pot to the tip top) using black, kidney, pinto, and jalapeño refried beans, and rinsed/drained all but the refried. I also used frozen corn in place of canned, chicken stock in place of water (quantity halved), a small can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to further reduce the liquid, and precombined Rotel tomatoes and chiles. I also cooked half the seasoning with the meat. As adjusted, the flavors are just about the same as in the original recipe, only adjusted a bit to be thicker. 6 hours on high was perfect. I love it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and green onion. My kids add olives and tortilla chips and my husband likes avocado.

Very very delicious! I  used ground turkey, as we usually do when making tacos, and used rotel instead of green chiles--so I don't think I "altered" the recipe enough to be annoying :)
FANTASTIC, very very yummy! Served with a few fritos too.

This dish can't decide what it is: is it chili?  Is it southwestern soup?  And the answer is that it does neither one well.  Boring and poorly constructed.  Palatable; so two stars, but definitely wouldn't make again.

This is good, satisfying soup; flavorful with out being too spicy. I used chicken stock instead of water, and also added fresh garlic. As another reviewer noted, you can let the soup cook longer than 8 hours. I was running late getting home, so walked into a wonderful aroma after cooking the soup 10 hours!

Made it by the recipe but added cumin powder and calintro to spice it up a bit.  Served it at a party with a side of chips and  sour cream to taste.   We had a fiesta party, and members had 1-2 servings along with the other goodies at the dinner.   I will make it again.

Not bad, but using rotel plus the can of green chilies is necessary for me. Also hominy would be much better than corn.

I'm not a big fan of chili, and there were quite a few reviews that mentioned its likeness to it, so I was a little concerned, but I really like it!  I added cheese & corn chips to the top of my bowl. I used 1/2 a bag of frozen chopped onions instead of fresh, since I can't chop things very well. I used 2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes with peppers & 1 can of regular diced tomatoes.  Still has a strong kick to it.  I also traded the Chili Beans for Black Beans.  Doesn't taste like chili to me...except for the kick.  Next time, I might try only 1 can of Rotel & 2 regular cans of diced tomatoes.

Made it stove-top.  Browned beef in a stock pot with onion then added all other ingredients, brought to boiling, let simmer for about 30 minutes.  Tasted after adding the packet of taco seasoning, decided it needed more taco flavor, so added a second flavor packet.
Delicious, quick and easy, the whole family liked it and said we could make it for casual gatherings with friends/family.

I have made the Taco Soup at least 7, 8, maybe 9 times and it is always a hit.  Whoever we have over someone will always want the recipes.  Its just so easy, quick, and the ingredients are some that we pretty much have on standby.

Great taste would definitely make again.  Make a few changes as I did not have all the ingredients on hand.  I used only 1 can of tomatoes and substituted the other with tomato paste.  Used 2 cans of beans, black and mixed, plus I added cayenne pepper.

This soup is amazing! I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the onion with the meat and then added the taco seasoning as per instructions on package then added to the rest of the ingredients in the slow cooker. I used borracho and charro beans in place of the beans called for and used beef broth instead of water. Will definitely make again!!

Made it last night for dinner, and my fiance enjoyed it, we topped it with taco cheese and sour cream, it was good. Tasted a little like taco, and chili mixed. I'm not a fan of chili, but I would make it again.

I really like this recipe and would make this again.  Instead of water I added chicken broth.  Beef broth would have  been good but I didn't have any on hand.  Mushrooms might have been a good addition to this.  I'll try that next time.

It was good,but like others said, it was more like a Chili soup.  I cooked the meat according to taco seasoning package but another pack of taco seasoning added to the broth would be better.  I will make this again.

Made this Wednesday night and it was excellent. Only substitutions made were tomato pasta instead of sauce, added some brown sugar, & instead of diced tomatoes and peppers I used Mild Rotel.

This soup was delicious and so easy to make! I recommend using low sodium canned goods to make it healthier! I served it with cheese and a dollop of sour cream with chips on the side.

This is our favorite football tailgate soup, served with cornbread. I double the recipe and freeze leftovers in single sized portions for yummy lunches. I add black beans rather than chili beans, otherwise follow this recipe exactly. My kids (22, 20 and 16 now) always say its their favorite meal!

Yum! My family enjoyed this recipe. Very good flavors and textures. It was a bit more on the "chili" side than "soup" side. I added in all the can juices (beans, tomatos, chiles). Instead of corn I used hominy and added a packet of ranch seasoning as well as an extra cup of water to make it more soupy. We topped with Frito chips, cheese and sour cream.

I have a large family that eats a lot of food! This was easy and affordable to make. I added  hummus in addition to the yellow corn, a package of dry ranch dressing mix, and olives. I topped out off with shredded cheese and sour cream. On the we had tortilla chips and cornbread (made southwest by adding shredded cheese, chili powder, cumin, and a  tablespoon of honey).

This is one of my favorite go-to soups and a good one to share with others.   I drain the beans and corn, preferring not to use the liquid.  This can sit in the slow cooker, but we usually just cook and eat.

My family for the most part enjoyed it. My husband hates tomatoes so I had to leave those out. But I made it just as suggested and added some ranch and a tbsp of brown sugar as others suggested. My husband did say I should add more water since it was supposed to be a soup.

This is an awesome easy peasy slow cooker recipe my whole family loves.....I throw in what I have, sometimes there is more of something than others, and that's what gives this 5 stars....a recipe yummy cooked straight and a lot of variation. The only think I consistently do differently, is I brown the hamburger when ready to eat, and put it on fresh....some in our family like to eat it vegetarian style, so this works for us...plus I like the taste of the freshly cooked ground beef more than the slow cooker flavor :)

This was a fantastic base recipe for me! I've been looking for a slow cooker soup recipe so that I can have it for the days when I'll be gone most of the day. I did substitute black beans for kidney beans and I added a packet of Ranch mix to the Taco mix to the browned meat before putting it in the slow cooker. Everyone ate several bowls of it, and my sensitivity to spicy food was not touched by this  soup(although I did add substantial amounts of sour cream to my bowl). Thanks so much for sharing! My boyfriend is already asking when I'm going to make it again!

Recipe is great just like it's printed.  I even made it once with grilled chicken for my kid who doesn't eat beef.  Used chicken stock instead of water.   It was awesome.

Huge crowd pleaser. For personal taste I omit the ground beef and make it vegetarian. I also omit the chiles and double the taco seasoning, which helps it taste more like tacos and less like chili. I also throw in an extra can of kidney beans and black beans to make up for the lack of beef. Great recipe!

Very good! I sauteed onions in olive oil then browned the ground beef, then added tomato sauce w/taco seasoning pkt. Mix well, then pour into crock pot with all your other ingredients. When done topped with mexican blend cheese and served with crispy tortilla chips. Tip: leave ground beef in big chunks when cooked.

Five stars for being fast, easy and delicious . It was also a great leftover for work the next day. I make chili a lot and this was a nice change. I love slow cooker meals that have great protein and fiber. This was nice and healthy!

The soup was good but I had expected it to be thicker than what it was. My friend made taco soup before - a different recipe - and hers was a lot thicker.

Delicious soup! I've never made anything like the before and was amazed at just how tasty it is. I left out the tomatos since I don't like them and used heinz baked beans instead of the chili beans but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Just scrumptious.

You can leave out some of the cans of beans and tomatoes and add more taco seasoning to taste if preferred. Nice to put in a slow cooker if needed, but not really a must. Just let soup simmer awhile rather. I make the taco seasoning from this site and use. Will make again.

You know a recipe is a hit when both your kids and hubbs text you to tell you dinner was a amazing!!! Whoo hoo home-run. I did make a few changes and doubled it so we would have a few meals during this cold December.  Added two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies and cumin.  This is a must try!!!!

Delicious and filling, but high in sodium. This is a good (and easy) meal to have occasionally. I would make this again! Make sure to have a good can opener! There are many cans opened in this recipe.

I substituted tomato soup for tomato sauce, black beans for kidney beans and didn't add the chilies or water.  It was great.  More like a taco chili.

Deeeelicious!!!  Made it just how it says, used blue moon beer and "hot" Chili beans along with "original" not mild tamatoes  & chilis..had a little kick!   Only thing j did differently. Was i cooked it on high instead of low because I wanted to make sure all of the alcohol would be evaporated as I have kids.  Will be making again!  ;)

Really good.  I used homemade taco seasoning instead of the premade packaged stuff, dried kidney beans, frozen corn, and 6 peeled roma tomatoes (instead of canned).  I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site.  Served with shredded cheese and sour cream and corn bread on the side.  It was similar to chili, but I liked this much better.  My 8 year old daughter was happy to take this in her thermos for lunch today.

This is my all time new favorite soup!! Only change I made is to brown the beef with the taco seasoning before putting it into the crockpot. When it was done I finsihed it off with a dollop of sour cream, grated cheese and crushed taco chips! A home run!!!

I thought this was a good soup.  We made corn muffins with it and/or tortilla chips.  There was one glitch when I went shopping for the ingredients.  Couldn't find chili beans.  Even when I asked the grocer he scratched his head and said it was his understanding that chili beans were kidney beans.  So I just used 2 cans of the kidney beans. No biggie.  It was yummy!

Haven't actually tasted the finished product yet but I think this is a great base.  I made a couple changes.  I used three different beans (black, pinto, and kidney) and I used fresh corn not canned.  I used one can of diced tomatoes and for the second can I used a can of diced tomatoes/jalepenos.  I omitted the water and used a can of tomato basil soup and also kept the can of tomato sauce.  I kept the onion and added some minced garlic.  I also added a seasoning packet for a slow cooker fiesta chicken into the mix and I browned the ground beef with the taco seasoning before adding it to the mix.  It smelt wonderful and tasted great.  Its cooking at home right now and I'm sire it will be delicious tonight with some shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips! :)

Pretty good with others suggestions such as adding taco seasoning and ranch mix with the ground beef.  I used 1 can of beans (black), 1 can of stewed tomatoes (easier to get around to since my daughter hates tomatoes), 1 cup of water, no corn, & kept the rest the same

Super easy to make.  It was a bit bland at first, desperately lacking in flavor.  I suspect this is because only one small envelope of taco seasoning mix was required.  Taco seasoning mix envelopes are designed to flavor only 1 pound of ground beef.  By adding 2 cups of water and all the other vegetables (with their juices!!) it was pretty tasteless.  I added about 4-5 tablespoons of chili powder to give it some flavor.  Once everything blended together it had a very nice flavor.  Chili soup.  It was twice as good the next day and everyone loved it.  I did not serve sour cream or chips with it, but am certain this would have made it over the top delicious.

I loved this! Added a glop of sour cream and a little cheddar cheese spreads when I served it. Also served with Fritos scoops. I adored it, but my husband said it was okay, hence the 4 stars.

Another great hearty soup! I through everything into the crockpot, went to work, came home well past the 8 hours and served the soup. Everyone loved it! It is very much like the chilli I make but the sour cream and the cheese made it much more taco-like. My 15 year old son stirred the sour cream and the cheese into the soup and said it made it taste even more like a taco! Definately a 4.5 star rating from me!

I made this while I was at work. I browned the hamburger the night before with cumin. The next morning before I headed off, I threw it all in the crock pot. When I got home, I had a wonderful meal waiting! I omitted the chili beans, green chillis, and onion. I simply forgot to add the onion. Instead of chilli beans, I used black beans. I only used one can of the tomatoes and 2 packs of taco seasoning. It was amazing and I will definatly be making it again!!

Excellent soup. Very easy to make.  I have also made Becca's Taco Soup and prefer this recipe - it had more flavor - spice and salt to our liking but both were excellent.  I was nervous after reading a review saying this was basically chili.  As I put it together, I thought the same thing but after it cooking all day, it was a thinner consistency than chili yet still a chunky/heart soup. Next time I make it, I will omit 1 can of the beans (personal preference -we're not big fans).

Great chili recipe, husband loved it.  My 3 year old didn't care for it, maybe too spicy.  Love how easy it is to make. Should rename this "Slow Cooker Chili".   It isnt very Mexican or anything like taco soup though.

My daughter is vegetarian and likes this soup without the meat.  We use black beans and a partial can of chili beans.

Enjoyed it immensely!  This recipe will be my new take on chili, because normally I don't really care for chili.  I made a few changes such as omitting the chili peppers since I don't like hot/spicy foods, add tomato paste, and not adding the liquid from the can corn and kidney beans, use 1/2 cup less water, add 1/2 pkg more of taco seasoning. Delish!  I will be making it again.

This is a great recipe, however I had to make a few changes. I added some hot sauce and seasoning as just the taco seasoning was not enough. I even cooked it in a roaster oven and it turned out pretty good

Awesome recipe as written!  Hubby and son said it was similar to chili.  I changed up recipe some to our liking.  Added 2 lbs of lean chuck meat, 2 packets of taco seasoning, added 2 chopped garlic cloves, 6-7 sliced of pickled jalapeño, substituted a large 28 oz can of Rotel tomatoes with diced green chilies for the tomatoes and green chilies called for, and added one extra cup of water.  Topped it with avocado slices and shredded Mexican mixed cheeses and served with sweet cornbread.  This recipe is a keeper!

I make taco soup all the time.  As for not tasting like tacos, just add 1 and 1/2 packages of taco seasoning.  It is fantastic with shredded cheese and fritos also.

I liked this! It has a lot of flavor without being too spicy (I used "mild" everything) and is very filling. I made it in a Dutch oven, stove top, brought everything to a boil, covered and reduced the temp to low and simmered for 4 hours. While I liked it, I would probably use ground turkey or shredded chicken next time, but I will make it again! Thank you!

I have made this soup exactly as the recipe states, and it is fabulous.  It's one of my favorite recipes to make, and it's so easy.  We have a very busy lifestyle, so this fits perfectly in our regular rotation.  The great thing about this recipe is its versatility.  You can add stuff to it, substitute, and it doesn't matter, the flavor stays excellent.  We serve this with sour cream and shredded cheese and cornbread, and we're happy every time.

I've been making a similar soup as this one for years. This recipe interested me because it had the tomato sauce as an ingredient that my other recipe doesn't call for. I made as directed with only two changes: substituted black beans for the kidney beans and added a packet of Ranch Dressing. We loved the flavor, but I prefer a thicker soup. Next time I will drain the liquid off of the corn and use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I added chili powder and cumin, and this recipe was still extremely bland. It had no taste. My boyfriend and I had to add hot sauce and lots of seasoning to our bowls just to get some flavor.

Made this soup today in anticipation of the blizzard and losing power.  My husband loved it.  I thought it would be really spicy with the chiles but I (who doesn't like things too too spicy) thought it was very good.

This is by far my favorite recipe! I crave it all the time! I don't use the chile peppers (because I don't like spicy food) or the corn (because my husband doesn't like corn in recipes), but it's still fantastic. I add sour cream and guacamole on top afterwards and my husband adds tortilla chips! It's so tasty! I highly recommend this recipe!

I make this at the very least monthly! I usually just use whatever beans and tomato products I have on hand the only thing I deviate from the recipe on is the taco seasoning (and I do sprinkle it on the beef while cooking it) I use a recipe from this site that makes it taste completely different than if I used a packaged one. I always have all of the ingredients on hand and I usually make 4 or so batches of the seasoning at a time when I make it.

I agree with many reviewers in saying this was a chili rather than a soup.  Most of the juices had reduced after the 8 hours.  But, it was delicious!  I used a whole package of taco seasoning with the ground beef, and then added a half package to the "soup" (so, I used 1 1/2 pkgs).  If you like a lot of spice, definitely add more taco seasoning.

Was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  It isn't as flavorful as I would like.  The recipe does not designate the size cooker to use and mine is a 4 qt.  I did not add the water because the cooker was already full and was really glad that I didn't.  This a thin soup without the added water and I prefer a thick full bodied soup.  If I make again I will add another env of taco seasoning and possibly some chili powder for more flavor.  Did have lots of leftovers since there are only two of us and that is always a plus and like most foods of this type, it did get better by the 2nd and 3rd go arounds.

So easy and delicious! I used jalapeño chili beans, and canned tomatoes that had diced chiles in them, plus the can of chile peppers for a little extra spice. Topped it with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. Yummy!

This recipe is great, I did simplify a few things
-in place of the chili beans I used one can of hominy,
-cans of rotelle versus the separate cans of tomatoes and green chiles, and tomato sauce - I used mild.
- ground turkey versus ground beef
- I went for the Fiesta corn

Da Kid, my picky teen, really liked it tonight!!

This turned out to be perfect tonight since it rained and the temps will drop through the night.

I always use this as a base for chili recipes! All I do to change the recipe is omit the meat because I'm vegetarian. Thank you for the recipe!!

i have a large family so i doubled the recipe. i also bought an extra packet of taco seasoning and added it with the meat. to give it more flavor. it's also good with a little hot sauce in it. my family loves it and if i'm strapped for time i can just cook it on the stovetop! my whole family loves this soup.

We loved this recipe!  The only changes I made were to delete the water based on other reviews.  It turned out great.  I served it over tortilla chips and then added grated cheese on top with a little sour cream.  When you mix in the cheese and sour cream it really takes it to the next level.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great! I used all black beans, pureed one of the cans of tomatoes slightly for the kids and added 1 tsp of honey since my corn was frozen with no liquid. For toppings we added cheese, cilantro, avocados. Very good!

This is a good starter for taco soup but I found it lacking some of the "Mexicaness" that makes it taco soup instead of chili. I always mix my taco seasoning with my meat (I prefer ground turkey) because it keeps the taco flavor. I also add a can of black beans, drained, for some additional color. We typically don't put in peppers with the exception of red pepper flakes, because we have a family member that does not like it too spicy. We also drain the corn (which is fiesta style), and the kidney beans but add in the juice of the chili beans for added spice. Then we eat it over a cornbread casserole (2 pks of jiffy mix, 1 can fiesta corn drained, 1 can cream corn not drained and 2 eggs. Mixed together and baked at 350 for 20-30 mins).. garnish the bowl with cheese and the meal is all set!

I brown the beef (or turkey) with the taco seasoning together.  Use a crockpot liner before adding the ingredients saves cleanup. Since everything is already "cooked", I have also just added it all together in a large pot on the stovetop and served as soon as it was hot.  It is an excellent "warm-up" soup with lots of good things in it for you.  We also add the tortilla strips and cheese and sour cream dollop for extra flavor.  Top with a few chopped scallions for color.

This is a really great recipie, especially for a beginning cook like me :) 
We didn't add the second can of tomatoes (because our crock pot got too full) and we didn't add the  chili pepper because my family can't have them. But regardless, the soup was still great!!

I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker, but it did simmer on my stove for a few hours.  I doubled the recipe, added beef broth instead of water, salt, pepper and chilli powder.  It was fantastic!!!!  My son had 3 bowls!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Quite good though it was quite a bit more like Cili than soup. 1 pcket of taco seasoning wasn't enough to give it that taco flavor, next time I'll try two.  So the recipe as it is falls a bit short as Taco Soup, but made a pretty tasty Chili.

I made this almost the way it is said to but did make a few changes. (1) I cant stand kidney beans so i used a can of refried beans. (2) I only use one can of diced tomatos instead of two. (3) I did not use the can of green chile peppers but did use a can of enchilada sauce. I also took flour tortillas and cooked then right on top of the burner then cut them like you would a pizza instead of crackers. IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!! I hope this helps anyone that thinks it taste like chili.

Made with leftover taco meat. I would have given it 3 stars only due to muted flavor but me not being much of a soup person was a factor so I gave it the 4. Added green chili peppers to add flavor, didn't help much.

I wouldn't even bother with the slow cooker.  Twenty minutes and this recipe is ready to eat.  I've made it a couple of times already and we love it.  It's one of those go to meals when time is short.   I serve this with crackers and mustard because to our family, it taste just like chili.

Absolutely delicious! I played a bit with the tomato, I used a large can of crushed tomato and a small can of diced. A chili soup recipe on this site has you slightly mash the beans and I loved it so I did that as well. Use low sodium or salt free where you can! I served with light sour cream and baked tortilla chips. I will definitely be making this again!!!

I made some changes to this recipe and it turned out great! Instead of water I did 1 cup of Corona and 1 cup of beef broth. Added a little more the longer the soup cooked. I also used cumin, cayenne, a tad bit of slap ya mama seasoning, worcestershire, and I also chopped up an orange bell peppper and put in there. Oh and some fresh garlic. Instead of chili beans, I used black beans. Oh and putting a bay leaf in is always a good idea, just remember to take the bay leaf out because they are not meant to be eaten. The soup is wonderful!

We love this recipe! Super easy and super yummy! Be sure to top it with sour cream, tons of cheese and some tortilla chips. Also works with ground turkey. If you have any leftovers, this soup freezes well.

Awesome. I used 2 cans chili beans instead and a can of rotel and a can of stewed tomatoes. Garnished with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese then topped with tortilla chips. It was GONE. Everybody loved it and it is so simple!

Love it!  I didn't have 8 hours to cook so, I did it on the stove and it turned out fantastic!  I also added alittle shredded zucchini to sneak a veggie into our dinner.  Couldn't tell at all it was in there and neither could my 4 and 6 years olds.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll be making it again.

When we don't wish Chili, this is what we resort to -- a favorite any time of the year. We add hominy in place of the corn and I will throw in 1/2 cup of rice. Great Recipe!

Loved it. Add chili powder if not hot enough, but I liked it just as it was. Crushed some tortilla chips in the bowl. Yum.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Previously, I was purchasing pulled turkey from Wholefoods hot food section and it was very tastey the first time I tried it, however, the second and third time it was "ok". So I decided to make pulled chicken in my crockpot, which was even better and cheaper.  Love this recipe!!!

This was great and super easy!  I used turkey meat and browned it with the taco seasoning.  I used a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes which i chopped and then i added 1 can of Rotel instead of the green chilis.  I didn't use any water and the consistency was perfect.  Also added additional seasonings like cumin and chili powder.  Served with fritos and cheese.

AMAZING RECIPE!!!!!!! I loved it, it was easy to make and so delicious! I made it on the stove top on medium setting, so it took about an hour to simmer. I also added cilantro and chili powder to make it spicy.

Made this and it was sooooo good!  Even better warmed over the next day.  I did double the tomato sauce and half the water.  Ate it with a little chedder cheese, plain greek yogart (in place of sour cream) and some thin salad tortilla strips on top.  Delish!  I think next time I may try it with some ground turkey to be a little healthier.

Great recipe as is, or to add seasonings as you wish. The best part is that this recipes doubles easily and still remains wallet friendly. Kids love it as well, especially served with shredded cheeses and tortilla chips. I have used leftover taco or burrito beef filling and replaced all or part of the tomatoes with salsa. You can even go as far as adding leftover rice and pasta, remembering to adjust seasoning for any extra bulk. Always a go to during "slow cooker weather"!

I have made this many times...exactly by the recipe and also customized my own with what I had on hand.  I do like to add the ranch mix, black beans and great northern beans and also usually double this recipe.  I made it for our family reunion weekend and not a drop left.  Also its even better the next day.

Doubt I'll make again. It was fine for a soup, but I apparently prefer chili, since I kept wanting this soup to be thicker.

My kids loved this, and they are very finicky about trying new things.  I made it without the beans and doubled up the corn, to make it more appealing to the offspring!  So so easy.  Will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! I just dumped everything in and was done. My family loved it so much they fought for the left overs. My son wants to know if we can have it again real soon. Big hit! Also great to make nachos out of leftovers, just drain a little juice before putting over chips and add cheese.

We really liked this and I'll make it again. I didn't have a taco packet so I used a chili packet instead- with a little added taco seasoning I had. I used 1 can of black beans, and 1 can of white beans as we don't care for either bean it called for. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes- and that was delish! Topped it with sour cream and grated cheese- yummy! I served it with whole wheat, grilled, tortilla 'n cheese.

Excellent recipe, I only made a few minor changes, and that was I added three stalks celery, and a can of peas, a can of V8, tomato juice, and some red pepper flakes because I didn't have any peppers on hand. Everybody loved it, any my son keeps begging for more. So good, YUMMY!

This was very easy to make and tasted very good. I ground the beef the night before and put it in the frig. The next morning all I had to do was pour the indgredients into the cooker and turn it on.  We ate it with corn bread one night and with corn chips the next night.  Both ways were good.

This soup is basically chili but with taco flavoring, several people wanted the recipe so I guess that means it was well liked! I will do it again and probably add different beans and other veggies.

Standard recipe but easy and satisfying.  Just like chili as many other reviewers have noted.  I substituted ground chicken for the beef, black beans for kidney beans, chicken broth for water and added minced garlic and fresh cilantro.  Served with tortilla chips sprinkled on top.

Really good!  Only 4 stars because our family isn't huge into soups, but the flavor is good.  I did have to tweek the recipe slightly due to what I had on hand.  I had to use 1 can red beans vs. kidney.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce vs. the 8oz.  Used 3 cups of water just to keep it on the soup side vs. chili side.  I didn't have diced tomatoes or chile peppers, so used 1 can of Mild Rotel tomatoes instead.  Flavor is good!  Topping soup with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, & cheese makes it!  Simmered on "keep warm" in my crock pot for 12 hours because that's how long it took us to get home!!  Froze extras for another day and again, will pop back in the crock pot.  Excellent recipe!  Will use again!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was easy, but it seemed like bland chili with some corn added.  I'm open to trying the suggestions others have made to give it more zip.

This is an exellent recipe. Tasted even better the next day. I used chilli hot beans and red beans because that is what I had on hand. Also used my own taco seasoning (less sodium) which can be made by combining 2 tsp chili powder, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper. Will be making his recipe alot this fall!

Quite delicious.  But can sizes in my area (SW Ontario, Canada) are a bit different than listed in the ingredients list, so I had to improvise a bit.  Also, I'm not sure what's meant by green chile peppers.  I substituted a can of pickled jalapeño peppers, which made the overall soup perhaps a bit too hot.  This recipe is for a larger crock pot than I have, so it overflowed a bit.  Yield size of "8 servings" doesn't help.  As others have said, this soup is almost more of a chili than a soup, but nevertheless it was quite delicious and very filling.  Can be eaten as a meal.  I like serving this sort of soup with tortilla chips instead of crackers.

We just made this today and it's amazing!! I did what some other suggested and did the ground turkey with the taco seasoning ..onions..and 2 garlic cloves then added everything to the crockpot. I didn't have green chile's on hand so I used cayenne pepper. We will surely be making this alot! would be a good dip for nacho chips too!

UPDATE: JUST MADE A BATCH OF THIS TO BEAT THE COLD WEATHER BLUES (FALL IS SETTING IN EARLY HERE IN THE WINDY CITY). I HAVE TWO SUGGESTIONS. FIRST, TRY ADDING A (SMALL) PACKET OF DRY RANCH DIP & DRESSING MIX TO YOUR MEAT. FINALLY, MAKE YOUR OWN TACO SEASONING! BILL ECHOLS TACO SEASONING IS EXCELLENT!!! TRUST ME. THESE TWO "TWEAKS" HAVE A HUGE IMPACT. GARNISH EACH BOWL WITH YOUR FAVORITE TACO TOPPINGS - SLICED BLACK OLIVES, CHEDDAR CHEESE AND GREEN ONION COME TO MIND. MMMMM! :) This was pretty good. I'm always on the lookout for easy, slow cooker recipes to make during my hectic work week. This fit the bill to a T!!! This is pretty similar to RaisinKane's chicken taco soup with a few (one obvious!) minor differences. Because I like the use of beer in RaisinKane's soup SO much, I substituted a Corona (lite) for the water called for. My only other change was to use HOT tomato sauce (Rotel brand) and (2) 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of using plain tomatoes and a separate can of green chiles (what I had on hand). Dressing up bowlfuls of soup with crushed tortilla chips, shredded Mexican-blend cheese and chopped cilantro took this to a whole new level. My fiance and I were full and quite satisfied (especially with all the garnishes!). Frozen margaritas hit the spot on this hot, Midwest evening (and paired nicely with our soup). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Janeen! :-)

This is awesome if you put some fritos in a bowl, then a couple scoops of this topped with some sour cream and cheese...  My husband loves it, and the left overs only get better.

This soup came out perfectly. The only thing I added was a generous amount of ground cayenne pepper while browning the ground beef ( I like really spicy food). I also added some garlic powder and onion salt while browning the ground beef.

We made this in the camper last weekend and it was great after a long, cold day.  I used the suggestions of others--replaced one can of tomatoes with Rotel and water with chicken broth.  I ended up adding a can of water because it seemed too thick, and I left out the tomato sauce for the same reason.  When I make this again, I will add a little lime juice just before serving because it just seemed like it was missing something.

So I altered this quite a bit which is why only 4 stars. Instead of taco seasoning I used the ingredients in taco seasoning (cumin, garlic salt, red pepper, chili pepper, onion powder) I mixed these spices with the hamburger while it was browning. I drained the liquid on the corn and used 1 12oz can V8 and a 12oz can of beer and about 1 cup of water.  The only other difference was that I used chili tomatoes and I didn't have any tomato sauce. Tasted great!! Also Black Beans go great with this too, and add more color!

Skip the beef - put all ingredients in crock pot - put 2 FROZEN boneless skinless chicken breasts on top. cook as directed, shredding chicken just before serving.  We can't get enough of this!

I always follow recipe the first time I make it and I thought this was good but it was a lot like chili to me. It was good but next time I think I will try some of the things other reviewers suggested.

First time I made this I made it as written and it was just so-so. Decided to make it again on the stove as more of a chili. Seasoned the meat with taco seasoning and garlic while browning. Used all the same ingredients just didn't add water. Much better this way!

I have made this many times now.  This is very good.  I put it into the crock pot with whatever beans I have in the pantry.  Let it cook all day and then freeze into individual containers for eating on those days when a hot soup is needed but too lazy to make it fresh.  Very good way to get some beans into th diet.

This got rave reviews. I made it with kidney beans and black beans, and 2 cans of tomato sauce, without the added water. Came out more like a chili than a soup, but amazing nonetheless!!! Served with homemade tortillas and fresh sour cream. Yield is a ton though, but I'm on my way to give half the leftovers to homeless shelter now :)

I thought this was pretty good. Changes I made was some ranch powder, a can of beef broth (in addition to the water), an extra can of green chile peppers and a little more chili powder.   Ultimately, though, it was still basically chili, just with more wetness. I was hoping more for something new.

I altered the recipe a bit:    2 cans whole kernel corn  2 cans Heinz chili style beans  1 can diced tomatoes  1 can tomato sauce  1 onion  1 clove of garlic  meat and taco seasoning as written.    The result: I was very disappointed in the spiciness. Next time, I will add chili powder to improve this.

I think this is a great base to get you started! I add 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro, 1/2 minced jalapeno pepper, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp salt and some of the taco seasoning along with the chopped onion to the meat as I am browning it. If you want it spicier, add a whole jalapeno! I add the meat mixture to my slow cooker with the chili beans, 1- 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes, 1- 14.5oz can of medium spicy diced tomatoes and green chilies, rinsed and drained kidney beans, drained can of corn, tomato sauce, the rest of the taco seasoning, 2 tsp chili powder,  and 1 tbsp brown sugar. I stir it until well mixed and then remove 1/2-3/4 cup of the soup and puree in the blender with a tbsp of water. Then add that back to the soup and cook on low in my slow cooker. I don't bother with the 2 cups of water, because I like my soups thick! Top with crushed tortillas, sour cream, green onion, guacamole, salsa, or whatever else you like! If you have too much leftovers, freeze it! (Doubt that will be a problem, though!)

I thought this recipe was good, but to us it needed a little more flavor or spice. I read others' suggestions to use broth in place of the water, and I'll try that next time if we make it again. It just tasted a little watered down to me, and I like things a little spicier.

3 stars Liked It Very tasty; it uses pre-packaged seasoning and has high sodium content (imo). Very easy to make.

This soup is delicious!! I use a can of chicken broth instead of the beer and a can of kidney beans instead of black beans--we top with corn chips. We had this when family came over the other night and all of them really enjoyed it, too!

This was fantastic! Since the leftovers were a bit thick(as expected), We ate it as a dip with tortilla chips.

I love this recipe. I use chicken breast instead of beef and a lot more beans(kidney, black, pento and chili). I take the chicken out about 30 minutes before serving and shred it. I also use a home made mix of taco seasoning instead of store bought but that's just a taste preference. Overall it's awesome and a great for days when I don't feel like making a big mess in the kitchen. Thanks!

I am surprised people who rated this said it was bland. I am a salt fanatic and usually add more spices to recipes too. But this didn't need it, I thought. It was great. I used leftover ground beef from the night before and it worked like a charm!

Very good and SOOOO easy.  This is going in to my file as a great throw down recipe for days that I just don't really have time to cook.  I added a can of fire roasted diced tomotoes and a can of diced jalapenos.  My husband and I like heat!  Ladeled it over tortilla chips, sprinkled a little chedder cheese on top with a dollap of sour cream, YUMO!

Great, Easy recipe.  I used Chicken Breast seasoned with black pepper and garlic that I baked for 30 minutes covered before adding to the soup.  The chicken came out shredded after cooking down in the soup and it was delicious. I also added a clove of garlic chopped.  This was a delicious soup - we ate it all and enjoyed every bite.

Always a hit at any potluck. Discovered by chance that this recipe can be vegan friendly by removing the meat, and finding a taco seasoning that doesn't have milk product. The vegans at work loved it!

Great Taco Soup! I did use a bulk taco mix from allrecipe that was nice and spicy. Great for busy afternoons when you have a bit of time to put everything in the crock pot in the morning.  I did put one can of chili beans but forgot to soak beans (cheaper than canned) so I put in some chick peas that I had already cooked and it worked nicely. Also, I had a can of Ro Tel tomatoes with green chili peppers that I replaced for some diced tomatoes and chilies.  Had leftovers and shared with my MIL.

Excellent with slight revisions.  I used Yves Meatless Ground Round instead of beef... couldn't tell the difference.  Added 3 cloves minced garlic, reduced the water a bit, and instead of prepared taco seasoning made my own of:  ground cumin, chili powder, oregano, cilantro, cayenne pepper, paprika, kosher salt, and black pepper.  Also added some spinach to get some greens.  YUM!

Good pantry/freezer recipe. (I'm always looking for emergency meals that don't require a trip to the store.) The flavor of the canned tomatoes in this soup were a bit overpowering for me. I would try substituting a can of broth for one of the cans of tomatoes. Or maybe omit the can of tomato sauce.

I made this last month for my sister-in-law's superbowl party. It was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly. We served it with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream. People kept going back for bowl after bowl. I thought it could be a little more spicy, but everyone else said it was perfect. I will definietly make this again!

Loved this recipe! I made it for a group of friends and everyone loved it. In fact, I had to hand out the recipe to my friends and they are now making it. The plus to this recipe that it is really good the first day but even better the second day.

It was good. had my husband spice it up a bit more an hour before it was ready. He added some more chili powder, and worchester sauce. He loved it as it was like a chili. Added cheese to the top of each bowl and some tortilla chips.

I am giving this a 5 though hubby and his partner at work think it tastes more like chili :)  They like this recipe better then the normal one that I usaully use.  Did make a couple of adjustments to make it suit me better though:  didn't use caned beans; used the dried kind, used a whole can of tomato sauce (15 oz.), and 1 1/2 cans of water, and no onions or chilis.  Though I might try the chilies next time I make this.  And I also added some paparika.

Very quick and easy. I only had 1/2 an onion, so I sliced it and sauteed it with the ground beef.

This was great and so easy!  I couldn't get chilli beans so I put in regular baked beans and it was still really, really good.  Thanks!

Really Good! Should have been called Taco Chili. I liked the broth but if you like thicker chili, use less water.

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added some cumin to the seasonings.  Excellent; and very filling.  The crushed tortilla chips. grated cheese, and sour cream add to the flavor and texture.

This was real good.  It reminds me of chili with a great kick.  I used other reviewers advice and browned the meat with the taco seasoning as well.  Will surely make again.

We loved this with ground turkey instead of ground beef.  We reduced the water to one diced tomato can full and used frozen corn (no liquid).  It was more like taco chili - very yummy with cheese on top.

This is a great recipe, tho I added 1 t. cumin, 2 large garlic cloves and  added 1 bottle Corona instead of the water and some chopped jalapeno to taste.  The beer really give it a great and different flavor.  Family loved it !  and soooo easy.

This isn't bad, but I thought the soup itself was a little bland.  I even added half of an extra packet of taco seasoning near the end, along with some cumin and chili powder while cooking the meat, but it seemed like it was missing a little something.  However, once you added the corn chips, shredded cheese and sour cream, the end result was pretty tasty.  To me though, it seemed more like chili than a taco.

Hate to be the downer on this recipe, but didn't care for all the taco seasoning(it talked back to me!).  Maybe use half the envelope?  We still prefer the skinny tortilla soup from Light N Tasty.

My husband was craving his grandmothers taco soup so I tried to find one as close to her recipe as I could remember. The only difference was I added ranch beans in place of the kidney and chili beans, and added a packet of ranch dressing. Was great comfort food for a chilly fall evening, and made great leftovers.

Excellent soup! Followed recipe except for using green onion instead of regular onion - ran out. Tasty, great for cooler weather. With all the beans - probably VERY healthy.
Margaritas weren't bad to boot!

Added the ranch mix, garlic and taco seasoning while browning the sausage.  Otherwise kept the same.  WONDERFUL with sour cream and cheese added in at the table!!  Oh, and I only had it in crockpot on high for 2.5 hours.

This was so good and everyone loved it. I did not follow recipe exactly as I omitted the kidney beans. I doubled everything and made a huge amount but failed to double the taco seasoning. I was good but lacked the flavor that it needed. It reminded me of very thin "chili" soup. Next time I will use two packs of taco seasoning when i make a large amount. Otherwise really good, will definitely be making this one again!

First soup I tried and it tasted wonderful.  Instead of using a can of hot peppers, I used one can of diced tomatoes with hot peppers in it and one regular one.  I worked perfectly.

This is one of my favorites!  I was given this from a friend who got this at a Weight Watchers meeting. When I make this, I use ground turkey.   I don't add the chilies (I don't like them) and add a can of black beans and pinto beans as well.  I add lots of garlic and mexican stewed tomatoes.  The recipe also includes adding a package of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix.  I add it if I have a pack in my pantry.  Not necessary for a delicious meal.  Everyone I have made this for loves it!

This soup was delicious!
I made a couple of changes to spice things up a bit.  I added 2 packets of taco seasoning mix and about 1 teaspoon of hot chilli powder.  It was just the right spiciness for our taste!
I will definitely be making this again.  It was so simple to put it all together and it was ready to eat when I got home from work.

We thought it had a really good flavor, and was really easy to make.  We served it with cheese, sour cream, and Fritos and it was delicious!

I love this recipe but favor the Chicken Taco Soup from this site.  The only thing I do different is use Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning and it is to die for!  LOVE this recipe!  So easy too!

This was good in that you dump everything in the slow cooker and let it do the work for you.  Was good, but seemed like it needed more of a boost in flavor.  Will play around with other spices next time I make it.  Great meal for a busy work day.

This was very popular with my family but I wanted more substance. It just tasted like a bowl full of beans. Maybe more veggies next time and less beans.

Like others, I doctored this a little- as written, I'd give 3-4 stars, but with some extras, it is between 4 & 5!
I took the advice of others & sauteed the onion w/ the meat (I used turkey) and the taco seasoning. Added the rest of the ingredients minus the water and used a bottle of beer instead. Also threw in some cayenne & chili powder for flavor/heat and would use a jalapeno in the future if I had one.
Served w/ tortilla chips & shredded cheddar. Perfect for winter!

This soup was pretty good, but I've had better taco soup.  The 2 C. of water is too much.  It really waters down the soup.

How Fanstastic!!  I absolutely loved this recipe, so did hubby, daughter and my "picky-eater" son.  I did make a few alterations however: I omitted the corn simply because I have never liked corn added to any of my recipes, I reduced water to 1 1/2 cups, added 1 can mild Ro-Tel & lastly I used 2 pkgs. taco seasonings instead of 1, just for the added kick. It was a bit spicy, but for us - just right. Slow-cooked on high for 3 hours and WOW ....! Thanks so much for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

We all thought this was great!  I omitted the kidney beans because we don't like them, but other than that it was fantastic!  I served it with sour cream (which made it very creamy - yum), tortilla chips and sprinkled cheese.  Great meal for a cold fall night!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times for pot-lucks and always get asked for the recipe. I put Green beans and one can of potato soup in mine also with 2 cups beef broth.  Terrific with cheese and sour cream on top.

I really wasn't expecting this recipe to be so good...it was fantastic! And so easy. I live in Kenya so I had to change some of the ingredients...didn't have chili beans or tomato sauce so I used 2 large cans of tomatoes blended, 2 cans  of kidney beans & 1 cup water. I also added some garlic and cumin. Simmered for only 4 hours. It was so easy and my family devoured it! Excellent recipe! I served it with cornbread (homesteader recipe from this site). Yum!

This makes a big batch of soup.  It filled my slow cooker right up to the top!  It did add a bit more chili powder and some cumin. I will use black beans next time instead of the kidney beans. It makes your house smell heavenly while cooking and it tastes very good.  My whole family enjoyed it, even by very picky teenage son. It is really like a Mexican chili.

Loved it! Omitted the onions because husband doesn't like them.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly.  Served with cornbread and it was fabulous.

I love this recipe!! It's sooo easy! Plus it's delicious. My husband and I eat it with Fritos or tortilla chips and a dollup of sour cream. Mmm Mmm. It's great to come home to on a cold winter day and tastes just as good reheated.

Loved it!  The whole family gave it 5 stars. I didn't do it in the slow cooker.  I just cooked on the stove for a while. I cooked the onions with the ground beef because of that. I added more chile powder and cumin because I didn't have another packet of taco seasoning.  I also garnished with cilantro and diced avocado.  Next time I will try garnishing with shredded cheddar cheese too.

Just ok.  Had to use 2 packets of taco seasoning, and only 1 cup of water.. still too watery.  Flavor just didn't make me say "wow."

Very easy and very delicious.  I followed other rater's advice and used some spices in my meat while browning, and only used one cup of water (we like a thicker soup) and one can of tomatoes (all I had) and it was excellent.  My husband loved it, too.  Served with shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips crunched up on top.  Thanks for sharing!

Made the changes that the other reviews suggested.  The next day needed a little more substance with the leftovers so I added one more can of tomatoes and a tin of black beans to stretch out what we had left and simmered for 1/2 hour.  Terrific!

FYI - My crockpot is a hand-me-down from my mother; circa 1975 (but it still works so what the heck). I mention this because at 3.5 quarts it seems smaller than most recipies out there today. 

I could not add the 2 cups water to this recipe based on the size of my crockpot. In addition to the standard recipe: we added 1 extra onion (raw, didn't brown), 4 oz. green chilis, 1/2 lb ground beef {1.5 total} browned with 1 packet taco seasoning and 1 packet ranch dressing. 

Once in each bowl we added shredded Mexican variety cheese and a generous dollop of sour cream and served with tortilla chips. 

The BF and I both agreed that we'd make this recipe again but would add more flavor - perhaps cayenne pepper or a little hot sauce once in each bowl. My version came out very thick but had a nice crunch with the 2 onions. Cooked it probably 8-10 hours while we decorated the house for Christmas. Enjoyed it basking in the Christmas lights with some red wine!

I've been making this recipe for a while now, especially because it freezes so well. I use 2 cans of Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes and adds a little more kick I think.

I followed the recipe but subbed pinto beans for kidney beans and tomato soup for tomato sauce as per reviewers' suggestions.  It was super easy and was pretty good.  I think it could use more heat so next time I'll spice it up a bit more.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  The only thing I changed was that I used a diced steak instead of ground beef.  I also didnt add the tomato sauce. It turned out very very good and not to thick.  Then when we put sourcream, tortilla chips, and cheese in it, it became a thick chili consistancy.  Very good.  And my husband loved it too!

I loved this soup! I made the mistake of adding two taco seasoning packets and it gave me heartburn, but I have always been sensitive to spices so next time I will stick to just one packet. Boyfriend didn't like, but then again, he doesn't like spicy foods. But if you do, it is a good recipe!

This soup was so easy to make, and tasted great. Leftovers were good too! I used one package of mild taco seasoning for the ground beef, and added a package of "hot" taco seasoning to the soup. I used something called "Mexi-corn" in place of corn, which was just corn with peppers and spice added. This soup was hearty, and quite spicy, I loved it. I would not recommend the extra hot taco seasoning unless you truly like it hot!

LOVED this!  I drained the corn, added only 1/2 the can tomato sauce, and ranch seasoning packet.  Came out delicious!  We poured frito chips into bowls, then topped them with the taco soup/chili and sour cream, shredded cheddar, and frito chips.  Leftovers are even better.  My husband's coworkers requested he bring it again, and more of it a day after he brought it in his lunch.

Very good.  I used two packets of taco seasoning - one on the ground beef and the other in the soup, two cans of diced tomatoes in sauce and another half can of plain tomato sauce and one cup of water.  It came out with the perfect consistency.  Very tasty and makes a lot.

This is one of the family favorites and gets in the rotation frequently.  Good enough for guests and so, so easy to make.  I only gave it 4 stars because I drop the 2 cups of water to make it thicker (more like chili) and still is enough for 4 adults and 2 kids.

This soup went over an absolute treat with trhe gang at work.  I made a small, 4-person batch by ommitting one of the cans of tomato, but adding the water.  I also threw in some jalapeno, 'cause we like things spicy.  Tastes great, it's a snap to put together, and not to hard on the wallet, either!

Very good soup. Very easy to make. I added a packet of Hidden Vally ranch dressing mix, as I had seen in other recipes. I cooked mine on the stove in a pot and it did need the 2 cups of water. I enjoyed this so much and it was also a BIG HIT

My family and I loved this soup! I loved how easy it was to make, just throwing everything together. The only changes I made were that I used about 4 cups of frozen corn (per my mom's request) and I did drain the kidney beans. I have also used black beans on another occasion in place of kidney beans and that worked great as well. I like to eat mine with cornbread and crumbled tortilla chips on top! This is definitely a keeper in my house.

This soup was great and easy to make.  I followed others suggestions and added pinto beans, one more taco seasoning and reduced the water by one cup.  Great topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Cilantro might be good too.

This is a family favorite of ours.  I can't even count the number of times that we have fixed it over this past year.  I have a 6 quart crockpot so I double the recipe and add more hamburger which makes it a bit thicker.  It comes out more like a mexican chili.  My teenagers love it! We aren't crazy for onions in our soup/chili but we love the flavor that they give to food.  I only use half of what the recipe calls for and chop them very fine in my food processor.  I use rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis and a can of diced tomatoes in tomato sauce instead of the tomato sauce, peeled and diced tomotatos and can of diced green chilis.  We top our bowls off with fritos and cheese and enjoy!  Thank you for sharing such an easy and tasty recipe Janeen!

I made this recipe minus the water, added red pepper and chili powder- turned in basically into a Chili.  We have a Chili Cook-Off each year in October.  I WON!  I have made this recipe again just recently using the water but still adding red pepper for a kick.  That's the way we like it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It was great.  Will definitely be making again.

I made a few changes to it. I made it with the taco seasoning recipe from this site,left out the 2 cups of water and used two cans of pinto beans instead to give it an actual authentic taco soup appeal seamed to be a bit more mexican-ish instead of what it called for.I made this recipe for our church home group and everybody loved it. It got great reviews from everybody. Many people asked for the recipe for this one. AWESOME RECIPE thanks for sharing!!!

I loved this recipe because it was delicious and super easy to make!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beek and it tasted great.  Next time I will add 2 seasoning packets for more flavor and /or omit the 2 cups of water.  The soup gets watered down in the crock pot as it's cooking, so there's probably no need to add extra water.  Thanks for the recipe--will definitely make again and again!

Very good! I forgot to add the water and liked it that way-not too watery. I used McCormick mild taco seasoning and only used half the packet. Will make again!

Great recipe.  I used two packets of taco seasoning.  One reg and one hot and it was too much heat for my taste.  Next time I will use two reg. taco seasonings.  Added black beans and used others ideas of the Rotel tomatoes instead of reg.  Will make again for sure!

This soup was easy to prepare and delicious. Even better the next day after it was refrigerated and rewarmed.  I added some shredded cheddar over the top before serving, and had some tortilla chips sprinkled over too.  I froze the leftovers and just ate it recently and it was just as delicious as if I had made it fresh.  Some chopped cilantro over the top would also make a nice addition.

Excellent!  I make this with extra lean ground turkey and an extra can of black beans just because I like them!  My mom who doesn't like ground turkey loves this!  I don't think she knows the difference.  We make this all the time!

This soup was very easy and was really enjoyed.  When preparing I accidently left out the 2 cups of water - when I went to put it in several hours later I decided not to.  I think it might have made the soup to thin for my family.  I substititued on can of the diced tomatoes for one can of  rotel tomatoes with green chilis for just the right spice.

I made this using 2 cans Mexican Rotel and 2 cans chili beans and it was so yummy.  I also made this by the recipe and it was good that way as well.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!  I will be making this for years to come!

Oh my goodness!!!!! I made this last night for my boyfriend and I in the crock pot last night and he absoulely loved it!!!! I was very impressed with the flavor and taste! I didn't do anything different! I took the advice of using the shredded cheese and sour cream and just by doing that, it made it that much better!!! Definitely a favorite that will be repeated numerous time during this winter season!!! Great job Janeen!

We love this recipe. I did make one addition.  I add a 16 oz can of refried beans to add a little thickness. This is great, easy and very inexpensive meal.

Wonderful soup - one of our new favorites now!  The sour cream, cheddar, and tortilla chips (we used the round, white corn type to dip out the soup to eat or crushed on top) are a must to really get the most flavor! I've made for home and also taken to 2 outings, and everyone who has tried has liked it.  My daughter didn't care for the corn in it, but I liked it.  It could easily be omitted though.  A great recipe! It well deserves 5 Stars - and more!

I loved this - it tastes just like chilli, only has a nicer consistancy. I added two packages of taco seasoning and some grated cheese on the top. We'll definitely make this again!

Seemed very similar to chili.  Didn't have chili beans, so I used another type of bean, and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  A big hit with the family, although there was alot of it.  For lunch we reheated it, put it on toasted buns with shredded cheddar cheese on top, then in the microwave it went until the cheese melted.  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I only made one change and that was because I don't know what chili beans are so I used two cans of kidney beans.  My 12 year old loved it...had two bowls.   I topped each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and put some tortilla chips in the bowl.  Terrific!!  Will definately make again.

Very good; I just made this on the stove and not in the slow cooker, but it still turned out pretty good. Mine didn't turn out very "soupy" -- it had more of a chili consistancy. Overall, very good, though! Goes great with fritos and cheese.

Everyone in my family loved it!  This will be a recipe we make again and again.  Very easy to make.  So it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids I bought the diced tomatoes can with the green chile peppers already in it.  It was just spicy enough for them without being too spicy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Another reviewer was right... it is just thin chili. I was expecting something else especially after the rave reviews, but this wasn't so special. And I have way too much left over.

Wow, this is delicious! I served it with sour cream, shredded cheddar and nacho chips crumbled on top. I would definitely make again. My husband did sprinkle about 1 TBSP chili powder an hour prior to it being ready, for a little kick. Other than that, it doesnt need a thing.

It was good.  Next time - I will serve it with something.  I had chips, sour cream and cheese on top - but It still needed something more...not sure what.

This is terrific.  I made it with turkey, and left out the peppers (didn't have any on hand).  I also added a pack of Ranch Dressing Mix as my previous recipe called for.  This is replacing my previous taco soup recipe!

My thirteen year old ate three bowls.  He is usually a picky eater.  This was good over chips with sour cream or cheese on top.  I will fix this again when I need a quick dinner.

What a hit!! My whole family loved this and we ate it two nights in a row. Terrific!!! I changed it just a little bit...added one more can of chili beans and no water except for what was in the beans and corn. That gave it more of a stew consistency and we used Fritos Scoops instead of spoons. :) Have added it to my recipe box!

My wife's not much for this type of dish but she and my grandaughter did a good job eating it. My son-in-law loved it. I was afraid it might be too hot and was going to leave out the chile peppers then found a small can of diced tomatoes with chile peppers and used that. It was just right for my taste. I'll need to make a lot more next time, may have to borrow a couple extra slow cookers.

My husband loves this recipe!  I've made it several times especially during the cold months.  We also like to add shredded cheese to top ours off.  If you don't have time to cook it all day, it works just as well cooking on the stovetop.

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I topped it with cheddar cheese and fresh chopped cilantro. Plenty of flavor in this, but i might use beer next time.

EASY, EASY, EASY!!!  My husband thought it was great, and my son finished his bowl.  A great way to get healthy food items into my family without a lot of fuss.  I've made similar soups with variations on these ingredients, and they usually get a good review from my family.  I would probably like it better with more "heat," but with kids it's best to make it as written and add some hot sauce to my individual bowl.  I'll make it again.

Loved this recipe. Read several of the reviews used the ones which complimented the recipe and eliminated the items which did not appeal to me. I added chicken, beef, sausage and shrimp. Added the beer for favor as suggested. 

Made enough for an army, hubby loved it. Took it to work and everyone raved over it. I will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I actually used leftover taco meat.  The idea of adding corn didn't do much for me.  Usually when I make tacos we alway make Spanish rice, I added the leftover rice to the soup, which was absolutely a wonderful addition.  I topped with crumbled fritos....  Delicious!

My husband really like this soup. Need it for lunch? Cook it all night in your slow cooker and it is ready in the morning. I drained the corn. and added some brown sugar to taste. (It took away the bitter taste w/o making it sweet. I will make it again

This was great!  So easy to prepare!  I omitted the peppers, put 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans and cooked the meat with the onion the day before.  Just threw everything into the crockpot and cooked it for 8 hrs.  Served it with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Was even better the next day!  Next time I will not add the water as we like it thicker.

Even though I used 2 envelopes of taco mix this tasted just like chili. If I make it again, I'll definitely kick it up a notch since you couldn't identify the taco flavour whatsoever.
It was quite good nonetheless.

I thought this was a good recipe.  I couldn't fit all the water in and i totaly took out the onions.  Could have been a little more spicy, next time i will add chili powder.  More like a chili to me than a soup.

My husband loved this (I'd give it 4 stars).  I used ground venison, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  The corn added a nice bit of sweet crunch.

I too thought that the soup needed more flavor, so I added two packages of Taco seasoning. Salt, pepper and Seasoning salt made it much better. I was also only able to add one cup of water because I did not have room in the crockpot.

My husband and son loved this!  If you don't add the water it would be a great taco stuffing.  We couldn't find chili beans so we just used two cans of kidney beans.

I made this for a Mexican Tupperware Party and everybody loved this soup.  They wanted the recipe and I told them to come to this website.  I told them that most everything on this website is fabulous.

Loved, loved, loved this soup...although it's more like a chili in my opinion.  But so easy to make and it tasted soooo good...and I'm not  a big soup eater either.

This was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was great. It was easy to make, but I felt the flavor was missing something. I ate over tortilla chips with cheese and sour cream. It was just ok, thats all. Hubby enjoyed it.

GREAT SOUP & EASY TO PREPARE.  I made this for our church's youth group progressive dinner and it was a hit.  My husband (who does not care for soup) even tried it and told me I could make it again anytime.

I put this in the crock pot this morning and it was ready 8 hours later. My family loved it and I wish I had of double the recipe. We did not use natchos or sour cream, rather pan fried tortiallas with pam. mmmmm

I'll add my 5 stars!  This is a really quick and easy, warm and delicious meal!  Like others suggested, I used two cans of black beans (rinsed) instead of the kidney and chili beans.  I also used tomatoes that had jalapenos in them, instead of adding the chile peppers.  Also, added some onion and fresh minced garlic to my ground beef for an extra bit of zest.  Served with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  A great pot-luck recipe that has joined my list of favorites!

This was a great make ahead meal.  It goes together very easily and requires very little prep work.  It make a big batch of soup, so I freezed the rest.  When I reheated the frozen batch I added some a couple cups of cooked elbow macaroni.  It was delicious.  I think rice would be a nice addition also.  Thanks for a great new keeper.

This was very easy and tasty! I substituted chili beans with canned chili con carne and the canned tomatoes with canned stewed tomatoes. It was very "chili" like and had a kick from the taco seasoning.

I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving instead of hamburger.  It turned out very good.  I added some cumin and tabasco sauce for some more flavor.  My husband loved it.  Will make again.

Awesome recipe!  LOVE, LOVE LOVED it!  Very flavorful, super-duper easy.  Made it in the crockpot, but could easily simmer on the stove for a few hours to speed it up.  Didn't subsitute a thing.  My husband wanted a bit more heat, but I felt it was perfect as is.  If more heat is wanted, add a few shakes of cayenne pepper (either to an individual serving or the whole pot).  Thanks for this great recipe!!!!

YUMMY! I thought I would have enough left over to freeze, or at least to last the week out. Nope, this was eaten by family and visitors very quickly. Definitely a keeper! I also substituted black beans and used ground turkey.

My family LOVED this meal... I subtracted a can of diced tomatoes and added a can of corn.  It was great with a dollop of sour cream and about a capful of lemon juice per bowl.  I served it with fresh french bread, and my husband found that it was really good to dip instead of chips!

Yummy....I used ground turkey instead of the beef, sauteed the onion and 2 cloves of garlic with the meat...then transfered to the crockpot. I didnt add the chili beans...just the kidney beans, and I used 1 can (11oz) of mexi-corn. I also added the 2 cans of tomatoes but used one that had jalepenos in them for a little more heat. Easy recipe!!

AKA liquid chili.  This was delicious, I added more seasoning, chili, cumin, also several drops of tabasco which made it 5 stars.  I forgot to buy corn chips so I had with pillsbury crescent rolls,  My daughter couldn't stop eating this.

Very tasty.  Pretty much like chili, just thinner.  I didn't add the peppers and it was still very good.  I used regular chips on top and all the trimmings.  It tasted even better the next day.

I made this for a church chili dinner and got RAVES!  I changed the recipe just a tiny bit.  I, like several other reviewers, used the diced tomatoes with added green chilis.  I used black beans instead of kidney but drained the liquid.  I also added bell pepper, half of a green, red, and yellow.  It was fantastic.  As to what to do with all the extra bell pepper, chop it up and freeze it in a plastic bag for later!

Loved this soup.  Definitely love the grated cheddar cheese and sour cream on top.  We also recommend adding a few drops of Tabasco Sauce to individual bowls per taste.

This was a great dish!  I replaced the green chiles with 2 diced Jalapenos for an extra kick, and used 2 taco packages instead of one.  I did drain the juice from the corn only.  Even the kids loved it!!

Very easy to throw together with a great flavor! I used the canned tomatos/chili combinations instead of a can of tomatos and a can of chilis, turned out great and was less to purchase! Very good for the winter months served with Tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese!

This one is a sure keeper!  I did drain the kidney beans and I didn't use quite 2 cups of water as we like our Taco soup thick.  Served it with cornbread muffins. Leftovers heat up nicely in the microwave.

Very easy meal to throw together in the morning! I made this for a party and all seemed to enjoy it. Would definitely make this again. I did have a dollop of sour cream on the top of mine and served the soup with tortilla chips on the side. Yum!
My 3 year old even ate it!!

The absolute keeper of all keepers from the recipes I've tried on this site.  The only thing I change is adding 1/2 pack of taco seasoning.  Delicious!!

This is a great recipe for busy households!  I love using my slowcooker and this also reheats wonderfully in the microwave.  I added an extra can of beans and omitted the chilis (my kids don't like spicy food).

Excellent!  I added a cup of white rice to thicken it a bit (as suggested here).  Served w/ a little sour cream, tortilla chips and cheddar cheese.  Makes A LOT!  Plenty for leftovers tomorrow and for freezing.  Thanks!!

This recipe is wonderful and really hits the spot when you come home to it simmering in the crockpot at the end of a cold winter day. It tastes equally good as leftovers.  I usually leave out the corn because I don't like it and also often leave out the chiles because I always forget to buy them. I love it served with a dollop of sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar (and with cornbread if I'm not too lazy or watching my calories too much!).

YUM!!! Used 2 c. frozen corn with a little water. I hate canned corn- too sweet!(yuck) This is healthy, too. Put chips in your bowl first!! Add cheese & SC on top.

This soup was excellent.  We added shredded co-jack cheese, sour cream and corn tortilla chips when we ate it and it was great.  We had enough left over for lunch the next day and to freeze for later.  This soup is even better as left overs.  The only thing I did differently was I only added 1 cup of water.  We wanted it a little bit chunkier and it was great.  I will definitely make this one again.

The best thing about this soup was that it made a lot. However, only one person ate one bowl. The comment I got was "it's O.K." My teen-ager tried a bite and didn't care for it. I doctored it up a bit but something is missing. Won't be making it again.

Great soup!  I used black beans (drained) instead of kidney and a can of Rotel instead of 1 of the cans of diced tomatoes and the green chiles.  I didn't have time to use the crockpot, so I just simmered it on the stove and it was wonderful.

I always like easy-to-make recipes...the less work I do, the better! It made a large amount of soup, I had to freeze some of it! It was okay to me-I probably would make it again, but for me it wasn't one of those "DEFINITELY MAKING THIS AGAIN!!!" recipes. It was okay.

This is THE BEST!  It is quick to throw together, it is healthy, and it is delicious.  I also add a can of drained green beans.  I have made this many, many times.  The hubby and kids love it!  I have tried different kinds of beans and it always turns out excellent!

Fantastic!  Although, I did make some alterations.  I DID NOT add the liquid from the kidney beans...I think that's just gross.  Also, I substituted a can of original rotel for the diced tomatoes...it came out with perfect amount of spiciness.

This soup had just the right amount of kick.  I used black beans instead of the one's called for in the recipe and it turned out great.  I also sauteed the onions before browning the beef- then mixed it all togther in the crock pot.  I will make this again-

Very easy to make.  Similar to chili, but more of a soup.  Freezes very well.  A very good recipe!

This was an ok recipe. It lacked some spice...not sure which or what but something. I am not sure if I will make this again because it is similar to the Chicken Tortilla Soup I that I found on this site, only the other is much better and not missing the extra flavor.

YUM!! This is one of our favorites around here! Definitely agree that it is more like chili than soup (but although I'm not a chili fan, I LOVE this "soup"), particularly since I add a little less water than called for. I also add extra green chilis because I love them too! Served with corn chips, sour cream, and shredded cheese this makes a delicious meal in a bowl!

More like a hearty chili than soup. I don't buy seasoning mixes so instead of the taco seasoning I used about 1 tsp. ground Arbol Chili, coarse ground black pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper. The chili, black pepper,and salt I added at the beginning, the red pepper about 20 minutes before serving. Also I used frozen corn instead of canned and reduced the 2 cups of water by 1/2 cup. I will make this again.

Very good. Is a bit like chili with vegetables, but so what? Super good taste.. doesn't even need meat in my opinion. I will certainly make this easy recipe again!

I was a little skeptical when I read the recipe and it had a can of this and a can of that, but this was so tasty and so easy.  I am not much of a beef eater, so I used ground turkey instead which I think has more flavor when mixed with mexican spices.  I also only used one can of beans and simmered it on the stove for 30 minutes instead of using the slow cooker. So quick and easy.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a can of rotelle in place of one of the cans of diced tomatoes.  With some reduced fat sour cream and some blue corn chips it was a hit. This is a keeper!

I left out the corn (just personal preference) and sub'd garbanzo beans for chili beans, and salsa verde for tradtional red, as that's what we had. I also threw in a diced Anaheim, a chopped green pepper, plus a can of diced tomatoes. It was great. This is an extremely adaptable recipe. I'm not sure if it was featured as a recipe for TG leftovers, but if it wasn't, it should have been! A keeper for sure.

Great recipe- I love how easy this recipe is to make. Great for this time of year.
It could stand to be a little spicier by my taste.   Next time I make it I will probably try two cans of rotel diced tomatoes w/ chiles instead of the diced tomatoes and one can of chiles to see if it spices it up any.

This was like watery chili.  Although the flavors were good, they weren't especially 'taco-y'.  I didn't mind the soup, but probably won't make it again.  I make good chili, and the Six Can Chicken Tortilla Soup recipe from this site has more of the Tex-Mex flavor I was looking for.

This is a great chili recipe.  I especially like the corn.  It's easy to throw everything into the slow cooker and let it simmer all day.  The sour cream and tortilla chips are a definite necessity.

This is one of the best chili recipes EVER!!!! My boyfriend came up to me after his third helping and announced that this has officially become our chili recipe (though the title says soup, it is a chili like others have said).  It was so good, he even cleaned the crock pot after it was done!!!

YUM!  You don't need as much water as it calls for (we had a LOT of broth even using less than the 2 cups).  Other than that, it is perfect.  If you like sour cream, that makes it even more taco-like.  Very good, recommended!

This tasted good, but we took the advice of other viewers, and substituted tomato juice for water, and only used one can of chilies.  It was too acidic for us.  If I make it again, I'll try it without the tomato juice substitute.

this soup was great ! i used rotel tomatoes, and stewed tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes.
i did not use any water, and put in 1 lb of mexican velveeta at the end. i also only simmered it in the crock pot for about two hours after it came to a boil.this recipe is a keeper!

Wow! This was so easy and so yummy!  I omitted the water so it wasn't so soupy and added cubed velveeta cheese at the end. Very good on a cold night, or at a casual get-together.

This was a lot like chili.  My husband is not a soup lover and had seconds of this, so that's a good thing.  If you'd like it to be more soupy, just add some more water.  

We also had this another time with guests, one of whom is allergic to gluten.  Since the chili beans and most taco seasoning packets contain gluten, I used plain black and pinto beans, and a packet of fajita seasoning.  Everyone loved the "soup/chili", and there were no leftovers.

I found it tasted very similar to chili.  I was skeptical because you basically just threw everything from a can into the cooker but it was very good.

This was the hit of the party! We loved this soup! Though I did add a packet of ranch and reduce the water by a half a cup it still turned out excellent! Thanks!

Excellent soup. It made a nice big pot. I made it on the stove instead of crockpot and it was wonderful that way also.

Terrific!  I was given a similar recipe from a friend and she added a packet of ranch and Rotel.  I use black beans and pinto beans and add an extra can of corn.  Try these add-on's.  You'll love them.

I was expecting more of a soup consistency when I decided to try this, but loved it just the same.  Following suggestions I read, I served with tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded Mexican blend cheese. Yummy!

not spicey enough for our taste.  easily added crushed red peppers and black pepper.  we used no salt added tomatoes and reduced salt taco seasoning and it was just about salty enough.

I have made this soup 3 times for special groups and I find that I omit the canned green chile peppers when making for a group a people, some of which may not like spices. Otherwise it is suberb in flavour. I use chile beans with spices added to them.

Easy to assemble; the guys loved with a football game.  Adults may like it with a little more heat. Add some chili powder or serve with Jalepenos on the side. Goes great with a lager or pilsner beer.

This was great with corn chips, sour cream, and chedder cheese.  The next time I make it I am only going to use 1 cup of water instead of 2.  I think I would like it a little thicker.
