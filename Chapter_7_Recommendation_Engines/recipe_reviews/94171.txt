I've been making this version of stuffing for years, I do however purchase the Jimmy Dean sage sausage not the plain version and I also add 2 eggs instead of one so that the stuffing holds together a little more and that way it doesn't get dried out at all.  It's wonderful!  You can also add apples or pears too.  I highly recommended it.

I took this recipe and made as directed.  Then I rolled the stuffing into meatball size balls and baked it for 30 minutes on 350...they turned out awesome and gave it a little character as well. Sprinkle with parsley or paprika for some color and it's just something different with chicken or turkey.  Great basic recipe though!

This stuffing was so hearty, it could be used as a main course.  We stuffed it in our bird and it was delicious!

This recipe will replace the traditional one my family has used for over 60 years!  Very flavorfull and the addition of the spinach and carrots give it great color!  1/2 of this recipe was more than sufficient to stuff a 15 pound turkey still using one egg and a 15 oz can of chicken broth.

Had this over the Easter holiday forgot to write my review.  I was slightly afraid to attempt this I must admit, however it turned out lovely.  Will make again.

This is excellent stuffing. I totally agree with Kim who says Sage Jimmy Dean Sausage is better.I use the Sage sausage too and the difference is hugely delicious!

I make a vegetarian version of this with veg sausage patties (ground up in the food processor) and vegetarian broth. Add a little extra olive oil to compensate for the lack of grease.  It is really good and everyone likes it!

Turned out very good but as other reviews stated..IT MAKES A TON!  I used one pound of sage sausage and one pound of regular jimmy dean.  Very good and husband ate on it for several days after thanksgiving.  I also did not add the spinach...forgot to buy it.  And we did not stuff our bird.  Enjoy!

This is the only stuffing recipe I need for the rest of my life, it is just so good. I make it just as it says and its perfect BUT ITS JUST ONE POUND OF SAUSAGE NOT 2, they must have made a mistake there. I'm sure you could alter things a bit as well.

Didn't use spinach or carrots. I used sage sausage, celery, onion, turkey broth, Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing cubes, eggs, etc. Just trying different ways. One time I added toasted walnuts, then cranberries, then my favorite...water chestnuts.

Let me start by saying this: My Mother never likes anything I cook. However, this recipe even had her asking me to be in charge of making this every year for Thanksgiving for the remainder of the eternities. I agree with her. It is so delicious! It was the first time I ever made  stuffing and it was perfect. The only thing I changed was I used the Jimmy Dean sage sausage. It turned out perfect, and my family talked about how good this was a week after Thanksgiving.
