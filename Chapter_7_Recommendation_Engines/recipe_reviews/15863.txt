My family loved this recipe.  I did however, use a graham cracker crust instead of the plain crust.

Omit the condenced milk, add a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring/extract. Don't over stir and add shredded coconut...omit the milk as this will make it funny or too thin, simply not needed. Then you will have a perfect pie!

Ilove this recipie. I had it years ago & lost the recipie book it was in during a move. I've been looking to find it again for quite some time It's fast easy. I like that it makes 2 pies because one just goes way too fast.

I don't know what I did wrong but the filling did not set and ended up a gloppy mess that was practically impossible to serve.  Has a yummy flavor, but not as delicious as I remembered. I plan on freezing the 2nd one and trying to serve it semi-frozen.
