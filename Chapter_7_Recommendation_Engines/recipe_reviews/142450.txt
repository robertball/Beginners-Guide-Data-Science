I have the benefit of living currently in Greece where "fresh greek yogurt" is available in endless varieties: full fat, 2%, non-fat, skinless, with skin, flavored or not ... you name it!
Please do not strain your yogurt; you lose all the prebiotic cultures that are soo good for your health!
To overcome the "rock-solid" effect the day after you freeze your desert try either of the two: 1. disolve 1 tsp unflavored gelatin in 1 tbsp water and 1 tbsp lemon juice, and stir in before you freeze, or 2. (provided you don't serve it to kids) stir in your mix a good shot of vodka or favorite "sweet liquor" like peach schnapps, kalhua (coffee) or baileys.  The alcohol keeps it from freezing to a rock.
Great - simple recipe! Will keep churning!

This is very similar to David Lebovitz's recipe from the cookbook Perfect Scoop.  Except that he calls for 1 tsp. vanilla.  I made this recently and could not stop eating it!  It is SO good!  If you like true frozen yogurt.  It does get very hard in the freezer after awhile which doesn't bother me but just let it sit out for a little to soften up if you prefer it that way.  You can also add pureed fruit to the mixture before freezing to make flavored yogurt.  I plan to try using low-fat yogurt next time. ***UPDATE: made this with 2% yogurt and half sugar half sun crystals (Stevia and cane sugar) and was disappointed.  It froze really quickly in my ice cream maker then got rock hard in the freezer.  Won't be making the lighter version again anytime soon.

it's delicious and it works with some adjustments. Make sure you STRAIN the yogurt ( place a mesh strainer on top of a bowl put some nylon or cheese cloth on it pour the yogurt on top of the cloth fold the ends to cover and refrigerate for no less than 6 hours or overnight).... i used fage yogurt and even though it says strained-yogurt i still went ahead and strained it again. i don't have an ice cream machine yet so i used the freezing directions from the recipe "peach frozen yogurt" from Stephanie Norr

I only made one change--I used one whole teaspoon of vanilla. No ice cream maker, I mixed this up in my blender. I just whirred it in my blender, froze it once, then scooped it out and blended it again, then refroze. This is SO good. All of it is gone, no leftovers. Next time I'll double it and maybe add a cup of fresh berries. The grtat thing about this dessert is it's cheaper than any prepackaged frozen yogurt you can buy pre-made and I was able to coupon greek yogurt for almost nothing--so this dessert cost so little.

This recipe makes me want to go back and change every recipe I've ever given 5 stars to and make them all 4 stars. I've never tasted anything so incredible. The texture of this frozen yogurt is nothing short of remarkable. It's unbelievably creamy. I could keep gushing. I used fat-free Fage Greek yogurt but the mouth feel of this frozen yogurt feels like I used nothing but heavy cream. It's just so creamy. Yum. I mixed the yogurt with the sugar and vanilla as directed and then just dumped it straight into the ice cream maker. I added some dark chocolate chips. It's 10:30pm and I just came back to the freezer to eat some more. This stuff is better than ice cream. So so good. I want to tell my husband about how awesome this is but then I know he'll eat some and I don't want to share.

I made as directed and then thought to myself why not use "vanilla" yogurt instead of making plain yogurt vanilla. This was ok and good at the soft-serve consistency and has a very strong yogurt flavor (which is ok it is yogurt put through an ice cream maker). This however turns into a block of hard frozen solid yogurt when allowed to ripen in the freezer so it is best used immediatley. If frozen solid you can leave out to soften but then why do you use an icecream machine. You get the same result if you put some yogurt in a bowl/container and place it in the freezer bringing out to stir a few times before it freezes solid and serving before that frozen solid state.

Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best. This is the case for this recipe. I sometimes add extra vanilla just because I love it!

This is a delicious recipe, although I suggest adding another half teaspoon vanilla extract. After I mixed the ingredients, I poured the mixture in my Kitchen Aid ice cream attachment. I left the yogurt in the bowl and put it in the freezer overnight. It was rock hard in the morning. But then I put the bowl in the refrigerator for the day and by the evening it had the most wonderful soft texture like the frozen yogurt you get out of the machines. And it was yummy too!!

"Exceptional!" says my husband. Usually he says "Interesting." So I decided to write my first AllRecipes review. Such a simple recipe. The first time I tried it exactly as written but for my tastebuds there was a bit too much 'yogurt' taste. So then I followed the advice of another reviewer and added one shot of Baileys and some mini chocolate chips. This improved the flavor (and hard freezing issues) but I still wanted to mask the yogurt a bit more. Eureka! I mixed together 3 cups unstrained greek yogurt with 3/4 cups white sugar and one Tbsp vanilla extract 3 Tbsp Baileys & 2 Tbsp Kahlua and poured the mix into ice cream machine. Followed normal machine instructions. Then when it's ready remove & stir in 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips by hand. Voila! Something 'Exceptional'.

I used oikos greek yogurt an like others used a full tsp. of vanilla. I will add that I make my own vanilla (using vanilla beans and vodka) and maybe it was because of the vanilla but my yogurt had the best texture not too hard but not too soft. Perhaps using real vanilla instead if imitation could keep it from becoming rock hard after freezing overnight. This is an awesome recipe for those who like the genuine frozen yogurt and has all the promise of versatility with any addition you would like to make. Next time I am adding blueberries! Thanks for a great recipe!

OH YUMMERS!!! This was tasty! I did double the vanilla as others suggested. The thing we did not like was that we added frozen blueberries also suggested in other reviews. Wish I'd left those out. Some advice from reviews is best left ignored and this was one piece I should have passed on by. Will indeed make the frozen yogurt again though! Mmmm!

So simple and so good! Took the advice from previous reviewers and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. Also added a shot (2 oz) to prevent it from freezing hard. Works like a charm! We tried both Bailey's and Buttershots. The Buttershots was an amazing flavor addition! We served it topped with fresh sliced peaches and blueberries. We have tried 3 different vanilla frozen yogurt recipes this summer and this is the one we will make again. Next time we plan to try vanilla vodka.

Used the greek yogurt I had which was vanilla. Added Kefier reduced the sugar since I used the vanilla yogurt and added blueberries - it turned out wonderful! As others described - cream & flavorable. This was so easy to make and will be a regular in our house.

This is hubbys 4 stars I would give it a 3. I think he liked more than the rest of us...used vanilla bean Greek yogurt....I dunno....it tasted ok to me...wont have anymore though...very tart and tangy as if lemon juice was added (and it wasnt). Although appearance and consistancy was spot on. I was looking forward to it but not what I expected. Used our new ice cream attachment for the kitchen aid for the first time and that worked amazing. As long as hubby liked it....he made it...lol....thanks for the recipe!

Made this exactly like the recipe. Couldn't be easier - and absolutely delicious. Very rich - a little tangy. Reminds me of Red Mango. Will be fun to make again and do some add ins. The best recipe I tried yet.

To keep this from freezing rock hard I followed a suggestion in other recipes and added 1 Tablespoon of canola oil. It was still hard but not like an ice cube!

Quick and easy if you have the ingredients on hand (no cooking and waiting for it to chill) and it tastes good if you like real yogurt.

Just a few suggestions for those who say it turned into a frozen block: Sub out some of the sugar with honey. Maybe a couple of tablespoons. Honey acts like invert sugar or corn syrup. It helps to keep ice crystals from forming preserves the smoothness. Also make this in small batches and don't let it sit in a freezer for more than an hour or two and you will find that it scoops up just fine.

My teenage daughter is a vegetarian who does not eat enough protein so I decided to buy an ice cream maker and make my own frozen yogurt to replace ice cream. My family LOVES this recipe. This is what I did different. My ice cream maker came with directions for 5 cups of yogurt so I used 5 cups of whole milk Fage yogurt and 1 1/4 cups of sugar (1/4 cup of sugar to 1 cup of yogurt - which is what this recipe requires). I did not strain the yogurt but I added about 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I also added 1 tablespoon of vanilla. After five hours in the freezer the yogurt was still soft. I think next time I will try it with 4 cups of whole milk yogurt and 1 cup of 2% for a lighter texture.
