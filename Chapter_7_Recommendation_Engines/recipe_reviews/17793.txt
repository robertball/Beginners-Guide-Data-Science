Loved the mixture of flavors!  So simple, yet so good!  I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks, and served it over plain white rice.  Note that if you don't peel the apple, the peel 'bleeds' on itself after a day or two, and doesn't look very pretty.  The 2nd time I made this, I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed.  I think I prefer the chunks!  Note that one bunch of chopped green onions goes better with this dish than regular onions (in my opinion), and it also adds some color.  I didn't find salt and pepper necessary, by the way.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think this was very good.  To its credit, the flavors were better the next day, but I will not make it again.

A very good recipe, I added extra brown sugar and it was very tasty.

A lot of reviewers said it tasted best the next day for left overs so I made it tonight and will let it sit till dinner tomorrow.  I will be serving it with couscous and a garden salad.  It smells delish!

Needs something extra to spice it up a bit, like curry.

This is much better with raisins and more brown sugar, but it lacks something... I'm not sure what.  This recipe comes with a challenge!  May the force be with you.

This recipe didn't quite work for me. It was surprisingly bland and unexciting both in texture and taste. I think the basic idea is good, but this recipe needs some significant tweaking.

Awesome for ham leftovers. I put some soy sauce on my couscous & it perfectly balanced the sweet from the fruit. Thanks Caity-0!

I made a mistake and added the remainder of pinapple juice to the mixture instead of just the pinapples and, obviously, the sauce was thin but it did not seem to affect the taste that much.  I liked it and the kids liked it but hubby didn't like it (it's the fruit mixed with rice thing)...We'll make it again when hubby is away...

Wow!  So unique yet so popular.  I was a little apprehensive about the apples at first, but all the fruit fit perfectly with the pineapple flavored ham.  Next time I might add some mushrooms.

I thought this was fantastic.  I tweeked it a little and added some slightly chopped pecans, the crunch made it that much more fun to eat.  I would suggest adding the apples just before you are done so they are a little crispy instead of mushy, but that's just me. I served it with some cous-cous and my 2 year old even asked for seconds!

This receipe was ok. My husband didn't make his yummy sound which means he didn't like it. I think it was just a little too sweet.

I thought this was a really nice recipe.  I took some of the comments from other reviewers to heart an made a few changes.  In order to cut the fruitiness that some people complained about I swirled in a teaspoon or so of toasted sesame oil with the olive oil and threw in 1/3 Cup chopped red pepper.  I cooked my couscous in chicken stock with a small pat of butter and salt and pepper.  Then in fluffing stage of the couscous I threw in some toasted sesame seeds to tie it all together.  I thought it was great!

This recipe worked great for me!  It cooked up quickly-as I had cut up everything ahead of time & kept the food in the fridge until it was time to cook. My son who has Sensory Integration really enjoyed the meal as written.  My husband added pecans, my 15 yr old daughter added craisins, I added both craisins & pecans.  We served it with Jasmine rice and a combo of peas & carrots.

I made this today as a side dish for a Christmas dinner which had to be stretched to add 6 more people.  Without it, the excellent meal would not have felt like Christmas.  It was a big success.  We were 11 at the table.  I doubled the recipe & served it hot with no base like rice or couscous.  I followed all suggestions: used bunches of green onions (greet idea, the greens added color contrast), the addition of a small amount of soy sauce, letting it cool and rest for maybe 4 hours (as if overnight - really soaked in juices and softened the ham), then heating & serving...  While it was great, I wouldn't give it a 5; it's just not that magic of a recipe.  Still for a recipe that I found by typing in the ingredients I happened to have at home -well, except the green onions, a change I made later - this turned out very well. I cubed & chopped everything by hand.  Without a food processor, it takes much longer than 35 minutes!  Yet, it's very easy.

Very good. I suggest using a green apple as the yellow apple that I used got a little soft, and 5 minutes is a little long to cook the fruit.  Also soy sauce on rice underneath makes a good salty/sweet combo.
