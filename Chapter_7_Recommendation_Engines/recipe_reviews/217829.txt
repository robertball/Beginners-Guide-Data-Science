Very good, however, the second time I made this I did add some other seasonings. I did add celery, 1/4 cup, thyme, and a pinch of red pepper.
We did like the fact it was vegan. Thanks.

This was absolutely delicious. Lots of veggies, creamy and hearty. Used 2c light cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk, so it wasn't vegan, but was vegetarian. Also, used frozen corn instead of canned, because I don't like canned corn. Thanks very much!

I am vegan, and my husband is gluten free.  I substituted a few things:  coconut milk for soy milk, and gluten free flour for flour.  I also added extra garlic and some sage.  Fresh parsley really did the trick too.  Due to the xanthan gum and cornstarch in the gluten free flour, I ended up adding an extra cup of vegetable stock.  I will add some Phoney Baloney's Vegan Coconut Bacon (also gluten free) once my next shipment comes.

VERY DELICIOUS CHOWDER, AND I AM PICKY!!!!!

Almond milk in place of soy makes for a creamier broth, plus a tablespoon of corn starch.  The trick I use to add a kick is Old Bay seasoning...AWESOME!

This was tasty. Used some corn starch to create a thicker stew. Fresh cracked pepper gave it a nice taste. Needs a kick of some sort. I'm not a cook so i'm not sure what would help...

This recipe was pretty good and super filling, like another reviewer I added pepper to give it a bit of a kick. Very comforting and hearty dish. It was nice to have a vegan version of this classic as I've been vegetarian for a few years and am trying to make that vegan step and this didn't make me feel like I was missing out. I agree with the author that it does have a more...creamy broth taste, as opposed to a full out cream taste, but I appreciated that as I'm not the biggest fan of cream soups. Definitely worth a try! Makes a lot too.

Just finished making this recipe. I skipped the oil (oil-free vegan here), garlic powder and flour. If you like your chowder thick, then adding flour or cornstarch is ideal. I like mine somewhat "loose". I just mashed some of the potato pieces with the back of my spatula. It became creamy. Or you can always use hand blender too. I used only 1 tbs of parsley, 1 no-salt vegan bouillon instead of broth, added couple cloves of fresh garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1/16 tsp of cayenne, 2 stalks of celery (chopped), 1 tsp of Old Bay and only used 1/2 tsp of salt. I can't wait to eat it for dinner tonight. Thank you for the recipe!

A really tasty, satisfying soup. I substituted 3 ears fresh corn  for the canned, and fresh parsley for the dried. Also, I used half and half in place of soy milk (though no longer vegan, super creamy). I will definitely be making this again!

So excited about this vegan chowder! I used a potato masher to mash some of the potato, which made it creamier. Mine was super thick, and I even added more liquid, probably 2 more cups. I also added red bell pepper, celery, and thyme. Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe!  My sister is vegan, so I'm always trying out new dinner options when she visits.  This one is at the top of the list of vegan choices for us. We usually keep almond milk in the house instead of soy, so I substitute that and it tastes great!

I used a package of frozen corn, coconut milk and instead of flour used corn starch, and just a dash of cayenne.  Thanks for this recipe, it is a real keeper.

I absolutely loved this dish. I did add a couple stalks of chopped celery and some vegan chicken flavored bouillon cubes for a little extra flavor. I also added a bit of salt.  I believe next time I will go a little easier on the garlic powder., maybe a tsp instead of tablespoon. I ate 3 bowls and it warmed my tummy. My husband is not vegan but he enjoyed this also. Thank you so much for the recipe. Oh, I left the red skin on the potatoes for a little extra color and nutrients.

This is a good recipe - healthy, tasty and easy to make.  I added potato/carrots into half cooked onion/garlic to keep the flavor and reduce one less bowl.   The soup is a bit light so next time I will add more garlic and perhaps thyme.

Made this recipe twice (I found it a bit too salty the first time, so I cut down on the garlic salt the second time around) - absolutely love how quick and easy it is to make! I think I might try it with creamed corn next time around :)

This was delicious. I did omit the onion and garlic part since I didn't have much time. It was fine, I did add some cayenne and paprika to give it a kick (since other reviewers said it needed an extra kick)

It was great for a cold fall/winter day and I really enjoyed it. One thing I would say is, make sure to whisk the milk and the flour really well, or else you'll have clumps of flour in your soup. I used almond milk, since it's my non-dairy milk of choice.

Loved it! It turned out very nice and creamy. I skipped the garlic and halved all the ingredients as I didn't really need 8 portions. Also substituted the vegetable broth with water and Vegeta seasoning, and added some chickpeas and some broccoli.

Easy recipe! I used 3 small yams instead of potatoes and coconut milk instead of soy milk because thats what I had on hand. I also sautéed a pasilla pepper with the onion/carrot/garlic. When everything was fully cooked I used a masher to give the chowder a creamy consistency. Added lots of black pepper to cut some of the sweetness of the corn and yam.

This was so good I may make it again next week.  I don't think I made mine as thick as the recipe called for, but I rarely follow a recipe exactly.  One addition I did make was a sprinkle of crushed red pepper to add a little heat. I will definitely be making this again!

I did not care for texture. It's not a foolproof recipe. I added the hot pepper and allspice as suggested by one cook and it helped with the very bland flavour. I think  I  purred  too much of the soup. Texture was thick and unpleasant. Would not make again.

Delicious - had my man raving and scarfing it down. I'd add about a 1/2 cup more carrots and use more like 8 of the red potatoes. I also added more like 5 cloves of garlic, but that's because we always at least double our garlic amounts. Great recipe!

This was yummy and easy to make. Did not have all the ingredients however,  I did leave out garlic, carrots, and vegetable broth. As a substitute for the vegetable broth, I used 1 cup of water and added 1/2 cup to the soy milk.

I read the previous reviews prior to making and added celery for extra veggies and used almond milk because I prefer that over soy. My husband did not believe that this soup would turn out as a chowder without butter showed him and he ate 2 bowls.

This was a really good tasting recipe; however, I would have called it 'potato chowder' instead of corn chowder! Our potatoes must have been really large. One thing I did differently was I shredded the veggies in the food processor, so the potatoes were really thin. It took over 40 minutes for it to cook, not 20 as mentioned.  Definitely will make it again, as it was a hit at our house.

I  made this as main course for an October gathering of 14 people.   It was tasty  and hearty.  No one seemed to miss the meat.  I doubled the recipe and had a little left over.

After reading other reviews I decided to add (before doubling) 1/4 c of diced celery, a pinch of cayenne and thyme.  I didn't have garlic powder so I substituted onion salt and eliminated the salt.  Instead of two cans of whole kernel corn, I used one can whole kernel and one creamed corn.

I expected the parsley to be overpowering, but it was just right.  I was pleased with the soup.  It was hearty, tasty, made a lot, and it was vegan.  I expect to make it again.

This was very filling and tasty. I don't think it needs further thickening with flour, so I'll skip that step next time.

I love this recipe at the very end however, I pureed half of it and added heavy whipping cream then mixed it all together it was delicious.

The original recipe didn't work for me so I improvised a bit. Put a lot of different veggie to make it hearty like potatoes, celery, carrots, mushroom, kale even. I also added a bit more spices to like the other reviewers. Dash of cayenne pepper,  more pepper.  onions and turmeric. Overall it was a good base to work with and play around with.

used water instead of soy milk, skipped the flour part completely & added some celery. This was still thick and tasty, with slightly less calories.

3 stars because it would be bland as is, would give 4 if included other reviewers suggestions. I added celery, 1 tsp thyme, pinch of cayenne, and extra black pepper.  Boiled off more of the broth. Omitted garlic salt and used extra fresh garlic.  Less regular salt as well.  Came out hearty and still pretty mildly flavored, like comfort food.   Might use cornstarch and also extra soy milk next time.

Made it according to recipe and it was pretty bland. The consistency was perfect, though. I'll try it again with added seasonings and maybe celery.

This wasn't as creamy as I was hoping for, perhaps I'll try a different non-dairy milk next time, I used Almond.  Also it was a bit bland so I added a bit of cayenne pepper and some Italian seasoning.  I used frozen corn because that was what I had on hand and left out the clove of garlic, I just used powdered.  Oh! And instead of flour I used corn starch mixed in with the 1/2 c. of almond milk.

I made this for dinner this evening.  I'll definitely be making it again, it was so good. I used 4 cups of vegetable broth.  I omitted the oil, flour and soy milk. Instead, I steamed a head of cauliflower and pureed it with garlic and kosher salt.  I added the cauliflower mixture at the end to add the look of creaminess and heartiness to the soup. I also used 4 carrots and 4 stalks of celery. I subbed two 10 oz bags of frozen corn.  I used only four potatoes-I added 2 red to the soup mix on the stove and baked 2 yellow and adding those at the end.

Great! So tasty and filling. I prefer to thicken using corn starch, so did that. It was my very time using soymilk, and very happy with it. Thank you for sharing. (:
