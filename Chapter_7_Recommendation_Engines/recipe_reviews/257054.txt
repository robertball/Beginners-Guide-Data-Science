I don't like to review if I don't make as written, but I was looking for a recipe with smoked sausage , cabbage and potatoes, and this was really good. I just couldn't bring myself to add all that sugar. A tablespoon worked fo me. Thanks Big Ray.

2.19.17  In an effort to reduce the calories and fat, I substituted Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Sausage (use this all the time, tastes like smoked sausage).  I scaled this back to two servings (would be 3 servings in this house) which called for 2 Tbsp sugar.  I used only one, but whoa, it still was too sweet for us.  Would recommend that  you start with less sugar, and add more if it suits your taste.  I also did add salt and pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I like all of these ingredients individually, but liked them even better combined.  Good, old tasty comfort food!

Loved this combination of ingredients. I did use much less sugar as suggested by others and added salt and pepper to taste. Also fried up the potatoes until browned and done. This way I could add the cabbage to the pot last and maintain some firmness in the cabbage which I prefer. Turned out awesome.

I made as directed for 4 servings. Only had 1can of diced tomatoes but used a can of stewed tomatoes also. This is so good. Will make again. It made at least 8 servings though.

Big Ray's Kielbasa Cabbage Skillet for a Crowd Haiku: "Heavy paprika. This CAN really feed a crowd. It was just too sweet." We love the way cabbage absorbs the delicious slippery-ness of sausage grease, but between the butter, sausage, and the sugar, this was just too TOO much. Paprika was also such a dominant spice that if I made this again, I'd drastically reduce the sugar along with the paprika. The recipe also didn't say anything other than cooking the potatoes for 8 min. in the microwave - covered? uncovered? stir half-way through? The pre-cooking of the potatoes added simplicity to the timing of the recipe but for somebody who doesn't usually microwave spuds, I could've used some direction.

I made this to take to a funeral gathering.  It was a total success.  This recipe made a full crockpot of food that was gone in 45 minute!     Next time, for my taste, I would leave out the sugar.  Oh, I added cumin to the batch... just made it zing!

People keep saying they don't see directions for adding potatoes , it's says in step 4 when to add potatoes. This is a keeper! The only thing different I did was add salt and pepper. This would be so good on a cold evening. Good ole comfort food!

This was very tasty and the family loved it. I made a few changes based on other reviews, I only added 1 tablespoon of sugar and less paprika. I also made it much easier by using a bag of shredded coleslaw mix instead of chopping up a cabbage. I use spicy red pepper diced tomatoes for an added kick. Would definitely add more kielbasa next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a beautiful dish with a few alterations.
First use only 1 teaspoon of sugar. I adde 1 cup of chicken broth as well during the 40 minute cooking stage. You also need more sausage or mix it up with a few different types.

I love keilbasa and I make this dish often.  We just got a new casserole Crockpot and this is just the recipe I want to use.  We also love the Southside Beef sausages which would be great in this recipe too.   In fact, a nice New Orleans dish with Andouille sausage is another great possibility with this versatile recipe.

I make it similar, but mine is truly one dish. I just cut it up, put it in a baking pan, cover with foil and bake it till it’s done. Time and temp vary depending on how much time I have.

I tried it once with the full amount of sugar but found it too much. I like it with a small pot of applesauce instead of the sugar.   Reducing the sugar to a tablespoon or two would work too.

The first few times I made this, I skipped the step of microwaving the potatoes since they seemed to cook fine during simmering. This time when I made this recipe the potatoes were still hard after 40 minutes or more of cooking. I    read that the acidity of the tomatoes prevents the potatoes from cooking , so next time I'll follow the instructions to microwave the potatoes first.

This was delicious comfort food and I loved packing leftovers for work lunches.

Really loved this.  Following reviewers, I used 2 lbs. kielbasa.  Instead of the first 2 Tbsp of butter, I cooked 4 pieces of bacon (diced) and took it out of the pot and used the drippings to saute onions and kielbasa.  Also as suggested I used 1 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp. paprika, and 1 tsp. cumin.  Will be making this again.

This recipe was liked by my entire family, especially my husband who told me to put it into regular rotation. I didn’t have diced tomatoes so I substituted with a can of tomato sauce. I used just a few pinches of sugar and half the paprika based on other reviews. I also added salt and pepper to taste. Definitely making this one again!

Excellent one-pot dinner. Made half, and was sorry we didn't have more leftovers! Next time I'll use more potatoes and cabbage than called for. Really delicious!

Based on other reviews, I cut back sugar to 1 scant tablespoon and 1 teaspoon paprika.  There also seemed to be question about how to cook the potatoes.  I diced them, put them in a bowl uncovered and microwaved for 8 minutes as directed, stirring halfway through. They will appear to be dry. I used 2-14 oz. smoked sausages and only 1 onion. After the cabbage cooked for the time directed, I simply added the tomatoes and seasonings directly to the cabbage, then added back the sausage, onion and potatoes.  There was plenty of liquid while it cooked.  No need for chicken broth. It made a large Dutch oven almost full and I will definitely make it again.

I make this all the time but I agree that is too much sugar.  I never use it all when making this recipe.  If you have good kielbasa,  then you don't need additional herbs,  sugar or spices.

I made it tonight. Used smoked turkey sausage instead and cut the sugar to 1/8 C. Otherwise I made it as instructed. It was delicious. My family loved it!

I used half a red onion, but wish I added a whole one. Yellow or red. Also added a ham slice cut up into equal squares, and added at last minute. I wish I sautéed it with the sausage. I did not have two cans of diced tomato, so I used one can diced, and two cans of spaghetti sauce (happy harvest) maybe store brand? Also only put one tablespoon of white sugar, and added two tablespoons of brown sugar. Sautéed kielbasa with garlic from a glass jar also. Through in some dried onion pieces also. Potatoes did not work out for me. I used red potatoes, and nuked them for 5-6 minutes. They were too mushy to put into the pot, so I ended up smashing them lightly in the bottom of a bowl, and served the dish over that. It was delicious!! Also added a dollop of sour cream on individual servings. Stirred that in, and woweeee!! It made it creamy and even more delicious.  Advice for next time would be to nuke the potatoes very minimally, and put in fridge to stop cooking immediately. All and all this recipe reminded me of stuffed cabbage, at least the sauce. I am thinking of doing this next time with ground beef, and maybe making a deconstructed stuffed cabbage.
As you noticed, I do not follow recipes to the exact specifications. I like to add my own twist, and most of the time I make a delicious dish. Recipes are just a basis to follow. Don't be afraid to experiment.
Loved this dish, with my own tweaks :)

Used frozen roasted chili’s instead of canned, otherwise I followed the recipe. It was very good, and the leftovers were even better the next day.

Although 1/4C of sugar is excessive (I use about 1/8-1/4tsp) ??BUT...
only if I add the tomatoes. (the sugar helps balance the acidity from the tomatoes). ifo always add the potatoes & tomatoes & my family still loves it!??

I divided this recipe by 2/3 as I only had 12oz kielbasa. I used the full amount of potatoes, medium head of cabbage, 1 can tomatoes, 2 TBS sugar and 1/2 TBS paprika. It was quite sweet and when I make it again I’ll use 1 TBS sugar 1 TBS paprika and 1 TSP black pepper.  My son thought it needed salt but I think the kielbasa provided enough.

I didn't realize I was out of potatoes but I made it anyway.  It was very good even without the potatoes!  I also added some V-8 juice.   I also  thought it was too sweet.  Next time I'll cut the sugar in half.   (and there will be a next time!!)

Made this almost exactly to the recipe and Jeff declared it his new favorite cabbage recipe!  We'll definitely do it again, perhaps experiment with various paprika (used sweet Hungarian, this time) ... a little more sausage (add 1/2 lb, but not too much more) ... might even try it with an Andouille.

I used some chicken sausage I had on hand. It was sweeter than kielbasa and I think the kielbasa would be better.  Next time.
This is such a savory mixture even though very simple.  I am going to try it with white beans for my vegetarian daughter's family.  I think it will be a big hit.
This is a simple and quick recipe with big returns.  I halved it, due to us being only two, and still have leftovers, which hold up very well.

Delicious and very forgiving. I only had one can of tomatoes and used one potato. Just wonderfully easy.

This is a great quick during the week recipe.  I used smoked sausage kielbasa and cajun style kielbasa and it was a hit. I did not add the potatoes as we don't eat potatoes very often and I used just a very small pinch of sugar.   I also added some hoisin sauce to give it just a bit more of flavor.  I definitely will be making this again.

I cooked the potatoes in the chicken broth , added that to the casserole.   Also used Octoberfest sausages along with Knockwurst only.  One can of tomatoes was stewed and small cut.  Was delicious.

Our family loved this, excellent flavor.  I would probably add a 2nd kielbasa next time so we had more for the leftovers.

I did not add sugar at all. It was good without it.  I cooked my cabbage a little longer.

Made it for 2, did not add sugar, was good, but why do a ll the recipes now have white sugar in them when it is not needed?
 Tried the same with rinsed saurkraut, That too was good.
