Great recipe. I like my chili somewhat spicy and hearty and using less peppers did the job for me. I followed the previous reviewer's suggestions and it came out great! Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!

My husband and I enjoy our chili on the spicy side.  We had guests over who don't enjoy spicy food, so I omitted the adobe peppers and only did two jalapenos.  This was wonderful.  I can't wait to make it with all of the peppers the recipe calls for!

Excellent chili.  It is easy to make and the amount of hot spices is easily adapted.

I only used 3 jalapeno peppers but it was plenty spicy! I also used a local Irish Red Ale, which was great. I look forward to trying a porter in this. I used Bush's BBQ baked beans instead of chili beans. Overall this recipe is a winner, it really jazzed up ground turkey meat!

Good chili-I used the crockpot method and it turned it well.

I made this according to the recipe. My husband loved it, but I think this recipe has made me decide that I do not like chipotle peppers in my chili. I love them in other recipes, just a personal preference to be aware of before diving in!

I made this chili tonight, and my husband and I really liked it! He loves spicy food and has complained that other chili recipes don't have enough flavor, but he loved this. I just made 2 slight modifications to the recipe - I removed the seeds from the jalape√±os, because I don't like as much heat as he does, and I used medium chili beans instead of hot because that's what I happened to have on hand. I precooked the turkey with the paprika and the onions and garlic on the stove, then dumped everything into the Crock-Pot on high for 4 hours. Since I was doing the slow cooker and we like our chili thick, I drained the juice from the diced tomatoes. It was still a little thin for our taste, so next time I'll probably halve either the beans or the tomato sauce. Overall though, great recipe!

Turned out delicious!  I used scallions instead of white onions and added mushrooms.

A well balanced chili with the perfect amount of heat. Perfect during football season.

Really excellent flavor - won "people's choice" award at my office chili cookoff.  Tweaks I made included: using Young's Chocolate Stout for the beer, adding 3 chicken japaleno and cheddar sausages (removed from casing; crumbled), 3 jalapenos instead of 4, 1 can of beans instead of 2 (which I think would have been way too soupy), and a cinnamon stick for the first few hours in the slow cooker.
