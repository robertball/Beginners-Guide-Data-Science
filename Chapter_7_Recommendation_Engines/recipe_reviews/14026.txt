I've been making this recipe for over 20 years and it's always a hit. I only use 1 package of cream cheese and I add an envelope of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese and mayo. It is DELICIOUS!!!

I had a pretty great happy accident while making these- I was in a hurry and missed the part where it said to bake the dough before adding the toppings.  Now, I'm sure this is excellent made the way it is supposed to be, but it is soooo good baked with the toppings on it!  It took a little over half an hour in the oven in a jelly roll pan because of all of the toppings on the dough, but it was well worth a little extra baking time!  I did halve both the cream cheese and mayo and add a little ranch to the cream cheese mixture.  Next time I would DEFINITELY halve the cauliflower- I used a pretty average sized head and I still had a ton left over.

Everytime I have a social gathering, I bring these.  Everyone loves them and I usually have no leftovers, to my disappointment.  I only use carrots and broccoli, and lately I've been laying the dough out as one big piece, but that's the only modification.  A truly wonderful treat.

These were fantastic!  I did the original recipe first, and we liked it quite a bit.  The second time I made it, I turned it into a BLT appetizer by using butter garlic flavored crescent rolls, using the same cream cheese mixture, then sprinkling the top with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and crumbled bacon-- it was a HUGE hit!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I orginally gave these 4 stars, but I've found that I keep making them, and everyone likes them, so I've upgraded them to 5. I made half the amount of the cream ch. mixture and it was enough for 3 batches of dough! I also added about 1/4 packet of Ranch dressing(powder). I used broccoli, gr. onion, and carrots, and real bacon bits.  A little messy, but nice looking.

This was an excellent appetizer! Everyone at the party I took it to loved it. I did take some of the tips from other reviews and added the dry ranch dressing mix into the cream cheese.

Not my favorite veggie square recipe. We prefer this with more flavor. This was a bit bland. Also, the radishes weren't very appealing and we would have preferred real bacon bits from the pouch rather than the imitation. Thanks anyway.

I had to try this because I had some broccoli and cauliflower in the fridge. I also used just one 8 oz of cream cheese and half the mayo. It was delicious. Will be taking this to our next pot luck.
