This was really, really good.  My husband loved it. The slow cooker makes it easy, and it's such a versatile dish.   You can eat it over chimis as Lori suggests or just with rice and beans.  Yum!  I'm a hopeless tinkerer, so I added 2 garlic cloves and some chili powder.  Terrific.

This is an "Oh wow!".  We love Mexican food, and this is so very easy.  (Don't you love slow cookers?)  Skip the garlic pepper and use fresh pepper and a few whole garlic cloves.  I used 6, and will probaly use more next time, but we're a garlic family.

This is a recipe that both my daughter AND my husband loved (this is unheard of - if one likes something, the other doesn't).  My husband said it was better than the chile verde he gets in the Mexican restaurant downtown!  He did suggest, however, that next time I should add some cilantro and some jalepenos - he likes his food extrs spicy.

Let me just say, I am in LOVE with this recipe!  I don't know if it's because it's so different from what I usually cook, or just that it is sooooo good.  The only alteration I make is to season the roast with salt & pepper and brown it up really good before putting it it the crockpot.  I then sautee the onion in the pork fat before adding them to the crockpot as well....we just don't care for raw onion.  We like to serve it over plain white rice, with some warm flour tortillas on the side.  D-Lish!

I chopped the pork into cubes. I used a whole pound of great northern beans. I also used fresh garlic. This was easy enough to do but it was too bland for us. It came out much soupier than I thought it would even with all the extra beans. I would suggest not to use the chicken broth, but maybe a boullion cube. Then maybe the flavor will be more intense.  Not sure why the description says it is a brown sauce.

I joined All Recipes just so I could rate this recipe.  This is an excellant recipe.  I made it for a potluck at work.  It got rave reviews.  I will most definitely make it for my family.  I always like to try it on strangers first.  I did make one change to it.  I was not able to find the 7 oz. cans of green salsa.  I bought 2-16 oz. jars of green salsa and added both jars.  It turned out great.  I also agree with the other reviews, I might add some cloves of garlic next time.

This is excellent Chili Verde!! I put it in my crock pot the night before, then finished it in the morning, it was PERFECT for my OAMC (once a month freezer cooking) Day!! perfectly cooked.  I used a 7lb bone in picnic roast and almost doubled the recipe, but I'm not a measurer, more a tinkerer....I did follow the recipe with the same ingredients, except for I omitted the garlic pepper and used fresh crushed garlic and pepper.  Next time, I would use the green chili enchilada sauce as well as one jar of salsa.  The flavor is a little bland, and I also added salt, which helped.

Another good recipe to keep close at hand! Followed the recipe pretty close. Didn't have the small cans of green salsa so I used a large can of green enchilada sauce, little less pork (cubed), and added some fresh crushed garlic along with the garlic powder and pepper. I was using this a wet sauce for burritos and it was very runny so I thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch. Not as thick as a real sauce but thicker than the soup. Worked just fine on the burritos. This also went great with Linnie's Spanish Rice from AR. Hint don't make the rice with HOT salsa!!

I really liked this sauce. We served it with warm flour tortillas and actually, my husband has scooped it over most everything since. It's spicy but not to the point of breathing fire or sweating! I used pork picnic roasts and while it needed help "falling apart" it was sooo good. I removed the roast before adding the verde salsa and pulled it apart with two forks then added it back in and let it swim in the sauce like that for another hour. I'll need to make this over the winter! A keeper for sure! As for ease, nothing to it! So easy and quick!

This is delicious and easy!  My favorite Mexican restaurant serves pork, potato, and cheese burritos.  I've been looking for a way to make them at home.  I followed this recipe, but added diced potatoes to the crock pot for the last few hours of cooking.  I forgot to add the green salsa, but maybe it was a good thing.  It would have made my burritos too soupy.  I rolled the pork, potatoes, and sauce into a tortilla and added cheese.  They were delicious and it was even better the next day for left overs.

Nice, simple recipe. If you like spicier, you will need to add jalapenos or something else with a kick.

I wanted to try this recipe but was short on time (well, I didn't have 8-10 hours) so I prepared the meat as directed but roasted it in the oven (in a covered dish.  It took about 2 1/2 hours and was so tender and so delicious!  A wonderful combination of flavors.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is such a wonderful and easy recipe. I made a few minor changes, my children and husband raved about it. My 9 year old is begging me to make it again and again. The only changes I made were; I cut the pork roast into bite size cubes. I did not add the beans, but instead cut into bite size pieces 3 good size peeled potatoes. I put everything in the crock pot with the exception of the potatoes. I placed the potatoes in about 1.5 hours before we were ready to eat. So easy and so delicious. I highly recommend trying! We ate it as a soup/stew and dipped our tortilla's in it. Yum!

delicious.  we ate it as soup over the weekend and I'm going to use it to top cheese enchiladas this week.  I would definitely make this again, possibly on the stove next time as my crock pot was a bit too small to handle it all.  thanks for sharing your recipe!

I wanted this to be a 5-star recipe, but for us it just wasn't. We did not care for the texture of the onions OR the pork roast. After 10 hours, the onions were still sort of crisp--bleh. I'd precook those if I had it to do over. And I'd also cube the pork roast, as someone else suggested, if I had it to do over. The long strings were unappetizing looking in the green sauce. The submitter describes this as a "brown sauce" but it isn't--I assure you it's green. Tastes ok, may even taste good with some hot sauce and tortilla chips, but "pretty" it ain't. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: 4/30/10: In going back over this recipe to post the picture today I have deducted another star. We wound up throwing this out :( In addition to the problems I listed above, we also didn't care for the great Northern beans, and I'd suggest subbing a white bean you already know you love if you make this!

This was very good, but next time I will take the time to cube the pork roast, it fell apart into strings.  No one seemed to care, but I think it would look more appealing with chunks than strings.  I still gave it 5 stars because it was remarkable, and I followed the recipe to the letter.

This was so good. By far, better than any chili verde I've had in a Mexican restaurant, and I've been to Mexico a few times. This was so juicy and tender and full of flavor. I didn't have 8 hours to cook it so I browned both sides in a skillet then put it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours, then turned it to low after I shreeded the beef (I used beef roast instead of pork) and added the verde and continued to cook it for another hour or so. I added 6 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic pepper and I used 16 oz. of medium salsa verde. My guest asked if they could take some of the leftovers home with them!! It was a little too spicy for my kids to eat but every single adult, even the most picky eaters, loved it. I will make this recipe again and again. Absolute perfection!!

BLAND! After cooking 10 hours, I discover it was too bland to eat. Under stress, I had to read all the reviews to see what others did to rev this recipe up.  My mistake for not doing this before I cooked it.

I made this for Easter dinner for my aunt and uncle who are on low sodium diets and could not eat a traditional ham dinner.  I did not have time to cook it for 8 hours in the crock pot, so I put it in a large pot and cooked it in my oven at 350 for 4 hours.  I could not find canned green salsa at my local store, so I used 2 jars of salsa verde and a large can of green enchilada sauce (I left out the beans).  My uncle loves green chili, so I was a bit nervous to have him try it.  He really liked it!  It was a hit with the whole family - plus it was really easy to make.  I think this will become an Easter tradition with my family.  My mom and uncle have already requested I make it again when my other uncle comes out later this month.

Loved this... I had about 2 1/2 lbs of cooked pork roast so I cut it up and simmered in the slow cooker on high for about three hours in the chicken broth. I also added 1 chopped jalapeno pepper and some cumin to the recipe... I jar of green salsa which I added and then simmered another 30 min. I had to thicken with corn starch and water. We skipped the optional beans and ate it in burritos with Mexican rice and buttered corn! :)

Really good. I modified but kept all the basic ingredients. I used part of the left over kahlua pork roast meat from the night before. My hubby as a general rule turns his nose up and refuses to eat anything green but he tried this and thought it was really good. I added a frozen veggie packet of poblanos, black beans, corn, onions, red peppers while the chili was cooking. Then when the chili was finished and nicely thickened decided to use this as a sauce. Using a 9x13 pan we set about layering chili, crushed up lime corn chips, more pork roast meat, medium salsa verde from a jar, and a cheese blend. We layered a few times til the toppish part of the pan and then mixed part of the chili with some sour cream making a kinda suiza sauce poured it over and sprinkled with a final layer of cheese and baked it at 350 til everything was heated through and bubbly and the cheese was extra melty. I know that is a large amount of changes and as such probably shouldn't have rated but seeing as it said sauce over chimi's in the description I went ahead. We did test the chili before adding it to the other things as a sauce and liked it as is as well. Thank you for a great new recipe find!

This was superb!!  Absolutely loved this recipe.  My husband is pickey but loved this chili.  I didn't change a thing except I had used a 2 lb roast instead of 3 lb.  
Definitely will make this again!!!
Thanks for sharing....

I have made this with both chicken breasts and with pork.  Either way, it is delicious.  I did add a can (sometimes 2) of tomatoes with green chilies  (choosing the heat of these helps control the heat of the chili).  I also thicken it with a mixture of flour and chicken broth when I add the other ingredients.  Rave reviews from all who have tried it!
