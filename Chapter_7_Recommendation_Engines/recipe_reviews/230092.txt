Yummy!  Made it last night for some friends and they loved it!  Didn't use the chocolate glaze, and it made the peanut-butter layer a little crunchy on top which was delicious!  Good second-day, too.

This interesting recipe looked too yummy to not try.  I followed as directed with only one exception.. crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.  The topping did not set until the next day, and overall the dessert was much better the next. That said, it was deffinately more of a fudge than a brownie, and awfully rich.  I only gave it three stars because of the fudge vs brownie factor.  I would like to hear other people's suggestions on making it more of a brownie.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using Nestle's morsels instead of the recommended brand.  The frosting was delicious, but the brownie-peanut butter part wasn't very good at all.  The peanut butter flavor was not distinct enough, nor was the chocolate flavor, so overall the flavor was kind on blah.  I thought these looked so good and different, but was kind of disappointed, I'm sorry to say.  Would not make again.

So yummy!!! Made and shared at two events and everyone loved these. Requires a bit more than one bag of the Ghirardelli chocolate, so make sure you buy two.

I made some changes to the recipe and I would rate it, with the changes, five stars. First off, I made mini muffins out of it instead of using a baking dish. My issue with most brownie recipes is that they use so much sugar it kind of ruins the chocolatey taste. I want to taste the chocolate, not the heaps of sugar, so I cut the amount of sugar in both the brownie and peanut butter layers down a lot. I didn't have any whipping cream, so I left of the topping. I brought this to my teenaged brother-in-law's birthday gathering and everyone complimented me on them. Even my husband, who rarely likes sweets, loved them.

I ran into trouble making this recipe because the ingredient list is a little confusing.  Most of the ingredients are listed twice if they're used twice, but the sugar is not.  I wish the recipe listed 1 cup sugar twice in the ingredient list.  I accidentally used the full amount of sugar in the bottom layer instead of just half of it.  However, the brownie bites were good despite that mistake.  I liked them better after storing them covered for a couple of days, because they softened.  They were very crumbly, which made them a little hard to eat.

I made this recipe without the glaze and used milk chocolate morsels instead of the semi sweet ones.  The people I served this recipe to love it but I was not all that impressed.  The chocolate brownie part is divine but the peanut butter part needs a lot of work.  The peanut butter part was way to sweet and way to dry.  I am going to try to refine the peanut butter part.

These were a big hit for my coworkers! I did not make the frosting on top so the presentation wasn't the best but the flavor was delish.

I made these for Christmas and they turned out perfect, if you follow the directions exactly they come out looking just like the pictures. My only complaint was that they did take awhile to make. I did get a lot of compliments however, so it was worth it.

These are pretty good actually. They tasted like a peanut butter fudge more than anything. Overall a great addition to my recipe box.

I wanted to love this, but definitely did not. I made it exactly as the recipe states but it did not turn out. The peanut butter layer was very thick and not easily spreadable. So... It kinda sunk and pushed the "brownie" layer to the sides. I cooked it for 5 minutes longer than the recipe suggested because it was not done in 45 minutes. Unfortunately, even that wasn't enough. the edges (where the brownie went) was not fully cooked. I'll try it again but will be making major changes.

Did everything according to the recipe except used dark chocolate Hershey's chips instead, and they turned out perfect! Going to make again.
