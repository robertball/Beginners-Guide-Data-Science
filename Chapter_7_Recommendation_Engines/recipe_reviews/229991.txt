I may be biased as this was my recipe, but I love it. Yes, it can be a very spicy seasoning rub, but you can put as little or as much as youd like or use something different to suit your tastes as others have done.  I am so glad so many people are enjoying this recipe!

This was a great starting point for a fabulous recipe!  We used lemon instead of lime juice in the marinade, only 1 cup of white wine (per other reviews) and probably marinated it for only 6 hours, but it turned out perfectly.  We used a blackening seasoning we already had and the chicken was the hit of our dinner party.  We had lots of compliments on the aioli, though we did substitute ancho chili powder instead of chipotle due to availability.  Thank you so much for the great recipe - these fabulous chicken sandwiches will definitely be making it into our regular recipe rotation!

The chicken is very tasty.
The overall taste is interesting (unusual and good).
But 5 stars?  No.  This isn't the sort of thing you make when your mother-in-law visits so that you can secretly smirk when she takes her first bite.  This isn't as good as the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted.

It's an above-average chicken sandwich that requires a considerably above-average effort and list of ingredients to put together.  Definitely worth trying, but definitely not worth 5 stars.

Delicious chicken sliders!  Messy but yummy!  They had a great flavor although, not for the faint of heart when it comes to spice.  One cup of white wine would have been plenty for the marinade.  I only marinaded about 4 hours and it was still delicious.  I'm sure it would be even better if it marinated overnight.   The blackened seasoning was salty and spicy.  I like a medium level of spiciness and next time I would cut cayenne in half as well as the salt.  I served these on small onion rolls with arugula and sliced tomatoes.

These were excellent! I didn't change anything about the recipe as it was well written and very clear other than I used a smokey sharp cheese and mini ciabatta rolls that I brushed with olive oil and grilled a bit for some crunch. I have been battling some serious stomach issues and I didn't find these to spicy they had a good balance of flavor.  We inhaled these and we will be making them again. So yummy!

The first time I made these I thought they were delicious, but my husnamd didn't care for them. This inspired me for a great sandwich the second time around, and it cut the prep time down to practically nothing, and my husband liked them even more. I was in a crunch so I skipped the marinade and blackended seasoning, and just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and creole seasoning (you don't need much, as the mayo is already so flavorful). I replaced the onions with a slaw that added great crunch (bagged cabbage and added oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, pepper and a bit of sugar). I then topped the sandwich with some thick slices of bacon and the mayo as written int the recipe and they were amazing! The mayo is incredible...definitely the star of the show and can make anything delicious!

I thought this was a cool idea! I used chicken tenders and made mini sliders. To get the best flavor out of the onions, you need to caramelize them slowly and until they're a rich brown. The chipotle was a nice addition too. Thanks for sharing. :o)

Recipe Group Selection:  06, April 2013 ~ We had 2 selections this week, this being one of them.  My family loved these little sliders that I served on Hawaiian rolls.  I did only use 1 cup of white wine (Pinot Grigio) in the marinade, but kept the other ingredients to the amounts listed.  Everyone really enjoyed the chipotle aioli and the flavor that it added to the sandwiches.  I served these with coleslaw and baked ‘Chip Truck Fries’ from AR.  Recipe was a hit and will be a good summer sandwich that I look forward to trying on the grill.  Thanks cloud2sunshine for sharing your recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group...We really enjoyed these sandwiches, but I did make 2 changes. After reading through the reviews,  I reduced the amount of wine to 1/2 cup and I did not use the seasoning, but instead used Penzy's 'Northwoods Seasoning'. I did not want these too spicy b/c my little guy was eating these w/ us, and I was afraid that the seasoning w/ the aioli would be too much heat for him. I made these into regular sized sandwiches. The family thought this was a nice change form the usual way we have chicken sandwiches, and I will be mkaing them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe group pick 4/6/13: We enjoyed these, but for our taste, I think the wine flavor was a little too noticeable and the aioli needed more flavor. I grilled the chicken after about 8 hours in the marinade, and am glad I didn't marinate longer. We rarely have american cheese so I used sharp cheddar. With slight alterations to the marinade and aioli, we'd make these again.

I made these today! I made the recipe exactly as is and they were awesome.  I served them to a group of picky eaters  for the playoff game.  There were none left!  Next time I will use only one cup of wine and a little less smoked chipotle.  That is just for personal preference.
