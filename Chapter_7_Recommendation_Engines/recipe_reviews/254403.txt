Hey guys, The trick to this recipe turning out great is a "Pastry Brush." Instead of dipping the bread,brush both sides with a pastry brush. This makes the toast extra crunchy and never soggy. It's delicious when done this way. Also, I make a quick Strawberry sauce to go over it. The pastry brush really brings out the true flavors esp.the butter. Try it and see. ?????

This recipe was awful. It was very liquidy and it stuck to the pan with the butter. It tasted horrible, wouldn't even give it to my greatest enemy.

Since I was out of vanilla, all I did was melt a tablespoon of butter on my griddle. Also, I read about the bread being soggy by dunking it into the milk, so I toasted the bread on the lowest setting before and it worked wonderfully. My picky 11 year old said it tasted just as good.

My first two pieces of toast failed because a quick dunk quickly soaked my bread. On my second attempt I spooned the milk on and it turned out much better. Still kinda soft in the middle when I ate it but I feel like that's what makes it French toast. Topped it off with Nutella ??

First, I only used half the cinnamon called for, and it was plenty for me. I had some issues cooking this. I put my bread in quickly and did not soak it. I was able to get 2 extra slices out of the mixture.It says to cook over medium heat, but 5 minutes on medium heat is way too long; my bread was burning at 3 minutes. I turned it over and did that side about 3 minutes, and it was super soggy. For the next 2, I turned the heat down to medium low and cooked each side 4-5 minutes. Once I got the temp and cooking time down, it was much better, but it is still a bit soggy in the middle, more so than with egg. Maybe a bit of flour added in with the milk would help. I made a slice with whole wheat bread and gave to my preschooler, and she liked it a lot.

I used Almond milk instead of cows milk. It was a hit with my niece and nephews. So I will be making it again.

I didn’t have eggs this morning and wanted to make French toast. I came across this recipe and read a review that mentioned to toast the bread beforehand. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I didn’t toast it! The French toast was still very mushy BUT my 2 year old and I still very much enjoyed it. It reminded me of the inside of a cinnamon roll. It is quite hard to flip though and does stick to the pan even with a significant amount of better. I should also add I non dairy milk which may have made it mushier.

I made bread pudding. It was very soggy and it fell apart as I flipped it. I didn’t even bother to cook my last slice. If I have to use a pastry brush, put it in the directions, not as a side note.

Used wholemeal bread and worked just as well. Hard to get it to not be soggy though. :)

I found this batter very thin, and the finished slices didn’t have the texture of “normal” french toast. Then I tried adding a T of cornstarch, and I thought that helped a bit. Next I’m going to try using half yogurt/half milk.

Thank you so much!! My son is allergic to eggs too. (Stupid vaccinations) he loved french toast and even a drip of egg really messes him up.

An easy recipe for a nice breakfast. I used gluten free bread. I was fearful that it would turn out to be nothing more than soggy, fried bread. It's not. Follow the times as written and don't let the bread sit in the milk mixture too long, and you'll get a browned, custardy toast just like the egg version. I served it with oven roasted plums and toasted almond shavings. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.
