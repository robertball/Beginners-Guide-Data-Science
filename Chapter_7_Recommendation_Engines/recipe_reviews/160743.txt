I love finding new recipes using quinoa.  This one was a little spicy for me.  Next time I'll make the following modifications: 1, replace ¼ t cayenne with ¼ t cinnamon (cinnamon is the perfect companion for sweet potatoes and pecans); 2, begin preparing and cooking the vegetables first (before cooking the quinoa); 3, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil prior to adding the mushrooms, sweet potatoes and spices; 4, five minutes into cooking the vegetables add ¼ cup of water to the vegetables.  I loved this so much, I’m thinking of adding this to our Thanksgiving menu.  Thank you lep413 for a delicious recipe.

Overall a good and healthy recipe. I just thought it need a bit more flavor so I sprinkled in a little Goya Adobo seasonings. It was good but; still needed a little something. Next time I think I will use  chicken or veggie broth to cook the quinoa. I diced the sweet potato very small and added frozen peas for extra color and texture. Will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent vegetarian/vegan dish! Very flavorful. I used 1 1/2 cups of portabella mushrooms, added 1/4 water to the vegetable pan before covering, and increased the cayenne pepper just a bit, which gave this a nice kick. Some fresh spinach added into the vegatable pan in the last 5 minutes would also be great! I'll be making this again for sure.

This was the first time I've tried quinoa and it was really good.  Even my picky husband enjoyed it.  I used regular mushrooms since thats what I had on hand and I didn't use the nuts.  It was a little too spicy for me, but thats the way my husband likes it!  I will definetly make this again, maybe  next time I will try and add extra veggies and a little less cayenne pepper.

This was my first time making quinoa and I thought this was a pretty good dish.  Eating quinoa is kind of like eating brown rice.  I used a little less cayenne than called for and added just a dash of cinnamon.  It's a nice combination of sweet, savory and spicy--definitely an interesting and out of the ordinary combo.

"one onion' is a loose measure and apparently my onion was too big (and we LOVE onions at our house). Here are a few tips/things I'll try next time: TIME SAVER: Microwave your sweet potato and then add it to the pot so you don't to wait 20 mins. Worked out great. KID FRIENDLY: Subtract cayenne and mushrooms, add cinnamon and dried cranberries; use 1/2 an onion not a whole MONEY SAVER: Use Craisins instead of dried cranberries Enjoy!

I used 1 cup quinoa & 2 cups of water (seasoned with 1/2 packet of onion soup mix).  I rinsed the quinoa before toasting.  I was worried when it was done because the quinoa seemed 'goupy'.  I made this recipe for work-week lunches.  I ate this the next day at room temperature and it was a really good lunch with good flavor.

Wonderful! My first time trying quinoa and I really enjoyed this. I did add a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice. I will definitely make this again!

I still love the quinoa with corn and black beans from this site the best but this is a close second.  After reading reviews I used low sodium chicken broth to cook my quinoa, omitted the salt and added a little bit of broth to the veggies so they wouldn't stick to the pan.  I halved the cayenne pepper and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also doubled the amount of quinoa, sweet potatoes and mushrooms.  (Make sure to increase amount of broth used to cook the doubled quinoa).  After everything was done cooking I mixed the quinoa in with the veggies.  It was delicious!

Definitely a keeper! We loved it! I substituted paprika for cayenne. We were pretty hungry so I added some spicy Italian chicken sausage, although it'd be great meatless too.

Loved this! I did add a little cinnamon towards the end, and will reduce the cayenne just a tad next time I make it.  Overall this was a great dish!

Loved this. Have made Quinoa many times but this was the best combination. I had to make some adjustments based on what ingedients that I had.  - used regular mushrooms, red pepper flakes and did not have pecans, but is was all good. I did use vegetable stock instead of water and did use some of it to keep the vegetable mixture moist. I followed advice of someone else and actually did step 2 first. LOVED this. It was even better the second day.

Very easy, but a bit spicy, and though it's tasty, it needs something I can't quite put my finger on. This one's absolutely a keeper, it just needs to be toyed with a bit for my tastes.

This was so good! I used red onion as my onion of choice and I also added 2 zucchini to the mix. I roasted the veggies instead of frying them to make this even healthier. Delicious! And I even added more cayenne to mine. Thanks....always looking for new quinoa recipes since I love it so much.

Yum! I used a large sweet potato, half of a medium onion, a container of baby portabella mushrooms, garlic, 2 good handfuls of baby spinach (at the very end of cooking), half of a red pepper, a few dashes of cinnamon, a dash of chile powder and paprika, and a little maple syrup and honey. Delishhh, especially over the quinoa. Very filling and nutritious. :)

I took some shortcuts with this recipe and it turned out really good.  I browned the onion & garlic in olive oil, added about 3 t. curry, 1 t. cumin and 1/2 t. cinammon  Then I added double the amount of quinoa and water.  I let that simmer for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, I microwaved a sweet potato until it was about half cooked.  After letting it cool down, I removed the skin, cubed it and added it to the pan, continuing to simmer for about another 10 minutes.  When it was done, I added some slivered almonds (didn't have pecans on hand).  While it was still hot, I stirred in about 1/2 c of dried cranberries.  Not only was it great tasting, it was very colorful to look at.

Good!  I used 1 cup of dried mixed mushrooms instead of fresh.  After rehydrating them, I strained that broth and used it to cook the quinoa instead of water.  And I doubled the amount of quinoa just 'cause I like the stuff.  I did not add the pecans just because I didn't want them.  The mushrooms added a nice meatiness to this dish.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.  thanks!

Really tasty. I was looking for a savory way to do sweet potatoes instead of the sickening sweet traditional recipes and this fit the bill.  I would agree with many of the other reviewers that the cayenne could be halved unless you are a big fan of heat.  I caramelized the onion and added a few shakes of cinnamon and a couple of turns of fresh grated nutmeg which I think balances the heat a bit.  I also pan fried some baby salad greens in olive oil for a nice garnish.

I caramelized the onions which gave this dish a beautiful color and wonderful sweet flavor. Toasting the quinoa and nuts was also a nice touch. I thought there was plenty of cayenne pepper as written. I will definitely make this again. Thank you lep413 for sharing.

I really loved this!  I made almost exactly as directed and can't wait to try it with a few modifications (like halving the cayenne and adding some cinnamon).  It was SPICY!!  Don't skip the pecans, and TOAST them in a little butter, the toasted pecans really add a lot to the dish.  I was truly surprised at how much I liked this dish.

Great combination of flavors and use of quinoa but we felt it was lacking something...wanted to have a sauce or something like that over it.  Not sure I would make again without coming up with what to add.

I added extra mushrooms, cut the cayenne in half and added some cinnamon.  I thought it was just ok, but my fiance declared it the worst thing I've ever cooked. I ate my portion and then leftovers for lunch two days, but I won't be making it again.  I think it must just be a matter of personal taste preference with the reviews as mixed as they are.

This dish was fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was added some diced apple.  I served it at a dinner party with grilled pork tenderloin, spinach side salad and rolls.  Everyone LOVED this dish - there were no leftovers, to my husband's disappointment!

Instead of cayenne I added canned chipotle peppers in adobe sauce.  These peppers are VERY spicy, use sparingly.  I halved the original recipe portion and only used one small pepper, discarded seeds and chopped very fine.  It added the perfect smokey kick to this recipe.   I have recently incorporated quinoa into my diet and this is a great recipe for the fall, very earthy with the mushrooms and  toasted pecans.  And I think any winter squash would be great in this recipe.

This was a cheap, healthy recipe. Next time I will double the quinoa and add another flavorful vegetable like corn or green pepper.

this was very good, and easy to make. i'd never cooked/tasted quinoa before, and was pleased; it did however take more like 12-13 minutes for my quinoa to cook instead of 20. i added extra cayenne for more heat, but that's simply personal taste; thanks for this recipe!

Very  good.  Served it as a main course.  Cooked the potato in the microwave, then peeled an diced it.  Added 1 TBS curry, 1 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  added dried cranberries a few minutes before it was done. Used just a pinch of cayenne pepper. Husband, who likes meat for dinner, liked it so much, he had second helpings.

Really, really good. I added peas, a little cinnamon and a heaping teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. It turned out great! I'll definitely make again.

This is an extremely tasty dish. After making the quinoa and the sweet potato mixture we mix it all together. The cayenne brings in the perfect amount of heat and you don't even need salt if you want a low sodium side dish. We use all organic ingredients adding to the healthiness the dish has already. This has become quite a common dish at our house.

I'm confused by the first instruction. Do you just cook dry quinoa with no oil for five minutes? Mine just burnt and made my whole house smell like burnt popcorn.

This was my second attempt with Quinoa. I love sweet potatoes so I was really excited about the dish! I didn't really measure any of the veggies and I added curry seasoning in addition to the cayenne (I love curry and sweet potatoes together). I thought it was pretty good! I'll definitely make again.

I did enjoy this recipe, next time I will use low sodium chicken broth instead of water. And to make a meal out of it add chopped up chicken breast. I also added garlic and onion.

Very delicious and cooked quickly. I liked toasting the quinoa, but I found the broth I added at another commenter's suggestion competed with the veggies. Next time I'll stick with the recipe as written.

I used amaranth instead of the quinoa and button mushrooms instead of the crimini ones.  Although I like the grain by itself and the sweet potato-mushroom combination, the two didn't really go together. I think the flavors were competing for attention in my mouth!

I followed the suggestion of others to replace at least some of the cayenne pepper with cinnamon (I did half and half each) and it was delicious.  I think if I had put in all of the Cayenne pepper it would of been too spicy for my taste, but if you like it that way go for it.

Easy to make and tasted good. I agree with other reviewers, it needs more flavor. No ideas on what to add though. I served steamed green beans as a side and it was good.

Sorry, this just didn't hit the spot with us.  I went back after dinner to look at the recipe again to see if I forgot something.  Nope...I only used a sprinkle of cayenne and my husband said that was more than enough.  I added cinnamon as another reviewer suggested, and that helped a bit.  It sounded so promising for our plant based diet, but the flavor just wasn't there.  Are crimini mushrooms different than the common white mushrooms that I used?  Wish I could think of some interesting herb or spice to perk it up, aside from pepper, as I doubled the recipe and have lots of leftovers.

This is a tasty dish, but I agree with other reviewers who said it needs a little something extra.  We added a dash of ground coriander but still felt like something was missing.  The toasted pecans are a must!

I'm not sure what I think of this one.  Admitedly, I subbed the cayenne with cinnamon to make it more kid friendly but it seemed like it was a bit blah.  I wasn't shy with the onion or garlic so I expected it to have more flavor.  But, I still like the concept and think it has potential.

Love this recipe!! I cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock instead of water which added a ton of flavor. I also added some cumin. Next time I would probably add more quinoa though.

Yummy comfort food!!  I made it according to the recipe, but next time I will add chicken broth instead of water as the vegetables are cooking. I also sprinkled it with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

This was my first experiment with quinoa, but I felt pretty confident that it would be good based on the positive reviews. I was very disappointed in this recipe. First of all, the mushrooms/onions/garlic were almost cooked to mush by the time the sweet potatoes were done. Second, the sweet potatoes where no where near done when the quinoa was done as the recipe states. In the end, it was bland and boring. I will keep looking for a good quinoa recipe.

This was pretty good flavor wise. The only thing I didn't like was how smushy the potatoes got. I put the left overs in the broiler for a while untill the potatoes crisped up a bit. It was much better after that.

There were a few reviews that said to add cinnamon and I did, it was good!  I got a little crazy and added some brown sugar.  Wow, that added the complexity I was looking for.  It was sweet, spicy, and perfectly seasoned.

I really enjoyed this!  I tripled it for a main dish for our family of two adults and three small boys and I think I should have quadrupled it.  I greatly reduced the cayenne for the children's sake.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very good. I used yams, not sweet potatoes, which is the way it's intended I think. This recipe was also great a la carte without the quinoa. I paired this with a portabello and brushetta recipe I found on this site; they married perfectly. I would recommend this to a friend.

Used red quinoa and skipped the pecans.  It was ok.  The cayenne pepper gave it a bit of a kick, but other than that it was pretty bland.

Seems this is either a love it or hate it recipe and I'm going to have to agree with others....it's missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it.  As written this MIGHT serve 3 people, definately not 4.  It was nice to have a new Quinoa recipe to try but I don't think I'll fixing this again anytime soon.  P.S.  We are vegetarians who LOVE all the ingredients in this recipe...just not in this combination.

This tasted like what it is - quinoa, sweet potato and mushrooms. It was not a cohesive dish and lacked flavor. The textures did not go together well. Perhaps baking the sweet potato separately would be good?

Yum! This was excellent! Only change was to cook the quinoa in homemade vegetable stock, and I probably doubled the mushrooms (had to use some up).  Oh, and I omitted the pecans.  Really tasty!  I would probably halve the cayenne next time - it was just a bit overpowering, but I still loved this dish.  Thanks!

Excellent and unique dish!  I did make a few additions.  I cooked the quinoa in beef broth (serving with steaks), added just a little bit of chipotle chili powder for some smokiness, added a dash of cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers, splashed some balsamic vinegar in with the veggies as they were cooking (it didn't stand out in the finished product, but I do think it complemented the sweetness of the potatoes), and tossed in some fresh spinach at the very end.  I love finding such a healthy side dish with so much flavor!

I wasn't sure what I could make myself for dinner with a few leftover mushrooms on the brink of going bad and a small sweet potato, so I decided to search allrecipes, and I'm so glad I did because it brought me to this great recipe!    The only things I changed were omitting the salt and replacing the cooking water with broth instead, and dumping the cooked quinoa into the vegetable mixture once everything was cooked (rather than using it as a bed for the veggies). It was very good. Possibly a little spicy for some people's tastes, but I loved it. If you find it too hot, try serving it with a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream (it will help cut the heat).    Thanks for a lovely dinner idea!

Very good!  Omitted cayenne pepper and used shallots - loved the flavor.  Even better as a cold dish.  The next day I put this in a wrap with mango chutney and grilled chicken and found my new lunch for the week!

Pretty good but a bit bland. I added some cinnamon like mentioned and sauteed chicken. There was something missing. Next time I am going to add a chunked up apple and maybe raisins.

I like all the ingredients in this, but it needs a sauce so something to make it interesting.  The cayenne adds heat, but other than that there isn't anything that gives this a lot of flavor.

My family LOVED this!  So, so good!  I used pre-sliced criminis...an 8 oz package, and increased the quinoa to one cup with 2 cups water.  I made the sweet potato/mushroom mixture in advance (be careful, it will turn to mush if you cook it for 20 mins).  This may sound odd, but I added a pinch of apple pie spice to the sweet potato mixture...just added a depth and warmth to the overall flavor.  Also, I was always taught to rinse your quinoa well before using to remove the resin, which can make it bitter.  This will be a regular in my house...thanks!

I really liked this recipe, however, I cut the amount of cayenne pepper down to 1/8 teaspoon, and it was still a little too spicy for me (and I normally love spicy food). Next time, I will just use a tiny pinch of the cayenne.  I didn't have fresh garlic in the house, so I used a little garlic powder instead, and it worked just as well.

Loved it!!  I made it exactly as the recipe directions.  However, I added a little bit too much cayenne and was a little too spicy for me.  Something different from the everyday menu.  Thanks will make it again soon.

Love this dish!  I left out the mushrooms and cayenne and added 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of chopped dried cranberries - and served it underneath the Fragrant Chicken Curry recipe from this site.  Yummy and so healthy!  Be sure to rinse your quinoa in cold water before cooking - it takes the bitter flavor away.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out fantastic.  The sweet potatoes and pecans give this dish plenty of flavor.  I did have to add water to keep the vegetables from burning.

I love this recipe.  My kids do not go for spicy things so I used cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and agave nectar instead of cayenne.  It went welll with the sweet potato...next time Ill even season the quenoa too.

Absolutely delicious. I have a husband that needs to have flavorful food, and he really enjoyed this one. We ate it for breakfast! I was able to get it ready faster than the time specified (took me about 45 minutes). If using as a main dish, have a protein on the side.

My husband would definitely NOT eat this, and I couldn't blame him.  I found it edible with some sharp cheddar on top, but not good.  Funny, though, our 2 year old daughter loved it, so I guess I've gotta give it at least two stars for that.

I left out the mushrooms because I didn’t have any on hand, and both my quinoa and sweet potatoes were ready in about 10 minutes, instead of 20.  It was delicious and I’ll be adding this to our regular rotation.

I like to add peas - mainly for color.  This is good.  It does make a lot though.  I served it as a side dish with some ribs tonight and there was quite a bit left over.  My husband told me not to throw it away as it would be delicious if I added some diced chicken and served it as a meal.  That's my plan for later in the week.

I made the recipe as written except I always add a vegetable cube to my quinoa when cooking for any recipe.  I started with a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper , and decided not to add anymore.  I did add a pinch of cinnamon.  I didn't like the mushrooms in this even though I like mushrooms.  Over all I like the recipe, but like others think it could use something.  Maybe golden raisins?

Too spicy and the mushroom and quinoa flavor just melded together. Easy enough to cook though. Make more quinoa than the recipe calls for.

Made this for lunch today.  I substituted chicken broth for the water to cook the quinoa and left out the cayenne (personal preference). I will try it with cinnamon next time and I think I will also try it with some thyme.
My oldest told me I could fix it again soon and there were no leftovers.

I used 1/3 onion, double garlic, large sweet potato,  8oz package of baby portabella. (Could even use more if you love mushrooms.) I steamed the vegetables in broth and used that as a little bit of sauce. Topped with Parmesan cheese.

Substituted chicken stock for the water which gives the quinoa a great taste on its own.  Added a 1/2 diced red pepper to the mushroom/sweet potato mixture.....fabulous veggie main or size.  Two thumbs up

Very good and easy to make. Will keep this recipe. I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker. And I used a bit of vegetable broth so the veggies wouldn't stick to the pan. Next time I make this I might cook the potatoes first in a microwave or separately, so it doesn't take so long to cook.

I love this recipe! I omitted the pecans, used veggie stock in lieu of water, used a 1/2 cup of quinoa (and will add even more next time), used avocado oil and almond oil in lieu of olive oil (to boost monounsaturated fat content even higher), and used oil when "toasting" the quinoa to make it even fluffier. The heat is subtle and slow growing, it did not overpower the other flavors at all. SO GOOD!

This was super yummy! I loved it!  I used barley instead of quinoa only because that's what was in my pantry and used more  chili to suit my taste and it was delish! I will certainly make this again!

This recipe was awesome! I probably wouldn't have ever tried quinoa except that this was on the allrecipes homepage. I paired it with my homemade version of samosas and some spaghetti squash and my husband declared it the best meal he's ever eaten. That's a high compliment since he's an all-american meat-eater and I'm a vegetarian. One caveat, we both like spicy food so I increased the cayenne.

This was my second attempt at quinoa and had a MUCH better outcome.  I added only a dash of cyanne due to the kids.  My kids picky kid, picked out the mushrooms and onion, but 3 year-old ate it up.  My husband (who doesn't care for mushrooms) said that it was good.  Would make again.  Also, the pecans were a perfect addition...they are a must

Used a cup of quinoa and 2 cups of chicken broth and then followed the recipe as is.  20 minutest o cook the sweet potatoes was too long--about 12 minutes should do it.  Was really fantastic, great flavor.

Most delicious!  Made it with walnuts instead of pecans, portabello instead of crimini,  and a bit more sweet potato than called for. Turned out Excellent!!! Even my mom loved it and she doesn't like sweet potato!

I was really shocked at how good this recipe was! It's not a combination I would have expected to be this savory and filling. We served it as a main dish with a side salad and it made a great dinner. I will steam a little more quinoa next time to stretch it out a little more.

To my surprise this was very good.  We have been trying out new recipes and this one definately goes into my recipe box.  The only addtion I made to the dish was adding a small amount of agave for a sweeter taste.

Really good, healthy side dish.  I cooked the quinoa in low sodium chicken broth and saved time by buying a bag of raw sweet potato sticks from Trader Joes that could be quickly diced.  I also had a really big shallot and used that instead of the onion, but either one would work just fine. Decided to make it again a couple of weeks later, but oh no! forgot the sweet potatoes.  Easy fix with a big handful of shredded carrots we use for salads.  Blended perfectly with the onions and mushrooms, and that little zing of cayenne was perfect.

I couldn't find quinoa at either of the two grocery stores I tried (I think I need to go to a Whole Foods) so I substituted 1/2 c. of cooked brown rice in the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I used mini bella mushrooms in place of crimini (couldn't find them either).  My boyfriend and I really loved this dish with the alterations, but I will be making it again with the correct ingredients at some point!

Made this for lunch today.   Used veggie stock instead of evoo and water.  Came out perfect.  Did add some spinach at the end to wilt.  Certainly made for a full meal deal.  My husband loved it and thought it very tasty and filling.

This is a very healthy recipe, but overral this dish was ok. I thought the sweet potato was soggy and it didn't have much flavor. I would add different veggies next time.

Really good stuff! Turned out better than I expected - even my partner liked it! And he's rarely into things that's out of the norm (i.e. other than pasta, roast meat, veges, beans, chips etc). I added peas to give it some colour. Also, added a couple of sticks of celery which seems to really add that extra something that seems missing otherwise...also tossed in a couple of small fresh chillies in for an extra spice zing.

Simply delicious!   No nuts for me with my allergies, but a wonderful way to dress up the quinoa.

I was disapointd with this recipe. I prefer a lot of flavor. This recipe seemed to be missing something.

We all really liked this, including my 6 and 2 year olds! I did use cumin instead of cayenne, but only because my boys are still "new" to spice, but this is a great recipe that invites experimentation, thank you!

I have been meaning to try quinoa for a long time, and am so happy that I tried it with this recipe.  Highly recommended!
