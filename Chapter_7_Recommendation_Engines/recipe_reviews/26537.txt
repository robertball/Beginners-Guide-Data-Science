Sorry to report it was just too much like liquified peanut flavor.  Not complex enough perhaps.  Maybe good with fruit but I didn't like it much with greens.

Very yummy and easy! I left out the whipped cream because I had none, but this was perfect with apples as a compliment to a pasta salad. 5 stars!!

This was a fair (quick) recipe....I used the dressing over a bed of greens with iceberg lettuce and romaine with minced red peppers, cucumbers, sweet onion, scallions and celery. The salad also included grilled jumbo shrimp marinated in lime and lemon juice....  The recipe needs the following additions: 1. less cream cheese 2. salt/pepper/crushed red pepper 3. a teaspoon of ground ginger...or minced fresh ginger....or ground wasabie  4. toasted fresh peanuts for more texture.. 4.cilantro would be a nice touch

Tried this recipe on a whim just because I had all the ingredients on hand. LOVED IT! Yeah, and I can see it being equally good on a fruit salad as a greens salad.
