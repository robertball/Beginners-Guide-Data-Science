Excellent recipe and easy to make. Messy, though, so be prepared.  My only suggestion would be to dredge, dunk and coat all the shrimp first then let sit on a wire rack or parchment paper while the oil comes up to temp. This does two things. 1) it allows the coating to become set. 2) it greatly facilitates the deep frying process so the oil is not sitting and breaking down while you prepare subsequent batches.

Great fried shrimp. The key is the panko. It's texture allows it to fry up golden brown and crunchy before the protein it's stuck to (in this case, shrimp) gets overcooked. Some tips: You could probably use 1/2 the flour mixture. Add the seasoned shrimp to the flour, stir to coat, and then gently shake them out over the garbage can in a wire strainer to remove the excess flour. Make sure the shrimp are very dry when you do this or they'll be gummy. Have a big plate or baking sheet covered with wax paper ready to place the shrimp on after you've coated them all with the egg wash and panko. Then, it's off to the fryer. Makes for an easier cleanup, and you don't have to juggle making them/frying them simultaneously. Panko is very coarse so you may have to help it stick by pressing it on.

Wow! These are by far the best tasting fried shrimp I've ever eaten. My husband is a bit of a food snob and he devoured every last one. 
This is a recipe that I will make again and again. It's fast, super easy and the finished product is very impressive.
I followed the recipe with the exception on the flour and panko, which I reduced by half. Turned out to be the right amount with little waste. Perfect!

Excellent, but I think Old Bay is missing from the ingredients.  I dusted the shrimp with Old Bay, then flour, egg, panko. Just the touch that was needed to take these over the top!

Fantastic but there are few tips to ensure resturant quality.  First make sure you season shrimp  before dredging in flour.  Do not try and skip this step by mixing in flour it makes a big difference in shrimp taste.  Shake excess flour off and let sit a few to ensure it is dry.  Then dip in egg and panko again let it sit 5 to 10 min before frying this help secure the batter to the shrimp and it fry's so nice.  You can do the same to pork, beef or chicken make sure you put the meat between a sheet of wax paper or plastic bag and flatten with mallet.

I wound up making these because DH wasn't able to get his "shrimp & fries basket" at the ice cream stand we took the kids to. I volunteered to make him shrimp and fries at home. I recently bought Panko bread crumbs at Whole Foods just because. Well, they use them all the time on Food Network, so they must be good, right? Definitely! This recipe is definitely going into the Keepers File. Hubby declared these the best shrimp he's ever had. Too bad the fries weren't on par with the shrimp. Thanks for a winner!

Followed recipe exactly.  Really, really good!  My husband will only eat seafood from nice seafood restaurants.  He was shocked I could make the same quality, delicious fried shrimp at home.  Will definitely make again!

Just good for us. My 1 lb. of medium shrimp was 20 shrimp. Instead of eggs I used beer to dip. Definitely 1/2 cup flour if not less; same with the panko crumbs. It's easier to add more if necessary. Just make sure you have the ingredient bowls by the stove because they fry very quickly.

This recipe was great and easy. I prepared this recipe while my tilapia recipe baked for 24 minutes. When the tilapia came out of the oven, I added the shrimp to a plate and dinner was served...EFFORTLESSLY in under an hour. In the future, I will only use half of the flour because I threw more than half of it away in the end.

Although messy, these turned out great! However, next time I need to use more egg and had to add more Panko bread crumbs because I had almost twice as many shrimp. I don't think I will be buying shrimp from anywhere when I can make them better at home! I did add seasoned salt & onion powder to the shrimp and paprika & cayenne pepper to the flour.

I wasn't a member of AllRecipes, but I had to join just to rate this recipe!  Best Shrimp I've ever tasted.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, except I used the Ziplock Bag method to bread in the flour and Panko...not so messy.  Also I let them sit in the Panko while I heated the oil...helped the breading stick.  Wonderful Recipe!  Restaurant Shrimp will never be good enough again.  No thanks, I'll use this recipe and make my own!  Thanks for sharing.

Very good, very easy!  I pan fried mine in about 1/4" nicely heated peanut oil, canola would have been more healthy.  I added more paprika to the flour, just because the teaspoon got lost in the cup of flour.  I added another teaspoon.  They tasted great.  I love the Panko Crust.  Substituting coconut for Panko at that step would make them Coconut Shrimp.... YUMMY!!! and EASY too!!

I had never attempted frying shrimp and I am so glad I gave this one a shot. I wouldn't change a thing. I dropped them in my Fry Daddy and they came out perfect!

This shrimp was delicious.  I took some other reviewer's suggestion and added Old Bay to season the shrimp. For a shortcut I used cooked shrimp breaded it and cooked it in a cast iron skillet.  Simple to make and a fast easy meal.

Amazing recipe. I tried frying my shrimp just like this after buying panko for a Chicken Parmesan recipe I found on here. Turns out great every time - my 4 y/o and picky husband loved them as well! (As another person stated, its best to let these sit at least 4-5 minutes while letting your oil heat up. The breading adheres better this way.)

Paired these with the Garlic cheese biscuit recipe from this site and my family thought I'd picked up dinner from the seafood chain they love so much. First time I ever attempted fried shrimp to boot! Will made room in the recipe box for this one. YUMMY

Awesome. We've never fried shrimp before, and this recipe turned out great. A couple notes:

1. We used pretty large shrimp. They were too big to cook thoroughly inside without the bread crumbs burning. We easily butterflied them and forged ahead. When we make it again, we'll probably use smaller shrimp to avoid the butterfly step.

2. We doubled the recipe. We only needed 1 cup of flour mix. But we ended up needing an extra egg (5 total).

3. This isn't hard. You can do it! The toughest part is making sure the shrimp are done but not overcooked. Pull them out after a couple minutes and cut into one. You'll get the hang of it.

Delicious. I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder and then dreged in flour with paprika and cayenne.  I added shredded coconut to the panko.  These took no time to fry up in my electric skillet, maybe 2 minutes total, as soon as I saw the tails turn pink I took them out.  Served with a dipping sauce of pinapple preserves, spicy mustard, honey and horseradish.  My boyfriend said they were better than the ones we had at McCormick and Schmict's last week.  Fantastic!

Thank you so much for this idea!  I have had Panko in my pantry for awhile and had no idea what to use it with.  The Panko made the shrimp crunchy and crusty - perfect!  I had actually marinated the shrimp early in the day intending to grill it, but when I saw your recipe, I knew my boys would eat it better!  My DS3 at 4 pieces and DS1 ate 2!  Thanks again - I'll definitely be using your idea again!

These shrimp were excellent!! I only made enough for myself so i made about 8 shrimp, and basically eyeballed the recipe down to proportion. I did not have a deep fryer, and there fore used a small deep pan about 1/3 full of oil. My shrimp came out tasty, but darker than normal because my oil was too hot. I also used precooked and frozen shrimp, therefore I only fried them for about a minute. Paired with salad and no dipping sauce needed!

These are really great. However, if you dont have a deep-fryer or something with a steady temp gage you might have to work the controls of your stove...like, I did. I followed this recipe to a T and the shrimp were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.

WOW!!!  I made this shrimp tonight and it is the best fried shrimp I have ever had.  I have used panko before but was afraid to try it with shrimp.  I will be making it again and again.  I did sift the flour off the shrimp before I put it in the egg wash and it turned out great.   The prep is a little messy but well worth it.

I make chicken and pork this exacty way ALL the time because Panko is the only breading that provides a good crunch!  I never even thought to use shrimp.  This recipe is simple and delicious!

I used jumbo butterflied shrimp and did add a little onion powder, because lately I seem to add it to everything, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very crispy, mildly seasoned shrimp that were delicious with homemade cocktail sauce.  I'd like to use similar breading for coconut shrimp with a sweet pineapple sauce.

This makes a really good breading for fried shrimp. I used it to bread my jalapeno stuffed shrimp for a party and got rave reviews! The only thing I really changed was I used 1/2 plain panko breadcrumbs and 1/2 Italian style breadcrumbs and didn't add the salt. The other thing to watch for is the shrimp will be done after about 2-3 minutes so be careful not to over cook them.

I made this last night for the first time.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was.  My husband, who tends to be super picky, liked how crunchy the shrimp turned out and he said they had good flavor and didn't need cocktail sauce.  Considering he puts hot sauce on everything, that's a huge compliment.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to use larger shrimp.  My local store only had the 35-40 shrimp pp on the shelf.  I'd probably try to buy the 15-20 pp next time to see if that made a difference.  Will make this again and again!

Hands down the best I've ever had! I served these for 12 people at our Christmas dinner and everyone loved them and said they were the best they've ever eaten as well. I omitted the garlic powder....they don't need them and I added some buttermilk to my eggs...........fabulous!

Delicious! I had 24 good size shrimp that I seasoned with hawaiian salt, black pepper and little garlic powder. I also added some into the flour mixture. I made sure to use a lot more panko crumbs so there was enough coating on all the shrimp. The shrimp is cooked perfectly! The panko breading is a delicious lightly seasoned crunchy breading! I am pleased and satisfied that this main dish turned out so well. I dipped this in, "Japanese Shrimp Sauce I," and served this with, "Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans,""Cucumber Sunomono," and "Miso Soup," all from this website. The shrimp, side dishes and soup are all terrific!

FANTASTIC! This is an excellent recipe to get restaurant quality fried shrimp at home.  I added a tablespoon of Lawry's Season Salt to the flour along with the paprika.  I also doubled the recipe.  Here are a few tips:  (1) Make sure your shrimp is rinsed and completely dry before seasoning with the garlic, salt, and pepper.  This will prevent the shrimp from becoming gummy in the flour.  (2)  If you use shrimp with 'tails on' then the tails make an excellent little "handle" for dredging in flour, dipping in egg, then Panko & helps to keep your hands less messy.  (3)  Go ahead and prepare all of the shrimp and lay them out on a large plate to sit for a few minutes before frying.  This ensures the coating has time to set up and will not come off in the oil.  Use this time to clean up your counter so that when your shrimp come out of the fryer you can serve immediately with no mess to clean up.  (4)  Fry only a few at a time so as not to lower the temperature of the oil.  Your cook time will be about 3-5 minutes per batch, depending on the size of your fryer.  I doubled the recipe and it only took me about 5 batches to fry them all.

These were really great.  I didn't have panko but used cornmeal instead for second dip and added some cayenne to the flour.  I will use Panko next time but this was a great process to follow!  They were cooked to perfection in four minutes.  Better than any I've had in a restaurant and I live on the Gulf Coast!

Yummy!! I used the Zatarain's fish fry mix with the Panko. I found it easier to dip the shrimp in the egg, then the Panko, and lastly the fish fry flour mix. It made for a well seasoned crunch!!

I forgot all the seasonings -- and they were still yummy! Just used whole wheat flour,  2 eggs and panko. DELICIOUS. The coating is substantive  but still light, crunchy and tender. I had a really tasty cocktail sauce so I didn't even notice that I forgot all the seasoning!!

Amazing bread for shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, etc. Followed suggestions of adding Old Bay Seasonings to the flour. We also added salt and pepper to the panko to give it even more flavor. Fried up nicely!

My kids 1, 4 & 5 yr old and even my picky husband loved it and I'm not good at frying! Thank you so much for the recipe! I cut the flour to 1/2 but still a lot left over. I might do 1/3 or so next time. I was generous with garlic powder, used olive oil and made my own crumbs. The size of the egg was not specified and I used 2 large eggs but end up tossing most of it. 1 egg is plenty if it is a large one. Thanks again!

Cooked this last night & it turned out looking like the ones from Red Lobster, in other words. AWESOME! The only suggestion I can think of is to add a bit more seansoning to add more flavor, I cooked this with Chicken Chow Mein so the "lack" of flavor didn't bother me. Overall & easy & awesome recipe! -C

These were very good. I rated a four only because I felt something was missing, and it was Old Bay. I dusted the shrimp with it before flouring and breading them. Served with cocktail sauce, but would probably be better with a chili-type dipping sauce. Will definitely be making again.

So delicious!  We made a couple of adjustments as we are watching our waistlines.  Substituted Egg Beaters for the eggs and pan-fried in extra virgin olive oil rather than deep frying in vegetable oil.  This cut down on the fat quite a bit, but I doubt we sacrificed any flavor!  We love panko shrimp nights.  :-)

Very nice basic fried shrimp recipe. I deep fried mine at 350 degrees and they browned in a couple of minutes. I used large shrimp. I served these with red current jelly. I put it in a microwaveable bowl and heated on low until liquid. It was thick enough to use as a dipping sauce

Nothing about this recipe needs even a little bit of tweaking!  I served with Japanese-Style Cabbage Salad from this site and Japanese white rice for a restaurant-quality Japanese meal that I will definitely be making again!  Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

I removed the tails so these would be easier to eat, and I added Tony Cacheres to the flour mix, and a little milk to the eggs, but those weren't major changes.  I have always used flour/corn meal to fry shrimp but not anymore!  The panko makes such a crispy, tasty crunch on the outside.  This will be my go-to for frying shrimp from now on!

OMG! So good!I just made them today. I'm supposed to be on a strict diet but when I made these,I didn't care. I lost track of how much I ate as opposed to how much I should have eaten.I did make 2 pounds of shrimp but kept the flour measurement and added an extra tsp of paprika and an extra cup of panko.I dipped them in a sweet chili sauce and they were so perfect together! I'm looking forward the the leftovers!Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Sigh... Panko shrimp are my Nemisis.  This recipe was no exception. :(   I fixed them for my guy when we first got together and he loves them.  But the breading  fell off so bad, I have been searching for a way for it to stick.  When I found this recipe today I thought the flour and then comments to let them set would do it.  These came out awful tonight.  The breading was way too heavy and the shrimp weren't done.  I rated it a 4 because I am sure it was me and not the recipe.  I might try again but watch the flour and my oil heat.  Thanks for the recipe and maybe one day I will get these darn things right. :).

This recipe was easy to make and came out wonderful. I served this to the guests i had over during house warming and all devoured it. They loved it. I was surprised that i didn't have to go out to buy the ingredients that was needed in this recipe besides the shrimp.

Wow, what a great crunch! My family loved these and my 6yr old told me that these were the best thing he'd ever eaten. I think I'll add a little more seasoning next time for personal taste, maybe a little Old Bay. Served with sweet potato fries and broccoli salad - so good!

This was outstanding. I am not a fan of fried food, but hubby was wanting fried shrimp. Did not taste the least bit greasy. I did add Old Bay to the seasoning mix.  We dipped them in a sauce of Thai chili sauce, orange marmalade, and thinned with  rice vinegar. This is a keeper!

really crunchy yummy shrimp. I coated them all and then fried all at once, my only suggestion would be to season the shrimp well before coating to add a little flavor.

Tasted great but what a mess!  I was up to my elbows in flour, egg, and panko.  Next time I'll use jumbo shrimp so I can make fewer shrimp per serving.   Great recipe if you like playing with your food.

These were delicious.  If you had set a plate of these shrimp in front of me I would have thought they came from a restaurant.  I brought some to work and reheated them, they were not as crispy, but still got rave reviews.

my boyfriend seriously said "this is the best fried shrimp I've ever had". Hint-this is a bit messy. Use left hand to dip it in the eggs n flour. Drop it in the panko and use right hand to cover. This way you can keep one hand wet n one hand dry.

My family loved these shrimp.  The only thing I changed is I added a little more spice.  I also dipped the shrimp in the flour first, then egg and panko crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm always looking for the perfect deep fried shrimp recipe, and this is close!  I threw in some scallops, too, which also came out beautifully.  At the end and after draining on paper towels, I squeezed half a lime's worth of juice over everything.  Wonderful!  Next time I do this, I will decrease the flour, as I only needed half that amount.  Maybe that was just me.

I was very pleased at how easy and good this recipe was! I just dusted the shrimp in Old Bay, salt, pepper, and garlic powder then did the rest by recipe. It was awesome! I'm going to show my girlfriends the recipe.

Yum yum! I used cayenne pepper instead of paprika in the flour mixture, but left everything else the same. This was so delicious with sour cream biscuits as a quick snack for lunch. But I couldn't stop eating the shrimp with dipping sauce all on it's own! Thanks for sharing!

This is easily the best fried shrimp I've had.  Another great thing is I can remember the recipe and prepare it anywhere, it is that simple but great.  Our favorite Thai restaurant in Cape Canaveral serves a Volcano Shrimp dinner.  This is it!  Just add white rice and steamed cabbage, brocolli and carrots.  They also have Volcano Chicken and this breading could be used on chicken with the sweet chile sauce and be wonderful too.  I did not change a thing.

OMG -- if I could give this 10 stars I would. This is the first recipe where the bf said, "did you write that down?" I have tried numerous recipes off of this site. I read the reviews, I make changes, and then I put them in front of the bf for his review. This recipe could not be ANY more perfect. We definitely used panko bread crumbs (I think this is the key) and the only thing that I did that was "extra" was sprinkle the shrimp with Old Bay as well as the other spices. My hats off to this WONDERFUL recipe. We made it 2 times in 1 week! Not healthy, but wonderful!

Amazing. Simply amazing. I cannot give enough rave to this recipe. I'm a celiac, and it was EASY to make gf. I followed the instructions as written here and used gf ingredients. The shrimp turned out so crispy and perfect. It was amazing. I really can't even say anything other than amazing. It had a great blend of flavor, crunchy, and shrimp is my favorite seafood.

I didn't use the spices and this was excellent. I used pre cooked jumbo shrimp and ate them with tarter sauce. Very Good.

I have just finished eating this wonderful shrimp.  Unlike other recipes, it does not get soggy sitting on the plate.  I placed my panko-coated shrimp on a wire rack for 15 minutes before cooking, so the coating would adhere.  It worked beautifully.  Don't alter the recipe at all.

I made this for my husband for his Birthday, he said it was the best fried shrimp he'd ever had! It was delicious and had a nice crunch to it! No changes needed. For best results fry in batches and keep warm in an oven or toaster oven until frying is complete. 
Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe for fried shrimp, they come out extra crunchy outside.  I prepared all the shrimp first and laid them out on a rack over a sheet pan, then I could easily drop them into the fryer without having to wait in between batches.  We will definitely make this again!

Perfect shrimp!  I mixed the flour with one of Paul Prudhomme's breading mixes, and added some cayenne pepper to the shrimp seasonings.  Tender and crispy-again, perfect!  Thanks for the recipe

Da Bomb!  This is the best fried shrimp recipe on the internet...hands down.  Not only do they fry up picture perfect, they also have an award winning taste!  You might be saying, "I don't have any panko crumbs in my pantry!" My response to you is to go and get some from the grocery store because it is DEFINITELY worth the trip!  I added Old Bay to mine and they came out simply scrumptious.  This recipe is a keeper. Thanks ait0shi for sharing this winner of a recipe!

Easy and delicious!  Just like the fried shrimp at the local teriyaki restaurant.  I've only cooked shrimp a couple times before and only deep fried a couple times before, and even mine came out perfect!  I have found a new love for panko crumbs, which I had never used before.  Next time I'll only measure out half the flour mixture as I had lots leftover.  The panko measurement was just right.  I also ended up needing an extra egg to make the full pound.

We LOVE this. I add a little cayenne pepper to taste and my family goes crazy over this. I'm not typically the cook in our house but if fried shrimp is on the menu they look to me to make it now. :)

I kinda messed up and added old bay to my shrimp before I found this recipe so I omitted the spices on the shrimp and instead added them to the panko crumbs. Hands down the BEST fried shrimp I have ever made!!

I made this for dinner last night exactly as the recipe is written. It was good. It needs a very exciting dipping sauce to make it a great meal. I most likely won't make it again.

I am in love with this recipe! I just made this today and I was surprised how well it cooked in my deep fryer! I didn't have any garlic so I used ginger and it tasted awesome! I followed up with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. Anyone looking for a quick and easy fried shrimp recipe you are in the right place!

Absolutely fabulous! I used smoked paprika cuz that's what I had on hand. The Panko makes all the difference so if you don't have any, don't bother to make these shrimp.

Easy, delicious, super crunchy.  Made a second batch to use in tacos.  Made a spicy dipping sauce with 2 parts mango jam, 2 parts orange marmalade, 1 part siratcha.  Incredible!

My husband was like no no to these shrimp cause he had them before at all you can eat Chinese places. But this dish changed his mind. I got a Thumps Up baby! We love them! Great flavor! Great dish! Crunchy good! Will make again

Used Adobo instead of salt and garlic powder. My husband loved it. Definitely a recipe I'll be making for years to come!

I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp, thawed, and added Tapatio and lemon juice to the eggs. So good! I also tossed the shrimp in a ziploc bag with the flour mix to make it a little easier. This recipe is a keeper!

Hooooly snap. Amazing. I don't cook often, but I would make this despite the mess, and the clean up. It was delicious, brilliant and all around easy. Best tasting, absolutely 100% will make again.

I saw this recipe early in the week and decided it would be a perfect Friday "happy hour" supper.  I read the reviews, made notes of what people liked to add, what modifications they made.... and I have to say the results were DELICIOUS!  I was cooking for 3 adults, 2 teens, and 1 child so I doubled the recipe.  The 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper & 1 tsp garlic powder were tossed with the 2 lbs peeled shrimp (I took off the tail, too -- it was easier to completely peel it than leave it on).  Instead of paprika, I used 1-1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning in 1 cup flour (still plenty of flour even with doubling the shrimp).  I added about 1/2 tsp garlic salt to each cup of panko (I needed about 4).   Using my Rival Deep Fryer, I fried 6-8 large shrimp per batch which is what fit comfortably in the basket and each batch took around 3 minutes.  It was so perfectly crunchy and such an indulgence since I probably make fried "anything" only a couple of times a year.  If you like more zip, add at least another tsp of Old Bay or some cayenne.  I think it could take more garlic, as well.  Fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time, I used one bag of small deveined, tail off shrimp, from Walmart, and it worked, awesomely!!  My husband devoured them!!  I got some, too!!  So, I made them, again!!  WE LOVE THESE!!  It takes some work, but WELL WORTH IT!!!! I added some paprika to my mixture, and it made a difference in the taste.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  FIVE STARS!!!!!!

Try marinating the shrimp in teriyaki sauce for at least 30 minutes before continuing with the recipe. Then you will have seriously full flavor.

I just finished a wonderful fried seafood dinner with my husband and this is recipe we used to make, not only fried shrimp, but also fried pieces of cod.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it was perfect.  Well...almost to the tee.  The only thing I did different was coat all the shrimp and pieces of cod first and let sit on a rack for about 15 minutes so the coating could set up.  I fried in a cast iron chicken fryer and used a deep fryer thermometer to keep tabs on the oil temp.  My large shrimp and pieces of cod were toasty brown and cooked to perfection inside in less than 5 mins. 

After dinner we decided we'd indulge in fish and chips once a month or so because this is just soooo good.  I used "Chef John's French Fries" recipe.  Perfect match.

Delicious, crunchy shrimp.  I was craving just something like this and it hit the spot.  I followed the directions but had about 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp so had to almost double everything.  Excellent method for getting crunchy shrimp.  We dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  Perfect.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Shrimp was fantastic & so easy.  Found I didn't have Panko breadcrumbs, so substituted crushed Ritz crackers & used a fondue pot to cook.

Oh my goodness!! No words of praise are enough!! Don't forget to also deep fry some veggies to go along with the shrimp!! I sliced part of a zucchini 1/4 inch thick and peeled and sliced part of a sweet potato 1/4 inch thick and also used a few snow peas; of course you'll need to use more batter and egg accordingly. I suggest dredging the veggies before the shrimp (for bacteria reasons). I cheated and used Kikkoman Tempura Dipping sauce - Yum!! Oh, and the veggies took between 3 - 4 minutes to fry to be 'just tender'.

These shrimp were crispy on the outside and full of moist shrimp goodness on the inside. Tasty! One thing though- it took WAY longer than 20 minutes total to make these. The dunking in all the different things took awhile, and because they couldn't all cook at the same time, the cooking also took a bit longer. I used less oil than indicated, because I don't have a deep-fryer or deep skillet, just a normal one, so the result were a bit less deep-fried than intended (which I thought was ok). I also took the suggestion to use less flour (1/2 cup) and I even still ended up with a bit of flour left over. My housemate also really enjoyed them.

Went to Costco, bought 4 lbs of super size shrimp, and wondered how much to freeze for later.  Uh, None!  Breaded those babies up,served with homemade cocktail sauce, and they were devoured.  Awwwwwwsome! And btw, the amount of flour listed for 1 lb was enough for my 4 lbs of shrimp.

The best homemade shrimp I ever made.  Stayed so nice and crunchy and NOT greasy.  I too like others used Bay Seasoning and let the shrimp sit for 15 min after breading.  I used extra large shrimp and cooked for 2 minutes - which was perfect.

Easy, very crispy and not at all greasy fried shrimp. I added some chipolte pepper and cumin (1 tsp of each) to the spice mix to add a little depth of flavor. A variety of dipping sauces completes the dish. Even my "I never eat fried foods" wife vanished them from the plate.

Simple, easy and great!  I added a little Old Bay to the Panko, and cooked it up just as recommended.  Came out fantastic!  Added my home-made cocktail sauce and some lemon.  It's a winner.

I thought these were just great!  Really good flavoring, awesome breading and the perfect crunch.  I only had sub par, no name, small shrimp in my freezer when I decided to try this recipe and they were still great.  Can't wait to do the same with better quality shrimp.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, except for cleaning the shrimp, the assembly line cooking process was fun. I used 4c italian bread crumbs instead of the panko crumbs, which probably made them more crunchy. We loved them, dipping them in sweet sauce or blue cheese. Just use less or eliminate salt in the recipe should you utilize the italian seasoned bread crumbs.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. My wife, who isn't thrilled with shrimp said it was the best I've ever made.

I needed the whole box of panko, an extra egg, and I halved the flour as other reviewers suggested. Are people really doing a pound of medium shrimp? I even took the tails off of mine! Even the recipe video that is clearly not a pound of medium shrimp! This would probably work better with large or jumbo. They didn't have much flavor aside from that deep fried flavor which I do always enjoy but they clearly needed more seasoning. They also turn soggy on reheat so be aware, only make enough for one serving, don't recommend these for leftovers. I would probably make these again but with some heavy modifications.

We followed recipe exactly and the shrimp turned out crunchy and browned perfectly. Be sure to use Panko  crumbs. We had a lot of flour mix left over, you could cut back there but extra is better than not enough!  This is second time to make and can’t wait to make again.

I just made this tonite for my husband and I and it turned of great.  I only had 1/2 lb shrimp so I halfed all the other ingredients. However I did add onion powder to the dry ingredients but outside of that the dinner was excellent.  I will be making this again and again.
Thanks for posting this recipe.

My 12 year old was in charge of planning and making dinner tonight. He loves shrimp. He chose this recipe and paired it with steam fresh veggies and ramen noodles. The shrimp came out amazing!! We’ll definitely be using this recipe again in the future.

Just had this for dinner - YUM! I have not made a lot of fried shrimp, but when I have I always seasoned in the flour.  This time I followed a reviewer's advice and didn't skip the step and she is right, it makes all the difference! I have never let them sit before either, and also used to start with them still wet - I'm so glad I found this recipe with the proper prep instructions.  My new go-to fried shrimp recipe!

Excellent.  Marinated the shrimp in garlic powder, salt and pepper for an hour in the 'fridge and then let the shrimp come up to room temp. a bit and then followed the directions for coating the shrimp to a tee EXCEPT we added some shredded coconut and just a bit of all-purpose flour and all-season salt into the panko crumbs and deep-fried them and they were, as I said above, EXCELLENT!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! 

This was my first time frying shrimp, so I was a bit nervous, but followed a few of the suggested tips and it turned divine!

Tips: 

1) I added garlic salt, old bay seasoning, dried parsley and dried oregano to the suggested seasonings.

2) After prepping the shrimp, I let them sit on a rack for a few minutes to "set" while the oil heated up.

3) Once they went into the pan, I lowered the heat and fried them a bit "low and slow"

Since I didn't have panko, I used store bought bread crumbs. I also  added parsley to the shrimp along with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. The shrimp overall was amazing. There's no doubt that I'll be making these again.

This is a  great recipe! I used it on pre-cooked shrimp, fried until golden brown, and it was delicious. The shrimp did not overcook or get chewy. The key to panko fried shrimp, in my opinion, is a yummy dipping sauce. I paired it with a lemon aioli (mayo, lemon juice, garlic and a little dijon), but any great dipping sauce will work. Thank you for the recipe!

Well I overheated the oil and burnt 5 of em haha! I should have read the comment tips beforehand. On my second try, there wasn't enough oil to submerge the shrimp so I flip em' a lot. They were more brown than golden in the end. I did double fry them to be extra crispy. Even though it was kinda burnt it was good! I like it like that I guess LOL The flavoring was simple and great! I also made a garlic butter dip and white rice to go with. Too bad I'm the only one that likes seafood around here! I have lots of leftovers! Oh and I have A LOT of flour left over so maybe use less.

I made this according to directions. I used 16/20 sized shrimp and the shrimp came out nice and tender and moist. Shrimp need to be "just" cooked so make sure that you do not overlook. Make sure your oil is hot (not too hot) and cook a few at a time (Don't crowd the pot) so that they can float around a bit. Cook until just crispy coating and golden.

Made this as written and was very good. The only thing I would change is to add a little more garlic flavor. Will make this again, again and again.

I'm not a very good cook, and these actually turned out wonderful!  (Which means it should be super easy for anyone to make!)
Very crunchy, which I loved.  My husband is not a big crunch fan, so said next time he'd like to do fried shrimp with a more simple breading.
But I loved them!

Excellent fried shrimp. Will make coconut shrimp next time. Got rid of my old recipe because this one is better. I found shrimp on sale a lot on January so bought several pounds and used the last bag I had for this recipe. Was barely enough since my husband kept popping them down like he had never had shrimp before! LOL. Fabulous with the panko...that is the difference for me.  Made some spicy cocktail sauce with ketchup, horseradish, squeeze of fresh lemon and worsterschire sauce and it was just devine. Served this with home made fries and some cole slaw I made.

Looking for a crunchy coated shrimp, this met our desire! I followed  some of the suggestions and appreciated the seasoning and plate rest once coated. I used corn flour made for shrimp before the panko coating and held the coating well. 3 minutes was perfect timing at 375 degrees.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We did dredge the shrimp & let them sit for an hour or so in the fridge before we deep fried them  so the panko stayed on and didn't fall off during the frying process.  This was a little light on the spices for our taste but this recipe is just a guideline for what you can do.  We will definitely make again!

Good recipe. Really easy to follow and easy to make. The only adjustment I made was to add 1/4 tsp of ground pepper vs. 1/2 tsp. I'm not really into the peppery taste. Overall, yummy!

Easy and made great tasting appetizer.  Echo others' suggestion about flour-coating the shrimp all at once.  Going from egg to panko coats is easier if panko is on large plate.  Recommended flour qty was overstated by about 1/4 cup I would say.

We *loved* this recipe! My youngest daughter asked if it was takeout! 

When I made it,it did take more egg than stated to coat all of the shrimps, especially when you have sticky, floury fingers, but not a big deal. 

The only negative thing was that I found them very salty. Next time I'll definitely tone down the amount of salt in this recipe significantly. Other than that, great recipe, a real keeper.

Very tasty and crispy!  I used small shrimps since that was what I had at hand, but I think it really would work better with medium or large shrimps, as the recipe says.

I tried a recipe a few weeks ago for fried shrimp and it was okay but not great. This week i made 2 different recipes for fried shrimp and did a taste test with my wife and kids. Everyone picked this recipe. I could taste the garlic and pepper but they are very suttle. I might add a little more garlic next time. This is definately the best!!!

All I can say is that I wish I had fixed two pounds! I didn't want to share! Really, really great. This will become a regular in our home. Really some of the best shrimp I have ever had. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  Easy to make.  I used more Panko that it called for, but a lot less flour.  Next time I'd half the flour mixture and up the Panko.  Otherwise it turned out great.

This was great even without garlic. I used sea salt instead of regular salt. Delicious. Nice and crunchy

Pretty straight foward fried shrimp. Shrimp, flour, S&P, other spices, panko, and oil. Not sure why the 5 star ratings. I like to butterfly my shrimp, and add fresh herbs to the panko. Parsley or chives.

fantastic! Followed it exactly and it was excellent. Though next time I'm going to substitute the panko with flour and baking powder and see how that turns out.

Great recipe with the right amount of spices! I used regular bread crumbs and it worked just as well, the prep took longer than I thought but prepping them all before cooking was a great idea! Thanks all!

This was so easy to make.  We loved it--so crunchy and flavorful. I substituted Paula Deen's house seasoning for the flour/S&P/garlic powder/paprika because it is so similar, and I had it on hand. I fried the shrimp in my BD deep fryer. This is now my go-to fried shrimp recipe.
