Very good! I used 3 TBLS fajita seasoning and just chopped up red & green bell peppers instead of using frozen ones.  I also added some sliced onions to the saute.  Once in our tortillas, we topped w/ sour cream, salsa, 3-blend mexican cheese, and Mexcian Rice II (from this site).  In no time, I had a tasty dinner.  If you really want an all-around mexican feast, for dessert, make some "Fried Cinnamon Strips" recipe from this site and you got a hit. Thanks L.O.L.

Very good!  I altered it slightly by just chopping up my own peppers instead of using a fajita vegitable mix -- also try not chopping up the chicken and top the chicken breast with some peppers and montery jack cheese.

Very good.  Almost like fajitas without the shells.  Great over some yellow rice.

My husband enjoyed this meal.  He said he felt like he was eating in a mexican restaurant.  My only question was, "why use so little of the fajita seasoning?"  What I was pleased about was that I was able to incorportate three different vegetables into my husbands diet...red, yellow, and green peppers.  And we are all about that.

Took the suggestions and used 1 packet of taco seasoning, also fresh peppers & onion and the dish came out very flavorful.  Served black beans & corn medley on the side.  Great meal, quick & easy.

I make this several times a month. I use a little extra fajita seasoning and marinate the chicken in the seasoning and a little liquid smoke before cooking. I leave out the corn and serve with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese and some chipolte picante sauce. My husband is addicted to chipolte.

Good.  It could use more fajita seasoning though.

Very good! For a hungry guy, 1 serving won't cut it (3 servings was about right for me), but it's great tasting, and easy to make for a beginner cook.
