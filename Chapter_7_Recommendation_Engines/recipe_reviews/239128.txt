These were some pretty tasty potatoes. Prep work took some time but it was totally worth it. I used more cheese and bacon than the recipe called for. Two and half cups of cheese and ten slices of bacon.
Recipe makes a lot so I think next time I'll halve it.

My eaters loved these.  I would suggest sprinkling salt and pepper on each layer.  I used the slicing blade of the food processor to slice the potatoes which made it really fast and easy.

We all LOVED these potatoes! I used a whole 8 oz. block of Swiss cheese, grated. Also, I followed Baking Nana's advice and salt and peppered each layer of potatoes. This was serious comfort food, and something I will def be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good. Made it exactly as written the first time with delicious results.  Added a small clove of minced garlic and used Gruyere instead of Swiss cheese the second time - to die for.  Could have eaten the whole pan myself.

These were good, and easy enough to toss together on a weeknight, but I was hoping for a little more of a rich/cheesy flavor.  I really enjoyed the onion and left out the bacon when I realized we were out as I was prepping dinner.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was an excellent dish. I made it to go with ham and cabbage rolls. The Swiss cheese is a nice change from cheddar and it reheat very well.

Loved the flavor of this, but, I followed the ingredients but the cook time is way off. I used a 325 degree oven for 1 hour 20 minutes and the potatoes were still raw. I placed servings on a covered plate and nuked for 4 minutes so we could eat and recovered and baked the dish. Bittersweet because it tastes and smells wonderful.

I made this using blue cheese instead and added grilled onions and garlic.  Sprinkle some parmesan at the end when finished.  Boom.  More awesome.

Made this as per the recipe.  I agree that it needed a little more seasoning.  Will add quite a bit more if I make it again.  I'd also add more cheese.  Nice option to other types of potatoes.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and have been making it ever since followed exactly as a side dish. Everyone loves it. I also frequently use this recipe, but substitute cubed ham instead of bacon to make it a main dish. Sometimes I use cheddar instead of Swiss  to change it up since I make these so often :)

Eh... nothing to write home about. Not much flavor and kinda greasy.
