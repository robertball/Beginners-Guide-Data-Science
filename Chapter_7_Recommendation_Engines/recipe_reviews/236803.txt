I thought I'd try this bread as I am never satisfied with what we buy from the bakery. Just finished making this bread. Omg the taste is great, so much better than any bakery. Good thing there are four loaves or I don't think I'd have any left for dinner.! It's so easy to follow (and I never make bread). This will be a keeper in my recipe book for sure.

I married in to an Italian family. When my husband's grandmom died so did the hope of good Easter/Holiday bread. Until this recipe, that is!  I am a fair baker, with minimal bread-making experience. I had no troubles! I did find that my bread rose much more quickly that it states. I also reduced the anise flavoring considerably and left out the seeds altogether. Great recipe! ( See pics)

It rose nicely...but the cake itself was a little dry for me.    I only baked it for 20 min....so I don't think it was in the oven too long.  Very pretty Easter dessert....but a little too dry for me.
