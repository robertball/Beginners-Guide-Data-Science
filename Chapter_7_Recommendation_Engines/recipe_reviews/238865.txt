This was DISGUSTING!!!! The pasta was extremely soggy and the breading fell off the chicken. I followed the recipe exactly but the tastes were all wrong!! The flavors reminded me of the southwest or Mexican food. I will DEFINITELY not be making this again and I suggest you donâ€™t either.

It was great. After frying the chicken in the egg batter and dry mix , I put it in the oven with the Marinara and parmesan on top. My family loved it !

This was pretty tasty! The chicken breast coating stayed crisp and didn't get soggy! I made my own bucatini pasta and three cheese Alfredo sauce. Bravo!!
