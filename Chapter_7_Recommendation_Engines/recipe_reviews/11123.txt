I was very disappointed in the "taste" of these cookies.  The recipe itself was simple, but the outcome was not what I had hoped.

I was very dissapointed with this cookie, they taste awful, and it was a waste of time. There has to be a better tasting cookie out there.

O.k.  I gave this five stars for the presentation.  I took it to my church Halloween party and people thought it was hysterical!  I really made realistic looking poops!  Curled ones, straight ones etc.  

Now for the taste.  These are not the best cookies by any means.  I added brown sugar to try to help out with the flavor, but they are just very floury and dry.  If I could rate the taste I would say more like two stars.  I'm sure their is a better recipe out there.

But really, are we making this recipe for the taste?  I don't think so.

I added 1/2 C. brown sugar, but it didn't really help the taste. The cookies are very bland. What helped immensely was the caramel topping I served with them, which you can pass off as... you know. The cookies alone have no taste, but with caramel, they are very good!

As others have said, this is not the greatest cookie in the world but hey- like a bunch of elementary school-age kids really care (hehe). The effect is what got (and held) their attention. OK, modified the recipe a bit and made the dough a bit moister, cut back on the honey a bit and threw in a little brown sugar. Served in a new, clean litter pan with a new, clean scoop. I also microwaved a few long Tootsie Rolls and stuck them in the Grape-Nuts, and "hung" 2 of the Tootsie Rolls over the edge of the box for that extra-special visual touch. The girls wouldn't touch them, but the boys were crazy about them. I didn't add coconut, or ramen noodles though, that would have been too much for me! Will make again, although for the effect, rather than culinary merit  ;-)

I was hoping for a sharp contrast between the appearance and taste.  I don't think this recipe achieved that.

Ok, I didn't make the cookies BUT instead I bought pretzels and dipped them in nutella and rolled them in the grape nuts!  It was so awesome and they actually tasted very good!  I buried some deep and the ones on top I left a little more chocolate showing so it looked like fresh poop.  I broke the pretzels to make them all different sizes as well. Hahaha, people loved them!  I made them the night before and covered them with foil and just put them in the fridge to harden a bit about 2 hours before the party.

These don't taste very good at all.  I think it would be cute to use a CLEAN cat poop scoop, instead of a serving fork.

I thought the actual cookies were a little balnd as well.  But the reaction at my company's Halloween food table was priceless!  Next time I will try adding more honey or maybe brown sugar.  Email me for a picture of this dish.

The presentation was a hit, but the taste was not good. Too much cocoa I think and not enough sugar. I would only make them again for shock value, not for actual consumption.

This recipe was pretty good. I added about 1 Tablespoon of half and half to make it a bit more moist, and only baked each sheet for about 9 minutes. (Tested this time with just a couple of cookies first.) This recipe was a BIG hit in the teacher's workroom!

I didn't think they tasted all that great but who cares... the point is that they totally look like cat poop and its fun to gross out the guests at a Halloween party!
