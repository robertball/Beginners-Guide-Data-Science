This was my Grandma's Chopped Liver recipe too!  Sadly, she passed away in 1997, before I had the recipe.  I followed your recipe precisely, and am quite nostalgic at the moment.  A heartfelt thank you for this terrific recipe, which I will pass along to my daughters.

Holy Moly! This rivals any chopped liver I've had from Jewish delis. Delicious. I altered the recipe only slightly, because I had only 1 pound of livers and was low on onions. I used a scallion with the liver and kept both eggs. I fried half of one onion and used the other half raw. Oh, the discipline it is taking not to eat the whole batch! Thank you!!

I was staying with my elderly mother and she was having problems with anemia. In addition to her iron supplement I looked up on the internet other iron rich foods that I could make for her.  Liver is right up there at the top and I found this recipe.  OMG it is good!  The three textures of onion (boiled, fried and raw) plus the hard boiled eggs add tons to the texture and flavor.  Reminds me of when we used to get really good chopped chicken livers from the Jewish deli as a kid. Now I make it all the time. It's so easy! Thanks for sharing AJ.

i was skeptical how this would taste using the raw onions. I almost left them out. I was also worried about processing this to mush in the food processor.  I decided to follow the recipe exactly and was blown away by how great it came out.  I used pulse on the food processor, resulting in a great consistency.  It wasn't too oniony and didn't have any of that gamey flavor that chopped liver can get. A great recipe. THANKS!

This is awesome chopped liver. The only thing I did different was use chicken broth instead of water and then added 1 chicken bouillon cube.

This was pretty tasteless.  Next time, I'll go back to starting off with saut√©ing the liver with onions.

This is close to my grandmother's recipe, but to give it fives stars I have to make a few small changes. Use just one (1) large sweet onion, two (2)stalks celery without the tops, three (3) hard cooked eggs and schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) in place of the oil.  When I have time I used the grinder, but in a pinch you can use the food processor. Cut the onion and celery into large pieces. Coarsely process the celery and onion. Add the eggs and then add the liver and process a few seconds, until all the ingredients are combined. Add the Schmaltz (to taste) by hand. Season with kosher salt --you'll use a few spoonfuls--and black pepper. Serve on sliced rye bread or matzoh crackers.

This is truly a special treat for those who love chopped liver. It's definitely an acquired taste, but once you've got it, you find yourself craving it. I made this for my bro's birthday party and it was a hit. Thanks!

I made this for the first time for a Elderly friend that was craving "Chopped Liver" like in the big city.  I added one more hard boiled egg than recommended and 1 tbsp. of Hot Hungarian Paprika.
Cleaning the membranes from the livers was alittle laabor intensive ( but worth it ) and I soaked the raw livers overnight in milk ( suggested by another entry ) to tenderize them.
I thought the recipe was delicious, my elderly friend said "Well..the taste isn't what I am used to, but it is still good!" ...So at least I tryed to please a friend.

So delicious!  Reminds me of Passover with the family as a kid. I used to think chopped liver was SO gross and couldn't understand why the grownups found it so tasty.
Now that I'm living away from my family, I kinda got nostalgic and had a weird craving. Followed this recipe exactly, and it came out DELICIOUS! I have a feeling the whole thing will be gone by tomorrow.  Just another case of the grownups being right. I guess sometimes they do know what's good for you!

This was my maiden trial and I was very, very nervous, especially since I'm vegetarian.  However, it looked good and I actually tasted a tad bit and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor,texture, and odor. 
I was offered chopped liver back when I ate flesh and although I wanted to taste it, the smell made me nauseous.  So, I soaked the liver in cold water with the freshly squeezed juice of half a lemon for about 10 minutes, then rinsed before putting to boil. The lemon juice eliminated the rank odor.
Anxiously awaiting the reviews from my guests tomorrow.

I made both this recipe (Grandma's Chopped Liver) and Val's Hungarian Jewish Chopped Liver for a gathering of six friends, including 3 chopped-liver lovers, 2 who'd never had it, and one who grew up with it but does NOT like it. 

Everyone was required to taste it, and I took a vote on who liked which one the best. All 6 people declared both recipes delicious, but four people voted this one their favorite, including the person who did not like the chopped liver of his childhood. 

Two people commented that this recipe resembles pate. This is because the boiled onions give off moisture when the mixture is put through the grinder, so it has a smoother consistency. This one also had a deeper, more layered flavor because the livers are simmered in chicken stock for an hour. (They were so good, I ate a few whole.)

I'll be making this recipe often. I might try sauteing celery with the onion next time just to add another layer of flavor.

It doesn't say to drain the water (chicken broth) but I assumed that's what I was supposed to do...

I used CALF Liver instead of the chicken and I cooked it with the whole eggs (to hard boil them) and one (opened) egg in with it. 

Made this for my husband, he really liked it, and is NOT a "Liver Lover."

The only complaint I have with this recipe is that it reads unclear for some points. None of the points are critical for most people, I just prefer recipes to be as exact as possible, covering all bases. The points are as follows:

a) the shells need to be removed from the eggs after hardboiling - obvious, I know, but I feel it should be added
b) I peeled off the outer layer of the onions before chopping/boiling them - again, obvious, but omitted
c) after removing the items from the boiled/simmered liquid, the remaining liquid can either be discarded or, as I did, kept for use as broth (I found it to be very tasty). I added a couple of teaspoons of it to the liver mixture just to ensure it retained some of its moisture while in storage. The rest went into jars.

My nitpicky points aside, the chopped livers come out amazing with this recipe, and are even good before you add the salt and pepper, for those avoiding sodium.

I made this recipe for my mom who loves chopped liver.  She said it had a terrific flavor, but the texture was not as firm as she would have liked.  I think the next time I would either omit the boiled onion, or only put about 1/4-1/2 of it in as it was very juicy and watered the liver down a little too much.  Otherwise, this was a great recipe and really easy!

This is a wonderful recipe! MashaAllah  I did alter it a bit. I did not use bouillon cubes, because of the preservatives. Instead I used the left over juice of a chicken that I baked earlier. I freeze all my left over juice from my chickens and beef roasts just for this matter. Instant bouillon cubes! and I know exactly what is in it.
I also used three eggs instead of two. And I used red onions that I had on hand. 
I kept the leftover juice from stewing the livers for later use as well.  Nothing goes to waste in our kitchen. :)
My husband, who is German, said it reminded him of the liver pate his grandmother use to make. :) 
I used our Nutribullet and within a minute it was as smooth as silk! 
What better way to get the health benefits of liver into your diet?!
This will surely be a staple in our home from now on.  
I made a batch of homemade Rye crackers to go along with it and it was simply the best! MashaAllah Our new favorite evening snack.

With the exception of first pan frying the liver in a bit of bacon fat, I stayed pretty close to the recipe.  I did drop a raw, in-shell egg into the simmering liver until it was hard boiled then shelled it and added to the processor.  I did not simmer the liver for an hour, but 15 minutes with the egg cooking and 15 minutes on its own.  the three onion idea was great; I fried the onions until they were starting to brown.  I will make this again, especially for a party

I added 3 cloves of garlic while cooking the livers, and a pinch of whole coriander to the seasoning the mix at the end. Probably next time, I will drain the livers a bit more so it holds better. Otherwise, it is very delicious! Thank you!

This is my "Go To" recipe for Chopped Liver and it is a hit every time!  I do change how I use my onions.  As instructed, one onion is cooked with the liver (and then I grind it together with the cooked liver).  One onion is chopped and then fried on a very low heat for 15-20 minutes (do this while the liver is simmering), and then I add it to the cooked chopped liver. The last onion is chopped and served (on the side) with the liver.  Many people enjoy putting raw onion on their chopped liver. I even cook an extra egg or two with the liver and then serve it (shredded) on the side next to the raw onions.  Very pretty, colorful plate!

I made Grandma‚Äôs chopped liver for Christmas Day breakfast for my family.  The day before my brother in law purchased  chopped liver from a very reputable Jewish Deli and when the family tasted mine he threw out the chopped liver he purchased because mine was so good.  I altered the recipe a bit. I cooked the onions until they were browned put half in the food processor with the livers and once it was grind I put the other half of the browned onions in the liver mixture but did not grind.

Easy and delicious! What this doesn't tell you is the broth is also delicious - not to mention nutritious. The broth was the best thing my daughter had after her surgery and she couldn't thank me enough.
