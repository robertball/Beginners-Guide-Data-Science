I love breakfast smoothies, there are many good ones on this site that I make often, and this will be added to my list.  Used frozen strawberries and Cabot Low-Fat Vanilla Bean Greek Yogurt (my new go-to vanilla yogurt).  This is very tasty, but I don't think there's much to distinguish it from many others, not meant as a negative because it is very good and creamy.

Hubs called this “a real treat;” sweet, and not sort of sour as many are.  (Could be because I made it with our own Wisconsin frozen vanilla custard,not yogurt, and reduced the amount of honey)  I asked him if he could tell me what was in it.  He said that was difficult to answer as no single flavor was predominant.  That’s a good thing if you have a smoothie with multiple fruits, right?  He said he assumed there were strawberries in it, but only because of its color.  He called it “pleasantly sweet and fruity.”  I call that good.

Just made this. I added vanilla flavoring, bit don't think it needed it. I should gave frozen the bananas, after tasting I added ice cubes to thicken. Very flavorful and bright in those hard to go to work mornings.

I used it but left the yoghurt out since I wanted a fruit drink but I followed the rest of the recipe and loved it.
