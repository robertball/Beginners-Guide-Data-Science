This is our latest favourite recipe.  I freeze the uncooked meatloaf cups by scooping generous scoops and pressing them onto parchment paper covered cookie sheets.  Freeze on the cookie sheet, then package in ziploc bags. Now, we've got fast food potential!
I agree about adding garlic.  You can also disguise/dress them up by shaping the small tortilla shells into muffin tins and cooking them at 350 for ten minutes.  Plunk a meatloaf cup into each, and your meal looks even more appealing.

These were fantastic! I didn't have couscous so i substituted cooked quinoa (already cooked BEFORE adding to the recipe) and they were delicious! Also great the next day too.

Awesome and tasty! Mine turned out just barely a tad mushy (fresh out of the oven only), which I think is my fault since I nearly liquified the veggies in the food processor, which the directions clearly state NOT to do. I did use breadcrumbs instead of couscous b/c that's all I had on hand. Leftovers re-heated GREAT in the microwave and were not mushy at all. My DH has been cringing all week thinking about this meal, NO ONE thought it would taste good and EVERYONE loved it. I can't complain a bit, this was delicious and I will make these often. I had enough to do a full cupcake pan (12 or 15?) plus I have a pan of 9 in the freezer. I did add 2 cloves fresh garlic when processing the veggies, and some salt and pepper, and did a 1/2 ketchup/1/2 BBQ/worshestire/red pepper flake topping instead of plain BBQ sauce, we like to spice things up in my house. Served with pierogies and veggies.

We make turkey meatloaf, meatballs, and burgers at least once a week. I was looking for a recipe that was slightly different then what I normally make. I used 3 lbs of ground turkey, 1l arge Red bell pepper, 1 large green bell pepper, 1 large vidalia onion, 4 cloves garlic minced,6 Tbs Worcestershire sauce, 3 Tbs Dijon, 3 eggs, 2 cups italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup olive oil(did not have couscous or zucchini on hand) and topped each large meatloaf muffin with a squeeze of Bulls-Eye Kansas City barbeque sauce. It made 23 delicious meatloaf cupcakes. They reached 160 degrees in 18 minutes on 400 degrees oven. The entire family raved about these and they had a completely different flavor than what I normally make. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I promise that I will stop thinking bad about ground turkey as a beef substitute. This is the third recipe, from this site, that I've tried, and once again it was an out of the park home-run. I am sure we might play with this recipe in the future, but we followed it as written and all I can say is WHO KNEW??? This was just wonderful.

These were fast to put together and tasty. I did add salt and pepper and some minced garlic to this. I didn't eat these the same day, but rather the next day for dinner. I like the texture.. nice and firm, not crumbly. Next time I think I'll use my usual mixture of ketchup and tabasco on top.. I missed the sweet/spiceness

10 stars!!  Don't forget the barbecue sauce, it really enhances the flavor.  I put all the vegetables in my food processor and chopped them together to make it easier.  I love recipes that serve a dual purpose!  Meatloaf plus veggies that don't have to be 'hidden' make this recipe a true winner.  My whole family devoured these, and asked that they be placed in our meal rotation.  Thanks for a GREAT healthy recipe!

Love the idea of making into cups but the recipe itself could use more flavor. I used cooked quinoa and added extra Worchestershire, lots of garlic and s/p to the mix. I subbed a small green pepper for red and threw in some carrots as well. I didn't liquify the veggies but next time would keep them a lil large for texture (esp carrots for crunch). For the topping I used bbq sauce, tomato paste and chili pepper sauce. I made a dozen large cups and cooked 30m at 400. They were moist but still a lil bland. Next time I'll add some more seasoning (onion/garlic powder, basil perhaps) and definitely more sauce on top. Made with sweet potatoes and sweet and spicey green beans from AR. The sauce from the grean beans was great with the meat. Will do again soon and make adjustments!

If I based this review on taste alone, I would probably give it four stars but the taste with the unbelievably low calorie count gives it an easy five stars.  I used ground chicken instead of turkey, added a lot of salt, pepper, and garlic powder and will add even more next time.  My food processer is currently broke so I just shredded all of the vegetables (which probably added more veggies since I measured a more compact zucchini and onion).  Number one thing, I did NOT try to sell this as meatloaf to my husband.  I said that I made zucchini cups and he came into it with an open mind.  If I had said meatloaf, he would have expected meatloaf and it would have been the baked cauliflower that I tried to pass as pizza crust all over again:)

I don't have a food processor so I grated the veggies instead. They turned out quite well. With a little extra BBQ sauce they make good leftovers too.

Great weeknight dish! I made half of them with store bought BBQ sauce, and half a mixture of ketchup, worcestershire, and red pepper flakes. The latter really complemented the dish.

Great flavor and the zucchini kept the meatloaf very moist since turkey has a tendency to be dry. I didn't have red pepper so I used 1 1/2 carrots instead. They were a great crunchy substitute! Also, the saucy topping is my favorite part so I will up it to 3/4 cup next time so that each muffin can be smothered. The family loved it--even my VERY picky 88-year-old Pappaw!

No couscous????  Substitute oatmeal!!!

This is a great recipe.  I substituted 1 cup of uncooked old-fashioned oatmeal for the couscous  (the quick- cook variety will probably work just as well).  The other changes I made were to use two eggs and three tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce instead of two. Also I grated the zucchini using  the coarse side of the grater.  The flavor was light, but very good.  They were a bit difficult to get out of the muffin cups and my pans were nearly new non-stick pans. Next time, I plan to try baking them as patties on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Overall ...... a Great Recipe!

We loved these. They're easy to make in advance, plop in the muffin tin then stick in the 'fridge. They were incredibly moist despite using 93/7 lean turkey.  Using a large, levered ice cream scoop makes this really easy to portion out.  I used the Cuisinart to grate all of the veggies but only used one huge onion which yielded less than the 1.5 cups called for.  I drained and very gently squeezed out the excess water from the veggies, minced a few large garlic cloves, used whole wheat couscous (which you don't detect in flavor OR texture), added 1/2 tsp. of salt and used 2 eggs to eliminate any concern about binding (they held together beautifully and came out of the tin easily).  The recipe yielded 16 meatloaves using a standard-sized, well-sprayed muffin tin, and I did half w/ bbq sauce and half w/ ketchup.  My bean-pole teenage daughter ate 4(!), my husband ate 3 (there were a few more ketchup'd ones as leftovers, so bbq must've been the winner) and we have leftovers for tomorrow night!  I'd happily make these again and double the recipe so I could freeze some and have FOUR nights of dinner covered! No WAY does this recipe serve 10; I'd say it'd serve a hungry family of 5 with two or three left over.

Light, moist, not crumbly = delicious! I pressed two cloves of garlic to add to the mix and threw in a teaspoon of cayenne, which definitely brought the heat. Could have used a couple shakes of salt and turns of the pepper mill. I topped half with ketchup (what I am used to topping meatloaf growing up!) and half with Bull's-Eye Original. I preferred the lighter flavor of the ketchup, hubby preferred the BBQ (though he noted it can be overwhelming, so no need to overdo it.)

Very flavorful and moist. Pretty kid friendly too, and a good way to get some extra veggies in. I didn't realize until too late I didn't have the couscous so I substituted a 1/4 cup of quinoa cooked first in 1/2 cup of water, which worked out well. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I would not bake them in muffin tins next time though, as it was some mess to clean up. This would work well as a loaf or meatballs. The leftovers made great sandwiches the next day, which was a bonus.

These surprised my husband and me both!  Wow!  I usually have to make a ton of changes to be happy with a recipe, but these required very few.  I used quinoa instead of couscous, because that's what I had on hand; Instead of 1 1/2 cups onions, I did 1 cup onion and 1/2 cup finely shredded carrot; I threw in 6 finely minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to give it a little more flavor; and I used 20 oz. of ground turkey instead of 16 oz. due to complaints of the meat-to-veggie ratio.  I baked them for 30 minutes, which was perfect--they were just starting to pull away from the edges of the pan and were easy to remove.  This made 20 very nicely sized "muffins", of which my husband ate 5!  They did not taste "too veggie" and were actually light while still being filling.  We'll be enjoying these again later in the week and are already looking forward to it.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These are great, very diet-friendly, and also works well when made as a regular sized 9x5 loaf. I go overboard with veggies and add in lots more than the recipe calls for (finely minced carrots, zucchini, broccoli).

Made these last night & they were a hit with the whole family!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because after reading many reviews I made these changes: 2 lbs. turkey (after reading reviews I realized there was too many veggies to meat ratio), 2 pressed garlic cloves, 2 eggs, 3 T. Worc, 2 T. Dijon, S/P & 3/4 C. Italian bread crumbs (not a fan of couscous). I had to cook for 45-50 min. as well. This is a wonderful base recipe to tweak to your liking!! Will DEFINITELY make again--thx!!!!

I'm too cheap to buy red pepper (at $4+ a pound), so I added carrots and mushrooms instead because I had them.  Could of used some pepper and maybe even a little salt.  I would play with some seasonings next time.  But the muffin tin worked great and I will be making again!  Thanks.

Best meatloaf!!  I used one cup zucchini and one cup shredded carrot, and I used quinoa instead of couscous (that's what I had on hand).  I also greased my teflon cupcake tins. This is a keeper!

I've made this recipe so many times and am always impressed at how tasty and healthy it is.  It freezes wonderfully and tastes just as good when reheated.  It is so easy to throw together.

Made this tonight for my husband who is trying to lose weight.  He loved it and I liked it also.  I used 99% fat free ground turkey and followed the recipe exactly although I had to chop/dice the vegetables by hand.
They turned out delish, solid - yet tender and moist.
Thanks for this healthy recipe.

Made this exactly to the recipe last night and it was awesome.  Oh, I did add some garlic.  I used a "bold" BBQ sauce on top but next time I think I'll use a sweeter sauce.  Can't wait to have a leftover for lunch today.

Will definitely be making this again. Grated the zucchini and onion since I don't have a food processor. Also omitted the bell pepper. Next time I will add a touch of seasoned salt and maybe some garlic. But still delicious as is!

I made this for Dinner tonight. I was SO GOOD yet so healthy that I thought I would share! I used 99% fat free lean Organic ground turkey. 1 and a half Zuchinni's. I substituted carrots and Celery for the red Bell Pepper and I added 1/3 cup of whole wheat Panko bread crumbs. I omitted the Dijon and mixed 1/2 cup of Barbecue, 1/2 cup of ketchup and 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire and then mixed 1/3 of a cup of it in with the meatloaf mix. Then I spread rest on the top of each "Meat Cupcake" as I like to call them! There was more than needed to fill a full Muffin Pan so I also used a mini loaf pan.
I served them up with some Quinoa Pilaf (Homemade). SUPER DELICIOUS AND SUPER NUTRICIOUS! YUM!

This was hands down the best meatloaf my family has had.  It was moist and a big hit with our 3 yr and 4 yr old children. The kids didn't even notice the veggies inside.   Made a couple of changes.  I omitted the the bell pepper, omitted the couscous and added Italian bread crumbs in its place, increased the turkey to two pounds,  increased to 2 eggs, and added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  This is my new go to recipe for meatloaf

The basic recipe is very close to mine, although I use ketchup, the jumbo muffin tins, add a layer of creamy spinach and top it with mashed potatoes, bake it and then freeze it for lunches at work for my husband and I.

These were wonderful!  I loved the addition of barbecue sauce on top!  I added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the mix, plus 1 tsp. garlic.  Would make those same changes again, except use even MORE salt (1 tsp. total).  I used regular size muffin cups, and baked them 35 minutes.  Note that the couscous doesn't have time to hydrate/cook completely if you eat them without letting them sit for 10-15 minutes after baking; but note that if you let the mix sit for 30 minutes BEFORE baking, the couscous hydrates at that time quite a bit.  Just something to consider if you want to avoid crunchy couscous.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a perfect recipe to make on a Sunday to have lunches for a few days - re-heats well in the microwave.  I only gave four stars because I made some modifications.  I have made this twice so far, the second time being much better. The first time, I put the vegetables in a blender and I think I blended for a little too long.  It created a lot of juice that I was tempted to skim off.  I used quinoa instead of couscous, because I already had it on hand.  Over all, they came out well but a little dry (because I skimmed off that extra juice) and bland.  The second time I used the As Seen On TV Salsa maker to chop the veggies separately to avoid pureeing.   I also added 3 cloves of fresh hard-neck garlic, a dash of pepper and used the quinoa again.  This second batch came out fantastic!  I will definitely continue to make these!

Pretty good!  If you dont use the bbq sauce it is blandish.  Not that blandish can be bad!  Very nice and easy.  My muffin tin looked yucky so I tossed it, and just spooned globs in a glass dish and that was fine. Put the sauce on half of the globs.   Had alot leftover raw, so I divided it and put into freezer bags log style.  Before I did though, I squirted some garlic paste in and added a decent amout of peppercorn blend and  froze.  Will use this recipe again!  Think I over cooked them too,they were a little dry but yummy!  Think this would be good for a party if you made little cakes or balls and put them in the bbq sauce after cooking.  Thanks!  Good recipe!

Wow, these did not taste good at all! I like vegetables, but even the vegetables seemed excessive compared to the amount of ground turkey. It may be the first recipe I have ever seen without salt, but that wasn't the problem. Besides lacking any major flavor the texture and appearance was like stuffing/dressing on the plate. My vegetables may have got ground too small, I don't know? That may have contributed to it. However, I did not like the couscous in it either. It just added to the mushy texture. I ended up baking them in mini rectangle pans and got 10 instead of 12, but I had to add 25 minutes onto the cooking time. I sure hope someone will eat this so they don't all get tossed out. I am not sure how to salvage it into something else.

My family enjoyed these (my, my husband, 9 year old and 1 year old).  The mix was runny but the meatloaf did not come out runny after it was baked.  I added salt and pepper to the mix, and I filled the muffin cups to the top and baked for 30 minutes.

This has become one of my favorite ground turkey recipes.   I also don't have a food processor so I just chopped the veggie's very small.  A definite keeper.  Thank you for the submit.

Yum! And very easy. As several other reviewers did, I also added some shredded cheese on top before baking. My only beef (see what I did there?) is that they are quite crumbly so I might add another egg and maybe some breadcrumbs next time. Delicious though, and really handy to take to work with just a salad on the side.

These were really yummy, quick and easy!  I used zucchini, carrot, garlic and onion and whole wheat cous couse and a nice zesty bbq sauce.  These cooked really fast and couldn't have been easier.  Great way to sneak in some extra veggies into a meal.  Like others, I grated the zuccini and carrot and finely minced the onion.

OK. This didn't work for me at all. :( The flavor was out of this world PHENOMENOL, but our meatloaf cups were SUPER m-u-s-h-y (and I mean MUSHY!)!!! Having said this, I think I am to fault for that. I didn't use extra-lean turkey (oops!) and *may* have over processed my veggies (they were quite juicy lol!). Besides the obvious, I am curious as to whether I should have added the meatloaf mixture ingredients to my bowl in the SAME order as  in the AR video (hmmmm....). Instead, I dumped everything BUT the veggies into my mixing bowl, THEN added the veggies, combined and proceeded as directed. My couscous was REALLY soft and the mixture seemed VERY wet. Yes, I could be splitting hairs here, but I really do think this made a difference. Because my hubs and I loved these so much, I'm not giving up yet. I'll just be more careful next time! Mashed sweet potatoes and buttered corn rounded out our simple meal. Thanks for sharing your unique recipe, Amy! Getting kiddos (and some adults haha) to eat ANYTHING but burgers and fries is a miracle, let alone a full day's serving of veggies in one fell swoop. :-)

What a great idea! Little Cups!! My mom just got out of the hospital after having a heart attack. Her sodium intake is severely limited, and I was looking for easy, healthy options. I make a turkey meatloaf which I found on Food Network, so I modified this a bit for my mom's diet:

I deleted the red pepper and dijon mustard, and added shredded carrots, fine diced celery, coupla cloves of minced garlic and mushrooms. 

I make my own BBQ sauce [ketchup, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire], which has only the sodium from the ketchup (as opposed to 500mg +/- per serving of prepared BBQ sauce).

Would give this recipe a 5, if I made it as-is, but I messed with it, so am giving 4 stars.

holy wonderfulness!!!!  i made a few minor subs (A1 for worcestershire and breadcrumbs for couscous, also added celery) but otherwise was pretty close to the recipe.  it was divine.  a very moist meatloaf but it still held together well.  my kids loved it and i was ecstatic that they unknowingly ate about 3 cups or so of veggies and ASKED FOR SECONDS!  i think when anything comes out of the oven in a cupcake pan they've already decided its good :)  thanks!

We liked this very much.  I used to have a similar recipe for a Turkey/Zucchini Meatloaf  but this one is much better.  I like the idea of the muffins, much better than a loaf however, my muffin tins must be bigger and I only yielded 11 muffins, which was plenty.  I didn't have any  couscous so subbed fresh bread crumbs, I also used the Absolutely Awesome BBQ sauce from this site.

Love this! The texture is great and it stayed really moist. I added red pepper flakes to the mix (a few Tbsp, didn't measure) and changed the sauce on top cuz I don't like BBQ sauce (I used a mix of tomato paste, mustard, brown sugar, and more pepper flakes). I also cooked them as mini loaves instead of in cups, but that's just because the mini loaf pan is easier to clean! Baked them for 45 minutes and they were perfectly done (VERY full loaves, less time if they're smaller).

These were really good! I liked the idea of adding veggies to them to make them a little healthier :) We did not do the BBQ sauce either, we used a little ketchup instead. My got about 12 muffin sized meatloafs from the mixture but my husband didnt measure the veggies. I think next time I  will cook them a little longer so they can get a little more browned. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe! I didn't have the red bell peppers. So instead I added a small stalk of celery, thyme, basil, & sage. It was so yummy!

I just recieved this recipe in my email this morning and it sounded so delicious, I had to make them for dinner tonight and they are great! I had 1 muffin tray with the barbque sauce topping and 1 tray with our traditional meatloaf topping (which is ketchup and sugar to taste) and I preffered our topping, but they were fabulous either way. Thanks for the great idea!

These were good, but needed some modification in my opinion. First, there was way too much of the veggie mixture. I only used about half of it. And I still had an issue getting them to stay together. I think with some tweaking, these could be quite good and a healthy option. Will probably continue to play with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this, I didn't like it but I don't remember why.  Last night it was juicy and tasty.  I did make a few changes this time, only because of what I had on hand
I did not have couscous, used breadcrumbs.  Don't own a food processor, so skipped that step.  Doubled the mustard.  Devoured by all, no left-overs.  I am glad I tried it again.

Grandslam with this one Amy! Everyone in my family loved it! I will make add this recipe to the roundup! Only thing I might do differently next time is to make it in one loaf instead of mini cups, I like to keep the dishes to a minimum! Other than that I highly recommend to all. TY

Quite tasty. I didn't have onions, so I substituted in mushrooms. I used Stobbs original barbecue sauce and seasoned ground turkey. I added a little bit of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Served with boiled potatoes. Cooking time was perfect. Very easy to make and an easy meal to freeze or take to work for lunch.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it several times with and they have turned out great. I grated the veggies instead of putting them in the food processor which helped keep any liquid out. I also beat the egg before adding to the mixture so I wasn't stirring the turkey too much. Since its a lighter meat that can make it too soft. I also substituted the couscous for oatmeal. Makes it a little healthier and it helped bind the meat wonderfully. I will be making this again very soon!

This was very good.  I followed the directions other than making it into a bread pan meatloaf.  I also minced up my veggies rather than using a food processor- I liked the crunch it provided.  Overall, it was a little dry and flaky.  The flavor was great but it may need another egg or some type of fluid to help hold it together a little more.  Will make again.

Really good! I followed most of the recipe, I added some chopped baby spinach, fresh parsley, and garlic to the meat mixture. I also made a a quick marinara sauce and added a couple of tbls to the turkey and topped each "muffin" with sauce too. I had one sweet potato that needed to be used so I mashed it up and piped on top of muffins. These are super tasty...great for a snack. If you dont have couscous just add whole wheat bread crumbs.

Made these tonight and even burned them a little on the edges, will cook at a little bit lower temp next time.  Turkey hating husband ate two, and zucchini hating child also ate two! Great recipe will definently make again.  Did add 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp tumeric, salt and pepper and added some chopped garlic to the veggie blend.

Yummy! My kids wont eat zucchini, so I substituted the zucchini for 2 grated carrots and 1 cup of chopped fresh spinach. I also added a pinch of salt and 1 clove of garlic (minced)-  It turned out perfectly. Will definitely be making these again soon.

Great recipe and I loved making it in a cupcake pan! Great for portion control and it's perfect for my kids. I added two large cloves of garlic and some seasoning salt, subbed in chopped carrots instead of the sweet pepper (I didn't have peppers on hand). Turned out delicious, fast and nutritious.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were ok, but nothing fabulous. They could be great with some tweaking though and I'll probably use as a base recipe in the future.

They are healthy and that's GREAT...and bland. I added 1 Tbsp garlic powder, salt, pepper & 4 large garlic cloves...still bland. Fill muffin tins up, not 3/4, they don't rise. Won't make again.

 Try Turkey and Quinoa meatloaf this site by Drew. CRAZY GOOD!!!!!!

I thought these tasted great! They are a nice change to regular plain ole' meatloaf and we all like lean ground turkey so this worked out perfectly. What I really like about this recipe is that it incorporates both turkey meat and vegetables in one. I used a medley of red, orange, yellow, green bell peppers. I also grated the zucchini and (finely)chopped half a red onion. I deviated a little from the recipe in that I added the BBQ sauce to the meat mixture instead of on top. I also added 1T Whorchestershire sauce, 1T Dijon, 1 garlic clove, Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper to the meat. I sprayed each cupcake tin with PAM Olive Oil and filled each cupcake tins with the meat. I baked 14 "cupcake" size meatloafs. The meatloaves took 15 minutes to bake at 400 degrees. I let the meatloaves cool before taking them out of the tins. These are petite, cute and tasty. They are eye appealing with the colorful bits of peppers and veggies show casing in the meatloaf cups (see my picture in the gallery). For a little fun, I piped the top of the meatloaves with, "Garlic-Chive Mashed Potatoes, " and "Mashed Sweet Potatoes," also from this website. Thou there were veggies in the meatloaves, I also served, "Quick and Easy Sauteed Spinach," as a side dish, also from this website. This meatloaf was not only delicious but a great way to get nutrition in too!

Delicious! I used 1/3 cup quinoa cooked in veggie broth but the mixture was still too watery so I added another 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I also added a jalapeño and some ketchup. I used a ice cream scooper to get even sized portions and then like other reviewers suggested, I used the scooper to put the rest of the mixture on parchment paper and froze them.

These were edible, but just.  They looked absolutely nothing like the picture.  They barely held together and only the addition of ketchup on top made them marginally tasty.

Great meal! I used carrots and rice instead of red pepper and couscous. Next time, I would omit rice and use bread crumbs instead-while the rice seemed to work for others, it came out uncooked in the finished product for me. While it gave the loaf a different texture, it was not the best.

This was amazing! I followed the directions to the letter and it turned out great! I was initially concerned the mixture would be too wet (because of the vegetable content) but the consistency was perfect once baked and it was still moist when I reheated some of the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I give my variation of this recipe 5-stars, but the original 4. Add in a tablespoon of minced garlic, salt and pepper and it's there. Don't skimp on the BBQ sauce! It adds so much important flavor. 

I make a batch of these every other Sunday and freeze them. Take 2 out and put them in the fridge for lunch the next day....they honestly taste better after they've been reheated! I've been eating these for lunch every day for about 3 months and will continue to do so. Great, guilt-free recipe!

I've been searching for better tasting "healthy" food and this one is a keeper.   It's a great low-calorie hybrid between the all-meat loaf and something like a boca burger.  In fact, after making these, I think next time I'll form them like hamburger patties and try baking them that way.   You can vary the sauce topping to your liking.   I tried something different on each "row" in the pan.   I did a row with BBQ sauce, one with ketchup, one with plum sauce and one with a sweet ginger sauce.      Fun to test your favorites, but again, I will try making them next time with NO sauce in patty shapes and then adding what I want on after they are cooked.    Important to only PULSE the food processor so you have control and avoid the liquid stage of the veggies.   The only addition I made was adding a Tbsp of minced garlic and 1/2 tsp salt.   I could tell by the lack of seasonings in the recipe that I would want to add something.     GREAT recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. I grate carrots instead of using zucchini and I fill the muffins cups to the absolute top but besides that I follow the recipe exactly. This is the perfect meatloaf, not greasy at all.

Love this!!!  I swear I bought dijon mustard at the store but couldn't find it when I made the recipe!!!  Used French's spicy brown mustard instead and 1.5c of cooked quinoa in place of couscous.  These are awesome!  Will definitely make these frequently.  My kids wouldn't eat them which usually upsets me but this time I was (selfishly) happy!

This is a very healthy recipe. I served it with Summer Cold Corn Salad. Went together real well. The Corn Salad recipe is on this site too. Overall very good dish and best is, eat all you want because the calories are low and the protein is high.

LOVE this.  It was a hit with my husband, 7 yr old and even my 11 month old.  The 7 yr old didn't even realize she was eating a bunch of veggies.  Just a word of caution - use fresh onion.  I used pre-chopped frozen and it got a bit soupy once they defrosted so I couldn't make it into meatloaf cups so I just put it in a 13x9 baking dish and cooked it like regular meatloaf. It still came out great and leftovers were great too.  Definitely making this again, probably very soon!

This is such a delicious recipe! I didn't have zucchini so I fine shredded a big ol' carrot, and also 2 bread slices worth of crumbs. Mixed in about 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. Everyone loved it!

I made this as a loaf. I took the advice of other raters and added more seasonings extra mustard and Worcestershire sauce I also used carrots and half of a green and half of a red pepper. I used breadcrumbs in place of the couscous, next time I'll try panko. This recipe has potential, I suggest being creative with spices and the topping (I mixed bbq ketchup and cayenne pepper) to make a really tasty meatloaf!

I made this tonight and love it!!! I never would have thought this up, its genius. I didn't have couscous on hand so I used instant brown rice. Also the mix did come out very wet so I added 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs and 3 slices whole wheat bread. I did add s&p. Definately will keep this recipe as a regular. Great job Amy!!

I loved this and so did my husband!  The only thing I changed was replacing the couscous with a half a cup of panko bread crumbs.  I'm following weight watchers and each "muffin" is only 2 points plus!  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good. I had some issues with consistency (followed recipe exact) and had to cook it a little longer (in a very new oven), but I will make again! I think I might try to add more red peppers flakes, scallions, etc., as it is a tiny bit bland. Very good idea to make in mini cups, and a great, healthy alternative to ground beef!

After not quite deciding how I felt about this recipe...even after eating 3 "meatloaf muffins," I'm going to agree with my fellow reviewers on the following points: They were too mushy and they look kind of unappetizing which was a turn-off; the flavor is definitely coming from the barbeque sauce, so add in that salt & pepper and garlic!; using bread crumbs instead of couscous may help to solidify them a bit and give them that "meatloaf texture"; and most importantly, do NOT liquefy your veggies or use the full amount called for! Whew....that was alot. I feel like the recipe is onto something good here, but I would not use this recipe AS IS again.

I didn't have zucchini, so I just left that out.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. I think the couscous taste was overpowering and maybe not cooked enough.  Next time I might just use bread crumbs.  I think this can be a really good recipe for us, just needs to be tweaked

these were tasty, but they were mushy and barely held together...next time I might add only 1 cup of zucchini....maybe add 1/2 lb of lean ground beef...the kids liked the BBQ, but hubby wanted a sauce that was a little more tomato-y...might play around with this one..as is it's just okay..

I adored this recipe!! I made it for my young toddler (13 mos) who was only so-so with it, that was mostly from a textural point of view.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except for these things:
I added garlic (as others suggested). 
I used quinoa which I pre-cooked in the microwave because it's healthier, and it did not effect the constitution of the meatloaf at all!
I hand-shredded the veggies because I didn't have a food processor, and that was fine (less dish-washing, too)!
I didn't use any BBQ because I don't like it, and I don't think my daughter needed it to enjoy the meal. 

As an adult, I ended up dipping my muffins in a little soy sauce and thought it was perfect like that because I like a little saltiness, but for a child or anyone less salt-dependent they are perfect as they are!! Wonderful, healthy, full of flavor...awesome.

One recommendation: if you're doing this, simply make double or triple, depending on your family!! The adults will love this as much as the kids will, so make a lot. Some other people mentioned freezing some of it, see their reviews on how they did it, because once your first batch of muffins disappears, you won't be sorry you made extra!!

I will make it again it is Very good.  (I couldn't find the chopper piece for my food processor so I just used the shredder and it was fine.  I also used a mini loaf pan instead of muffin pan - just cooked a bit longer and lowered the temp to 350 half way through)  The picture doesn't do it justice.  Yum.

I thought the muffins were very dry - I only had one 12 muffin tin and put the rest in a loaf pan.  The loaf pan part was much better.  The muffins were fairly tasteless because of their dryness.

I really enjoyed this, with some modifications. I'm surprised no one has mentioned veggie overload with this recipe. I prepped the amount of onion, red pepper and zucchini indicated in the recipe, but as I was adding it to the turkey I felt like the full amount would be overkill, so I only ended up adding just over half off the veggies, which I had processed to a salsa-like (but not watery) consistency. This turned out to be the right call, for me anyway. Otherwise the veggies would have overpowered the turkey. I also added salt and pepper since I can't imagine making any recipe without it, and a dash more Worcestershire. I really enjoyed the bbq sauce topping and ended up spreading a litte more on the bottoms when serving. My boyfriend actually LOVED these, even more than I did and requested that I PLEASE make them again. I also needed to cook them for 30 minutes to give them a nice brownish appearance on top, but they were still nice and moist.

Sorry.  This was the first meal I made that we could not even eat.  I think I did process the veggies a little long, but even so - tasteless and odd texture.  I am obviously in the minority here.

These were good.  I probably would of preferred just to make them like regular mini meatloaves or one big one.  The flavor was a little bland on these.  I did add in some garlic and added herbs.  I had to add in extra breadcrumbs since chopping the veggies in a food processor made more liquid come out of them.  I think this mixture would be good to make large meatballs out of them and served with a nice chunky ragu over pasta.  I will make again trying them as meatballs!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm still trying to figure out why these got so many great reviews.  They are very healthy and easy.  Great way to get extra veggies.  The flavor was just ok.  I won't these again.  My 5 year old wouldn't eat hers- my 1 year old actually ate about a half of one.  Hubs ate a couple but sure didn't enjoy it.  I had leftovers in the fridge for 5 days!  I eventually ate the rest- tolerable but not great.  Something is missing.  The flavor is just not quite right.  I had high hopes since these are so diet friendly.

Tried these for dinner tonight, what a healthy and yummy option! I left them in the oven a little longer and didn't have any problems with them being mushy.

These were nice and moist, but the flavour seemed a bit off to me.  I found the red pepper overpowered everything, I might try it again without the pepper.

Great meal and EASY to make!  I followed the receipe ALMOST as listed except substituting the couscous with italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  My picky eater hubby loved it and asked to include it in my dinner menu rotation. I served it with a hearty salad with italian dressing, feta cheese, shreaded carrots and tomatoes.  Very yummy! Thanks!

I've made these several times and they're awesome!  I usually omit the red bell pepper because I never seem to have one on hand, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  I have tried it with lean ground beef, but I definitely prefer it with 99% lean ground turkey.  Thanks for sharing!

So yummy and I loved all the veggies they had in them.  Very moist too.  I put chipoltle bbq sauce on top and it added just the right amount of spice.  Just me and my fiance so I was able to freeze some too!

I'm giving this three stars because the recipe works and there's nothing wrong with it, but I found it just "eh." I'm not a fan of meatloaf and this one was...well, just another meatloaf. Okay I upped it to four because I liked the inclusion of veggies. :)

I cannot believe how awesome this recipe is!  They were so delicious and easy to make!  The only thing I did different was I added, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  My husband and I had the parents over for dinner.  My dad who only likes beef loved these.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great, easy, fun dinner! :) My husband loved it and asked that we have it again. I followed the recipe, but used 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 a red pepper. I also used 3 tbsp of onion flakes instead of real onion due to personal taste. While they were great, they were a little bland. Next time I will add salt, pepper and garlic. The BBQ sauce slightly burned the edges of the "muffins" so I would recommend putting the BBQ sauce on near the end of cooking time.

This was awesome and so easy to make!  I did add more a tablespoon more cous cous and some breadcrumbs so to cut down on the water from the veggies. I don't have a food processor so I chopped everything as good as I could and caramelized the onions before adding everything and you gotta use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ...this was a winner!

Although I don't think these tasted much like meatloaf, they were easy and fun to make. Next time I'll do what others have suggested and add more spices. Thanks!

THIS WAS AMAZING.  MOIST AND VERY FLAVORFUL.  MAKES A GREAT DINNER WITH FRESH FRUIT.  THE ONLY THING I ADDED WAS 1 GARLIC CLOVE AND 1/2 TSP. SALT AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT.  IT IS ALSO SO GOOD FOR YOU.  TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT.

Really tasty! I added more zucchini than called for and grated three medium carrots. I also sauteed the onion until soft, then added about 4 cloves of garlic, some thyme and the carrot to the pan for a minute or two. To offset extra moisture from the veggies, I added a couple tablespoons more couscous. The ratio of veggies and couscous to meat ended up being about 2 to 1. I used about a teaspoon of Bullseye barbecue sauce on each muffin, which reduced the total amount of BBQ sauce to about a 1/2 cup. With these changes, it made 24 muffins, each about 72 calories. Pretty healthy for such a tasty dish! We'll be adding this to our regular rotation. Next time, I am going to reduce the red pepper and substitute sauteed mushrooms. Yum!

I was very surprised at how amazing these turned out!! I usually make a pan meatloaf with ground beef, but this is my new favorite go-to recipe especially since we've been trying to watch our calorie intake. We had leftovers for breakfast this morning and they heated up very well and was still very moist!  I did as other suggested and did a half a batch with bbq sauce and the other half with a ketchup, brown sugar, worchestire mixture. The only other change outside of that was that I added a little bit of salt & pepper, two cloves of garlic, and italian herb seasoning.. You must try this recipe!

Unique, easy, healthy and delicious! My only critique is that they could use some more spice and I added fresh chopped garlic to the veggie blend. Will make again, thank you!

I really love this recipe.  Made a few minor changes - omitted the egg replaced with egg whites and reduced the amount of couscous.  
I have always made these in a regular sized cupcake tin and have never gotten more than 9 or so.  Your recipe yields 20!!  Is that with a mini tin?

Very easily adaptable, and yet still so good! I subbed shredded carrots for zucchini, corn for red bell pepper, and uncooked quinoa for the couscous. Add garlic for extra depth in flavor.  Super quick and easy to make, and adjustable to your supply on hand!

I need to work on the recipe for flavor, texture was good.  I added carrots and eliminated peppers, but I need something else...maybe some salt...I’ll try again, it will be a hit in the end I’m thinking.

I've made this recipe as it is written and substituting quinoa for couscous. I prefer the quinoa. The recipe as written is a 4 overall for taste and ease. I like that you can freeze individual portions which thaw nicely for a plate or sandwich. The meatloaf is moist and not dense and heavy. I used a Carolina BBQ sauce which is a little lighter and compliments the turkey well. I'm not a meatloaf fan, but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this recipe both as written and with my substitution. (I only substituted quinoa because I was out of couscous. Cook it prior to adding to meat mixture.) I really like the original and my version.

I made this using quinoa and we all enjoyed it.  It wouldn't be my first choice for a meatloaf, but considering how healthy/diet friendly it is, it was very tasty!  There's room to adjust seasonings according to personal preference.  I will definitely be making this again.

I love turkey muffins. I used cooked quinoa and took a lot of tips from other turkey meatloaf recipes I liked - such as more garlic, more worchestershire sauce, hot sauce, and a little tomato paste. I took Kate's idea and added carrots!...added great flavor! I also didnt put my veggies through a processor as I dont own one, but i think the texture was better this way.

I used cranberry chutney instead of barbecue sauce. I needed salt which I added later after baking. Yum.

Bland. I noted that no seasoning (salt/pepper) was mentioned. You must season. I used Lucille's Original BBQ sauce, and the sauce was not enough to compensate for the interior components, especially as I tasted some bitter notes from the zucchini. For those looking for a meatloaf recipe, I suggest checking out the Brown Sugar Meatloaf, also from this site. I've used turkey for that recipe just fine.

Easy recipe and very healthy. I needed to add some salt and more BBQ sauce than called for. My kids did not like these, however. They aren't picky eaters but maybe it was the texture of everything mixed together. They wouldn't even eat them lathered in ketchup.

Decided to make this today. We all really liked it.  I got nervous about the time & temp & ended up over cooking them.
I took out the 2nd tray at 25 mins thinking I'd nuke them if needed.  Didn't need to.  The other tray, burned on the bottom & dry, I salvaged by giving them a shot of chicken broth.in the tray.  Excellent.  Follow the recipe.  There's always a recovery.

Tried this recipe as we love ground turkey so always looking for new recipes to eat healthy. This was a big hit, Doubled recipe,and followed recipe pretty much as written, I used whole wheat couscous, and added fresh minced garlic and parsley (as we Love it),salt & pepper, made big round balls and did not overwork mixture, I make my own BBQ sauce so did half with BBQ sauce and left rest plain and made sweet and sour sauce,, Delish,my 3 grandkids ages 11,8,3 Loved them, big hit in packed lunches too, as everything in the meatloaf ball,I served with twice baked potatoes and sauteed fresh green beans. Definitely a keeper.

I was distracted during the last few minutes of cooking and they went to about 169 degrees Fahrenheit. However, they were still delicious. I like how light they are. I feel like if I pulled them out at 160 they would be one of the best dishes I have ever made. Not very pretty but I'm not worried about that with my family. I made a mixture of ketchup, brown sugar, a dash of bbq sauce, red pepper flakes and franks red hot for the top.

Great recipe I already have ideas for the next time we make it!  Fiancée has stomach pains from bell pepper so I replaced that with grated carrots and a few other spices and a tad extra worcestershire sauce.  Very tasty already but feel there is room for improvement.

Everyone in our family loved this - even my picky 18 year old sister.  We'll definitely be making this again - we used Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce and it was the perfect compliment.  We accidentally pureed the veggies, and it was still amazing.

I thought this was going to be bland, but it's not.   Added half a teaspoon garlic powder, the only change I made.   Only 65 calories per meatloaf cup before adding the BBQ sauce.   Even my kids loved it.

Great recipe. Diced the veggies by hand and they were fine. Fill cups to a nice mound as they do not rise. The BBQ sauce is essential, and I I will add more heat next time because my audience likes a bit more pop. These were perfect for microwave lunches through the week.

I gave this a 4 because as it's written,  I think it would have been too bland. But i added a red and orange pepper and no onion or zuchinni bc it's what I had on hand. I LOVE that the turkey wasn't soaked in grease like beef meatloaf.  I don't think I'll ever go back. Plenty moist and flavorful.  I added salt and pepper and other seasonings and a teaspoon of garlic.  We loved it this way. Great base recipe though, And couscous! Who would have thought?! It was a great addition.

Definitely enjoyed this recipe. I have also used this as a burger recipe. They are a little tricky to cook on the grill.  I cooked them halfway on foil then directly over the flame.

When I was putting it together I thought it looked too healthy, and there was no way it would taste good. I was already thinking about a plan B for dinner, but it turned out delicious! I was really impressed. And I paired it with mashed cauliflower (instead of mashed potatoes) and peas. I was not only healthy but really good!

These smelled wonderful.  I made them exactly as described in the recipe.  They were good, but I agree with others that they need a bit more seasoning. Next time instead of using regular bbq, I will use honey chipotle and maybe a dash of mustard in the meat itself for some zing.  Otherwise, good alternative (upon occasion) to regular meatloaf.  Thanks!

And the sauce changes where:
- BBQ sauce
- hot sauce 
- ketchup 
- splash of water

This recipe is easy to make and was generally well received at the dinner table. I found it to be a bit bland and would suggest adding a bit more spice of your liking to the recipe. I didn't have BBQ sauce in the house when I made it so I substituted italian dressing which worked out pretty well.

Made these last night and they were a hit!  Even my picky 10 year old devoured it.  I really wanted to make it with couscous but my local market did not carry it so instead I bought Italian breadcrumbs which worked out great.  I used the regular cupcake tins and was able to make 16.  I topped 12 with bbq sauce and left 4 without. Both were delicious.  I added garlic salt and pepper because we love our food with flavor. Had my 10 year old help me put them together in the muffin tins, which she loved doing.  I took them out of the oven and let them sit for 5 mins like the recipe stated and they were perfect. Paired them with a side of greens and it was a great low fat delicious meal.  Next time I will try them with couscous and add red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Thank you for a great easy recipe!

We LOVED this recipe! I didn't have the veggies the recipe called for, so I substituted kale, carrots, jalapenos, and broccoli instead. Couscous cooked perfectly, couldn't tell it was there. Very healthy and tasty alternative. Will make again and again!

It was AWFUL. Very bland and the consistency was not good. It was kind of spongy.  I'm not usually super critical. I followed the recipe to a T. In the recipe's defense, we usually try/eat gourmet recipes. Maybe this was just too "everyday" for our palates. (Sorry..not trying to be mean.)

FANTASTIC!!!  The only reason I am not giving the recipe 5 stars is because it did need some extra spices.  I followed the recipes exactly but added 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt and few shakes black pepper.  Without those additions I think they would have been bland, with the additions they were delicious.  For the BBQ sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray, I think that is the name.  You don't need much.  Too much and it is overwhelming.  I baked them for 27 minutes.
I will make these over and over again!!

I was kind of worried how this recipe would turn out, due to the diversity of reviews (e.g., "this was great with such and such changes", and "this was terrible! no flavor!"). I mostly followed the recipe. I did use less veggies: 1 zucchini, 1/2 of a GIANT yellow onion, 1 green bell pepper (I don't like red bells), added 2 cloves of minced garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe, and made sure to let it sit for 15+ minutes once all the ingredients were added, so that the couscous wouldn't be crunchy (as per another reviewer's advice). I don't like BBQ sauce or ketchup, so I topped each one with some 30-minute bottled teriyaki marinade. I cooked for 20 minutes on ~370 degrees, but my oven runs very hot so it probably evened out to about 400. It made 19 "meatloaf muffins", and they are SO good! I tested almost half of them with the meat thermometer, as I am paranoid about food safety, and they were well over 165 degrees, but so moist and good! I definitely would like to make these again--a real keeper!!! thanks very much to all the reviewers!

Good - needs a little work. I've made these several times now and think I have the fixes: Use 2 eggs, 2 lb turkey, up the condiments, definitely add salt, pepper and garlic. Two more pieces of advice, drain the veggies and mix the couscous in with the eggs, condiments and spices until saturated, then add turkey and veggies. Whole family loves them now, even better the next day!

I think every meat/veggie dish needs salt and pepper to taste, and this needs salt and black pepper to make it 5 stars.

I substituted Quinoa for the Couscous and mixed the BBQ sauce in, instead of on. But either way, you'll like this recipe.

I'm trying to figure out how the reviews on this dish were so positive.  I do a lot of cooking and I was excited about this one.  It looked healthy and easy and boy was I disappointed.  My kids are great eaters and always excited about any new dish that I make.  They too were very disappointed.  I thought it was easy to prepare but very bland.  fyi.....I made no changes to this recipe.

I, too, used a food processor to finely chop, but not puree, the veggies. I then strained them in a mesh strainer for about 2 minutes to get rid of some of the extra liquid, as they were a bit mushy the first time. Adding some seasoning salt and pepper also helped give it a little more flavor. And now my kids are eating these as if they were the best thing they have ever tasted. Thanks for such a great recipe!

We just loved this. I added mushrooms to the shredded veggies and cooked it on the bbq in larger sized muffin tins. It made 12 exactly.  I checked it with a meat thermometer to make sure they were done. I will make this again.

Made it as-is. Tried 2 different kinds of BBQ. The veggies kept the consistency pretty wet, mushy. We didn't like this at all.

I used all these ingredients but because I don't have a food processor, I had to use my magic bullet which ended up making the mix a bit too liquid so I added a 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and some black pepper for extra flavor and I left the bbq sauce for after they were cooked so I could use it as a dipping sauce and it was really good.

This was a HUGE hit with my family. Even the kids wanted more. My daughter asked for me to give this to her for lunch the next day for school. I followed the recipe as stated except that I used Quinoa and some breadcrumbs instead of couscous (cost factor only). I also did not top with BBQ sauce, but instead used turkey gravy. The loaves came out moist, firm and flavorful. Served with Perogies and broccoli, it was perfect. I used the muffin pan and sprayed liberally with Canola oil. The meatloaf's came out easily, and cleanup was a breeze. It was unanimously decided to be a keeper recipe!

This is a nice twist on meatloaf with the vegetables and cous cous as filler. It went great with baked sweet potatoes. You can easily personalize it with any sauce and spice combo of your choice (could have used a little more flavor). If you don't love onion use half or less. I put in more peppers because we had extra and that was a good subsitute for the onion. It was quick to make because of the smaller version in the muffin cup. Enjoyed it!

I love this recipe! It is so delicious. As someone previously mentioned I put the meatloaf cups in baked soft flour tortillas (a really nice combination). I've made them a couple times now. First time I forgot the bbq sauce and it still was delicious. They are a bit messy and time consuming to make (my opinion - an hour of cooking is time consuming) but well worth it!  Thank you.

I was very hesitant to try this recipe out. I guess I have a fear of zucchini because I kept coming up with excuses not to put the zucchini in. I made a few adjustments and it was AWESOME and I may never make regular meatloaf again. This is so much more flavorful! Here's what I did:
reduced onion to 3/4 cup,
reduced zucchini to 1 cup,
rice instead of couscous,
added 1 diced tomato,
added garlic,
added 3/4 cup or so ketchup (I just squirted the bottle over the bowl until it looked good--that's what I always do!),
green bell pepper instead of red. 

I loved it! And I got a serving of vegetables in two cups! You don't have to use the muffin tin, but it cooked up a lot faster than just making it into a loaf so it was worth it.

LOVED IT!

I can't say that this was great.  It did smell amazing while it was baking though.  The major flaw in the recipe is lack of seasoning.  It definitely needs salt and pepper, if not something like a little chili powder or Cayenne pepper.  It was really bland.  My major fault in this is that I used white meat ground turkey.  Definitely use dark meat, or less lean (don't use extra lean) because it's REALLY dry as is.  With a few modifications, this could easily be a 4 1/2 star recipe.  I hate when people rate recipes as a 5 after their modifications- it's misleading.  I also think that this  would actually work with something like a Boca burger.

Just tried this for dinner and it was awesome! A  small tweak as we like our spices I added a pinch of chili flakes and a clove of minced garlic and used a mini loaf pan as opposed to muffin cups and made these "dinner size" served with a side salad it was a super easy Monday night meal.

Well, I didn't follow the recipe exactly and but it was AMAZING. I added way less veggies and omitted the zucchini. I added about an extra 1/4 a cup of couscous as well. I used Colman's Dry English Mustard instead of dijon. I also put them in my popover pan, I made 6 larger ones. So I put them in 400 for 25 minutes. If I make them again, I will put them for a little less and let them rest. They weren't very dry, but they could have been moister. I didn't find them wet or soggy at all. I also used a mixture of worcestershire sauce and ketchup on the top and made some extra for dipping. As someone suggested I served with pierogies and veggies...Will def make it again!

Kicking myself for not reading the reviews first or thinking to add garlic.  I thought the Worcestershire sauce and dijon would add enough flavour though.  They were much too bland for my liking so next time I'd definitely change it up some.  Letting them stand before removing from the muffin tin is also key to prevent crumbling.  I like this concept of all the veggies mixed in and the individual little loaves though.

I really enjoyed these! very fresh tasting with the vegetables, the bar-b-que sauce was a must for me to add flavour. My husband doesn't like turkey so I make a batch of these and freeze them. then just take out a couple and throw in the microwave. A great lunch!

This was better than I expected.  I might substitute something else for zucchini next time since that made it a little soggy, but it tasted good.  My family liked it over a simple green salad.  The BBQ sauce is key, don't skimp.

This was a huge hit with my husband who is very resistant to replacing his red meat with turkey.  He loved it and so did my four and five year olds!  It didn't last very long--next time I will make a double batch and freeze some.

Very delicious!  I added coarsely chopped summer squash and cut the zucchini in half.  Also instead of the couscous I used crumbled veggie ritz crackers about 2 sleeves.  I have a milk allergy and can't use the bread crumbs or couscous.

These were delicious!  A great alternative to the traditional meatloaf recipes, and much healthier!  The only change I would make next time is adding a little garlic and less onion.  1 1/2 cups is an aweful lot of onion for a small amount of turkey. Overall this was really great, even my picky 7 year old loved it!

We liked these a lot more than we expected to. Our family is on a "trying new things" kick, and this was one that was a hit.  I cooked up some jumbo shell noodles & put the cooked meatballs into them making it more fun to eat (finger food for the kids!). I made the left overs into a sandwich for my husband the next day.

My fiance and I were both extremely happy with this recipe!!  We made several variations as we wanted to use what we had on hand... we ommitted the red bell pepper and use a handful of peppercini's, used regular mustard, and about 1C bread crumbs as we didn't have couscous on hand.  We also addded a little garlic salt and some freshly ground pepper... it was superb!!!  We also did as one other reviewer suggested and froze the remaining mixture after filling 12 muffin cups.  Now we have a meal on hand and ready to go!  You can't beat it!!

lacked a bit of flavor.  Maybe a bit more Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce.

I made these the other night because I LOVE turkey, onions, garlic, bbq, and meatballs!  They were fantastic!  What a great idea to do them in the muffin tins...so easy.  I will definitely be making these again.  Just make sure to not over cook them because the turkey will get dry.

This was an awful recipe...I had to add almost 15 minutes on to the cooking time, and I made 30 cupcake sized portions. The veggie portions are much much much too large for the amount of turkey. I would honestly probably not make this again...it was pretty terrible :-(

Was a lot easier to make than I was thinking. Next time I will use less onion. I was iffy about the barbecue sauce so I only put on half but next time I will put on all, it went great with the meatloaf.

I didn't have everything the recipe called for (zucchini, bell pepper and couscous) so I substituted as needed. I did onion and diced tomatoes with bread crumbs and the result was fantastic!!! My 2 year old is devouring his and I have eaten 3 already!! I highly recommend this recipe and can't wait to cook it again. Its so easy and so quick. :-) Thank you!!

These are nicely portioned, delicious and nutritious! I made these last night, and my young kids gobbled them up (not knowing how much veggies were in it, LOL)! Great all-in-one kid-friendly dish: vegs, grains, and lean meat protein. I used organic whole wheat couscous and it turned out great! Also, I used ketchup instead of BBQ sauce b/c that's what my kids prefer. I also like that you can substitute your veggie of choice- I used yellow squash instead of onions. This will become a regular at my house.

Great recipe! I am always trying to find great ways to make meals healthy, and this did it. My daughter loved them and asked for more. I did use more ground turkey since there was 1lb 8oz in my pkg. But other than the extra turkey, i made it accordingly and it was just perfect. I made 6 muffins with a silicone 6 muffin pan so I didn't have to spray it-we were hungry and didn't want to wait!  I made the rest into a sprayed pyrex loaf dish and baked for 45mins (my gas oven). We will definitely make these again!

These are so moist and flavorful.  Due to personal preference I made a few changes.  I used 2 lbs of ground chicken instead of turkey.  I used cooked quinoa instead of couscous.  I can't wait to make these again.  I got my meatloaf fix and didn't crash my healthy eating lifestyle.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I followed the other people advice and added salt and pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. I wish I'd added a little more salt. I did about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. I should have at least tried 1/2 tsp. Make sure you grease the pans well. My husband HATES meatloaf and he also hates,  ground turkey "healthy" style things, but he actually thought these were pretty good. I don't have a food processor so I just finely chopped the veggies and I actually quite liked having a them a little chunkier. These are a great sack lunch option :)

I thought these were okay, and my husband liked them also.  2/3 of our children did not like them at all.  I think my husband's words were "we like meatloaf, but trying to disguise this mostly-veggie dish isn't going to pass."  Calling them "Dinner cupcakes" probably didn't help either.   It sure looked yummy in the picture though.

Absolutely delicious! I added some garlic powder to the turkey mixture. Also, I added 2 Tbsp of brown sugar and a dash of liquid smoke to the BBQ topping.

This is an easy and delicious twist on turkey meatloaf wich I am always looking for new ways to make.  I used yellow squash instead of zuchinni b/c the grocery store was out if zucchini.  Next time I will cut down on the worcester sauce b/c it was just a bit too spicy.   I highly recommend!

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  My biggest complaint is that it doesn't look appetizing.  I took it to a potluck and almost no one touched it.  I got a lot of "What is in it?"  I called it a Turkey meatloaf with vegetables but still, no one touched it (even though it tasted pretty good).  Ouch!  The texture was also very mushy even though I cooked it thoroughly and it reached 180 degrees.  I would make this for family, but as far as "public" food goes, make something where you can actually SEE what's in it.

These were very good!  I made them for a large family dinner and since we were on vacation there was no food processor.  I just chopped all the vegetables finely and I thought it turned out great, though the kids may have been more enthused if they couldn't have seen the vegetables as well.

These are really, really good.  Very moist and flavourful.  I didn't leave my vegetables coarsely chopped but blended them well and used Roasted Garlic Couscous.  A great way to hide veggies!

These are really good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for putting ketchup on half of them instead of bbq sauce.  We preferred the ones with ketchup.  Really healthy, light meal.  I'm planning to freeze some to have for a quick meal.

Very good. I used cooked quinoa in place of couscous. It was a very moist, next time I won't cook the quinoa completely.  Froze very well!

These are delicious and so easy. I have to admit, I was shocked at how good they were. The only change I made was to add a little honey to the BBQ sauce for the top of the cups. This is now my go to recipe for turkey meatloaf.

I baked this last week, and used squash instead because the grocery story was out of zuchinni. It was very tasty but I think I'll use ketchup next time instead of BBQ sauce. They were okay the next day but the best right after they came out of the oven.

Ok, my family didn't really enjoy...probably because I make a much more unhealthy version and they don't know any better, haha.  But might be worth a try for you family.

Yummy!  Added salt, pepper, garlic powder, used 1.25 lbs of ground turkey (because that's how much came in the package I bought), refrigerated for a couple of hours, used cupcake cups (the foil kind), and topped with a mix of BBQ sauce & ketchup.  It made a whopping 24 "cupcakes," so next time I'd freeze some uncooked or just cut the recipe in half.  Hubby didn't care for it much but he's a picky eater and doesn't like ground meat or zucchini.  Kids take after him and wouldn't even try any. More for me!

Absolutely wonderful.  The only change I made was to substitute seasoned bread crumbs for the couscous.  It was easy to make, the BBQ sauce on the top was the frosting on the cake!  I plan on giving this recipe to lots of people - and making it a lot myself.

These were great! I think I over processed the veggies, so I added a little more cous-cous so it wasn't as wet. I used everything in the recipe but I was out of worcestershire, so I substituted bold HP sauce. I followed other reviews and added some minced garlic, salt and pepper. I used Dinosaur BBQ sauce on top whch added a little bite. My husband almost fell off his chair when I told him he was eating Zuccini which he normally hates. Great way to get some disguised veggies in!

A good and interesting recipe, I found the mixture to be very wet, so advise to increase the amount of couscous.  My six year old ate it up so very happy about that- I like the idea of grating the vegetables instead of processing to make it less wet.  I served these with basmati rice and brocolli a yummy dinner for all.

Made this tonight for dinner. I did what she said not to, pulverized my veggies until they were very wet. Don't do that. I added more couscous to correct my overwet veggies. I also made it in a loaf since I didn't have a muffin tin available to me. My family and I loved it! The recipe is now in my box. I'm going to buy a muffin tin for next time. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used ground chicken breast instead of turkey and carrots intead of red pepper.  I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  They came out really good.  Next time I may try a piquant sauce on top instead of the BBQ

Fixed as written. First thing out of my husband's mouth was that it wasn't my usual good meatloaf. I thought there was way too much onion. The meat stayed together nicely and was moist, but the onions overwhelmed it. I will stick with my favorite recipe from this site and leave this one for the parents who need to sneak veggies into their children's diet.

This just was not good at all. Bland tasting, and not appetizing looking. I could not even get anyone else in my family to taste it! This definitely tastes more like a veggie meatloaf than anything else.

I prepared these last night and they were great.  The only things I changed was subsituting 1/2 c. seasoned bread crumbs for the couscous and adding 1 tsp. of chopped garlic.  They were great and I have a few left for lunch today.

These are fairly good but definitely lack flavor.  If I make this again, would add some salt, garlic and perhaps a touch of oregano and also squeeze out some of the liquid from the vegetable mix as other reviewers have suggested....
Made this again squeezing some liquid out but using breadcrumbs still comes out mushy.  Barbecue sauce adds pretty good flavor but might only work with couscous or something that absorbs more liquid

I pretty much followed the recipe to the tee, except using egg, I used 1 tbsp of flax meal and 3 tbsp of water since my daughter is allergic to eggs. I also  added minced garlic which added a bit more flavor like a previous reviewer did. 
I noticed after cooking for 25 min. and waiting 5 min. to pop them out...they would fall apart. So I put the second batch in for 30 min. and it was a lot better. Maybe if I had squeezed out the water from the veggies it wouldn't have fallen apart so easily. 
This recipe made 48 minis and 5 regular size. Also, I think I would fill them up instead of 3/4 because they shrunk a bit during the cooking process.

What a great recipe! Tasty,
 healthy and makes an attractive dinner plate. Served with roasted brussel sprouts and mashed red potatos. Worked well with whole wheat couscous. Needed a second egg, added a shredded carrot and seasoned with a little sea salt, cafe large grind black pepper, cayenne and 2 cloves of garlic. I ended up with 12 regular sized muffin loaves. Will definitely share this recipe.

These were delish!  In the future I won't use couscous (WAY too expensive) I think regular bread crumbs will do the trick, and I'll be sure to grease my pan a little better, mine did NOT come out pretty like these did.  Otherwise, we loved them, I definitely want a do-over.

I thought they were fabulous considering the amount of zucchini. and we could not taste the couscous either, it made this a lot better than adding rice , also froze the the extra one and they were as good. The only thing i would add next time is spices to give them a kick. and of course garlic.    I forgpot i made mine with lean hamburg .

My family enjoyed this so much!  We made ours without the pepper, as we didn't have any on-hand.  Next time, we'll add it in, as well as some garlic. 
They had such a nice, airy texture to them and were well-received by even my pickiest eater.  Will make again!  Thank you!

WOW!!!  I have made these several times since discovering this recipe.  I love them.  The veggies, the peppers, the colors, the flavors, are all perfect.  The BBQ sauce topping is like the icing on the cake.  I will continue to make these often just as written.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Wow!  I was NOT expecting this recipe to be as good as it was.  I'm used to my dad's meatloaf from the smoker.  I made this wanting a healthy, low-calorie meal.  It turned out to be so delicious and moist!  Definitely the moistest meatloaf I've ever had in my life (literally).

I made these last night and they're amazing!  I used my regular meatloaf topping instead of the BBQ sauce and I didn't put any bell pepper.  I could eat these once a week!!!  Def a keeper!  Thank you so much for sharing!

YUUUM! We had some ground turkey in the fridge and found this recipe with a quick search.  I changed the recipe a bit.  We didn't have couscous so I added uncooked rice.  I also added, a bit of tomato sauce, bread crumbs, corn, mushrooms, garlic and pepper.  I didn't have zucchini so we skipped that part.  In addition to the BBQ sauce I added some fat free cheddar to the top. It was perfect!

I follow the recipe exactly as written when I have all of the ingredients - great every time! When I’m low on veggies, I just add chopped onions and green peppers. Delicious

This is a fabulous dish and my go to meatloaf. We use A1 bc my son Is allergic to the fish in Worcester sauce. Sometimes we also add a bit more couscous if it’s a little too liquified.... bottom line?
Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a great recipe!  It's relatively easy, makes a lot, freezes and reheats well, and tastes great to be so low calorie.  I did change it up a bit though to fit my flavor preferences.  I used 1.5-2 cups of canned sweet potato instead of zucchini.  I left the onions and bell pepper coarsely diced for texture.  And I added some freshly ground black pepper, garlic salt, parsley, and a pinch of cayenne for flavor.  It came out perfectly!  I served it with sautéed green beans and homemade mashed potatoes and it felt very hearty and filling even though the whole meal was less than 400 calories.  The idea of making it muffin cups is genius!  Easy to cook, portion, serve, and store.

Excellent!!
Everyone enjoyed them. I modified some of the ingredients to increase the taste.  They stuck to the pan a little more than what I had anticipated,  even after spraying them prior. Any suggestions?

I make these for my granddaughter who takes them to daycare for lunch. She just loves them. I did use 1/2 cup of cooked quinoa in place of the couscous because that was all I had. I only seem to be able to get 12 out of 1 pound of ground turkey but I wrap them up individually and freeze them and they’re ready to go

The barbecue sauce definitely added a great taste.  It needs a little something more, maybe a little salt or garlic.  My husband liked it.  I will make it again.  I also made them in really big muffin cups and some smaller ones and the larger ones seemed to have a better consistency.

Simple recipe, I changed to a meat combination of turkey, ground beef, and ground sausage. It had great flavor. I also used a square cup cake pan. Love this!

I normally don’t modify the first time I make a dish, but I wanted additional servings.  So I bought 1 pound of ground turkey breast, and 1.17 pounds of dark ground turkey.  When I get home with the meat and read through some of the reviews, and I see the notes that there are too many veggies in the recipe.  So my modifications are not really with the ingredients, but with the amounts, and it turned out great.  I did add spices.  Based on other reviews, I hand-diced my veggies instead of using my food processor.   The end result was that I was able to fill 24 standard muffin cups almost to the top, using 75 g of mixture per cup, and then topping off with 1 TBL of sauce. Additionally, I had a small 6“ x 8“ aluminum pan from Maggiano’s leftovers, and was able to fill it about the same thickness/depth as a muffin cup.  All cooked for about 22 min to doneness.   Basically 2x meat, couscous, eggs, and the flavor sauces with 1.5x vegs.  Here are my ingredient amounts:  a little more than 3 cups/420g of diced zucchini, 1 large onion 377g chopped after peeling, 1 large red bell pepper 180g after seeding, 2.17  lbs meat, 1 cup/130g of uncooked couscous, 2 large eggs, 5 TBL/84 g of Worcestershire sauce, 2 TBL/40g Dijon mustard, PLUS 7g Penney’s Cajun Spice & 1/2 tsp salt.   I only had thin Eastern Carolina vinegar barbecue sauce (240g), so I thickened it up by adding ketchup (150g) and Hoisin sauce (60g).  Calories = 91 per muffin cup

I made these as originally written except for using quinoa instead of couscous as others suggested.  Topped them with grated Parmesan while still warm, which was nice.  If I do them again I'll use lean ground beef - they were pretty bland using ground turkey.

Overall I liked this best out of the meatloaf recipes I tried. The texture of the meat and couscous and veggies was great and you can mix it up to use whatever veggies you have on hand (I used mushrooms, red peppers and spinach). My biggest critique of this recipe is that it is soooo bland. I added garlic powder and onion powder, but for next time, I’m also going to try adding salt, pepper and some kind of hot spice. I was thinking cayenne, paprika and/or mixing hot sauce with the barbecue sauce.

Good recipe. Easy to make. I made my own BBQ sauce, but to save on time, use bottled sauce from the store. Will make this again.

Great recipe.  My only word of caution would be not to fill the muffin cups too close to the top, or the oil will spread all over the top of the muffin pan.

Added salt, pepper, garlic cloves. Used quinoa instead of couscous. Made into small 3 in loaves. Cook  without the barbecue sauce add during last few minutes.

This was very bland and watery. I don’t have a food processor and I did liquify the vegetables so that’s on me. The couscous was weird.  Bread crumbs would have worked much better and it needs seasoning! I won’t be making this again.

I will try perfecting this recipe. My advice is to not cook with the bbq sauce as it dries up and creates a sticky burnt mess for the pan. Overall though I think it’s worth trying.

Good recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little plain. Probably because of the BBQ sauce I used. The next time, I made a tangy sweet sauce with chili sauce and crushed pineapple instead. It was a hit!

Made it for the whole family, and it was a hit!! They were so yummy. I added garlic salt and pepper to taste and it was amazing! 
The veggie mix tasted amazing, I used a male red pepper, and it tasted almost like a pico de gallo, by itself it would make a good dip.

Easy and very tasty. I used large muffin cups, so the recipe only made 9 individual cups.

In our quest for healthier meals we thought we would give this recipe a try.  It was really good and very moist and even better the second night. We don't have a food processor so we just cut the veggies into small pieces.  We used pearl couscous (the recipe doesn't specify) and I added a little extra BBQ sauce to the meat mixture just because it was the end of the bottle and I didn't want to put back a couple tablespoons.  Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly, I think in the future I might tweak it a little and add some garlic or maybe some red pepper flakes, definitely a recipe to which you can add your own flavor preference.  Also,  if cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half or plan to freeze some but, they were good as leftovers.  We will definitely be making this one again!!

Transparency, I took a suggestion and subbed Quinoa for Couscous. That being said, these are tasty, nutritious, and pretty Diabetic-friendly. I did make a few without the BBQ sauce and found they are bland without the help, but I can't digest BBQ sauce so I'll have to find an alternative.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  The only exception was I did not put them in muffin cups, I just made a loaf!  I did not like the texture of this meat loaf!  It was loose and was kinda fluffy like.  I also did not like the taste, it was very bland.  If I make this again I would not use Couscous again, I would use bread crumbs and add ground pork to improve the taste and texture!

Omgoodness! So good!!! The only thing I’d do different next time is use maybe half of the onion in the recipe. I’m just not an onion fan but otherwise, DELICIOUS & SIMPLE!

This was atrocious. Mushy, no flavor, and even after cooking for an extra half an hour it still wasn't close to cooked. Super disappointing.

After reading multiple reviews, I reduced the amount of veggies, but apparently not enough, because the mix was still rather runny and I was unable to form this into a "loaf" like I had planned.  I also added quite a few different spices and herbs to the mix along with minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Next time around, I will further decrease the amount of veggies so I can actually form a loaf with the mix, but otherwise, it was quite tasty the way I modified the recipe. Here's what I added in the way of seasoning: 1 tsp each salt, fresh ground pepper, lemon pepper, dried basil, and dried parsley; 1 cube beef bullion; 1/8 tsp each cumin, cayenne, and dried red pepper flakes.

I did make these muffin cups and my husband loved them.  Instead of 1/2 cup couscous I added a package of NEar East  mushroom couscous (seasoning packet and couscous).  I also added a  head of roasted garlic & 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  They were moist and delicious.  Will be making them again.

Yes, I made 3 changes:  1.  I didn't put the BBQ sauce on top.   It just didn't sound good to me.   2.  I put in 2 eggs instead of just one.  3.  Lastly, I had some leftover chopped up bacon from another recipe so I put that in when I mixed up the veggies, turkey, etc.  YUMMY!

So good! I didn't have couscous so used 1 cup of cooked quinoa that I'd made with chicken stock. After mixing everything,  I taste-tested a teeny patty that I microwaved and ended up adding 6 cloves of minced garlic and 1.25 tsp of fine sea salt. The patty also wasn't holding together so I added an extra egg. I filled the muffin cups the entire way and  it made 18 muffins. They cooked within 30 minutes and held together. I made my own spicy BBQ sauce with 1/2 cup sugar-free ketchup, 3 TBs maple syrup, 1 TBs apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder. This one is going on the regular rotation. Thanks so much for the recipe, Amy!

Honestly wasn’t sure about these, but I’m always looking for healthier meal options. I made some substitutions-quinoa instead of couscous, soy sauce instead of worcestershire  sauce-and I added 2 gloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of prepared horseradish sauce. Delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised. I plan to pack these for my lunches for the week.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for some time. And it was dynamite! Since I didn't have a food processor, I've used my blender. I've made enough for 6 cups and have half for leftovers.  I would make this again for sure.

Flavor is good. I did add salt & pepper ( a little cayenne too). A little garlic wouldn't hurt next time.  Texture is a little soft, maybe becasue I used oatmeal in place of couscous?  Different and fun to try. Also like the individual servings. Looking forward to the leftovers.  I think they may taste even better on the reheat.

Wow! This is so good made just the way the recipe says! I make it as a meatloaf instead of in the cups.  Have made it twice and will definitely make it again....and again and again.  Family fave!

This was a very kid friendly dish.  It passed the toddler test.  It never occurred to me to use zucchini in meatloaf.  I might start adding it to my beef meal loaf too.  I used 1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of fresh onion.  Did not use pepper because I didn't have one in the fridge.  Instead of couscous, I used 1/4 cup rolled oats.  I defrosted grated zucchini.  I was surprised at how much it shrank while cooking but the result was very dense, filling and moist.  I might add another egg to make up for missing pepper next time.

Easy to make, very flavourful which is not easy with turkey and easy to serve.  I can also freeze the leftovers to serve to my daughter who does not eat red meat. I plan to make it again.

I didn’t follow directions,  I didn’t put veggies in a food processor. I think that would have released more liquid.  I used uncooked quinoa which was gross. A definite do over

i cook often and experiment with many recipes  & my husband most ALWAYS loves what I make ( he is easy to please )  NOT this time !  I could tell something was wrong when he wasn't commenting on them being delicious as he usually does , so I had to ask if he liked them at all , he actually asked me if there was MEAT IN THEM & what is wet inside some bites ! Ugh .. I was pretty upset with that response. Haha

Really tasty. I used a large muffin tin and filled to the top instead of 3/4 full. Required additional ten minutes of baking and made six large servings. Will definitely make this again.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe!  I put the cups into sandwich bags and froze them in a freezer bag for future meals.  He takes one out to work for lunch and I pull one out for dinner when I don't feel like cooking.  I had come across some seasoned ground turkey (in the tube near the ground pork) at Walmart that took this recipe over the top!

Loved this recipe thank you. Very versatile had them for dinner with salad, next day cold for lunches  & then the kids ate them as after school snacks straight out of the fridge. Will definately make these again.

We’ve been trying to eat a more clean diet so this recipe caught my eye. It was easy to make and came out great. I did substitute 1/4 cup cooked quinoa for the couscous. I made them in the big muffin tin and it made 6. They were gone in two days and my husband asked me to make more right away. I only used one pound of ground turkey; I may try 1.5 pounds next time. While they did stand up fine, the texture was a little soft for my taste.

Very good recipe! I bumped up the flavour a bit, based on previous reviews I read. I added: 2 eggs, salt & pepper, Chili flakes, 2 tbsp Worcestershire and 1.5 tbsp grainy mustard.

I expected the meat muffins to adhere together better as they crumbled  when you u put a fork .

I don't use turkey as I prefer ground beef but used the basic recipe because the vegetables make meatloaf much more moister

My family members liked it a lot.  But when I was making it, at the last minute I realized I didn’t have couscous so I replaced it with seasoned bread crumbs.    I didn’t care for something in it,  maybe the bread crumbs.   But it was okay.    I also don’t have the cupcake tray so I made pattys and did it in the countertop convection oven. Half hr on each side. I still want to try it again with the proper ingresients next time.

I substituted leftover rice for the cous cous.  Added garlic. Topped them with bbq sauce, ketchup, and worcestershire blend. Baked for an additional 15 minutes because they were too moist.  Probably will not make again.

I've never made this in muffin cups but I've made it as a loaf. I add a little more BBQ sauce and any kind of cheese -- colby jack, cheddar, swiss. Instead of cous cous you can also use panko bread crumbs. I leave out the green peppers.

Didn't measure exactly and that might have been the problem.  Used two large zucchini vice 2C.

Used muffin cups with one batch and not with the other.  Greased the muffin tins as directed.  Batch without paper cups burned and stuck to the muffin tin.

Really cooked down.  Might cook the turkey first next time.

Very good!  The change I made was  celery  instead of bell peppers. Also I didn't have any couscous  so took some pasta and chopped up in the food processor.     Ground turkey actually tasted great and a use for the plethora of zucchini I grew.

Very tasty and filling. We added shredded carrot, cooked quinoa instead of couscous, and extra bbq sauce on top like I read in another comment. We also added all sorts of chopped herbs and extra spices. We also used some bread crumbs and chia. Also, I used a box shredder for the veggies so they kept some texture. Yum!

I have made this many times- it is fantastic! Leftovers freeze well, so I usually double the recipe. Instead of the muffin tin I make mini loaves on a foil lined pan for easy cleanup. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it as written except after I popped it in the oven, I realized I forgot the cous cous!  It turned out good anyway, as my hubby even gave it a thumbs up.  I think it was just a tad crumbly because of the one missing ingredient.  Good flavor though.  I will make it again.

This is my new "go to" when I can't think of anything else I want to do with ground turkey. I had a very similar recipe that required me to cook the quinoa so I am pleasantly surprised that putting in uncooked does the same job! This time around I did not have zucchini so I shredded two carrots and it was just as good!

Meatloaf is my go-to  comfort food. When I seen this recipe, I was hesitant because I didn’t want my meatloaf experiance to be ruined.
It is seriously amazing! You can hardly tell it’s turkey and taste like the real deal!

I don't understand how this received such great reviews, but perhaps I did something wrong.  I'm not a turkey fan and like a lot of spices. It came out of the oven mushy, lacked flavor, and had an odd texture. However, two of my family members loved it, so everyone has different tastes.  In my opionion, was a lot of work for a not very good result, but maybe will be good leftover. Won't make again.

My whole family enjoyed this dish! I cooked a boxed chicken flavored couscous to add, rather than the uncooked. And, for the kids, I made some with ketchup on top, rather than bbq sauce.

I followed the directions as given and they turned out delicious.  One or two of these really are very nice for a quick, tasty, healthy and filling snack. Only problem I had was the mess it made in my cupcake pans!   Next time I’ll try spreading the meat in a 9x13 pan, bake it, then cut into squares.

I've made this recipe 3 times.  Since I have no food processor, I grate the zucchini and chop everything else as fine as I can.  I have made with cooked quinoa which worked well but tonight used couscous so I added 1/4 C. tomato sauce for a bit more liquid and flavor.  I also add about 1 t. chopped garlic, 1 t. dried oregano, 1 t. Italian seasoning and 1/4 t. pepper, since I put these things in my regular meat loaf and they add a lot of flavor.  If the veggies had gone through a food processor the muffins would not have needed 25 minutes, they seemed a bit overcooked but still good.  Leftovers are good, even cold, and it's a nice light recipe.  Thank you!

Made these last night and they were super yummy, although I was confused about the process.  I did not watch the recipe video as I am a seasoned cook and ended up with 6"regular" size muffin tin loaves as opposed to 20 "mini" muffin tin loaves.  I cannot see anyplace in the printed recipe where it indicates "mini" and I'm afraid cooking the smaller sized version for 25 minutes would have been a disaster.  Even the larger sized loaves were a bit over-cooked after being in the over for 25 minutes.  I think the recipe could use a bit of revision but otherwise would make these again.  Really enjoyed the flavor of the couscous.

I added about 1/4 Lb. of ground beef for a little flavor & used grated cauliflower instead of couscous as I am gluten free.  I also cooked in regular loaf pan instead of individual cups.  It turned out fabulous!!

I used bread crumbs instead of couscous, the result was just OK.  Would not make them the same, again. And I didn't use BBQ sauce, so mine were blah.

I too found it a bit bland. I will spice up next time. Also used mix of tomato paste & balsamic glaze for topping - yum!

I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the veg mixture, s&p, chipotle seasoning and a 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  I mixed hickory bbq sauce with ketchup for the topping.  Will definitely make again.

The recipe is a bit bland, but would probably have more flavor if you increased the ratio of Worcestershire sauce and Dijon. It might also be good with some soy sauce added to the mixture.

I used quinoa instead of couscous, ketchup instead of BBQ sauce, and I used what veggies I had on hand-- zucchini, onions, cauliflower. Turned out great, and I think pretty healthy! I loaded up on the veggies!

I made this as the recipe says, it is a healthy dish but it lacks LOTS of flavor...  just too plain for our taste.  I think it needs too many adjustments to even try, I rather find a different recipe.

put all the veggies in the food processor as indicated, however I thought it would be too much, so I left some behind for another use.  The meatloaf was so delicious and moist.  This is my favorite turkey meatloaf recipe.  

The leftover veggies I sautéed and used in scrambled eggs.

This was very good, with a few tweaks.  It seemed a bit bland, so I followed some of the previous advice, and added garlic, salt, and pepper.  I also added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, a couple tbsp fresh basil,  and a Habanero pepper (no seeds).  Came out just spicy enough (maybe a little too spicy for those from the northern states).

Made using gluten free bread crumbs, & tad of milk instead of grain.  No onions or pepper & but added Ms  Dash's seasoning. Very moist.  Next time I'll leave out milk to hold form. Definitely make again!!

I like the concept, but they were very bland.  I didn't notice that the recipe didn't call for salt, and I think that would have gone a long way towards adding flavor.  I like the versatility of these - with a few tweaks as to seasonings and spices, the basic recipe can be made with Mexican, Asian, Indian, or Italian flair.

I made these into one-ounce meatballs (41 meatballs).  The mixture is very loose, and even cooked, they are very crumbly, but that's merely a comment and not a criticism. Next time I will make them in muffin cups as called for.

I did add garlic powder (not enough), and used chipotle sauce instead of barbecue sauce, which gave it a slightly smokey flavor and a bit of tang.  Next time I will definitely add salt and pepper, mushrooms, and may try the variations I mentioned above.

Love the muffin tin for portion control. If you want two you can have  three. Used what i had . Ground Chicken,lots of veggies,zucchini,carrot,celery,onion,red bell pepper,splash of tamari soy sauce ,garlic powder,onion,powder,thyme,S+P. I processed my veggies in the food processor with the fine grate . Nice texture.Added 1/4C millet,1/4 red quinoa. Next time i will try oat bran or oats for more fibre. Awesome recipe to adapt to your tastes

A bit heavy on the barbecue sauce, which masked some of the other flavors. Would definitely make again with a little less sauce.

I made this for my boyfriend and his dad, and they loved it. My boyfriend eats anything but his dad is a bit more picky, yet he said it was the best he had ate in a while. So that's a win! I added jalapenoes to it,  just 2 small ones, for a kick, and I suggest you make sure you chop things up good otherwise the texture is a bit off. I used extra bbq sauce, which I think really made it great. I served it with some angel hair pasta with herbs.

This recipe is in our rotation and has been for years. My 3 and 5yo love it and i love that they're eating vegetables. We use quinoa instead to make it a whole grain that's gluten free.

We made these in August and took them out of the freezer last night for dinner tonight. They were super yummy! We used bread crumbs and frozen minced onions in our version. Def will be making more when we do our freezer meals again!

I have made this recipe so many times, it is my go to meatloaf recipe.  I just love it, it is so moist and delicious and flavorful!  The addition of the uncooked cous cous absorbs the extra water that can form in the cups, so I find it to be an important part of the recipe.  I don't recommend skipping that step, it also adds great substance and texture to the loafs.  I don't hesitate to add in any extra veggies I have on hand, like mushrooms or even cubed sweet potato.  The barbeque coating finishes them off just right, excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

This was truly yummy!  I was concern when I got everything mixed because it was very squishy but once baked they were great!

I made them adding a little oregano, thyme and rosemary, as turkey is pretty bland.  Served  it with some green beans and rice pilaf, and some light turkey gravy on the side.  

Delicious and healthy

the only thing I did differently was shape them into meatballs and serve with spaghetti squash. The meatballs had so much flavor. Loved it and will make it again. A simple healthy delicious filling meal!!

Nice recipe to use as a base.  I added a few tbsp's of carrot plus a squirt of sriracha, a couple of shakes of garlic powder and I use 1/2C of panko bread crumbs because I use my couscous the night before. Instead of BBQ sauce I bought a can of cranberry sauce with whole cranberries and topped each one with it. I use a jumbo muffin pan so I was able to get 6 nice sized turkey muffins and I use every bit of the turkey mixture. 400 degrees for 35mins and BAM!! Delicious with a side salad.

This was very delicious and I will surely make it again.  I was a little concerned with flavor because some of the reviews mentioned it was a little bland.  I added basil and salt.  For the topping , because My husband doesn't care for barbecue sauce, I used ketchup, Worcestershire and red pepper flakes (as another reviewer had mentioned) for half, and I used Rothschild Farms roasted pineapple and habanero sauce for the rest. Excellent recipe. Thank you.

My ADD was acting up today, so I butchered this recipe. It still came out pretty good! I can't eat Couscous, so I used gluten free bread crumbs, I threw in a very small yellow squash because it needed to be used. Then I didn't even read the part about using a food processor. So I had larger chunks of veggies and I forgot to get worchestershire sauce, so I used soy. They were pretty crumbly, but good.  Definately make again, and follow the recipe this time!

Found this recipe very bland and a bit too moist.  They were hard to get out of the muffin tins yet I followed the recipe exactly and cooked to the proper internal temperature.

Skipped the barbecue sauce and added ketchup and smoked Paprika (from Penzys) instead,  omitted the zucchini since I didn't have any but added finely chopped peppers and onions. The paprika made the major difference.

This is GREAT! Doubled the ingredients and made it into one large loaf and one smaller loaf. Threw in some grated carrots, chopped kale, garlic powder, salt and pepper! The couscous acts as a sponge, soaking up the moisture released from the meat and veggies, great idea! I'm going to try that in other meatloaf recipes!

Well received by my 6yo, 3yo and husband! Loved the crunch of the veggies. Subbed quinoa for couscous and added garlic salt. Might add a second egg and a little oatmeal next time to help the mixture stick together a bit better.

I made the recipe as described but I had a friend come over who must eat gluten free, so for half the batch I used gluten free bread crumbs.  She loved them and so did I.  Actually I preferred the recipe with the bread crumbs instead of the couscous.

I baked it as full meatloaf in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.  This has a pleasant texture, and is plenty moist, but needs salt and pepper and desperately needs something besides the bar-b-q sauce to give it some flavor.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  I try to always keep some in freezer for a quick meal.  Healthy,  low calorie, easy to make.  Being single, I love individual servings size.  What's not to love!!

I was looking for something different to do with ground turkey. I didn't have all the ingredients but I read other reviews and came up with a good, easy dinner. I used a 20 oz pkg of ground turkey. I didn't have zucchini but I grated some baby carrots instead. I added an extra tablespoon of Worsteshire sauce, used instant oatmeal instead of couscous and cooked the "muffins" at 375 for about 30 minutes. Kids (4 yrs & 18 mos) and husband ate them up. I'm looking forward to making these again with the zucchini (& other veggies). I did not have any trouble with them sticking to the pan-I just sprayed it with cooking spray per the directions.

I made this with ground chicken instead of ground turkey (it was on sale) and I made it in a loaf pan for a regular style meatloaf rather than the small cups.  Next time, I will add some garlic and some seasoned salt...other than that, it was very good & everyone seemed to enjoy it (not a small feat in my house!)

It desperately needs salt and pepper to make all the flavors pop. I also added some garlic that I micro-planed into the food processor. 

I do plan on making this again but with those changes.

This is the best thing I've made off AllRecipes to date.
I left out the peppers because I dislike them. I didn't replace them with anything, but next time I think I might add carrots.

So good! And enough leftover for lunches tomorrow!

I didn't have zucchini on hand, so I substituted other  vegetables in the same quantity.  I used mushrooms, carrots, celery, bell pepper and onions.  Love it because you get meat loaf in a much shorter time.

I don't normally have couscous on hand, so I sub Italian style breadcrumbs.  This adds some flavor, too.  I also add finely chopped carrot and spinach to the mix.  This is a family favorite.   My hubby spends most of the week on the road.  These are a healthy meal for me to make ahead for him to have all week long in his truck.  The small size makes them easy for him to heat up, as well.

I made these gluten free by sustituting couscous with cooked quinoa and by using gluten free mustard and BBQ sauce. This was a huge hit with my family, especially the teen who has gluten intolerance. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was delicious.  Only thing I did differently was substitute broccoli for zucchini.  It was fast and super easy to make.  My family loved them.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was easier than it sounds. I did not have enough BBQ sauce to finish all the of them and actually like the flavor of the plain ones too. I might try leaving out the egg next time to firm them up a bit.  Served them with PJ's sweet potato mash, which was a good compliment of flavors.

The only addition I made was 2 cloves of minced garlic. I think sautéing the veggies first would have improved these.  I liked them, my husband didn't . They are certainly worth trying.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted quinoa for the couscous and they turned out great! I also used carrots, broccoli,  and cauliflower with onions and peppers all put into a food processor. It added a spice that amped up the flavor. Love them!! Definitely will be making them again.

Supermarket was out of ground turkey so subbed ground chicken. I forgot to add the egg (oops) but didn't  need it. Hubby didn't realize this had couscous and I am not going to enlighten him LOL. I did have to be very careful not to "liquefy" the vegs. in the food processor. They were on the bland side so will add garlic and some s/p next time. I think I might also try using some carrot as another reviewer suggested. Leftovers warmed up great.

Edible but extremely bland (except for the BBQ sauce). Too much liquid from the vegetables (which were not over-processed) and stuck to the cupcake pan (which would have been more of an issue if they weren't so loose from the excess liquid). No one in my family loved this.

I realized at the last minute I didn't have a cupcake tray so I just used a 6x6 an and made it into a loaf.  Then I didn't have a food processor at my father's house so I chopped veggies into small chunks.  I didn't have couscous so I used quinoa.  Then I didn't want to use BBQ sauce because it's full of sugar and I used extra mustard.  It was DELICIOUS.  But I did have to cook it 20 min longer but probably because of the pan.  Needs a few more spices but I would make this again

Thought the recipe sounded healthy and tasty, so decided to try it, although I have another turkey meatloaf recipe that I adore but is a bit more labor intensive and time consuming.   For me, this one wasn't quite as good, and also needed to be cooked at a much lower temp, as 400 is too high for my ovens.  A nutritionist on TV advised that uncooked oatmeal can be substituted for any filler, so that is what I use for the fiber.  I own one jumbo muffin tin, which makes six, and I preferred, plus this recipe made an additional five regular size.  Also preferred to use my old standby topping, which is 1/4 cup Heinz Chili Sauce mixed with 1 tsp. Dijon mustard.  About 1 tsp. on top of each meatloaf does the trick.  I was distracted by an important phone call so didn't pay close enough attention to the time and temp.  If I decide to make this again will definitely lower the heat and watch more carefully as these were a tad too dry.

This is an awesome recipe.! My husband would have eaten the whole pan if I'd let him. I substituted cooked quinoa for the couscous and I added some garlic salt to it.Those were the only two things I changed. This was a big hit and I will definitely make it again.

I grated the veggies finely but did not use a processor. I was surprised there was no salt or pepper in the recipe. I added a little salt. The consistency was fluffy and nice. I would have loved it if there were a tad more salt.

Quite good.  I goofed up and processed the veggies a little much but just made up for it by adding a little extra couscous to absorb the moisture.  Only change I made was to add two cloves of garlic and to add a little fresh spinach that needed to be used up.  Otherwise quite good with a great flavor.  The texture was a little mushy, but I think that might have more to do with my ultra-processing of the veggies.   They were still quite juicy when they were done cooking but I put them under the broiler to crisp up for 5 minutes and it worked well.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy! Healthy, tasty, & fairly simple to make. Like others, I made a few tweaks. Shredded/finely diced the veggies since I don't have a food processor. Used cooked quinoa since that is what I had. Added several cloves of minced garlic. Can there ever be enough garlic? Ketchup on top...no BBQ sauce in the house. I think that this recipe can be adapted to what you like or what you have in the fridge/pantry.

This was very good and moist. I thought it was a little bland so I sprinkled truffle salt before serving and it really gave it the seasoning it needed. Easy to make.

Everyone LOVED these meatloaf/veggie cups.  Very easy to make.  In order to avoid getting "mushy" cups, I was very patient with the pulse button on the food processor and used a spoon after every few pulses to help move the bigger pieces of veggies closer to the blades (so not to totally liquify the stuff at the bottom).  Afterwards, I put the veggie mixture in a metal strainer and pushed out all of the excess liquid,  This left me with a nice moist (but not very watery) veggie mixture to add to the turkey. I got perfectly moist but not mushy cups.   Also, I used uncooked quinoa instead of couscous and I think the BBQ sauce is a must. So so good!

I made it as printed with the addition of 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used 1 tablespoon yellow mustard with 1 teaspoon white horseradish.  Instead of bbq sauce I put ketchup on top. Delicious! My kids loved it...and so did we!

Wasn't too bad.  Just need to make the Veges a little smaller next time.  But otherwise the family was actually pleasantly surprised.

I've made this twice now.  The first time, I used bell peppers and green onion, with the BBQ sauce.  I added the salt and pepper as well and they are so good!  Tonight I made them using carrot instead of bell pepper and no BBQ sauce and loved it even more!  It's an easy and healthy recipe I know I'll be using a lot when I go back to work.

I added garlic, carrots, and substituted brown/white rice instead of couscous.  Absolute favorite with everyone who tries it.  Delicious. And easy!

Delicious!!!  my 89 year old Grandmom ate it; that's high praise in itself!!! Will go in my rotation. Freezing a bunch for a later time. Didn't have a food processor so I can only imagine how great really fine chopped would be.

Very good, healthy and easy, even husband liked them and he's not a big ground turkey eater.  I'm always looking for lunch or snack ideas, could make sandwiches.  Per other reviewers I added some minced garlic, salt and pepper.  I did not have couscous so I just used seasoned bread crumbs, delish. Will make again.

These veggie meatloaf cups were quite tasty. I used cooked quinoa because I had it on hand and didn't have couscous. Both my daughter and husband liked it a lot. The next time I make these I will add garlic, salt and pepper. All in all, a very good staple. I served them with green beans I made in a crock pot and it was a yummy dish.

Loved this recipe!  Everyone in my house loved it, even one who is not big on ground turkey.  I too used quinoa simply because I was out of couscous.  I actually used a little A1 and regular yellow mustard just because I was out of the worcestershire and dijon as well.  (oh, and i add garlic to everything!) I thought it was wonderful!!!  Great recipe!

I added quite a bit but the base recipe is delicious! To maximize veggies I added a handful of baby carrots and onion too. With the zucchini I put it all in the food processor. I used a pre-packaged pack of cuscus that was garlic flavored and I made a loaf instead of cups which required about 15 minutes longer in the oven to get to 160 degrees. I served it over a bed of raw spinach for some more nutritious goodness! Super easy and will definitely do again! My picky husband who hates zucchini had no complaints with this one.

Without a doubt, these earned their 5 star staus from us. I last made these three days ago. I make no changes to this recipe. How can you improve on perfection. Reviewers should rate only the recipe as written, not on their changes. If changes are,in fact made, they are reviewing their recipe, not the recipe from amyappleseed. My favorite side with these is a baked sweet potato. Our BBQ sauce of choice is Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar.

Absolutely delicious! I've never had ground turkey before making this recipe...love it!  I'm not a big barbecue sauce fan...loved it too!!! Don't leave it out. It really does add a sweetness and an additional layer of flavor that was over the top. Will make this again...soon!

Good recipes as is, and it can be easily "tweaked" to suit individual tastes as many reviewers have indicated. The one thing I would like to add is that like many others, I too hate cleaning muffin pans. EASY solution here... and one I used with this recipe. Simply line your tins with cupcake liners sprayed with cooking oil, and add your meat. They come right out. No clean up required!

This was awesome. I fed myself and three guys and they were in heaven. It was moist, not too loose and had great flavor. I made these last night but did not cook them until today. I think letting them sit overnight helped marry the flavors a lot. The only thing I added was some garlic salt and pepper. I will definitely be making these again.

We enjoyed this recipe very much!  Definitely need the BBQ sauce, as it really enhances the flavors!   I took others suggestions and added garlic, and salt and pepper.  I might experience with more seasonings next time.  However it was delicious!

I loved it!  I made it this weekend and my entire family gobbled it up!  I substituted 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in place of the couscous.  The BBQ sauce on top really gave it a wonderful flavor.  I used Throwin Smoke brand sauce.  I also had to cook it a bit longer than directed, but it could be due to the fact that I made only 18 cups instead of 20.

Absolutely loved this.. As a new cook.. This recipe will make it look like you know what you're doing.. I ended up grating everything because I don't have a food processor and it still turned out great.

Turkey Veggie Meatloaf Cups Haiku: "My changes were slight. But these were out of this world! Colorful and great." I actually wasn't that thrilled w/ the BBQ sauce on top, and was glad that I chose to only put it on half of the muffins, which, incidentally, I got 12 large ones out of the recipe, as I filled to the top rather than the 3/4-full as listed in the directions. Didn't have couscous, so used oats instead, and by all means, they needed s&p and some fresh garlic. 3 of us ate all but 1, and that leftover one made for an awesome room temp late-night meatloaf sandwich!

This was simply delicious! The store I went to didn't have ground turkey so I used ground chicken but besides adding pepper I kept it the same.  I think this would taste delicious inside a cabbage roll!!!

Great tasting recipe. Love it! I did do the error of not reading ahead and put the BBQ sauce into the meat mixture, used extra lean ground chicken and cucumber instead of zucchini as it does not agree with me.  It turned out moist but tasted great. Will definitely use this recipe again, with my personal touches.

I added rice instead of couscous plus garlic powder.  I also added spinach and carrot chopped with onion and green pepper.  Very good as turkey burgers!

This recipe was fabulous!  Thanks for sharing it!  i added about a 1/2 cup of Italian style bread crumbs to it as well, and because I don't care for zucchini, I finely chopped up some mushrooms in place of them with my Ninja.  Finely shredding the vegetables is the key.  Be careful with the peppers, as they could become liquified if chopped too quickly in the food processor.  I would definitely make this again!  The barbecue sauce definitely enhances the flavor, as others have said.

This is the most delicious and convenient dinner recipe.  I hate to review when I tweak things but I loved this so much I just had to.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I didn't have pepper so I used carrots instead. I also finely chopped my veggies and made sure to discard any extra liquid.  I also prefer to use ground chicken in recipes rather then turkey.  I followed everything else as directed.  What I like is that you can really play around with flavor by adding herbs and spices to this and also by using different sauces to top them off.  Our oldest son loves these and I make extra so that we can have leftovers for lunches.  Next time I want to try and add some taco spices and top with a sala's for a "taco" mini meatloaf night.  This is a great recipe that lends itself to so many variations.  It is a favorite for sure.

So easy, tasty and good for you!  Will definitely make again.  I also used leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  I made recipe exactly as it states.  My mixture made 22 cupcake cups.  I cooked mine on 400 for 20 minutes and they were good to go!
Thanks for a great recipe!

I read reviews warning not to liquefy the veggies as they would make these runny, so I followed that advice. The recipe had a good flavor but they were very dry. There were A LOT of leftovers so to make them better I made a mushroom gravy for round 2 which dressed up the meat enough to get my (very unpicky) family to eat them! This recipe won't make the box.

We thought this was an excellent occasional meal.  Make sure you don't put in too many veggies, it causes the "loaves" not to keep their shape...but they are still delicious.  The only thing I changed was adding garlic.  Delicious!

These were really good! I added the BBQ sauce in with the mixture and then put a dabble on top of each one. I think that the only thing I would add to the recipe is garlic and possibly using quinoa in place of the couscous. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

Love Love Love this recipe!!!! This is now the second time that I've made it, and it is so good for so few calories, as well as filling! Like I always do, the first time I made it exactly like the recipe and my husband and I really enjoyed it. This time, I only made a few small tweaks. In addition to the onion I also added a shallot and 3 garlic cloves, and I did two tbsp of the Dijon to add a bit more kick. Also, I did cook the couscous before adding to the recipe. The first time I made it, I did have a few hard crunchy couscous bits. And this time the recipe turned out even better, this will definitely become a regular on the dinner rotation!

Not pretty, but healthy and tasty.  Nice to have little mini servings left over to warm up during the week.  Had one with breakfast this morning!  For people with shellfish allergies:  substitute 1/2 tsp sugar + 12 drops Tabasco for the Worcestershire sauce.  I used pearl couscous - added more texture.

Not a fan. I added fresh garlic and jalepeno pepper, and it was still pretty tasteless.  Nothing I would make again.

Instead of baking in muffin pans, I poured the mix into a 9" X 5" glass meatloaf pan and baked it for approximately 1 hr 15 mins using my oven's fan (convection) setting. Also, I substituted chopped celery in place of the the bell pepper and soy sauce in place of the Worcestershire because I didn't want to have to make a run to the grocery story to buy them. The meatloaf was good, but would have turned out much better if I had added more salt and herbs for a tastier flavor. That was my fault, not the recipe's, since the way I baked it  naturally retained more moisture, diluting the flavor.

Since I only feed 2 with the option of leftovers for lunch, and this recipe is for 10 servings, I cut the recipe in half--which then called for a half an egg.  I added a whole egg and the meatloaves were then way too juicy to stay together.  I pretty much had ground turkey baked with veggies.  Taste was great though.

So much moisture from the veggies that the mixture never binded together. I seriously could have drank them when they came out of the oven (and I did not over pulse the veg in the food processor -- they were still quite coarse and chunky). I'm finding it really hard to believe there are so many positive reviews here -- surely I can't be the only person who encountered this problem. Not sure what could have been done to remedy this.  Maybe more couscous? I don't write recipe reviews but I felt compelled with this one so hopefully others will find this helpful!

I really found it too game-y.  It needs more spices to mask the ground turkey taste.  I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe lacked flavor and had an odd consistency. I might try to add jalapenos and bread crumbs next time to see if that helps.

Very simple but just a tad bit bland for me.  I will probably add some garlic, salt/pepper. My BBQ sauce was probably too sweet too.  My hubby really liked it so I will definitely make it again and play around with the ingredients.

Very yummy!  I didn't measure my veggies.  Used 2 zucchini, 1 large red bell pepper, 1 large onion, 2lbs turkey, doubled the rest of the ingredients.  Plus used a bottle of BBQ sauce to spread.  Made 36!  Leftovers were just as good the next day.   Will make again!

Delicious! However, I refused to make batches and filled 12 cups to the top. I added garlic salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and substituted onions for onion powder. I increased the baking time by only 5 minutes and they came out perfectly. Definitely keeping in the Recipe Box!

Made these for my toddler and he loved it! This was very easy and actually really quick (with the food processor). I baked mine a little longer, but just an additional 5 min to ensure that they were done. Made exactly as written. Thanks!

Oh my goodness! This was delish! They were so easy to put together. I did follow the recipe for the most part but what i did a bit different was add some cayenne pepper, garlic powder, Tony's Cajun seasoning, ( I'm Cajun, so we like our food with a bit of a kick..lol ) and some Accent. I also cooked my couscous before adding to my ground turkey.  I let mine cook for 30 minutes on 400 and they were perfect. This will def be in my weekly rotation. Thanks for sharing.

These were so good I'm going right back to the store to get some more ground turkey while it's still on sale for $2.69. Then I'm going to form the recipe into 16 Turkey/Veggie "burgers" I didn't have couscous-used panko instead, but I don't consider that a big taste changer. The rest of the ingredients I did have. Thanks for posting this!

I thought this was absolutely fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of zucchini or peppers, but I followed the recipe exactly and I'm so glad I did! It was moist and delicious. I baked mine for 30 minutes just to firm up the cups.

I really like this! So did the family. I add 1lb turkey and 1lb lean hamburger. Trying to ease my family into the ground turkey. I did not have couscous so I substituted panko bread crumbs.

These meatloaves were very good as well as nutritious. My husband, who isn't food of turkey, loved these meatloaves. Since there is only two of us, it came in handy to be able to freeze them and reheat them for later meals. They were just as good reheated.

Great idea for something different for a meatloaf.  I eat about 2-3 cups with salad, etc. - I loved this recipe...  and healthy!  I will start using this recipe from now on.

I put an Italian flare on this recipe. I added fresh spinach and sundried tomatoes since I didn't have zucchini and use Italian spices including garlic, oregano, basil. Then I put enough of the mixture to cover the bottom and inserted a small piece of fresh mozzarella. Top with the mixture and then covered with tomato sauce.  I made 18 cups.  Baked them all and froze what was left over.  They reheat beautifully in the microwave.

Very bland. Added garlic as per other suggestions and a bit more turkey as the vegetable combination looked a bit too much. Added salt, pepper, chilli flakes, oregano, parsley and at the end still bland.... My husband refused to eat it.

This recipe is great! I usually have to trick my family into eating veggies and this was the perfect way to do so.  I didn't have any zucchini, so I used celery and carrots instead.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I think I will try to make these in the crockpot with pasta sauce today.  Cold and snowing here...

I loved this recipe, mostly beacuse my husband actually ate them and has since requested that I cook these!! It is a great way to get those who dislike veggies to eat them.  I have never had such moist meatloaf for leftovers either. I used cooked quinoa instead of couscous and it worked just fine. Also, adding a little more BBQ sauce is not a bad thing. I will use less bell pepper and add yellow squash the next time I make this.

We love meatloaf but wanted something a little different. Loved the ingredients. The barbecue sauce added a little zing. They really looked just like the picture and tasted great. I think anything made in a cupcake pan has to taste great. Would make them again and again...

Good, added 1/2 T. roughly of minced garlic.  Next time will try a Panko crust on top to give it a bit more crunch.

I made these last night and they were delicious! I even forgot to add onion, and found I didn't have w. sauce so I subbed in soy sauce. Delicious. I also didn't bother with the food processor and just chopped the veggies very small, I like the chunks of vegetables. Next time I try this, I will remember the onion, could only make this more delicious, right?

I added cooked quinoa instead of couscous because that's what I had available.  I also added some red pepper flakes for a little extra kick. Very easy to make!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, except all I added was about a Tbsp.fresh chopped parsley.  This recipe needs some salt & spices.  I thought the Worcestershire would be enough but it was bland. I found that after eating the top w/the bbq sauce, the rest was plain and bland. I couldn't finish eating it. I could not taste the Dijon at all.  It has a nice texture from the couscous & veggies, just not enough flavor. The recipe has potential, it just needs some zing added to it.  Sadly, we ended up throwing these away.  Hubby did not want more than 2 bites. Sorry.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the nice thing is that this recipe leaves plenty of room for experimenting.  I don't have a big food processor, so I just grated the veggies.  We don't mind the slightly bigger pieces of veggies.  I also used very lean beef, but will use turkey next time.  It was fine with the beef, though.  Last, I hate cleaning my muffin pans.  Instead, I made them into patties (about 1/4 inch thick), spread just a little BBQ sauce on them, and baked them on parchment paper lined baking sheet.  SUPER easy clean up! My hubby ate them on a bun in sandwich form.  I have 2 little girls, and they ate it really well, too. Overall, a hit with the family.  This is definitely a keeper.

They were pretty good.  They were a little...loose - I might add more couscous or some bread crumbs and maybe an extra egg to try to keep them together but they did taste really good! I too opted for some fresh garlic (2 cloves). The recipe directions say to fill cups 3/4 - I would fill them all the way next time and pack them in pretty good to see if they hold together better. I didn't think they were too "juicy" or "wet" tho - just a tad crumbly.

Great recipe! My only deviation was to finely chop the zucchini, onion and red pepper myself rather than use a food processor; I knew I would liquify them. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful. My husband hates turkey and was none to thrilled when I told him we'd be eating turkey meatloaf cups for dinner, but when he came home and could smell them cooking, he'd forgotten all his misgivings. He is so pleased with the recipe and has already asked when I would make them again.

Great recipe, easy & quick to make, & delicious! Made a few changes, used 2 eggs so it would be less crumbly, and 3/4 cup couscous. Very flavorful & you would almost never know all the veggies that are in it! Will be making again, and experimenting with adding more veggies next time :)

I was really excited to try this recipe, and was kind of disappointed. I found the texture wasn't great, it was a little soggy. I'm going to try it again, probably with half the amount of zucchini and coucous, and maybe add some bread crumbs like other people suggested.

This a super tasty, easy recipe. I tried to do the veggies in a blender (i don't have a food processor) but it didn't work very well. I ended up chopping them up pretty fine, which was more time consuming but worked just as good. I also didn't have any barbecue sause or Worcestershire sauce so I topped them with ketchup only.  I used the big muffin cups (6 in a pan) and let them cook quite a bit longer, around 50 mins. Yum Yum!!

This didn't work well for us.  Hubby ate it, but said the pepper flavor was overwhelming.  Both my 2 year old and 4 year old didn't like it and wouldn't take more than two bites even drowned in ketchup.  Both kids, by the way, would have eaten pepper and zucchini had they not been cooked in with this.   Also, it took longer to clean the muffin tin than it did to put this all together.  Not worth it for my family.

This was a very tasty meatloaf. The barbacue sauce added a nice tang. We ate it guilt-free because it is such a healthy mix of ingredients. The only change I made was to add a little bit of salt. DEEEE-LISH

Loved this recipe, family loved this recipe. I added fresh chopped garlic in the mixture. I mixed ketchup, worcestershire sauce with the BBQ sauce to top each cup. They were moist, flavorful and not heavy. This is a keeper. Thanks yum!

I did half turkey and half lean ground beef and added thyme and Janes Crazy Mixed up Salt and also added some carrots and not as much onion as the recipe called for.  These turned out wonderful.

Made these last night and they were a hit! Just added a little garlic and salt and pepper to boost the flavor a bit. Delicious. Will definitely make again.

These were great.
I made them with ground venison instead of Turkey. I also added carrots, mushrooms and celery. and I used bread crumbs in place of the couscous (did not have in house), and eliminated the egg. Made them into little meatballs and served with mashed potato's and zucchini/onions and mushrooms.. Yummmmmmmmmmy

Quick and easy and great for leftovers for the lunchbox! 
The second time we made these, we added some frozen zucchini and carrots to the veggie mix to help extend the turkey a bit more. This made the turkey cups a little more moist than the previous batch so I believe we'll increase the amount of couscous by a tablespoon or so to help off-set the extra water from the frozen veggies. 
We also used a barbeque sauce that was more spicy than sweet and we liked that much better. 
The recipe is a good base from which to give rein to your cooking creativity!

Great! Omitted the egg and used cooked quinoa instead cous cous. Also made into 6 nice burger patties and served with bbq on top. Yummy and healthy.  Thanks!

Excellent - Moist - Flavorful - Healthy! This is a definite winner! I used quinoa instead of couscous like another reviewer. (prepare ahead!) Next time I'll pick up red peppers but it was great without. My husband suggested ketchup instead of barbecue sauce which I'll probably sub next time. Neither would be just fine with me :) This one goes to the favorites list!

This was an awesome recipe, my 3yr old daughter loved it and my picky husband too! I did make some changes but that was only two things, I changed Dijon mustard to just regular mustard and I didn't do the barbecue sauce at all. Instead I used 24 tablespoons (12ozs) Ketchup mixed with Splenda. I'm now in love with these meatballs!
