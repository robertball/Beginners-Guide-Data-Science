Followed recipes completely. It was good but next time I will cut it in half. Too much for just us two. Also used frozen corn as no fresh corn was available. I steamed the frozen corn for like 3 minutes before air frying with the rest of the ingredients.

Great recipe. Thanks. I did let my shrimp cook 10 minutes longer than recommended, but the time on everything else was perfect. I was really surprised on how well the corn cooked, considering that it was fresh corn. I have the Power XL 10-in-1 1500W 6-qt Pro XLT Air Fryer Oven w/ Rotisserie and I'm loving it. I also find great recipes on this site.
