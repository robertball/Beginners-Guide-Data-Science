I made this for my boyfriend and he ate three of the four! He loved it! I made it in the oven at 375 degrees for about an hour. I also added mushrooms and left out the carrots. I'll have to double it next time!

I have made these many times, every time we go camping!  I do have changes though that make it really good.  I use hamburger instead of chicken.  I also use potatoes, green peppers and onions.  Lastly, I do not use oil, it makes the food really oily, I put a little butter and 2 ice cubs in the foil, this keeps everything really moist.  I will put some of each in nonstick foil, throw in fire...and you have a fantastic dinner.  Add some corn on the cob and you have a mighty fine dinner with almost no cleanup!  Try it on the grill too, just as good!

This is just like one of the recipes I recreated at home from my years of summer camp in the '60s.  It's a great go-to when you have a house full of people or disjointed schedules.

A few tricks.  We often have veggie trays with dinner and make foil packs, using the leftovers, the next night.  If it don't have leftovers to use, I cut up a variety of vegetables ahead of time and put them in individual plastic bags.  Everyone makes their own.
We just double heavy duty foil and do it envelope style.
Potatoes cook best if they're on the bottom of the pack.
Season to your individual tastes.  Salt, pepper, taco seasoning, chili powder, chicken seasoning . . . 
Use chicken, ground pork, beef or chicken/turkey - whatever you like - but crumble it at the top of your pile and place a small ice cube on top.
You can add ketchup, steak sauce, taco or enchilada sauce to the top before sealing and .cooking

Since campfires are not an option for us, I either grill these packets, or bake them in my oven.  My only change is to leave the chicken cubes out of the packets--but not out of our meal.  If grilling, I cook the chicken on skewers, and if baking, I stir-fry the chicken until lightly browned.

Very good!  I added some extra veggies, like green beans, carrots, ect.  My husband hates green beans, so let me tell you, I was absolutely shocked when I saw him eat one and say he thought it was really good!  So any recipe that does something like that for my husband deserves a five star rating!  Instead of smaller sheets of aluminium foil, find the extra long, heavy duty foil.  We only used two long sheets of it.  Very, very good recipe that we will use again when we go camping (or just over the hot coals of our grill)!  Thank you!

The kids thought this was such an adventure while we were camping, It was a easy way to start off our trip.  With 6 kids with us every one could create their pack the way they liked it.  I pre-cut the veggies,that made it real fast when we got to camp.  The best part was everyone put it on a paper plate so no dishes!

I made this for a group of 10 while camping.  It was nice to be able to make it in advance - I added the potatoes along with everything else, but didn't add the mushrooms until before putting on the grill because I didn't want to chance having them turn brown.  Since I had 12 packets, this was kind of a lot of work, and I would really prefer not to have to do it that way again.  Next time I may chance having the shrooms turn dark!  This was very good, and everyone aged 10 through 66 liked it very much , but personally, I thought it was a little bland.  Make sure to add some kind of seasoning.  I added salt, pepper and Montreal Chicken Seasoning, but I think it could have used even more of something.  Very good, but just needs a little "oomph".

Perfect camping food. I cut up the veggies ahead of time, and take a bag of frozen boneless/skinless chicken (usually thighs). Everyone puts what they want, along with fresh rosemary and slices of lemons. The bag of frozen chicken is no muss-no fuss in the ice chest, and then I don't worry so much about thawed chicken getting too warm if the ice is melting.

I made this over the weekend for my husband while we were camping in northern Arizona. I cut the recipe in 1/2 because it was only 2 of us. He loved it. Next time I'll use the whole recipe because he said their wasn't enough. One thing I will do, is remember to turn the packed over every 10 minutes so it won't burn.  Very tasty.

We use chicken thighs, which protects the chicken and gives a great flavor.  we also add a drop water and a pat of butter, leave a little air for expansion when wrapping, and turn over on the coals when you start to smell the food cooking.  we also use everglades seqsoning.  it is really good and a standard meal for our camp trips

We do these on the grill a couple times a week.  Instead of the olive oil, I use either Light Balsamic Vinegrette or a Mediterrean Vinegrette.  I also marinate the veggies and meat in the dressing before grilling.  The vinegrette breaks down the meat and makes it tender and moist.

These were great!  We prepared them at home before we left and threw them in the cooler.  It was nice that we could customize what each person wanted in their foil pack.  We cooked them on the campfire while we finished setting up camp.  They were a great time saver for the first night of camping!

Didn't care for the lemon juice.  I've been making this for many years and thought I would actually follow a recipe this time.  It was edible but the lemon flavor ruined the overall dish.  Might just be our personal taste and not the recipe.

A nice & easy camping recipe. I added a little salt and pepper (or seasoning salt) and served with a tasty bottled sauce. On our grill, it only took 25-30 min to cook.

very good. I've never really like bell pepers, so I didn't do the yellow bell peppers, but it was still really good. yeah, don't cut back on the olive oil or lemon juice. gives you results that aren't really that edible. Thank You!!

I make something similar but I put about 3 or 4 ice cubes on top of the mixture before sealing up the packages this reduces the chances of anything burning. The ice cubes melt and creates steam which also cooks the ingredients. As for making it more spicy add seasoning salt or any other spices. I must add I have never added chicken or any other meat to the foil method of cooking.

Ok, I did something wrong.  I tried this this week while on vacation and it burnt so bad you couldn't get the foil open.  I put it "in the coals" like it said and checked it after 20 min. and it was awful.

This came out great! I kept it in the coals for a good 40 minutes, resulting in some of the food getting blackened, which actually improved the taste. I also ended up using about 5 sheets of foil, 2 sheets just wasn't stronge enough.

My grandma taught me to make this when I was in middle school. I've always just cooked it in the oven. Since I have such a sweet tooth i use Dorthy Lynch dressing instead of the oil and lemon juice. I also use baby carrots(sliced in half if they are very thick) instead of the mushrooms. My grandma would also make them with a hamburger and some ketchup.

This recipe is Awesome! I have seriously been waiting all winter to go camping again to make it. The only thing we changed and this was just on our vegetable preference, we added Zucchini, more mushrooms and 2 yellow bell peppers instead of the one red one. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

I do this recipe at home ALL the time :) Instead of peppers I usually do zucchini and a little of Emeril's BAM spice!  Awesome!!  I have even used couscous instead of potatoes when I do it on the stove!

These are so amazingly delicious. I used to make these when camping with family but live alone now and still like to make these. They are very easy to bake or take out to the grill. I can't believe all those who complained about them being bland. Use you imagination! Season them to your liking. It's your own fault they are not tasty.

This was ok, it definitely needs seasoning as it is really bland. Maybe some fresh herbs or some seasoning blends. Will try again but next time seasoned up.

Good! I changed it a bit as it was too cold for outdoor cooking. Baked in 400 degree oven for about an hour. Had to use minced onion as I was out of fresh. I felt it a bit bland and was in need of salt. Once that was added, it tasted pretty good!

Great dish. It could use more seasoning. I adapted this to indoors by putting it in a baking dish and covering in foil.  I added more veggies and minimized the meat content. I added salt, pepper, basil, rosemary, sage, paprika, cayenne, and a tiny bit of chicken broth. I still think I went a little light on the seasoning so we all drizzled balsamic vinegar over the finished product, and my husband used some HP sauce.   But it's certainly a keeper as it is easy to prep the night before and when you get home you can just pop it in the oven! I baked it at 375 deg F for an hour.  Love it!

I have not tried this exact recipe but, I make these with my Girl Scout Troop and we love them.  Each girl can make her's the way she wants and it is always a hit.  They do not all like the same things.

This is such an easy and fun camping meal. I like to prepare a selection of cut-up meats and veggies and bring a couple of different sauces, like teriyaki and BBQ. You can set it out buffet-style and let people make their own creations. Use plastic forks and you have a delicious dinner with ZERO dishes!

We left out the mushrooms since we aren’t fans of them and no lemon as we were unexpectedly didn’t have one.

We have often made these "Tin Foil Dinners" using a variety of meats, vegetables, herbs, seasonings and even fruit (pineapple with chicken, apples with sausage, peaches with pork!) at cookouts for youth groups. This dinner is easy to prepare, easy to clean up and easy to tailor to everyone's food sensitivities and fussy choices.

What we have discovered over the years is by adding a layer of wet newspaper (just soaked in water) between the layers of tin foil, the food package steams, is less likely to burn and takes less time. 

Wrap all food with large piece of tin foil (do not wrap tightly; the package needs room to expand), sealing all seams well - wrap completely in wet newspaper - then again in tin foil.

We do pre-cook the meat to avoid any possible undercooked food danger.

Definitely needed more seasonings. I added some salt, pepper, basil & adobo. The cooking time was perfect & everything came out great. I included carrots & celery in mind as well. The celery really added some good flavor.  I'd definitely make sure again for our future camping trips!

I love these but adjust the veggies for personal taste. I leave out mushrooms and lemon juice, and I only use green peppers rather than yellow and red. I add salt/pepper, and use 2 TBS butter in each packet instead of the olive oil.

I put in steak instead of chicken and instead of peppers I used carrots. Threw them on the grate above the fire and after 20 minutes they were done. The beef juice made a gravy that was really good. Delicious and I'll definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good, added green beans to it and boiled my potatoes and carrots before putting them in the foil, nice easy recipe, will try with other meats and veggies, does stick to the foil though.

Made some this weekend and they were so good! We were camping a few nights so we brought the veggies in 1 bag and brought frozen chicken tenderlions in another. Just tossed chicken in the veggie/sauce bag at lunchtime and foiled them at dinner time!! Thanks for this new camping favorite!

Could have used a little less onion and garlic and more veggies I think but we all enjoyed it and I was easy to warm up over the fire
