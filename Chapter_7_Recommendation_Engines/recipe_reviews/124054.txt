Simple to make and comes out very moist.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 square pan. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and kept the blueberries at 1 cup.  I used real buttermilk which made this very fluffy. I added the blueberries to the dry ingredients vs. wet so they wouln't sink in the batter or get crushed during mixing.  I left it in the fridge for 1/2 hour to let the ingredients settle before baking vs. overnight.  It came out perfect after 50 minutes.  I made a glaze out of 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and 2 tsp. of milk and drizzled it on top.  This would be good with different combinations of raspberries and almonds or finely chopped apples and walnuts.

Have made this two times with great results. The last time I cut the white sugar in half, because this cake was just too sweet for my husband's taste. Happy to say that cutting back the sugar made this cake even better because the other flavors came through.

Great one-bowl recipe and so easy, especially since there is no creaming involved. I followed the recipe exactly. Don't overmix once the wet and dry are incoporated. This will keep the cake light and airy. I followed advice of doubling the topping but it ended up being too sweet. I also used roasted chopped almonds and it was great.  I folded in 50/50  fresh blueberries and raspberries - colorful and delicious. A keeper recipe. **I baked this right away but make sure to let the batter sit for 5-10 min. before baking to allow the flour to fully absorb the liquids. You know it's ready when the batter starts to rise, thicken and get a little fluffy (due to the buttermilk).

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for company the other night and everyone loved it. My husband who loves chocolate desserts (and me too) seemed disappointed I wasn't making a chocolate dessert, until he tasted it. It's a keeper recipe, for sure!

We substituted sour cream for buttermilk, and it worked out wonderfully.

Delicious!  I did make a few changes, using whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, adding 1/3 cup ground flaxseed, coconut oil instead of butter, and sour cream instead of buttermilk (needed to use it up).  I used frozen raspberries.  My family just loved this cake, it made a terrific Valentine's Day breakfast!

This gets my smack-your-grandma award, which is my highest rating, because this cake is so good you will want to smack your grandma after the first bite. Very easy to make. I doubled the amount of berries, and used both red raspberries and blueberries. I also doubled the topping, but only used about 1-1/2 the amount which was plenty for me. Oh, I threw some coconut in the topping, also, because I had about a cup I wanted to finish using. I mixed the batter just as instructed in the recipe, and the cake had a wonderful texture. I can't imagine that the B&B's coffee cake was any better than the recipe you devised. I will definitely make this again!

I've made this cake 3 times now, so I figured I should be fair and rate it!  It is fabulous!  I have made it the night before and baked it in the morning (after the blueberries were dried thoroughly, I coated them in the flour mixture so they wouldn't sink), and also baked it after the cake sat in the fridge for a mere 30 min.  Both times it turned out great!

Delicious! The only diary I had in the house was vanilla ice cream, so I melted it ,and mixed in some lemon juice to make "buttermilk".  I left out the white sugar to make up for the sugar already in the ice cream, and used half whole wheat flour.  We all loved it!

Delicious, light and not too sweet.  I used fresh-picked costal olallieberries.  I didn't have buttermilk so mixed up some sour cream I had around with milk about 50/50.  I was otherwise faithful to the ingredient list, although I didn't melt the butter and mixed it up as a "classic" cake, creaming butter and sugar etc.  I baked it right away vs. leaving it overnight, though the overnight concept is brilliant.

I was skeptical of this coffee cake, but was very plesantly surprised at how it turned out. It was quite delicious. I would change a couple of things. First, double the topping and second, drizzle with the icing when it's cool (if it lasts that long). Otherwise you hardly know the glaze is there. It was delicious!

I would have liked to give this more stars, because the flavor is really good.  I made the recipe as written, but added half again the amount of topping.  It came out of the oven looking completely ridiculous.  About 95% of the nuts sunk into the cake, so I ended up with a nut here and a nut there.  It totally made me look like I don't know how to bake!  Not sure what I did wrong since I followed the steps exactly. . . .

I made this as a blueberry. For the sugars, I used half dark brown and half white.  I drizzled a cream cheese icing over the top.  Oh, I also added a little flour to my topping of brown sugar and sliced almonds that I tried to crumble by hand.  I probably should have added some butter too but I didnt.  Thanks for sharing.

I made half of this recipe using an 8” springform pan.  I followed the recipe, but I did sub sour cream for the buttermilk and used a full cup of raspberries in my half recipe.  I baked this right away, but it’s nice to know that you can make it the night before.  This produced a nice little coffee cake that I would make again.

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste, but I had the same problem as pp with the crumb topping completely sinking to the bottom, so it came out not so pretty, and totally stuck to the pan.  I tried inverting the pan since all of the topping was on the bottom, but it caramelized to the pan and was a huge mess.  Son and hubby loved it, and it was moist and delicious.  Maybe next time will try to refrigerate overnight WITHOUT the topping and add it right before it goes in the oven.....

I'm always looking for raspberry recipes this time of year to use up the berries from our patch in the backyard, and this one will be a keeper! I used half white/half whole-wheat flour (like I always do when I bake), added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and didn't let it sit overnight - DELICIOUS!! I did cut the recipe in half (except for the raspberries) and it baked in about 30 minutes. We ate half of it warm right out of the oven and the rest in the morning, and we all like it warm or cold : )

I did not add any type of berry to the recipe as my new husband likes simple coffee cake.  This was really good.  Nice and moist.  Made this for a brunch and everyone loved it!  This is a keeper will make again and again!

I brought this to a ladies coffee hour this morning.  Rave reviews delicious and very moist.  Several requests for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but substituted sour cream instead of buttermilk.  Will definitely be making this coffee cake again.  Thanks so much for posting.

Quick and simple coffee cake to put together.  It offered a great taste and was a nice compliment to an egg casserole dish.  My only problem was that once it sat overnight, all the blueberries sank to the bottom of the dish.  It didn't alter the taste, just the appearance of the finished product.  I felt I should have served the pieces like an upside down cake.  That said, this is very good and I will make it again and bake immediately as bellepepper did.  Maybe then my berries will stay mixed throughout the cake.

Thank you Susan for a great recipe! I have been looking for an easy one to use up some frozen blueberries and this is it! I cut everything in half except the berries and left it in the fridg 2 hours but glad to know I can make it the night before if needed. I only had dry milk but it didn't hurt it a bit!Very moist! I sprayed an 8x8 pan with PAM and baked it for 40 minutes. So good!

Very good, Very easy.  I added just a little more topping by rounding up the topping ingredients.  My kids devoured it in the morning, and all I had to do was pour a glass of milk.  I loved that it was make the night before, I actually served this on a school day.

Excellent!  Made 2 dishes of it, one with applesauce instead of butter.  Will definitely make this again.  All the blueberries sank to the bottom, but that's to be expected since it sat overnight.

Great coffee cake - added two cups of frozen blueberries and raspberries. Shifted my flour as it was lumpy and only sat about 15 minutes before baking - will try it again overnight to see if there is a difference.

Not what I was expecting after reading the reviews.  I halved the recipe and baked in a loaf pan, but this was just OK at best.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made a few changes to add nutrition: Replaced 1 cup white flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. Eliminated 1/2 cup of white sugar. Replaced 1/3 cup butter with 3 T nonfat greek yogurt. Replaced 1 egg with 1 T flaxseed meal + 3 T water. Added about 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste.

VERY GOOD & MOIST, EASY TO MAKE, I DID CUT THE BROWN SUGAR TO 1/2 CUP, COULD USE MORE BERRIES. I MIXED THE NIGHT BEFORE & DIDN'T ADD THE BLUEBERRIES & TOPPING TILL THE NEXT MORNING, THEN JUST PRESSED THEM ON TH TOP,
GOT GOOD COMMENTS FROM MY CO-WORKERS

I made this for a carry-in for work this morning and received a ton of compliments. I only had to cook it for 40 min. I made buttermilk by putting a tablespoon of lemon juice into 1 cup of milk and letting it sit for 5 min. I made extra topping and it was perfect. Walnuts are a delicious choice for the nut! Will definitely make again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made this for brunch on Mother's Day and it disappeared.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!
