This is absolutely awesome.  I am not a sausage gravy person...white sauce and crumbled Jimmy Dean just don't turn the crank, ya know?  But my family loves it so I tried this recipe.

It is out of this world.  I used sage flavored sausage and dried thyme...also added a pinch of dried ginger as was suggested.  I did cut the onion and pepper down significantly...i used 1/4 c red banana pepper and 1/2 c finely chopped onion...don't skip the parsley at the end...it is a nice touch.

I like the heat of the cayenne, but that is up to you.  I also substituted an envelope of McCormick Sausage Gravy mix for the flour.  Be prepared to add some extra milk.

I served with homemade granola, fresh fruit and yogurt (made me feel better about serving the heart attack biscuits).  This is now in my brunch repertiore!

I love contry gravy and this one is really good. The texture and taste is better if you let it sit about 15 minutes and reheat and serve. Thanks you.

This is, by far, the best gravy I have EVER had!  And I live in West Texcas!!  Easy and colorful and rich.  Try adding some color with some red bell pepper or orange (if you can get them cheap) We buy our peppers cheap and freeze them after cutting.  Also, green onions are great with this gravy!  It's not just for breakfast, either!!!

this is the best gravy we've ever had! i didn't have a green bell pepper but it was good without it. i had to use dry herbs, so i lessened the amounts (1/3 tsp dried sage & half that amount of dried thyme because it's more potent) and added them earlier in the cooking. just add a sprinkle of parsley. 1/4 cup is way too much for my taste. if i ever get fresh herbs, i'll use them in this recipe. i'm sure it's even better with fresh herbs. this recipe tastes amazing. thank you!

This would have been a GREAT supper, except I let my husband get the SPICY sausage instead of regular sausage. It was so hot that even HE wouldn't eat it, but you could taste the underlying gravy and it was FABULOUS!

This was very good, except that I found that the crushed red pepper made it VERY spicy. I recommend leaving that out.

This recipe was amazing.  We've been playing around with different biscuits and gravy recipes for years but this one just topped them all.  As my husband and I are not into spicy things I crushed up about a teaspoon of fennel seeds in place of the red peppers.

Didn't have green or red pepper, cut back a little on onion (kids preference), didn't have fresh parsley...BUT this was delicious!  I did add extra milk to thin the gravy.  Husband, who LOVES sausage gravy, thought it was SUPER.  added to our recipe box!

This was very good, although a bit too spicy for us.  Next time, I will cut down the hot pepper.  I served this over home fries.  Yummy

This was just okay and nothing I would make again.  With all the "extras" added, I feel to took away from the old fashioned country sausage gravy taste.  I prefer basic sausage gravy.

This recipe is a keeper for our family!  I didn't have all of the fresh ingredients, so I used dried herbs, onion powder and garlic powder.  I omitted the bell pepper and crushed red pepper because my family doesn't like them.  The addition of chicken bouillon was a pleasant surprise and really added to the flavor of the gravy.  By using Jimmy Dean fully-cooked turkey sausage crumbles, the dish went together very quickly.  I'll never make gravy with only salt and pepper again!

I have enjoyed this site for a long time. I never have reviewed a recipe until now. This sausage gravy recipe is FANTASTIC !!!!!!!! I just tweaked a little bit. I don't add peppers or onions..instead I add onion powder..I use Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage and then I add dried thyme..I also end up using about 2 3/4 cups of 2% milk. You have too make this !!!!  my 15 year old son who refuses any kind of sauces or gravies requests this ALL THE TIME !!

I was born and raised in the south and I have tasted some good country gravy and this gravy is the best!  I was looking for a typical gravy recipe when I found this one.  The herbs and spices intrigued me so I thought I would branch out...this is my new country gravy recipe.  I altered it to make it veterinarian and it was still excellent!!

My whole family loves this gravy! I highly recommend giving it a try. Though we do use a little less onion now. (Maybe half an onion)

I've had countrybrakfast gravy since I was a child and there has never been none any better than this one. The only change I made is I only used one Chicken Bullion as I felt two would be a bit overpowering. I used alot more Black Pepper than the recipe called for.. Don't leave out the onions and Bell Pepper... especially not the onions... give it a nice crunch.. I served this over JP's Biscuits and OH MY LAWD!!!! Cook this recipe slow, slow, slow... no hurry and it will come out perfect

I've never tried to make sausage and gravy before. The only thing I changed was a couple of the spices and I wish I had left out the red pepper. It was a bit too hot for my DD. I served this gravy with E-Z Drop Biscuits from this site. I love the flavor that the sautéed onions and peppers gave it. This is a keeper for sure.

I made this recipe for my husband and kids for breakfast this morning.  He works a lot of nights, so I actually make big breakfasts quite often. Biscuits and gravy is one of the top picks at our house, so I make it about once a week. This just really didn't do it for us! It was just okay. My husband thought it was way too salty, and my son thought it was too spicy(which I even cut down on!) I feel guilty giving it 3 stars, because it really is just a matter of taste.

I didn't have unsalted butter on hand so I used 3 tablespoons instead of 4 to keep the saltiness down...I also started with one bouillon cube first worried about the salt but ended up using two in the end...I also used half the amount of sage and thyme because I only had the dried versions.... Great job!!

Very good - I made this just as the recipe called for, without reading other reviews.  Like others, I think I will cut back on the pepper and onion, leave out the red pepper flakes, and increase the milk when I make this again.

This is the best sausage and gravy recipe I have ever eaten!  Thanks to the person who submitted it.   I made it  for a tailgate breakfast prior to an early football game!  I increased the ingredients to make enough for about 30 people, but it served more than that. I made one mild version and one with the hot pepper flakes.  The spicy gravy was the biggest hit.  Then, I made it for company with teens who are picky eaters, and they ate it up. The recipe is so good, I would suggest that you do not omit the onion, bell pepper, garlic, sage, thyme, parsley, peppers or boullion because that's what gives it the unique flavor. (I mince the onions, bell pepper and garlic into small bits in the food processer). Tonight, I made it for our monthly breakfast supper, with eggs on the side. My husband wants me to try it again, using only 1/2 pound of the sausage and cut back on the hot pepper flakes. (He likes alot of gravy). Two biscuits, covered with the gravy, make a hefty serving.  So, unless you have really big eaters in your family, the original 1 lb sausage recipe can serve 6 easily. One last comment: I didn't make biscuits from scratch. Pillsbury Frozen Oven Baked Buttermilk Biscuits are the best. No need to thaw.  Put them in a preheated oven, bake as directed, and they come out looking like homemade.

Amazing! I didn't have a bell pepper or sage but it still tasted delicious. I also used around 3 cups milk and doubled the flour and bouillon to make more gravy. I didn't add any extra butter, half a stick was plenty. I'm definitely making this again!

This is my first time making sausage gravy and mmm mmm this is good Im a big fan of this for breakfast and now that I"ve found this recipe I can enjoy it more often instead of at a restuarant!!! I didnt add the bell pepper because I was afraid to LOL and I didnt have any thyme but still an absolutely wonderful dish!! And I love the fact that I can control how thick I want the gravy to be. I also love the pepper flakes added for that extra kick  I love a couple of splashes of Louisiana hot sauce on top. In all, a very great hearty breakfast!!

This was tasty, but too spicy, even with cutting back half on the crushed red pepper.  I'd start with 1/4 tsp. if I make this again.  If you're looking for traditional sausage gravy, this isn't it, this is a lot livlier and less creamy, but still good.

Easily the best sausage gravy I've ever made. The red pepper makes it a tad spicy for my tastes, so I'll be sure to use less next time around. I've made it twice now for house guests and it's always a hit. The leftovers are spectacular as well.

Best Sausage Gravy I ever had!  I found this recipe when I was searching for something to make with the fresh sage & thyme I've grown.  It's amazing!  I follow the recipe to a "T"!  I find it easier if I do all the prep work like slicing onion, peppers and herbs ahead of time and have ready to go one the cooking begins.  This Yankee sure appreciates the ease of this gravy and my Southern husband LOVES it!  I just got finished making it as requested for his Father's Day Breakfast!

This is amazing!  It was such a good brunch during a Sunday football game (with mimosas, of course).  The herbs really dress up the usual sausage gravy.  Love the crushed red peppers as well for a little added kick.  While in CA over Thanksgiving, I made this recipe for 3 of my husbands hungry friends and they went crazy (had to show the west coasters some country cooking).  The first time I made it, I did not add the parsley at the end.  The second time, I did, and my husband did not like it as well.  Also, I've never added the bell pepper.  A+ recipe!!!!

It was Ok, Did not see the need for the sage, since the sausage has sage in it already, did not like the thyme, the rest was ok.

The BEST biscuits and gravy I have ever had. I've made this a few times now. The bell pepper really adds a tasty flavor, but I make it without too. I made this for my sister and her boyfriend a couple months ago and they are still talking about it! I used 2 tsp of "better than bouillon" paste-- the bouillon is key!

This is some "bangin" Sausage Gravy.  i had never made it before and my husband asked me to try to find a recipe.  I am so glad I picked this one!  Highly recommended.  I pretty much made it as is except I added more flour and more milk to stretch it a little and did not use hot pepper.

5 Stars, delicious!  We have a freezer full of Elk so I used ground elk instead of the pork.  I buy the dry sausage seasoning mix from our butcher, it's the same seasoning he puts into the pork for sausage. I cut the crushed red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. because it's already in the seasonings I mix in the meat. Anyone having a lot of game meat can turn it easily into breakfast sausage if you're stumped with what to do with it all. I love the little bite to this wonderful sausage gravy.  Yum-0!

This bascic recipe was amazing!. Just did not add a whole green pepper or onion.  I used garlic powder to taste and did not use fresh herbs but used sage and thyme dried. Forgot the parsley. Do not need to add as much as called for using dry. Diffentely did not use the chicken bouiilon as this was added just for salt. Adjusted salt, pepper and hot pepper to taste. I have only had this gravy in the South and this was pretty close to the best or better than I had down there. Thanks again. I will be making this over and over again.

The addition of the onions, peppers, and spices/seasonings really made it stand out.  I did use less flour because of my own personal preference to have gravy that is not so thick, and I would suggest not adding any extra salt, at least not until after adding the chicken bouillon.

Loved it but I suggest cook less sausage or double up on everything else.  I ran out of sage so did not use.  I also chose to not add any spices since the pork is a tad on the spicy side.  It was delicious!

Oh my gosh, absolutely delicious! Family likes it,  company likes it; this will forever be my recipe for sausage gravy. My grandma cooked in mining and lumber camps during and after the depression, slowly moving westward. She added sage/thyme to her sausage gravy to make the meat go further. She carefully moved her herbs wherever she went.

Very good recipe! I use green onions and mixed sweet peppers instead. The mixture of peppers gives the gravy a delicious color.

I absolutely love this gravy. The fresh herbs and bell pepper give this gravy such flavor and character. If you are looking for simple white gravy this is not the recipe.

I wanted to try a new gravy for breakfast. This one seemed not to plain, but not to many steps. The only thing is I didn't have poultry cubes. So I used added poultry gravy mix w/flour. My husband had seconds and he isn't a biscuit in gravy person.

Made for the first time today and loved it. Only had sausage links so I chopped them up. Omitted the gteen pepper 1) because we didn't have any and 2) because I am not a fan.  I'll put a little less red pepper in next time. It was perfect, however it was the only complaint from my 5 kids that it was a bit too spicy.  I'll be making this many times over.

Got up this morning and made this with turkey sausage and refrigerated biscuits.  The package of sausage was 9.6 oz. so cut down the amounts of everything else accordingly.  I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the amount of red pepper called for would be way too much.  I just used a light shake.

I loved this gravy!  I really like all the added veggies and herbs that I normally don't put into a country gravy.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used about 1/4 tsp. dried.  Very yummy!

We used this recipe in our biscuits and gravy recipe war and it kicked butt. Sure, peppers and fresh herbs may not be traditional, but traditional or not, this kicked some serious butt.

AWESOME GRAVY!!!  I could not believe how delicious this was, definitely worth the time to make it!  I love country gravy and this was the best I have had!  Take the time to make it!  1 tsp red pepper was pretty darn spicy for me, probably will half it next time.

Cookie  2-2-10  My daughter requested sausage gravy for a family brunch  I had never had it and did not want to eat it.  After some research I  felt this sound like this the best recipe.  The only change I made were I used red and green peppers, dry herbs, no salt, and granules chicken (it has salt).The funny thing about that morning I would not taste the gravy w hile cooking it, my daughter before I was ready to serve had to  taste the gravy. Ten people started raving about how good was sausage gravy not only did I eat some , but also my son who do not eat PORK!!  It is now an official family keeper.

I had to try this recipe because I always just cook my sausage then add a little butter, flour, and milk as needed and thought this would be a nice 'venture', as it was, but overall I do prefer my less complex taste.  I will probably make this again with less red pepper, omit the sage and thyme and use only one bouillon cube.

Ijole!  I didn't add the bell pepper because the organic ones are too expensive and the regular ones are on the Dirty Dozen list.  I also didn't add the chicken buillion(?) because I can't find any buillion without MSG, cubes that is.  There is a brand called Kitchen Trends that is liquid, but I didn't think liquid is the reason it was being added to this recipe.  I used a local grocery store chain, HEB, brand sausage that had sage in it rather than adding it at the end.  I used cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes because we didn't have any pepper flakes (to taste, I like it spicy).  My wife made homemade buttermilk biscuits from a different recipe.  I also didn't add the parsley but did add the thyme as was suggested...At any rate, it was awesome. Next time, I may try adding less flour or more milk to make the gravy a little less thick.

A really good country gravy recipe.  For the best effect, really crumble up that sausage as it cooks and let it burn a tad.  Not smoky burning mind you but just this side of burned.  Then make the gravy.  Yum yum.

OMG!!! This gravy is amazing. The color, the spices, makes it taste like it came from a 5-star restaurant. I have never reviewed a recipe before but this one deserves it. I never knew what the "flour" taste really was until I compared this to other recipes and now I completely understand. I think the secret ingredient would be the boullion cube. I cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us and the only changes I made was I used 1 beef boullion cube because that was all I had on hand, I skipped the salt, and I made it without sausage so that I could put it on country fried steak. Excellent, will be in the regular rotation in our house, thanks!

This was good, but I thought the sage/thyme combo was too much.  Next time I'll leave them out and just do white & black pepper, garlic & onion powder (and the real thing).  I had to change the recipe a bit due to allergens in the bouillon cube.  So I used low-sodium chicken broth and cut down the milk by the same amount.  Also, I thought 1 lb of meat would be way too much, and I was correct.  I only used 1/2 lb for a 4-serving recipe.  This makes a lot more than 4 servings (over biscuits).  I served them with seasoned scrambled eggs.  I use the breakfast sausage recipe from Lee Fogle (it's awesome...and where the sage should be, IMO) made with 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground sirloin.  This is a great base recipe, though.  I cannot have pre-made gravy due to the allergens, so this is a great one to make from scratch.

Very good, however to turn this into a 5 star I would reduce the chicken bullion to 1 cube, not two. Also use 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for better  flavor and less fat.

I made this for my kids for breakfast before school today.  They  loved it!  I use a different recipe usually but decided to try and see if all the extra ingredients made a difference..and it does!!  Even my picky daughter said she liked it even though she knew there were peppers in it!

Personnally I would have added a dash of ginger and oregano to really bring out the heat. To me it tasted somewhat bland and I wouldnt waste my time with it again.

wow, this was truely amazing!! I didn't have green peppers or fresh herbs so i just used dried herbs and it was still amazing!! I also added a bit of maple syrup (because I like it) and didn't use chicken stock (only milk) I was hesitant to put the butter and flour in with the pork sausage (I usually make a roux seperate) but I thought I'd give it a go and well the results I will say again... amazing!! This is the only sausage recipe i'll be using from now on... thanx for sharing!!

I love this recipe, except  I do leave out the bell pepper and red pepper flakes. 

If the recipe itself omitted these two ingredients, I would give it a 5-star rating.

SO GOOD!!! Planned on all the kids coming over to start a new “New Years Eve” tradings, so I doubled the sausage and increased the milk and thickener, leaving the remaining ingredients as written. Definitely will make it again. New fan of biscuits and gravy!

I got tired of buying the package that you mix water and milk in with, and couldn't figure out to make it right without the overpowering flour taste. I found this recipe, and my boyfriend, who doesn't really like country gravy, fell IN LOVE with it. this one is definitely a keeper and to each their own, but I love the veggies in it. The bell peppers help keep a small sweetness to it, but I usually omit the spicy stuff because his stomach is too sensitive for all that. Still REALLY good and for me, it still has that southern gravy twang to it that some are like "I'll stick to the traditional". it's just traditional with a lil spice

This is the best homemade gravy recipe I've ever used! Plenty of fresh flavor, perfectly savory, and a crowd-pleaser for everyone at brunch! Colorful, and so much more flavor than standard white gravy over biscuits. 
Made this just as written, and could not have been happier with the result!

I didn’t include the bell pepper but added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I would add even more milk to make it more gravy like.

Let me start by saying that I am a chipped beef on toast person, my husband is the  sausage and biscuits lover.  This recipe to him is like catnip to a feline.  He could eat the entire batch by himself and lick the plate afterward.  It is great as written.  I use sage sausage and skip adding the sage itself, and then I add two shakes of Worcestershire sauce. I do not add any salt .   Usually after having this for breakfast he is happy to do anything for me (today we are planting flowers).

I had hopeful expectations for this highly-rated and complicated spin on sausage gravy. I made it for Christmas brunch, and we are adventurous eaters, but most everyone didn't even finish the portion on their plates. I made the recipe exactly as written. It was extremely salty. Also, the sage and thyme really overpowered the flavor to the point where you could hardly taste the sausage. I will stick to traditional sausage gravy in the future.

My husband and I seriously love this recipe, and that’s a huge endorsement, he’s a self proclaimed “foodie”! (aka he’s picky lol) I always think it’s going to be too thin with two and a quarter cups of milk and I’m always wrong, it’s completely thick every time. I personally like to add extra milk, it thickens up considerably as it cools. Five stars!

My son loved this.  I thought it was pretty good, too, but maybe a little too salty, and too much garlic.  I love garlic, but I had to do a triple take on the amount of garlic!  I made a few minor modifications to meet my personal taste.  I only used a half pound of sausage, as I enjoy the gravy just as much.  Next time I’ll try 1/3rd, although 1/2 was a great consistency.  A whole pound would have been WAY to much sausage for me.  1/2 gave a good ratio of sausage to gravy (see pic).   I also used half the thyme, as I dont think its my favorite, and used sausage with sage vs fresh sage.  I used very slightly less red pepper based on other reviews.  I think everything was good, but a little salty.  Little spice but not too much.

I only made a few changes.  I like that you don't have to take out the sausage to make a roux.  I used sage sausage and cooked it with half an onion chopped fine and seasoned with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make again.

I doubled this recipe because biscuits and gravy is a favorite in out home and something I once a year cook. We could definitely eat it daily or weekly but let's face it, it's a dish that isn't healthy and takes time to prepare. I also made extra gravy because we love the gravy.  We have a meat market in town that carries all different flavors of sausage. I found just plain sausage and the spices the recipe calls for to bland for our tastes and it does take a bit to prepare so it got four stars from us. This time I used 1lb of Italian pork sausage and one oound of Buffalo flavored prom sausage. I threw in a few garlic cloves with onions and pinion powder and fresh ground pepper. We all added the salt and more pepper once it was plated. Doubled the gravy as well. And put this over fresh out of the oven biscuits. It was very tasty, perfect spice level and heat level and will def make again. This is a great and simple recipe just I've yourself some time to prepare. Thank you for sharing.

This was great!  I didn't have all the ingredients - left out the green pepper, crushed red pepper, and chicken bouillon.  I also used dried herbs instead of fresh.  Next time I will try to follow the recipe, but it was great even with some ingredients left out.

I altered the recipe some as I can't leave anything alone. I omitted the green pepper, used Jimmy Dean sage sausage ( in the tube), used half and half instead of milk and only had dry herbs on hand. It was very good. Better than all restaurants I've experienced. Will make again.

I followed the directions for this recipe.  I didn't measure spices but used the ingredients  listed.  I thought this was great.  My boyfriend and I have never had sausage gravy with onion.  He loves onions but thought the onion may have taken away from the authenticity of sausage gravy.  Whether or not you add the onion to recipe, it makes a great gravy in my opinion.  I enjoyed the onion.

Personally, I've never had a better sausage gravy. I've certainly never had better in a restaurant. So good! I have a few thoughts on (minor) modifications. First, I consider myself a spicy-hot kind of a guy, and can tolerate spice levels more than average. However, I decided to use only 1/2 tsp crushed red and found that to be on the upper level of what I would enjoy. So, consider using 1/4 to 1/2 the crushed red as a full tsp could be intense. Second, consider no added salt. For me, the sausage (I used regular Jimmy Dean) has plenty of salt and the bullion cubes will add more, so in the future I won't add any. Finally, I added another 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk at the end for a higher sauce ratio. Thanks for this great recipe!

The best gravy I've had in a longgg time. I used ground beef for the recipe (personal preference, the husband and I aren't huge pork fans) and it was delicious!!! I used half and half so I ended up adding a little bit of water to thin it out. This is my new go-to recipe for southern gravy.

I only used half a yellow onion and half of a red bell pepper. I also used fresh cracked pepper. I followed the recipe for everything else and it turned out great! If you want it with a kick though I recommend adding some cayenne pepper to taste. Overall a solid recipe for sausage gravy.

Just like it says, yes! And definitely use cast iron or old brushed aluminum, but I always add a little cream sherry to any white gravy, maybe 2-3 tbls to this recipe just before done.  Also,  use , canned fat free milk and thin with water.  Stays rich, rich, rich but "not so much" wink wink...

Fantastic gravy. I didn't have the sage but I had poultry seasoning and used that in place of it and I added some celery seed and I used a hot pepper instead of bell pepper.

This was amazing!! I adjusted a couple amounts, with peppers and onions and spices, cut them in half because they were unfamiliar to my audience and I didn't want to overwhelm them. I also used a veggie sausage substitute and a couple tablespoons of olive oil in the beginning because I don't do a lot of meat. This was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. I may even boost back a couple spices when I make it again but this will be something I make (with leftovers) maybe weekly, maybe forever!! Thanks!

My absolute favorite breakfast and my family must have it when they come to visit.  It is such a sublime mixture of flavors that I don't want to overdue it: so, I do NOT add green pepper, garlic or onion and I only add a pinch of red pepper so everyone can enjoy it.  Additionally, I do NOT add salt or pepper - it is not needed as the bouillon is salted and folks can add more red or black pepper when it is served, although most don't.  PS - Those that are saying it is way too spicy... perhaps you used dried herbs instead of FRESH herbs?  Dried makes it at the very least 3x's more potent!  I like it that way, but I can see how some wouldn't.

This is the first time I made country sausage gravy from scratch. It came out delicious. We like spicy food and these ingredients made it taste spicy enough and very flavorful.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful Recipe! I’m a huge fan of biscuits and gravy and really enjoyed this recipe! I was a little nervous about making the roux with the meat in the pot still as I’ve never done that before with a roux but if anything it seemed to work better than making a typical roux! Will be using many more times to come

okay, yes it was very awesome BUT- i did lessen the pepper flakes & found it still quite spicy (good for me, not the kiddos!) also, be careful with the boulion cubes, it does NOT need two if you are using the "knorr" brand, as they are quite large. be sure to adjust salt seasoning AFTER dish is finished, bc the boulion is salty itself!! about 1/2 cup plus extra milk is necessary once all cooked. Otherwise GREAT recipe. will make over again with a few tweaks ;)

I made changes I wasn't particularly happy with, so my rating is a 5 star based on making the recipe without my changes, and the fact that my husband absolutely loved it, I can foresee this as excellent when made as written. I didn't have cows milk, I have soy milk, so I used that. It seemed too sweet. It may have been the soy milk. I will try this again and use cow's milk as written.

this is just a great recipe for sausage gravy. Full of flavor unlike most recipes that taste of bland sausage and flour.

A whole teaspoon of red pepper flakes? a bit much for a morning meal or brunch.
 I cut that back to a 1/4 teaspoon and it was plenty zippy.
We like this  with the added onions and peppers. Most sausage gravy is bland and floury.

My family absolutely loved this gravy!  I served it over some country fried chicken tenders (based on the Country Fried Chicken recipe submitted by visions) and they all got devoured. My only changes were that I used sweet Italian sausage, about half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and left out the bell pepper and chicken bullion because I forgot to buy them. Delish!

I added some salt and pepper when the recipe stated to, and there was way too much "flavor." I went against my better judgement. Salt and pepper it when it is completed if you think it needs it. And I would recommend 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of a whole tsp. A bit too much POW for the morning biscuits and gravy.

Very good gravy recipe. Very basic, but sometimes the simplest things are the best.
I did skip the red pepper flakes, neither me nor the kids like spicy foods. I also didn't have bell pepper. But it was fine the way it was. The kids gobbled it up, the hubby ate six (!) biscuits with lots and lots of gravy.

I actually only used 1/2 lb of sausage (and it was turkey sausage), but used the whole 4 tbsp butter/flour & 2 cups of milk. I omitted the red pepper flakes, garlic & sage. I used a red pepper instead of green & sprinkled with poultry seasoning instead of the bouillon.  This was really tasty - a more flavorful version of my usual sausage gravy.  I especially like the addition of onions & peppers.  I served over 7-up biscuits.

This recipe had a really good flavor but I thought it was too salty.  If I make it again, I will eliminate 1 of the chicken boullion cubes to see if that helps.

This was really good. I had to add a bit more milk, it was very thick. Also I tasted it before adding the second chicken boullion cube and it was already salty, so  I omitted the other. Served it over homemade biscuits, everyone loved it.

Really great recipe. Was a little spicy for my family but I will make this again cutting back on the red pepper.

I've made this version of gravy before and I know it's very delicious and easy to make. The only change I made was to use beef bouillon instead of chicken because of my oldest daughter's allergy to poultry!

Great recipe, I love the extra spices used and not just the same old bland gravy everyone else makes.  I put the leftovers in the freezer and took them camping one weekend, everyone loved it. I did not use as much tyme, not a big fan but love the sage.

Good, but sage and thyme were too strong. Would use cream instead of milk next time. The red pepper was a great taste to add though.

Beautiful recipe! Way better than the usual pasty white with pepper flecks stuff that I usually encounter! Simple process with an exceptional outcome!
Thank you so much for sharing! I had neighbors coming over to see what smelled so good ;)

This recipe is so good!  We're Canadian and up here you won't find biscuits and gravy in restaurants.  My husband has been searching for a while to find a recipe that we like.  This is by far the best one yet, it's a keeper!  Thanks!
