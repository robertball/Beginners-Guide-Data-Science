Both my husband and I loved this recipe. We used cilantro instead of cilantro paste. We used minced garlic instead of garlic paste. We will definitely make this recipe again.

Thanks for the reviews. The reason I use the organic cilantro and garlic paste is that I find it binds better to ground turkey. Plus it is a prep time saver.

Really good! I didn't have any limes so I left that out and no ginger but used about an 1/8 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I used fresh garlic and cilantro. I added an egg and 1/4 c bread crumbs just to be sure they wouldn't crumble apart. I got 5 patties out of 1 lb. of ground turkey. Will def. make these again.

AMAZING!!! Even my husband that doesn't care for cilantro liked them! I didn't have cilantro or garlic paste so I used 1/4 cup of fresh chopped cilantro and 1 1/2tsp of minced garlic. I didn't have any limes so omitted that. I also added one chopped green onion and a flax egg (1tbsp ground flaxseed & 3tbsp water) for binding. Will definitely be making these again!

I didn't add any salt to it (avoiding it) or soy sauce & my only fear was that the burger would break on the skillet BUT it didn't?? It was tasty & not dry. It crumbled in my mouth. Wasn't chewy. Cooked it on medium heat for 5 mins each side. Added cooking spray each time I flipped it so that it does not stick to the skillet. I added some Dry spices to flavor it. Will make it again.

I would rate it 4.5 stars. Mine fell apart. I'm sure it's operator error. But next time I will add an egg.

Perfect! I love Asian food and there are classic Asian (or Mexican!) ingredients in here so I splashed a sesame ginger vinaigrette in my burger my mom did BBQ sauce and my husband mashed avocado in. We always throw a mishmash of condiments down DIY style so this burger is a perfect crowd pleaser

this was so delicious.. like others i subbed fresh cilantro and garlic for the pastes.. knowing how we are i used 2.5 T of regular soy sauce for the 1.5 t reduced sodium.. i had mine in a lettuce wrap and didn't feel the need to add extra condiments.. bf had these on regular buns.. some with jalapeno ketchup others with tabasco.. looking back sriracha would have been good goto as well.. ty for the recipe
