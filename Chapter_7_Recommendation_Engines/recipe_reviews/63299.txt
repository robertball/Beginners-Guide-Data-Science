After a 3 hour panty raid last night, my friends Taylor and Ellen (who claims she is a nurse, but is really a bartender at the local Hooters) called me up at 3:00 in the morning and asked me to "whip" something up for them to munch  on while watching The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or something like that.             Of course I ran to allrecipes and found this recipe.  I made this with penne and since the market was closed in the middle of the night, I didn't have access to fresh basil, so I  used dried.  We had this with the left over flat beer from Hooters and after the two imbecile's passed out on my futon, I let the air out of their tires.  That'll teach them to wake me up for spaghetti!!  Enjoyed this very much, thanks for sharing.

This tastes super nummy and it was sooo easy! I sauteed the oil, butter, garlic, and spices while the pasta cooked. I used lemon pepper instead of black pepper and added a few crushed red pepper flakes. I also tossed the Parm cheese in with the hot noodles at the end so it would melt. It was delicious... my picky fiance even liked it, and that's saying something!!!

This recipe had great potential but I kinda messed it up.  First of all, people... if you dont know (like I didnt)... fresh basil means FRESH BASIL!!!  I used dried basil and it was way too much.  I doctored it up by doubling the garlic and parmesean.  I added two whole chicken breasts and that saved it.  It turned out okay despite too much dried basil.  I will make this again with fresh basil in the future!  Peace and blessings, people.

I love this stuff so much... another recipe I eat on a weekly basis. I       prefer to saute my garlic briefly in the EVOO first, add just a a pinch of   red pepper flakes, add no salt (but use salted butter) and I do prefer to use Locatelli or Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan, as the flavor is a tad sharper and just lends itself perfectly to this particular  combination.     Thanks for the post, Marilyn.

Fabulous!  I love pasta and this was perfect for a quick meal! I used a combination of parmesan and romano cheeses and it was delicious with Italian grilled chicken. To make the meal complete we added some garlic bread and a nice garden salad.

Very easy and tasty! To make it a bit healthier I used organic wheat fettucine, took out the butter entirely and also tossed in a chopped tomato from my garden. Delicious, cheap, easy and low-cal; you can't beat that!

This is a tasty dish, as long as you use it as a side-dish...I think eating this alone may be boring.  I used it for a side to chicken parmigiana when we had some guests over for dinner.  I didn't have unsalted butter, only had salted butter on hand.  Also didn't have fresh basil, I used the dry basil I had on hand.  In a small pan, I heated sliced garlic in olive oil over very low heat and added the rest (except parmesan)...only added parmesan when mixing with the pasta.

VERY GOOD!!!  I sauteed the olive oil, butter, basil and garlic in a large pan on low heat while the pasta cooked.  Then added the pasta and tossed with the parm - sooooo yummy!  I added leftover mixed grilled veggies.  My whole family loved it!

This was heaven and became a 5-star dish with the addition of fresh chopped roma tomatoes. I did saute the garlic in a small amount of olive oil to mellow the flavor, and then tossed the basil in for about 15-30 seconds, just until it wilted and released its unbelievably wonderful aroma. The entire family enjoyed this, even my uber-picky 7-year-old daughter. I served the pasta on a plate as a "bed" for chicken breast seared in garlic lemon butter, and my husband said it looked like something they would make on Food Network. LOL!

This had lots of flavor!  Nice and garlicy.  We wanted our carb fix last night but with butter and garlic and this was it.  I accidentally poured in 1/2 c. olive oil but still kept to the 1/4 c. butter.  Without sauteing, I added 1/2 an onion that I needed to use up and 1 t. each of dried basil, marjoram and red pepper flakes, 1/2 t. each of salt and pepper.  We love cheese so doubled it to 1 c. grating a good quality Parmesan and also mixing it in with the hot noodles.  Nice change from tomato or creamy sauces.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

I absolutely LOVED this and so did all my family members. Even my Mom, who doesn't usually like too much garlic, really enjoyed it. I wasn't able to get fresh basil as we are in the middle of snow storm, but 1 1/2 tsp. of dried basil seemed to work just fine.   Note: Sautéing the garlic and dried basil in the butter and olive oil really seemed to bring out the flavors.  I completely melted the butter on very low heat and then I turned it up to medium. Once it started slightly boiling, I mixed in the dried basil, finely chopped garlic, and the 1/4 cup of olive oil. (I wasn't sure if the olive oil would keep butter from melting or boiling so that's why I added it after the butter was hot enough to sauté.)  I stirred it occasionally until the garlic was a golden brown and turned it off. (Garlic almost burned so be sure to watch the browning closely. It bubbled up, but if you blow the bubbles down and turn the heat down a little you can see.)  After the noodles where cooked, I drained them and poured them into a large bowl. I did not have enough parmesan, so I mixed what I did have with a little bit of shredded mozzarella and cheddar.  NOTE: I recommend tossing the pasta in the basil garlic sauce BEFORE adding the cheese. The cheese melted so fast that it became difficult to thoroughly coat all the pasta in the sauce.   I added a little shake of salt and a couple shakes of pepper but my family liked theirs just fine without, so it is definitely up to each individual.

my youngest son liked this a lot because he doesn't like a tomato sauce with his spaghetti.  my other guys found it a bit lacking.  i liked the taste, but we felt it was a little dry.

A nice light meal.  I have amused myself over the number of people who either tossed meat in or used it as a side dish with meat.  The 2nd & 3rd times I made this, my entire purpose was trying to do a non-meat day following a couple of red-meat days.  It went great with garlic bread (yes, more garlic) and does well as a main dish.  It's also pretty easy and I usually have everything on hand.  Now, all that said, it was good but not great.  I used dried basil - I rarely have fresh around, hate chopping it, and I'm possibly the only one on earth that likes it as well and sometimes better than fresh.  (But for those who didn't know, you only use about 1/3 dried.  And even at that, I think half that would be enough for this.)  I wanted the "sauce" warm but wanted to keep it simple, so I just tossed the olive oil & garlic in with the butter as it was melting, and then kept that warm.  I poured that over the pasta, tossed a bit, and then added the basil, pepper, a hair of salt, and the cheese last.  As a main dish, I felt this was more like 6 servings.

This was really really good! I followed some other reviewers and made a couple of changes, but the simplicity and ease of this dish can't be beat! First, I sauteed some seasoned chicken breasts in olive oil and set them aside. Then I used the natural juices and leftover olive oil in the pan to lightly saute garlic, basil (don't skimp, it's a perfect amount), red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Then I added a little white wine, put hot noodles in the pan sprinkled with parmesan, and stirred well to coat every noodle. Excellent, easy, and I've already made it twice! Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe, simple and quick.

It makes me think to another traditional Italian dish, Spaghetti with fresh herbs and Pecorino, because the ingredients are almost the same: 
parsley, chives, garlic, EVOO, basil, sage, but with the addition of mint, marjoram and Pecorino cheese.

Tasty as is, but sauteed the garlic in the olive oil (and added a few more cloves) with around 1/3 cup cup of chopped walnuts- Yum!  Definitely needs fresh basil to be best.

Yum! fast and easy.  I picked basil from my garden and had this meal put together in unde 20 minutes.  I'm sure it would also be good with some chicken or shrimp.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would....this is sooo easy and so,so,so good. I can't think why some people didn't like it. Only thing I changed was not chopping basil and a sharper fresh grated cheese. This really tastes gourmet..Caution! don't use sub-par ingredients! Maybe that's why people didn't enjoy! Thanks, Marilyn!

This was a fast and easy recipe.  I didn't have enough basil, maybe 1/2 cup, and it was plenty.  I threw in some dried minced onion and more garlic.  Next time I'll saute the garlic, butter and olive oil.  It was really good and I'll probably make it again (nice change from spaghetti sauce)!

Loved it! I had to use dry basil and shredded Parmesan from a bag due to my tight budget. I eyeballed all the herbs and spices and added 1/2 lb ground turkey. I had to double the amount of butter when I did this because the added meat dried out the dish. It was great! Will definitely make again!

Very good! Didn't have fresh basil on hand so i used dry basil instead. I am living in italy right now and was looking for a plate similar to one my husband ordered in the restaurant in Florence... This tasted almost like it! Yummy.

This was a very simple yet wonderful recipe.  I made this with fish and it went well together.  I did decide to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks! :)

Good as a side dish but it really can't stand by itself as a main dish. Perked it up with some additional seasonings including red pepper.

Really quick and yummy!  I used angel hair pasta and served Bruschetta with it...season generously and the parmesan is a MUST otherwise would be a little bland.

This was really really good and pretty easy and fast too. Lemon pepper all the way!! I did as the first reviewer suggested: I sauteed oil, butter, garlic, and lemon pepper but I sauteed for too long the first time and the garlic and lemon pepper turned into a brown crunchy substance, so I set that aside and sauteed again, this time for only a few min (5 max). If you sautee too long you loose the flavor. Then I mixed the basil and pasta and parmasean, and poured the butter-garlic like a sauce. The first brown crunchy batch I poured on bread and toasted and it made a nice compliment to the pasta. Also used fettuccinni instead of spaghetti. You can use any pasta. All in all great recipe, will make again!!!

Not a huge fan of the raw garlic - would be 5-stars if instructed to saute...even for a few minutes. Other than that, this is awesome for a quick*simple*fast pasta dish.

Excellent for quick and tasty. Presents well and takes minutes to cook.  In a jam you can also put italian seasoning into mix instead of basil.

This recipe was delicious!  I followed the others who sauteed the oil/garlic/basil first.   My family scoffed as I was cooking it, but they all loved it, especially my children who don't like traditional spaghetti sauce.  This is one that I will save in my files!

This recipe was great!  I did alter it a bit though.  I added more garlic than the recipie called for and I sauted half of and and left the rest fresh.  I also added a half a tablespoon of fresh lime juice and it gave it just the kick it was missing.

This was very good, very fresh tasting. All that basil gave this a crisp taste, as in bright and fresh. I only used half the basil called for and it was plenty. I did warm the olive oil/butter and the garlic before adding it to the pasta. Very good.

I didn't use fresh basil, and I didn't think it would make a big difference, but it made this pasta have such an awful flavor.  I recomend following the recipe exactly I guess, because this just was not good for me!!

This is OK for a quick lunch....although I think I prefer italian seasoning to the basil & I'm not sure I'm liking the olive oil w/ the butter. I cut it down to 2 servings & added a bit more butter & parmesan.

A classic dish. But it needs to be paired with something green and some more protein to be a well-rounded meal.

Rather than use this recipe as is (sans sauce), I decided to use it to put pizazz in my usual spaghetti dinner. It is remarkable! The combination of butter, oil, garlic and basil in the pasta combined with our regular jar sauce makes it so mouth-watering delicious! We won't eat our spaghetti any other way now. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good....very simple yet tasty serve with crusty bread and a salad and you have yourself a meal..I also skimmed down the butter and olive oil just so it was a bit more figure friendly for me. Be sure to use fresh garlic and basil as well as the cheese to ensure great flavor and freshness.

This was such a good, quick, light sauce recipe (used linguine instead). However, I added Portuguese pre-cooked spicy sausage & heated it in the oil/butter for 2-3 mins. I sauteed the minced garlic at the end of browning the sausage, to get lightly golden in the oil/butter before adding the hot pasta to the pan. Followed other reviewers, with adding a little more Parm cheese & red pepper flakes to taste. This recipe is a keeper!

Mmmmm! Was great! At first it was a little lack luster but then I add some more cheese, I'd say about a 1/4 a cup more, halved grape tomatoes, sliced grilled chicken, (depending on the length) quartered, just warmed (on the grill) asparagus, and that was very good!

I just finished this and sat down to a plate of it with a little salad and frankly couldn't finish without reviewing it. This is one of the best dishes I have prepared and I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand. I am a single person and it makes enough for me to keep on hand for a few days. The flavor is fabulous and it was quick, easy, and cheap. I added a bit of red pepper flackes while I was melting the butter and also threw everything else in and let it simmer to really release the flavor and then tossed it all together, it came out quite nice.

I made this for my family and they all loved it.  The only thing I did differently was saute the garlic, then mixed with pasta.  Still keeping on warm heat, adding other ingredients. I also mixed some of the cheese in to melt, once served, topped it with remaining cheese.  Great recipe, especially if you have picky eaters who don't like a lot of veggies.

Very good. Put in half the basil though since I didn't have fresh and I cooked and cut up italian sausage links and added those. My four year old even loved it!!!

Very very simple and pretty darn tasty!  This was an excellent change from a red or cream sauce and made a nice light meal for the summer.

After reading the reviews, we decided to slowly simmer the EVOO w/ 5 garlic cloves, ¼ tsp. red pepper flakes & ½ tsp. onion powder for 15 min. After cooking the spaghetti, we added remaining ingredients w/ the addition of ¼ c chopped fresh Italian parsley.  With all the additions, the recipe was bland central.  We ended up throwing spaghetti sauce on to salvage the pasta.  I cannot recommend this one - sorry.

I have made this at least 4 times this summer, banner year for basil in the garden! I recommend the following: 
-Use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4 (unless you are a dedicated garlic addict)
-Melt the butter and saute the garlic in it.
-Use half the butter/oil if you are trying to cut back; still tastes great.

Used fresh basil picked from the garden this morning but didn’t know what to do with. Found this recipe and halved it; used garlic infused olive oil. Sautéed the basil, garlic, etc in the oil while the pasta boiled. Sautéed some shrimp in chipotle seasoning the the same pan after adding the oil to the pasta. Yum! Thank you so much:)

Easy, quick and delicious. I followed other reviewers and heated the butter, oil and garlic. I then added it to the pasta, cheese and basil. Yummy :)

Didn't have any basil, so made it without it. Add salt and pepper as needed for additional taste. Family enjoyed it even without the basil. This recipe was super easy to make.

Definitely a new "go to" weeknight dish. Very tasty and easy to make. I used gluten free spaghetti, a little less butter and a bit more basil.

I always read the reviews before I make a recipe but this time I did and I messed it up! How can you mess up something that has a handful of ingredients? The garlic was raw because I didn't sautee it like other reviewers suggested. I also didn't mix in the parm cheese, I just sprinkled it on top which made it very dry. Duh, mix it in so it melts a little! I also added in some sauteed shrimp which was delicious. Definitely will make some changes the next time I made this.

easy to make and very adaptable. For a main dish I added some sautéed ham chunks along with the garlic and basil and fresh ground pepper. This is on my monthly rotation.
