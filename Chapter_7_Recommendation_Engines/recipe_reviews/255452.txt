My family liked these muffins but I did make a few minor changes. I used local honey instead of agave and omitted the stevia (It is unnecessary) I also reduced the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. I added dark chocolate chips to about half the batter and that made the muffins even better.

I initially rated this 4 stars, but I had to change it to 3 because they don't keep well.   They are delicious fresh out of the oven.  But even though I stored them in an air tight container, they got very dry and flavorless.  I did make some modification based on what I have in my kitchen, and I don't know if that contributed, but I don't think so.  I used almond butter instead of peanut, regular flour in place of almond, and honey instead of agave nectar.  I left out the Stevia powder and maple extract and reduced the vanilla to 1 Tbsp.  I do like that they are low in fat, only have 10g of sugar and 6g of protein (made the way I made them)., so that's good.

Changes made: Maple syrup replaced agave as it's what I had & reduced by half to cut sugar for my diabetic hubby. Added cup of mini chocolate chips, to satisfy his chocoholic tastebuds. Plan to add dried tart cherries, another fave, next time.

Awesome!  And so easy.  Threw all ingredients in the Vitamix, blended up, poured into lined muffins tins, baked 25 mins.  Smell amazing.  Tastes great, warm from the oven with a pat of butter... mmmm!  Yum!  And husband approved!

Very moist & tasty! I got exactly 15 muffins and they cooked for the 25 mins as indicated. I chose to omit the maple flavor and used Splenda instead of Stevia. I also added 1/2 tsp salt bc I’ve never seen any baked good made without it. Otherwise I made them exactly as instructed and think they’re great! I used another site to build the recipe exactly as I made it and my calorie count per muffin was quite a bit higher at 144 calories so I think that can vary quite a bit depending on your bananas and brands. But mine also had more protein at nearly 5g. Will definitely make these again!

These are tasty! I didn’t want to bother with a mixer so they weren’t as smooth as the other picture but it was no problem. I used coconut sugar instead of agave since that’s what I had. Also added some chia seeds. This is a great way to get flax and use my almond flour. The peanut butter didn’t take over all the other great flavors and I even threw in some unsweetened coconut flakes and still plenty moist. Next time I want to add nuts, and maybe some Craisons and choc chips. The possibilities are endless! Goes well with morning smoothie. Thanks!

Nice and moist, with lots of peanut taste. Good hearty texture. It only took 20 minutes in my oven (oven thermometer said 350). Made as directed except I ran out of almond flour so subbed coconut flour and used crunchy instead of smooth natural peanut butter as I w. Will

I liked the healthier ingredients so gave this a try. Pretty darn good especially considering it's "healthed-up." Moist with a nice texture. Not bland at all. The only alterations I made were to use almond butter instead of peanut butter (only because I don't like p.b.) and I added 1/2 tsp salt to boost the flavor. Next time I'll make with honey instead of agave--I think it will compliment the flavor better, at least when using almond butter. Thanks for posting this, Jamjar.
