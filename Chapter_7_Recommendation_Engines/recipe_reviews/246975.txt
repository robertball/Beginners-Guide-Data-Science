I really liked this and will try it again. I was really surprised that it was sweet enough without any added sweetner--my grapes were nice and sweet. I used frozen apple, as I don't really like pears. And I used spinach instead of spring greens. I probably added about 1/4 c of water to get it all moving and slushy. The color wasn't the greatest, but it  tasted much better than it looked.
