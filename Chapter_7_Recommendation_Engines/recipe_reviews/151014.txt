I actually doubled the recipe and used a 6 oz pkg of pepperoni & a 9x13 baking dish. My family, and my day care kids loved it! (always a plus)They said it tasted like pizza. Great easy recipe. Thanks!

This was OK for a fast meal.  Tasted like homemade pizza with a really thick crust.  I did use both mozz and chedder cheese.  Will make again

Quick, easy and very tasty!  I added some mozzerella cheese, but I think it would still be great without it!

This is different. If I made it again I would leave the buns out until after it is done and then pour the sauce over a bun. It was edible but not awesome.

Great easy recipe.  Use ground turkey and turkey pepperoni to improve the nutrition facts.

This was a GREAT quick and easy recipe!  My husband liked it, and suggested using a pizza blend of cheese instead of just the cheddar.  He said to put this in the "make again" stack.

Was a little skeptical about the hamburger bun texture of this dish but was pleasantly surprised. I do wonder if maybe toasting the buns in advance might make the finished product a little better, but in the end this was a great recipe, very tasty and filling and I have 2 teens and an 8 year old plus a hubby that all eat alot!! I used a light mexican blend cheese and turkey pepperoni. Everyone in the family loved it, even my finicky 17 year old, so this is a keeper for sure!!

Great! I could make this also with the Italian bread I always have leftover  & use some Spag. sauce, I just thought of pouring  an egg mixture over the buns also. i never thought of using up my leftover buns this way. Thanks!

My family really enjoyed it but they have requested that next time I use MORE cheese and make it mozzarella.

This was really good.  My kids loved it and that's what matters in our house!  It was quick to make and used up leftover buns.  Would definitely make it again!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  Followed the directions exactly and turned out great.  Nice recipe for when you are in a hurry (softball games)and don't have much time to spend on preparation.  Thanks Megan!!
