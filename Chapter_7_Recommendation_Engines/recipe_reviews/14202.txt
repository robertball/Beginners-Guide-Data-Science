I make a very similar type of potato salad.  To add a little more flavor, I add bacon bits to mine.  I despise onions, so I know I miss out on a lot of flavors in various recipes.  But this is a wonderful variation.  I brought it to a dinner once, and the part people complianed about was the Miracle Whip(I personally love the stuff).  there were no complaints about lack of onions. :)

Yay, no onions! Glad there are more out there like me who hate potato salad most of the time because of the little onion surprises in it. I do agree with those who prefer mayo and add hard boiled eggs and a shot of prepared mustard to the mixture.

I grew uo on this. My grandmother added hard boiled eggs, bacon, and celery. Also she used 1/2 helmans and 1/2 miracle whip. On the top paprika sprinkled on it adds a nice flavor.

This is how I end up making my potato salad also, except I add pickle relish to add a bit of flavor. I also add hard boiled eggs and cheddar cheese.

A little too plain for us.  Ended up adding boiled eggs, bacon, and garlic powder.

Potatoes and mayonniase alone make for a fast, inexpensive meal....Although, you might want to spend the extra buck and add some flavor and nutritional value to it.

I make this same recipe, but I add 2 or 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs to mine. You can use half Miracle Whip/half mayo if you are serving to non-Miracle Whip enthusiasts (like myself). Yum!

This seemed like an easy recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand. I'd never made potato salad before so I thought I'd try. I don't like Miracle Whip so I used Mayonnaise instead, but I also added about 2 tbs of dijon mustard. I also added 3 hard boiled eggs diced up. My potatoes were rather big so I ended up adding more mayo and mustard but it is soooo delicious. Wonderful recipe.

I love that someone, besides me, eats potato salad like this.  I add egg and a little mustard to mine.  I think I may add a dash of celery seed when I make it today!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is good as a basis, but it needs more ingredients.  It needs more flavor.  So add your favorites.  I suggest hard boiled eggs, mustard, celery, and green peppers.

This is an easy and basic recipe, so you can add whatever else you like to taste.  Mine came out perfect, with added hard boiled egg and celery.  As for the reviewer who said it has no nutritional value, who on earth makes potato salad for its health benefits? =)

The basis for this type of potato salad IS awesome, but of course, I don't think there are any sort of "rules" as to how much of what to add and WHAT to add.  My grandma has been making potato salad with Miracle Whip for as long as I can remember (I am now 37).  When I asked her for the recipe, it involved the above mentioned things along with eggs and I believe onion. She could never give me the quantities of what she puts in it because, like many recipes, you can add and take away what you want and don't want.  It is trial and error!  We add the salad dressing slowly rather than dump it all in at once..that way you get a feel as to what you are getting.    There are many recipes that have this basic thing with mustard, vinegar, etc....we don't add that stuff, but do the boiled eggs and some onion (but not enough to where you are going to go "ACK!  There is ONION in there!"...it is subtle.    Add some salt and pepper and whatever to taste and VOILA.  But, once you have potato salad with Miracle Whip over mayo, it is hard to turn back!!!  Just customize it to your own liking..that is the key!  As written, I probably wouldn't like this recipe and would give it barely any stars, but add the egg, onion, and some salt and pepper, and VOILA.  GOLDEN.  Puts store-boughten potato salad to shame!!

Awesome!  I love the simplicity of this recipe. I'm Irish and my husband is English, we like to taste potato in our potato salad. When I serve this at parties, I line up my spices (chives, parsley, bacon bits, cayenne pepper, etc) around the bowl that way anyone wanting to spice it up, can.

It was way to plain. Even when I added other ingredients to the salad to adress the taste a little it still wasn't to good. I think you should still try this recipe, mabye you like it.

Very plain with just potatoes and salad dressing- I added onion, green pepper, just a teeny squirt of ranch dressing, and mustard and it was wonderful! This is a very good start, but I would always add more to it!

Pretty bland as is. After trying it as the recipe is written I added some mustard and vinegar, chopped pickles, celery, and hard boiled egg.

I had 6 potatoes I had to use or loose, so I choose to make potato salad. I was looking for something simple without a lot of chopping and mixing and adding. This was supe simple. I used kraft real mayo with olive oil (that's what I had on hand) and since I happen to be an onion lover, I added some sliced green onion on top!
