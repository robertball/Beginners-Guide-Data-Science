I don't know if it is the 2 cans of hot tomato sauce or the warmed tortillas, but this recipe was just phenomenal!  There are not even seasonings used here, but the burritos just have this incredibly full flavor - there is nothing missing!

These burritos are so incredibly easy, and this is one recipe I will keep on hand to use regularly.  The burritos are quite healthy, and the recipe uses nothing containing a lot of fat.  Thanks to Gary for providing a fantastic recipe!

Two hints:  1) To keep this recipe healthy when you make it, be sure to use skinless ground turkey, otherwise the skin is ground into the turkey and it contains extra fat; 2) If you are like me and are terrible at folding burritos, spread a little refried beans on the ends you are trying to fold - they act like a sticky paste to kee the burritos nicely folded.

I expected these to be decent, but they were actually wonderful.  My husband was also pleasantly surprised and asked me to make them again soon.  I used Rotel tomatoes instead of the hot tomato sauce, only because I couldn't find it.  I also wrapped the burritos, minus the sour cream, and placed them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 7-10 minutes.  The tortillas got nice and crunchy and the cheese was melted into the meat and beans.  I then topped them with the sour cream and served.  We will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!! This recipe was really great!! My husband and I have been trying to eat healthy, and we love mexican style food so I thought this would be a great recipe to try. We used the 99% fat free ground turkey. Like alot of the other reviewers we could not find hot tomato sauce, so we replaced the two cans of hot tomato sauce with the following: (1) 8 oz. can of tomato sauce (1) 10oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, 1/3 cup of medium salsa, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1/2 tablespoon of ground cumin, and 1/2 tablespoon of onion powder. The flavor was delicious! We will be making this recipe over and over again!

Excellent, but I added jalopenas to the mix.  I bought fresh Jalopenas and fried them in olive oil, then draind the oil and mixed the peppers in with the meat.  The longer you fry the peppers the less heat the remains.  Also if you dont want them real hot take out the membranes and seeds and chose peppers without the skin beginning to crack.

These burrito's were yummy!  My husband thought they tasted as though from a restaurant.  I found the hot tomato sauce, but chose not to use it.  I wanted to have more control over my spices.  For those of you who don't know where to find the hot tomato sauce, try the mexican foods aisle of your grocery store.  I followed the advice of others, adding tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with chiles, chili powder, onion powder and ground cumin.  I also added the refried beans directly to the meat mixture saving a step.  This made so much I was able to freeze about half.  Looking forward to eating it too!

Needs some serious spicing up, but other than that, it is a great start.  And a great, healthy way to use ground turkey.

I thought this recipe was very good. I followed the suggestions of someone else and substituted the following: 1- 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1/3 cup salsa, and 1 can of hot diced tomatoes with green chilis for the 2 cans of hot tomato sauce (b/c I couldn't find any at the market). I also added the following seasonings: 1 TBS of cumin, chili powder and onion powder.  I also used whole wheat tortillas.  I will make this recipe again! I love the low fat version by using turkey instead of beef.

For spicy tomato sauce, I use "El Pato" brand. In a little yellow can with a duck on the front. Yummy.

This is a great healthy recipe.  My husband and I actually have been making something similar to this for years.   Hint *****  I see lots of people cannot find the 2 cans of hot tomato sauce.   We use a hot tomato sauce called El Pato, it is either in the canned tomato area or the hispanic ingredients aisle.  It cost about .50 and has the perfect seasoning.  Nothing could be easier. : )

These were ok. I left out the beans & added burrito seasoning, cumin, and chili powder. Toppings were cilantro and sliced avocado. Nothing out of this world, but a healthy simple dinner to make on a busy weeknight. Although, I love the hot tomato sauce & plan on implementing that into many more dishes!

I only gave these 3 stars cuz I really didnt care for it too much. I did use left over turkey leg meat instead of ground turkey, maybe that makes a difference. I will try it again with the ground turkey and see if it is better.

i was amazed at how good these turned out!  i was really skeptical because there is not any seasoning or other ingredients to give the burritos a mexican-type flavor, but somehow they tasted perfectly spiced and just like  a full fat beef burrito would! i couldn't find hot tomato sauce, so i used regular tomoto sauce and about 1/4c of frank's red hot sauce to give it some spice. i think i could have used even more, too.  i ate these in warmed flour tortillas and my hubby enjoyed them in crispy taco shells.  either way i was so impressed with this!!

These are a good start, but had to add some things to spice it up... to the meat mixture, I added cumin, kosher salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, cilantro, diced poblano peppers, and diced green chilies. I couldn't find "hot tomato sauce", so I used regular (no salt added) with hot sauce and cayenne pepper. I also substituted refried black beans for the regular ones and left out the corn (on accident). They turned out great.

This is a great base recipe.  I'm a spice person so I added some cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and chili powder. I used a mild taco sauce instead of the tomato sauce, just cus it's what I had on hand. Instead of canned corn I used trader joes corn and chili tomato less salsa. It's basically my go-to item any time I make Mexican. I HIGHLY recommend that salsa in this recipe (and every other recipe!). Those were my only alterations and I was very happy with how this turned out. So filling and you feel good about saving the fat from using turkey. I will definitely make this again!

It satisfied my craving for a non-pretentious burrito, but I think next time I try it I'll leave out the corn. It seemed to take the edge off of the hot tomato sauce, and in the end the meat reminded me more of a sloppy joe filling.

Delicious! Trying to eat a bit healthier and this was great. I used Goya Sofrito tomato cooking base since Stop & Shop had no hot tomato sauce. I added hot sauce and adjusted it for taste as needed. I will be making these again real soon!

this recipe was a hit, even with my husband who hates anything healthy! Next time I may try to make it more of a wet burrito by putting the meat and beans inside the tortilla and the sauce and cheese over top and then baking it.

Delicious and easy. I made with rice rather than beans due to a member of my household's allergy, but everyone LOVED this,even the pickiest members of my family.

This is an excellent choice if you are interested in diversifying your menu when you are trying to eat healthy. I could not find hot tomato sauce in my grocery store, so I used cayenne pepper; I didn't measure, but used about 3/4 teaspoon in the meat mixture and another 3/4 teaspoon after the tomato sauce is added. I have also used Sriracha hot chili sauce, commonly found in Chinese restaurants and many grocery stores. With this method, you will get heat in every bite. Despite adding the spice, the mixture was still only moderately spicy; not too much. One could prepare this recipe without the refried beans and it would still be very good.

This was excellent, but did do a few things different based on reviews and my own twist 1) cooked the turkey in peanut oil, splash of liquid smoke, worchester and soy sauce.  2) added 1 can of tomato sauce and about half to 3/4 a can of las palmas red chili sauce (med).. Also, added a small amount of mccormick taco seasoning.  The meat came out perfect with a nice bite, but not too much.  Next time will add some shredded lettuce.

Another of those "I hate to rate after making changes" but wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed this and like it much better than another burrito recipe I had been using. I had an open can of creamed corn from another recipe that I used in this instead of regular corn, and could not initially find hot tomato sauce so I used enchilada sauce and tomatoes with chiles. Was worried that the filling was too thin, then I had a great idea to mix the refried beans in with the meat mix and it thickened it right up! Needed the full 20 mins to simmer, too. When all was said and done, the mix had a wonderful sweet/hot thing working that I really enjoyed! I'm sure the sweet was the creamed corn and I felt myself wanting more of that taste, but at the same time wanting more heat. All in all, very good. My teen son ate 4 of these using smaller tortillas when we ran out of bigger ones!

VERY good and filling.  Took other's suggestion and added rice to the mix.  Tossed them in the oven as well.  Took the overflow and foiled/wrapped individually in the freezer (yet another great idea) for one of those nights - "What's for dinner??"  Nice substantial meal at a low cost.

I made this as listed, and ate one. It was good. I decided to finish the rest of them off in the oven, covered in shredded cheese, at 375* for 10 mins. Was great!

These were very good, but needed spicing up. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of both cumin and chili powder to the meat mixture. I used Rotel tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I didn't use as much sour cream, but I increased the cheese to over a cup. I had enough filling for 7 burritos. My family loved these, so I'm sure I'll be making them again.

This was fabulous.  I used one can tomato sauce and one can of Rotel instead of the hot tomato sauce.  I baked them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese on top.  Everyone loved this recipe.  We will be adding this to our rotation.

Yummy yummy! I took some of the suggestions of others. Unable to find the "hot" tomato sauce, I mixed half a can of tomato sauce, half a can of diced tomatoes with chiles, and about a teaspoon each of chili powder, cumin, and onion powder. Instead of heating up the tortillas on the stove, I heated the oven to 350 and put the burritos in, minus the sour cream, for 8 minutes, then topped with sour cream when they came out. Delicious!

The filling was ok but I did not like that you had to heat the flour tortillas one at a time...It makes it hard for a family to sit down and eat at once. I tried to pre make them and heat them in the oven like another review commented but I thought they came out dry.  Not to my liking

These are quick and easy. Tasty. Cheap. Healthy. They fit all my criteria for a 5-star meal. You can make 100 variations of these, too, by adding veggies to the turkey, using your tortilla preference, topping with any number of delicious add-ons or altering to no/low/full fat ingredients depending on your taste. 
The leftovers are awesome, too. I served with grilled red peppers and zucchini and roasted ears of corn.

Used less heat by using 1 hot tomato sauce & 1 regular. Tasty; may add some other seasoning next time. To the person asking about carbs, that would be the refried beans & tortillas

Pretty tasty! Looked like a 'Mom's Special' in the skillet (mystery dinner) - but tasted great! I didn't have the hot tomato sauce, so I used tomato sauce and salsa instead. We used the smaller tortillas, filled and wrapped tightly, and warmed in the oven for a crispy exterior. I baked quite a few of these - way more than my husband and I could eat for dinner. I let the remainder cool, then I froze them for quick lunches to reheat in the oven or micro during the day.

Made as written, it lacks some flavor.  I did add some spices to flavor it up.  I also used Rotel and canned sweet yellow corn.  Made with some changes, to add flavor, it's delicious!  I also used whole grain tortillas, too.

Really simple but really good.  I like substituting turkey for ground beef in many recipes but its often a noticeable sacrifice.  These burritos were a great exception.  I did add some seasoning (cayenne, cumin and sp) and fresh garlic to be fair though.  Still a great quick recipe that surprised me and my boyfriend.  Try it out!

This was good but didn't have the total flavor I was looking for (fam loved ti & wants to make again).  I added some vegetarian refried beans to mixture for extra protein & give it more "stickiness"(kids have a hard time w/ holding it together). I used more onion that called for and added 1 can of black beans.  I also added rice & green pepper to stretch it further b/c recipe won't feed a fam of 5 (the 3 kids have HS/adult appetites).  Since it tasted blander for my taste (I dn have hot tomato sauce) - I added some taco seasoning, cumin & cayenne pepper. Overall good recipe and will make again.

These were great!  The only thing I did differently was bake these in the oven.  After I rolled them, I put them on a baking sheet, brushed them with some vegetable oil lightly and sprinkled a little more cheese on top.  Baked them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  It made them a little more crispy :)  P.S.  These taste even better the next day nuked in the microwave!!

This recipe made my family realize that, yes, they do like ground turkey.  I love the healthiness of the recipe, and the fact that it tastes so good is a bonus.  I brown the turkey in the morning, put it in the slow cooker with the corn, sauce, a little cumin and garlic, and let it sit on low for about 6 hours.  The flavors really come together and it's great for those busy nights when we can't all eat at the same time.  The meat is ready whenever someone is ready to eat.  Thanks for such a convenient, healthy, tasteful dinner.

Easy and YUMMY! Next time I will cut recipe in half, 6 serving was WAY too much! I sprinkled chili poweder on turkey while it was cooking and then cayenne into the meat mixture. I had a few burritos left over and had them for lunch....not as good but still good!

love this recipe. was looking for something different to make. Didn't have the veggies the first time i made it. But I did make some rice and added it to the burrito. It was so filling I couldn't finish my second one and I am a light eater. To spice it up, try Frank's Red Hot hot sauce

do not make any changes, Ro Tel tomatoes and green pepper is great, the real tomatoe can be found in most grocery stores under the El Pato brand. I have found the sauce in Wal Mart and the specialty foods sections in all stores here in North Carolina.

DELICIOUS!!! We loved these burritos! I had to modify slightly because I couldn't find hot tomato sauce... used one can regular tomato sauce, one can Rotel, one can diced green chilis, and some chili powder. I also added cumin to the mixture. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked the burritos for about 5 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Very, very good... this is a 'make-again'. Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe was simple and very tasty! We added a little bit of taco seasoning to it, but that's it. We served it on tortillas with black beans and rice and it tasted great! Thanks!

Similar to other reviewers in that this is a very good base recipe.  Making your seasoning choices is up to the cook's discretion.  1 tablespoon of cumin and a pinch of red pepper flake did do the trick.

The recipe turned out really good, some other reviewer suggested to use diced tomatoes instead of hot tomato sauce so i used that. I also found it easier to roll and stuff the burritos before placing it on the stove.

I left out the corn and used some broccoli slaw instead. Also only used one can of tomato sauce. I wasn't able to find hot tomato sauce, so i zipped mine up with  chili podwer, cumin, garlic, allspice and red pepper flakes. I also used whole black beans instead of refrieds. This has been very tasty to take for work lunches and they freeze well. Just bring the sour cream on the side to add after I nuke.

The burritos were excellent!! Although it was my first time making burritos and the first one was difficult to roll, I got the hang of it. Much healthier with turkey than beef. So A+ on this recipe :)

We added hot sauce to a bit more flavor. We also made extra and froze them for later! For freezing individually wrap each one in plastic wrap then put all burritos in a large plastic bag and freeze. To microwave unwrap one burrito and wrap in a paper towel and place on a plate. Cook for 4 min on 50% power, flip over and return to microwave at 50% for 2 addl minutes.

Excellent recipe!  I've made this turkey burrito three times in the past two months.  .I have received rave reviews from family and friends.  I did use two cans of rotel which boosts the hotness factor to just the right degree.  Not too spicy but not too bland.  If you want to bump up the flavor cook the tortilla shells in olive oil until they are perfectly browned then fill with all the toppings including sour cream and cheese.  It's a true party in your mouth.  A+ for this recipe.  Thanks!

this was awesome. my BF LOVED it and so did i. 
i used one can of hot tomato sauce (very good and adds flavor but as with all sauces it does contain a lot of salt) and used chopped fresh tomatoes. we try to eat pretty clean so there was no cheese or sour cream. used frozen corn defrosted in cool water (makes no difference i think) whole wheat tortilla from trader joes (yum!) i made my own refried beans in the slow cooker the night before with the "refried beans without the fry" (very easy!) recipe from this website. i did add cumin and chili powder and onion powder per recommendsations of others. thanks for the simple recipe it was fantastic!

My husband has never wolfed down quite so quickly.  I should mention that I added Penzey's Taco Seasoning (4 Tb per pound of meat) to this recipe, but followed everything else more or less.  At another review's suggestion, I popped mine in the oven for 7-8 minutes at 350 once I had assembled the burritos, and the cheese got nice and melty, the tortilla got a bit crisp, and everything melded together perfectly.  I would highly recommend this step for anyone with 10 extra minutes.  Easy and filling, thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed this one, we liked the taste of the meat mixture very well. I wasn't sure how the ground turkey would taste with the tomato sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised, it was great! I did add a little bit of cumin, but I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Thank you for posting this recipe, Gary!

Very good! Only thing I changed was I added chopped jalapenos because I love a little hot bite in almost everything. ;) Great taste blend though,and I guess you could use this for nachos,tacos,burritos,etc..! Love the corn in it! I thought about adding black beans too but didn't this time.

These were good and very fast and easy. I, like many others, could not find hot tomato sauce, so I put it about 1/4 c of frank's red hot and some chili powder to spice it up. Good weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing!

we tried this recipe tonight for dinner and it was excellent and super easy.  the only thing i did different is i used regular tomato sauce because i didn't have hot...and then just added jalopenos and some of the juice.  it was very good.  we will be making this again.  i recommend it for a quick, easy and delicious meal.

Good, lean dinner option.  Add your own additions for more flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes now for my family. It is easy to make up a bunch to freeze individually for a quick meal-just heat up in the microwave. I use regular tomato sauce so the kids will eat them (they LOVE them!). I have used black beans but I think the original refried beans taste the best. I also use the frozen roasted corn from trader joes for a delicious smoky flavor.

Very yummy. Used the tomato sauce with hot sauce added since I also coulnd't find the hot tomato sauce, and added a ton of hot sauce, some chili powder, jalapenos, and red pepper flakes. Still wasn't enough heat for us, but still want to make again and again.  A keeper for sure.

Oh wow, these were so simple yet so delicious!  I think the concensus is that no one can find hot tomato sauce.  I used the two cans of regular tomato sauce and added a generous amount of texax pete.  As another reviewer did, I assembled the burritos minus the sour cream and baked them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes, then spread the sour cream on top.  The cheese was melty and the shell a little crisp.  Perfection!

Like others, I couldn't find the tomato sauce.  What I did instead was spice up the turkey meat with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne, cilantro, and crushed red peppers.  I added some hot sauce to the regular tomato sauce as well.  I put cheese on top and melted it for a bit in the oven.  Yummy!

Good but not mind blowing... I checked 3 stores in my area and just could not find hot tomato sauce, so I was stuck with diced tomatoes and chiles... It was good, it was eaten... :) Thanks for sharing the recipe

I made these a couple of weeks ago for dinner and with the exception of my four-year-old, we all loved them!  I used Rotelle tomatoes in place of the hot tomato sauce like another reviewer suggested, simply because I already had them.  I also used refried black beans with lime!  Yum!  Definitely will be making these again!

Delicious and a great recipe for freezing!  I used whole wheat tortillas and a small can of tom. sauce and a can of tomatoes+diced chiles plus a dash of hot sauce and cumin. Also, frozen corn instead of canned.  I wrapped the burritos in foil and froze them (minus the sour cream, serve it on the side). When it was time to eat, just placed them in a baking dish, in the foil still, for about 30 min at 350 degrees. Yummy, and the kids agree!

This has become a new favorite of mine! It is so simple and inexpensive to make, yet it produces a delicious, healthy meal.  I didn't have to add any seasoning with the exception of my liking it spicy.  I added a big squirt of my favorite chili sauce - Sriracha Chili Sauce - to spice it up.  I have made this dish twice in the past two weeks, and froze some for later.  Even with such great results as it is, this recipe can be altered to suit everyone's palate (add black beans, cilantro, etc.). I found the hot tomato sauce in the "Mexican" food section. The cans are small and the brand I bought was El Pato (yellow can). I highly recommend using this sauce, as I will now be using it in other recipes!

As a grad student who seldom eats fast food (a nutrition grad student, that is), I like this dish because of the flexibility it provides. I can freeze the whole batch and cook up these tasty burritos whenever I need dinner in a hurry! I drained the ground turkey before combining with the corn and onions; also, I used salsa to give the sauce a kick.

It was outstanding with changes that I took from other reviewers: I used 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 can of diced tomatos with green chiles and 1/3 cup of medium salsa instead of two cans of hot tomato sauce.  I used black beans instead of refried.  I didn't warm the tortillas on the stove - I wrapped the burritos and then put them in the 350 oven for 7 minutes - they were perfect.  I also added just under one tablespoon each of cumin and chili pepper, and used whole wheat tortillas.

I made these as smothered burritos. Used green enchilada sauce for the smothering. I also used to a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies. I omitted the corn. Hubby loved them!

Great idea for healthier meal!  Instead of hot tomato sauce I used 1/3 cup Homemade Taco Sauce from this site combined with tomato sauce to make the 14 oz of liquid (added some cumin and  chipotle chili pepper too).  I cooked my onions at the same time as my turkey and used 1 bag of frozen corn  instead of 1 can.  Sub'd corn tortillas for the flour.  Per another reviewer suggestion, baked in oven for a few minutes for crispy effect.  Nice..

I've made this a couple of times per month for the past few months and my family loves it. It's easy, healthy, and filling. I find the hot tomato sauce (el Pato brand in the Mexican cooking section) to be a bit spicy for my taste and will substitute enchilada sauce sometimes. The hot tomato sauce definitely gives it good flavor though and my husband prefers that to the enchilada sauce. Sometimes I add a can of rotel. It is a great recipe as written though!

Substituted the hot tomato sauce with regular tomato sauce and the kids loved it. I thought it was a little bland with the regular tomato sauce, but I just added a little hot sauce to spice it up.

We had these tonight and my son loved them.  I did not use the hot tomato sauce since I was afraid it would be too spicy for my kids, 6 & 8 years.  I used regular taco seasoning. That was a good choice because they ate them all.  I did not use corn or sour cream, just used what I had on hand. My kids like their food more plain.  Nonetheless, they were delicious and cheesy and we topped with lettuce & chopped tomato.

Made this with venison. Hot tomato sauce is not available where I live, so I used Rotel tomato sauce with green chiles. Absolutely fabulous!!

Everyone in my family loved this recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly but I assembled it differently because I was short on time.  I used one can of Rotel hot tomato sauce and one jar of salsa because it was in my fridge needing to be used and I wasn't sure how my kids would react to the heat of the hot tomato sauce.  While the turkey and onion were browning, I divided the can of refried beans among 8 8-inch burritos to help them stick when I rolled them. I added the corn to the turkey & onion mixture and spooned it on the burritos.  I then heated up the tomato sauce and salsa and poured it over top of the burritos.  I baked it at 350 for about 7 minutes.  I'm not sure I would do it this way again as the burritos were soft, not crispy but I did not want to take the time for the tomato sauce mixture to thicken because my kids were hungry NOW!

I've never reviewed any of the recipes from this site before (even though I love and use many of them)... but wanted to jump on the Gary's Turkey Burritos train. The great thing about this recipe is that you can make it as written or substitute and adapt it to what you have on hand or to your family's taste.You can also adjust the amount of fat and calories to your diet and taste.  My adult sons loved them. Hubby missed out because he is deer hunting. (Sorry, honey, I tried to save you one but no such luck). This will certainly become a frequent meal at our house. Thanks Gary!

We used half enchilada sauce and half tomato sauce and eliminated the onion since my hubby is not a big fan. They were just delicious! Wonderful recipe =)

I think this recipe is delicious and my husband agreed.  It needed a little something though so I added some chili powder, lime juice, and a touch of cholula sauce and it was AWESOME!

My husband and I are believers now, these are incredible!  I followed the directions exactly.  I used Brooks brand Just For Chili Tomato Sauce Medium with Onions 15 oz can.  We topped it off with Franks Red Hot which added a little extra kick.  This was a big hit!

I though these were great as a burrito, but then I thought it would be even better as a pizza! I used refrigerated pizza dough in a deep dish baking stone. Cooked the burrito's as instructed, and then poured the mixture into the pizza crust, sprinkled the cheese on top and baked for 15 minutes. It was pretty awesome!

These burritos were very good. I also didn't find hot tomato sauce, so I added regular tomato sauce and homemade taco seasoning. Also, as suggested I baked for a few minutes just to make it nice and crispy. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I love to make burritos for my lunches. I individually wrap them and then freeze. I left out the onion, refried beans and sour cream. I added a can of garbanzo beans and lots of Tabasco. I also added garlic powder, rosemary and lots of black pepper. Super good!

I had ground chicken and was looking for a new recipe to try--I am so glad I found this one. Other things I did differently: I used refried black beans with lime. I used regular tomato sauce with few dashes of Cholula. (note that you only need 14 ounces of tomato sauce. I almost opened two 15 ounce cans.) I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked them without the sour cream for about 8 minutes to get the ingredients melted and the tortillas crispy. I topped them off with sour cream combined with fresh chopped cilantro.   This recipe made 9 burritos using 8" tortillas. I flash-froze the remaining assembled burritos for another night. Yum! Thank you, Gary!

I used left-over shredded chicken for this recipe. This burrito is very filling and does remind me of a burrito you would find in a Mexican restaurant. I used fresh tortillas from Costco. For those of you having trouble finding the hot tomato sauce, look for the words  "Salsa di Chile Fresco" on the bright yellow cans by El Pato, in the Mexican isle of your store. The cans are marked in both English and Spanish but sometimes the store faces the can with the Spanish side out, so you might be missing the product.

These were really good and easy to make.  I never heard of hot tomato sauce, so I used 1 can of regular sauce and then filled the can with salsa and added that.  I used frozen corn b/c that is what I had.  I wrapped the burritos and baked them with a little cheese on the inside and more sprinkled on top.  Served with sour cream and hot sauce on the side.  Also used whole wheat tortillas.  Loved them and will make again for sure!

These are SO good! We adjusted a few things, added diced chiles to the turkey mixture, along with regular tomato sauce and then used hot sauce so we could control the temp.  Also, I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350, then added a colby/monterey cheese mix for the last 5 minutes. Served with homeade guacamole, sr cream and salsa. All the boys loved it! Will be keeping this one, thanks!!!!

I've made these several times now. The whole family loves them. We add a few Mexican spices to the turkey (not too much because we have a toddler). I really like the texture of the corn and refried beans. (On a side note, I used regular refried beans. There is almost no fat in them anyway -- half a gram per serving. There is no calorie difference at all between fat free and regular refried beans. I didn't really see the point of making a low fat version.)

These were a really great change from the normal chicken or beef burritos. I added a 4 oz can of diced green chiles to the corn, turkey mixture.  I put everything into the tortilla, rolled them and then
topped then with cheese.  I baked them at 350 for about 17 minutes.

I will make this again to see if I can up the flavor.  I used ground beef, because that's all I had.  Used 1 can of regular tomato sauce and about 1/2 cup of salsa instead of the hot tomato sauce.  And added about 1 tbsp Southwestern Seasoning. Will probably add more seasoning next time. Loved the corn flavor in the dish!

Very good!  I season the turkey, use Del Monte canned tomatoes with mild chilies pepper, and fiesta blend shredded cheese. I've made this recipe several times.

Very quick, easy recipe. I did add some cumin & a touch of chili powder. To save a step I added the fat-free refried beans directly to the meat mixture.

We ate these but none of my crew were overly impressed with them.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe and used leftover turkey from Thankgiving so maybe that was the difference.  They had good flavor but weren't something I'd fix again.

This was yummy - I added some ADOBO seasoning to spice it up a bit...a big hit with my family.  Even my 5 year old ate it up!

This recipe was just okay.  The hubby kinda liked it but the flavor was quite bland and a bit tomato-y for a burrito recipe.
