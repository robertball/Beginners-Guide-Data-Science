This was so enjoyed by everyone last night Fiestaqueen! I added garlic and onion powders to the meat, due to allergies, left out the carrot and used pinto beans instead of the kidney. The real fun came in when I took large Burrito size tortillas and made taco salad bowls. I inverted two small metal mixing bowls and sprayed them with cooking spray. I then sprayed both sides of the tortillas and placed them on top of the bowls and kept smoothing the top and sides until they formed to the bowls. Popped them in a 355 degree oven until they were golden and crispy. They came out great and once cooled I piled in the salad, used H.V. Spicy Ranch Dressing and topped with shredded cheddar. Thank you so much!

Really great recipe.  I used black beans instead and added some corn for an extra bit of flavor.  I also added extra salsa, green onion, and a bit of lime juice squeezed over the finished product. Delish!

Quick and tasty! I used homemade taco seasoning which pretty much contains all the spices listed, and served with a dollop of sour cream.  I did add just a bit of tomato sauce to the meat as it seemed a little dry.  Having leftovers tonight - this will be a regular for us!

I always made taco salad without a recipe, but one day I started having trouble with the taco sesoning making it too salty. Once I put enough into my meat to taste it was way too salty. I searched allrecipes and found this recipe. I used sausage instead of turkey and also used black beans. The spices are key. There is lots of flavor without the extra salt. You can add whatever veggies you please. I always sprinkle w/ Doritos just b4 serving. The best I ever made!!!

After doing a dinner search "healthy ground turkey" I came across this gem.  My fiance LOVES Mexican style food so i figured why not.  I ran out of chili powder so I used homemade taco seasoning (see Walt's taco seasoning) instead of the recommended spices. I also add a small can of green chilis.  I used Romaine lettuce and omitted the carrots and bell pepper  (because that's what I had in the house).  Finished the plate off with some cold salsa on top and sprinkled with green onions.  It was excellent!  I will most definitely make this again.

Very good!  I made as is except used a can of chili beans instead of plain kidney beans.  Topped our salads with tomatoes, olives, yellow peppers, and green onions, then served at the table with extra salsa and sour cream.  I will definitely be making this again!

Love making this...and eating it. I made it for a party this weekend and everyone thought it was great. More so, they couldn't tell that it was turkey instead of beef because of the seasoning. This is one of my favorite dishes

This is great for a quick weeknight dinner.  I halved the chili powder for my daughter, but she ended up not liking it anyway, so next time I'll just use the full amount.  I used corn instead of beans and subbed roasted green chiles in place of the salsa.  Served with sour cream and taco sauce.

Good basic recipe!  I made changes due to what I had on hand and the fact I was not in the mood to cut up so many things.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and added a small can of green chiles - did not drain.  Omitted the pepper, and carrots.  Used fava beans instead of kidney beans.  Omitted the salsa.  Added ancho chili powder(with regular chili powder), parsley, garlic, a pinch of salt, dried chives and dried onion to the meat mixture.  Plating: corn tortilla chips, lettuce, the meat mixture and then added Mexican cheese, a bit of taco sauce, sour cream and sliced black olives.

These were fantastic!! They are kind of spicy, though, so if you don't like spicy food you should be careful of how much chili powder and pepper you add.

I made a few adjustments just because of what I had in the kitchen and personal preference. Firstly, I used two cups of salsa instead of one because the meat mixture was too dry for my taste. I used black beans instead of kidney beans, black pepper instead of cayenne pepper and a bag salad mix while some ate it on soft taco shells. I will definitely make this again!

I salted the turkey as it cooked.  Also substituted pinto for kidney beans.  Very good.

I used 1 can of chili beans with 1 tsp. oregano and a pinch of cayenne, instead of the kidney beans and spices. All the rest was the same as written. It was very tasty!  Also good the next day as chili with cheese and corn chips! Will use this a a regular addition to our weekly menus.  Good recipe!

I didn't have all the ingredients; but this is a recipe, you are able to customize with what you do have. Even my non salad eating son ate this. Used tortilla chips crushed with everything on top. Was great and will be one of the mainstays in our monthly cooking.

This was pretty good.  My husband said it needed more of a "kick".  I was worried it was going to be too spicy, but it wasn't.  I was using it for tacos instead of a salad, so I didn't do the lettuce or carrots.  I sauteed bell peppers with the onion before adding the turkey. I didn't add the garlic (I used 4 cloves) until the turkey was almost browned.  Instead of salsa, I did 1/4 cup tomato paste, 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/2 cup water and 1 Tbl. Apple Cider Vinegar.
It was pretty bland until I added some sea salt to bring out the flavors.  I enjoyed it and my kids loved it!  Next time I may add a little more cayenne to spice things up a bit.  
I did use 1 1/2 lbs. of ground turkey which may have spread out the flavor a bit.  Maybe it would have been spicy enough had I only used 1 lb.

Good flavors overall.  Since iceberg lettuce has minimal nutritional value, I used mixed baby greens instead.

Loved the spices and added salsa to the meat portion of this recipe!  I did skip the beans added to the meat, just personal preference.  I added a few more goodies to the salad, avocado, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, olives and tortilla chips.  I dressed with Dorothy Lynch dressing from this site, delicious!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

We liked this easy lunch. I used dried minced onion but ran out so added some powder too and used ground chuck instead of turkey. I thought this might be a little too spicy for hubby's tastes, but it was just right. I left out the beans at my husband's request. I only had half the salsa so I added a little beef stock to make up the difference. Nice flavor in this dish. Thanks we enjoyed this.

Recipe was pretty good.  I used a mixture of greens and didn't have carrots so I left them out.  My husband really liked the flavor.

My family loved this! My husband doesn't eat onions or green peppers so I left those out. Also, I used double the amount of salsa, topped it with sour cream, and served tortilla chips on the side. It's simple and delicious!

I liked this recipe.  I used black beans instead of kidney, and used my own home-made salsa.  Next time I would add some more heat, and serve with some light sour cream dolloped on top as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I just tried this recipe and it was definitely a good, healthy alternative.  I was very surprised at how well I liked it.  I did add about a cup of extra salsa as it looked to dry and also added steamed corn for some extra color and flavor.  I will make this again.

Unfortunately, I had to make this recipe without the carrots and bell peppers because I didn't have any.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as stated and must say it came out delicious! All of the dry seasonings, along with the onion and garlic, are what you would typically find in taco seasoning.  I thought the dish might need some salt, but found it was perfect without adding any.  I added low fat shredded cheese to my serving and used a little La Victoria Red Taco Sauce as a dressing.  Thanks for sharing!

I would give this a 4.5 if I could. It was delicious. I love the use of actual spices instead of the all too common taco seasoning packet. I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the carrots. The only thing I will change next time is to use black beans instead of kidney,. This recipe is a keeper.

We have had this twice, now, and love it.  Only change - used more salsa for a moister result, left out the green peppers (neither of us likes them).  Otherwise, great dish!

This recipe is simple to make and smells great, the color content is very high, making it very appealing to the eye.  I cut the chili powder to 1 tbsp and substituted Paprika for the 2nd tbsp. I omitted the cumin by 1/8th tsp. and added diced tomatoes and italian salad dressing as a substitute for the salsa.  I didn' use the chili anything because I've a daughter that cannot abide chili at all.  Very good recipe and my finicky eaters LOVED it!!!!  Will Definitely be making again!
