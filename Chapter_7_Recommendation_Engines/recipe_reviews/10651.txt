A real winner-tastes like Subway's cookies, although my cooking time was only 6 to 8 minutes in a gas oven.  They would've been black if I cooked them the recommended amount of time.

I found these cookies to be extremely disappointing. The texture was dry and the cookies rather tasteless. I even tried adding coconut and other ingredients to liven them up a bit, but nothing seemed to help.

I found these to be really dry.  I had to add a 1/2 cup of water, and then when I baked them, they had the consistency of bisquick biscuits.  I think the recipe left out brown sugar.

Not bad. Had to lower oven temp to 350. Still crunchy :(
