Love this recipe! I make scones every time baking day rolls around with my sourdough starter. I use part whole wheat flour and add about 3/4 cup buttermilk with the starter. Also I divide the dough in half and add mini chocolate chips to one half and dried fruit to the other half.

This is a delicious way to use some of my favorite Sourdough Starter. I've made this recipe twice in four days already. Today I used 1 tsp cinnamon and after blending in the butter I stirred in 2 Tbsp milk and 1 small (peeled & chopped) apple and the results were amazing!!!

Light and fluffy!  I used baking powder instead of the cream of tarter.  Taste is delicate!

These were yummy tender and rose high. I followed the recipe except used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 bread flour and added about 1/4 C of whole milk to the dough. Everyone's starter is going to vary in moisture content so you may need to tweak this part and add more liquid to the dough to make it come together. Before baking I brushed with milk and sprinkled heavily with raw sugar (demerara). I think any kind of sugar would add a pleasantly crunchy top. I also baked them at night and re-warmed them in a toaster oven for breakfast. Love that spice! We had jam but ended up eating them plain as they were sooo good as is.

Being new to sourdough, having only made sourdough bread, I wanted a simple recipe for my first sourdough recipe outside of bread making. The positive reviews encouraged me as there are quite a few sourdough recipes of various yummy things out there! What I liked about the recipe is that the ingredients are simple so most of the time you already have the ingredients in the pantry (and its a basic recipe so you can change your additions each time with confidence. I changed the number of servings to eight and they still came out lovely! It is a easy, quick and delicious way to use the excess starter. I left out the spice and instead added fresh dates broken up into pieces which gave a lovely flavour and blended nicely into the scone. My dough was a little dry so I added some kefir milk and brushed the top of the scone with kefir milk (didnt add the sugar). They rose beautifully, browned nicely and even formed a little crust and cracking as bread would on the surface. Light, fluffy with a lovely flavour! Moist enough and flavourful enough to grab one the go, not needing any filling or even butter! Great, reliable recipe! :-)

Excellent recipe! I have been looking for sourdough recipes since I developed my own starter (equal parts flour and water fed daily for 5 days then refrigerated and fed weekly). I used baking powder instead of cream of tartar and I used coarse sea salt in place of regular salt. I topped with milk as suggested and added brown rock sugar. The taste is incredible! Even my husband ate them and he is very picky about baked goods. This is a great way to use my sourdough starter thanks!

I'VE MADE THESE SCONES SEVERAL TIMES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOUR. ALL HAVE TURNED OUT GREAT. OUR FAVORITE IS WHOLE RYE FLOUR. THE BAKING TIME IS USUALLY MUCH SHORTER THAN NOTED IN RECIPE USUALLY ABOUT 1/2... SO JUST GO BY LOOK AND FEEL OF THE SCONES. IT'S ALSO A GREAT WAY TO USE UP LEFT OVER SOURDOUGH STARTER. ADDING A HANDFUL OF DRIED FRUIT PIECES ALSO MAKES IT DELICIOUS!!

Will not disappoint. Really good. I added some raisins I added a little bit of cinnamon a sprinkle of nutmeg and touch of cardamom because I did not have apple pie spice. I probably did not add more that a teaspoon of the three combined. I warmed the butter to make it easier to mix and then whisked in the milk to the hot butter before adding. It was not too dry. It is a recipe that I will look forward to making again. Thank you!

Wonderful and easy.  I made them using pumpkin pie spice instead of apple pie spice.   Turn out great.  Going to try them with the apple pie spice and some apple chuncks next.  I think there are endless possibilities with this basic recipe.  Always loves to find new ways to use my sourdough starter.

I tweaked this recipe to make a more traditional english scone to be served with jam and cream, by omitting the apple pie spice and replacing the 1/2 cup sugar with only 1 teaspoon of sugar (as my starter is already quite sweet).  Also, my starter is thick so I needed to add about 1/4 cup of milk to make the dough come together.  I also cut the dough into small rounds, but forgot to decrease the baking time (oops!).  Nevertheless, these were a huge hit at a baby shower and several people have asked for the recipe and for their own sourdough starter.  This is a very easy recipe, thanks!

I have been looking for a sourdough scone recipe and was so happy to find this one!  I admit I haven't tried it as written--I don't keep apple pie spice in the house.  Instead, I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts and the rind of 3 lemons.  I used the juice from the lemons to brush on the top of the scones before adding sugar crystals to the top of the scones.  Lemon-Walnut Scones were scrumptious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great base recipe to use for whatever kind of scones you like to make! I have made lots of scones but never sourdough. If you've never made scones before the batter should be very wet. Add milk until it's as wet as possible while still being manageable. For the version I made today I used half whole wheat pastry flour/half bread flour and omitted the apple pie spice. I patted out the dough into one large rectangle and spread frozen raspberries over it lightly pressing them in. I then folded the dough in thirds (like a letter) and patted it into a log cutting the scones into triangles. I brushed with melted butter sprinkled with sugar and baked on 2 large sheets according to directions.

So good! I made this with Whole Wheat salt Baking Powder Baking Soda Sugar Coconut Oil English Lavender and Lemon-Balm Mint and Sourdough Starter. They turned out perfect moist and slightly dense just as they should be! I cut the dough into eight squares and then cut each square into four triangles. Ending up with 32 mini scones perfect size for kids!

These were very good! I am new to the whole sourdough starter and was looking to try different recipes. I was surprised they didn't need any eggs. I made a half batch and used 3/4 cup white wheat flour and 1/2 cup AP flour. Oh didn't have apple pie spice so i just sprinkled pumpkin pie spice in the batter. I made a glaze to put on top once cooled.(used baking powder insteae of cream of tarter- didn't have any) Very fluffy scones.

These are delicious. The apple pie spice (which I didn't have but mixed myself using a recipe on this web site) lends a very delicate flavor. I only give 4 stars because the bottoms burned. I'm not an experienced enough baker to know if it's that the heat was too high in the oven but I make a lot of cookies etc. and haven't burned the bottoms of anything before.

Super easy and a great way to use up excess starter. Used baking powder instead of cream of tartar halved recipe and made them savoury by skipping the sugar and adding a pinch of cayenne and mustard to the flour mix then grated cheddar and minced spring onions along with the sourdough starter. Topped with grated cheese and cooked for ten minutes and they are FAB. Will be making again and again playing with the flavours.

They turned out delicious. I didn't have cream of tarter so used equivalent amount of baking powder. I added 1/4 c water 2 tbsp. kombucha instead of the milk. 1/2 cup of raisins.

This recipe is very dry. In fact I thought something was missing. I placed the ingredients in the stand mixer to mix put it on stir and added a heaping tablespoon of plain yoghurt one at a time until the dough came together. The recipe then came out fine. You could probably also use sour cream or perhaps whole milk or cream.

Very nice basic scone recipe and a great way to use us some extra sourdough starter. The second time I made them I increased the butter and used 6T. to add a little bit more moisture. I would love to try and add some blueberries next time:-)

I use regular flour and exclude the cream of tartar (not something I have lying around) - and they come out great! I love them. Chewier than a regular scone but so delicious.

Second time I've made these scones. This time I cut sugar to 1/4 Cup. Cut cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. Used 1/2 Cup hard margarine instead of shortening. Used 1 teaspoon baking powder instead of cream of tartar. Dough seemed a little dry so I added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of milk. Didn't bother with topping. Used medium cookie cutter. Yield 18 exactly. No waste.  Absolutely delicious.  Great recipe.  Will use it again.

The flavor was great, the batter was rather dry and I needed to add a good bit of liquid to make this work. I used the whole milk that I had handy and added until the dough was appropriately mushy and barely workable.

Loved the flavor and will definitely make these again and keep some in the freezer.  I added a sprinkling of milk to the shaggy dough because it was way to dry for me but that worked fine. Living in the desert affects our flour. Craisins are a great addition.

I found this recipe and was excited to find an easy use for the growing amount of sourdough starter in my home especially when I don't have the time or energy to make loaf bread. The results - the texture of my scones was not what I expected. They were more like risen yeast rolls rather than the crumbling texture of most scones Ive eaten. They were tasty though. The spice mixture was excellent (like others I made my own apple pie seasoning). I added dried cranberries which were a delicious addition also. I will make again but wonder if others had the same experience with the texture and how I might come closer to the typical scone.

Not bad at all. I didn't have apple pie spice so used a mixture of cinnamon cloves allspice etc. and then I put cinnamon sugar on the top. I think I'll add some fruit next time for some extra texture.

Finally a way to use up my starter that I can do quickly and with little mess! Made with pumpkin pie spice rather than apple; probably will increase spice amount next time. PS Do not save some aside to bake a few days later the starter mix will get moldy!

These are delightful. What a great use for sourdough starter (one can only eat so much bread!). I only got 12 scones though and some of those were thinner than they should have been. I think 8 would have been a better number.

These came out wonderful! Perfect amount of spice. I used Einkorn flour I left the dough a little wet and made 12 "drop biscuits". Einkorn likes to be a little sticky or it will be too dry. I used 1 cup sourdough starter with one egg. I also added 1/2 cup raisins. Brushed the scones with milk and sprinkled coarse sugar on top. Took exactly 15 min to bake at high altitude. Thank You for this recipe will make again!

A terrific go to scone recipe. I halve it and use my throwaway starter (usually a little over half a cup)....lots of possible variations. Like others I often sub baking powder for cream of tartar because that's what's on hand.

Made these for brunch this am. This recipe is a keeper! I left of the apple pie spice and did half chocolate chips and half blueberry lemon- both were fabulous. I forgot to sprinkle them with sugar so I made a glaze and drizzled it over the top. Gave them just the right amount of sweetness.

Very very good! A great use of my sourdough starter. The kids loved it... especially with butter and jam. My only wish was that the tops browned more but I may need to move my rack higher in the oven next time.

One important piece of info the recipe does not provide is the hydration level of the "sourdough starter". This is not a standard term and starters can vary greatly. Peter Reinhart's Artisan Breads Everyday for example uses a stiff starter (75% hydration ) while some starters are very liquid.

I added a cup of mix-ins (a dried fruit compote) and had to bake it a little longer (20 mins total) due to the extra moisture but they sure are tasty.  I got 18 scones, and will added it to my  set of tried and true sourdough starter recipes.

Followed suggestion to swap baking powder for the cream of tartar and didn't have apple pie spice so I used cinnamon. They weren't pretty but tasted delicious!! I will definitely make them again

An absolute sticky mess to make without adding extra flour (can't roll it out) but they turn out moist and chewy that way... just scrape mounds of dough onto baking sheet and bake 12 minutes. I sometimes add a teasp. of ginger nutmeg cinnamon and molasses in place of apple pie spice... and throw in a couple handfuls of freeze-dried strawberries (or other fruit)... put simply this is something I (and my dog too) can't live without!

Very good! I followed the recipe as is except drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over them after they were baked. These were moist and fluffy - Kids and hubby both enjoyed them. The apple pie flavor was a bit subtle for my liking next time I might try to boost it up a bit.

delicious! due to another's comment on flour i used 1/2 spelt flour and not bread flour i usually add vital gluten to my unbleached flour. i brushed tops with buttermilk and put craisins on the top. no sugar on top. these are great! thank you for the recipe.

I thought these were really good and easy to make. I used frozen butter (which I also do with biscuits) and tried not to over mix the dough. They were a hit with the adults and kids I shared them with. I made the recipe as it was written and look forward to trying different additions/flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

A little bit dry but great with coffee or tea. Will make it again as is but may also try raisins and maybe walnuts.

Made these a few times with to-be-discarded sourdough starter; always turned out pretty good. Tried adding an extra cup of flour 1 cup of frozen blueberries 1/2 tsp of baking powder and removed the apple spice; turned to be a pretty decent variation.

I've made this twice now we really love these for breakfast or snack. I added half a chopped up Apple which I sprinkled with part of the sugar and cinnamon before adding the sourdough starter.

I LOVE this! I don't always feel like making bread when I need to use sourdough. These were incredibly easy and are wonderful! My picky eaters even love them we've eaten them with jelly or with peanut butter too. I'm looking forward to next week when I have enough sourdough starter so I can try putting different things in them!

Made 1/2 a recipe for 8 scones. Added 1/2 C of buttermilk because my starter is like 'the blob' thick. Used cinnamon nutmeg and cardamon (for a grand total of 1/2 teaspoon all together). They came out lovely:) and ooh so good. Thanks for the recipe.

The scones are chewy almost gummy rather than flaky or light. I won't be making it again.

Loved them! I usually don’t appreciate the reviews where ingredients were changed,  but a recipe I’d used previously is no longer online. So I skipped the spice and used dried cherries and white chips. Whole family gave rave reviews

I’d give it 5 stars, except for the fact that the dough was too dry to form, until I added 2-3 tsp water. Then it went together well and the scones came out great. I will make them again, but add something more to flavor them a bit. They’re pretty plain.
