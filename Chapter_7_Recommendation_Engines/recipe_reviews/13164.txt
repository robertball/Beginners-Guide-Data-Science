This was surprisingly good.  Served it to two people who said "cabbage is not my thing" and both said they would enjoy it again.  Nice flavor, I served it with garlic/rosemary bread - warm, and a tossed salad.

This was really tasty! What to do when you have stewing beef but the only vegetable left in the house is cabbage? More like a very chunky soup, the meat was so tender, and the flavours all merged together deliciously. Great with some crusty bread to sop up the broth.

We tried this today and loved it - will definitely be making it again. It gave the cabbage a wonderful flavour!

One of my favorite recipes on this site... I don't know why this isn't more popular.  The wine and bacon flavors blend to make the meat and cabbage melt-in-your-mouth amazing.

A bit confusing, but worth a try! I used stew beef. I fried the bacon like I normally do and chopped it up. I boiled the cabbage in a large pot, then I used that pot to do everything else on the stove. I didn't have an onion so I added a whole bunch of garlic and sauteed that with the bacon in the pot. I kept everything stirred up the whole time. It was really great. The smell while it was cooking was amazing and it tasted even better than it smelled. Definitely a great rainy or snowy day meal.

I completely agree with the reviewer marvelling that this wasn't more popular -- this is easy and delicious! the flavors are rich and smoky. My brisket was extra tough so I cooked it longer, otherwise everything was to the letter.

This dish was tasty and so easy to make especially since I made it in a crock pot. The meat was tender and flavourful.

Despite reading a few different reviews that the cabbage was good, I was extremely skeptical since i really dislike cabbage. But in this dish, it actually turned out very well. 

I would make this again.
