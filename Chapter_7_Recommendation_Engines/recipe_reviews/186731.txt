I have more of a question than a review: Does anyone know what the Chinese make the crispy dough with? Or how they make it? That was the best part of the crepe for me and I'm curious to try it.

I can't wait to make this! I LOVE this dish.

This was very good!  The only thing I would change about this recipe is to increase the amount of batter and use 1.5 times as much as directed, and add chopped preserved mustard tubers since all the ones I ate in China had those ingredients.  Very good adapted recipe for the home kitchen!
