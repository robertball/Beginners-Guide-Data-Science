This recipe was pretty good. I couldn't bear to microwave it, but I just put it on a skillet as directed and otherwise followed everything faithfully. It was lovely and still easy dish. To make it more perfect, next time I'll add a bit more of the seasoning.

Quick, easy and tastes great with not only salmon, but other fish. Great over basmati rice or angel hair pasta. Yum:)

I was desperate for a quick lunch for my kids, so I grabbed one salmon filet to defrost while I read the directions.  I followed the directions with the exception I have no idea what the fish weighed, and I had no tomatoes.  I wish I had stopped cooking it at 4 minutes ( I should have considered microwave wattage), next time I will.  My salmon overcooked just a little, but it was very tasty and I served my 3 preschoolers leftover rice with the salmon and the drippings with microwave steamed broccoli.  Not having to cook the rice, this lunch was remarkably health conscious, cost efficient and most of all time efficient.  It took less than 15 minutes from start of prep to serve time. (I heated the rice and steamed the broccoli at the same time I was prepping the fish)    But the absolute best part?  Not one drop remained, and three kids ready for a nap!  The only drawback was that it was not visually appealing...which might have been my lack of tomatoes!    Overall, a great hit with the under 5 crowd...I can't wait to try it on the older guys.     Thanks so much for posting.

Extremely quick & flavorful. You really need to know your microwave for this. My salmon was already partially cedar-plank cooked (although the middle was too red for me) so I did the onion/tomato mixture for 3 minutes by themselves. I felt that really cooked them too much, the tomatoes were total mush. I threw the salmon on top for about 2 minutes at 50% power. It finished cooking the salmon and gave me a nice, fresh tasting sauce to eat with it. Next time, the tomatoes will go in at a later time. But, overall it was a great, easy, healthy tasting dish. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was amazingly simple and yummy. I substituted apple juice for the wine and added fresh garlic and fresh ginger and some chopped avocado  when it was done. Delish!

Just okay. I made it as stated and it could use the full onion and probably two whole tomatoes. I wouldn't make again.
