Rolls were very good flavor, texture, slices nicely. However the folding into rolls was a bit confusing and I think I would just shape by hand into buns the next time. They held the beef juices well and made a large sandwish. The milk and egg wash really helped the salt and  caraway seeds stick well.

My mother is from Germany and it's great to be able to make for her some of the things she misses so dearly.  These were awesome and didn't last long in a household with 4 kids! Thanks!

An excellent alternative to flying to Buffalo for weck rolls! You must definitely top the rolls with coarse salt or seeds though! I want a beef on weck sandwich now!

Oh, man. I had a WORLD of problems with these. I feel obligated to tell you they were all MY fault, so take this review as a warning not to do what I did. Now, I've got a lot going on this weekend, so I was not giving this anywhere close to the attention I should have been, and that's what caused the most trouble. I dropped the measuring spoon into the bowl of water, sugar, and yeast. If you've ever done the same, you know that the yeast clumps to EVERYTHING, fingers included. I *think* I was able to make up for what came out with my hand and the spoon, but who really knows? Then, I went to beat the egg whites, and in a fit of laziness, I didn't wash the beaters after mixing the yeast water with the first portion of flour.  Big mistake, as after 10 minutes on high, they never even made soft peaks. I added them anyway, for lack of eggs to replace them with. At which point I read the next step and, oops. Bread flour? So, I did a little research and learned that all purpose flour could be substitued, but the end result wouldn't have the extra chewy goodness. Figuring everything else that I screwed up already, I used what I had. But I didn't use anywhere near 7 cups.  After about 5.5 it just wouldn't take anymore flour.  I'm baking it anyway; its on its first rising now, and I'm sure it will be edible. That said, even screwed up, it was a lot of work! I'd love to see the end results of the actual recipe, but I just don't see myself putting in that kind of time and effort.

This is the fourth year I've made these rolls for a gathering of about thirty friends. They're well liked every year. You really need to take almost a whole day to make them from start to finish, so plan ahead. Last year, I got started a little too late and had to skip the last rising, but they still turned out well.

Very good rolls, I didn't realize until they were done that they are for sandwiches.  I was expecting a type of dinner roll.  I think I'll make them smaller next time and see how they do.  But they are a little crunchy on the outside and so soft on the inside, everyone loved them!!

I tried, really I did, but I couldn't make the rolls look right. They kept turning into a barely recognizable lump of dough when I tried to fold them into the traditional looking weck (or kummelweck for those who know them by their original name). After a while I got frustrated and just formed them into rolls and cut the spiraled look into the tops of them. They tasted good, but they I just couldn't get them shaped right.

Thank you so much for the recipe Holly!  I was getting sick of lugging a bag full of weck rolls from Buffalo to Texas everytime I visited.  My family who craves beef on weck thanks you too!

I've been making these for years for my family, and they're a lot of work (so they don't come often) but they're worth it!  I usually add 1/2 a brick of aged sharp cheddar cheese to the dough, and then sprinkle more cheese on top after brushing with the egg wash.  Cheese buns, better that the grocery store, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.

These have a great taste, just like the ones I could get in WI!  Watch the raisings, as the dough raised much faster than specified.  The eggs whites much be the secret to these authentic "hard rolls".

This is the best Kaiser Roll recipe I have come across. I have made this twice and still working on getting the air pockets out. Tried to attach a photo of my work of art but did not go through. This recipe is so much fun to make and the result might not look like a bakery item but darn close.

These are perfect rolls for sandwiches. I shaped mine like kaiser rolls and topped them with caraway seeds and coarse salt. We made sandwiches using rare roast beef, horseradish, and gravy. I cut the recipe in half and ended up with 8 large rolls. Yum!

You definitely need some time on your hands to make these, or at least some stuff to do around the house during all the rises, but the beautiful results and the taste are worth the trouble. These look fabulous in the end.

I broke my mixer making this. :-( it took me two hours to mix by hand. My oven only has one rack, so the ice part isn't easy. They took over 25 minutes to bake in the oven.

I have made this recipe twice and my husband and I just love it!!  The rolls come out firm enough to hold up to juicy, Italian beef or sloppy pulled pork. It take almost all day to make them, but it's worth it.

Umm, took forever to mix ingredients together in a mixer. These take all day since you have to let them rise 4 times, and the folding was brutal. They kept coming apart. I tried so many times they stopped rising! Tasted good though. Maybe I'll be more successful the next time
