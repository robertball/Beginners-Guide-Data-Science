I made this for my boyfriend to accompany his steak, and he liked the shrimp a lot better than the steak itself (and he still really liked the steak). I only made 1 skewer, so I scaled back on the marinade mixture a lot. Instead of jerk seasoning, I used Cajun seasoning because I had some on hand. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I didn't eat them because I'm a vegetarian, but I have to admit they smelled great!

This was pretty good.  I made it according to the recipe but scaled back a bit on the spicy stuff.  It took longer than five minutes on each side on the grill. Made it with Roasted Vegetables on this site (AWESOME)and margaritas.  Thanks.

These were very good.  We had them for our Good Friday dinner and I bought large wild pink shrimp at Wegmans that were very easy to peel (they were pre-deveined) and I marinated them for several hours.  I put them on bamboo skewers that I had soaked for several hours in water.  My husband grilled them until they were done and I served them with pineapple coleslaw.  The only thing missing was some sort of light sauce.  They were flavorful but I missed having a sauce to dip the shrimp into.  I will certainly make again!

I could not find any jerk seasoning, so I also substituted Cajun seasoning. Personally, I really liked this, a very good balance of flavors. My husband however did not like this, as he thought that the flavors masked the flavor of the shrimp too much. (He does tend to like things pretty plain though!)

good taste. I added a lot more of the spice and some chopped jalapeno to make it spicier. I do wish it wasn't so runny, I would love to keep some on the side for dipping the shrimp but it's not quite thick enough.

This is so yummy! I couldn't find jerk seasoning so I used a jerk sauce in place of the seasoning. I'm making them again tonight.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have jerk spice so I used cajun and they were so yummy. I marinated the shrimp overnight and the flavor was fabulous.

YUMMO!  This was great!  I followed the recipe, and I added a tad bit of garlic powder.  My shrimp only marinated for about 45 minutes and were cooked on a George Foreman.  Served on top of Bamati (sp?) rice w/ Hoppin' John as a side dish (it's New Year's Day), this served as a balanced savory, sweet, & spicy dish that was refreshing for the month of January.  I can't wait to make this at future BBQs this summer served w/ pineapples on the skewer w/ the shrimp.

p.s. This marinade would also be great w/ salmon.

I followed the recipe exactly and the shrimp cooked perfectly (although I think I only grilled them a total of about 4 minutes and they were done). However, I found the shrimp WAY too sweet. Granted, the recipe calls for honey, and the description said tangy and sweet, but it tasted way too sugary for me. I guess I was thinking it would have just a little sweetness like jerk-flavored food. It needed much less honey and more soy sauce or something. I had trouble with the shrimp sticking to the grill, so more than 1 tsp. of oil would help. I won't make this again.

Yum!!  Marinated precooked shrimp for 4 hours and cooked them on a grill pan.  Smoky for inside cooking (similar to blackening seasoning) but I liked how the marinade on the shrimp caramelized.

I used cooked jumbo shrimp and it was still to die for!  So spicy.  I also garnished with cherry tomatoes.

Scrumptious!! Sweet and spicy....and even the Hubster noticed and loved these. Very nice marinade...will definately make again. I did use Caribbean Jerk Seasoning...dont know if there is a difference or not with just plain Jerk Seasoning. Loved these, grilled perfectly. Thanks!

We love this and most often use it on grilled chicken.  I like to double the recipe and use half to marinate in and save half to baste with while the shrimp/chicken is on the grill.  I also double the amount of hot sauce because we like things pretty spicy.

I'm sure if I had taken the time to read the recipe properly and removed the shells from the shrimp, they would have had a lot more flavor. As it is, I marinaded them for 24 hours, but they weren't nearly as spicy nor flavorful as I expected. Anyway, I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt, and give it 4 stars. Thanks.

This was delicious and VERY easy to do.  I can quickly put shrimp into a marinade when I get home from work and an hour later stick them on the grill.  Lots of flavor, yet mild enough for kids to enjoy as well.

This was good.  Very easy.  I couldn't find any Jamaican Jerk seasoning so I used one that was called something like Spicy Monterrey Seasoning and it was seriously hot.  Next time I think I'll either scale back the seasoning or try harder to find the right kind.  Good recipe though, will try again.

These were pretty good.  There are a couple of other shrimp marinades I like a little better.  I used extra spicy grill seasoning instead of the jerk seasoning.  I wasn't too sure about the sweet, but it was okay.

We had this for supper last night and it was just as good as what we've eaten in Jamaican restaurants.  We'll have this again.  The only thing I did differently was I used metal skewers instead of wooden.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

My family just love this recipe. Just the right amount of heat and lots of flavour. Pretty much make it according to the recipe but do not add the hot sauce as we find the jerk seasoning to be enough heat.

Absolutely loved this recipe, but because I did not have lime juice, I used lemon juice, and like others used cajun seasoning, as I did not have jerk seasoning. I used the exact amount of ingredients with one lb. of shrimp, marinated for five hours,and broiled these shrimp in my  convection oven four minutes on each side 400 degrees. Well, these were delicious, and perfectly cooked; loved the spicy/sweet combo. This will replace my other shrimp recipe. Also, did not use skewers, just put them in a broiler pan close to fire, which added a wonderful char broiled flavor. Cannot wait to make these again!

Very simple and delicious. I used some store bought jerk seasoning and used lemon vs lime since that’s what I had and it worked out great and the whole family loved.

This recipe was super easy!  I made the marinade the day before. I added  the shrimp about an hour and a half before grilling. I made up a jerk sauce as a dipping sauce but I didn’t even need it because the shrimp was flavorful enough by itself. I served them with sautéed  squash and corn on the cob. The shrimp was even better the next day!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was good. It was easy to make, and the cooking was actually the shortest part of the process. I wanted a shrimp skewer recipe for supper as my husband wanted something "light." So we had the shrimp, two skewers for each of us, sliced tomatoes, and a light dessert of no bake custard. It was just about perfect for what I wanted. Definitely a keeper.

These are yummy!  I overcooked mine a bit but that was my fault.  Also I only marinaded about 20 minutes, because I was worried the citrus would start to cook the shrimp.  Very good!

Great recipe exactly as written although it is spicy (to this Irish girl)! Make sure you read up on how to grill shrimp before spending a bunch of money on them though!

These were amazing,  looking forward to making these again when the weather gets warm.  I peeled the shrimp before marinating them allowing the flavours to soak into the whole shrimp.

I made this with the jerk seasoning at http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Jerk-Seasoning/?prop31=7 and it was delicious! I had too many shrimp to fit on my skewers, so I ended up baking some in the oven later - they were also very tasty. I'm definitely saving this recipe.

We used a taste of thai garlic chili pepper sauce (gluten free) from Winco. We couldnt find jamaican so we used McCormick Caribbean jerk seasoning, perfect pinch. Basted throughout cooking, using the marinade, not reduced.Used lemon not lime! serevd with green goddess dressing, SOOOOO GOOOOD!

Very tasty & simple marinade. Omitted the lime juice; used SriRacha & added more than 3 dashes. Also rubbed the jerk seasoning directly onto the shrimp first, then tossed them with the remaining ingredients. Let them marinate for 3 hours. They tasted just as good piping hot off the grill as they did at room temp with veggies. Good recipe!

Also used Cajun and only marinaded for 1 hour. Didn't have honey so used agave nectar instead. Spicy with hint of sweetness. Did not overpower shrimp. An all round success!
