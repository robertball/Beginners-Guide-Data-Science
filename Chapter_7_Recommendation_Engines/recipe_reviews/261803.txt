I made these today and they’re definitely a keeper! I had to make some vegan royal icing to go on top because I didn’t think the cookies were sweet enough; my father liked them as they were - he said they weren’t overly sweet, and he liked that. I think you can use different flavored vegan creamers to alter the flavor of the batter. I used a almond milk-based vanilla-flavored creamer instead of the coconut milk. I think it would be fun to try different flavors like gingerbread, peppermint, etc. All in all, this is a great recipe!

These are great! I have been vegan for a year and craving sugar cookies for just as long and I finally decided to try a recipe. This one was so easy and delicious. We did use 4 tbs of milk and less of the flour mixture by about 1/4-1/2 cup. We didnt use cookie cutters but made our own shapes

I made these and they were delicious, fast, and easy.  They’re extra crispy too— perfect for dipping in coffee or tea.  I might sprinkle sugar on them next time.  A new favorite. ??

I used whole wheat pastry flour, and dough was much too dry, so I ended up adding an additional 4 Tbsp of milk. The dough rolled and cut easily, and puffed nicely when baked.

Very good. I added divided the dough in half and added peppermint extract to half, almond extract to the other, rolled them together and cut them into spirals. Delicious. A million times better if you can them until they're just a bit crispy. Yum yum yum.

These tasted crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I used Silk Almond Creamer (vanilla) because I didn't have coconut milk and didn't want to use the pea protein milk I had for fear that it would change the taste for the worst. I halved everything to avoid making too many. I made 5 and still was able to refrigerate a wad for another day. I'll definitely make these as a go-to sugar cookie when I want something sweet.

I made them and used sodium free, sugar free soy milk instead, and I used a little less sugar than recommended, because I prefer a mild sweetness. They were a huge hit. Half of them got eaten by the family before I managed to decorate them!

They did come out a bit thick though, almost like biscuits. I don't mind, actually. It made them mildly crunchy, but soft in the middle, and I can decorate the sides like little cakes now, which is fun. Let's call it a happy accident.

My kids said they were really good!  I couldn’t try them because of medical reasons, so this is my kid’s review.  I did have to tell them to stop eating so many though!  I also did not roll them out.  Just flattened the dough with my hand as I didn’t want to put the effort into them if they turned out not tasty.  I will try them again when I’m able to eat them and roll them out and cut with cutters next time.
