People ask me in advance to have this at my parties.  I mix sour cream with the cream cheese to give it a softer, smoother texture.  I also spread the cream cheese across the whole platter and spread the cocktail sauce and sprinkle the shrimp on top. Wheat Thins go excellent with this.

This was a big hit!! As others suggested, I spread the cream cheese on the bottom of a nine inch pie pan. I used thawed, frozen salad shrimp. (I am not fond of canned fish or meats.) It was gone in minutes!!! Thanks for sharing.

I have used this recipe for YEARS! my variations are that I spread the cream cheese and cocktail sauce out on a plate and use "fresh or frozen Salad shrimp" and put that on top of the cream cheese & cocktail sauce. This never lasts long at my work parties.

This was good....but...I let the cream chees soften and mixed it with the shrimp, shaped into a ball and then poured the cocktail sauce over it. I served this with ritz buttery crackers too. Loved it!

I love this recipe!! I like to use thawed frozen salad shrimp instead of canned, and I also add a little Old Bay and garlic powder to the cream cheese to spice it up a little. Never any leftovers and my kids love it!

This was very good! But of course I added some things. First I mixed sour cream in with the cream cheese, then I also added a little bit of garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of hot sauce and spread that on a plate. I topped it with the cocktail sauce and some fresh crab. YUM! My boyfriend loved it! We dipped town house multigrain toppers in to the dip- it was sooooo good!

I used the suggestions of others:  I used frozen salad shrimp instead of the canned shrimp.  Also, there were quite some comments that the dip should be taken out of the fridge a couple of hours before so the cream cheese can soften.  With this in mind, I bought the 8 oz. tub, WHIPPING cream cheese instead.  It is nice and smooth and does not harden like the regular package of cream cheese does when placed in the fridge.  It was very tasty, too.  My family loved it.  Next time, as a variety, I might buy another kind of whipping cream cheese to add more flavor to the dip.

I chose this recipe because it's a standard that everyone loves. I had the cream cheese spread out on a pretty glass dish, getting ready to head to a friend's for dinner, when I realized the frozen shrimp I had purchased was BAD.  I quickly stopped at the market on the way to our friend's house and bought the best (1-lb.) can of lump crab that I could find (it's usually in the seafood department and is chilled).  To prepare this, I used a hand mixer and whipped up 2 pkgs. of light cream cheese with a bit of sour cream, parsley, and about 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning.  Spread this in a large, 1-inch-deep glass serving dish.  Poured the cocktail sauce over the cheese, and then layered the full pound of crab (rinsed first) over the top.  The crab with the cream cheese and cocktail sauce (with wheat thins) was outstanding. l'll make this "mistake" from now on!

I have made this so many times.  It is always a hit.  Normally I put cream cheese in a thin layer on a 9" round and then layer the sauce.  Also, you can either put the shrimp or crab meat as the top layer.  They both taste great.  An easy thing that most people really like.

Made a few changes. I cooked two lbs. of 31-40 size raw shrimp.  I feel canned shrimp is too salty and frozen shrimp are too watery.  Larger shrimp looked very nice. I got the shrimp on sale for $5 for 2 lbs.  After spreading out the cream cheese I sprinkled it with Old Bay Seasoning (more or less as desired).  Topped it with shrimp and cocktail sauce. It was a huge hit!!!

This is very good. If you want to rock your socks off add a can of cream of shrimp soup, a few dashes of tabasco and some pepper. Make sure you mix this well and chill overnight for flavors to meld.

Didn't give this five stars because I thought it needed more shrimp. I doubled the amount of shrimp - used two cans. Otherwise it would have been way too saucy, I think. With twice the amount of shrimp it's a five-star recipe. My guests ate every last bit of it. Was very tasty.

I've used this recipe twice for birthdays and everyone has loved it.  Just make 
sure that your cream cheese is slightly soft so it is easier to mix.  Yum!!

I've made this a few times for various parties and everyone just raves about it. There couldn't be a more simple recipe. My only variant is that I spread the cream cheese over the entire plate, rather than just leaving the block in the middle. I then spread the cocktail sauce over the whole thing. Delish!

This is very simple and very tasty, but its better to let the cream cheese sit for a while and warm up just a bit, it makes it easier to dip with crackers

My family has been making this for over 50 years.  There are a couple of changes we made.  I whip the cream cheese to make it a little softer, and I use a pound of fresh small (salad) shrimp.

My family uses a recipe like this. We also add a little sour cream to our cream cheese so it's not as thick. And for my taste I use a chili sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. We also add shredded mozzerella and cheddar cheese along with chopped onion and green pepper. Everyone is crazy over this recipe! It's always a hit no matter where you take it! One thing I make sure I do is rinse my shrimp very well under water or it's almost too fishy of a flavor for me.

This was good and will make again but plan on adding a few things. It needs to be "meatier" so I will add a can of crab meat. I also will add some chopped green onions. Other than that it was good and everyone enjoyed it even though it was alittle dull.

3 stars - so far. I made this but just blended it all together for ease, I tasted it and am going to add alittle horseradish to it for more zip as soon as it rests in the fridge for 15 or 20 minutes. Not sure how I really like cream cheese and shrimp - time will tell.

Make sure you use a GOOD chili sauce in this dip. Add horseradish to taste, this really adds alittle zip to the basic bland dip.

My husband and I love to snack on this.  Made according to directions and replaced the canned shrimp with salad shrimp.  The canned shrimp has a pasty feel to it and it's really so tiny, the salad shrimp has the right texture and taste just like it should.

For me the key here is easy!  I made this in addition to other appetizers to munch on during football.  Takes like a minute to prepare and is a nice change of pace from my fried goodies.

I think I had everyone at my barbeque ask me for this recipe! It was gone in 2 seconds flat! I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese, and spread it in a pie plate. I also added 2 cans of shrimp. Absolutely delicious!

This is the easiest and tastiest dip ever.  The family loved this and it went so quickly.  Goes great with Ritz crackers or Wheat Thins (Garden vegetable, our favorite).  Thanks for the recipe.

This has been one of my favorite, easiest recipes for awhile.  Tastes a little "gourmet" with the shrimp and all... I use a good quality cocktail sauce, and low fat cream cheese.... So easy and delicious!

WOW!! I remembered making this in the late 80's for a couple parties and was glad to find it again. I couldn't believe how it easy it was to make and everyone loved it!

I made this (along with a spinach dip) and this disappeared within 20 minutes out of 6 people!  I followed others advice of mixing the ingredients and not layering, but I'm not sure I would do this next time.  I think layering would keep the cocktail sauce from being too overpowering of that makes sense.  This was super easy, and I loved that I could prepare it ahead of time.  
I used small cooked shrimp and cut them up a little before putting them on top.  I am keeping this recipe!!

This recipe was passed down to me from my Mom.  I LOOOVED it when growing up.  We both did so much, in fact, we would often make a meal of it.  Just spread the cream cheese out on a plate, cover it with the cocktail sauce and salad shrimp, and dig in with a sleeve or two of Ritz crackers.  Simplicity that is to die for!

i have been enjoying this dip for well over 35yrs. i see a few others have tweaked the recipe. i say, "if it ain't broke-don't fix it"! i have yet to have a guest who isn't amazed at how simple and delicious this combo is! we aren't fancy, we let the cream cheese achieve room temp., spread the shrimp over the top and pour on the sauce...period. i always provide a few butter knives to help with lifting the cream cheese; saves all those embarrassing broken embedded crackers.

I put the cream cheese first and spread it on a platter and then pour the cocktail sauce on top and then a few cans of baby shrimp, depending how much shrimp you want. It's so good! Serve with Ritz crachers! Yum

This is a favorite of ours.  We present it differently.  Whole 8   oz cream cheese on serving plate, pour cocktail sauce unevenly over so some cream cheese still shows through and put shrimp on top of this instead of mixed in.  Serve with crackers.  Classy appetizer.  Thanks.

We didn't care for this recipe as we found it to be rather bland. Possibly an herbed cream cheese would be better.

I have made this for years. So easy and good.  I add sour cream to the room temperature cream cheese and whip with mixer.  It is easier to spread in a pretty plate, then layer with cut up shrimp pieces or crab meat then add sauce.   Everyone really likes it and is gone in no time at all...   Enjoy....!!!!!

Excellent. Used frozen shrimp thawed and dried. Used cream cheese with onions and chives and homemade cocktail sauce. The second time I made it made a wrap by spreading the cream cheese on a tortilla topped with shrimp and sauce chilled and sliced into pinwheels. Great this way too.

Four stars as written - have made it many, many times but by layering cream cheese then seafood and then the sauce.  Well drained crabmeat works very well also - maybe even better than shrimp. Always a hit.

I'm sorry but this was not good at all! All I could taste was the cocktail sauce. I used another person’s idea and added old bay but the recipe did not work out for me.

Wow! This recipe has been around a long time. It is so fast and easy and tastes great! With all the other great appetizers out there, I always forget about this one! If you like shrimp and cocktail sauce, you can't miss with this!
