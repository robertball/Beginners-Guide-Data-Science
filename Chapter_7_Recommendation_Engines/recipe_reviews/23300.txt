This recipe contains way too much salt for a baby and the sugar is not necessary. Eliminate the salt by using just water as the cooking liquor.  Adding sugar to baby food encourages a sweet tooth, so why not add more carrots or sweet potato if your baby regularly refuses veggies.

I tweaked this one for my 15 month old based on how I prefer to feed her and which vegetables I had available. I used a very large sweet potato (left skin on for extra nutrients), one peeled regular potato, one peeled carrot, 1/2 cup frozen green beans, 1/2 cup frozen corn and veggie broth. I simmered the potatoes and carrot in the broth, then threw everything including the broth, into my Vitamix and whirled until the veggies incorporated, but left a few chunks. I skipped the sugar and salt but will possibly add a little of one or both based on her reaction when she tastes. Great blend of veggies (I thought it tasted great)!
