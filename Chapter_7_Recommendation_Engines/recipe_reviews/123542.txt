This is a 5 star dish with my chages. In stead of cream of chicken soup, I used cream of mushroom and in instead of adding water I added about 1 1/2 cups of beef stock.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, removed the chops and added a bit of flour and water to thicken.  When thickened I added the chops back in and served the gravy over potatoes!  Delicious.

My husband, his mom and her sister all give this 5 stars. I would agree with some changes. I too like things very seasoned and thought this could have used a little more flavor. I will make this again, but I'll probably use chicken broth instead of water, season the chops before flouring and add some onions or maybe mushrooms to the sauce.

I've been making this very same recipe ever since I received my crockpot many years ago.  It is delicious and the gravy is really good over rice.  I don't usually add the water, so the gravy stays a little thicker.  I also generally only use 3 or 4 thick chops since there is only 3 of us...then I get the left over chop for lunch the next day.  Super easy and delicious!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have it in a crockpot cookbook and it is my family's favorite way to eat pork.  When I make it, I pour off any extra fat in the pan after browning the pork, then mix the soup and water together in that same pan.  It adds a richer flavor to the sauce.  We like to have mashed potatoes with this meal.

My husband loves pork chops and he thought this was very good.  For the flour mixture instead of salt, I used seasoned salt and put everything into a ziploc bag.  I then added the pork chops one at a time.  It was a lot less messy.  For the soup mixture I used cream of chicken soup with 1/3 c. chicken broth instead of water, added a small can of mushrooms and 1/2 a packet of dry onion soup mix.

This was delicious! I added a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash to the flour mixture to resolve the "bland" comments in previous reviews. Also some onion powder.

This is a very good slow cooker recipe. I did not fry the pork and just added the garlic and mustard to the soup that I poured over the pork.

Very good!  As suggested by another reviewer, I added a bit of the drippings from the pan after I browned the chops to the gravy.  It seemed to give the gravy a more "authentic" flavor.

I read the other reviews commenting on the blandness of the pork. I conquered this by brining the meat first and then followed the recipe. Made a HUGE difference! Much more tender and moist. Will be using this one again and again!

My husband really enjoyed this dish. After I browned the chops I sauted garlic, onions and mushrooms and added in the crockpot with the chops. I used organic cream of mushrooms instead of chicken soup.

My husband LOVED this!!! For me, I liked it but I think it could have had a little more flavor and there wasnt nearly enough gravy.I made a few changes, instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom, and I added the drippings into the slow cooker to help flavor the gravy. I think next time I'll season it a little heavier, double the amount of mushroom soup I used and saute some onions and garlic and throw that in there. All in all a great recipe that I WILL be making again!

I just made these last night and they were really, really good.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and used Cream of Mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken soup.  Instead of one can I used 2 so there would be extra sauce to put over the dumplings that I was serving with it.  I also used Chicken Broth instead of water.  Served it with dumplings, corn and dinner rolls.  Great, easy meal!

THE BEST Pork Chop recipe EVER!!!!!!  I have made these twice now (first exactly like the recipe and the second time I used a boxed pork breader/season blend to coat the pork)  Both times were FABULOUS.  My husband and his friends were in awe and could not get over how good this was! I served over mashed potatoes and doubled the sauce, adding more pepper, milk, and a little cornstarch to make a gravy.  AWESOME!!!!!!!

Wow, did I mess up. First I bought the economical pack of chops, you know with all the bones and fat streaks, then I failed to notice that it was a slow cooker meal, so at 4 I was trying to get a meal together for 6. It worked out fabulous, just cooked in regular oven to hurry up. Trimmed out bones and fat, doubled the garlic powder, breaded as recommended and browned, transferred to a 9 x 13 pan with minced fresh onion, can of cream of chicken, cream of mushroom and half can of chicken broth instead of 1/3 cup water mixed together. Cut the salt in half, just for safety, rather add salt later rather than come out to salty. Cooked in 300 oven for 45 minutes and it came out absolutely delicious and tender. This will be added to our regular rotation, cannot get over how great it is, will try to remember next time to start early enough to cook as written in a slow cooker, you have to look over us men who are the chief cooks and bottle washers of the household, but the wife could not stop raving about this meal last night, thanx so much for sharing this one, will be taking it to a few family reunions...once again thanx, Connie, the meat and the sauce are out of this world!

The whole family enjoyed these. The only changes I made were that I browned the chops in olive oil, substituted red wine for the water, added 2 tbsp of finely chopped onion, and added some sliced mushrooms. 6 hours on Low, and the chops were moist and came apart easily with a fork. Served on a bed of brown rice with some veggies on the side, this made a nice supper. The gravy is delicious, though you may want to season it a bit with a little pepper.

As written, a mild recipe more for those who cannot tolerate, seasoning, or salt.  I added Tony Chachere's seasoning, salt, water mixed with bouillon cube, and fried chopped onions otherwise this would have been too bland for us.  Good work day recipe when you don't have time to cook and want a home cooked meal.

Excellent recipe. Only addition was 1/2 tsp. onion powder to flour mixture. No additional seasonings needed. Did use chicken broth instead of water. Pork chops were super tender and the sauce made great gravy. Yum!

I made this for the family and everyone liked it.  The recipe is easy, especially with the slow cooker factor.  I made a few changes based on prior reviews, added beef broth in place of water and added onions in the beginning to simmer with the meat.

We loved these.  Sooooo tender.   I did use chicken broth instead of water and doubled the broth and soup.  We like lots of gravy.  Next time I will probably add some onion powder or dry onion soup mix just for a little bit more flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

I would give this 4.5 because it was really good but I had to give it 4 because 2 out of 3 of my kids didn't care for it.

I served it over brown rice.  I will make it again, and I will make them eat it.  :)

The pork chops were not bland at all.  My wife told me this was 5 stars, but I am being a little conservative.  

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I added Tony Chachere's seasoning to the pork chops for some extra flavor and threw in a couple of handfuls of mushrooms.  I also used cream of chicken soup with mushroom.  Finally, i doubled the soup and water mixture and served it with white rice (with green onions and fresh parsley) and it made for a great meal on a cold Milwaukee night.

My boyfriend liked this but I thought it was really bland and I was surprised that after cooking it that long the porkchop was still dry in the middle.  I won't make this one again.

This recipe was wonderful. I followed some other reviews and decided to add 1/2 teaspon of onion powder and also used chicken broth in place of the water. This was so tender that I had trouble getting out of the crockpot without falling apart and the taste was wonderful.

Great recipe!  I will make this again.  I only changed a couple of things. I wanted to make sure I had extra gravy, so I increased the liquid. Where it called for water, I used chicken broth. I like things very seasnoned, so I increased the seasoning in the flour and also seasoned the chops when I put them in the pan. Thanks for a great recipe.

Really really good!  I sprinkled the chops with a little Lawry's seasoning also.  I'll make these again!  Thanks for sharing!

The gravy is really nice served over mashed potatoes but I found the pork chop a bit bland.

This recipe was tasty and easy!  I did add a little cajun seasoning to the breading as hubby and I like everything spicy.  It did just the trick.

Very easy and tasty. I prefer a thicker pork loin chop, and this dish has a nice gravy that went over well.
