This turned out really good. I'm typically not a fan of brown rice but it works well in this recipe. I made one minor change in the preparation but only due to hubby's  preference. He does not care for bell peppers cooked all of the way. They have to still have some crunch in them. I added them in the last 10 minutes and that was perfect for him.

Simple and tasty, I'll make it again.  But my husband felt it had too much onion, and I thought the spices were a bit strong, so I'll try these changes: 1/2 small onion (or 1 shallot), 1 tsp chili powder, 3/4 tsp salt.  If you like bell pepper, use the entire pepper.
