I feel guilty writing a review, because I cheated on the recipe so much that what I came out with was a completely different recipe. But the inspiration and the results I got were such a success! I made a graham cracker crust with 1 1/2 cups (or 1 individual package of whole crackers) graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, and 1/3 cup melted butter, mixed and pressed flat into a 9 inch springform. Did the strawberries as directed, being careful to cut the bottoms at a slight angle to they pressed flat againt the pan sides. Then (forgive me Eleanor) I am so lazy that I just used two boxes of packaged mousse mix instead of making my own. It pulled away from the sides of the pan perfectly, and was georgeous! Got tons of oohs and aahs. It was light and cool and perfect. Later I did it with fresh raspberries, which I think might be even better. Thank you so much for such a wonderful and impressive dessert idea!

Best dessert I have ever made!!! Very easy and absolutely beautiful. Only changes I made were to use 1 1/2 cups oreo cookie crumbs and 4 1/2 tbles butter for the crust so it would not break up when being cut.  I put parchment paper on bottom of pan and that made it easy to slide onto serving plate. YOu must try..will NOT be disappointed.

I ended up baking a brownie mix in a 9X13 pan, layering strawberries on top of the brownies.  I melted the chocolate chips on the stove with the corn syrup and water and used 2 cartons of cool whip.  It was divine.  I am not sure I will ever try it with cookie crumbs as this got soooo many compliments and I liked the brownie "crust".  Great recipe.

I served this to some friends and it was a HUGE hit..they thought I bought it from a bakery!!  I used a mixture of Nestle semi-sweet chocolate and expensive dark chocolate and I think that gave it a more "gourmet" flavor.  I used graham cracker crumbs + a few tablespoons of baking cocoa for my crust and I added a layer of sliced strawberries between the crust and the mousse.  I'm excited to make this again using different combinations of flavored chocolate and fruit!!

This is a very impressive looking dessert that is *very* easy to do. I am never able to find chocolate cookie crumbs in the baking aisle. I use Oreo cookies, remove the filling and put them in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to smash them (great job for a kid) or put them in the food processor. The chocolate crust is well worth the effort. I didn't make any changes in the ingredients but to save a step I added the chocolate chips to the warm corn syrup mixture and stirred until smooth instead of running it through the blender. It came out perfectly. I made it for my father-in-law's birthday and everyone loved it!

This was beautiful, easy & delicious! I followed the recipe exactly & it came out almost perfectly. I used chocolate graham teddy bears (crushed of course) for the crust. I think next time I will bake the crust for a few minutes before filling, to get it more set & not so crumbly. Be sure & leave the "cake" in the fridge until serving time so that it remains good & set. I garnished w/ fresh blueberries & sliced strawberries.

this is one great recipe. not only is it super easy to make (i was able to make it at the same time i was taking care of my 3 month old!) it also turned out wonderfully delicious! very rich and dark, however you want it. i made an actual cake as the base and used the mousse on top, with the strawberries. i also used a square shaped springform pan and it looked uniquely beautiful! thanks for submitting this.

This turned out really nice! I made this for my husbands birthday! I made a dunkin hines brownie crust on the bottom of the pans (I used one cake box to fill the bottom of 1x 8x8 square pan and one very large round spring-form pan) in order to keep the crust thin nd not to take away from the mousse, but not have it too thick. I used frozen strawberries - as it is not the season for fresh strawberries (and i made this recipe on a whim so didnt have them in the house...) I thought the mouse tasted a bit grainy. I prefer "Polly Welby's Excellent Chocolate Mousse" from this site which is quite similar to this mousse recipe, but less ingredients/less steps.  I will make this again - but with the mousse recipe I prefer.

This was just a wonderful dessert.  So easy, yet looked like I slaved for hours over it.  The only problem was that it was so good, my family didn't leave me any leftovers!  Thanks for this fantastic recipe.

This is AMAZING.  Very very easy, maybe 20 minutes MAX.  I agree with other reviewers you do not have to have 2 pints of strawberries.  I too used oreo cookies with out the filling for the crust.

This will absolutely be a favorite recipe of mine from now on.

I made this recipe for guests.  All five guests did not like this recipe.  The reasons were that the recipe was too rich, dry, and was not creamy like a mousse should be.  I wanted to make an impression with my dessert, but, instead, the majority of the dessert remained on their plate.  I want to be honest because I pick and choose my recipes by the ratings. I noticed this recipe has many good ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  Everyone loved it and said it looked beautiful.  I followed the recipe exactly and had enough crust, mousse & topping, so the measurements are perfect.  I usually do not find that is the case with a lot of recipes, for some reason I always have to make more of something.  I made it with milk choc chips because some of the other reviews said it was really rich, however it didn't seem too rich so I will definitely try it with the semi-sweet next time, I bet it would be better that way.  I use this website all the time and this is probably the best recipe I have ever made, my husband said it was definitely the best dessert I've ever made.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dessert is scrumptious, easy to make, and looks elegant.  I use Oreo cookies for the crust, and coffee instead of water to add depth to the chocolate flavor.  Fantastic!

This dessert is easy and beautiful, and as much as I love the idea if it we found the appearance to be better than the taste. So, I made again this time with the brownie crust (Hershey's chocolate chunk brownie mix) and milk chocolate chips. The brownie crust is the clear winner, and while the milk chocolate chips did taste better, it's still not right. Like other reviewers stated...it is in fact grainy and lacking in flavor. I will try this again with a different mousse recipe.

Made this for Valentines Day and instead of using a springform pan I used a mini heart shape pan which made 12.  Wow this was good but very sweet, it could be that I used mini chocolate chips but I don't think that it why.  There is one step that I would do without though, and that is there really is no need for the blender.  All you really need to do is put the chips in a bowl and pour the hot ixture over it to melt.  This is how you do it to make a ganache.  I wastes alot of chocolate as i couldn't get it all out of the blender.  I would make it again but with less chocolate or even maybe try it with white chocolate hmmmm that sounds good

MMMM!!!!  This cake turned out really well!  Hubby doesn't like the cake-y type cakes, so this one was right up his alley.  The blend of intense chocolate flavor mixed with fresh strawberries is divine, and I wasn't even that thrilled with the quality of the strawberries I used.  It presented nicely with the ring of strawberries around it, and the homemade whipped cream set it off perfectly, not being too sweet, but full of real cream flavor.   (Do not use canned...it will only insult this yummy cake!)  I would agree with a previous reviewer about not giving it to your children before bedtime...bounce, bounce, bounce....lol

I've used this recipe several times... I even bought my springform pan just for this recipe.  Every time I make it everyone is amazed... and it's so easy!  Just don't give it to your kids right before bedtime.

5 stars if you are a chocolate lover and a sweet tooth (and I am both).  My husband isn't much of a chocolate lover, and he thought the mousse was a little grainy.  But he still encouraged me to make it again.  A huge hit with my family.

People are still "mmmmmm"ing about this from my Christmas Eve Party!!! It’s super impressive and mouth-watering! I doubled the crust using crushed Oreo Cookies without the fillings. Pre-baked the crust (so it would not get soggy), used high quality chocolate chips and melted them in the same pan as the syrup without heat. I also omitted the strawberries (since they are not in season). Please DO NOT use store bought whipped topping, take the time to make your own it really makes all the difference. Try this simple masterpiece and your guests will think you slaved over it (But it’s really easy). Thanks Eleanor for a superb recipe!

All the reviews said this was easy but I had a hard time visualizing it at first. Just try it! It will make sense as you go. In my opinion this is a dinner party dessert, not picnic food. The presentation is wonderful and it tasts terrific!

I made this for my mother's birthday dinner and it was a hit! I added a twist to this by making only half the quantity of the chocolate mousse filling, which filled the pan half-way, and repeating with white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The only catch was that I had to refrigerate the chocolate layer for a couple hours before I could add the white chocolate layer. But the result was AMAZING!

I've made this cake twice now, both times using a brownie crust.  The first time I substituted milk chocolate chips.  The second time I used the semi sweet.  Both cakes were equally delicious!  This cake is easy and impressive.  But, due to the short shelf life of strawberries should definitely be enjoyed in a day or two for best quality.

i used mini chocolate chips and it melted really well.  i did bake the crust at 350 degrees for 7 minutes and that was perfect.  very easy to make and looked great.  but the mousse texture was really strange - my husband said it was gritty-like.  i thought it was a starchy texture or something - hard to describe.  and the topping didnt have a whole lot of taste, but yet i think it's needed for the cake just to even out the mousse.

The mousse is so easy, the pie was great.
My husband likes the mousse just by itself in a bowl with a spoon! Yummy and so easy! I have been looking for a good mousse recipee without raw egg! Thank you!

I have made this recipe on several occasions.  It is very easy to make.  I have also made a white chocolate variation.  However you need to add some gelation to get the chocolate to set.

I haven't read any of the other reviews for this one. I made this for an office gathering and got no less than 5 marriage proposals. I thought the crust was a bit thin. I will use 1.5 to 2 cups of oreos next time.  It was truly fabulous and easy. Thanks for sharing.

A big hit!  I used Lite Cool Whip instead of heavy cream and sugar.  A lighter version that was awesome.

I made this for a birthday party last night.  It was loved by all who ate it!  Also it was very easy to make, especially on a hot day with no air conditioning.  I added a pile of strawberries to the top sitting on top of whipped cream.. really beautiful.  Thankyou!! it's recipes like this that make the average baker look like a super-star baker!

Please follow this wonderful recipe exactly. I didn't and I wished I had. I couldn't find cookie crumbs so I used a chocolate pie shell and crumbled it up. Using a bit less butter, I mixed it with the crumbles and pressed it in. It was a disaster and stuck to the springform pan. Of course the best part is the mousse with fresh strawberries and the presentation (sans crust) is still beautiful. Thank you for this very easy, non-cook dessert that will get oohs and ahs from your guests!

This was okay, but almost rich even for me (and I like rich desserts). Instead of making the crust, I used a storebought chocolate crust. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I think I would try making this again using milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I think that would be more to our tastes.

Awesome dessert and easy, too!! Made this just for me & my husband, so halved the recipe & used a smaller clear glass dish- looked great! I used my blender for the whipping cream as well to save on dishes- worked great!

Beautiful, delicious. So easy to make and so clean to serve! Crumbled Oreo cookies work perfectly for the crust. If you're debating whether to make this - you MUST :)

I wanted to make this for a group with a healthy appetite for desserts, so I did 1-1/2 times the crust and twice the mousse.  It filled my springform pan, with a little left over.  I decided to gild the lily and piped a little chocolate syrup on the top before piping on the whipped cream and adding the strawberries.  I also cut up some additional strawberries and mixed them with sugar for anyone who wanted to put that on their plate too.  Everyone loved it and it's very rich.  I would suggest adding a little more melted butter to the cookie crumbs since mine didn't hold together as much as I would have liked.  I've been wanting to try this for years and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to try it.

I made this for my book club.  It was a big hit.  This is a beautiful dessert that is nearly effortless to make.  Big bang for you buck you will hear lots of  "Wow! You must have spent all day on this."  I usually make this the day before I serve it because it does take time to set.  I've made this twice.  Once with the cookie crust and once with a brownie crust.  It was awesome both ways.  I'm thinking of trying this with  peanut butter chips and maybe a nutter-butter crust for a peanut butter version of the same dessert.

I made this for a birthday at work.  It was very good and got a lot of compliments.  I, personally, thought the mousse was slightly on the bitter side and would be better with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  The strawberries offset this some.  I'll try milk chocolate or maybe white chocolate next time.  I skipped the blender step as someone recommended and just poured the water/syrup mixture over the choc chips in a bowl - worked out fine.  Oh, I also used the brownie crust as another reviewer mentioned.  Was fabulous!

I used crushed chocolate graham crackers for the "crust." I did not have a springform pan so I used a circular cake pan. This is very rich, creamy, and chocolatey, but the strawberries balance out the intensity of the chocolate! Yumm!

If you love chocolate, this is a MUST recipe.  It is rich, creamy, and decadent.  I have made it with and without the strawberries.  Personally, I like it better with them.  I think I will try a mix of strawberries and raspberries next time.  Yum!  This is very easy.  The amout if whipping cream needed makes it a bit more pricey than some other dessert recipes, but to me, totally worth it!

So so so good. I have made this 4 times, and it goes FAST! There is no need to change a thing. I did make little mini cakes in muffin cups, and they were easy to remove from the wrapper. Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome!  I always double the recipe for the crust to make it a little easier to get out, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly and it always comes out wonderfully.  Every time I make it for my friends it's devoured very quickly.  If you like chocolate covered strawberries, you'll love this dessert.

Fantastic! Very simple to make. I used crushed oreo cookies w/o the centers for the bottom. Topped with canned whipped cream. Next time I'll put strawberries along the bottom as suggested by another poster, I think that'd taste delicious. Also, I used "whipping cream" instead of "heavy cream" and it worked out just fine - the recipe calls for "heavy whipping cream" and it all worked out fine.

This is so pretty. I used plain digestive crumbs instead of chocolate cookie crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe. I did have to make more biscuit base but all the other measurements are perfect. Served it at a barbecue and it was gone very quickly. Thanks

I brought this into work today and everyone fell in love with it!  Instead of just whipped cream on top, I made a white chocolate mousse following the same premise as the dark chocolate mouse.  For convenience, I also used chocolate graham cracker crumbs instead of chocolate cookie crumbs. It came out beautifully! Thanks!

I have made this dessert many times & have always been asked what bakery I bought it from! Don't let it intimidate you! There are several steps BUT it's easy.Here are a few tips. I take 15 or so oreo cookies, scrape off the filling & use that for the crust.When I slice the strawberries I too cut the tops flat. It helps them to stay put. Mine has never come out grainy as others have said; I use a bag of Nestle's semisweet chips & its always smooth & creamy!Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's the bomb!

This is very good.  I made it because I had strawberries that needed to be used up and it was so easy!  Plus it looks fantastic.  I'm making it this weekend for a dessert party and I'm sure it will be a huge hit!

Had to make a cake for a male dotor at work and serve to many female nurses (who of course want chocolate 24/7) This was a huge hit for all with its "light" texture and smooth, decadent chocolate taste!!

I am a chocoholic and I really loved this. I used crushed graham crackers for the base and added more strawberries on top. It was beautiful when I removed the springform pan. A divine and decadent recipe for sure!

Wonderful! I serve it with confidence when I have dinner guests. Tastes great & serves beautifully. To save time, I used canned whipped cream to garnish the top of each piece before I served it.

Everyone loved this cake when I made it for a party.  It is slightly rich, but the tart fresh strawberries offset the mousse.

This was a perfect texture for mousse.  I used chocolate chex cereal for the crust for a gluten free version.  Be sure to allow the chocolate to cool long enough.  Delicious!  I made it for my boss for his birthday and he was just short of licking the plate clean.  This is someone who watches his diet and is very proper, lol.  I'd say it was a hit!

Pluses: Very easy to make, looks amazing, mousse is tasty.
Minus: Crust is boring/thin/dry.
I'll definitely make this again, but with modifications to the crust. I'll also try it with raspberries instead of strawberries, which I think will be amazing.

Made this recipe exactly as written and was not pleased with the results. Although it looks impressive, the chocolate mousse has a strange gritty, almost chalky consistency. It contains 2 cups of chocolate chips but didn't even taste that chocolatey to us:/. Won't make again.

My husband made this for my birthday. Following is his thoughts.
"I was afraid this would be too sweet so I used a 70% semi sweet chocolate.The strawberries I had were a little bit sour as its the beginning of the season. The end result was bitter-sour-sweet. Not as good as I expected it and yet still good and very pretty. Next time I will use sweet strawberries and not as bitter chocolate. There will be a next time.
This was my first time making a cake like this and it was surprisingly easy. I was thought it might fall apart when I opened the pan so I lined it with a sheer plastic I bought at the baking shop. That held everything together."

Followed instructions exactly using chopped gourmet dark chocolate in place of the chips, and this turned out fantastic! Delicious and rich, something you would expect from an upscale restaurant or much more complicated recipe.

I slightly increased the measurements as I only have a 10 inch spring form pan, but this was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it, it had a very rich texture and flavout.  Definitely will make this again.  I want to try it with white chocolate and raspberries....

This was good. Maybe it's just me (I'm not a chocolate fanatic), but it was just so rich and chocolately. My family loved it, so it's probably just my personal preference for more fruit than chocolate. It was easy to make but looked like it took a long time to put together. I did use a pre-made chocolate cookie pie crust since I don't have a Springform pan. If you decide to go with the pie crust too, you could absolutely cut the chocolate mousse ingredients by half and still have enough. My pie was overflowing with the mousse, and I didn't even use all that the recipe had called for. I couldn't put the lid back on the pie.

If you are a person who thinks there's no such thing as too much chocolate, you will probably like this cake.  Not having had too many chocolate-mousse-type desserts before, I didn't know exactly what to expect.  I found it was very, very rich.  Too rich and too chocolate-y for me.  That could partially be because I only had 1/2 cup regular chocolate morsels and had to use semi-sweet dark chocolate morsels for the rest.  I just thought it was too much of all the same flavor and same consistency in this dessert.

I discovered this recipe a couple of years ago and have been making it for summer birthdays since. It is incredibly easy, rich and creamy! (a little messy in the preparation -though it could be the cook) Every time I serve it, it lasts approximately 2 minutes - never any leftover (bummer!) I have passed this along to MANY people.

I want to rate this recipe as a 5 because of the simplicity and the the taste and presentation were awesome but we could not get past the grainy texture. What did I do wrong, as not many reviews acknowledge the weird texture so I am sure I errored some how.

This is a beautiful cake to look at but I found the chocolate flavour sort of bitter. Maybe a mixture of half semisweet and half milk chocolate chips would have a better result? Everything else was fine though.

Too good to be true!  It was so delicious and tasty.  I've made this recipe 4 times and the results are still amazing.  Only problem I had was that sometimes the strawberry chocolate mousse cake would collapse.  Not sure why, but it wont stop me from making it :)

Absolutely wonderful!  Easy to make and easy to tweak to personal tastes! I recieved a request for a peanut butter version after making this and it was great! I just removed the strawberries and added ground peanuts and used pb morsels instead of chocolate.  Hats off to you, Eleanor!!

I used crushed graham crackers for my crust and it does make a beautiful presentation.  The taste is great but my mousse ended up a tad grainy so I may use my mixer when adding the chips to the corn syrup - or maybe just try a better chip?  I wouldn't mind this being made with even darker chocolate.  I also used canned whipped cream for the top.  I was just whishing for a moussier mousse - but it was probably something I did wrong.

I am getting requests for this cake for get togethers.  I made it for my fiance's birthday and it came out perfectly.  The presentation is impressive and everyone was so impressed that the mousse was made from scratch - but it was so easy.

This is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is very rich and sooo good.  Definitely for true chocolate lovers only.  Very easy but appears impressive.  Thank you so much for the recipe Eleanor.  This is one I will be making over and over again!

I did alter this recipe by preparing a prepackaged milk choc. mousse mix and coolwhip. I defrosted frozen strawberries also. I found the crust to be barely enough to cover the bottom of my 9" springform pan and certainly not enough to have any thickness to it. When the pie was made it was very hard to get a slice off the base. In fact, I ended up having to keep this on the base. Attemps at moving it were futile since the filling is so soft and the crust is so fragile. It's like trying to balance jello. Also I was not able to find a temperature to store this at that would have the filling and whipped topping firm enough yet the berries not frozen at. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's a good combination of flavors but I know there are many easier ways of combining choc. and strawberries.

this cake was delicious.  it was extremely rich with the semi sweet chocolate chips, however.  i think next time i will try milk chocolate chips.  i'm also tempted to try white chocolate chips.  i'm sure both will turn out wonderful.

I made this mousse this past Easter and it was a huge hit!  It was easy to make and came out great.  I am making it again for Thanksgiving dessert.  If you love chocolate, you can't go wrong with this one!

This was real easy to make, though I did go with a brownie crust as suggested by another user. I do think the mousse is very rich, but the strawberry topping helps offset that. I added a teaspoon of  Bailey's to the whip cream and it did wonders with the overall flavor. overall a great recipe and does stand out beautifully at dinner parties.

This has become my easy, fast, reliable dessert when I don't have time for something more elaborate.  
Key (as with all chocolate desserts) is using quality chocolate rather than chocolate chips.  
Some other tips:
- I cook the base a bit (5-10 min?)  and let it cool
- bring the water and syrup to a boil and pour over the chocolate, stir until smooth and then let it cool before merging with whip cream (rather than blender)

Ooohh, this was good.  You just can't go wrong with strawberries and chocolate.  I used cool whip in place of the whipping cream because it was much easier.   It was still very good and the family loved it.  I'll make it again.

Is a great recipe. I made mine using Belgian chocolate which gave it a very rich dark chocolate taste and added 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the whipped topping, for extra durability out of the fridge.

Fantastic! Not difficult but messy, I used almost every electric appliance I own. Used Oreos for the crust and a good quality cream. Had mini semi sweet chips on hand and had no problem with them. Will be making again for sure!

It was very good. I made it for Easter. A little rich in my opinion but others loved the richness. I also felt the strawberries clashed with the rest of the flavors. Some people agreed, some disagreed. I will definitely make this again but I'll probably make one with and one without strawberries.

This recipe was overall easy to make! I made it for my mother on mothers day and the results were stunning. The only thing I would like to point out is that the strawberries should be well patted out and dried of excess water before being used or else it makes the cookie crumb layer soggy. Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I made this as directed a day ahead, covered it with saran wrap and put it in the frig. The next day I whipped 1 1/2 chops of whipping cream, instead of just 1/2 cup, spread it on top of the mouse, then arranged sliced strawberries on top.  I wanted a thicker cream layer, it worked perfectly. None was left at the end of Christmas dinner.

I made this for my DS 20th Birthday. As others suggested, I made a Brownie base! Yummy cake! Will try and find another special occasion to make soon again.

This was yummy and easy to make. I did use 1/2 dark chocolate and 1/2 semisweet to make it less sweet. I also baked the oreo crust for about 8 minutes to set the crust.

The strawberries I used on this had been frozen, so it wasn't as pretty but still worked just fine.  It was really good!  I will definitely be making it again.

I have made this several times and it has been a huge hit every time.  My brother suggested using mini chocolate chips instead of putting the chocolate in the blender.  This worked out wonderfully and so much easier and less messy than bringing the blender into it.  In addition, chocolate graham crackers worked great for the crust.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This came out great! Definitely a dessert for chocolate mousse lovers... like most of the viewers I used oreo cookies without the filling. Kinda felt bad for tossing out a whole pack of filling. Any ideas for substituting it with another cookie crumb base where i dont have to waste the filling? 

Also i added a layer of marie tea biscuit crumb layer( crushed biscuit in melted butter ) and a layer of strawberries in between the mousse... that just made it sooo much better!

My friends tried it and told me that this was the best mouse cake they have ever had in their life! totally worth all the effort of whipping up the mousse from scratch.
