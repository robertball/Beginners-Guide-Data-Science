The recipe turned out to be a soupy mess!  There really isn't much to it and the spaghetti sauce overpowers any flavor the onion and peppers would have added.  It would be a nice side dish, but left us wanting more as a main dish.

elicious!  I found, however, that adding  some mozerella or swiss cheese between the chicken and veggies, and sprinkling some seasoned breadcrumbs on top gives it what its missing.  Er, maybe Im just a chicken parm addict.

Maybe add cooked pasta and Parmesan to give this recipe substance.

This has become a regular meal for me and my husband. It is a tasty meal that gets on the table in 15 minutes flat - a great speedy weeknight meal. I usually prepare the pan the night before so we can just put it in the broiler on a worknight. I serve with garlic bread and salad.

This recipe was delicious! I only used 1 tomato, added black olives, and used 22 ounces of spaghetti sauce.

As a casserole, this isn't much of a dinner. I think it makes a lot more sense as a doctored-up sauce for pasta. I also added cheese, and probably should have added breadcrumbs to make the whole thing "stick together" like a casserole. So, over noodles, it's a good way to get more veggies in your diet.

delicious meal, served with asparagus with a raspberry sauce.  Family loved it.  I thought it would be more of a spaghetti sauce with chicken instead of gr. beef.  but it wasn't it was delicious.

I really liked this.. I did however make a few changes.. First I used a little of each green, yellow, and orange bell pepper and red onions. I also saute the chicken in about 2 tbsp of olive oil with salt and pepper to taste until lightly golden. Then added chicken and homemade sauce and at the last 15 mins I mixed in about 1/4 cup Grated Parmesan cheese.. Placed it over white rice and served..
