Absolutely incredible -- for the Canadians out there, they taste very similar to Jos. Louis packaged snack cakes. This is the whoopie pie I've been searching for -- moist cakes with the perfect creamy center. If you don't have sour milk on hand, just add 1 tsp. vinegar to 1 c. milk.

These are very good, easy to make however the frosting filling tasted too much like confectionary sugar.  Maybe it a little cream cheese was put in the mix it would be better.  I made them way tooo big. These are very sweet.  Next time I will make them the size of an oreo not the size of my hand.  My 7 year old son had one and finished about 3/4 of one and started to feel sick from it being so sweet.  It made about 16 large pies which I froze 8 of.  I ran out of syranwrap so I put 4 pies in a dish, placed wax paper over them and put 4 more on top put the lid on the dish and froze them.  I'm looking forward to trying them frozen.

This recipe is excellent. I've tried a lot of whoopie pie recipes and this is the best one I have found.  I will be using it from now on.  The cookie part took 8 minutes to cook just as the recipe stated.  The filling came out perfect, not runny like a lot I have tried.  Five stars all around.

I've never made whoopie pies before so i have nothing to compare it to. But judging from other people's reviews and Mr.Wiki I pretty much managed to figure what these would turn out like.   They were good, I did lessen the sugar to 3/4 cup (I half the original amount)because some said it was really sweet. I also added cinnamon and all spice for extra umph (I was a bit sick of the plain chocolate taste).  The consistency was thick enough to be piped, so that you'll get a more even shape ( I figured that out half way baking 'em - duhh!)  Didn't make the filling, used peanut butter buttercream instead and they became super-super good!  Will make them again! :)

The buttermilk was bad, so I used heavy cream instead. (No vinegar.) My husband kept eating the batter! He liked it. :) I had marshmallow creme on hand, so I used it instead of the cream recipe. I cut the recipe down to 12.  3 of them were eaten right away, and the others I wrapped up and put in the freezer. I'd make these again.

The best whoopie pie recipe! The filling is perfect and easierand tastier than the cooked version I was used to. We wrap filled "pies" individually in plastic wrap and freeze. Some of my family like them best frozen. Note: these are referred to as "Gobs" in some parts of Pennsylvania.

Great recipe! These taste just like the whoopie pies I remember from my childhood. I wasn't sure about the icing at first, but it tasted great after chilling the filled pies in the fridge.    This is the recipe I've been searching for, and will definately be making these again!

Delicious!  They were even better the second day after refridgerating over night.  Also, the batter spreads a lot so you don't need to use much for one pie.  These taste similar to Oreo Cakesters

This recipe is GREAT!  They taste just like the ones in the expensive fancy bakery near my office.  My coworker said he couldn't tell the difference.  Delicious and very simple to bake and store.  A winner!

I used this recipe for the chocolate cake part but not the filling since I didn't have any confectioner's sugar. I'm eating a whoopie pie as I'm writing this review hehe. These are really good but since I didn't have shortening, never do, I used butter and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. These came out really moist and chocolately :) Yummm

This cookie is excellent.  I didn't use the filling recipe to cut back on the fat content.  I made a simple fluffy frosting with 1 egg white, 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup water, 3/4 TBS. light corn syrup and 3/4 tsp. vanilla. Cook the sugar, Cr. of tartar, salt, water and corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat till the sugar is completely dissolved, forming a syrup. Beat the egg white with a wire whip attachment of a mixer till whites begin to hold shape. Continuing at high speed of the mixer slowly pour hot syrup in a fine stream and whip for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Add vanilla and whip about 5 minutes more, or until frosting loses its gloss and stands in stiff peaks. This is more than enough to fill all the cookies.

I have never made whoopie pies before, and have eaten maybe 1 or 2 in my life.  I wouldn't consider my myself an expert baker either.  I made my first batch exactly like the recipe, using lemon in my milk(sour milk), and beating the eggs to a froth (icing).  They turned out perfect & baked exactly in 8 min as instructed.  Short of putting a lock on my fridge, my family was begging for more!  I thought they were good, but since I was born with an insanely sweet tooth, I felt the cookies could be a bit sweeter so I decided to make a second batch.  I added 2c mini chocolate chips to the batter before baking.  I also made and used two batches of icing to 1 batch of pies.  They were DIVINE and will satisfy any sweet tooth extremist to their hearts content, even without the alterations!!!  I'm definitely adding this to my recipe collection!  I will be fighting the urge to not dig in to the almost 6 doz pies sitting in my fridge once my kids get in bed tonight!  I'm donating to a fundraiser, and a football team.  For their sake, I hope I can control myself for the next 18 hrs!  I also LOVE that this recipe makes so many at once.  I pretty much got 36 out of the batch.

Yup, yup, yup--this is it.  I'm from whoopie pie country (Maine) and grew up eating them and I can tell you that this is an excellent recipe.  The cookies are delicious and the filling is light, fluffy, and not too sweet just like it should be.  These are so good that I'm pretty sure they might be against my religion....

This is the recipe I grew up eating.  For those who complain they are too sweet, that's what Whoopie Pies ARE!   For the one that added cinnamon-- they're not Mexican Pies.  And the peanut butter as a filling?  Not a Whoopie Pie.  This recipe is perfect just as is.

I bake for a living & these tasted pretty good! plenty of cocoa flavor. I sifted the cocoa, flour, etc before adding. I couldn't stop sampling the batter! It was sooo good. I followed a few tips from others reviewers. I added 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of the 2 cups of white sugar. I also prefer butter to shortening but, I appreciate the lift shortening brings. So, I added half butter and half shortening. I tried a greased pan but it resulted in flattened cakes. The pan used with parchment paper gave me thicker cakes that didn't spread much. I also felt that they were a bit dry when baked at 400 degrees for 8 minutes. But, I did use my small batter scooper(3/4 tblspn). I only baked two pans worth about 8 per pan.  I'm thinking about adding a little espresso powder to the remaining batter.
For the filling I used a marshmallow fluff recipe shared by one of the reviewers of the Oatmeal Whoopies. Once I put them together I froze them for about 20 minute to set.

I used this recipe for the cookie part but not the frosting. It was out of this world. It made so many I spent an hour driving them around my neighborhood giving them to friends. Wow, were they great though. The cookies themselves were totally delish on their own also. I used a filling made with marshmallow fluff and... YUM!

I used a whoopie pie baking pan which helps make them uniform in shape.  They tasted like muffin tops.  Outside is crisp but inside is moist and soft.  I used a simple butter cream recipe for the filling.  I would make these over and over again for friends and family.  They were gobbled up on Christmas day.  AWESOME RECIPE!

This is sooo yummy I am not sure why others went flat but I think it is because they did not cook them long enough as I added one minute to my cook time and mine are high and puffy.  The first time I made them I followed the receipe as written only omitting the raw egg whites as there is no reason to add them to the frosting.  The second time I added about 1/4 cup more cocoa to the cookie.  I also added 1/2 a tablespoon more of vanilla to the frosting and made it with 1 cup of butter and only 1/2 cup of shortening. They do taste better after they have set in the fridge or freezer for a day.
Thanks for the receipe.

This review is for the cakes, not the cream.  Although the texture was 5 stars, the flavor was 'meh'.  Looked good, felt good, fell flat.

I grew up in Lancaster PA (Amish country, where whoopie pies originated) and this is the exact same recipe I have from my Grandma. It is delicious and tastes just like hers! I've tried them with marshmallow creme and my husband and I both preferred this recipe.  The egg whites are the key to the frosting--they make it fluffy and different from regular cake icing. Most of the "trendy" whoopie pies I've seen have flat, runny centers. (However, if you are unsure that your egg whites are safe to eat raw, then obviously it would be better to use the creme or egg white substitution).

These were excellent!  I made them just how the recipe called for and wouldn't change a thing!  I did beat the eggs until soft peaks were forming...and then mixed it in.  I love them!

These are awsome. I used buttermilk instead of sour milk and 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shorteing instead of 1cup shorting for the cakes. This make a lot of whoopies. I got 55! Will try a cream cheese filling next time. Yummm

there are lots of whoopie pie recipes out there and i have tried many. This is our favorite. A true whoopie pie..I find that i prefer them baked at 375 for 6 1/2 minutes. I would not leave out the egg whites but next time i may add less because it thinned out the filling more than i would have liked. I will fold them in a little at a time until i am happy with the consistency. Beware that this recipe makes a lot. Tablespoon sized cakes are actually quite small for whoopie pies. Don't be afraid to use all the filling. Whoopie pies are meant to be stuffed full (i could have probably made 1 1/2 x the filling)! Great recipe.

I am NOT REVIEWING THE COOKIE in the recipe JUST THE FILLING...That being said...I use it on my oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate chip.Kid's and adult's like them and i always get rave reviews.I wrap in plastic wrap and toss them in the freezer untill we are ready to go and they thaw out great by the time we are ready to eat them.We take them along for our picnics or snacks on trips.It is almost the same buttercream icing i use when decorating my cakes...Instead of real egg white's i use meringue powder.Works the same as real egg whites but you wont be taking a chance and getting sick.Another things i do differantly is add 1 tsp butter flavored extract & instead of milk i use cream--It really cuts the sweetness to the icing!So, if you find it to sweet...Just a helpful hint to help you out,Use cream instead of milk and add 1 tsp butter flavored extract :)

absolutly the best whoopie pies i have ever eaten! I didn't have buttermilk so i use the milk and vinigar trick. They came out perfectly. The cakes came out moist and chocolaty and the filling was nice, fluffy and sweet! In my opinion this the the ultimate whoopie pie recipie. Don't hesitate to try it, you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is wonderful!  Whoopie pies are my husband's favorite, so I make them often.  Have had trouble before with flat, sticky cakes.  Not so with this recipe.  This is the best one I've tried, and I'll make it again.  One suggestion - if you are going to freeze leftovers, freeze them for 1-2 hours unwrapped first, then wrap them in wax paper and/or baggies after this time.  This will allow the creme to keep its shape and not squeeze out the sides when being wrapped.

These were amazing!  I've never had a whoopie pie, so can't judge on what they're supposed to taste like, but we loved them!  My cakes were very puffy, but good flavor and very moist.  Filling was wonderful, and oh so rich!  I followed the recipe as written (other than using buttermilk for sour milk and dark cocoa).  A couple things that might help others ... a greased cookie sheet may caused these to spread too much, but lining your sheets with parchment paper may help them keep their shape.  Also, recipe calls for "beaten egg whites", but someone else mentioned whipping to soft peaks, which is what I did ... that's what helps give the filling the light fluffy texture.   Already planning on making these again for a Christmas open house next weekend.  Thanks for introducing me to this wonderful treat!

I made these and the recipe for the cookie-cakes was absolutely amazing. the only thing i did diffently was add a tsp of vinegar to milk because i didnt have sour milk. but i didnt like the filling-even after adding more vanilla and more sugar it was still missing something next time i make  these i will look up a recipe for buttercream frosting 

i will definately make these again(with a different filling of course) =P

I am from Maine we know Whoopie Pies up here,and these were the best! My first batch were a little thin so I added a teaspoon of baking powder to the cookie part to help them rise a little better and they came out perfect! I also added a half cup of granulated sugar to the frosting to improve the texture.

Not quite the same; a little too... 'light'??  Tasted airy, maybe not sweet enough?  Something about the filling that seemed off.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! My girlfriend Liz who is from Lebanon, PA had a birthday party and requested I bring these. Actually, she wanted her favorite cake which is Black Joe Cake with Peanut Butter icing, but she is watching her figure so I made these for her in miniature form. She loved them! I did substitute the water for hot black coffee and made peanut butter icing instead of vanillla. The result was superb! Thank you Nancy for sharing your recipe; it was stellar!

These were an unqualified disaster.  I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling it and subbing 1 Tbl. vinegar plus 1 c. milk for each cup of sour milk.  They turned out like hard, dry, crumbly tasteless lumps of coal.  Didn't spread AT ALL and had more of cookie (albeit a stale cookie)-like texture than the cake-like texture that whoopie pies should have.  I'm a pretty experienced baker, but I have no idea why this didn't work for me at all, when it obviously has worked for others in the past.  Didn't bother making the filling since the cookies were so bad.

The sandwich cookies tasted not even sweet. I guess the point is that you're suppose to eat it with the filling. But don't get me started on the filling! It tasted like shortening and sugar. That's it. Will never make it again. Bakers Beware!

Very yummy! The cookie part was very moist and the filling was really fluffy (like the filling in twinkies). They were easy to make and they were a big hit with the whole family!

WOW!  What an incredible dessert! The only thing I didn't do was add the egg whites at the end cuz my filling was already fluffy and thick.  I really didn't want to mess it up!  I used dark cocoa for this recipe.  The cake part was so rich.  This recipe will so enhance my reputation!  Thank you for this awesome recipe.

I've never made Whoopie Pies before, so have nothing to compare them to, but I think these are really good. I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and they taste great.  Nice cake texture, good chocolate flavor. This recipe makes a lot and I couldn't make them all at once.  The first batch of each baking session the cookies came out flat.  Subsequent batches were round and looked the way they should.  I figured out that the baking sheets need to be warm first so I put the baking sheets in the oven when I was pre-heating it. that fixed the problem.  I used a different filling recipe so can't rate that.

These are sooooo good.  The 'pie' part is incredibly moist and delicious; while I liked the cream filling, I think I'll cut back on the sugar next time as they were a little bit too sweet for me.  Took the advice of other reviewers who suggested refrigerating/freezing them - this helped cut the sweetness after they had been allowed to chill for several hours.  Will definitely make them again; Thank you for posting this recipe!

Tasty and attractive. I use a small ice cream scoop (#50 - 1.25Tbs) to form the cookies and silicon sheets to line the baking sheet. It's fast, easy, and makes perfectly formed  2.5" diameter cookies. I fit 24 cookies onto a full sized sheet pan (18"x26"). With the #50 scoop, this recipe makes exactly 100 cookies (50 cookie sandwiches). For full flavor, absolutely do not leave out the salt. Salt is not superfluous in baking, it deepens the flavor. In fact, I increase the salt in this recipe by 1/2tsp (1.5tsp total) and it makes a better cookie.

These were awesome! I made a dark chocolate peppermint version (below). They have the perfect cake-to-filling ration. Easy to make and put together. My guests all loved them and requested another batch at christmastime.

Revision: I used DARK coco instead of regular. For the filling I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla. When filling them I colored 1/2 of the icing with red and left the other half white. Then i swirled them for a festive peppermint-stick look.

This was a excellent whoopie pie recipe. I changed just two things one was using half butter and half shortening and the other was making them red velvet whoopie pies instead of chocolate. I didn't use the filling recipe instead I made a cream cheese filling from this site the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting by Tom. These were delicious and I will definitely be making these again.

This review is for the CAKE part only, because I opted for a different peanut butter filling instead.  These little cakes were wonderful!!  I baked mine for 8 minutes exactly, as the recipe stated, and I found it to be the perfect amount of time.  To make my cakes more uniform in shape, I transferred the batter to a big freezer storage bag, cut off the tip, and piped out perfect little circles on my baking sheet.  Next time, I would definitely like to try the filling that the recipe calls for.  YUM YUM YUM!! :~)

Hm..overall I rate this a 2..for a several reasons. Quite a few came out flat. They also just have so much shortening that I felt almost guilty feeding them to my friends. :(  I would say the flavor of the actual cookie was lacking and the filling..just okay. Overall though, my co-workers said they liked them! I just didn't care for them as much...Probably wouldn't make these again unless I tried a variation..

Thanks for the recipe.
My only tips are:
--make sure you sift through the cocoa powder and flour to ensure no lumps.
--bake theses gems until they are visibly dry and firm to the touch. I used parchment paper--they move to the wire racks more easily for cooling.
I also added a bit of red food coloring and raspberry extract to the filling.  Their getting rave reviews at my office's chocolate fest!

I never ate a whoopie pie in my whole life and I am 59, can you believe it! I decided to try them to see what I have been missing. I measured out 1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon of batter for each pie half and this made a very nice size, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. I baked them for 8 minutes exactly on the middle rack in my oven and they were perfect. These were very good but I was hoping for a little more chocolate flavor. I haven't let them sit until tomorrow in the refrigerator yet though. I made scratch cream cheese frosting for the filling and that is delicious in them. I was generous with the filling putting in 2 tablespoons of filling for each completed pie. All in all, I'm glad I made them and I am enjoying them very much. I am sharing them with some friends tomorrow.

I think these are pretty good - really 3 1/2 stars...   I think the cookie could use a bit more flavor and I think I would have preferred the filling without the beaten egg whites - anyone know why that's in there?  I did use butter (instead of shortening) in the filling just b/c I had already used shortening in the cookie and I just couldn't use that much!  Overall good though.

These whoopies were exactly like they're supposed to be. The only things I did differently was use 1 cup regular milk and 1 tsp. vinegar, because I didn't have sour milk and I used probably less than half the sugar for the frosting. Just my personal preference.

never tried them before and I'm not a fan of chocolate (unlike the rest of the household) but these were great! I like the idea of piping the mix as the pies got increasingly larger as I made them in batches. Didn't use the filling as I made buttercream with extra butter flavouring which worked really well - also like the idea of adding spice to the chocolate mix. Making more today so they must've been good

The cake part was not very flavorful, and the frosting was watery and a little chunk, would not make these again.

The recipe was easy to follow and they looked beautiful, but the cookie part was kind of bland. After tasting the first batch and wishing they were sweeter, I added 1/2 c of sugar to the 2nd batch and they came out flatter so I wouldn't recommend that. The frosting, however is deliciously sweet so I would definitely use that recipe again. (Oh, but I did leave out the egg whites and it turned out well!) All in all, decent recipe and they were fun to make. Beware though, as noted before, it does make a big batch!

"Ooohhh yyaaahhhhh!" Boyfriends quote and rating.  Took some of the cakes and painted it with melted raspberry fruit spread before adding the filling. I bet it would be excellent with a liquor like Kahlua, Chambord or Frangelico...um umm.

I made these today and loved them. I trippled the recipe and had great success. It really is important to cool on the sheet for awhile. I added butter and cream cheese to the frosting.

Very good Whoopie pies! They baked perfect and were very easy to make. The only complaint I have is that they were a little dry. I brought them to the office and everyone said they were fantastic and all 32 were gone before lunch time!

the cream filling is VERY sweet! i increased the amount of flour in the batch to tone it down. this made the filling much thicker was well, which was good becuase mine came out a bit too runny, not sure why. fun recipe, serving at a BBQ.

I thought these were very good. The cookies had the texture of cake. The only thing i did not like about the recipe is that the icing in the middle was too runny but i think this might be because i used margarine instead of shortening. Next time i will use shortening!

Awesome recipe.  PA Dutch approved.  The cakes were great (not dry at all and nice & chocolate-y); we couldn't stop sniffing the batter, it just smelled so good.  The icing was great, too.  I made 1/2 a recipe.  I didn't use anywhere near as much filling as the photos show, so I had a lot left over.  I might have not beaten the egg whites enough or added a bit too much milk/vanilla/shortening vs sugar because our filling was pretty goopy and smooshed out the sides when we ate them, so a quick pop in the freezer or fridge fixed that.  Will definitely make again.  And again.

These were the PERFECT whoopie pie cookies! They were moist without falling apart, not dry at all. I made some very little to make mini whoopie pies for my son and some bigger for the adults and both sizes cooked very well. I did not use the filling shown here, as I had a ton of buttercream frosting left from another project that I tweaked and made into filling. So I can't review that part. But the cookies I will most definately use again!

These were really good and really sweet...definetly make them small, they spread!  I tried them both ways, room temp and frozen and have to say, like them better frozen, for taste as well as not so messy -- going in the favorie cookie recipe box.

I only made the cookie portion as I used homemade marshmallow fluff for the filling. I used my #50 scoop and got 62 cookies or 31 sandwiches, needed 10 minutes to bake, parchment paper is a must as they are very soft cookies. I added 1 tsp of espresso powder to the hot water to bump up the chocolate taste. I omitted the salt as I find baking soda very salty.

Delicious! I only used the cake portion of this recipe- I have my own filling that I like. But the cakes were so moist and even better the next day! However, the tops of the cakes didn't come out perfectly smooth like in the picture, but still delicious all the same!

I made these for my husband for Valentine's Day.  He couldn't get enough of them!  So good, moist and delicious.  I only made one change to the recipe...instead of 1-1/2 cups of butter in the filling, I used 1 cup of butter and 4 oz. of cream cheese.  I also misread the directions and put the egg whites in without beating them so did that after they were in the filling mixture.  Will DEFINITELY make these again!!

I had really high hopes for these based on all the rave reviews. The cookie was just plain bland. It was missing something -- certainly didn't have a chocolatey flavor. I bake frequenty and use quality ingredients so I'm not really sure what the problem was. I didn't make the filling because I had marshmallow fluff left over from another recipe so I just used that. I think I would be willing to make whoopie pies again but would certainly opt for trying a different cookie recipe.

I really liked this recipe. It was simple, easy, and delicious. I added 3 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 4 and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar instead of 2. I read other reviews that said that this was a little too sweet so I added a little less and it came out really good. Not too sweet. To the filling I added chocolate chips and that just made this recipe perfect.

Was OK, something just didn't feel/taste right. Followed recipe to the T except sour milk, used 1 cup milk with a TSP of vinegar. Pie tasted floury/dough like, think it was lacking sweetener of some sort. Filling was a bit over sweet.

These were so good.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a small cookie scoop to make all the same sized cookies.  Just like I remember my mom making.

This recipe is absolutely awesome!!!  Even better than Mom's tried and true recipe which has been passed down through a few generations.  I used butter instead of shortening.  The cookies puffed up very nicely - not flat at all.  Very moist and yummy.  I used my own filling - buttercream icing.  Definitely took care of my sweet tooth!!

We made these recently for some out of town company and they were a huge hit. The only thing I did differently was the frosting - I used regular butter cream icing since I refuse to do anything with raw, uncooked eggs.

I was having a sweet tooth craving, and these definately did the trick!! I dont think I could recommend a better Whoopie Pie recipe for the cookie/cake part!! I did use a different recipe for the filling because I tend to like the cooked filling versions better. These turned out so moist and perfect!! I did not have any buttermilk on hand, so I added a Tablespoon fresh lemon juice to the cup of sweet milk and that worked out fine. They have such a delicate flavor, not overpowering and not bland either. I will be using this recipe again and often!!

I have never made whoopie pies before, but they turned out great. I made them for my son’s class and he told me he gained popularity over them. I had moms tell me that their child couldn’t stop talking about them and wanted the recipe. It makes a lot but I used a cookie scoop for the cake and the filling and the size was perfect for putting them into cupcake papers and carrier to take to school. Everything was perfect!!

I don't use shortening so I used coconut oil. This made the batter very runny like cake batter so I added one more cup of flour. Since others said that the cake part could use more flavor, I added 1/2 t. of salt, 1t. of  vanilla and 1/2 bag of mini chocolate chips. This seemed to help the flavor. I followed another's suggestion of using marshmallow fluff for the filling. These turned out very tasty and the family loves them. Next time I will try a whole bag of chocolate chips and butter instead of shortening.

Just like my mum used to make when we were kids.  The batter is thick so it gives you nice cakes and the filling is thick also.  These are the best and I've tried a LOT of whoopee pie recipes.

This recipe was easy to follow but both cake and filling lacked flavor. The cake especially was bland and the filling tasted of pure sugar which was not satisfying. The form of everything came out fine. But if the flavor isn't right it defeats the whole thing.  As one other commenter suggested - maybe some cream cheese would overcome the dullness in the cakes and the sweetness in the filling. I would make these again since I'm still craving for that whoopie pie - but only if the flavor improved.... *sigh* luckily I didn't use all of the batch so I may add some stuff to it to see if anything improves.

UPDATE:

I really did not like the filling and since I had extra cake batter left, I decided to make a cream cheese filling. The taste was so much better! So if you don't like the filling, try the cream cheese.

This review is just for the cake.  I used a different recipe for the filling.
I searched and searched for a recipe without vegetable shortening and could not find one. So, I took a chance and used this recipe and substituted the shortening with unsalted, softened butter.  These turned out great!  The texture is light and fluffy but firm enough for frosting.  I didn't change anything else.  The oven temperature and time were spot-on!  I used a small cookie scoop to make the size uniform.  I'm excited to be able to make these homemade for my husband who's from Maine and grew up eating his mom's Whoopie Pies.

I made these to bring into work for a coworker's birthday. Everyone loved them. I'm not a huge fan of whoopie pies normally because they're too sweet or mushy but these were great! I made them exactly as the recipe states. Both the cream and the cake were light and fluffy. The only downside is that it is a bit time consuming if you are not modifying the serving amount. I only have two cookie sheets and I was able to get 40 pies (80 cake halves), so I was definitely in and out of the oven a lot. But absolutely worth it!

The cookie was a little bland and the cream needed more creamy taste.  I saw quite a few guests only had half eaten their Whoopie pie. I will be trying a different Whoopie pie recipe next time for sure.

Since it was a new to me recipe, made 1/2 of it. EZ as can be. One of the critical reviews suggested "meh" for the cake, maybe so, and in that vein I used 1/2 regular cocoa and 1/2 "special dark" cocoa. In place of hot water w/the baking soda, I used brewed strong coffee. Not bad!

This was my first time ever making Whoopie pies, These turned out very well! I added a bit of extra vanilla to the batter which seemed to work well. Other wise no changes and boyfriend approved :)

Update 7/28/17 - Ive made this recipe many of times now! I still say add extra vanilla to the batter. The only other change I had to make was the baking time. 8 minutes at 400 is just too long! I go to 6.5 minutes or so. If i bake the full time as written they get dry and dark on the bottoms. I use a small ice cream scooper to put them on the pans and I also use parchment paper to avoid sticking.

I love this recipe! They taste great and look incredible. I added 1/2 cup extra cocoa powder because I wanted it to be more chocolaty. But otherwise it was an excellent recipe.

These were very good. Except the filling was waaay too sweet, so the 2nd time I made them I used 1 C flour and only 3 C of confectioners sugar. They were much better that way but still just a hair too sweet so next time I might cut another 1/2 C of confectioners sugar out of the filling.

The only word to describe these was AMAZING. I made these for party in conjunction with some pumpkin Whoopie Pies from this site as I wasn't sure everyone would like pumpkin and they were both sooo good. I can't wait to make these again. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly!

I used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 4, since I felt it was sweet enough.

This rating is for the base, which was good for whoopie pies, everyone loved them ( I used a different filling made from marshmallow fluff).   I used a #40 scoop and the recipe made 33 double cookies (66 total).  Outside edges were nicely crisp, inside delightfully moist.

So, I attempted to make some strawberry shortcake fudge for Valentine's Day baskets.  I was terribly upset when it refused to set up- it tasted delicious, but fudge it was not.  Out of nowhere, like a beacon in the darkness, I had a Eureka moment- whoopie pies!  But, I had never made them before, and surely I could never pull it off.  With nothing to lose, I opted to try my hand at this recipe.  These gorgeous little fluffy rounds of chocolately heaven could not have been simpler to make.  I then set to the task of making my "fudge" more frosting-like.  I was able to get it to a good, spreadable consistency, and filled the little whoopie pies with the strawberry yuminess.  I found I had to tightly wrap them immediately in plastic wrap in order to stop them from sliding, and then they set up beautifully in the fridge.  This creation is a bona fide masterpiece.  It is too bad I am not likely to ever be able to recreate it (with my luck, when I go to try the fudge again it will work, since I actually won't want it to)!!!!  But, no matter, for the next time I will try the filling recipe that goes with the cookies in this recipe.  I can't wait.  These ARE the whoopie pies (gobs) I have been eating and loving ever since I moved to Pennsylvania.  They are the real deal, and everyone should make them!  Today!  Right now!  Quit reading, and get in your kitchen!  Are you still here?  Go!  Thanks Nancy  :)

This is a great recipe.  I actually used a jar of Fluff in place of the egg whites and flour in the frosting.

The 5 stars are for the cookies they are very good, I tried another recipe and this is better by far. And now for the frosting, it was fine until I added the beaten egg whites which didn't fold in so I beat them in. Does the powdered egg white make a difference? Anyway...this filling is much nicer than the marshmallow cream one which is too sweet. God bless.

I wanted to love this recipe and I was excited to make it.  However, I was dissapointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The cake portion seemed to be missing something.

I didn't love this recipe (of course, I could just not love whoopie pies in general).  I thought that the cream in the middle had a nice taste - not bland at all.  I just wasn't impressed with the cookie part.  I think, for me, it wasn't sweet enough.  I love sweet deserts, and I thought that this would be one, but after making them (and then reading the reviews) I realized that this probably is not supposed to be very sweet.  I took them to a party and people seemed to like them, but didn't go crazy over them - I was trying to give them away at the end of the night.
