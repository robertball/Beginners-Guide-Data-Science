This cake is very delicious. It came out just right. I iced it with the Wedding Cake Icing on this site and it was a hit.  All the kids loved it. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

I've baked this cake twice in the past 2 months.  Once for my son's 2nd birthday and one for Valentine's day.  First time I baked it, I used a 9x13 pan it was a little on the dry side, and it had air pocket holes throughout the cake...still delicious though.  Second time I made it I added a bit more milk, used a donut cake pan and tapped the pan on the counter a few times before I put it in the oven... needless to say I almost ate the whole darn cake myself!!  Delicious, moist and no air pocket holes.  I used a butter icing on the cake and it was to die for!!!

Favor was good, but it did come out a little dry.  Next time I will try substituting drained applesauce for 1/2 the shortening.  I have found this helps keep baked goods moist.

This cake was great. It was just perfect topped with crushed strawberries! Yes it is a little dry, but that is just what we needed since the strawberries are runny. Thanks!

Normally, I use a regular cake mix with a few extra ingredients and LOVE it, but since I couldn't find a mix in the house, I decided to try this one.  Not sure what I did wrong.  It was a bit dry, despite the extra milk I added.  Am I the only one who thought this tasted sour?  The consistency was more like cornbread...not a very sweet cake at all.  My husband liked it, but said he still preferred the box mix.  I would have thrown it out.

I just made this cake, and it was dry, crumbly and very disappointing. I now have to start all over with a different recipe and go to the store to get more ingredients. I will never make this cake again, and would not recommend it.

The cake looked great but it sunk in the middle.  So, I just went ahead and frosted and decorated to cover it.  NOBODY like the cake.  It was dry ! I wouldn't recommended anyone making it.
