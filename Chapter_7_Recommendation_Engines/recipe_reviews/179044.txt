Excellent! I sauteed spinach and mushrooms before adding in the chicken, which I cut into thin strips. I also added a can of petite diced garlic and olive oil tomatoes in at the end. This was definitely a restaurant quality meal!

Delicious!!!! Great base recipe that I just added 2 more ingredients to - 1/2 cup frozen spinach (thawed) and 1/4 cup Kraft Parmesan, Romano, & Asiago cheese mix - this was a delicious recipe that is now a favorite! I had actually made it two nights before and let it in the fridge it was awesome and the chicken picked up so much flavor!

My family & I loved this recipe. They raved about this dish for days after we had it. However, I did a few things differently from the recipe: I made my own pesto, and didn't QUITE use an entire 1/2 cup if it. I used spiral pasta instead of bowtie. I added white wine & extra virgin olive oil to the butter/margarine. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder, pepper, and poultry seasoning while I cooked it. I used bone-in chicken, so I ended up having to bake mine at 350 for 30 mins.

I thought this was ok.  I was really excited about it bc of the reviews, but thought the soup over powered the pesto flavor and almost left it bland.

I already had some chicken flavored rice that I made yesterday,so used that instead of the pasta.My pesto sauce is from  Sam's Club & I used the Fat-Free soup & non-fat milk. Added a little extra garlic & topped w parm. cheese.  A quick & easy meal that will satisfy my family.

This was really, really good. The soup was overpowering but I added more pesto and that did the trick. Will skip the milk next time. Used leftover cooked chicken.

Wow...what a great meal!! I also, added a few items...
Sauteed red bell peppers and mushrooms in butter and heavy garlic. Green onions(uncooked). All for color. After the recipe was completed, I baked it on 400 for 25 mins. Before serving. I sprinkled each serving with shredded parmesan cheese. The family loved it.

Doubled the recipe and made it for a grown family of 6. Forgot to buy an extra can of cream of chicken so I used a can of cream of mushroom and it was delicious! It was more than enough and everyone ate it for breakfast and lunch the next day. That's saying a lot because this isn't really a leftover kind of family. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful base recipe.  Took others' suggestions as well and saut√©ed the chicken in a little olive oil and minced garlic in addition to the butter.  Also added half a bag of thawed and drained frozen chopped spinach and added more milk to make it creamier.  To have more veggies, I thinly chopped 2 zucchini and cooked them separately with a little olive oil and black pepper (sauce was salty enough) and added it to the sauce.  Also didn't mix the pasta in but served it with the sauce on top.  The family loved it!!

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was delicious. My wife, my food critic/critiquer, says "You should save this recipe," so that I did. I did make a couple changes. I sauteed about 2.5 cups of frozen vegetables(baby corn, brocolli, yellow squash)and 1.5 Tbs of minced garlic. I set this aside and then browned my chicken using EVOO as a healthier alternative to butter. During the cooking process I seasoned my chicken with Seasoning Salt, garlic powder, and Poultry Seasoning. I then added the sauteed vegetables and soup, milk,pesto, plus added about a third of a cup of white Moscato,and a cup of grated parmesan cheese(I made a double serving).

This was very good because it was tasty and SIMPLE!  My kids and husband both liked it.  I used the sun dried tomato pesto, sauteed the chicken in olive oil and garlic.  I topped it with some chopped fresh basil.  Delicious!

This was extremely quick and easy. I wanted a variation of the plain pesto pasta that my boyfriend loves so much and I don't care for so much. This was a great recipe. I just added asparagus tips and a little oregano and this was PERFECT.!

Great recipe! As others suggested, I started by cooking the chicken in some olive oil and garlic. I also added some spinach and mushrooms as it was cooking. I threw in some diced tomatoes at the end, which added some nice color to the mix. Served it on top of pasta and everyone enjoyed it!

This recipe was so quick and easy! I didnt have bowtie pasta so I used a garden blend Rotini.  It was delicious.  Next time, I will add fresh mushroom and maybe a little Rotel. Although, the recipe is delicious as is!

This is a quick and easy chicken dish that is surprisingly good.  I added a couple handfuls of fresh spinach to the sauted chicken, then added about a half cup of parmesan to the sauce as another reviewer suggested.  I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes at the end.  You can play with this recipe to make it your own.  I'll be making this again.

Great recipe. It's easy, fast,  and also is a good "pantry dish". What I mean by that is that you can stock your pantry for this well in advance and make it when ever you want with very little needed from the store.  A jar of pesto sauce will last a couple years unopened,  dry pasta lasts for ever,  I used some frozen spinach like others recommended,  which you can get in small packs that stack well, canned condensed soup will outlast the next great war. pick up some chicken and you're set.

I thought this was a little bland as written, although it may have just been the pesto I used. I added some garlic, salt, pepper, and broccoli, and then it turned out pretty tasty. My little ones liked it, too. Will try using homemade pesto next time.

I used this recipe primarily for the sauce which was very good.  I had tortellini from Costco which needed a creamy pesto sauce.  I didn't have Cream of Chicken soup but did have Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used the pesto sauce from Costco and 1 cup of milk (didn't want a very thick sauce).  It was so good! I will make again!!

This recipe was quick & tasted great! I seasoned the chicken breast before cooking, & also added spinach & mushrooms when he chicken was almost done cooking (per another reviewers suggestion). My husband is picky, & he loved it too! Definitely a keeper!

This was definitely ridiculously easy and the hubby loved it (needed a quick lunch to take to work the next day and had 2 thawed chicken breasts), so this is an awesome cabinet meal. I can see how tomatoes would be a nice addition (fresh or canned). Seasoned the chicken breast with Cavender's Greek seasoning (will use a bit more next time) with olive oil instead of butter and 8 oz crimini mushrooms. Froze half the sauce for later and will update on how it works out after we defrost and use it!

This was delicious! Made a few changes from what others suggested- I added mushrooms and spinach and saut√©ed with garlic and olive oil before adding the chicken. Also used nearly two pounds of chicken and full pound of pasta (my guy can put some serious food away) .. But other than that, it was awesome! And I'm my worst critic for sure.. I'll take a little credit for This one :)

I made this, very easy.  Next time I would go lighter on the pesto.  The 1/2 cup was a little overpowering , even though I really like pesto.

Loved it.  I used canned chicken, but still browned it up in a bit of butter... some rotini noodles (what we had on hand), and some pecorino romano cheese sprinkled on top.  Delish.  Even the kids ate dinner - a winner.

I decided to make this recipe because it seemed simple enough. I had made this for my roommates and I. I had made eight cups of the bow tie with 1.5 lb of chicken. I used a whole glass jar of pesto sauce with the one can of campbell's cream of chicken and 1/2 cup of milk. I added my own spices with the chicken. This was recipe was great. My roommates and I loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic starter recipe!  Like some others have suggested, I doctored it up a bit. I used chicken marinated with a balsamic vinegar/garlic marinade. I also sauteed some minced garlic, onions, mushrooms and spinach with the chicken and seasoned it with some dried Italian seasoning before adding the soup and pesto. Quite tasty and easy - a combination that is definitely appreciated!

So good. I made a few revisions - one, I made it with mushroom soup because that's all I had on hand. I used olive oil to saut√© the chicken for a healthier option instead of the butter. I added diced onion, a clove of garlic and sliced mushrooms. It was easy, fast and we loved it! I would definitely make it again.

So good! This is my new, easy weeknight dinner. I didn‚Äôt have bow-tie pasta so I subbed in penne and it worked perfectly. I also used a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, a 1/2 tsp. of garlic and 2/3 of a cup of pesto. So easy, and so delicious!

This is a favorite at my house. Quick and easy. I always keep a jar of pesto for this meal. I make this as is maybe with a little less pesto. The kids love it. I also make with sun dried tomato pesto which might even be better.

This was fantastic! I added fresh, diced tomatoes and fresh spinach in the last 5 minutes of cooking, and it came out great.

This should be called ‚Äúnothin but pesto pasta‚Äù. I like pesto but 1/2 cup is outrageous. I followed the recipe, but next time I‚Äôd 1/4 cup pesto and add some veggies like mushrooms or spinach and some additional seasonings like garlic or oregano.

I always ask my husband to do a taste test to see if anything needed to be added. I thought it was good just the way it was. That being said, I think next time I will add saut√©ed mushrooms and maybe some saut√©ed garlic.

I don't usually like pesto dishes but this was delicious. I did modify the final product by adding mushrooms, spinach and diced tomatoes as other cooks had done.

This has become one of our new favorites in my house!!! I've made it a few times. I followed the recipe the first time exactly and I loved it. The next couple times the only thing I did different was add spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to it!! Thank you for sharing we love it!

Just made this tonight for my family.  My oldest child is 6 and is extremely picky and never eats her dinner. She really enjoyed this new and cleared her plate! I put a little less pesto since we were trying it out for the first time but I will add in more next time.  Husband has asked me to keep it on our dinner rotation Meal plan.

I made this exactly like the recipe and my husband and I thought it was great!  It's a fast, easy recipe perfect for during the work week. My husband said it would be a great meal to cook if you're feeling sick since it tastes so chicken-y. We made 4 servings and my husband had seconds and I took some for lunch the next day.

I made 2 changes: I don't use condensed soup so I started off making my own, then I threw in some leftover grilled chicken that I cubed. Went on from there. Easy and yummy! Will make again!

This was great, I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand. Instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom soup and cheese tortellini instead of the bow tie pasta. I also added chopped onion and garlic to the chicken when I cooked it.

This was quite good.  I didn't have bowtie pasta so I used penne.  I did saute onion before adding the chicken and added some garlic powder.  I mixed in broccoli at the end and topped with parmesan cheese.  Will probably make this again.

Such a good recipe!! We used cavatappi pasta instead of bow ties because it was what we had in our pantry but still very good. I also added parmesan cheese as suggested by reviews and breadcrumbs on top and broiled it for about 3 minutes and it was excellent. Definitely will make again :)

I used rice milk and a 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream for added thickness, and thus added another 1/4 pesto. I also added some brocolli and cauliflower! By far my favorite pesto recipe!!

this was a huge hit. I am a college student living with two other girls. I was able to buy all the stuff I needed to make it for under 20$ (nice when living on a budget) I did however change it up a bit. instead of breasts I used boneless, skinless thighs because they are so much juicier. I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and wine then deglazed the pan with more wine. For the sauce I used cream of chicken mushroom soup, lots of pesto (someone had mentioned the soup slightly over powered the pesto), parmesan cheese, goat cheese and a touch more wine (can you see a theme here?) But it turned out amazingly. Definitely making this again soon.

Tasty!! I wanted an easy weeknight recipe and this was it. I used about 4 leftover cooked chicken legs (chopped), veggie pasta (penne), carrot green pesto, and added grated carrots to the mix. Tossed on some fresh ground pepper and a little coarse salt, and served with a crisp green salad. Yum!!

Quick and good as written.  Since we're garlic lovers, I added garlic to the chicken and extra pesto - but relatively fast to make and a great way to make a skillet meal for the whole family.

So SO yummy! I was a bit skeptical about trying this (as I am about all new recipes)... But it's amazing! And extremely easy to make! I used organic Gemelli noodles, and added grape tomatoes, a little Alfredo sauce, and some Parmesan cheese to the top - which made it even more perfect then it already was. This is a must try.

What an absolutely lovely recipe! This one is a keeper, for sure. I didn't have any chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom instead. And it tasted great! Because we like things cheesy, I sprinkled Kraft Tex Mex cheese on top! Overall a definite crowd pleaser!

Just made this tonight. I was looking for something quick and easy for chicken. So glad I found this.  I  used olive oil instead of the butter and seasoned with Kroger's equivalent to Mrs. Dash garlic blend, salt - free seasoning,   garlic powder and sun-dried tomatoes. I  like the idea of adding spinach and mushrooms. I'll have to try that next time.  Also think it would be good with peas. Thanks for the recipe.

Really like the baseline for this pasta dish. As I was making it and tasting as I went along, I already started to have ideas of what to add for the next time. For the chicken I added Italian seasoning. Allowed for chicken to cook on both side for about 5-6min. Cut after cooking chicken into strips then let simmer in pan with sauce.

I cooked this recipe the other day and it met my expectation! I pretty much followed the whole recipe except I used homemade pesto that has more garlic in it... The recipe doesn't need anymore seasoning IMO...definitely adults and kids tested! Great with garlic cheese bread!:)

This wasn't a hit with the adults, but the kids loved it.  Oddly, it didn't taste like much of anything (I used a good quality, simple recipe pesto- maybe that's where it went wrong?).  It was a little garlicky from the pesto but there was no big punch of flavor like I was expecting.  The consistency of the sauce was nice and it was easy to make, so that's a plus. I will keep the recipe handy in case the kids ask for it again, but I'd probably only make it on a date night when it's just them eating.   I can see the appeal, and it wasn't horrible, but it isn't something I'm pushed to make again or even feel compelled to tweak to get the flavors I want it.  I'd give it an additional half star if I could.

I made this with using fat free spray butter when cooking the chicken. I also replaced the pesto sacue with making my own from the Knorr packet, I use fat free I cant believe it's not butter spray in making it and it turns out yummy. I also use fat free half and half in place of milk. This is by far my favorite dish I think I've made in quite some time. Take in mind I am pregnant so my judgement may be altered, but I know this will be a staple in my house for years to come. I cant wait to have some friends over just to make it. Also it doesnt look to appetizing, but dont let that fool you!!

So good!  I didn't have pesto sauce on hand so I just added spinach and Parmesan cheese and it was really tasty!

Awesome and super quick! I cooked this for seven people so I had to triple everything up (and had some left overs). I also added sundried tomatoes (the ones that come in oil), bell peppers and mushrooms and topped it with fresh parmasean!

Pretty good. The sauce was a little too thick...will definitely add a little water or extra milk next time. I browned my chicken in olive oil with garlic powder and pepper. I also added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and some freshly diced tomatoes to the sauce.

Made as directed with Classico Pesto and added some fresh diced tomatoes.  Was pretty good, a little salty with the Campbells soup, so think I'd add a little less than directed next time.

I added garlic, onion and mushrooms.  My family of 6 loved it and it could have fed 7, so there are leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.  That is a double win!

Made as is.  I don't think there's anything over the top with this.  It's ok.  Not sure if I'll make again.

I doubled the recipe and used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken. I left the milk out on accident. It turned out yummy.

This is a really simply delicious meal.  The recipe is great as is or with personal variations.  I really like it with spiral pasta and sun dried tomato pesto.  Mmmm...

This was good, but nothing amazing. I sauteed spinach, mushrooms and a couple of chopped roma tomatoes before adding the chicken which I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I think I would have a preferred a sauce made with heavy cream rather than the cream of chicken soup.

We enjoyed this. I used whole wheat pasta and added tomatoes. My husband thought the sauce was really good and preferred it to plain ol' pesto.

This is so easy. I cut my chicken up in small pieces and added a cup of pesto like another reviewer suggested. It was delicious.

A good twist on pasta.  I used about 1 c. of pesto and added some frozen spinach I had on hand.  Then I topped it with some Parmesan cheese just before serving.
