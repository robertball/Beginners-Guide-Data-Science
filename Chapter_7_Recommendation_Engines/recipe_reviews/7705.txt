This is an excellent recipe.  I played with the fruits added - included dried cherries, bleuberries and cranberries to substitute for some of the raisins.  I also included some chopped candied papaya and pineapple.  The key is mixing all the fruit with the flour first.  That way the fruit does not sink to the bottom of the cake.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I hate fruitcake... BUT this was actually really tasty. It's strong, moist, and not at all bland. My step-dad loves fruitcake and has asked me to make it every Christmas from now on... I guess I will be using this recipe for the next 25+ years since he's only 50.

Wonderful fruitcake. Easy to make. It made 10 small loaves and baked in 2 hrs. It is moist, heavy and very rich. It is a keeper.

Used pecans instead of walnuts.  Sprinkled a tablespoon of brandy over each loaf for 7 days before serving.  Everyone loved it.

Fantastic recipe i did switch out some of the raisins for chopped dried apricots and figs. This recipe makes a lot of fruitcake.

This recipe is awesome!! I changed it a little bit because I used ingredients I already had. I soaked the fruit on spiced rum for about a day. I drained it and saved the left over rum which had turned a wine color and it was syrupy. I didn't have canned pineapple so I used some of the rum to compensate for moisture. I also used fresh squeezed orange juice, so I added the zest of the oranges I used to the batter. I made a bunch of mini cakes to give away for Christmas. Even people who don't really like fruitcakes wanted me to bake them another one! I will definitely keep using this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing!
