I made this gravy for my spice loving husband. It was ok and something very different from the gravy we're used to having. But he did say if he had the choice, he would choose brown gravy or milk gravy over this.

It was pretty good. I was hoping for more of a chicken flavor than chili.

I added some chopped shrimp and crawfish cooked with Cajun seasoning. It countered what I felt was an overpowering green Chile flavor. It turned out absolutely amazing over mashed potatoes. Wonderful recipe!

Tasted like a green chili sauce. Not a gravy whatsoever.

We LOVE green chilies and put them in anything we can think of. The BEST thing I have found to pair this gravy with is my green chile roast...it pairs perfectly! You can even use the roast drippings as your base instead of the water/buillion

Delicious and easy! I left a few chunks in the chile pur√©e for a pop of intense flavor here and there! Great recipe, thanks! ~ Tamara
