This was an awesome dish. I used the same spice mixture (1/2 tsp Korean red pepper powder) as my homemade kimchi spice mixture and it was great!

I love this recipe but like the tartness n more than the sweet so I add 1/4 c water and sugar and 1/2 c vinegar which makes it perfect for me!

It didn't say to rinse the salt off the cucumbers. I didn't and I think it turned out very salty. I followed the directions to a tee except for that step. I believe it would have been much better had I rinsed the cucumbers before pressing them in paper towels. Will try again. I toasted the sesame seeds for 1-1/2 minutes on high in the microwave, flipping them every 15 seconds. Worked great!

Made this recipe as a bonchon for the easy beef bulgogi recipe from AR for our 2018 Winter Olympics party. Turned out good, but I probably marinated a bit too long (recipe calls for 1h, I made it the night before...). In addition, I did not wash the salt off after salting the  cukes, which led it to be saltier than I wanted. The balance of flavors was good though, not too spicy. I will make this again.

Fantastic!  This is one of the few ways I can get vegetables into my 13-year-old.

7 29 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/233417/refreshing-korean-cucumber-salad/ ... So here I am ready to review & realized I forgot an ingredient - the rice wine.  Okay, I forgot the gin.  Yeah, I read it's a good sub when used for marinades.  Too bad I don't have any.  I bet that would add to the "refreshing" part of this.   Darn! ... Well, I sweated the cucs, then rinsed 'em.  Halved the recipe, but not the sesame oil - my mistake - but it wasn't too much.  A slightly tangy, even slightly-er sweet (ha) tad bit spicy dish.  'Missed the comment about subbing crushed red & subbed with 1/2t cayenne.  'Wish I had some gin.  :/

This is a delicious recipe that is easy to put together.  Like some other reviewers I thought that it would be to salty as set out.   I rinsed the cuke slices in fresh water to get out some of the salt. It worked.  I used a tbsp of cri
Used red pepper and 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper as we didn't have any Korean peppers.  It tasted great. Thought that I was back in Seoul.
