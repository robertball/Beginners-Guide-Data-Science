I was skeptical when I saw 3 cans of soup go into this and I almost deleted it until I read the 1st reviewer which stated my concerns with the soup and that it would have a processed taste which she stated didn't. I decided to try it. I used 50% less fat Land of Lakes Margarine to cut down on the fat. It takes a 3 quart or 9 x 13 in casserole dish which isn't stated in the recipe. I decided to give this a try thinking I would regret it but not only didn't I regret it I LOVED IT.  It's fast, easy and it does not have a processed taste which I expected.  I warned everyone ahead of time that it might not be great but it was an easy meal.  Everyone said "what do you mean it's not great we love it". I have to agree.  If you're looking for a relatively fast easy meal that's tasty this one is one you might want too consider. No processed taste at all.  It was done in an hour and only prep time really was cutting up the chicken breast. Only change I made was to add some Her*box chicken seasoning (which I think is the best) to the mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Most recipes call for the chicken to be cooked prior to baking but this one didn't and I wasn't sure about it but after an hour I pulled a chicken bit out of the center and temperature checked it and it was done. My family really liked this and I will definitely be making this again and again.  It's easy and tasty. If you are in need of a fast and tasty meal this one fits the bill.

I enjoyed this recipe as did the rest of the family. I used long grain white rice. Not instant.
Boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. Substituted the water with chicken broth.
Added a cup of sharp cheddar  based on other suggestions.1/8 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp poultry
 seasoning. Omitted the salt due to the broth. This was a great simple recipe base , very tasty.
Thank you for sharing. I will make it again and again.

My mom made this recipe all the time when I was growing up and I have always loved it.  She made it with a few changes though which is how I prepare it as well.  Instead of two cups of water I use one cup of water and one cup of milk.  I layer the rice on the bottom, then the chicken and then I melt the half stick of butter and mix it in with the rest of the ingredients and pour all of that on top.  Then I sprinkle a thick layer of parmesan cheese on top.  This is my go-to recipe when I bring someone a meal and people always say they love it.

I made a lot of adjustments to get this to be a tasty dinner--used rotisserie chicken, chicken broth instead of water, added poultry seasoning, shredded cheddar cheese, saut√©ed onions, mushrooms, peas and carrots, and subbed brown rice instead of white.

It was a hit with my family.  I used instant brown rice instead of white. To save time I and add flavor I sauteed some onions, carrots and the chicken cubes before mixing them with the soup, rice & water.  I covered it and it was done in 25 minutes.  Sprinkled parmesean on the top instead of butter and put it in uncovered for 5 minutes.

As is, this recipe is a little bland but good. I made it last night for the second time and made the following changes to liven it up: 
*chicken broth(reduced sodium) instead of water
*2 cans cream of chicken, 1 cream of mushroom, no cream of celery 
*seasoned the chicken with garlic and pepper prior to mixing, I did not add any salt because with the cans of soup and chicken broth this recipe has enough sodium already
*used margarine instead of butter and used about half what this calls for (you could get away with not using any)
70 minutes was the perfect cook time for me 
I garnished this with green onions and peppered bacon (only because I had them in the fridge and they needed to be used). The bacon added great flavor. This is a good recipe as is and a great base to make your own adjustments to.

Added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, bag of frozen chopped broccoli, and a cup or so of shredded sharp cheddar half in mix half on top. Baked covered covered 40 mins and uncovered 30 and it was done. Also added chicken bullion cube to water and dissolved before adding to mix. Delicious.

I loved this recipe. I was surprised by how yummy it was. I followed the recipe but customized it a little by adding 1/4 tsp each of basil, rosemary, and thyme and 1 tsp of garlic powder and 3 tsp chicken bouillon,   since I had no broth. I also cut the butter in half because I was concerned it would be much too much. Like some of the other reviewers, I sprinkled about 1 cup of cheddar on top. The cheese and butter created the most delicious crust! I was impressed. :)

Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making this again.

Edit: Forgot to mention I used regular long-grain white rice, not instant, if that matters. =)

First, I brined 2 big boneless, skinless breasts for 24 hours (just 2 C water and 2 heaping T Kosher salt). I cut the chicken into 1" cubes and placed them in a 9" x 13" Pyrex dish. I combined the 2 cups of Uncle Ben's rice (not instant) with 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, and a 14 oz can of chicken broth. Poured this over the chicken cubes; dotted the top with slices of margarine (one stick), and about 3/4 C. Panko crumbs. Baked it at 400 covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for another 25 minutes. This is excellent, comfort food at its best! 
(and the heck with all the haters just b/c I changed a couple things)
Thanks to katie, the original submitter, for a KEEPER! I also posted this on Facebook!

So... I messed up on this recipe, but it still turned out pretty good. I pre-cooked everything not realizing the recipe calls for everything to be baked together raw. But I gotta say, I think it turned out great how I did it (also takes less time than how the recipe calls for you to make). So I cooked the rice and chicken and mixed it all together with the rest of the ingredients. It wasnt until I got to this point where I realized I messed up, I was already asking my husband what he wanted for Whataburger (thinking it would turn out gross), but I pressed on and baked anyway. And again, I was surprised. It baked for maybe 20 minutes and turned out great. So if I make this again, thats how I'm cookin it!

I think this is my favorite recipe I've found ever.  I've already made it probably a dozen times.  NY whole family loves it.  I make it as written,  except  I add a bag of frozen broccoli before I throw it in the oven.  That way I can justify that it's healthy cause there's a veggie in it :)  I also sprinkle cheddar on top the last 8 min of cooking..  Screaming good recipe,  thanks so much for posting this

Surprisingly this was good and not one bit was left at the end of the meal. I know I was totally skeptical about all the cans of soup in this recipe. But it worked and it was delicious when it came out of the oven. No complicates were made at all. Will make again.

This is a great basic recipe that can be tailored to your family's tastes. I've made it 3 times so far and never done it the same way twice. I've used chicken broth and milk in lieu of water, added peas and poultry seasoning, used a combo of leftover cooked and uncooked rice, added cheese... The possibilities are endless!!! The best part of this recipe is that you don't need to precook the chicken. Just dice it up and throw it in with everything else. I found that mixing it all up in a bowl and then putting it in the 9x13 baking dish cuts down on the overflow when you're trying to mix it in the baking dish itself. I'd say the butter on top is optional, it just depends on how rich you want to make it. I've found you can also use any mixture of creamed soups so really, whatever is in the cupboard, go with it. Adding milk instead of water makes the whole dish creamier. My husband prefers when I use chicken broth. He says there is more flavor that way. Again, whatever your family likes, doctor it up and experiment a little!

I make this recipe all the time. I throw in whatever canned or frozen veggies I have on hand as well as any other spices I feel like.Sometimes I will put in some minced onion and bits of leftover shredded cheese. I always have instant rice and raw frozen chicken breast... So it is great for a working mom to do a quick defrost and throw this thing together and into the oven. My two picky girls love it (and it is a good way to sneak in some veggies)

I made this easy casserole there is no really way to mess this up.. but you can enhance it by adding some poultry seasoning ,  sauteed  1/2 cup chopped onions, a table spoon of minced garlic, I mixed the cans of soup in a bowl & used chicken stock instead of water.. I also topped it with sargento extra sharp cheese w/ some Parmesan cheese mixed in w/ panko & crushed garlic herb croutons which created great texture to the dish.. for the first 40 minutes cooked covered .. then ad the toppings cook uncovered for the last 20 minutes..... DELICIOUS

Haven't made this yet, reading reviews , don't change the whole recipe then give it 3 stars, also, no need to write ugly comments. I have found that adding a package of Good Seasoning Italian Dressing to chicken casseroles kicks them up a notch

We loved this recipe! It was so easy to make and I made a few adjustments to the recipe such as substituting a can of cream of chicken with a can if broccoli, added 1/2 tsp of paprika, 1cup of mild cheddar cheese, and only added 1/2 stick of butter instead of a stick of butter. My boyfriend said j could make this anytime and that says A LOT if it's coming from him!!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of adding 1 package of broccoli florets. I boiled the broccoli just enough to thaw them out. Added the broccoli at the last 30 minutes of cooking time. It came out perfect!! Now tonight I will take the leftovers and reheat them with melted cheese on top. So excited to have it again tonight.

When trying a new recipe the first time I try to stick with the original recipe and...
Great comfort food. Filling . Delicious .
Doesn't have processed taste.
Fast easy. 
I Made a 2nd time  . Everybody fine tunes a recipe to meet personal tastes and family needs .  So this is mine. I saut√©ed  cut up chicken in some butter , minced garlic and finely chopped onion.  Used chicken broth  instead of water.  I'm not a mushroom person so just used more cream of chicken.  Topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

Wow how much easier could this recipe be? My family devoured it! I added one more cup of instant white rice and a cup of milk to even out the liquid/rice ratio and to add a little extra creaminess to it. I was hesitant to add the entire amount of butter but we're a butter lovin' family of WI. I think next time I'll add some veggies inside the casserole; maybe some broccoli, celery, carrots... Either way, this was an awesome EASY recipe that will definitely be added to the diner rotation! Thank you

I have fixed this several times, & my family of 5 kids have eaten every bit of it!  Tonite I used chicken broth instead of water and added shredded Cheddar cheese!  The chicken broth really brought out the flavor.

I made this recipe last night for my family. It was wonderful. I changed a few things. I cooked the onions because of my children and I added some chopped fresh broccoli to it. Everyone loved it. I also enjoyed that it was so easy and did not require too many ingredients.

After other reviews warned it was bland, I added onion powder, garlic powder, and thyme to it. It's not bad but tastes quite a lot like one of those instant rice meals you can get in a baggy at the store, so...not really worth all the extra time and effort.
Hint for those looking to try it: If it looks soupy on top after baking it, DON'T put it back in any longer, just stir it before serving.

This recipe deserves the 5 stars. I modified the seasoning as many pointed out the lack of flavor. I know the recipe calls for mixing and pouring in the casserole dish. This is the first thing I changed: I cooked my chicken previously seasoned with 2 crushed garlic cloves,a pinch of both curry powder and paprika, and pepper to taste. I cooked it for about 10 minutes. Then, I proceeded as directed in the recipe replacing the water for low sodium chicken broth. This latter will  adjust the salt content and will give flavor to the recipe as opposed to using just water.. I did not have instant rice therefore I used 2 cups of chicken broth in this case for the 1 1/3 cup of rice I used for a yield of 4. I still used the full cream soup cans as directed and added the chicken liquid to the mix. Then, I sprinkled the cooked chicken and pushed it in to cover it with the mix of rice and liquids. I placed the casserole in the oven covered with aluminum foil for an hour. I removed the foil about 15 minutes before the end and kept adding a few more minutes (in sets of 5 minutes) to brown the top and dry a bit of the excess liquid. As I waited for the recipe to set after finishing, I prepared Cheddar Cheese biscuits from this site. The combination is perfect and in regards of the recipe itself the chicken came out tender and moist. The changes may seem like I changed the recipe entirely. It did not. I made up for the blandness that many pointed out. This is mainly caused by the water and la

I loved this. I have tried several different things others have suggested. My favorite is using chicken broth in place of water. 4 chicken thighs in place of breasts. I seasoned the chicken with McCormick Grill Mates Worcestershire Pub Burger seasoning. I eliminated the butter but I added parmesan cheese on top. I added frozen broccoli, corn and peas and canned mushrooms. Cooked 40 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. Very hearty meal.

I have made a similar recipe for years, BUT mine adds an envelope  of dry onion soup mix to the mixture.  It will make all the difference, no blandness.  Give it a try.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! Just good old fashioned comfort food! Made it for my roommate and he raved about it! I also add peas and chopped carrots, because I'm gangster like that. But it's a great dish to make and to be able to snack on leftovers through the week.

Good basic casserole but badly in need of more spices and perhaps some cheese. I prepared it as written except used basmati (well rinsed and soaked for an hour) as well as stock instead of water. I added 1/8 tsp of garlic and extra pepper and salt. It still came out bland, yet edible.

Recipe leaves out important details... And....Although the texture is pleasant enough....it just lacked a certain something... Flavour?  Despite using chicken broth instead of water, adding finely chopped onion, chopped celery, a few mushrooms  and seasonings, and topping it with chives as the photo indicated (but the recipe did not call for!)  this was  still  bland.  It might need some kind of hot sauce sprinkled on - or white wine  or something but I realize that  sometimes leftovers are better once the flavours have melded so I'm holding out for tonight's dinner.   I think it would be helpful for first-timers to mention important specifics... Such as casserole dish size needed, (this recipe really expanded, bubbled over some, and the oven filled with smoke as a result adding a smoky taste)    Also nothing specifying "cover or uncover. Casserole dish"...use  "uncooked rice" ... Or "uncooked chicken" which I figured out  but it's still good to be specific.   I thought the three entirely different flavours of soups was different but used as called for.  Resulted in a baby food sort of taste.  So while the texture is lovely- the flavouring might need to be reconfigured.

Loved this! Things I did different: I used 2 1/2 cups cooked jasmine rice, used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom (because that's all I had), omitted the butter, doubled the chicken, added dried chives and paprika for color, used chicken broth instead of water, added vegeta to the mixture for more flavor, replaced 10.5 ounces of the broth for a can of milk and sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top. I wasn't sure how the chicken would be but it was so moist and tender and there was plenty of sauce that we didn't miss the butter at all.

Cut back to two chicken breasts as I had about 32 oz. of homemade chicken soup. Used chicken broth instead of the water. Sprinkled the top with Italian bread crumbs and grated asaigo. This will be what I take to my next Pot-Luck!

Followed the recipe since it was first time making, I did swap chicken stock for the water. Next time I am going put in packet of Lipton onion soup mix and swap the instant rice for regular long grain (don't like texture of instant rice) and double the chicken stock since regular rice ratio is 2 cups  liquid to 1 cup rice.

This is one of my new "go to" meals that I have added to the dinner rotation!  I have made a few changes- I use minute brown rice instead of white, I use chicken broth instead of water, I add frozen veggies- peas, carrots, corn, & green beans, I eliminate the butter.  I cover with foil and bake for 30 min then uncover and top with either shredded cheese or crispy fried onions and bake uncovered for another 15 minutes.  It just as good the next day warmed up as a leftover!  Yum!

This is an excellent base recipe. Very easy, does not take a lot of special ingredients- we had everything in our freezer or pantry and it is pretty quick. I added a bag of partially steamed (in the microwave) frozen broccoli and some poultry seasoning and pepper. No additional salt was needed with the canned soup. For a little extra texture I finished the top off with crushed buttery crackers mixed with shredded cheese. Everyone loved it and we will definitely make it again.

Took the advice from my colleagues and added poultry seasoning, onion powder, salt, generous amounts of black pepper, and a few slices of butter to finish. For sweetness, I added frozen sweet peas to the mix prior to baking. I also saut√©ed half an onion (diced finely) with 4-5 large white mushrooms (diced in chunks) in olive-oil for 5-10 minutes. I poured that on top of the mix and stirred it in with the other ingredients.  

I'm baffled how some of the other users mentioned that the casserole came out bland. I used water and didn't substitute chicken broth so perhaps I went a little heavy on the seasoning (plus the other ingredients I added) which elevated the flavor. 

Please note, I decided to cover my casserole with aluminum foil for the first 3/4ths of cooking time. For the last 1/4th, I removed the foil, sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs over the top along with some fresh grated parmigiano reggiano cheese, and raised the temperature to 450 degrees (to expedite the browning). 

This was  daaaaammmmn good!

This was the first chicken and rice recipe that worked for me.  I made a few edits after reading some of the other reviews. I used one can of chicken broth and about 2 oz. of water instead of 2 cups of water. I also sauteed half an onion . I used chicken thighs instead of breast. And I seasoned my meat with onion powder and garlic powder as well as a little salt and pepper.  I cooked it covered for an hour and cooked it uncovered for 15 min.  It came out great. Next time, I will use some crakers to make a crust.

I made this recipe to feed about 50 people. So on half of what I made I followed the recipe exactly as is, which turned out good. On the other half of what I made I followed the recipe but added crushed ritz crackers mixed with melted butter on top  during the last 15 minutes of baking time. The crackers made this already good recipe GREAT, will be making this recipe again very soon!!

It was good, but could have used either another can of soup or broth. It was a little dry.

My kids ate it up! 5 stars just for that! I didn't have cream of celery so I substituted another can of cream of mushroom. I also shredded the chicken first because I hate leftover chicken breast (it's always too dry for me) plus I hate having to cut up my kids' food, haha. I also substituted the water for chicken broth and added a bag of frozen winter blend veggies and topped it with cheese instead of butter. It was so good!! Definitely making this again :)

This was a hit!!!   I was also skeptical but it turned out delicious - amazing flavor!!  My picky eaters loved it!!!  I used basmati rice, as it was what I had on hand.  I also added a few dashes of poultry seasoning.  I cut out 1 can of soup (cream of celery), 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of rice because I just didn't need as big of batch for me and the kiddos.  I also used real, unsalted butter and I think that was the magic ingredient that made this dish so savory!!!

I made it according to the original instructions with a few modifications. I used  can of chicken broth instead of water which came to 1 3/4 cup broth and added 1/4 cup milk to make up the rest of the liquid. I added 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1tbsp parsley flakes. Then I put about 1/3 cup plain breadcrumbs in a plastic bag, a dash of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder. I sprinkled the breadcrumbs over the top and only 1/4 cup butter pats on top of that. I covered it with foil and baked it for 40 minutes. Uncovered it and baked for another 25 minutes and then put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes. The whole family liked it. I think next time I will substitute the cream of chicken with another can of cream of mushroom. Other than that, I will definitely make it again!

This is a tasty meal. I left out the cream of celery since I don't like celery and substituted water for chicken broth added an extra can of cream of chicken and shredded cheese. Used 4 boneless chicken breast that I parboiled first and put seasoning on once I cut them in chunks and cooked jasmine rice before hand mixed it all up and baked for an hour came out great!!! Makes a big 13x9 inch pan enough for a few days for 2 people.

Very tasty and a good base that has lots of options. I used Cream of Broccoli instead of Cream of Celery and I added in some frozen broccoli spears to make it a little healthier.  I also used the healthy request version of the soup, less fat and sodium.  No need to add the butter on top (IMO).

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  BUT, I never have instant rice on hand.  As a substitute I use 1 1/3 cups long grain white rice with 2 2/3 cups chicken broth, instead of the instant rice and water in the recipe. I also occasionally add 1 cup frozen peas and carrots in the mix. My family also likes a crunchy topping - panko/butter, crushed ritz, crispy fried onions. Whatever you have on hand!  4-stars for ease and taste, 5-stars for versatility!!

So delicious. I added 2 cups shredded cheese, garlic powder to taste (probably a couple TBSPs) and a bag of frozen riced broccoli/cauliflower. I bring it to a church potluck once a month and everyone loves it!

Doubled recipe except I used about 1/4 of the butter from the ingredients list. I used low or no sodium organic soup mixes and just over 5 pounds of boneless,  skinless 1/2 inch cubed raw chicken breast, and homemade chicken broth instead of water,  added 24 oz frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, added garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasonong, black pepper, paprika, and about 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Added 1/2 bunch chopped fresh parsley.  Baked in an 18" x 13" x 3" heavy duty metal dark-coated baking dish.  Perfect size for this doubled recipe.

Baked for 55 minutes covered, and 20 minutes uncovered.  
 
Stirred casserole completely, remixing the entire casserole and HEAVILY scraping bottom and sides about 4 times during overall cooking time.

PERFECT!!!  Just plain nose tickling, tummy filling, mouth satisfying perfect comfort food!  The house smelled wonderful while this casserole was cooking!  Every minute of cooking time after the first 30 minutes brought EVERYONE to the kitchen..."What smells so good???  When is dinner???"

I make this with rotisserie chicken from the store. and use Rice a Roni chicken flavor instead of the white rice.  I've also added diced green chilis sometimes for a little pep.  My husband loves it.  Butter is optional.  Allow at least 60 to 75 minutes to cook. for the water to absorb.

Too much sodium for anyone. I omitted the mushroom soup. I chose brown rice. I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth in addition to the water. I added broccoli and 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese on top. Good!

This is a good budget meal and something similar to what my mom used to make. I didn't add cream of mushroom soup and layered some onion in bottom of casserole. Finally, I sprinkled French Fried Onions over the top. It was very good.

Really good. Used 1 can cream of chicken with herbs, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. Used 4 breasts. Next time I would mix the soups and water/stock before adding to pan. I think a can of cheddar soup may work in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken. Crumbled French friend onions on top - yum. Used 2/3 stick of butter and sprinkled top with parm. Rich but everyone loved it.

Followed the instructions exactly and loved it! Wish I read the reviews before I made it though. If so I would have subbed 1 cup water 1 cup milk.. or chicken stock. Probably would have thrown some peas and cheese in there too cus why not. Love how quick and easy it is and love how versatile this recipe can be.

I found this dish to be very bland, and had to later add vegetables and more flavour.
Also, the rice that floated to the top before cooking didn't absorb water, and we were crunching on raw rice.  I had to scrape off the top layer afterwards.

Made this tonight for dinner. I have 3 boys (13, 8, & 5)who can be very picky eaters. They all enjoyed it very much. I added some leftover Beef Rice A Roni & some leftover pork & beans (I hate to waste food) and they devoured it. Will definitely be making this alot.

Fast and easy to put together, this recipe is great comfort food. It is a little bland, but that's not a bad thing. I used long-grain white rice instead of instant rice, but otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. It made a ton; so, I'm planning on freezing some for another day.

My husband had seconds! Delicious and easy recipe. Fun to put together and made mostly from pantry items. I used chicken broth instead of water and added a half cup of shredded cheddar on top, but as is, it‚Äôs a a great recipe!

I made this exactly to the recipe the first time. It was ok. Second time- added onion and celery, a jar of cheese whiz, broccoli, chicken broth, softened butter, chicken, Minute rice- mixed it all together in a bowl and then baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for an hour. Not very healthy but delicious. It's a family staple at all holiday meals.

I‚Äôm a broke college student living with my fianc√©e, so I‚Äôve been struggling to learn how to cook things that he likes. I decided to do this recipe a little differently. I used 2 cans of mushroom, one can of french onion soup, no celery and no cream of chicken. I also substituted water for chicken broth, and added in two cans of mixed veggies (drained). He loved it. First time I‚Äôve ever seen him go back for seconds! The soup and broth is salty enough, so I don‚Äôt reccommend

Great base recipe!  I subbed chicken thighs meat & added cooked broccoli into the mix.  1/2 way through I added shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Right before serving I drizzled with lemon juice & parm cheese !

This is a favorite in my house! I have used 2 cans of chicken instead of chicken breast and used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. As long as it has 3 cans of soup you can mix it up. I don't add salt because the soups usually add enough for us. I also add a lot of black and red pepper because we like spicy! It is so easy to mix it all up and put in the oven! It is a dish that seems like you have put a lot of of effort into, but you didn't!

My entire family loves this and that's such high praise. They rarely all like the same dish. This is delicious. It's rich and creamy, tasty and wonderful. The chicken is tender and the rice is so good. We use a brown rice or yellow rice and some good chicken tenderloins. So delish! I add a bit of nosalt for some added potassium supplementation for the fam, and no one says a word! :)

This recipe was awesome and oh, so easy!! I changed it up to make enough to have for a few nights. I used 2 whole rotisserie chickens (except for the legs) instead of the chicken breats and  I used chicken broth instead of the water and doubled it to 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of rice. I was nervous about not having enough liquid but it turned out awesome!!! I baked it for 60 minutes since the chicken was already cooked and it really turned out perfectly! Next time I will saut√©e some onions and add more salt.

This was really good. I used 2 cream of chicken soups and 1 cream of celery, 2 c. of chicken broth instead of water, covered it with foil for 45 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes. I also mixed in 1 tsp. of Hyvee chicken grill seasoning so it wouldn't taste so plain. Some of the chicken pieces were a little dry so next time I may only bake it with the foil on for 35 minutes then 10 minutes without.

I made it almost to the recipe.  I made a couple changes. I halved the butter on top but added grated cheddar (which was delicious).  I actually only did cheese on half because my kids don't like cheddar.  It was much soupier under the cheddar than the other side.  Speaking of soup, I used the three soups recommended even though I don't care for mushrooms or celery but it was good.  I added some frozen broccoli florets and that was not a good idea.  Maybe peas next time.  My 12 year old who is uber picky loved this recipe.  My 8 year old who eats everything hated it.

This was so good! A few notes: regular rice works just as well as instant rice. Couldn't get my hands on cream of celery soup the day I made it, but two cans of cream of mushroom and a few stalks of chopped celery works great. Also, if anyone is worried about the fat content, this is still great without the butter (soups  do enough on their own to make it creamy and add flavor) -- we accidentally forgot the  butter when we made it...

One reviewer added Herbox chicken seasoning (or comparable) and I did as well - about 1T.  This dish was absolutely delicious.  It was super easy to make with most ingredients already in the house.  Putting the chicken in raw (no precooking) makes it a super simple and fast dish to put together.  I cooked mine the full 75 minutes and we had enough for several meals.  It makes excellent leftovers.  This is now a "go to" recipe when I just don't know what to fix.

I think this has a lot of potential and I'll probably use this base recipe again with changes. I followed the recipe almost exactly, though I did sub broth for water and added seasoning. I felt it still came out pretty bland. The rice took way longer to cook than listed. I had it in for about 2 hours and covered it the last half hour and turned up the heat a little to get things moving. I think covering this dish for awhile from the start would be useful. It could use more cheese and more spices. I think next time I may use cream of cheddar in place of one of the other soups. Oh, and I added some frozen broccoli because I needed to use it up. I think that was a good move that added some flavor.

Thank you for this recipe. The first time I made it I added peas only because that's what the family likes. There was no Minute Rice so I used the rice cooker and dropped in a chicken broth cube. The pre cooked rice did not come out mushy when baked in the casserole. I also used chicken broth in place of the water. I did not have any celery and only 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup but I didn't let that stop me from making this recipe I added  celery seed for flavor. The recipe is perfect as is. Very delicious and a favorite easy, fast casserole to make. Especially when I was just getting over the flu and didn't have much energy. There are never any leftovers! As a matter of fact, we had it for dinner again tonight. Boy howdy it smells so good when it's cooking.

Swapped cream of broccoli for the cream of mushroom; added some shredded italian cheeses to the mix.  Also added parmesan and bread crumbs to the top of the dish and baked last 15 mins uncovered and this created a thin crust that added a little texture..

This is a great comfort food meal.  I made a few changes 1. as suggested I used chicken broth instead of water (omitted using salt bc of salt in broth),  2. I used jasmine rice, rinsed (it's what I had) instead of instant rice,  3. I placed 4 frozen chicken breasts in the casserole pan and covered with the rice/soup/chicken broth mixture instead of cut up chicken.  I covered and baked for 40 min then uncovered, stirred & cook for 40 min longer and it was perfect.  Thank you for sharing :)

I made this recipe pretty much as written save for topping it with Panko, as some reviewers suggested. I had intended to use French's Fried Onions but have been wanting to try the panko, so I went with that. I had two choices at the grocery seasoned & plain. I should have gone with seasoned. This recipe was mighty bland as others have noted but every one liked it , so four stars.
Next time I make this, I will season it up quite a bit & probably use the fried onions as topping. I know this isn't a healthy dish but once in a while, I think it's ok to fall off the healthy wagon.

I like the idea of the base recipe. I however made a few changed, but tried to keep the spirit of the dish the same.  I cut the butter out completely, I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for 4 oz of sour cream and diced mushrooms. I put the chicken plus chick broth in a pot on low for two hours.  Once I diced the chicken i reduced the liquid to around 2 1/5 - 3 cups.  2 cups i used in place of the water the 1/2 - 1 plus 4 oz of sour cream in place of cream of chicken.  I know the flavors aren't the same, however I was trying to cut down the salt.  Other then that I used the rest of the ingredients.

While it was very easy it wasn't very flavorful. Next time I think I'll use chicken broth instead of the water and maybe add some type of herb or herbs. Definitely needs something  as it was pretty bland.

This is an old favorite of mine, my mother used to make it, my daughters great grandmother used to make it, it's just a great dinner that is so easy that you don't have to put a lot of effort to show your family you love them! I don't normally put the butter in to mine but sometimes I like to mix it up and put some shredded cheese! It's melts and it's oh so yummy! I mean, come on, it's cheese! :) Happy New Year everyone I hope you all have a blessed 2016

This was very good...I served it to friends and they loved it too. Everyone had seconds!   I followed the recipe but made 2 adjustments. I added a 12 oz bag of broccoli....I steamed it in the microwave for 4 minutes, trimmed the stems and added the tops to the casserole the last 30 minutes of cooking time.  Once the casserole was done, I topped it with finely shredded cheddar cheese and baked until melted.  One other note, I used thinly cut chicken breasts...next time I will use more than 3.

I used some left over turkey from Thanksgiving that I had frozen!  Instead of the 2 cups water.. I used 2 cups of chicken broth.. and because I did not have any cream of celery.. I just used two of the cream of mushroom and one of the cream of chicken. I added some sliced carrots and celery with a clove and 1/2 of minced garlic.. put maybe 6 little slices of butter on the top and topped it with a bit of grated cheddar cheese and topped that with some crushed potato chips!  It was delicious and so very easy!!!

FANTASTIC. Was looking for a homemade version to the store bought frozen box casserole which my family loves. Used all ingredients recipe called for and I added 1 can of mixed peas & carrots and Panko crumbs before the butter. It was better than the store bought. All fit perfectly in a 9 x 13 baking dish and about an hour later the crumbs were a golden crunchy brown... YUMMMM. will make again and again. So easy. Next time I'll try it with crunchy onions and chicken broth instead of water as another suggested

Great recipe, and so easy! I, like others, used broth instead of water, added seasonings and added a bag of frozen peas & carrots (thawed). I baked it covered in foil except for the last 20 minutes when I added shredded cheddar to the top. My husband, who isn't a chicken fan, loved this and asked me to hang onto the recipe so I can make it again.

In my house we season EVERYTHING we love garlic and onions, so I seasoned the chicken with  pepper, onion and garlic powder and added some to the soup mixture with some chopped onions and added just a little salt since the soups are high in sodium. Definitely use the whole stick of butter it gives it a nice crisp top.

Good stuff! The rice can get too crispy with the butter melting on top. Be careful the last few minutes that you don't over cook. Everything works as written in the recipe.

Followed a few suggested changes, broth instead of water, added frozen veggie mix that i boiled in chicken broth and salt enough to defrost, (think it would be terribly bland without the recommended salt even with briyh) cooked the chicken in sauteed onions and garlic salt(i just couldnt do uncooked chicken), doubled the recipe, replaced one of the cream of chicken soups with a campbells cheese soup because its what i had, used garlic roasted cream of mushroom soups.  Sprinkled with cheddar and baked at 400 for 45 minutes.   OMGoodness is it good! Family loves it. I love it.  Definitely a new regular!

This was a good basic recipe. I added french cut green beans and mild cheddar cheese to the top of it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it turned out great.

Made this for our wheat harvest crew! Tripled it to feed 18...I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, and left out the cream of celery soup just because I get questions about the "green stuff" from kids:) Used fresh herbs from the garden to flavor. Every bit of it went!  Baked it in my roaster on low for 3 hours.

I love this.  Will cut butter back some next time.  I had a rice emergency I had to work through (only 1 cup of instant, so precooked about half way another cup of regular) otherwise followed exactly.  Yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and found it to be a bit bland.  My boys (ages 10 and 12) and my husband liked it OK but not enough for seconds.  I really wanted to like this because it is so easy.  When I reheated some for lunch the next day, I added garlic powder and it was MUCH better.  So...I'll make it again but will definitely add garlic.  I think I'll also try adding broccoli as someone else suggested and maybe cheese.  It needs some color.

The soups and minute rice are perfect but I prefer to pressure cook my chicken with rosemary and shred it before adding to the casserole. Also add shredded cheese & cut the butter to 4 instead of 6.

Pretty good.  l  added chicken stock instead of water.   A little cayenne, poultry seasoning, some cheese and pepper. The instant rice made a little too soft.  If I make it again I will use regular rice to give it some texture.  All and all pretty good.

this was delicious! The only thing I did different was substitue 1/2 cup of beef stock & 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 12oz can  of evaporated milk so the milk kept it creamy and moist with lots of flavor from the stocks and I added poultry seasoning and paprika in the mix and then I sprinkle green onions and paprika on top. yummy!

Easy to make and already had the ingredients! I used homemade chicken broth instead of water. I only had medium grain rice and that worked fine. I mixed in cheese which melted nicely. I wouldn't suggest topping it with cheese though. My boyfriend almost ate the entire casserole since it got done a few hours ago. I call that a win.

This is a great recipe that is easy to add to. It is also great just as-is. I have made it several times, using chicken stock in place of the water. Sometimes I add in peas, onions, chopped bell peppers, or other veggies that I have on hand and everyone gobbles it up, every time! There are and endless number of variations that you can play with. This has become a staple in my collection of ‚Äúbase‚Äù recipes. Thanks for sharing!

I love how easy this is. I did 2 cans of can of mushroom, 1 of cream of chicken, did one cup beef stock and one of water. I added raw broccoli in small pieces and it turned out really well. Only thing I‚Äôd do different is cook for one hour tops, not 75 mins like I did.

I used long-grain rice (didn't have instant). Since the recipe didn't state to cover the dish, I ended up with uncooked rice. It's been in the oven for 80 mins. To rescue this, I added two cups of water, stirred the dish, COVERED the dish and am waiting to see if this solves my crunchy-rice issue. The flavor is good, as I added: 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp  chicken powder (didn't have stock on hand). I also thawed a 10 oz package of frozen mixed veggies, sauteed some mushrooms in butter and added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar. If I can solve this rice issue, I think it will be a hit! I'll update when I know more.

UPDATE: My rescue worked! The extra liquid and covering with foil for an additional 15 mins made the rice soft. Sadly, the chicken got a little dry. LESSON: I will cover dish for first 50 mins, then remove for about 20 mins.

I got this recipe from our church cookbook. I have always loved it. It‚Äôs great comfort food. Leftovers were always delicious too (if there was any left)!
Sometimes I will add additional spices or maybe even some broccoli.

I too, like most others used chicken broth, added broccoli and a little cheddar cheese.  I also used less than 1/2 the butter .  This will become a regular dinner in my house.  I did sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top and cooked uncovered for the last 20 minutes.  So good.

I have made this recipe for my family many times. It is easy to put together and they all love it. I cook my chicken pieces until the are white  before adding to the other ingredients. It doesn't take as long to cook.

I made this the first time and it was good...made some changes after that and its my teenage daughters FAVORITE comfort meal! Its my go to meal when I work late, that I can make the night before and someone can stick it in the oven the next evening. 
Instead of water, I used half chicken broth and half milk. I season the chicken quite a bit with whatever I feel like that day, not any salt though due to the amount of soup used. I also add some shredded cheese into mix and sprinkle some on top as well. Sometimes I will add peas and slivered almonds if I have them on hand. Everyone eats seconds and they love it the next day as well!

I made this almost exactly by the recipe except that I added 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning, and 1/4 tsp garlic powder and it was AMAZING! I can't say enough good things about it. My husband who's not a fan of casseroles even loved it! Asked me to make it again.

Easy to fix and the entire family loves it. I have made it several times. The first tome I made it the chicken tasted a little bland. So now I season the chicken pieces with Lawry‚Äôs seasoned salt in the bowl before I mix in the other ingredients. Taste great!

Just delicious.  Only change was yellow rice instead of white.  After several rounds, I've found this recipe can handle a number of minor additions to suit your veggie/flavor preferences w/o affecting the texture.  Did I mention it was delicious?

I made this recipe exactly except I added broccoli florets and sharp cheddar in the last 10 minutes.  It was awesome.  The chicken was soooo tender.  I will make it again and again.  So easy and cheap.

I have 4 very picky eaters and not one complaint about dinner this time! I took advice from the reviews and used 2 cans cream of chicken and 1 can celery (my kids hate mushroom anything) and replaced the water with chicken broth for more flavor. I also topped it with cheddar cheese during the last 5 minutes cooking. Could definitely throw some broccoli in if you wanted to make it a little healthier! Delicious!

This was delicious!  My family isn't a fan of cream of celery and we like things nice and runny so I used 2 family size cans of soup (1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken) instead of the 3 smaller cans.   I also added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese on top and used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water.  Just minor changes, and it was wonderful!  My whole family LOVES it.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is so good and so easy to throw together and....it makes a lot. I added onions and celery to mine and all 3 of the soups and some poultry seasoning, used long  grain rice and chicken stock instead of water.  This will be repeated here, it's a winner!

Good, hearty, feel good, comfort food!  Only 4 stars because it needs more than just salt and pepper to really be flavorful.   I might even add some diced green chilies next time! Definitely will be made again.

So Easy! I always read everyone's reviews and sometimes take their advice, other times I do my own thing. I wanted something easy. No precooking, no sauteeing ahead of time. Basically chop the chicken and go. Instead of water in all three cans, I added two cans of milk and just one can of water. Used 1 cup long grain rice because that's what we like. Mixed in a tbsp of Better than Broth chicken bouillon for some extra flavor and added the chopped chicken pieces (2 boneleas chicken breasts). Bake, covered with foil) for close to 2 hours. Absolutely delicious! What more can I say?

Followed the suggestions and substituted chicken broth for water added Seasoned Italian bread crumbs and shredded cheese on top after baking for an hour and then baked for another 15 minutes uncovered.  Also good with frozen broccoli mixed in and cooked together.  This has become a family favorite!!

This is always a winner at my house. From the smallest to the oldest eater, it‚Äôs a hit. I highly recommend to anyone. It is super easy to make and very inexpensive!  I hope you live it like I do!  Oh!  I switch out the cream of mushroom for an additional can of cream of chicken.

I and my family loved this!  I used chicken broth instead of water, and added lots of pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  It didn't need any salt added because of the soups and broth.  It was a big hit!  I'll be making this often.

Tasted great and was super easy to make. I didn't have any cream of mushroom on hand so i used cream of broccoli and it was still delicious. Only cooked it for 60min and it was fully done. I added seasonings before cooking to enhance the flavor since the other reviews mentioned it needed more.

Very easy meal to make when you do not have alot of prep time. Recipe needs to say uncooked chickenI. the first time I made it Inwas trying to debate if I cook chicken first or not. I use chicken broth instead of water and do not add salt to taste. Also cover with aluminum foil to ensure it cooks evenly. husband is very picky and he loved it the first time I made it. 
Very yummy!

This turned out really well, except the precooked long grain white rice was a bit mushy. The chicken was perfectly done and SO tender. Only added some green onion, onion powder and a bit of garlic powder. Husband said: "this one should go into the normal rotation!" .

Definitely will make again! I used uncooked jasmine and it worked out great. Did make a couple additions - broccoli, curry, Serrano pepper and cayenne pepper as we like it spicy!

This was easy and great for a weeknight! The only change I made was a quick sprinkle of cheese on top. (I threw in mushrooms and broccoli when I made this the second time. Both turned out fine.

This was highly rated, so I expected it to be really good. My gut said that the butter amount would be way too much but I followed the recipe. I was very disappointed to see the "fat"  on the surface of the casserole...way too greasy!  It also needed more seasoning. I will not be making this casserole again.

This was very good and I will definitely make it again.   I made this in 2 8 inch square pans because I wanted to be able to rate this made just as the recipe stated and I also wanted to make one small change (thus the two different pans).  It was excellent as is.  And the "changed" pan was excellent also.  The only thing I did was top the mixture with crushed ritz crackers before putting on the pats of butter.  Very good!   I would not hesitate to make this as the recipe states if I were out of ritz crackers, but if I have them, I will use them.

This is a great recipe!  Like others, I made a few modifications.  I use 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and one can of Cream of Chicken  soup.  Also, like others, I use chicken stock instead of water.  That makes it much more flavorful.

Nice little dish for a good meal with lots of left overs that microwave easy.  I went with 1 tsp of salt, pepper, and thyme, as well as a finely chopped onion.  Also you don't need special rice, just make your favorite rice as you normally would and use that.

I too was skeptical- 3 cans of soup? But was cleaning out my pantry & gave it a try. As written it‚Äôs FANTASTIC! Even better with the additions others suggested, particularly using regular rice vs instant (I used Jasmine) & broth vs water, & adding a bag of frozen broccoli & topping with shredded cheddar last 5 minutes. This works great with substitutions, used up some canned (drained) chicken vs raw & would do great with other proteins like ham, even tuna. Great recipe, a keeper! Oh, word of advice though - do NOT add salt in any form. I‚Äôm a salty person lol but the canned soups provide WAY more than enough.

I made substituted cream of celery for cream of mushroom because I am allergic to mushrooms. I make it all the time.

**Made this twice Already**

I made this the first time & it turned out perfect.  I was a bit leary as three (3) cans of soup seemed like much, then realized Rice would absorb while cooking.  This was the Most Delicious and Moist  Chicken Casserole I‚Äôve ever tasted.  My husband loved it.

I made second time and added half a container of French‚Äôs Dried Onions, that was really Wonderful too!!  Great Recipe for warming up from a cold day, but also brings back memories of going to ‚ÄúMy Grandma‚Äôs‚Äù and having a Good Old Fashioned Dinner. 

Thank you so much for sharing your Grandmother‚Äôs Recipe!!!

Needed more liquid.  Rice absorbed too much .
But, it had great flavor and we enjoyed it.

Do me a favor and nix the water- add chicken broth instead. Also add 2-3 cups of cooked broccoli and 3 cups of cheddar cheese.  Smoosh crackers up and top your dish with them before plunking it in your oven- just don‚Äôt forget the butter!  All of that makes this a 5 star dinner that the kids always ask for seconds on.  Happy cooking!!

DEEEELISH!!  I like to add saut√©ed onions and celery.  I also add panko with the butter before baking to make the top a bit crunchy.  This is a regular in our house because the whole family loves it.

I made it as original recipe except topped with cheddar cheese. I thought it was pretty bland and tasted like canned soup which is what it basically is. I layered rice on the bottom as some suggested but thought the rice was a bit dry that way. Was not wild about this recipe.

Delicious! The only changes I made were instead of 2 cups of water I used 1 cup water and 1 cup whole milk. I added the following seasonings: 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon red cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic. This recipe is a keeper.

Super good recipe. Based on some of the reviews I made a few changes - seasoned the chicken in a bowl before I added the other ingredients. I only had 1 can of cream of chicken and cream if mushroom so I used chicken broth instead of water and milk instead of a the third can of soup. I baked it covered for 45 mins then stirred and uncovered for another 20 min. I increased r recipe a bit too 4 chicken breasts (8servings) so that could have also impacted the cook time. Everybody loves it! Definitely comfort food!!! ????

As everyone does, I tweaked it a little for me. 
I like 4oz. can diced gr. chilis.  6oz. can of mushroom bits.  Chicken stock instead of water and a little garlic powder. That's me.  60min. was perfect in my oven. Smells great. Enjoy.

Very yummy!  I used basmati rice that I pre-cooked and Costco cooked chicken.  Since the rice was cooked, I  only added about 1/2 cup of water to the recipe, slivered red onion, canned mushrooms, some garlic powder, green onion and cheese to top.  Baked it uncovered for about 1/2 hour at 400 degrees.  It was a hit :)

I normally love anything with rice and cream of mushroom soup but this was Terrible! Bland and the chicken did not taste good being boiled in the watery soup mix. Won't make again and can't understand the rave reviews.

I loved it and it turned out great. I always season with garlic, salt and pepper, onion salt, and some type of herb such as basil or parsley, and cayenne because I love spicy.  I added onions and bell pepper, a can if Rotel, and Velveeta block cheese for additional flavor and to satisfy my cheese addiction. It was a hit. I covered with aluminium foil so that it would cook evenly.  I did let mine cook longer due to the additional ingredients. I also used brown rice and only used one can of cream of chicken and another one of can of cream of mushroom. This is a nee favorite! It reminds ne of making chicken tetrazini.

Excellent dish for the family.  I had to make a few adjustments, as I couldn‚Äôt find any cream of celery and chicken soup in the country I live in.  Caramelized diced onion, celery, and garlic, added cream into the mixture as a substitute for the soup.  Added peas and fresh broccoli too.  Substituted dark meat, instead of white.  Such a carnival of flavor.

I used basmati rice rather than instant and I boned some leftover jerk chicken to replace some of the plain old chicken breast in the recipe.  Still worked well.

There are many versions of this recipe...  I have made at least 4 different versions.  This version is the best.  My family agrees as this specific recipe is the only one that is consistently completely gone on Day 1. 

I get really annoyed when I forget how to search for this specific recipe.

It doesn't get much simpler than this, and for parents in a rush, this is hard to beat!  We'll used flavored "ready" rice, which tastes great, too.

LOVED this! I made this for a church group, "Messy Church" program that we have and the kids really liked it!  My family also likes this casserole.
I will again be making this for our Messy Church group.
Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe! Didn't change anything first time I made it and it was a hit. Added broccoli and substituted chicken broth for water for second time. Would probably just use water, didn't notice much difference to be honest.

I made a few changes based on other reviewer‚Äôs posts and my own tastes. I used brown minute rice instead of white. I used two cans of cream of chicken soup and one can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom and celery. I used broth instead of water, and I added a bag of frozen peas. I cooked the recipe as directed. After one hour it was done temperature wise but still seemed to have a lot of liquid so I cooked it another 15 minutes. My husband and I both thought it was okay, not bad, but we were not wowed by it either. It‚Äôs definitely not something I would crave and it probably won‚Äôt get made again. It may improve the dish to brown the chicken before baking. The chicken was done but seemed flavorless and a bit sticky.

Thank you Katie for this great recipe. Made it for the first time last night for dinner and it was delicious and super easy to make.  My friend and her daughter had stopped by for a few minutes and the dish smelled so good cooking in the oven they asked if they could stay for dinner. Of course I said "yes". Everyone had seconds. I'm actually thinking about going to the store and making it again tonight. I basically followed the recipe. The only thing different I did was use chicken broth instead of water, I added a little minced garlic only because we all love garlic, and after it came out of the oven, I sprinkled finely grated sharp cheddar cheese on top and just let the heat from the dish melt it. The cheese gives it that extra kick. All in all, a great dish that will probably become a favorite for this house.

I tried this tonight and it was so good, very satisfying filled me up, i didnt use cream of celery i used 2 COC and 1 COM, i added broccoli to it and next time I will try peas, but it was very good a bit on rhe salty side I used chicken broth instead of water, so next time I will just use water. I will definitely make this again esp in a cold night. It is definitely comfort food.

was it easy, yes. I made it just as the directions said. The rice came out hard and uncooked on top. An easy way to fix this is to cook it COVERED for the first 30 minutes and uncovered for the last bit. I know other reviews mentioned adding things like mushrooms, carrots, celery etc and I think had these been added it would have been better. As it was, I took it out of the oven, had a bite and crunch, crunch, had to stir it all up, add a layer of cheese, cover and bake an additional 15 minutes. It wasn't a total flop, but the recipe AS IS needed some additional instruction.

I grew up on this but without butter. After baking, my Mom would layer the top with potato  chips and broil them lightly brown.

I use French's Fried Onions in place of the chips.

This is a good, solid recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it worked exactly as the author said. Second time round, I swapped the creams of chicken, mushroom & celery for cream of broccoli & cheese x2 and 1 cream of bacon. I also substituted converted rice because I prefer it to minute rice. Both versions got solid approval from friends & family. I would definitely make this again.

Good recipe but with some changes. I did dice & pre-cooked the chicken with a bit of Adobo seasoning. Let cool before adding it to the mix.  I also replaced the water with chicken stock. Good and hearty meal.

Is the rice supposed to be cooked first or added to the recipe uncooked?  Mine came like straight up soup, even regardless of cooked or uncooked riced, not sure how all these liquids would not result in anything other than a soupy mess.

I made with chicken broth instead of water and added a bag of frozen broccoli to mixture and shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  It was okay. Edible but not a ton of flavor. U could add any veggies or cheese you have. I served with garlic bread.  Very easy to make.

Great recipe!! I did a few changes as another reader suggested. Would definitely make this again.
Used chicken thighs, 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of bacon soup. Also 2 cups chicken broth instead of water.
The rest of the recipe followed as is.
The whole family loved it.

I am not a fan of mushroom soup so I was going to sub cream of broccoli, it was out of stock at the grocery store so I used a can of creamed corn and it worked out wonderfully. Definitely a favourite and will make it again!

I am a beginner so this was very easy and tasty.  Next time I would like to through in some veggies...mushrooms, onion, carrots, celery...I think that would add some extra good taste and a little bulk to the mix.
But what do I know...just starting and having fun.

Rice turned out pretty creamy, I added shredded sharp cheddar to add a extra touch.

I used a little more butter than called for, and poultry seasoning in addition to salt/pepper. This dish is so comforting and yummy!! So perfect for a fall evening.

Very good recipe, my family doesn't prefer cream of mushroom so I used two cream of chicken.  All loved the casserole!  I think it would be good to add a cup of celery to this casserole, add a little crunch.

I put it in the oven for an hour.  Took the foil off and topped it with onion crisps for some crunch. Then after it was plated topped with some cheese. It was so easy and delicious.

could have used a bit more rice.  Was a bit soupy after one hour. Used cubed chicken, powdered onion, garlic, salt pepper to season.  Cooked covered.  Added cheese to part of it at end to see what kids liked.  They liked either way!  Easy and simple and made it with my 9 year old!

This was by far, one of the best and easiest meals I've made and I think, my favorite recipe from this site.  It is *so* tasty and does not taste like canned . It's comfort food to the max. What I did: I saut√©ed onions and green pepper in some olive oil on the stove (to bring down the strong onion flavor) and threw in a bit of fresh garlic during the last few mins. of saut√©ing that. I used chicken broth in place of water. I put 2 C. Jasmine rice and broth on bottom of baking pan. I added saut√©ed onion mixture to that. I put boneless/skinless chicken thighs (probably 8 fit in the pan) on the rice (didn't bother chopping them up, easy to cup up after cooking). I sprinkled chicken with adobo seasoning.  I put butter slabs on top of chicken (1/4 C., not 1/2)  I mixed cream of broccoli, celery and chicken soup together and added that on top of butter/chicken/rice. I added one can of french cut green beans (drained) and 3/4 bag frozen broccoli . I covered that with parmesan cheese and baked for 70 mins. Then added shredded mozzarella after baking and put back in oven for 4 minutes. Wallah! So, so good. This will be a regular in my house. I can't wait for leftovers.

I made this yesterday for our dinner. It was quick and easy. Instead of using the celery soup I used 2 cans of the chicken. I also added some cheddar cheese to the top as it was baking. It was very good.

A quick simple meal in a pan. I agree that a 9‚Äù x 13‚Äù pan is needed. I thaw a package of mixed vegetables and add to the mix, making it a complete meal in a dish. I also add some cheddar cheese for extra flavor. I use brown rice.

My husband said: ‚ÄúHow did you make this rice taste so good?‚Äù This recipe will be used over and over and over again. It would have been just as good with no changes. I suggest you do it with no changes. But doesn‚Äôt every woman who has cooked more than 20 years always do something different? I followed other people‚Äôs tips: replaced water with chicken stock, added cayenne pepper and chicken seasoning. Then I always add chopped fresh garlic to everything because GARLIC rocks.

I had a feeling anything starting with ‚ÄòMamaw‚Äô had to be good and I was right!!!! This turned out excellent! Even my husband went back for seconds which doesn‚Äôt happen often. I followed the recipe to the letter except instead of adding salt, I added about a tbsp of chicken bullion and of course topped it with cheese in the last few minutes of cooking. It‚Äôs amazing!!!! Thank you a million stars over for sharing this recipe!!!

I left out the butter and scattered shredded cheese on top. The cheese was the only thing giving it any interest. It was edible, but bland. So next time I added diced onion (didn't help) and slivered almonds (did help). Still too bland. I won't be making this again, but do recommend adding slivered almonds.

Absolutely love this Recipe. Imagine a creamy bed of tasty risotto with Chicken...Yaaas. I did make a few changes like adding Garlic powder, Parsley, Onion powder, as well as the salt and pepper to make it more seasoned. But very creamy and a great easy fast dinner that everyone will love. It may take a bit to find the best way you like the dish but once you get it to your taste it's an awesome dish!

I've been looking for an alternative to Stouffer's Chicken and Rice Bake because it's too pricey. This was perfect! I added a couple small bags of frozen veggies (like a chicken pot pie mix) and put a little cheese on top when it was done.

First off my husband will not eat anything with mushrooms.  I also didn‚Äôt have cream of celery.  I also only had boneless, skinless chicken thighs.   With that being said, I used 2 cans of cr of chicken and one can of cr of mushroom.  I used 2 cups chicken broth instead of water.  I put it all in my ninja blender and blended the heck out of it until it was smooth, no mushrooms visable. (what hubby doesn‚Äôt know won‚Äôt hurt him) Mixed the soup mixture, the instant rice and chicken together in a bowl and poured it into a 9x13 baking dish.  Dotted with the stick of butter.  Baked for 60 minutes then sprinkled finely grated cheese on and back in for 5 minutes.    My husband ate two big platefuls and loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this, it's easy and really good. I did substitute Lawry's season salt, I was out of regular. I added some cheddar cheese shreds and put some panko bread crumbs on top.

Not a favorite. Tasted too processed and bland for me. But I can see others enjoying it as comfort food.

I am celiac and can't eat soy either so I miss this type of comfort food. I decided to make cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. I added some extra mushrooms to give it some more earthy flavor, celery, and onion as well. The chicken broth, milk, and rice flour created a perfect imitation canned soup to add to this recipe. I covered the casserole with foil for the first half hour as one of the other reviews indicated, it worked well and browned nicely during the remainder of the cooking time. I also used some fresh thyme and fresh parsley with the dried herbs, salt and pepper. I'm heavy handed with the spices so I didn't find this recipe lacking in flavor in any way. While I appreciate all the reviews, many changed the flavor of this recipe so much it didn't look like  the same thing. Forgot to add the peas though as we were out, that will be added next time for sure. Parmesan sprinkled on top for those who liked it.

This was fantastic and a great comfort food kinda meal. I used half broth and half water to up the flavor, but otherwise made it exactly as directed. My family loved it for dinner and leftovers the next day!

I have been making this for about a year with some changes. I use cream of chicken, cream of celery and cream of onion soup. I use 1 cup water and 1 cup chardonnay. I also use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. It is absolutely delicious, flavorful and truly good enough for company. My husband loves it!

This is delicious. I used chicken soup with herbs and added some garlic pepper. After about 50 minutes, I took the foil off, topped with buttery crackers and melted butter and put it back in the oven for 15 more minutes. Yum!

It was okay when I made it the first time, but because it seems that they want you to bake it without  a  lid, the top got dried out and it tasted kind of plain and bland.  So the second time I added grated cheese throughout and on top. Cooked it with tin foil for the fist half of the time and then removed it to let the cheese get crispy for the second half. It is amazing with cheese. Maybe next time I will try adding a vegetable like broccoli.

I eliminated the cans of soup, using only one can of chicken broth.  Added various vegetables, skim milk and onion powder.  Baked one hour with foil on casserole dish, turned off oven and left uncovered for 30 minutes.  It turned out moist and delicious.

Great recipe very similar to what I remember my mother making frequently!  As other readers have, I just tweaked it a little for my family's taste.  Instead of the cream of chicken soup, I added half a can of cream of onion.  I used 1 cup white rice and 1 cup brown rice (for a great texture) and then 3 cups of broth to replace the 2 cups of water.  Also added:  2 tsp parsley, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 cup of cheese on top during the last 15 minutes.  It needed to cook for 1 hour and ten minutes, covered, before that.  For the chicken - I used 9-12 tenderloins, cut in bite-sized pieces.  Delicious!!

Perfect! My husband can‚Äôt deal with mushrooms, so I used cream of celery instead. My father-in-law says it ranks up there with his mother‚Äôs cooking, which is the ULTIMATE compliment.

AWESOME!!!  My step-daughter asked if I could make a chicken rice casserole and because I'm new to cooking I searched for the easiest recipe I could find.   This ended up being the easiest and BEST one!!!   She's crazy about it and told me she could eat it every day.   I add a cup of sharp cheddar, skip the extra butter, and use 1tsp Salt and 3/4 tsp Pepper.   Couldn't be a bigger hit!!   So thankful for this recipe!!

My whole family groaned for this dish to be ready! The house smelled so good and I was praying it wouldn‚Äôt disappoint. It did NOT! It was love at first bite! I was mostly concerned the rice would be super soggy but it was a good consistency. I cannot eat anything soggy (gag!), so I was very happy with the rice! 
I‚Äôm sure if made as written, it is just as good but I did take some tips from other reviewers and made it my own, and you can too....easily! 
I seasoned my chicken cubes with a little Mrs. Dash and garlic pepper, subbed the water with NO sodium chicken broth, threw in some frozen broccoli florets,  topped with a few pats of real butter, a light layer of Parmesan cheese, and finished off with panko crumbs. 
I baked for 70 minutes. I took the dish out and sprinkled a light layer of cheddar cheese on top and placed back in the warm oven until the cheese melted. 
It was perfect and I cannot wait to try other variations! Thank you for a new (and so easy!) recipe I can make again and again! 
Bonus: 99% of the ingredients are always in my kitchen! No special trip to the store needed.

Let me preface by saying chicken and rice is my MIL‚Äôs favorite dish. I decided to make some for her one night and found this simple-looking recipe. Total winner right here. Everyone ate it and came back for seconds. MIL told me it was even a bit better than her mom‚Äôs, but swore me to secrecy on that.

This was easy to make and tasted good but it needs more flavor. I will make it again but will take some of the suggestions others made and add more seasoning and maybe some cheese.  My husband loved it but me and my son thought it was missing something.

I made this ... only change I did not have instant rice so used regular .... same amounts of everything  else.  I was a little afraid of it being salty since using canned soups.  It was not too salty AT ALL actually needed salt but that was an easy fix!  I loved this dish.  Will fix it often ....  chop a salad while it bakes and you have dinner.

I mixed the soups and water thoroughly in the casserole dish (adding 1 t. of chicken bouillon). Mixed the rice in well, then shoved the chicken chunks down into the mix. Topped with butter, dusted with paprika. Baked at 400 for 1 hour. So, pretty much the same. Paired with Jellied cranberry sauce. We loved it.

Really good I would season your chicken very well I made mine with regular long grain rice and doubled my water it still cooked in the same range of time I wish I would have added cheese to it I like the cheesy flavor better I made this especially for my daughter she's one and loves to eat but not many teeth to chew so this was perfect

I also don't like the idea of three cans of condensed soup, I worry about the high levels of sodium.  So I used one can and added some chicken broth and other spices, some corn, onions, grated cheese.  Would have added mushrooms but my son wouldn't eat it then.  I used bite size chicken tenderloin pieces so I know they will come out nice and juicy.  There is no way you need all that soup, dress it up with sour cream or yogurt and other spices, like cumin, chicken grill spice, etc. for more flavor.  I like the ease of this recipe reminds me of my mothers tuna casserole that she used evaporated milk in it with one can of soup and noodles. Bread crumbs on top always at the end.

Today was my first time making this recipe. I did make a few changes. I added broccoli and celery. I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. It was a hit!

Excellent for a quick prep . My family enjoyed this. I thought I'd have enough leftover for the next night. Nope, it was nearly gone. Enough for a 1 person lunch, maybe. Thank You, for sharing.

I have been married for 44 years and my husband told me this was the best thing I ever made!!  We enjoyed it.  I did leave off the butter on top and put some shredded cheese on top instead.

Great base recipe! I think for my family we needed a bit more spice and we missed having veggies. Def going to use this again and just add to it! Love the creamy texture!

I have made this recipe twice. Tonight, the second time, I made it as written except added Old Bay seasoning for more flavor. The 1 hour bake time was perfect. The first time I made it, I used long grain rice and it took 90 minutes to get it done enough. I also added broccoli and cheese first time and was ok. Adding the seasoning tonight made all the difference. We all liked it and will make it again.

This was quick and easy to make and we loved it! I added a package of dry buttermilk ranch dressing mix and garlic powder for extra seasoning. Like others, I was skeptical about how good this would taste, and I was pleasantly surprised. This is definitely a keeper.

Very very good....Does not need a lot of adjustments  to make it tasty.
I used Paula Deen's seasoned salt and pepper flavor enhancer.
Didn't change anything else

I made this tonight.  Honestly?  It was not that great.  Bland and needed something else.  Would make a great start to a recipe, but needs some major help to make it to where we would eat it again.

This was great. Used 1 cup milk and 1 cup chicken broth instead of 2 cups water. My wife doesn't like mushrooms so I used cream of chicken/celery/broccoli. Sprinkled some cheddar and crushed some Ritz crackers on top before serving. A+

This is a great foundational chicken and rice recipe as written. My boys ate it up when I made it ‚Äúplain‚Äù and have hobbled it when I have tried variations like adding bacon and cheddar. This recipe is a keeper! It also worked great when I made the casserole, cooled it, and froze it. Reheated in oven a couple weeks later after letting it partial thaw in fridge. Tasted even better than when it first came out of the oven!

This casserole was super tasty!  I only swayed from the original recipe just a little. First, I used chicken broth instead of water. I used the different soups as directed. I did add a half teaspoon of poultry seasoning and a half teaspoon of pepper to the mix. I baked this for an hour and a half as it was still pretty soupie after an hour. I also wanted to make sure the chicken got done. I decided to add some sharp cheddar cheese the last 5 minutes of baking just cuz we like cheese!  This was really good the way I made it, but next time I might try adding some chopped onion and celery, mushrooms and peas and carrots to the mix, just for some variety. Yummy and comforting!

This was so easy to put together! The cooking takes a bit so I might not do it on a work night again, but that's my only complaint. I read some of the comments before making it, so I substituted chicken broth instead of water, added about a cup of shredded cheddar, used regular white rice instead of instant, and cut the butter/margarine entirely. I added some fried onions on the top for the last 10 minutes of baking which added a great crunchy texture. I cooked covered for about 45 minutes and uncovered another 20. It was a hit in my house! I'd probably cut the recipe in half in the future, it's just me and my bf in our house and this recipe was easily large enough to feed 4-6. Will make again!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make. I don't add the butter, which makes it a little healthier. I add green chillies and I put cheese on top to make for a little different flavor.

I have made this a couple of times EXACTLY the way it reads and it's really good, not to mention easy. This last time I made a few changes  and this version is also good. I used 2 chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch cubes, 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of cellery soup. I hate those partial cooked boxed rices so I always have my own cooked rice in the freezer to add to any dish. I used a can of portobello stems and pieces instead of the final can of mushroom soup and added chicken broth instead of water. Cooked at 400 until the chicken was cooked through and the rice had taken on the flavor of the sause. Since I made changes it doesn't really qualify as the same recipe even though I only made a few.

It was delicious.  I just used chicken broth instead of water, and sprinkled Panko over the pats of butter.  I made two casseroles for a family party of 15 because I like having leftovers.  Everyone loved it.  I covered it with foil (Loosely) for about an hour and a half, and then I let it brown for the rest of the time.  I served it with a big salad and rolls.  We had birthday cake for dessert because it was someone's birthday!

The only thing I changed was instead of water I had some chicken broth I had to use before it went bad. My whole family liked it even the picky eaters.  I am definately making this again.

To make this healthier I used all fat free soups, added 1/2 an onion, mushrooms and asparagus. It is edible but nothing special. The dish itself has no flavor.  Maybe some sriracha will kick up the leftovers.

Question for those that  made this successfully....Mine did not turn out as the rice was hard and still not cooked through. I added the 2 cups of broth versus water but am wondering if I should have mixed the soup per can directions (with water) versus just  dumping the soup straight into the ingredients?

I made this last night and already looking forward to having leftovers. 
I followed the recipe other than using a can of chicken broth plus a half cup of milk, throwing in some fresh broccoli and diced red  pepper and onion. Used seasoning salt, pepper, a dash of sage. And thyme.

This was good comfort food. Only used half of the butter and last fifteen minutes I sprinkled the top with a bit of shredded cheese. The top was nice and crunchy. 
Instead of using breasts, I had chicken tenders to use, but I would not hesitate to use any type of boneless chicken in this dish. 

Husband went back for a second helping. And mentioned more than once that it was very good. 

The fat content can be reduced more by using the low fat cream soups.

Delicious, but personally I prefer to sub cream of cheddar and some shredded pepper jack cheese in place of the cream of mushroom soup. Excellent when topped with breadcrumbs or crumbled potato chips and butter before baking.

Wonderfully easy and delicious as well as versatile. Can see a variety of additions and versions of this basic recipe(spinach or celery or carrots or  bacon or cheeses or etc.).

Fed three generations successfully.

Look forward to trying more versions.

So good! We have struggled to find a good chicken and rice recipe. The other  ones we have tried have either been too bland, or if they had good flavor, they took hours to make. This recipe was exactly what we wanted, so much flavor and so easy to make! This is our new go to recipe.

Here are the few changes I made:
I put some chopped onion and a little garlic in the oven with a little butter in the baking dish to saut√© in the oven while I cut up the chicken.

Once the chicken was cut up, I pulled out the onions and garlic and put the rest of the ingrefients in the pan.
I used brown rice instead of white rice.
Chicken broth instead of water.
I added some poultry seasoning and used very little butter. I did add some Parmesan. Skipped the salt.

It was so good my picky kids ate without complaining and my husband had 3 helpings! This will become a new staple in our house! It was so good, I set up an account just to provide this review!

Good, quick recipe. I added a package of onion soup mix, omitted the salt and reduced the butter to 1/3 cup. I would have used unsalted butter if I had some on hand. I melted the butter and just combined all the ingredients in a bowl . Spooned it into a 9x13 pan, covered it and baked 50 minutes. Came out moist and flavorful . Will make it again.

Very good! So easy and quick to prep. I did add some carrots, onion, celery and yellow squash. Sorry, had to modify! HAHA!
But it was great. 
I diced up all the main ingredients, salt and peppered them and let them sit while the oven warmed up. I usually add salt and pepper this way with recipes.

This is great and easy. Made just as written but substituted the chicken breast for boneless thighs and cut the butter in half on the second making. Good either way but my family prefers dark meat so was better for us with the thighs. Cutting out the butter entirely changes the end result not nearly as good!

Unfortunately I didn't read the part where it said "you could use less butter on top" so I thought it served a purpose and I used the whole stick. The butter on top kind of took away from the overall recipe for me, it made it really oily and I could feel my arteries clogging just looking at it.

 Of course not everything has to be healthy or good for you all the time, but the butter just made it over the top. 

Obviously this is just my opinion and other people have different tastes and preferences. The taste in general was very good and I'll definitely make it again with some alterations. :)

great recipe in a pinch! I happened to have all the ingredients I needed in my pantry, left over from other recipes, that were just sitting there. I could see this recipe being altered in many ways to suit your own tastes. I'm gonna try adding broccoli next time! I will definitely be making this again in the future

We added a bundle of green onions and a package envelope of ranch mix.
We boil chicken first. But this was a good reference for our recipe.

I, like most others, used this as a starting point and made a few changes. I used chicken broth instead of water, added chopped broccoli, and a sprinkling of poultry seasoning. I didn't have any cream of celery soup, so just left that out. We didn't miss it. It came out very tasty and I will make this again!

I LOVED this! I used the ingredients as written, with the exception of substituting one cup of milk for the water. Then I used Amanda Simwaka's layering technique and included the Parmesan on top, and it came out fabulous. Everything was cooked perfectly and the dish was very creamy. I had to force myself to stop eating it, to save some for lunch the next day. Excellent, will definitely make again!

I already had my chicken cooked in a pressure cooker so I used the water left over from that, and precooked a rice combo (white rice, orzo, and risotto.  I also added sauteed onions and mushroom, plus a can of french onion soup for amazing flavor.  Topped it with panko and cheese and baked it in a nonstick skillet so the bottom of the rice was sticky burnt!!  My next time I may add water chestnuts for even more texture.

I made this to take to a neighbor who is laid up and can't cook.  Instead of water, I used chicken broth.  I used two cans of cream soup instead of three, and added one can of water.   I used regular uncooked white rice instead of instant rice. I made the recipe in two 8x8 baking dishes, so my family kept one, and the neighbor got one.  My family liked it, but I have to say it is quite salty.  I am not a cook who uses cans and boxes to create my meals, so the canned soups and the broth in the carton added LOTS of salt  for my taste.  I gave this 4 stars because my family enjoyed it, even though I did not.

We have been suffering a stomach bug and tired of soup. This, as is was soothing and a nice change from soup for us. In this case I was looking for a "bland" recipe. Normally I would dress it up but this was one of those times that bland was good for our family. I did omit most of the butter, just used it to 'grease' the pan because of the sensitivities we were having. Sometimes you need something very basic and this is a great recipe to keep and "dress up" later when we all feel better!

This was yummy! I jazzed it up a little bit more by adding minced garlic and  a little seasoning salt. I also used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water.

It was easy and yummy! 
I substituted the water with 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of chicken broth and instead of cream of celery, I did cream of broccoli.

This is great left alone but I wanted to put my own touch on this great comfort food . Instead of 2 cups of water I used 1 water and 1 milk . I also added a hand full or 2 of shredded mild cheddar cheese . I also chopped up some carrots to add some color and  because I love carrots . It was a hit with my Wife and parents , so good !!! Thanks

This is a good basic recipe. I added fresh chopped spinach, some rosemary, and a little cheese. I also didn't chop the chicken, just pressed it well into the mixture and it cooked very well. Next time I will add some garlic and onions to amp up the flavor.

I made this ALMOST as-is because I took advice from several reviewers saying to use chicken broth instead of water. I personally dislike changing a recipe drastically and then rating it because, essentially, you're not rating the posted recipe; you're rating your own. So I try to stick to the recipe as it's written, but I WILL make sensible changes, like the chicken broth instead of water, simply because, obviously, the chicken broth will add more flavor. That aside, this recipe is fabulously delicious. Even my picky boys loved it. Thanks for a classic because I recall eating something similar at my grandma's house and this was the taste I remember.

This was so good and perfect comfort food. I did make a few changes after reading some reviews. I used the broth like others suggested, saut√©ed 1/2 cup diced celery & onions because I didn't have the cream of celery soup, only had 2 chicken breasts, added about 1/4 cup half and half to soup mixture, and I only had brown rice so I did have to cook it partially before adding to mixture. I did add about 2 cups thawed broccoli florets so we would have a green vegetable. I cooked this about an hour and the hubby and I ate almost half of it in one sitting !! Its delicious!

4 to 4.5  rating.  I used a can each of cream of celery , chicken and asparagus soups instead of the cream of mushroom, @5-6 chicken tenderloins (sm-med sz.) instead of chicken breasts, and added a 4 oz can of mushroom pieces & stems (diced), @ 1/2 cup diced green pepper, @ 3/4 cup diced red pepper and @ 1/2 cup of milk--could have probably used @ 1/3 to 1/2 cup of add'l. water; yet, it was very good and I'll make again.  I'm not an asparagus lover and I needed to use a can of said soup, so I had a one-dish meal w/ the added veggies w/ some fruit on the side.

This was good...Didn't have any problems with length of time in oven.  I used instant brown rice.   When I saved this I was thinking of another casserole that uses cheese and broccoli so I might try that but it was very good .  Everyone enjoyed it.

We loved it and will definitely make again. Only changes per other suggestions were chicken broth & milk instead of water, added poultry seasoning and thyme, and sauted chopped onions in some of the butter for more flavor.

I did use some poultry seasoning on the chicken. Added chicken bouillon to the water. I only used two soups instead of three. I used cream of chicken and broccoli & cheese. Cooked covered for 40 min then put shredded cheese and some breadcrumbs on top and cooked uncovered for 35 minutes. Thought it was way too much butter on top still. Until I let it sit for 15-20min waiting for my biscuits. The butter must have soaked in. But was not greasy at all. The top was a nice brown crispy crust. Turned out great and kiddo loved it. Probably could have used the extra can of soup. It was set pretty good and had good texture. But extra soup probably would make a little creamier.

When you have a craving for chicken and rice, this is perfect. Makes good leftovers too, if there are any! My single modification is to cut the butter amount in half, just to make it slightly less caloric.

Really good! I seasoned the chicken with garlic, onion and pepper because I always do and I did double cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom because I don't like cream of celery. Also I took others advice on substituting chicken broth instead of water because I'm not good at salting anything and I knew it would taste bland with water because of that. So I added no salt to this! Will make again

Good, simple dinner dish.  My family enjoyed it.  Next time, I think I'll add mushrooms, peas, or broccoli.  I used the lighter  versions of the soup, half the butter, and brown rice. It was delicious.

This is one of those very forgivable recipes, which allows the cook to add ingredients without doing any harm. I added cheese and spinach. Everyone loved it.

I first fried some bacon and set it aside. Then I browned the chicken in the bacon grease with some onion and garlic. I made per the directions and in the last few minutes, I crumbled the bacon on top and added cheese. I'll make it again, the bacon made it pop. Haha

I thought this was very flavorful. As in other reviews, I was also skeptical about using all 3 soups. It turned out perfect! The only changes I made were that I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of the 2 cups of water, I used a little bit of Lawry's seasoned salt, fresh cracked pepper and I added carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Superb! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I made lots of changes and the end product was delicious.  I saut√©ed about 1 1/2 cups of colored peppers, onion and carrots in butter.  I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added some garlic powder.  I used the full amount of butter, but I don't think you need that much.  I would definitely make it again because my family raved about it.

Was eager to try this recipe with hopes that not cooking chicken prior to adding to casserole actually works, and it did!   Used all ingredients called for in recipe with addition to adding mushrooms.  In future I will try adding broccoli.  I did use a full stick of butter as recipe called for and half through baking I put shredded cheese on top. Wow!  The cheese and butter created a crispy crunch that tasted amazing.  I assembled the casserole earlier in day and placed in fridge. When I got home in evening I placed in oven and cooked 75 mins. I had concerns of making sure chicken was cooked. It was perfect!  I'm so glad I came across this recipe and what a wonderful gift to learn that the chicken doesn't have to be precooked. There was no left overs, everyone loved it!

I  made this last night and it's super easy. And sooo delicious!!  (The only problem is cubing the chicken; does anyone have any
tips to make this process any easier? The chicken is cubed when it's raw.)

Made this last night for my two grandchildren, daughter and her boyfriend. I always make recipes found on here the first time with NO CHANGES, as that's the fairest way to do a true review! It was very easy to put together, most time consuming part was cutting the chicken into cubes. At first I kept going back to the recipe to ensure I read it right and it really called for 3 chicken breasts, as it was a lot of chicken. Turned out to be the perfect amount, lets face it, everyone wants lots of chicken in their serving. Others commented how they felt it was too much soup and liquid, turned out to be the perfect amount. The only changes I'll make next time is using chicken broth in place of the water and adding diced carrots and peas next time. Everyone went back for seconds and there was hardly any leftovers! Kid friendly and super easy, give it a try!

Made this with a couple of minor tweaks.  First, I pan seared the chicken.  Then seasoned it with soul seasoning and black pepper.  No added salt; the canned soups and chicken broth all contain more than enough salt to season this dish.  Used a 9x13 inch casserole dish, which seemed the perfect size.  Baked covered for the first half of baking; and then for the second half, removed the foil and sprinkled a light layer of Colby Jack cheese over the top.  I used the entire stick of butter; no other way to do this dish.  My family LOVED it; this is definitely a make-again!  UPDATE:  If you haven't tried this, You Are Missing Out!  I made this dish again, this time I cut the instant rice in half and replaced it with cooked wild rice.  To do this, bear in mind that 2 cups of instant rice equals 4 cups of cooked rice...so substitute 2 cups of cooked wild rice for 1 cup of the instant rice.  Still seared the chicken beforehand, used a mix of chicken broth and water, and halfway into baking sprinkled shredded cheese over the whole thing.  Left uncovered for the remainder of the bake time.  Family loved it.  Another nice touch would be to sprinkle bread crumbs over the top and bake uncovered for the second half of baking.  Versatile, tasty, and even if you have picky kids, they will love it!  Don't expect leftovers with this dish!

I made this almost recipe verbatim last night 10/20.  Based on other reviews I did season the chicken, other than that........and because the chicken was raw I did do the full time.  One of the better casseroles I have made!

My mom has made this since I was little ,when I didn't feel well. It was my equivalent of chicken soup, which I was not a fan of. So glad to see your recipe came from your mom and grandma too.

Mom would cut up almost an entire head of celery (celery has a medicinal quality to make you feel better when ill) and add it to a Dutch oven with a carton of chicken broth, 2 to 3 chicken breasts, salt and pepper. She would let it slowly boil, about 45 mins to an hour until the chicken was cooked. Remove the chicken. Strain the liquid gold and discard the celery. She would then measure the liquid (usually around 4 cups of liquid) and would cook the rice (2 cups) with the chicken broth.  

Some helpful hints for cooking rice and grits (same process)
ALWAYS a 2 to 1 ratio. Liquid to rice or grits. 

When cooking rice (when not using broth)or grits you ALWAYS salt the water(I usually add a tablesloon or two of butter too)This is your only chance to season either. You will find you can't salt grits enough to season them after they've cooked.

Bring the liquid, salt and butter to a boil. Add your rice or grits stir. Reduce heat to low (1 or 2) put a lid on it and DO NOT REMOVE IT FOR 20 MINUTES!  Steam is what cooks rice and grits. Don't peak don't stir don't be tempted it WILL turn out!  Nothing beats Uncle Bens long grain white rice!

While your rice is cooking, dice the cooked chicken into bite sized pieces. After the rice is cooked add the diced chicken, a can of cream of chicken and m

I have not made this yet,  but I'm going to soon. I think I will add crushed ritz crackers over the pats of butter??. I do that with a broccoli cheddar casserole I make that does not have chicken in it. It adds a richness that is delicious!! I just thought I would make a suggestion! It's very similar to this recipe too!!

made this following the recipe and everyone loved it.  In fact it was the 3 cans of soup that got me excited to try it.  My husband isn't a rice fan, but even he had seconds.  i am going to try canned chicken next time and maybe 1/2 ing the recipe as this recipe makes a lot for 2 people.

this is a dish I grew up on also.. it was so delightful to see it on my emails!  I haven't had this since I was a kid!  Mom used to add any leftover veggies, milk for 1/2 the water, and cheese or bread crumbs on top,, yum. thanks so much for the recipe. I had forgotten about it til It came up. My family LOVES it and it will definitely be on our table!

Very good as written.  Second time I followed review suggestions and substituted chicken broth for the water, added a tablespoon of poultry seasoning and a bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  Result was a 5-star meal in one dish.  With modifications, there was enough to also fill a small casserole dish which I froze.  Freezes well.

We had this frequently as a kid. Always made this with regular rice (not instant), no butter, whole chicken pieces (thighs, legs, etc.). It doesn't need extra salt--plenty in the soups. For more flavor, my mom always used a can of onion soup or the dry packet of onion soup.  Check toward the end--it may need an extra cup of water.

I tried to make a healthier version of this recipe and it turned out amazing! I cooked brown rice first in chicken broth and used 2 rotisserie chickens to speed up the cook time.
I added chopped broccoli and carrots, diced onions, minced fresh garlic, canned mild green chiles,  and 1/2 jalape√±o.
I used low fat cream of chicken, mushroom, and celery soups. 
I sprinkled with panko crumbs and did not use any butter. 
Bake at 400 for about 35 minutes. 
Delicious! I didn't miss the fat at all and it had a lot of flavor. 
I can see using this recipe many times with different vegetables. I'm thinking of squash, zucchini, onions, and poblano peppers next time.
The only thing I would change is to add one more cup of rice.
Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I did not have instant rice so I used regular white rice. I wasn't sure how to adjust the recipe but used 1 1/2 cups raw rice and the 2 cups of water. I added pats of butter to the top but only used about 2 Tablespoons and that was enough. Everything else was the same. It was done in one hour. This is a very delicious dish! Hubby doesn't like casseroles but he really liked this. I am looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I loved how it went together so fast. I felt it had plenty of flavor.

This is my go to casserole when anyone is sick at church and we are bringing meals. I usually add some celery and at least 8 oz of cheese, everyone raves about it! I mix up the types of soups, sometimes cream of broccoli or onion make a nice flavour change. I am a pastor's wife so it really comes in handy, along with a salad of tomatoes and cucumbers and a loaf of bread (also on this site) Macaroni Grill style for the bread machine.

This is a traditional chicken and rice casserole. It came together very quickly which was great. I do not like mushrooms so I used cream of broccoli soup in place of the cream of mushroom and added a cup of frozen broccoli that I ran through the food processor. I will make this again but increase the baking time as I thought it was a little too wet.

This was a great recipe and easy to make. The flavor was great and had just the right moisture and consistency you want in a casserole. We will be having his again.

We really enjoyed this, but I have to say just following the recipe as is would result in too-bland of a dish for us.  The recipe leaves a lot of room for putting your own spin on it, so don't be afraid of ruining it by adding your own spices - just go light-handed at first until you find your own winning additions. So, I wanted a deeper savory flavor and added 2 tsp. onion powder, 1 T lemon juice, 1 tsp. paprika, and 1 tsp. soy sauce.  Perfect. This is a big recipe, so I divided it in half and used two 7x11 baking dishes instead (two 8x8 work great too).  I baked one and put the other in the freezer for another meal.  I've made this a few times now and one time didn't have enough cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted with sour cream.  I've also added 1/2 to 1 C cheddar cheese in the mixture too.  Both of those worked great too.

Delicious!  I haven't made many casseroles in the past because I was married to picky eaters.  Like others I tweaked the recipe; 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup w/Herbs, 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup w/garlic, 1 cup of Garlic infused Chicken stock instead of water.  I sauteed onion and garlic until translucent, added diced celery, diced baby carrots (had on hand) and diced mushrooms.  Sauteed about 5 minutes then added cubed chicken and cooked until all sides of chicken "white".  I put soups in a large mixing bowl with 1/2 can of peas, 1/2 can Fire Roasted Corn and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning then added the sauteed meat mixture.  I mixed everything well and put in a 9x13 sprayed baking dish .  Added Panko sprinkled on top, dotted with butter then spread some cheese over.  Baked 45 minutes covered with foil and 15 minutes uncovered.  Made a lot of food!  Will do again but for more than just the two of us!

I did make some changes I partially cooked the the chicken with 2 cloves of garlic that I chopped and also one half onion that I diced. I did what others did and added a can of chicken broth in lieu water. I did not add salt. I also did not use minute rice. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Once I mixed everything together I covered with pats of butter, panko and Parmesan cheese.  Because I partially cooked the chicken I baked mine for about 40 minutes. My husband and kids loved it!! I made the sweet dinner rolls recipe from this site and  we are all stuffed.

My teens love this! I added garlic and saut√©ed celery and onion. And added peas from our garden and mixed in some shredded cheese. Chicken broth instead of water adds flavor, but very tasty as is and as leftovers too. We make it all the time. Thanks for a great recipe!!

My mom used to make this all of the time... except she would use bone -in, skin-on chicken She would just  season the chicken...and place it on top of the rice mixture, skin side up and bake it.   Never thought about making it an actual casserole.  DUH!  And loved adding broccoli and cheddar.  Delicious!

So easy. Simple ingredients. Great flavor. We substitute chicken broth for the water and put cheese on top (the last 5-7 minutes or so just sprinkle cheese on top to get it to melt). Huge hit. Our toddler loves it!

This is a great base as a casserole, I'm sure it would be delicious being it's simple self, but it allows you to play around with the ingredients. I used regular long grain rice, used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of milk. I only had cream of chicken so that's all I used. I cut up mushroom, green pepper, and green onion (no need to cook first) and I also added 1 cup shredded cheddar. I seasoned with Cajun seasoning (you could use any seasoning), and topped with shredded parmesan. I cooked covered for 50 min. and uncovered for 20. it turned out delicious. the whole family loved it. thank you for sharing a great base to a recipe that I'm sure could stand alone on its own.

I've been making a very similar recipe for over 35 years. It's one of the few chicken dishes that my picky red-meat loving husband will eat. My version is faster to prep. I use milk instead of water for a creamier consistency. I add onion & garlic powder to the mixture because we add it to almost everything. Instead of cutting the chicken up, I use frozen whole chicken breasts (much faster prep time). I just lay them over the top of the rice mixture. When this has been in the oven about 15 minutes, I pull it out & season the chicken breasts. I use a 9x13 pan. I have never added butter before but I tried it and it definitely gave the rice a richer taste.

I made this following the directions, and now wish I had used some of the other reviewers' changes. I should have used chicken broth instead of water (it was rather bland). I also should have done one or more of the following: 1) put cheese on top, 2) layered the rice on bottom and the chicken soup mixture on top of it, and/or 3) covered it. I mixed the rice in with the other ingredients and it came out with crunchy rice on top:( ugh. Another tip: definitely use an 11x18 casserole dish. I will make this again but will definitely make some changes.

While going through other reviews, some said this recipe was bland.  I made the recipe as stated but I did add garlic, onions, mushrooms, and peas.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  My changes  didn't help much.  This was still bland.  I probably won't be making this again.

Hi there. My family LOVES this recipe just as it is. :-) However, we are camping and I would like to use my Crock-Pot to cook it for several hours. What adjustments would you suggest to do so?

We don't do canned Cream-of-anything due to my son's food allergies. BUT, I'm not above a good ol' processed comfort food meal. I made a roux: 8 tbsp butter + 8 tbsp flour + 4 cups chicken broth. I seasoned the roux with 1 tsp Herbs de Provence, 1 tbsp. dehydrated chopped onion, and the secret somethin' special...1/4 cup Heluva Good French Onion chip dip. The dip was added after the roux was taken off the heat. Used rotisserie chicken. Added 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar to the mixture, and a little shaved parmesan at the end. All of my picky eaters gave it a thumb ops-up. The portion size is very generous, my family of five ate only half (some of us had multiple helpings).

My family of 5 loved this &! It is now in the rotation. I added 1 cup of peas to the casserole for color & to get more Veges in the diet. I used brown rice as that is what I had on hand. We loved it & I had a scant serving left over.

I was kept oval at first since there were so many cans of cream soup but the recipe was right.  Only thing I did differently was used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery.  Personal preference since I usually prefer those over cream of chicken.  Definitely a keeper and will make many more times.

I thought it was OK.  I used a whole rotisserie chicken so that I had white/dark meat.  I added some vegetables (sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli from a bag).  It had very little flavor.  Very bland.  My husband is the "cook" of the family and he took the left-overs -- added some curry powder, cheddar and parmesan.  With those additions, it was VERY good.

Great tasting casserole and so easy to make! My husband loved it. The only changes I made were to add a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, omit the salt, add zucchini and sliced green onion. Definitely a keeper!

I loved the recipe. I did add toasted almond slices and about 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese. I also added about a half a cup of green onions and used chicken broth instead of water. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I made it exactly as written except I used only 1/4 cup butter on the top. That was plenty. The family, especially my husband, loved it.

I love this my mom used to make it.  I substitute the water for chicken broth sometimes. I also use 2 cans of each and put in more rice.. this is so good. I messed up and did not get the correct rice but I cooked it longer.. actually too long hahah the rice was mushy BUT everyone ate it and loved it and knows that normally I do not mess it up hahahaha I always eat the left overs.  it is soooo good.   I love cream of chicken, cream of celery, cream of mushroom all mixed together with some rice and chicken!

This is a great recipe.  Like others, though, I did make a few substitutions/additions:  chicken broth instead of water, added a bullion cube, onions and some poultry seasoning.  Cut back on the butter.  My husband loves it, especially if he's not feeling well.  Great comfort food!

This is a simple easy dish to make. It would have been perfect but the recipe calls for too much butter. Normally I love me some butter, the more the better right. But it made it shinny and a little oily.  Cut the amount of butter in half, sprinkle some Montreal Chicken Seasoning on the top and you will be very happy you made this for dinner .

Our family loved this recipe! I added about a 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon poultry seasoning to the chicken for additional flavor. I also didn't have any instant rice but used regular long grain white rice and had no problems with it. I was concerned if the casserole dish needed to be covered while cooking because the recipe wasn't clear on that but I got my answer after watching the video. After reading some of the other comments, I noticed many mentioned adding cheese on top, but I found the butter made an amazingly tasty crust. This one is definitely a keeper!

My husband and I really enjoyed the recipe! I did make modifications though. I cooked the chicken beforehand and just cooked the casserole for 30 minutes instead, which worked well. I also added in cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic and onion for more flavor.

I did make this but I sprinkled dry onion soup mix on top. It made it not so bland. If you use chicken with bone in bake it for 2 hrs.

I like the recipe didn't have chicken breast but had boneless chicken thighs instead for the soup I used the low sodium variety and a little garlic powder and some green peas to add a vegetable plus added a sprinkling of cheese and butter and baked sooo good and my family loved it.

Added sauteed onions, used chicken broth instead of water.  Also added a little Parmesan cheese and a pinch of red chili pepper flakes. Family enjoyed and yes, I will make it again.

This was super simple and easy to make. Plus, it tasted good. I followed the original recipe the first time round. Next time, I am going to add some veggies and possibly some cheese. Either way it is a win in my house because my super picky two year old loved it.

Mine looked okay. Added minced green onions and diced mushrooms for a little more veggies. Also as a safety I cooked chicken first then added it. If you do that, I think you can forego the water. Also made fresh rice, not instant. Worth trying again.

This is a decent, ordinary chicken and rice casserole.  The next time I make it, I plan to add sauteed onions and garlic to jazz it up a little bit.  I really liked the fact you can put the chicken in raw, saving a step.

Used the tips from the reviews and substituted broth for the water, used long grain rice (not instant), added cayenne and garlic powder, sharp cheddar and poultry seasoning.  Quite a few tweaks, I know, but it turned out very good.

Delicious  as is! I do usually use the healthy version over the soups, and two cream of chicken (I don't like the celery flavor). But that's the only change I make. It almost tastes cheese without adding any cheese! I've made this many times and my family loves it!

Loved this, but made some changes to add more flavor(:
Chicken broth instead of water.
Cream of chicken with herbs.
Cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.
Half can of drained corn.
(All measurements and rest of ingredients are the same)

What a great chicken and rice casserole. We enjoyed it just the way it was, however, we may try going half chicken broth and half water next time. We also talked about possibly trying some crushed dried onions on top.

Quick to put together and delicious! I didn't use instant rice, as the recipe suggests and the rice was still done in the cook time. I also used the meet from a rotisserie chicken. My family enjoyed it, even the picky kids!

I read the other reviews and added broccoli and cheese. Excellent recipe. I cook lunch for three teenage boys and they all loved it. Will be making this often. I am sure you could many other things into it and it would still be wonderful. Just a good basic chicken hotdish recipe!

Very interesting dish. Incredibly easy to make. I've never made a casserole like this before so I didn't know what to expect. 3 cans of soup and 2 cups of water seemed extremely much for liquids but the rice needed it. It seemed like it needed to cook for 75 min in a 3 quart dish. The flavor was fine. But I'd probably season or marinate the chicken. The whole dish reminded me of a creamy risotto I've had before. This is a definite beginners/quick and easy recipe. No wow factor but fed my family.

Big hit at our house, even with my MIL!  Usually not a fan of dishes made with canned soups, but we were in dire need of easy comfort food due to several stressful events.  This fit the bill. Did make some changes:  used a rotisserie chicken, shredded; chicken broth instead of water; added mild cheddar, mixed in as well as on top.  Suffice to say, no leftovers.  Will make again.

I made this recipe as written with one change, I added broccoli florets to the recipe.  My family liked it but I thought it was mushy with the instant rice.  I think I will try it again but use regular long grain rice instead.

We all enjoyed this casserole .... it was gone the same night I made it!!  Since we're not fans of mushrooms, I substituted a can of Marie Calendar's white chicken chili -- it was a really tasty addition!!  I also substituted a cup of cheddar broccoli rice for one of the cups of white rice, which I will do when I make it again -- good comfort food on a cold day.

I made this as written and am not a fan.  It was so bland.  I'd definitely recommend adding some more spices and maybe some vegetables to give it some sort of flavor.  I won't be making this again.

This was quite good though my casserole seemed a little runny. I substituted chicken broth for water as well. I might cut the amount of it down to 1 1/2 cups to get the consistency the way we like it. Also added poultry seasoning, garlic powder , black pepper and some cheese. Definitely will try this again, and maybe experiment with the seasonings as well. Maybe add MORE CHEESE!

I also grew up with  a similar recipe where my grandmother just laid chicken pieces on top of the rice mixture and then sprinkled onion soup mix over the top.  I made mine like this recipe only I added  an envelope of onion soup into the rice mixture. It seems to add some more flavor!

It was very good.  Made it exactly as printed.  Wondering if it is safe to put together and refrigerate to bake later.  Sort of afraid to do that because of the raw chicken.   Also, has anyone ever ISD raw rice instead of instant?

Quick and easy. Perfect for the week night. I am thankful for the suggestions other made. I used chicken broth instead of water and used some seasonings I had in the pantry for the chicken (garlic salt, onion salt, etc).

First time making it and followed directions to the letter. Absolutely loved it. Easy to make and very tasty. Will be making it again, for sure, however may try a couple of the suggestions posted like adding some broccoli to the mix and layering cheddar cheese over the top before baking.

Comfort food to the max!

Normally, I see canned soup in a recipe, and move on. However, the reviews were too good to pass up.

Made it twice. First time followed recipe and love it.  2nd time, added Brown rice and mixed vegetables. Next time,I'll add the vegetables and stick to the white rice.

It was good: added peas and carrots, cut back a can of soup, butter and did not add salt. I used brown rice instead of white rice and my family could not tell the difference. I will make this again. It tastes better the second day, and with a half of a slice of cheese on top when it is reheated for each person. :-)

This was delicious! I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water. I also used two cans of mushroom with the celery soup b/c I had them on hand and it tasted great! Several people suggested topping it with cheddar, which I did, and it was awesome. I'll definitely make this again.

I too made a few adjustments, I used cream of chicken and herb(2), cream of mushroom, cream of celery. I added some water and an extra cup of rice. I also used lemon pepper seasoning and will add more this time in place of plain pepper. We all loved it  the flavorful creamy sauce was the best. This is now out go to chicken and rice recipe. Our only that I found we all love!!! 

It is an amazing base to add the flavors your family loves.

Not the healthiest of meals but what casserole is. I made as written with only one change. I did not use 1/2 cup of butter rather 5 tablespoons. Of course, it would have been more moist but it was tasty. I, also, added sauteed mushrooms and wished I would have added red bell peppers. So many options!

I added Cheese, Broccoli, some Panko AND French Onions on top, used chicken broth, and added a bit more seasoning (not salt).  My kids did eat it and said it was ok, but my husband referred to it as dog food.

Surprisingly tasty.

I substituted a 14 oz can low sodium chicken broth & 2 oz white wine for the water.

 I used cooked chicken breasts.

Cooked it all at 400, covered, for 30 minutes.

I'll add spices, mushrooms, celery next time, and add much less butter.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have: cream of celery so I just added another can of cream of chicken; substituted 2 cups long grain rice for instant rice. Other additions: a can of stewed tomatoes, 2 tsp. of garlic, and 3 tsp. of chicken bouillon powder.
Grease your pan WELL...it does stick to the bottom and sides.

I gave a lower rating for unclear instructions.  It doesn't say how many cups of chicken.  I didn't understand that the rice was uncooked before mixing it all together.  Therefore, it came out rather soupy, not casserole consistency at all.

Such a good recipe and like the reviews before me I too, was surprised it did not have a processed taste.  I used low-fat, low-sodium  soups.
No salt butter.

This is super simple and tasty. My family loved it. Yeah so it's not a healthy dinner. But an occasional meal like this is very comforting and easy on a weekday. Not giving it 5 stars because I do feel it was missing something. Will definitely be making this again, though!

I love it! Added cheese and brown rice. But it takes longer to cook. Next time I'll use instant rice...

This was a  great quick meal. My husband and kids loved it! Hubby wants it to be a part of the regular rotation of our family meals. The taste was perfect, but like other views... I pre-cooked my chicken (boneless thighs) and the broth from my chicken I substituted in place of the water. I also used my own seasonings, to my family taste (in place of salt) along with pepper...other than that no other substitutions.

We all enjoyed this very much. I read all the reviews and then used chicken broth instead of water, added sauteed onions and dill, Montreal chicken seasoning, sauteed garlic and seasoned salt and pepper. I had to put it in a 4 quart dish and bake it for an hour and a half, but it was worth it! Made it again and used veggie broth,  celery seed, fresh onions, chick peas, carrots and about 8 slices of Kraft American cheese which turned it into something even better.

I made this recipe as written and it was so very tasty and comforting!!! I thought there was something missing though and next time I will add broccoli, onions, and maybe some sweet red peppers too! The possibilities are endless to make this a signature dish of its own!

I'm the queen of messing up recipes. This one is the rare exception! I followed others advice and used chicken broth instead of water, used long grain rice instead of instant rice, added a small can of mixed veggies, and added a cup of cheese. It was great!!!

I believe in trying all recipes first as they are put on here before I try to judge, and I did, like a couple of reviews said this is bland. Needs alot of extra flavoring

This sounded awesome and I couldn't wait to make it.  FIRST!! A WORD OF CAUTION!! When you make this, at least partially cook the rice. I mixed all the ingredients as stated but when I checked on it, the rice in the mixture nearest the surface had browned and was uncooked. Luckily, I was able to do a quick stir and cycle the cooked rice from inside up to the top and the uncooked back into the middle. It was a little al dente but still very edible. I'm not sure if I was supposed to cover the dish or not. The directions didn't say.
That said, it turned out great! I added broccoli and red peppers and topped it with sharp cheddar and some more red pepper for color. It looked and tasted great. Make it your own! (Oh and after it cooled, I was able to slice it into nice neat squares for leftovers.

I love just about anything with cream of mushroom soup, but I don't use minute rice. I see that some people substituted regular rice, but don't you have to adjust the amounts of rice or liquid?

This was very good.  Only problem is that it really stuck to my casserole dish and made a bit of a mess - soaking dish now.   I made with chicken broth instead of water and put breadcrumbs on top.

Light and fluffy casserole, delicious and nutritious. Would eat again. Used real celery instead of soup and Jasmin rice instead of instant. Sprinkled some cheddar on top cooked for 70 minutes. Wonderful recipe.

It is quick and easy and we are eating it in our lunches.  That is about the best I can say about this recipe.  I don't know why I fell for the reviews,  I know better .  I don't care for canned soup recipes.  1/2 cup of butter did not make up for a canned soup flavor.   It tastes exactly how it reads.  If you don't like a condensed soup recipe then don't make this one.  If you are one of those people who love green bean casserole then this one is for you.

It was good. I thought needed a little more seasoning but hubby said he liked it.  Guess he did since he ate half of the casserole!  :-)  Think next time I may try cutting down on the rice some & maybe try chicken broth instead of just water.  It made a little more than just the 2 of us could eat.  Shared with daughter & her family.

If you're not in the mood for cooking this is a go  to recipe. Just mix everything into the casserole and put it into the oven. One hour later you're eating a solid meal that does the trick. It's not WOW, but it doesn't have to be. I was forced to change one thing, I used a can of tomato soup instead of celery soup because the latter is not readily available in Belgium.

Warning:  This stuff is seriously addictive!  I made as written with the following minor additions:  added 1 Tbsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp ground sage, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I put 1/2 bag of frozen peas and carrots in bottom of the dish, then topped with the chicken/soup/rice mixture.  Baked for 1 hour uncovered.  Then, added about 3/4 cup shredded cheese (used what I had on hand) and a small sprinkling of PANKO bread crumbs and baked 15 more minutes.  It is DELICIOUS!  I think Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix would also make a good topping.  This recipe is definitely a keeper--thank you for sharing!

This recipe really caught my eye so I decided to make it my own. I browned some ground turkey instead of the chicken to which I added a few dashes of poultry seasoning. I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. And for the water I too used chicken broth(1 & 1/2 cups) and 1/2 cup of water. For the rice I used minute multi-grain medley.  For a little green I added some frozen broccoli florets.  Since the ground turkey was already cooked I only baked this for 45 minutes.  On top for a little crisp I put panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese with the butter. Both my husband and daughter were fans!

This is a tasty dish but I made a few changes.

Campbell's Golden Mushroom instead of Cream of Mushroom.
1 cup water and 1 cup of sherry. Mixed all the liquids ahead of time.
 Added sliced mushrooms (Baby Portabellas) and chopped green cauliflower, about 1 cup or so. 
Par boiled brown rice instead of white rice. 
Boneless thighs instead of breasts, large dice.
Would have added some fresh green peas if I had any.

Came out great and a more complete meal. Never thought all that soup would make a great dish but it really works.

I used chicken stock rather than water.  I added mushroom pieces to the recipe an used only 1 large chicken breast.  I was very good an I will make this recipe again.  This recipe did not have a processed taste.

I omitted the salt and pepper and used Healthy Request soups to reduce the sodium and it was great! I love that you do not have to precook the chicken!

It was great! My family loved it! I have a husband and three grown boys.  They suggested another chicken breast and they also suggested throwing a bag of frozen veggies in with it.  Reminded me of chicken pot pie.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  I made garlic bread with it but next time I will be adding more chicken, a bag of frozen veggies and baking biscuits.  Great meal for a cold winter's night.  Yum!!!

This was so good. My entire family loved it. I didn't have any cream of celery soup on hand so I substituted an additional can of cream of mushroom. I added saut√©ed celery, onions, and mushrooms. I took other reviewers suggestion and replaced the water for chicken stock. It was flavorful and easy. This is something I will make many times.

After reading several reviews, I did add some shredded cheese to the mix and also on top of the 9x13 dish.  I used chicken broth and regular white rice.  Very pleased with the outcome.  My husband went back for seconds!  Will certainly make this again.

I'm not much of a cook so i usually follow recipes to the letter to be sure it's edible.  This time I had to go with what was in the cupboard.  Used regular long grain rice, not instant.  Used chicken broth instead of water and added a ¬Ω cup milk to be sure rice had enough liquid to cook and keep it creamy.  Also didn't have cream of celery soup so used a regular cream mushroom and a garlic cream mushroom with the cream chicken.  I loved it. Hubby thought it was tasty but a little dry so I'll add a little more liquid next time. Cant wait to eat the leftovers!

I made this dish with a few adjustments. First off, I mixed a packet of sodium free chicken broth in with the water. Second, I added to the mix some frozen sweet peas and some fresh sliced carrots. I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery...omitting the cream of mushroom. My family loves it! Especially my husband. He never leaves enough for leftovers though. Definitely a keeper. Plan on making this again and again...!

Very easy to make. But if you're like me and don't cut very fast,  allow more than 10 min for prep time. I also used chicken broth instead of water, and after 1 hr and 10 min in the oven,   my husband and I give it 3 stars.

I'm so excited I ventured out and made this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. However, instead of the water I used chicken broth, along with unsalted butter(the soups have enough sodium alone). It was flavorful, fulfilling, and so easy!

Good weeknight recipe!  I used cheddar cheese soup cause I did not have celery soup.  I also added poultry seasoning and used already cooked chicken.  I cooked in crockpot on high for three hours and oh yeah I used chicken broth instead of water.  A 15 oz. can of broth.  Tossed in a can of drained mushrooms for extra flavor (we love mushrooms)!

To make this healthy I used fat-free soup.  I also slow cooked chicken breast in fat-free chicken broth (something I do almost weekly to use in any recipe). I used brown rice and skipped the butter.  For a buttery taste I sprinkled Molly McButter over the rice before cooking.  Very filling and great during the winter months.

Like you my mother passed down a similar recipe.  The only difference is I use milk instead of water and butter the bottom and sides of the casserole dish.  Of course butter on top too!  My family loves this dish!  Terrific comfort food on a cold night.

This  dish is nearly identical to a favorite that our family refers to as Gramma's Chicken and Rice!  

I melt the butter and all the soups with water,  Remove one cupful of this mixture and add in the rice.  Pour into a 9x13 and lay 4-6 small chicken breast on top.  Cover those with the reserved soup mixture and bake for  2 hrs at 325.  Yum O!

I made this with only one can of soup. Three cans  are not necessary. May have to add more water/stock. Easy, fast and yummy.
Update 3/25/16: I made soup out of the leftovers by adding more chicken stock, diced celery, carrot, onion and cheddar cheese.

My Mom made this when we were kids.  Being on the farm we were all busy, with cows, chickens, pigs, garden, house chores, etc.  It was so wonderful to have this as our supper, to me it was comfort food and I slept so well.  I make this casserole even today and love it.  It is so easy to throw it together and bake it.  I put the chicken in the crock pot with water, when finished you have a wonderful true chicken broth. The only difference I put 3 c. instant rice, make sure you use the crock pot juice.  It is so good and flavorful!  I have a separator cup, so fat is on top in the cup as it drains juice from the bottom keeps it lean.   I only use  Cream of Mushroom, and Cream of Chicken.  You gotta try it!

I didn't make this but have made it MANY times over the years.  It always tasted great and was loved by all ages!  The canned soups never have tasted bad they just aren't great for you because of the added sodium etc.  This recipe calls for instant rice and my recipe from the early 70's called for regular rice.  I never cut up the chicken.  Have used boneless breasts, bone in pieces and even pork chops!   You have to cook it for 2-2.5 hours at 350 so it isn't a fast meal but it's effortless.  Other additions to the chicken can be broccoli and stir in mayonnaise  with the soups.  Enjoy when you eat just don't think about the soups.  Just don't eat it every day!  One reviewer added cheese.  That was part of the mayo,broccoli, soup concoction in the 80's.  Crock pots in the 70's were a pain to wash so many 60+ people baked things as casseroles.  I love reading reviews but this is first I have ever written.  Thanks to all of you who review.  Changes or adjustments to a recipe are fun.  Some people are more comfortable changing and some want to follow a recipe to the letter.  Both are great and no one should be criticized for changing a recipe.

I have made this recipe many times tweeking it just a little. This can be prepared on top of the stove in half the time in a skillet with a lid using less soup and water. I also add about one teaspoon of dry onion soup mix. It is sooo good.

I was out of cream of celery soup so used golden mushroom soup as substitute.  Used instant brown rice instead of white, chicken broth instead of water.  Per other review added Tb. Minced garlic and one cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Also added "Better than chicken" (large Tb.?).

This was  surprisingly yummy. I didn't have celery soup, so I used cream of  chicken.  I also substituted water with chicken broth and added onion, peas, celery seed, and crushed red pepper. I topped it with cheese 1/2 way through cooking. We loved it!

This was a great casserole, but I used chicken that was already cooked, instead of raw. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the rice on top was overcooked or burned. Fortunately, I was able to peel that easily off the top of the casserole. The directions don't say to cover the dish, but I'm trying it again tonight, and I think I will cover it this time.

Great, simple recipe!  The only part that is any amount of work is chopping the chicken.  I only used 2 chicken breasts, because that is what comes in the pre-packaged packs that I buy, and it was fine.  I tossed the chicken with some "Just a Pinch Rotisserie Seasoning", and  I also replaced 1 cup of water with 1 cup of beef broth.  Still needed a little salt once it was cooked, but I just sprinkled some over the whole 9x13 dish.  Definitely will make again, makes a lot of food and is a hearty dish for how simple it was to prepare.

We loved this dish. I added baby portobello mushrooms because my husband loves mushrooms. We will make this again!

My kids LOVED it! That's the most important thing! If they will eat it all and go for seconds... it's a hit!

I made this 2 weeks ago and it was a huge hit, I decided to always have the ingredients on hand. Last Sat night got a call to fix a meal for a member of our church who was just out of hospital, and I got this together in a matter of minutes, got rave reviews!

I did change a few things. I did 1 cup water and 1 cup chicken broth. Added a cup of chopped broccoli. Saut√©ed cut up chicken with onion with butter seasoned with pepper before adding to the mixture. Also dissolved a cube of chicken bouillon into the water and chicken broth before adding to the mixture. I used minute rice and it cooked in about 30 minutes. Topped with cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it.

Well, I did not have all of the soups, so I made some adjustments. All I had was one large can of the cream of mushroom, I used broth instead of water, I used a whole boiled chicken shredded, and I added half a bag of frozen broccoli and carrots and a half of a medium onion. I was so amazed! This is the first time I have made a casserole, and my family LOVED it!!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this!!!!  :)

If you're looking for health food this isn't it, but if you want something easy and comforting that nearly anybody wil eat try this. I followed the recipe except: added some garlic powder, added parsley for color variation, and I didn't stir it all together and then pour it in but put down half the rice evenly distributed, then all the chicken chunks, then the rest of the rice, then poured the mixed liquids over all.  With all the canned soup and butter it's very retro.

We cut the butter in half and it was still a lot. We also added cheese because I thought it might be a little bland otherwise. Easy to make and a good filling meal.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have made this exactly as written as well as with alterations (substituting the soups and adding spices), and it comes out perfectly every time!

I made this gluten free by using (2) 12-oz boxes of Pacific Foods Organic Cream of Chicken and (1) box of Pacific Foods Organic Cream of Mushroom soups. Since this was more liquid than the canned soups, I omitted one of the cups of water and for a creamier texture added in 8 oz of reduced fat sour cream.  It was easy and delicious and will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious! I made it exactly according to the original recipe except I substituted cream of broccoli for the cream of mushroom because I don't like mushrooms, I used only 2 chicken breasts and I added some seasoned breadcrumbs for the last 30 minutes of baking. I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Next time I will mix the soups in a bowl and then pour into the casserole dish as I found it difficult to combine it well in the dish. This would also be fantastic without the chicken, which I will probably do next time too just because I'm not big on meat.

This is an outstanding casserole! The only change that I made was that I added a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The cheese gives it a nice texture.

This is a great recipe. I usually use 2 cans of cream of chicken but forgot to go to the store. Hubby noticed and commented. It wasn't as chicken flavored as it usually is. I did replace water with chicken stock... but adding sour cream was a mistake. It overwhelmed the dish. This recipe is really good as written.. Unless you double the cream of chicken.
