This was pretty good, hubby and kids liked it.  I feel like it is missing something, I will have to play with it to figure out what it is.  But a good pasta nonetheless especially when you dont have any tomatoes.

One of the best things I ever ate -- so tasty, having pasta for breakfast is the best idea!

I made enough changes that this review might not count, but the directions for which ingredients to add when were  super helpful.
Changes:
Left out the bacon
Added mushrooms and tomato at the same time as the garlic and green onion
Add tablespoon of butter right before adding the pasta (just didn't seem like there was enough lube)
Added salt, pepper and cayenne to the whisked eggs

Next time:
Cilantro would be quite tasty

I read the comments so added a little cayenne and it was tasty. Also used turkey sausage and no bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

I made half a recipe of this dish, but I used spaghetti rather than the fresh linguini.  I think that made a difference in this recipe because with dried pasta it was dry.  The only other thing I did differently was to use dried parsley rather than fresh.  The flavors in this were really good, but I think that I will have to add some kind of liquid to make this good for my family.  I will try it again using the correct pasta because it is worth the flavors!  Thank you, richlor!
