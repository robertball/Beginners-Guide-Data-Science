These were awesome! I used yellow corn tortilla chips instead of white for more color and I had a handful of sliced black olives that I threw in the mix and they worked nicely. The smoke flavor didn't come through as strong as I would have liked so next time I'll use some wood chips for the chicken as well. Overall great recipe and one that is sure to please.

Very good! I used the recipe as written and added some chopped onions and tomatoes on top of the melted cheese after removing pan from grill.
I used water soaked Mesquite chips with my charcoal for the chicken grilling as well as with the whole pan heating.
You could smell the smoky flavor just standing near the pan, it definitely permeated everything in the pan! Good grades from all!
