I scaled this down since I'm the only one eating it. I couldn't get my fresh mozzarella to melt with the cream cheese very well. For me this was a bit too cream cheesy and needed something - a pinch of salt maybe? I also toasted my bread a bit, I like it crunchy and the broiling process always leaves the bottom too soft.
