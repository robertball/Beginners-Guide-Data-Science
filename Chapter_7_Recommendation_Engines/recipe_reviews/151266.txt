FANTASTIC....and I consider myself the buffalo queen.  I used Frank's Red Hot, about double the amount, a little more butter, and more cayenne.  For the KIDS, the basic coating mix minus cayenne made perfect chicken strips.  Tossing them in honey BBQ sauce (heated w/ butter like sauce in recipe) is also great.  Also, I don't have a deep fryer, so I country fried it in about 2" of vegetable oil in a deep pot on the stove.  I preheated the oil on medium for about 10 minutes.  They came out perfect.  Transfer them to a wire cooling rack on a cookie sheet to "dry" without losing their crispy coating.  Paper towels steals the crisp.

We just barely had enough flour mixture to cover 2 very large breasts cut up. I baked them instead of frying, but changed none of the flavor components. (I might have used a bit more butter, I melted more than 1Tbs.) I suggest to put a bit of the sauce mixture in a large bowl with 6-10 pieces and toss to mix, repeating as necessary.  The flavor was comparable to most wings restaurants that we've visited.   I'll be making this again.

Awesome recipe! (The review is for the breading only as we used our own wing sauce.) We love boneless wings and my husband and I are absolute wing nuts. These are soooo goood! The breading is fabulous. I didn't change a thing. Definitely double bread - dip the chicken in the egg was and flour mixture twice and  let it set for the 20 minutes so the flour mixture has time to really "stick" to the chicken. These are definitely restaurant quality!

Finger lickin' good! I ran out of the flour mix about half way through, and had to make more, next time I will double it. I didn't deep fry, just placed the chicken pieces on a baking sheet, sprayed with cooking spray and baked about 20 mins at 200 degrees C (400 F). Turned out delicious and crispy! Served with Ranch Dressing II from this site, along with carrot sticks and bell pepper for dipping. After we had eaten I realized I forgot the whole hot sauce/butter thing, can't wait to try it again with it :)

WOW!!  This the first time I have been so compelled to rate a recipes.  The ONLY thing I did differently ws using cicken tenders instead of the entire breast.   Amaxing, great recipe, perfect measurements on the spices.

These are really good, and almost exactly the same as the copy cat recipe I use from applebee's rest. I used more butter in my hot sauce. Sooooo yummy.

I just had to give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 to hold up my tough reviewer reputation but unless you're a total beginner in cooking the changes needed in this recipe are minor and easy. The ingredients are perfect but the amounts are way off. One would need two times as much flour and spices to double coat the 3 chicken breasts as the amounts in the recipe for me were barely enough for 1 and one half total chicken breasts, so I had to make the seasoned flour all over again. The pepper-sauce mixture needs to be doubled at the very least and ALSO, do NOT waste an entire cup of milk for this recipe, it's totally unnecessary. Just one large egg well beaten with about 1/4th of a cup of milk is MORE THAN enough to do its job with all of the chicken. Anyway, other than these easily adjusted flaws this recipe is PERFECT. I've tried sooo many fried chicken recipes that were so bland, but this recipe is one that has so many delicious and abundant spices in the breading that it's even delicious to eat WITHOUT the sauce! Only change I made in the spices were I ran out of paprika and cayenne pepper so I used 1 teaspoon of cajun seasoning to replace those ingredients. I also used 1/2 a teaspoon less salt as my cajun seasoning contains salt. ('Cajun Spice Mix' here on all recipes). Next time I will try exactly as is. DELICIOUS RECIPE! YOU MUST TRY!

Excellent!  I did this recipe with 3 lbs of drumettes for a football party. I doubled the flour mixture as recommended and I had enough for all the wings. I was worried they would be too spicy, but they were perfect. I did fry them in a large saucepan. Next time I do these I will use the skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2 inch strips as called for only because I prefer chicken strips over wings.

Ok, here's the thing: I made both a baked batch and a fried batch at the same time. Sadly, the fried batch was quantum leaps ahead. They were awesome. You may read a lot of anal reviews taking great exception to the NAME of this recipe and thus giving it only ONE STAR: Frankly, I couldn't care less what you call this reciope -- it rocks. All I really modified in this excellent recipe were the proportions of the ingredients. A previous review suggested using more than a cup of flour - absolutely do that! I used 2- 3 cups of flour to be sure.  I tripled the spice requirements (my son threw in some red pepper flakes when I wasnt looking I found out later), and I took another reviewer's advice and cut way down on the milk-to-egg ratio: I used 3/4 cup milk to 4 eggs.  I added Tapatio sauce to the egg-milk mixture before dipping.  The results of the fried batch were excellent! Perfect comfort food for the football game! And...my son claims it was the red pepper flakes that did the job (...right...).

Now folks, don't get your panties tied in a knot.  This recipe is a 5 star one as is.  I only changed it to suit my husband and me.  We prefer "naked hot wings" (no breading).  I didn't have veg oil so used the peanut oil I had on hand for frying the plain chicken breast strips.  For the sauce, I put the spices that went into the breading from the original recipe together with the hot sauce and butter before microwaving it.  The blue cheese dressing was divine as is.  My husband raved and raved and even asked for them the next night....which I repeated.  He's worth it!!  So if you prefer unbreaded, naked wings, this recipe works.  Thanks Bettycook!  PS: I'm originally from Buffalo, home of hot wings.

I can't believe this turned out PERFECT! I fixed it two times before I rated it. I wanted to make sure I didn't under or over rated. It's a five star & a KEEPER!! Everybody likes it in this household. The first time I made it I put the butter/Lousiana Wing Sauce on it. The kids liked it, but it was alittle to spicy for them. They liked it better when they can dip it in the sauce. I also added honey mustard, BBQ & ranch on the side the second time I fixed it. Very good recipe.

These were very good! I did need to use more flour than the recipe called for. Didn't have paprika on hand so I left that out. I used bottled wing sauce that I had in the fridge rather than the hot sauce and butter. Hubby says make again!

Outstanding. Make sure you double the breading and use the butter in the sauce. I made two varieties: one spun in Frank's Buffalo sauce and the other spun in Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce. Both were delicious. The BBQ variety tasted just like Buffalo Wild Wing's boneless barbecue wings. 

I also made quite a few, so I froze leftovers without sauce. To reheat, I warmed the frozen chicken in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.

Fantastic! Recommend you use boneless chicken tenderloins. I soak the meat in buttermilk overnight.  Let theses cool on a wire rack to maintain crispness; piling them on top of each other will cause sogginess.  I will make big batches and freeze.

This recipe is exactly like the boneless wings you'll find when you dine out!  I doubled the flour mixture and also sprayed them with cooking spray, and baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, tossed in a heated bbq sauce and they were amazing! I WILL make them, again and again!

I loved this! I did bake vs fry to to make a healthier version. I found the trick was to add some panko crumbs to the flour mixture and it gave it that crunch it needed.

This was a great starter for what I had in mind. What I did was decreased the flour to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup garlic seasoned bread crumbs. I excluded the paprika and then followed the rest of the recipe. I omitted the hot pepper sauce and butter and tossed the fried strips in a big bowl with Franks Buffalo Sauce! Served as an entree with rice pilaf and a garden salad. Very good.

I used skinless, boneless, thin-sliced chicken breasts, and it was just enough flour mixture for 3 of those breasts. I can't imagine how little it would be for 3 regular sized chicken breasts. The chicken was just okay to me. I expected a lot more spice. Instead it just seemed like regular fried chicken. I'm thinking maybe I should double the cayenne and paprika next time. Overall, it was a good basic fried chicken breast recipe to build from. I made my own sauce, as the one in this recipe was quite disgusting on its own. I used variations of ketchup, honey, hot sauce and bbq sauce, until it suited my own taste.

This recipe is both fantastic and easy to prepare. I prefer a really well seasoned fry mix, so I doubled up on the seasonings with the exception of the salt and cayenne pepper. The key is taking time to refrigerate the chicken so the coating really has a chance to stick and also make sure you fry in a cast iron pan, it will come out so much better. All in all, this was a huge hit with my family, I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These were very good. I baked them and they turned out fairly crispy but next time I'll try frying them. I baked them at 400 degrees for about 25 min!

The breading is AMAZING!  but I need to remember that the sauce is almost pure hot sauce so it definitely is HOT!  Hubby LOVED it!

After attempting to make these on my own with no recipe and failing miserably, I was happy to learn the trick is double coating them ... These were very tasty ..though I must admit I cheated a little ... right next to the Franks Red Hot in the store I noticed Franks Wing Sauce ... so I used that instead of blending the hot sauce and butter .

These were so good! I doubled the recipe and had about 12 small chicken tenderloins. I cut them into large chicken nugget size. I really liked the double dipping method as it made them extra crunchy. I may try that on other chicken. I plan to make them again next year. To save time I will make them up and have them in the refridgerator ready to be fried. I heated about 1/4 inch of oil in pan on 5 for about 10 minutes. The first batch took about 12 minutes and the second took about 20 minutes, but I didn't want them to burn. I got about 5 servings from doubling. Thanks, for the great recipe.

Wow!  These were a huge hit and will be making again soon! Followed all the breading and cooking instructions as written.  I didn't want them hot since serving to my kids also, so I mixed BBQ with the butter and they came out VERY yummy!!

The sauce isn't hot enough for a real Texan.  Use your own sauce and bake the strips.  They will come out crispy and finger lickin' good.  But only coat the strips once because your flour mix will get all wet and won't coat well.

I need to try this recipe again. I followed directions but put the chicken in fridge for about an hour in a bowl, not on a rack. When it was time to cook them I also used the deep fry basket instead of just dropping them in the grease. To make a long story short(I know, too late) they stuck like a mother.  I had to pry them out of the basket, torn to pieces. I had company and they got a good laugh. I will try them again but without using the basket. The flavor of what we did taste was good, but by that time I was beyond irritated. I will try again. When I calm down. Thanks for the recipe.

Better then any chicken fingers/wings i've had in a resturant, and the boyfriend agrees! I don't have a deep fryer so pre heated vegetable oil in a large pot on medium low. Fried the strips for about 3 mins on each side, then placed them on a rack to crisp up before tossing in the sauce. Wow.

Wow! You will  have to double flour mixture as other users suggested. These are great without sauce! Infact next time I think I will just dip in sauce because they are so good alone and because the sauce made the wings a little soggy. Thanks for sharing, yum yum yum!

Great recipe! I actually baked mine, and it turned out delicious. And I'm sure it would taste just as good fried. It came out like buffalo wings from a typical American restaurant.
Goes well with homemade french fries... yum!

Awesome- I did use extra flour as the others suggested and it is needed. If love boneless buffalo wings and don't try this recipe then you are really missing out. Other than the amount of flour I wouldn't change a thing.

I love restaurant/pub boneless buffalo wings so I was a bit hesitant to try this out. I have to say that these were delicious! The breading was soft and crispy which is the way I love it. They are so good that you don't even need the sauce, but the sauce works great too. Next time I'm gonna try out some different sauces too. I can't wait to have some of my friends try these out!

My husband & I loved this one. The chicken is great even without the sauce! I doubled the flour mixture, dredged 2 times, and let rest for 10 minutes before deep fat frying. When I make this for company I will make several types of dipping sauces. Thank you so much for sharing. :)

I did not know what to expect from this recipe because I had never made wings. Also, I was hesitant about the flavor most reviewers mentioned making their signature sauce. I only made one substitution; I didnt have cayenne pepper thus I used chili powder. The wings were amazing!!

Excellent recipe.  Based on the reviews, I doubled the flour mixture. I also added additional spice, a buffalo wing spice mix.  Put some in Frank's Red Hot Sauce, and some in Sweet Baby Ray's Sauce.  Family really enjoyed.

These were so easy and came out delicious...definitely making again and may try with various sauces.  As others suggested I did double dip them and they were better than restaurant boneless wings!!  I do bake these instead of frying them, go in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes.

I followed the instructions to the "T".. They didnt come out as good as I thought they would.. Good techniques to make breaded chicken, but this wasn't really for us.. The only one who seemed to eat it, was my 2 yr old.. The flour mix was very bland in my book.. I ran out of flour mix by the time I got to my 2nd chicken. (All I made was 2 chicken breast cut up) I had more milk n egg left over. The coating didnt stick at all either. Thanks anyways.

I baked them and they didn't come out well. The flavour wasn't bad but they didn't look like anything I'd want to eat. It might have needed more egg for the wash or maybe I didn't do the recipe justice by baking instead of frying

I baked mine instead of frying so I rated it a little higher since I didn't do it as directed. They were pretty good, very hot, and seem to be even hotter when you reheat them after refrigerating leftovers.

I love buffalo chicken and was nervous about making my own, but this is an awesome recipe! It was easy to make and just as everyone else, I too had to add more flour. Overall, this was very flavorful and tasted just like the local restaurants. Great recipe that I will use again and again!

It was very good. We made buffalo chicken wraps with this recipe. We doubled the flour mixture so not to run out, as another reviewer stated.

I am SO ANNOYED that I just heated up oil while mixing all the other ingredients and then read the chicken is supposed to sit in fridge for 20 minutes.

Pretty sure the oil doesn’t need to be hot for that long!!!!!!!!

This is a terrific recipe. I made these for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved them. Per reviews, I doubled the flour mixture, and it was just enough for 3 lbs of self-made chicken nuggets. Also, for a healthier version, I baked the chicken pieces instead of fried them. Note: when dredging through flour, definitely DREDGE. The first time I ever made these, I thought I would take a short-cut and toss the flour mix into a baggie, add the nuggets, and shake it all up to coat. I ended up with half-covered pieces and way too much flour on each piece. Follow directions here--dip in egg, dredge in flour, dip in egg again, dredge in flour, shake off excess flour. It is worth the effort! 

Also, I did not serve with the recommended sauce, but instead used "Scott's Buffalo Wing Sauce" recipe from this site. The sauce was awesome.

This recipe is AWESOME! To make this recipe gluten free - use 1 cup of white rice flour instead of regular flour. Still fries up nicely. Definitely do the double dipping with the batter.

Excellent recipe.  Without sauce it makes excellent "chicken nuggets" for kids.  Prep suggestions:  I find three chicken breasts requires 2.5 times the coating mixture.  I found the easiest prep was for the first coating to stir the chicken in the egg/milk mixture, strain then add to a large sealable container containing the coating.  Shake to evenly coat.  The second coating required hand dipping, which I again coated in a shaken sealed container.  I also use a wide variety of sauces like BQ sauce, Frank's Red Sauce and a hot pepper sauce.

HOT! HOT! HOT!  I have used this recipe twice and I know I will continue to use it... it's amazing!  I made one small revision to the breading, I used ground chipotle pepper instead of paprika because I just like the flavor more.  I also experimented with the sauce and found that halving the hot sauce and adding its equivalent in honey makes for an awesome twist.  The honey ones do need to set to get a nice crispy glaze but that's easily remedied by making that batch first and keeping them warm in the oven.  Thank you for this recipe, Betty!

These are AMAZING!  I followed the recipe fairly close, but I used less milk and no cayenne.  I also didn't dip all of them in the egg/milk and flour twice as it was very time consuming.  I couldn't tell the difference of which one was which.  They were so delicious!  I would highly recommend these to anyone who loves boneless wings!  For sure a keeper!

this is a family favorite, a little time consuming with the double breading and the refrigeration time, but worth it....everyone loves them and the finickiest eat them without the sauce...change the sauce/butter ratio to suit your own hotness...I usually add an extra tablespoon of butter or two.

I made these for the first time yesterday and they were really good!  To make life easier, I used approx. 1 lb. of trimmed and cut chicken tenders.  I then cut each tender into 3 pieced to give me chicken nuggets.  I had just enough flour and just enough sauce.  I think I am going to customize the recipe a little next time by marinating the chicken in some buffalo sauce and by adding a little more spice to the flour.  I also think I will try to cook them in the oven to save a few calories.  Pretty good without changing the recipe, but I think they could be even better by marinating first!

3/11..everyone loved this.  i used 6 large breasts and 1 1/2 times the amount of flour mixture.  double dip.  didn't have cayenne pepper, used chili powder.  the butter mix at the end was super spicy so i just put a little brush on each piece after it cooled on a rack.  definitely make again. serve with sweet potato fries and corn. next time make even more for leftovers.  8/18This time I served it over a salad with blue cheese dressing and it was great. also, I didn't get a chance to cook it right after I breaded it, and it had to wait a day and it turned out crispier on the outside which  I liked.

I made these back at Super Bowl time.  I let them sit overnight and baked 1/2 the next day.  They were ok but not great.  I fried the other half in about an inch of oil and they were better.  The batter was tasty not to hot.  I used our own hot sauce on the side.  My husband thought they were just like a spicy chicken nugget?  I did have to double the batter mix and these do take more then the 10 min prep time.  While I would use the batter recipe again for other things I don't think I will be making this whole recipe again.

these were awesome! the breading was so perfect, i've tried so many recipes and this one is by far the best. i'll be using this one forever! like everyone says definitely double the flour mix from the beginning. this was pretty time consuming but so worth it. i don't think the refrigerated step is necessary. i did do it for my first 8 pieces, then on the next ones i couldn't wait to see how they'd turn out so i just put one in the deep fryer right after coating it and it turned out just fine. in fact i liked it better than the ones i put in the fridge. i used franks hot sauce for half (i ran out) and louisiana wing sauce and franks on the other half and my DH thought those were much better. the sauces were very similar to applebees. we'll be experimenting with different sauces but no changes to the batter!!

This recipe is awesome. I am an experienced cook and I can always tell by the ingredient list whether or not the recipe will be bland to my taste and add or subtract as I see fit. I used 2 chicken breasts, doubled the flour mix but had to throw some out at the end, probably should have done 1 1/2 recipe instead of doubling. 

That said, I loved this recipe and this is the second time I made it. I fried the chicken last time but since my brother was staying over and requested fries, which I deep fried, I decided to bake the chicken this time so it would be in the oven at the same time that the fries were cooking. It was still very good and everyone was happy. Try it! Oh and I did half the chicken with bbq sauce with a bit of melted butter mixed in, everyone liked those as well (I used sriracha hot sauce for the buffalo chicken so it was nice to have something not as spicy)

I made these wings for dinner tonight, and they were very well liked. I did bake them instead of frying just because I very rarely fry anything, but I would like to try these fried sometime to see if they would end up being any crispier. I knew the sauce would make it too spicy for my 2 year old so I left a few pieces with just the breading and no sauce, which turned out very tasty too. Thank you for a good recipe, Bettycook!

WOW, I loved it and so did the hubby and Kids! I do agree that the dry ingredients need to be doubled. I about ran out. I have never pan fried so my first batch was a little over done. But it tasted better then the restaurant. Will definitely make again.

For all those 11 hundred and 71 who thought these sounded good enough to save this recipe, you should make them! They are very good! I thought 2 tsp salt and the amount of cayenne would be too much:not at all. The only issue was, like others,  I also needed to double the flour/spice mixture to do a double breading. Great recipe!, but will try to bake instead of fry, and see if they can still be nice and crispy, with less fat.

the wings came out great! I followed the recipe almost to exact, except I didn't have unbleached flour, but it was all-purpose flour, and I don't have a deep fryer, so I had to fry the chicken in a deep pot with vegetable oil. I added more hot sauce, and more butter for the sauce to coat the chicken.

A hit in our household!  Used other reviewers tips and doubled the dry mix which was just enough for 3 breasts (though I think I may have triple dipped some pieces :O), also added breadcrumbs (no Panko in the cupboard) and baked instead of frying.  Thank you for posting!  This is a keeper.

Excellent. I replaced the 2 tsp of salt with about half a teaspoon of sea salt (to reduce sodium), baked them, and used olive oil instead of butter, including a spray of olive oil before baking.

I would give these ten stars if I could, they are DELICIOUS!  I fried mine in a deep frying pan, not a deep fryer, and they turned out great!  I also didn't alter the recipe any and do agree with a couple other reviews.....use more flour!  I ran out of the mixture with about 4 strips left.  That's the only thing I'd change.  The taste is great and I've also tried it with Honey BBQ sauce---fantastic.  I think I may try to bake them next time because I will definitely be making these again.  My husband has asked for them three times now....haha!

I tried baking these to cut off the fat calories and they were pretty dry. Ive made these the original way and loved em! The moral of the story is, if you want eat non fat food, stick to NON fat recipies. I love these wings, the way they were meant to be:)

Awesome. These are just like the ones in the restaurants.  I melt 1/3 cup of butter with a chopped clove of garlic in the microwave and then mix in 1/4 cup of Franks Red Hot sauce.

I thought these were really, really good!  I did customize the recipe a bit by adding more of my favorite spices to the batter (Italian Spices & Garlic Plus).  I also opted to use my own sauce - Honey BBQ which I did not scrimp on.  They were finger licking good.

Fabulous! I played with the spices a bit and added much more than the recipe suggested otherwise it could be a bit bland? I pounded out a chicken breast and made sandwiches. My husband loves these and asked for them in our regular rotation. Thank you!

I use this recipe for boneless buffalo wings as well as just plain fried chicken fingers for my 6 year old! Rave reviews in my house. I never seem to have cayenne pepper when I am making this so I just substitute with ground red pepper! This is by far the best go to chicken seasoning!!!

Delicious! I made these with spicy sweet BBQ sauce instead of buffalo for my boyfriend. We ate them with a frozen pizza, garlic bread a beer... a pizza place dinner at home! The recipe is a little time consuming, but super easy and almost fool-proof (I'm not a fryer AT ALL... but mine still came out tender on the inside, crispy on the outside and perfectly coated!). The only thing I would change is the amount of flour, because like other reviewers, I barely had enough. Also, DEFINITELY double batter, it helps give the coating the restaurant look and taste! All in all a GREAT recipe!

Delicious!  I've made these many times, but haven't gotten around to review them. We love them! They are my go-to recipe for boneless wings.  The breading is absolutely delicious and I often use it to make regular chicken fingers for the guys, who don't like spicy.  THank you for this keeper recipe!

GREAT recipe! Considering my bf doesnt like chicken wings that much so I make these the only thing though is I noticed the recipe called for a cup of flour which isnt enough I tripled the flour batter and that was just enough for my 2 large breast I used! Ty for the delish recipe

Absolutely love this recipe! My husband and I are die-hard buffalo chicken strips lovers and this recipe is perfect when you are craving them, but have a low budget and are cooking at home. We follow the recipe exactly (except for cooking time of the chicken, which probalby varies among cooking wear) and they always come out great.

4 stars because I only used this as a base recipe but changed some of it since I didn't have some  ingredients on hand. I didn't have garlic powder so I omitted salt and used garlic salt instead. I also didn't have paprika so I left that out as well. Another thing I did different was to add crushed corn flakes to add to the crunch level. Frank's Red Hot Sauce was used for the hot pepper sauce. The kids didn't get the sauce as it was too spicy, but we loved it. This recipe would be one to share for sure!

These were amazing! I followed the recipe closely, perhaps being a bit more liberal with the spices and I baked rather than fried. I used Franks Red Hot for the sauce and mmmm mmm they turned out awesome! Next time I will try frying them because I know they will be amazing.

Wow so yummy!  Used Franks Red Hot Wing sauce like all the other reviews suggested.  Had celery and ranch dressing on the side (made that too). My husband and I ate them all! This recipe is a keeper. Only thing I would do different is not dredge the meat since the chicken I use will have skin. It was very good... but one less step is always better. Thank you for this recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe! I jazzed it up a bit and added a little Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce to the egg and milk mixture, along with garlic powder, the cayenne, and black pepper. I also didn't cut the chicken in strips. I used 2 large chicken breasts and cut them up in bite size pieces. It made about 30 pieces in total. Oh, and i'm a little bit of a butter girl, so I used about 4 tablespoons! I followed the rest of the directions, and of course stuck with the Franks Wing Sauce. These were amazing. My husband even said they tasted exactly like Applebees wings. But in my oppinion they were better, because they didn't cost me an arm and a leg!

These are fabulous!  The coating crunches up really nicely and the hot sauce is soo good.  I opted to pan fry instead of deep fry and am looking forward to making this again.

Perfect blend of spices. The double breading wasthe best I've done at home yet. I brushed Frank's hot sauce on the fried chicken and put it in the oven on 425 degrees for 10 minutes to make the breading crunchy again. Everyone in the family loved it.

My husband is a hot sauce freak, so i decided to give these a try. I made them in a big pot and put them in vegetable oil. I thought they were good, but without realizing it, my husband had bought "extra hot" Franks red hot sauce, and I even added extra hot sauce. I could only eat a couple, but he ate the rest. Thanks so much!

This recipe is hands down the best I have ever tried for wings with or without the bone in.  I even used boneless thigh meat too, they were wonderful.  The spice mix is awesome, however, if you are usinfg the amount of chicken in the recipe, you definitely need to double the spice and flour mixture.  These boneless wings are soo good you done even need sauce on them!!  My family and friends love when I make chicken wings for them!!

The chicken recipe is great. Pretty standard... Sauce though should not be microwaved, ends up with a strange texture. Heat it up on the stove top until melted and let simmer.
NOTE: If you have been searching for a way to make your sauce thick and have the exact texture as at your favorite restaurant or bar here is what you do. Mix 1 tbsp of corn starch (not flour) and 1 tbsp of water in a bowl. After sauce has melted together, mix the mixture into your sauce!

My whole family loves this recipe.  I serve these to the kids (19 months, 4 and 6 yrs) without the sauce and I don't get any complaints about the cayenne.  I used 2.2 lbs of ck tenderloins and added about 1/4 c of flour.  Thanks Betty!

Great recipe. I didn't not alter a thing ingredients wise and they came out perfect. Since I'm not a fan of super spicy foods and the the hubby is, I decided to only toss half the batch in the sauce for him and leave the rest plain for me. He loved them and I enjoyed the subtle kick the breading had on it's own.

These were super yummy!  They really are not super spicy, a very mild flavor.  You could easily make them hotter by using more hot sauce and less butter.  I like mine hot and saucy, so I used about double the amount of hot sauce called for.  Also, cooling them on a wire rack will keep them crisp.  When serving them to my kids, I just gave them the chicken before it got tossed in the hot sauce.  Without the hot sauce bath and even with the cayenne in the batter, they still didn't think they were too spicy.

Yum! These tasted just like Applebees boneless wings. I did double the flour mixture as what the recipe calls for is not enough.

My husband generally doesn't make comments about saving recipes, etc., but as soon as he tasted these boneless wings he asked me to keep the recipe and to please make these for a party we were going to the next week. A HUGE hit on all fronts. GREAT recipe.

These were excellent.  Wouldn't change a thing.  It took some time to fry them, but worth every minute.  I made them for our bridge group and they devoured every one.

These were delicious! I really don't like boneless wings out in restaurants, I find them too overcooked and the breading to be gross. These were the opposite! 
I did cook them in the deep fryer, and measured everything the same to the recipe. The only thing I changed, is that you need a lot more sauce (whether it's hot buffalo sauce, bbq, etc) than the recipe calls for.

Great fried chicken recipe...3 stars because we weren't fans of the sauce and I had to go back in the middle of coating the chicken and make a second batch of the flour mixture. Newbies, make double for the flour mixture! Better safe than sorry...

I didn't double coat the chicken pieces and didn't add in paprika. I also added double the garlic powder.
The flour coating was SO good. Light and crispy. I'll be using it again for regular fried chicken in the future.
I don't think there would've been enough of the flour mixture to double coat though. By the time I was done coating the cut up 3 chicken breasts, there was barely anything left.

I was making things for the football game,(Cincinnati vs Tampa Bay), HUGE SPORTS FAN.  Anyway these turned out really good.  The only problem was that the coating was blan.  The sauce did make it good though.  My cousin was outside with his friends and they ate them all.  They even wanted MORE.  Huge hit, thanks.

These are so good!! I have been using this recipe for a long time.  My kids don't like the hot sauce so I make some without it.  I also use this recipe and make the breading for chicken fried steak.. Yum!  The mixure stays on by double breading it and putting it in the fridge so it stays cold.     Just get cube steak and bread it with the mixture (without hot sauce and butter) and then fry on each side. Serve plain or with gravy on top.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and my boyfriend loved it! I did however make only half the wings with the hot sauce on them. I made the rest with just bbq sauce which made some not so spicy for my wimpy tongue.

Love the seasonings in the flour!  Since I usually soak in buttermilk, I use less milk in the egg mixture.  I bake my tenderloin pieces at 400 for about 30 minutes.  Perfect every time!

these wings are AWESOME!!! Look no further! I was skeptical at first on how they would come out, but they they are just like a restaurant! The only thing I changed was took a 1/2 cup of franks buff wing sauce and 3 tbs of butter and melted it on the stove, next time I will use more hot sauce.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and there was just enough of the flour mixture to double coat all of my chicken strips and I used three chicken breasts just like the recipe stated.  Not sure why everyone commented that there wasn't enough.  This recipe was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!!  I didn't have a cup of milk only around 1/2 of a cup, so I added an extra egg and some water to the egg mixture.  I ended up leaving my chicken strips in the fridge for around an hour because I had to go pick my daughter up from school.  Also I started off triple coating the strips and then got lazy and only double coated them but I didn't notice a difference.  They were all perfectly coated and crispy.  For the hot sauce mixture I heated it up on the stove and doubled the recipe and added a little extra butter.  Then I put the chicken strips in a big bowl and poured the buffalo sauce over them.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!  My daughter, who loves Buffalo Wild Wings, said they tasted just like theirs.  We dipped them in ranch dressing because we aren't blue cheese fans in my house.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  I will make this one over and over for many years to come!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

AWESOME! i have been searching for a great buffalo wing recipe... and this is it (nearly)! after trying another one with a rating for who knows why it was so high... this one was almost SPOT ON! the one small issue (nearly not one at all) was that the cook time was too low for me. i had 1"x1"x1/2" cuts and they took about 10-11 minutes to get golden brown & done- maybe it is my deep dryer?? 
but the only thing i can suggest is just to watch the deep fryer, otherwise, this recipe is nearly perfect! adjust hot sauce & butter ratio to your liking and this is soooo close to what you would find served at a restaurant. thank you for a great recipe, BETTYCOOK! :)

As written 4 stars, with changes 5 stars-the only 3 things I would change next time is DOUBLE the flour/seasoning mixture, OMIT the salt and DOUBLE the hot sauce/butter mix. I will def make this again with those changes. All in all this is a great recipe. Thanks for posting! (oh and I used 3 chx breasts and made this using "burrito" sized tortillas which made 3 them)

I used 4 chicken breasts, followed the directions for the breading but I also added in pepper mustard seasoning and garlic/herb seasoning.  I baked the chicken on racks with a baking sheet underneath for about 30 minutes @ 450F (I checked on them and kept baking until they looked fully cooked).  The only problem I had was some of the breading stuck to the rack and ripped off, next time I will remember to use cooking spray! At the end I coated half the chicken with Franks buffalo sauce mixed with some ranch, and I coated the other half with a mixture of Honey teriyaki marinade, BBQ sauce, and parmesan.

We really liked these.  We used them to make buffalo chicken salads.  I wish they were a little crispier though.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved the flavor.  I will make this again.

Oh yeah, this is a great recipe.  I'd never had success frying chicken (could never get the breading right) but this recipe did the trick.  I doubled the flour mixture but kept the egg/milk wash the same and was able to fry up 3+ pounds of chicken tenders.  Everyone was raving!

My husband doesn't like spicy food too often, but he asks for these wings once or twice a week. They are so easy to make too. We've tried several homemade wings, and this simple recipe definitely wins.

Crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. I used chicken breast tenderloins cut into to smaller pieces. I used big ziplock bags for the flour and milk mixtures and had enough ingredients and two less dishes to clean. I thought these could use more cayenne or black pepper before I put the hot sauce on, but I used Texas Pete Hotter Hot Sauce and it blew me away. Great recipe!

The mixture of seasonings in the flour of this recipe bring just the right amount of flavor to the chicken. It is definitely a big hit with my family, my husband even comes back for seconds, and he is not much of a chicken person.

WE LOVED THEM! My husband loves this chicken. I was afraid it would be to spicy for me, I a bit of a wimp. I made them excactly to the recipe. I used Louisiana hot sauce with the butter. It was NOT TOO HOT, but PERFECT. This is one of my favorites

Excellent!  I used a buffalo wing sauce and doubled the amount and instead of tossing the tenders in the sauce I kept basting them.  SOOO good, chopped them up and put them on a salad.  Great dinner idea

This was everyone's favorite snack last Sunday! I doubled the flour mixture, drenched them in olive oil and baked the strips at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.  I didn't toss them in the buffalo sauce..  I have a picky crowd to please so I left them plain and served them with dips on the side. Yum!

Amazing recipe. The only things I did differently is I marinaded my chicken strips overnight in Italian dressing and then patted them dry before dipping in the egg mixture. I also added 3x the garlic powder because we love garlic in our house! Without a doubt the best buffalo chicken strips any of us have ever had! Also it needed twice the amount of flour mixture for three chicken breasts.

We didn't have any chicken in the house but were craving Buffalo Wings, so we cut two pork chops into strips and used them instead. Amazing!!

One word: Amazing! I made these for my husband last night, and he said they were the best boneless wings he'd ever had. I doubled the recipe, and it came out great! I can't wait to make these for a get together I'm hosting in a few weeks. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I loved this recipe. EXCEPT for the texas pete. We used Lousiane Hot Sauce the second time we tried it  and liked the flavor much better.  I find there is more flavor in Lousiane and less of the bitter after taste of texas pete--and I'm from the Carolinas where we like a vinegared hot sauce). 
This altered sauce also makes a nice breaded chicken breast sandwhich.

I tried this recipe for a small get together with friends (Halloween eve movie watching). I honestly hadn't expected it to taste quite so good! They were really fantastic. Better than any restaurant I've ever had them. ...and this recipe calls for a lot less butter than others on the net.
One note - The recipe suggests 1 tbsp of butter. I used about half that to try to cut a little bit of the cals and it was still very, very good.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed recipe exactly with flour and milk/egg mixture leftover. I doubled the recipe and made one batch with the hot wing sauce and the second batch I left plain for kids. I had some left over "clone of a pretzel dip" from this site and used that as a dip for the plain ones! NO LEFTOVERS and we would have eaten more!!  Cannot wait to make again.

Great recipe! This is actually one of the first times I've ever fried anything, so I was a bit nervous. I shouldn't have been...this chicken turned out wonderful! The only thing I did differently was to add a couple extra ingredients to the hot sauce based on another buffalo sauce recipe on this site. I tasted the chicken before tossing in the sauce, & it was delicious! So either way, a great meal!

I love love love this recipe. I took other's suggestions like double the spices and the trick for keeping it crisp by using the wire rack instead of a paper towel worked great. Also using Franks Wing Sauce also helped, it was much better that just the pepper sauce.

After having these I will NEVER buy buffalo wings from the store again. The breading was fantastic all on it's own. The only change I made was to put some Frank's in the egg/milk mixture. Thanks.

Wow!!! My husband loved these! My husband could eat his weight in buffalo wings and he really enjoyed these. They were a little messy when mixing the chicken with the flour mixture and milk/egg mixture, but they still turned our great. I didn't have any unbleached flour so I used regular all-purpose flour and they still turned out great. To better coat the wings, I placed them all in a large zip lock bag and poured the hot sauce down in with the wings and mixed everything together. Great recipe!!

These turned out perfect for a family that LOVES boneless wings. I used a jar of wing sauce but followed the recipe other than that. These would work well for regular fried chicken strips without the sauce as well. Very good! Plus I should mention that I have never made fried chicken with a crust/coating before and these turned out perfect.

This recipe is awesome! The chicken, even before you put the hot sauce on, is soooo good! The breading is amazing! It was a huge hit with my roommates and they were begging me to make them again just a couple days later! I had to double the flour mixture though, because I ran out the first time.

OMG, my 15 year old son made these by himself and they are the best wings I have ever tasted! The only change we made was using soy milk because we were out of regular.

I have used this site for over 5 years now, and have NEVER rated anything... But can I just tell you, this is the easiest BEST chicken recipe! I made it a couple nights ago, and craving it again tonight! A money saver for those people who LOVE Chili's, Abblebees, TGIF boneless buffalo wings!

These wings were delicious!  However, I had to make 2 small substitutions.  I realized I was out of paprika, so I googled a substitute for it and found chili powder is a good alternative.  I also substituted margarine for butter.  I was worried they were going to be super spicy with the amount of cayenne and hot sauce, but they were perfect!  Also, I'd recommend no more than 1 lb of chicken.  I had 1.36 lbs and ran out of the flour mixture.

I made these boneless wings and they were awesome! I only used 2 chicken breast and the amount of flour mix was perfect. I can't comment on the sauce since I used my own Franks red hot sauce to make my own. perfect with my homemade pizza!

I used two+ pounds of thinly sliced chicken breasts, cutting each one into 3 long pieces.  I needed to double the flour mixture but not the egg/milk.  I fried in a cast iron skillet in 4 batches, with just enough oil to fry each side and then flip.  My family all loved these and my daughter said it's now her favorite meal.  Thank you for posting this...we'll be enjoying it often.

I used this recipe for whole breasts to make sandwiches.  It was so easy and tasted better than the sandwich you get at a restaurant.  I think the double dip before frying made it extra crispy too!  I used 1/3 cup franks red hot and 1/3 cup butter for the sauce.

What a crowd pleaser!! I tripled the recipe and bought many packages of winglettes and the flour mixture lasted me through all of the winglettes. However, when I made the sauce, I had complaints that they were "TOO HOT!!!" I made some without the sauce though, and still got good reviews of them!!! Will make again, just less hot sauce!!

I doubled the breading portion.  The double dip was perfect, but a triple dip would be divine!  Next time I would cut my chicken pieces smaller.

THESE ARE FANTASTIC!!! I highly reccomend the double breading as one is not enough - works much better in the deep fryer that it does in a skillet on the stove top

I use 2 cups of flour and omit the cayenne, and I use a package of boneless chicken tenders. I fry them in my deep fryer for 7 minutes then put them on a cooling rack while I'm finishing the others. I'm the only one that likes buffalo sauce in my house so I just put a few cooked strips in a ziploc w/ a bit of Frank's Redhot buffalo sauce and shake it to coat. My family eats theirs w/ honey mustard or BBQ sauce for dipping. The prep time is definitely more than 10 minutes but it's so worth it! These are restaurant quality.

Wow-these were fantastic! I had to make another 1/2 batch of the flour mix but that's the only change. Family was more than happy w/these!

AMAZING! I did alter it slightly, more due to my lack of ability to follow directions. I mixed all the flour, spices, milk and egg together to make a batter then let the chicken sit in the batter until the oil was hot. (Maybe 15 minutes). Then I took the chicken out and tossed it in a little extra flour since I had, by then, realized my mistake. But it still came out absolutely amazing. HUGE hit with the husband who loves wings. I will definitely make this again!

Needless to say - these were scrumptious!!  Didn't need to change a thing other than to double the coating mixture!!  Also, I used Perdue's chicken tenders instead of the larger boneless chicken breasts and they came out perfect!  I can now stop searching for the perfect chicken finger/boneless buffalo wings recipe because I've found it.  During the first bite, before my husband could even swallow it, he pointed to the chicken and said "you can definitely feed me these again!!"  It was soooo funny the way he said that.  Thanks Bettycook for a wonderful recipe.

My son and I love spicy chicken wings. So when I found this recipe I had to try it. I did take the advice from previous reviewers and used more flour mixture and baked mine. However I had a lot of flour mixture that I threw away. And when I took them out of the oven they still had flour on them, until I coated with sauce. I served these with a big salad and plenty of ranch dipping sauce. My son and I loved it. Will def make again!

These are awesome!  And you folks out there that say chicken wings are "dark meat"?  You better go back to school because they are for sure white meat!

My husband LOVED these! I made them exactly as the recipe says to. I also made a kid friendly version of nuggets without the cayenne pepper and my 2 and 4 year old loved them.   Next time I'll bake them, to avoid all the fat... and I'll compare to see if they come out just as yummy. Thanks so much for posting!

AWESOME!!  Puts Applebee's to shame!  I used chicken breasts and sliced into one inch strips.  The batter was awesome.  I kicked it up with a little extra cayenne.  My family devoured these!  I think these would be great for football Sunday except I would probably cut the chicken into bite-size cubes and serve with toothpicks in them.  Used Fat free Chunky Bleu Cheese dressing.  You couldn't taste the missing fat!!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I made these for a football party.  They were a huge hit.  Everyone loved them.  The chicken was so juicy and tender.    When I was coating them I kept having to add flour, so next time I'll go with 2 1/2 cups of flower instead of one.  I'll definitely do this recipe again.  It's fabulous!

Betty, thank you so much for this recipe. I seldom deep fry anything, but these were well worth the effort. I kicked up the spices a bit for our tastes and used beaten eggs (no milk) for the dipping and breading step. Just as you said, they cook perfectly in 5 minutes and they are scrumptious. Will make again and again.

I used a little more garlic powder because I love garlic and I also baked them.  I made honey mustard sauce for my daughter's wings.  I also baked some sweet potatoe fries for the side and it was a hit in my family. I did emailt his recipe to a friend.  Thank you for sharing.

The only two things that I would change is that I would add garlic powder and more butter to the hot sauce mixture. Then, I would put my seasonings actually on my chicken instead of in the flour. That way you use LESS spices. ;-D ..I will make this again and again. :-)

These came out great except that they didn't stay crispy once I brushed the sauce on them.  I wonder if anyone has a solution for that.  My boyfriend LOVED the taste of them but they started to upset my stomach after a few - which is odd because I eat hot wings regularly.  I don't know if it was the wings or something unrelated.  I used 1 package of chicken breast tenders and cut them each in half.  It made about 20 pieces, which was plenty for two of us.  I had leftovers of both the flour and the egg mixture.

Absolutely delicious. Based on other reviews, I baked these in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, and they were perfectly crispy.  I was skeptical of the hot pepper sauce and butter as the only "sauce", but it was delicious and perfectly spicy.  Yum!  We paired these with fried pickle chips - and those were delicious too - just like at a local wing restaurant.

These are so good. I coat the chicken and leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours before frying it. I leave half of the batch without putting the hot sauce over it for my kids, and let the other half soak up the spicy hot sauce for me and my hubby. This is a great recipe for just chicken nuggets for the kids minus the hot sauce.

These were sooo good. Me and hubby both loved these. They were just as good as any buffalo wing you find in a restaurant. We are excited to try them with different sauces. They are also good without sauce if your wanting some plain chicken tenders.

These are the best, the only thing I do differently is crank up the oven to 500 and bake them for about 15-20 minutes. They come out crispy and fresh. SOOO Delicious.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe.  I went ahead and did 1.5 on the flour mixture per other reviewers.  I baked after spraying with olive oil and after baking coated half with a butter/Frank's combination.  They were very tasty but looked pale and uninteresting.  Maybe frying helps the appearance.

Good wings. I baked these instead of frying them after pouring sauce on top of breaded chicken. Was very good. I'm sure they would taste even better fried...but for health reasons I just couldn't go there. SMILE

We will never buy frozen boneless wings again...here is what we did 1) 5 chicken breasts split into 4 skinny strips and halved 2) coated with exact recipe measurements; put in fridge for 4 hours 3) fried per directions 4) changed the sauce 3 TBS butter, 1/2 c hot sauce 1/2 c bbq (KC MasterPiece or Sweet Baby Ray's)....WOW!!! Hubby LOVED it so did I, we had 10 strips to take for lunch and another 15 we froze.

A fun recipe to play with!  I added a 1/4 cup of corneal to the dredge for an even crispier crust.  Thank you Betty, this is a keeper.

Great wings. Made two batches. One with the sauce, one without the sauce for the kids.  They came out beautiful!!!  Did not double the flour recipe and should have. Will be a featured at my Super Bowl party.

Very time consuming but very worth it. After doing the double coating and letting the ckicken sit in the fridge, it was really sticky and weird. I thought they were going to be horrible, but they were wonderful. They were really crispy even after tossing them in the sauce. Will be making these often on the weekends.

Just a little note to add to the original recipe.  It's not necessary to use Hot Sauce.  You can buy Honey Garlic Sauce or your favorite BBQ Sauce.  Heat sauce and add wings to coat.  It won't have that Buffalo wing taste, but not everyone likes hot sauce.

This is the best recipe for breading that I've ever used with chicken. The double-dredge makes it super crispy and I definitely recommend not skipping the refrigeration step! It really holds them together and gives you the best outcome when frying. They come out perfectly cooked and crispy with more of a flavour then I was expecting. I can't recommend this enough!

Best boneless wing recipe I've made. The ingredients are on point but I actually add a little more. I double the black pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I also add in onion powder as well. After frying them, you can eat these without buffalo sauce (but why would you do that?), sort of like chicken tenders.


I fry them at 325 degrees for around four minutes max since I go for thinner chicken slices. Definitely do not do 375 unless you want the breading to burn more than it cooks the actual chicken. You can get away with 350, but 325 is perfect in my opinion.


I've made this over a dozen times and I've had the best results when the chicken slices are thinner than usual (maybe between 1/4" - 1/3". It's the optimal breading to chicken ratio when it's a bit of a thin rectangle/strip piece, because you also are able to layer in more sauce.


Last bit of advice, add in a touch of vinegar to your wing sauce. Helps a lot.

My sons really like Buffalo Wild Wings chicken wings.  I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  It was so easy!  My 13-year-old helped me make it, and it turned out to be very tasty.  I made it with two sauces:  Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo and Pappy's Buffalo Wing Medium Sauce.  I preferred the Pappy's.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used more butter for the sauce.  My husband didn't use any sauce and said he liked the chicken.

I made these and put them in a flour tortilla with romaine lettuce, tomato, onion, sharp cheddar and blue cheese dressing. Best buffalo chicken wrap I have ever eaten. : )
I did run out of the flour mixture and had to make more, I suggest doubling the flour mixture  if making 3 chicken breast.

Made it following recipe, but baked it rather than frying. Basted cooked chicken with sauce. Sauce was quite spicy for my son, but we dipped in Ranch dressing while eating. Nice and crispy thanks to double coating. Not difficult, but a bit time consuming.

I added more black pepper and garlic powder.  After coating them,  I baked them at 400 degrees for 35 minutes or until golden brown.  I ate them plain or lightly dipped in bbq sauce. Now my favorite recipe for chicken nuggets!

Made pretty much as per recipe but less salt, more paprika. Fried and then took out. Fried again and took out. Finished in the oven. Served to my son as chicken tenders no sauce, tossed mine in straight Franks Original, no butter....Very tasty, fresh and great knowing what goes into my food!

I suggest doubling the flour mixture.  I actually ended up re-making the flour mix 3 times, but barely used the 3rd.  So double that and these are PERFECT!!

This was my first time making this.  I was so happy with it.  I did run out of the flour mixture as well.  I stopped double dipping and it was okay.  They came out fantastic.  This was my first time frying as well and the fryer worked perfectly.  Now I don't have to go out for wings.  I put the hot sauce on some of them and will use a variety of sauces for the rest so everyone can enjoy them.  They were perfect with nothing as well.  Thanks for the recipe

This was a great recipe. I've never fried anything before and didn't realize how easy it would be. I did use 4 chicken breasts but I had enough ingredients from the recipe to coat all the pieces without making any adjustments. Very happy with the results.

These were outstanding.  I tried baking at 400 for 20 min as someone else suggested, but they just didn't crisp up.  Will definitely fry next time.  All in all, tho, we thoroughly enjoyed.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I would suggest to people who are frying to use canola or peanut oil. I would also make sure that it is clean or strained and doesn't have a rancid smell too it. If the oil is dirty you will burn the outside of your chicken. I would also check the accuracy with a thermometer of your oil. Most fryers are not accurate at all.

My family loves these wings. They are awesome. I double the dry ingredients . I also bake them sometimes and fry them sometimes. Both ways are great. I prefer fried because they are crispier but less healthy.

I've made these a few times and they always turn out great. I don't use the hot pepper sauce but instead I buy a bottle of sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the ingredient amounts are way off. For three chicken breasts I end up needing around 4 or 5 cups of flour. The first time I made these with only one cup of flour it didn't even finish coating one chicken breast and I had to make the flour mix two more times in double batches. I also end up needing 5 eggs and only use 1/2 cup of almond or soy milk (I don't use dairy milk). This may seem like big amounts but when you double dip the chicken a lot of flour gets into the egg mixture, making it very thick which makes it go faster. If you're making these for the first time, make sure you have extra flour and eggs on hand, you're gonna need them. If you end up having too much flour and egg mixture after all the chicken is double coated, don't be afraid to triple coat what you can, it'll make them extra crunchy (if you like that). Overall though, great and easy recipe! Thank you for sharing.

Ouch! I made these tonight for my family. We love buffalo wings and thought these would go well with our main dish. Unfortunately 1/4 cup of hot sauce is melt your face off hot...waaaaaaay too hot...painfully spicy. I tossed only a few strips in the sauce to taste them first and am so glad I did. After watching me chug a glass of milk, apply liberal amounts of chapstick, blow my nose and wipe my eyes my family wisely decided to eat theirs either plain or with barbeque sauce. That said, they are really delicious just plain! Next time I will use our tried and true buffalo sauce recipe.

I have the most picky of a teenager. Most days require a trip to as fast food restaurant for chicken tenders. Thru rain, snow sleet and hurricane. I tried three recipes with no luck...until today!!! These are the most flavorful, juicy and crispy tenders EVER!!! And this is my first time to ever rate a recipe to date! These where so impressive that I even wrote this comment!

These are seriously THE BEST boneless wings I've ever had. Way better than any restaurant! I double the breading recipe and put it into two ziplock bags and shake the chicken around in the bags when breading. Great with buffalo sauce or without as chicken strips!! Delicious!!

These are fantastic and turn out restaurant style. I make a few modifications: If you use whole wheat flour instead of white they get even more crispier. Also because of lactose intolerance I substitute the milk with sth. like almond, soy or hemp milk - works perfectly with either one. For the buffalo sauce I use Frank's Red Hot. If you then use canola oil for deep frying and eat your celery sticks, this is not that unhealthy anymore. Eh, it probably is, but then who cares :) Great treat! Thanks for this awesome recipe.

As a 20-year wing fanatic I was pretty skeptical but this recipe has Buffalo Wings nailed!
Following a few other reviews I made some minor changes: 
- Baked for 30 minutes at 400 instead of deep fried.  Without the skins and with baking, this is MUCH healthier than restaurant wings!
- Doubled the sauce, using Frank's Red Hot (the standard for Buffalo wings).
- Baked on a wire rack to make crunchier.
The result - these were much crunchier that I'd expected for baking and were a spot-on match for regular wings.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Wow!  I have never been able to do homemade chicken tenders before, and I've cooked a long time!  Don't skip the 20 minutes in the fridge, it really makes the breading stick. You could absolutely just skip the hot sauce and have these as chicken tenders for your kids.  I bought a pound of chicken tenders and used the measurements exactly.  Next time I would up the salt a little bit or even add some Lawry's.  They were flavorful plain but could use a tad more seasoning.  I will use this again and again as a great base recipe for chicken tenders for a salad, an appetizer- or whatever.

My kids love Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant but the closest one is two hours away. They think these are just as good especially with the sauce we buy from the restaurant. I double the flour mixture so I don't run out.

This is a great recipe for Buffalo Boneless Chicken!I usually make wings but my 13 year old daughter LOVES boneless so we gave em' a try.I usually tenderize all of my bnls,sknl chicken by placing between wax paper and gently pounding from the center,outward till it doubles in size.I didn't do that for some reason when I followed this recipe,next time I will.It makes the chicken so much more juicy and tender.The batter and frying method  was awesome.However,I use Chef John's Buffalo Wing sauce which in my opinion is the absolute best.It was delicious with this recipe.

I only followed the chicken part of this recipe - I used Chef John's Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce recipe for the sauce (which was AMAZING). I used mini chicken fillets, or chicken cutlets. Did the double breading - so bad yet SOOO good. I don't have a deep fryer, so I used a stock pot and filled it 2" high with olive oil. 5-6 mins and the chicken came out perfect! I did refrigerate the chicken after coating for at least 20 mins. Wouldn't change a think about the chicken.

I only used a few of the spices, but I doubled the flour as others suggested. I now use 2 & 1/4 cups of flour total just so I don't run out. I would also minimize milk to a half cup. I cooked in 1/2" of oil in a pan and I flipped after 3 minutes on one side, cooking a total of 6 minutes. Put them on a wire rack and they were really good.

Fantastic!  I'll never have to go to a restaurant and pay astronomical prices again for boneless wings.  I did double the flour mixture like other reviewers suggested and skipped on the cayenne pepper because we use Franks red hot so I figured the cayenne would be overkill.  Fried was wonderful and have some in the oven now to see how they taste baked.  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

We go to the same bar for boneless buffalo tenders that we consider the "best" and first taste, my fiance said that these were even better! I think I may have even cut the strips a little too thick but they still tasted delicious.  It helps to let the chicken cool on a wire rack for a bit before adding the sauce (will make them a little more crisy).  I also doubled the sauce and used 2tbsp of butter... try Frank's! Soo good! this will be a new regular for football sunday!

These were amazing! I baked them instead of frying them too- per other reviews, sprayed them with cooking spray and popped them in the oven for 20ish minutes at 400 degrees. Turned out EXCELLENT!

These were soooo good! We doubled the flour (and spices) and used 3 eggs as we had huge chicken breasts- I'm sure that part will vary. We debated whether the author means double dipping both the egg and flour, but after rereading the directions, decided that is how it's read- so we did that, and wow! That coating was not coming off and it was delicious. For the sauce we used 1/4 Tabasco and 1/4 cup of Pico/Pica Hot Sauce with a little more than 2T butter- yummy! For dipping sauce we used a blue cheese vinaigrette I accidentally purchased and it was really good. Regular blue cheese would be great and I gave my son ranch dressing.

We will make this again :)

We love buffalo wings, and have gone from using wings to legs, but are tired of the mess and bones.  This recipe was wonderful!  My persnickety 7-year old ate like it was candy!  
 I didn't use the cayenne in the flour seasoning for hers, and it was a hit for the kids.  We will definitely use this one over and over.  It's so easy to accommodate everyone's tastes.  My one tip is to definitely refrigerate the chicken after dipping.  The flour/egg really gets messy and goopy if it's not a little solid.

This recipe is truly fantastic. I cook three meals a day, at least 5 days a week and use all kinds of internet recipes for inspiration. This one is GREAT! The flour breading is unbelievable. I have made this about 6 times already and get amazing compliments! I have made the chicken and kept the hot sauce off for my kids, and they love the chicken and batter - think KFC but homemade and without all those preservatives! This is definitely worth making!! My only comment is that it can be a little spicy even without the buffalo sauce. I love spice, but if you make it for the kids or as part of a meal not intended to be spicy I would cut back to half of the black and cayenne pepper. I also substituted chili powder one time and that gave a nice mello kick that the kids enjoyed. Also, I triple the flour and egg parts and use about 5 chicken breasts.

Just like a typical man, I didn't listen carefully. I combined the spices, milk and egg then double coated the strips in the flour but it turned out really great! I'll make another one and post pix, thanks!

These were good but not great. Like a lot of people, I ran out of the flour mixture. And this was even after I stopped double coating it halfway through. It was time consuming (way longer than 10 min) and there was a huge mess to clean up. The chicken was fine until I put the sauce on it. It lost it's crispiness. Next time, I might try letting them bake in the oven for a bit at the end.

The only change I made was to pan fry them in an electric skillet set to 375 degrees with about 1/2 inch of oil, turning them once till well browned. Super crispy! Used the butter/hot sauce mixture as a dip instead of coating them and used blue cheese salad dressing straight from the bottle as a second dip. They were even good cold the next day. Awesome!

I stuck to the recipe as this was my first attempt at it, and although it got a bit messy with the double dipping it turned out great.  I asked my family how many stars out of five they thought I should give it and the answer was six!  I made enough to have some for lunch tomorrow but my 17 year old just wolfed the lot down, so I know it was good!

Believe the reviews - it's that good. I made it exactly as written and the family - and I - LOVED this. I've not written in on any other recipe but felt compelled to chime in and also want to say Thanks, Betty! This is great for families but also would be excellent for a young person to make to "impress" another young person with abilities in the kitchen....in another era, one would say "perfect for the newlywed bride who wants to give her husband a supper he'll like!"

The only suggestion I'll make is to give novice cooks an idea of how MUCH oil it takes to fry things. Many young people have no idea - we don't want them sautéing it!

This recipe is a keeper. Great job!

Make according to BettyCook's given directions first. I listened to some other reviewers and ended up with not enough egg/milk wash and way too much left over flour/spice mix. 

These were 10 stars fantastic. But due to following other's recommendations I will have to make again, following exactly Betty's instructions, to see how the recipe spices ratio suits us. I had so much flour mixture left over it was sad and the chicken had not much zip after cooking, All those spices still in the bowl with the excess amount of flour. I used a candy thermometer to make sure the oil stayed hot enough.

My Hot sauce of choice: Texas Pete's, no butter necessary, don't have blue cheese cause making on the spur of the moment - use ranch. Wish I had had some celery on hand. Next time will be prepared.  This is at the top of our favorites list!

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars.  I did not have a flour shortage like many other reviewers & I used 2 lbs of chicken breasts (I think there were five that I cut up). I marinated my chicken for about an hour and a half in 3 tablespoons of buttermilk, three tablespoons of hot sauce, and three tablespoons of white vinegar. After breading (which I substituted 1/2 half and half and 1/2 buttermilk as I didn't have milk and added a dash of hot sauce) I refrigerated a tad longer than recommended. I also added some ghost pepper sauce to the hot sauce butter mixture. Turned out perfect! I was confused by the "double coating" which is why I give this 4 1/2 stars instead of five. And I tasted the chicken before adding the sauce and I think the marinade gave it a nice kick.

My husband told me that he would renew his wedding vows based on this meal alone! I guess this means he liked them! Definately a keeper and much cheaper than going out for wings! 
I baked the chicken and used Frank's Buffalo sauce that I found at Wal-Mart. I also used the Ranch II recipe from this site. REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD!

Our absolute favorite buffalo chicken recipe. I like to cut mine up nugget size so there's more breading. Makes them taste very similar to Buffalo Wild Wings!

These are restaurant good! The first time I made them, my fiance and I took bites and were wowed! I added more cayenne pepper to the flour mix and like many of the other reviewers didn't have a deep fryer so I fried it in a couple of inches of oil in a deep pan. Came out perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and my guys LOVED them!!! I now have a new "go to" recipe when I don't know what to make for dinner. We love Ranch dressing with our wings. I recommend making the Ranch dip fresh...it tastes so much better! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

I tried baking them like a couple other reviewers said they did but they certainly didn't turn out crispy.  I baked them at 400 degrees.  I breaded them like the recipe instructed and then put in refrigerator for at least 20 min. if not longer but the breading didn't want to stick to the chicken too well after they were baked.  We used leftover sauce that we had from the night before so I can't comment on the sauce.  Chicken tasted good even tho' they didn't turn out quite right.  If I make again, I'll fry like the recipe calls for.

This made me far too happy, and I added a bit more garlic and mixed some of Trader Joe's hot pepper sauce into the thicker hot sauce. My colon may debate the issue later, but it will all be worth it!

We love these wings, and all of friends/family request them for special occassions!  I even love eating them with no sauce, as the seasonings in the breading are so tasty on their own!

Simply Amazing.  They were delicious even before we put the hot sauce.  We talked about making them in the future with other sauces (honey, bbq, sweet & sour, etc.)  Great recipe.

My family loved these! I used my own hot sauce/bbq sauce and I didn't add the cayenne so that my toddler could enjoy it too. I loved how easy it was to make and adjust to our families tastes.

I make these wings all the time for my husband and I and for when we have company. Everyone always asks for the recipe b/c they are so fabulous! I usually end up doubling the recipe since we usually use 3-4 chicken breasts. Awesome recipe :)

Thank you Betty for an AWESOME recipe! I dont have a deepfryer and this was my first time frying anything on the stove.  I followed everything exactly and they were restaurant quality! I even got a hug and kiss from my husband for a job well done ;)

Thursday night is wing night in our house, but I had boneless chicken breast in the fridge that needed to be used. I went looking for a recipe and found this one. Soooooooo good!
I left off the sauce and let everyone select their own sauce as per usual on wing night (sour cream, mustard, bbq sauce were the choices tonight), along with a broccoli, spinach and red pepper salad. A perfect meal. This one is going in the recipe book. I'm going to use the left over chicken in a wrap for tomorrow's lunch :)

This is recipe is fantastic.  It was my first attempt at making homemade deep fried chicken fingers and the coating was bang on.  The tossing in warmed  hot sauce was the finishing touch.  I will always make this recipe!

Made these for a superbowl party.  I baked these instead of frying and used generic hot sauce - turned out fantastic!  Made double the sauce for dipping

You can actually add the peppers, powder and paprika to the flower and mix it together that way.  You can also skip the milk and eggs and everything sticks just fine.  But it's good for flavor.

But these are pretty much bomb.  I also like to cook them a bit with the hot sauce on them.  I also refrigerated the wings overnight with the coating.  4lbs of wings gone in one night just between the two of us.  Amazing.  But thanks for sharing, this is a great recipe, I can't wait to make this for other people.

These are always a hit when I bring them.  Everyone asks for the recipe - too bad I can't claim it as my own.  With three large breasts I have to 3x all the flour mixture items and 2x the sauce/butter mixture.  And I usually serve this as an appetizer or finger-type food at parties and 3 large breasts is usually enough to feed at least 5-7 people perhaps even more, depending on how much other food options there are.

Yummy! This takes awhile to prepare and cook but be patient, it is sooo worth it! I have looked for a recipe that rivals our fav restaurant and this is the one. I will make these again, followed the recipe exactly but used Franks Buffalo sauce instead. Next time I will double the spices and use less butter in the Sauce.  :)

I have one word to desribe this recipe....delicious.  My husband doesn't care for hot sauce so I didn't coat them in it after cooking.  They were perfectly seasoned and spicy enough if you prefer the more mild side!  I did bake them and they were excellent.

I tried these for the first time last night for a football gathering and everyone raved about them! We all agreed that these are the best boneless chicken "wings" we've ever had! I also ran out of the flour mixture but it was easy enough to throw a small batch together. I cut my strips a bit too large, but they tasted just as good...just harder to handle. Will make these again!

Tried baking them but they were dry.  Frying would be better but not as healthy.  Will not be making again.

i just cooked these for dinner for my family! they loved it, quite spicy for them, but just about the right amount of flame for me. i love tapatio! i added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the (3 serving) sauce mix to cool the burn.  with a side of celery and blue cheese? PERFECTION! thank you!!

I made these tonight (with honey garlic instead of hot sauce) for dinner and they were -fantastic-. Instead of deep frying them I shallow fried them, which was a bit easier to clean up after but a lot more time consuming. This recipe is fantastic!

These were fantastic and tasted just like Applebee's honey bbq wings. I used honey bbq instead of regular and will definitely make again. I used two chicken breasts that much be larger than normal because it made way more than three servings.

Great Recipe! I baked them at 400 for about 30 minutes. The only downfall I found about this recipe as the amount of flour. I doubled it and still barely had enough for 3 medium sized chicken breasts. Very Good though! I will make again!

Outstanding recipe!  I also doubled the flour mixture and baked at 400 degrees for 20 min.  Use cooking spray when baking.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect just the way it is.  I used Frank's Red Hot Wings (Buffalo), which in my opinion is the best buffalo sauce out there and put just a smidge more butter in the mixture.  This wings are the best!

I think this recipe is awesome.  I had some hiccups with it, but those were due to my own blunders.  The chicken, for instance, came out fantastic, but I bought a cheap sauce to save a buck and it really ruined the whole thing.  XD  Like some of the other reviewers, I did bake my chicken, and I didn't have straight cayenne pepper so I used a lesser amount of a creole seasoning blend I had lying around.  Also, if you use skim milk, I'm gonna say 1 cup is probably too much because the mixture was a bit watery and didn't coat really well on mine.  YMMV, just my thoughts.  :D

We had these last week and I forgot to review.  They were so good!  I baked them to save the calories, but who am I kidding - we are going to deep fry them next time.  I didn't like that the breading was not crisp.  I kept a couple plain for the girls and my husband and I had ours dressed with hot sauce.  They taste just like your local bar or hang-out.  Great recipe!

I tried a similar recipe for Regular Buffalo wings but these are WAY BETTER! Every bite is good! Because they looked so good coming out of the fryer, I decided to try a few WITHOUT the buffalo sauce. And guess what? They make great CHICKEN FINGERS! some honey mustard or bbq sauce and you're all set!

Awesome recipe! What else can I say... restaurant style boneless wings, yum! Have baked them in the oven or deep fried as the recipe calls for, they turn out great either way.

We don't have a deepfryer so I tossed these in the oven.  Turned out very moist, too bad it doesn't crisp like frying would.  Maybe I'll saute a bit next time before they go in the oven.  Definitely a make again meal.  We practically live on Frank's sauce so there was no way for this recipe to fail.   Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....  already thinking of when to make it again!

this recipe deserves 10 stars!  i just finished eating this and the batter was awesome.  it smelled good raw, tasted better than it smelled.  had one of my friends bring me back some texas petes from the states so i could make this recipe and it was definitely worth it.  i fried the chicken pieces for about 5-10 minutes (im paranoid about raw chicken) then tossed them with the buffalo sauce then baked them in a single layer in the oven for about 10 minutes. served with celery, fries and blue cheese dressing.... mmmmmm best meal ive had since being back in australia.  i just hope my 2 bottles of hot sauce last me till i can get moved back stateside.

I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of AP and seasoned flour. I even left directions with my boyfriend who skipped the all important step of letting these rest for 20 mins before baking. Lets just say don't skip that step. But, even though they were still powdery they still tasted great. I used my own sauce and baked these at 400 for 20 mins. These are great!

I made these for my boyfriend who loves chicken wings, and he went crazy for them...and he doesn't go crazy over much.  I followed the recipe exactly except I baked them in the oven at 400, like some others suggested, with olive oil spray.  Flipped once, and cooked until crispy.  I used boneless antiobiotic free chicken strips for him (made six or so) and I used my Quorn brand meat-free naked "chicken" cutlets for me since I'm a vegetarian.  My fake wings were excellent.  The sauce is just right.  Hot, but not too hot.  I highly recommend trying it!

Excellent!!  Made these for my Superbowl party and they were a big hit.  And for those who don't like a lot of heat, I thinned out some barbeque sauce with a little bit of butter and coated some of the wings with that instead of the hot sauce.  They still had a little kick to them because of the cayenne pepper in the batter, but they were very good.  Awesome recipe!!

Terrific! I followed others'suggestions, doubled the flour and baked them, mixing in a bowl with the sauce when done. Perfect for superbowl night.

Unbelievable.  I made these for SuperBowl 44 (Go Saints) and they were absolutely fantastic.  I've bought many orders of hot wings in my life that didn't even hold a candle to these.  I used various hot pepper sauces on the different batches of wings from medium hot to scorching and they were all awesome!  I'll definitely be making these again.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. I followed the spices and measurements word for word and the only change I made was using plain yogurt vs milk for the double batter. The sauce was just barely enough to cover 8 chicken tenderloins.

These wings are awesome, I mostly loved the sauce. That's what made the wings. Never knew mixing butter into the hot sauce would make all the difference!

This was fantastic! I omitted the cayenne as my kids were eating it... I kept some of the fried chicken unsauced for them, and sauced the rest for us. Frank's Red Hot buffalo sauce is the best! Go ahead and double the seasoned flour mixture, I 1.5x it and it still wasn't enough for three chicken breasts.

Very, very good.  I did not have cayenne pepper and substituted chili powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written, right down to the cardio-vascular surgeon friendly frying.  Glad I did, everyone loved them.  I gave four stars only because I am saving a five star rating for something out of this world.

Very easy to make. I was craving the boneless wings from Applebee's and this was just what the Dr. ordered. My son loved them. I cooked them exactly like the recipe. The chix was very crispy and they weren't too hot. Just right! I ate them with Ranch dressing....UUUUMMMM good!

Great Recipe! I used a gluten-free (wheat-free) flour instead of all-purpose flour. I had to double the flour recipe to that I had enough to cover all of the chicken - as others stated as well.  I made two batches of sauce- one just as the recipe stated and the other I added 2 tablespoons of mango pepper sauce. They were both excellent; Everyone loved them!  Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG! These were amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will use 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1. While the chicken was in the fridge, I preheated the oil. I used about 3 inches worth in a big pot. Each batch of 4 I left in for 4 minutes. I let them cool on top of a wire cooling rack. There is where they crisp up. I did have to double the sauce. My guys like their wings hot, so I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a dash of garlic powder to the sauce. Making some tonight for the Super Bowl! Soooooo good!!

The chicken itself is really bland so you need the hot sauce to add flavor to it. I really like it, it's like you're eating fast food. Everyone seems to use chicken breasts but I use chicken thighs and it tastes really good.

I made this as an appetizer to go with my son and nephew's high school graduation dinner because my son loves not wings. I used a full bag of Trader Joe's chicken breast tenderloins and cut them into 3 pieces each. I tripled the flour mixture & doubled the egg mixture.*
I mixed half with the hot sauce/butter mix and the other half with Chris & Pitts bbq sauce/butter mixture for those who don't like the heat. My son says they are the best he has had so far! Even my picky husband raged about them. And both flavors turned out yummy! Thank you for this home run! I had way too much egg mixture left over so next time I will not double it.

It tastes great, but I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. The batter is all loose and doesn't bond to the chicken well. It all falls off if I try to toss them in sauce. I even made sure to dry the chicken chunks with paper towel first.

This dish was easy to make and absolutely delicious! I don’t normally eat fried boneless chicken, but I’ll be making this again for sure!

Double your flour like most reviews suggest. These were amazing and addictive. I only wish they were crispier. I chilled them on a wire rack, fried them, and let them rest on a wire rack and they weren’t as crispy as I’d like. I also forgot to double the seasoning when I doubled the flour but they’re still great especially with blue cheese dressing as a dip.

Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!  As good, if not better, than most most restaurant boneless chicken "wings".

My whole family loves this recipe. We've made it the original way and like that, but prefer it with a few changes. Use the precut chicken strips to save time. Double the flour mixture so you wont run out. I like to replace 1/4 of the flour with corn meal for added flavor and crunch. Increase garlic powder to 1/2 tsp (for single batch), 1 tsp for full batch. Only dip it in the flour mixture once. We make it with the sauce  on the side so other sauces are options.

These were great! We used 1/4 cup of tabasco sauce and butter for the sauce and it was HOT. The chicken wings are spicy enough without it, but we liked it a lot. We also baked the wings instead of frying them. For 20 minutes @ 400 degrees, as someone mentioned in the comments. Some of the bottoms were a little charred even with cooking spray, but they were still delicious!

This recipe turned out great! I actually fried half of mine and baked the other half (I didn't have enough oil ). I can't complain at all. They were tasty and crispy! I did add a little bit of Hidden Valley Ranch "Dips" powder in Garden Green Onion flavor to the flour coating mix just on a whim...It was delicious! I recommend this recipe to anybody wanting some excellent Buffalo ecstasy as an appetizer, or as a  full meal. I'm very happy I tried these boneless wings, and I'll be making this recipe over and over again!

This was a keeper.  I took the advice of others and doubled the dry ingredients to make coating the chicken easier.  For the sauce at the end I used 3 tablespoons of Frank's red hot, 2 tablespoons of butter, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper.   I fried them over med-high heat at 375* for 5-6 minutes then drained them on a wire rack and they came out great.  Thanks!

Delicious! I would add that you need WAY more breading and binding solution. Keep adding it as needed. Also it should be noted that this is definitely double the intended portion size as there were tons of leftovers.

We had some chicken breast for dinner & I wanted to try something new, so I looked on this site & came across this recipe- thank goodness I did. This recipe is super easy & tastes delicious. The only thing I did differently was used Franks hot sauce instead of hot pepper sauce. Next time I’m going to try it with honey bbq :)

Gave it four stars because I had to keep doubling up on the ingredients. I used 5 large chicken breasts. Still came out great! I will say it doesn’t taste the same without the hot sauce. My kids don’t like spicy foods so they ate theirs plain with ketchup and didn’t love it too much. I love spicy foods and I found it to be a great recipe. Next time I’ll make less

I made these as an experiment to see how they turned out vs the chain restaurants that charge a dollar per wing. I must say that I was very happy with the results. I  would say they were just as good as the restaurants but at a fraction of the cost. My teenage son, who loves wings also agreed! I went with honey bbq sauce as that is his favorite. I will be making again.

Oh. My. Goodness. WOW! Thank you so much! I've tried frying chicken before, with a deep fryer, with disastrous results.  That being said... the instructions and times/temperatures provided for this were JUST what I needed!I made restaurant quality buffalo wings for our New Years :) I'm about to sneak into the leftovers. The only problem that I ran into, and I'm sure it's my own fault... is that I ran out of flour breading and had to repeat the mixture twice while getting the chicken reading for frying. Still, While eating the tenders, I ran into 2 especially chewy ones with a raw center :(

It was very good!  The Buffalo sauce was excellent!  The first time I have fried anything in years!  Great to double dip on the prep!  I will use the double dip on my Chicken Picante too!  I think it help's to let it set up for 20 minutes or so!

I made this with gluten free flour and it still tastes awesome! I will use this breading over and over again. I even almost forgot to use the buffalo wing sauce as the breading was so good. Definitely a keeper!
P.S. I was out of eggs and used almond milk.

Made the recipe as stated and went with strips like it says. The flour dredge was a little short for 3 breasts. Needed about 25% more to get a good coating til the end. I think next time I would prefer to season the chicken and dredge as opposed to seasoning the flour. But the breading that resulted was similar to restaurants. I will skip the first egg dredge next time and maybe it will stick a little better. The buffalo sauce was classic flavor and couldnt be easier to make. My only complaint is you need to double it for 3 breasts which is off quite a bit. Overall we are pretty happy with the recipe and will see if my prep changes make an even better result next time.

OMG!! My family loved the boneless chicken!!  My 11 year NEVER EVER NEVER EVER eat my cooked chicken from scratch!!  H e preferred them with out cause... but he loved them.. my husband loved them & my 16 year old.   I did not make the sauce due to having a variety of Baby Rays marinara & wing sauce.  So I made them a variety of flavors.  Only thing I did different is I used foil instead of parchment paper (didn't have any)!!!

These are amazingly easy !!! If you are craving wings, make these! Such a simple recipe to follow! They remind me of Hooters mild wings. I added 2 tablespoons of butter to 1/4 cup of franks.

This review is mostly for those that would like to bake it. I followed the recipe exact as far as double dipping and the sauce went. Decided to purchase a pack of Tyson chicken tenders for this and neither the breading nor sauce was enough.. someone said to bake it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.. I actually had to extend it to a total of 30 minutes. They're pretty tasty except I added an ingredient from my mom's "secret sauce" after they were done cooking I poured on the sauce just like the recipe said to but it was literally like eating straight hot sauce.. so I DRIZZLED Karo syrup. Much better I will make again.. next time fried with an adjusted hot sauce recipe.

HOLY COW!  I made as wrote, but baked at 400 for 30 mins. My husband has had many bar wings and has the physique to prove it. On a quest to make his favorite foods healthy, I tried this recipe and when he said it was amazing I didn't believe him. To be honest I thought he was trying to butter me up for a little somethin somethin. Then I tried one and OH MY GOD! They really were amazing. As good, if not better than fried. I ended up making more so I could make him a delicious wrap for work and maybe some for his buddies too, just to show off. Make this. You won't regret it.

I made this exactly as written EXCEPT that I tripled the flour mixture and doubled the egg wash. Probably didn't need to double the egg wash but I definitely needed the flour. I started with double the flour and found that I needed more. Just barely had enough for 3 chicken breasts, although 2 of them were very large and it was definitely more than 3 servings! Great recipe, flavor-wise.

Crunchy, juicy, and spicy.  I did need to double the flour mixture.  I cut the chicken into nugget size pieces and dipped them in the milk, then put them in a plastic bowl with the flour mixture, put the lid on the bowl, and shook it to really coat them fully.  Then repeated the milk and flour, like the recipe calls for.  I ran out of the flour mixture about halfway through the dipping process, so I just made more.  While I let the chicken set up I cleaned the flour bowl and used it for the sauce so I could again put the lid on and shake for even coverage.  I made some with just the buffalo sauce, then some with BBQ plus buffalo sauce.  BBQ added a nice sweetness to the heat, but that is personal preference of course.  Teen age son loved the plain buffalo nuggets just by themselves, hubby and I had the BBQ/buffalo ones on a salad.  A hit with everyone!

This is a wonderful recipe!! The chicken alone, without the sauce has a nice zing! One note: I baked it at 400 for about 12-15 minutes just because I didn't have time to stand over a pot nor clean up the oil afterwards. Like another reviewer suggested, I sprayed each piece quite heavily with olive oil cooking spray. The taste was great, but next time, I would only single-dip and dredge each piece because some flour was still crumbling off when we bit into the chicken which probably wouldn't happen had I fried it. Another note: if you leave out the cayenne, the breading is very flavorful on its own and you could serve it with a variety of dipping sauces. A good all-round recipe. Thanks for posting! We'll be making this often!!

Wow! These were wonderful! So easy to make, I used a mixture of Louisiana wing sauce and franks red hot wing sauce and these were great! My son and I are buffalo chicken nuts and I have made these 3 times and will be making them again tonight! Great recipe. I did fry them in small batches and only took a few minutes to cook them tossed them in the Buffalo sauce.

So so so good my husband loves this. I doubled everything and did 6 chicken breasts and used red pepper because I didn't have cayenne pepper. Half the batch was just plain dipped with bbq sauce and the other covered with buffalo sauce! So so so good:)

Definitely my favorite Chicken Nuggets recipe! Super flavorful and you can make them in small bite size pieces for easy kid-size eating. I usually make them without hot sauce and just dip them in ranch, ketchup, or honey mustard. I have used the breading recipe for wings before and had a different hot sauce! Still amazing!
I've made this countless times and will continue to! Definitely recommend!

Everyone in the house loves these! I use double the dry dipping mixture and buy Frank's Buffalo Hot Wings sauce.  I sometimes use rice flour as it makes a nice crispy coating.  These are great with a slightly sweet cole slaw (and beer!) to counteract all that vinegary yumminess in the hot sauce.

I don't think this recipe needed a double coat. The flavor of the seasoning was awesome!. I used wings with the bone in. I fried for five to six minutes on each side until brown. They turned out amazing! I made these for a Super Bowl party. Everyone loved them!!

So easy, and so yummy! I made these for my friends, and my friends' girlfriend said these were the best wings she's ever had.
I usually go to 1/2 cup of hot sauce just to add a little more messiness.

Good basic recipe. The chicken came out nice and crispy. The people that are complaining about how the chicken was cooked simply just didn't cook it right (and remember to use a cooling rack). I doubled the recipe and did about 5 chicken breasts cut in to strips.

Phenomenal! Didn't use the garlic powder, cayenne or paprika and they came out perfect. Tastes just like if not better than a restaurant. Kids also liked dipping them in homemade bbq sauce instead of wing sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly but found there wasn't nearly enough of the flour mix to coat all of the chicken. I had to double the amount of the flour mixture. Other than that, it came out perfectly and tasted delicious!

Very very tasty! I made these to go with buffalo chicken wraps.  One recommendation though after you bread them make sure they sit in the fridge 60-90 minutes.

Delicious! I only used 1/2 a cup of milk in the egg mixture, and baked instead of fried at 375 for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway and broiling for the last five minutes, but I left the flour mixture the same. I used BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce too, because I'm not much of a fan of spicy foods. My sister-in-law said they taste just like Applebees!

Great recipe.  I made the wings and then tossed them in a Franks Hot Sauce/Butter sauce and it was amazing.   I would definitely recommend this recipe.  I did 10 minutes per batch in about 2 inches of vegetable oil as recommended in the reviews and they turned out great.

I used 2 chicken breasts and the flour mixture was more than enough.  The wings were great! They were crispy and surprisingly easy to make. I substituted the cayenne powder for chili powder because i didn't have any on hand and I also used a ready made bottled wing sauce.  These wings are easily comparable to Applebee's . I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is excellent!  I tried it both fried and baked and with other sauces as well as the one in the recipe...Excellent!!!!  ( I followed another reviewer on the baking ...400 degrees for 20 minutes PERFECT)
   My only issues was I cut up one large chicken breast and barely had enough coating to dip the pieces twice, so maybe it needs doubled for more pieces...)

Delicious!!!!! Very crispy and flavorful. I used buttermilk instead of the milk and egg mixture, that was my only change since buttermilk helps tenderize the chicken. I do let the wings sit after breading them for one hour, covered in the refrigerator. That insures the batter sticks to the outside and doesn't peel off. Yum yum yum, can't go wrong with these and some homemade blue cheese.

These were definitely restaurant quality buffalo tenders!! My kids were surprised they were made at home :-) I also  ran out of the flour mixture, so I'll add about another half portion next time. I also added more Frank's and love the idea of adding honey barbecue sauce next time. Key to this recipe, as stated previously, is dipping and dredging 2x and sitting in the fridge to set !! Will def do these again!

My sons and husband loved this recipe. I was told that this was as good as a restaurant would make and it'll definitely be in the rotation. I was out of garlic powder, so I substituted onion powder and I wound up making 5x the buffalo sauce mix because they wanted the strips to be really saucy and to have some left over for their French fries. I don't eat meat, but it definitely made a quick and easy dinner after a long day, so I was happy.

Awesome recipe!  You can add your own favorite wing sauce if you aren't a fan of the traditional wing sauce. These bake to perfection in about 20 minutes!  I found that a cup of flour was not enough for this recipe so make sure that you make extra.  Yummy!

This recipe is awesome! I briefly put my chicken back into the fryer for a second dip and it really gave the chicken a great extra-crispy crunch. I'm not a big fan of the buffalo flavor (I made this recipe for my fiancee), so I covered half the chicken I made in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead, and it was DELICIOUS. I love this recipe!!

8 19 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/151266/boneless-buffalo-wings/ ...  Shocker: I followed the recipe except of panfrying with half oil, half salted butter!  Without the sauce, it isn't very Buffaloey.  :D  Really, it isn't.  It's good, but not spicy.  After reading reviews, I almost reduced the peppers; so glad I didn't.  My usual balance of heat, for just hotter than mild, is 1/4c flour per 1/2t cayenne.  Next time I'll up the spicy spices.  :)  The sauce was so simple &, surprisingly good.  I tend to put more work in Buffalo sauce & but not this time.  :D  'Got an "I like this chicken" from 16, Girl.  Wow!

I followed the recipe as written.... it was good but not outstanding.  Quite honestly, we liked the leftovers the next day a little better as the flavors really set in.  The positive is that it does not involve a lot of ingredients and makes for a very fast and tasty enough dinner.  However, I wouldn't set out to make it if I had time.

delicious recipe, my family loved it and the ask for it over and over again...
One pratical point: raw batter coated strips may stick to the basket in your deep frier, consider frying them by "free float".

Excellent recipe.  We prefer dark meat and I have tried several recipes to get on board with the healthier breasts and have had mediocre success until this recipe.  Everyone loved it.  Easy and outstanding.

What an excellent recipe!  Made these for a party and everybody loved them.  I did discover that I needed more of the flour blend (2-3x as much) than was suggested in the recipe.  A new personal favorite.

Super easy and tasty. I used boneless breaststroke cut into nuggets and followed the recipe. I cut the time to25 mminutes. They were perfect and stayed moist. A new Super Bowl recipe!

This was an awesome recipe!!  Definitely double your flour mixture, I ran out 1/2 way through the process. Also, do not skip chilling in the refrigerator as this is a important step in achieving  the crispiness of your chicken strips. My whole family couldn't get enough of these. Thank~you for this recipe Bettycook

This was great. We used 1 pound of boneless strips. The only thing I did different was reduce the amount cayenne and added a bit of Splenda, as we like mild sweet and spicy. Will make again.

I just tried this recipe and I have to say I absolutely loved it. The chicken strips came out very crispy and delicious. I would have liked to use more seasoning because without the hot sauce it didn't retain as much flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again! I never leave reviews but this recipe deserves one!

Great recipe. Next time I wouldn't double coat them. I thought the breading  was too thick. Other than that, this is a very delicious recipe.

I love wings, but boyfriend likes boneless, so we tried this recipe.  Frying them was problematic; weren't sure how hot to keep the oil so it smoked up the house.  Sauce was OK, we ended up making our own honey-BBQ for second batch.

It's simply delicious, I'm very satisfied with the results. I excluded the cayenne pepper, and also used my own buffalo sauce and some ranch as a dip.

I have made this recipe for a few years now after having boneless wings from a restaurant near our house.  It is always a hit and everybody wants more!  My son and I love this original recipe but for my husband and daughter who like a milder spicy, I add some Lite Catalina dressing.
It tones down the spiciness and adds a small touch of sweetness!  Many request the wings this way as well.

I baked the chicken & they turned out pretty good.  Doubled the dry ingredients per other reviews.  I didn't have an "omg-these-are-amazing" response, but we ate them all :) I'll make them again.

This recipe was delicious!  It was a total hit at my Super Bowl party.  I made it with Bills Blue Cheese dressing from this site and served it with celery sticks. Didn't change a thing from this recipe... well, actually I doubled the amount of the dry flour mixture due to prior reviews, but I don't think I had to do this since I had a ton left over.  Used three chicken breasts. Used Frank's hot wing sauce.  Was great!

These were fantastic!  I one and a halved the flour mixture and had just enough.  I also tenderized the chicken breast and soaked them in buttermilk in the fridge for about an hour.

Excellent recipe! Deep fried in Peanut Oil in a medium sized pot at 275F. I recommend you make double of both the egg wash and the batter as I ran out very fast (around 1.75 chicken breast).

I made this in a cooking class for school. I have never cooked chicken before but over all I thought this recipe was easy to follow and tasted great. Unfortunately I didn't read any reviews beforehand so half of my chicken was double breaded and the other half wasn't, but I thought it tasted just fine. Great recipe, I will definitely make this again!

These wings were AWESOME.! Only change I made was to use about 2-3 teaspoons of crushed red pepper for that extra kick. I will be using this recipe a lot being that I absolutely LOVE hot wings and got tired of going to restaurants paying for them THANKS SO MUCH.!

Perfect. My husband and I love Buffalo Wild Wings boneless wings but were hoping for a cheaper at home option. This was the ticket! The batter was perfect for those who don't like sauce you could kick up the spices just a little for slightly more dry flavor but with the mango habenero sauce we used the batter was the perfect complement!

5 stars with one caveat:  I DID NOT MAKE THE SAUCE and TRIPLED the FLOUR mix. Otherwise, made exactly as directed. The 'wings,' however, were fantastic.  Even without sauce they were delicious.  We couldn't stop eating them.  Will definitely be making again...and again...and again.  Thanks!

This is another one of those recipes that opens the door for so much more!! We went over the ideas at dinner. Endless!! But these wings are too die for. Literally, hot enough to have to call the fire dept!! God I love that!!

These are by far our favorite wing recipe. I do have a question for you: I want to bring these to a Penn State tailgate and will only have a grill with which to reheat the wings. If I make them in the house the day before, can I reheat them in an aluminum pan on the grill? I would greatly appreciate any suggestions to bring this to our tailgate. Thanks!

I loved it. I had some boneless skinless breast in my freezer for 2 months because we were just tired of nothing new to do with them. This recipe was right on time. The double coating worked and the refrigerator tip was right on time. My daughter wolfed her's down (with ranch dressing see photo) as soon as she got home from school and demanded seconds. Great recipe.

So good! My husband loves Buffalo Wild Wings and he said these were better! Again, like everyone said, definitely double the flour mixture. I didn't have Cayenne or Paprika so I used Chili powder instead. I used Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauce and Honey BBQ sauce and they were great!

These were wicked good. These were so good. We used Frank's Hot sauce which we love and use on everything. We will definitely try them baked. We also used non-gluten flour and it was sick.

This is a favorite in my house. I do end up to having to double the flour and seasoning and I only need about 1/2 cup of milk. I use half Frank's buffalo sauce and half Louisiana hot sauce! Yum.

Fantastic.  I cooked mine in the oven, 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  I've had trouble with the breading falling off, especially with double-breading.  What seems to work best is a light dusting with flour, then egg wash, then heavier flour coating.

Frank's Redhot makes the best sauce!

I just made this recipe last night and it was amazing!  It really does taste like restaurant wings.  My kids even liked this recipe.  I truly believe it is a five star recipe.  I must admit, I don't fry much.  After I took the chicken out of the frying pan and let it cool for a while, the breading would pull away from the chicken.  I was just wondering why this happened?  I made sure the oil was hot before I started to fry.  If someone has an answer to this, I would appreciate it.  All in all, it is a delicious recipe and definitely worth five stars!

Was trying to figure out what to do with a left over chicken breast. This recipe was perfect! It made 4 awesome chicken strips which I ate with BBQ sauce. I sprayed each with Butter Flavored Pam and baked them on a wire cooling rack in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Came our perfect! Next time I will refrigerate for the suggested 20 minutes as a little of the crunchy coating slid off while I was eating them (not that big a deal though) and I may slightly reduce the cayenne if I serve them to guests. Really awesome recipe! So glad I tried this!

Great recipe! Not doubt it is good as is, but I did not have all necessary ingredients so.... I mixed the flour, salt, pepper and instead of all the other spices (which I had only one of sadly) I used a creole seasoning I had which contained all spices needed and then some. So I followed directions accordingly. I did use Cholula original hot sauce (it's an obsession) with the butter. After tossing the sauce and chicken (I also cut mine up into chunks instead of strips because I put them in a salad) I put the chunks on a baking pan and popped them in the oven at 350 for 8 min because I don't like them too saucy. Turned out great with my spring mix salad and ranch dressing. Yum!

Love this recipe!  Like other reviewers, I had to increase the amount of flour during breading, but no big deal.  The flavor is outstanding!  These remind me of the buffalo chicken we get at a favorite local restaurant. I also chose to pour Franks Buffalo sauce on them as a few others did. I will be making this one again!

Very good. Made a double recipe for family of 6 (4 teenage boys). It takes a while because you clean your chicken, then double dip with flour mixture/egg mixture and it gets goopy but well worth it. Will make again - not likely to buy prepared chicken fingers ever again.

I made these for the family and had to quadruple the recipe.  I used only half the cayenne for the kids and had the sauce on the side for the adults.  My kids said it was the best chicken they have ever had.  My daughter said it was her favorite meal ever.  lol  The adults were happy too!  Very, very tasty and super crunchy.  Held up very well to the sauce.  We will make this again for SURE!  Can't wait.  And I will make more next time because we ran out.

I don't normally rate recipes on here but this one is definitely worth rating. These were FANTASTIC!!!!! Putting them in the refrigerator helps them set so that the batter doesn't fall off in the oil. I made the recipe exactly how it said and I wouldn't change anything about it. Thanks for a great recipe.

AMAZINGLY GOOD!!! I love ALL things buffalo and am a VERY picky eater, but these turned out WAY better than I had expected. I try to steer away from frying, I do not fry ANYthing really, but decided to give these a whirl. SOO glad I did! I did alter the recipe a tad, though. You definitely need to double the dry ingredients,which I did (except for the salt!). Also, I didn't have any cayenne, so I substituted that for red pepper flakes. I added a little extra garlic powder as well. I feared these wouldn't turn out crispy enough, so I crushed and added a sleeve of Ritz crackers to the flour mixture which I definitely think helped a lot! I had Texas Pete buffalo wing sauce in the fridge, so I used that instead of the butter/pepper sauce mixture. I guess I altered this a little more than I thought :) My 8 yr old son said they were better than Applebee's boneless wings :) Will definitely make these again !

These. Were. AWESOME!! And the clencher: I made some with flour, and some with Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free Flour, and I could NOT tell the difference!!!!! Both versions tasted as good if not better than Applebees, Friday's, BWW--amazing!! Used Sweet Baby Ray's (gluten free) and needed to double the amounts listed, also doubled the flour mix as so many reviewers said. Thank you SO much!

My husband went to Texas A&M where they have a restaurant called Wings-n-More. By far the best wings I have ever had in my life! (and only at the original place--the franchises just aren't as good to me) Needless to say, I made these knowing it was a tough crowd. They were a hit!! The only change I made was I used thigh cutlets, since we are a dark meat family. I will be making these many more times.

A big hit with even the picky eater of the house.  They weren't too spicy (thought I wish there were a bit more flavor) and were very easy to make.

I used wings, bone in, and broiled them.. turning them twice so they got crispy.

Loved these.  I had always followed the chili's boneless buffalo wing recipe from Top Secret Restaurant Recipes.  These were way better.  I love the idea of not putting the cooked fingers on paper towels.  Putting them on cooling racks made a huge difference.  I always had a problem with the breading falling off but that did not happen when using the cooling rack.  I definitely use more butter than hot sauce because I don't like them that spicy.

I make these all the time now. The best!! I pretty much double the flour and egg mixture. We use Franks hot sauce mixed with butter. I haven't baked them like some others have suggested, so it is quite messy deep frying them.

Excellent recipe..followed other comments and marinated the chicken in buttermilk with cajun seasoning, recipe also on this site. Oh and season the dredge flour with it as well. Baked chicken in oven, 400 degrees for about 35 mins. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

LOVED these.  I did have to make about double the breading to coat them.  Also, next time I may add more cayenne to make them hotter.   I want to make these again, even though I just made them!  Thank you!

It was GREAT!  I did have to use more of the dry mix for all my chicken, but I think I added more chicken as well.  It was like I ordered them.

We ended up making a lot of changes that others suggested. We used chicken tenders and had plenty of flour mixture. We did leave out cayenne as we didn't have any, and we tossed half of the chicken in the sauce afterwards so that our daughter could have some that weren't spicy.

Quick, easy and really tasty. I oven-cooked the coated chicken strips and used Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce. I found this sauce was better when heated with half the amount of butter.

Pretty good recipe.  We did these and also used some Buffalo Wild Wing Sauce to spice up a few and all of them turned out great.  This makes a simple and good set of chicken wings without a lot of work.

We are BIG fans of buffalo wings and have done a similar recipe with boned wings.  I purchased boneless chicken tenderloins to help with the prep work.  I doubled the sauce and added two tablespoons of honey as well to the sauce.  Turned out wonderful!

These are awesome! Tender and good, we did them with hot sauce, barbque and plain...they were all good!  I did have to use more breading than it called for I kept running out, but I was cooking five pounds of chicken, but doubling it was still not enough.  Better than any restaurant.

Very nice indeed!!!  I added more of the garlic powder, paprika and I also added onion powder as well.  This is really a truly yummy dish.  My son, who loves buffalo EVERYTHING has been requesting that I make him a buffalo mac-n-cheese with chicken in it.  It's exactly what I did and I used this chicken to add it to the mac-n-cheese.  To the cheese sauce for the mac and cheese I also added some buffalo sauce.  A definate keeper:)

Even with the awesome reviews I was still thoroughly surprised at how freakin good these turned out. RESTAURANT QUALITY. I did not have cayenne so I subbed a little chili powder. I also used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce. Turned out amazing. This recipe is a no-brainer- I recommend it to everyone!!!

So the battering process was so long and messy that I almost gave up. However I stuck it through, and they were good. I had to double the flour mixture for the batter,  and I made the mistake of using Tabasco--so they were way too hot for me. Don't use Tabasco. To be honest, I'd give them 2 stars, but my husband liked them so I guess that earns them an extra one.

These were great!! I would imagine fried they are even better but I did bake them to make them a little healthier :) I followed the recipe exactly and then baked them at 400 degrees for about 45 min. I used bone in wings because we like those better. I also dipped a few of them in bbq sauce and a few in teriyaki. So yummy!!

I usually make bone-in wings but had 2 chicken breasts and a craving for chicken wings.  Believe it or not, using this method is actually cheaper.  Chicken wings for some reason are so expensive here at the grocery store.  The breasts pounded thin gave me about 20 meaty boneless wings, the perfect amount for us as we had 2 pizzas as well.  So basicallly 3 pounds of wings for what--$4?!  Yah!

This was awesome. I am only reviewing the breading, as I make my own hot sauce. I also used chicken breast tenderloin instead of chicken breasts. Double breading the chicken was the best part to get this breading nice and crispy. I skillet fried this in about 2" of veg oil. I made a hot spicy garlic sauce using Frank's hot sauce, minced garlic cloves, butter, salt, black pepper, and sugar. Will cook this again!

Great flavor and easy to make. These "wings" were a big hit! Like other reviewers, I made two modifications: I baked them instead of frying to reduce the fat, and I had to whip up an extra batch of the flour mixture since there wasn't enough....  Overall, the recipe made a lot more chicken than I expected. Although my husband is not usually a fan of leftovers, he was happy to have these for dinner and lunch the next day. He said they were almost as good as the wings at his favorite restaurant.

AMAZING! My hubby and I are avid boneless wing fans and these were fantastic. I doubled the flour mixture as well and had just enough for the 3 chicken breasts. This is going to be a classic in our house. Next time I will try baking them.
