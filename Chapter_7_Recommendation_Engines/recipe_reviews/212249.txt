This is a great recipe for a simple side dish. I added some fresh garlic to the onions to give it a bit more flavor, and that was nice. It also seems like an easily altered recipe for any additional flavors like meats, cheeses, and/or vegetables.

I was looking for a dairy-free kugel recipe, as I didn't have any of the cottage cheese or cream cheese on hand that most kugel recipes seem to call for, and I came across this.  I think it baked for 5 minutes too long, as the top was a little crispier than I would have liked, so next time I will reduce the cooking time or cover it until the last 5 minutes.  I was afraid it would be dry, so I added an extra egg and 1 T sour cream.  The flavor of the browned onions really shone; I might increase those next time.  Good, simple side dish, and a great way to use up leftover egg noodles!

I used butter instead of oil and that is the only change I made. This came out much better than I had anticipated. The noodles on top get nice and crispy and are delicious. I do recommend using butter for more flavor. Simple and delicious!
