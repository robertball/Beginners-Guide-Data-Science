Really sorry about the frosting. It should read 1/2 cup cream cheese instead of 3/4 cup; I mistyped.

I was so pleased with how these turned out and darned proud to serve them too.  Everything about them was right. At first glance, they're pretty and inviting, just tempting you to pick one up and take a bite. The top of the cupcake has a slight crispiness to it, similar to a pound cake. The cake is moist and full of fresh flavor, tho' I did my best to ensure that by eliminating the lemon zest and adding 1/2 tsp. of strawberry extract. I did use the pudding mix and I swear it makes a difference in terms of moistness (and it's a much cheaper alternative to the cake enhancer King Arthur Flour sells).  I did alter the frosting as I wanted something sweeter and not quite as tangy as I knew only 1/2 cup of powdered sugar would make this.   I also wanted more of it.  So - I used  a full package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. strawberry extract and a tablespoon or two of pureed strawberries which gave it a delicate strawberry flavor and a pretty pink blush.  Rather than garnishing with sliced strawberries I used whole strawberries so they wouldn't bleed into the frosting.  Simply loved 'em - nothing about these not to like, particularly with the modifications I made for extra strawberry flavor.

I hate to give a bad review, but unfortunately these are not cupcakes. They are muffins - dense and bread-y. The strawberry flavour didn't come out at all and I did not end up bringing them to the social function I made them for because they really didn't taste that good. Now I know to give these recipes a trial run first. Sorry.

I love these cupcakes because they are made from real strawberries. The recipe as is, is getting a "3" rating from me. The strawberry flavor was not that strong, the pudding mix made the cupcakes have a weird texture and the cream cheese was too overpowering. The second time I made them I made some modifications and they were a "5"!!!  I increased the amount of strawberry puree, omitted the pudding mix and added more powdered sugar to the icing....delicious!

I loved this recipe! I used sifted cake flour which made the cupcakes lighter. I also added a little bit on strawberry extract to add a stronger strawberry flavor.  The frosting recipe is great, but I would double the recipe.  The amount of frosting yielded from the recipe was not enough to cover the cupcakes.

Very Pretty and Delicious! I followed the directions and cooking instructions to a "T". I used a little more strawberries to make the puree equal the 3/4 cups called for in the recipe. Also, I ended up with 16 cupcakes. Baking time for me was 22 minutes, cooling time was 15 minutes. These are simply lovely with a nice pinkish hue color. I did not add any red food coloring, just let the natural color from strawberries show. I made the frosting using the whole package of cream cheese and added some pureed strawberries. I also thought the specks of the strawberries gave it a nicer appearance. Didn't have enough strawberries to top each of the 16 cupcakes with so next time I will make sure to have extra whole fresh strawberries. This is very FRESH tasting; the cake is absolutely moist. I know the pudding had a lot to do with its moistness, so I am glad that I added it in. Reminded me of a pound cake only better and CUTER in these little cupcakes. The cream cheese is sweetened just right. A sheer delight and wonderful treat this is for dessert. A recipe that I would like to make again. Thank you drewface for sharing!

These are moist and flavorful cupcakes. I'm giving a 4 star rating only because I like my cupcakes a little bit lighter. They're not muffins, but they are heavier than I like my cupcakes to be. Nonetheless, they're very flavorful and good.

These cupcakes are really delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any fresh lemons to zest, so I used lime zest instead.  The strawberry version tasted so wonderful that I tried puree blueberries too and they also came out very tasty and moist.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy because they are a nice treat for pot lucks and family functions.

These were GREAT!!  I used a cup of pureed strawberries and added 2 T sweetened condensed milk to the mix.  We didn't have the pudding mix.  I also added pureed strawberries to the icing.  This recipe is yummy because it doesn't have that weird jello mix taste.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I felt that these didn't have as much strawberry flavor as I originally expected.  Next time I would add double the strawberry.  Skip the food coloring...

These were Fabulous!  The icing was light and just the right amount of sweetness.  I did add about 1/4 cup puree fresh strawberries to the icing.  I have never had a cupcake that called for vanilla pudding mix and I will never make another cupcake without it!  Light, moist and fluffy; my picky family devoured them.

I'm rating the cupcake portion only. I did use the pudding mix.  These are wonderful cupcakes. They are a little more dense than other cupcakes - probably due to the strawberry puree. The flavor is wonderful. I have picky family members who don't like cream cheese frosting, so I made a strawberry buttercream using butter, confectioners' sugar, strawberry puree, and vanilla. I also left some plain for my diabetic husband. They are delicious either way!

I made 2 batches of this.
The first batch I stuck to the recipe - as many reviewers said, they were rather bready and not the best- naturally, since there wasn't any additional liquid added except from the strawberries. 

to put it in a nutshell: good idea, not so good recipe

But, as I was eager to serve some really good cupcakes with strawberries, I made another batch. This time, I changed the recipe a "tad" as follows:

-add 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda
-add 1/2 cup of cream (if you shake the container a bit before adding the cream, you'll get even fluffier results, for a "calorie aware version" add milk or buttermilk instead)
-add 1 teaspoon of strawberry preserves (it will satisfy those who missed the strawberry flavor)
-to not end up with a weirdly brown cupcake because of the strawberry puree, just cut the strawberries into really small pieces   
-when filling the cupcakes, pour about one teaspoon of batter, just so the bottom is coverd and then, place, depending on the size, a quarter or half a strawberry, before filling them up completely. 
This will add additional moisture to the cupcake - and it is a really nice surprise when biting into it



- voilà , happy cupcake consumers !

I love love love this recipe! These cupcakes are delicious! I made them for friends on Valentine's Day. I decided to test it out on my coworkers the week before since I'd never used the recipe before and sometimes things need to be altered. I decided to use more strawberry puree in the batter for the Valentine's batch because I felt like the cupcakes were good the first time, but not strawberry-y enough. I also thought the icing was too cheesey so I used less cream cheese the second time and everything turned out great! I also baked them at 350 instead of 325 because they didn't bake properly at 325.

Very dense, it really is a muffin and not a cupcake. I didn't care for them much but my husband couldn't stop gobbling them down so I'm giving it a 4. Also, I doubled the frosting and added a tablespoon of the puree to it. I didn't remove the seeds and it worked out fine.

loved these. it's so hard to find recipes that are truly from scratch. I didn't add the pudding mix but otherwise followed the recipe & loved the delicate strawberry flavor. Only alteration i made was to put some chopped strawberries in the frosting for some color and added fruit. They were a big hit.

Uber easy!  My little sister-in-law asked for a strawberry cake for her Bday and, realizing i had never seen a recipe for one i stumbled on this recipe.   I skipped out on the food coloring and they were a tinge of pink anyway. I didnt strain the puree b/c my strainer would not have strained most of the seeds.  i added more than 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the frosting because all i could taste was cream cheese and i wanted to make it a bit more thick so that i could pipe it out. i also added some lemon zest to the frosting b/c i just felt like it and was glad i did when i tasted it, thought it added a nice Zing to the frosting. When my sweetheart tasted the batter and i think he re-realized why he loves me.

I dont know why my review didnt get in. I will try again cos it's just very good and i was very pleased with the outcome. I used more strawberries, didnt use the pudding mix nor red coloring and I reduced the confectioners' sugar to 1/3 cup. That's it. They turned out great - our neighbour boy and my son had first tasting and they were jumping up and down with delight! Then we brought a dozen to our potluck party and everyone wanted one! A couple even took one home for tea the next day. Delightful! Thanks DrewFace. Great recipe!

Gorgeous cupcakes (really more of a muffin but who cares) they were lovely and moist.  I didn't have pudding mix and used less sugar but I did add a little strawberry extract as others complained of the lack of strawberry taste.  I made a sour cream icing instead as well, Yummy!

Yes, these are more muffins than cupcakes. HOWEVER, they are still delicious and were a big hit with my family…as in “double batch was gone in under half an hour” good! I made a few changes, based on other reviews. I used cake flour instead of AP, although the resulting product was still not what I would call “light” (more like apple/spice muffins than pound cake, w/ a sticky, not crispy top); I used the pudding mix, so that could be why. For a double batch (~33 cupcakes), I pureed enough strawberries to fill to the 3.5 C mark on my blender, then pushed the puree through a strainer as recommended in the recipe. I didn’t add any food coloring or strawberry flavoring; the cakes were pale grey/pink in color (which didn’t bother me) and had plenty of natural strawberry flavor. I did attempt to inject strawberry “spread” (not jam, which would have been too lumpy) into the cakes after they were cool, though. I was unsure how to convert the frosting recipe (others’ suggestions, double batch, etc.), so I used: (2) 8-oz cream cheese pkgs, (1) stick butter, 2C powdered sugar, & 2 tsp vanilla (clear so it wouldn’t color the frosting). I chopped up and gently stirred in enough strawberries to get a good distribution of flavor and color, then I topped off each cupcake with a slice of strawberry. The result was tasty & adorable. Make sure to keep the frosted cakes as cool as possible, or the frosting will melt! My Easter guests & I really enjoyed these; they’re worth the 5 stars!  :)

These didn't have much flavor. They were moist and very dense.  They weren't awful but no one really loved them.  I will search for another recipe.

Really great recipe FOR THE CUPCAKES. However, the icing was not so good. I followed the cupcake recipe exactly and they were delicious. I tried making the icing as well, but it just wasn't good. I ended up throwing it out and making buttercream icing with strawberry puree added. The cupcakes were for my boss' birthday and he and my co-workers loved them. As a matter of fact, my boss didn't want to share them, instead he offered out a couple and took the rest home to his wife and kids. They were so moist and light. Loved the cupcake recipe, skip on the icing.

I thought these were quite delicious.  However next time I think I need to add more strawberries as they strawberry flavor was not as strong as I would like it to be.  I did follow the recipe exactly.  Also I did not use the frosting but instead used a Champagne Vanilla buttercream frosting.  Tasted like Strawberries and Champagne!

This recipe was good if you were looking for strawberry muffins, but I wouldn't want to serve them as cupcakes. Too dense.

Great recipe! I doubled it and it made 30 cupcakes. I followed the recipe - included the pudding mix. I found that they had a great strawberry flavour! But maybe its because I used very ripe strawberrys :) I did not use the cream cheese icing but instead used a buttercream icing also from this site! It was delish! Definitely would make again!

These came out fantastic. I only made half the batter because these were more of an experiment. I'm the only one who really eats cupcakes in our house. I still could've easily came out with ten cupcakes though.
They are really sweet, so next time I will cut down on the sugar quite a bit, but they taste great!

I made these tonight and had to log in to allrecipes to rate them!  I read others' reviews and made a few changes - used a full cup of strawberry puree and did not strain, did not use the pudding mix or the food coloring.  I also used cake flour and followed the substitution directions, adding 2 tablespoons cake flour for every cup.  This made 16 light and fluffy cupcakes with very good strawberry flavor.  I also used a full brick of cream cheese and I have plenty of frosting left over.  I used my mixer until adding the flour and then I used a wooden spoon to stir the remaining ingredients.  Do not over mix or your cupcakes will not be light and fluffy!!  Great recipe and thanks for sharing!

This is a GREAT cupcake. I made them for my wife's birthday recently, used buttercream frosting with a strawberry on top, and drizzled dark chocolate ganache over. They were a MAJOR hit.

My kids love these summertime cupcakes.  I have also made them with frozen strawberries, and they turn out nice.  I think the addition of the pudding mix makes them very moist and gives that extra flavor.

Gotta agree with Alannah on this one.. if I ate this with my eyes closed I'd only taste a normal (a bit denser than expected) vanilla cupcake with strong cream cheese frosting... cannot taste the strawberry at all!! I added white chocolate chips which helped make the flavor a bit more interesting.. but overall not impressed.

I was disappointed.  They came out like blah tasting muffins vs cupcakes. I read other reviews and others said the same.
i did add the instant pudding which was optional.


i did not make the icing, i made my own.
This review was on the cupcakes themselves.

I was so happy to find a recipe that used real strawberries as the boxed version is yummy but this would most likely be way better.  I was right.  The batter ended up very sticky even after baking, but this may be from the strawberry puree.  With my first bite I didn't taste much strawberry and was disappointed and then it hit me and combined with the cheesecake frosting to make it so amazing!!  I brought them to a party and everyone loved them.  The only weird thing was the frosting..it just wasn't right...  It tasted too salty and like pure cream cheese so I started adding sugar and it ended up decent, but different than canned frosting which was a good thing.

No strawberry flavor to speak of, tasted more like a low sugar white cake. With any flavor icing it is still a moist and tastey cupcake, I just wouldn't call it strawberry.

I loved this recipe! The cream cheese frosting was the best part -- and I'm NOT a frosting gal. I diced some strawberries up into very small peices and sprinkled them on top for a pretty and dainty look.

These were a huge hit with the whole family - me, husband, 6-year old, and 2-year old.  Easy to make too.  I am vegetarian and like that the recipe uses actual strawberries instead of gelatin or something similar.  I doubled the frosting recipe : ). I will make these regularly!

I tried this recipe for the first time last week, following some of the suggestions from other reviews. They turned out very good, everyone was so pleased with them, that I just baked them again for my daughter's BD tomorrow. This time I realized too late I didn't have enough vegetable oil, so I used apple sauce instead... they turned out incredible!! they're amazingly moist, and the flavor improved a great deal. I think I found my new go-to recipe!

The cake was great, but I didn't care for the frosting (it was very thin).  I used cake flour, added 2T heavy whipping cream to the strawberry puree and didn't bother straining the seeds.  Next time to add even more strawberry flavor I will substitute strawberry extract for the vanilla.  I filled the tins 3/4 full and all 15 of them domed nicely.  I do love that this recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of butter; now I can bake delicious strawberry cupcakes whenever I feel like it - whether I have softened butter or not!

We love these.  We added a little more puree to the cake portion and also added some to the frosting.  So good.  I don't usually like strawberry cupcakes (uber chocolate fan), but LOVED these.  This was my first time making cupcakes and these were tasty, moist, and pretty.  We skipped the fresh strawberry on top and added edible pearls instead.  Thank you for a great recipe!

My daughter wanted strawberry cupcakes with strawberry frosting for her 4th birthday and these fit the bill nicely.  I did not modify the cake recipe at all, except to bake some as mini-cupcakes (see below).  For the frosting: To add strawberry flavor, I used about 4 TBL of organic strawberry jam, figuring it would add flavor without making the frosting too runny. The counterpoint between the sweet strawberry flavor and the tart cream cheese made them taste a bit like strawberry cheesecake! Also, I doubled the frosting recipe because I like to pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes and that takes a bit more per cupcake. And I used red paste coloring to make it a cheerful bright pink for my daughter's party. Finally, I topped with "valentine's" nonpareil mix for added fun.  I baked this recipe as 24 mini-cupcakes and had enough batter left for 6 regular size. I baked the minis for 5 minutes, checked and turned the pan, then baked for 5 more. I baked the regular size for about 20 minutes total, as directed.  Everyone really enjoyed them and several people asked for the recipe. They looked super sweet displayed on a mini-cupcake rack that I bought from a local craft store. And mini-cupcakes are really the perfect size for kids...so much easier for them to handle.

These were AWFUL. Like another reviewer said, they tasted like muffins. They were not sweet like a cupcake and were very dense like a muffin. I am glad there was plenty of food at the party I went to so few peopled tried these because when I did I was so embarrassed. I followed recipe exactly except no lemon zest and used applesauce instead of oil.

I have made these twice now and they are simply amazing. Everything about them is perfect. The fresh fruit really adds that special something that you just cant get from a box. They are easy to make and everyone that has tried them loves them.

Strawberry taste of the cake is kind of weak, and the cream cheese taste of the icing is too heavy. Would have also recommended adding red colour to the icing to make it pink.

I ended up using a 9x13 pan for this. I doubled the recipe for the icing and it still wasn't enough and there's no way the measurements are accurate for a dozen cupcakes. I didn't think the cake was anything special or memorable and I couldn't really taste the strawberries. I think the amount of fruit needs to be doubled and icing needs to be tripled and a bit sweeter. ps: I used 1/3 c less sugar.

This was a really good cupcake recipe but the strawberry flavor was more subtle than I would of liked, so I would recommend adding more strawberries. But other than that they were really good. I had mine served with banana frosting which really complemented the strawberries.

I made these with my son today, and they came out very good!  The store did not have nice strawberries, so I used two small containers of fresh raspberries instead, straining out the seeds from the puree.  As some have mentioned, they are more dense than most cupcakes, but I found this to be a plus, not a minus.  Very moist too!

OP stated she mistyped and put 3/4 cup cream cheese for frosting when it should have been 1/2 cup. The 3/4 cup taste delicious to me! I also added red food coloring to both my cupcake and my frosting and it was amazing!

I didn't add the pudding mix, but did use a full cup of puree. I used really fresh and local strawberries, and the cupcakes have a beautifully intense strawberry flavor.  They are a bit more dense than other white cupcakes, but its a trade I'm willing to make! Per someone else's advice, I added 2T cream, so they are very moist.

I really like this recipe! I baked 48 mini cupcakes at 325 for about 10 min. They came out nice and soft and fluffy. I did add a little extra purée as per other reviewers...They have a light strawberry taste and a nice lemony flavor. I did not add any frosting and my 3 yr old loves them!

Great recipe! I used butter instead of oil and I doubled the number of strawberries and it was delicious! I didn't have any pudding but it still was very moist and a hit with my family!
The baking time was more over 35min than 23 for me and the cupcakes deflated a bit when I got them out of the oven but I will definitely make more of them.

This is an amazing recipe.  I have made it several times, both as a cake and as cupcakes, and it has turned out great each time.  The cake itself is moist with a subtle strawberry flavor.  It is super easy to make and hard to mess up.  My kids have requested this cake for their birthdays three years in a row now.  Awesome cake.

Made these and added a lemon cream cheese frosting to the top and they were delish, I made them into 48 mini cupcakes as I like my sweets small and bite size. I added half the vanilla pudding that it asks for as I didnt want to over-sweeten them and they turned out beautiful and moist! nothing beats real strawberries in a cupcake!

I didn't de-seed the strawberries or use the pudding mix/food colouring. I had to use a splash of lemon juice because I didn't have a fresh lemon. Cupcakes were fantastic. I doubled the recipe and got 24 buns plus a small loaf out of it. SO good!

T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E!!!!  My hubby had one and I had a half.  I made 6 Texas sized cupcakes [cannot be bothered with little cupcakes] and they did bake up beautifully in 30 minutes. They were light and airy using the pudding mix. But after those positive points, it was all downhill. I even followed "naples" suggestion of the strawberry extract, which I had on hand, and omitting the zest. And, why does every cupcake recipe have cream cheese in it??? Wish I would have followed my own common sense and made just a simple buttercream/or vanilla icing. All we could taste was cheese....NO STRAWBERRY flavor whatsoever. What a waste! Actually, I doubt there is a strawberry cake/cupcake out there that actually tastes like strawberry. It's a very delicate flavor, not easily duplicated. Then to slather it in cheese flavor...YUK!

I liked this recipe and I have replaced this recipe for the fresh strawberry cake recipe I have had for years that used strawberry gelatin as an ingredient. These are better because it has fresh strawberries as the main ingredient. I am going to use cake flour the next time I make these for a lighter cupcake texture. A great flavor boost that was a hit that I tried was to put in a bit of strawberry daiquiri drink mix into the cream cheese frosting. It gave the frosting a nice flavor boost that was a hit when I served these cupcakes at a family reunion. Great recipe!

Easy to make! Didn't use the vanilla pudding and they came out tasty, moist and a bit dense. Topped them with cool whip and fresh strawberries to bring out the strawberry taste. Might use a whole cup of strawberry puree next time.

These are fantastic! They have a nice crisp outside and a fluffy inside. I added more strawberry, but a little too much so they had to bake for 15 more minutes. However, they were wonderful. I also added chocolate chips and skipped the frosting just to cut back on some of the sugar and fat. But I'm sure the frosting would be great. I will make these with raspberries next time since I have some in the freezer. Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

these looked and tasted very unappealing! the color the strawberries turn the cake after they cook is brown, even with 2 drops of food coloring. The taste is also not right, it just tastes like baking powder, with no strawberry flavor. I made them for a party and was too embarrassed to bring them. Save yourself the time!

This is not the best strawberry cupcake recipe I have tasted. And the icing was a bit to cheesy as supposed to a nice balance between the sugar and cream cheese flavors.

I would rate this with 3 stars, but the rest of my family gave it 5, so I am averaging it with 4.  When I make cupcakes, I am always hoping for a light, moist, fluffy cupcake, and that is not what you get with this recipe.  They are definitely moist, but much denser and heavier that I would have liked.  The frosting is great, but I had to add almost triple the amount of sugar to make it the consistency that I wanted.  My family really enjoyed these, and they were all gone at the end of the weekend.

The cupcakes have a very nice natural coloring, sweetness, and are not too sugary. I followed the recipe exactly but added a few more strawberries. I also followed the frosting exactly and it is very cream cheesy, which I liked a lot.

Great recipe, I made these for my third graders and their Valentine's Day party.  I had to use MUCH more than a drop of red food coloring (more like 10 drops)  to get the batter to become a nice pink color. Also I was going to add the strawberries fresh the next day but I grated some dark chocolate and sprinkled some red sugar over the icing and it looked great!!

It is so nice to find this fresh recipe! I forgot to only use 1/2 cup of cream cheese and used 3/4 cup but the frosting was perfect with the cupcakes.  I also substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat, which made them kind of ugly but they were still delicious!

I'm just not quite sure how to review this one. I took the submitter's suggestion and made this into a cake, following the directions to a 't'. The flavor is wonderful, but this does not make a good cake. It was very much like a dense quick bread and did not look attractive when cut. It was rather grayish in color after baking( I would have used the optional food coloring but the raw batter looked appealing enough). Still, it's just too dense for a cake. Tasters raved over it nonetheless. I would use this recipe the next time I want a strawberry quick bread, but I would not even make 'cupcakes' with this recipe. My review does not include the cream cheese icing as I did not make that.

these were tasty, especially made with fresh-picked strawberries. i only made the cupcakes; too lazy to make icing from scratch when i had a perfectly good can in the cupboard (i know, i know). i also was too lazy to strain the puree; after about 2 minutes of trying it, i just threw it in, seeds and all, and they tasted swell. i also used just over a cup of puree; meant to just put in a cup and save the rest to jazz up the icing, but c'est la vie.

My daughter wanted to make pink cupcakes. This recipe was very easy to do with a preschooler.  BONUS: They are now my husband's favorite cupcake!  We did make a couple of changes...we didn't have enough strawberries on hand so we added some raspberries...we like rose water so we subbed the rose water for the vanilla...instead of the vanilla pudding, we used a tablespoon of vanilla yogurt.  And because I can't get enough chocolate, on half of ours I used a chocolate ganache under a dollop of the cream cheese frosting.

I loved it! I didn't have strawbearrys, and I love lemon, so I used lemon juice instead. I also had a little batter left over, which was great, so I could make 3 more cupcakes! They  turned out to be awesome! I would totally make this again! 
Anybody who lives cupcakes, and strawberrys (or any berry of your choice really) will love these cupcakes!

This recipe is great!! I love the freshness of strawberries being the standout ingredient, so I puréed a whole package of strawberries instead of just 8. Put about a cup of it in the batter. I also added 4tbps of the vanilla pudding mix, instead of the 3 called out in the recipe. Besides those two deviations, I followed the recipe and they turned out delicious! However, I did not use the icing recipe. Instead I made a champagne buttercream icing and included the rest of the strawberry purée. Who doesn’t like strawberries and champagne?!

The cupcakes were delicious and moist. I got a ton of compliments at my son’s birthday party (from adults and kids alike)! I did use the optional vanilla pudding mix, and made the recipe as written.

Great recipe. I would avoid using the pudding mixture though. The cupcake becomes a lot more dense once you add that in. 

I hear freezing strawberries prior to turning them into a puree helps with the coloring!

Tastes good but not enough strawberry flavor. next time I'd add strawberry extract or syrup, and needs more red food coloring to keep pink color after baking. Will try again!

It didn't taste bad, but certainly not as good as I wanted. I was generous with the strawberry purée based on other reviews, however I agree that it was more the texture of a muffin, and even with the extra strawberries I still found it lacking something. I did double the icing, but I've definitely had better. I was looking for a recipe to use up the strawberries and cream cheese I had in my fridge, and this was the one I found that I had all the ingredients to make. I should've held off and got what I needed for a different recipe.

I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and frosted them with a vanilla buttercream icing with grated dark chocolate on top. They were delicious and such a hit! I can't wait to make these again in the spring with fresh strawberries!

I left out the pudding and lemon zest and used 1 cup of stewed strawberries. Added 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips to one batch for an extra sweet. Cooking time at 325 was closer to 40 minutes

Very good!  I made this for my daughter's first birthday.  I thought it was a pretty good "happy medium" between the very, very sugary typical birthday cakes and the healthier sugar free cakes.  It was delicious and I didn't feel like I was over-doing the sugar for my kids.  I also did not add the optional vanilla pudding and food coloring - and I'm glad, it was great without them!

Fantastic recipe. I agree with needing more strawberries. I read the other reviews and I used 10 strawberries and it was perfect. I also added pink food coloring to the icing. I like bold flavors so I used more lemon zest than what was called for. The flavor was amazing.

I made this recipe because it had quite a few good reviews AND because it said that it also made a great cake. I was VERY disappointed. Even before baking the flavor was very bland and I had to add a ton of food coloring to make it even pink. I doubled the recipe in order to make 2 9x13 in cakes. the batter did not fill 1 of those pans.

This one is a great 'base' recipe, but I made changes, for sure. I've never found a from-scratch strawberry cake recipe that didn't feel/taste like paste or need artificial scents/colors added -this one included. In the end, I swapped out half the flour for freshly ground oats. Yes, it felt & chewed more like a muffin, but when I doubled the amount of strawberries, it had a natural hue, scent and flavor!  This is my new go-to strawberry cake recipe. (No pudding, no food coloring-might as well buy a box mix if you're going to add these things hey?).

I made it just like the recipe said. My family love them. I will make them again. I think next time I will put in some strawberry flavoring  in the cake mix. To bring out more strawberry flavor.

It's was pretty good. It had a mild strawberry flavor and I added 1 cup of purée. I would add a bit of strawberry extract next time. I agree with some of the other reviewers who said it was dense, more like a muffin or pound cake. I didn't use the instant pudding or the food coloring. I used plain white frosting instead and it was good that way.

On their own they were a bit dry and dense, the previous muffin comparison was right on.  I served these topped with my own cream cheese/strawberry jam icing which did the trick!

I am going to make these for my daughters first birthday. The first time i made these the recipe made 16 cupcakes. contrary to some other reviews, i found the cake to be light and fluffy and not at all like a muffin or pound cake.

These were a hit at my niece's wedding.  People were raving about their light texture and fresh strawberry flavor.  I keep receiving requests to bring them to other events.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe

These are fantastic. I didn't have any pudding mix so I skipped this but I added extra strawberries, probably about a cup and they moistened the batter. I didn't use food coloring and they still came out pink. We used a full block of cream cheese to the frosting so it didn't come out as sweet. Just a personal preference.

I agree with another reviewer, these are muffins. Not bad muffins, but muffins because of how dense. The icing I saw the poster corrected was supposed to be 1/2 cup cream cheese, I saw that after my attempt. Just added more other ingredients to balance and had too much icing. Still strawberries and cream cheese are great together.

These cup cakes are very dense and taste more like a muffin (a bland muffin) then cake.  I did a test run before making them for my daughters birthday party and good thing I did because I will not be using this recipe. Sorry but not so good :(

These are good muffins, terrible cupcakes.They come out dense and filling, I used chocolate frosting, hoping to get a chocolate covered strawberry taste and it didnt work out. I will make these again for breakfast without frosting and add in more strawberries. I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh it worked well but it needed more strawberry.

I was really hoping for these to be my perfect strawberry cupcakes, but the other reviewers were right....these are more like muffins. I was disappointed. Nothing light and fluffy about these at all!

These are really great cupcakes! I've made them multiple times for various occasions. They are always well received! My kids frequently request them for birthdays. In the spring we have fresh strawberries straight from our garden. Using ripe, sweet strawberries is key to getting that great strawberry flavor.

These were the BEST cupcakes I have ever made. I didn't have any lemon zest , and I made them without icing due to lack of ingredients at the time, but I will def. add them the next time I make them! I ended up substituting the oil with apple sauce, and all I had was white chocolate pudding mix, but it still resulted in the yummiest ( and very moist) cupcakes ever! I also threw in some coconut and b/c i didn't have icing, I put on a few shaved almonds! These are so adorable and yummy!

The cake comes out a little dense, like muffins or zucchini bread, so be sure to put the amount specified in the cups.   I skimped a bit, and some of my cupcakes didn't reach the tops of their liners.  For the frosting, I used 1/2 cup cream cheese, the butter and vanilla, another cup or so of confectioners sugar, and some mashed strawberries.   A very good use for fresh strawberries, and I might try this with frozen strawberries this winter.

I gave it 4 stars because I changed it a bit, I didnt use the cream cheese icing.  I used some of the strawberry puree and mixed it with confectioners sugar and some strawberry extract.  It turned out really well!  I think next time I will make it into a regular cake instead of cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing :)

Cake was good, but cream cheese is too heavy like someone else said. If I made them again, I'd use a light frosting.
