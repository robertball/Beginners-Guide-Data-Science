I made this 1 other time before and followed the recipe to a T. It was very good and the proportions are very balanced. This time I made sure to cut the celery and carrot pieces smaller than the onion so that they are all done at the same time. I also substituted some half-and-half for the chicken broth (1/4 of the portion) just to give it some richness and color. I added about 3/4 tbsp. of poultry seasoning and a dash of cayenne. I used frozen peas instead of canned and did not bake the biscuits with the casserole. I used frozen buttermilk biscuits and poured the mixture on top. I love the way that the biscuit melts when the sauce is poured on it. This time it came out DIVINE.

This is a staple wintertime recipe.  Also, hate to say it, but I've made it both with chicken broth and then with 4 bouillon cubes + 4 cups water.  Now I like to go "fresh" when I can, but it was much blander with the chick. broth.  Tastes considerably better with the bouillon cubes; either way, it's an excellent recipe, and nice to see a casserole without a can of soup in it, and also with so many fresh veggies.

UPDATE: Try this recipe with mashed potoatoes on top in lieu of the biscuits called for (i.e. like a chicken shepherd's pie).  I got this idea from Rachel Ray.  All in all, I prefer this better as is (i.e. with a biscuit crust), but had to give it a try...  This is an excellent recipe!!!  My friend who has the "favorites" cookbook recommended it to me (it's in the original paperback).  I do not like the "crust" part of pot pies, but I love the filling, so this recipe is perfect for me! The biscuits are just yummy!  I made this casserole for my parents and they loved it too!  I added some fresh mushrooms, pearl onions and a little cookig sherry (you could also use white wine...) to make it extra special :) I made more than 8 biscuits (8 didn't seem to be enough to cover the entire 9x13 pan) and didn't flatten them as the recipe directed (I just spooned heaping mounds of biscuit mix onto the filling). This dish pairs nicely with a tossed salad.  I'll definitely make this again. It's a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!!

Great recipe--I would use a little less black pepper, and I used Bisquick baking mix with 2/3 cup buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Bought a whole roasted chicken and used that for the 4 cups of chicken meat.  Oh yes, you must use frozen peas instead of canned, big difference.  Enjoy!

I made the chicken mixture according to the recipe, except I added a little poultry seasoning.  It was very good but next time I make this I'll use frozen peas instead of canned.  Some other reviews had mentioned there needed to be more biscuits so I used 3 cups Bisquit, 2 cups milk and two teaspoons basil. It made 12 good sized biscuits that covered the whole pan.  I didn't roll them as the recipe stated, I just did drop biscuits.  This was very good and will definately be made again. However, we had leftover since there's only two of us and the leftovers were not great, the biscuits soaked up the broth and it was just kinda dry, so I would suggest cutting the recipe in half, using a 9x9 inch pan if you're only making it for two people.

Bummer! How did everyone rate this 5 stars? Maybe I missed something, because I thought that this recipe was not so great. Maybe the basil biscuits didn't suit my taste. If you make this recipe I would recommend using prepared biscuits and not attemting the sticky mess... the end result was not worth the effort. SORRY! :(

Soooooo very good! I didn't add the celery, but I did add corn and potatoes (that I cooked in the microwave first). I also used 4 chicken stock cubes and 4 cups of water instead of the chicken broth. I didn't roll or flatten the biscuits with my hands as the instructions stated to do. I realized that my biscuit mix was much too sticky to mess with so instead I just spooned 6 "blops" of the mix onto the chicken mixture. Then I cooked the whole thing in a round casserole dish instead of the 9 X 13 inch baking dish.

I was really surprised by this. I've made similar dishes which usually turn out pretty bland but since this had such good ratings I thought I'd try it.  It's really good! The basil is a great touch just make sure to follow the recipe and not put in too much. I can easily tell how it could be overpowering and ruin the dish if you add too much. I'd suggest changing the veggie mix a little by adding mushrooms, more onions, a few diced potatoes and green beans would be nice and cut down on the peas.

This is a good recipe!I left out the celery. I added extra onion and more peas. The basil is a must! It really make the sauce! I floured the biscuits in a small bowl instead of on wax paper...less mess!I didn't cover it the last 10 min. either. I will probably 1/2 the recipe next time, it makes alot.Perfect for a big family!

OMG,these are so awesome!  I just served them for dinner and there's absolutely no leftovers.  Everyone went for seconds and kept on raving about how great it was.  I did however tweaked the recipe to our liking.  I didn't use chicken broth,  flour, sugar, basil or milk.  I used two cans of cream of chicken soup, added 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary and 1 tablespoon of cilantro.  I also didn't make my own biscuits, just used the canned stuff.  I did however overcooked it a bit.  I suggest not to follow the cooking time in the oven and watch it carefully (my mistake, but it turned out great still).  Now that there's no leftovers, I need to make something else for the others who aren't home...=/

I had no peas, so I used frozen shelled edamame - delicious!  As far as leftovers, I used the same technique as I use with leftover matzoh ball soup, that is, to remove the biscuits from the leftover casserole and store them separately, then reunite them with the casserole when it's time to reheat for another meal.  I will be making this often!

I would give this seven stars. wow, so easy and so delicious. I agree with the frozen peas over canned and chopping the carrots smaller to cook evenly with onions. I didn't have celery, so I just subbed in more onion- I had lots of small sweet onions on hand, tasted great, not bland at all. I also used chopped fresh basil, but maybe with fresh you have to add more, because I barely noticed it, and I love basil. Also, I didn't use baking mix, but opted for the E-Z drop biscuit recipe from this site, and carefully spooned it onto the filling-nearly covered whole whole pan. It really filled up my 9x13 pan, to the brim, I was worried the biscuits would make it overflow, but only a little bubbled out. Definitely halve if made for two or three.  We had friends for lunch (the main meal in Spain), and still had leftovers for dinner for everyone (me, hubby, two kids-1&3)
This was delicious, and so easy, especially with my Thermomix (wedding present) to do all the chopping and stirring and boiling of the filling for me.  The biscuits did not soak up anymore filling in the tupper, they got chicken and veggies stuck to them, which seemed to act as a slight barrier.  I really cannot say enough good things about this recipe. And so glad it just uses chicken broth, not cream of anything- they don't have Campbells in Spain yet.

Having been through culinary school, I can appreciate a really simple, yet delicious recipe/dish.  With that said, I have made this numerous times and have even subbed out a delicious beef and beef stock for the chicken and the outcome is just as delicious!  This is the epitomy of downright, in the pit of your soul comfort food! Definitely worth the effort!

I just made this for the 1st time tonight and followed the recipe exact (except cut in half because it's just my husband and I) and like many others I used frozen peas. I made it in a 11x7 pan but kept the same amount of biscuit topping to make sure I covered the entire top. Oh, I also used buttermilk in the biscuits instead of regular milk because I think they taste awesome that way! Overall, I loved the recipe but I think it was a bit bland so I will add more seasoning next time, probably poultry seasoning would be great! One more thing, it's wonderful making a "casserole" type recipe without having to use cans of soup (and all the sodium and additives and garbage that come along with it!).

I'll make again.  Not way exciting, but very good.
Seemed to taste even better after refrigerated a few days.

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I changed was omitting the butter and used whole chicken breasts and cooked it in the crock pot!  I made the biscuits a head of time so dinner was all ready when we got home and I just poured the chicken and veggies over the biscuits. I shredded the chicken as I served it. It was fantastic!

This was so good! Even better than I expected. I subbed frozen peas for canned, and since I don't like biscuit mix I used the recipe for Miss Betty's Super Quick Dinner Rolls from this site and doubled it (I forgot to add the basil). After 35 minutes the top was puffy but not browned so I turned the broiler on for two minutes. Boyfriend loved it and it was so easy! Thanks!

I make this delicious recipe often.  I add whatever veggies I have on hand depending on my mood: green beans, peas, carrot,s, potatos, etc.  I use canned biscuits to save time and I'm not a fan of making biscuits or dough.  I usually use 2 cups chicken broth and a can or two of cream of chicken soup to make it not so runny.

this is a good base to start with, i love lots of flavor and i knew this would be bland so i added to it like others have. first, i did sautee the onions, garlic and celery until softened then i added 3/4 bag of frozen mixed vegies. i added poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, cayenne and italian spices to taste. as others recommended i too used canned biscuits. you may want to cook them a bit (not completely) first according to directions then add them to the casserole towards the end of cooking. i didn't want to cook them entirely independently, because i really wanted the biscuits to suck up more flavor and juices from the casserole. a good recipe it does need more flavor, basil alone just isn't enough.

This recipe was wonderful, very tasty and hardy. I would have to agree with a few other reviewers comments about rating a recipe when all you do is change the ingredients....... while I readily agree everyone has their own taste,... then submit your own recipe. Just saying  :-)

Many have said that the taste of this dish was bland.  This might help.  I did not have dried basil, so I used an Italian blend (basil, rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano).  It was amazing and I cannot imagine the taste with just basil.  The sage and rosemary added a wonderful flavor, especially.  I probably will use canned biscuits next time - my biscuits were not "bisquity" tasting enough.  Great recipe overall.

UPDATE: i tried using better biscuits (last time i used the cheap ones, store brand) i used Grands biscuits this time. I took A LOT longer to cook, 45 minutes or so and i had to flip the biscuits over so the other side got cooked. the outside of the biscuit was beautiful but the inside was a little doughy. I MUST think of a solution because the flavor of this dish is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! i just love this dish.......9*11*11 This is OMG delicious! I used frozen mixed veggies (green beans, lima beans, peas, and cubed carrots) and for the top, i used refrigerated biscuits! it was ready in about 30 minutes....super simple and delicious! I thought the tsp of sugar would make this too sweet but it was perfect. loved it

Great basic recipe, but in good conscience I could never serve my family canned peas!  I used chicken stock instead of broth, chopped the celery and carrot smaller, and have tried using double the biscuits, and garlic/chive mashed potatoes instead .  The mashed potatoes win, hands down.

absolutely love this recipe! it is a perfect quick fix for comfort food when you don't have time to make a chicken pot pie. The only thing i change is adding a cup of canned corn, and making my own biscuits instead of using the mix. JPs Big Daddy Biscuit from this recipe are perfect for the crust!

This recipe took a bit of prep time but was worth it!  It had great flavor as is (even with the canned peas) and it was perfect to reheat for a lunch!  I thought the biscuits would dry out in the refrigerator but they were still just as soft when warmed up as when it came out of the oven!  Perfecto!

What a wonderful way to use up that roasted chicken leftovers! I wanted a good tasting recipe without the condensed soup and this was just the ticket. I also looked up a recipe for the buttermilk baking mix and found "Biscuit Baking Mix" by Tami Christman (also at allrecipes.com) Together they were a thumbs up from even my picky teenage boys. And...I had everything on hand and saved a trip to the grocery store.

This was very yummy.  I only made a half batch and used some premade rolls and frozen veggies that I had and it turned out great.  I will definately do this one again.

I do a much easier and quicker version of this using canned veggies-drained, 1 can each: sweet peas, coined carrots and mixed veggies ("Veg-All" type, the ones with the limas in it not the ones with potatoes), 1 large can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 a bag of frozen cubed hashbrown potatoes. Top it  with refrigerated canned biscuits (the "grands"-style, the buttery flaky ones work well) and all you need to do is cook it long enough to brown the biscuits in the oven! I even start with raw chicken and brown it with the onions and celery (and hash browns) and it still only takes 30 minutes start to finish! it is delicious! And I use sage or poultry seasoning rather than basil-no need for salt. (LOL I rate mine 5 stars...)

I made this as written except substituted boullion for broth and corn for the peas. It was good, my husband said he could eat it everyday. But my only thing is that I think baking it all together is pointless. I think the sauce could just be made on the stove, then biscuits in the oven and then sauce just poured over the biscuits. It would save the step of putting it all in a baking dish and baking it. I hate washing those big casserole dishes.

We loved this!  First-I halved the recipe and did in a square Pyrex instead-fed me and my 2 sons with 1 portion left over (and I had quite a large portion the first day it was so yummy).  I decided to do frozen peas instead of canned (YUCK!) and also decided to add broccoli-I got fresh and cut it up really small.  I got my boys to at least try their veggies (15 months and 4 years) and it turned out really yummy.  I made homemade Bisquick-followed the recipe from the book Make a Mix and highly recommend the homemade mix.  The only down side is that you have a dirty sauce pan and a dirty pan you bake it in-I like meals that only create 1 dirty dish (plus what we eat on).  It was worth the extra dishes though.  Highly recommend adding the broccoli too-maybe even some cheese.

We loved this casserole!  One key ingredient is the chicken broth.  I make my own hearty broth, and it adds a lot of flavor to this dish (see my review for broth).  Also sauteed lots of fresh mushrooms along with the onion/celery, added about 1/3 C. good-quality dry sherry (not cooking sherry), and frozen mixed vegetables rather than canned.  I added 5 C. broth, and that was perfect for the plump biscuits (I made enough for 2 extra biscuits).  I'll delight my family and make this again.

Doubled all the veggies and added frozen corn and frozen peas. Also added Italian seasoning and a tiny bit of milk. I didn't attempt to fool around with the sticky dough, I just dropped dollops on the chicken mixture. Very good I must say.

Good comfort food staple and I like that it's not made with a can of soup.  I used a can of buttermilk biscuits, a whole roasted chicken, and my can of peas had mushrooms and onions.  Next time would probably reduce the basil or leave it out altogether.  Next time will try the biscuits on the bottom as others suggested.

This recipe is so good!  We all loved it.  I did add more veggies to it and increased the gravy by half, and used Herbs de Provence instead of basil in the mixture.  The addition of basil to the biscuit mixture was a great idea.  Will definitely be making again.

If you really want to gild the lily on this recipe, sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the biscuits before baking.

Absolutely incredible recipe.  The true critics of my household (the kids) gave this dish a passing grade.  I do agree with previous reviews that there is too much pepper as is.  I will reduce to about 1/2 the pepper next time.  I also used cubes and water in place of broth and refridgerated biscuits but only because it's what I had on hand.  The biscuits were the big kind (Grands) so I opened the biscuits and served like biscuits and gravy.  I didn't combine the biscuits and chicken mixture until plating because I was worried about the biscuits getting soggy.

Absolutely delicious! Didnt have celery on hand so I used celery salt in place of regular salt. Instead of doing anything in a skillet I put all ingredients except biscuits into the crock pot for about 6 hrs. My chicken was raw and frozen when I started. After the 6 hrs I put everything in a baking dish and added refrigerated biscuits on top and cooked for the 30 mins suggested. I forgot to use foil so some of the biscuit wasnt completely cooked and had to stay in longer but next time I will remember the foil

Great recipe! I halved everything but the veggies, and it was perfect for two. Left out the peas, and added about 1/4cup of milk, as I was a little short on broth. It was very flavorful, and loved the fact there were no canned products.

This was good but not as amazing as I was expecting. The basil flavor was very overwhelming. The addition of poultry spices as well as rosemary helped a little to create a larger array of flavors. Also, it was way too salty. I would cut down the salt by half. I don't think I will be doing this recipe again.

Very good.  I found that I needed a little more umph to the chicken/veggie mixture so I added some additional seasonings.  I will probably also add some additional seasonings to the biscuit mixture as well next time.

A good recipe that I did modify a bit.  In preparing the 2nd step of the recipe, I cooked off the vegetables in the butter. In a separate bowl I mixed the flour, salt, pepper, basil and a teaspoon of Thyme, omitting the sugar.  I then tossed the diced uncooked chicken in the flour mixture, added to the cooking vegetables and cooked together for approximately five minutes.  I've found that this keeps the chicken tender and mingles the flavors nicely.  Add in the broth with a Tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of Tabasco.  Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and added in a cup of sliced white mushrooms and the canned peas.  I doubled the biscuits for the size of the pan and to keep my wife from stealing mine.   A good dish that was enjoyed by the whole family.

I know this is good since I have made a similar dish, my only suggestion would be to use frozen peas or mixed vegtables, eliminate or lower salt, you get salt in the biscuit mix, canned ingredients add unnecessary salt to our diet.

I read through the reviews.  I thickened the chicken mixture, used frozen mixed veggies, added milk, poultry seasoning and a little pepper.  I made the biscuits with buttermilk and I would compare this with a chicken and dumplins recipe.  Just like others have said, the biscuits are not biscuity-more like dumplins Overall, it was a feel-good recipe.

Made exactly as written, except used Smart Balance Light in place of the butter and my own biscuit recipe for the topping (plus the basil, which was a nice addition).  It was good, but not earth-shattering.  Also, my husband and I both felt that this did NOT make 6 servings, at least where the meat and veggies were concerned.  The next time I make this, I will double the chicken/veggie mixture, cut my biscuit recipe in half and make 4 servings instead of 6.

This is a delicious dish.  I used a can of packaged biscuits rather than making my own which worked out fine.  It's one of those very comforting meals.

I was looking for a casserole that didn't need milk or cream of whatever soup!  This is wonderful, hearty comfort food!  I make it with "Simon and Garfunkel" chicken (skinless, boneless chicken breast coated in olive oil, sprinkled with parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme and baked for 30-35 mins in 350 oven).  I use parsley in place of the basil so as not to have too many competing spices. This is very tasty with the biscuits but is also good with noodles or just plain white rice.

This came out pretty well, I love basil and think I went a bit heavy on it which threw the flavor off the first time. I made my own bisuits (DO IT!) and it is a warm, satisfying meal for a chilly evening. Nothing over the top though.

A recipe that seems to please everyone. To make it easier, I just use frozen mixed veggies (pre-cooked in microwave) placed frozen bisquits (thawed slightly) on top instead. Will make again & again. Thank you for such a great recipe!

Sorry...I hate to go against the other reviews but my family and I thought that this was just not good. It tasted a bit like one of canned boxed dinners. It wasn't exactly inedible but my husband requested I not make it again and I would agree.

This is real comfort food.  I used thyme instead of basil and next time I will use a little less garlic.  I just dropped the biscuit dough on top and spread it slightly with a spatula.  Came out great.  This will be perfect for the next snowstorm.

This recipe was  very easy to make and delicious. Obviously, not everyone will have the same spice and/or vegetable preferences, but it's so easy to use this basic recipe and swap out the specifics to suit your family's tastes.  For my family, I went a little easy on the basil and added our favorite poultry seasoning.  Just be sure to taste the chicken mixture before you pour it into the prepared baking dish.  If it needs a little more flavor, add whatever suits you. Since I am gluten free, I used my own GF allpurpose flour in the chicken mixture, and gluten free cheddar biscuts (the recipe is on the Betty Crocker website.)  It was ready to take from the oven after the initial 30 minutes.  That may vary depending on the biscuits you choose to use.  Our biscuits were done to perfection w/o the additional ten minutes of bake time.

Didn't change much other than adding more peas and added half & half (1 cup) and 3 cups of broth. It was FANTASTIC! For those people who want to change the entire recipe, why don't you come up with your own unique recipe instead shredding up others.

I'd recommend upping the spices a bit for more flavor or using bullion cubes instead of broth but otherwise, this is a really easy way to use up chicken you've already cooked.

This was an excellent way to use up my leftover turkey and would work great with leftover chicken as well. I only made a couple minor changes: per previous reviewers advice, I used 3 cps chicken broth and 1 cup half-and-half. I left out the salt, enough in the chicken broth. I used Bisquik and milk I soured (put 1 Tpsb vinegar or lemon juice in a measuring cup, fill to the one cup line with milk. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, will look curdled, stir and use desired amount. This is a substitute for buttermilk). I just did drop biscuits on top of the chicken mixture. Canned peas tasted fine but are not as fresh looking as frozen. Everyone ate it up. Next time, I will use double the veggies and less chicken. Great recipe, thanks!

The flavor was great!  I used all the ingredients listed but just finished it differently.  Instead of baking with the biscuits in the oven, I just let it simmer lightly on the stove after putting the chicken in and baked the biscuits separately.  YUM!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe and much to my disappointment, I couldn't find any chicken in the freezer. So I made it with leftover cut up tri-tip steaks and beef broth. I also didn't have peas so I threw in a couple cups of chopped, steamed broccoli. I made the biscuits from scratch and mixed in a little basil for flavor and this is really a good recipe. It was kind of like beef stew with delicious biscuits on top. I will definitely make this again and I can't wait to try with chicken. I used the exact measurements but next time I might try baking the casserole in a smaller pan because it did feel like the sauce got a little lost spread out in the 9x13. Over all a great recipe though.

I used Gluten Free Busquick mix to make the busquits following the instructions on the box. I formed patties of the mix and baked as instructed on this recipe. It came out fantastic and my non gluten free guests could not tell the difference.

I was looking for a way to use left-over roast beef, and this one hit is out of the park.  I used the drippings from the roast and beer in place of the chicken broth, added mushrooms to the veggie saute, and also doubled the biscuit quantity.  I dropped the biscuits on top, as others had.  It got rave reviews at the pot-luck.

This was excellent! Every weekend I cook something for my friends, who are very picky eaters, and every single one of them loved it! I was going to just use frozen biscuits (since I had some already), but I decided not to, and I'm so glad I followed the recipe since that really made the dish.

Everybody in my family liked this recipe. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot in the morning with a couple stems of rosemary and a couple cloves of garlic and 2 cups of water to give it a little bit of flavor. I took the ideas of a couple other reviews and replaced 1/2 cup of the chicken broth with 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup sherry. I used the broth from the cooked chicken. I didn't have any biscut mix so I used refrigerated buttermild biscuts instead which my family prefers anyway. Makes a nice comfort meal on a cold winter day.

This recipe is AWESOME!! Fast, simple, comforting and just plain good!! The whole family plus lots of teenage boys devoured it in no time flat.... there were definitely no leftovers! I used chicken stock instead of broth as I think it has a richer flavor, as well as frozen peas, and I was short on time, so instead of making my own biscuits, I just used some store bought ones from a can and rolled them in basil and then topped the casserole -and it was incredible!! Thanks for such a great recipe - it will definitely be in my Go To File!!

I thought this dish was just what I needed on a cold rainy day. However my husband was not that thrilled with it. The only change I made was that I used grands buttermilk bisquits and baked them for a couple minutes so the bottoms would get done then stuck them on top of cassarole.

I made this with leftover turkey. Added sage and rosemary. Since I had about 1/2 the meat, I halved most of the ingredients, but used about 3 cups broth to 1/4 c flour. Made buttermilk biscuits from scratch, and my husband liked it so much, I didn't have enough leftover for a second meal. A definite keeper for holiday leftovers.

This is a great starter recipe!  You can add spices that your family loves to make it even better.  I didn't have time to make the biscuits so I used Grands.  I added Maggi Seasoning, poultry seasoning, thyme and extra basil to the gravy.  My family loved it!  Thanks CVernSmith!

I just made this and followed the recipe exactly. It was so good we couldn't stop eating it. Even my picky daughter said it was yummy. I will be making this often this winter.

We thought this recipe was very good, however a little too much basil for us.  I will definitely make again, but next time I will leave the basil out of the bisquit mix and try adding a little parmesan instead.  I will also make more of the broth/gravy so it's more like bisquits and gravy and not as dry.  Great flavor though, thanks!

This is sooooo good. I added mushrooms and used canned biscuits, otherwise I followed the recipe. My family loved it and I will certainly make this again.

Definitely use canned biscuits, I prepared it as written and none of my family cared for the bland, hard biscuits. I also added 1 can of cream of chicken to the broth, made it a bit creamier and lessened the pepper, you only need about a 1/4 tsp or less.

Delicious!  I used canned biscuits, buttered on top with basil sprinkled over them.  I also added green beans, mushrooms and some seasoned salt.  That's just my taste though.  My only negative comment is that I thought the sauce was a little thin.  Next time I would add just a little more flour to thicken it up.  That could be my fault because of the extra juice from the added veggies... But overall it was very good and I got rave reviews!

THIS BY FAR THE BEST, FEED 6 & NO LEFTOVERS. I DID DO IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT. 1st I CUT UP THE CHICKEN, THEN FLOURED IT. NEXT I PUT IN A PAN EVOO & BUTTER, AND COOKED THE CHICKEN 15min., THEN ADDED 3 CANES OF CREAM OF CHICKEN, 1/2 CUP HEAVY CREAM, THEN 1 BAG MIX VEGGIES, AND COOK 5 MORE MIN. PLACED INTO A 9X13 DISH, COVERED IT WITH HOME MADE MASHED PATATOS, AND BAKED IT FOR 1/2 HOUR. VERY SIMPLE.

Nice flavor. Family enjoyed.  It didn't thicken up the way I had hoped but I will add more flour or cornstarch next time.  I did follow the recipe exactly except I topped it with mashed potatoes instead of biscuits.  Very nice winter meal.  Will make again, thanks!

just made it for the first time tonight. It was easy to prepare.  The ingredients are staples I have in my kitchen which it very nice. I made more biscuits because I was worried 8 wouldn't be enough- which I will not do next time, it soaked up the liquid- and were a bit dry. 8 is enough!  I added more chicken and corn.  It smelled amazing as it was cooking. The colors and textures were lovely. It would be wonderful with many different kinds of veggies.  yum.

I read many of the reviews and got a kick out of the range - "loved it" to "would never make it again".  As a cook, I enjoy tinkering with a recipe.  Rarely do I follow the exact list or amount in a recipe (with the exception of deserts, which demand precision).  This casserole dish was an excellent base.  It gave me a starting point which I might not have thought of on my own.  I boosted the onion and garlic to my family's taste, added fresh parsley and cilantro to the soup base, used frozen peas and corn, added thyme and rosemary while cutting the basil.  It worked!  My picky wife and daughter enjoyed it and I had seconds.  Preparation is a bit more than 30 minutes. Start to finish took 90 minutes.

I, like Brook, subbed Miss Betty's Super Quick Dinner Rolls in place of the biscuit mix. I don't like sweet tasting meals so I omitted the sugar and the carrots and added some fresh sliced mushrooms.

Don't miss out on trying this recipe. So delicious!! The first time I made it, I cooked it on top of the stove in a large deep skillet. It worked just fine, but the next day, the "soup" had soaked into the biscuit portion and I had to make more soup to pour on top of the biscuits. But it stilled turned out great. The second time I made it, I skipped making the biscuit portion and just put gnocchi in the "soup" portion, and it turned out as a wonderful stew. When my daughter makes it, she makes the biscuits separately, puts a biscuit into a serving bowl and pours the soup right over top. Still turns out great. My husband and I love this!!

This was lovely, I would certainly make it again. It is time consuming, so don't come home at 6pm from work and want to eat by 7, not going to happen.
I was having a bit of prob getting the flour to thicken and it lumped up, but a whisk sorted it right out. 
The only change I would make  next time would be to eliminate the sugar as I could taste it and it isn't necessary. I didn't have canned peas so used frozen mixed carrots and peas, was lovely. I also didn't have buttermilk mix, so used regular bisquick and was great. Enough to make 2 meals for 2 people.

I have also used left over beef for this recipe and it is just as good as the chicken. After making this numerous times there are a few short cuts to make dinner a bit quicker. I eliminate the butter completely and when cooking the chicken you can add the onions and garlic, salt and pepper then. Then remove the chicken from the pan briefly. I also add the flour and basil to the broth and whisk it all together in a pitcher, then add it to the celery/onion/garlic in the pan with carrots...let simmer then add rest of veg, again simmer then put chicken back in...less lumps in the flour mixture if you add it together then add to pan...

The whole family loved this!  That is a rarity for us.  I didn't have everything on hand so I subbed frozen mixed veggies-carrots,green beans, corn, peas- and used 1 can of broth, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 1/2 cups half and half for the liquid and added 2 tsp of chicken bullion granules.  So good! Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent!  I was so excited to find a chicken pot pie/biscuits recipe that did not call for condensed soup (yuck!)!  Made this for dinner last night pretty much following recipe as written.  Omitted celery (none on hand), added mushroom and diced red potatoes (pre cooked in the microwave), used fresh peas and doubled the garlic.  Did 6 drop biscuits on top and while this worked fine, would prefer to do smaller drops next time - like 10 or 12 small drops.  Also, could cut biscuit batter back by 1/4 and still have plenty.  Ended up throwing out 6th biscuit because there wasn't enough chicken-y goodness to adequately cover it.  Easy peasy although it takes a little more effort than a dump and bake recipe but well worth the effort!  Tastes great!

Yum!  Hit the spot!  I wanted something different and I saw a recipe for something similar to this but used canned soup,etc and I wanted something not using soups.  This was it!  Thank you!  I enjoyed my dinner tonight and the only thing that I changed was the veggies.  I used onion,celery and broccoli pieces instead of carrots and peas.  I am positive that carrots and peas would be great as well. I was just craving a broccoli dish.  I used bisquick and buttermilk for my biscuits and I replaced basil in this recipe with Mrs.Dash Tomato,Basil,Garlic Seasoning.  I also cooked the biscuits separately from the mixture and enjoyed it this way.

Have made this several times and it's a great cold weather dish.  I used Heart Smart Bisquik mix and did not add the basil to the biscuit mix.  If you don't have basil, don't worry--it isn't necessary and still great without it.  Also, since the dough is extremely sticky and hard to work with, just spoon it onto the top of the casserole.  No need to get all fancy and make perfectly round biscuits!

Just okay.  Not nearly as flavorful as pot pie, and with all the prep that goes into the "soup" part, you might as well whip up some homemade biscuits to go on top.  It might improve the quality of this recipe.  I won't make it again.

Thank you for this, I usually dont alter the recipe the first time but I did. Cut down on the butter and changed some veggies and added potato. What I love is the base, no condensed fat soup. My kids loved it and it so easy and soooo much better fot them then pre-made or throw a bunch of processed stuff together. This will be used often. KUDOS

Very good. Made a few changes - used less butter, no celery or baby carrots, used 10 oz. frozen package of mixed veg instead of canned peas, and 1 can of Pillsbury red. fat buttermilk biscuits. I think I saved myself the hassle of making biscuits and the canned ones were great. I do think it could use another spice but not sure what, for right now I will just add another tsp. the salt next time. My 3 year old loved it and so did my husband. Thanks Cyndi!

Wonderful! I used homemade chicken broth and had to change the spices a bit because I was out of basil. I used rosemary and a bit of savory, and a dash of celery salt. I also added more carrots since my family loves them. Very yummy and filling. Next time I will use frozen peas instead of canned.

My roommate told me about this dish a while ago, but in his move had lost the recipe.  I found it on your website and as soon as I gave it to him, he decided to make it for dinner.  I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to all he had said about it but I was not disappointed.  This dish is EXCELLENT!  Great flavor!  We used corn instead of peas and it worked great.  You HAVE to try this, 5 stars for sure!

This was pretty good.  I would probably season a little differently next time & maybe add a potato. I think I would have loved it as a kid, just a tad bland as an adult. Happy that I added fresh mushrooms & a few extra biscuits. Will make again, just spice it up. One last thing, use frozen peas instead of canned.(I just thawed a little in the microwave)Tatses much better!

I cook very often and I enjoy making everything from scratch so this appealed to me. I followed the recipe but always add my own herbs if I think there isn't going to be enough flavor. This was very good, very, very filling, my husband who can eat (and is thin of course, men lol) could only eat two biscuits worth. I followed measurements but only had two cups of chopped chicken and it worked out just fine. I added Rosemary, Parsley and a bit more Basil (fresh) and it was very flavorful. This is a bit too much pepper for me so I'm glad I omitted the 1/8 of teaspoon I left out, if you don't like pepper you want to cut it in half. I found this to be a very good winter supper. It is time consuming, not difficult but takes a lot of prep but as does any good home cooked meal. I used Pillsbury Buttermilk Biscuits instead of making my own, there were just enough to cover my pan on top. I feel like is too many biscuits for the chicken mixture, my husband had two and myself one and half the mixture is gone so I will reduce biscuits next time. Overall, I will try this again, adding less biscuits, but other then that the flavor is spot on, no bland chicken and biscuits here, kudos to the writer this is one of the few (if any) recipes that I have not had to seriously alter I would definitely recommend this.

Excellent!!!! After several times of making it this way and loving it, i decided to make it a little more flavorful since my family loves tons of flavor.  Follow the recipe exactly but throw in some fresh THYME, fresh BAY LEAVES and some fresh SAGE with the Fresh Basil.... I bunch the herbs together so you can pull it out easily after cooking.  I also used frozen puff pastry and laid it over the entire casserole with a few slits in it to breathe.  Found this to be easier and just as good if not better!  Either way, with or without changes, this is an excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing!! ;)

This was very good and I loved that it wasn't made with a cream of something, not that I have anything against the. It's just nice to make some things from scratch. I made it just as the recipe says minus the peas. I hate peas. It was very good. The only thing I would do differently is cook the carrots and celery together first and then add to the mixture. The rest doesn't need to cook as long as they do. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought the recipe turned out a little dry both the biscuits & the 'filling'. I used additional seasoning throughout. Perhaps more liquid is needed in the recipe. I like the idea one reviewer suggested of swapping out the biscuits for mashed potatoes for a chicken sheperds pie approach. Would make again if I had leftover chicken and needed something to make in a pinch.

We really enjoyed this one! It uses standard ingredients in my kitchen, which makes it very convenient for a weekday evening. My modifications were minor: no celery (didn't have any), added corn, and no basil (just ran out). Wonderful fall/winter comfort food!

Wonderful, lower fat option but still great comfort food. I make chicken breasts in the slow cooker ahead of time because they shred up nicely. I also skip the extra work and top the casserole with Pillsbury grand biscuits. My in-laws request this recipe every time they visit!

So easy, good, and hearty! I used frozen vegetables, frozen bisquits (Grands) and Publix's rotisserie chicken. 4 cups was the entire chicken. By the time the bisquits were done (20-25 min) the chicken mixture/gravy was done; perfect timing! This is better than chicken pot pie because you get the extra dough from the biscuits. It's also nice because you only need to cook the # of biscuits that you will eat at that meal so they don't get soggy. Tomorrow for lunch I'll pop a couple more biscuits in the oven, heat up the chicken mixure and have a great lunch! Also, the mixture can be frozen! Another reason to give this a try ... you don't have to throw away left overs. BTW .. you do need to like basil; the taste definitely comes through

Delicious comfort food and a very versatile recipe that you can adjust according to the veggies your family likes. I used a rotisserie chicken, frozen peas instead of canned, added red pepper and extra garlic. Followed the advice of others to just plop big spoonfuls of the biscuit mix on top - turned out great and was even great the next day (I thought it might get mushy). I made extra of the chicken/veggie mixture and threw it in the freezer to use over refrigerator biscuits for an easy future meal. Delicious, fresh and healthy - nice to find a casserole recipe that does NOT include canned soup. We loved it - thanks.

I had to submit a review for this.  Anything my husband says is "delicious" three times during dinner and twice later that night deserves 5 stars.  Very comforting meal on a cold day.  Made exactly as writted except substituted frozen peas for canned.  I just like them better.  Good flavors too.  I am a fan of basil.  : )

Overall, this is a hearty, simple, and very tasty recipe. I poached my chicken to cook it quickly, and two large boneless breasts seemed to be just enough. 

As someone else mentioned, it is a lot of food for just two, and I agree that I would cut the recipe in half and use a 9x9 baking dish. 

Instead of making the biscuits I used pre-packaged home-style buttermilk biscuits, and they worked great! 

Also, the bottom of the biscuits don't get crispy because they soak up the moisture from the chicken mixture. I prefer mine crispier, so next time I would save some biscuits and bake them aside from the mixture and just spoon some on top.

Loved it! I made a few changes. Added about 1 cup of frozen corn instead of peas and used 3 cups of water, 3 chicken bouillon cubes and 1cup of half and half. Also I baked for 22 minutes only and it was more than done. I used more veggies than called for. It was soo good. Next time I may omit the baking as it seems unnecessary and make the biscuits separate then serve the chicken mix over it. Oh also I used regular refrigerated biscuits

Loved this! Made a few changes though. Only used half of the butter to cut out some of the fat, used frozen corn and green beans instead of peas because my husband hates peas, doubled the biscuit topping, and added some shredded cheese to the biscuit mix. Will definitely make again!

This has become a staple in our house. however, I add a little more veggie broth to the "soup" so there is more to soak up with the biscuits.

While I followed this recipe to the letter I would classify it as good, but not anything I would want to make again and my family agreed. The flavor was there and the presentation was there-it just was not anything special. It reminded us of a pot pie.

This is an instant classic! So easy, so delicious! I substitued celery with potatoes and used less flour in the sauce, that worked out perfectly. I also chose not to flatten the bisquits and I just covered the casserole with the biscuit mix, however I had to double the biscuit mix in order to completely cover the casserole dish. The biscuit mix was fluffy and flaky, I don't think that would have worked out if I flattened it, but I don't know for sure. 
WOW, my husband is raving about this dish and my son loved it and is already planning when I can make it again! Great winter time classic and so easy to make.

Just a great recipe! My husband and kids love this and I am always impressed by how great the gravy base comes out, perfect! Just the right amount of spices and the bonus is how yummy your house smells while it bakes!

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. I was curious about using canned biscuits for the top, so I used the Bisquick biscuits on one  half and the canned biscuits on the other. Some of us liked the Bisquick better, while others preferred the canned biscuits. I think I will make it with both again next time. I did use frozen peas, as I don't buy canned peas. It was very good, and I will be making this again.

Oh so good.  While I think the recipe is fine on its own, I customized with the following: chopped the onion/celery/carrots in the food processor, then cooked with about 1.5lbs of chopped chicken breast.  Used a 12oz can of evaporated milk and 2.5C of chicken broth for the liquid.  Also added additional spices/herbs to our taste.  Substituted honey for sugar (in our house, everything is better with honey in it!).  Since I prefer 'from-scratch', cut 1/2C butter into 2C self-rising flour (food processor works great for this too), then mixed in 1/4C apple cider (since it's fall) and 1/2C buttermilk, with only 1t of the basil, which made a great biscuit topping. Loved, loved, loved it.

This dish was awesome!  I cheated and used refrigerated buttermilk biscuits, which turned out great.  Just make sure and cover them with foil as soon as they start to brown.   Next time I'm going to try this with beef!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

Liked this one a lot.  I wish there was more of the chicken gravy.  I did not use basil, but used poultry seasoning (thyme, sage, marjoram, nutmeg, rosemary, black pepper) instead.  Other than that, followed exactly.  Had my 12 year old help, and she enjoyed the process.  A bit labor intensive in my mind, but yummy comforting result.

Absolutely divine!! Today was a rainy/cold day and this dish was perfect for that. For the cooked chicken, I bought a rotisserie chicken from the market and took the skin off and cubed it up. Fantastic! I bet the next day the leftovers will be even better since the flavors will have a chance to meld. Will definitely make again.

My husband loved this. I thought it was a bit on the salty side, but I just don't care for salt much, and should have used low sodium broth to begin with since I know this about myself. I also went heavy on the veggies, and soft on the chicken. Overall it was very good. And my kids (5 and 2) ate it, which is always a good thing.

This was very good.  I have tried other similar recipes that didn't turn out well.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't like the taste of basil in it very much (and I even left out 1 of the teaspoons that was supposed to be in the biscuit topping).  Otherwise, I made it as written.  Next time I would probably leave out the basil and replace 1 cup of the chicken broth with milk.

Wow this was good!  Comfort food on a rainy day...can't beat that!  I used a little more veggies than called for so I used 3 cups broth and 2 cups half and half, and a little more flour than called for to thicken it.  I used Rotisserie Chicken and bought store bought biscuits for the top, which worked fine, but next time I'll make the ones the recipe calls for.  SO good!

I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the sauce and eliminated the butter. I also eliminated the sugar since the onions and carrots add a sweet touch. 2 cups of chicken is enough since I doubled the veggies and added mushrooms and brussel sprouts. Butternut squash a handful of chopped, roasted hazelnuts makes a great alternative to the biscuit topping.

try substituting chicken stock (in the box), a bit of cream, and chicken base (used in restaraunts and found in the spice isle of the store) in place of the broth and salt. Don't salt until you've tasted as the chicken base is salty.

Wow, so good, I almost licked the plate.  My husband is lucky to have a little left for his lunch tomorrow.  I ran out of basil so the biscuits didn't get the basil but I also knew my family would like the plain biscuits better anyway.

I was in the mood for chicken pot pie, but didn't have the time to make the pie shell.  Found this recipe and I don't think I will be making chix pot pie again!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe as it was written, but used less peas.  Also, instead of the buttermilk baking mix, I used the E-Z Drop Biscuits recipe from this site.  While I am cooking the garlic and onion, I cook chicken strips that I have seasoned with salt and pepper and EVOO in the toaster-oven set at 375 f for about 10-15 mins..  They cook very quickly.  The baking dish I use also fits very nicely in the toaster-oven.   Will be our regular Wednesday Night Chicken night on the cold winter months ahead.  Very hearty, great comfort food.  And, best of all, it feeds my large family!  I can't please all the kids, but when it's 4 out of 5, I couldn't be happier!  Husband loves it too!

Delicious!  The five stars is just for the chicken and not the biscuits...too lazy to make those.  Served over toast.  Decreasing the salt my 1/2 was the only change I made.

Ok.  I don't get it.  I was expecting this to be good.  I even added poultry seasoning and some cayenne, corn fresh from the cob, fresh green beans, and it was BLAND and boring.  Not sure what can be done to make this flavorful.  My kids were unimpressed, and so was I.

Wow - my son and my husband said it was better than the recipe on the "Bisquick" box.  It was delicious and I used Bisquick because I had some left. I should have made more dumplings as there was lots of great gravy.  I'll make this more often now because often times I always have chicken on hand and I don't throw anything out.  Loved this one!  Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  It's a huge load of food, though.  I will definitely try to halve it next time.  I subbed a bisquick substitution recipe for the bisquick mix, and I used corn instead of peas, simply because I live in a country where neither of those is around.  It did remind me of a potpie.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Easy, comfort food.  Delicious casserole, and I really liked the basil in the biscuits.  Did not use the celery as we do not care for the flavor or texture.

We thoroughly enjoyed this! Made exactly as stated except used refrigerator biscuits. There was not a drop left at the end of dinner!

I thought this was only OK.  Paula Deen's version is MUCH better.  My husband on the other hand...he opted to eat Ramen and a ham sandwich.  The peas gave it a weird flavor and the sugar should be omitted...it's not needed.

AWESOME!  I did this as a stew served over the biscuits.  It was a little too thin so I thickened it with a flour/milk (or you could use water) mixture.  I also cooked the chicken in the pan and removed it before sauteing the veggies - a little more of the chicken flavor.   Overall this recipe is a big improvement on our old family favorite made with condensed cream of chicken soup, and I will be making it again!

Continued. . .I've made this so many times now.  Definitely a go to recipe.  Still haven't baked it as a casserole - always serve it over biscuits.  I usually add a bunch of vegetables including carrots, beans, corn, potatoes, and pureed zucchini.  Also have done it in the crock pot - cook chicken for a few hours till it pulls apart, then add everything else and let cook till veggies are no longer crunchy.  So much flavor.  So yummy!!

Delicious! I added diced potatoes, increased the vegetables and used less broth. I think this would also be easy to make in a crock pot except I'm not sure how you'd do the biscuits, maybe just add them at the end or cook them separately and drop them in.

I used this recipes as a guideline to an awesome and much loved dish. I boiled frozen chicken breasts to get the broth (less salt), then dice up the chicken for the recipe. I omitted the celery and used frozen vegetables instead of fresh or canned. Also, I made regular baking powder biscuits for the top.

Very good.  I like more sauce so I did like other viewers ... I added 1/4c flour and 1/2 c broth.  Also used frozen veggies just to save time.

This was pretty good.  However, the basil killed it. I would think a pinch of fresh thyme would have worked much better. I will make this again, but totally omit the basil. And I LOVE basil, just not in this recipe. Oh and it makes A LOT.

I loved the fact that this didn't call for canned "cream of" soup!  I used this recipe as the starting point and made some changes for my personal tastes: omitted onions, added half and half for 1/4 of the liquid, added half the amount of basil to the biscuit mix, added potatoes, corn and snap peas, omitted the canned peas.  Next time I will omit the basil from the biscuit mix entirely, it was just way to "basily" for me.

I made this recipe using exactly what was specified here, and was very disappointed.  I agree with others who have given it a low rating - a lot of prep work for a dish that doesn't deliver any degree of wow.  My husband, who loves chicken pot pie, didn't even finish his plate.  When I asked him if I should make it again, he said no.  I have to agree with him.  It was bland and the basil was definitely too much for our taste.

I liked this recipe and I will definitely make this again. I did make a few alterations. I made a half recipe since there is only 2 of us. I was hoping for leftovers so I didn't have to cook the next day but there weren't any. I sauted in olive oil instead of butter. I don't care for celery so I used a combination of frozen peas, carrots and corn. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I sprinkled in a little bit of garlic salt. I estimated the spices and it turned out fine. The sauce turned out thick not runny which is how I like it. For the biscuits I used the fluffy whole wheat recipe from this site and forgot to add in basil. I also used another reviewers suggestion and I cooked the biscuits separately and spooned the mixture on top instead of cooking in the oven. I was hungry and didn't want to wait 40 minutes.

I wanted to give this a five but because I followed it to the t, it just came out a little too seasoned. Tasted good, but I wanted great, amazing, wow! I would have gotten rid of the herbs, ie, basil and stuck with less, like pepper and salt. I would have used a little less flour next time, too much flour I think with the biscuits and all and add more milk instead of just the chicken broth. Overall, quite yummy, but not unbelievable. My husband, however thought it was great..I dont know if he was trying to make me feel better or what..Anyhow, also, I made the biscuits from scratch, do not add any herbs to these.. or any herbs to this recipe.. Remember, less is more.

This was good, I made my own biscuits, but I will warn you that you don't want too much biscuit dough on top make thinner biscuits than usual because it can get doughy and biscuits can over power the chiken mixture which taste great.

Very good, though it could be a little more flavorful as written. I made this once a while ago as written and it was good, just a little bland. This time I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder and onion powder and then pan seared them in a little butter. I removed them from the pan and then cooked the veggies. I used frozen peas instead of canned and added corn. I also used 1 cup whole milk and 3 cups broth and sliced the chicken and added it back in. Then I used "E-Z Drop Biscuits" from this site b/c I was out of mix. The second time, with my changes, was a five star dinner; but as written I'll give it four stars.

My mom used to make this all the time, granted, our version is a tad different, but still an amazing recipe! I have her make this as often as possible when I visit. And definitely bake the biscuits WITH the casserole, so much more flavor seeps into them.....mmmmm.....

This is the ultimate in comfort food!  I used frozen buttermilk biscuits instead of canned and upped the baking time to 45 minutes to bake the biscuits fully.  This was absolutely awesome and just as good the next day for lunch!  We will have this again and again and again.

This was such a perfect meal. I made only a few changes. I halved the recipe. I added about a half of a cup of evaporated milk when I added the chicken broth, and I also added cooked potatoe. I used evaporated milk in the biscuit dough as well and omitted the basil. I used 3 cups of the baking mix because I thought I wanted a lot of biscuits, but I was wrong. 2 cups is good for 1/2 of the recipe. If I was making the full recipe, 2 cups would not be enough. I will be making this again and again. Thank you for the great recipe.

Oh my goodness!! Delicious!!! We would have given it 6 stars if there was an option to do that.
I followed the recipe but also added a potato to the mix and instead of having separate biscuits on top, I rolled out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper that I lightly floured before I put the dough onto them.
The sheet of dough cooked up nicely, and was so tasty and we bypassed the whole sticky dough thing I read about.
Thanks to the poster of this recipe!!!

This was great! Dh called it perfect comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly, except I cheated and used a can of 10 biscuits. Next time dh asked me to use 2 cans. I also poached the chicken the day before, and used the resulting broth in the recipe as well. Just boiled some water in a large pot with a quartered onion and some crushed garlic cloves. Added the chicken breasts, partly covered the pot, and simmered for about 10 minutes. The chicken shreds up really easily then, and the broth is light and perfect fot casseroles like this one. We will definately make this again!

Yum!!  Used frozen peas (1/2 C.) instead of canned.  Also added 1/2 C. of frozen corn and 1/2 C. of Southern Style Hashbrowns. Because of these additions used only 3 C. of chicken.  Perfect amount of vegetables, chicken and sauce.  When making the biscuits used approx. 3/4 tsp. dried basil.  Have already copied and added to my recipe collection.

I took this to an ill friend's family and doubled the batch so we could try it, too. My husband and I thought it was great, but our kids weren't really excited about it. (They did eat it, though, and that's good enough for me!) My son had a friend over at the time who loved it, though. His mom called me to get the recipe for herself!

Excellent!  After reading all of the reviews, I changed a couple of things.  I left out the celery and replaced it with 1/2 head of broccoli.  I added 1 1/2 cups of thawed frozen corn. I added 1 1/2 cups of thawed frozen diced potatoes. I also added 1/2-1 teaspoon of Cheyenne Pepper to give it a little kick because I was afraid it would be a little bland.  I used pillsbury biscuits in a can that cut down on the prep time.  It came out perfect!  Leftovers were even better.  Excellent!

I used frozen peas and skipped the celery.  Very yummy, but the preparation was a bit time consuming.  I made it ahead of time and stuck it in the 'fridge for a couple of hours.  It turned out great.

This is a real KEEPER.  I did add some potatoes and deleted the celery (YUK!)  I used Martha White buttermilk biscuit mix.  My family loved this recipe.  My nine year old asked for seconds and probably would have had thirds if I had let her!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Perfect comfort food, Cyndi! The sauce on this dish is incredible....reminds me of a famous person's chicken pot pie that my family loves. I elminated sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon rosemary in with the mix.Also added small broccoli florets and whole kernel corn. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this incredible meal with us!

Very labor intensive and very bland.  I ended up throwing most of it out.  My husband wouldn't even finish what was on his plate.  Pass this recipe by, it's not worth it.

I LOVED this recipe. I added an extra chicken bouillon cube to the chicken broth, a little poultry seasoning, and I subbed potatos for the peas.  One of the best casseroles I've ever had.

Maybe I'm too emotional, but tears came to my eyes when I first tasted this. This is the most comfortable comfort food and brings back all those fond memories of taste and smell! The filling is completely made from scratch, yet really easy! I used a roasted chicken from the store, but it would be easy enough to roast your own if you have the time. I used frozen peas instead of canned, and threw in some frozen corn. For the topping, I used J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits found elswhere on this site, which I made with butter instead of shortening. I would say it makes about 8 large servings, but leftovers are always good! Yummy...easy...heartwarming...get me a hankie, I'm getting choked up again...

I MADE A FEW SUBSTITUTIONS TO REDUCE FAT, AND EASE PREPARATION.  I USED FROZEN CUT CARROTS, AND PURDUE "SHORT CUTS" ROASTED CHICKEN (2 PACKS.)  I USED 2 CUPS OF WINE AND 2 CUPS OF BROTH (INSTEAD OF 4 CUPS BROTH), AND I JUST USED ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF BUTTER (INSTEAD OF 1/4 CUP) TO SAUTEE VEGGIES.  I ADDED THE FLOUR SLOWLY, AND ADDED BROTH A LITTLE AT A TIME WITH THE FLOUR TO KEEP IT FROM CLUMPING.  I USED THE REDUCED FAT BISQUIK MIX, AND ADDED ABOUT 2 TABLESPOON PARMESAN CHEESE, INSTEAD OF THE BASIL.  THE CASSEROLE TURNED OUT GREAT, AND IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE !!  IT IS DEFINITLEY A "KEEPER."  MY HUSBAND, WHO OPTS FOR HOT, SPICY FOOD ANYTIME, EVEN LOVED IT.  CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.  IT'S EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY, IF YOU HAVE LEFTOVERS.

This really was an excellent all-around recipe.
I made it with refrigerated biscuit dough, which made it 
all that much quicker and easier. Kids loved it (love any form of pot pie)
Generally a hearty, very family friendly meal.

On my second try of this recipe, I didn't have any biscuit tubes, so  I substituted a refrigerator pie crust and eliminated the biscuits. My wife LOVED it!

I have made this several times with various combinations of vegetables.  I wanted to share last night's combination because it was yummy!  I had a box of pearl onion in cream sauce in my freezer.  I cooked it for 3 minutes in the microwave.  I then pretty much followed the recipe by sautéing the onions and sauce in butter with garlic; added 3 cups of chicken broth; 3 cups frozen vegetable mix; maybe 3+ cups of chicken; used an 11x7 glass pan and baked for 20 minutes.  I added Bisquick drop biscuits on top and baked at 375 for an additional 20 minutes.  Can't go wrong!

So comfort food! I altered it by using frozen mixed veggies rather than canned peas, and made my own clone of biscuit mix with half whole wheat flour. Next time I'll used thyme rather than basil. So looking forward to leftovers!!!

Made this tonight using leftover lemon garlic chicken, 10 oz frozen peas, added half a red pepper, and ended up using the "super quick biscuit squares" recipe on AR when I was unexpectedly short on Bisquick. It's going to be my lunches for work this week, hoping it's delicious!

Delicious, but just slightly bland. I thought the filling-to-biscuit ratio was off. A little too much biscuit and not quite enough filling...just my opinion. Also, I boiled 4 chicken breasts in a sea salt/seasoned salt water and used that as my 4 cups of diced chicken. Other than that, this recipe was a win, in my book.

This was excellent! Five out of five kiddos loved it! (If you're a parent, you know how amazing that is!!) 
I followed the suggestion from the reviews on another similar recipe, and made sure that everything was prepared beforehand so that the chicken mixture was nice and hot when I put the biscuits on top (So that they cooked enough.). 
Also, mist of my family is anti-peas!! So I substituted corn...
YUM!!!

I did just as the recipe said. It was excellent. My son said, "This is real fine." Whenever I have leftover poultry, I make this. When I need to, I'll alter the ingredients to give our taste buds a lift, but leave the overall recipe alone.

I have made this several times, with various changes each time as I like to experiment, but the base recipe is a solid recipe for chicken and biscuit casserole.

I always find that rosemary or basil and rosemary both tends to result in a more fragrant meal, and I especially like to put it in the biscuits--don't skimp on it, either, as it really does tie the meal together. Give this recipe a try, you won't regret it.

For a less dish-intensive way to make the recipe, use an electric high-sided skillet to cook the casserole part and bake the biscuits on a foil-lined pan in the oven; this ensures your biscuits don't get mushy, even for the leftovers, and means you only have one cooking pan to clean.

I liked that everything is made from scratch. I thought the "gravy" was a little soupy. Might reduce broth a little next time. I also found biscuits got a little dark after 40 minutes. Might reduce cook time a bit. Even picky daughter ate it.

Amazing recipe. We use frozen veggies and alternate between canned biscuits and bisquick. I have found I need to double the recipe because we always want more and it keeps well in the fridge. We make the chicken in the slow cooker ahead of time and shred it. Can't say enough good things!

I thought this recipe was delicious and my family loved it too!  The only flaws in how the recipe is originally written are the carrots should have been cooked separately and then added to the broth mixture.  My carrots were very crunchy even after cooking in the broth for about 15 minutes and 40 minutes in the oven.  The second part of this recipe that did not work out for me was trying to roll the biscuit mixture.  That was a sloppy mess so I just spooned the mixture over the top of the casserole to cover in biscuit.  It turned out lovely!

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of canned peas (I used frozen) and was pretty disappointed :( I had such high hopes. The flavor was ok, but not great and the biscuits were very uncooked on the bottom.

I was a little worried when I saw how thin the mixture was when I put it into oven but after a took the foil off at the end, it was the perfect consistency. The biscuits were the perfect touch with every bite. A keeper for my family!

No photo because it's gone! Doubled the recipe for casserole potluck tomorrow and the remaining amount I made up in a pie plate (with bottom crust) for our family dinner tonight. Very good flavor - the basil surprised me! I also added dried parsley because I had it, and canned corn. Also did half chicken broth/half stock because I was uncertain the flavors would be rich enough. This was the first time I made it, so I can't compare it to broth alone, but it was comforting, but not bland. I let the "sauce" thicken while simmering a few minutes longer because I didn't want it to be runny, but next time I will follow the recipe, because it thickened to a sticky cobbler state. It was good, but I wanted it to be gooey, with just a touch more moisture.  Thank you for posting this recipe! It is now in my handwritten recipe box - where only my best recipes are archived!

The recipe says to serve over biscuits... Is this the biscuits from the top or were we supposed to make extra biscuits separately.

Really liked how easy and tasty this recipe is. I toned down the basil and used frozen peas but otherwise followed as written. My husband liked it a lot.

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I did different was added some garlic salt (didn't have enought fresh garlic on hand) and I added a packet of chicken gravy to the mixture because some reviewers said it was a little bland. I am very happy with it.

I gave this recipe one star as the broth was a very soupy consistency and had a bland taste, although I followed directions as written.  I will not be making this recipe again, but for those who are trying it for the first time I recommend omitting the sugar (we could taste it in the broth), adding more flour to thicken the broth and adding whatever seasoning you prefer for flavor.  Otherwise, there is NO flavor and the consistency is the same as chicken broth.

Very good. I put mixture in a smaller pan and topped with Kentucky Biscuits from recipe on this site (didn't have Bisquick on hand). I agree with another reviewer that there's too much pepper, will cut back next time. Also used frozen peas. Good comfort food, great way to use rotisserie chicken!

I used ‘Herb-Ox Sodium Free’ packets, for the broth and half the salt and pepper directed (I'm on a low-sodium diet). It still had plenty of flavor. I boiled 3 small chicken breasts and cubed them and used 2 bags of frozen mixed vegetables. I made 'drop biscuits' with Bisquick Heart Smart mix & almond milk because that's what I had on hand. I cooked as directed, then just left it all in the skillet, dropped the biscuits in and put it in the oven... one less dish to wash! I didn't bother with the foil at the end because the 'drop biscuits' didn't really need it. DELISH!!! I may try some mushrooms and sherry next time, but what a terrific comfort dish... I can't wait for leftovers!

This is a very easy recipe. I didn't make eight separate biscuits as in the original directions. Instead I just spooned the biscuit dough on top of the chicken mixture to save time. It worked out perfectly! Also, I use leftover chicken from a purchased rotisserie. I have made it a few times now and my kids ask for it over and over! Thanks for sharing it!

Cut back on the peas. It changed the taste of everything. I thought this would taste a little different. Meh.

I doubled the recipe and thereby added a few more veggies, 1/2 a zucchini and red pepper diced and skipped peas altogether. For the liquid I did deviate a bit, I used the 4 C. of broth as written but added 1 C. of sour cream and 2 C. of milk. To me that seemed about right, I didn't want it too thin. I used E-Z Drop Biscuit Recipe from this sight, ONLY because I didn't have mix. It filled my 9x13 dish without running over. I dropped the biscuits by spoonful right on top. I baked it the 30 minutes required.  Utterly Delicious!!

Oh my god my boyfriend and I just made this tonight and we LOVED it! So delicious and it was something even novice cooks like us could easily handle! I didn't have time to make the biscuits tonight so I just used grands instead- still really good! Would definitely recommend this- especially for someone like us who aren't too comfortable in the kitchen yet;)

My family loved this recipe.  They are fighting over the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I bought 2 rotissoure chickens from the grocery store and used that as my chicken.  It tasted awesome.  I also loved the basil biscuits, which I am surprised because I have tried making a dish like this before and the biscuits were always soggy.  Not these! Will be making this again.

Absolutely delicious. Made it for the first time tonight, it was simple. Next time I will use more broth, the biscuits seemed to soak up all the soup.

Love this! I can't have basil so I substitute rosemary and to save time I used can biscuits. It is also a good use up recipe. I usually add to this recipe with with ever I have left in the fridge or pantry like the one random sweet potato that I didn't need for another recipe or corn leftover from dinner last night.

This was a huge hit in my house!  I made the recipe as written, except using frozen peas instead of canned as other reviewers had done.  The homemade biscuits were so delish, my husband asked me to make more!  They soaked up the liquid, and melt in your mouth.  And it was so nice not to use canned soup, I think I'll tweak other casserole recipes too! Thank you for sharing this wonderful casserole repice, we thoroughly enjoyed it:)

Delicious. I forgot the garlic and sugar, but added sweet sherry and a little bit of bullion to my chicken stock as well as mushrooms to the veggies. I also traded out the basil for some tarragon. Just used plain bisquik biscuits. I didn't, however see the need to cook it that long, since everything but the biscuits was already cooked. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes or so.

Much too labor-intensive!  Took me an hour just to get this recipe ready for baking!  I recommend using Heinz's fat-free chicken gravy OR Progresso's recipe starters "creamy roasted garlic with chicken stock cooking sauce".  MUCH easier!  For the topping, use refrigerated biscuits or mashed potatoes (the bisquick is too messy, IMO!)

I really loved this recipe.  I've been looking for a chicken and biscuit recipe with nice thick sauce and this is it.

I made everything exactly as the recipe specifies, except I used a whole roaster boiled in water for 70 minutes.  I let it cool and pulled off the chicken. I used the broth from boiling the chicken to make the casserole.

Only thing I might change is to use a little less basil next time.  It was very good, but I just thought it was a but too much basil taste

I found this recipe doing an ingredients search for chicken, basil, and carrots so right off the bat I was going to modify it to whatever I had on hand. I had a lot of fresh green beans and I substituted those for the canned/frozen peas. I also like things a tad spicy so I made a dry rub for my chicken, which was cooked in a NuWave. The dry rub was 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp sesame seeds. I sprinkled the dry rub on each side of the chicken tenders prior to cooking. In my veggie mix I had sweet onion, carrots, celery, and green beans, all chopped to bite size. I sauteed them in butter for a bit, then added chicken broth to cover them and a bouillon chicken cube to add flavor based on previous reviewer comments. I then added a little less than 1/3 cup of flour - my goal was to have the sauce thicken but still be a bit soupy. The major sub I made was corn bread for the biscuits, which came out absolutely amazing since corn bread was a little sweet and mixed very well with the spicy chicken profile. For that I used a package of corn bread muffin mix with egg and milk and then spread the mixture over my casserole dish containing the veggies and cut up chicken mix. I baked that in the over for 30 minutes at 350 and the meal came out phenomenal. Corn bread did not get soggy at all for lunch the next day!

My kids' current favorite and less work than the chicken pot pie I used to make.  I also add cubed blanched potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, bell pepper, and frozen peas and corn to the filling and use "Chef Jon's Buttermilk Biscuits" recipe instead of the buttermilk baking mix (scoop blobs of dough to dot the top of the casserole - no need to roll and flatten balls of dough)

This is the bomb!  This is my new go to recipe for chicken and biscuits!  I decided that I didn't want to bake it so I kept it in the pot once everything was combined as more of a stew.  I also paired it with the copy-cat biscuit recipe from pintrest.  My husband was pretty impressed.  It is a quick and easy meal that made enough for lunch leftovers.  Oh, the only other thing, I only did about 1/4 tsp of sugar because my husband doesn't do sweet.  But don't leave it out all together, it ads something.  Excellent! Thanks

This is our ALL TIME favorite dish for the colder weather. I do not use prepared biscuits i used the bisquick mix and i just drizzle it over the entire dish instead of getting involved with rolling the sticky dough into balls. Comes out perfect everytime!

My husband and kids absolutely loved this dish! I made some adjustments to the original recipe to fit their tastes: I subbed all of the veggies for a bag of frozen mixed vegetables(peas, carrots, corn, green beans). I omitted the basil on the biscuit mix and added cheese and garlic. I love that this is a casserole dish that doesn't include any cream of whatever soups. Filling, inexpensive and really family friendly. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made this recipe a dozen times and I am never disappointed. It's delicious as is, but I've also modified it to use up leftover veggies from my refrigerator. I've made it with various combinations of asparagus pieces, mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli...and anything else I had on hand. It's wonderful every single time. 

I've even used canned biscuits that were on sale. I rolled them out into a 9x13" square and covered my casserole. The flavors are perfect and this dish is the perfect comfort food. Thanks for sharing!

Devoured at Sunday dinner!  Even though I usually send home some with the grandparents.  Made it with a rotisserie chicken and frozen biscuits.  Also added mushrooms and forgot to cover it with foil, but it was still darn good.  Something very basic about carrots, celery, onion in a casserole that is fab.   Next time I might leave out the sugar.  Not sure its really needed.   An extra roll of biscuits helped stretch the meal out for more folks.  Thanks!

Tasted good. Had to add a lot more flour though to thicken it up. Used re-fridge biscuits. Added frozen corn and peas. Needs to cook longer to cook bottom of biscuits.

Definatly comfort food :) It came out great. I followed the recipe except for 3 minor additions 1) I added corn to the mix, 2) I added 1/2 cup of milk to the gravy & 3) mixed the veggies and the gravy together before pouring it in my pyrex dish. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good-lots of flavor. I left out the celery and added potatoes as well as extra carrots and celery.

To make it easier I just followed the first two steps as directed and then instead of baking the mixture I just baked a roll of country style bisquits and when they were done cut them in half and poured the mixture over them. It was excellent and much easier then dealing with the mess!

this recipe was easy and good! I boiled a whole chicken  and after it cooled off I just shredded it with my fingers.  I used frozed peas to cut down on the sodium and just eyeballed the amount which was the only change I made. I sugguest making the biscuits according to the recipe because that was the highlite of the dish for me!

This was an excellent recipe. I did make some changes such as onion powder, celery flakes, frozen peas and carrot mix and I shredded chicken thighs after I boiled them. The biscuts really made the meal. 1 biscut required lots of the chicken mixture. The biscut mix made approximately 7 nice size biscuts. However the overall taste was excellent and everyone enjoyed it

This is SOOOOO GOOOOOD! The only things I did different was I put 1 1/2 cups Broth & 1/2 cup Milk, I added a little boulion & some poultry seasoning. I used the refrigerated biscuits in the pop up can to cook on the top. My husband was eating it all up. :-D

Very good hearty dish.  I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful.  The veggies were tender and the biscuits were very flavorful.  The basil is a nice touch.  I added the flour and kneaded the dough as instructed.  Very little effort.  I will make this again!

Really good.   I had leftover turkey from Thanksgiving that I used which I think really added to the flavor. Otherwise I did not alter the recipe.  Will make again.

My family loves this recipe! I substitute the rosemary for the basil, the flavor of the rosemary blends very well. I also double the celery, carrots, onion and add an extra cup of broth. I'm a vegetarian so I spoon out a couple of scoops before I add the chicken and then cook in a separate dish.

This recipe is excellent, I doubled the recipe and subsituted half and half cream for 1/2 of the broth and used frozen peas. I also added rosemary with the basil in the casserole not the biscuits.  The biscuits turned out perfect, nicely browned and soft in the middle.  My whole family enjoyed it alot, I have three teenaged boys and my husband. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!

My very hard to please husband gave it 4.5 stars, but I would have preferred to add mushrooms. It was very good. The only changes I made were the use of chicken stock, and I substituted corn for the peas. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and made soup from what was left.

This dish was good, but it is more like chicken and dumplings than it was like checken pot pie.  It would be better with less biscuit.

Followed this almost to a T. Used frozen peas, low sodium broth, and a little less sugar/salt then called for. Boiled chicken in salt free broth with poultry seasoning, basil and a bay leaf first. Used 2 cups of Bisquick and made 7 large biscuits on top. Cut recipe in half since I was only cooking for 2, will make full recipe next time for even more left overs, my boyfriend and I both loved it! Thanks, will make again and again!!

My husband does not like casseroles but he loved this! I doubled the dumpling part of the recipe. The only thing it needed was a little more sauce to pour on top of the dumplings. Excellent flavor!

This casserole was excellent, very tasty. I used frozen peas and added frozen corn. Also used Bisquick because it was convenient. My entire family raved about it. I will make it again for sure.

Sooooo good!  Chicken pot pie is one of our favorites, but putting it in a 13 x 9 dish appealed to me, since I'm feeding teenaged boys.  I like the biscuits; I followed the recipe (using just scant tsp basil, and less milk so they formed a good dough) and flattened them a lot.  I was in a hurry, so thin as they were, the casserole was done in about 25 minutes, without the 10 extra minutes covered in foil.  Next time I may double the biscuit dough, make em thicker.  I probably used a bit more than 1/2 cup ea of the onion, celery & carrots, then I used about a cup each of frozen peas and frozen cut green beans.  I substituted 1 tsp herbes de provence seasoning blend for the basil in the filling since other reviewers said the basil was overpowering, plus it's my favorite seasoning for chicken.  The filling was so rich and delicious!  I just polished off the last small portion for lunch (after hiding it from the boys), and I think I may reduce or even eliminate the salt next time.  I use Wolfgang Puck roasted chicken broth and there is plenty of flavor w/o added salt.  Definitely a keeper, unanimous in my family!

I would have given this 5 stars, but it was pretty time-consuming.  I'm a slow cooker, but two hours, start to finish, is longer than I usually have with two preschoolers running around!  I used canned biscuits (two cans of the smaller Pillsbury completely covered the dish) and everyone loved it.  I love the home-cooked feel of it... just not the home-cooked time!

OK... I made this recipe, which was a lot of work but totally worth it.  We ended up eating it for 3 nights in a row until it was gone.  I had to make a few adjustments based on what I had available.  I seasoned (garlic salt, fresh pepper, rosemary and basil)and baked 4 dark chicken quarters.  I used celery root and leeks and a frozen peas n' carrots mix.  Instead of using a buttermilk baking mix I made the wholewheat biscuits from this site and added rosemary as well as basil to the biscuits.  It was delicious!  I will be making again and soon!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was absolutely awesome. I didnt change a thing. I did make more biscuits for the top (I doubled it)and just dropped them on top/ I like the idea of mushrooms for the next time and I may try the frozen peas as well. I used McCormick basil and garlic seasoning. I will make this a lot this winter..Thanks again for another hit!!!

this was really good!  for the person who had problems with the sticky dough, just add a smidge of flour and mix it in.  mine was less sticky and i was able to roll it into balls, then flatten.  Everything turned out great!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone really liked it. I used canned biscuits because I didnt have all the stuff to make the homemade kind. I just dumped the mixture over top and it was pretty yummy. I also cut all the veggies in small pieces and used frozen peas instead of canned (this was suggested by others who made this recipe before.)
Great recipe thanks for sharing!

Cooked canned biscuits separately and poured the sauce on top.  Delish!  Not very healthy at all though.  Thanks for making me gain a couple pounds CVERNSMITH!  ;)

This is such a great recipe!! I did cut the basil in half for the biscuits though, I thought that 2tsp was a bit too much. It does calm down as it cooks though! Wonderful flavor, will add to our regular rotation for sure.

I tried this recipe last night and pretty much followed it as written. I did use the recipe for bisquits from the Bisquick box though. It came out great. A nice hearty chicken dinner that my family just loved, definately making it a regular dinner choice for us!

Oh my gosh!!!! Not exactly a chicken pot pie and not exactly chicken and dumplings.  Better than both!!  I used what was left of a roast chicken from Costco that we'd had the nite before.  Followed the recipe to a "T" except used frozen instead of canned peas and added some zucchini that I had in the fridge.  My daughter and I both loved this!! What I especially love was achieving the creamy texture w/out the benefit of "cream of" anything soups.  The biscuit/dumpling creation was a bit messy but I recruited my 13yo daughter for most of that part and they turned out great!!  Yes it was a bit labor intensive, but the results were well worth it.

If you are not crazy about basil you will not care for the main flavor of this recipe. I wished I'd have substituted it with something different  because I ended up throwing what could have been another meal away.  I will use this recipe again but will make it my own with much needed changes for me to enjoy.  I didn't use the biscuits recipe, used grands buttermilk on top.  As recipe stands, a 2* at best for my taste, sorry...but thank you for sharing the recipe.

Great on flavor! I would use half of the pepper -a little too spicy for small children. The biscuits were a little dry so I will add more milk next time. I used a cooked rotisserie chicken and will continue doing so. This recipe will be apart of my family recipes. -A Keeper!

This recipe is fabulous and a 'must-try' for every cook.  I did customize to our liking and convenience though.  I used: 
2 cans of Swanson's Chicken Broth (14-1/2 oz. size) 
plus added 1/2 cup milk after I thickened the the veggies and broth in step 2.  
I used frozen peas 
and 
a whole rotisserie chicken plus the juices in the packaging, minus any fat, skin and bones. 
  
For the biscuits I used:
2-1/3 cups bisquick mix and cut the basil in half.
In the oven for 35 minutes
raised oven temp to 400 removed foil and browned my biscuits perfectly.
After my changes it was definately a 5 star  meal.

This was delicious! Used biscuit mix that I picked up while on vacation in Colorado at Lucille's. I also made it with a frozen pea and carrot mix, instead of fresh carrots and canned peas. So good! Will make it again. Much lighter than eating an actual chicken pot pie.

We loved this.  I changed very little.  Boiled and shredded the chicken before adding it, added in some portabella mushrooms, and spooned the biscuit batter over the mixture rather than forming biscuits.  It was so delicious!

Made this last night & my husband really liked, but, he'll eat anything!! That's not to say it wasn't good--it was....just not great. We both really liked the ckn/veggie mixture, but, thought there was too much bread/biscuit. I took advice from other reviewers & used Miss Bettys recipe for dinner rolls. It was super heavy for us. I'm not a fan of refrig rolls but will prob use those next time. Overall, a good "comfort food" dish. Will make again & experiment w/diff toppings :-)

This is delicious & a big hit from ages 18mos up to Daddy.  But I made my own buttermilk biscuits from scratch.

Very good Casserole, we added mushrooms to it and used refrigerated biscuit dough instead of the box mix.

My husband tried this recipe, following the instructions to the letter, and we were very impressed.  Even my 21-month old liked it!  Great pot pie flavor without the "pie".

This was awesome! I added more carrots and also added corn. It has a lot of flavor! Instead of making biscuits I used grands. These cook faster so you may want to cover them earlier or put them on about ten minutes in and keep an eye on them.

I made this for a family of 4 and everyone had seconds! Instead of celery and peas (didnt have any) i used frozen mixed veg, to get that healthy element in there! I also used a 3 cheese biscuit mix i had in the cupboard for the biscuits on top. It was a delicious recipe, so nice to see one without canned soup in! Next time i'll ad a few more herbs i think. Thyme would be lovely in there, maybe a splash of white wine. Overall a great family supper

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did cheat and use canned buttermilk biscuits which worked fine in a pinch, but we think it would be worth the effort to make homemade biscuits.

I only had 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken, so I added 2 peeled and diced yukon potatoes.  Also, since I thought that the flavor of the chicken/veggie mixture was quite bland - and after searching my fridge and spices to find something to add some flavor, I found it!  I added 2 T. of prepared pesto.  Very good! YUM!

Great quick dinner. Used rotisserie chicken, 1 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegs instead of baby carrots, and instead of all chicken broth--used 2 cups chicken broth, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can water. Use the 1/2 cup of flour as usual. Also, decreased basil in baking mix to 1 tsp. Family of five finished every drop.

Pretty good...couldn't get the gravy thick enough, tried all my secrets on it...oh well probably me and not the recipe.  I'll try this one more time..has potential. Sep 2012 I tried this again and it came out thick and creamy. I used  1/4 less broth and added milk.  Use celery, onion, garlic, corn, peas and mushrooms as veggies. I also cut down the basil to 1/2 tap and add pepper.

Great recipe! After using other people's suggestions, adding 3/4 Tbsp. poultry seasoning, 4 bouillion cubes and 4 cups of water instead of chicken broth and frozen peas instead of canned, I used cornbread instead of biscuit mix.  Make a regular cornbread recipe off the box and plop it onto the top of the mixed casserole about three across.  Bake for 25 minutes instead of 40 and serve as suggested. My three men loved it and we didn't have any leftovers.  I will definately make this again.  Great way to use up leftover chicken.

We all enjoyed this - even my 4yr old who doesn't like anything with chicken in it managed to eat a decent sized portion.  I didn't use the baking mix bisuits I used "Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuits" from this site.  Not the same texture but a bit healthier.  I baked these separately and just left the casserole to simmer in the pan (saves washing another dish!)I also subbed half milk for half the chicken stock.  I had no problems with it thickening probably because I left it on the stove.  Would make again.  Makes a nice change from the pot pie.

Very good.  The family liked it.  It will be added to our regular recipe file.  Since I was running out of time I did use Pillsbury buttermilk bisquits and sprinkled the basil on top.  It came out quite nice.

Yummy! I used frozen peas and only 1 tsp. of basil in the biscuits because I was worried it might be too much for our taste. As for the biscuits I followed the recipe on the Bisquick box which calls for 2 1/4 cups mix and just dropped the biscuits on top. It made 9 biscuits which covered the top just right. Very easy & delicious.  Great meal on a cool day. Thanks!

Awesome. LOVE that this recipe does not include canned soup. We used 3 good sized chicken breasts (shredded) and more veggies. Also threw in more garlic.   Oh, and this was totally delicious using buttermilk biscuit dough from the refrigerator section. YUM!

If I could give this 3.5 I would.  The flavor was good - the basil was very unique and I liked it a lot.  The consistency left a lot to be desired.  It was like eating soup with biscuits on top, and I followed the recipe to a T.  Maybe it was supposed to be like that.  If so, I wasn't terribly impressed.  If I made this again I would cut down on the liquid quite a bit - or add some filler ingredients like potatoes or some other vegetables.    We did like it though - it just wasn't as amazing as I expected it to be.

My family really liked this recipe.  I used frozen peas instead of canned and added a little more garlic.  I also just used store bought rolls instead of making them.  It was very flavorful, I will definitly be making this again.

I used soy protein "chicken" and some tofu. I had to make my own biscuit crust. When I was cooking it, it seemed too wet to take out at the proper time, but I should have, because as the thing cools, it is not so saucy, and is too dry. Otherwise, everyone loved it and I will make it again.

This was sucoh a great meal! I poached 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth. When done, I strained the stock and used it in the gravy.  Like others, I did the plop and drop with my biscuits and they came out great.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe! My husband went back for thirds! This time I followed the recipe exactly. Next time i will cut back on the black pepper a bit and maybe a little on the basil - there was just a little too much seasoning for my taste. This mixture would be great over egg noodles too, if you're not into biscuits.

YUMMMMMM!  It was great just as is! Push the biscuit dough just below the "gravy" so that the tops do not burn and they come out all soft and steamy. Delicious!

This was fantastic (even though the main picture for this recipe doesn't look appealing - mine was much thicker)!  I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes dissolved in 4 c of water instead of using chicken broth and used frozen peas instead of canned.  I also added some shredded cheese, garlic powder, and salt to the biscuit mix then just dropped spoonfulls on top of the dish before baking and it turned out great.  This will go in my "favorites"...my husband loved it!

My family enjoyed this but there wasn't a mad rush for leftovers. We made it a bit more healthy by doubling up on the veggies, using frozen peas instead of canned (less sodium), fat free low sodium broth and then fat free half and half to bring the two cans of broth up to the 4 cup line. We sauteed the veggies in smart balance butter flavored spread (lite) and I used low fat bisquick for the veggies. I also omitted the basil and added 1 tsp of poultry seasoning to the flour mixture and added garlic powder rather than basil to the biscuits. I think that biscuits from scratch probably would've been better but this was a decently fast, healthy meal overall.

I didnt use the basil b/c it didn't seem to fit, and I used canned bisquits.  Note to others: the sauce is quite thin, I was expecting something thicker, but none the less, VERY good!  Others have mentioned this is bland, but, when I cooked my chicken, I first seasoned it with poultry grill seasoning  baked it. Overall, I think this was very good!

I loved this recipe! I followed most of the recipe, except for chicken broth I used bullion cubes. Also, instead of baking the biscuits from scratch, I just popped some canned biscuits in the oven, and voila! It was sooo good, my husband loved it!

This is one FANTASTIC dinner!!  I used the suggestion of another reviewer and used half-n-half along with the broth.. this is so heavenly!!  The only difference I made, was to bake the bicuits before hand.. I used my homemade broth and it is so tasty, there is nothing left!!  My 4 boys ate it all in one sitting!!  Thank you for this recipe, which is now a staple in our home!!

I really like this recipe.  The only modification I made was instead of using a baking mix for the biscuits, I "cheated" and just dropped biscuits on top from a 12 oz package of refrigerated buttermilk biscuits.  Turned out great!

A very tasty supper on a snowy day! I replaced the basil in the chicken/veggie mixture with poultry seasoning and used garlic powder in the biscuits.

EXCELLENT!!  I basically doubled the amt of veggies because my boyfriend and I are huge veggie people.. but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I'm going to use pre-made biscuits.. My boyfriend had three servings.  Makes good leftovers too.

This is really amazing!  The whole family loved the casserole and gobbled it up.  The only changes I made were to add cream to make up the difference between 2 cans chicken broth and 4 cups (which was about 1/2 cup cream).  I also sauteed the veggies and made the sauce in an oven-safe chicken fryer pan and just added the biscuits on top to bake, rather than pouring the mixture into a separate pan.  Creamy delicious chicken mixture, and perfectly cooked, lightly browned biscuits.  The basil was a great "secret ingredient."  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  The basil was a little bit strong for me, so next time I may cut back, but still very good.  Also, I increased the biscuit mix as some reviewers recommended and it was too much.  Stick to the recipe.

I know it is annoying, but I am rating this recipe based on a few changes I made. I stuck with the basic scheme of things though so I think this recipe would also be fine as is. 

The changes I made were: I used store bought biscuits instead of making my own (I brushed butter and basil on the top to give them a basil flavor as in the recipe), I added corn, and I also added a can of cream of chicken to the liquid portion since I like things creamier. Overall I loved the results. You can definitely taste the basil so if you aren’t a basil fan I would recommend a different recipe.

This is one of my husbands favorite "homestyle" meals. SO good! Even great as leftovers, however the sauce does get soaked up in the biscuits. STILL GOOD THOUGH!!!

I made a few small changes.  I omitted the garlic and used frozen peas.  Also, I didn't use basil in the biscuits, which was a good thing because the chicken had enough basil in it for my tastes.  The biscuit dough was very sticky and hard to handle, so next time I will probably just spread it evenly over the top of the chicken.

This was very good, although I took quite a few liberties with the recipe. I left out the garlic, sugar and basil, none of those things sounded like they fit with chicken and biscuits. I added about 1/2 cup of cream to the sauce, used frozen peas instead of canned and I added a chopped potato. Also, increased the biscuits to 3 cups mix and 1 cup milk, no basil. It was very good and the leftovers reheated well in the microwave.

This is absolutely wonderful!! doubled the biscuits and left out the basil. I poached my chicken and used 2 cups of the broth from that and then used 2 cups of store bought broth and added 2 bouillon cubes just to make sure there was enough flavor. Next time I will keep it the same and just replace the peas with some green beans. Yummy!!

We really liked this recipe, although as usual I added my own touches.  I, like so many others, added mushrooms, corn, and frozen peas.  I also added a heavy tablespoon of chicken base, which added a great depth of flavor.  I also thickened it with a little flour and milk before topping it.  Instead of the herbed biscuits, I made the garlic cheddar version on the box, and they were wonderful (doubled the recipe by the way...we're "topping" lovers).  We will definitely make this again!

This dish is the perfect comfort dish for winter weather. This was just so delicious! Will definitely make it again! (Next time though I will use 1/2 tsp of salt -- it was slightly too salty for my taste.)

This was pretty good...I've never done a chicken with biscuits recipe, and it turned out better than I expected. I did put potatoes in instead of peas, and I used regular carrots diced up, and added a can of corn. I also seasoned my chicken with garlic, cumin coriander, and pepper, and added some more into the mix when it was combined. It still turned out with a mild taste, but not bland which is good when you're trying to get little picky eaters to agree! :) Almost with a chicken pot pie feel, but not such a "packaged" taste. It will be good and easy to vary the veggies. Thanks!

This was great!  My boyfriend was leary at first but he loved it.  Since it was just the two of us, we halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 dish.  We had to make extra biscuits because when I halved the recipe it only made two.

I was amazed at how well this turned out since I made so many changes due to sodium issues with my husband.  I omitted the salt and used garlic powder and added lower sodium homemade broth that I found on this site versus store bought. I also used smart balanced margarine in place of butter.  He didn't complain and I didn't tell him.  Thanks for the recipe.

Hearty and delicious! In addition to fresh celery, onion, and garlic, I used chopped broccoli, carrots, peas, corn,  green beans, and lima beans-- all frozen.  I also multiplied the biscuit dough by 1.5 because crustiness is always desired.  Will definitely make again!!!

This was very tasty, like a pot pie. I used canned carrots and added a can of sliced potatos. Also I topped with premade biscuits to save time. Great way to use up leftover chicken.

Since my husband isn't a biscuit eater I bought deep dish pie crusts (four to be exact).  I filled two of the crusts with the filling and used the other two crusts as the top of the crusts.  Almost like a chicken pot pie.  I used frozen veges instead of sauteeing  them.  I used 2 cups vegetarian vegetable broth (to enhance the vegetable taste) and two cups fat free chicken broth.  Could have used an extra cup of broth since the crusts soak up some of the sauce.  Added sliced baby bella mushrooms to the mixture as well.  Very, very delicious.   Next time will probably try with turkey instead of the chicken. Would have given it 5 stars but I strayed from the original recipe a tad bit.

This made a yummy, hearty dish - perfect for a cold day. The biscuit dough was sticky and hard to work with, but it baked up perfectly. We used frozen peas instead of the canned - just our personal preference, and also added fresh mushrooms. Next time I'll add more carrots for color. We loved it - can't wait for the leftovers. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Simply the Best!!!! Even though I added 1 Potatoe and a little frozen corn. And since I'm a 2 crust kind of gal, I bought the already made Pillsbury Crust. I have plenty of left overs since there are only two of us, but I'm already being asked when the next time I'm going to make this.  Thanksgiving is coming, so maybe I'll try a Turkey Pot Pie next.  Thank you Cyndi - absolutely delicious and very easy to put together !!!

Really yummy recipe!  I added a few extra veggies...including a diced potato which may have helped keep the sauce from becoming runny as others mentioned.  This recipe does involve a great deal of prep work so don't expect to get out of the kitchen quickly!!

I finally joined All Recipes just so I could rate this recipe!  My husband, who doesn't like chicken very much, raved about this and asked for leftovers (which he also doesn't usually like much).  All I changed was to add some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the biscuit dough.  I didn't use quite all the broth that it called for, since I was using leftovers from cooking the chicken.  I guess that's why mine wasn't runny like others.  It was delicious!  Thanks.

This was excellent!  I used leftover chicken, and only had 3 cups, but it was fine.  Next time, I may use frozen peas instead of canned, and perhaps add a few more carrots.  The biscuit dough was a little hard to handle (sticky!), but definitely worth the effort.  YUM!!

Very good, very easy, and a great way to use up leftover chicken!  
I used pre-made refrigerator biscuits to save time; next time I'll make the Bisquick ones.  I personally thought that the refigerator biscuits made it taste weird.  
This recipe also reheated well the next day.

This was a really perfect recipe for my leftover Costco roasted chicken. I added more veggies like others had mentioned. I doubled the garlic plus added a half teaspoon of garlic powder to spice it up a bit. And instead of peas, I used frozen broccoli from Trader Joe's. I also used Bisquick and it turned out fabulous. Thanks~!

This dish is so flavorful. To make it healthier, I cut the biscuit portion in half and add in more vegetables like chopped potato and broccoli. My 1 yr old gobbles it down!

I thought this recipe was quite good. It made wonderful comfort food on a cold Sunday day. I couldn’t resist doubling the veggies and chicken. I also substituted parsley for the basil – simply because I didn’t have any basil in the cabinet. It turned out nice. I even think the leftovers were better the next day.

Very good!  I used half the butter to saute the veggies and 1% milk in the biscuits, and this brought the recipe down to less than 30% fat per serving without having to use a light biscuit mix.  I had no problem with the amount of basil called for in the recipe.  I will make this again.

Ohh, this was a yummy dish.  I made my own chicken stock to go with this, and instead of chopping and using more celery and carrots for this dish, I just used the ones from my stock.  I thought this was an excellent dish, and I even made it again (with slightly different results) with adding more vegetables instead of chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  For some reason I could not find my basil after the first time I made this, so I made the second one without.  If you are thinking of making this without the basil, my suggestion is DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  I'm not a big basil fan myself, but without it, this recipe lacks for taste ((cries)) I still haven't found my basil.  I won't make it again until I have, or I break down and go out and buy some more.  Thank you so very much for a wonderful recipe.  One additional note:  We ate it just as the chicken dish, it was so good we couldn't wait for the biscuits to go on top and a bake in the oven.  We happily munched on it while the biscuits baked :>.

What a delicious meal! I thought I had chicken broth but didn't so I used a half can of cream of chicken soup and boiled my chunks of chicken breast, using the boiling water for the broth. We ate every single bite! I also added corn. I didn't foil it the last 10 minutes and I didn't notice any problems. I'll make this again and again.

I liked this because of the ease of putting it all together.  I can't handle canned peas, so substituted a couple of handfuls of frozen peas.  Also I substituted tubed Grande biscuits for the recipe here.  We both enjoyed it and agreed that it's a keeper!

This was delicious.  I used Jiffy biscuit mix, and the biscuits turned out beautiful.  I think I may try adding some sliced mushrooms next time, and also try to investigate a way to eliminate or cut down on the butter to make a lower fat version.

Yummy!!!  Since we are not huge meat eaters, I cut the amount of the chicken in half and added potatos.  I diced up the celery and carrots and onions in the food processor, which made it not so "lumpy" as my daughter would say.  Still kept the same great taste, though. The only negative thing I would say is that the biscuit mix that I used (Bisquick) is way too salty!!!  Try your own recipe instead!  Loved it anyway...

My husband and I made this dish together for his 88-yr old grandmother. Overall, the dish was OK but it was a bit on the spicy side especially for someone who has sensitive taste buds (i.e. my husband's grandmother, or children).
If I ever make it again I will be leaving out the pepper, to allow each person to control the "kick" of the dish on an individual basis.

This was wonderful!  I added a cup of chardonnay to the broth, and I also added about 8 large mushrooms cut on the thick side when I added the peas - another dimension of flavor.  WE LOVED IT!!  The biscuits were easy and cooked perfectly on top of the casserole.  Dumpling like on the bottom and crispy-biscuit like on the top.  This one's a keeper.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great. My kids love pot pie and biscuits, so this goes over very well with them. To make this even easier, use canned biscuits (e.g. "GRANDS").  Since the store biscuits are thick, you should bake them separate, rather than on top of the casserole.

This was delicious but in the "print full page" version of the recipe the vegetables were missing in the ingredients so I just guessed at quantities and lacked the celery. Also, four cups of chicken broth made the recipe a bit too thin.

I used some crushed red pepper and other spices to jazz it up a bit and it turned out really well. Nice and easy.

Really enjoyed this one. My kids are fussy about sauces so they wouldn't try it. I added 1/2 cup of wine to the sauce which gave it a nice flavour. The biscuits cooked nicely on top (not at all soggy like dumplings!)

Followed the recipe but used d
corn, potatoes, peas, and carrots. Used2 cups broth with a lot of chicken base to flavor plus 2 cups half and half. Didn't have celery so no worries. Have in one now but cream base was delicious!  I used chicken tenders, cooked fresh a d shredded then added. This is a keeper!

I decided to use the Pillsbury canned biscuits and cooked for the time the recipe states. what ended up happening was that the biscuits ended up dry. my suggestion would be to not cook more than 20 min of you're using canned biscuits. this particular can said to cook for 15 min. the recipe is still so delicious. definitely a keeper!

Home run!  This was excellent.  The only change I made was to use frozen beans instead of peas and to cut the basil to one tsp in the biscuits.  Excellent.  Will make it again for sure.

Good casserole.  We used leftover roasted chicken from store deli and added corn instead of peas.  I didn’t make patties with the biscuits just spread dollops on the top. Super easy and flavor is good. I’m thrilled that there is no can of cream of anything. :)

Was great! Family loved it! No leftover! Instead of making the biscuits I used Pillsbury biscuits. Cut the baking time down based on the colour of the biscuits. Was delicious!

It was fairly easy to make except it took longer than the recipe said it would to put it all together but It was well worth the wait.  We loved it and both went back for seconds!

Integrated some review suggestions from others. Used a little half and half instead of all chicken broth. Used frozen buttermilk biscuits rather than from scratch. One mistake I made, I put the frozen biscuits on the bottom and poured the mixture over the top. It got a little exciting when they started to rise!!!

I used frozen vegetables, instead of fresh carrots and canned peas, and I used Grands biscuits,  but I thought it was much too sweet, so use less sugar.

will make again. I made random minor changes. used a roll of store bought biscuits, and added diced potatoes. since I added the diced potatoes, I ended up adding a but more liquid so it wouldn't end up being too dry. I just added some cream of mushroom.

Success! I’m not a very experienced cook, but this turned out great for me. I followed some reviews and rather than baking, simmered on the stove and baked the biscuits separately (with some cheddar in the mix). Added a little milk with the broth, a few mushrooms and a zucchini I had in hand, along with the peas of course! Very creamy and yummy and pot pie like. Hubby loved it on a rainy winter night, thank you!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe! I used diced chicken breast and Bisquick instead of canned chicken, but followed the recipe other than that. I liked the taste and consistency but may use canned biscuits next time instead or maybe sweeten up the Bisquick.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband! I try to limit my salt intake so I didn't add the extra salt (just lightly salted the chicken breasts when cooking and the organic chicken broth had more than enough.) I used 3 chicken breasts, but I think I might add a fourth in the future. To add more flavor I added some cayenne pepper and lots of garlic and pepper.   When I make this again I'm going to use frozen peas instead of canned.  (slightly crunchier, less mushy)

Made as directed but cheated on the biscuit and used jumbo refridgerator store tube biscuits.  This was an amazing dish and will make again but I would want to try their biscuit recipe as well.  there is NOTHING I would change about this!!!

This made my 2 teenage boys very happy when I made it. I also made a beef version when I had leftover roast.

I loved this! It's herby and fresh, while being savory and filling. My husband and friends did not enjoy it, though, so it may be appealing to only a specific palate.

This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars.  I followed it pretty much as written.  I used darker meat chicken and the broth from it.  I have found that the darker meat makes for more flavor. I used 3 cups broth and 1 cup half and half for a creamier taste.  I made biscuits from my favorite recipe and used coconut oil in the biscuits. The basil in both the pie and in the biscuits made this outstanding.   I upped the temperature to 380 degrees and cooked for 30 minutes.  My family raved  about this. My chicken and biscuit recipe from now on!!

Loved it! Kids loved it! Made a few MINOR changes. Less sugar, I don’t like it too sweet; 3 cups broth, 1 cup milk and a little sour cream mixed in; used Pilsbury Flaky Biscuits cut in half horizontally and placed on top as a shortcut. ‘Grands’ would be good too.

Very simple and good recipe that can be tweaked to your family's taste. I used mixed veggies instead for peas. I used the drop method for the biscuits and it turns out great. The sauce can be used for other recipes as well.

I love how easy it was from start to finish...I even cheated! I mixed the ingredients and microwaved them in a covered casserole dish for ten minutes, stopping once to stir, then put it in a 9 x 13 baking pan, topped it with the biscuits, brushed the biscuit tops with butter and followed the rest of the instructions. Yummy!

My family loves this recipe! I use slightly more chicken than it calls for and instead of biscuit mix, I use canned biscuits. I put them on top for the last 20 minutes, covered with foil. Yum!

This was quite good!  I added potatoes & garlic to mine and instead of making the biscuits, used the canned variety.  I sauted the veggies in a cast iron pan, & simmered them with the chicken in the sauce then put the biscuits on top & baked it in the oven. Easy!!  Thanks for a great idea.

I made this pretty much the way it is written with one exception.  I had chicken breasts that I fried on the stove top and chopped into cubes.  I added some Osem consommé to the pan with the chicken broth.  I used a good pinch of pepper.  My biscuit batter was a little too sticky to make into biscuits so I spooned them on top like dumplings.  It was very good and I would make it again.  It reminded me of those Stouffer's pot pies I ate as a child.

Loved it!  I made a few shortcuts to save time.  Used a rotisserie chicken, added two small ears of corn on the cob for extra flavor.  Switched frozen peas for can peas, and cut down the broth just a little to make the sauce a little thicker.  Oh and used store bought large refrigerator biscuit dusted them with a little basil.  A wonderful quick dinner, and makes great leftovers!

Needs a bit more liquid. I added green beans too. Can add any veggies. Might bump up spices a bit. Used bouillon.

I'd probably leave the last teaspoon of basil out of the biscuits and maybe use a little less sugar in the casserole.

This was very good! I had some leftover turkey and chicken stock from thanksgiving and used it in the recipe in place of the chicken and broth. It was so good (my boyfriend could not stop eating it!). The only other change I did was I bought pre-made buttermilk biscuits and cooked them separately then poured my mixture over the biscuits, it worked well!

I tried to make this three times. On the second and third time I tried using adjustments that other people recommended but just couldn't get it to turn out right. The consistency and color were poor and per the recipe is very bland. All in all not good. I don't know how other people got 4 and 5 stars but I'm glad they did.

This recipe was a great starting point. I used this recipe and a combination of tips from comments to make my dish. For the chicken in this recipe, I bought a store-made rotisserie chicken and picked and shredded the meat. In place of the water/milk, I used two cans of Campbell's cream of chicken with mushroom soup. For the veggies, I used all fresh (no canned) vegetables. I cooked 3/4 cup each of onion, peas, string beans, mushroom, and corn in a saucepan with about 2 tbls of minced garlic. I added 2 pinches each of basil and rosemary. For the biscuits, I used the pre-made mix for the Red Lobster Brand Cheddar biscuits. I cooked in the oven for 30 mins. at 400 degrees. With about 3 minutes left, I poured the garlic/butter sauce that came in the biscuit box on top and let it finish. Tasted amazing! I precut and froze all my extra veggies, so I will have an easy time making it again.

Very good. Used herbs de Provence rather than just dry basil and fresh basil in biscuits.  Got my daughter to eat vegetables which is a rare feat indeed.

Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe except I made my own biscuit topping rather than using a prepared mix . Everyone in my house loved it!!

I took the advice of another reviewer and made the dish to the point of putting it in the casserole.  I baked canned biscuits in the oven (for ease sake) and just spooned the chicken mixture over the baked biscuits.  I added rosemary and used larger amounts of the suggested veggies but kept the sauce ingredients the same.  I made this dish to take to work for lunches and didn't relish the thought of soggy biscuits the next day.  I thought the chicken mixture was VERY good.  Thank you for the recipe!

It was good and I would make it again. I used frozen peas in place of canned peas. Next time I would use frozen mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, & peas).

We loved this one!  Total comfort food!  I made half the recipe, which was the perfect amount for Hubs and me with enough leftover for Hubs’ lunch the next day.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did the biscuits differently.  I had a box of Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuit mix in the pantry, so I made those as per the package directions.  I made the chicken mixture using water and bouillon because another reviewer mentioned that it was more flavorful than using broth.  I also used frozen peas that I had in the freezer.  I made the chicken mixture early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it.  I left it covered while reheating and baked the biscuits separately.  I served this with the biscuits on the side, along with a simple green salad.  The only change I would make next time is to bump up the veggies, maybe by half.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that it’s made with ingredients I normally have on hand.  This will be repeated again soon!  Thanks, CVERNSMITH, for the recipe!

This was absolutely DIVINE! I'm a single person so I halfed the recipe on the night that I had a guest over. Turned out like magic. 

I only made two tweaks: 
-Coconut oil instead of butter (Yay me! A little healthier). PS- I've made the recipe twice, and the first time I used butter. Couldn't tell a difference in the taste. 
-Made a little more biscuit batter because I love carbs, and I had to make up for me being healthy with the coconut oil haha.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I used store bought biscuit dough which made this recipe very, very easy.  To describe it, I'd say it was exactly like a pot pie.  Very delicious,  will add it to the recipe book.

What a crowd pleaser! This is my new go-to for when we have company - everyone loves this! This is an excellent recipe as it is.  I chose to also add some finely diced sweet potato.  Instead of using a buttermilk mix I baked the biscuits separately.

This was basically an okay recipe, but I found I needed to tweek it too much for it to be considered 5-star. I used frozen peas, not canned (I hate canned peas!) I cut the sugar in half, and included about 1 cup of diced potatoes in with the vegetables and butter.. After adding the seasonings (basil, salt and pepper) to the sauce, I found that it really needed more flavor. I added some dried parsley, marjoram, cayenne, thyme and sage (I did not measure; just to taste).  I did not add the basil to the biscuit dough. Instead I folded in about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, brushing the biscuits with melted butter about 15 minutes into the baking process. These changes elevated it to a more flavorful dish. Still don't know if it was a 5, but it was good.

This recipe is amazing. We make it pretty often and it really makes veggies much more enjoyable. We add very minimal salt cuz we don't eat many foods with any salt and it still tastes awesome. Id recommend it to others for sure

I have made this as is and I've made it with a few tweaks. It is good both ways, but for a quicker meal, I use the following tweaks. If you want to save a bit of chopping and won't miss the celery, you can add a bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, peas, and green beans). Omit the carrots and celery in the beginning. Cook the veggies according to the package and add when the recipes call for the peas. As for the biscuits, I do follow the recipe for making them, but do them as a drop biscuit instead. I just drop 10-12 smaller biscuits in the pan on top of the chicken/veggies. It works great with less mess. Just try to keep the biscuits as even in size as possible so they cook evenly. This is a favorite in my house, even with my picky-eater husband and five year-old daughter!

This was delicious! 
I made this last night for my husband, and kids, and a few friends and they LOVED it. 
I did (for some reason) add a little extra salt...dont so this. Everyone loved it but i thought it was a bit salty and next time i think i will make the Biscuits on the side and add a litttle cheese on top of the casserole. Either way, this recipe will definitely be made again in this house! Thanks, this is great(:

This turned out very tasty. The biscuits were dry on top but mixed in it was good. I added a splash of heavy cream at the chicken broth stage to cream it up a little. Other than that I didn't change anything.

It was very delicious .  Don't bother "flattening" out the sticky biscuits.  Just scoop and drop them onto the casserole.  They spread out and cover the dish as they bake.

Very good. Seemed too soupy at first, but in the end it was perfect. I halved the biscuits and cooked in an 8x8 and it was the perfect ratio. Fed our family of 4 with no leftovers.

Very easy to make and so delicious that my son and husband lick the pot bare! I never have leftovers with this. I made two little changes however. I do not bake it and I use Pillsbury biscuits.  I make the biscuits separately and do everything else on the stove top. Putting the biscuits on top of the chicken makes them too mushy and unpleasant to eat. Baking them separately and having them on the side however is perfect.

The chicken, veges and sauce were excellent. I agreed with another reviewer that the basil in the biscuits was a little strange and cooking the biscuits in with chicken just didn't work for me. Next time I will serve the chicken and veges over baked biscuits!!

Since my daughter was sick on the day that I made this, I had to make it a little bit quicker. The only difference between my recipe and this one was that I used pre-made pilsbury biscuits rather than making the dough. It worked perfectly! Delicious taste, and I will absolutely make it again.

This turned out really good! I made one small tweak by adding a chicken bullion cube based on some other reviews. I also made my biscuits separately and ladled the stew over top. Delicious!

I couldn't find buttermilk baking mix in the UK, so used plain "scone mix" from morrisons! I missed out the sugar in the recipe, and I'm glad I did. The recipe would have been too sweet with the sugar. The whole family loved this, I'll definitely make it again

I made a smaller portion & used asparagus in place of peas because that's what I had on hand. I also cheated & used Pilsbury Grands biscuits, so it only took about 22 minutes to cook. Very delicious!

This is an awesome recipe and always a hit. I always double the biscuit topping so the entire top is well covered. I also use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables which adds more variety and also requires no prep. I just add them to the broth frozen. Some chopped cilantro and 1/2 teaspoon or so of pepper flakes add a little extra kick to the dish. Fantastic!

Yummy, but I made some changes.  I used frozen peas and carrots, (which I par boiled), and added some frozen corn too,(also par boiled with the peas and carrots).
I used half the basil in the biscuit mix and also added a small amount of sugar, (1/2 tsp).
This is a great meal with a salad!  
Note: Doesn't reheat well as a leftover...needs more gravy before reheating.

This is delicious! As is, I only give it a four star rating. This is only because I really don't like the biscuit recipe. The change I make is to use canned biscuits instead. It bakes perfectly and is wonderful. With my canned biscuit adjustment, I give it five stars.

This was very simple to make and had a good flavor- I added additional chicken bouillon to match my families taste, but it was good enough as it was.  The ONLY major issue I found was the density/texture of the biscuits.  While we enjoyed finally getting biscuits that would cook through, and did not turn to mush in the pan, they were excessively dry and required saturation with the sauce.  Even then, when fully "doused", they were dry if made exactly as per recipe.  I will make this again because I like the taste and ease of preparation, but I will have to try an alternative version of the biscuits.  Another side note: the amount of peas added to the sauce can cause it to turn an unappetizing green color.  Be sparing in the amount added and avoid the "baby" peas, which seem to be the ones that crush and release color too easily.  All in all though, good job!

I liked this recipe because I was able to use all of my organic ingredients. I don't like using soup mixes for this reason.  I also didn't have time (or milk...lol) to make the biscuits so I used a can of biscuits I had in the fridge and just laid them on top.  I omitted the peas (have non-vegetable eating adults in the house) but added a few mushrooms.  It was fantastic!  Everyone loved it!

Terrific!  Will definitely make again.  Only change I made was to put it in a regular casserole dish and just dropped the dumplings by spoonful on top - no mess - made 8 dumplings.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was very delicious and simple to make. I used sweet and low instead of sugar. I tripled the amount of  pepper. I also used biscuits and added basil instead of making the biscuits from scratch.

So tasty!!! Loved every bite and could hardly wait for leftovers at lunch time the next day. Sautéed mushrooms with other veggies. Also used frozen peas. I didn't realized it required buttermilk mix but I did have TJs multigrain pancake/waffle mix. Followed same method for its biscuits with the basil included some garlic powder so it wouldn't taste too grainy. All of it turned out great. Thank you!!!

I love the basic concept-basic pot pie.  Went w/ a 1lb  pkg of frozen peas & carrots mix instead of canned peas.  Also, 3 tsp of dried basil in a dish of this size is too much--used the 1tsp in the gravy mix, but eliminated it entirely from the biscuits (consider the tube kind-l hate the mix). Turned out great, will try again!

Overall, the recipe was OK. 
Unless you're an avid garlic lover, the dish calls for way too much garlic cloves. Very overwhelming taste. 
Next, the recipe calls for four cups of chicken broth which again seemed too much. The casserole never was able to firm up. 
The taste was great... But resulted in a very garlicky soup with biscuits on top.

I loved it! I used Better Than Bouillion for the broth, so next time I would cut the added salt down to maybe 1/2 tsp or maybe no added salt, as it was a bit too salty for my taste. Used about a cup of frozen peas that I added during the simmering time plus a little dry sherry for added flavor, then just plopped spoonfuls of Bisquick biscuit dough I mixed up w/o basil as it is a bit strong for the kids' taste. Probably would be richer with the buttermilk, but the plain biscuits were fine in flavor.  Baked it for 30 min and it was great! I will make it again when my hubby is back in town! You could add a lot more veggies as long as you had enough gravy, plus you can flavor the biscuits in a variety of ways. Bon appetit!

Loved this recipe!  I made some slight changes. I used frozen peas as others recommended but also added frozen corn, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. I used a large rotisserie chicken which gave me exactly 4 cups. I used two tubes of the premade buttermilk busquits and used a throw away foil casserole dish. I baked uncovered for 30 minutes and that was enough. The additional time to cook was not needed due to using a precooked chicken. I will be making this often.

I have been making this recipe for 20 yrs & it's wonderful. I never have put in the sugar. I make it start to finish in a large skillet & top it with Pillsbury Grands Biscuits. Bake about 20 min. I also use just stock in a box & sometimes add cheeses before adding meat & veggies. Poultry seasoning or just about any other green herb will work. Great recipe, hope more people will start making it. Definitely 1 of my favorite go to's.

I made this tonight for my family. It was quite yummy. I used heavy cream in addition to chicken stock, and I used bisquick biscuits with basil, garlic powder, pepper and a small amount of shredded cheese. My only complaint is the peas. I used frozen and a small 4 serving bag was a bit too much. I do think frozen is better than canned just not quite as much as I used! Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I found it easier to make the biscuit topping by flouring my hands and patting the biscuits out individually.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and corn instead of peas.  I didn't have any chicken broth, so I simply boiled 4 cups of water and 4 chicken bullion cubes to make the broth.  Everything else, I followed the recipe.  EXCELLENT taste and creamy texture.  Great way to use up leftover chicken tenders.  Made more than enough for two people, plenty for four.

This is a fabulous recipe! Make it your own, is easy to adapt. Use frozen peas. I cheat and use canned biscuits. I cut a little chicken broth out, add 1/2C sherry and 1/4 half and half, 1/2C fresh parsley. I usually thicken it a little as well. Divine.

My kids and I both enjoyed this very much! I did make a few minor tweaks to the recipe, though. I used herbs de Provence  instead of basil. I used frozen peas and added frozen corn as well. I did not add sugar. I made Bisquick drop biscuits and omitted the basil from the biscuits. I used my cast iron skillet to make the chicken pot pie filling and dropped the biscuits on top. Into the oven with the skillet and baked as directed. Delicious!

I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and added fresh mushrooms.  Used frozen mixed vegetables.  Added fresh thyme because I had some on hand.  Left out the basil.  Used Jiffy Buttermilk Biscuit mix for the biscuits.  Great meal for a cold day!

Turned out great! Only change, i added poultry seasoning and diced potatoes! Definitely a keeper, i made chicken and biscuits for the very first time and it comes so close to the chicken pot pie filling from our local bbq restaurant!

Can't say I ever follow a recipe perfectly. I use them more or less as a guideline and tailor it to preference. The main thing I did was add more to make it hearty... 15 oz peas, and doubled all the veggies. Didn't measure the meat, just did four cooked breasts, I'd add two more next time. I also I Lu baked for thirty minutes uncovered. That worked perfect for how I made it, must be different following the recipe as is. The sauce is wonderful just how it is. I didn't have dried basil, so I used a dry mix of Italian herbs. I also had grands biscuits on hand, so I cheated there. This was so delicious! Totally hit the spot! Best part of all is I made two good-sized dinners for a family of three. Froze the extra mixture in an 8x8 baking dish and all I will have to do next time is top it with biscuits!

Yum! and easy to make. Followed a few recommendations from the other helpful reviewers, thanks:

1) I cut recipe in half because I'm cooking for 2 people (and we still had half the volume for leftovers).

2) I used frozen peas (bought Birds Eye "singles" packs and used only 1/2 that portion bag -- or whatever matches volume of other veggies).

3) For the chicken broth: I used half broth, half milk.

4) For the biscuits: 
--Made the full volume of mix (did not half that portion since most reviewers thought the full volume recipe didn't have enough biscuit).
--I used regular Bisquick blended with buttermilk (could have used a little more buttermilk, for a slightly moister biscuit).
--Just spooned biscuit mix onto the casserole; a little more than 1/8 cup per biscuit. This filled out perfectly in an 9x9 stone dish.

5) The dried basil spice was great; not overwhelming in the least; subtle but nice flavor (one reviewer thought it would be easy to overdo this spice...it wasn't a strong flavor so i can't agree).

Followed the same cooking time. Everything turned out great. My husband enjoyed it too. It's a keeper!

This is basically chicken pot pie not in a pie crust. I didn't do the biscuits on top, just made the chicken filling and baked my own biscuits separate. I added about 1/4 tsp. Poultry seasoning and used a rotisserie chicken. This made a huge pan, so I put the leftovers into a pie crust for chicken pot pie.

I made this with homemade buttermilk biscuits on top. (the recipe is on this site.) It was work to do it all from scratch, but we'll with it.  If you have a rainy cozy day at home, go for it.  So yummy.

This was just okay for us...made it exactly as written except used some fresh basil in the dish.  If I were to make it again, I would add more carrots as there were way too many peas.

My boyfriend went insane over this.  
(The only thing I did differently was that I did not add more basil to the biscuits because I prefer them plain.)

This was amazing!  I followed the directions exactly except I used a can of pre-made biscuits and used frozen pees (canned are gross).  The end results were creamy, flavorful and delicious!  Huge hit with the husband and kids.  I will be adding it to my regular rotation.  Yummm!!

This was a really great recipe!  I highly suggest trying it!  I only did a few things differently.  First, I did not want to use packaged Bisquick.  I used The Pioneer Woman's drop biscuit recipe that goes with her sausage gravy recipe.  I added the dried basil to that.  The biscuits were tender and flavorful.  I added more chicken than called for.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  This made it so easy!  I added a few more seasonings to the gravy/sauce according to some recommendations from other reviewers.  I added poultry seasoning and parsley.  Also, another reviewer suggested subbing some milk for some of the chicken broth. I used 1 c milk and 3 c chicken broth.  This was a winner!

I made this last night and it turned out great.  I increased all of the veggies a little - 2/3 cup instead of 1/2 - and used frozen peas.  I was worried because I live at a very high altitude and biscuits and baking are tricky.  But the biscuits were perfect!  I did not cover with foil the last ten minutes.  (I don't know how anyone can do all of the prep in just 30 minutes - it will take you longer).

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I made this for my east Texas in-laws and they raved about it.  If anyone knows good chicken pot pie it is them.  I did exchange 2 cups of chicken broth for 2 cans cream of chicken soup and I used grands frozen biscuits.   It was perfect.

This was really good! I stuck to the recipe exactly except I added a little chicken base to the chicken stock based on other reviews. The veggies and chicken were proportioned just right, and all 3 of my boys (hubby, 13 year old, and 5 year old) all got seconds! I've been told this recipe is a keeper in our house!

Comfort food! Absolutely loved it. Made it pretty much exactly as written. I used frozen corn, peas and Lima beans instead of canned peas though. Used broth from my crockpot chicken, which gave it Tons of flavor (I always put two bouillon cubes in my crockpot chicken). Family loved it. This recipe almost makes me think that I am a good cook! 
Thank you!

Delicious. Added a little extra garlic. Pepper amount was a bit spicy, but good. Reduce pepper if want it a little more mild. Just used canned carrots, and did almost twice the veggies called for. Cooked canned biscuits a bit (instead of using a baking mix), then put them on top of the casserole to cook the rest of the way.

I used half milk and half broth. The second time I made it I just poured it over warm biscuits. Otherwise all the liquid disappears. No baking required.

Great Base recipe to add your own spice/herbs/and veggies to! If you're feeling a little lazy due to a long day at work/university, just buy canned biscuits instead of making your own. You can also substitute a bag of frozen veggies for all the cans and sauteing.

Very good recipe for leftover chicken.  My only tweak next time may be to decrease the cooking time.   The biscuits looked done @ 30 minutes, but I followed the recipe and cooked for 40 minutes.  The biscuits ended up being a bit dry.

Family LOVED this!! The proportions are right on! I only varied due to what I had on hand..no basil, used italian seaoning. No frozen peas, micro'd some mixed vegies..boiled my chicken w/4 boullion cubes & onion powder.Needed to adjust the recipe for 10, as I feed 5 big eaters, but there were definitely leftovers even tho most went back for seconds!! Also baked the biscuits separately and left the chicken mix simmering on the stove just 'cos this family's got people coming & going at all different times..but, it a keeper for me!!

Yes I will make it again, I thought it was very tasty.  I did however make a couple of changes:  instead of adding any sugar I cooked one cob of corn, cut corn off the cob and added it instead of the sugar for sweetness and it was just perfect.  Also, I added only 1 tsp. of dried basil to biscuit mix instead of 2 (thank goodness!).  I think 2 would have been too overpowering considering there is also some in the chicken mixture.  Be careful when adding salt depending on what kind of chicken broth you use, I could see this being a bit on the salty side if not careful.  Also, I did not cover casserole with foil the last 10 minutes at all because my biscuits needed to cook just a bit more.  It really was delicious!

I made this recipe tonight and served it over Pillsbury biscuits.  It was absolutely delicious!  I added to the recipe 1 tsp of poultry seasoning and 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I will definitely make this again when I have leftover chicken.

Very happy to find this recipe, I had everything on hand.  Used canned mushrooms, still great.  I did use a baking mix for biscuits on the side, I love a crisp biscuit.

This dish is very easy to make and everyone in the house loved it! I have very picky eaters in the house which include a 14 year old and twin toddlers. Everyone cleaned their plates!

I just made this and it is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of leaving out the garlic because I can't eat it, and I used frozen peas) and it came out perfect. I read in a few of the reviews that people thought it was bland- not even close! Lot of flavor. The chicken I used was just boiled chicken breasts. And if you pat the biscuit mix with flour just like the recipe says, it doesn't stick at all and flattens out easily. Although, just as a test, I dropped some on without flattening and that works okay, too. I would definitely make this again.

Delicious! Added spices and seasonings as mentioned on other reviews and used Greek yogurt for half the butter. I made drop biscuits from this site and dropped them on before baking. Grandson asked for seconds!

This is so creamy and good!! I made a copycat version of bisquick for the biscuits and I admitadly used bullion cubes for the broth. It came out delicious! Very easy to make and great for a cold day!

Reposting because everyone else said this gets a 5 star review.I used this as a base for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I had some broccoli and cauliflower leftover from a veggie tray so I added that too. After adding the broth I thought the mixture was a but thin and so I added a can fat free cream of chicken and mushroom soup. Also added 1 tsp.  of poultry seasoning and 2 tbsp. of chopped fresh parley, once again leftover. Finally, instead of making the biscuits I used low fat Pillsbury grands to top a large casserole dish. The end result was a quick and efficient use of leftovers that could have been thicker.  Next time I'll try the recipe as posted.

Yum!  Followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good.  Will definitely make this again. Fun thing about this recipe is that you could change veg and herb and have a whole different meal.  Great way to use the leftover chicken.  I broke in my new stainless steel pan with this recipe and then just transferred the whole thing to the oven. No need to dirty another dish!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! This a real crowd pleaser! Next time I think I'll pre-chop the onion/carrot/celery/garlic mixture and put a few baggies of it in the freezer so it's all set to go when I want to cook with less fuss.

We really enjoyed this dish. I added canned corn and diced potatoes to the veggies and used frozen peas instead of canned. I also added poultry seasoning to the "soup" and shredded cheddar cheese to the biscuit mix, which I doubled. It was a bit of work, so I think next time I will make the soup portion in the crock pot and make the biscuits separate just before serving.

Loved the flavor but was short on sauce.  When I make it again, and I will because my 90 year old father all but liked the plate, I will double the sauce.  I cut up a rotisserie chicken, which was probably more than the recommended two cups, which could have soaked up some of the sauce.  Very good.

this was so amazing.. i adapted this to be for bf's lunch and added in a few things that i know he enjoys.. here's what i did for 3 servings/half recipe.. i was out of fresh garlic so i had to use powdered (1/2 tsp), added 1/4 c of canned corn, only used 1/4 c of frozen peas, halved the sugar, used italian seasoning for the basil, doubled the black pepper, and used Knorr's homestyle stock for the chicken broth, no biscuit mix so i used a little over 2 cups of dry egg noodles that i cooked.. i can't wait for bf to get home to try how awesome this is.. ty for the recipe

This was a great recipe. Rather than fresh carrots and peas, I threw in frozen mixed veggies. Wonderful and my family can't wait for me to make this again. I am sure it would be great with leftover turkey too!

A little bit too peppery for me, but my family really enjoyed this - it's made its way into my handwritten recipe box at their request. I made this recipe with chicken bullion instead of broth and seasoned the chicken with poultry rub before I baked it for added flavor.  Otherwise, the only change I made was to substitute mashed potatoes for the biscuits (a great way to use up leftovers). A bag of shredded cheese on the table to sprinkle on top if desired completed the meal to rave reviews. It took a little longer to make than I anticipated,  but that's often the case when I try a new recipe. I'm sure I'll speed up as I make it more often. Hopefully next time I will be able to try it with the biscuits. I also really like the fact that this dish doesn't involve dumping a can of "cream of something" soup into it to make a thick, flavorful sauce/filling. I have quite enough of those types of recipes already. Excellent dish!

I made this for dinner this week and my family LOVED it. My child who doesn't like chicken cleaned her plate! I made homemade biscuits instead of using a mix, and did not add basil to them. Refrigerator biscuits would work well for this too if you don't have mix and don't make your own. It is a great way to use up leftover chicken, especially after roasting one whole.

Everyone loved this. Had leftover chicken baked with montreal seasoning and used carrots, peas and corn.  Also used canned biscuits instead of baking mix.  It was done about 10 minutes sooner than recipe stated.

Very good recipe.  I would use just a pinch of sugar since the onions and carrots have a natural sweetness to them, especially when cooked.

Everyone in my family loved this.  I served over noodles.  I kept one part of the casserole free of meat for a vegetarian and added chick peas instead.  I would recommend adding more veggies and I did use olive oil instead of butter, otherwise, perfect!

I did take the advice of other reviewers and added poultry seasoning. I used Pillsbury Honey Buttermilk Biscuits. I am not usually a fan of this type of food but I tried it because my husband is and the reviews were so good. I don't care for gravy or gravy-like consistencies, but this flavor was outstanding! It is most certainly a keeper and I will definitely do it again! (I also cheated and used canned chicken since it shreds so easily and that made this a very simple dish!) Great weekday meal! Even my two picky kids loved it. Yum! Yum! Yum!

I thought this was awesome.  It was great to find a recipe that wasn't dump a can of soup and put biscuits on top of it.  I was so happy when I took it out of the oven and saw how big the biscuits got.  I did some of the prep work the night before to make it easier for me.  I cooked the chicken and put it in a container.  I chopped up all the veggies that it called for and put them in an other container.  My husband is always skeptical of new recipes.  But he told me he loved it.  He told me it is a keeper!  I am always looking for ways to get away from processed food.  I even make my own bisquick.  Thank you for a wholesome recipe!

I double the recipe for great leftovers.  This is excellent as is, but I usually add corn.  I just tried it with turkey, instead of chicken, since we had leftovers from Thanksgiving and it was even better in my opinion, but I'm a huge fan of turkey pot pie, and this makes a delicious modified turkey pot pie.

Wow! Got two thumbs up from hubby.  This was very tasty, a rich pot pie filling.  I used refrigerated biscuits because I had them and it saved a few minutes prep time.

Overall this turned out really good. My family liked it and went back for seconds.  Changes I made: omitted the sugar, swapped thyme for the basil (personal preference), and used refrigerated biscuits.  When the gravy was done, it wasn't as thick as I would like so I used a bit of corn starch to thicken it up before pouring it into the casserole dish.  I will definitely make this again.

I have tried this recipe twice now.  Very good!  I think baking the chicken in the oven yourself is the best way to prepare the cooked chicken.  Rub oil, salt and pepper on 2 to 3 chicken breasts (skin on, bone in). Place on silicone baking sheet on baking pan.  Bake at 400 degrees for 25 to 40 minutes (until thoroughly cooked).  Remove pan from oven and let cool.  Skin slides right off, then you can hand-pull bite size pieces of chicken to use in this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious.  The one change that we made was to use store biscuits (to save time) and instead of just putting them on top, we put some on the bottom of the pyrex.  OMG!!  Heaven.  Like pot pie meets a pyrex casserole dish...YUM!

This was just ok. I guess Im not a big casserole person. It reminded me too much of bland food I was forced to eat as a kid. Decent enough for a meal, but not something I would crave later. I give one extra star for the use of chicken stock and flour instead of a can of campbell's cream of chicken soup.

this was a good basic recipe. It can be used as a base for other dishes, such as chicken a la king, chicken pot pie. I made it without the sugar,  Instead of adding dried basil, I used a Tuscan flavored broth infused with thyme, basil and rosemary. The seasonings were subtle but improved the flavor. I skipped the biscuit topping and served it with a side of mashed potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper and fresh grated nutmeg. I also mashed them with butter and heavy cream. It was a nice, easy comfort food meal for a rainy night. Next time I may make this as a chicken pot pie adding some mushrooms and diced potatoes.

I have to give it 5 stars because all six family members from 5 to 86 liked it. (That rarely happens in my house!) I exchanged peas for chopped left-over green beans and used half milk half broth and had no basil so used oregano instead and had to make biscuits from scratch because of no Bisquick on hand.

This was REALLY good. However, I should note that I went with another reviewer's suggestion of using a cup of half & half (1/4 of the broth ingredient) to 3 cups chicken broth. Made it rich and creamy, which is the way I like this kind of dish. I noticed another reviewer's comment that her biscuits soaked up all of the 'gravy' but also noticed that she said she used drop biscuits. I would like to point out that using drop biscuits *will* soak up the gravy, which is possibly why this recipe suggests rolled biscuits instead. I would go with the biscuits the recipe states or make your biscuits separate rather than baking them with the chicken mixture. This would also be great over mashed potatoes or toast.

Good recipe, but after reviewing others I make some changes. I used very big frozen biscuits and it added to much dough, but I think with regular size biscuit it would be a 4.5 star.

This was very good. I didn't have buttermilk biscuit mix, but instead I made my own biscuits.  I might try adding some (partially cooked) cubed potatoes next time.

Excellent comfort food recipe!  Plenty of flavor! Easy to make; I just used frozen mixed vegetables, including frozen biscuits.  The only suggestion I have is to make the biscuits separately & add to meal when done; if you don't want the biscuits to be soggy/mushy.  But all- in- all my 9 yr old loves it! :)

I altered the recipe based on what was in my pantry.  I used 2 boneless chicken breasts and covered them with a lid when I cooked them to contain the moisture, which I then substituted for part of the chicken broth.  I didn't have peas or onions so I doubled both the celery and the carrots and added onion powder when I mixed in the flour.  I used half the butter and added it in slowly so it wouldn't cook away.  I only used 1/4 cup of flour and 1 3/4 cup chicken broth.  I added 1/4 cup white wine.  I did not use any sugar.  I halved the dough recipe, and because I hate how sticky it gets, I just dropped it on top like little drop biscuits.  I added some crumbled Ritz crackers on top for a little extra crunchiness, although I am not sure that they made that much of a difference.  I cooked it uncovered for 30 minutes at 350 in a slightly smaller casserole dish.  I am not sure how my version compares with the original, but my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I give the recipe five stars just because it was so flexible and turned out so well in spite of my alterations.

This was delicious! So much better than recipes that use canned soup! I added some more frozen veggies (green beans, peas and corn) and left out the celery. Great as leftovers too, just store the biscuits separately so they don't soak up all the gravy.

My husband had three helpings and my 3-year-old had two. Instead of using a mix for the biscuits, I used Fannie Merritt Farmer's recipe for biscuits from scratch. I also put the basil in with the chicken mixture instead of in the biscuits.

This is a great recipe! Thank you for sharing!
I made some changes based on reviews, I cooked three chicken breast halves in 4.5 cups of water to which I added 4 bullion cubes, onion, celery and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables once boiling. I took the chicken breasts out once cooked through, let them cool a little while and shredded them. I then sauteed more onions, fresh minced garlic and green peppers in the butter, once cooked I added the flour and then mixed it all into the broth from the chicken with the vegetables and added the chicken, mixed it all up and put it in a round casserole dish and topped it off with a can of refrigerated biscuits. It was absolutely amazing, the kids loved it and requested that I make it again!

I tried this recipe on a night I had no idea what to have for dinner! It came together perfectly. I accidentally added 1 Tbsp basil instead of 1 tsp basil to the sauce. It worked! I also made homemade biscuits instead of a premeasured mix and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and then the last ten at 370. This thickened up nicely and the basil biscuits were a great touch. Best chicken in pot to casserole pie ever!!

Absolutely perfect comfort food! My whole family loved it. I never have biscuit mix on hand so I made my own recipe but otherwise followed the directions exactly and it was right on.

Made this tonight again and told my husband this is the best dinner I make. It is so good and easy to put together.  I use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store which makes it even more easy.  It is great comfort food!

Great easy recipe. I added about 1/2 tbsp of poultry seasoning, a dash of cayenne, herbs provence (in place of basil), some potatoes and 2 chicken bullion cubes and it turned out great. We actually cooked this in a cast iron stew pot on the grill (since it is too hot to cook things in the oven today) and it worked beautifully!

This recipe was pretty good... However, i could have used some more of everything because we ended up running out of the mixture and only having the dough left. My husband was a little "iffy" about eating this but really enjoyed it!

The flavor was outstanding! This is a perfect weeknight meal! I think the homemade biscuits are an unnecessary step though. I used a tube of refrigerated biscuits instead. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and absolutely loved this casserole. I sent the recipe to my mom, and it was a hit for the entire family! The basil is what makes it so flavorful. We used Bisquick mix for the biscuits. It turned out perfect. Next time I want to try corn and a little more onion.

Made this tonight for the family.  I took the easy route and bought the frozen precut celery, onion, and carrots, frozen precut chicken breasts, frozen peas and canned biscuits!  We loved it!  Filled up the belly good. :)

I thought this recipe was great.  Made some changes to it.  Did not bake it in the oven.  Simply baked up some refrigerated biscuits and poured the chicken mixture over the biscuits.  Made a great comfort meal for our family!

Really good comfort food recipe.  I didn't do exact measurements for the vegetables so probably used closer to 3/4 C each of the onion, carrots and celery.   May try adding sliced mushrooms next time.  Yummy!

I made some minor changes like using frozen peas, and biscuits from a can, based on what I had on hand and was a bit quicker, but this was delish!  I am a picky cook and my hubby is a picky eater and we both really enjoyed this.  The basil just perfects this dish.

Thank you so very much for submitting this recipe! THIS is definitely one of the best meals that I have ever made. I took the advice of other submissions & added some frozen corn. Turned out WONDERFUL, althought I'm sure it would have been wonderful either way! My 12 yr old daughter told me that I needed to make this more often LOL!

We love this recipe at my house. Like others we use the chicken bouillon cubes instead of the broth and frozen peas instead of canned and we add frozen okra - YUM. To make it faster and a bit easier we also use a rotisserie chicken and frozen biscuits that I bake separate and just pour the "gravy" over. Comfort Food at it's finest!

This is yum, yum, yummy. I followed other reviewers' advice and added about a cup of half and half in place of some of the chicken broth and used store-bought biscuits on the bottom of the pan.

My fussy kids and husband gobbled it all up!

This recipe is great.  My husband is very picky about chicken and biscuits and he loved this.  I made absolutely no modifications.  This was perfect the way it is.  Loved the addition of the basil to the baking mix.

Excellent!  I changed a couple of things, and my family (DH, DD-3y/o) was begging for more! I skipped the peas as no one in my family likes them and used organic vegetable stock instead of chicken. It was incredible!

Excellent recipe to make for the fall/winter. I excluded the sugar as a personal preference, so I don't know what the original recipe tastes like. I also tried the recipe by making it on the stove top (cook and simmer for two hours) and baking the biscuits separately and it is just as good. If you use low salt broth, increase the salt to 1-1/2 or 2 tsp. Highly recommend it!

I prepared this dish exactly as the recipe stated.  It turned out okay.  My teenage daughter didn't love it, but my husband thought it was ok just without the biscuits.  I thought it was a bit too thick and too salty.  I make a chicken pot pie from scratch that everyone (including myself) thought was waaay better and since they are similar I will stick with my pie.  Thank you for sharing.  I think we just didn't like the seasonings.

I was really happy with this recipe.  I upped the amount of each of the veggies and used frozen peas.  I boiled the chicken and chopped it into 1/2" pieces.  I loved the basil in the biscuits.  This was a  very easy recipe to make and look forward to making it again.  I think I will make two pans for our next big family gathering.

Absolutely wonderful! I didn't have any buttermilk biscuit mix, so I used regular bisquick and also added an extra garlic clove, just because I love garlic.  It came out great and my husband and 10 yr old son love it!  My husband is begging me to save some for him when he gets back from guard drill this weekend...i don't know.....!

My sauce didn't thicken up enough and to me it was way too much chicken and not enough veggies.  Flavor was good, but more like chicken soup with biscuits.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and got rave reviews from the family, which I'm passing on as 5 stars! This was such a tasty dish. Thanks for the recipe. My mother liked this so much she suggested this become an alternate for when we need to take a covered dish to a function (high praise indeed ;-)).

This is very easy to make as well as delicious. Instead of using celery, I used a potato. And I made it thicker by reducing the amount of chocken broth by 1 cup. I just made it last night, and my family is already asking me to make it again!

I liked this recipe and will be bringing the leftovers to work this week.  I left out the sugar, carrots, and peas.  I doubled the celery and added diced potatoes, canned mushroomsm, artichoke hearts, a dash of lemon juice, and cooked wild rice.

Made this with veggies on hand including corn and 2 cups of cooked rice from the day before, used "Biscuit Baking Mix" from this site and scaled it down to 3 servings. Otherwise followed directions exactly. Thanks!

This has become a monthly staple in my home. I tend to add about 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe calls for, as I prefer thicker gravy.

I don't like how it is so soupy. I prefer it a little bit thicker and creamier...I think next time I try this, I will add corn and other veggies that I like...maybe try adding mash potatoes as one lady suggested on here. I bought refrigerated biscuits to bake, I think that it makes a difference (in a bad way). My fault on that one.

Urgh.  Came out too salty, despite the fact that I didn't put in the whole teaspoon of salt.  Likely due to the cheap chicken concentrate I used for the broth, and the fact that the cooked chicken probably had salt on it already.

Delish, I pretty much followed the recipe, and thought it was very tasty! The whole family loved it. The only thing I would change is to omit some salt, but that is purely a matter of taste.

Wonderful recipe!  The only changes I did was to use chicken boul and water and added a few mushrooms that I needed to use up.  Awesome, will be making it again soon!

Mmmmm....this was so good & comforting.  I realized a little too late that I forgot to add the peas but it was really good without them too.  Next time I'll be sure to add them.  I did salt & pepper the chicken prior to cookin it.  I used 1/2 the butter amount and a little evoo to saute the veggies in.  I also used the lowfat bisquick.  Excellent recipe with minimal effort!  Thanks.

I used the refrigerated biscuits on top, substitued some of the chicken broth with some heavy cream (about 1 cup), made sure the celery, onions and carrots were all roughtly the same size.  My 8yr old loved it, sent the left overs to my dad's and now he wants it once a week!  This is delish!! Thank you!

I made the filling as described - with a few more veggies.  Used a whole onion, about a cup of baby carrots and 3 celery stalks.  I also used frozen peas, which I thawed out - always have those on hand.  It thickened up beautifully and was quick to make.  All told, this meal took about 20 minutes to make because I just made the filling for the casserole, baked up some biscuits and served the filling over the biscuits.  It was yummy!!  And fast...

Based on taste alone, I would give this recipe a 5.  However, I had some trouble with the biscuit part.  When I mixed the portion of liquid to baking mix called for in the recipe, it was far too sticky to make balls.  Instead, I just dropped portions of the biscuit dough on top of the chicken mixture.  It came out just fine.  Even my picky husband loved it.

I loved this recipe the only thing I altered from the original is using frozen peas instead of canned. My picky husband even enjoyed this! Next time I make this I willreduce the salt to 1/2 or 3/4 tsp. Other than that it will be made exactly the same:) Tomorrow the leftovers will be served over egg noodles!

This was pretty good... lots of basil. I think I will look for a different recipe with some more variety of spices. I made my own biscuits, so I this review is just on the gravy, veggies mixture.

This is always a favorite for my family and have pleased many guests with it.  The only change I made was to use jumbo refrigerator biscuits instead of the homemade biscuits.

Very tasty but I gather there are probably easier ways to make this recipe. I used Pillsbury biscuits instead of attempting to make these and had a good result. :)

Followed the recipe as directed but used 4 cubes of chicken bullion w/ 4 Cups water in lieu of using the chicken broth and I added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper since I like my food spicier. Since I was cooking for 5, I opted to make 5 bigger biscuits instead of the 6-8. It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it!

I prepared this with rotisserie chicken that I needed to use up and swapped frozen corn for the peas.  I tasted for seasoning and flavor all along the way and have to admit the recipe is rather bland.  I added additional poultry seasoning, lots of pepper, extra garlic and added thickened it w/ addition cornstarch/water mixture.  With all that, at the very end I added about 1/2 cup sour cream to the mixture for extra creaminess and to boost the thickness even more.  After those adjustments it was good, but still not over the top.

I turned it into a beef and biscuits pie.  I had leftover crock pot roast with really yummy drippings.  I used 1/2 cup of drippings and 3 1/2 cups water instead of the chicken stock.  I left out the basil.  I cooked biscuits in the oven at the same time and served it biscuits and gravy style- fabulous!  And the meet and veggies stayed tender and not over cooked. Meal was ready in half the time.

Easy AND delicious, and I keep these ingredients on hand.  I cut the recipe in half since I wasn't cooking for a crowd.  I substituted Mrs. Dash and Green Beans because I was out of basil and peas.  I even used a heart-healthy baking mix- I just dropped it over the top instead of shaping actual biscuits. I cut down the cook times by a few minutes because of the smaller portion.   The liquid thickened up nicely- it definitely had that rich, creamy taste- without the extra fat and calories.  This would be a delicious way to use up a rotisserie chicken (or leftover turkey).  Perfect dish for a cool fall/winter meal.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Really enjoyed this one.   I added corn and mushrooms since I had them and needed to use them up.  The mushrooms were a great addition.  Next time I will add more carrots.  Overall very good.  I still like pot pie better, but this is an easy alternative.

Wow!  I can't believe how good this is.  I am not someone that likes to mix my food together and I'm not a casserole person.  I made this for a sick neighbor and ended up eating some myself!  I used corn, carrots, celery and potatoes because that's what I had on hand.  I also made buttermilk biscuits and flattened them a bit and added to the top.  I didn't have a mix so my biscuits were scratch.  I brushed with butter and omitted the last fifteen minutes covered with foil.  It didn't need it.  I'll make this one again!

My whole family LOVES this recipe! I have made this many, many times.  But I always use oregano instead of basil(just my personal preference). Sometimes I make the biscuit topping, sometimes I cheat and use big, buttery, canned biscuits.  Either way, this is comfort food at its best!

This was good!  I added a little frozen corn and some parsley flakes and poultry seasoning.  Still a little bland.  Maybe add some more herbs next time but I will make it again!  Maybe add some mushrooms next time too.

I give this recipe 4 stars to average out the family concensus, I would give it 5 stars and everyone else probably a 3.  Will change up the veggies to whet appetites more next time.  Thanks for the springboard recipe!

Most of us *loved* my version of this (my "biscuits" ended up being batter poured over the chicken mixture). DH, though, thought it would be better with a true pie crust and made as a chicken pot pie.

Yummy!  Made the biscuit mix w/ "Biscuit Baking Mix" on this site & substituted corn for the peas.  Perfect!  I like this much better than chicken pot pie.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the biscuit part. I used a can of big flaky buttermilk biscuits instead. Also, I doubled the recipe since I was doing all the chopping anyway and put the second batch (not the biscuits) in the freezer for another day. My family loved it. We will definitely be having this again.

WOW WOW WOW!!!! We loved this! I only modified in the slightest ways. Out of laziness, I used the pillsbury buttermilk pre-made biscuits. Say what you will, but they are always good. =) For the chicken, I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, and poured the juices at the bottom of the pan into the casserole mixture. In place of the basil I used my favorite dry spice blend " Herbs de Provence" which consists of rosemary, marjoram, basil, bay leaf, thyme and lavender. I use it for nearly everything. I also added 1/2 tsp of chicken soup base which probably didn't do anything, but I thought I would include it in the review. 

I can't wait to make this again. THANK YOU!!

Super easy recipe that is hard to mess up.  I cheated a little by using Pilsbury Grands biscuits, but they are my favorite and I knew they would be yummy with this casserole.  Also used frozen peas.  My biscuits browned by 20 minutes so I covered with foil and cooked for 20 minutes instead of 10.  I will probably increase the quantity to 8 servings.  The biscuits are so thick that it needs a little more filling.

I did not care for it but that was b/c I used turkey & have decided I don't think I really like turkey that much anymore...Anyways, they said it was fantastic & I will be making again with chicken.  Rather than fresh veggies, I used a bag of frozen veggies that I would have used in a pot pie & forgot the onion.

Mmmmmmmm! This was awesome!  I have been searching for a dish like this but not having much luck with other recipes - very bland...but this was delicious!  I actually used the suggestion of potato topping which I think would make it more filling then biscuits but I definately plan on trying the biscuits next time!  My 18mo old and 4yo loved it too so that's a bonus!  I planned on saving some for my mom to try but....no leftovers!!

Really good casserole.  I also added poultry seasoning and used heavy cream and 2 small potatoes to thicken it up a bit.  I did not use flour.  I used cornstarch instead.   I did not add any sugar .  All in all it was very good.   Next time I will not add basil to the dumplings.  I found the basil too overpowering.**EDIT** Made again on 3/15/11 ~ Made this on the stove top did not put into oven at all. I used leftovers from a roasted chicken I made a couple of nights ago.  Took all the meat off the bones and chopped up and threw into the pot.  The additional flavors from the roasted chicken really add a nice level of flavor to the whole meal. Also, I used a dumpling recipe from the Bisquick box and topped the chicken stew with those instead of baking biscuits in the oven. Really preferred it this way.  Again I did not add any sugar and added a bit more broth as to make it soupier. Still very good blend of ingredients and sooo comforting on a cold winters day. Thanks Again !!!

This was sooo good!  I also added some diced, peeled potato.  Might have made it somewhat thicker but we really liked it.

This was pretty good. I strayed a bit from the recipe... 1)I cut the recipe in half and used a 8 in square pan. There's just two of us and it was enough for dinner and lunch the next day for us both. 2)I added 3 diced new potatoes, frozen corn, and diced mushrooms and omitted the celery because we don't like it. 3)I used canned biscuits. They worked great and it was way easier than making my own. Overall, this was a quite tasty and relatively easy dish! I'll definitely make this one again.

I really liked this recipe. I did make a few changes to make it lower in fat. I used smart balance spread, whole wheat flour, and heart smart bisquick with nonfat milk. It turned out excellent.

A very basic, wholesome chicken recipe without the processed taste of cream of chicken soup that I always avoid!!!  Delicious and I used fresh basil which gave it some nice flavor.  Great.

This was pretty good. Instead of making the biscuits I went to the store and bought some. They did great! I was thinking that after awhile the biscuits would be soggy, but they weren't. I would make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked three cups of raw cut up chicken breasts in the butter.  I removed the chicken and cooked the vegetables.  I also used premade biscuits and homemade chicken broth.  This was absolutely delicious.  My in-laws told me it was a keeper and asked me to make it again some day.  I definitely will.  I fed 6 adults and three children with this dish.

This was very tasty. My husband loved it and so did I. I used bisquick to make the biscuits since I have a milk allergy. I used a milk substitute when making the biscuits and they were very tasty. I used left over chicken from a whole roasted chicken. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Delicious!! Not to thin, and the biscuits came out perfectly cooked, all the way through. I substituted 2 cans of cream of chicken soup for the chicken broth mixture, and added rosemary leaves, basil and some pepper. I also added some fresh chopped broccoli instead of canned peas. Next time though, I think I will leave out the celery (too much crunch) and try it with potato and peas. All in all, very flavorful and filling! A recipe I will be using frequently!

I've made this twice now, once with the canned biscuits and once with them from scratch.  The one with them made from scratch were much better.  I doubled the carrots, celery and onion and used almost two cans of broth and one cup of whole milk.  (2/3 C broth in the biscuits and the remaining liquid in the "gravy").  Much better with the milk than straight broth!

Really, really good. My husband just loved it and ate 3 servings of it himself. Too bad cause I was hoping for leftovers. The only change I made was to use frozen peas and carrots. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!!!  I used cooked chicken thighs as the chicken-  I boiled them in a bit of water with some spices, and used that broth for the broth called in the recipe. I used oregano, chili powder, cumin, red pepper, salt and pepper. This recipe was seriously good.

This was a great recipe.  I did, however, customize it for our tastes.  I made homemade biscuits for the top b/c anything with homemade biscuits is simply better.  I also used corn in place of the peas b/c my husband doesn't care too much for peas.  All in all it was a big hit and I will definitely have to make again.

This is very good comfort food. I added a packet of chicken gravy mix to the sauce and I used frozen green beans instead of peas. I used frozen biscuits.  You can do a lot with this recipe to personalize it but the bottom line is it's  a keeper!

Not bad but not too flavorful. Tastes better as leftovers once the "sauce" has thickened in the fridge overnight.

This was excellent. I also reduced the amount of chicken broth by 1/4 and added cream instead. i reduced the amount of basil in the biscuits as I thought it was a little too much for my taste. I added a little garlic powder to the biscuits instead and they were great!!

I made this recipe with quite a few changes. But the base of it was so delicious! I planned on baking this and pouring over biscuits, but once everything was added, it was perfect. I used onion and garlic powder with the butter, carrots and celery. Then I added the broth (water and bullion)and added a huge potato cut up. Then the peas. Finally the chicken was added and it was done. I simmered it while I made biscuits and it was thick and soooo wonderful! This is a keeper for sure!

This was great. I used water and boullion cubes instead of broth and didn't add peas. We really liked it. There did seem to be quite a bit of basil-especially in the biscuit dough, but we like it that way.

This was fantastic. I had some fresh yellow squash that I cut up & threw in with the veggies. I didn't have any canned peas, so I used some frozen mixed veggies. For the biscuits, I used store bought. I quarterd them, and flattened them a little. I let the casserole cook for 30 minutes & then layerd the biscuits on top to cook for the last 10 minutes.

This is a great recipe!  My family loves it every time I make it.  It's a great way for kids to enjoy eating veggies.  The only thing I do different is make homemade biscuits.

The recipe for the chicken-mixture is very good!  Great flavor with all the veggies.  I used leftover grilled chicken that was marinated in Itailian dressing.  I used my own biscuit recipe.

Great recipe to use up leftovers on.  We chopped up fried chicken and corn on the cob (instead of peas) and it turned out great.  My biscuits were kind of dry on top though.

Super good casserole! Since I was a little short on time I substituted an already cooked herb roasted chicken purchased at our local supermarket and cut this into pieces for the casserole.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. There were generous portions.  My husband did not allow me to send leftovers home with one of my kids who was here for dinner.  He said she had to make her own!  So I emailed her a copy.  Definitely will make this one again.

This was a very good meal for a cold night.  Very comforting.  I didn't use celery but added a little pultry seasoning to the veggie mixture.  I also used regular carrots and leeks chopped well.  This was even tastier the second day.

Loved it- wonderful wintertime recipe. My family liked the basil flavor. I increased the carrots to 1 cup, used frozen peas and low salt chicken bullion with water. Next time will double the amount of biscuits.

an excellent and easy recipe. this has delighted my family several times.  the only problem i have had is that when i made it the first time exactly according to the recipe, it was far too salty.  if you are using regular chicken broth, omit the salt completely.  i now use a low-sodium broth and a pinch of salt and it's perfect.  i've also substituted different vegetables with great results.

Excellent! I omitted the celery and added a potato and a pinch of celery salt. The basil really gave it a wonderful flavor. What a treat to have the basil in the biscuts as well...We will definitly be having this again. Thanks!!

This is an excellent family dinner.  A great way to use up left-over Thanksgiving turkey and aging vegetables.  My kids love it!  UPDATE: I've made this with bouillion and with freshly made chicken stock. No surprise that the stock "made" the dish. Also, I omit the basil in the biscuits and in the stew, use frozen peas, and add a generous amount of poultry seasoning. I put this is a deep, round casserole dish, and a couple of individual casserole dishes. I wanted more stew to biscuit ratio. Then I dropped small biscuits on top and baked for 20 minutes. The biscuits were done, and since I had sauteed the veggies until they were tender, there was no need to cook longer. One tip: make sure to season the stew with salt and pepper before you top it with biscuits, unless you want to let people move their biscuits aside to season it themselves.

I really like this, but my kids weren't crazy about all the basil. 2nd time, I cut the basil in half, and used a different crust. The Best Ever Pie Crust from this site. Excellent!   Tasted like my grandma used to make. I also used frozen peas instead of canned.

This was a great recipe!  I added potatoes and green beans in addition to doubling the veges.  The dough for the biscuits was stickey, but turned out perfect.  Also, I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder in the biscuits and a tablespoon on dried parsley instead of the basil.

This was an excellent recipe.  If you like the old fashion pot pie this is a recipe for you.  For the peas I used a frozen package of peas thawed out.  For the buttermilk baking mix I used Bisquick. If you have hungry men it might not serve 6. I was getting complaints I didn't make more!!  
Will definitely make again. Thanks Cydni!!  :)

Enjoyable and easy, if not particularly memorable.  I added a diced potato and fresh, chopped broccoli at the recommendation of some other reviewers.  We enjoyed the basil in both the sauce and the Bisquick biscuits, and didn't find it too strong as some other reviewers did.  A good use of leftover chicken and the veggies on hand.

The casserole was very tasty. However, the biscuits (I used pillsbury refrigerator biscuits like others) did not cook all the way through. The part in the casserole juice was raw (and it cooked for 40 mins). I also think the casserole was soupier than it was supposed to be but I used the correct amount of flour/broth.  I would make this recipe again but maybe bake the biscuits separately. I might also reduce the broth by 1 cup next time.  This got so many great reviews...What did I do wrong?

My husband loved this and has asked for it again.  I used 1/4 teaspoon garlic (out of cloves), no celery( none on hand), frozen peas, added mushrooms and used only 1 teaspoon of basil in the dough instead of two.

I have been using this recipe for a long time; I just now got a log-in and can rate it.  I have to say a HUGE thanks to Cyndi!  :)  I don't use the biscuit topping, but rather a pie-crust topping (no pie crust on the bottom though).  I add a little extra basil to the filling since there isn't any on the top.  This is SOOO yummy.  Everyone who eats it thinks I am a genius! :) SO much better than the ol' cream soup "homemade" potpie!

I doubled this recipe for my family dinner party. It was a great hit with everyone. I had to get the recipe to my mother, sister and daughter. I made it a day ahead, and I think it was even better.

I cut down the basil, used green beans instead of carrots.  I didn't put any basil in the biscuits.  I made homemade because I didn't have a mix.  I also  used ground chicken and browned it before adding it to the
sauce.  We enjoyed the recipe. I will make again.

My family thought this was great! We did think it had just a bit too much basil for our tastes, so next time I will cut back just a little. Definitely put some in though! It really does make a huge difference. This will be added to my regular routine of recipes! Thanks!

This was pretty good but I think I would have left out the dried basil.  I did appreciate the fact that it was a more healthy alternative to some of the pot pie recipes.

This casserole was relatively easy and tasted good. I felt that the basil was somewhat out of place, I wouldn't use it next time in this dish, and I neglected to put any in the biscuit mix.  This is a great winter dish, I'll be making it again, just using different herbs than basil.

Good, but too much basil for my taste.  I cut  the butter down to 1 Tbl. (would do that again!).  I added 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning, and omitted the sugar (didn't think it needed any sweetness).  Instead of 4 cups broth, I used 3 cups broth + 1 cup milk (skim was fine).  I also used 1/2 of a 12-oz pkg of frozen peas (no need to simmer 5 minutes if they are thawed).  I think next time I will decrease the flour to 1/4 cup - was able to taste the flour with 1/2 cup.  If you follow the recipe on the Bisquick buttermilk baking mix box, it says to use 2 1/4 cups mix  for biscuits with 2/3 cup milk.  I just made them as 'drop' biscuits - too sticky to flatten.  Really was a cross between chicken pot pie & chicken and dumplings!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, made extra buicuit mix over top.  Takes awhile, but it's worth it...should have made double the servings.  We kept going back for more.

This is a wonderful anytime comfort food and can be reheated easily without sacrificing the taste.  If you don't want the trouble of roasting the chicken, buy one already cooked at a grocery or restaurant, which should yield enough for the recipe.  My grandparents loved it!

I grilled boneless chicken breasts and thighs early in the day to help with prep time.  I doubled the recipe (but not all the broth) and added 4 boiled potatoes, cubed along with two packages of frozen corn & edamame (soy beans).  Served 9 with leftovers.  Everyone LOVED it!

What a disappointment. It took quite a bit of time to prepare....my family was expecting something wonderful.   The gravy in the casserole is very pasty and bland...you could really taste the flour.  The basil made it way too sweet and the canned peas gave it a taste we didn't like.

This came out delicious.  Instead of using butter, I substutited olive oil for a healthier alternative and reduced the amount to 1/8 cup.

My husband went back for seconds.

I really liked the recipe, and I think with one change, my family would like it too.  
I tried to be sneaky and chop the celery really fine (they hate celery) but you could 
taste it anyway.  Next time I will leave that out.  Also, I used frozen corn in place o
of the peas and I also added two peeled, cubed, uncooked potatoes.   It's a great 
recipe!

My family loved this dish!!!  I even got my 17 month old to eat it.  It was fairly easy to prepare.  I strongly suggest anyone making a lot of casseroles think about buying a "V slicer" and a George Foreman grill.  They make the preperation of casserole a breeze!!  I will definately make this one again.  My 12 year old stepson said," that chicken casserole thing you mad was really good!"....and he doesn't like peas.
