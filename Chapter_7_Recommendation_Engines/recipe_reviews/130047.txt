I followed this recipe to the letter.  I work in a bakery and also make and decorate cakes all the time.  With the cake itself I cannot really taste the bananas and as for the filling/frosting I went step by step measuring everything.  it will not get light and fluffy for me, it is runny to the point where if I try to put it in between cake layers it will just ooz out the sides.  Very soupy.  I don't have any stabilizer.  If I had to much more icing sugar then it will only get sweeter.  It does have a nice flavor but I don't believe I will try this recipe again.

The day after. After whipping the hell out of this recipe I gave up and threw it in the regrigerator.  I asked others how to stabilze this so it was not so runny.  I was told to yous a quarter batch. (1 envolope) of Knoxx Gelatin.  But when I took the filling/frosting out of the fridge it was alsmost solid.  Maybe you shoould mdntion that your ingredidnts maybe be best if chilled when making rather than at room temperature.    
Even though it is better it isn't a recipe I would use again.
