I absolutely loved these, as did my husband. I used 2 parts BBQ sauce and 1 part HP Steak Sauce, gave them that extra bit of tang. I also used cracker crumbs instead of oatmeal,they held together great!! Will definitely make these again!!

These were good, but obviously that would depend a lot on the sauce you choose. I used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal to bind after reading reviews and the meatballs seemed to hold up okay. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good.  I used fresh onion instead of dried onion & salt & pepper to taste.  The meatballs didn't hold their shape very well, I would use more oats & maybe some milk.  I halved the recipe & forgot to use less sauce, so they were a little too saucy.  Overall, I liked them and will try them again.

The unexpected star of our NFL Playoffs "show."  I'm convinced a good barbecue sauce and some finely chopped green pepper had everything to do with that. Make life easier and bake them at 400 degrees about 12 minutes instead of frying them, then finish the recipe as directed.

This was delicious! My whole family (5 kids of all ages) LOVED it. I did have to make some changes. I didn't have any instant oatmeal so I used potato flakes instead. I also substituted cut up Kraft Cheese Bites (Three Cheese Blend - Mozzarella, Parmesan & White Cheddar) for the cheese since it's what I had on hand.  After covering the meatballs in barbecue sauce I drizzled honey over the whole thing, about 1/2 cup. I then sprinkled about 1/2 cup of brown sugar over them. Finally, I splashed red vinegar over all of that for some tang. The sauce was thick, glazed and delicious!

Awesome meatballs. I loved this recipe, and will be making it again. I used 80/20 ground beef, and I thought the texture was perfect. I put my BBQ sauce on only the last 15 minutes, since I used BBQ sauce with a lot of sugar in it.

I really liked the texture of these meatballs - something I always struggle with.  Because of the the reviews, I did a combo of cracker crumbs and oatmeal.  I also didn't want to wash two pots, so I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes, drained them, then added the BBQ (mixed with chili sauce) and baked for another 25 minutes.  VERY GOOD!

The only things that I did differently were to cut the ingredients in half because I only had a pound of ground meat.  That was PLENTY of food for my family of 5!!  I used ground turkey because we don't eat red meat and I made my own sauce because I didn't have any on hand.  The family loved it :)    (My sauce: 1 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp. Heinz 57, 1 tbsp. A1, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tsp. yellow mustard).

Thought these were great! I read the reviews about the meatballs falling apart so I added another egg and they suck together just fine. These were so moist and yummy!! I will make these again for sure!

Yummy yummy!  Loved the tang to these meatballs.  They definitely didn't keep their shape well though.  Not sure what to do to remedy that (I'm new to meatballs).  But will experiment and deffinitely try again.

This was okay. Don't expect anything more than your average meatballs smothered in bbq sauce.

I have never made meatballs before but have always loved them.  I followed the recipe except that I didn't have the onions so I used a seasoning that has onions, garlic and some other things.  Mine stuck together great and tasted wonderful!  I skipped the BBQ sauce and just put them in the oven plain because my daughter (3) doesn't like it, and she loved them!  Ans they were really easy, I'm going to freeze some to have on hand!

Probably the best meatballs I've had!  My daughter made them using ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Wonderful...and healthier!  She mixed Open Pit and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauces, which gave it a little bit more "zing!"  It's going with us to the 4th of July get-together!!

These were soooo good! I really was surpised at how great these tasted, given this was my first time making meatballs. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, 3/4 cup milk, and 3/4 cup crushed oyster crackers (I didn't have saltine crackers). I think I will bake them next time, to make them a little more healthy. Hopefully they will keep the round shape better with baking also.

This had a nice flavor and will vary depending on the sauce you use. These did not hold up well though and crumbled upon trying to serve them.  I skipped the oven and used the stovetop and covered the dish and let it simmer on low.

Loved this recipe! I did make some changes; I omitted the cheese, mixed in A1 and Worcestershire sauce in the ground beef, and replaced oatmeal with 4C seasoned breadcrumbs as well as fresh minced onions. It does, of course, depend a lot on the barbeque sauce you use, I alternated between Stubbs' Smoky Mesquite and Hickory Bourbon and it was delicious. I also tried Famous Dave's Sweet & Sassy, and that didn't work as well. But this is definitely a favorite in my house!

It was very good but I suggest that you only use one table spoon of the onion. Other than that they were a big hit

These were a huge hit with my family. I used Sweet Baby Ray's regular sauce. It was good. I might go for some Famous Dave's next time.

Only modification was I used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal. (Shhh... don't tell my kids I left the onions in there!)

I prepared this recipe as stated in the directions. (I am not yet a "freelancer" in the kitchen.) My family really enjoyed them as a part of our gameday festivities. However, I found them a bit challenging to prepare. You have to be very vigilant when you place them in the oil in the skillet. They brown quickly. I turned them often, trying to brown each side. Unfortunately, as I was making more meatballs while some were in the skillet, those in the skillet would brown too quickly, and they got a little bit burned. I welcome any suggestions/help on this. But they were still a hit!

The meatballs fell apart when browning them so I put the uncooked ones back in the bowl and added two more eggs and a 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs to the mixture. They stayed together, browned nicely, tasted delicious, and I got compliments from the hosts of the party.  I did mix and browned them in the morning before the game and put them in the fridge. Then 45 minutes before leaving I rolled & covered them in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ and baked for 45 mins at 350 until internal temp was 160. I took off one star for hassle of re rolling the balls and having to add more ingredients to keep the meatballs together.

Made these for a pot luck event and they were gone in a flash even though I doubled the recipe. I took the suggestion of others and used bread crumbs instead of oats and I added garlic salt. I used Famous Dave's sweet and sassy bbq sauce. They were delicious and this is our go to recipe for meatballs now. My only regret was not having left overs to enjoy.

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  I substituted real diced onion and gluten-free breadcrumbs (same amounts as listed) and browned the meatballs in butter since I was out of vegetable oil.  I used my cookie dough scoop to form them.  They held their shape very well.  The BBQ sauce I used was Weber Grill Molasses.  I took them to a party and everyone loved them.  I didn't have any to take home!

Simple meat ball.  I used 3.3lbs of ground beef, 3 eggs and the rest of the cheese I had probably 1.5 cups.  I baked them I used a scoop then rolled them into balls so they were all the same size.  I plan to freeze them so I did not use the sauce.  I sampled one and it was good.

I made a half batch and cooked them in the oven for 20 minutes and then added the BBQ sauce and cooked them for an additional 20 minutes.  They were very good...almost as good as the Cajun Appetizer Meatballs recipe that is also on this website.

I used this recipe for the meatballs because they had oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and I didn't have bread crumbs or old bread on hand.  No trouble with them holding together.  I made them as directed except skipped the sauce, just put them by themselves in a glass baking dish for the baking portion.

This is a rating without any changes made. I would use the recipe again but I would use fresh garlic and onion to give texture, as well as add more salt and pepper than requested. I'd also consider using BBQ sauce instead of ketchup to give it more of the BBQ flavour.

I thought I would try something new, but these were not a big hit at the party.  I was really disappointed, and will go back to my old recipe.

I subbed turkey for personal preference. Used Italian style breadcrumbs hoping to impart more flavor, and I always add about 1/2 cup milk for moisture content. Cooking technique differed, too. I baked them all at 400 for 30 minutes in a chicken stock bath. Ok, so this is really becoming my own personal meatball recipe. But still, I used ketchup for the first time ever in a meatball! These were quite tasty. Thanks for the inspiration!

Delicious! Great Recipe! Although, I forgot to add the cheese, and used marinara sauce for a pasta dish instead of an appetizer. Husband approved!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. We needed to up the recipe 1-1/2 time so I added a pound of pork sausage and substituted the dried onion for sautéed onions. They were incredible!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated for the meatballs and had no issues with them falling apart as some others stated.  My family loved them straight out of the frying pan.  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of grape jelly to the plain BBQ sauce I used to make them a little sweet. I would make these again.

Absolutely delicious. I modified a little since I didn't have enough ketchup, adding in some worcestershire sauce to make up for the missing amount. Still turned out great.

Delish! Used chopped garlic, rather than onion. 
These were by far, the BEST meatballs I have ever tasted!

So good!! We make these at least once a month and theres never any left over. I use BBQ sauce in the meatballs instead of the ketchup, and kinda mix it up with some of the other ingredients depending on what I have on hand, or want to use up. 1/2 mozzarella for the cheese is amazing too!
