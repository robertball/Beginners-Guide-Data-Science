Pasties actually originate in Cornwall, England. This recipe is pretty close to the pasties my mom and Grandma used to make. It was a mortal sin to use carrots though. They always used Swede (Rutabaga)/ Swedish turnip. For the reviewer who has trouble with pastry, me too! I use frozen pie shells, let them get to room temp or even a litle warmer before filling one side with your ingredients. Also, we always use a peeler to scrape the potatoes and rutabaga, then it is thinner and cooks more thoroughly. We pile the ingredients on top of each other starting with potatoes, rutabaga, onions, beef and salt and pepper. Putting the beef on top allows the juices to soak into the vegetables as they cook. I love pasties!

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as is. For those who thought it was bland the beauty of pasties - they can be adjusted to your tastes by adding other meats, spices, and herbs. Many people eat them with ketchup.
If you have a hard time working with pie crust two pieces of cellophane can solve that problem. Roll the dough out between the two sheets. When the dough is the thickness and shape you need remove the top sheet and proceed to fill. Then use the bottom sheet of cellophane to fold over the pasty. Again great recipe!

My dad hails from Escanaba Michigan and this is exactly how my Mom and I make them, down to the butter on top for extra moisture! Also, thanks for the tip on rubbing the tops with milk we've never tried that!

As a yooper for most of my life, I have to say that the traditional U.P. pasty is made with ground beef, usually hamburger as it adds more flavor.  When purchasing a pasty this is the usual form.  It adds much needed moisture to the pasty so it won't be too dry.  Also, I can't imagine a pasty without carrots as one viewer mentioned that they don't belong.  Some people use ground pork along with the traditional ground beef but most don't like the pork either.  The U.P. pasty, though similar to the cornish pasty, was made for the miners to take with them to work in the mines because they filled the men up and were very portable.  The best toppings for a pasty are catsup and/or mustard of course, but some use gravy which, personally, I don't care for.  My uncle used to come up from Green Bay every summer and he used to pour dill pickle juice on them.  It actually isn't too bad as long as you don't use too much.  Hope this helps.

Very good and looks beautiful.  I sprinkled the meat mixture with powdered gravy mix, added 2T of water and a generous dose of Worcestershre Sauce.  A hit with the kids so it is a keeper!

I have had these for years, my Dad was from Northern Minnesota.  We don't put the carrots in.  Put a couple of slabs of butter on top of the filling before putting the pie dough over and cut a couple of slits in the pie dough also.  You can also make these for breakfast with cooked sausage scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese WOW are they good.

My Grandparents immigrated from Finland to the U/P in MI and I grew up eating this style of Pastie. I put meat layer on top to flavor veg's underneath as they bake. I use stew meat (diced small) season it, mix with tblsp of worchester, 2 tblsps of pepperoncini juice, a tblsp of ketchup and let it sit overnight in fridge. I dice all veggies fairly small also. I sometimes use the pre-made pie dough as a shortcut (even got my Finnish Dad to use them) and it's "almost" as good but not authentic. I make my pasties a bit smaller for easier handling. I don't have an issue" w/adding minced carrots or more seasoning (although rutabega is a key component). It's the end results that matter. If you can find a small rutabega, it's easier to cut up. I add garlic & dried thyme/parsley to meat and veg layers for a little extra flavor and top it off w/butter bits. Don't "overfill" or your crust will tear. I make 3 slits on top and spoon small amounts of beef stock into the slits 10 - 15 minutes b4 pasties are done for added moisture. I always make extra: allow pasties to cool & freeze in individual foil wrapped portions. If your not familiar with Pasties, you may not like them. In MHO these should be eaten w/ketchup, not gravy. Hope of my thoughts helped.

Extremely similar to my family's pasty recipe. They are from the "UP" and have passed their recipe down for at least 4 generations, that I know of. Pasties are real comfort food and quite delicious, even if they can be a bit "heavy" of a meal. Will make again , but I like to try different fillings too. (such as chicken and brocolli, turkey & artichoke, etc.) Pasties vary from family to family... but are delicious with or without carrots, with ground meat or cubed, with pre made crust or hand made, with or without rutabaga, etc. Just choose the fillings you like and don't forget to "dot" with butter before you seal them up!

My family went to the UP this summer for the first time.  It was fabulous and so were the pasties we enjoyed there.  This recipe tasted exactly like the pasties we ate while sitting on the shore of Lake Superior. Thanks

Cornish pasties is our family dish - going down 5 generations.  We also add fresh parsley to the mix.  We never use carrots in the recipe.  They are served with ketchup.  My great-grandfather, who was a miner, came from Cornwall - and he loved his pasty - and now my grandchildren enjoy making them.  What a wonderful family tradition.

For an easy and lower calorie version I use lean ground beef, diced onion, sliced carrots and diced potatoes add salt and pepper a pat of butter - place the raw ingredients in a pan and cover with pastry then bake - and serve hot with extra butter and ketchup.

I added turnips, mushrooms, Beef stock paste (more beef flavor), baking powder for the filling (makes the dough flakier).

An official Cornish pasty does not contain carrots but I added them in mine, and are included in many recipes of the times.

Traditionally associated with coal and copper miners of Michigan and Minnesota. coal miners would carry them into the mines well wrapped for there lunch. They would have there initials on the pasties (like I have mine on this pasty) so they could tell who they belonged to.

It is required that they are shaped like a "D", and they are crimped on the sides.

need to add baking powder, turnips, mushrooms, extra beef flavor, and brush the dough with egg yoke to give it a nice brown look. see my picture.

This is a great recipe, and follows very closely the one brought over from Corwall by my great-great grandmother Rule. My ancestors were Cornish miners hired by a company to come mine gold during the California gold rush. It is interesting to me the debate over the traditional ingredients in the recipe, but the truth is each family had their own variation. My great grandmother used onions, potatoes, carrots, and turnips. My grandmother and great aunt preferred only onions and potatoes. It can actually be customized to how you like it. I recommend brushing to tops of the pasties with milk about fifteen or twenty minutes before they are done to give them a golden brown color. Some people like ground beef or pork for the meat, but for me the round steak or sirloin has always been the best. Customize it however you wish, but enjoy a great Cornish tradition!

PUT AN ICE CUBE IN BEFORE SEALING DOUGH. This recipe is almost like my mothers. She always took a whole day and made pasties for the freezer. She always put a single ice cube into the mix before sealing it up. They were never dry.

For those have trouble with the pastry, stick the shortening in the fridge for about half an hour before making the crust.  This makes the dough just a tad firmer while you work with it

Pretty close to my grandmothers recipe. We also peeled the vegtables too, then cut them into small cubes.  I do not use carrots. I have tweeked it over the years. I roast 2 cloves a garlic, then chop them in with the onion. Put all your vegtables on the bottom of the pasty first. then the meat, and then a  thin slice of  butter or margarine. when it cooks the juices cook the vegtables. We have always served them with a white sauce over them. Basic butter, flour,milk,salt,pepper.

I haven't had pasties since I was a kid. Found a rutabaga and thought I would give it a try. The crust is nice and flakey. Just delicious!!! I didn't change anything. Made the recipe just as it was- (I did double it so I can freeze some and have them for work.) Coming from Michigan, this is something I just haven't found anywhere else in the country. I feel like I just ate a memory! Ummm...Delish!

Excellent!  This recipe was great and easy.  I followed it exactly.  The crust was flaky and perfect.  I live in the U.P. and have tried many variations.  Thanks for sharing!  I find many 'Yoopers' think they have a "secret" family recipe and won't give it out.  Ha!  this one beat all of theirs!

My mom asked me to print off this recipe for her, so that we could have these for dinner.  She made the recipe exactly as stated and we LOVED them (and being from MI we know what we are doing when it comes to pastie consumption, lol).  Her first batch came out a little dry, so she did glaze some milk over the dough for her 2nd and it came out much softer.  The only complaint is that the amount of filling was WAY TOO MUCH compared to the amount of dough (almost double the filling needed). However, that just meant she had to make more pasties for us to eat, so it is not all that bad, haha. Thanks for sharing!!!  :)

My family is from the U.P., but originally from Cornwall.  This was the pasty I grew up on, but without the addition of carrot.  For those that think they're dry....well, they aren't supposed to be like a pot pie.  I eat it with ketchup, as does the rest of my huge family.  We have gotten a little lazy though, and a lot of times make a big pastie pie.  Sometimes I'll make my own crust and sometimes I'll just buy an already made crust.  Just layer it in the pie shell as the recipe states, dot with a little butter if you wish, cover with the other crust and make a couple slits and bake at 350 for an hour to an hour and a half.

I used to eat these all the time while visiting my family in Michigan and was missing them. I was amazed at how well my first shot at making them turned out, the crust was perfect! I made a vegetarian variation by replacing the meat with an extra potato, celery and a parsnip, and added some curry powder. This version goes perfectly with mint chutney, definitely a new favorite!

This is a fantastic recipe, and what's more, if you decide you don't like this particular filling, you can fill it with just about anything you can imagine. I filled some with leftover beef stew and they were heavenly. I even filled them with some leftover pecan pie filling and they were MARVELOUS (though one of them did rupture...)

So much fun to make.

This recipe is almost identical to the one that my great-grandmother from Calumet, MI used to make.  I always make a triple recipe so that I can freeze a bunch.  You just reheat them in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes... or my husband, also a U.P. native, says that microwaving them for three minutes works as well.

I was born and raised in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and these were a family staple!  When I was 13, my parents moved us down here to Illinois, where the term "Pastie" illicits very strange looks from others. lol  Since we moved, my family still can not live without these.  Granted, you can buy them frozen and boxed now at Gordons Food Center, but they are SOOO much better homemade.  Twice a year all the women in our family here get together to make pasties for our families.  It is usually an all day event!  Because these freeze so incredibly well, we make enough to stock all of our deep freezers for the next several months.  Wrapped and stored individually, these meat pies are a great quick meal, whether reheated in the oven (preferred) or the microwave.  Great served with extra melted butter on top and ketchup, though others in my family prefer a brown gravy instead.

We introduced to these when I lived in Butte, MT. A huge part of the local culture, pasties are an art form there. I really enjoyed how easy the dough is to form. I had a lot of extra filling but that wasn't a  problem. Just froze it until the pastie making. I have made these three times since finding this recipe.

I've made these a bunch of times, the only regular changes the addition of carrot for a bit of color, butter for margarine, and an egg wash to make the crust pretty. Just like with steaks, if I've got a really good cut of meat, the simple seasoning here is fine. It's just when I've got an ordinary bit of meat that I need to up the seasoning.

PERFECT!!!!  I grew up on these and it was such a treat to have the taste recreated EXACTLY as I remembered it.  I omit the rutabaga, as I am generally a fan but do not care for it in pasties. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Disappointing over all. The dough was very easy to mix up and rolled out beautifully. I put the butter on top of the meat/veggies as instructed but they were dry and kind of bland. The meat was tender, veggies cooked perfect, crust a light brown so everything turned out except that they were dry. It's been ages since I've had a pastie from the UP but don't they have a little bit of some kind of gravy inside?

Yum! I didn't have rutabega-but it was delish with steak, potato and carrots (garlic and parsley). I was worried about everything cooking by putting it in raw-it turned out amazing! I had left over filling too. Served with brown gravy! Will definitely make again!

Very good. Tastes like home! Easy too. Made a bunch to freeze for a quick meal on a busy night.
Leftover filling. Will use more filling per pastie next time.

I just took them out of the oven and the juices all leaked out making the bottoms soggy. When I went to flip them over to try and cook the bottoms I found that they were stuck to the wax paper and all fell apart. Next time I will spray pam on the paper which the directions didn't say to do. I would love some advise on what else I maybe did wrong.

This is how my UP family also makes Pasties, but I made a slight change to mine that I personally prefer.  I "flash fry" my steak pieces first in a pan with about 1 TB of oil and a teaspoon or so of crushed garlic.  Then I add it to my rutabaga/potato/onion mixture and bake.  :)  yum!

very good classic pasty.... i even made mine using lard crust.... you can really put what ever you want inside ground meat or cubed meat and different veggies.... two things to be sure you do though is make sure they seal up good and be sure to add the slab of butter... if you don't they will dry out...

Wow! These are perfect and exactly what I was looking for. My husband's grandmother (from the U.P.) made these twice a year for the family. My husband said these were "spot on"! I thought the crust was VERY easy to work with, and tasted perfect. I cut my meat smaller than stated though, I made sure to dice all of the ingredients to be about the same size. I omitted the carrots as well. I also had to roll out the dough a little larger than 6" (closer to an 8" circle) in order to fit the 1 cup of filling. Make sure you season these generously and they will be perfect.  These were definitely a hit!

The best thing on earth! I used butter flavored crisco.  The crust was AMAZING. I did add a little bit of gravy powder to the filling for flavor.  Definatly will make again. Alot easier than I was expecting too!!

I'm originally from England and never knew that these were popular in Michigan. The way my parents always made these was to use leftover beef stew for the filling..cuts down on prep time and is a nice way to use up leftover stew!

Hate to rain on the parade, but I thought this was very bland. I also ended up with a lot of leftover filling because I could only fit 1/2 to 3/4 cup of filling in each pastie.

Good recipe,  I used lard for the crust, no rutabaga but did add carrot, like my Polish Grandmother did.
I baked mine for 90 minutes to get good color.  
I doubled the recipe, next time I will add more meat as I made them larger than suggested.
Delicious!

Followed the original recipe except used hamburger instead of chuck. That's how I remember it in Northern Wisconsin. I always have more filling than dough so make a larger batch of dough.

These are wonderful! My late husband used to make pasties and we have missed them since he died. Wasn't sure if I could make them as good, but I followed the recipe exactly and we loved them. The crust was a breeze to work with (and I always struggle with pie crust), did not fall apart our stick at all. We will be having pasties alot this winter! I plan to make a bunch and freeze them for days when we just don't feel like cooking.

My family LOVES this recipe! The only change I make is to double the pastry ingredients because I put in some green beans and carrots for extra nutriton! Tastes just like the great pasties you can find here in Northern Michigan! YUM!

I made the recipe exactly as it appears and I didn't care for it. I am very good with dough so that turned out fine but the inside was bad. I would try this again using the other suggestions from other reviews. I think ground hamburger with some added seasoning might be the trick for me! I will give this another try.

I am from Menominee, MI and this is truly an Upper Peninsula meal.  I used this recipe more as a guideline because it was very similar to the way my mother and grandmother make them, however I used what I had on hand.  I used a ground beef and ground pork mixture and omitted the rutabaga.  Everything else was the same and they turned out great.

DO NOT USE PRE-MADE PIE DOUGH.  If you want the real thing you must make your own.  Also, all ingredients are a must: carrot, rutabaga and the rest.  When I was a kid spending my summers in Bootjack and Houghton/Hancock I ate these doused in ketchup, which is still great, but to spice it up a bit try mixing in some chili sauce and/or horseradish and lemon juice.  Yum :)

We used to have Pasties when visiting my relatives in Upper Michigan, 40 years ago. This recipe I got from a friend in Michigan, they are wonderful!  The pie crust is no problem whatsoever rolling out. I divided mine into 12 sections and used 1/2 cup of filling for each pastie circle.  My husband thinks I should add a can of cream soup to the recipe for moisture, I might just do that next time.  DELICIOUS!  I am freezing the leftover pasties and can take them to work. YUMMO!

This recipe is wonderful! Be careful to watch the amount of shortening. I've found Crisco to be the best. I also have to cook them longer than the recipe calls for, but just keep checking them every 5 minutes past the time if your oven isn't a real hotty. I'm a yooper chick and I grew up with having a choice between carrots and beggies. I always choose carrots. It's just a person's preference. Also, don't be afraid to use more potatoes and carrots...Long live U.P. pasties!!

I'm visiting my daughter who recently had her first child. I tried this recipe twice with ground turkey because she does not eat red meat.  They turned out terrific both times. I'd like to make some up and put in the freezer for her. We have lived in the UP of Michigan for many years so have eaten many pasties.

These were great!  I cut my meat up a little smaller, and I also added pork.  The flavoring was terrific, but I would have liked them a little less dry. Maybe serving some gravy over them would be just right. I did have some extra filling, but just baked it in a dish alongside the pasties.

I'm not rating this recipe because I have the kiss of death with pie crust.  We enjoyed pasties so much while visiting Michigan that I decided to give it a go.  Had trouble rolling the dough thin enough and getting the filling to stay inside without the pastie splitting open. Any future reviewers have suggestions? (besides adding more flour)

These were fantastic! I was born and raised in the UP and have not had a pastie in 15 years. These tasted just as I remember my grandmother's tasting. Thanks Cheryl! I will be making these often.

LOL, I'd have to agree with Michelle, back in 02/25/2006...it is a mortal sin to add carrots to the pastie.  My MIL used to make, Welsh, Cornwall family...and no carrots!  And yes, they used Swede, but we have rutabaga access here for ease.  Also when I was a kid, my mom would even have  me bike up to a Welsh bakery near us in Detroit, to get the same style that my MIL taught me to do.  And in honor of her this week...since she'd been gone for 4 years now...and it's also her birthday week...I've made my own off her recipe.  Otherwise, this one is very close(leave out the carrots people!).  She'd make, wrap in foil, and give hubby and myself them to take for our lunch while out skiing(Michigan).  I will say that I used a King Arthur Flour recipe today for the dough..and it was very easy to work with for all the folding and crimping. :)

We really like these and make them a couple times per year.  We have found that it is best to double the dough as there is a lot of filling.  Also, we like to add seasoning salt to the inside mixture, but it is not necessary.

Easy! Very good but can be a little dry. Someone recommend that you put the meat on top of the veggies to let the meat juices help keep it moist. It helped a little but I think having brown gravy with them might be what I try next time.
A little milk brushed on the crust is good. Egg works too.
Will make these again.

I tried to add many 'extras' for flavor but  have yet to use rutabegas.  Easy to put together with a pie crust dough and the fact that the ground beef is pocketed raw.  Make sure to bake on a rimmed sheet otherwise the juices will spill out onto oven floor!

FINALLY!!!!...A true Yopper pasty recipe!!!! My mother grew up in Houghton and her mother made pasties all the time and they did not consist of "ground anything". The miners that took pasties to the mines for their lunch liked substance!!..not ground ingredients. My grandmother pasted her knack for making pasties on to my mother; however a recipe was never written down. I made pasties with my mother a few times but never on my own. My mother is now 92 and when I asked her to write out a recipe for pasties she said she was unable to due to effects of her stroke. I have searched for a recipe that included dice rutabaga and cubed meat instead of ground. My mother did say that carrots are not included and that her mother would sometimes include cubed pork in her pasties...back then(early 1900's) they used what they had on hand. Mom also slit the top of the pasty and inserted a pat of butter before cooking. She also served them with "Chow Chow" which is a chunky mustard pickle relish.

I mostly followed the recipe, although I used a 75/25 mixture of ground beef and pork.  I really worked the meat into the filling so it was distributed well.  The pasties were a hit!  Reheating them in the oven works well too.

This is ok,but Butte pasties seem so much better than those I've had in Michigan. Maybe, it is the Montana water, but in Butte, pasties are the staple and actually much better than this..

Simple recipe template with a lot of room to improvise!  I actually omitted the butter and used some left-over cheese broccoli soup I had made a couple of days previous instead of the butter.  Because I was short on time I used Trader Joe's crescent rolls found in the refrigerator section instead of the homemade pastry.  Obviously homemade is better, but mine turned out great.  Thanks!

Got rutabaga in CSA box and was stumped.  Followed recipe as noted minus carrot and they came out great.  Can't wait until next batch and start experimenting with fillings.  Great find.

Like other users, I used ground beef (which is what I've typically encountered in the UP) or ground venison with 10% beef fat. The key with pasties is definitely the rutabaga. I have added mushrooms (canned or fresh) with success. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I brushed the tops with milk and a little butter to get them to brown.

If you've never had pasties - they are supposed to be a little dry inside (even a good pasty is a wee bit "dry"). This was the biggest surprise for me when I first tried pasties (I'm not a native Michigander). A lot of people like to serve them with brown or cream gravy on the side to dip bites in.

I made these Pasties yesterday; using butter instead of margerine; they turned out just like my dad taught my mother how to make.  He was from the U.P. (Trap Rock); mom was from Panama. I made them for my son/siblings; they all said they were delicious!  As kids we use to sit around the table on a Saturday morning and make Pasties with mom.  Dad was in heaven...he was a Finn and he was happy mom would make them for him "us". Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, nice to carry on the tradition of my Finnish hereitage! :)

I loved this recipe! I make it every few weeks. I had no problem with the crust, but I tried it in my food processor and it was the most beautiful dough that I have ever worked with. It is so easy to change up with different veggies and spices. We use gravy with ours.

I made my version of UP pasties with the leftover pepper steak I had made with sirloin steak, peppers, onions, celery, mushrooms, and potatoes.  I added carrots when I decided to make the pasties. That is probably why it grew. I used Pampered Chef's new 4" biscuit cutter to form the circles but instead of folding them over I used a bottom and top crust filling the middle with stew mixture using Pampered Chef's medium scoop. Sounds like a great receipe for my next Pampered Chef party as my husband was not too keen on my latest creation!!!!

I have never been to the UP and never tried a pasty, but I have seen Escanaba In Da Moonlight many times and decided to make these for deer camp. This recipe was good, but a little bland. Next time I will add some more salt to the crust and more spices to the mixture also, but they were still very good and were all eaten by the 2nd day.

Very easy to make & delish-tasted pretty much like a beef pot pie without the gravy.  I DID add the rutabaga & carrots & all 6 of us liked it, including my not-so-adventurous boys. I had the perfect ratio of dough to filling too! Thank you-we'll be having these again!

Delicious.  I am so glad I decided to make my own dough!  I followed the recommendations of others and added a few shakes of worcestershire sauce to the veggies and beef.  I also placed the veggies first, then the beef on top, so the juices from the beef went into the veggies.  Finally the best suggestion was to use the wax paper you are rolling out the dough with to help fold the top of the pasty over.

These are great! I use 1/3 cup less flour, 1/2 tsp less salt for the dough. I usually throw in whatever is on hand: potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic cloves, and hamburger. I liked the suggestion that used gravy mix. My mom grew up in Upper Michigan and brought this recipe with her to our Norwegian family. My husband really loves these! I like to dip mine in ketchup.

This was my first time working and tasting rutabaga. I have to say the thing was HORRIBLE to cut up. I nearly asked my husband to take an axe to it! After cooking the rutabaga were very tough and unsatisfying. Other than that this recipe was very yummy! I used beef tips and they cooked up very tender along with the potatoes, carrots and onions. I did have a lot of filling left over, but I just cooked it along with the pasties in a casserole dish.

Just like the pasties we made at church for fundraisers as a kid.  I always use ground beef, and I like to season the meat as it cooks...I throw in some salt/garlic/pepper/and whatever else sounds good.  Sometimes I use Famous Daves Steak and Hamburger seasoning mix.  I also like to make sure the crust is super thin (a little healthier I suppose.  So I doubled the crust recipe and made a triple filling recipe and there was just a little leftover crust!  You can't mix the filling wrong, so just add veggies until you feel the ratios are right!  After they've cooled, wrap them in tinfoil and put them in your freezer...they're great to heat up when you don't want to cook!

thank you! No one for the longest time ever heard of them here in Maine, and roadside pasties are an unforgettable treat for anyone who ventures into the UP. This recipe has already been saved in my favorites (and I haven't tried it yet) just reading the recipe brought me right back.  This is what I am doing our first  chilly day here. (it's coming... )

Great recipe. Just as I remember on trips to the U.P. I didn't use the carrots and I pressure cooked the meat (chuck tends to be chewy) with some onion and garlic salt and pepper. after it was done I boiled away all the water until there was a brown glaze to the pan added 3 cups of water and added a half pound of ground chuck, 1/2 tsp. salt and made a great gravy to go with them. Beautiful. Its in my recipe book.

These were okay.  I was expecting more flavor, based on what I've eaten in restaurants... I might try it with ground beef next time.

Born and raised in Michigan and had never tried making a pasty until I found this recipe. I was concerned about dryness so I put my own twist on this recipe. First of all, the dough recipe is awesome! No changes there. The only things I did differently were: I tossed my meat/veggie mixture with garlic infused olive oil and used seasoned salt and regular salt. I brushed the filled pasties with an egg wash instead of milk. I tried mine with gravy, ketchup, and mustard separately and I preferred mustard (I’m a ketchup lover) or plain. Surprisingly moist! Next time, I’m going to try burger instead of steak. Thanks for the recipe! Definitely making these again! Trying breakfast ingredients next time with that awesome “pie” dough :)

I made the filling almost as written, I added Worcestershire sauce and red pepper flakes, based on other reviews.   I used pre made  pie crust, rolling it out thin.    Overall I found it a little bland, but I am used to eating spicy foods.   I would definitely make again, they were darn good dipped in baby rays secret  sauce.  (It has a horseradish tang that complimented these very well).  
Next Time I will add more spice, but it is a very versatile recipe, that is customizable enough for every one.   Thank you for sharing.

My Dad was born and raised in the Houghton, MI area (he was part Finn) and used to make pasties for the family once or twice a year. He passed many years ago, so I have been thinking of taking over the family tradition. This recipe came out exactly as I remember Dad's pasties! Follow this exactly as written (no carrots! Use rutabaga!) and you will have one of the best pasties around!

As written, I find it a bit bland, and the portions were huge.

I think in the future I'm going to try doing a couple little things to adapt it:  I'm going to add some garlic and thyme to the crust to push up the flavor.  I'm going to experiment between 8 and 10 pasties, so they are not so enormous.   I also think that it could also be fun to throw a handful of cranberries or currants in could add something.

I felt I was channelling my late mother with this recipe.  This was her copper country style pasty.  I used bread flour because I had it.  The dough was light, rolled thin, and had a forgiving elasticity.  I assumed the recipe called for sifting before measuring, an important step. I found that the large pieces of meat didn't want to mix evenly with the vegetables, so I separated the meat out after seasoning  and counted the pieces to distribute evenly to the pasties.

We were blessed to live in the UP for a few years. One of the best thing we met were pasties! Oh how I miss them. There was a little place in Ishpeming, made the BEST, these are just as good. I’m so happy to find this recipe, I make just as printed. My mentor from UP is gone now, but this sounds like her recipe. Thank you

Loved this recipe. I used butter flavored shortening and put powdered gravy mix into the filling. I also believed they tasted better after I reheated them at work.

To cut carbs I used rutabaga and no potatoe.  Absolutely fabulous.  Definitely chill the dough for best results.  I got 8 from the dough vs. 6 as it says.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, only using McCormick's steak seasoning in place of salt and pepper.   I made them for my Dad, whose grandmother made them for him and he loved them.     I've been looking for a pasty recipe that didn't use ground beef and my search is over.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's perfect.    I might just double it next time.

These were really good. I doubled the recipe, since I was making for a crowd. I used refrigerated pie crust, which I cut into thirds, then rolled out. I did not add any seasoning other than the salt and pepper. Very tasty.

From Mohawk, MI ... Pasties have long been my favorite beach food on Superior.  Good recipe ... we, too, always used ground beef/hamburger for the meat.  I've used different kinds of meat (and even pre-made pie crusts sometimes).  (Don't tell anyone.) :)

I live in an old mining town where the original townspeople were all Cornish. Pasties are pretty huge here and I have to say that this recipe made the most authentic pasties I've tasted. They equal the best restaurant in town which has been making the same recipe since the 1800's. I made them with leftover cooked ham, cheddar cheese, broccoli and shallots and the kids asked for thirds! They were that good. Don't hesitate to make this recipe. It makes 6 huge servings.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I made them almost like written with the exception of adding garlic and also a spoonful of beef gravy to each pastie before sealing. I am unsure given the ingredients; why they were so bland? Maybe the addition of mushrooms or other herbs would help? I think it's a good basic recipe that can be built upon. I will probably play around with this one to make it a bit more tasty. The crust was very nice and flaky and I thought easy to work with.

Made it with pre-made pie crust, and had to figure out what a rutabega looked like, but it was pretty tasty.  I followed another reviewer's comment and added some brown gravy mix to the meat mixture.  The carrots were also a nice touch.

This recipe was awesome, very close to being strait from da UP (yup I am a pseudo Yooper - NMU student for 4 years)  In place of the steak, I used 1 pound of ground pork and a 1/2 pound of ground chuck as found in other pasty recipes (and well, my fridge.)  It turned out very very tasty!  I also brushed the tops with milk and they turned out beautiful.  Excellent recipe!

Good...but we still doused them with BBQ sauce to eat.  They came out a little dry and lack-luster.  Maybe next time add mushrooms or some more seasoning.

I love the dough for this, it comes out perfect every time!  I never even knew what pasties were until my husband and I took a drive up the MN northshore and I saw a sign and was rather confused, he of course insisted we stop on the way back to try it (he grew up in northern MN).  So the love started.  This was very close to what we had then, I make a gravy to dunk it in, as is done in the Minnesota world of pasties. (blasphemous to some, I know)

I grew up eating pasties. My sister and I made this recipe for st. patty's day. It was the best we have ever had. We doubled the recipe and even had enough extra vegies and chicken to make into chicken and dumplings. Way good!

I made this recipe for the 2nd time yesterday. They taste amazing, my family loves them! The only issue I had with the recipe was that there wasn't enough dough for all the filling. The 1st time i made a stew with the extra filling that turned out very tasty. This time I made an extra batch of pastry and it worked perfectly. These would do my Finnish Dad and Grandma proud.

These were VERY good - the pastry was perfectly flaky, with a nice touch of salt.  I didn't add carrots or rutabaga, but I didn't miss them. (I prefer to eat my veggies on the side.) Since my meat was still a little frozen when I cut it anyway, I threw it in a zip top bag with a red wine marinade and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours before I assembled the pasties.  The meat turned out nice and tender, and pretty flavorful!

These were so tasty. My best friend's family always made these so I have  had my fair share of pasties. The one thing that I changed, the second time that I made them, was that instead of salt and pepper I used season salt. It sounds like a small thing, but it makes a big difference in the flavoring. (My friend's family always used season salt.)This reminded of my childhood.

Never heard of a pastie before stumbling across your recipe. They were very good, although hubby didn't like the rutabega. Next time we'll make it without.

These turned out pretty good, and were surprisingly easy to make. Except for cutting up the rutabaga--there's got to be a trick that makes it easier! If I make them again, I think I'll add a little more spice and butter, but overall they taste great. I now have several in the freezer for when I get a pasty craving, I won't have to find someone to drive to the UP for me to get a fix!

I loved this recipe! It was so simple and tasty. I used ground beef instead of stew meat because thats what I had on hand. I just browned the meat and drained it before adding it to the mix and it was delicious. My husband loves these with brown gravy, it was a big hit!

Excellent recipe.. so easy too. Only changes I made were to the pastry. I added a few tablespoons of garlic & pepper to the dough. It made the outside blend with the inside flavor much better. Also, I used another users idea & sprinkled gravy mix onto the filling.. MMmmm!!!  I will be doing this again, thanks so much!

I was born in the U.P of Michigan so a true "Yooper". I grew up eating pasty and this is just how I remember it. Only thing I do differently is use combo of ground beef and pork. You can buy meatloaf mix in meat dept. that works perfectly. Usually I just make large pan of this instead of individual (less work!) and of course you MUST eat with ketchup on top.

Man, these are good. I did make changes, based on what I had in my cupboard. I used half pork sausage and half ground beef. Unfortnately I had no rutabagas handy, but the recipe was good without them.

Per other users, I thinly sliced the carrots and potatos for quicker cooking. I also brushed the tops with milk. I cooked the pasties on my pizza stone (because I left it in the oven by mistake) and they turned out great, very flakey and perfectly cooked. On the stone at 400 degrees, the pasties took 30 minutes.

I will make these again. Very yummy.

We loved the pasties. I added onion soup mix, 3 T water, and soy sauce to season and add moisture to the filling, and I replaced the potatoes with sweet potatoes. I also used frozen pie crusts (thanks to those who suggested it!). The result was not the traditional pasties that others enjoy, but it was very good!

yum! I cheated & used pre-made pie crusts, but these were great. My kids & husband liked them & it's not usual that I find something everyone likes! We served with either ketchup or beef gravy & I used a mix of red & yellow potatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe, and I will definitely make it again!  As others have noted, I too had an excess of filling.  I just made another batch of dough and ended up with 12 pasties all together.  These are a great "grab and go" lunch option for the office dweller.
