Added more seasoning to taste. Mixed peppers and onions with the eggs and also just cracked some eggs into cups with cheese on top just to see how that turned out. Very good and versatile recipe. Did bake bacon a little before placing in cups-otherwise too flimsy to get to go around muffin cup. Feta cheese also good mixed in. Will make again!
