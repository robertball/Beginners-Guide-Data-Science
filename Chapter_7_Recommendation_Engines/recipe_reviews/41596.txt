Excellent! Loved this one & easy to make too. One thing about the almonds that I really like instead of the pine nuts is the COST! The toasted almonds were very tasty & so much less $$. Also...a tip on toasting the nuts, don't bother with the oven, simply heat a (dry) non stick heavy skillet on the stove, and saute' the nuts until toasted with no butter or oil. They are super easy & quick to do this way. Great recipe!

I tried halving this recipe and ran into difficulties.  In particular,
with half the material, after the initial blender pulse, all the material
-much more compact- now could lay beneath the blades.  Additional blending
didn't do anything.  I had to manually raise of the material and try to
blender again, but this achieved little because it quickly went below the
blades again, and in the end I was left with pesto with many practically
unchopped garlic and nuts.  This is posted here as an unrated review to
warn others that before reducing the size of the recipe, think about the
size, shape, and abilities of your food processor/blender.  (With more
material, I think that the convection in my blender would chop everything
without difficulty.)

Wow!  Do I like this recipe!  It's quick and yummy.   Just the thing to do with a handful of fresh basil straight from the farmer's market. I simply toasted slivered almonds on a hot, dry skillet until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Forget the oven!

This recipe really can be adjusted, and probably should be, depending on your taste.  We used about 1/2 a cup of toasted pine nuts, added a tbl of shaved parm., added a bit of mint and played with the olive oil till it was the right texture.  But this recipe shows you all the basic elements...adding sundried tomatos is fun too, or olvies.

This is a great basic pesto recipe- I use pine nuts and possibly any other nuts I have around (pecans). I also add parmesan cheese as I'm a big cheese fan. You can substitute water for some of the oil if you'd like a lower-fat version. Very versatile recipe!

I amgiving this recipe 5 stars simply because of the fact that it uses nutmeg!! That is a wonderful addition to any pesto sauce!!  I did modify it for other things however, I added lemon juice and parmesan cheese, and used pine nuts instead.  This is a great base however, and the nutmeg really does add an impressive taste!  Thanks for sharing!

I had a ton of basil that I needed to use up.  It doesn't tolerate cold at all, so it's streching it to keep it into October in Minnesota.  I was struggling to choose a recipe, so I decided to try three different pesto recipes from this site.  In A-typical allrecipes fashion I actually stuck exactly to each recipe so that we could truly judge them fairly.  The recipes were Easy Pesto by Rebecca Jane Thompson, Pesto Sauce by Sara, and Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto by FuzzyGreenMonkey.  My favorite was Easy Pesto.  It had a nice nutty flavor because of the toasted almonds.  It's also nice if you don't have much basil on hand because it uses half as much as the other recipes.  My husband liked Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto the best, it was my close second.  The parmesan cheese and pine nuts really make that recipe.  We both agreed that by far our least favorite was Pesto Sauce.  It was very bland compared to the other two.  I would attribute that to the 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  I would not recommend that recipe at all.  It was a fun experiment and the other two recipes will go into my permanant file.

I have never made Pesto before and honestly didn't know what it was until I made this and put it in a pasta dish,then voila! I realized the glob I dug out of the food processor was a familiar taste and made the pasta dish wonderfully delicious. I used raw almonds and did not toast them, and used dried basil instead of fresh leaves. I will definately make again and not sure I can make another pasta dish without it. Thank you!

This was an awesome recipe! I added about 3 tbsp of parmesan cheese and used the pesto to make a cream sauce. I will make this again!

Excellent and so easy! I had never  made pesto before--I was surprised at how much better it was than the store-bought kind. I added extra garlic and used pine nuts.

This was so easy to put together.  I had to add some lemon basil because I didn't have enough of the regular.  It was great.  I would add more garlic and less oil next time. Thanks for a great recipe! Oh, I also added a little parmesean cheese 'cause I like it!

I LOVE THIS!!  My only 2 strays from the recipe were that I toasted the almonds stove-top and added a bit of shaved parmesan cheese to the food processor.  The whole thing takes 10 minutes!  *FYI this recipe makes enough for 1 lb of pasta.  Thanks Rebecca for a keeper!!

I loved this recipe!  Before putting in the basil, I dunked it in boiling salt water and then immediately cooled it in ice cold water.  This helps keep the bright green color of the basil.

I make basil pesto frequently but this time had TONS of basil to use (had to remove a garden bed) & the fact that this one used almonds intrigued me...I had an oversized can of mixed nuts leftover from a party & picked out the almonds. I love the fact that I can sub most any nut I have on hand (didn't need to add any salt) but this needed something so I added 1/4 cup parmesan & a quick squeeze of lemon & there it was!

This is a very nice pesto! I have always used expensive pine nuts :(, but almonds and nutmeg really work! I tried as is (very good) then for more "oomph" went ahead and added the secret ingredient from "Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto" on this site, which is 1/4 tsp. chili powder. It sounds all wrong, but it amazingly works. I also used a bit less oil. Very nice even without Parmesan.

This is an excellent pesto recipe!!  You will save a lot of $$ by using almonds vs. pine nuts.  Don't bother cooking these in the oven, dry saute them on the stove top on a low heat- be careful, they burn easily!  And my most important recommendation: Add a Tbsp. or 2 (I did 3!) of finely grated Parmesan cheese - it adds a delicious creaminess that you don't get otherwise.

It was super easy.  I used pine nuts instead of almonds.  The taste was right on the money.  I even froze the extra in an ice cube tray so I have some ready to use next time.

This was my second time making this in a short period of time as I currently have a plethora of fresh basil on my back deck.  This time, I made a little bigger batch (I loved it so much the first time around), using half for pasta, the other half I mixed into softened cream cream---it made a wonderful cracker spread.  This recipe will be made again and again, as long as I have a basil crop.  Thanks again for this absolute winner.

Excellent recipe.  I used lots of basil from my garden and made two batches.  I placed the pesto in ice cube trays and froze then popped out and individually wrapped each cube and put all the cubes in a bag in the freezer.  I use these all fall and winter as single serving pesto, in sauces, or as spreads.

Surprisingly good with the almonds. I toasted whole almonds on the stovetop, then chopped before processing it all together. As others have said, I recommend this method over the oven, especially if using sliced or slivered nuts. I only used 1/2 of the oil and it was great with rotini pasta - stuck in all the spirals. I added some diced tomato for color, and next time I might add some shredded zucchini and carrot.

I'm not a pesto connoisseur by any means and, in fact, this was my fist time trying to make it myself.  But I thought this recipe was incredible!  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions:  I added a few squirts of fresh lemon and about 1/4 cup parm/reg cheese.

Really good! I used a whole box of bow-tie pasta and wasn't sure the sauce would cover it all but it did! I added a little water just to make sure. Also, tip my boyfriend was to not grind up the almonds completely. He commented that the almond crunch is a nice texture change. Very delicious! Will make again. So simple!

I love this recipe! If I am feeling a little fiesty I'll throw a sun-dried tomato in it!! I pulse the dry ingredients before adding the olive oil- this way I can determine how wet/dry I want the pesto depending on how I am serving it! Delicious EVERY time!

Very tasty and quick.  Try adding a teaspoon of fresjh lemon juice to get a real Southern Italian flavor.  A few almond slices give it a really great texture, too.

I made this with fresh basil from my garden and I had no Almonds so I used finely chopped black walnuts. OH YYYYYUUUUUUMMMMMM. I had enough to  use for two different meals. I made the first one a couple of weeks ago. Bruce liked it  and said he has to get used to the olive oil and I guess he better because I will make this every summer I have fresh Basil in the garden. Also I had some pork chops left over and boned them, sliced them very thin. Mixed them and the pesto and pasta together and what a delicious quick dish. Yum, yum, thank you for this recipe. I will make it over and over again.

This was very good, but I suggest to use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3. I'm a garlic lover, but even this was too garlicky for me. I also added parmesan cheese and a small tomato for more flavor. Overall, this is a good pesto.

I adjusted amounts to my preference, and used minced garlic from a jar, fresh spinich in place of about 1/3 of the basil to get veggies in where I can.  This was as wonderful as the recipe that inspired me to try this one.  Thank you!

I liked the idea of it being made with almonds instead of pine nuts. I will definitely use this again, it was a nice change to pine. I used light OO. I didnt have fresh basil, so I used dried & was still good. Next time will try with fresh. I added this to cooked low carb ziti pasta and added fresh grated Romano cheese & grilled chicken. YUM!

The entire family loves this recipe!  Tastes great with any nut (we use pine nuts, walnuts or pecans), and freezes wonderfully! I make a ton before the first frost and freeze it all in ice cube trays - love having this ready at any time. Careful on the timing when roasting the nuts - easy to burn them.

I tweaked this recipe a little to sit my fancy. Instead of adding toased almonds, I added toasted walnuts instead. (It was all I had on hand!) I also added 3-4 sundried tomato pieces that I had dried myself. They were hard and not canned in oil, so I chopped them first to help the food processor out. I also added about 5 cloves of garlic since I like it so much. With the tomatoes and extra garlic, however, I had to add a little more oil to get it to bind together. I used cinnamon basil rather than the traditional sweet basil which gave it an earthier taste. What I made was absolutely wonderful! It was also a very earthy color as the red from the tomatoes mixed with the green from the basil.

This was my first time making pesto. It was really easy. I was worried that the blender would not blend it properly but once the oil was added, it worked fine. I froze this for later use.

I made 48 servings worth of this recipe to have in the freezer for the year, but made it in 3 batches of 16 servings. I chopped the garlic and blended it with the almonds, added the oil (only 1 cup for the 16 servings), 1 tbsp of lemon juice, nutmeg and salt and pepper. After blending those I add the basil and mixed it with a spoon and then blend it while pouring about 1/3 cup of water into the blender. I froze the pesto into ice cube trays and silicone muffin cups. Will definitely make again.

I'm not sure how to properly measure a cup of leaves, but I'm thinking they should be packed down after making this recipe. Seemed to have too much oil in it, so next time I'll pack the leaves down more.

A good basic pesto! Per others' reviews I added parmesan cheese, and since I had no almonds I subbed pecan pieces that I toasted in a skillet. Served over medium shell pasta with herbed chicken breast chunks and fresh tomato.  Family thought they were getting a gourmet dinner!   Leftovers today for lunch!  YUM!

Yum!! We used pine nuts instead of almonds, and we didn't quite have enough basil so it ended up being quite garlicky tasting, but we loved it and it tasted so fresh and delicious. Thanks!!

I used this recipe with fresh basil from my garden. The toasted almonds give a nice flavour. I froze in ice cube trays to eat over winter. Doubling the recipe makes enough pesto for one ice cube tray.

Great idea to use almonds!  I toasted on stovetop, which was quick and easy.  Added a couple tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese and salt to taste.  Can be prepared in advance.

Toast almonds in a dry skillet, it's easier and faster and you can keep an eye on them much better, too. I used 2 cups of basil. This needs the tang and richness of Parmesan cheese (I added 1/4 cup of fresh grated). No nutmeg.

YUM! Loved this recipe cause it's so easy and the almonds are a nice change to the pine nuts which are hard to find & expensive in my small town. The second time I made it I added 1/2 tsp. cumin instead of nutmeg & the squeeze of one fresh lemon! I liked it even more this way!!!! (Note- be sure to use a good extra virgin olive oil for a better flavor). Thanks Rebecca!

This was very simple, and convenient and the taste was pretty good. A good everyday sort of recipe.  I needed to find a pesto sauce w/o parmesan, since I didn't have any on hand. However it was missed. If you find it kinda bland, add a tsp of lemon juice, that helped.

USE THIS RECIPE!!!  This is the best pesto I've made so far.  I did add lemon juice, salt and pepper and didn't exactly measure, but this was the best!  I had never heard of using almonds before, but it was really good, and a lot cheaper.  This is great to make if you grow herbs and garlic in your garden.  I will make a much bigger batch next time!  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  This was the first pesto sauce that I've ever made and it turned out fabulous!  I thought that the nutty flavor of the almonds overpowered the basil and garlic, but it still tasted great.  
Will definitely make again!

This is very good and easy to make. For those that don't like garlic you can substitute onions instead. I make mine that way. It is just as good.

This is a good basic pesto recipe which can be tweaked to individual preferences. One suggestion, for those who had difficulty processing the pesto... Buy one of those mini-food processors for jobs like these, as they're better suited than the full size machines.

Pretty good, but better with about 1/4 cup Parmesan added in.

This Pesto recipe was delicious! We made some adjestments, only used 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 cup of pinenuts, and 2 tbs of Parmesean cheese. Now we know what we will use the 20 basil plants in the garden for!! 

When storing pesto in the freezer, leave out any kind of cheese, Parmesan. If the pesto is frozen with it, the pesto will ferment.

Easy and delicious.  I prepared it according to recipe.  I tried to cut down the olive oil, but you need the full 1/2 cup to get the proper consistency.  After trying it, I did add some lemon juice, but it was still fantastic before I added it - the lemon juice just gave a little zing.

I chose this recipe because I had a bunch of basil that was going to go bad and I realized that my pine nuts had gone rancid. I added some parmesan cheese (probably about an ounce...i just cut off a chunk and threw it in) and replaced some of the oil with lemon juice to cut the fat a bit and heighten the flavor. SO YUM! We ate it with some roasted chicken.

Didn't have pine nuts so I halved and toasted almonds on skillet, covered for 10 mins on med-low flame. I do think more than 6 can be served with this recipe as is :-) I put some of this in mayo & it was so good! I also added this pesto to Allrecipe's Philly Pesto Pasta!!

This is the first time I ever made pesto and this was very good.  I liked that it did not require those expensive pine nuts.  Next time, more garlic!  I used three little guys; should have used three big guys.  Cloves that is, ha!  I used this over thin spaghetti tossed with shrimp & peas.  Yummy dinner!

great, easy recipe. the perfect way to use and preserve all the basil I had at the end of the summer. I made this in big batches, then froze it - then I grab a little as I need it. It's like it's summer all year long!

This was really good and very easy.  I usually have sliced almonds on hand, so I was glad the recipe included them instead of pine nuts.  I followed exactly except I added a handful of grated cheese to the mix. Very tasty!

Very tasty.  My first time making pesto, so I chose the easiest recipe with the most basic ingredients.  I had just juiced a fresh lemon and so I added some, along with a pinch of chili powder that another recipe called for.  I threw in a little frozen spinach, too.  Even with all these variations, it tasted great and will I will make again, using this same base recipe.

This pesto was super easy to make.  My first time making it and it turned out great.  It only took me 20 minutes start to finish (including cleanup).  I added a touch of lemon juice and an extra clove of galrlic.  Next time I will add a touch of Parm just to try it as alot of the reviews mentioned adding it.

Yummy!!!! This is so very good. I took the other reviewers advice and just toasted the almonds in a dry skillet. I made three batches of this because of my CSA basil  bounty...and with the last batch I used walnut oil instead of olive oil. So very good that way too. I did add some grated Romano cheese to it too.

I made a double batch and it was just enough to fill one ice cube tray for freezing. Very good basic recipe, but I made some adjustments. First of all, can pesto NOT have Parmesan cheese? I added 1/2 c. to my double batch (1/4 c. for a single) and a Tablespoon of lemon juice (1/2 T. for a single batch). I used roasted salted almonds and didn't bother toasting them.

This pesto was delicious. Some suggestions for cooks: -My first batch of almonds burned. For the second batch of almonds, I put them on the lower shelf and cooked for only 5 minutes.  -I don't have a food processor (only blender), so I banged the almonds with a meat hammer and then added them to the blender. This worked well.

This was exactly what I was looking for. The basic instructions for creating pesto. This recipe was great. I used walnuts instead of toasted almonds and measured more by eye than exact measurements. It turned out great!  It was also very good with chicken. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I had a lot of fresh basil from my own backyard and this recipe was so easy. I like the fact that it's almonds instead of pine nuts, which I'm not a big fan of. The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, and I think it came out better this way.

My basil plants were going crazy, so I decided to make my first pesto. This recipe is yummy. I had so many leaves, I doubled the recipe, used 5 cloves of garlic (it was plenty)blended all in the blender. Poured it all into an ice cube tray and the double recipe filled it perfectly. Tastes great, thank you for submitting.

You score "5 stars" for an excellent basic recipe with the added originality of using almonds instead of pine nuts. It was wonderful, as is. However, I do prefer my pesto with added parmesan cheese (the real stuff, not processed) and a touch of lemon juice. Your recipe accepted these modifications with delightful results.

Very easy to make and tasty. I added more garlic, but I always do. Thanks to those for the tip on just using a dry skillet to toast the almonds. Will use this recipe many more times. Thanks!

This recipe was awesome.  The only change I would make is keep the oven at a lower temperature and watch your nuts!  They definitely don't take 10 minutes to toast, I had to throw the first batch out because they burned on me.   I also used one clove of garlic, I thought 3 would be a little overboard.

I didn't have any pine nuts or walnuts so I decided to try this recipe.  I've never made a pesto without pine nuts, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It turned out a rich, vibrant green color and was simple and easy to make.  My almonds cooked in under 5 minutes so I would keep a watchful eye to make sure yours don't burn.  I would also add the garlic one at a time and after tasting only add more if necessary.  I ended up using all 3 cloves and it was a little too strong for my taste.  I also added a couple of tablespoons parmesan simply because I love cheese and to cut down on the bite of the garlic.  Because I was going to freeze it I decided to add a little fresh lemon juice to keep it from browning as suggested by other reviewers.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I kind of messed up with this recipe by doubling (!) the garlic.  I strongly suggest you do NOT do that!  6 cloves of  garlic was WAY too much!!!  SO, I then tried to dilute the garlic taste by adding more of the other stuff, therefore by the time I was done I had barely followed the recipe.  However ... I like pesto  with parm cheese in it, and this recipe didn't call for it.  Also, although I love pesto and was aware that pesto had oil in it, making this recipe myself with all that oil kind of grossed me out!  I'll never look at pesto the same way again!  SO, i'm going to keep looking for the perfect pesto recipe which to me would have parm cheese in it and, if possible, less oil.  Oh, the almonds did actally work okay, which surprised me.

This was great! I did add Parm cheese and extra garlic. The cheese really gives it a much better flavor and adds a little something extra so the basil and nuts are not so over powering. I do like using almonds instead of pine nuts like some of the other recipes call for. :-)

Great "starter" recipe.  I added fresh parmesan and used a mixture of basils from my herb garden.  Will make again, but will try with pignoli nuts and a bit less garlic.

Good basic pesto, only had walnuts, will have to try almonds next time.  Added a little fresh grated parmesan and a little lemon juice.  So simple, but so lucious.

This was very easy to make and a good way to start using the basil from the herb garden I put in this year.  I liked it but the rest of the family was not impressed.  Maybe a little too much garlic for kids?  I made it and used it right away.  I wonder if the flavors would blend a bit more if next time I made it ahead of time.

This was so easy and so delicious. Had it with bow tie pasta. Looked gorgeous and tasted great. I took someone's suggestion and blanched the basil and added Parmesan cheese. Other than that, stuck with the recipe and it didn't disappoint!

Perfect!!!  I substituted the Almonds with unsalted Sunflower Seeds.  They're much closer in flavor to the traditional Pine Nuts at a fraction of the price of Almonds (about 30 cents from weigh-your-own aisle at the supermarket).

Love that it uses Almonds instead of pinenutes. I doubled it and added a tablespoon and a half of parmesan cheese. Love it!  And so easy. I also toasted the almonds on a dry skillet on the stove top. Much easier then turning the oven on.  Enjoy!

As-is, I found it a little bland, but it was definitely VERY easy to make.  I added some parmesan, lemon juice, garlic salt (in addition to the 3 cloves) and a couple mint leaves, and then it had enough tang for me.  Also toasted the almonds on the stovetop instead of in the oven.

I make this often with a few changes.  I use walnuts instead of almonds (just what I usually have on hand) and skip the toasting step.  I'm a working mom for goodness sake!  :)  I usually throw in some parmesan cheese as well.  I freeze this in ice cube trays for future use.  My favorite is a pesto chicken salad....shredded leftover chicken, chickpeas, celery, tomatoes, broccoli slaw, and a few cubes of pesto.  Great healthy lunch to bring to work.  Yum!

I am a graduate Home Economist and have worked for two major food companies.  I was looking for an easy
quick recipe to use some of the basil growing in my yard.  This recipe, in my opinion, is incomplete and flawed.  It does not say what type of almonds to use - whole, slivered, chopped??  I had whole almonds with
skins on so I used them.  It says bake 10 min. at 450, I did 8 min. and they were close to too brown.  I used
1 garlic clove, not 3, and that would have been enough.  The result was a greenish brown sauce that we tried but it was largely uneatable.  I now know the almonds were the problem.  How hard would it be to list
the type of almonds to use?? Slivered, chopped, etc??  Very disappointing!

This is a really fantastic dairy-free pesto recipe and it is super easy. You can substitute walnuts and pistachios with great results. For 2 cups basil I added 1.5tsp lemon juice and grated some lemon zest into it for brightness.

I love basil and was looking for a good solid recipe to be able to make and freeze pesto to use up my herbs. I was really quite happy with this one except that the garlic was really overpowering...and I love garlic. I like that it used almonds as well, great thrifty alternative  to other nuts. I'll definitely be using this recipe as a base for the future, but tweaking slightly to suit my tastes. Excellent and easy recipe!!

It's so very tasty! We made several batches of this last fall when we harvested huge piles of basil from our garden. We froze most of the pesto in pans lined with wax paper, then broke up the frozen sheets and stacked them in freezer bags. So any time of year I need the fresh pesto taste, I pull out a couple of chunks and let them thaw!

Definitely easy to make. I found the recipe as shown to be a little too oily so I reduced the amount of olive oil next time I did it and it turned out great.  I also added a generous helping of pepper as well.

This made great pesto! Warning to the unwise (like myself) if you are using sliced almonds, only bake them for 3-4 minutes, and watch them closely. I almost burnt mine!

This recipe was fair, but the garlic needed to be reduced, and about two cups of Parmesan cheese needs to be added. :P

This came out very well.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I added an extra clove of garlic and a little lemon juice.  I used a pinch of black pepper and 1/2 tsp salt.  I also used closer to 1/2 cup almonds (it was the end of a bag).  If you're using a blender rather than a food processor, I recommend pulsing until it's the texture you want.

Delicious. I didn't do exact measurement and the pesto still turned out really nicely. This recipes is very forgiving. I doubled the garlic and used 1/2 cup of pine nuts instead of almonds. My little toddler (17 months old) even likes it.

Very easy and delicious! I omitted the nutmeg, didn't have that on hand. I used closer to 2 cups of basil leaves, and would probably add the oil to the blender first, because the leaves and almonds made the blades stick. I used this recipe with "Pesto Pasta with Chicken" and it turned out great! I will make more of this in batches to freeze and thaw as needed. Super easy!

This is the first time I've ever made Pesto, and I had high hopes of this recipe.  I followed it exactly, except I toasted the pine nuts in a skillet.  The result, for me, is OK, but not great (unlike the Pesto I have tasted when I eat out).  I will try a different Pesto recipe next time (I have lots of basil growing on my porch).

Easy and great with almonds! I soaked slivered almonds in water for 10 minutes before toasting them on a dry, hot pan. I feel like this achieves the best flavor and texture. I also basically doubled the garlic because I didn't think it had enough for my tastes. I didn't have nutmeg either. Finally, I added some parmesan cheese to enhance the flavor.

This basic recipe was easy to build on. I used both basil and arugula, walnuts instead of almonds (untoasted) and I added some feta cheese. It turned out really well.

This was wonderful and easy.  The only nut I had on hand was walnuts.   I've never heard of anyone toasting walnuts......and didn't.  The pesto was delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

I tried using the oven to toast my almonds and that was a definite mistake.  My oven does not have a glass front on the door so I could not see how they were doing.  I am not sure if I over toasted the almonds or should have let them cool down more, but I could barely taste the basil when it all came together.  The toasted almonds took over the flavor.  Perhaps using pine nuts would be better because their flavor is not quite as strong.  Hopefully it will taste better after the flavors have had time to meld together.

I had some fresh basil that I needed to use quickly, and this was the perfect way to do it!  As is, the recipe is fantastic, but I felt it was definitely missing a little something. A squeeze of lemon juice turned out to be exactly what it needed.  Perfect!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was good. Not the best, but good for how easy it is. I must add though, that if you bake almonds at 450 for 10 minutes, you end up with black almonds. I made this mistake and I want spare others the same mistake. I had never toasted almonds in the oven before so I was just going by what the recipe said.

My usual pesto recipe was packed away in a box so I was searching for a recipe to use up the basil in my garden. This was very good. I used pine nuts instead of almonds and I always add good parmesan to my pesto- with those minor changes  this was perfect for us.

Very good, simple pesto. One thing to note - make sure no almonds make it through the food processing stage... you could end up with a rather crunchy pesto!

Loved this recipe, I will admit I did not measure everything exactly, but just by eye-balling it I know I was very close.  You don't need to change a thing, but I think I may try adding some grated parmesan next time and may switch up the nuts just for variety.  I will be making this often as a change from red sauce...and not to mention I now have a basil plant.

This was truly 'easy' pesto and it earned rave reviews from guests even though I skipped toasting the almonds. I did use the parmesan tip another member suggested, and added coarse ground pepper at the end. Three yums UP!

Fantastic recipe, however I feel that there was a bit too much olive oil. I found that 1/2 cup of olive oil left my pesto fairly runny. Still, the taste of the pesto is fantastic and I look forward to making it again.

I am only giving it 4 stars because the first day I ate it.. I did not like it all that much, and I couldn't get the garlic taste out of my mouth... but the next day when I reheated the left overs... it was FABULOUS! I did not toast my almonds, and I added some parm, but that was it. I am new to the whole pesto thing, and I love all the different ways you can make it. I definetly will go back to this recipe, but I will heat up the pesto first to cook some of that raw garlic taste out before eating.

Delicious!  I use fresh basil from my garden, I toasted the almonds the first time I made this, and it was great!  Since then I usually just use whole raw almonds and throw everything in the processer.  I have also used pinenuts, toasted first in the oven.

Thought I would miss parmesan cheese and pine nuts, which are typically included in pesto recipes, but didn't miss them at all. This really seems to highlight the basil flavor, which is why you want pesto in the first place.  Be careful with the size of your garlic cloves:  The cloves I used were large (like bigger than an almond), and it was borderline too garlicky, even for a garlic-lover like me.  This recipe is easy.  I even made it a day ahead, covered and refrigerated it.  Next day, I brought it to room temp. and mixed it with pasta and chicken.  This is the recipe I'll use again.

I made this pesto along with the Pesto Pasta with Chicken recipe and it turned out really good.  My husband loved it and gave it 10 stars!  My daughter and I prefer a little more sauce and will try doubling the pesto recipe or adding more olive oil next time.  I also sauteed some mushrooms and added them.  Yummy Pesto Sauce and very simple.

Awesome... I love something so simple and fresh tasting.  I put it in the "Pasta with pesto and scallops" from this site, (except I did portobellos and no scallops).  I ate so much I got a tummy ache. :)  I will never buy pesto sauce or paste again!

Worked for me!  With some homemade pasta, it was a great lunch.  But watch for browning of the sauce if you plan on pre-preparing it.  I had a 15 minute wait between making the sauce and eating it, and the top was already starting to brown.

Super on pasta.  I also had to make quite a bit more to fit im my "mixer".  I added olives, canned mushrooms and pecans(what I had on hand).  Kids and dad loved it.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. I did toast my almonds stove top. Next time I would at least double the amount of garlic to add more flavor; I thought it was just a tad bland. Also the addition of some parmesan cheese would help a lot! But all in all, it was good as is.

This was really yummy Rebbecca.  Thanks!  I couldn't believe how fast it was and way cheaper and better tasting than the pre-made store bought stuff,  I wanted to make it lower in fat so I used 1/3 water to replace 2/3 the oil.  I suppose you could use lemon juice too but I loved it as made.  I served it over linguine with a bit of fresh shredded Parmesan cheese and some toasted pine nuts.  I made it twice.  It was better made with toasted pine nuts rather than almonds, although, both were great.

Wonderful nutty, robust flavor. Great texture. It holds true its name,it was a snap to put together. I used 1 cup basil and 1/2 cup cilantro; it gave it a bit of zip which was delicious. I used 1/2 cup EVOO and an extra clove of garlic and tossed in grilled chicken tenderloins. I plan to use this one again and again!

This sauce is fast, easy, and delicious! I love how quick it is to prepare and low-hassle. My husband and I ate 2-3 servings, it's so good! The only thing is that we add 2-3 cloves more garlic (personal preference), a squeeze of 1-2 limes, and threw in some grated parmesan (from a can) and it's great. You don't have to put those things in and it's still pretty good, but with it, it's a favorite in our home.

This reads so easy and with almonds. thats the good news.I will surely try it and come back with a review.
A simple tip on toasting nuts is to heat the oven on its higest temp.(250 degrees celsius) switch off the oven and place a tray of nuts.Forget about it.When the oven is cool (about 1/2 an hour) you will find the nuts beautifully toasted without the bother of checking for doneness or stirring every few minutes.

Pretty good, basic recipe.  I tried to toast the almonds and they ended up black (good thing I had extras), so I put in them in a dry frying pan and toasted them that way.

This is a great basic recipe for pesto. We were due for a hard freeze this week and I hated to waste all that lovely basil in my garden so I doubled the recipe.  If you do double this recipe, I wouldn't recommend increasing the amount of garlic.  Like others I made a few changes adding a little shredded Parmesan and lemon juice. Whatever you do, don't leave out the nutmeg!

Great pesto!  I loved the almonds (quickly toasted in a hot skillet) and added ~1/8 c fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I tried to go light on the oil, but ended up adding more to the pasta to get the right consistency - use the amount called for.  I'll be using this recipe frequently.

This is fantastic! I have a child who needs non-dairy and was delighted to find this recipe, which she loves!. I added some parmesan after taking out a generous portion without. I also used it to marinate chick n breasts...it was good but needed a bit more salt and pepper.

I made this as part of an elimination diet that didn’t allow dairy, so this alternative fit the bill perfect! I ended up using roasted cashews because I had them on hand. This was super delicious on salmon! We will definitely make it again!

I used this recipe as a base for my pesto. I had never made pesto, but I had a huge bunch of basil from the farmers market. I used toasted raw pumpkin seeds in place of the nuts. I also added the zest and juice of 1 lemon. Added salt and pepper to taste and added the parm cheese. Came out delicious. It made enough to freeze a jar for later. Super easy. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought it was a bit too oily for my liking....am going to add Parmesan cheese before serving next time.  Husband wasn’t a fan of the nut texture [i couldn’t get them puréed enough)...however I love texture in my food.

I made this with a few altercations and it was delicious!!! I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and replaced the rest with 1/8 cup water, added 1/4 of a juiced lemon wedge, and because I didn’t have enough fresh basil I used spring mix for bulk and color  and dried basil to keep the flavor. The creamy nuttiness of this is delicious!i definitely with be making again. Maybe I just like it too much, but I think you could only get 3ish servings out of it.

I have made this several times. It’s great! Also, I was able to cut the recipe down to 2 servings by using the smaller cup on my magic bullet but I made a mental note to try my cuisinart miniprep chopper if going that small again.

This is very easy and the substitute of toasted almonds for pine nuts is really tasty.  I blended the pesto with Alfredo sauce, yum!

By itself it seemed a little dry. When mixed with bowtie pasta and shrimp, it was incredibly good. Wow. Great dish. I will be making this again!

It is true to its title - very easy! I think the garlic is a little much, so if you make that mistake and you find yours too garlicky, I added some lemon juice to cut the garlic flavor.

This is a good recipe, we doubled it for use in our cafe. I had to use peanuts because the pine nuts are almost impossible to find in Vietnam and...if you do find them, very expensive.

A good mild pesto, easy to make and great (average flavor).

Really tasty!!! Roasted my almonds in a pan instead of oven like other reviewers suggested which is so much faster. It was chunkier than what I expected (maybe due to my crappy food processor unable to fine grind the almonds) but delicious nonetheless. I used really good olive oil and it was perfection. Excited to try with parmesan next time.

The toasted almonds gave this pesto a little different taste than your normal pesto.   Will try with a little less olive oil the next time though.

The pesto is great!  I loved the use of almonds instead of pine nuts, because that's what I had on hand.  I used the iron skillet to roast the almonds and that worked out fine.

I liked the recipe, especially using almonds in place of the pine nuts. It did make the texture of the pesto a little grainy, but it wasn't a problem for us. I recommend running the nuts through the food processor first, makes the texture better. I did add Parmesan and a hit of salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

I ended up making this for the first time and loosely followed the recipe, added Parmesan cheese, and omitted the nutmeg as I didn't have any. It turned out amazingly! I ended up adding a little more olive oil, as I had more basil I was using. I was using pre- crumbled almonds and toasted them, this made my prep time very short, and ended up with a finer result.

I'm not much of a pesto person but had some basil from the CSA this week.  I LOVE roasted almonds so had those on hand.  Made as intended except I didn't have the real garlic so used powdered.  Good and easy.  My family even tried it and ate more than the obligatory "no thank you" bite.

Best non dairy pesto...hands down!  I used my mini chopper and toasted the almonds on the stovetop.  First batch I made I used large cloves of garlic and even for me it was too much (I love garlic!). So make sure to use small cloves and add more if needed. I tried it with added lemon juice and it was good but I don't think it needs it.  It's perfect as is! I was literally licking the bowl and spoon! Definitely a keeper!

Oh man...delicious!  I roasted a couple onions, 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms and misc other garden fresh veggies, boiled up a pound of pasta and combined.  We ate it hot for dinner.  I took the leftovers cold to a block party last night.  Fabulous.  One woman was trying to figure out what was chewy...it's the almonds.  What a great idea!

Toasted the almonds over a gas stove burner In a heavy, dry pan. Almost skipped the nutmeg but it added a nice flavor level. Doubled the recipe and used the blender. Yum. Even the kids ate it.

I was looking for a dairy-free pesto and found this. I also liked the fact that it called for almonds rather than pine nuts. The flavor was very good. Thanks!

I tried this and it just didn't have enough zing.  I doubled the nutmeg, added about 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. of lemon juice!  DELISH!

Awesome!  So easy and tastes great-I used almonds instead of pinenuts.

This pesto was very easy to make & looked pretty also.  Do NOT toast the almonds for 10 minutes.  If you do they will come out black & charred.  Two minutes worked for me @ 350.  I used a blender instead of my big food processor because I felt that I just had a little bit of ingredients and they would get lost in my processor.  My blender worked really well.  I blended the almonds first by themselves to get them chopped up really good then added the remaining ingredients.  The pesto was thick so I will thin it down.  Overall, good recipe.

Wow!  I followed the recipe as written.  I roasted the almonds whole and waited until they were completely cool before using them.  Like another poster said, it takes longer to set up and tear down the food processor than it does to complete this recipe.  I put it on some crackers and grated some parm cheese on top.  The flavor is very "earthy".  It tastes like something you would get at a nice restaurant!  I plan on making a bunch this summer and freezing it in ice cube trays.  This was my first attempt at pesto and I'm hooked!

This pesto recipe is very good! I've never made pesto before. It was super-easy with no fuss. The most difficult part for me was getting my food processor to work! I used it for a chicken and pasta recipe I was doing. The only thing I changed was not toasting the almonds. I didn't want to take the time to preheat my oven. I will definitely make this again!

Made the recipe according to the full serving directions. I was using a blender and ran into the problem of short blades. The problem was solved after adding about 1/2c to 1 cup of milk to increase the volume that could be reached by the blades. Also added more almonds (about 1/2 cup). Delicious and easy to make!

I did not like it at all.  The raw garlic overpowered the basil.  I would saute the garlic in the olive oil first or use half as much.

This is delicious and so simple to prepare. I doubled the recipe and froze most of the pesto. I did add some parmesan cheese since I had it on hand. I'll be making this again, I'm sure - I have an abundance of basil in the garden right now. Thanks for the recipe!

I had doubts about this at first. The aroma coming out of the food processor wasn't good. But once I added some extra garlic and lemon juice and made it into a cream sauce it was delicious. I would experiment with adding more things to the mix. I suspect this is meant to be a base recipe a cook can customize to his or her taste.

I've never made pesto before and was a bit intimated - now that I made this super easy pesto, I wish I had done it earlier! Three cloves of garlic definitely gives it a kick, but a good one! I love this recipe and am very unlikely to go searching for another one. I will be using this pesto tonight to make pesto-stuffed pork chops. yum!

I've been making larger batches all summer using basil from our garden.  I freeze in ice cube trays and then place frozen cubes into a freezer bag.  I can then pull out the number of cubes needed for a recipe that calls for 'tub pesto' or add to other dishes as I choose!  Goes great with a variety of chicken dishes and/or pastas!

LOved the almonds, pan toasted as suggested (I usually use pecans). While it can be made in about 5 minutes, the cleaning, washing, trimming, and cutting the basil adds about 30 minutes more.Worth it!

I have made this twice now and it is great. I've used it on pizza and pasta and it is fabulous and oh so easy. I usually double the recipe, but keep the oil amount the same and add additional oil as needed. Fabulous recipe!

I can't believe it was so easy and tasty!  I did toast the nuts on the stove top as suggested in earlier comment, and substituted walnuts (that's what I had) and it was great.  I've made it twice now...also great on little dry toasts/ italian bread or pasta and can adjust the amount oil used.  I used my homegrown basil, but found if you don't have the 1 1/2 c. basil, it is better to add basil from grocery, rather than reduce the recipe-the ratio is just right! Freezes well, just allow enough time to thaw before next use.

This was my first attempt at making pesto.  Great base recipe.  I doubled the garlic, halved the oil and added lemon juice.  The garlic & oil are definitely personal flavor preferences but I think the lemon juice is essential.  I will use this recipe every year I expect.  Thanks.

very good however: i used almonds already toasted form bj's, more than it says to.  more nutmeg than a pinch, some parm. cheese.  good if i have basil to use up. good over whole wheat spagetti, even matthew liked it (i didn't tell him what was in it) 7/09

The recipe was ok, but the nut taste is overpowering in this dish. Neither my husband or I enjoyed this. It was decent enough to eat because we already cooked it, but we would not make it again.

yum. this was great over pasta with barbequed grilled citrus chicken and some kebobs made with brussel sprouts and purple onion. i always toast my nuts in my nonstick skillet instead of bothering w/ the oven.

This is awesome!  I used pine nuts, but did not change anything else.  My husband and I both LOVED it!  Used it in the Penne with Chicken and Pesto recipe on here.  YUM!

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have nutmeg, but I didn't miss it.  I used it in the Pesto Polenta Lasagna recipe on this site and it worked wonderfully!

I appreciate having a pesto recipe with almonds as an alternative to the more expensive pine nuts.  Truth be told though, I thought it was pretty good - but would have likely been better with the pine nuts!  It is a good basic recipe to start from though.

This was very good, even my picky 13yr old liked it, the only thing I changed is I used pine nuts instead of almonds.

Wow, this is a great recipe! 
I had never made pesto before, and this was such an easy recipe to follow and it turned out beautifully!
I did add about 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the food processor after I had blended everything else.
I served this over gnocci at a potluck pasta night and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make this again and freeze some so I have extras for another time. Yummy!

Five stars!  Easy to make, tasty, and cheaper than buying it already prepared in the store or buying pine nuts. I followed PatiO's advice and decreased the oil and used a little water.  You can't tell there's less oil.  Also, ten minutes was too long for the almonds; the first batch ended up burned perhaps it was the toaster oven?  The second time, I baked the almonds for 6 minutes and they were perfect.  I think parmesan would be a nice addition but I don't need any more calories so I will wait and add it on top of my pasta.  This is a definite keeper.

This is super easy and very good. I like that it uses almonds, which are cheaper and easier to find than pine nuts. This makes for a very easy meal when you toss with some linguine!

As another reviewer suggested, I added some parmesan cheese to balance the flavors out.  I also added some fresh parmesan.  Delicious!

Followed the recipe as stated except I had no nutmeg and added in some Romano + parmasean cheese. I also added in some roasted cherry tomatoes and roasted red pepper. Btw, I'm a huge garlic lover and three garlic cloves was more then enough for me, so I wouldn't suggest adding more. Used seashell pasta. Pretty nice dish.

I would have never thought to use almonds instead of the pine nuts. I did have to stir some in at the end for looks. Tastes better then store brands and better then the ones at my farmers market! I will make over and over as I have basil coming out my ears in the garden. Just wish it could be canned!

Excellent Pesto!  I added several hunks of parmesan and that made it even better.  Added an extra clove of garlic.  I also threw more (untoasted) almonds into the processor.  1/4 cup wasn't quite enough for me.  Cooked some whole wheat rotini while the almonds toasted, then blended everything and immediately enjoyed fresh pesto over my noodles.  Fantastico!  Will definitely be making again now that I know how easy it is!  :o)
