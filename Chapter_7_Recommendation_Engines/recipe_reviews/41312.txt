I made this for Thanksgiving and the family was fighting over it so I had to make two for Christmas and they hid it so that the guest could not eat it.

This is a nice light alternative to regular cheesecake.  A good follow up to a heavy meal.  This dessert's presentation is deceiving for how easy it is to make (about 35 minutes).  The crust was very hard and I'm not sure how to change that.  Also, the next time I may add some kind of liquor to give it a little bit more flavor.  The recipe calls for a 12 oz container of whipped topping and they only come in 8 & 16 oz.  The 8 oz container was more than enough as I could not even fit the entire mixture into the pan and the whipped topping takes some of the cheesecake flavor away.  Also make sure you use a large mixing bowl.

What a fast, easy and impressive dessert! I made this using lemon pie filling on top. The 3 oz. package of ladyfingers at my local store bakery had 24 ladyfingers in it so I bought 2 packs and was able to get 26 ladyfingers around my 10" Wilton springform pan. The presentation was beautiful and my family was quite impressed with this tasty masterpiece. I used half of an 8 oz. container of cool whip as other reviewers mentioned that using all the whipped toppping left the cheesecake with too much of a whipped topping taste. Using half the whipped topping was good but I may use even less next time or maybe none at all. I will experiment with that. I agree with another reviewer, use a large mixing bowl. Overall, this is a real winner and I will make this using other toppings for variety.

A very beatiful dessert if you are having a party or get-together.  I found the cool whip to be strong tasting, so I used a little less the second time I made it.  Still tasty and easy!

I have made this many times and have always been asked for the recipe.  Now, I always take copies of the recipes with me when I take this dessert anywhere.  I have been asked to make this recipe again after a year had passed from when I first made it.  They hadn't forgotten it!

Great recipe!! This got rave reviews at our office potluck. 
I buy the no bake cheesecake with the topping included, so no need to buy seperate can of pie filling. Also have tried it with the low cal instant cheesecake and low fat cream cheese and lite frozen whipped topping and have been pleased with the results.

Excellent cheesecake and easy!  When the store runs out of ladyfingers (because I waited too long to get them), I just use decorative cookies.  Very pretty on the dessert buffet also!  I made one for church and people were asking for the recipe.  Only remember to put wax paper on the bottom because the crust stuck to the pan and no one cut deep or hard enough to know there was a crust.  But they still raved about it!

This was the hit of my work potluck, after reading the other reviews I used 2 pkgs of cream cheese and all the cool whip. It was great.

I was dared into making this cheesecake by co-workers. Wow!  So easy to make and the presentation was gorgeous. I left off the ladyfingers and use strawberry pie filling. Everyone loved it.

OK, I know its not from scratch but its really good. I have made it twice and it is very easy, looks beautiful and tasty. Not as firm as a "real" cheesecake. Finding the ladyfingers was a challange but did find them in the deli section of a grocery store. There is a recipe here for home ladyfingers, have not tried that yet. Took this to a church dinner,none left. I Will make again and again!

This is a dessert I do several times of year.  Also, what's nice is that I  can vary the toppings...I sometimes buy 2 boxes of the strawberry cheesecake by Jell-O and use the strawberry topping that comes in the boxes and add big  strawberries in dipped in chocolate for an awesome presentation.  I also add a wired ribbon (with the color complementing the topping of the cake) around the ladyfingers (I secure the ribbon with a dot of hot glue) and tie it with a bow in front for a nice added touch.  I've also done a topping of pineapple with yellow gigham bow...The possiblities are endless with this dessert!  You won't be dissapointed and neither with your guests!
