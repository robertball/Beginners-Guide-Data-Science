Very good.  I actually forgot the parsley, but I would recommend adding about 1/4 tsp of salt to the sauce (unless you add a lot to your pasta water).  The texture was perfect, but the salt really helped add some flavor.  Great if you add some leftover chicken breast.

I think this had a bit too much garlic.  It was a little overpowering.  I really like fettuccini, but this is a recipe that I would probably not make again.

Very tasty, could not tell it was low fat. Easy way to make homemade alfredo sauce. My recommendation is to double the recipe, because you'll want leftovers!

Whipped this up, quadrupling (Except amount of milk...Add SLOWLY UNTIL IT MEETS YOUR AESTHETIC / TEXTURAL NEEDS) - adding in shredded up chicken breast, and broccoli florets and a touch of nutmeg.  Used "NO YOKE" noodles, as it's all I had on hand.  Perfectly creamy, great flavor.  Will make again.

This is pretty good for a lighter sauce; however, I wouldn't call it "Alfredo" because it didn't really taste like alfredo at all.  Just a thick white sauce with a pleasant flavor.  (A lot better than another light alredo sauce recipe I've tried from here).  It was a good way to use up some Neufchatel that needed using though.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley and I enjoyed that.  Served with whole wheat fettuccini and spinach salad.

I added mushrooms, broccoli and green onions and used whole weat penne pasta and this was absolutely wonderful, especially for a lower fat / cholesterol recipe. I will be making this more often.
thanks for sharing.

This recipe was excellent and easy to make.  We grilled chicken and added it to the pasta and sauce and had a salad for a great meal.  Great recipe for diabetics or anyone.

This was quite tasty for a lower fat dish.  I will double the amount of fettucine I use next time, though, because there was a lot of sauce.

Quite tasty for being low-fat.  I made this for my fiance who refuses to eat any low-fat/low-cal foods, and even he really liked it!

I could not find Neufachatel Cheese. I'm not sure if that was the problem,and I could never get the sauce to thicken. While I was eating, I couldn't decide if it was good or just ok....

I was looking for some good, low-carb recipes, and I found one in this.  I too used whole wheat fettucine, and it was delicious.

Now this was a fettuccini my diabetic husband actually liked.  So many diabetic recipes lack the flavor of the original recipes; this one passed the test.

I made this recipe with whole wheat fettuccini and it was great!  My husband is diabetic and this fit right in with his carbo requirements for dinner.  I served it with fresh biscuits, baked sweet potato and sliced raw yellow and orange peppers.  Excellent!

Top notch Alfredo sauce. Followed the recipe exactly and my 11. Year old devoured it. She recently discovered she likes Alfredo sauce so on a school day off I made this. She wanted shrimp added to it so we did that the first time with a little bit of siracha sauces and the second go round the next evening she added smoked sausage. Both additions she said were tasty.  Very versatile and very easy to make. Great recipe thank you
