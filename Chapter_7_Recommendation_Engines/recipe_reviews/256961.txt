Super simple, great way to have take with you breakfast for the kids.  I didn't add onions because I don't like them but n my eggs. However, I did put a 1/2 English muffin in the bottom before adding the egg/cheese to give a more  take and go ability to hold in your hand. I will be making these again, the kids loved them.

Great breakfast for low carb -ers.  Easy too.  I use just one slice of deli  ham, and even though it's thin, and maybe even some holes in it, the egg firms up inside the "cup" and they hold their shape.  Yum!
