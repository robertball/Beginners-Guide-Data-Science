This was so good!  I served it at a cast party for a play about a Norwegian family- everyone raved about it!  I guess the starch in the rice helps to thicken the soup, but there wasn't any noticeable thickness.  I didn't waste the rice though, I tranferred it to another pan, cooked it in more water, and mixed it with some instant vanilla pudding to make a mock rice pudding.  I think I may try strawberries next time because the raspberry seeds are hard to eat.

This fruit soup  is very refreshing, but I could do without the rice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipie bu did add a cup more of the red raspberries.  Very cool on a hot summer day.

Served this to guests over the weekend and everyone raved about it.  I didn't bother to peel the apple, and it was fine.  The only changes I will make next time will be to give the cherries a rough chop so they aren't too big, and maybe use more rice or simmer it for longer, to get the soup to thicken up a bit more.  Don't throw away the rice, just save it to eat for breakfast with some butter and a little extra cinnamon.

I served this as a desert at an end of summer brunch with friends, they loved it! I did not use rice or cherries, I used my mothers recipe which calls for pearl barley and prunes and sometimes she will use tapioca in place of the barley.

We tried this with stawberries, apples, and raisons since we did not have the cherries or raspberries.  My son loves soup and fruit... now he likes them together!  Did not use whip cream... it was very sweet with the strawberries... we did add a pinch of sea salt before serving instead. I am not sure if this could still be the same recipe, but it was very tasty.
