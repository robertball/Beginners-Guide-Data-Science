I followed the recipe except used low fat half and half.  It turned out well, the wife and daughter having seconds. I personally found it a bit bland but a few drops of tobacco  gave it a nice tingle.  Visually the color could be more appetizing and next time would cook the potatoes less  as they disintegrate.  Worth a try.

7.30.16   I had really sweet summer corn which made this chowder really good.  Fresh corn is the only way to go on this folks, so put that frozen corn back into the freezer.  The chowder wasn’t quite as thick as I would have preferred, so I did add additional flour to get it to the consistency I like.  Next time, I’ll cut the potatoes into larger pieces, maybe 1/2”.  I know that’ll add some time to partially cook them, but I think I’ll like that better, and the chowder’s eye appeal will improve, as well.  I used fat free half-and-half, and it worked well.  I think  crumbled crisp bacon would be a nice garnish.  KandyKates, enjoyed your chowder!

Excellent!  I added 1/2 tablespoon of flour.  I used 1 large russet potato and 1 medium.  Also eliminated green pepper, substituted chopped carrots.  Will definitely make it again

It was ok not great. Was runny and bland. I used fresh corn and half and half. I added some red pepper flakes which helped but still bland.
