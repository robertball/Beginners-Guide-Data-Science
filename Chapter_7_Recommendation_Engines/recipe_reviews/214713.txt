Really quick, and quite tasty! I made these for a "healthier" late night snack (made with dill pickle relish and fat free Miracle Whip). I used five eggs and 1 medium potato, and still had plenty of filling left. I will definitely make these again, especially if I go to a reunion or such. The filling is very manageable and seemed to hold its form better than regular stuffed eggs. Thanks!

I am gonna start by saying, I don't like deviled eggs.  However, because I was assigned to bring them to a family dinner, I had to at least try!  These were yummy.  I did make a few changes.

My changes:
*I got rid of the relish and miracle whip/salad dressing, because I don't like either of those. (I used mayo instead of the miracle whip)
*I added some chopped celery and onions, and chives (for crunch and flavor)
*I threw the yolks, veggies, mayo, salt and pepper, and chives into a food processor and blended everything up so there were not huge chunks of potato in the eggs
*I garnished with paprika and a few sprigs of chives.

Overall, a great dish.  This is my new go to deviled egg recipe!
*

Everyone enjoyed these eggs.  I made 12, so I added 1 tsp of mustard and 2 tsp of mayo.  I also just diced up a sweet pickle since I didn't have any relish.  Will definitely make again!

Because I do not keep pickle relish or Miracle Whip on hand, I used a few finely diced garlic pickles and mayonnaise. I did add in a half teaspoon each of onion/garlic powder. We really enjoyed these deviled eggs. I'd make these again. I'd like to figure out how to shortcut cook the potatoes for this recipe--tha

Oh my - these eggs deserve a 5+ star rating.  The potato in this recipe adds a lot of texture to the filling.  I made these for dinner last weekend and everyone LOVED these.  They had fun trying to guess what the ingredients were.  To make it  true potato salad deviled eggs I added minced fresh onion and celery.  We really enjoy deviled eggs and I like trying different varieties, but I do think it will be hard to top these.  Thanks LRD2003 for sharing this recipe.  They are delicious!

Thank you "Brookenelson" for your little changes.  We loved them and will keep this recipe in our "entertaining" file.  Gives a lot of "yolky' filling without being too rich.
Wonderful!

I tweaked a little by adding a little dill pickle juice and used real mayo instead of miracle whip. My picky family LOVED it.  I'm making more to take to a bbq today.  YUMMY

What a clever concept!  I added a rib of celery and a small onion and seasoned with celery salt and pepper.  Next time I will puree the filling mixture in the food processor so I can pipe it into the egg halves - spooning my finely chopped mixture in wasn't very neat.  Thanks for a great recipe, this will be my go-to picnic dish from now on!

I just happened to be baking potatoes when I found this recipe, so I used one of those. Easy and just delicious. We loved them! My son took a dozen to dinner at his friend's home, and he said they loved them, too.

I neglected to read the reviews before making this recipe, as I usually do. I chopped some onion and also used dill relish. I didn't have Miracle Whip, but used a vegan mayo with a small splash of an Italian vinaigrette instead. Really, really good variation on a typical deviled egg recipe! Having now read the reviews I wish I had added chopped celery, but I will next time. I pretty much stuck to the recipe otherwise,though I did make 12 eggs. I did add some Penzey's coarse ground Telicherry Black Pepper as my family loves its dishes very peppery which gave the egg/potato mixture a nice snap. Will make this one again. So good!

This is good idea (one star), but didn't turn out good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely using quality ingredients.  I used dill relish, mayonnaise, a yukon gold potato, dijon mustard, and fresh ranch eggs.  I the only thing I added was some garlic powder for added flavor and they were still very bland!  I put the potato and other ingredients through the food processor.  That was a mistake.  The consistency was gluey.  It may have been better if I had mashed the potato with a fork and folded it into the other stuff.  Since I didn't, I gave the recipe a second star to make up for it.  If you really want potato salad stuffed eggs, I suggest you use your regular potato salad recipe in small quantity and stuff the eggs with that. Personally, I will never make these again--back to a traditional stuffed egg recipe.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time. The only thing I changed is that I cut my egg whites into pieces and mix it in. A lot less work but still the same great taste :)

Never have I ever heard of putting potatoes in deviled eggs until now. I made 64 deviled eggs for Xmas and decided to just scope out different  ways to make them and saw this. I admit I didn’t follow the filling instructions. Used a fork and crushed up the potato with the yolks then proceeded to add relish, a tad of mayo, mustard and lots of vinegar as my family likes them tangy, salt and pepper. The filling actually stays put and is firm on these. I was amazed. Made 2 days before Xmas and by then there were 4 left...I have found my perfect way to make them.  I wish I had thought to add onion. Saved the excess filling (there was a lot) and was going to add onion for potato salad but my boyfriend gobbled it up lol. 5 stars hands down.

EGGcellent recipe!! lol.  Only having red potatoes, I boiled 2 w/a little salt.  Having a picky husband, I used 1tsp mustard & it tastes GREAT. If it wasn't for him I would have used 2tsp. Next time, w/my 1tsp mustard, I'll add another tsp relish. The filling was SUPER dense, so I added more mayo (Kraft Olive Oil)...probably 2T more (I didn't measure). I probably added about 1/8 tsp salt, but next time, I'll use 1/8 tsp season salt. I forgot to add the pepper. Next time, I'll only use 1 sm.red potato. I had alot of filling left over, which isn't a problem because it is delicious.

The recipe was a wonderful hit at my sister in law's birthday party. I made just a few changes. I added a little bit of honey and it made all the difference
