I thought it strange that you use honey mustard to make honey mustard dressing, but I decided to give it a try anyway, thinking it just might end up being something extraordinary.  I definitely like the lemon that peeks through in this dressing, but I don't know that I'd make this again, since regular honey mustard works fine for me.  This is good, but I really wouldn't say that there's anything that totally differentiates it from another honey mustard dressing that I use from this site.

I doubled the dijon mustard since I didn't have honey mustard and may have added a bit more lemon since I squeezed a small lemon for the juice. The lemon did come through in the flavor which I like. My wife said it was good but she preferred her store bought dressing.
