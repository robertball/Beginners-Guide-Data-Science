Wonderful drink that my friends loved! Used mango juice to make the drink sweeter. It was wonderful and refreshing and easy to make. I also used nondairy coconut milk and it still tastes wonderful!

Nice drink! Hubby and I both thought it could use a bit more sweetness just to bring out all the flavors more, but overall, we liked it! Thanks for sharing. :)
