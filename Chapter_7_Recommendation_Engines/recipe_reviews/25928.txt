Very tasty indeed!!! I used chili paste from the Asian store, which has alot of flavor and "kick". It was just spicy enough. I replaced one of the green peppers for a red pepper, for color. Next time, and there will be a next time, I would double the sauce recipe, and add the green onion at the last minute in order to retain crispness! Thats the beauty of a recipe, you can "tweak" it to suit your own taste! Thanks for this tasty and easy recipe!

I did not have chili paste, but a thai chili sauce.  I thought the dish was good, but needed more flavor.  Also, it took a long time to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe

I love Szechwan, and this recipe hit the spot. It was a great candle light dinner for the husband & I. Couldn't find the chile paste, or fresh chile peppers at my local grocery. So I used chili powder. I left out the sherry. The oranges were horrible at the store, so I end up using McCormick orange peel (1/2 tablespoon) I followed everything else to a que, and it turned out great. Not watery, mildely spicy, but does take extra time, but worth it in my opinion. I served my dish with steamed rice, and a Mandarin Orange Oriental salad I made. Will be making again..

This was good, but not near as spicy as I expected.  I will add some red chilies next time, as I do with my Kung Pao chicken.  Also, I added more garlic, can't have too much.  I would add more chopped peppers and maybe some celery next time too.

Definitley NOT spicy! Not at all! I used a red and orange pepper because I like their taste moreso than green peppers, and I left out the sherry,  but those was the only changes I made. It was more onion flavored than anything. It was basic fare, and I was kind of disappointed.

This was great - like most chinese dishes the preparation is a bit long - but the result was worth it.  The only thing I changed was to use 2 tablespoons of chinese garlic chili sauce.  Thank you submitter.

This recipe was good, but not great.  It definitely was not spicy (we used chili powder instead of chili paste, which may have been why it was milder than expected).  The orange taste was pretty evident.  I probably won't make this recipe again, but if I do, I will definitely look for some sort of hot Asian chili paste.

I loved this recipe! I sauteed the Chicken breasts whole in olive oil and then shredded. The only thing I would change is the chile sauce I bought was not hot at all. Really good flavor.

Was very bland. Even after adding a little salt, still tasted very bland.

Not terrible, but not worth the work.  My dish came out a little watery.  I probably should have added more of the cornstarch mixture, but it was already taking forever and I had somewhere to be.  The Mandarin chicken is much better and 1/2 the work!

This was pretty good.  Not as spicy as I thought that it would be.  I didn't have peanuts so I used sunflower seeds.  Thanks!!

Didn't change a thing.  This tastes like something you would get at a restaurant.  Just the right amount of spice.  We enjoyed it with a glass of Moscato wine, by Barefoot.  Perfect!

I did mine a little different and I like the way it came out.  I don't like nuts so I omitted those and I added some all natural hot sauce to give it an extra kick.  Yummy and easy.  Thanks for the idea!

12 11 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25928/go-girl-hot-szechwan-chicken/ ... For me, three stars plus; because boy child, 20, had three servings & said it was "Fantastic" without prompting! Shock. Shock. I used Asian garlic chili sauce since didn't have paste & 1t ground ginger for fresh slice. I did add the sherry. Nice touch with Asian food.. Recipe with subs above, it was three stars. After adding more garlic chile sauce, soy sauce, salt, crushed red pepper & sesame oil, it was a "good" four. Ohhhh, I subbed with 8blsl thighs & could've used a bit more cornstarch.. I mixed cooked rice in with it when it was done. Parsley.

This didn't turn out how I thought it would. The ginger & vinegar was all I could taste. The flavours just didn't combine together well. I added some honey which helped the balance but it still wasn't perfect. Don't think I will try again.
