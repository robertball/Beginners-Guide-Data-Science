High Five! I added just a touch of white wine and used beef broth b/c that's what I had on hand. It was SOOO good!

I served this over salmon patties and it was quite tasty. I used bacon drippings which paired nice with the mustard. This one is a keeper!

Made this to go along with Chef John's Stuffed and Rolled Pork Tenderloin. A taste of the sauce alone, I didn't think we would like it all. We did enjoy the sauce along with the pork the first day. The next day with leftovers, we didn't like it at all. It must be our taste preference as we didn't care for the slight dijon taste in this.

Very good. I used the sauce for Chef John Stuffed Pork Tenderloin. By mistake I used to much fond so my sauce was thinner than I prefer. Still great flavors and an excellent technique for me to build upon. Thank you Chef John!

I used whole grain Dijon mustard and white wine with chicken broth. My only addition is fresh cracked pepper. This was absolutely wonderful over pork chops!! A great sauce that you can make your own easily!!

This is a great cooking technique to know. Just remember that if you're using a store bought stock it will intensify in saltiness as you reduce it. Low sodium or salt-free stock works best for my taste as well as using unsalted butter.
