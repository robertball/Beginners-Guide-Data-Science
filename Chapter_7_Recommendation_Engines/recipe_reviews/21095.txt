Made this recipe for a family gathering - they were a hit!!  In fact, they ignored the other appetizers. I added a little crushed pineapple which made them a moister, also tried using phyllo "wraps" which worked niecely.

I made these for a Hawaiian Potluck that our church had. Although I got a few compliments on them, I didn't care for them. I thought they were too dry.

I used this recipe as a kind of base, and made a few changes based on the comments people left in their reviews. Instead of canned chicken I used a couple of boneless, skinless chicken breast that I fried up first and then chopped finely. I also added finely chopped ginger, garlic, red pepper, pineapple, and coriander, which gave it more of a Thai feel. I also added some pineapple juice and soy sauce, and just a dash of thai sweet chili sauce. I couldn't find biscuit dough so I used Pillsbury crescent rolls (cut in half) and formed them into little bundles by pinching together the dough at the top. I made them last night for a party and they were a huge hit!

I made this for my company potluck last week and it was such an embarrassment.  People didn't like it and I don't like it either.  It is way too dry.  I think it is the problem with the dough.  It is salty and dry. I made about 50 and 25 left over.  Some people took a bite and threw it away.  It was awful.  I am sorry that I have to say this but it is really not good.

Did not care for this. REAL manapua is better. Yes it's more time consuming, but it is sooooooo good.

I took this to a Luau.  This party included some wonderful cooks and their husbands.  The host of the party kept telling his quests that they needed to taste the best appetizer at the party --mine!  It was a hit and I will surely make this again.

Made these for a holiday party and they were a huge hit.  Since then I have had a few requests to bring them to pot lucks.  Taks a little time but worth it.
