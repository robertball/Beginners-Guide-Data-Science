I was a little leary of the brown gravy but it wasn't bad. I do agree it is a little bland . I added chopped onion and green pepper. I also doubled the Mozzerella. I added a cup of mozzerlla in with the pasta and put the rest on top. I will make it again and play around with the seasonings a bit.

Do I EVER love this recipe! We loved it so much, I made it again 5 days later. And, it's SOOO easy to make. The only changes I made to this recipe is that I substituted a jar of Alfredo Sauce for the half-and-half.  What a wonderful flavor it gave it.  Also, since I bought a 2 cup bag of shredded mozzarella cheese, I used it all because my son loves the cheese!  This is a keeper I'll make over and over again!  Thank you!!!

I thought that this recipe was fantastic! I changed the ground beef to Italian Sausage and I think that it made a big differance. My husband loved it so much he couldn't stop long enough from eating to tell me if he liked it or not.

Great basic recipe! I made the following changes - 1. used milk instead of cream 2. instead of the oregano and basil I used italian seasoning mix and pepper 3. I didn't have a 12oz can of gravy, only 10oz 4. I used 2 cans of pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce (more flavour) 5. I forgot the parmesan cheese lol 6. I used 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and mixed half in and the put the rest on top. Yummy!

I am not a fan of red sauce and pasta ie: lasagna, baked ziti, or spaghetti.....but this recipe was absolutely delcious!!! Wow!!! My family requested I make some sort of pasta dish and I searched and found this one. The fact that it had brown gravy in the ingredients made me really curious (plus all the rave reviews!). I can't tell you enough how tasty and wonderful this baked pasta was. As usual, I changed up a few things though. I added two cut up sweet italian sausages with the ground beef (seasoned meat with adobo, garlic powder, and pepper); used a 10.5 oz of brown gravy with onions; used 2 kinds of cheeses - swiss and mozzerella (and I layered pasta, cheese, pasta, cheese). The outcome was SPECTACULAR!!!!! Will make this again. It was a BIG HIT!!!!!

We just loved this stuff.  The brown gravy gave the sauce that "I slaved in the kitchen all day" flavor.  Although the recipe makes quite a bit, it was gone for lunch the next day.

This was great.  I did double the sauce, and put half of the sauce with pasta in baking dish added some mozzarella, then put rest of sauce and pasta on top and added cheese to top.  Personal perference we love cheese.  I've also used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce when in a pinch for time.  Great post, my kids, grandkids and co-workers loved it.  Also great using other cheeses.

This is easy and yummy!  The left overs are even better because the spices in the sauce have time to blend.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  I did not let it cook as long as the recipe indicates so maybe that is why it did not end up dry on top as others have noted.  Not sure how long I cooked it...I just took it out once the cheese was melted & bubbly on top!

It was good but not great. I would make it again but definitely add more cheese. It a good starter recipe to adjust to your own tastes.

I made this on Valentine's Day for The Woman I Love and we both loved it, finishing it over a total of three meals. Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't think it was bland at all. I'll be making this again.

This is great!  I used mostaccioli pasta.  The only change I made was to use marinara sauce since I didn't have tomato sauce.  I make this type of dish quite often but have never added brown gravy or half-and-half.  The combination of ingredients sounds strange but they meld together so well.  I think I'll be making it this way from now on!

Very nice my boyfriend loved it, made few changes, instead of a tomato sauce used a white sauce then dont need to add the cream makes it lighter. add an egg when you combine the sauce n pasta, this helps it set, and i added more cheese. very nice will be doing it again

Great recipe! A few changes that made it delicious - used fresh basil and fresh oregano. I also used whole wheat pasta, fat free gravy and reduced fat mozzarella to make it a tad more healthy. I also added an onion and some seasoning to the meat. Will definitely make this again!

I intended to make this with turkey sausage but ended up with just ground turkey.  The changes I made were 3/4 box of pasta instead of a whole box and I just used a jar of pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  I also added red bell pepper and added a hit of vodka in it as it reminded me of a vodka sauce.  The results were good, but I did think it would be better with the sausage flavor.  My husband liked it, as he gets tired of the traditional tomato sauce, also  my teenage daughter actually ate it for breakfast the next day.

i Absolutely LOVE this recipe it can be one of the best baked pasta .. although i did tweak it a little.   i added extra garlic and instead of just tomato sauce  i used Marinara sauce (adds MUCH MUCH MUCH flavor) and to season the meat i added, Adobo a Spanish seasoning can be found in Spanish markets.

Well, I guess I overdid it on the spices.....cut up an onion and sauteed in olive oil, added hot italian sausage, heaping helping of garlic and italian seasonings, added the brown gravy which MADE this sauce....this came out SUPURB!!!!!!!!!!!!! Served with homemade garlic knots.

I dont care for red sauce. I used cream of chicken instead. I still used the gravy too. I love this recipe. I dont simmer it for the full 20-30 mins. I only do 10-15 than put it in the oven.So if you are sick of the red use cream of chicken or even use one cream of chicken and a cream of mushroom or celery.

This one was easy and good. I was leery of the gravy, but it really worked! My daughter was the only one who really didn't care for it, but when my picky nephew decided to like it, I knew I had a keeper!!!

Easy easy easy! I really enjoyed this meal, my family LOVED it, and my boyfriend said it's his new favorite. All the different ingredients ended up working together to make a fantastic sauce. I did add a half of an onion (diced) and sprinkled garlic powder & italian seasoning on the ground beef. I drained the meat, as well. I added just a few squirts of ketchup (although I would reccomend tomato paste) and a dollop of Bertolli alfredo sauce. I ignored the amount of cheese to use and just threw as much in as I felt necessary. I layered everything, using about 1/3 of the sauce on the bottom of the pan so that there was not much on the top, and cheese melted & stuck to the pasta.

I really like this recipe. The gravy really adds that "cooked all day" flavor. I always add more garlic and lots of red pepper flakes. I also like to grind the meat up in my food processor after I cook it. It gives it a fine texture which cooks into the sauce nicely. The sauce of this recipe tastes great with spaghetti as well.

Kids did not like it. Bland and was too dry and they didn't like the different texture.  Probably wont use this recipe again.

Ok...this recipe I have been making for years........it is a wonderful casserole, easy, filling and very tasty. You wouldnt think that the combo of the tomato sauce and brown gravy go together....but it does. I have also made this with ground turkey or ground chicken instead of beef and also have used my own homemade marinara sauce instead of just canned tomato sauce.  Thanks!

Ok so the only thing I changed was that I used sausage instead of ground beed.  The dish was ok.  Next time if any I would make this with spaghetti or marinara sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce.  Using the gravy was a bit weird but I think it will be better with spaghetti sauce.  My family and friends liked it but as for me it was just ok.

I just made this for my grandchilden. It was a hit. But I do have a few suggestions. As someone else had recommended, I used Hunts Traditional Spagetti Sauce instead of the tomato sauce suggested. I advise using more then 30 ozs of sauce just to keep it moist while baking. I wish I would have used more. But the overall reaction was good. I agree. I also added a little more basil as I like it in a good sauce. I also used more mozzarella cheese than mentioned in the recipe. I will make it again, with the little adjustments I mentioned. If it passes my grandkids, well that says a lot !!

This was a delicious recipe.  I tried this with dried organic wheat pasta.  I will try again.

This dish was nothing special though I have to say that my very picky husband and 6 year old daughter thought it was fantastic. It was very easy to make but was kind of bland. If I make it again I will play around with the seasonings to make it more flavorful.

A solid three.  It was pretty fast to make, used up my leftover salisbury steak gravy, spaghetti sauce, & parmesan & italian cheeses - so "yay" for that. I added the half & half, & parmesan after simmering.  No one would be happy after simmering cheese.  ;)

Very good recipe.  I think sausage would be very good too.  Next time I plan to add a little less brown gravy and a little more tomato sauce.  The half and half gave it such a good, creamy consistency.  I also added onions and bell pepper.

Sorry, really odd flavor and recipe.  Been making ziti for years and looked for something new and different. This wasn't it.  The gravy is not italian and has a strange flavor mix with spices.  Better to go with a Maranara sauce than the tomato with seasonings.  So, I went on to explore other options and found  that first, use a pasta with ridges like a penne.  Then, be sure to sue more cheese!  Mix is nice but at least use more than a cup shredded mozzarella.  Ricotta mixed in with a bit of heavy cream and tablespoon of flour, heated, tastes really amazing by the way (and makes a type of "pink sauce"!).  If you are going to make this as is, then try adding a tablespoon brown sugar to the sauce.  Just too bland and tasteless.

Instead of using ground beef we used 1/2 pound of HOT sausage and 1/2 a pound of mild.  I think that made up for any blandness.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, used spicy hunts spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, and i layered cheeses in between. Tasted great! My boyfriend loved it, said it tasted a lot like lasagna. And much less work! Thanks for the great recipe!

Good baked pasta! I made a batch to go with Italian beefs (by Dick Pierce). Reminded me of a catered Portillo's night (if you are from Chicago, you know what I'm talking about!). My guests really enjoyed this - and had second helpings! My bf didn't care for this at all (it's a texture thing...). I liked this, but prefer my mostaccioli recipe instead. I was going to make half the recipe, but at the last minute, I decided to make it all. I have TONS of leftovers!!! I was a bit skeptical about adding brown gravy, but you don't taste it (it blends nicely with the tomato sauce, cream, cheese and spices). My only change was to sub mild Italian sausage for the beef (personal preference) and add WAY more cheese (I spooned some pasta/sauce, then cheese, repeated these layers several times and topped all with more mozzarella/Parm). Baked for 30 minutes (covered with foil), but could have baked for 25 as the top was a bit crunchy.... Thanks for sharing this unique recipe!

My husband liked this dish, in fact had 2 servings for dinner!  I thought it needed a little more "zip".  Next time I try this receipe, I'll add a bit more seasonings.

My boyfriend liked it but my kids thought it was a little dried out on top, I didn't care for it too much.  I added extra seasonings but the thing I think I didn't like was the brown gravy mixture.  Sorry Lisa, this one will not go in my recipe box.

Spaghetti out, Baked Pasta in.  Easy to adapt to what you have in the pantry.  Once I didn't have any half&half, so I used Hidden Valley Ranch w/bacon dressing, and it turned out great.  Leftovers go into zip style bags; if stored flat, it thaws without damaging the noodles.  Great for side dish too.

This recipe was good, although nothing really special. It's quite like your average "baked ziti casserole" ~ only with more ingredients, which aren't really necessary to make this dish work.  The  ingredient that made this dish creamier, I think, was the addition of the brown gravy. I will probably add that to my normal baked ziti recipe.  Also, since this made quite a lot..enough to have leftovers for awhile, or freeze, you will want to have extra sauce on hand, as it dries out rather quickly.

I made this last night, and I was really dissapointed.  It was simple to make, and the ingredients sounded good.  But it just has a stange taste to it.  Maybe it's the gravy.  I will not make this again.

I really enjoyed this and so did Mom and Boyfriend.  Will make again, and just adjust some of the spices.
This is the only baked pasta that I have ever made that reheated and retained liquids!
Very tasty!!!

Funny combination of sauce ingredients (brown gravy??)--but I thought this had a nice flavor.  I only had spaghetti in the house and it worked nicely with this recipe.  My picky kids liked it too!

I made this even with a miss giving over the gravy.  My kids devoured it and asked for seconds, even my 5 year old.  This doesnt happen often.  This will be something I cook more often.

I liked the addition of brown gravy to a pasta bake, feeling that it added to the richness as well as helping the tomato sauce from overpowering the rest of the sauce. I added one and a half chopped onions and doubled the garlic, as well as the basil and oregano, and it was STILL bland. Needs more oomph! I may make it again, but it'll be more my recipe than Marian's after I finish doctoring it my way!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 lb more of meat and used a turkey and mild sausage combo (on hand).  I added a little extra cheese.  My family absolutely loved it.  My son's girlfriend has a full-blood, Italian cooking granny and she said this was delicious.  I made them all guess the "secret" ingredient and no one could.  Gravy.  Who knew!!!   Thank you SO MUCH!  This one is going in the rotation.  Can't wait to take it to a potluck and "wow" some co-workers.

My husband had thirds of this, and he’s not a huge fan of casserole type meals! So I will be making this again, and have added it to my meal rotation. I think it would be even better with some diced onions and peppers.

Wow, I had never heard of adding brown gravy to baked pasta! It kinda freaked me out but I did it. Followed the recipe exactly and it was easy and really good. The next time I used a can of stewed Italian seasoned tomatoes, pureed, in place of the tomato sauce. Really good again! Husband said he likes it and "you can make that anytime" which, unsolicited, winds up in the rotation. Thank you for the recipe.

Made it the original way first...4 stars.  I then made it again, but this time, used ricotta cheese with fresh grated parmesan and egg yolks and chopped parsley as a layer.  I also doubled the sauce mixture and used alfredo sauce  instead of half and half (per another reviewer) and used a combo of 1 lb. of ground italian sausage and 1/2 lb. of ground beef cooked with chopped onion and garlic.  Doubled the cheese, also fresh grated, as a personal preference.  Just as good, but, not better.  I'd  make this again either way, but, maybe halve the recipe.

Very good and so easy to make.  The kids loved it.  I followed the recipe with only minor changes.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Added chopped onion, and I used shredded mild cheddar cheese.  This was not bland to me as others said.  Delicious!  Thanks.

Turned out very good.  I was a little apprehensive about the gravy but the overall affect was good.  The whole family ate it and I will make it again.   As a personal preference I will add more cheese:)
Thanks for the recipie!

Good recipe.  Used 1 1/4 pounds of meat and pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Added more sauce to compensate for the added meat.  Also used milk instead of cream.  Tasty, would make again.

I was looking for a baked pasta recipe because I need to make it for 80 people at our church.  I made half of a batch to try it and my husband and I loved it!  I substituted marinara sauce for the diced tomatoes and also added chopped red pepper and a little cayenne pepper.  I know everyone at our church will love this when i serve it to them this Sunday.

Yum! I normally don't like baked pasta, it always seems like more work but this was delicious! I was skeptical of the brown gravy, seemed a little weird but the whole dish is delicious I will make it the exact same way next time. I only have a gravy packets so I added that and a cup of water and we didn't have tomato sauce on had so I blended a large can of tomatoes. Enjoyed by everyone in my family of boys!

Used Old Fashion Brown Gravy recipe as a guideline to make brown gravy. Tasted really good. Not cheesy like most but it did have a hearty taste.

Good base recipe but found that it needed way more spices and flavor than the recipe called for.    
The second time making, I sauteed chopped shallots and garlic in a bit of olive oil first and then added the ground beef.  Also added a pound of mild italian sausage too.  While it simmered, I went through my spice rack and added lots of dried oregano, basil, parsley and some salt and pepper to taste.  I also added a few red pepper flakes to give it some pop.   Thanks for a good recipe.

I was apprehensive about the gravy, but my family loved it.  Slight modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have ground beef on hand so I decided to use precooked meatballs.  While the meatballs cooked in oven, I cooked about 1/4 c. of chopped onion and the garlic in olive oil in pan until tender.  Then I added all sauce ingredients except I used shredded Parmesan cheese and a Tbsp of Italian seasoning.  I cut meatballs in half and mixed into the pasta and sauce mix.   I added a layer of shredded mozzarella between half the pasta mix and then a layer on the top.  I am looking forward to trying it with ground sausage next time. Excellent recipe!

This recipe is so good. I've made it twice now and it's still a favorite. The second time I made it, I used almond milk instead of half and half. I also was in a hurry and only simmered it for 20 minutes. I would add to the recipe's directions...to drain the beef after you brown it, my sauce was greasy but everything was still delicious.

This was very good but I would make some changes next time to add a little more flavor. I like the idea of adding sautéed onion and perhaps using Italian sausage in lieu of the hamburger.  I alos doubled the mozzarella topping. Very easy to make.

This was delicious!!! I was definitely leery about the brown gravy but it turned out amazing. I added garlic, a can of stewed tomatoes and on top I put mozzarella and havarti. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used Alfredo sauce instead of cream because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again!!

So delicious! What a good base recipe. I say that because I didn't have brown gravy, mozz cheese, or half-and-half, so I just used the recipe as a general guide, and it still turned out great.

I was skeptical of the 1/2 and 1/2 cream as I usually do not put it in my pasta sauces but it made the finished recipe so good.  I also added 1 can cut up tomatoes and the juice, Italian seasonings and 3 tbsp of Franks Hot Sauce.  Did not cook my pasta beforehand and left it in the oven for 55 minutes.  Used rigatoni for the pasta.  Will be making this again ... came out very smooth and the pasta was a la dente ... very flavourful with the added changes.  Would have given it a 4 star without the additions.

I followed this recipe to the tee and was able to fit the beef mix and noodles into a 9x5 loaf pan and I prefer a meaty pasta dish. The amount was just right for my husband and I. Don't see how this could stretch to a 9x13 pan. Anyway the flavor and consistency was great. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is amazing. I did add my own touch to it though...I didn't put the gravy in simply because I don't like gravy itself. I used 1/2 tomato Alfredo sauce and 1/2 reg. tomato sauce, and I used Chipotle ranch to give it a little kick. Turned out great and will definitely be using this recipe again!!

This is really tasty and easy. Will definitely make it again. 

My only change is that I will definitely use Italian sausage instead of the ground beef from now on. Our family likes a bit of spice. This first time, we just added some crushed red pepper to our own plates and it was great!

This was a great dish. I made it for my girlfriends and my kids. They both enjoyed it so much. I was quite skeptical about using the gravy, but it added a lot of flavor. I made a few changes...traditional pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, ground turkey and  Italian sausage. My kids, who hate leftovers, woke up the next morning and ate it for breakfast. They have requested that I make this again soon.

I made a couple of twists: I used mild (or if you prefer spicier) italian sausage instead of ground beef, spaghetti sauce (with basil or roasted garlic flavor) instead of tomato sauce, did not use gravy and half and half, instead I used ricotta cheese. It was a hit with my family and friends!

LOVE it!!  It's so easy to make, but tastes as if it took forever, and requires tons of effort.  I was also leary of the brown gravy, but it turned out so awesome!  I used the recommendation of a reviewer to use Alfredo sauce instead of half-and-half, and it was absolutely delicious!  I also doubled the mozzarella cheese that's sprinkled on top (but obviously it's done last and you can double it on the spot if you want to start with one cup.)  Also, I used rotini pasta, I felt it went well with this recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again!!
