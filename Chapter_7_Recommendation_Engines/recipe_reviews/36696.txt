I just love this dish.  I made it for a 4th of July picnic as an alternative to traditional pasta salad.  The portions of the indredients don't seem to matter much as long as there is enough pasta to balance out the beans.  It does not keep very well in the fridge.

I read several of the reviews and did a little tweaking of my own. I added the beans to the boiling noodles during the last 4 minutes of cooking to soften the chickpeas a bit. I used lemon pepper and added roasted red pepper for color and flavor. OUTSTANDING!!

If you take the recommendations from other reviewers, this recipe is very nice. I sauteed garlic and mushrooms (cremini and shiitake) in oil, then added the beans and the spinach. The rest was pretty much the same as the original, except I added some balsamic vinegar as someone suggested. Very nice!

This is a very likeable meal, although I changed it so much it barely resembles the original. Try this for an even better, more greek, pasta dish: saute the garlic and spinach, and throw in some mushrooms. add about a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, a tbsp of lemon juice, and let cook a bit. Take off heat. Add kalamata olives (which I used instead of the garbanzos, but both would be nice), fresh tomato chunks, cucumber, and crumbled feta. THIS was outstanding!! Many thanks to the creator of the original recipe for the inspiration.

Wow, was this good!  Because the ingredients were so simple, I wasn't expecting anything that spectacular, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I used 3 Tbl. of olive oil and 1/2 cup feta to lower the fat.  I tweaked some of the measurements to suit my taste more:  used 1/2 of a 1-lb. bag of cavatappi, one bag of fresh spinach, 1 Tbl. lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper, 1 can beans, and 2 cloves garlic.  Delicious!  Be sure and follow the advice of others:  add the chickpeas to the boiling water for a couple of minutes to soften them, and add the pasta to the spinach when hot so that the spinach wilts a little.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was so simple and delicious!  I forgot to buy lemon, so I used some white wine vinegar and it was fine. Even the kids liked it.  I wouldn't have minded an addition of grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes sliced in half.  Would have made it pretty and would taste great.

This is an incredibly easy and tasty dish--the only thing I changed was to add some fresh basil--next time I plan on trying it with tomato/basil feta cheese--I'll be making this a lot this summer!

I really enjoyed this dish, it's so light and refreshing, not to mention quick.  What a versatile dish!  I added grape tomatoes, pine nuts, and like many others, used flavored (garlic and herb) feta cheese.

Really excellent!  I made this to the recipe for part of an Easter 'picnic' feast for my family, and it was very well received indeed.  I didn't add or change any ingredients, amounts or methods, and it was deeee-licious!  Even the meat lovers were coming back for seconds.  Additionally, it wasn't too garlicky even for the most finicky guests - which was something I was worried about.  Try this one, it's yummy.

I rarely get such an exuberant response from my husband about meals I make...he couldn't stop raving about how good this was!  And, it was so quick and easy to make, too...a perfect recipe!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added the chickpeas to the boiling pasta for 5 minutes.  I also garnished with red pepper flakes, which I'd highly recommend; it really made the dish.  Also, I followed the recipe for lemon juice amount, but both my husband and I used our lemon garnishes to add more lemon juice.  In the future, I'd probably double the lemon amount.  One other note:  8 cups cooked cavatappi is a one pound box.  I used one 9 oz. bag of spinach...not sure if that was 8 cups or not but it seemed right.  Thanks for the recipe!

I fix this salad frequently, especially in the summer and we love it. We like a little more lemon so I always serve it with lemon wedges.

I really enjoyed this recipe and my husband complimented it as well! I followed the directions except using a different shaped pasta and substituted arugula for spinach. We will make this again!

This was really good.  It felt kind of healthy since it wasn't loaded down with a heavy sauce or lots of cheese.  I cut the recipe down quite a bit for just my husband and I, and there was still tons left over.  I used the juice of one whole lemon, 3 cloves of garlic, and added some chopped tomato and marinated artichoke hearts to give the dish some added "oomph".  My husband drizzled some good balsamic vinegar on it too and loved it.

Really good recipe. Nice, simple flavors; an excellent light dinner. For a more filling entree, I would add a grilled chicken breast. Also, next time I might substitute great northern or cannellini beans for the garbanzo just for the smoother texture. Also, I agree with others that you should add the garbanzo beans to the boiling pasta because I think their texture should be softer. Overall, a very delicious and healthy pasta dish. To make it even healthier, I omitted the olive oil and used a little broth (maybe if I used the oil I would have given it 5 stars!). I added some hot sauce just to give it some heat, but I liked the recipe as is, too.

Garlic lovers will love this salad.  I cool the pasta with cold water before mixing with the spinach to avoid wilting the spinach. One can of beans is sufficient, but two are great too if you like beans.  I double the  dressing since the pasta and feta absorb a lot of it.

I really liked this.  I made it as written, adding pasta to spinach immediately to wilt the spinach, but used orzo pasta.  Great !

Lovely recipe!  Simple & tasty.  I added toasted sliced almonds for a little crunch.  This recipe is very flexible for additions particular to people's taste.  It keeps well and, although I expected it to be a good cold salad,  I found reheating for a few seconds in the microwave brings out the flavors. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This was really good and easy to make,  I didn't have any beans, so I substituted shrimp.  I sauted the shrimp and spinach in the olive oil and garlic first.  As others suggested, I added sun dried tomatoes and olives.  I will make this again with the garbanzo beans.

I made this tonight for dinner. Yum. Very tasty. I added the beans to the water for the last few minutes to soften them up, used flavored feta and low sodium garbanzo beans. When I have then leftovers tomorrow, I think I will add some sauted red onion. This recipe will stay in my recipe box and be made again. I can't wait until my basil grows so I can add fresh basil to it.

Very good, I think that the chickpeas should be cooked a little first to make them softer, but I loved the whole taste of the pasta, will make again.

Very yummy!  I've tried it both as written and with sauteing the spinach and garlic, and I like it as written better.  Flavored feta is a good addition.

This was a great recipe for those who don't want just the same old thing.  My only complaint is that I felt that the chickpeas were too plentiful, although I liked their flavor.  Next time I may add some broccoli in place of the chickpeas.  I also used frozen spinach with no problems.  This recipe is definitely a keeper in my house!

AWESOME! This recipe is very forgiving. I didn't have spinach so I added some of  Trader Joe's Southern Greens Blend instead. Didn't measure, just eyed it. Also added beans with pasta for the last 5 min to soften them up a bit, mas suggested. Added Scarlet Runner beans because I had them from the garden. Added greens after drained pasta so it wilted. Yummy, Yum, Yum. Oh, i did the dressing in the food proc. Used rigatoni, had no cavatappi.  Kids loved it too! Lemon is such a nice touch.

I made this scaled to 8 servings. It is wonderful, fresh and delicious! Even though scaled to 8 servings, it is a heft amount, something to think about when you decide to make this recipe and there is only 4 to serve!  I didn't add or delete anything, but I was thinking it might be nice to add a little parmesan to the finished product?  My husband didn't think so, he thought it was perfect just the way it was made.  The lemon adds just the right amount of zing, don't forget that!  I almost did, and when added, defintely brightened up the flavors!

This recipe has become an absolute staple in my expanding "repertoire".  It's simple, kinda sorta healthy and tastes great.  The only problem is, I alwasy make too much!

This was sooooo good!  I brought the leftovers to work for lunch for a few days and I really looked forward to eating it!  I will definitely make this again.  I used low-fat feta and it was still great!

It's a huge HIT! I made this recipe for  two different parties and never brought home leftovers.  So far I have passed the recipe on to about 7-8 people who have called asking for it.  I'd suggest using fresh lemon; the stuff in the lemon-shaped container just can't quite cut it.

Very good. I cut the pasta amount in half, and used about 3/4 of one 15.5 oz can of garbanzos (rinsed). I used about 1/2 of a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach, and could've (should've) used the whole bag. I also took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and emulsified the dressing in my mini Cuisinart. Placed the lemon juice, salt, pepper and crushed garlic (used 3 cloves) in the Cuisinart, and drizzle the olive oil in to make a vinaigrette. Stayed creamy, mixed well. Also added 1/8 - 1/4 t. of hot pepper flakes. Careful - too much will kill this dish. Also boiled the beans for the last 5 min. w/the pasta. Nice touch. Drained the pasta/beans, mixed with the spinach and garlic/herb feta, and drizzled with the vinaigrette. A little dry, but great flavor. You could moisten this dish with a few tablespoons of the pasta water or make a little more dressing. I'll probably do that next time. Great flavors! Try it!

Fabulous and easy recipe!  My husband had seconds.  I doubled the dressing, though, because the recipe as shown was a bit on the dry side.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and boiled the chickpeas with the pasta for the last 5 minutes of cook time.  I also added some oregano and a pinch of red pepper flakes for extra kick.

This will definitely become a regular menu item at my house.  Yum!

This was delicious. I also boiled the chick peas for +/- 5 mins to soften them. It came together easily and was really good. I think that this recipe has a lot of potential...you could add or change ingredients to your own liking easily and with great results.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used the new Barilla Plus multi-grain enriched penne pasta as my store didn't have cavatappi.  It worked very well.  

The only change I made to this recipe was to add the salt, pepper, and garlic to the lemon juice and then whisk the ingredients constantly while drizzling in the oil to make a nice, emulsified vinaigrette.  Then I rinsed the garbanzo beans, tossed them in the vinaigrette with the chopped spinach and feta and let that sit to "marinate" while the pasta cooked.  Not a huge change, but I think it helped the ingredients come together a little better than just tossing it all in a bowl and stirring would have.

My husband and I both feel this would also do very well as a cold side salad.  I also think it would tolerate the addition of fresh herbs of you have them on hand, such as dill or basil.  This is definitely a recipe we will make again and again!

This was very yummy, although I made some pretty liberal modifications.  First, I used whole wheat bowtie pasta.  I had a red bell pepper on hand, so I coarsely diced it and sauteed it in a little olive oil with a couple of minced garlic cloves and dried rosemary and basil for about 5 minutes.  Then I added a can of diced tomatoes and sprinkled some red pepper flakes in it.  Just before I drained the pasta, I added the chickpeas and let them simmer for a few minutes.  After I poured the tomato/chickpea mixture, I had some extra baby spinach and added that after tearing it into smaller pieces.

I will definitely make it again with my changes, but I also think it would be delicious without them.  Even with the extra steps, it was quick and very flavorful.

I had been given a large can of chick peas and needed to find a way to make good use of them.  This recipe fit the bill.  I used bow-tie pasta and if I made this again (and I probably will), I would use more lemon juice and more pepper.  It was quite good.

Great quick vegetarian recipe... I love that you can just mix everything right into the pasta at the end without using another pan. However, I thought the 4 cloves of garlic were too strong, especially crushed, since we were still biting into big chunks of almost-raw garlic. Next time, would mince and possibly saute the garlic. Also, would consider using artichoke hearts in addition to or instead of the beans.

Really tasty and simple, I used a bag of baby spinach and added a tin of halved grape tomatoes. If you choose to add the tomatoes, it's okay to use one can of chickpeas but it needs it otherwise (at least if it is functioning as a vegetarian main dish).

This was good but I found only one can of chick peas to be enough, and I also added red pepper flakes to give it extra flavor.  Additionally, I used Athenos feta with lemon, garlic & oregano.

Yum.  Great way to use those dried garbanzo beans I bought forever ago and never used.  I used 2/3 cup dried garbanzo beans for 4 servings and that was too many, so I'd suggest 1 1/2 cups dried for the full recipe or 1/2 cup for every 4 servings.  Great flavors, very filling, and good for leftovers because the flavors get richer after a day in the fridge.  I sprinkled some shredded parmesan on top to serve.

Who would've thought that such simple ingredients could make such a tasty meal. I added two tomatoes and some basil to mine and it was simply wonderful. I also boiled the garbonzo beans as suggested and think that really works well. What more can you ask for in a recipe? It's simple, healthy, and delicious. The whole family agreed that this is a keeper. Will make again and again!

One of our favorites as a family, but we add a container of grape tomatoes.  It makes all the difference.

This recipe calls for more lemon and feta cheese than advised.  Also a little too oily.  Still quite quick and easy to make.

Only change I made was to boil the garbanza beans for a few minutes to soften them, used mini penne, and frozen spinach.  Nice combination of flavors.  Would try to find the cavatappi or smaller noodle next time as the texture combination was a little off.
UPDATE: Made with maccaroni and fresh spinach - made all the difference.  Also boiled the beans for about 5 minutes which softened them just enough.  Excellent!

I used shredded pecarino romano and parmesean instead of feta and it was delicious!  I also used almost double the garlic and lemon juice.

Added chopped up sundried tomatoes.  First bite tasted good, second bite was even better!  The second time I added fresh basil but didn't like it as much - maybe just me, my husband had seconds.  Perfect summer pasta recipe.

Absolutely loved it--the garlic made the dish.  My husband added Parmesan to his serving and thought that it would also be good with Parmesan instead of feta, but I loved it just the way it is. This one is going into our kitchen recipe box!

This was a HUGE hit in our house! The lemon juice and the feta give it a great tang that complements the rest of the ingredients well. We substituted steamed kale for spinach. Terrific! It's now a family favorite.

I only had a bag of frozen spinach, so I sauteed the spinach with the chickpeas and garlic. I used a 16 oz. box of penne, flavored feta, and a little extra lemon juice and garlic. This filled a huge bowl...could easily 1/2 the recipe or at least 1/2 the pasta and spinach and leave everything else the same. I served this with RamJam Chicken (from this site) and French bread.  Delicious and quick!!

Pretty good, but a little salty. I used whole wheat and vegetable pasta. Next time I plan to use about half again as much spinach, and only half the chick peas, which I found were very salty. Other than that, very yummy and refreshing!

Super-easy, cheap, and delicious.  I added quite a bit of extra pepper, red pepper flakes, and grated parmesan to boost the flavor, which was very delicate.

I tend to make everything SPICY ... this was a nice, flavourful departure that didn't leave me feeling disappointed.  I didn't strictly measure the flavours of salt, pepper and lemon but used them according to taste.  It tasted super!

Nice enough, but a little too garlicky for me. I substituted garbanzo beans with soybeans, and feta cheese with chedder, since that's all I had on hand, and maybe that's why I wasn't very thrilled with it. Nutritious and filling, otherwise.

I made this tonight and thought it was good.  I love garbonzo beans and like to try them in different recipies.  I only had blue cheese on hand and that was a bit too much tang.  If I had feta like the recipie called for, I know I would have eaten more than my share of the dish.  I'll make this again for sure.  (p.s. I sauted the beans, spinach and garlic like others tried, and it was perfect this way.)

I took the suggestion of one reviewer and sauteed the garlic, beans and spinach briefly.  It is great hot or cold.  I may try adding black olives next time.

I changed the recipe a little, and sauteed the garlic, garbanzos and spinach just until the spinach wilted, and it was wonderful. My husband loved it, our one year old son loved it, and it only took 20 minutes from start to finish!!

this was a good recipe...very easy to make!  however, the dressing was a bit scant for the amount of food...i would use more olive oil next time.  it can be eaten hot or cold, and i will definitely make it again!
