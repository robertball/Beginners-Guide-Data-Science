Pure comfort food!! To avoid a trip to the store, I used mezze penne instead of elbow, chicken stock in place of veg stock & frozen veggies in place of canned.  The seafood seasoning in this is spot on, don't be shy with it.  I was leary of the red wine vinegar, but decided to go ahead and add it in  and I am so glad I did.  This is a really good dish! I am already looking forward to the leftovers.   Thanks for sharing your recipe, Pixie!!

We're not fans of peas, so what I did was saute some fresh carrot with orange pepper, the onion and a little garlic and added it to the noodle mixture. I used Green Giant's yellow and white corn, Cracker Barrel's 2% white cheddar and added a little dijon and Frank's Hot Sauce. Very good "tuna" casserole. I liked that it helped me use some stray cans of food in my pantry plus I could throw in some fresh veg and get away with it. I think next time I might cut back on the noodles and double up on the veg. Maybe make a little more sauce as we like a saucier cheese sauce on our mac and cheese/tuna casseroles. I think this might be our new "tuna" casserole, Pixie! My husband, who claims to hate salmon, ate two bowls! EDITED: Even better the next day. Rewarms well.

I used fresh carrots, frozen peas and frozen corn instead of the canned varieties, and a larger can of salmon than called for.  I omitted the bread, but sprinkled the Parmesan cheese on top, then garnished with paprika. This turned out to be quite tasty!

Very good! What a simple and delicious way to get more Omega-3's into your diet! The salmon makes such a great addition to mac n cheese.  I made a smaller batch (about half - kind of eyeballed quantities) and only used frozen peas, as I had no other suitable veggies on hand.  I omitted the vinegar, used skim milk and added some parmesan to the macaroni mixture as well as using it in the topping.  Just delicious!  My daughter, who is not a fish-eater, loved it!  Will definitely repeat in our house!

I found this to be a little dry. Next time I would add a can of campbells cream of cheddar soup. The flavor was great the old bay was perfect. Being a salmon lover I could also add more and be very happy. My previously non fish loving boy ate it exclaiming over how good it was, actually all 3 of my kids did. I ran out of bread so I crushed ritz crackers with the parmesan cheese and it was great.

This ended up not really being my thing, but I made a double batch, and froze over half to put in my grandmothers freezer, and she loves it! My can of salmon was bigger than 6oz, but we liked the extra salmon. I left out the corn because I didn't have any, and used pre-made bread crumbs for the topping. It is such a rich and comforting dish. Perfect on a cold day. Thanks pixie!

I LOVED this with solid white tuna (3 cans)after a few minor changes. It looked like not enough liquid for our tastes (maybe my high fiber pasta soaked more liquid up?) So, I added a can of cheddar-cheese soup and extra 2% milk (about 2 cups). And, we like Parmesan, but thought it might be too much with 3 full Tablespoons, for my kiddie's/my family's liking... so, I only used half. Great idea to add Old Bay. It added a nice depth of flavor. Delicious recipe, Pixie, that I changed only for my family's preferences. Now, I can't wait to try when I have Salmon. Thank you, for posting!

Pure comfort food, but the veggies made me feel guilt free!  I made a couple changes based on what I had available, subbed the salmon for crab, and the vegetable stock for chicken.  Also left the vinegar out all together.  I have made it this was a few times now, still one of my faves!

I loved this!  It is different, but really good!  The first time I made it, I didn't have the seafood seasoning or enough cheese.  The second time I did, and it was much better.  Also the second time I made it, I doubled the salmon (when I used one can I could barely tell that there was any salmon in it) and I halved the macaroni because I am trying to cut down on carbs.  Half the macaroni was plenty.  Also the first time there were too many peas and not enough carrots, so I used a small can of peas and I chopped up about a 1/2 cup of carrots to use.  It was way better the second time when I added the missing ingredients and made a few minor changes.

Yummy!  I used double the amount of Salmon and I used half and half instead of milk.  I would say it could use a little more "sauce"... but that is just my personal preference.  I will definitely be keeping this and making it again.

Super delicious! I made it as written without any changes.  I find regular tuna casserole is under rated anyway, but this is a lovely upgrade from the usual.  Will add this to my autumn/winter meal plan. Thanks! :)

Good for a different take on the seafood-pasta casserole.  I did not use homemade bread crumbs.  I used dry Italian bread crumbs and next time I would toss them with a little melted butter to brown on the top.

I just made this it was sooooo easy. I only changed a few things only cause I was missing seafood seasoning so I used seasoning salt, and I had no parm cheese so I just used alittle chedder sprinkled over the top. I can't wait to taste it !!! Great use of canned salmon.

I will try this recipe again.  Maybe with frozen peas and corn and cut back on the Old Bay a bit.

This is very tasty.  I used frozen veggies for personal preference.  Since my husband cannot eat fish, I divided the recipe into two 9" square pans.  One I made with the salmon as the recipe called for.  The other I used leftover rotisserie chicken and some southwestern seasoning.  I reduced the cooking time since the recipe was divided.  Very, very good Pixie...thanks for sharing!!

Although delicious I too thought it was a bit dry, and with all that liquid I thought it might be too runny! Next time I'll try adding a can of mushroom soup, or some sour cream as per others suggestions, oh yeah and our family likes salmon so will double that up!

I liked it! I did make some changes though, I used some spiral noodles and egg noodles (just what I had to use up), I didn't have any bread left so I used cheese crackers (like goldfish/cheese-its), and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Oh, and I used some frozen mixed veggies instead of the canned peas/carrots because that's what I had, and used two cans of salmon. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was good!

Very great flavor but a little drier than I thought it would be. Next time I would double the milk and cheese part. I substituted the canned salmon with flaked leftover salmon from the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe, also in this site, which gave it added flavor. Also used dried seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs for the topping.

Thanks so much for this recipe. It was so good. My husband even had three bowls. I had to us chicken broth but I don't think it made a difference. I have e-mailed this recipe to my friends.  I am sure they will also enjoy it.

this was VERY tasty-but one major change I would make next time-less pasta!  I even added 1/2 c. extra milk, but the final product was still too dry.  I would agree with the suggestion to use only half of the pasta and I would add more cheese.  But great base recipe!

I am not a picky eater and I can usually eat almost anything with pasta. I barely got through a half serving of this. Thank goodness the ingredients were fairly cheap since I tossed almost the whole batch. I gave it an extra star in case it was cook error on my part, but everyone in the family kept saying it just tasted funny. Sorry.

I had unexpected company & they rated this recipe 5 stars. I rated it a 4 b/c  it was a bit dry for my taste. The seasoning is very good. Love the veggies. I would add less macaroni next time or increase the liquid. The vinegar likely cuts the fishy taste to the canned salmon, so I would not omit. A good way to add salmon to one's diet!  Thx Pixie.

My little boy is an EXTREMELY picky eater - and he loved this. I made it just like the recipe except I added garlic to the sauteing onions.
