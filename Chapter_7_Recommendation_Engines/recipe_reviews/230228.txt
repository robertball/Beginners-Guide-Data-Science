Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I used to make a recipe very similar to this one that was from a Southern Living Annual Recipes cookbook - don't remember which year. I no longer have the cookbook and was so happy to find this. I made it for Christmas Eve Dinner this year. My five and three year old sons LOVED having their own "mini-turkeys" for dinner! Recipe is delicious and surprisingly little-kid friendly.

Terrific recipe, thank you for posting it!

Only thing I did differently was to add the remaining glaze to the pan drippings (after separating the fat).  I used that for gravy by reducing it in a sauce pan and adding a little more corn starch.

Note the cooking time for the rice was longer for me by about 15 minutes.

I stuffed the hens with regular bread stuffing substituting the rice with a box of stove top and adding the onions, and almonds, and only one bouillion cube--being Thanksgiving and all.  We had a small gathering and everyone loved them!

I added chopped mushrooms to my rice. I also soaked the hens in a brine with fresh rosemary, bay leafs, thyme & tarragon and smoked sea salt.  I am in love with the basting sauce, I will use it in many other recipes. The tartness of the current with the all spice was a treat for the pallet.

It took me longer to make than what is shown but it was worth it. The rice is delicious. I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible, but I did not have any red wine. I used white wine with a dash of sweet vermouth. That resulted in a interesting and tasty glaze. They look fabulous on the plate. This is for a special occasion. Go for it.

This is the 3rd time that I have made this recipe, we love it. After the 1st time I even started making additional rice for later.
