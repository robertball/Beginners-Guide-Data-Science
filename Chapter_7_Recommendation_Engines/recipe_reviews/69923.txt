These waffles were so light and fluffy. I used real buttermilk, not powdered. I didn't use chocolate chips, but made them plain, then topped them with fresh cream and blueberries. Scrumptious!

My waffles turned out great, but I made many modifications: subbed whole wheat pastry flour, added 1/4 tsp salt, 2 T sugar, used 1 cup fresh buttermilk instead of milk & did not used dried butter milk, subbed evaporated milk for cream, subbed canola oil for butter. Added a couple T of milk to thin the batter. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 c, and it was still very chocolatey. I have another recipe that produces similar results with less effort, so don't know if I'll make again, but this is a delicious recipe. Thanks, BIGTIMEMENACE!

My husband said these are the best buttermilk waffles he's tasted in a long time!  I used fresh buttermilk plus some 2% for consistency, omitted the cream, and chocolate chips, and  got egg yolk in the egg whites so they didn't form stiff peaks, and the waffles were still fabulous!

Killer. Absolutely perfect. Light and fluffy, yes ma'am. This one's a keeper. NOTE: I also used real buttermilk instead of powdered.

Well, I didn't have half the ingredients but I was determined to make these!!!  I used 3/4 c. buttermilk and 1/2 c. whole milk, omitting the buttermilk powder and cream, and substituted canola oil for the butter.  I am notorious for not following directions, and this was no exception.  I mixed the wet ingredients together, added the dry ingredients, and everything came out fine.  I also added a dash of salt and a tablespoon of sugar, per previous reviews.  They were a hit with my son, who is kind of picky!!!

Sinful, but absolutely delicious.  Next time I'll make it without chocolate chips.  Just my personal preference.

I have to say that these are practically foolproof. My three year old helped me make them and I completely breezed past the part of the recipe that said to beat the egg whites separately (oops). Even still, they turned out fabulous! I can only imagine how much better they'll be when I actually follow the directions!...my kids are freaking thrilled with the chocolate chips alone, which elevates me to Hero Mom status.

Thanks for sharing the recipe, Kate! :)

Very good, skipped beating the egg white separately, and it was still nice and light.  If I have more time next time I will.  Didn't have mini chips, so I chopped up regular ones in the food processer.  Half a cup was perfect.  Next time I might add some chopped pecans too...

Delicious! It took a little bit longer to prepare than other waffle recipes I've tried, but the results were definitely worth it! Husband LOVED them! These will be the only waffles I make from now on. Thanks so much!

I wanted something really quick, so I skipped the various steps and just mixed all the ingredients together (didn't actually separate the eggs either). It turned out fine. I also added grated zucchini, and my zucchini-hating kid didn't even know it was in there :)

Kids loved these.  I actually didn't have any of these waffles, so I can only base it on my kids' rating.  The recipe came together smoothly, cooked up very well (no sticking to the waffle iron), and the waffles looked great.

these were excellent.  Made a few changes because i didn't have all the ingredients. I doubled the recipe, didn't have buttermilk, powder or wet, so used 1 c. plain yogurt and 1 cup milk with vinegar.  Also used 1 c whole wheat flour because i ran out of white.  Everyone LOVED these.

These are fantastic light and fluffy waffles! They didn't need any syrup; I enjoyed mine with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. My husband liked them but thought they were better for dessert.

I have made this recipe,  was a big hit at our house.
Everyone  loved them.   I did use half whole wheat flour and added a teaspoon of vanilla.
I also used this recipe for pancakes they were very good as well.

I had everything on hand except the cream, so I used 1/4 c of half & half instead and added it to the liquid mix. They turned out perfect! My daughter really enjoyed her birthday breakfast!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I had no buttermilk powder, so I used a little over 1 cup of actual buttermilk. These waffles are to die for!

I have had one waffle that was slightly fluffier (on a cruise). It could be a little tiny bit sweeter and maybe a bit lighter so I gave it a four star rating. I'm still searching for the perfect waffle, but I like this one quite a bit.

I made these as stated, but didn't have powdered buttermilk - only real buttermilk, which I added at the same time as the milk. I made some w/out chocolate chips - they were light & fluffy but lacked flavor and were a bit eggy tasting - nothing that butter and syrup didn't fix. The waffles with the chocolate chips weren't received well by my son. Not sure I'll make these again as it's a lot of trouble and we didn't love them.

Mmmm . . . yummy! Light, fluffy, delicious! I used regular buttermilk and didn't bother to whip the egg whites separately and I skipped the heavy cream, instead upping the buttermilk to 1 1/4 cup and they turned out scrumptious.

Oh! These are great! Plate not required.  Deliscious.  I used buttermilk instead of milk b/c thats all i had and MAGNIFICENT.  Also didnt have mini choco chips so used chopped reg size.  The last sub i made was to use 50/50 white-whole grain wheat.  My girlfriend is also particular about waffles, but to a different degree, also loved them.

These waffles are definitely light and tasty.  I made them without chocolate chips, but I hadn't noticed that the recipe did not contain sugar.  Without the chocolate chips, you definitely need to add a tablespoon or two of sugar to the batter.  This recipe is a good versatile recipe.  I think you could leave it plain for a savory waffle, or add some herbs instead of the chocolate chips.  For a sweet waffle, I recommend putting in some sugar.  I imagine you use any kind of add-ins or toppings that you want with this basic recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving it 3 stars, even though my family thinks it only deserves 1, because the batter was light and fluffy and without the chocolate chips would probably make for a pretty good waffle.  However, they are a bit time consuming and there were WAY too many chocolate chips in them.  You could easily halve the chocolate chips and still have a chocolate chip waffle, only it wouldn't have such over-powering flavor.  I served them topped with strawberries and whipped cream.  My husband and my 5-year-old both requested that I never make these again.

Great waffles! Texture was light and they tasted terrific. I chose this recipe partly because I had buttermilk in the fridge that I wanted to use up, so I did as another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 skim milk for the milk and omitted the buttermilk powder. I also added a pinch of salt and a a little sugar, since I didn't use any chocolate chips. I made a 1/2 recipe, and was a little surprised that it was only enough for 2 full waffles in the waffle iron, when the recipe said it should have made 5. Only two of us eating breakfast, so not a problem, but makes me think the yield of 10 waffles in the original recipe must mean 10 squares, not 10 full waffles. Really good recipe, thanks for sharing!

I liked these because, unlike every other waffle recipe I've tried, they didn't get soggy instantly & I thank you for that!!  They stayed crispy & yet were still fairly light.  I used real buttermilk & decreased the choc chips a little but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  These really lean on the choc for flavor, even with real buttermilk the flavor was pretty mild.  I'm sure I'll try these again but with a few tsp. of sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!  :o)

These really are LIGHT and fluffy.  They are probably better suited as a dessert.  However, if you half the amount of chocolate chips, they probably wouldn't be too sweet!
YUM!  I hope a lot of people try them!

This recipe made a good waffle and my kids like them, but they tasted a little too eggy to me. Maybe because I cut back on the chocolate chips.

Outstanding recipe! You really nailed the right leavening agents on this one, Bigtimemenace! I get a laugh out of the people who complain about this recipe being too time consuming. Whisking the eggs to stiff peaks is time consuming, but there is just no substitute for the thousands of air bubbles that steam and leaven these waffles. I made these waffles this morning and everyone in the house went crazy over them! Thank You for sharing this one.

These were fantastic!  I did not use chocolate chips...used toasted pecans and cinnamon.  Is a fantastic base recipe to add what you want.  Waffles were crisp on the outside and light and airy on the inside...well worth the effort!!

The waffles came out very good  a little crispy on the outside just how I like my waffles. I made same changes, used regular butter milk and did not use cream instead added regular milk . Also I added some vanilla .

Yummy! I had no heavy cream, so I used Nestle's crema' in a can.  No time for stiff peaks so I just blended in the egg yolks then added the whites.  Excellent texture too.

4 stars because I had to make modications. . First of all, the batter comes out very thick, and I prefer a thinner one. I double the recipe, so instead of 3 cups of flour I use 2. I also added 4 tsp of sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. I don't add chocolate chips because my daughter doesn't like them. I made this about 3 times, changing the recipe until it suited me. I make a big batch so my daughter can them for breakfast throughout the week.

These are a lot of work, but are worth it to me. Very good.

These waffles were great.  Made them in my Belgian waffle maker.  Made exactly as the recipe states, other than adding 1 TB of sugar, because we put our chocolate chips on top, not IN the batter as the batter itself needed a bit of sweetness. We chose to put the chips on top because some in our family wanted strawberries on top instead.  Either way, chips & whipped cream, or strawberries & whipped cream......yum!   The recipe made 12 squares.  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but these just weren't that great for us, they weren't even as fluffy as I expected.  Both of my boys liked them (and we didn't find the chocolate chips to be overpowering as some other reviewers did, but we certainly didn't need syrup on top, they were sweet enough as is) but none of us thought they were as good as some of the other waffle recipes we have tried, and they were much more work.  I've saved the rest of the batter to try as pancakes, as one reviewer recommended.  I might try the recipe again with some of the shortcuts recommended by other reviewers, but I won't be making it as posted again, too much work for what you get.

I used real buttermilk in place of the cream and they came out very light, some of the best waffles I've made!  Left chocolate chips out because I didn't have any.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious recipe!  I made mine with a waffle iron and the outside was crisp and the inside very light and fluffy.  I made some minor substitutions based on the ingredients I had on hand and added a little salt.  Made one batch w/out choco chips and one with - both were outstanding.  Will definitely use again.

I have two kids that will be polite and tell me something's "ok" if they don't like it.  I made these waffles up fallowing the recipe as written with the acception of real buttermilk which I whipped in with the egg yolks.  The end result?  I thought my kids had thrown them away because they disappeared so fast!  The giveaway was when they begged to make some more that morning and again the next day!

Aweseome! I cut this recipe in half for my boyfriend and I and followed it exactly. Turned out perfectly, very light would even be great without the chocolate chips.

I made this with 2 fixes. I didnt' have heavy cream so I used whole milk for the milk & the cream. The batter turned out just fine! I did everything else as directed but I didn't want the chocolate chips in so I omitted those. The batter was super light & fluffy! When I tasted them though they were a little better than a normal waffle mix; they are lighter than a waffle mix. I'm not quite sure if all the work is worth it in the end. I'll probably just use a mix next time to save time, and if I have more time I'll make this recipe.

I thought these were pretty good. I didn't have buttermilk powder, so i omitted it. I didn't want the hassle of seperating the egg, so i just put it all together. This batter was thicker than most waffle recipes i tried, but these waffles were crisper than the ones i make, which i liked. Kids loved them simply because they have choc chips in them.

These were definitely fluffy but better suited for a dessert.   In the future, I will add a little sugar and omit the chocolate chips for a more "normal" breakfast.

I thought these were GREAT, although a lot of work.  They were very light and fluffy and also crisp which for me was great!  (I have a belgian waffle maker and can't always find crisp waffle recipes)  My husband gave them 4 stars and my daughters both loved them.  
I did make a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients:  I used regular buttermilk and added it after combining the wet and dry ingredients and also used a cup of regular chocolate chips.
If you like very sweet waffles, these would not be for you...the chocolate chips supply most of the flavor and sweetness.
Thanks for a great recipe!
