All I can say is YUM!! SOOO good! I made a few changes and I think they really helped. First, I sautéed some chopped scallions and minced fresh garlic before sautéing the pork chops in the frying pan and I pre-seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper and a little garlic powder. I also cut the pork chops into small bite-sized pieces to make this more like a casserole. I used low-fat cream of broccoli soup (it was what I had on hand). I added about 2 cups fresh green beans and lined them on the bottom of the pan. I added about a cup of real bacon bits (“Hormel” makes these in a jar). I also omitted the ½ cup milk as some of the other reviewers recommended doing – they said the milk made this dish too runny. I doubled the cheddar cheese and used fresh-grated extra sharp cheddar. This dish was scrumptious! It’s very fattening, so I probably won’t make it too often, but when I’m looking for a special treat, I’ll definitely make it again!

Very Good...and easy!  I made the following changes: used 30 oz of hash browns, 1 cup sour cream, 1 cup cheese mixed into potatoes.  I did not mixed the french fried onions into the mix.  After cooking for 40 mins, I topped with 1/2 cup cheese and 1 cup fried onions...came out great!  If you use the 30 oz. of potatoes I would suggest baking for an extra 10 minutes!  Will make again!

Delicious, delicious, delicious! I have made this recipe lots of times - one of my favorites. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe.  I bought 9 butterfly pork cops that were halved and  were 1/2" thick.  I used  a whole bag of 32oz. Southern style hash browns (they are cubed - I do not like the Southern with bell pepper and onions) 1 cup sour cream, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with garlic, 3/4 c. milk.  I seasoned BOTH the potato mixture and the pork chops with:  salt, Lawry's seasoning pepper, Montreal steak seasoning , Jane's salt and garlic powder. I think one of the best ways to make this recipe good is in the seasoning and when browning the pork chops make sure you brown them well.  Also, the hash browns MUST be defrosted before using.  I  put 1 1/2 cups cheese in the potato mixutre and top with only onion rings, I also keep 1/4 of  the onion rings in the potato mixture.  My son in law, which never eats very much, ate four pork chops, he absolutly loved this recipe.  I am anxious to try this with chicken breasts. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was wonderful, Ter! Thanks so much. I cut milk to 1/4 cup because of other reviews. I also added green beans to my potato mixture. Used pork loin chops with no bone and baked 1 hr at 375 degrees. My family couldn't stop eating this wonderful dish.

Delicious !! I made these today and the guys absolutely loved it. I did a few alterations after reading the reviews...first I used potatoes o'brien, cream of mushroom soup, used 1 cup onions and 1 cup cheese in the potato mix and 1 can of drained green beans...added for taste salt, pepper, garlic powder and lawry's seasoned salt...browned 1 inch butterfly chops in olive oil and the added seasonings and finally put 1/2 cup cheese and onions on top...cook time was perfect for tender and juicy chops...will definitely make this again

I loved this recipe. I used boneless pork chops with cream of mushroom soup! Loved it even more for leftovers.

Man, oh man, what a tasty dish this turned out to be! I read the reviews and made a few slight changes... Be sure to season your pork chops well before browning them in the skillet. (I used Montreal Steak seasoning and garlic powder). Instead of Cream of Celery soup, I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic... MUCH better flavor than celery! Cut back on the milk just a tad; try 1/3 cup rather than 1/2. Also, add all the cheese in at once with the hash browns; you really don't need to save any back for the topping. I bought the larger size can of French Fried Onions and mixed about 2/3 of it in with the hash browns, then I sprinkled the rest of the can over the chops as a last step before baking. I took this to a pot luck dinner and everyone loved it. Five people asked me for the recipe and I even got somewhat of a marriage proposal... he said, "If you weren't already married, I'd marry you right now!" This is not a "figure friendly" type of meal, but it is truly delicious.

Very VERY GOOD!!! While browning the chops, I liberally spiced them up with some all-season salt & garlic/onion powder. Thanks to others, I reduced the milk to 1/4c and reduced the FF Onions by half. I am thankful for this easy and tasty recipe! Creamy potatoes and chops...what a comforting combination!

This was yummy comfort food!  I seasoned my pork chops liberally with garlic powder, seasoning salt, and pepper.  I had to bake this a little longer then written because my hashbrowns weren't totally defrosted, but it still came out yummy.

This was good but not great.  It needed something to liven it up some.  I probably won't make this again.  But it was worth the try.

Loved this one!  Even my husband who isn't that much of a pork chop fan enjoyed this one and said would eat again.  I didn't have any French fried onions so sauted onion and garlic before cooking the pork chops. Think I saved a few calories by leaving off the fried onions at least.  Mixed the onion/garlic in with the hashbrown mixture.  Also didn't have celery soup so used cream of mushroom. Made quite a bit, so had for leaft overs the next evening and was even better than the night before.  Will be making this one over and over.
11/18/08 UPDATE
Did all the same as last time but because didn't have time to put in the oven put everything in the crock pot.  Potatoes came out mashed instead of shreaded-but was still super yummy.  My husband said he liked it better that way.  Make sure to spray your crock with cooking spray to help cut down on sticking.

Voted best dinner by everyone at our house! Our new family favorite! I used O'brien potatoes (frozen 20 oz bag) and heavily seasoned the chops (garlic powder, salt, pepper, Montreal steak seasoning) as well as added seasonings to potatoes per other reviews--the best!

This recipe is very easy and very delish.  My family loved it. I cooked it a little longer, and at 375, and put it in a glass bake pan so I could see the bottom because I like it to be a little brown. Thank you.

This meal was WONDERFUL! Very comforting and filling. The only changes I made to it was to cut the pork chops into pieces and I cooked the whole thing in my crock pot. I live for the crock pot so I am always converting recipes so that I can slow cook them. I followed the recipe and placed the potato mixture on the bottomand my pork chop pieces on top. Slow cook for about 7 hours on low. Add the cheese and onions for the last half hour of cooking. DELICIOUS!!

Sorry, but this was just "meh". Not bad, but not wonderful, just average. Hubby and I feel the same about this one. Not sure why so many 5 star ratings and great reviews, but I guess to each their own. Will not make again.

Super dish-I used Tater Tots instead and it\wasn't to mushy. Very good rating and would give it out. I also added parsley.

I have been making this recipe for lots of years.  It's a favorite of my husband, me, and a couple of our kids.  It is very tasty.  Depending on your oven, and how "done" you like your potatoes, you may have to let this bake  a bit longer.  I usually bake it for at least an hour, but we like our potatoes to be very tender.

My family loved this recipe.  Pork Chops were tender and the entire thing was filling.  I did add some Garlic Powder when browning the chops.  But it is an excellent casserole.

I really like the base of this recipe, but I made some changes to make it healthier. I made my own cream of celery soup to cut down on sodium, fat, and other additives found in canned soup. Very easy to do, by the way. I also shredded red potatoes and kept the skin on for extra vitamins instead of pre-packaged hash browns. Used low-fat sour cream, but I did stay true to the recipe and used full-fat cheese and added the onions, but only used about 1/3 of a cup since they're not the healthiest. Made a side of steamed green beans and voila! The dish was tasty and can easily be altered here and there to fit individual preferences.

This was good. I doubled the potatoe mixture and used 4 pork steaks. I was a little nervous with all the gravy that formed on the top. I thought the potaoes were going to be too runny but they weren't too bad. I think next time I will used cubed hashbrowns instead of shredded. I also seasoned the pork with onion and garlic powder. Husband said it was good so I will  try it again.

GOOD!!  We love these cheesey potatoes anyway,  so with pork chops on top they were great!  An easy make ahead meal or one to bring to someone else (I brought it to families at church that had just had new babies!)  Be careful not to really cook the chops -- just brown them on the stove and then they will cook up the rest of the way in the oven nice and moist.

I thought this was ok, I think it would be better with ham or breakfast sausage instead of pork chops; also it was more suited for a breakfast or brunch dish, which I was not expecting.  I will try it again next time with cooked sausage links.

A very good comfort dish!  Nice choice if you are bringing a new mom a dish or other homebound person.  Be sure to thaw the potatoes before baking.  Somehow I missed this little part!

I thought this was a great recipe.  My only difficutly was deciding whether it called for putting the chops in with bone.  I opted to cut the meat from the bone before putting in to the mixture and baking.  I also chose to add some cayanne pepper(just a little!!) to the mix to spice it up a bit.  Also,.. I did bake it a little longer to make sure the potatoes were done!

this is a great recipe and not hard at all.  i had never made baked pork chops, but with this recipe, i'll make them again and again.  sometimes i don't even use the pork chops and i'll just make the potato casserole (which tastes almost like twice baked potatoes).  a must try!!!!!

This was good!  I did add garlic, green onions, thyme, salt & pepper to the pork and I diced it up.  I also used fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of sour cream, and just a 1/4 cup of milk for the potato mixture.  I seasoned the potatoes with S & P, and some paprika as well.  I used cubed potatoes and let it cook a little longer it was great!

This is a great dish!  I also make it with chicken and use cream of chicken soup in place of cream of mushroom. It's a great comfort food for winter!

I only give this a 3 because I thought the texture of the pork wasn't the best. Also the flavor of the pork was pretty bland. But those were minor details. The potato part was so yummy! My husband and daughter loved it as did I! Will make again with a few changes.

I read the other reviews before cooking so I made my own little version to try and make my husband happy (he's really picky).  What I did was I seasoned the meat like others suggested and because I was concerned with others saying it lacked a bit of flavor I exchanged the sour cream for french onion dip and for cheese I used taco cheese.  It turned out great and I definetly will make this again!

This was GREAT! My new MISSION has been to look for recipes that do NOT have to be served immediately.  After reading NUMEROUS reviews, I tweaked it a bit. I didn't have the onions, but sauteed rooms, about 1/4 c diced onions, and a variety of colored bells with garlic before searing.  My chops (loins) were thin, so I SEARED them, (high heat really fast), and added "Essence" and a Sage before cooking.  Added more Essence, S&P, garlic powder, onion powder to potato mixture.  I also used the entire can of Cream of Celery instead of 1/2 like it called for when I halved the recipe, but left the milk and SC the way the recipe said after reading some reviews that it was "runny".  I also didn't have a full bag of hash browns, but did had some tater tots which I broke up.  I also cooked it at 375, which some reviews suggested, but I felt like I overcooked it just a bit (my thermometer read 171 when I turned it OFF! :) However, family LOVED it!) Next time I think I'll either cook it at 375 for less time (might have helped reduce liquid referred to in other reviews)?  OR cook it at 350 for time stated in recipe.  Overall, this was a GREAT recipe! Adding it to new Recipe List! Thank you for submitting it and I don't know WHY people would NOT like this (BTW defrost hash browns 1st too) unless they just already eat these kinds of casserole type dishes, which I do NOT usually, or they did something wrong?!  Again, it was AWESOME! Something different and perfect! THANKS AGAIN! :)

This was very good.  My husband and I love pork and to be able to cook the chops (or steaks even) differnt ways is a big help.
Because there is only the two of us, I used just two chops and kept the rest of the recipe the same and just used the leftover potatoes as a side dish for another night.  I also omitted the milk, and I used cream of chicken soup.

Very nice and great for a hearty meal for a hungry group.  I agree with others that you only need to use 1/2 the milk.  I also chopped the onion rings before adding them.  Will certainly make again.  Goes great with Sweet Green Bean Bundles recipe.  For ease rather than bundle the Green Beans, I just cut up the bacon and add to the beans.

This was great!!  The entire family enjoyed it - even our 15 month old!  Although the recipe is fine as is, I browned the pork chops in garlic and sage and added extra cheese and onions.  Thank you, Ter! This will become a regular in our house!

This was so delicious!  This is such comfort food for upcoming cold winter nights.  And can easily be made well ahead of time.  Whatever you do, do not forget the french fried onions on top - - they are the perfect topping to this dish.

Really enjoyed this one (husband loved it!)  Did use mushroom soup, which I had on hand and omitted milk as it looked as though it would be too mushy with it.  Turned out well, think the milk would have made it too runny. Did have to cook over an hour for pork chops to be done.  Will definitely make again.

Would give this more stars if possible!! It was great!!My 11 month old ate 2 helpings and even my picky 2 yr old said "mmmm" with every bite!! Hubby loved it too and he is just as picky as our 2yr old! The onions give it just the right amount of crunch so you don't feel like you are eating mush. I followed the review for the 30 oz of hash browns and just fried my chops with garlic powder, s & p and oregano. I will be making this again and sharing the recipe with my family...maybe :)

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it! I seasoned the pork chops well before I browned them. Then I used the whole bag of hashbrowns and more like 3/4 C of sour cream and only 1/4 C of milk. I also added all of the cheese into the potato mixture and then just sprinkled a little on top with the rest of the french fried onions. The pork chops were so tender and juicy and the potatoes were perfect. Made some steamed vegetables with this and we are full and satisfied. I will definitely make this again and again.

i thought this was good. comfort food. i used low sodium soup, and i fried my own hash browns instead of frozen, because i like mine better. that was my only change. i will also play around with spices and such to change it. personally, i don't agree this site should be for creative healthy recipes only. it's great to have down home, just plain good easy cookin' too. we can pick and choose on our own.

Turned out very good!  I used some French onion sour cream based dip instead of the plain sour cream, since I had some on hand and to compensate that I was a bit short on the French-fried onions, and left out the milk since my hashbrowns were still partially frozen when I put them in the oven and I figured would add adequate moisture that way.  I put them in the oven just before we left for a T-ball game, (which I had not preheated, I turned it on just before we left, and covered the dish with foil) and came home an hour later to a great meal!  Make sure to trim your pork chops well to avoid excess fat accumulating on top of the potatoes, but the chops turned out very tender.

Great recipe will try it again.  I sauteed the pork chops with onion and garlic and used cream of chicken soup.  The sauce was wonderfull but next time I will use more hashbrowns mine was a little bit runny.

All of the creamy stuff in this recipe changed the taste of the porkchops.  They tasted less like pork and more like cheese and sour cream. I won't be making this again.

This gave me a good basic idea and after a few changes, it came out really nice.  I didn't have frozen hash browns at home so I just grated 4 potatoes and added it to the mixture.  I also grated a reg. onion.  I didn't have sour cream but I had heavy cream and used a 1/2 cup of that.  I also crumbled some fried  bacon into it.  This is nice because you can vary it to other things that need using up in the fridge.

Mmm, good!  Hubby is not a big pork chop fan but loved this.  I used three thick boneless chops but kept the rest of the ingredients pretty much the same, except used cream of mushroom soup and only about half of the hash browns.  I think the amount of milk would be fine with the full amount of potatoes.  I also cut back on the fried onions, using them just in the hash brown mix.  That was plenty, it didn't need any on top.  I baked the chops for 45 minutes.  I like the idea of adding green beans to the mix; makes it a one dish meal.  Thanks so much for sharing, this was wonderful!

This was not what I had expected.  Was not fond of the pork chops texture/flavor and think maybe chicken would have been a better choice but that was just my personal preference.   Potatoes were very bland and needed some ooomph!   Husband liked it and said he would eat it again if I made it but I doubt I would, at least not with the pork chops.

My entire family LOVED this (2 boys, ages 12 & 14 plus hubby).  The only things I did different were minor - I used cream of mushroom soup, my cheese was a mixture type and I threw in some regular onion (by mistake!).  I can't say enough how yummy this was!  Thank you!

Very easy recipe. Quick to assemble, and then you can just pop it in the oven and walk away! My husband and brother-in-law both raved over how good it was the first time I made it, and my husband requests it frequently!

Really liked this recipe.  Great comfort food.  I only made one change and that was that I used the O'brien potatoes with peppers and onions.  Added some extra flavor and I took the advice of some of the other viewers and browned my pork chops with some garlic salt and pepper.  By the way, I realized after I put my potatoes in to mix that I purchased a 28oz bag rather than the 20oz bag that it called for and he still came out perfect.

Delicious!   I omitted the cheese (I thought there was enough dairy already), and also the french-fried onions, as I didn't have them kicking around, but I did slice up an onion for the pot instead. So good! Such a great recipe, and my husband made sure there were no leftovers.   Cheers!

This is excellent.  I made a few changes to suit our family.  After browning pork chops I added 1 tablespoon of the fat to the potato mixture.  Also I added cayenne pepper for a little bite.  I thought about adding bacon bits next time.

Great way to use left-over pork loin.  I cubed the pork and had some left-over hashbrowns but not enough so I heated a can of diced potatoes w/ Lawerys.  I also added about 3 T. green chilis to the top before the cheese.  It added great flavor.  Also added just a touch of seasoned bread crumbs to the top.  Let sit for a few min. before serving.

This was extremely yummy!  I am a huge cheese and potato fan, but wasn't so sure about the cheese/pork chop combo.  I'm so glad I tried it!  I modified the recipe a tad, taking suggestions from other reviewers.  I seasoned the pork chops with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder and minced garlic during the browning process.  I used less milk (only 1/4 cup) to avoid runniness, used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery (my family's preference), added extra cheese (1 cup in mixture, 1 cup on top), and used the entire 30 oz. package of hashbrowns.  With the addition of the extra cheese & potatoes, I think it would have been okay to use the full amount of milk called for.  I will probably try that next time.  Thanks for livening up my pork chop options by sharing this recipe!

Loved this recipe. I made a few changes as well by using some of the reviews- I seasoned the porkchops and let them sit with the seasoning until ready to cook; I also added minced garlic to the vegetable oil before browning the pork chops and added a cup of the Oscar Mayer ready made cooked bacon pieces; also used more cheese!  Even my 4 year old cleared her plate and asked for seconds!! Tami

Ok.  Nothing special.  It's a typical "Cream Of" recipe.  I'll make this again when I need an easy weeknight meal and have some pork chops handy.

This recipe was great!  Very filling.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, however, I browned the hashbrowns before mixing them with the other ingredients to add some color, and I used boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than pork chops.  I liked it better with the chicken, and the presentation was a little nicer with the browned hashbrowns.  This recipe is very cost-efficient and has become one of my family's favorites!

This was such a hit with my very picky family! It was something new and different and we did think it was tasty. It did take about 15 minutes LONGER to cook than listed on the recipe. I would definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  I seasoned the pork chops with some garlic powder and pepper before browning them, and I thought they had plenty of flavor.  I also baked the potatoes a little before placing the chops on top of them, since I like them crispier rather than soggy.  The fried onions and cheese topping made this dish really tasty...thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy, and delicious recipe. I cut down on milk based on some of the reviews I read.
Everyone enjoyed, thank you!!!!!
The next morning I used dinner's leftover potato/cheese mixture - fried in a little butter for 2 minutes ,browning both sides.  Enjoyed with eggs.

Hubby wasn't thrilled with this dish.  I think it would be much better to season the pork chops to your liking and also add a little garlic and onion powder to the soup mixture.

This dish was excellent. The only thing I did differently is use Cream of Broccoli instead of Cream of Celery. I hate celery! Anyway - the cream of broccoli worked wonderfully, and the dish was great! Easy to put together. Will definitely make it again!

It would have tasted much better had I actually done something to the pork chops.  They were very bland.  The potatoes were good though.

I baked this recipe according to the directions and used a stoneware 9X13 pan.  It was great.  My son said I should not hesitate to make it again and often.  I had the tiny amount that was leftover for lunch the next day and it was just as good.

WOW!! This was the best baked pork chop we have ever had. My whole family loved it. I normally do not like Cream of Celery soup but the combination in this recipe was great. Definately a keeper for my family.

I first tried this recipe when I was pregnant and stocking the freezer with casseroles for after we came home from the hospital.  I'm so glad I did!  This has become a family favorite.  I've never liked the French-fried onions until I tried this recipe.  They add so much flavor - I usually use more than the recipe calls for.  This makes a great side dish for other meats, too, if you want to leave off the pork chops. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The chops were good but it was runny.  I'll make this again but I think I'll adjust the liquid ingredients a little.

I personally loved this meal, I used the cube hashbrowns not shredded, and it was very cheesey. It could have used a little more bake time as the taters weren't quite done but still was good. My hubby who is a VERY picky eater thought it was okay, and would eat it again, but not on his list of favs. It's on mine though.

The potatoes were great.  The pork chops just ok.  I will make the potatoes again but just not the chops. I'm still looking for a good recipe that adds flavor to chops.

My husband and I loved this!  I used Campbell's Select cream of mushroom (16 oz.out of an 18 oz can, undiluted).  It's all I had in the pantry, and it turned out better than I expected- thick and creamy sauce, nice tender potatoes.  Really yummy!
I will definately make this again.

This was very good and a definite keeper.  I did however, use 30 oz bag of frozen hashbrowns THAWED so used 1 cup sour cream instead of 1/2 cup and I baked it an additional 15 min. A big hit!

This was so good. I uses Simply Potatoes hash browns instead of frozen and followed one of the reviewer idea of the cream of mushroom soup with garlic. I will definitely make this again.

I made this substituting Greek yogurt for the sour cream and a crunchy pepper mix instead of the onions.  I also added some frozen haricots verts as suggested by another reviewer.  I heavily seasoned the pork chops with Lewry's Seasoning salt.  The outcome was excellent.  It gets better with each re-heating.

Added green bean bottom layer as suggested by some other reviewers and used Cream of Mushroom soup vs Cream of Celery (not my fav) and boneless pork chops vs bone-in pork chops. Made a good winter all-in-one meal of boneless pork chops, hashbrown casserole and green beans. Gotta love the crunchy onion topping, too! Made my Recipe Box for Main Meals. Thanks! :-)

This was a good recipe.  I tweaked it to add more liquid and did it in the slow cooker because I am in looooove with having my dinner cook itself while I'm at work. Thanks so much for the inspiration!

I seasoned the chops with Montreal steak seasoning, salt and garlic powder, still the chops where tasteless.  Did not like the taste of the potatoes at all.  The best I can say about this recipe is that it wasn't watery like other reviewers complained about.  Won't be making this again.

This dish was good, but next time I'm may take other users advice and skip the milk. After adding more potatoes than the recipe suggested and adding sweet peas, It was still too runny. I also added the seasonings (salt, pepper and garlic powder) on the pork chop in addition to the soup mixture. Will make again

This was a huge hit at our house. My very picky children say that it is their favorite food (over pizza...) We didn't change a thing, although I've made it with cream of mushroom soup when I didn't have cream of celery and that was just as wonderful!

Stayed fairly true to the recipe. Did season the pork chops before browning.  Everyone really enjoyed it. I think this is a recipe that you can play with by adding your choice of veggies or changing the soup.  Easy and filling!

So good and SO easy!!! I followed the recipe and even used low-fat milk, sour cream, and cheese and it was delicious!  I admit I seasoned the pork chops with s&p and garlic powder before searing them, but that's the only change. My mom makes a potato casserole that is very similar to this and adds a small can of diced green chiles for a little kick.  It's a really great addition to the casserole so I may try that next time with the pork chop bake, just to experiment.  It's great just the way it is though!

This is just like cheezy potato casserole with pork chops - followed recipe exactly; suggest you do the same. Very flavorful. No adjustments needed.

Made as suggested but substituted Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Celery (based on personal taste) and used refrigerated hash browns. This had a great amalgamation of flavors and was easy. Will make again!

This was just Ok, but I gave it 4 stars as I think I could have done a few things differantly. Followed recipe, except I put it in a smaller pan, Mistake! I also used chunky hash browns instead of shredded, which for my family"s tastes, would have been better. Will make it again for sure.

My husband absolutely loved this dish, I tried it on him first,  I made up two batches one for us and one to take today for a pass around dish,  I listen to other reviews and seasoned the chops as I was frying them up with adobo, and garlic powder.  I also cut up the chops after they were fried into small pieces makes it alot easier to eat .  Will be making this when the boys come home.

I thought this dish was excellent.  So did my hubby. It was not watery as some had said nor was it dry.  Here is what I did to change it up some.  In olive oil with onion flakes and minced garlic I placed the pork chops in the pan with seasoning salt and peper.  While they were browning up, I mixed together the shredded hash brown potatoes (30 oz)bag, can of cream of chicken, can of cream of celery, 1/4 cup milk, 1 cup sour cream, seasoning salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle of minced onion and garlic powder, 1 teaspoon basil, 1 can green beans and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Placed in a 2 qt casserole dish and topped with chops.  Baked for 1 hour and then added remaining cheese and french fried onions and baked an additional 10-15 mins.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was good, but I wouldn't call it great.  The chops had good flavor and the potatoes were good, but kind of runny.  I may or may not make it again.  Probably look for something better. I have this potato recipe that I make on it's own with crushed corn flakes on top.  I'd stick with that than to put it with the pork chops next time.

This was easy and so delicious!  Definitely season your chops well before they go into the oven.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery, added 1/2 C milk plus more sour cream then the recipe called for and it was not runny at all. I also added more cheese as well. Everyone loved it!  We are going to try it with chicken tonight.

This dish was so delicious.  My whole family loved it.  Like other reviewers, I seasoned the chops with pepper and seasoned salt before browning them.  I then used a 32 oz. bag of "Southern-style" (cubed) hashbrowns, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup sour cream, 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese and seasoned with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Cooked for about 45 minutes, then topped with onion pieces and 1/2 cup cheese.  Came out nice and creamy without being overly runny.  This is great comfort food and will probably show up an our menu often.

My husband and I loved this! I made a couple changes based on what I had on hand. Instead of frozen potatoes, I just shredded my own and also used colby jack cheese to top it because I ran out of cheddar, and it added a lot of flavor. I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder and seasoned salt while browning and used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. I will definitely be making this again!

I made recipe tonight for my husband and I as I am always looking for something new to do with pork chops. We both thought it was very good and I will make it again however, I will modify it a bit. I should have seasoned the pork chops first as I thought it was a bit bland and I think next time I will try a cream of potato soup rather than the celery. I do like celery however I didn’t think it complimented the potatoes that well.

Sounds good to me!  Anything that can make my life easier is worth a try.  I don't worry about calories much.  This is an easy recipe to lighten up.  My kids aren't big potato eaters so I will probably make it without this hash browns.

This is a great recipe!  I've been wanting a new quick and tasy recipe to cook pork chops.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's a little high in calories and fat but could easily be reduced by using low or no fat soup, sour cream, cheese, etc.

This was a very good recipe. I adapted it a bit,I sprinkled the potatoes with seasoned salt,sauteed onion and garlic in the oil and added that to the potato instead of the french fried onions. I  coated the pork chops with garlic salt and pepper before browning. I reserved a bit of the sauce to top the chops with after putting them over the potato mixture. I topped it with the french fried onions and sharp cheddar cheese. Very good. I will make this again.

My favorite baked pork chop recipe of all time !! I used bone-in chops that were a little on the thin side. Next time I will use boneless butterflied chops.  This recipe will be added to my monthly rotation.

I made this for my family last week and they loved it...even the kids!  I added a can of green beans to the mix.  If using pork chops with the bone, increase cooking time to about 1 1/2 hours.  Next time I'll use boneless pork chops.

Made this last night...was wonderful.  Seasoned chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder and grill seasoning before searing.  Omitted milk, added french cut green beans & substituted french onion dip for sour cream per another reviewers suggestion...fabulous!!

I initially found this recipe when looking for ideas to use up leftover pulled pork roast.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used cream of mushroom (what I had in the pantry) and about 1.5 cups of shredded pork instead of the chops.  And since my hash browns were not thawed I actually browned them in a skillet with a little garlic powder before mixing everything together.  Used all other ingredients as listed, but decreased baking time since it was all already cooked.  My husband raved about this!  I thought the fried onions gave it almost an odd sweet flavor, but still thought it was good.  My picky daughter ate it, though my picky son did not like it (but he doesn't like anything).

Very yummy and so easy to make. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and seared the pork instead of browning it. And I used a whole can of mushroom soup instead of celery soup. The pork turned out very tender. Definitely a keeper.

I needed a recipe to use up leftover pork tenderloin and I saw this and tried it, it was great!  As I had said, I didn't use pork chops I used leftovers,and it worked out.  I did use the cream of mushroom soup like the other people suggested and added a little extra milk and sour cream.  And it turned out.  My husband really liked it as did my son, (who doesn't eat any other kind of potato except french fries) and he liked it.  As Joey put it..."Delicious"!!!!  Thanks

It was good, different yet simple.  I added string beans to make a complete meal.  It still needs a stronger taste though, thought it was a little bland.

This was an excellent recipe!  I used a 26 oz. bag of shredded hashbrowns, so I increased the sour cream and milk just a tad.  For personal preference, next time I would add more salt to the potatoes and less french fried onions to the top.

This was well received at dinner last night for my parents, my husband and 2 year old son.

We agreed that searing the pork chops versus browning them on the stove would help to keep them juicy since they are also in the oven for 40-60 minutes (depending on your stove and based on the other reviews on timing). Since the pork chops are sprinkled with cheese and fried onions you really don't see the tops of them or that they were browned. I say juicy over dry chops!
I will make this again!

Yummy!  I modified this to suit our taste buds and nutrition goals and it came out great!  Used fat free sour cream, skim milk, and healthy choice cream of chicken soup.  Also used boneless skinless chicken breasts (what I had on hand).  I didn't have enough french fried onions to put in the casserole, so I just sprinkled them on top.  Oh, and I used mozzerella instead of cheddar (again, what I had on hand :)).  Next time I will use more french fried onions than I did and will try to use cheddar cheese instead.  Very tasty and creamy, though (to those who complained about too much milk, it's supposed to be creamy, not crispy :))  Hubby and I gobbled this up - delicious comfort food (without all the guilt!)

Very tasty!  I would use thinner pork chops next time instead of the one-inch-thick I used, as they did not cook through in the suggested time.

This was so easy and so good!  I used frozen cubed potatoes that already had red and green peppers and onions in it.  I think that gave it great flavor and may have been bland with plain frozen hashed browns.  I'm looking forward to trying this with chicken.

This was a pretty good meal.  I didn't have the french fried onions, but it was still good.  Personally, my hubby and I didn't like the cream of celery soup (I'd never used it before)so, when I make it next time, I'll use cream of chicken or mushroom.  It's something different, without being too different!  Thanks for sharing!

Although a good taste, I believe it needs a little MORE flavor.  I will try adding some sage next time, and perhaps another spice to jazz it up some.  My husband pronounced it "OK", but didn't ask me to keep the recipe.

This was so good!  I used Potato O'Brians and plain yogurt and it was so good and easy.  I haven't tried brining the pork (soaking it in salt water before cooking it) and understand that will help the pork be juicy and tender.  Will try that next time.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I seasoned the pork chops as I browned them. I thought they would have been too bland without the extra seasoning.  It took longer than expected to cook the pork chops and cubed hash brown potatoes.  I skimped on the cheese, but I'll use the full amount in the future.  Next time, I'm going to try boneless chops and shredded potatoes.

This was ok. Not awesome, but not inedible either. My husband took his first bite, made a face and said "tastes like scalloped potatoes". Then he dumped a bunch of ketchup on and ate two helpings. I made this exactly as the recipe is written, though there were no "20 oz" packages of hash browns that I could find, they are all 30 or 32. I also wasn't sure if it should be cubes or shreds, I used cubes and weighed out 20 oz. Mine wasn't watery at all with 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. I should have gone with my instincts and used cream of mushroom instead of celery though, the cream of celery has a kind of weird aftertaste to me. Love the french fried onions on top! I might make this again.

This was an easy recipe with lots of basic ingredients.  The dish in a whole was less than I expected.  Don't get me wrong, my husband thought it was okay and wouldn't mind having it again, but it needed something to kick it to the next level.  Would be a good one to experiment with.  Maybe some veggies in the hashbrowns next time??

Very good.  Definately easy.  I don't think anyone could mess this up.  Would really be good on cool winter day.

Very, Very good recipe. I did cut the pork into cubes and sauteed in Teryaki sauce. Also used cream of chicken and added whole kernal corn. Wonderful.

This was just amazing!  I had company over the night I decided to try it and everyone RAVED about it.  The pork was GREAT as were the potatoes.  I used Cream of Mushroom instead of the other but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing.  This will be made again in this house.

This recipe was alright. Not the greatest, but easy to make. Next time I might use another cream soup; maybe cream of brocolli. Most of my crew said it was "do able".

This was just perfect.  I had my 4 year old help with the easier parts and used the cubed hash browns.  It was delicious and even the picky hubby loved it enough to eat THREE helpings!

Absolutely delicious.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this recipe.  It was perfect as written.  It had wonderful creamy taste with a bit of a crunch from the French Fried onions.  I definitely would serve this to company.  Try it, you'll love it.

It was pretty good... the chops weren't cooked all the way through.  I might try it again with different taters in it.  I think it has potential and I just need to play around with what I use in it and how I prepare it.

Found this recipe and gave it a try.  We loved it!!  The potatoes are the best part.  Invited a friend over (who is a very picky eater) and he actually asked for seconds.  Definately a keeper.

I agree with the other reviewers - season the pork chops when you brown them.  I used Penzey's Old World Spice combination and it added a lovely flavor to the dish.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery.  I also put in about 2 or 3 times as much french fried onion rings as called for.  Didn't hurt the flavor a bit.  I used 1 inch thick chops and increased the baking time to an hour.  Pretty good overall

Very yummy-my 3 year old loved the potatos and wanted seconds. I made sure to season the pork chops with salt and pepper...I think this will make a difference.

I made this for dinner tonight and the whole family was unimpressed. The chops were tasteless and the celery soup was overwhelming. While my husband managed to eat the chops, my three kids didn't eat at all. I'm afraid this taste combo didn't work for my family...not kid friendly at all.

Really good!  Was a little liquidy - maybe because I didn't have time to thaw the potatoes.  Next time, I'll probably reduce the liquid a little & use thicker cut chops.  We love garlic so I added some to the pan when I was cooking the chops & used garlic salt.  My husband is reluctant to be my guinea pig, but he said, "Yeah, we can have this again."  Good as leftovers.

This is an excellent dish and very easy to make. I made it for my friends because they have a book keeping and tax service and spend many hours at the office and have no time to cook. They raved about it. I think it's one terriffic dish. Thanks for making it available.

The taste was just ok.  A little to bland for my family.  I think I will try it again, I will just add in some herbs and spices.  Also it could use a touch more cheese and definitely more onions.

This was really good.  I would add more fried onions to it though.  Overall, it had a good flavor, and it was pretty easy.

I must have really done something wrong with this! It cooked for over an hour and still the pork chops weren't done. Also everything tasted really salty. This was the first pork chop recipe I've ever cooked so maybe pork just isn't my thing.

Family dinner night  Everyone ate it up!  Did make a couple of changes based on other reviews.   Added green onions & a can of cream of mushroom soup, while omitting the milk.  Great recipe.  Thank you

The whole family loved this dish.  However, I did not see where it said to thaw the hashbrowns first.  Make sure you thaw them!  The pork was over cooked by the time the potatoes were done, but that's not the recipe's fault, it's mine!

We enjoyed this very much.  I did not use hash browns, I  cut  potatoes into small chunks.  I also added ranch dressing to the mixture.  I put salt, pepper, and paprika on the chops.  Will definitely make this again.

Fast and delicious! I was in a hurry so just used my electric skillet. I browned the chops, and added ½ c. of chopped onion to the skillet (only because I misread the recipe :-) I removed the chops from the skillet and put 6 hash browns in the bottom of the skillet because I didn't have any shredded hash browns. Then I layered the soup/sour cream/milk/cheese/french fried onion mixture on top of the hash browns and placed the pork chops on top it all. I did add a dollop of the sauce on top of the chops to keep them moist. It cooked for 30 minutes at 325 degrees in the electric skillet and it turned out wonderfully! I topped it, as suggested, with the french onions and cheese. My family loved it! This will become a staple at our house! Thank you for a fast and easy recipe!

This was very yummy! 16 month old liked!used a whole bag of potatoes and a can of peas/carrots, and added more time to cooking (note to self: try and stick to the same time as orig. recipe and do green beans! Jade you don't like peas!, made pork chops a little dry adding extra time)

It came out amazing, i followed some of the other reviews and instead used 2 cans of cream of mushroom condensed soup, a full cup of cheese inside the potato mixture, and i omitted the milk. It came out awesome and was very yummy. I changed it up a bit and cut the pork chops into small bite-sized pieces, i then smoothed out half of the potato mixture on the bottom of the 9x13 dish, i then put the bite-sized pork chop bits all over the top of that potato layer, i then covered the pork chops with the rest of the potato mixture and threw it in the oven. After the 40 minutes i took it out, threw the rest of the cheese on the top and threw the rest of the fried onions over that. It came out amazing and the little chunks of pork are about the size of the potatoes since i went with cubed hash browns. Very yummy dish! I totally recommend, just make a few changes here and there and you will love it!

Really good recipe.  I added a chopped onion to the potatoes instead of the French fried onions.  I used a little mare hash browns than called for in the recipe and added a bit more sour cream but didn't use the milk.  Sprinkled the French fried onions on top 5 minutes before the end.  I did bake around 50 minutes to ensure everything was done.  It came out perfect.

Good! I seasoned the chops with garlic/onion powder, sea salt and black pepper, also seasoned the potatoes the same way. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery soup. It was a little on the bland side but a nice comfort meal.

Made this last night and everyone loved it!!  My daughter's boyfriend wants the recipe.  The only thing I have to comment on is the "cover and bake" portion.  I covered with aluminum foil.  After 40 minutes in the oven, took the foil off and the pork chops were not done.  I had to cook longer without covering to finish.  Next time I won't cover at all and I think it will be fine.

Honestly, the only thing I changed was add garlic (because we love garlic in everything)and decided to substitute ranch dressing for the sour cream. It gave it a great flavor! We both loved it and will have this again! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. It look way longer than 40 minutes to cook, over an hour.

I had to make a couple of changes based on what I had on hand.  I used Cream of Onion soup since I didn't have any of the fried onions and also added a couple of sliced green onions to the potato mixture in their place.  I used six thick cut boneless pork chops (seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt and garlic during frying) and dusted the potato mixture and the chops liberally with paprika.   Baked at 400 for 45 minutes and then sprinkled with cheese and returned to the oven uncovered for 5 minutes.  I had absolutely no problems with consistency or flavor - will definitely make again!

I've made something like this for a long time but without the hashbrowns and I used cream of chicken instead of celery. Yes, it's weird, chicken and pork but it is the other white meat. I love the idea of adding hashbrowns. You can obtain a completely different texture and flavor simply by letting the pork chops burn a tiny bit early on. Deglaze that into the cream of whatever soup. It adds depth and a more hearty flavor than light. I find it especially good on mashed potatoes after making it which is kind of what the hash browns are. The other thing I do is buy what is called a picnic roast here which is insanely cheap and boneless compared to the chops. Really easy to cut off chop sized slices in whatever thickness you like.

However you make this recipe you will find it to be the bomb.

This recipe is delicious with a few minor changes. I listened to other reviews and I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, Montreal steak seasoning and garlic powder. I did use the cream of celery like it calls for because my boyfriend loves celery, I however do not, but I still loved the meal. I also added a can of green beans. Since my pork chops were no thick whatsoever, I first sautéed them, set them aside, and cooked the rest of the dish without the pork chops for 20 minutes, took it out, added the pork chops, and continued to cook covered for the rest of the time, 20 more minutes, until I added the cheese and onions on top. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!

It was delicious! I did double the cream of mushroom, cheese and sour cream. I shredded about 9 medium potatoes instead of the frozen hashbrowns and omitted the onions since I ran out of time. Will definitly make it again.

This was definitely a different taste for us. Not in a bad way though! I had hash brown patties (like you get at McDonald's).I just layed those at the bottom of my baking dish and poured the mixture onto them. I also mixed in some Cajun seasoning for a bit of spice but I put it in most dishes I make haha

This was SO delicious!!  I love pork chops and this was a yummy variation.  I used fat-free sour cream, skim milk, reduced fat cheese, and healthy request soup to make it a little less fatty.  I actually cut all ingredients in half and made in an 11x7 baking dish.   I also added a small can of green beans into the potato mixture after reading reviews. However, I used only 2 pork chops and it was the perfect amount for 2 hungry people. An awesome fall/winter easy dish to make!

This was a great recipie, my boyfriend loved it. I used fat free soup, light sour cream, skim milk and 2% cheese to cut down on the fat content. I also only put 1/2 the amount of onions on it over the top for the crunch and used cornflakes and sauteed onions in the potato mixture. It really cut down a lot on the fat content, but not the taste.

I also used the entire bag of hashbrowns. Used the amount of milk called for and added another 1/2 can of soup (full can of cream of mushroom & half can of cream of celery).  Used more cheese & onions too.  It was amazing! My husband has loved everything I make from this site, but THIS was his absolute favorite by a mile.  Easy & rave reviews.....doesn't get much better than that.

This recipe was okay.  A couple of family members had to put ketchup on the casserole so maybe I didn't put in enough salt.  They also suggested that the casserole might be better with some other sort meat (bacon, hamburger, or chicken).  Not sure if we will do this recipe again.

Very yummy!  Followed the advice of many others.  I omitted the milk.  Added 3 tbsp of onion soup mix to the sour cream.  I did not have onion rings, so I sauteed 2 onions instead, and saved them for the end to put on top of the pork chops.  I also added canned green beans and placed them at the bottom of the dish.  Will definitely make again!

Very good.  Made with fresh chopped potatoes, acorn squash and carrots.  Also used cream of broccoli soup instead of celery.  Will definitely make this again.  Three kids under five gobbled it up and wanted more!

This turned out excellent!  I think the key was that I used extra thick pork chops.  They were so juicy and delicious - my husband raved about them all night.  I made a few changes based on other reviews. I added a bed of fresh green beans to the bottom of the pan.  I cooked some onions in olive oil before browning the pork chops and seasoned the pork chops with pepper and a little ginger when browning.  I used only a little milk and added all the cheese to the potato mixture (instead of melting some over the top at the end).  Because of the thickness of my pork chops, I had to cook them for nearly an hour and a half, but the result was excellent - great recipe!

This is an Awesome soup, even the teens in my house love it! I changed it a bit by using different kinds of cheeses and I use chicken broth instead of water. It makes it a heartier soup. I once used pepper Jack and it was amazing!

I made it with grated fresh potato instead of hash browns. Really turned out delicous - next time I will cut down on the cheese slightly to make it a little less cheesy.

The flavor was there on this recipe, unfortunately it came out runny for me. I omitted the fried onions since hubby and I are not fans. I also made sure to season my chops well with salt, pepper and garlic powder before browning. I used potatoes o'brien (the kind with the peppers and onions) so I could sneak in some extra veggies. I'll make this again since we enjoyed the flavors so much, but I'll nix the milk and use a cup of sour cream.

This was pretty good, but I had to make some changes to get it that way.  Just following the recipe, the potatoes would have been dried out and not-so-good.  I added an extra half can of soup, more sour cream, and to jazz it up, some bacon pieces.  I really liked it, but my husband wasn't so fond of it.  I'll try it again, hopefully he'll come around!  :)

This is a keeper. It looks a little unappetizing, but if you get over the color and get that first bite in, it is worth it :) Everybody finished their portion, ages 1 to 40. Will make again.

I followed this exactly except my hash browns were not shredded. I thought it was very easy to make and good. My family loved it. Due to our dietary restrictions I won't serve this often but I will be making this again. Next time I think I will switch to cream of mushroom soup and add some mushroom to it as the celery soup really did nothing for it and we are not all that crazy about celery to begin with.

I followed the recipes pretty close. I only used 4 porkchops (4 servings), and I didn't have french-fried onions, so I used 1/2 c. bread crumbs. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery soup.

Whole family ate!  Used cream of mushroom soup and added green beans on the bottom.  Next time I'll put more green beans, as I only put a thin layer and it could use more.

This dish was pretty good. I used a little more cheese than called for and seasoned the chops with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder. Easy and pretty tasty.

I made this for dinner tonight and it became an instant favorite with my son.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written except I added some pepper jack cheese because I had it left over in the fridge.  I also used a little more of the onions both mixed with the potatoes and on top.  I will definitely be making this again and next time will try using cream of mushroom soup and seasoning the chops before browning, as suggested by other reviewers.  This recipe is a keeper and one I would serve to company.

I have made this twice, and my fiance and I both love it.  We can only find hash brown potatoes in a 30 oz bag, so I just use all of the bag, and double the soup and sour cream.  I also use cream of mushroom instead of celery.  I don't use oil for the chops; just season with garlic salt, pepper, and onion powder and cook them in my nonstick skillet.  The nonstick and the little bit of fat from the chops have always kept them from sticking for me.  I think not using the oil makes them more juicy because they don't get that crispy "fried" texture on the outside.

My husband loved this dish.  I prepared as directed, using 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream. I could really taste the celery of the soup and will keep this recipe to try again with cream of mushroom soup instead.  I will also cook longer than suggested as the hashbrowns weren't quite done enough.

I modified this recipe for venision.  Follow the directions of the recipe, except do not brown the venision chops. top the chops with bacon(4-6 pieces)cover and bake.  Uncover the last 5 to 8 minutes, to brown bacon and chops.  Remove Chops and Bacon.  Dice bacon and mix into potato mixture.  It turns out great!  Home made bread, and roasted vegetables, (onion, carrot, celery, button mushrooms, red and green peppers, mixed together) make this an awesome autumn and winter meal.

Since I did not take the hashbrowns out of the freezer early enough to completely defrost, I went ahead and mixed the ingredients into the semi-defrosted potatoes, placed them into the casserole dish and begin baking it while I sauteed the pork chops.  When all the chops were sauteed, I removed the dish from the oven and topped the potatoes with the pork chops and covered it with foil.  Back into the oven it went for 1 hour to ensure the potatoes and chops were fully cooked.  The topping added only a few extra minutes of baking time, and all came out nicely cooked.  Not having any onions, I used 1 package of dry onion soup mix instead.  I must say, that it was quite salty for my taste, so I might use 1/2 package the next time.  Overall, it was good.

I made a few changes, I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and seasoning salt before cooking and I didn't use milk in the potatoes. Extremely tasty and I will definitely make again, It is a heavy dish so I will only make it every now and then.

Nah, I won't make this again.  The only change I made was cream of mushroom soup.  The pork was barely cooked, and the potatoes were hard. Perhaps cooking times were incorrect.

I have been making this for over 20 years, everyone I make this for loves it.  All I have to say is for about the last 3 to 4 years I have been grilling the pork chops instead of cooking them in a frying pan. They turn out much tastier. Give it a try, you'll love it.

This dish would have been a PERFECT meal for children who are picky eaters which is why I am rating it a 4. At first I kept wanting to add more salt, but it was plenty salty. I thought it to be a little bland and eventually broke down & grabbed the Franks Red Hot, for that I rate it a 3. I also thought there were not enough hashbrowns, or they got lost in the creamy sauce. Next time I will lay a bed of pre-cooked/browned hashbrowns w/ sauted onions under the mixed portion, or pre cook/brown them before I add to the creamy sauce to add some texture. I did add double the french fried onions to the top layer, and would recommend you do the same. This dish was definately edible, but didnt knock our socks off like we thought it would.... there is definately room for improvements & your own creativity.

Fairly quick and easy meal. Used lowfat sour cream, cheese & milk instead of regular. Sauteed pork chops (used thin cut boneless) with olive oil, garlic and onions and added everything to dish. Also used baby potato pancakes which did come out a little mushy next time I might use reg potatoes. Overall everyone ate it and was happy. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this dish for my older son and his friend.  His friend had never had a pork chop before.  It was very good, we all liked the taste and cooking this dish was so easy.  The only negative comment was that it is not a dieting dish  :)

Very dense and overly rich potato dish!  Pork chops were not as tender as expected. Would not make this again. I will give it 2 stars as it was quick to prepare.

Hubby loved this one! It was much better than the hashbrown casseroles cooked without meat. I did deglaze the pan to add to sauce, couldn't let those good drippings go to waste. I also used boneless pork chops.

Good dish. I don't know what happened, but I had to cook chops alot longer. They just wouldn't get done in the middle. Plus, I am not a big fan of celery, I may try cream of mushroom soup next time.

Well I screwed it up but it was still a good recipe and one that we will be having again the right way! I didn't thaw out the hashbrowns before adding them so at the end of the cooking time it was still quite cold in the middle. Other than that I followed it exactly and after my added cooking time it was quite good.

This recipe was a little incomplete.  We found that if you didn't cook the chops to almost done first and then put in with the potatoes they didn't cook all the way through.

I'm not sure why this recipe didn't turn out as well for me as it did for most everyone else. The pork chops weren't very tender, and the sauce/potato mixture came out way too soupy. I left the fried onions out--I didn't think it would make a big difference, but maybe it did. The flavor of the dish was good, but it had too much liquid in it. If I made it again, I'd double up the amount of potatoes to absorb some of the liquid.

Husband liked, I did not love it, but it was ok.  Tasted like some old school dish my MIL would make.  Very salty, but very filling and comforting.

I give it four stars only because I read the reviews and added tons more seasons to both the chops and potato mixture, it turned out very well. I also browned the chops beforehand! If you like tasty recipes, make sure you add all the flavor. I used alot  of all three... Tony Chachers, garlic powder, and caynane pepper.

The potatoes were a bit bland, tasted like cream of chicken soup, so I think I'll try cheddar soup next time. The chops were tender and juicy (and I did season them well, per other reviews).

Wasn't a fan of this one.  It might have been better if the recipe had called for cream of mushroom or chicken, but the celery flavor was not good here.  Maybe that is just a personal preference.  Chops were ok, but hashbrowns were a bust with everyone in family.  Thanks anyway

I really liked this, my kids were not too impressed which surprised me.  The potatoes were excellent but the pork chops had little flavor.  I think I will try to marinade or season better next time.

This was merely okay. Potato mixture definitely needs more flavor. I used celery soup, but I should have substituted chicken as other reviewers suggested. Nice to have a one-dish meal, but this one needs some punch.

LOVED IT!  I have made it twice in a week and a half.  The only thing I do different is use Cream of Mushroom instead of the Cream of Celery.  Gives it a richer taste.

This was just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted cream of mushroom for cream of celery.  Both my husband and I found this quite plain.  I like all the ingredients, it just didn't have a flavor that popped.  This would probably be a good base recipe if you adjusted for your taste (I saw some good suggestions from other reviewers), but I don't think I'll be trying it again.  Thanks anyway!

Just so, so. Kind of watery maybe due to the moisture in the hasbrowns.  I will not make again.  The kids only ate it because they were hungry.

Really good!  I seasoned the chops with salt, garlic salt and pepper.  I also added a small, can of drained mushrooms and a can of drained green beans.  I extended the baking time for 10 minutes.

Yummy! Although I changed a few things.  I cooked the chops in a garlic seasoning, used more potatoes, milk and cheese than called for, added minced garlic & onion to the mix, and left out the french fried onions. I made this for the first time for my in-laws and they loved it, if you can please your in-laws you know it's good!!  I will make it again.

I thought this was a very good recipe. But it took a lot longer to cook then the recipe stated. I had to leave it in for an hour and then but the topping on and cook for an additional fifteen minutes.  Next time I make this I think that I will fully cook the porkchops on the stove top and then add them to the potatoes and bake them.  As the pork chops cooked in the oven, they added water to the dish.  Also, the pork was still pink when the time was up because I only browned them on top of the stove. But overall a very good recipe that my family enjoyed.

This was ok. If it was served again i would eat it, but i wouldn't request it.
It needs more flavor.

This was an awesome recipe! This is going into my monthly rotation! I used the shredded hash browns and forgot to thaw them out, but it still turned out great!

This was an easy meal to make and my husband loved it.  I thought it was very good.  I used cubed pork steaks instead of chops and we liked it just fine, but next time i will try chops.

Updated -- The first time I made this great.  Second time, not so great.  Third time, took too long to bake.  Skip the pork chops, add some veggies and make as a side dish.

My Hubby and Son liked this better than I did.  All commented that Cheddar cheese was too overpowering. I spent alot of time reviewing comments in order to "tweek" recipe.  End result....SO-so.  Not sure I would make it again

This recipe was good, nothing more than cheesy potato bake with pork chops on top. The idea is nice-all in one pan. Next time i'd jazz it up a bit with extra onion, maybe some chopped celery and some "rooms", then season the cops with a some spicy spice. Hubby liked it. Would make it again but not every week.

This was very bland...The sour cream sauce added no flavoring to the hash browns. It diffently needs a lot salt and pepper. I won't do this again.

This was very good. The pork chops came out tender and it was surprisingly filling. My husband was uncertain at first when I told him what it was but he loved it after the first bite. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  Pork chops and cream soup just kind of go together.  My husband liked it.  Before this, I was just throwing the chops and soup in the crockpot.  I think we like this better.

I have no idea why this was rated so high...I thought it was terrible...I didn't even bother dishing it out and opted for left over chili. 

The soup mix in the potatoes was entirely overpowering, and the pork was flavorless. Even thought I followed others' suggestions, I will not make again.

I used cheddar cheese soup, and 1/2 can onions in the mix. It was "OK", but can't figure out what the 5 star hype is all about.  Sorry this will not be made again.

We loved this!  I have a very picky 5 year old that I asked when I could make it again.  I did make some changes, though.  I used a 30 oz. bag of cubed hashbrowns, Cream of Mushroom and WAY more cheese.  Next time, I'm going to try the shredded hashbrowns and won't put the onions IN the casserole, just on top.  They added a certain sweetness to the dish that I didn't care for.  This is a great recipe to play with and add different things in it.  I've never tried a recipe from online or anywhere else that I actually liked.  I was getting a little leary of trying new things.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

The pork chops themselves turned out nice and tender but I did season them with salt, pepper, sage, and garlic as I sauted them in the pan.  I also used only 1/4 cup of milk as others suggested and they were creamy enough and not runny.  I used only half the cheese and had to omit the French-fried onions or my kids would not touch it.

Very good recipe. You should definitely season the pork chops when frying them because otherwise they will be very bland. Enjoyed this one.

For some reason my pork chops would not get baked clear through so I ended up having to microwave them.  I think this recipe would be really good in the crockpot.  I think I'll try that next time!

This was a great dish.  I didn't have the soup on hand so I changed it to Cream of Cheddar Cheese.  I did not use the milk. I also sauted the pork chops in some roasted garlic spice.  The slight changes in the recipe still made it great...Thanks.

Not our favorite. Good but won't make again.
