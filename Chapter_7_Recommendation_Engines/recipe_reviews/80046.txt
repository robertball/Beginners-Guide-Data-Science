This is a great recipe, I actually mixed all the ingredients and baked it in a casserole dish.  It turned out great!

My fiance & I enjoyed this omelet.  I would suggest on cutting the tomatoes into smaller pieces.  I used garlic & herb feta cheese.  I also added green onions, which I highly suggest...1/2 regular onion would be delicious too.

Very good.  I sauteed a little onion with some garlic in butter and added it to the tomato mixture.  Tasty!

Very tasty and my family really enjoyed this for breakfast this morning. At first everyone looked at it and said "Spinach?" ewwww. But then after they took their first bite they loved it.

This was so delicious.  I had fresh spinach and vine ripe tomatoes onhand so I just cooked the spinach a bit in the microwave and squeezed out the excess water.  I cut the tomato into small pieces and seeded it.  It was a totaly yummy recipe with just the right amount of seasonings.  I will make this one again!!

Made for my hubby this morning and subbed mushrooms for the grape tomatoes since he doesn't like them, used fresh baby spinach, all egg whites and reduced fat feta cheese. Served with toasted whole wheat sandwich thins. Thanks!

Really good! I just used six eggs and the full amount of veggies and cheese. I did cut back on the salt and added some garlic powder. Next time I won't use any salt at all... it was a little too salty for me. All in all, a good way to get in some veggies.

My egg mixture was very thick so it was more like scrambled eggs instead of an omelet as tilting the pan tech did not work.  I omitted all the salt as I usually do in every recipe and I could not tell that it was missed.  I will definitely serve this again and again.

Pretty tasty.  I added onion and used fresh baby spinach.  It sort of reminded me of Greek spinach pie with some tomatoes thrown in which I guess shouldn't be surprising considering the ingredients!

So good!  I took one reviewer's suggestion and baked this in the oven.  I added some bacon, leeks, and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese on top.  This is delicious, but watch the salt - I think I put 1/2 tsp in the eggs, and half in the feta.  It was a bit much, though everyone still loved it.

Amazing!!! This recipe is delicious and healthy at the same time! I scaled the ingredients down to serve only one and used fresh chopped spinach instead.  I didn't have any grape tomatoes, so I used one small roma tomato instead, diced. I also used one large egg and 1/4 cup egg substitute-- this adds some extra fluffiness to the omelet while keeping the fat and cholesterol content down a bit. It turned out great, and I will be sharing this recipe with everyone! Thank you! :-)

I can never make an omelet right, so I made scrambled eggs with feta...then heated the tomato plus onion in another pan and used it as a topping. Yummy!

This was fabulous! Great flavor and South Beach Diet friendly too. I left out the tomatoes since I don't like them. I loved the flavor the oregano gave this. I'm going to fix this one a lot now that I found it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic! This recipe was full of delicious flavor. The feta cheese mixture tasted great with the spinach. The recipe was big enough for 4 people and looked beautiful when served! Will definitely make again!

It just had far too much spinach -- that seemed to overpower everything else.

Outstanding taste and great for a quick dinner or lunch too! Even my kids liked this! Although many reviewers said it needs onion, I've made it twice without and it's still an excellent taste! Follow the recommendations for salt and feta carefully as it's easy to over-salt this omelet.

I used Eggbeaters with this and it was wonderful. Added minced onion and a few more seasonings plus fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen.

Absolutely delish !!! I also added kalamata olives, garlic, onions, and mushrooms! I didn't have the frozen spinach but had fresh and that was fine as well! I will make this over and over as it is superb on the palette and easy, too!

Really good recipe.  I make this quite a bit.  I actually like fresh chopped spinach in it better as well as chopped tomato.  I might try the carmelized onions as well next time cause it sounds good.

Wow!  The flavor of this omelet was delicious, and I didn't change a thing except to use a basil/tomato feta cheese.  I have never cooked eggs very well, but I would say with these instructions, I made a really great omelet!  Thanks for the recipe -- it will stay in my recipe book.

Finding myself on my own today, I made up a half recipe of this and it was a HUGE portion!  It was also delicious!  I t was a little flat, though and the outside was approaching overdone by the time the inside was done.  Next time I may cross it with an impossible quiche!

Delicious!!  My first omelet came out very ugly, I overcooked it on the bottom, still tasted good, but not picture worthy.  Made the second one and it was beautiful, thank goodness!  Husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed :)

I LOVED this recipe, perfect size meal for breakfast, i felt great after eating and it didn't skip on flavor at all ?? I sliced the tomatoes a little smaller and added a few sliced green pimento stuffed olives on the side, my boyfriend put them inside after cooked and was in love hehe it'll be a regular breakfast for me.

Very good. Used fresh spinach and blended the eggs/spinach in my food processor. Next time I will used half amount of tomatotos and process with 6 eggs instead of 8.  Some onions would have really added to it.

I used fresh spinach and just made a scramble instead of an omlette. We liked it.

This has great flavor but I think it calls for too much spinach.  Making the omelet was a bit awkward due to all the spinach mixed in with the egg.  If I make it again, I will probably use fresh spinach and add it to the omelet at the end, along with the tomatoes and feta.

De-lish!!!! I wasn't too sure about how this would go off with my fiance. I already knew that I love feta cheese but, he's very picky. Well he loved it!!!!! He even suggested some ingredients and sides that he would like to try with it. This is a staple for my home now. Thanks for the recipe!!!!
