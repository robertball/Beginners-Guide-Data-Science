This spaghetti squash casserole if good, but I took it up  a notch the second time I made it by using mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

This Spaghetti Squash casserole was a quick meal to put together.  I was able to do it in one deep frying pan, straight from stove-top to oven.  A flavourful, colourful meal that not only was enjoyed by me, but also my husband. 
I replaced 1/2 cup of Mozzarella with 1/2 cup of Texas seasoned grated cheese.  This added a mild zest to the casserole.  It's versatility will be a welcome addition to our table.

It was great but with cooking the spaghetti squash first it does take time as the receipe states, would still do it again
