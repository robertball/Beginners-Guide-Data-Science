A nice change from our usual eggnog with spiced rum. I used Captain Morgan and Kahlua.

Delicious!  We used vodka instead of rum, like in a real White Russian, and that worked well.

This was a great drink to start the holiday season of 2012! We loved this drink. So tasty and satisfying! I used Captain Morgans spiced rum and Kahlua, so yummy! Thank You recipe group for voting for this wonderful drink!

This drink is very good! Love the addition of the coffee flavored liqueur. Tastes like an eggnog flavored milkshake for adults. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

I like egg nog - but a few sips and I'm good. This is a really fun drink! I used vodka as I don't have spiced rum and it's probably better with the rum. I also like it on ice.

Great recipe. I call it a White Christmaski. For an added treat freeze cubes of butter and drop them in your glass.

This was very good and a taste of the holidays! Since I wanted to make it and only had Bacardi Gold on hand, I went with that and used Kahlua. Need to get some of the spiced rum, and I'm sure it would be even better!
