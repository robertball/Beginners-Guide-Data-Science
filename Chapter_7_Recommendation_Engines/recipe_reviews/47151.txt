This recipe is out-of-this-world. I made it in indivdual mini-bundts to give as gifts. It made 12 mini cakes that are so wonderfully moist and delicious that I am confident they will be a hit with all who receive them. This recipe is a real keeper and thanks Jessica for sharing.

This cake was quite good.  I only used 3 tablespoons of rum and thought that was plenty.  I would suggest poking holes in the cake with a knife in order for the rum topping to seem down into the middle of the cake.  I poured the topping over the cake and it most of the rum flavor was only around the outside edges of the cake.  By making small slits in the cake with a butter knife, the rum flavor would be able to penetrate the middle of the cake as well as the sides.

This is a very moist and tasty pound cake. I added four tablespoons of rum instead of five and it was still very tasty. I served it with a scoop of peppermint ice cream and got WOW'S from everyone!

This was a great and simple recipe. I did not have a bundt pan or pound cake loaf pan, but I was able to make this into a single-layer cake using a 9x13 pyrex pan lined with foil. The rum sauce was awesome and everyone commented on how moist the cake was. I will make this again!

This is the best cake recipe ever!  I've been using it since 2010 and it's a big hit whenever I make it!  It's so moist and spongy.  I don't change a thing on this recipe!  The best thing to do is let the rum sink in overnight before flipping it.  It gives it an even better taste!

Really good recipe! Cake was absolutely delicious, moist, and spongy, and is even better with the little moist layer the booze-sugar liquid provides. I used amaretto for the soaking ingredient. It only sank down about 1 cm though, although company came and had to serve it quickly. I also used ~1.5 tsp "vanilla sugar" instead of extract, bceause they don't have vanilla extract where i live.

I didn't notice until later that this recipe didn't call for salt and it ended up very bland.  Probably ok if you bake with salted butter or with addition of salt.  I did add a little salt to glaze to try and make it up, but this really didn't help

This is probably the best made-from-scratch rum cake I have found.  Much lighter than some and very, very moist.   Am sure the omission of salt in recipe is just a mistake and common sense has to prevail.   Because we like rum I did substitute 1/4 of the water for rum but, again, that is a taste preference.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  I made a few changes, as I like to get a little creative and play around when I cook. I put half brown sugar half white in the cake, just brown sugar in the rum sauce, and only 4 tbsp rum. I think 5 would have made the flavor very strong, and a bit overpowering. I also put some salt in the cake. I didn't measure, but it was probably about 1/2 tsp.
  It was very dense, as pound cake should be, and the rum sauce made it moist, sticky, and delicious. Neither my husband nor I are big cake people, but we both loved it, as it was moist, dense, and full of flavor. The only change I would make in the future would be to make more rum sauce (probably 1.5 recipes) as the bottom half was a bit dry, and I wished it had been a bit more saturated with the sauce. I ended up making more sauce, and it was perfect! I will definitely make again! I used some of it to make a tiramisu-themed ice cream cake, and it was amazing!
