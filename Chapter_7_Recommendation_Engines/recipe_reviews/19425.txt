Great recipe Pat! I wanted to use up the salsa and cheese dip I had left over from the weekend so I thought I'd give it a try. It was also one of the easiest dinners I've cooked in quite some time (hot dogs and fries aside). Everyone loved it and my son insists on having it again. Didn't change a thing - the recipe is fine the way it's written.

This was an awesome recipe!!  I didn't have any onion flakes so I used a little onion salt and it was fine.  The salsa gives it a really fresh flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Very quick and easy recipe - nothing gourmet, but very tasty too.  I too was looking for a recipe for dinner that would have the things I had in the house already (its getting cold in the Midwest and I was not in a mood to shop), and this fit the bill perfectly.  The only change I made was not to ad the green chilies - only because my salsa and Nacho cheese dip were spicy enough (and I didn't have them in the house.)  Will definitely make again.........  Thanks Pat for the recipe!

I was really surprised that I liked this as much as I did. Totally easy, totally simple. I was starving, but didn't feel up to cooking a big meal, so this really hit the spot. I did use a can of Rotel (very well drained) instead of the salsa and green chiles. I only used a couple large dollops of nacho cheese because I find that stuff SO salty and mac & cheese is salty enough already. I think next time I would skip the nacho cheese completely and it would be good. This is a good recipe when you're hungry but not for anything that takes more than 20 minutes! Thanks :)

I cut this in half for just me and the boys. It was okay. Just a little salty.
I smothered mine in Frank's.

It makes a lot of food! I didn't use boxed mac and cheese, just pasta and milk, then added in nacho cheese sauce, tomato sauce, green chilis, and chili beans (to make up for the lost spice since I didn't have salsa).

I used 3/4 jar Queso dip. 1/2 jar mild salsa added to the beef, onions, and pasta. 1/4 teaspoon chili as well. Turned out just a tad spicy but excellent flavor.

My husband and I both liked this dish a lot. I was a little concerned with adding salsa to Mac and Cheese but it made a very unique flavor. I made nacho cheese sauce from this site for the dish and it was a surprisingly nice dinner that even our 11 month old seemed to enjoy. I left out the green chiles so that our son could try this dish, and thought my husband and I could add jalopenos to the top of ours. Honest I thought it tasted better without the jalopenos. My husband loves cheese so he added some shredded chedder to his, but thought that it was nice without. Also I did not hace onion powder so I just chopped half of an onion I had lying in the fridge. It worked well.

I make a similar recipe. Take 2 boxes of mac n cheese and make as usual and add two cans of green chili's and some lil smokies. Layer club crackers in a casserole dish top with cheddar cheese then mac and cheese mixture then more cheese and top with remaining crackers. I tasted this at a holiday party and had to get the recipe to make at home because it was so good and easy to make. Mac and cheese is a quick meal during a busy week and I love recipes  that I can throw together in a hurry but still taste homemade and yummy. Thanks for the recipe i will try it soon.

My husband loved this so much that he asked me to make it a second day in a row.  I am vegetarian, so I substituted soy chorizo for the ground beef.  But, it turned out great.  Thanks!

This is very Hamburger Helper-esque.  In fact, bf thought that is what I made for lunch.  We have a box of HH in the cupboard that a roommate left and the pic is almost exactly the same!  I chose it to use up some nacho cheese sauce, and I completely forgot to add the cheese packets to the mix.  However, I really don't think they are needed--it is very cheesey already from the nacho cheese sauce.  I subbed salsa verde for the green chiles.  It was fine, but not something I would make on a normal basis.  We aren't really HH fans.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad for a quick meal!  I added some garlic powder and cilantro to the recipe, and my husband and I both liked it.

This just tasted too much like nacho dip.  I will just stick with my mac-n-cheese adding a can of Rotel tomatoes to it.
