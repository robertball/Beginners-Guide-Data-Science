I followed the recipe exactly, just using a small pot and making 1/2 recipe. If you like hot chocolate not sweet at all, you will like this. I honestly, was dissapointed with this as is. However, after I took it off of the burner I let 3 large marshmallows from Allrecipes recipe "Spooky Homemade Marshmallows," melt into it and it was perfect. I topped my cup with some lite whipped topping also. If adding marshmallows or other toppings, the sweetness gets balanced fortunately.

I used pure canadian maple syrup in this recipe. Because I am out of honey, I doubled the amount of syrup. I topped this with a dollop of Cool Whip. One of the best hot chocolate recipes I've tried yet. I loved that it wasn't overly sweet and that slight hint of maple. VERY good.

Was a little bitter, and I didn't see any difference  or necessity to add the honey, brown sugar and maple syrup.  I didn't taste that it added anything significant - I still needed to add a couple tablespoons of sugar to take the bitterness of the cocoa out.

Made this for my kids this morning. One of my kids gave it back to me!  As written it was not very sweet at all. I added 3 tsp. of sugar to each cup and still didn't add the sweetness that you typically have with Hot Chocolate. I will try this recipe again but instead of 1/2 teaspoons, I will change it to 1/2 tablespoons.

This recipe was way too bitter. There wasn't enough sugar or sweetener of any kind.

This recipe was good. I used just regular hot chocolate mix instead of the unsweetened stuff. It was delicious! My mom has me make it for her all the time!

We made this this morning and it was delicious! We are a refined sugar-free family so we love finding recipes like this one. We did not uae brown sugar but a full teaspoon of both syrup and honey. We also used cream in the second addition of milk. yum yum.
