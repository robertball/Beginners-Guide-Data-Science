Be sure to make this dressing several hours before mixing it with the arugula.  I found it much better after it sat for a while!  I also think that there is not enough dressing for this amount of greens, so at least double it.  I also missed some salt in the directions.  I dearly love both arugula and cilantro, so for me this is a beautiful salad.  The dressing is all that needs a few tweaks!  Thanks for this dish!

Yum! I added more dressing (2 tblsp of each liquid ingredient) as suggested by other reviewers, and added some diced jicama for crunch. When I tasted it, the nutty flavor of the arugula prompted me to add some sliced almonds for even more crunch! Did I mention I like crunchy foods? This was awesome on the plate with some grilled salmon steaks and brown rice!

Served with marinated flank steak, and mixed together was very tasty. Only rated it a 4 because pepper flakes made dressing way too hot. Will omit next time (although hubby like how hot it was.) Didn't have cilantro on hand, so it was just arugula, but very tasty. Dressing was nice and light otherwise.

Doubled the lemon juice, olive oil and vinegar.  Used serrano honey balsamic vinegar from one of those olive oil and vinegar shops. Gave it a nice kick.

I really loved this salad. Unfortunately, my hubby did not like it....he is still at war with leafy greens :( BUT I LOVED IT so I know I have a new favorite salad for myself for whenever I want to have a different kind of leafy green salad. I omitted the red pepper flakes as I can not eat spicy things and it was perfect! Maybe next time I will add dijon mustard to the dressing to give it a kick without too much heat!
