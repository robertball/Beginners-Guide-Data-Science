Oh my goodness -yikes! We could not finish these. I love all the flavors, but somehow in these patties they end up tasting like old, flacid fish cakes. The texture alone is enough to gross you out. Sorry, maybe these are for someone, but we were very disappointed!

Not Bad. I liked it but didn't love it. A little time intensive for the results. Most of the flavor came from the P-nut butter and the mint, not the burger. It should definitely be tried at least once.

You need to live in a grocery store to make these.  Look at the list of ingredients-it's a mile long!  I modified the recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients and didn't want to spend a hundred dollars on this recipe.  It didn't turn out very well.

The main problem I had with this recipe is, where's the tofu in the instructions? I added it with the bread crumbs and veggie burger crumbles, but that made more than a dozen patties! I'm guessing it was supposed to be either the tofu OR the crumbles, not both. If I had known that going in, I'm sure the flavor would have been more intense. As it was, these were fine, but nothing exciting.
