Delicious! We wanted this as a main dish instead of an appetizer, so upped the amount of mussels to about 3 lbs. We used 1Â½ fennel bulbs, but kept everything else about the same. Wonderful with crusty bread for dipping.

This is an outstanding recipe.  And the roasted Fennel makes the dish...do not skip!  I used diced fresh tomato in place of the cherry tomatoes and my guests were drinking the broth!

We found this quite disappointing. It was a little better after salt had been added but we probably won't make this again without some changes.

So good!! A perfect light dinner with some wine and a loaf of crusty bread. Don't change a thing!
