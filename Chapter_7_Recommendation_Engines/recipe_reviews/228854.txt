Thank you for this recipe.  It's hard to find an all fruit smoothie that doesn't have milk or peanut butter or chocolate or weird ingredients like flax seed.  I used diet sparkling lemonade in place of the orange juice because I'm diabetic.  It was very good and portion sizes were large.

This was delicious!  I was just making one serving for myself, so I modified it slightly.  I used one banana, 1 cup of frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries), and half a cup of pineapple juice.  As I made it, it made a 12 ounce smoothie with 230 calories, 57 carbs, and 36 grams of sugar.

I use fresh frozen fruit and water rather than juice to reduce the amount of sugar.

This was good, but I think next time I'll leave the strawberries out and replace them with more blueberries. The banana was a very nice addition and added needed sweetness.

This is my favorite way to make smoothies. Everyone loves them. I like to stir a teaspoon of bee pollen into the smoothies for a real energy boost and a subtle honey flavor.

It was a solid dairy-free and healthy option. However, I found that the consistency  seemed thick, so I had to drink it with a spoon. I wonder if lessening the frozen berries to 1/2 to 3/4 cup each (maybe increasing it as you blend according  to taste) would help? I bet this wold be a fantastic base for frozen Popsicles, might save it to try for that!

I had to omit the banana, so it turned out extra thin.

Is there a low-potassium replacement for banana?

Obviously, one could throw in just about any fruit and make a great smoothie.  I found that this combination was the perfect blend of sweet and sour and needed no added sweetener at all.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are really good and healthy. I'm working on losing weight and eating healthy. I use greek yogurt and frozen mixed fruit about a cup of fruit. This is my quick breakfast.

Delicious! I tried using my immersion blender but I think the frozen fruits were too much for it to handle so I used my large blender. It worked much better. Also used 2% milk, leaving out the pineapple juice to switch it up. Good that way too.

I improvised on the pineapple juice.  I just put water and pineapple chunks in it.  I would've put fewer banana chunks in the recipe.

It was great, I would have liked it a little sweeter,  but seeing as I  just started my diet, and chose this to substitute my breakfast, I  am hoping this can help me curb my sweet tooth.  Really tasty!

Tasty and quick snack for my kids before bedtime. They can make it themselves and it uses fruit that is frozen so it's always on hand. We even added a 1/2 cup orange juice.
