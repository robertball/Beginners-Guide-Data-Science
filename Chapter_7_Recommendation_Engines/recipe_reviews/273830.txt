This was a delicious & healthy salad! I loved how simple it was but still satisfying. 
  My husband was impressed by the meal but especially the dressing. Definitely make your dressing first so the flavors have a chance to meld together.
  There are 2 things I may add or change next time I make the salad. Firstly, add a bit more chicken. Then either add candied pecans or swap the almonds out completely just because they're not my favorite. 
Thanks for a yummy recipe!
