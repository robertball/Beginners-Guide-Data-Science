Absolutely loved this but- I used beef cheeks instead of pork cheeks- will definitely order pork cheeks next time, but definitely need to adjust cooking time for beef cheeks a bit. I also skipped the rosemary (not a fan of rosemary except with lamb) and doubled up on sage. Recipe was easy & the accompanying video is super helpful

Excellent...
Came home from Spain wanting to recreate the pork cheeks, Carrilladas, that I enjoyed in Seville and Granada.  Came very close to what I tasted, but a bit different.  I don't remember it being sweet.  Still, it was delicious.  Will keep looking for the right recipe.  Go with pork...it's so much better than beef.

This dish was delicious , I substituted the pork Checkâ€™s with beef Cheek. Instead of cider  I used  porto and a tiny bit of honey.

I will make it again! I first heard of pork cheeks while in Portugal last month. They are a hidden treasure. I followed the recipe explicitly - even buying fresh herbs! I think the cider I chose was too sweet. My son recommended the drier English style. The other guest comes from a family which ran a pig farm - she knows her pork and she thought it was perfect. I will say I bought the InstantPot and used it.

Unbelievably good. Was told years ago about the flavor of pork cheeks but just now have a local meat distributor that carries them. I tend to keep my recipes nonalcoholic so I substituted general apple cider for the hard apple cider. Would highly recommend this recipe!
