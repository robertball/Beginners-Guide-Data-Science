Oh, yum! these are delicious. I made these for lunch and even the picky eaters in my family said they were "pretty good". Definitely a keeper!

Tasty! I used what I had on hand--dry pesto sauce mix instead of pesto, chickpeas instead of white beans. I also added a few black olives and some lemon pepper.

I made this many times. Something different than the same ole mayo and tuna.
