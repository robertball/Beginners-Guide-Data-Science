This is definately a keeper!  We tried this for a shower at work and it was a hit.  I couldn't get enough of it.  I took someone's advice and added just a little more ginger ale to make it go further.

We used this recipe for our school's "Secret Santa" treats.  The kids and the parents both were regularly coming back for seconds!  I used a frozen strawberry concentrate (usually for mixed drinks) and a two cups of canned pineapple juice instead of the frozen pineapple concentrate.  I left off the sliced oranges, but the punch still made a pretty presentation and was delicious. It was easy to prepare ahead of time by mixing all of the ingredients except the sherbert and ginger ale in a large pitcher.  I made a double batch with the intention of having some later for my own family, but they ended up using it all at the festival!

I made this punch for my Thanksgiving gathering.  It was a HUGE hit!!  I used 1/2 raspberry sherbet.  I couldn't fit all the sherbet into the punch bowl, but it didn't taste like it was lacking.  It was great!!

Thanks Angie for a superb recipe!  Like the others I made a few changes; used sweetened strawberry koolaid, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 liter ginger ale, 1/2 of the 1/2 gallon sherbert. I had to mix this in a big pot first, it would not all fit in my punch bowl. Everyone loved it! I had 16 adults and it made plenty for everyone. The color of the punch was gorgeous too! I shared my recipe with many that night! Thanks!

I made this for a client luncheon at work and it was a hit!  The goal was a non-alcholic alternative to sangria because the event was fiesta-themed.  Based on many people commenting that it was too sweet, I cut out all the sugar and used enough sweeted kool-aid for 3 quarts even though I added the full 4 quarts of water.  I also floated sliced strawberries in the punch bowl and only added 5-6 large scoops of sherbet rather than the whole box.  Everyone LOVED it!  Most guests went back for seconds and one guy had 4 glasses of it.  I plan to use it for home entertaining sometime soon and I will also add rum!

I made this sweet baby for my girlfriends famly. Everyone loved it. I only used one cup of sugar however. I also used orange vanilla sherbert. It really came out great and I was the beverage hero of the evening. I think my girlfriend (Grace) would have married me that Thanksgiving day due to the quality of that punch I made. THANKS GRANDMA'S PUNCH, YOU ROCK!

A good punch but we ended up adding more ginger ale to compensate for the sweetness.  Definitely not as much sugar next time!

I served this punch at a baby shower and every last drop was gone...we also served soda and tea, but no one drank either.  The different blend of juices are so tasty and the sherbet adds a creaminess that makes this punch so much better than any other I have had before.  This is a recipe I am going to use for years to come.

I too didn't use as much sugar as it called for.  Everyone love it, and it didn't last long.  I made it in half batches to make sure it fit in my punch bowl.

I made for a reception at work and several people asked for the recipe.  I took others advice & cut sugar to 1/2 cup.  It does make a large amount, but seems very forgiving with how much ginger ale & sherbet you add. It only took one orange to cover the top of my punch bowl.

I made this for a baby shower and it was gone in a flash, and I got compliments on it.  Taking others advice, I only used 1/2 cup sugar, and I could only fit half of the sherbet in the punch bowl.  I ended up using 2 liters of ginger ale (to make it go further) and skipped the oranges.  This is great punch!!!

We had it on Thanksgiving. I took the advice of not using the full amount of sugar. I used 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 cup of Splenda. Also used diet Ginger Ale to cut down on the sugar. It turned out VERY well, and had it been any sweeter it would have been too much!

Awesome punch.  Everyone at my Christmas party really enjoyed it.  I would make it again.  It was really easy.  I ended up giving the recipe to two other people.

I used strawberry sherbert instead of orange and it was SO pretty, along with the orange slices.  I also ran out of sugar, but one cup was enough!

What a wonderful punch. I made it for my daughter's second birthday party. It was mostly adults, and they thought it was too sweet, so we added more water. I guess next time I will use a bit less sugar, but everyone loved it.

I thought this recipe was just OK, nothing special. It reminded me a great deal of Hawaian Punch, Soda and Sherbet. My hubby really liked it. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was certainly sweet enough.

This was a really great punch.  I served it a shower and everyone loved it.  It makes a lot--I only added one liter of ginger ale.  There was no room in my punch bowl for the other liter.  It still tasted wonderful though!

Made this punch for my daughters birthdayparty. Half the people liked it and the other half didn't care for it. Only used 6 oz pineapple juice, added 6 oz lemon juice and used sweetened fruit powdered mix instead of unsweetened to add 2 1/2 cups sugar which would make it too sweet. My family just loved it. Will make it again.

This punch is tasty and so easy to make.  I served it at my mother's birthday party yesterday, and everyone raved about it.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this for my sons birthday party and it turned out okay.  Some kids drank it but there was alot left over.  It was very sweet & I only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I would maybe try making it again & add only 1 cup of the sugar.

It wasn't as big a hit as I thought it would be. Most people at the baby shower found it way too sweet and I even halved the sorbet. Probably won't make this again.

This recipe was very tasty!! We made it for Christmas and everyone loved it!  We didn't put as much gingerale as it called for to make it creamy.

It was good but not great.  Remember to thaw out the frozen OJ and Pineapple.  It doesn't say to do that and if you don't you end up with big clumps.

I've been making this punch since 2002 and can't believe I haven't rated it!  We've made it year after year for various occasions.  It's one of our favorites!  I leave out the oranges and add only about 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I've never been able to find plain pineapple juice concentrate, so I usually use the pineapple-banana-orange concentrate or something with pineapple in it (whatever is there).  Everyone has always loved it when they come over!  Been using it for seven years now, so it's obviously a keeper in our household.  :)

For those of you looking for a different twist on this recipe, try this--it was excellent!:
*1 env. strawberry koolaid
*1 env. hawaiian punch koolaid
*2/3 c. sugar
*1 12 oz. can pink lemonade
*1 12 oz. can frozen pineapple juice concentrate
*Enough water to make about 3 quarts

Mix all of the above (ahead of time if you wish) and add:

*3-4 liters Fresca
*1/4-1/2 gallon orange sherbet
*sliced orange rounds
*maraschino cherries

It was quite a hit at our party :D

I have to say that my family really enjoyed this punch, even though I had to make a few changes. I couldn't find strawberry drink mix so used cherry, substituted Orange-Pineapple-Banana concentrate for the pineapple. I also ended up using to full 2-L bottles of ginger ale to stretch the juice mix. I used rainbow sherbet, omitted the oranges, and decreased the sugar to about 1 cup. The results were great. I'll be making this punch in various flavors for all of my future parties.

I used this for an AVON Holiday Open House and substituted raspberry sherbert instead of orange.  It was delicious and I received many compliments on this tasty punch.  Don't you just love this site?  Judy

I served this at a baby shower and everyone loved it.  I followed some of the other reviews and used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 2 liters of ginger ale.  I think next time I will use 1 liter of ginger ale instead.  I think 2 liters diluted the other flavors a little too much.

I made this at my church to celebrate the end of the year of Sunday school. I replaced the strawberry powdered drink and sugar with cranberry juice. I find the sherbet flavor could be ANY flavor of sherbet. I also added an ice ring and put orange slices in the ice ring. If cranberries had been available I would have put them in the ice ring too. This was popular with people of all ages coming back for more. I freely added more juice and soda as it ran low, to make more.

Made it for NYE. Directions forget to mention what to do with the orange slices, so we decided to add them to each cup for “decoration”. Tasted great!

This was really good- but insanely sweet. So I didn't put the strawberry powder packets and put strawberry juice instead, and omitted the sugar all together. I added more ginger ale and I actually forgot to add the OJ- but it was really good and the whole batch was gone in a couple hours! I will definitely make this again!
