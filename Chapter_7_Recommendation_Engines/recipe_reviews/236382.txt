I was happy to find this recipe because I was able to use some leftovers from other dishes to complete this meal.  I had some Bacon-Bleu Cheese Balls from this site left over from the other day, and I felt that was close enough to make this recipe using that.  Without the bacon in the cheese ball I'm not sure there would have been enough flavor in this dish as written.  Even then it needed some salt and pepper added to it, and I even sprinkled a little of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (an herb mixture) on the chicken.  As I cooked it according to the recipe, this turned out very nicely with those additions.  I also had some leftover rice/vermicelli mixture from the other day (SHORECOOK's A Homemade San Francisco Treat from this site) to use.  So we were totally happy with this dinner tonight.  Thank you, Elizabeth Saben!

This recipe was pretty easy to make, but it was a mess to eat. The cream cheese overpowered the blue cheese, though. I love blue cheese so unfortunately I won't be making it again. Overall, not terrible, but not great.

Baked at 350 degrees at 35 minutes and still pretty raw.

I followed the recipe to a Tee for part of it.
The only change I made was to some of the bread crumbs. I added Old Bay to some and Franks Red hot POWDER to some. All 3 breadings were great.
I also made some with boneless thighs as well.
This is definitely a keeper in my book.

I added garlic to the cream cheese and bleu cheese along with some cayenne pepper for some kick .  I drizzled buffalo  wing sauce  on the top which was amazing.  Lastly I used Panko crumbs which made it very light and crispy when put  under the broiler the last couple minutes.

This is one of my favorites! I also add chopped Spanish olives to the cream cheese.

I actually really liked this recipe! I made some changes and added my own flare, however. I marinated the chicken in honey, soy sauce, and seasonings, while I made the bread crumbs. Also, I added ranch dressing to dip after it was done cooking.
