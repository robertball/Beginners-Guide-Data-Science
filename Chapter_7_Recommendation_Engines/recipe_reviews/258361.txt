Made as written. Delicious!  The mixture was too wet to form patties so I put scoops of it into the heated pan and let them form as they cooked.  The resulting patties were pretty soft, which didn't bother me but if you want them firmer maybe cut the lemon juice, or increase the bread crumbs, or some other tweak to manage the moisture.  The flavor was great!

I made these fresh wild caught salmon patties tonight. A huge success and I’m not a fish lover. Mixed and chopped earlier and put mix in refrigerator.  Scoop out and put in oiled pan. A little to wet to form patties. Cooks well and holds its shape. The sauce was WAY too salty. I’d cut the salt down to just 1/4 tsp. 1 tsp. Is too much. Otherwise delicious!

Made exactly as written and these turned out perfect! I chose to lose the bread as the recipe submitter mentioned because I don't care much for bread and there was plenty with the crumbs. There is a lot going on with these but it all comes together very nicely. My favorite part was that the ingredient list just called for chopped bell pepper and didn't get all specific on which color to use. My opinion has always been to use whichever color you prefer or whichever you already have on hand. I used orange because, well that was what I already had on hand. These take a little time to prepare but are totally worth it in the end. Thanks for the great recipe!
