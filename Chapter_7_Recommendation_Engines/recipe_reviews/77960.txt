I've done this before, while camping with Girl Scouts. We cooked it for 3 hours, and it turned out perfectly. We also added whole potatoes,and unshucked corn to the coals on the top of the garbage can. This is a great idea for camping, but probably too much trouble for home.

This was so easy and so juicy.  I will not try any other recipe.
