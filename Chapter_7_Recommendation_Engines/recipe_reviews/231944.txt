November Faceless Frenzy 2013 - This is like a baked macaroni and cheese with meat. It bakes up quite firm because of the eggs and I believe the noodle choice. We all enjoyed this for dinner and I would like to try it again with a different noodle choice. Maybe angel hair pasta or cut spaghetti. The red pepper flakes were lost in the recipe. If you like 'heat' I would use half mozzarella cheese and half pepper-jack cheese. Good solid recipe with room to play.

It was good. This has a lot of potential. It's definitely a "pie." Almost quiche-like because of the eggs. My problem was that is was a little dry. Maybe 45 mins is too long? Maybe try skipping the de-greasing of the meat in the microwave. I'll try again. Thanks!

Followed recipe but added more cheddar cheese. I forgot to cover it but only cooked for 30 mins. Don't forget to cover it top layer/edges were dry/crunchy noodles. Husband loved this kids and I just thought it was ok. Felt like it needed something else. I may try it again and add saut√©ed onion and garlic.
