I had forgotten that my mother had made these every so often when I was growing up. I was delighted to find this recipe. It's really a very basic cookie recipe. Delicious little gems. Make small cookies and don't overbake, they should be nice and moist. They don't spread out and flatten like chocolate chip cookies. They stay pretty much mounded up.

DO NOT make huge cookies! The cookies spread out too much and were still very very gooey after baking. Also, do not add more pineapple than the recipe calls for or else the cookies will be too wet. Over all, very, very tasty. I will make these again.

These are great! I did add 1/4c of extra flour, I used cranberries instead of raisins and added 1/2c coconut.  I lowered the temp to 325 and increased the time to 12mins.  Excellent!!!!!!!

I tried this recipe with a couple of changes.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and macadamai nuts instead of walnuts.  They were so good and a huge hit at the office.  I had to cook them a couple of minutes longer.

These were good~~~very soft cookie. I used white sugar in lieu of brown. I used crushed pineapple that was unsweetened, perhaps sweeten would be better? My only complaint is perhaps they were not sweet enough...

These were such a dissapointment.  I stayed true to the recipe and the cookies were not what I was looking for.

Without frosting - plain doughy with a little of sweet pineapple and crunch from the nuts. 

With pineapple frosting (3 tbs pineapple juice and 1.5 cups of powdered sugar) - sweet"10"!

I agree with others, will add more pineapple next time then maybe not frosting.

These were ok, kind of bland.  I omitted the raisons bc I didn't have any.  I dripped some of the juice into the dough to help it with flavor, and that didn't really.  I made two batches, the second I rolled the dough balls in some cinnamon-vanilla-sugar (that I use in all desserts, yum!) and they came out better.  I am new to baking and wonder how people make cookies taste sweet?  Don't get me wrong, though, these were good!  Just not, "omg I must eat all of these right now", which is what I was hoping for.

I made these cookies last week when we were snowed under.  They are very good and I'm going to make them again tonight.  My only addition is salt!!  It needs about a 1/2 teaspoon of it.  When I was making them I did not follow my mind that said, "Where is the salt? All baking recipes have some..."  Needless to say I will add 1/2 teaspoon to my next batch and use more pineapple.  Also I will not allow the pineapple to drain so thoroughly.  Thanks to all the reviewers  who cautioned against making these too large. I love the addition of raisins and nuts (I used walnuts).  This is a keeper for me and it comes together quickly.

These didn't come out as I was expecting at all, and they didn't store well either. Overall, it tasted more like biscuits than cookies.

Made these following the directions exactly and was very disappointed.   They were soft and moist but bland with no taste of the pineapple at all.

Great recipe!  I did; however, make a few changes.  Since I did not have crushed pineapples, I pureed a cup of chunky pineapples and added an additonal 1/2 cup of flour.  Cranberries were substituted for raisins.  Since other reviewers described the cookies as being cake like, I baked the batter in mini and regular muffin pans. Because my husband is a big fan of coconut, I added 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes to the second half the batter. They were moist and delicious!!!!

I didn't realize the cookie would be so "cakey".  They are actually quite addictive, though they weren't what I expected.

Delicious and easy! I halved the sugar by half, used a combination of applesauce and butter, and replaced whole wheat for white in the flour to make these cookies healthier. They turned out great and were gobbled right up!

These were extremely disappointing. The texture is bread-like and there's absolutely no sweetness.  When I bake a cookie I want it to be rich and chewy with a little crispness on the edges.  These were worse than sub-par and just do not cut it.
