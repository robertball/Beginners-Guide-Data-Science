I planted thornless blackberries a couple of years ago and now have a bumper crop.  I tried this recipe and it was good, but way too sweet.  I think the problem was that my fresh-picked berries were sweeter than fresh berries that can be purchased.  I picked the ripest berries and they were so soft that they turned to mush as I picked them, which could not hold up to shipping or even sales at a farmer's market.  Anyway, I should have reduced the amount of Splenda but made this cobbler as specified.  Since my berries were already very sweet, they probably didn't need very much Splenda.  I'll make it again soon and try it with much less Splenda.  Since few people would have access to such ripe blackberries, this is probably not a problem for most.  The dough part came out perfect.  I used the stick version of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" which is recommended for baking and it worked fine.

Just went berry picking at our favorite local or hard the other day and picked blackberries especially for my Dad.  Usually I would make a fruit crisp for dessert, but Dad had his stomach set on cobbler.  My folks are on Diabetic low sodium/ low potassium diets and I Eat Right 4 My Blood Type, also due to multiple health issues.  This recipe was day to adapt to our dietary requirements since it already called for Splenda and didn't require much flour.  I only substituted white rice  and spelt flours for the all-purpose in this recipe, and omitted the salt!  Next time I will use a tsp for dropping the dough and our smaller skillet, As I erred on the side of caution with a tbslp and deep skillet.  My folks were very pleased when I made this dessert for them on Grandparents Day, as it reminded us all of our own!

I did cut down the Splenda by about 1/3 and it came out great. My diabetic husband was thrilled with this. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this cobbler twice with rave reviews and never any leftovers! Definitely one of my favorites...I love the way it cooks in the cast iron skillet and the doughy-crust is delicious!

Excellent result - I hadn't used Splenda for cooking before and was hesitant to use the full amount with the fruit - so cut it to a half cup (personal preference for tart berries) - otherwise followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I used the food processor rather than cutting in the butter and the batter topping turned out perfectly. Served warm without any adornments of ice cream etc. and we were practically licking the bowls. I would serve this to company - with vanilla ice cream to make it an over-the-top taste treat.

Excellent recipe but not really what I'd call a cobbler since there's dumplings on top.  Still, we enjoyed it.
