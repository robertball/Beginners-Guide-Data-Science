Made as written as far as the ingredients go but I did let this marinate for a couple of hours instead of only 20 minutes. This grilled up super nice. It was so tender than you didn't even need a knife to cut it. This one is a keeper!

Easy and delicious! Our Publix didn't have japanese plum wine so I used plum sauce not sure how much of a difference that made. It was tasty anyway!
