Pleasantly surprized. I used half ketchup, half barbeque sauce (I didn't have quite enough ketchup on hand--my mistake). I sauteed the pork chops (lightly dusted with salt in pepper) in a little evoo/butter. After I'd browned them all, I added the garlic (a little more than asked for) and half a sliced sweet onion. After I sauteed the onion and garlic, I added in the rest of the "sauce" ingredients. I let that simmer, then added the chops and the pork chops chill out in the sauce over low heat until dinner. I served this over buttered rice with a side of garlic green beans. We really liked it, I was quite surprized.

My entire family enjoyed this dish.  I used thick cut boneless pork loin chops.  I browned them in the pan, then added the sauce and simmered everything, with the lid on, for 25 minutes.  I then removed the top and simmered 10 more minutes to thicken the sauce.  (They were really thick chops!) For the first time in a while my husband didn't complain the pork was too dry!

This is a very tasty dish.  I have grilled, broiled and will try frying the meat and then continue the recipe.  It is quick, flavorful and the chops remain moist.  I usually make the full recipe, with the sauce you can reheat.

Very good, very easy. I used a ziploc to mix the sauce and then cut a corner to glaze the pork. I also used a pork loin instead of chops and it was very good.

We grilled this and used a pork tenderloin instead of pork chops.  I scaled the recipe to two servings as our tenderloin was small.  I assembled the sauce early in the afternoon and just let it sit at room temperature until we were ready to grill.  I re-heated it and gave Hubs some to use as a basting sauce, and I served the rest drizzled over the top when plating.  I was pleasantly surprised with this.  It was delicious!  The flavors blended nicely and didn’t dominate the pork, but enhanced its flavor.  This is so easy to put together, we’ll be repeating this one for sure!

I have been using this recipe for over a year now.  I have a special collection of recipes that I call my "man pleaser recipes".  This one is close to the top according to my husband, son, and son-in-law.  You single gals should try this one out.  I'm just saying....

Very easy, very tasty. I grilled the pork chops instead of broiling, and everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this with a 1b. of pork loin and baked in oven for 1 hour. It was good but i would save some sauce for next time for dipping.

This was a very tasty, and easy recipe. It was a great way to liven up a pork dish. I often find myself cooking the same things because they are familiar, but this recipe was very tasty, easy and will become a new favorite.

My only comment is to watch the cooking process. I broiled per the cooking recommendations and the meat was a little overdone (the only reason I have it a 4 and not a 5 star. If you are familiar with your oven/cooking method, believe that over the times given).

I am looking forward to making this more this winter, and I am especially looking forward to using it in the summer for grilling. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.

Very good and easy to make.  Not a recipe to die for but definitely a reliable, basic recipe (and still yummy) that everyone should have in their repertoire.

The first time I made this, I was a little worried because the aroma of the steak sauce seemed really strong.  However, the end result turns out more subtle than expected.  Very easy.  I've made it several times now, with the only change being to add a light sprinkle of salt before putting the chops under the broiler in the beginning.  Unfortunately, my picture didn't come out so great.. but we love this recipe!

The recipe was not as good as I expected.  I like a little more tang to a glaze.  I over all thought it had a good flavor but no enough kick.

I made this recipe today. It was a lot of work (however, partly because i made 9 chops and only had one pan).  The sauce wasn't all that great as a glaze, but it was very good when applied afterwords (almost like a dip).

This sauce is great!  I sprayed a pan with vegetable oil and brownedthe pork chops.  I also sprinkled on a little Country Bob's Seasoning Salt.  I cooked the sauce in a separate pan.  I probably could have cut that in half.  After the chops were brown, I poured half the sauce in the pan, turned the pork chops so they were covered with sauce, put the top on and cooked it for 25-30 min.  I took the top off the pan the last 5 minutes.  Very good!  Everyone in the family loved them.

The family loved it.  Broiling it kept the meat moist.  Keep a close eye to avoid overcooking it.
