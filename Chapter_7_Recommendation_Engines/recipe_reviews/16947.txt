I used by KitchenAid Stand Up Mixer and the whole thing took 10 minutes at best to prepare. And, it was delicious!
I would recommend turning the oven down just a hair and cooking it for a little longer. I've made this now a couple of times and sometimes the outside seems done, but the inside is doughy. Longer cook time; lower heat. Great recipe!

I didn't rate this recipe as high as "Irresistible Irish Soda bread" simply because there was some kneading involved which was just a bit more difficult than pouring a batter.  However, I LOVED this bread recipe. It had a very flaky crust and was so delicious.  I will definitely keep this one around.

Yummy!  I substituted 1 c. of whole wheat flour for 1 c. of the all-purpose, used butter instead of margarine, AND flattened the ball of dough a bit before baking.  It turned out great -- we all loved it and I will be making it often!  (Oh, and you probably don't need all that butter and milk to brush on top - a couple of tablespoons would be plenty.)

This is the best soda bread I've ever had.  Even better than our beloved local Irish pub.  I basted it about 5 times during baking, and each time I sprinkled a little sugar on top too!  It was moist and just sweet enough.  It even tasted better the next day straight out of the refrigerator! ***Update*** I made this again for St. Pat's and decided to add a touch more salt, 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 and I added a touch more buttermilk to get it a little more moist.  I baked it at 340 degrees for 50 minutes basting it 3 times and each time I sprinkled sugar all over the top again.  It was perfect and everyone raved about it!  The crust was crunchy and sugary and the inside was moist and sweet!  *Update #2*  Use Kerrygold Irish butter in place of the margarine if you can find it, it's fantastic!!!  Really puts it over the top.

Great recipe.  Takes little time to make and was delicious.  I added raisins to a loaf and it went fast.  Wish I had added raisins to both loaves that I made.  Going to make it again for Easter.  My daughter can't wait.  Does dry out quickly after slicing but makes great toast the next morning.

I made this bread today for our St. Patrick's Day celebration.  Wow!  It is awesome!  It's crunchy on the outside and moist and sweet on the inside. It tastes fabulous.  Our guests loved it too. I highly recommend it and plan on making it often.  Brushing the butter and buttermilk mixture a few times while baking really added a great crust.  Bon Appetite!

The recipe name says it all - really easy.  And really good.  1/2 of the loaf is already gone this evening, and the 2nd loaf is in the oven.  Wanted an easy Irish Soda Bread to take into work for St.Patrick's Day, and this was it!  It's not dry like some recipes are. I cut the softened margarine in with 2 knives and then a pastry cutter, as this was not explained in directions. I added 1/2 cup of raisins in while kneading the dough. Amazingly good.

Even though the texture is a little different than true Irish Soda bread the taste is very close. My Irish grandmother won't give up her recipe to her famous soda bread but this will do in the mean time. Very easy to put together.

This isn't a perfect Irish Soda Bread, as it contains egg, but I PROMISE you that your family will love it. I take care to frequently "baste" it with the milk/butter wash, and I prefer to bake it on a pizza stone. If you don't own one, GET ONE. You can get a good one for under twenty dollars, and you will be amazed at how wonderful some of your favorite baked goods turn out - they will seem so much more "professional". Also, I like to coat the very bottom of the loaf in a bit of cornmeal - helps to keep the loaf from sticking and burning.

This recipe is so easy & good with honey butter. The secret to cooking it is to cook it as it says but when you take it out of the oven you wrap it in a dishcloth immediately & the centre will finish cooking. I also use a cast-iron pan to cook it in. My mother-in-law learned this from her Irish mother-in-law & passed it on to me.

This is not a good bread for those trying to limit their carbohydrates because it’s so good you’ll be tempted to make a little piggy of yourself.  I made a half recipe which turned out a beautiful little golden loaf.  (For 1/2 egg I simply beat an egg lightly, then measured out 2 T.)  I suppose it’s not traditional, but I added dill weed – because I love it. And was that ever good!  I’ll bet other herbs would be great additions as well.  I did brush the loaf with the buttermilk-butter mixture once, just before it went into the oven, but that’s a step that could easily be skipped in my view.  I noticed the tips where I scored the bread were getting brown before the rest of the loaf, so I simply covered them with tiny pieces of aluminum foil – worked great!  My little loaf was done in about 40 minutes.

Very Good...Very Authentic. I like raisins in my Soda Bread so I added about 1 1/2 cups of golden raisins. I let the raisins soak in the buttermilk for about 15 minutes then added the buttermilk/raisins to the recipe when called for. Also, I baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees to prevent over-browning of the bread.

My husband is from Ireland, so I was looking for a great Irish soda bread recipe for a traditional Irish dinner.  I chose this one for my 1st try because they DON'T traditionally add rasins/currants or caraway seeds.  He LOVED it and even said it was better than his grandmother's!  I did use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, Smart Balance butter instead of margarine, and kneaded it in the big bowl I mixed it in.  I think the key is brushing the loaf in the oven with the buttermilk/butter mixture several times.  For my oven, I baked it at 325 degrees for 65 minutes (mine cooks about 25 degrees hot).  It is supposed to have a pretty hard crust and be fairly dry - my husband always ate his with strawberry preserves.  Cover with aluminum foil if it starts to get too brown.  To serve, cut loaf into 4 quarters (or in half) and then cut each quarter (or half) into slices.  I may try using brown sugar next time to make it even MORE authentic!

Very easy and that's what I wanted for my first attempt at Irish Soda Bread.  I added a couple more tablespoons of sugar, 1 c. of raisins and 2 Tbsp. of caraway seeds.  I followed others advice and baked it at 350 for an hour.  It's very dense and biscuit like.  Overall, pretty good.

This is a very good and authentic tasting bread recipe. Even though it tastes a little biscuit-like to me, my Irish mother completely approved and reminded her of the old country. I like to make buttermilk pancakes and then make this bread with the leftover buttermilk.  UPDATE. I made it again, but I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat for AP. Still came out great. I also split the dough into two balls so that it will cook more evenly and I can freeze or give away a whole loaf to someone else.

Great recipe! The only changes that I made were to use milk and lemon juice, in place of the buttermilk (1 T. to milk, to make a cup), added raisins and caraway seeds, kneaded for two minutes with my Kitchen Aid and divided the dough into fourths. I wanted to have something to put on my mother's dinner table (she is in assisted living) for her and her three dinner partners, for St. Patrick's Day.I just took the four sections of dough, patted them into round loaves, followed the baking instructions, brushing with the egg and milk mixture again, halfway thru,and baking for 30 minutes. They came out perfectly. I took bread bags (cellophane), added some shamrock stickers and will place them on each of their butter plates tomorrow (as this is March 16th). I am sure they will really enjoy having their very own loaf of Irish Soda Bread.

When I used to think of soda bread, I think bland, dense, not very good. However, to be festive I decided to try making it myself. I cook a lot, and this is one of my favorite recipes I've found. Wow! So moist, and slightly sweet. I did add some raisins, and I basted the bread liberally every 15 minutes with the buttermilk mixture (I used it all). I will be making another loaf on St. Patricks Day. Thank you, thank you, for sharing. I will not try another soda bread recipe because I can't believe any could be better.

YUM! Came out great, though I did make a few adjustments to suit my tastes: 1) Buttermilk isn't necessary. I used 1% milk mixed with vinegar. 2) I used regular unsalted butter instead of margarine. 3) I did not brush loaf with the buttermilk mixture. Instead I brushed egg wash on it to give it a thick, shiny, thick crust. The inside turned out incredibly moist. For the second batch I added more sugar with some cinnamon and sprinkled the top with more sugar. Not traditional Irish Soda Bread but it satisfied my sweet tooth!

My family loves this recipe! I've made it every other week for almost a year... by constant request. It does brown on the outside before cooking on the inside so be careful to coat with mixture or you can lower the heat and cook a little longer as suggested by one reviewer.   I've made some variations to suit our tastes: I always use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 4Tbsp. That said our favorite variations are to make no changes but to add 1Tbsp Almond extract and 1/2 cup Crasins! We also do a Cinnimon and Rasins w/Vanilla extract, and I've done a very good rasins and cardamom. Love this MP Welty! Thank You!

Love this recipe. I added an extra tablespoon of sugar. Made my own buttermilk to save money { 1 cup of milk plus 1 tablespoon of lemon juice you can use vinegar}. Added a little extra butter. This was the best Soda Bread I've eaten in a long time

Well, the concensus on this bread was that it was very, very good.  It does taste like biscuit, but that's what to expect from a bread without no-yeast.  There are two things missing from this recipe that we feel are essential:  1/2 cup of raisins (which I added) and 1.5 teaspoons of caraway seeds (which everyone reminded me that I didn't, but should have).  I flattened the ball as one reviewer suggested and cut a big X on top and it came out looking beautiful ... heavy, but beautiful. It is BEST lightly toasted with jelly or preserves, but great as is.  Thanks MP.

I was looking for recipes to use up the buttermilk I'd bought for another recipe, and stumbled on this.  It turned out so yummy, and was so easy!  I am learning to cook for myself and was totally proud of the results.  Easy and delicious!

Mmmmmm!!!  This was very good, and so easy to make.  The only changes I made was I kneaded the dough right in the bowl, and about half way through the cooking time, I lowered the temperature to 350 as another reviewer suggested and cooked it a bit longer than the recipe said.  It looked perfect on the outside and was cooked in the middle.  I've never had soda bread before, but it was like an enormous buttermilk biscuit!  I think next time I might make a bunch of little ones becuse they'll cook faster.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious moist bread that both makes a beautiful presentation and is so good.  I added golden raisins to the dough and patted it out to an 8 1/2" round, baking it on floured parchment paper for a total of 40",lowering the oven temp the last 5-10 minutes.  I basted it several times during the baking, and my only suggestion would be to keep the pan of butter/buttermilk on a warm part of the stove to keep it from congealing. Definitely a keeper that I'll be making again for Easter.  Addendum:  I should add that after reading some reviews that said the middle of the bread was not quite done, I cut my cross very deep into the bread.  This allowed it to bake in 40", and altho it raised beautifully, it came out without the point in the middle.  The bread came out scored equally into 4 parts which could have easily been cut or even pulled apart into 4 very large scones (or individual breads).  I sliced each section individually with no problem.

This recipe lives up to all the hype! Really crusty on the outside and moist on the inside. I tried the lower temp (I cooked it at 350) and it came out perfect. A small note for non-bakers: this dough is really crumbly looking until you knead it. It freaked me out at first and I even added 1/4 cup buttermilk, but in the end it worked fine. Great recipe!

Easy, you bet ya! Traditional Irish Soda bread- not even close (I lived there). But, I wanted something to serve with dinner. As I was making this in the KA, I'm thinking, gosh this is familiar, and then it hits me- this is almost, so very close to my scone recipe! Ha, I have a giant scone in the oven as I type!!!! No wonder everyone is serving it with whipped butter and such. I'm sure the family will love it-

Excellent recipe. Not only was it easy to make, but it's delicious as well. I added about a cup of raisins and sprinkled some sugar on top of the loaf for a little extra crunch and sweetness after brushing it with the butter/buttermilk mixture and my family absolutely loved it! Will definitely make again! :D

LOVED IT! Was easy and amazing! My husband, who's picky (and right off the boat from Dublin), loved it! The first loaf I added raisins to, and the second loaf I made without.  It was GREAT both ways.  The raisin loaf needed to bake longer than the second.  By about 15 min.  Raisins=1 hour and Plain=45 min.  Brushing it with the buttermilk and butter was excellent.  I would caution to only do so about 3 times tho.  However, you will need more than a couple tablespoons.  ENJOY! We sure did!

I baked this today to test it for St. Patrick's day.  As many of the other reviewers have suggested, I lowered the temperature to 350, used butter instead of margarine, and basted the loaf with the butter/buttermilk mixture every 15 minutes.  A TOTAL success, slightly sweet, crusty and moist inside.  Great with butter!

Best soda bread I've tried! Has a lovely, slightly sweet buttery flavor and is not dry like many recipes. I basted three times with the butter/buttermilk mixture. I cut the recipe in half, which took 40 minutes to bake. For buttermilk, I used vinegar and milk :) Thanks for a great recipe! Update 12/2014: Made this again and used yogurt instead of buttermilk...had no issues but using it for the topping looked...not quite as nice :)

At last, an excellent soda bread in print. This is my mother's recipe which I have made for years. It is the only bread I really remember growing up in Ulster. For our tastes it is absolutely the best and it also keeps more than a day.  Can't believe some reviewers thought this was time consuming to make - remember it does not require muck kneading - only enough to make it smooth.  
Too much handling will make it heavy and tough.

Finally succeeded in making bread! The first time I followed this, the bread was great except for an unfortunate raw spot in the top that just wouldn't cook away. After reading a few reviews, this was what I did. Followed the recipe, except I made buttermilk from milk and lemon juice. Combined all ingredients, kneaded in a large handful of raisins, and set on a floured pizza stone. Cooked at 350 degrees for an hour, took it out half an hour in and braised with milk and butter and returned it to the oven for the remaining half hour. After it hour was up, I took it out and immediately wrapped it in foil and a dish towel in room temperature, until it cooled. It cooked completely through and is moist, fluffy, and delicious. Win!

Delicious! Very moist, airy and tasty. I was skeptical since most breads require yeast. I did make a few small changes. I omitted the buttermilk and used 1/2 cup low fat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup 2% milk. (Many reviews stated the bread was dry, and I think mine wasn't because of the yogurt.) I also let it sit for about 15 mins before baking to let the ingredients rest (think that's why mine was airy and not too dense). I baked it at 350 for 55 mins. Came out perfect! Next time I might even used less sugar. (I was nicely sweet but would be good less sweet too.)

Yummy!  This is delicious.  Not like typical soda bread, but I think that's what I liked so much about it!  Very easy to make.  I used butter instead of margarine.  It's very good toasted too.  As suggested by another reviewer, I used the dough hook on my KitchenAid and it was very quick to mix.  I will definitely make again.

While this is a very tasty recipe.  I do have a couple corrections. The following quote is from the society for preservation of IRISH soda bread.  "If your "soda bread" has raisins in it, it's not "soda bread," it's called "Spotted Dog" or "Railway Cake"!

If it contains raisins, eggs, baking powder, sugar or shortening, it's called "cake", not "bread."

Classic, true Irish Soda Bread consists of ONLY,  1-flour, 2- baking soda, 3- salt, 4-buttermilk 5-butter (small bit depending on your climate)and 6- Love. 

Now that is said, I will repeat, this IS a very, very tasty recipe, which I had to try for  my own curiosity.

Bread had a biscuit texture. Rich and good--my company enjoyed it. I basted the bread 3-4 times through baking, but that may have lowered the temperature of the bread in baking too much because I ended up with a small doughy part in the middle of the bread even though the outside was well done.

Never made or even tried soda bread before, so I had no idea what to expect.  The end result was like a scone on steroids.  More of a biscuit-like texture than bread.  Just a hint of sweetness.  Not sure if that's the way it's suppose to be, but we kind of liked what we got.  I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer with the paddle for the initial mixing, and the dough hook instead of kneading.  Easiest bread I've ever made.

Truly easy to prepare and tastes wonderful!. I made this for my family quite a few times and have served it with Corned beef and each dish compliments each other. I too used a Kitchen Aid Stand mixer and the preparation was incredibly easy. I would definitely recommender this soda bread recipe to anyone. So simple to make and the taste is great!

Super easy bread to make.  I wasn't sure about it while doing the kneading (it seemed too dry and too moist at the same time), but I went ahead with it and it turned out really good.  The buttermilk/butter mixture on the crust is amazing and gives the crust great crunch and flavor.  I brushed it on twice (once before baking and once in the middle of baking), and I'll make sure to do that part again when I make this recipe again.  Like a previous reviewer said, this makes good toast the next morning!  I served this with a Guinness beef stew recipe (from this site) that was served over mashed potatoes, and the whole meal was a big hit.

The best thing about this bread is the crust.  Others mentioned sprinkling brown sugar over the top when they baste it, and that does make it taste better, but it makes it more of a dessert bread than a dinner bread.  I like to put a few dashes of salt in the baste mixture instead....it goes with the sweet-ish taste of the bread really well and tastes like a nice dinner bread.  This recipe made two large loaves for me, so next time I will half it. I made one loaf and refrigerated the rest for 2 days, and the dough changed.  It was not very good.  I would recommend making whatever amount you need at once and not saving any.

Oh my...this bread is wonderfully tasty and so very simple to make.   It's sort of like a huge pull-a-part baking powder biscuit.   I noted comments regarding the middle being doughy which I didn't want to happen, so I cut the "x" on the top down deeply, about halfway into the middle, and had to increase the baking time to 55 minutes.

Truly a great tasting bread-I used butter instead of margarine and added raisins...easy to prepare. The kneading was done in the mixing bowl and stirring everything together. Hint - after bread cools (if any is left) just wrap and place in frig to curtail some drying out. Great bread that I will make again and again...Thank you.

Flaky with wonderful flavor. If we didnt eat it so fast, I would have taken a pic of it!  Very easy too. I didnt have buttermilk, but used cream and 1 Tb. vinegar as a substitute. Worked wonderfully!

This is really good and easy!  The sugar makes it sweet, i might leave sugar out next time if it's for St. Patty's Day dinner.  I made a substitute for buttermilk by adding 1 T white vinegar to 1 c milk.  I also used the dough hook on my Kitchenaid mixer to do all the work.

Very nice. Husband likes it as well. Tastes exactly like tea biscuits to us. I baked it at 360 for 45 minutes, and basted with the butter and buttermilk mix every 15 minutes. I also used butter instead of margarine.

This was great!  The texture and flavor were lovely.  I kind of wish I'd remembered the comments about the baking time and temperature, though.  Definitely too high and too long for my oven; the crust was starting to blacken by the time the inside passed the toothpick test.  Next time I'll try it at 350, for 45 minutes.

This is a great recipe.  If you prefer a moister bread, substitute one cup of plain yogurt for one of the cups of buttermilk.  I agree that the temp should be turned down to about 360 and back for about 65-70 minutes.

Had to find a recipe for Irish Soda Bread.  Read multiple reviews and decided to go with this one.  Followed it JUST AS WRITTEN.  When cooking, I "basted" it every 15 minutes which also enabled me to keep track of right amount of time when cooking it.  Took just about 40 min in my oven.  LOVE not having to knead the bread or letting it take time to rise.  Made it for hubby's potluck on St. Patrick's Day and got rave reviews.  People wanted the recipe :)  As the bread let the house with him that day, it looked and smell sooo good that I had another loaf going in no time at all for the family!  It is delicious.  On second loaf actually let the dough "set" 30 minutes before putting into the oven to see if it would enable the baking powder/soda to go to work sooner and get more rise - there was absolutely no difference from the loaf that didn't have 30 minutes of sitting time, so SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME and just plop it into the oven.  Tastes great fresh and toasted also

It's a true Irish Soda Bread recipe.  Be prepared to leave yours in the oven longer (mine had to go ten minutes over). 
I have tasted better, though and I will search for a different recipe next time.

This bread was delicious!  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves, and they came out perfectly.  The only changes I made was to use 3 c whole wheat flour, a little less sugar, and butter instead of margarine.  I brushed the loaves with the butter/buttermilk mixture a few times while it was baking, and it made the crust perfect.  I had to add about 5 min of baking time, but other than that the recipe was perfect.

While this recipe has potential, I would not use it again as written.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the result looked like a mutated biscuit that was still half-baked on the inside.

I would like to give this 5 stars, but it was not a total hit with everyone so I took that into account. (Three out of five thought it was awesome.)
I absolutely love this dense, moist, not too sweet bread! I added 1/4 cup raisins and served it with "Beef and Irish Stout Stew" (recipe on this site). It went perfectly with it, and I enjoyed some with breakfast the next morning.
If you are looking for a light airy bread, this is not the recipe for you.

This was great, very different from the Irrestible Irish soda bread recipe (also on this site) which is more cakelike and moist. This soda bread is more like a biscuit and is excellent slathered with butter! Guess it will depend on what I am in the mood for! I did put plenty of moist raisins in it, even my raisin hating daughter enjoyed this!

We love this recipe in my house and I have made it about five times already. It is incredibly easy. The texture is similar to a scone and is delicious toasted with marmalade.  The only change I made is to use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and to add golden raisins that have been soaked in buttermilk.  I add them just before kneading, otherwise it is hard to work them into the dough without over-kneading. It is my son's favorite breakfast!

Used the Kitchenaid mixer. Added one cup of raisens to the recipe. Used butter not margarine. Next time I will separate the dough to make two loaves. That should help the cooking time. Husband approved.

This bread was a hit with my corned beef and cabbage dinner. The guests have left and I gave away most of the left overs. I kept some of the bread for myself and my husband (unless I eat it all). This recipe produces a wonderful crunchy crust. I followed the directions as written. The only slight modification I made was I cut down the wash solution that you brush on the bread before baking to 2T melted butter and 2T butter milk. Just felt that (2T + 2T) a 1/4 cup of the buttery milk solution would be plenty. Had I used the 1/4 cup of each, I'd have tried to brush on a 1/2 cup of liquid. It would have just run off. Then bread is delicious and I will make this again. You won't be disappointed. Thank you MP Welty!

Followed the recipe exactly except I used butter instead of margarine (I don't buy it) and since margarine's water content is a little bit higher, I compensated by adding just a few drops more of buttermilk.  The dough was a little crumbly, then again, maybe only compared to yeast bread. I shaped it into a round and flattened it per other reviewers so that the middle would set, but even baking it longer didn't do an good--the middle was doughy. The crust had a good flavor so I may attempt it next year, but I'll definitely flatten it much, much more--maybe about 2 inches high?

Really good, especially right out of the oven with some butter. I had to substitute fat free yogurt for the buttermilk because that's what I had and I wonder if that wasn't what contributed to a slightly thicker bottom. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and turned the heat down and cooked for almost one hour. It turned out perfectly done.

This is a good recipe, having had awful results in the past with soda bread (soda brick?). The only thing I'd do different next time is add a little bit more buttermilk to the dough. It was somewhat dry and I think I had to knead it way too much to get it to hold together. Otherwise, the taste and texture were very good.

This is a good recipe with just a few changes.  I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup, used butter instead of margarine, beat 1 jumbo egg till frothy and baked it in a greased 9" cast iron skillet.  I basted with the butter/buttermilk mixture only twice (used the remainer for a second loaf)and sprinkled with white cyrstal sugar after each basting. Now the recipe is perfect.

I halved this recipe (used 1 small egg) to make a small loaf of bread for our St. Patrick's day dinner. I brushed the loaf with the butter/buttlermilk mixture every 15 minutes during the baking time. It baked up beautifully and had a nice flavor. Served this with 'Stout Slow Cooker Corned Beef and Veggies' and 'Irish Tea Cake', both from AR.

I made this for our team's Saint Patrick's Day party and everyone said it was delightful! It's crumbly and perfect with cornbeef and cabbage. I can't believe how easy it was to make. I just watched the video a few times and went for it. Definitely something I will make again. Thanks!

Really good bread... but definitely needs butter or jam! Don't forget it when bringing it to a function as I did.   I added cranberries to it also. Pretty good.

I have tried a lot of Irish Soda Bread recipes and found this to be the best yet.  I added currants to the recipe and it was delicious.

This recipe is a little bland as written. The density and texture are great, but I added cinnamon and raisins to it to make it more flavorful since I was serving it for breakfast. If you are pairing it with soup, then it's perfect as is.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and served it with Irish stew. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and made two loaves. I cooked it at 350 for the longer period the other reviewers suggested so that it would be done on the inside. It was fabulous, went well with and in the stew, and got good comments from all. I will save this recipe and make it again.

The Irishmen at our celebration said it was perfectly authentic except for the green colour the hostess insisted I add to the buttermilk.  I weighed out my flour - 4 cups = 500 g but there was still a lot of dry flour left in the bowl.  Do not knead it all in or it will make the bread very tough.  Next time I'll use a little less flour or a touch more buttermilk.

I will start by saying that I made both this recipe and the Irresistable Irish Soda Bread recipe.  Both highly rated and both lived up the hype.  I did add raisins to both as it seemed traditionally correct, having said that I'm no expert on Irish Soda Bread tradition.  I followed the recipes as listed with one exception.  I baked on a tad bit lower heat and baked for a tad bit longer.  Not sure what some posters meant when they said it didn't turn out good.  I'm no baker, but these 2 recipes have to be as easy as it gets.  Gave them both 4 stars as they both came out great.

I made this bread today and it truly was amazing!  I did it in my Kitchen Aid mixer, using the dough hook. I flattened it a little more and, after reading a couple other reviews, decided to lower the baking temp. to 350 and baked it for 50 min. I used 2 Tbsp. each butter and buttermilk to brush on the top; once before baking and again, about 20 minutes into the baking.  It was the best! Moist, flavorful and didn't need any butter on it when serving!  My family LOVED it!

Although I can make tea biscuits that are perfect, this similar recipe did not turn out for me.  :(  The middle did not cook properly and became dense and "gluey".  The outside was almost over cooked and too dark.  It all crumbled when I tried to cut it.  A little disappointed as I used this recipe for dinner when I had company coming.  I'm glad it worked for others, but it just didn't come out like I had hoped.

Yummy! I have another soda bread recipe from here that I usually use but it takes 70 minutes and I only had 45 so I decided to try it. Turned out great! It was a tad dry on the edges (my fault cuz I left it in the oven about 5 minutes after the timer went off). I also forgot to add the butter/milk mixture on top and so I am sure it will be even better next time. I decided to go with a savory bread and so I cut back on the sugar and added a couple of tablespoons of dried dill. Very nice. probably would be great with crushed rosemary also. Still had a slight sweet taste - I maybe would cut the sugar all together unless I wanted to add raisins or something. I also learned my lesson about the "x" on the top - don't cut too deep! Mine seems about as split as most of the pics on here, but l would like it to look a bit less split. I would say cut down maybe only a half inch??? All in all, a great recipe that I will make again.

Great recipe but depends on what you are looking for.  I was trying to find a soda bread recipe to Publix supermarket's (in the south) and this one is pretty close.  In reality this recipe yields a gaint scone, and a good one at that. If you are looking for more of a chewy, crusty bread that can be dipped in stews like a dinner bread this probably isn't what you are looking for.  HOWEVER, if you want something a bit sweeter, crumbly and tender scone-like bread this is a great recipe.

With a couple of small changes this the best soda bread recipe I have tried so far. The only changes I make are butter instead of margarine and less sugar. Great job on this recipe!

Delicious!  I added a cup of raisins, rinsed with hot water, before the milk.  Also added 1 T. lemon juice to milk instead of buttermilk.  Basted w/ half the milk/butter mixture but might not even bother next time.

I am just not sure about this. I followed the recipe exactly and it was the driest, crumbliest dough, very hard to pull together. It was a very heavy dense bread, too. I just was expecting something different I guess! Still, it didn't turn out to be horrible, and it wasn't that bad.

I agree that this came out tasting like a big buttermilk biscuit, but I like biscuits. I have no idea what real Irish soda bread tastes like, but this was certainly yummy. I made one round following the directions to a 'T', and one round with lots of raisins. I recommend adding raisins or something else similar in order to counteract a bit of blandness. Also, while it's good for quite a while, it's best right out of the oven. I had lots of compliments at a St. Patty's day potluck.

This was really good bread, but it was a bit moister and sweeter than the soda bread I've eaten before. It was really good, just not what I was expecting.

What a great recipie !! I used to be afraid to Make soda bread (pretty bad for and Irish woman) this was the first time.! It came out PERFECT!Just like we get from the traditional Irish bakeries here in NY. I was so amamzed. I will be making this one all year long !! I also added Golden raisins thry added a nice hint of sweet. It's even better the next day toasted with butter (real butter) and a good cup of coffee or tea! Try this you'll love it!!! Bravo!!

I'm not sure if this is authentic or not, as I have never had Irish soda bread, but it does taste amazingly like the biscuits at Cooker restaurant which is definately good enough for me! Next time I will try making them in biscuit form, it would probably make about a dozen I think.

Id never made soda bread before and ended up making this recipe. I had baked the irresistible recipe and although good too, the difference is the buttermilk. I like how the crust is crusty with the butter and buttermilk spred over the top. And its a lighter loaf. Its so good with the beef irish stew I made.got lots of compliments, and its going to be our staple for St Paddys day!

Fabulous and easy!  I followed the recipe but added ½ cup raisins and baked for 75 minutes at 350.  Other reviewers were correct in that adding raisins added to the baking time (15 min), as well as baking at 350 rather than 375.  My bread was sufficiently brown on the top after 30 minutes so I covered with foil for the rest of the baking time and it was perfectly brown after 75 minutes.  I basted once before placing in the oven and at 30 minutes.  Also, I am not a raisin fan but they are definitely a huge plus for this bread.  The bread was delicious with the perfect amount of sweetness.  This will be my go-to bread from now on!

Very different from what I expected but delicious and easy. It almost had a cornbread like flavor. My husband even asked if there was cornmeal in it. I did let it sit for 20 min before baking as suggested by another reviewer

This was delicious!  The entire loaf was eaten with dinner tonight.  I basted the loaf with the buttermilk/butter mixture about every 10 minutes or so.  I followed the ideas from several other reviewers and used brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  It went especially well with the homemade raspberry preserves I had.

This soda bread lives up to the Amazing taste and quality.  I've made it three times.  It is quite large so I made two smaller ones.  I did add white raisins.  A friend of mine who is Irish through and through suggested substituting the buttermilk for sour cream.  I took her advice and made a batch.  It was just as delicious.

This is the 2nd soda bread I've tried and this recipe is by far THE BEST of the 2. Very easy to assemble and the taste is WONDERFUL. I added the raisins which to me makes this bread even better. Very good with a little butter and jam. Will be having it alongside our corned beef, cabbage and potatoes for St. patty's Day tomorrow. Can't wait!!

One of my favorite go-to quick breads.  My whole family loves this recipe!!!!!  To deal with our dietary needs, I simply make buttermilk with lemon juice and plain rice mlk.  Also, I use Earth Balance in place of butter and Egg Beaters in place of eggs.  Lastly, because we like a crisp crust, I bake it in a large cast iron skillet.  What a great addition to our meals!!!!

This is a pretty good cake. It has nothing to do with Irish Soda Bread, but it is a nice dessert cake.

This soda bread turned out wonderful. It was my first time making one. I followed the recipe exactly, but cooked it at 350 for about 50 minutes. It wasn't the sweetest bread and actually tasted more like a biscuit but it was SO good!

Very easy, very good.  Not 100% like the stuff I'm used to at our friendly Irish pub, but pretty darn close.  For ease of baking, I am all about this bread!  followed directions exactly and it worked great.  Next time, I will add raisins...

I have just made this delicious bread, the first time I have ever made bread.   My mum used to make it all the time.  I rolled the mixure with my fingers did not knead, rolled it into a ball.  Realised only when I had put all ingredients together that I did not have an egg so left it out.   Used half butter half marg.  Based with butter on top.  Turned down the oven at 30 mins continued to cook until 50 mins was up, checking every five mins.  This bread has turned out way beyond my expectations.  Absolutely delicious and full of gorgeos flavour, a little sweet for me but next time I will put less sugar.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day 2010. I know that the crust is supposed to be, well, crusty, but the inside was relatively dry as well.  Very tasty though.

I am not a good cook & baking anything adds a level of terror to my experience.  This recipe couldn't be easier & left my critics asking for more!  I found that it is way easier to split into 2 loaves or flatten for easier cooking.  When I did a giant loaf it got a little too toasty on the top while waiting for it to cook all the way thru.  Now I always have buttermilk in my fridge!!

Loved this bread!  I substituted 1 c of wheat flour for 1 c of the flour, and only used a few tablespoons of the butter/buttermilk mixture to brush on top.  Also sprinkled some oats on top before baking.  This is a great tasting Irish soda bread.  I tried another recipe first, but it was really bland.  This one is just right!

Great recipe!!  I cooked my bread for about 40 minutes and it came out moist and delicious.  I ended up adding another 1/4 cup of buttermilk to the dough mixture because it wasn't sticky enough.  Other than that it was really good.  We dipped the bread in the Beef and Irish Stout Stew from this site.  I will be making this easy recipe again!

I did not like this at all.  It was dry (even though I managed to undercook it in the middle) & bland.  I have never had Irish Soda Bread before, so maybe I just don't like it & this is a fantastic recipe for those of you that do like Irish Bread.

The only thing I did differently was to halve the recipe.. The taste of the bread is good, but it is really dense and a bit dry. Maybe I baked it too long or mis-measured something. But overall, I liked it and I can get past the dryness if I heat it and spread butter over it!

I just made this today as a test run for St. Patrick's dinner and it is FANTASTIC.  I hate kneading so I used my KitchenAid mixer which made it very simple.  It smelled heavenly while baking (and now my house smells yummy) and was very delicious - not at all dried out like many other traditional Irish soda breads I've tried.  Definitely a hit, my family loved it!

I made this bread today and it was very very good.  Easy, and perfect texture.  I used butter instead of margarine and added raisins as in so many other soda bread recipes. Next time will try adding caraway seeds.  Will make for gifts for my friends for St Paddys Day.

I made this for a St. Patty's Day inspired meal and will now make this every time I get a chance.  This was wonderful.  The bread is dense and a bit crumbly but oh so tasty.  It kinda has the flavor of a big biscuit. I did lower the heat to about 350 and baked for about an hour. The whole family loved it.

Not only was this bread easy to make, but, its was so yummy. I cut the recipe in half, but added a hole egg, and it cooked perfectly. The last 10 minutes I placed foil over the top so it wouldn't burn the top. I baked this is a counter top convection oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. I loved this bread, it was dense and slightly sweet. Thanks!

Delicious, rich, really easy.  So quick coming together.  I prepped this before making Delicious Ham and Potato Soup (off this site), and they finished at the same time.  I wanted a bread to go with my soup; I was out of yeast; I tried this and was delighted.    I subbed 1/2 the flour for white whole wheat.  Will make this again.

Instead of baking soda, I used bi-carb soda, and funnily enough the internet stopped whilst the picture was downloading, so I wasn’t sure how to shape the bread. I ended up using one of the new silicone cake / loaf bakeware from Woolworths.

I used the traditional bake section on the oven, which slowed the fan right down and found that the bread took an hour and a half to cook. I topped the bread twice with the buttermilk and butter mixture. It rose beautifully, and I served it with an Irish Stew. It was the perfect accompaniment.

Super delicious and super easy! I followed another cook's advice and lowered the temp to 360 and baked it for about 48 minutes. Everything else remained just as written and wow was this good soda bread! I added some Israeli raisins (from Whole Foods)and the flavor was incredible. The regular boxed raisins from the grocery store are just too sweet and fake tasting. I mixed it all up in my stand mixer..so quick and easy! I love one-bowl recipes! The loaf came out pretty big so I brought half to work and everyone jumped on it like vultures! Even my Irish-born co-worker said it was delicious and went back for seconds. Definitely a keeper recipe!

good soda bread - the outside is really crusty & crumbly.  I made this twice - 1st time according to recipe and it was too dry and not sweet enough. I did use a convection oven, so this could be part of the reason why it was so dry.  2nd time I added double the amount of sugar & an extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk and it worked out great!  Oh - raisins and/or currents are definitely a must!  I added about 3/4 c raisins.  Overall - keeper, easy recipe.

Great bread. This WAS easy, and made a great addition to our St. Patty's Day feast. I'm sure I will make it again. It had an interesting appearance too, although I'm not sure what it was really supposed to look like, since I've never had soda bread before.

This was so easy, and came out so beautifully!  I made this for my son's first grade class for today's St. Patrick's Day Feast.  I am rating this although I never even had a bite...my son came home from school and RAVED about it, and said "Everyone" loved it at school (teachers and kids alike).  So, based on ease, presentation, and the raves I've gotten via my picky 6 year old, this is a keeper.  I'll make this again, and I'm looking forward to enjoying it myself!

Tastes very good.  The only thing I would suggest is to not make it into a perfect ball, but flatten it a bit, as the middle was under-cooked when I took it out of the oven.

YUM! This was so tasty, like a big, sweet biscuit. I bake a lot, so I mixed the wet together and sifted and added in the dry, as typical, rather than mixing all together then adding buttermilk and egg. I also added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk to ensure the bread would stay moist. It worked out great. I added about 1/2 cup of raisins to be more authentically Irish. :-) I basted the bread with the butter/buttermilk mixture 3 times and also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top each time while it was baking. As per other reviews, I reduced the temp to 340 degrees and it took about an hour or so to bake all the way through.

I like it. It's between a dense cake and bread. A bit sweet if serve with food so I cut down on the sugar a bit. I didn't have buttermilk so I added vinegar to milk. I've made it twice already. Thanks for the recipe.

I'd never made any kind of bread before and gave this a try for St.Patrick's.  Incredibly eady to make.  It is delicious and disappeared very quickly.  On the advice of an Irish woman, I added a touch of vanilla.  That was my only change.  Have been asked by many to share the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and mine did not turn out. This was my first attempt at trying to make Irish Soda Bread.  Mine was heavy and dense, not light and fluffy as some described.  I was disappointed.

Great basic recipe! I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and turned the heat down (to 350) and left the bread in for about 20 minutes longer--a total of 1 hr, 10 minutes--and it's lovely and brown on the outside, but nice and moist and fully baked on the inside. A couple other modifications to be recommended: sub in some whole grain flour (I used 1 c. fresh oat flour, and 1/2 c. fresh whole wheat) and knead in currants if you like them. The butter can be melted and the mixed with the buttermilk-egg mixture to make it easier to add in. Also, if you're short on buttermilk, but have some plain yogurt in the fridge, just mix 1/2 c. yogurt with 1/2 c. milk to substitute for the buttermilk--it works just fine!

Let me state first that I have never eaten Irish Soda Bread, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did use a cup of cranberries instead of raisins. This bread was good, with a slight sweetness, but it was a bit crumbly.

Brilliant!  I cut the sugar in half and made a savoury variation, adding rosemary and pine nuts to the dough.  I then stuffed the X in the top of the loaf with goat cheese before baking.  So good.  But on its own and with the full 4 tbsp of sugar, it's also delicious.  I can't believe how easy it was.  The crust is crisp and buttery and the inside is moist and dense, not crumbly.  I know it will be a staple from now on.  Thanks!

WARNING there was a suggestion to wrap this bread in foil to cool.  NEVER! I  enjoy this primarily for the crunchy crust. steaming in foil will produce a soggy crust, on any bread. if you  wish to wrap it, use a towel, so steam can escape.

This was a pretty good bread. I liked how it was slightly sweet and it had a nice subtle flavor. The crust was very tender, but still a little bit crunchy. However, it was just a little bit dry and crumbly. I started out baking it at 30 minutes, and then I added an extra 10 minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. It's delicious the next day as toast!

First review I've ever written because it's THAT GOOD: This is the best, biscuit-y, scone-y, soda-bread-y loaf EVER! I always make it for St. Patrick's Day, and it's become a year-round favorite too. Easy to make and take a loaf as an impressive hostess gift or as a contribution to a pot-luck. When I don't have buttermilk, I use 1 Tbsp. of lemon juice or vinegar in the bottom of a measuring cup, then fill to the one cup mark with milk and microwave for 15 seconds or so. I also use all butter, and bake at 350 a little longer. This year I'm going to try some whole wheat flour and raisins, but this recipe is wonderful as posted! THANK YOU for posting this recipe MP Welty, we love it!

not bag..really nice if you use half wholemeal and half AP flour...add whole walnuts and almonds when mixing.add 1 tablespoon of almond essence..bake for longer on a lower heat...smother with jam..yummy..

if you want this with dinner leave out almond/walnut and serve with a dublin dish called a coddle..anyone from dublin/ireland will love and remember having coddle when a kid.....great treat for paddy's day coming up..

Nice crusty loaf, with a dense, yet spongy soda bread. I replaced the margarine with butter (as in all my baking) and it turned out fine. I also added dried currants (soaked until soft and drained) and some caraway seeds, which were wonderful! 

I would make this again as it is the best soda bread recipe I've found yet, however I gave it 4/5 stars because I've had better bread elsewhere (personal preference probably).

The taste was pretty good. Paired it with stew, however, was NOT impressed with the ease of making it!! Amazingly easy.... NOT! Could not get it to hold together at all, no matter how much kneading and trying. I think I'll keep looking for an easier recipe to prepare. Thanks anyway!

Dry, bitter.  Didn't like this at all, even with raisins in it.

Great recipe! Tasted like a giant buttermilk biscuit and went well with homemade Irish Lamb stew for St. Paddy's Day. Will definitely make again.

I made a big mistake when making this---I accidentally used half & half instead of buttermilk.  We all loved it (and it was amazingly easy) but stick w/ the buttermilk.  The texture is wonderful.  Will definitely make again.  Perfect accompaniment to stew.

Yummy!  I followed the advice to bake it at a slightly lower temperature.  I baked it at 350 degrees.  I checked it at 30 and 40 minutes and added more of the buttermilk/butter mixture each of those times.  Total baking time was about 45-48 minutes.  We had it for St. Patrick's Day dinner and the kids (ages 6 and 11) both loved it!  I'll save this recipe for sure.

I don't know what the people that rated this recipe low did wrong...but I followed it to the letter and it turned out awesome.  Nice crust with perfect inside.  This is the second year of making this (along with guiness cornbeef from here too) and everyone enjoyed it.  I had my Irish in-laws over and my MIL raved and wanted to know the recipe I used (she also said that they never put raisins in it...for those that suggested that).  I wish I could rate it higher.

I've never made Irish Soda bread so I have nothing to compare this bread to.  It looks and tastes like a giant, dense, biscuit.  I happen to like biscuits so I'm not complaining.  Just not sure if I did something wrong?  I would try this recipe again.

Yummm...I split the dough into two rounds and added raisins to one of the rounds.  I cooked it at 350 for 60 minutes, basting it every 15 minutes with the milk/butter mixture.  This recipe is so easy!

This is an easy bread to make and is quite dense and filling.  I added 1/2 cup raisins to the dough before kneading and only brushed the crust with butter and milk once before baking.  The crust still came out nice and crispy.

I thought this was a very good recipe although I ended up changing a couple of things.  I added about 3 T more buttermilk as it was not sticking together as well as I thought it would.  I baked it at 375 for 30 min then 350 for another 15 based upon other reviews.  Next time I will probably just bake at 350 the whole time.  The buttermilk/butter mixture was way more than needed.  I brushed liberally before baking.  Did cut the X in the top.  When it came out of the oven I basted it again and still had enough for another loaf. My texture was good.  It did taste and bite a lot like a scone.  This bread would even be good as a base for a strawberry shortcake.  Will make this again, I am sure.

I made mine with 2 cups whole wheat flour and two cups white flour, for added flavor and nutrition. The whole wheat flour was quite dense, so I added a little extra buttermilk - came out amazing! The loaf was so pretty, we didn't want to break in to it! But once we did, we were glad - so yummy! Perfect with soups or with a little butter for breakfast!

This tasted very good but the cooking time is way off. I had to keep it in the oven about 30 minutes more and the outside became overcooked while the inside was still moist.  Next time I will lower the temperature and leave it in longer.

The best part is the crust! I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and extra butter (next time I'll add vinegar to the milk and make it curdle a bit like someone suggested here). Also, if you brush the crust with butter before baking it gives a really nice buttery crust. Mine was done in 35 mins, but the inside was (very) slightly doughy so I add on 10 mins on low heat. Turned out lovely.

This recipe makes the best soda bread I've had in years...outside of a recipe I received from an Irish pen pal, but lost, years ago. I use buttermilk powder and it turns out fabulous every time! Yum!

I love this bread. I could eat it every day, it's that tasty. I do add a cup of softened raisins to this. Since I use a buttermilk powder, I make the buttermilk with warm water and soften the raisins in it, and just dump the whole thing in. Last time I tried using 1 c whole wheat flour and 3 c white flour. Still came out fantastic. You simply can't go wrong with this bread!

Having made this bread twice now, both times it's turned out quite dry and I've had to adjust cooking time to allow the middle to catch up with the outer crust.  The bread has a good flavor but is oh-so-dry.  I wish to continue experimenting to see if this can somehow be resolved.

My first attempt at soda bread and it was a success!  Everyone loved it, including me.  I only gave 4 stars b/c I changed the recipe per others' suggestions:
--increased sugar to 1/3 cup
--decreased flour to 3 cups
--baked on a pizza stone
at 350 for 1 hour
--used the kithen aid mixer w/dough hook to knead 
--brushed with butter and buttermilk every 15 min (be careful not to let it run off sides and onto pan or it will stick)

I made it as stated and it is very good, and I also added a cup of currants. Toasts well the next day. However I like a lighter bread texture and this one is more like a scone and denser. So I will try another recipe next St Patricks Day.

This was the fisrt time I have ever tried to make a bread of this type. It seemed like the dough was to dry so I added about a 1/4 cup more buttermilk and it started to look like a biscuit dough. Went ahead and finished as recipe called for. Had to bake about 60 minutes, but it came out wonderful. Will make again and use my kitchen aid mixer so my arms won't be so sore after mixing.

Amazing recipe! I substituted the all-purpose flour with wheat flour and added raisins! I also did not have buttermilk so I used a combination of milk/vinegar...I can't get enough of it! I just toasted some up with butter, mmmmmmmm

I don't know what went wrong with this bread but it did not work for me. I followed the recipe exactly.  I have a brand new oven and the temp is not an issue but this just would not cook for me.  After 75 minutes, the outside is dry and crumbled and the inside is still not cooked properly. I see that it came out great for almost everyone else, so I have to assume the problem was with me, but I don't know what I could have done differently.

I made this for St Patricks Day. My kids loved it!  Each had thirds.  I like the scone quality of this bread.  I did have a problem with the middle getting done before the outside crust started getting too dark.  Next time I'll flatten it more to see if it makes a difference.  Thanks for the super easy recipe.

Made this tonight to go with our Italian Wedding Soup.  This bread is very good - but people should be warned that Soda Bread is a dryer bread that definitely needs something spread on it (butter, honey, jam, nutella, etc).  If you are looking for a moist bread, this is not for you.  We really enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to trying it toasted in the morning with some jelly, as others suggested.

I didn't find this to be like a traditional Irish Soda Bread.  I loved the flavor but prefer the dense traditional bread with caraway seeds & raisins in mine.

Add raisins--it makes the bread even better! I use about 3/4 of a cup. Also, my dough was a little too dry so I added an extra TB of butttermilk to make it nice and smooth. I agree with other reviewers that it is better to turn down the temp a little and bake a little longer to make sure the center is all the way done. I baked at 350 for 55 min.

Oh my... the recipe sounded so easy but it wasn't like any other I've tried.  I had wanted to add raisins but since they weren't listed, I forgot.  The bread has been in the over for 40 minutes now and is done on the outside but is gooey on the inside.  So disappointing when I'm trying to make a nice bread to go with corned beef and cabbage tonight! :(

This is the one I make every year. Taste so close to my Irish Grandma's.I cook a little longer in lower temp. oven and brush the buttermilk,butter mixture on about every 10-15 min. while baking. Wonderful!

this is the first time I have made Irish Soda Bread and it turned out great! The only thing I did different was I added raisins. I let them plump up in some boiling water and then once cooled and dry coated them in a flour and cinnamon mixture so they wouldn't sink. I also didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk and 1 tbs of lemon juice. It is a smaller size loaf so I would have to say I disagree with the 20 servings part. I sliced mine into about 10 slices that were about 1 inch thick. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved it! I wanted it a bit more like irish brown bread & it was much moister than anything I'd ever had, thank you!  used the kitchenaid w/ bread hook for the kneading, so easy. I did 1 C. whole wheat flour & 3 C. white, and no buttermilk, so I used 1T. white vinegar to the 1 and 1/4 C. 2% milk.   Great idea to baste it w/ melted butter & the milk while it baked; baked it at 350 for 1 hour & 10 or 15 min.  Made for an office st. patty's thing on Fri. & served it w/ butter & marmalade, everyone loved it!

Worked great. Kneading was a bit difficult but worth it. One tip I'd add is to add 1c raisins. Also, I found that my bread was a bit too raw on the inside. Next time, I'm going to flatten it a little more and cook it longer to make sure it's cooked more evenly and thoroughly. I got great feedback on this bread and recommend the recipe to others!

This was my first attempt at making Irish Soda Bread!   I followed another review and used my Stand Mixer' dough hook  but followed the recipe exactly and the bread turned out wonderful!    Will definitely make this again!

Can this bread be baked in a large bread pan?  What would happen if I did not cut the "X" in this bread?  I baked this and added 1/2 currants and 1/2 golden raisins and was deliscious, but having cut the "X" in my round loaf, it just kept getting a biger and biger gap in the center. I want to bake some for my neighbor and for my daughter and her family. Rd013

LOVED this recipe!  I don't have a lot of experience with Irish Soda Bread but this recipe was SUPER easy and delicious.  I added raisins (that I had soaked) and they were really nice in there.  I did take one of the other reviewers advice and decreased my oven temp and increased my time a little to make sure it cooked all the way through.

The texture is perfect! Yet it is a little bit too bland - try adding some raisin, sugar, or caraway seeds may help!

I don't like baking. its the prep that I hate.  But, this recipe is so easy and yummy. It's less work than a meatloaf. goes great with every hardy dish from meatloaf to chili and if there's leftover.... with marmalade in the morning mmmmm

This was good as written.  I made with beer baked Irish beef off this site and 6 of us ate the whole thing.  I did cut temp back to 340 and bake an hour as per another suggestion.

My grandma made Irish Soda Bread when I was a little girl, but somewhere along the line the recipe was lost.  I tried this recipe because it sounded a lot like the one she used to make and it's VERY close.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!  The only variation I made was substituting sour cream for buttermilk, as I didn't have any on hand.

This is my favourite recipe that I have tried from allrecipes.com so far.  I have made it multiple times and absolutely adore it.  I bring it to friends' dinner parties and it is always a hit.  We just had Thanksgiving last weekend up here in Canada and I made a slight alteration to the recipe to fit the season.  I added 1 tsp of "Everything Nice Premium Baking Spice" (from the epicentre in Bridgenorth, ON - though I bought it at a gourment kitchen store in Southampton, ON).  The spice is a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, cardamon, cloves, mace and lemon.  It changed the colour to a slight pumpkin-y orange - very appropriate for the season!  And it added a beautiful aroma and fantastic taste.  If I didn't have this pre-mixed spice on hand, I'd probably try mixing cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a bit of cloves.

I made this for a dinner party as an addition to Irish Lamb Stew and it was a huge hit.  I made no changes to the recipe whatsoever.  As with the stew there were no leftovers at all.  As a matter of fact I am making it again today for a friend who is having surgery.  Unbelievably awesome!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

I first made this recipe using half bread flour and half whole wheat pastry flour.  It was alright, but when I made it the second time with all white bread flour it was fantastic.  I baked it at the recommended temperature until the top started to brown and then reduced the heat to about 325 until it was done inside.

The flavor was delicious and it was extremely easy to make.  I made this for St P's day and it was a delight.  However, I'm glad I wasn't taking it to someone else's house, because I did end up having to cut the big loaf in two and baking each half some more.  I think it either needs to be made into two loaves, or the oven temp reduced and baking time increased.  The outside was definitely done and even getting too done, but the inside was doughy and needed more time. I had to cut it in half, wrap the outsides with foil so they didn't dry out and burn too much, and cook for a bit more.  Next time I'll make two smaller loaves from this recipe.

Really good! I had to substitute vinegar and milk for the buttermilk since that's all I had, but otherwise stuck exactly to the recipe. I did follow others' suggestions of cooking it at 350 degrees, though my oven cooks hot and it was done in 40 minutes (luckily I smelled that it was done!). Basically just watch the cook time, as it seems to vary. Also, I found that I could make it entirely in one big bowl (I mixed by hand), rather than kneading it on another surface that would have needed to be cleaned!

I made this for St. Patties tonight.  Cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for a family of 4.  This stuff is moist in the center and crisp and flaky on the outside.  It had the delicate flavor of a country fair scone.  I used powdered buttermilk and butter instead of margarine and it still turned out fantastic.  I would definitely make it again.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  It was almost like a biscuit consistency when it was done.  It smelled wonderful and tasted great. I did add about 1/2 cup of raisins and about 1 T of caraway seeds.  The previous reviewer who said that you don't need to make all of the basting liquid on top (butter and buttermilk) was right. I cut it in half and still had a lot left over. Looking forward to having it for breakfast!

Yum!  This was great.  I tried another recipe a couple years ago and it wasn't nearly as good.  I did bake it on a lower temperature for a longer amount of time to keep it from being overdone on the outside and doughy on the inside and it turned out perfect.

Very easy to make and taste good. The timing for the baking is a little off but then again everybody's oven is different. I put half all purpose flour and half bread flour and i added raisins and dried cranberries.

I make this recipe every year at my house, and it is a much anticipated treat. I prefer this to the "Irresistable Irish Soda Bread" recipe due to the fact that it has such a wonferful texture. It is worth the kneading.

Ordinary. I followed the recipe exactly and the finished product came out fine, but it was boring and bland. We only ate a few bites and the rest was quickly forgotten.

I tried this bread one year for St. Patrick's Day. It was a big hit with everyone.  Now whenever I make stews it's a must have.  I make it in my food processor with the plastic blade instead of the metal one.  It mixes everything perfectly and also saves me from having to knead the dough.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe for soda bread. If you do not have buttermilk on hand, you can add 1 tbsp of vinegar (I prefer cider vinegar) to a liquid meausring cup, and then fill it with milk to the desired mark. I also recommend flattening the dough a little, as it will cook quicker. The first time that I cooked this bread, I did not flatten it, and I had to bake it quite a bit longer. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent soda bread!  I made it with Corned Beef and Cabbage from this site and it was a perfect accompaniment.  Slightly sweet, just moist enough.  Great recipe.

I split into 2 loaves (froze one), baked at 350, added raisins, used kitchenaid mixer.  Yep. It really is easy.  Foolproof. Thanks!

The bread tasted good, but it tasted a lot like biscuits (as noted by other reviewers). I've never made or tasted Irish Soda Bread prior to this so I have nothing to compare it to. I will try other recipes on this site and go from there. I baked at 360 for 45 minutes and made my own buttermilk (milk + white vinegar) as I didn't have any.

This was a good biscuit recipe, in fact I would suggest putting it into muffin pans and making individual biscuits. Unfortunately it bore absolutely no resemblance to Irish soda bread.

What a great recipe! I was looking for a less sweet soda bread & this one's a charm! Made it in time for my St. Pat's dinner tonight, w/time to spare. Another reviewer suggested a slower, lower heat, so I baked it @ 350 degrees, turned & basted it every 15 minutes. LOOKS & TASTES authentic! Thanks to the person that submitted this gem - a keeper!

This is my first ever attempt at making soda bread, and I was extremely pleased with the result - an extremely easy and tasty bread to make. I didn't have buttermilk, so substituted 1 cup of milk to 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, which worked a treat. To me, this bread is best served warm with jam - I had some black cherry jam on mine, and it was amazing!!!

This is so easy and delicious.  I was out of buttermilk so I used 1 c. sour cream in the dough and 1/4c milk with 1/4 T of lemon for the top.  It turned out great.  Thanks.

While I must admit that the consistency was not quite right, the taste and ease of prep for this bread was fabulous!  I made it for my Girl Scout troop's Ireland booth and everyone loved it.  5 year olds wouldn't stop eating it - plain!  I did not use raisins or currants as I was making it for kids.  It was exceptionally wonderful freshly warmed and slathered with butter.  I highly recommend!

This is the most fabulous moist and tasty soda bread I have ever had.  It was worth the trip to the store for the buttermilk.  Kudos from all at work for the St Patricks Day potluck!

It was also the easiest bread recipe I have ever seen.  :)

Relatively easy to make for someone who had never made bread in her life. It didn't rise as well as I had hoped last year (2002), but I am going to try again this year for St. Pat's Day. Good luck.

Delicious! Really easy to make. Made my own buttermilk with half & half and lemon juice. Served with corned beef and cabbage.  Had to make another loaf because the first one was gone before dinner was ready! Not a problem though because it was a cinch to make. Used my kitchen  aid mixer.  Will definitely make again.

Great tasting easy bread. Made for eating with chili instead of corn bread. Used vanilla soy with lemon juice instead of buttermilk and used non-dairy butter. Used my KitchenAid to mix and kneed, so putting it together was a breeze. Baked for an hour at 340 degrees on a pizza stone. Nice blend of light crunchy crust with nice soft, moist insides. Made a nice big loaf to be used with other meals!

Really good. I mixed with dough hook in Kitchen Aid mixer and it turned out great. I think basting often is necessary for this to not get too dark.

I made three loaves last night and it was a huge success! Not only was the process quick and simple but the results were- and I am quoting my Irish mother-in-law here- "the best soda bread she has ever had". Last year we even bought ours at Marianos! Now how's that for review. I will make this recipe every year (and as one person pointed out, as a substitute for cornbread to go with chili). I used a few user suggestions and cooked mine at 340F for about 50 min and basted aroung 3 times each.

It is really good! Made this before and have one in the oven as I write this review. I don't put all the sugar that this recipe calls for. I use Kerrygold Irish Butter instead of margarine, plus mine took more buttermilk to make the dough. Great recipe, all in all. Sure am looking forward to our St. Paddy's Day meal this evening!! Thanks for sharing this recipe MP Welty. :)

I just made this Irish soda bread recipe and it turned out wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for but I did have to bake it about 5 more minutes to get it done. I think everyone's oven heats differently so you might want to figure out how your oven cooks and then adjust accordingly. this is definitely a recipe I'm going to keep and make often.

This recipe was a hit! My mother loved it and she is a big fan of Irish soda bread. I used butter instead of margarine. I also used craisins instead of raisins in order to appease a raisin-hater in my family. I suggest lowering the heat to 350 and cooking it about 10-15 minutes longer. It will be visibly doughy right in the middle of the top if it isn't done yet.

I've made this on two separate St. Patrick's days. Both times it was a success! I use regular and golden raisins mixed. One thing that I've noted is that I have to extend the cooking time to get them cooked through. Even trying to spread my dough balls thinner didn't help the second time around. Good recipe for anyone trying to duplicate what their Irish grandmother did. Update - This time I made it into two loaves and cooked on a half sheet (side by side) for 35 minutes. The result was perfect!!

I made this recipe for my friends and I to celebrate St. Patrick's Day!  The bread was so moist and delicious.  On one of my slices I put on strawberry jam and on another I put grape jelly.  They were both really tasty.  I am so proud that I found this recipe.

My husband made this tonight after my MIL found the recipe. The dough was so crumbly that she had him put in another 1/2 cup buttermilk. It turned out great!  This one is going in our recipe book.

I made this recipe twice to make sure that I did not do anything wrong. I found it to be extremely dry and hard to mix (even when kneading it with my hands). Once out of the oven, it was a good bread.

Added raisins & took other reviewers advice to bake at 350 for an hour. This is delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a family favorite.  I follow the directions exactly, no changes needed, but I always end up cooking for the max amount of time.  I was so happy to finally find a recipe that didn't call for raisins.  I end up having to make my brother his own loaf for his birthday every year, and it never seems to last him more than a couple of days.  When I make at home, my husband and i seem to devour in two days as well, I love it with just butter, but he's asked me to include that this is amazing with peanut butter as well.

I basted the top of bread with buttermilk, melted butter 3 times and sprinkled a generous amount of sugar on too each time.  I baked it at 340 degrees. 1 hr.  Toothpick came out clean

Like others before me have mentioned - waaaaaay to dry and crumbly (Had to add quite a bit of butter milk and butter just in order to make the dough stay together instead of fall apart.)
It amazes me how this recipe turns out "way too runny" for some, and "way too dry" for others. I wonder if there are different kinds of buttermilk or something that might cause the difference?

Made this to accompany our corned beef and cabbage dinner for St. Patrick's Day.  This recipe is "amazingly" easy and very nice.  I've never had Irish Soda Bread so have nothing with which to compare. Loved the texture and biscuit like taste. After dinner I had some with butter and honey - yummmy!

This was our first time making irish soda bread.  We halved the recipe and added chocolate chips to our loaf.  We also accidentally cooked it at 400 (oops) for 30 minutes, but luckily it still turned out good...crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.  Will definitely make again, but next time will cook at 375 :).

Today was my first attempt at making Irish soda bread and I used this recipe.  Very easy to follow and the results were great!  I may not be the prettiest loaf of bread, but certainly is delicious.  Will continue to use this recipe in the future.

Before yesterday I had never had soda bread. Being today is St. Patrick's Day, a local bakery was having a special and my other half said we had to by some for dinner tonight. The loaf didn't make it through the night so I looked up recipes. This one looked good so I decided to try baking my own. I used Bulgarian buttermilk because all others were lowfat. I prefer whole milks. The rest of the recipe was kept the same except for the butter and buttermilk amounts for the final brushing. It seemed too much and I halved it and still had lots left over. My other half said it was better than the bakeries. Did not use the raisins for this loaf, but will for sure on the next!

Used the recipe, but changed the method.  Like this one better than my other recipe because it uses buttermilk and adds an egg and butter for more richness.  There are some key steps missing from the instructions as published.  Here are my suggestions....  1. Wisk the dry ingredients thoroughly before CUTTING in COLD BUTTER in place of 1/2 c. margarine.  2. Beat together egg and buttermilk, adding extra buttermilk if needed to bring the dough together.  3. Separate the dough into 2 portions (baking it as one large round browns the outside before it's was baked all the way through).  Agree with brushing the loaves as they bake.  Other reviews mentioned lowering the oven temp, but I think the higher temp is needed to achieve a good texture.  Optional:  add caraway seeds or reconstituted raisins or both.

I didn't know what to expect.  It was quick and easy to make.  It reminded me more of a scone than bread.  I think adding other ingredients like fruites and chocolate might make it taste yummier.  My husband says it tastes good dipped in the buttermilk & butter mixture.  I'd make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

A bit confused with this recipe.  It shows a picture with raisins/currents but they are not in the recipe.  I added mine in with the flour before adding wet ingredients though.  It's in the oven now I hope it's delish!  Also, no need to melt 1/4 C of butter with a 1/4 C of buttermilk for the topping.  You only need about a tablespoon of each.  So much leftover it was a waste.

The pic looks like it has raisins in it but it's not in the recipe.  So I did add the raisins in kneading.

Excellent bread went great with corned beef dinner we had last night. Only change was that I used real butter in the bread and for the buttermilk wash for the outside. Was good toasted with egg and sausage for breakfast this morning too. I will use this recipe from now on for strawberry shortcakes!

Was pretty good. Had to add more buttermilk while mixing to get more than crumbles but I'm at a very high elevation. It wasen't quite as good as the local irish pub but I'll keep trying!

This is a good rustic bread with soups or like items especially. Think I will cut down on the sugar by 1/4 the next time. Really liked the crunchy crust and soda flavor.

I made a completely daft move when making this and didn't add in the butter at the appropriate time! I ended up messily kneading it in to what should have been the finished product! Regardless of the mess, it was delicious when I finally had it incorporated! I will be making this again soon!

Very easy to make and delicious with a big smear of jam on top. This makes a pretty big loaf. You might want to split it in two and bake two medium loaves (more crust that way too!)

One of the best Irish Soda bread recipes...with a little tweaking...I added an extra 1/4 c of buttermilk, some currents and caraway seeds.  My family could not get enough...will make again next St. Patty's Day!

Was wonderful.  Used our kitchen-aide stand up mixer - so easy.   Cooked it in a greased cast-iron skillet.  We did find that we needed a little more buttermilk in order to get the dough to hold together.  A keeper.  Will make it again.

I was distracted with company when making this bread and forgot to put in the butter 'till after I added the egg and buttermilk and realized the dough looked a little dry! I also used whole wheat flower instead and had to cook it about 20 minutes longer. Was def. EASY and would be good with soup or something. Not my favorite.

Made this today for my irish grandmother's birthday party and everyone loved it, including her.  I only basted with the milk/butter just before I put it in the oven and sprinkled a little sugar on top at that time.  Left it alone and it was done in about 45 minutes.  So easy!  ***  My three year old loves raisins so we made a second loaf with raisins and she was able to pretty much make this bread by herself.  This is the easiest bread I've ever made.

Very easy and delicious.   Made this for St. Patrick's Day dinner for the family.   Everybody LOVED it and as a bonus, it was fantastic as thick slabs of toast the next day with jam.  AWESOME!  The loaf got a bit brown in the oven at 375*F so next time I will reduce oven temp to 350-360*F and back for longer.  Will be making this again soon!

Amazingly easy recipe. I had several other people for dinner on St. Patrick's day. None of them had heard if Irish Soda Bread.

I added 3 cups of California Thompson Seedless Grapes to the recipe. Yes! 3 cups! & a Table Spoon of Caraway Seeds. The Caraway Seeds added great flavor.

All of my guests greatly enjoyed this Irish Soda Bread. I will definitly make it again next St. Patty's Day

I baked it in a lightly  spayed (Pam) Bundt Cake Cake Pan. The bottom, sides & top came out perfect.

FIVE Stars

I have never made Irish soda bread before, much less eaten it, but I made this recipe & it turned out wonderful. I did take some other reviewers advice. I flattened it before baking & baked it @ 350 for sixty minutes & used all the basting mixture. I did use butter instead of margarine. It was good to know about the milk & vinegar instead of buttermilk as I went to two different stores just for the buttermilk. I've already had two slices with butter & our corned beef dinner isn't for another 5 hours. I will definitely make this again & I'll try it with raisins next time. Thank you to all the reviewers for their helpful tips. Great recipe, great site!!

I wonder if after upping sugar, adding buttermilk soaked rasins, and cinnamon if a nice glaze made with buttermilk, sugar, butter poured over the top would be good?
Has anyone tried this? I will post again after making it this way.
I have made it as written after applying others suggestions. 
Excellent!

My bread is drier than I expected.  I added golden raisins during the kneading but I should have added them during the mixing phase.

I have never made Irish Soda Bread before but it was the perfect thing to have with Corned Beef and Cabbage on St. Patrick's Day.  My guests loved it and I've made it a couple more times already for my husband. It's simple and delicious.

MmMmMMmmm..I have never tried Irish Soda Bread before, so I really don't have anything to compare this to...BUT it was definitely delicious!  I kind of messed up the recipe a little bit... I added 1 tsp baking powder instead of 1 TBS (oops!), and it still turned out wonderful. 5 stars :~)

Followed recipe to make the dough exactly, and the taste was amazing. Wouldn't change anything with that. Used dough hook with the KitchenAid and it was super easy!
In order for the bread to cook all the way through without over-browning the crust, the formed ball definitely needs to be more flat than tall. I reduced the oven to 365 (to avoid too brown of crust and raw middle) and it still took over an hour to bake completely.

So easy and so loved by all my co-workers at the St Paddy's Day Irish Potluck we had!  I think it tasted like a big buttermilk scone.  Went REALLY well with the stew.  I made sure to make the round a little flatter than pictured as the reviews said it would bake more evenly and it did! I think I took it out of the oven a little earlier than directed. But it went well.

Easy recipe came out nice and moist lasted several days too.  I used a kitchen aid mixer and it needed itself. I just had to had about 1/4 cup more buttermilk to the batter because it was kind of flaky.  Nice recipe thanks!

I am a novice baker, and recipe truly was "amazingly easy", and yummy too!
As others have mentioned, it is a dense bread. 
I baked mine at 325 degrees and baked it for an additional 15 minutes since the center was still a bit doughy after the first 50 minutes.
Also, I added raisins to the dough before baking it to add extra yumminess to it.
Mahalo for the great recipe. I'll be making this bread again, definitely!

Followed the recipe exactly. Super easy and worked out perfectly. Added raisins and caraway seeds for a traditional taste. Only recommendation is to bake at 350 extend the cook time an extra 10 minutes.

I threw in two cups of softened raisins.  It was just like my grandma in Belfast used to make.  My husband nearly wept with joy as it was just like his grandma in Cork used to make.  My son, who hates raisins, loves it too!  I had to slather mine with butter and raspberry jelly.  OMG!  LOVE IT!!!

Great recipe, quick, easy and fantastic texture.  But yikes is this ever sweet!  If you like cornbread with your meal then this is for you, if not (like me) then cut the sugar waaaay down or eat it like a giant scone with a cup of tea and some jam!  Yum!

I've never had soda bread before so I was curious to try it out.  Basically it turned out like a giant, loaf-shaped biscuit.  My loaf didn't really look like it did in the pictures either.  It raised a lot during baking so the dough that I cut the x in was now the sides of the loaf and the top was all pock-marked and not as pretty.  It tasted ok for a biscuit, though.

I made this bread to the letter of the recipe and it came out wonderful! I do recommend that you watch it closely after the 30 minute mark as it really depends on your oven. Mine only took 40 minutes. My husband has yet to stop raving about it ^_^

Over the past year I've made this bread 3 times and it's come out perfect each time. It's SO good!  I've followed the recipe as written (but used butter instead of margarine, and just watched the final minutes of baking after 50 minutes, then performed the "toothpick test", adding a few more minutes in the oven when necessary).  This last time I baked this bread I did add 1/2 cup of raisins.  Previously I didn't add anything as an additional ingredient.  With or without raisins this bread is so addictive you don't need any kind of spread on it, just eat it as it is!  This is an excellent bread to go along with and dip into a hardy stew or soup.  It's a great bread to accompany a salad.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

My family loved the bread. It was really thick and chewy! First loaf wasn't shaped/kneaded well. Flatten out b/c it does rise a bit. Thanks for sharing! I will make this thick bread again.

My 5th-grade son and I made this for a Heritage project in his social studies class.  It smelled so good baking that I had to taste it when it was done. It was absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  The kids in his class loved it too; there were no left-overs!

Delicious!  Soft insides, just-crusty-enough outside, flaky, and just sweet enough.  The only thing I'd change would be to make it into two smaller loaves because my one big loaf cooked well on the outside in the specified time but needed a good deal more time to cook the inside.  I pulled off the crust that had already cooked before putting it back in the oven so it wouldn't burn, and I got a second crust from the "second baking".

Wow, it was my first time making Irish Soda Bread and it was pretty easy to make and tasted great.  Upon TMoore's review, I turned down the temp. tiny bit to 370.  Despite this attempt, the top crust was crispy and hard while a toothpick inserted into the center came out doughy.  By the time a toothpick came out clean, the bottom crust was too crispy, dark, and hard.  Next time, I'll try 350-360 degrees.  Nonetheless, it was a great receipt and I really enjoyed it.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this turned out more like a big kind-of dry biscuit than a bread.  It was okay, but I think I'll try a different recipe next St. Patty's Day.

I feel like I can't rate this bread any higher - simply because it's NOT amazingly easy (as the title suggests.)  This was my first attempt at Soda bread, for our St. Patty's day meal. It took much longer than 45 minutes for the inside to completely cook - but by then the outside was overdone.  Left it cooling on the counter while I dished up the corned beef and it turned into a solid BRICK that required a small kitchen saw to cut.  None the less, we gave it a try ... guess it tasted ok. But certainly not great and given the hardness of the outside, nobody had moare than one small piece.  Think I'll pass on this one and continue looking for a Soda Bread recipe.

Made for St. Patricks day with Corned beef and cabbage and the rest went toasted for breakfast. This is PERFECT soda bread. Slightly sweet, soft and moist on the inside, crusty out. Now on permanent rotation, thanks!

I have never made bread before and I made this for my potluck.  It was incredible easy and fast.  I followed the recipe with only one exception.  I used butter in place of margarine.  It was a big hit at the potluck everyone loved it even my Irish friends who makes Soda bread on a regular basis. Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy to make, basically no clean up with a stand mixer. I added raisins and wish I had added A LOT MORE, I did just a few handfuls. The sweetness of the raisins really helped the bread taste better, made it a little more special. I feel like this bread is a little dry too. I do not know if this is because I used about 2 cups regular flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. I have never baked with whole flour before so I am not sure how much it changes the taste or moisture of bread. I also baked on 350 instead of 375 for 40 minutes, then 20 more minutes. I brushed it three times total with the butter and buttermilk mixture. It was definitely tasty bread but I wish it had been more moist and sweeter. I would make it again though with more raisins, not sure what I would do to make it more moist though.

I had to add about 2 extra tablespoons of buttermilk because the dough was too dry to knead at first. Then I baked the loaf at 350 instead of 375, and it was perfect. The second time I made it I added orange craisins, and mini chocolate chips, and it was even better!

this was really really dry and it didn't have a whole lot of taste.  it reminded me of beer bread without that sweet flavor it gives. it maybe was supposed to be like that, but i didn't really care for it.

This is a easy and very forgiving recipe. I have made it 3 times now, and the first 2 I made mistakes. The first time I misread the recipe and melted the margarine before adding it to the flour mixture, it still came out terrific. The second, I got distracted and doubled the butter and didn't realize it until I was almost ready to bake. I doubled the rest of the ingredients, made two loaves, and they were both excellent. Actually did it right the third time and it was wonderful. I've taken leftovers to work and gotten marriage proposals from men half my age LOL. I make it often.

The recipe was a bit harder than we thought, not impossible however.  I personally felt it was a bit dry.  Would make a nice bread pudding however.  The taste was fine, not special to me.  I would suggest having this with a "gravy" meal to sop-up the leftovers.

Awsome!  This was my first attempt at soda bread, so I had my husband grab a loaf of bread at the store as a backup.  No one touched the back up!!  This bread was crusty on the outside and soft inside.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion and baked it at a lower temp (350) for a few more minutes.

Excellent bread! Nice crunchy crust and a moist, tender, sweet middle.  I would recommend letting the bread round sit for about 30 min at room temp to allow it to riseand develop texture. YUM!

Tasty, easy, fast, delicious. Yum! (If your bread was still doughy in the middle, put it back in the oven and let it finish cooking! The outside is meant to be crusty and brown!)

Thankyou so much for posting. This was a real treat. I made it to go with my corn beef. I actually made 2 smaller loafs, one plain and one with raisins. My DH ate almost a whole loaf of the raisin himself, saying this should be illegal, something that tastes this good. He made cornbeef sandwiches with it and was in seventh heaven, sighing, and oohing throughout dinner. By the way he said to give you 10 stars, so here they are **********. I know i will be making this quite often he wants to have it for breakfasts too.

amazingly easy... amazingly versatile, this bread taste great with all, or none of the trimmings! Mine has two cups whole wheat flour, half butter/half unsweetened applesauce in batter, a bit of honey added to the buttermilk/butter topping. After twenty minutes, I drizzled a bit more of the topping, and it tastes delish!! Oh... and I like mine warm, with apricot preserves... Yum!!!! :)

This Irish Soda Bread is a family favorite - and it's easy and basic just as it states.  The kneading of the dough is tolerable and worth the effort!  Actually, my kids enjoy helping with that part.  This has been a family favorite for several years and has even been requested during other holiday events other than St. Patty's Day.  My husband is Irish - so this is a huge hit with him!

This is my second year making this bread. I made it last night because I had the time and I had to make myself stop eating it, it's so good! I agree that a smaller amount of basting milk/butter is all that's needed. I used 2 Tbls of buttermilk t& 1 Tbls of butter.

I thought I'd try this recipe after reading all the great reviews that it got.  This was my first attempt at making soda bread, but I've tasted plenty of others store bought and homemade.  My daughter commented on the way it looked when I took it out of the oven and said she hoped it tasted as good as it looked because it sure looked good!  Boy were we disappointed in the taste.  Not very flavorful at all compared to other soda breads we've had and also had a strange texture.  Will try it in the morning for breakfast toasted with butter and maybe some jelly on it...I don't mind sharing with the birds, but I'd really hate to have to give them the whole loaf! :)

I just made two loaves of this bread for a family St. Patrick's Day Celebration.  It was so amazing and so wonderful...EVERYONE wants the recipe!  Even my Grandmother who is Czech and usually turns up her nose at Irish cooking.  My Irish Grandfather was very please with a meal to celebrate the homeland (especially the bread)!  :)

This is my first attempt at Irish Soda Bread.  I followed the directions (using a kitchen aid with dough hook).  The outside of my loaf looked like the featured photo, but inside was doughy.  Will make again tomorrow, lowering the heat AND have my butter at room temp (I nuked it for a few seconds on the first batch).  Will cut into the flour per previous recommendation, as well as lower oven temp and bake longer.

I didn't care for the texture of this bread, but the kids are eating it up.  Maybe next time I'll try it in a loaf pan, or two loaf pans.  Although, I don't think I'll make this from scratch again.

This was a good recipe and it tastes great. But the dough was too floury, I would suggest cutting the flour back to three cups. Also, I mixed in some cranberries, they tasted delicious.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out well.  The taste was great slightly sweet but not overly.  I did find however my bread was very very crumbly.  It broke apart quite easily and was hard to keep together.  It was also very very dense.  I don't know if soda bread is always like this or I Just mixed it too long.  I would however make it again.

It wasn't pretty to make and looked a little funny while baking, but boy was it tasty! I was hoping to have one last piece while I was doing the dishes but it was all gone. I will definately make again for St. Patricks Day. Definately is the cast iron skillet!

Delicious bread, easy to make, but not quite like a traditional Irish Soda Bread. I would like it better with a whole grain flour, and a denser bread would go better with soup.

Excellent.  Had to cook at 325 degrees to accommodate another dish in the oven.  I cooked it 10 minutes longer to compensate and it still turned out fabulous.

Since I have never made bread before or even tried Irish Soda Bread, I had no idea what to expect. This turned out really good. I followed the instructions exactly. To me, this was a sweet bread that would be used as a snack at 'Tea Time'. Would taste perfect with with home made jam.

I tried mixing the dough in my Kitchen Aid, but the dough turned out very dry and crumbly. Even after I baked it, the bread was extremely dry and crumbly on the outside. The middle actually tasted really yummy. I will make this again, but I will make the dough by hand.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  Also makes great biscuits - Add raisins if you want, split the dough into biscuit sized balls and place on a greased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 15-20 min or until golden brown on the top.

Amazing recipe! The bread is even better than the one I had in Ireland. I subsitute 1 or 2 cups with whole wheat flour, to give it its typical brown colour. It keeps fragrant for days, everybody loves it!

This was really yummy although mine was a tad doughy in the middle (I should've flattened it a bit more I think..)  and I threw in some dried cherries, blueberries and cranberries for an extra kick in each bite.  My kids loved it too. =)  Thanks for the recipe!

I have no concept of what Irish Soda Bread taste likes but I do know that this was very good.  It does resemble a biscuit in a way.  I added a handful of raisins to mine.  I would agree that you don't need 1/4 cup of butter and buttermilk.  Instead 2 tbs. should be fine.  That reminds me... I didn't have Margarine so I used butter instead.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe MP!

The title says it all! Very good bread. I made 1/2 the recipe, big mistake, next time I'll make the whole thing because it went very fast! In fact I'm not going to wait for St. Patty's Day to make this one again.

This was the first time I made Irish Soda Bread. I came out fantastic, everyone loved it very much. I made the dough using my Kitchenaid like a few other have done, then I molded it with my hands into a round ball shape. I also found that is you cook the bread at 350* for 1hr 20 minutes it come out perfect. Thanx for the great recipe!

Very yummy with our stew today on St. Patty's Day!  I did turn down the oven to 350 like others suggested and it turned out perfectly!  Thanks!

Made this for St. Pats with my 4 year old and it was SO good. We served it with mint jelly to add some green and it went very well. My only suggestion would be not to brush it before baking a little as it browns a little faster then it cooks that way, but that could also be because we made our loaf very thick.

This recipe is great and super easy! I made 2 batches of this Irish Soda Bread- one I used for a regular loaf and the other I split up into muffin trays and made Irish Soda Bread Muffins. I baked them for half the time required for the full loaf and they came out perfect. Raisin's really put this recipe over the top!

A very tender, flavorful Irish Soda bread. I especially liked the extra touch of basting with buttermilk/butter during cooking, which created an amazing crust. This will definitely go onto my regular rotation of biscuits and muffins.

This Irish Soda bread was delicous and very easy to make.  Like others, I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the bread attachment on, so I did not have to hand knead.  I did not have buttermilk or regular milk so I used evaporated milk and 1/2 the sugar and it turned out fantastic.  Next time I think I wil add some raisons.

So tasty!  The two things I did differently was 1.)I used butter (what I had), and 2.) I let the dough rise on the pan for about an hour to let the soda activate and get a better rise.  Next time I will flatten out the bread a lot more and then let it rise because I've had a problem getting it to cook properly both times I've made this (I did turn down the heat about 25 degrees and still had to cover it with foil for the last 20 minutes or so that it would bake and not burn).

I followed the recipe exactly except that I did add some dried cranberries.  I had trouble getting it to cook all of the way through without getting to brown on the outside. Next time I will lower the temperature and plan on baking longer.

This was the best soda bread ever, or so I was told.  This was my first experience with soda bread and some of my guest did not want to eat it because of past breads they had tried.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I made half with raisins and stored it for several days in Tupperware.  Thank you!

I love soda bread and make a really good one but decided to try this one as the reviews were great. I must say I was very disappointed. It had very little flavor and was too dense. It was also a little on the dry side. I think I'll stick with my normal recipe.

This was truly amazingly easy!  This was my first time making Irish soda bread and this was the perfect recipe to get started with.  I made two batches.  One I made exactly as the recipe suggests and the other I wanted to be a bit like a scone so I added dried cherries to the dough and raw sugar to the top.  Both where very good!  My family will make this time and time again!  Thank you for sharing!

I added 1/2 cup extra sugar for sweetness bc we didn't have raisins.  I reduced the butter bc I think everything has way too much fat.  I accidentally added 3/4 cup more buttermilk, so I had to put it in an 8x8 pan.  I started the temp at 400, then reduced it to 350 after about 15-20 minutes.  After about another half hour I put it to 325.  It came out AWESOME.  Not so much a soda bread, more a breakfast bread, but soooooo delicious.  I was going to give it 4 stars, but after writing this I'm changing my mind to 5!

This was really yummy, if a little dry.  It was simple to make, went well with my St. Patty's day dinner and cooked up beautifully.  It had an almost cakey texture.  I'd make it again.

Well, this is a very subjective recipe! The texture IS like a biscuit, or maybe even more accurately, like a SCONE. The butter (I used the real thing) gave it a pleasant taste, but I agree, it was not sweet, and it was very dry the next day. I was disappointed but my husband and kids were not. It was still edible with some honey or lemon curd on it.

Oh my goodness, this was the best soda bread ever! I cannot bake to save my life and this turned out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing. I didn't have enough all purpose flour so I used half whole wheat flour and my family loved it.

This bread was very easy to make, quite tasty, though crumbly.  We didn't mind that too much because we nibbled on the crust and crumbs right off the pan after cutting!  It did take longer to bake than it said. I will make this again!

I've tried a number of the other Irish soda bread recipes that are also highly rated. This one is by far the best. Unlike the others, this one remains moist while still maintaining the authentic soda bread taste.

I choose this recipe because it wasn't as sweet as other recipes. Unfortunately, it's a better biscuit recipe than Irish soda bread.

Let me start by saying that I HATE making bread.  Or baking in general.  I have a gas stove and, in my opinion, it is hard to bake with gas.

That being said, this is one item that I baked that I didn't mess up!  The bread turned out like a big, crunchy-on-the-outside, fluffy-and-moist-on-the-inside buttermilk biscuit.  Delicious!  My boyfriend wanted me to whip up some sausage gravy to pour over the top. :P   I love that this was SOOOO easy to make, and there was minimal clean-up after preparing it.  Any recipe that meets those requirements AND tastes good is a definite 5-star in my book.

This will be a great addition to my St. Patty's feast this year!  Sure to be a crowd pleaser.

This is an awesome recipe! I am still learning to be a good baker and this was so easy! Of course, I mess it up the first time, I used the dried buttermilk instead of the liquid. :) I know, I know...I told you I am still learning. 
Anyway, the second batch was really amazing. It taste so good and it goes with the Corned Beef and Cabbage II (submitted by Cindy). My father-in-law loved it and of course my husband. He practically ate 1/4 of the bread in one sitting. 
Since other reviews suggested longer time to bake and slow temp, I baked it at 320 and for an hour. It was perfect!

I haven't tried irish soda bread before because it's not very common from where I came from. It tasted a little eggy, I'm not sure if that's how it should really taste. It turned out soft and moist, which is nice. But I think it would be better with a little spice in it like raisins and cinnamon. I'll probably try that next time.

I found this bread dough so dry it was impossible to knead until I added more buttermilk. Comparing it to other similar recipes, it uses about half the liquid most of them use, and that's probably the reason. Smells delicious however, and has a nice rustic appearance. I could not give it a higher rating because of the disproportionate amount of dry ingredients to wet -- it should not be that difficult to complete the preparation.

I made this yesterday for my husband.  He was telling me how he missed his mom, and how she used to make this amazing Irish Soda Bread or "Spotted Dog" recipe.  I wanted to surprise him so I gave this a shot.  He LOVED IT!! He said "this is almost as good as moms!" I don't hear those words often!! I did add the 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of raisins, and baked at 350 for about 50 minutes.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, made my husband smile and my heart sing!

This bread was a huge hit -- everyone was raving about it. I used a stick of butter instead of margarine, and added two cups of golden raisins and 1 1/2 tablespoons of caraway seed. Note -- this is an Irish Soda Bread of the drier, denser variety, not the fluffy sweet variety that always reminds me of a hot cross bun. It's beautiful with butter slathered on it.

Great recipe!!  Was a beautiful presentation. Treated my co-workers, they loved it. I did add 1/4C sugar, 1C white raisins & 1/1/2 TBSP caraway seeds.  Also brushed every 15 min.during baking. I have a new St Pat's tradition!!

This is so easy. The best part is the flavor that the basting with buttermilk/oleo gives the crust. Makes it unique.

This was easy to make, but I have to say I didn't think this really tasted like authentic Soda Bread, the consistency and flavor were much more like a buttermilk biscuit... which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but I will have to keep looking for a good Soda Bread Recipe!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and placed dough on parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. I made no changes to the recipe ingredients, but did split the dough in half and made 2 mini 6" diameter loaves and baked for 30 minutes. Have used this recipe for a few years now with excellent results.

Made this several times now. So delicious. Tried the additional sugar used about 1/2 cup and it's so good. Also used 2 cups 00 wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose. The texture is smooth. First time I made it I baked it at 375 as recommended but the outside was dark brown and the inside a bit raw. So I made a second loaf a both flatter in shape and cooked at a lower temperature for about an hour. Was baked all the way through the second time. This bread has the sweetness of cornbread and the texture of a scone.  Love it!

I am not sure if I did something wrong, as it is my first time making soda bread, but I couldn't get it to form into a ball. It said not to over knead it, so i tried not to.  When it was baking it just cracked all over. still in the oven so I haven't tasted it . wonder if anybody has any suggestions.

Would NEVER use margarine in Irish Bread so I used butter instead and added currants. I also turned the oven down a bit and cooked longer. I lost my Mom's Irish bread recipe and was trying to find one that was similar. Not as good as my Mom's but pretty close!

Mine was a bit crumbly, so I’m wondering if I need to knead it more (it said “knead slightly,” so I was afraid I would make my bread tough) , but it still was moist and had great flavor. I’ll be adding this to our rotation of breads.

Nice and quick to make, looks pretty rustic. I found that brushing the bread throughout baking gave it a somewhat charred look (never happened to be before), although it didn't affect the texture or taste.

I make this several times a month at this point. SO good! I do end up using my hands to mix it to get all the flour molded together. Otherwise, I go right off the recipe.

This was my first time making soda bread and I thought I screwed up. I didn't know it would be so biscuit like. It tasted like a really delicious biscuit. So this morning I tossed in sausage, cheese, and garlic, and made biscuits.

I was hoping for something more like the sweet soda bread they sell on St. Paddy's - it's likely not authentic, but very delicious.

I'll certainly make this again, but not what I expected. Four stars instead of five because you really should lower the temp and up the time to get it baked all the way through.

Made it in gluten free version (make my own flour mix; for 2 flour  cups - 1 cup rice flour, 3/4cup potatos starch, 1/4cup  arrowroot starch), used baking soda only, 2 ts. Added raisins. The rest as in the recipe. After short kneadding left it covered with a towel for about 50 minutes next to the stove. Baked and turned out great. Nice bread crust and texture. Eveyone loved it.

Made this on St. Paddy's Day to go with Guinness  Corned Beef. It was really good. The dough was extremely dry and I couldn't get it to come together for anything so I added about 1/4 cup more milk. That seemed to work.

Not a kind of bread we are used to but everyone in my family ate it and the consensus was that it went well with the  meal. 

It seems bland at first bite but then the mild sweet after flavor makes you go for another bite and another...  The texture was dense and moist. My picky son compared it to banana bread without the banana.

It was amazing the next day warmed up with blueberry and acai jam! I might make some more just for that purpose.

This bread is delicious!!!! However, I made a couple changes. I used 4 c. Bread flour. Don't knead it ! It will be to dense.  I also used an extra 2 to 3 tbsp of buttermilk in the bread for moistness. Basted and sugared the top for a sweet crispy crust and my husband likes a sweeter soda bread so upper the sugar to 1/3 c. I also used real butter. Never use Margarine!!! Let me tell you something this bread is so good. I could eat the whole loaf if you left me alone with it and a stick a butter. Watch out, its that good! Make sure you make extra deep cuts in the bread. If you don't you wont get enough heat in the middle and your bread will be doughy. I just learned this trick. When I made this the first time I didn't know and my bread was underdone. I recently made it again in 2 loaves since it gets so big and it was lovely.

Simple to make with ingredients you have on hand and absolutely delicious.  Served with butter and jam alongside corned beef and cabbage for St Patrick's Day dinner! Cooked it on a pizza stone and the texture was amazing a great crust on the outside and firm but moist inside.

This bread is so good and easy to make! We added raisins and some brown sugar to the top. If the author of this recipe (MP Welty) can email me at Fan5@aol.com, I'd appreciate it. My daughter, who has special needs, made a video of her making this Irish Soda Bread for her Foods class in high school. It was a hit, and I'm sure she'd love to see it. 
Thank you!
Megan Anthony

I've wanted to try making Irish soda bread for several years now.  This past St. Patty's day I finally did.  This recipe is very easy and good just as it is.  I think I will take others suggestion and add raisins next time.  It is a very dense bread, though.  A little goes a long way.

Delicious!  Easy (don't let the kneading scare you away - think of it like playing with playdough) and perfect for dinner or with your tea.  I basted it three times with the buttermilk/butter mixture throughout the cooking time (baked at 350 and for about 10-15 mins longer) and sprinkled with sugar each time.  This resulted in a crisp and sweet crust.  Raisins would be an excellent addition.

This was so good. Not sure how authentic it is as it doesn't taste like any I've tried but I think it tastes better!  I used butter instead of margarine and mixed it in the kitchenaid. Tried to knead it but the dough didn't stick together very well and a lot of flour was left in the bottom of the mixer bowl. Stuck it together as best I could and it turned out great!

I had tried making Irish soda bread before, once or twice (I can't remember!) and it didn't turn out well at all.  Despite being part Irish, I didn't know exactly what it was supposed to be like, even after an unimpressive purchased loaf.  Reading enough of these recipes, though, and seeing the photos, I got a pretty good idea.
I made half the recipe and used butter and my KitchenAid.  No work at all, beautiful looking, baked perfectly and smells wonderful.  I think the KitchenAid helped the overall result, kneading it till it was smooth and somewhat elastic. My oven runs a little hot so I set it for 350°, but it was looking about done after half an hour, so I think cooking it at a lower temp like some people have said sounds wise, though it was perfectly cooked.  I think it turned out as good as soda bread could possibly be.  I prefer bread to be a little less like biscuits or cake, but it's delicious, fine textured and not too crumbly.

Nice crust. Had to cook for about 60-70 mins minutes. I did brush the butter/buttermilk on every 10 mins so this may be the reason for the extended baking time.

Made this for St. Patricks Day.  It was ok but I won't make it again.  My dough seemed dry and I didn't think the loaf would ever finish baking.  Easy to make, I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer, I was hoping for old fashioned flavor and was disappointed with the end result.

I have successfully made a lot of breads over the years.  But this one did not turn out at all, even though I followed the directions to the letter.  First, it was very dry and crumbly, and it refused to stay together.  Next, when I finally did get it to form into a dough and started baking it, I found that the outside burned while the inside was raw...and I do mean raw.  I even tried to cook it an additional 20 mins when I discovered it was still raw dough in the center, and that didn't work.  Sadly, this recipe will never be attempted again.  So not easy to do!

So good and so easy.  If you have a stand mixer, use it and you will not have to knead the bread at all.  I pressed the round down just slightly before baking to ensure it cooked through all the way.  Definitely keep brushing on the buttermilk/butter periodically during cooking.  It makes the crust come out nice and golden.  Everyone loved it.

This didn't work for me at all. After 45 minutes baking the outside was done nicely, but the inside (probably half of the loaf) was gooey and completely un-baked.  Unfortunately this ended up being inedible.

The flavor was lovely.  I wish I'd followed another reviewer's advice and lowered the oven temperature.  The outside was super crusty, bordering on burnt, and the inside was really dense and moist.  I flattened the dough down a bit before baking so it wasn't such a round shape, but I think it needed more than that to get an even bake.  Will probably try again, but using a lower temp.

This recipe turned out great.  Other recipes I looked at had two cups of buttermilk with less flour.  Never made this before so maybe I'll try another to compare them.  Will make this again for sure!

I've made this recipe several times, and it generally makes a pretty good loaf of dense, slightly sweet bread. I have made the recipe as-is for St Patrick's Day, but most of the time, I substitute 1 or 2 cups of the white flour with whole wheat flour, and sometimes add raisins. I usually skip the basting with melted butter part, although I will brush a little buttermilk on top just before baking if I have any left over. Highly recommend!

Nice flavor, not very sweet, a little crumbly.  Used butter instead of margarine and cut the butter into the flour mixture before adding egg and buttermilk. 2T butter/buttermilk was plenty for brushing over top.  Good, quick bread, but not particularly amazing.

This was fantastic for a St. Patty's Day bread! Loved it. I baked mine in a stone pan at 350 for 65 mins and it was perfect. 50 mins wasn't long enough. Also sprinkled some sugar on top for sweetness. I added 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup, too. I let my bread sit for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven to let the baking soda and powder sit. Yummy!

This recipe is very easy.  My only change was to use butter instead of margarine.  The taste was also better the next day.

Much better than the other recipes we've made before.  Very moist, not dry at all.  I basted with the milk/butter every ten minutes.  Love it as is.

Delicious! Slightly sweet with a crisp outer shell and soft, fluffy inside.

Made this to go with the Irish Stew I was making for my St Patty's Day party.  Was a hit.  Everyone loved it.  Used my KitchenAid with a dough hook to mix and was so easy to make.

This was my first time to make Irish Soda Bread.  it was an easy recipe but I suggest you make two loaves from this recipe,  not one because it was too large and the middle didn't get cooked thoroughly.  Otherwise it was delicious and I added raisins.

Very easy recipe and quite tasty. I love how it can be completely made in one bowl. I didn't have to knead the dough on the counter as it mixes extremely well right from the bowl you use. 
I hadn't made an Irish Soda bread before but I will continue to make this one in the future. I used the buttermilk because I hadn't cooked with it before but will use the usual substitutes in the future so that I can make this bread whenever I want. A modification that I plan to do in the future is to add grated cheese and garlic for a different flavour. It won't be Irish but I think it will turn out quite well.

I followed recipe exactly as written so I could give a "true" review. I absolutely love this bread!! I can only imagine that adding a few different ingredients like raisins would enhance the flavor. But just try it as is, it's truly delicious. Thank you for the recipe

This recipe is so easy! I love making it to go along with a soup, stew, or chili. Something juicy to dip it in. Yum! Once I didn't have any regular sugar so I used brown sugar and it tuned out just as tasty as it did with white sugar. Again, Yum!!

The flavor was good, but I think I undercooked it or should have flattened it more because the middle was really doughy.  Will try again though.

DELICIOUS!  This was amazingly easy just as its title says.  The only thing I changed was that I put lemon juice into regular milk to make "buttermilk."  This bread was a big hit at the meeting I made it for.  Thank you for a great, easy, and fast bread recipe!

I made it for St. Pat's Day and I loved it.  I definitely would advise to add the raisins and maybe some dried cranberries.  My kids just broke it off in chunks & ate it throughout the day.

Really easy and a great bread to compliment Irish Stew.  However, I found it to be a little dry and crrumbly.  I'll adjust the flour/liquid ratio when I next make this bread.

I've never made Irish Soda Bread, but this turned out delicious.  Made it to go with an Irish stew.  Dry, but still moist inside.  I love the crunchy exterior.  The only thing I didn't do was brush the buttermilk/butter on the outside of the bread, I just did melted butter.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

I feel bad for giving this bread a bad review because of all of the good reviews. 

Maybe I just don't know what Irish soda bread is supposed to be like. If it's supposed to be like a dry, crumbly, biscuit-type bread, then this recipe has hit the mark and I'm just not a fan.

This is the second time I've made it, thinking I must have missed something the first time, but it's still as dry and crumbly as ever.

I needed something for a last-minute St. Patrick's Day get-together, and the host was making stew - soda bread seemed a natural fit. I'd had it in Irish pubs, but never made it myself. This recipe was truly "amazingly easy" - I had the ingredients on hand, didn't change a thing (except to use parchment paper instead of grease on the baking sheet), and it turned out perfectly. The texture and flavor were just as I remembered, and everyone loved it! Tthe entire loaf was gone within 30 minutes.

This recipe came out great.  I have had Irish soda bread before but it has always been dry.  This was not dry at all.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The only change I will make the next time I prepare this bread is to make less of the butter/buttermilk mixture for brushing on the bread.  I brushed the bread several times but still had quite a bit of the mixture left over.  Nex time I will cut these amounts in half.  Thanks for a great and very easy recipe.

WOW, this was the easiest and tastiest bread recipe I've ever made!  Thick, hearty, and delicious.  I didn't change anything in the recipe except a few extra oats, and I made 2 loaves instead of 4, and it filled my kitchen with a heavenly aroma and I couldn't help but tear off a hunk of the crispy outer edge and eat it hot from the oven.  I made this to complement my St. Patrick's Day stew, and it was a HUGE hit.  My father doesn't even like brown bread and he gobbled it up.  I served it with an herb butter (just mixed in a bit of dried parsley and basil, salt, and pepper into the butter) and brushed a wee bit over the top right when I served it.  Oh MYLANTA, it was amazing.  I am actually making more right this afternoon it's in such demand!

i used a stand up mixer the dough was crumbly and kept its shape. But when it went it into the oven it deflated and became more of a sweetened dessert than a bread.

This was a fantastic recipe! I've tried making soda bread before and it came out either gummy or very dry. I think the basting really added a lot.

I made this (for Thai friends who had never heard of St Patricks Day!) today-- followed another reviewers suggestion to use 3 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat...also used butter (not margarine) and 1 cup yogurt (no buttermilk available here) and soaked the raisins in orange juice for about 30 minutes before mixing in. Was a hit and I will make it again!

Just made this for St Patrick's Day & it was a huge hit! I took an earlier suggestion and lowered temp to 350 and baked for an hour, basting every 20 min.  When it came out of the oven, I covered it with a dish towel while I finished up all the other dishes.  I was nice and crusty on top and so soft inside, with just a hint of sweetness.  Delicious!

I just made this tonight while the http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Slow-Cooker-Corned-Beef-and-Cabbage was in the Crock Pot!!!  It was perfect.  I used 6 Tbsp. sugar and added golden raisins, as I know I like a sweeter loaf.  It took mine an hour and I tented it with foil towards the end.  I WILL be keeping this as my go to recipe!

I have been making Soda Bread every St Patrick's Day for years and wondering why they... or I... bothered. Unlike past recipes, this one is moist and flavorful. Why wait until March 17 to make it again?!It is truly delicious!

Easy and delicious. Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. I should have baked it a little longer because the very center was a little "doughy", but we ate it anyway because it was so good!

Love how easy and delicious this was! Came together quickly and easily and the flavor was divine. Much better than the sickly sweet store bought loaf we tried recently. This came out with a nice crust and soft, squishy bread inside.

I have never eaten soda bread so I wasn't sure how it's supposed to taste. It turned out to be like a giant biscuit. Bread was tasty and a little crumbly.

Only problem I had was that the recipe had too much flour. To keep the dough sticking together, add a little under 1/4 cup extra buttermilk.

This is the first bread that I have ever made and I am so excited about the results I just had to write a review! While it was a little time consuming for me, I'm sure it would be a breeze for the more experienced baker. The ending product was worth the time! A moist inside surrounded by a wonderfully buttery crust... yumm. I added 3 extra coats of the butter/buttermilk combination while it was baking and it was just fantastic.

The family devoured the whole loaf last night.  It was kind of like a giant biscuit. It was easy to make.  I used a pastry blender to cut in the butter.  I basted the loaf about every 15 minutes until all the buttermilk and butter mixture was gone.  My only suggestion is not to make it too thick in the middle because it took about an hour to cook.  Maybe 2- 2 1/2" high.  I will definitely make again!

I felt like it was kind of dry. I may use more buttermilk next time. Also I left the raisons out thinking of the kids, but I will definently put them in next time!  
It is a very easy recipe and still tasted good. I will make a few changes and try it again!

I loved this so much. Huge hit at the St. Patrick's Day pot luck. It's a little sweeter than soda breads I've had in the past, but I thought that just made it better. Didn't change a thing and it came out perfect. Cook time was 50 minutes with checking every 5 minutes the last 20 minutes. Maybe next time I will add a half cup or so of raisins too!

Very easy, good recipe. I used slightly more buttermilk than was called for, but it was a dry day here. Came out beautiful. Nice crust, inside was moist. Good flavor all around. When you make the 'X' in the crust, lightly score it - making a deep cut will have it pull very far apart as it's baking.

I made this yesterday and was pleased with the result. If you're expecting a bread that is very much like a giant scone, then this is the recipe for you. It was a nice accompaniment to the Irish stew I served. The only modifications I made were to use butter in place of margarine and an extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk to help the dough stick together. As with scones, I think one of the keys to success is MINIMAL mixing/kneading. It will look VERY rough when you put it in the oven, not smooth and shiny like a yeast dough. Also, I baked it at 375 for 10 min. and 350 for the remaining 35 min. I'd likely make it again.

This turned out pretty good for my first try at bread! I divided it into 2 loaves I added a handful of raisins to one, and a handful of rye flour to the other! TASTY!!! Will surely make again!

Just made it - My oven, it took 40 Min., although the tester came out dry after 30 Min. Really moist, though I did add an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I mixed lemon extract with milk instead of buttermilk. I also added white raisins. As suggested, I basted the top of the bread every 10 Min - Crust is crispy - FABULOUS

This is a good recipe. It was a bit dry when I made it. I did not add the buttermilk and butter to the top-instead I put flour on top like other recipes I've seen. The flavor was out of this world!

I dont think I did anything wrong because this was "amazingly easy" and it looked just like the picture but this was also amazingly bland.  Maybe I expected more flavor because we eat a lot of beer bread...  I hate to say that because Im even Irish!  Soda bread just wasnt a recipe that was handed down in our family so maybe I was just expecting the wrong thing.

This recipe is a bit better than Nana Dot's (which is also very good). I believe this is due to the addition of the egg. I add 1/2 c. raisins and 1 tsp caraway seeds per c. of flour which makes it a lot better.

Great recipie! I swapped the butter with a small can of tuna and replaced 2 of the flours with wholemeal and instead of butter milk I used some left over red wine I had lying about - will make again, thank you.

Im used to a slightly sweeter and denser irish soda bread, where as this was more on the bread side, but I definitely can't say it was bad..looks beautiful too.

This was the first time I've had Irish Soda Bread, so I'm not sure how it was supposed to taste. This came out like a cross between bread and a biscuit. It's good, but not terribly healthy so I'm not sure I'd make it again for that reason; it'd probably be easier just to make biscuits. As previous posters suggested, cooking it at a lower heat for longer might be better; my bread was done on the outside, but inside was little doughy for my taste (but still good). I didn't have buttermilk, so I stirred 1T lemon juice into 1c milk and let it sit for 5 min before adding to the dough. Didn't seem to hurt it at all. Also used butter because I didn't have any margarine; not sure how much of a difference that made.

Very easy to make and came out really good. I had trouble with my batch being super dry and hard to knead, but the end result was still soft. I used just melted butter on the outside as well for a richer more biscuit-like flavor.

Very easy and tastes just like the irish soda bread I used to get at an irish tearoom. I also added about 1/2 cup of golden raisins. **If you've never made this before, it will look cracked and sorta dry. The cracks are normal - it gives it creases. Just trust the recipe, stick it in the oven, and enjoy the yummy bread that comes out!

This bread is yummy! I scaled down the recipe and it still turned out marvelously! It reminds me of beer battered bread they serve in nicer steak houses. It is good with honeybutter as well. Will bake again!

Quite good. I probably would have given it 5 stars, but I ended up tweaking a recipe I found on another site and rewrote it and have fallen in love with that one.  This does make a very nice bread, I did add a cup of raisins (soaked to plump) Lowered the temp to 350, and the bottoms still tend to overcook, haven't found a cure for that as yet with any soda bread. Please do take the time to baste this every ten minutes while it is baking, makes a lovely crust that is well worth the effort. Delicious right out of the oven and up to three days later.

THIS BREAD WAS DELICIOUS, BUT IT DIDN'T COOK THRU. I TESTED IT, AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. I EVEN BAKED IT 5 MINS LONGER THEN CALLED FOR.  BUT THE OUTTER PCS WERE TERRIFIC. I JUST PUT THE WHOLE THING BACK IN THE OVEN (A DAY LATER) AND BAKED IT ANOTHER 25 MINS. THAT'S WHY I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS. BUT I WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN, AND BAKE IT ABOUT 25 MINS LONGER.

I took other reviewer's suggestions: used 1 cup wheat flour and 3 cups all-purp and added lots of raisins that I soaked for a few mintues in warm vanilla extract (those got plumped up and yummy). Turned out slightly dry and crumbly, not sure what I did wrong, but otherwise quite delicious for my first try!

Made this for St. Patty's Day this year.  It really is very easy to make in the Kitchen Aid.  I kneaded mine a little longer than "slightly".  One of the more moist Irish Soda Breads I've had which is why I'm not normally a fan, however my girlfriend said it is one of the best she has ever eaten.

Amazingly delicious! I tried this bread at a party and tracked down the baker & then the recipe to this website.  Hands down, it is the best soda bread I've ever had.  Most Irish soda breads are too dry, but this recipe has a some moisture to it, while still retaining a soda bread character. Add raisins for additional sweetness.

I needed a quick notice bread for a group--everyone loved it!  We ate it with a bean soup/chili and it worked well.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I made sour milk (2 c milk and 3-4 t vinegar) which was a good substitute.  I also rubbed the top of the bread with the butter/milk suggestion but also threw in an egg white to make it shiny.  Great recipe!

This was the first time that I've ever made bread of any sort and it was, indeed, very easy. The only issue that I had was that the bottom of my bread burned pretty badly. I knew it was burning, as I was checking every 10 minutes to brush with butter/buttermilk, however the middle was still not cooked so I had to keep it in the oven. We just scraped the bottom off and enjoyed the rest of the very tasty bread. I don't, however, fault the recipe, as my oven is VERY old and always heats things a little differently. In the future, (and I will definitely be making this again in the future!) I will try breaking the dough up into two loaves so that hopefully the bottom will be as beautiful as the top.

Very easy and tasty.  The only thing I would change is a little more kneading.  My loaf, while it tasted delicious, ended up a little on the ugly side.

Made this for St. Patrick's day and it was very good. Got a "delicious" from my boyfriend! Thanks

Update: I have been making this for several years now on St. Patrick's Day and it turns out great every time!! Had to use "homemade" buttermilk (4.5 tbsp lemon juice in 1 cup milk) and it worked great. Won't use another recipe for soda bread

mine looked exactly like the picture and turned out great after i took the advice of reviewers. i used my K/A mixer to knead and i cooked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 mins, which included heat lost the 3 times i opened the oven door to baste w/ butter mixture. it really tasted like a giant biscuit with a wonderful crust and it was very moist. this was delicious with corned beef and cabbage. i kept the leftovers in a tupperware cake carrier and it stayed moist. the next day i made Clam Chowder Canadian Military Style to go with the leftovers. i will definitely make this again

I've never made bread before and this was super easy and turned out perfectly!  I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for ground flax seed to add a little nutrition...it turned out beautiful!

I followed the recipe but this just did not turn out well for me.  The exterior was really crumbly and it took a lot longer to cook even though I preheated the oven and cut a deep cross in it.  I followed the recipe, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I don't make much bread, but I've made other soda bread recipes and some have turned out better for me.  I have been to Ireland and this wasn't really much like anything I had over there.  Still, I gave it 3 stars because people at my party still said they liked it, not sure if they were just being nice or what, but it was bareable I guess.

OMG! This was so easy to make. My three year old did most of the work. It paired perfectly with my corned beef n cabbage. I did have to decrease the temp and baked for 1hr (the outside was starting to burn and the center was still doughy). My Irish plumber even had a piece, and loved it. Thanks for the recipe! Will make again.

They aren't kidding, this really is an easy bread recipe. I followed the recipe for the most part, only using butter instead of marg. and added raisons. It was very easy to mix, not sticky at all. I split the dough into two round loafs instead of 1 big one, simply because I wanted a loaf at both ends of the table for guests. Friends snacked on the bread even after dinner was over! You won't miss with this recipe.

Wow how could anything be so simple and taste so good!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk with lemon juice (1 1/4 cups milk + 4 teaspoons of lemon juice).

Turned out a big crumbly, maybe that is how the texture should be.  The kids and I really liked it, my husband was not a fan.  We used cranberries instead adding the traditional raisins and they were a nice addition.

Simple, basic, rises well, good flavor. However, I found it a little dry when mixing. YES, I measured everything accurately and included all ingredients. I was having a hard time getting the dough to form a ball so I added dribs and drabs of extra buttermilk until I got the consistency I wanted, which was the consistency of biscuit dough. Once that was achieved, the dough kneaded easily and baked beautifully. I did brush it with buttermilk and butter and it had a great crust. Bread was dense, moist and very flavorful. Will make again.

This was my first time making Irish Soda Bread and I'm happy I did!  Myself and family enjoyed; I was surprised as to the moistness as I was expecting a dense, drier bread.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find a moist, slightly sweet dinner bread to accompany corned beef, parsnips, turnips and carrots.  Thanks for a lovely recipe!

This was so good!  Mixed it in my KitchenAid mixer; quick and easy prep.  I added a large handful of raisins and baked for a full hour.  The buttermilk/butter mixture to brush before baking was a little too much.  And it made a mess of my pan.  But it was worth the mess.  My family loved it!

I've made a lot of things on here that got bad reviews and worked for me. I could not get this to come together. It is breaking apart in the oven right now. Since I was not prepared for this I have resorted to making "Irresistable Irish Soda Bread" and that is waiting to go in the oven. Plus it has no kneading and is much more moist already. I will not try this again.

Excellent! Easy! My dough was quite crumbly before kneading...but all came together nicely without adding extra liquid. Took the advice to lower temp and add cooking time, also added golden raisins while kneading - glad I did. This is an "amazingly easy" bread that I will make again.

Not a true soda bread.  Too wet, too sweet and too messy.  As soon as the bread was put in the oven, it spread out like a pancake and made a mess.

At first, seeing this, it reminded me of a very large biscuit.  However, the taste of this bread is just simply amazing!  Great with corned beef and cabbage or soup.  I also used my kitchen aid to incorporate all of the ingredients and it made making this recipes a snap. Definitely going to make again!

This turned out good, I just didn't personally care for it. It reminded me a lot of cornbread in consistency, and I think that's why I didn't really like it. But it was super easy to make and I'm sure I would have loved it if it were a different consistency...

This was a good recipe -- I would call it easy, not amazingly easy!  The dough is crumbly and does take a bit of time to knead together and shape.  I used butter instead of margarine, and baked on a baking stone, using parchment paper underneath.  Very yummy!

5 stars for the ease really! I used 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and rest all purpose. Used blueberry flavored kefir instead of buttermilk.

Oh goodness. I have been making soda bread using this recipe since I was about ten. When I went off to college, I lost the recipe. I just found it today and cannot wait! to make more! It is always a HUGE hit with friends and family. I top with a strawberry jam (i slice strawberries and cook them in sugar for about 30 minutes) or just butter. yummm! Can't wait for my boyfriend to try it for the first time :)

So easy to make and soooooooo good. I halved the recipe ( using a whole egg and adding a couple of tablespoons of flour) thinking it would be plenty for just my husband and me..Next time I'll definitely make the whole amount. I took the bread out of the oven 15mins ago and it is already gone...Will be making again!!!!

I made this tonight to serve with turkey and vegetable soup.  It's a really great recipe!  My whole family reallyenjoyed it.  I only made a few minor changes: 1) I halved the recipe, but used a whole egg and a TB or two of extra flour 2)Honey instead of sugar 3) For the glaze I used one egg white beaten with 2 TB of melted margarine.  I baked at 350 for about 28 minutes and coverd it with foil while it was cooling.  PERFECT!  Even better with a little honey drizzled on top.

The soda bread was good, but it tasted very similar to the southern biscuit.  It was good for what it was , but biscuits are much better.  I believe I will try using a biscuit recipe next time and make one huge biscuit.

This is fantastic. Beware: it does come out with a slightly dry and crumbly crust, but that is just to soak up the delicious corned beef & cabbage juice! It has a wonderful flavor that gets rave reviews every time I make it.  The only thing that I disagree with is the "servings: 20" part.  It is a dense loaf, but I'm not sure 20 servings is accurate. The pieces would be awfully small and that would not cut it for this yummy recipe!

I made this Irish Soda Bread to accompany my St. Patrick's Day dinner this year.  This was also the first time I have made my own and let me tell you, I will NEVER buy another one at the grocery store again!  This truly was amazingly easy!  I followed everything as stated EXCEPT I did add about 1 cup of raisins (personal preference) and I did need more flour when kneading because dough was a tad to sticky to work with, but again, I have never done this before so I chalk that up to my inexperience in bread making.  It was so sweet and delicious!  An egg wash on the top midway through baking gave it a nice glaze on top and this bread was gone by the next day! (4 of us eating)  This one is definitely a keeper!

Delicious and very easy to make. Everyone liked it and the leftovers the next day with cheddar cheese melted on top were divine. I will definitely make this again - maybe adding some herbs on occasion - sage or rosemary would be good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my Irish husband on St. Patrick's Day, and it was a HUGE hit.  He's hoping we don'thave to wait until next St. Patrick's Day to have it again!  This recipe is so simple and easy to make, yet it tastes like something fresh out of an awesome bakery.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  This Irish soda bread really IS easy to make and it tastes superb!  It's my favorite bread to make because it takes little prep time and cooks beautifully in the oven.  I agree with other reviewers that this needs to be cooked longer with less heat.  It gives the bread a great crusty exterior without burning the bottom.

I make an authentic Irish dinner every St. Patricks day with lamb and potatoe leek soup(found on this sight)and this is by far the best soda bread recipe I've tried. I use real butter in the dough, and I cut it into the dry ingrediants with a pastry cutter, That's the only change and it comes out great every time- very moist.Great recipe!

I have made an Irish dinner for St. Patrick's day for years now and this is the BEST Soda Bread I have ever made.  It has a wonderful flavor and a great texture and is good hot from the oven or cool the next day.  I added some currants to mine and it was good that way, but I know it would be good without them, too!!

I really liked the flavor of this bread. It was easy to make. I basted it every 10 minutes.  I checked it at 40 minutes and my utensil came out clean. I served it and found the middle to be very undone. I think I should've flattened it out more before cooking and let it cook for at least 50-60 minutes. We were able to eat the outsides of the slices of bread, but the entire center was a waste.

It was nice to try this new recipe to celebrate St. Patty's Day.  I didn't have buttermilk or what I needed to make a proper substitute, so I used 1% milk and it still had a great texture.  Next time I will try it with raisins for additional flavor.

Used butter instead of margarine.  Otherwise followed this recipe exactly as written and it came out beautiful.  Would highly recommend anyone to try it.  My whole family loved it!!  Next time I'm going to try substituting 1c whole wheat flour as others suggested.

Fantastic!  It really is amazingly easy.  I am a terrible baker but this bread came out perfectly.  It was a big hit with my Guinness Stew.  Thank you for the recipe!
EDIT::  Had to add, just made this a second time, and once again, it is stunning and so easy.  GREAT flavor, slightly sweet, and perfect texture.  LOVE this!

I tried this recipe as a last-minute addition to our annual St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I am so glad we did!  It was absolutely delicious--tastes like a huge, buttery, moist biscuit.  Mmmmm...  Next time I will be sure to be more diligent about basting the loaf with the butter/buttermilk mixture as it bakes.  Mine got a little bit too crusty for our taste.

This soda bread was wonderful. The whole family loved it. I made it as written but used butter instead of margarine and baked in at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. This is not made with yeast so it won't have the texture of a "bread" but more like a biscuit. It's suppose to be like that.

I have never had soda bread before and this was a great surprise. I don't know how I did'nt see sugar in the recipe but I did'nt and so mine did'nt have any sugar!!It tasted like a giant moist buttermilk biscuit. I'm glad I did'nt add sugar . It was delicous with corned beef and cabbage. It makes wonderful toast the next day,

The best Irish Soda bread I have ever had! Used butter instead of margarine (since its all I had), added 1/2 cup of raisins to the dough during the final stages in the Kitchenaid, upped the sugar to a little more than 1/4 cup, and added an extra splash of buttermilk. Didn't grease the cookie sheet but used parchment paper (which created a nice light brown bottom). Basted 3 times, sprinkling granulated sugar each time, over 55 minutes with the oven at 350. Produced the most beautiful bread that was moister than most breads I have had, but still with a biscuit texture and slightly sweet with a great crust! A favorite and keeper for sure!

First time I have ever made Irish Soda Bread, it turned out beautifully and was easy and tasted fantastic.  I used butter instead of margerine and basted with butter only.

Yum! I needed a last minute recipe to make to go with a dinner I was taking to a friend. This was the first one that popped up when I opened All Recipes, and I had all of the ingredients so I went for it. I made a batch and a half (so I could make 2 smaller loaves, one for our family and one for theirs), and didn't have quite enough regular flour so I used some whole wheat - other than that I followed the directions exactly and divided into 2 loaves. Oh - I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a conversion of milk & vinegar to make "my own" buttermilk. They came out GREAT and even my picky eater gobbled it up. The friend that I delivered dinner to liked it too (or at least she was polite and said she did, LOL).

For all the reviews, I thought this would be ambrosia, but only 1 out of 4 thought it was good and that was the "carb kid." The rest of us thought it was a strange mix of flavors, not quite melding: a bit "sour," sweet and bland. It was easy to make and I followed the recipe to the tee. I don't even think it would have been improved with dried fruit.

This was really tasty with some dried mixed berries mixed in! Without the fruit I'm not sure I'd have been so crazy about it, but I can see lots of possibilities, I just love the texture! I did not remove mine from the bowl to knead it--I just mixed it up a bit by hand & shaped it into a loaf. I also did not baste it with butter during the cooking process but probably will next time as I think extra buttery flavor can only be a plus! As suggested by another reviewer, I used a lower oven temp (350) and checked it at 40 minutes--that is when it was done for me but then again, I had kind of flattened mine out a bit to encourage a quicker cook time :) I will definitely be making this again!

Four stars for taste and ease, minus one for not really being a traditional Soda Bread.  This is really a giant scone.  (don't get me wrong, I love scones, but I wanted to make bread).  I have a recipe for Brunch Scones, I think it's from this site, and while I was making it, the ingredients did sound rather familiar, as was the consistency of the dough when I turned it out.  It was very easy and delicious though, so I'm in a forgiving mood.

Great recipe!  If you want to cut down calories in this recipe, you can replace the sugar with Stevia Extract in the Raw.  A zero calorie all natural sweetener.

The dough seemed dry when I was kneeding it, but it turned out okay.  I did have some trouble with the bread not being fully cooked, but that could by my OLD oven.

Would have been a 4*. My oven temperature isn't very dependable. Someone had said lower the temp and cook a little longer so I tried to get the oven to 350 F. and baked the bread a little longer. Neverthe less, at the 50 min mark, I stuck in the toothpick and it came out clean. Bread was done (no uncooked dough), but bread was dryer than it should have been, (crumbled instead of cut by knife). People still commented on how good it >tasted

I followed the recipe except added finely grated cheddar cheese to the mixture.  I placed the patted down circle of bread in a pam sprayed cake pan.  It made a circular loaf with a little peak of goldend brown goodness.  I served it for a dinner party and we couldn't get enough.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.

I don't know what I did, but I wound up buring the HECK out of this bread.  But after I cut off all the burned parts, the inside was fine... and DELICIOUS!  I'm definitely going to try it again, and try to figure out why it burned... it's more than worth it.

My daughter and I made this for the first time recently and it turned out wonderful!  It was very easy to make.
The texture of the bread was like a really good biscuit.  The next time I have a crowd for breakfast I will definitely make this recipe.

Really good. I was nervous when I put it in the oven, because it was so crumbly and would barely stay together. However, I based it several times throughout with the butter mixture, and I think that is what moistened it. I've never had soda bread before this, but this recipe was yummy and very easy!

This was SO easy!  I used half whole wheat flour, half white to boost the nutrition.  This bread has a delicious flavor and a crunchy crust, and I literally whipped it up in the time it took water to boil!  It would be a super homemade bread to make when entertaining.

The coating seemed to cause the top of the loaf to brown rather more than the rest. Giving it a slightly charred look. 

However it was very tasty and as close as I could remember. Will definitely make it again!

This bread is very tasty. It is a bit denser than I thought it would be. I might eliminate the sugar the next time that I make it so that it would pair up better with savory foods. I will definitely make it again.

I added a 1/2 cup of raisins, and it turned out great!  I also tried reducing the butter by 1 Tbsp, but I feel like it actually needed the extra moisture for the kneading process.  It stull turned out great, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not Irish Soda bread.  It tasted fine as my guests were fine with it but I was expecting something different than a great big buiscut.

So good! We didn't change a thing in the recipe and absolutely loved the results. We baked the loaf on a stonewear sheet for around 45 minutes. This one's a definite keeper.

Rich, dense, delicious bread that takes about 10 mins to mix up and 45 mins to bake!  An excellent companion to corned beef and cabbage, a nice soup/stew, or even spaghetti!  I made this twice, and found what changes I wanted the second go round.  I left out 1 tbsp of sugar and increased the salt to 1 tsp, to make it less sweet.  I also turned down the oven temperature to 350, but still cooked it only 45 mins.  I only brushed the bread with the butter/milk mixture once, but will do it more next time.  Lastly, I cooked it on a baking stone and got a more tender bottom crust than on a regular baking pan.

I made this for our St. Patrick's Day dinner tonight and it was wonderful... crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I followed another reader's suggestion and cut the butter in with two knives. In the spirit of St Patrick's Day, I added about 20 drops of green food coloring to the liquid before adding it to the dry ingredients and the result was a spectacular loaf of emerald green bread.  Everyone LOVED it :-)

Made for St. Patrick's Day meal. Prepared as decribed. Came out well. Of course, soda bread is naturally a bit dry. Nice change adding authenticity to our meal.

Everything Irish soda bread should be!  I used lowfat buttermilk and about a cup of raisins (not presoaked or anything).  Taking the advise of other members, I baked for 60 min at 350.  This was just right.  I think the topping and "basting" as the loaf bakes really adds something.  The crust has a flavor of its own.

3 stars for ease.  1 star for taste.  This is not Irish Bread.  I kept thinking something was very wrong with it.  Not enough sweet, lack of raisins.  I read reviews after and wished I'd read them before.  One large biscuit is right.

I wanted to bake something for work for St. Patty's Day.  Found this recipe and tried it first for a family function and it was a hit.  I made two batches for work, brought it in and all day people have come back two, three times for more!  I've received high praise for this and it has been requested for future events.  Thanks for the recipe!

I originally gave this recipe 4 stars but three days after baking a loaf I have to bump it up to a five. It almost seems to taste better each time I slice it thick, toast it and then put a thin layer of butter on. I recommend that you put about 3/4 cup raisins as others have and also baste it every 15 mins as suggested. Yum!

I agree with several others who found it to be tasty and more like a biscuit than authentic irish soda bread.  

It was certainly easy to make and clean up after.

I'm looking forward to making modifications next time.  I took some suggestions to cook it at 350 for 45 minutes but ended up going 350 for 55 mintues.  In hindsight, I probably could have let it go for a full hour.

For traditional Irish soda bread, I would've given this recipe one star.....but for the recipe that it is, I'm giving it four stars.  It is fantastic!!! The other ratings are right:  This tastes like a giant biscuit.  But, it REALLY tastes great!  I added 2 more tablespoons of sugar, and I sprinkled a little more sugar on top after each basting as other ratings suggested.  My husband LOVES Irish soda bread and said, "It's not what I'm used to, but it's tasty."  So....we had biscuit slices with our corned beef and cabbage. :)

Went well with lamb stew.  We had never had this type of bread before, so we did not know what to expect.  It basically tasted like a huge biscuit.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be, but it was a little unexpected to us.

After constantly brushing it with the buttermilk mixture, it created a crunchy outer crust which was very tasty. Unfortunately, my husband is from Ireland and although he said it was good, it did not really taste like proper  soda bread. It was more like a giant biscuit.

This recipe is awesome!!! I made a loave as part of a Thanksgiving bread basket, people were taking it home in doggie bags because it was so good. UPDATE: I made it again, and it is just as delicious as it was on 11/24/2007

Fantastic recipe.  Husband says it's more like a scone though.  We love it regardless!  Only problem I have is that it disappears so quickly :(

Great recipe it is indeed amazingly easy and amazingly delicious.  I use this bread as a side to complete a nice cheesy potato soup dish. The sweetness of the soda bread is a great compliment to the salty flavor of the cheese.

This is an excellent soda bread.  I would suggest that you prepare it in the food processor with the dough blade to make it as easy as possible.  I added a cup of raisins at the very last mix.  You can also substitute kefir if you don't have buttermilk available.

There is too much flour and not enough buttermilk/eggs, resulting in a dry, dense, bland soda bread. The crust has an excellent crispy texture, but that is the only part I found edible.

Yum!  Made this tonight w/corned beef and cabbage.  This was definitely the best part of the meal.  I used butter in place of the margarine, and it worked fine. Slightly sweet and scone-like.  The crust was great. 

I am tempted to make this again with some dried fruit mixed in, and coarse sugar on top which would be even more scone-like.  Can't wait to have it toasted for breakfast!

I gave the recipe 4 instead of 5 because it came out very crumbly and was difficult to mold into a round, and difficult to cut. Maybe it was my fault (this was the second bread I've ever made, and the first was made about an hour before this one!) but in any event, it tasted great and went very fast after dinner! I think it's worth making again to see if I can make it better, especially because it went over so well with our company.

Pretty good bread. Very moist, sweet, reminded me of a biscuit (I'd never had Irish soda bread before). I cooked it a little longer b/c the middle seemed doughy even though a fork came out clean. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Didn't bother to brush (or in my case spoon) the buttermilk/butter mixture more than twice.  I would definitely make this again.

Fast and delicious!  I also used 3/4c whole wheat flour and 3 1/4 white.  My 4 year old said he wanted to eat "the whole lump of it"!  I shaped it in rounded loaf shape like Hawaiian bread and had no problems with it not being done in the middle.

I did not like this recipe. It had a weird taste even though I added raisins. Used the bread machine and then baked in oven. My husband said he liked the pre made mix I bought in the store better. Will not make again.

Loved this recipe! I'd been looking for a soda bread recipe to compliment my own Guinness Stew recipe and this is the one! Also makes a great breakfast bread with butter and jam or just by itself. I used butter rather than margarine, which gave it an almost shortbread flavor. This recipe's definitely a keeper.

Great recipe! The dough wasn't staying together because there just wasn't enough liquid so I added about a tablespoon of water before kneading. I also basted it throughout, every 15 minutes. The family loved it. We spread jam and butter on top for breakfast. Next time I will try it with raisins.

I have never had authentic soda bread so I have no idea what it's supposed to taste like. Regardless, I loved it. So incredibly easy with minimal "kneading". I don't think  it resembles real laborious kneading like a yeast dough. You just need to push it together until it is slightly smooth to make sure no big lumps of flour remain uncombined. The finished product makes me think of a humongous biscuit. I did use butter instead of margarine because that's the only thing I had. I also used milk and vinegar in place of buttermilk, because I never have that in the house. When forming the ball of dough, I shaped it into a circular disk rather than a half sphere for fear that it would be difficult to cook if it was too thick. I did good because the leavening agents made it puff up in the oven so I ended up with a half sphere anyway.  I didn't bother brushing it with the butter and buttermilk mixture more than once as other popular recipes don't include this step.  Do let it cool completely before slicing as one should with any type of bread. So, so good!

Super easy to do (I used my stand mixer ) and my family scarfed up the entire loaf tin one day! Definitely will make this again and again.

Very easy to make. I have a mixer, but prefer to use my hands to make bread just took a bit longer for it to come together. Unfortunately the bread came out very tasteless and dry. My bread loving kids hated it. Won’t make again.

This came out really good. I used butter instead of  margarine. I also pitted / halved Fresh cherries and soaked them with raisins in cherry Brandi  with a shot of Cointreau for a half hour. Then Drained and added to dough.  Save the left over liquid for a dipping sauce later.  

One tip is when checking and basting rotate bread in oven for even cooking. Or the back of oven will hotter form less heat loss when opening the door. I learned the hard way.

Made it with powdered buttermilk rather than fresh. I think it changed the taste a little. Just like if you used powdered milk instead of whole milk. But still quite delicious when warm with melting butter.

Dense with a lovely flavor. I used milk with lemon juice added to substitute the buttermilk and it worked beautifully.  Went really well with meatloaf and gravy.

I made this vegan- substituting for the butter, margarine, substituting for buttermilk a mixture of lemon juice and coconut-almond milk, etc. - and this came out so moist and delicious! My family has asked for this bread every week! A real winner! Just delicious and moist!

This came out so good I made it a second time! The first time I did not brush the loaf after the initial brushing before popping it in the oven and it came out great. The second time I decided to brush it about every 15 minutes and it came out AMAZING! I recommend to keep applying the mixture if you are able to.

This is a delicious, lightly sweet bread with a nice crust. It was a little difficult to knead and wound up with sort of a lumpy looking  crust.  Other than the odd appearance it was enjoyed by all.

I made this for our VFW's St Patty's Day party. It was a huge hit and everyone loved it.  I made double batches of the recipe and made each double batch into 3 loaves. It was perfect! Put them all on 1 large baking sheet and baked for the recommended time. Really good!

I would suggest turning the oven to 360 and cooking about 40 minutes before checking with a toothpick to see if it comes out clean.  375 is too high leaving the outside really brown while the inside is still doughy.  Good taste and moist.

I made it with 2 cups of gluten free all-purpose flower and 2 cups of almond flower.  It didn't fluff up, of course. Everything else was the same. The result was excellent. Very good and simple recipe.

Made this for St Patrick's Day. This was my first time tasting or making Irish soda bread. It was a bit more cakey than I expected, but was good. I did change the margarine to unsalted butter and added some raisins to the dough as recommended in other reviews, and reduced the salt, but other than that I followed the recipe as provided.

Added 2/3 cup cold half & half and  1 teaspoon crushed caraway seeds. 
sift 3x dry ingredients to be sure everything is unclumped and well mixed.
Mix eggs, buttermilk and half/half to combine them all (be sure everything in really cold)
Mix dry ingredients with small cubes of cold butter, mix with dough blender to rice consistency. Add cold mix of eggs/milks and using the dough blender, mix rough. Meaning just enough to not have flour behind and it will be in big clumps. 
I divide this dough in 5, and made 5-6 rough balls that will become personal Irish Breads.

I wanted to find a recipe that was richer than the traditional recipe  I grew up with (plus, my old family recipe called for caraway seeds and I didn't want savory). The addition of butter  and sugar made all the difference for me.  I only handled it enough long enough to knead it a few times and to shape it. I made no changes and it came out perfect. This was exactly what I was looking for. I don't know if this was mentioned , but if you are lucky enough to have any left; get it  into a ziploc right away 'cause it will dry out fast.

I am not a baker by any stretch of the imagination.  If I can make this and  get great reviews for it, anybody can. Substituted one cup milk plus one tablespoon lemon juice for buttermilk. Kneaded in Kitchenaid stand mixer for about 3 mins.  Turned out onto lightly floured surface to finish.  Brushed top with melted butter and egg wash instead of the buttermilk.  Also as suggested, increased the sugar to four tablespoons. Will probably add five tablespoons next time. But excellent results and very easy to make.  Will make again very soon.

My first time to make Irish Soda Bread and I lucked out with this recipe.  Authentic or not, it was delicious!!!  My husband is still raving about it the next day.  To us, it's a cross between a scone and a biscuit.  In fact, we are going to use this recipe from now on for Strawberry Shortcakes.  Leftover made for a great breakfast bread the next morning with coffee.  I did have to add a little more buttermilk to the batter, but other than that, I made exactly to recipe.  Thanks so much, MP Welty, for making my first experience a great success!!

The recipe itself is fantastic.  If I make it again I'll flatten my loaf just a little bit.  It was so tall that it had a hard time cooking all the way through.

I have made this soda bread several times now, making a few (small) changes each time. It's a bit challenging to cook the inside thoroughly without burning the outside. Would definitely recommend the foil tip as well as turning down the oven a bit and cooking longer. Also, this Saint Patrick's Day I added more sugar as well as mixed some green sprinkles to the dough and also coated the top with them  for a very festive sweet bread :)

I made two recipes for Irish soda bread at the same time, this one and Irish Soda Bread by penguin lady on AR also. I added 1 cup of raisins and 1 tsp caraway seeds to this recipe, for authenticity. They were both ‘amazingly easy’ but the other one was more moist because of an extra 1/4 c buttermilk and sour cream. This one had a more distinctive ‘soda’ bread taste due to the higher amount of baking powder, and a better crust. If I make this one again I will add another 1/4 c buttermilk and cook at a slightly lower temp to add s bit more moisture.

Excellent!   Like other reviewers I bumped up the sugar to 1/3 cup and baked at 340 degrees for about an hour (until internal temp was 208).    I baked it in a pre-heated dutch oven.

This is five stars without making any changes (other than I prefer real butter). This is my new go-to recipe for soda bread.

This was fast and easy! And it turned out moist. I split the batter in half and put raisins in one half and left without in the other. My family loved it! And served with some delicious Irish butter! I forgot to get a before picture.

I made this for St. Patrick’s Day dinner tonight and I highly recommend it. The only change I made to the ingredients was to add an addditional tablespoon of sugar. 

As another poster suggested, after forming it into a ball, I let it rest for 30 minutes before baking it. I baked the bread in a greased cast iron skillet and brushed the bread every 15 minutes with the buttermilk/butter mixture. I baked it 350 and it was done in 55 minutes in the skillet. It was moist on the inside and had a great crust. The family was raving about how good it was. This recipe definitely is a keeper!!!

I've made other traditional irish soda breads but this by far is the best! I followed the recipe exactly subed butter instead of margarine. It was moist and delicious with just a hint of sweetness.

I took this to a St. Patty's Day dinner and it was a hit! I was told over and over how yummy it was. I cut the butter in with a pastry gadget I had and changed the sugar to 1/2 cup. Also, baked it at 350 degrees for about an hour but I live in Denver so have to deal with high altitudes. I'll be making this again!

I have made Irish Soda Bread for years.  I tried this one thinking it might be a little more moist than the ones I have made in the past.  This just fell apart as I cut this bead.  Won't make this one again.  very disappointed.  Going back to my original recipe.

This would be a 5 star recipe for a basic scone. It’s not really Irish soda bread, though. Flour, buttermilk, soda and salt are the only ingredients for Irish soda bread. It still made a delicious scone-like bread! Next time, I’ll add some dried cherries or blueberries.

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. I used milk with vinegar because I didn't have buttermilk. I baked to at 350 for about 45-50 minutes. Delicious.

So delicious! Made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great. Will definitely make again and won’t change a thing. I started checking for doneness at 30 minutes and it was done in 40. Perfect pairing with shepherds pie and a Guinness!

This bread had great flavour but I found the dough to be really dry. I needed to add more milk while kneading to get it to stay together. Next time I’ll try it with 3 C of four instead. Very good with chili :)

This was so easy to make. I did follow another's advice, used butter instead of margarine, increased sugar to 1/3 cup, used my Kitchenaid mixer, and cooked it for 50 min @ 350°. My son tried the first loaf, and ate 1/2 of it before it even was at room temp. I had to make another loaf before the oven could cool down!

This was incredible and SO easy to make. My husband and I made this and some spinach & artichoke dip and just had that for dinner. We can't wait to have the rest of the bread with jam tomorrow. It did take the full 50 minutes for it to bake and still came out so soft and delicious.

Made this as for smaller loaves to vacuum seal and take camping for a few weeks. It was a great moist bread with a ton of flavor and stored exactly how I wanted a soda bread to

i am only marking a 3 because i havnt made this exact recipe yet. i wanted to only email to the person that came up with the recipe for Irish soda bread and tell them that the recipe i am going to follow today is for Traditional Irish Soda Bread & it doesnt call for any eggs. I was just wondering if the knew why one called for an egg and one did not. what would be replacing the egg ? anyway, i am just curious cause neither of them are my recipes but i do really enjoy eating it,,it is very yummy, even without butter.

Talk about easy to make! I made the initial batch, split it and left one half plain. The other half, I added some dried onion soup. Both are yummylicious! Now I see how easy it is to put together and change up, I may be making bread several times a week and sharing with my neighbours!

I don’t think it deserves 5 stars if you need to modify the recipe. The updated, improved recipe is what deserves 5 stars. This is good, but NOT great as-is. 

I have 3 issues with this recipe. 
1.) it doesn’t specify that you should mix ALL the dry ingredients before you add the margarine. 
2.) it really will burn the outside if you don’t turn it down a bit. Seriously. ALmost every review says as much... 
3.) there is waste if you make that much of the buttermilk mixture. Half is more than plenty. 1/4 of what it calls for would work. 

It’s a pretty good one... but not as good as it could be.

Made day before for company to go with dinner for 5 people. Got rave reviews! I cut ingredients in half and let sit for 30 minutes before basting and baking.  Baked for 15 minutes and basted again. Cooked another 20 minutes, basted,  let completely cool, and then sliced. Wrapped and refrigerated. 
 Warmed up the next day. Should have made the whole loaf. It was a hit with everyone!

This was amazing. I was worried that my loaf didn't look smooth enough, and I actually forgot to use a knife to make the "x" on top of the loaf. I basted the loaf three times while it was baking. The result was an amazingly soft, soda bread! This was sooooo yummy!

This is by far the best thing I have ever made. It’s crispy, buttery, and light but at the same time it’s dense. I added around 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of rasisons and it was perfect. I highly recomend

I halved the recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of AP flour, left out the sugar, and used ghee instead of butter. I brushed the bread with the ghee-buttermilk mixture 3 times while baking, as the recipe instructed, so I was disappointed that the bread didn't come out as crispy as I would have expected, except at the bottom. The inside was very good, though--not too dense--and went very well with Danny O'Flaugherty's recipe for lamb stew.

My husband and I ate nearly the whole loaf in one sitting, which is very surprising, since we don't usually eat that much bread at once. Will definitely make again.

I remember having Irish soda bread as a kid, and thinking how sour it was. This loaf wasn't sour at all, and I wonder if it's just because the recipe is different, or if my baking soda is flat. (I just checked on YouTube, and my baking soda definitely didn't fizzle nearly as much as in the video. Ugh, I just bought a new package too!)

My husband had never tried soda bread so I made this on St. Patrick's day. I used my stand mixer to prepare the dough so it took no time at all. I did knead it for a little while after mixing. It turned out wonderfully and my husband loved it.

I made only two changes:  Firstly, I used 1 -1/4 c. Of milk + 1 Tablespoon and a wee bit more of vinegar to make buttermilk substitute.  Secondly, I took another reviewer’s advice and baked it at 350 degrees  for a bit longer, an hour or so.  I used my hands to make the dough, and basted frequently till the buttermilk/butter mixture was gone.  It turned out delicious and would be terrific with soup, stew, a snack, toast ... Great recipe, thank you.

Amazingly easy and amazingly delicious. I scaled down to 15 servings and put in a cup of raisins cause hubby likes raisins. He said it was the best Irish soda bread he has ever had and that means something since he had plenty growing up Irish in New York. Will be a St Patricks Day staple in our house along with Irish bacon soup from this site and more often too!

Skill Level: A cub could do it.

Overview: Growing up, I always dreaded St. Patrick's day corned beef and cabbage and even now, I'm not a huge fan. But one thing I always enjoyed was my yearly Irish soda bread. For the uninitiated, you don't get much simpler than this old school crumbly peasant bread. There is no yeast, no rising time, just flour, dairy, eggs, and a little baking powered and baking soda to help it rise

Pros: This thing is beautifully simple. If you've never made bread before this a great start, You can go from raw ingredients to slathering butter and eating this sucker in less than 2 hours, and most of that will be baking time. There are fancy versions that involve currents and orange zesting and all that nonsense, but keep it simple, we ain't all the Barefoot Contessa.

Pro tips: Use a stick of softened salted butter instead of margarine. And use actual buttermilk since you'll be using it to "baste" the bread. Yeah I know buttermilk is a pain and it's tempting to cheat using regular milk and vinegar/lemon juice, but I just commit myself to making some pancakes or biscuits over the next week to get the most out of it.

Cons(?): No real cons, except to say that if you make it you should commit to eating within 24 hours. This is not a bread that keeps well, though you can throw it in a toaster to get a little more life out of it.

Conclusion - This review comes out a little late for St. Paddy's 2018 (this was my first year trying

This was my first time baking bread and I have to say, it was easy!  And yummy!  This thing is like food crack, you just can't have just one slice.  My boyfriend kept getting more slices and was annoyed that I took a crumb!  Also, if you have a cast iron skillet, bake it in there.  The slightly toasted bottom from the cast iron made it oh so good and irrisistible!

This was made for a St. Patrick's day dinner. I'm not much for baking, but this was easy. I wasn't sure how it would be once it came out of the oven, but it was good! It has the consistency of corn bread, and great flavor.

Easy to make and delicious (especially hot out of the oven)!  My bread kind of looked more like a pod from “Aliens” so I don’t know what was going on there ...

This is the 2nd time I've made this bread and it turned out the same both times -- dry and crumbly with an uncooked center.  Flavor was OK but very dry.  I added caraway seeds and cranberries.  Won't be making this recipe again.  Very disappointed in taste , texture & crumbly finished product.

The first time I make a new recipe, I usually don't change a thing so I can rate the actual recipe.  This time after looking at quite a few similar recipes, I did add a second egg and increase the sugar to 1/2 C.  This bread does bake up with a wonderful firm crust and is very moist inside (more like cake than bread).  However, it does not seem a thing like my Grandmother's traditional Irish soda bread.  It is more like a big somewhat sweet scone with a flavor similar to a traditional shortcake we make. So....if you are looking for a cake like Irish soda bread-you will like this recipe.  If you want more of a traditional Irish soda bread, keep looking.  I can't share my Grandmother's recipe but I will say it has sour cream and buttermilk, caraway seeds and yellow raisins.

I love how easy this recipe is to follow. I did add a bit more buttermilk just so i could bring my dough together a bit more but thats probably because of the climate in Arkansas...im about to pop it in the oven...cant wait to try at our gamily St. Paddys day dinner later today!

I even created an account to rate this recipe. I didn’t have enough white flour so I used 1 cup of wheat flour. I didn’t have buttermilk so I used milk and lemon juice. This bread is so delicious - we all love it! I made it for an early St. Patrick day dinner and will use it for my corned beef hash and eggs breakfast. Thanks!

It was really easy and required no kneading. The ingredients list was simple, and you probably already have a lot of the things you need. I added a half cup of currants to the dough, which was a good amount. Next time I will wait longer after the bread comes out of the oven before putting aluminum foil over it. Putting the foil on too soon made the bread a little too moist. I liked the bread best shortly after it came out of the oven when the outside was craggy and dry, more like a scone. I did not have a traditional bread pan and used a medium ceramic casserole dish instead, which worked fine.

The bread was good, added craisens to it to sweeten it, rather than raisens. And since we one member of the family is gluten free I made a smaller loaf using Red Mills GF flour. He really liked it & took most of the loaf home with him.

Even though this turned out really good, I'm only giving a 4 star due i had to add more buttermilk due to it being way too dry and falling apart before i could get it out of the bowl to kneed. definitely will try again using a mixer, not hand.

Kind of hard to rate, since I’ve never had Irish soda bread, so no idea what it’s supposed to taste like.  Followed the recipe exactly, other than baking time.  Lowered temp to 350 and baked for 40 minutes, at which point it tested done with a toothpick, so tried to cut.  As others found, the center was not done.  Cut off two slices from the outer edge, and put the rest back in the oven for 10 more minutes.  Flavor wise, I guess it was ok, but it was pretty much just a giant biscuit.  Not sure what I was expecting, but not something I’ll probably make again.

I really like the texture and ease of making it, but I'm not crazy about the flavor. Very bland for our tastes. It's not bad, but I'll have to tinker with it. Before I do, I'll try some other recipes first, then if they're not closer to what I'm looking for, I'll try this one again and try playing with it.

Easy to make, minimal clean up, and awesome taste! I will definitely use this recipe again, it's the best one I have found so far. Next time, I might add in raisins or poppy seeds for extra flavor, but it doesn't need it!

Big mistake! This is not a traditional soda bread at all. The egg, butter and baking powder are not in keeping with any traditional soda bread. By adding these two ingredients, it made a sort of biscuit rather than a bread. I realized it is almost exactly like a scone recipe. I was very disappointed and would not make again. I found a traditional soda bread in a British baking cookbook and will do this one next time. A traditional soda is white and whole wheat flour, baking soda, buttermilk....that is it.

This recipe needs to come with a warning.  It's so good you can almost eat the whole thing before you know it.  I'm going to make another loaf for the church potluck.  Hope I can get it there.

I followed this recipe exactly but added fresh herbs in with the dry ingredients. I had a lot of rosemary and thyme on hand so I threw those in before kneading. It turned out wonderfully. Had it with salmon stew and was a really great addition!!

I followed this recipe (including applying more buttermilk a few times throughout baking), with one small addition: after putting the dough on the pan, I allowed it to rest for about 10-15 minutes before putting it in the oven (read this tip in another soda bread recipe).  The bread was delicious when it came out!  Have made it twice so far and will definitely make it again!

First homemade soda bread was a hit!  Made buttermilk (with milk and lemon juice) so I wouldn't have to go out and buy any and used regular butter.
Will def make again as all these ingredients are usually on hand already ! Thanks

Family loved it! Flavor was good. Me on the other hand is a little bit more picky. It's a little too dense and heavy for my liking. I think next time I will let the dough sit for at least half hour and will shape the dough a little more flatter. The center had a little bit of uncooked dough in mine even after an hour of baking. So shaping it longer in length (like a loaf) as well as thinner radius would probably cook better, rather than the round shape the recipe called for. I shaped mine oval this first time around. Next time, making the dough sit for a little while should probably help with the really dense texture be more lighter and airy.

Excellent recipe!  Like a couple of other reviewers, I cut the butter into the flour mixture first, then added the wet ingredients.  And because I'm a purist and love the flavor of the soda in the bread, I cut the sugar to half.  (Nothing wrong with the way it's written, just a personal preference.)  And it makes fantastic toast the next day.
1/19/20:  To make this quicker and easier, freeze the butter or margarine, then cut it in to chunks and throw it into a food processor with the flour and other dry ingredients.  You might have to do this in a couple of batches, but keep pulsing until the butter is cut into nice small pieces.  I've also started baking it in a greased cast iron pan, and the end result is consistently outstanding.

I thought it was very good but had to make a couple of major tweeks.First of all there is too much flower and not enough wet.I had to add another egg and maybe a quarter cup buttermilk.You have to eyeball it.The taste is very good and will make again.

Extremely easy however we should have kneaded it a little more to allow the bread to not be so crumby.

Did not use the oats or wheat flour
Added a little more reg. Flour
Came out a little dryer than expected so next time I make will lower the oven temp to 350
I have found that cooking at a lower temp for a bit longer time works with my older oven. Might add a few more raisins too!

Made this  according to the recipe and I always do this the first time I make a recipe.  All who tried it enjoyed it and said it was a keeper.  In the future I will add a dried fruit like dried cranberries. Thanks for an easy and very good bread.  I won't wait  for St. Patrick's Day to use it again.

The basic recipe  as written is  perfect  provided one takes into account the consistency of the dough.  I found in the two times that I made this soda bread that the amount of buttermilk had to be adjusted.  That is normal for any type of  bread. Depending  on dryness of the flour and viscosity of  the buttermilk  adjustments have to be made.  The texture of the dough needs to be soft enough to be kneaded but not sticky.  I had to add extra buttermilk as I used  the whole milk version, not lowfat.

Turned out great!  No need to alter (although I just may try some herbs next time I make it for a different dinner.)  This was very fast & easy to make & of course went well with our corned beef dinner-everyone had 2 slices!  I actually made French toast for my husband the next morning with the rest of it and he loved it!  A keeper!

Even the resident "chef" in the family asked for the leftovers! Since I was using medium eggs, I used two, instead of one, as the recipe called-for. Turned out great! Cannot overemphasize the value of the buttermilk coating. BASTE LIBERALLY! It is SO good.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious. The loaf was gone in a couple hours. The only thing I will do differently next time is decrease the oven temp to 350. The bottom was a little too done for my liking.

Amazing! This bread was almost to easy to make and so delicious. I agree with some of the other reviewers and basted it multiple times while in the oven. Served with Kerrygold butter on top, my husband and I couldnt stop eating it! We even had it the next day with jam for breakfast. Ill be making this bread often

Very basic and simple Irish Soda Bread. I'm not a fan of light, airy breads with raisins, dried fruit, or chocolate chips. This is a simple, dense bread that is perfect with Jelly or Jam, served with your Corned Beef and Cabbage, or even with a good, hearty stew or chili.

I wish there were more stars! I've made it 3 times in the past 4 weeks, each time for different guests. Everyone loves it and I've been "informed" I must make it for them the next time they come over for dinner....or make it and bring it to their home.

Made this for St Patrick's day and it turned out great. Everyone loved it,  and despite the very "rustic" appearance the flavour was good and texture nice. I had never even eaten soda bread before so had no idea what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. I subbed one cup of whole wheat flour for a more hearty bread. Definitely will make again.

I looked at numerous recipes for Irish Soda Bread and have even made different versions.  This was by far the absolute best.  I added 3/4 cup of raisins to the batter before kneading it.  I basted 5 times during baking.  It was beautiful when it came out of the oven.  The outside was golden and crusty.  The inside was dense and very moist.  The next morning I cut a few slices and toasted them.  So good!  Actually better the second day.

This soda bread was sooo good!!!   I halved the recipe except the buttermilk  ( made a mistake and put a full cup instead of 1/2)   so I added about 1/2 c. extra flour...totally didn't think it would come out right but it turned out great!  I'm going to switch up the recipe and keep my mistake because I can't image this bread tasting any better if I had stayed with recipe.

Had the texture of cornbread without the corn.  It looks like a giant Bisquick biscuit.  It was dry and crumbly.  No one tried to eat it at dinner, but me.  Won't be making this again!

I'm not really a baker but this recipe was a great addition to my St. Patrick's Day dinner.  Everyone loved it and I followed the recipe exactly but did add some raisins.  Also, my supermarket only had fat free buttermilk but using it didn't seem to make a difference.  It was moist and delicious.  Think I'll make another !

Great recipe.  Took some of the advice from other reviewers. Added a slash more of buttermilk.  Dusted the pan with corn meal.  Added 2 tbsp of flour to adjust for high altitude.  Really went well with our St. Patrick's Day meal.

I will definitely make it again.  I made to take to work for an Irish potluck on St. Patrick's Day and it was a hit. I saved a couple slices to take home to my husband and daughter.  They devoured them and want to make more!

Wish I had just made it as written.  Did follow ingredients exactly, but did it in the kitchenaid as another reviewer wrote.  Did not make for an attractive loaf, so mixing might be fine, but still turn out and knead a bit.  Also would prob put in some sort of pan besides baking sheet next time.    Taste was good!

Everything was perfect, except temperature and time to cook.  Definitely echo what others have said.  I prepared this about 5 degrees less for the temperature and about 5-10 minutes more to cook.  My first one came out a little overcooked, but the second one came out great.

I expected to give this 3 stars while making it since I found the dough very difficult to work with - it was very dry and hard to get it to firmly mold into a round.  I did the best I could getting it formed, then brushed  half the liquid on it which helped it hold together a little better.  I brushed twice more during baking process (once after 15 minutes and once after 30 minutes).  I baked at 350 for 40 minutes, checked it with a toothpick, and it was done.  After 10 minutes, I wrapped in aluminum foil overnight.  The bread was delicious and everyone raved about it and grabbed a second piece.  This is a good bread - even if the dough is a challenge.  I will make again.

I made this twice. Once with more baking powder that it called for. Bleh! But then I made it right. LOL. I didn't really like the taste but my family loved it, so I'm giving it 4 stars.

I have never made Irish Soda Bread before and have to say this recipe was easy and super delicious.  Made it as written but used parchment paper on the baking sheet instead of cooking spray, butter instead of margarine and took the advice of others to bake at 350 degrees for a little longer.  Served with whipped butter and homemade raspberry mango jam. I will definitely make this again.

Super easy with my stand mixer.  A tad bit on the dry side but the subtle sweetness was just right.

I make this a few times every year and cannot believe I never rated it. This is the best Soda Bread that I have ever had. The only thing I change is that I use butter instead of margarine. The buttermilk is a must and I do baste it with the butter and buttermilk while it is baking. Absolutely delicious!

I swore I would never make Irish Soda Bread again.  The other ones I made were so dry and tasteless.  I increased the sugar to a little over 1/4 cup and used my Kitchen Aid to make it.  I also took the suggestion of another reader to bast the bread about 3 times and sprinkle it with sugar.  It was wonderful.  Will make again.

I decided to make an Irish-inspired dinner with Irish stew & soda bread this evening. I have to say, this bread is pretty amazing. It's sweet, buttery and yummy -- a perfect complement to a hearty stew. I didn't change a thing & I'll definitely make it again.

This is very good quick bread! Even though I'm of Irish descent, I can't swear it's authentic; but it is delicious. The second time I made it I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, and my family went crazy for it. I'm making it again tomorrow!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and used my stand mixer for easy preparation.  I flattened the loaf a bit due to comments from others about the difficulty of getting the bread cooked in the center.  It turned out perfect.   I will make this again.

I made both this recipe (Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread) and the other recipe (Irresistible Irish Soda Bread) tonight and I've wrapped them both in tin foil to take to the office tomorrow for my colleagues to try out and decide which one is better.  I will update after I hear the results.    :-)

Absolutely Delicious!! Easy to make, amazing authentic Irish bread flavor & texture. Crunchy on the outside, very dense & soft on the inside. Everyone loved it, I had multiple requests to make them their own loaves. Highly recommended! Preparation tip: coat hands in flour before kneading, brush buttermilk/butter mixture often, I had plenty to spare.

Made this today.  My first ever soda bread and it was a hit!   Adding this to my weekly menu now!   I subbed in brown sugar instead of white, as I was out of the latter, and no one complained.  That said, put some foil under it before you bake it and clean up will be much easier.

I made 2. The second only because I forgot the egg in the first batch. They both turned out fine. Delicious. Easy. Amazing.

I also used whey instead of buttermilk since I had some sitting around. I will be making this recipe again and again!

Try it, you'll like it!

This one gets 4 stars because mine came out very crumbly.  Perhaps it's something I did.  Adding raisins was the only change I made in the recipe.  When we first tried it we thought it was "blah" but the further we got into the bread the better it got.  It has just a hint of sweetness which is how it should be.  The texture seemed ok.  It wasn't dry, but it was crumbly and not too easy to cut. If anyone knows why it might have turned out that way, I'd like to know , because this recipe is good, and very easy to make.  I'll make it again - maybe I worked the dough too much?

A real favorite at my house, made it twice this year. It's an unusual heavy texture and a bit of a sweet taste. Passed recipe on to a friend, and they enjoyed it, also.

My family and I did not really care for this bread because it's pretty dry and bland. Won't be making it again.

Have never made Irish soda bread and this was so simple and yummy! I know traditionally there are raisins in it, but we don't like them so this was perfect! If you really want them in there I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to throw in a handful. Very crumbly, flakey, and sweet..and easy! Thank you for the recipe! Will definitely make it again!

I've made this the last two St. Patrick's Day. I made it as listed. It was absolutely delicious. My honey used to own an Irish pub, and they made soda bread every day. He said it tastes better than what he made in the pub.

This was my very first time making bread and it still turned out perfect. I was very proud of myself and I don't think I could have done it without this awesome recipe! The video was a great help too. If a first timer like me can do it, anyone can! Thank you for sharing!

Came out great! I had to add 2 more splashes of buttermilk to get it to really stick together (I didn't want to over mix) before putting on my floured surface.

I made this for St. Patrick's day this year and it ...ok. It's a complicated recipe with a ton of butter. My normal Irish soda bread  has 4 ingredients 5 if I split the flour white:whole wheat. I was sad that I tried something new and didn't care for on my favorite day of the year.

This is the first soda bread recipe i've tried and it was a hit! I followed the directions exactly for the first loaf and everyone raved about how delicious it was.  We ate it along with a beef stew recipe from this site and the combo was dynamite.  Second loaf I basted every 10/15 min and added raisins i'd soaked for 24 hours in four roses whiskey and that was a hit as well; couldn't taste the alcohol but those raisins were plump and juicy! I'd even go so far as to say it was my favorite because the raisins created sweet and delicious pockets. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Mine turned out identical to the picture.  While I was making it, I was sure it was going to be a disaster. Note that it's a soda bread with no frills...so it's just a nice solid carb perfect for mopping up gravy and dipping in stews.  It was very crumbly, but since I'm not a soda bread expert, this might be expected.  The dough was initially way too dry, so I needed to add more buttermilk so that I could knead it.  You can't beat the easiness of this.  I will make this again for next St. Patrick's Day, or if I want a bread and am pressed for time and ingredients (i.e. desperate, lol).

I've never had or made Irish soda bread before. I followed the recipe exactly (but sprinkled sugar each time I basted it as another reviewer suggested). I used my kitchen mixer and made it very quickly. I also let it rest for a half an hour to make it lighter and more airy (as another reviewer suggested). It came out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. It was delicious! The family loved it and I will definitely make it again.

Good, crusty. I added 1 cup raisins (floured) as my family prefers soda bread with raisins. I did not brush top. I used bread machine to mix everything. Took 55 minutes to bake.

Delicious and super easy. I made another loaf and added about 1 cup of raisins, which turned out perfect. A great accompaniment to my corned beef and cabbage dinner!

My dough was way too dry. Tried again with 1.5 cups buttermilk, little better, until I was kneading, then it got crumbly again. 3rd try - 2 cups buttermilk worked well.

The recipe was incredibly easy, most ingredients I already had at home. I read a review that suggested baking the bread at a lower temperature for a longer time. I followed this advice, and the bread came out deliciously perfect!! My kids loved it, and were begging for more!

I used this recipe as a base for a gluten free (GF) version of this bread. It was amazing! As with most GF varieties, I did have to tweak the original recipe a bit. Because GF flour is more absorbent, I had to increase my buttermilk by about 1/4 cup. I was also able to use butter in place of shortening because of this. Like with most GF recipes, your dough will not be as elastic making kneading a bit mor difficult. Once your dough begins to clump a bit, just use your hands to mix it in order for the dough to come together, then knead it right in the bowl. Half-way through bake time (after the second basting), I lowered the oven temperature by 10 degrees and baked it for 50-55 minutes. The finished product is a bit more fragile than the original recipe, but it is absolutely delicious and has made for one happy Celiac as well as her gluten intolerant hubby who loved it as well!

Loved this recipe! The bread comes out pretty sweet, so note that depending on your tastes. I substituted buttermilk with regular milk and a tablespoon white vinegar since I realised I didn't have any. Turned out great anyway.  I also broke the dough into two smaller boules for quicker cooking and easier sharing. I will be making this again.

This was so good! Crunchy outside with soft, fluffy inside. I had to experiment with moving the oven rack a couple times so the top wouldnt burn but next time I'll just keep it a little lower because the inside was just slightly doughy..but I still ate it ;)

This was a great Irish soda bread recipe.  I made it exactly as posted and added 1 cup of raisins.  I used my hand mixer on low speed to mix the ingredients then hand mixed in the raisins at the end right before kneading the dough.  I also added more of the buttermilk/butter mixture to the bread during last 10 minutes of baking and sprinkled 2 tsp of sugar in the raw on top.  It took 45 minutes to bake in my oven.

Everyone loved it and it turned out perfectly!!! nice and crusty a bit on the dense side as it is suppose to be and very nicely browned. The only change I made was I didn't have buttermilk so I soured milk overnight in the fridge ... served with lots of butter and with Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner

This is great soda bread. Easy and quick to mix. I did substitute other grains for some of the white flour, I e., whole wheat, buckwheat, wheat germ. Was great.

I loved this bread! It is the first "loaf" of bread I've made and I was extremely delighted at how well it turned out. Very good flavor and better than a lot of soda bread I've had out. Paired it with some soft whipped butter and it was a winning combination.

I made this with gluten-free pancake mix flour and I use olive oil for the dough instead of butter because that's all I had. Also added some cheese to the mix and on top and I think it turned out very well...thank you for the recipe

This recipes is great and easy.  I don't like it as one single loaf.  I put it into two loaf pans.   turned the temp down to 350° and less time because it was in two loafs.  I find its less dry this way.  We slice and fry to make a traditional Ulster Fry.  Hubby is from Northern Ireland and this is great when he misses home!

I make only half the recipe as there are just the two of us and it turns out great every time. I will definitely make it again. Taking in the hint from another reviewer and will use my stand mixer next time.

I really love this bread.  It's so quick and easy to make and it's delicious.  Best if you make it ahead and let it cool before cutting, otherwise it can be a bit crumbly and more like a biscuit or scone.   I make this regularly to go with soup and stew and it's always a hit!

I didn't use the "wash" nor did I cut a cross, just one cut across the center. Also used iron "frying" pan as was traditional in my childhood home.
My mother never had a written recipe so this is a great substitute.

Very easy to follow and quick, but for me it came out too floury and took [about 20 minutes] longer to fully cook.

This is the Irish soda bread I have made for the last 5 St Patty's Day dinner.   I bake it slightly undercooked since I don't care for dry bread,  but also so I can refresh it in the oven a few minutes just before serving.  The only ingredient you may  not have on hand is the buttermilk.   So much to do with buttermilk it'd worth buying and then find other ways to use the rest.   Actually I don't have much leftover because I usually triple or quadruple the recipe.

his is a great recipe although I am in the lower temperature, longer bake group.  The first loaf, done to the recipe, was underdone in the middle and my lovely wife tuned up her Irish nose - cute but not the desired reaction.  Second loaf, unbasted, tasted awesome, but looked anemic.  Third loaf, basted twice was awesome in all ways - Including approval of the Irish.  We like the texture - crumbly - we added raisins and a tad more sugar.  Probably not authentic Irish Bread but this is a home, not the Smithsonian.

Great recipe — though I used butter instead of margarine and added a cup of raisins with the first addition of buttermilk. Makes a delicious Irish soda bread.

I had never tried soda bread before, but this recipe is a hit!  At first I thought it was going to be just a big biscuit, but it is oh so good.  As one reviewer said, one should reduce the oven temp and cook a bit longer.  It was a tad doughy in the center, even though the toothpick did come out clean!?!?  Also, do be sure to baste the buttermilk/butter mixture several times while baking.  Thank you, MP Welty, for this wonderful recipe.  I will make again and again!

I really liked this and so did my hubby and kids.   I was a little worried when I was kneading it as it was pretty crumbly but went with it.  It's like a cross between a sweet bread and a biscuit.  I made this to go with my corned beef cooked in Guiness (recipe on this site) for St. Pat's day.  Great meal!

I'm not a good baker-- but this turned out GREAT!!  I made it as directed, but I did attempt a mid-bake basting of the leftover butter/ buttermilk mixture;  the top of bread got a bit browned, I think because of it.  I won't do that again, but it doesn't really matter, because regardless, it was a great tasting bread and would go quite well with any soups/ stews.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Delicious, moist and addicting.  I am not convinced that it is authentic, but it's incredible.  I did add raisins but it was incredible.  All the kids at the preschool where I work look forward to this annual St. Patrick's Day treat.  It comes out like a big, moist, buttery biscuit.

This recipe is so simple and very good.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine (does anyone really still use margarine, I hope not!).  I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.--Vicki

I made it and it's great.  It's dense but not heavy or dry.  I really hate raisins and especially caraway seeds which everybody loves to add to Irish Soda Bread so this is perfect. After reading some reviews, I preheated the oven to 375° but when I put the loaf in the oven I immediately reduced it to 350° then baked for 1 hour.  It was fine.  I have to say that I just watched the video and my dough was MUCH dryer and more crumbly than shown.  Next time I'll add extra buttermilk to offset that which should also make it even more delicious.

I've tried this twice. The first time was exactly as written and directed and it came out fine, though I thought it was too crumbly and didn't think it would hold together. It did tend to fall apart while cutting and while trying to put butter on it, but it still tasted fine. My husband declared it the best bread he's had in years. 
Also, the cooking time is WAY off. Not sure who was able to get it done in 30-45 minutes. Mine took well over an hour before it was a lovely crusty color on the outside and done on the inside. I did continue to baste the butter/buttermilk mixture onto the bread every 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind that if you continue to baste then you'll probably get a burnt crust around the bottom edge of the bread where it drips down. My husband called it "caramelization", god bless him. I also added a sprinkle of turbinado sugar ("Sugar in the Raw") to the top to add some extra crunch. 
The 2nd time I made it I also used the KitchenAid stand mixer which really assists with making it easier and less messy to prepare. I also added an extra 1/2 an egg, which I thought would help hold it all together better. That worked but it changed the color to a slightly more yellow color from the bready white I had before. No matter because in both cases (even with the "caramelization" on the bottom) the bread disappeared before I knew what hit me. Definitely a keeper!

I made three different soda bread recipes this year.  This is by far the best off the three. I used about 1/3C white sugar and would keep it that way.  Next time I will also add raisins and caraway seeds to this base recipe for more of an "American" Irish soda bread.  Yummy!!!!

I've made this bread several times.  The flavor is excellent and everyone I've ever served it to has loved it.  It is easy and pulls together quickly.  For me, though, the amount of buttermilk is off.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a dry crumbly loaf of dough that would barely hold together.  Out of the oven the outside was done but the loaf had a thick, doughy core.  Now, I start every time with the 1 cup that is called for.  The dough is still dry and crumbly and will not pull together.  I have learned to add more buttermilk, a little at a time, until I get the right consistency.  I bake for the entire 45 minutes and baste every 10 minutes and get a very nice browned and crunchy crust with a moist and flavorful inside.  With that one change this is a great recipe.

Great recipe! It is a little biscuit like in flavor and texture, which made it all the better. Basting with the butter/buttermilk mixture is key - it made for a delicious crust. Thanks for a keeper.

Making the bread was fast and easy - but it tasted just like a biscuit.  Nor sure what I expected but this wasn't it.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because I think this turned out the way it should and maybe I'm just not a Irish 
soda Bread kind of girl. It looked very yummy but that was about it. tasteless/dry yet spongy in the middle. Just not for me.

Made this one for the first time yesterday for the St. Patrick's dinner.  It was a hit!  My oldest son said it was the best soda bread I've made yet & he couldn't stop eating it.  I served it with home made honey butter.  This is definitely a keeper.

I started my mixing in the Kitchen Aide and then kneaded for a while on a floured surface.  I added about 1/2 cup raisins by kneading them into the dough.  Recipe yielded one fairly large loaf, which I probably could have made into two if necessary.  The recipe was very simple and cooked well for 45 minutes at 375. Mildly sweet, traditional tasting loaf -DELICIOUS!

Followed recipe except for some high altitude adjustments.  It was actually better the second day with no butter.  Slightly sweet and moist.  Very easy!

The butter in this recipe gives it the texture and flavor of a giant scone.  Delicious!  So easy, my 3 year old loved making this with me.  Makes wonderful toast the following day!

I made this for the first time this weekend for two St. Patrick Day dinners. I made 3 loaves (one at a time) and they all turned out so delicious. I made one with walnuts and craisins, and two plain. Each type got rave reviews from our neighbors and my family. I did add a bit more buttermilk to the dough as it was a bit dry and was falling apart as I kneaded. This could have been the result of my measurements of flour since my 5 year old was assisting me. I loved the ease of using one bowl! The last one I baked at 350 degrees for a little longer because my oven tends to run hot. It was probably the best out of the three in terms of texture on the outside and in. I just made myself some toast with the leftovers...yum!

This recipe was great. My husband loves this bread, he made it and said it's delicious. I can't speak myself on it bc I don't like irish soda bread. Said the only thing he'd change is to nclude raisins (he added 1cup) and caraway seeds (to your liking).

It was very good...used some of the tips in the reviews...added raisins, used the KitchenAid stand mixer, basted top w/ the butter/buttermilk mixture 4 times during cooking, added some sugar crystals to top, cut back to 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes.

This was very tasty but it was pretty dry. I kept checking the ingredients to make sure I didn't leave anything out because the dough itself was dry, even before baking. It tasted great, though. I'll have to experiment with the dry/wet ingredient ratio.

Very easy, very adaptable. I have made a traditional soda bread in the past, this one was just as easy, more moist. I cut back on the butter a bit and added more buttermilk. Came together nicely. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I used Irish butter instead of margarine,and formed into two small loaves, which I let rest after kneading for abt 10 minutes,They baked faster too, only took 40 min.I also added 1/2 c raisins. It has more of a scone or biscuit texture..very good with our St Patty's Day dinner!!

I made this today for St. Patrick's Day, and it was a hit. The flavor was delicious, and the texture was much more like one giant biscuit than a loaf of bread. I substituted butter for the margarine, and used buttermilk powder in place of fresh buttermilk. Worked great and assembled pretty easily.

This is really delicious.  Very easy to make. Only change was a lowered oven temp by 20 degrees and kept a close watch on bread at end of baking time, and tested middle of bread for doneness.  Really good warm. Can not wait to serve this for St.Pat's day coming up.

This bread was delicious! I added about a cup of raisins, per other reviews. Also, next time I'm definately going to try a lower temperature. My loaves burned a little on the bottom by the time they cooked through.

Excellent and super easy!! Prep your own buttermilk by adding 1 tbsp and almost 1 tsp lemon juice in measuring cuo, then fill the rest of the way to the 1.25 cup with milk - let sit 10 mins.  I did baste the bread while cooking, and cooked about 48 mins. Will make again for sure - tasted like a giant biscuit - wonderful!

I thought this bread came out excellent. It's a very dense bread with a nice thick crust. Excellent with salted butter. However, if your mother in law has no teeth like mine does, I would also buy a store bought soda bread. Her look of disgust because of the thick hard crust on mine vanished when I brought out the store bought bread and the Country Crock just for her.

If you have never made Irish Soda Bread and are looking for a very tasty and easy recipe, this is it! I hosted my first Irish Dinner and found this recipe for Soda Bread, because what Irish Dinner is complete without it?? Absolutely loved it! I ended up making 4 that night and I had to hide one of them so I could bring it into work the next day because it was all completely gobbled up! I also added raisins in one batch to make it a bit of a dessert along with a cinnamon, sugar, and butter mixture to lightly baste the bread with. It turned out wonderful! Thank you for such a great recipe!

My family really enjoyed this bread for St Patrick's Day today.  It is definitely best hot.  When the timer beeped, the middle was still gooey so I left it in longer.  But when the middle was done, the bottom of my bread was burned pretty badly.  So the time I make it (and I will make it again) I will try turning the heat down about 50 degrees and cook it longer.  Or else, I may divide the bread in half and cook it in two loaves.

My first time ever making any soda bread. The recipe was very easy. I didn't have margarine so I used butter. I was worried that it wouldn't come out right, but it tasted just fine. This bread tastes like a scone! The family loved it!

Very good.  But when you are putting the buttermilk and butter on the top DO NOT let it drip to the bottom of the pan.  I burnt mine in spots, but otherwise it was awesome!

This bread was wonderful. Quick and easy with no rise time. A dense bread that would be a great company with any stew.

I followed the recipe to a 'T' but it came out quite dry. Probably a temp variation with my oven but probablywon't make this again.

I've never made Irish Soda Bread before.  This was really easy, and turned out really good!  It's delicious the next day and after warmed up a little in the microwave with a little butter. Even better...honey butter.

Being from an Irish heritage and having soda bread all the time growing up, I thought this was an amazing recipe. I was searching for a recipe that didn't need yeast (because I have the hardest time keeping an eye on it) and came upon this. It was incredibly simple to make, took hardly any time, and fresh out of the oven it tastes so delicious. Thank you so much for sharing this with us all!

I was not impressed with this bread.  It was very dry and did not have much flavor.  I have never made or eaten soda bread before so I am not a good judge as to what it should taste like.

Super easy with my Kitchenaid.  My husband was wary to try some, but once he did he almost ate the entire loaf :)  The longer it sat, the better it tasted (although it was all gone within two days).

Excellent soda bread! Totally different than what you get in stores. Not crumbly and dry at all. Moist, and flavorful. We ate half the loaf on St. Patrick's Day and the other half toasted with butter the next day. Will definitely make again.

first time making soda bread (although i read this isn't actually what the Irish call bread b/c of the egg and sugar)but we loved it.  i made 3 loaves with my kitchen aid and added both golden and regular raisins to one.  took 2 in for an office potluck and the raisin one was gobbled up in a few mins.  BIG hit, will definate make again.

To enhance this recipe a tad, I added a handful of raisins and 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds.  I also added less than 1/4 cup of buttermilk when mixing the dough to make it more moist.  Finally, to sweeten it a little more, I added 2 Tablespoons of sugar (making it a total of 6 Tablespoons of sugar for the dough.)    It may be just my oven but it took a little longer to bake - another 7 more minutes.  Absolutely delicious!!!

This is the easiest, most delicious bread that can be made.  There may be better breads out there in the world but definetly not this low maintenance.  Just make sure to wrap in foil while it cools, otherwise, it won't be a moist and delicious as it should be.

I loved this recipe!  It tasted great and it was incredibly easy to make.  I did, however, have to modify a few things: -added 1/4C buttermilk (mixture was quite dry -added raisins & craisins -used butter in place of margerine (ALWAYS!)

This was easy to make and from what I was told, did taste like it was suppose too.  My youngest (19mos) and myself really enjoyed and my other 2 boys said it was ok.  I will make it again though thanks :)

Fresh out of the oven this bread was amazing!! However, after sitting a few days, I think the consistancy changed.

This was really great and my husband and dinner guests really enjoyed it on St. Patrick's Day.  I added raisins and we also loved the left-overs.  It wasn't quite done in the center when the crust was brown, even when I had lowered the temperature and reviewers had suggested, but I think my oven runs hot, so I'll just lower it more next time.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe and it made 12 biscuits (instead of doing a loaf.)  I also added dried cranberries and white chocolate chips to half of the dough and raisins to the other half.  Other than that the add ins and making biscuits I made the recipe exactly as written.

Really good, with a few changes here and there. Half wholeweat flower, half normal flower, some more baking powder, only half the amount of butter, and slightly more buttermilk. No sugar, but some more salt and finely cut rosemary instead to make it a hearty bread! This turned out to be deicious, especially to eat with a soup or a stew.

LOVED IT! The easiest and best Irish Soda Bread recipe ever! I didn't add raisins or currants, and it was fantastic just plain. I'll be making this again next St. Patrick's Day! Thanks for a super easy, yummy recipe!

Delicious! I added a 1/2 cup of golden raisins, and the bread was a big hit when I had people over. They liked it better than a store bought version we had earlier.

While I have never had Irish Soda Bread before this was a very good, hearty bread. It went very well with corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day. I imagine it would be good with many meals as it was almost like a loaf of southern biscuit. Followed the recipe and cooking directions with no problems at all.

This is excellent! I had initially tried the Better than Grandpa McAndrews Irish Soda bread recipe on this site and thought that was good until I tried this one! This one had more flavor and although the other was good, this was a step above in my opinion. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added raisins and craisins. I made another two loaves the next day!

It was like a huge biscuit.  I did mine in my kitchen aide as another suggested & it was very simple.  Baked at 350 for 55 minutes & came out great!  Took this to a neighborhood St Patty's day cook out/dinner & everyone said it was very good.  Brought left over into work & all said they liked it there too.

A good bread. Relatively easy to prepare (although I don't love the kneading part). It took much longer to cook than noted in the recipe and got a little too brown on the top for my liking because of the additional cooking time (had I known how much longer it was going to take I would have tried to cover the loaf in foil to see if that would have helped prevent the over-browning). It looked and tasted like a huge drop biscuit.

I loved this!! This is my first time making soda bread so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like. To me it does seem like a big biscuit\scone. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone that I served it to liked it and asked me to make some more soon.

I've made this 2 years in a row now - definitely a keeper!  No other compares - even "secret family recipes".  The crust is wonderful.  I always add raisins, next year may add caraway seeds too.

Okay recipe, but doesn't quite capture the essence of a true Irish Soda Bread.  Tasted a lot like a Bisquick loaf to me, although it looked nice.  I'm going to keep looking for a more authentic recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  A hearty, full-bodied bread, and in my opinion as good as bread that takes hours to make, only much easier!  The recipe is perfect as written.  Make sure to use up the butter/buttermilk mixture by basting the bread a couple of times while it bakes, because it will make it taste and smell that much better!  Postscript:  I had a couple pieces this morning for breakfast, toasted, with apple butter.  Yummy!  I noticed it did develop more of a biscuity flavor after sitting overnight (wrapped in plastic).

I'd never had soda bread before so I wasn't quite sure if I hit or miss the mark. The bread was good. I added 1 cp raisins and about 2 tbsp carraway seeds. I also substituted 1cp wheat for white flour, but I think it was too dense. If you want to use wheat, maybe only sub in 1/2 cp. A good treat for my St. Patrick's dinner, though not something for raisin-haters out there.

Loved the taste, but as someone else mentioned - it seemed like too much flour. I ended up adding more buttermilk and that helped.   Will try this one again one day!

This was super fast and easy to make. I didnt have margarine so I used butter and crossed my fingers the oil content wouldnt be to much off. My bread did have to bake for a good 20 minutes longer. Next time I will either nake sure I have the right ingrediants or cover my bread earlier on and reduce the heat to keep it from getting to dark (I ended up trimming the bottom and sides but my oven isn't the greatest and I usually cover anything that will bake longer than 30 minutes). It was still moist and ever so slightly sweet. My kids didnt care for it even though I served it with honey butter from this site but it was really easy and tasty as far as soda bread goes.

Our family LOVED this recipe too.  Didn't change a thing and it turned out great.  I'll definitely be making this again before next St. Pat's and add dried cranberries.  I will also try another reviewer's suggestion to use this for scones.  Great idea!

I grew up in NC and consider myself a good southern boy, but I may never make biscuits again.  I subbed butter for margarine in the dough, used raw sugar... and everyone in attendance thought it was great.  Next time, I'll make biscuit shapes instead of a loaf.  Can't wait to toast the leftovers with jam.

It was an excellent bread but the dough was very dry and crumbly once I was done with mixing...it took more than "slightly kneading" to get it to come together completely. Don't give up!

Good Bread! First time for making soda bread so I had nothing to compare it to.  It looked like a big rough biscuit.  I tried to make the x cut with a sharp knife but you really could not tell when it was done. I followed all the directions given but it did not look  like the picture posted with the recipe. It's looks were definately deceiving.....it was very tasty!! A sort of dense bread with a little bit of sweet and tangy flavor. I will make this again and not wait for St. Patty's day next time.

It doesn't get any easier. Great texture.  I used butter and added raisins. I'm going to use this same batter for a batch of scones. Many thanks to the submitter.

This is going to be on my st. paddy's day menu every year!  I lowered oven to 350 and baked for about an hour.  I also sprinkled sugar on loaf every time I basted. Thanks!

WOW!  My family loved this bread!  It reminded me of basic baking powder biscuits, but a little richer, and a loaf took less prep time than the biscuits.  Yummy!  We served it warm with a little honey butter and will be serving it again soon!

It turned out very good but I think I added a 1/2 cup extra flour.  (got distracted by kids and other food I was making).  Mine turned out to be more like a giant biscuit but the flavor was great.

I suppose this isn't traditional soda bread, but we loved it! I subsituted butter for the margarine and left out a tablespoon of sugar since we wanted more of a savory bread. Served it with butter, honey, and jam.

I creamed soft butter with sugar, then added dry ingredients--made it flat and tougher. follow directions as is, and form into flat disk. keep brushing loaf while in oven. use real butter and white flour for best taste. Added another tablespoon of sugar.

This is one of the best and easiest recipes for Irish Soda Bread.  I did follow some other suggestions by using my mixer for apx 10 minutes to add all the ingredients. I also added 1 cup of raisins which I think is a key ingredient for Irish Soda Bread.  I  lowered the temp to 350 and cooked it longer.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was so delicious. I've never had Irish Soda Bread before but now that I have I will make it often. Very easy and yummy! Only thing I did different was that I used butter in place of margarine. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely excellent! I used my kitchenaid mixer to blend it all together. A very easy recipe to prepare. I made three loaves and they went the first day! I am definately making these again. A wonderful flavor and sets up well.

This recipe was something like a glorified sweet flour biscuit. While good, it wasn't exactly inspiring. My two year old and husband think it is "okay" but didn't eat much of it...

This was definitely easy to prepare especially with my KitchenAid. I feel like this is a bit dense though. Maybe less flour? It's good for sopping up gravy at least!

So good and sooooo easy!  I will be making this again, however, I must say that I cut the flour by 1/2 cup as other reviewers said it had too much flour.  But I still gave it 5 stars as it's delish!

I really thought this was a wonderful bread, maybe not authentic Irish soda bread but myy corned beef and cabbage isn't either. Anyway, I made 2 loaves and added raisins to the second loaf. I did cook it at 375 for the 1st 30 min., basted turned down to 350, basted every 5 to 10 min. for the next 40 min. It was perfect. I think I my use this recipe and tweak it for several different uses. Just a good all around recipe.

My 5 year old and I made this yesterday for St. Patricks day and it was delish!  Very easy to make and just the right amount of sweetness.  I read on another recipe to make it a day ahead and I think that really help add to the flavor.

This was very easy and tasty. It didn't take too long to make and  the crust was perfectly crunchy. The flavor was slightly sweet-which was good considering the baking soda can be a bit overpowering. I didn't use raisins and I'm glad I didn't. It was perfect as-is.

Just made this for an office function to accompany Irish stew.  It was an absolute hit!  Very easy to make too.  I had one issue though - as I was making it, I realized that I was out of eggs and had no time to run to the store.  I used egg beaters - all I had was the cheese and chive variety, so I was a little concerned about how it would affect the taste.  In the end, it worked, and no one could taste the cheese/chive mix in the bread.

I've made this a couple of time and it always turns out perfect. I do use butter instead of margarine and cut it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender before adding the wet ingredients. Thanks for the easy and yummy recipe!

Very good! I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked for 50min. It was a little over baked so the inside was not very moist, but still taste good. Only used slightly less than 3tbsp each of buttermilk and butter for brushing the outside of the bread. The smell was wonderful while it’s baking in the oven!

My first experience with soda bread was so horrible that I was really hesitant to try another one, but this one claimed to be easy and it really was. It was delicious. It tasted a lot lik KFC biscuits to us. It was really fun to make for St. paddy's day, and I'm really excited to make it for something else now. It's going to be a new favorite with me. flaky on the outside, but really dense and moist on the inside. Just perfect.

I'm glad another reviewer mentioned how crumbly the dough was because I would've been concerned.  It came together easily as soon as I started kneeding it though.  The crust came out nice and crumbly and the inside was dense and soft.  I'm looking forward to having some toasted later.

This was great!! I've never had Irish Soad Bread before, so I have no idea if it was authentic or not, but I love it!  It has the texture of my favorite scones!

I cook in a grouphome, and I used this recipe for our "St Patrick's Day" lunch two days in a row. Both the clients and the staff loved it! It has a slight sweetness to it, yet it is moist. It is very easy to make. I will definetly use this recipe again!
