I've made this recipe several times now. It is one of my favorite wow desserts because it truely is a souffle that dosen't fall ! I made it once with powdered sugar instead of superfine and it made it much more sweet for those that like more sweet than tart.

I did not like this recipe because everyone that tried it in my house thought it was too tart. I also followed the instructions exactly and after removing the souffles from the oven, after 15-17 minutes, they completely deflated :(

It tasted like sweet eggs. Extremely sweet and very eggy. I find that the recipes with allrecipe require too much sugar and liquid which leaves them too sweet and soggy.

After I removed the ramekins from the oven and waited the 5 min. cool time, they cracked and started to fall.  The lemon curd I thought was essential as the souffle itself was light and boring.

This as my first time  at making any kind of soufflé and i turned out perfect! One tip though! 
Tip: stir in ingredients in slowly and DON’T use any electrical whipping utensils!

This was my first souffle and it rose very prettily and smelled wonderful. I am a huge lemon fan, but this was way too lemony w/out the balance of enough sugar...it was just too tart. 

I am not sure how you would fix it other than to maybe split the juice from the lemon between the lemon curd and the egg mixture- instead of adding the juice from a whole lemon to each part. Then of course add more sugar!
I really want to like this recipe, but it just wasn't quite there.

We waited a little too long to eat these I guess! They looked delicious right out of the oven. But after a while had fallen, cracked, and were very dense, but that was our fault. Which is why this gets at least 2 stars. Other than that though, it was way too sour and the zest gave it a bad texture. I would suggest either grating the zest very finely, or using about half of what was suggested and same with the juice. I guess if you like REALLY sour things this is for you. That or I used way to much zest, which is quite possible.

These are very good.  I had never made a souffle, and expected it to be a lot more difficult than it was.  They are tasty, they rose well, and they didn't require any exotic ingredients.  I did learn that a person can't make souffle in advance.  They're pretty flat now but they still taste great.

My wife and I made this lemon souffle tonight and hands down, it was awesome. It was our first time making a lemon souffle and was easier than expected. We went exactly by the recipe double teaming it, she made the first half and I did the second. Again, it was fabulous.
