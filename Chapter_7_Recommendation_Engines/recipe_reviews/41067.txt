Beautiful and moist!  It was easy to make and my family enjoyed it at breakfast (yes, even the kids with a cup of cocoa).  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I used 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice plus enough milk to make 1 cup- let it stand for 5 minutes, then add the 1/2 cup buttermilk as instructed.  Also, I used fresh eggs (instead of frozen egg product).  1/4 cup frozen egg product = 1 medium/large egg.
