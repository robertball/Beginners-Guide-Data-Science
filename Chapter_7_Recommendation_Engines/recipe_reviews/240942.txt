Easy to make and my family loves any cookies with nuts. These cookies would be pretty for a bridal shower or a baby shower and let's not forget Christmas!

So easy to make and the entire family loved them. For some reason they took longer to bake than what is stated in the recipe.

I used 3 1/2 cups of flour and cookies came out very dry. Also used pecans instead of walnuts. They do taste good.
