I don't understand why everyone thought this was going to be full of flavor if they followed the recipe exactly. Just look at the ingredients, none of them have a real bold flavor, of course your going to have to add spices! Its just common sense.... anyway I think that this was a good base for a delicious meatloaf. Just add some onion powder,garlic powder,salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese and you have a great recipe.

This was a little bland the first time around, so I added 1/2 yellow onion, 1/4 cup fresh parsley, 4 or 5 leaves of freshly chopped basil, and a little salt and pepper.  I also opted for fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This was a big hit with friends and family.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great with these changes: -Used Ground turkey (lean, organic) -used fresh spinach, sauteed in olive oil with a little garlic salt -used mix of cheddar and mozarella cheeses -added basil, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to the mix -used about a cup of crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs

Wow! I really like this recipe! I was looking for meatloaf with spinach and I'm very pleased. The only thing I've added is ketchup but I add that later when eating, not on the dish itself. It tastes great and has plenty of protein!

Fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  Only spices I used were a little salt and pepper.  I also used ground turkey.  Topped it off with ketchup when it was done (cause that's how I eat my meatloaf) YUMMY!  Making it again tonight.

Really good! I added cheddar as well and took the advice of another reviewer and used fresh spinach. I do think frozen would have been fine. I added seasoning salt and pepper as well. I will make a again and mashed or a baked potato will accomodate this nicely.

I'm wondering if using sharp cheddar instead of mozarella would improve the flavor.  I'm thinking of trying it this way.

Great Dish!! I was actually a little reluctant to make this; meatloaf to me has always had a tomato flavor and topping. But my husband wanted to use the spinach we had and walla I came across this recipe.  Ok on to the "review" part! I added a small amount of chopped green bell pepper, chopped yellow onion, and wheat crackers mixed with regular bread crumbs; with these additions this dish was DELICIOUS!!! I amazed myself for the first time!  So a great recipe just and with a few added ingrediants it's a turned into a deffinite keeper!! Thanks!

I needed a recipe to make with my farmers market spinach and this was a great choice. Very moist and easy to make with ingredients you can find often in the kitchen. I took others advice and added garlic powder, pepper, salt, and basil. I'll definitely make this meatloaf again.

Thought this would be a nice change of pace from my old tried & true meatloaf but I just didn't care for this.  The flavors just didn't combine well and I like all the ingredients. Also my hubby thought the cheese made the texture of the meatloaf too mushy. I will not be making this again.

It was not very flavorful on it's own so I added ketchup when eating.  It did work well when I chunked some up and added it to jarred spagetti sauce for my daughters.  They ate it just fine.

This recipe was good, and I used rice bread crumbs to make it gluten free. I seasoned the crumbs with 2 TB of Parsley flakes, 1 tsp each of Onion powder, Garlic Powder, Basil and Oregano (Put it all in the food processor)... this gave the bread crumbs some good flavor, although I must agree with the other posters that it could use a little bit more of a kick. I ended up putting some ketchup on it when it was served, which helped.

I also realized that I really need to get a thermometer!!

I thought this recipe was good although originally rather dry. I added a small chopped yellow onion, basil, salt, and pepper to the recipe to give it more flavor and it came out moist and delicious.

Next time I make this I'll add more spinach, less bread crumbs and more seasonings.  It was bland and kind of dry.  But I think it has potential!

This could use a few more seasonings and a half cup milk to make it more moist, but overall pretty good.

I am a Cajun from S. Louisiana so needless to say I chose to put everything except the kitchen sink into this recipe. I added about 5-6 chopped mushrooms, 1 can of draines rotel tomatoes, 1/2 yellow onion, 3-4 cloves garlic and seasoned it Cajun style. ALso instead of putting the rest of the cheese on top of the loaf I made a Mozarella Sauce using the recipe White Nacho Cheese Sauce and substituting the cheese for mozarella. The I added lots of black Pepper to the sauce. My husband raved about this.

Great quick family meal. I didn't have an hour, so I divided the mix into four mini loaf pans and cooked them for 30 min. Hubby said, "yummy!" twice during dinner so that means if he were writing this it would be a five star review. Four stars for me.

It didn't knock my socks off but it was a nice change of pace.  The end slices were a bit dry but this was definitely easy to make and had a new flavor for meatloaf.  I can't think what I would do differently since I think a beef gravy would be overpowering.  I served it with a veggie alfredo noodle and followed the recipe exactly.

This was good. Wouldn't say it knocked my socks off. Was a bit dry and blander than I expected. Needed some salt and pepper. If I make again I'd try adding some basil or something too. Also with other meatloafs, I've used fresh bread crumbs (a slice or two) which seem to make a moister loaf. Thank you for a different recipe.

I usually avoid meatloaf and truly don't like it...but this caught my eye as it didn't look blah and boring. It came out pretty Good! I did add 1tbsp of Parmesan cheese, onion powder & garlic powder. I also added fresh parsley. S/P to taste. I sprinkled alil bit of water over it and alil into the pan to keep it from being dry. I tented it for 45mins and then uncovered it for the remaining 15mins. I'm Glad I looked at some of the reviews and added the spices! or I think it would have been bland. However next time I will use only 1cp of bread crumbs...as it was alil too "bready" for me. I would have given it 5*s if indidnt have to add anything to it or slightly modify the origjnal receipe. My hubby loved it as is and it's definitely a keeper and a meatloaf I can finally say..."I'll eat!" (without forcing it down with a fake smile).

This is the only way I like meatloaf and have been making this for years. I add 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and a chopped onion to the meatloaf. I mix the rest of the soup with the cheese and add enough milk to make a sauce. When the meatloaf is done, I pour the sauce on top and put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes. YUM!

My husband and I did not care for this.  I thought it was dry and lacked flavor.  I usually make the Brown Sugar Meatloaf from this site, but I wanted something different.  However, this was disappointing!

We sauteed fresh spinach with onion and garlic before adding to the meat.  I think mushrooms would be a good addition too.  Only other change was to bake on a broiler pan, not a loaf pan, as we usually do with any beef meatloaf, to let the grease drain off as it cooks.  Loved it.

I have made my own version of this recipe for awhile and the only thing I do differently is add one envelope of Lipton onion soup mix and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese and it gives the meat great flavor!  I get compliments all the time even from my 13 year old who doesn't like spinach!

Used fresh spinach and 4 eggs. didn't have Italian seasoning so used garlic salt, and basil and oregano. Could have used a bit more salt. We all enjoyed it a lot.

Thought this would be a nice change of pace. I just didn't care for this. It came out very dry. The flavors just didn't combine well. Also my husband thought the cheese made the texture of the meatloaf taste strange. I will not be making this again.

I normally don't like meatloaf, but this was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was great.  I actually added more spinach, my personal preference, but overall I enjoyed making this dish.  It was very easy.
