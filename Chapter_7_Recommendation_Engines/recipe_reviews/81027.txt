Awesome Casserole.  I made this for two different families last week and for ourselves.  It got rave reviews, even one 7 year old who doesn't eat anything mixed together!  I followed some other reviewers advice and changed it in the following ways: I used 4 boneless skinless breasts and boiled them in plain water.  Instead of the homemade broth, I used 1-2 cup chicken broth.  I used a Tbsp dried chopped onion instead of onion powder, one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of broccoli.  I also added about 2 cups of frozen broccoli florets. I omitted the celery and replaced it with 1/2 tsp celery seed. I varied one batch with jasmine rice instead of plain rice too (it turned out great and gave me an idea for a curry version of this recipe... I will post once I try and figure it out!).  This is a great recipe and I will definately make it again, and again (good for potlucks too).

This is pretty good, and my family really enjoys it. I've made it several times because it gets rave reviews. However, I gave it four stars instead of five because I made a few changes. I only use two to three chicken breasts and don't make my own homemade broth. I also use two cups of rice (brown rice, which I cooked in store-bought chicken broth instead of adding broth to the mixture), one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of dried minced onion instead of the onion powder, and I added about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of chopped broccoli. I also mixed a cup of sharp cheddar in with the rest of the ingredients and then topped the whole thing with another cup of cheddar and the crushed crackers. I skipped adding the butter to the crackers. It turned out pretty darn good, and my whole family enjoyed it. It was also pretty easy to make, and is fairly easy to adjust to suit your tastes so I'd definitely recommend it.

Really good comfort food. I followed the recipe. I agree with other reviewers that it needs more rice. I was happy that I was able to freeze some of the chicken broth. Way better than canned!

I took the advice of: irenemua. "I use 2 boneless chicken breasts, 1 can or cream of chicken and 1 can or broccoli and cheese condensed soups, no celery salt, and add in a small bag of defrosted frozen broccoli florets. I also just sprinkle Ritz crackers on top without dredging in butter and sprinkle shredded Cheddar into the mixture before baking. Bravo!" And it was REALLY good.

This is absolutely delicious. Everyone I have ever served it to has loved it. I use 2 boneless chicken breasts, 1 can or cream of chicken and 1 can or broccoli and cheese condensed soups, no celery salt, and add in a small bag of defrosted frozen broccoli florets. I also just sprinkle ritz crackers on top without dredging in butter and sprinkle shredded cheddar into the mixture before baking. Bravo!

Absolutely loved it!  I did add a second cup of cooked rice and a bit of cheddar cheese on top but other than that, didn't change a thing.  Everyone had second helpings - that cracker topping was really good.  Not a low fat recipe, but a nice treat every now and then -definitely a keeper!

I found this recipe to be somewhat bland and runny. The second time I made it, I added 1/2 cup more rice and a 1/2 cup more homemade chicken stock, changed one can of cream of chicken soup to one can of cream of celery soup, decreased the salt by half but doubled the celery salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder to add flavor.  To introduce vegetables into this casserole, add broccoli or peas.  HELPFUL HINT:  Use rotisserie chicken from your local market on busy nights to speed the process along.

This recipe was just ok.  I will try it again with some modification.  I will skip making the stock and just cut up cooked chicken.  I will use chicken broth in place of it and cut it down to 1/2c. or less (to runny with 1 c.).  It needs some crunch so I will but some celery/onion/almonds to it.

I made this skipping the broth step only because I just don’t have that much time on a weeknight.  I just used store bought broth and skinless boneless chicken breast.  I cut up and fried the chicken in some olive oil before adding it.  I also used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccoli cheese (that is what I had).  I added two cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I thought it turned out okay.  Then yesterday when I was ready to eat the left overs, I scraped of most of the crackers (so it wouldn’t get too mushy), put it in the microwave warmed it just enough to be able to stir it.  I added ¾ a can of mushroom soup, another six oz of sour crm, and about ¼ cup of chicken broth, mixed it all together again and put new crackers on top. I put it back into a smaller casserole dish.  And the left overs (about half the 9 X 13) turned out awesome.  It was so better then the first day.  I will definitely make this again.  I plan on making it on the weekend with the homemade broth.  But don’t pass this recipe just because of the time to make the homemade broth.  It is worth it if you use the store bought broth.

This recipe is delicious! I had a couple of friends over after work so I made this the night before, up to the point where you sprinkle the crackers over it. This is definitely a comfort food dish. My guests loved it and all asked for the recipe. So quick, easy, and yummy - you can't go wrong! Next time I am going to try to make a healthier version, low-fat soups and brown rice.

This is a great recipe!  I do recommend using an extra cup of rice, as others have suggested. Also, just hand crush the ritz crackers and it makes a great topping. 
Can use a can of cream of celery and omit the celery in the beginning.

Yes, I changed this recipe, but it deserves 5 stars. My 18 month old ate 4 helpings and my uber-picky 8 year old actually asked me to make it again! We don't use condensed soups because of the MSG, so I made a roux-based chicken gravy using chicken stock (3 TBS butter, 3 TBS flour, brown then add 2 c good chicken stock). here are all of my changes: meat from a rotisserie chicken, 2 c brown rice, the homemade gravy, 6 oz sour cream, 3/4 tsp onion powder, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp pepper. covered with cheese. I had bread crumbs to use up, so I melted 2 TBS butter, mixed it with 1 c bread crumbs and sprinkled that on top. 

I have made similar casseroles, but none with sour cream, and that's what makes this amazing. This will be a new staple in our house!

Shared this recipe 7 years ago and my family still loves this dish.  From your much appreciated reviews I have followed some of your suggestions and learned to make this better than the original recipe.  The amount of cooked rice in the recipe is 3 cups, probably a typo on my part when I posted this one...Sorry!  My most recent addition to this dish is sliced water chestnuts.  Adds a nice crunch throughout when you cut the slices in half before adding.  Love using cheddar cheese on top.  The guys in my house must have the cracker topping, too, though. Cooking is all about experimenting.  I am so happy you enjoyed mine!

My family LOVED this recipe. I didn't follow it exactly, casseroles are very forgiving making them great even if you don't have all the ingredients, or want/need to substitute something. I did double the rice (I used 1 c. UNCOOKED rice, which would make 2 c. cooked, which I think is what the recipe should be) I cubed the chicken and sauteed with butter and garlic and added a bit more of the seasonings. I divided it among 2 square pyrex glass dishes and froze one. It came out perfect both times (even after freezing). Thank you for such a simple, yet delicious recipe!

Great recipe... Though I did change some stuff. Instead of using Onion and Garlic Powder, I used one small yellow onion and 3 cloves of garlic. I Sauteed those with celery for a few minutes with some Vegetable base and olive oil, then added the chicken etc. Also I used one can of Cream of Chicken and one can of Cream of Mushroom. Like others suggested, I add a cup of cheese to the mix and then added another cup under the Cracker Topping. The stock was really good and easy to make, you have to boil the chicken anyway so why not make it yourself. Oh and definitely double the rice, I couldn't image it being thick enough with only one cup.  Great Recipe!

Bland, but edible.  The chicken stock is unecessary and makes the dish too runny.  I'd leave it out, double the rice, add a veggie (peas, green beans, or broccoli), and maybe some herbs (basil, rosemary, or marjoram).  This isn't bad, really, but it's just a bit "blah".

Very good. I added cooked broccoli and carrot pieces.   Instead of Ritz type crackers, I used saltines as that was all I had in the house.

My family enjoyed this and it was easy to make.  My picky daughter ate her whole helping and requested it again next week!  I added one more cup of rice and didn't use butter.  To me it was a little bland, so next time I will probably add a can of broccoli cheese soup like other reviewers.  After tasting this, that seems like it would be a good addition.  I will make this again with that change! :)

I thought this tasted very good but it needs more rice.  I think 2 cups of rice would be better.  I also threw some shredded cheese in mine and it was great!

Tasty & easy.  I used rotisserie chicken & a cup of store-bought chicken stock, but those were my only substitutions.  Will make again!

I used 3/4 of a leftover crockpot chicken from earlier in the week.  I used chicken flavored bullion for my rice and added onion, garlic and the celery to the rice when cooking.  I used chicken stock in place of water (adding it to cream of chicken and cream of broccoli soups) and added 3/4 bag of defrosted frozen broccoli.  Added garlic and onion powder, paprika, and lots of black pepper to taste.  It was delicious and with the modifications I made there is barely any left for lunches.

This was very good but took me way more time than suggested to prepare.  I also think it would have benefitted from more rice, and I used a second cup.  I would add a third cup next time.  I used the 99% fat free soups and it's rich enough without the extra fat.  My husband loved it, I liked it, and I probably will not make it again.  Too much work for the results.

I thought this recipes was delicious and easy to make.  I added fresh mushrooms when I made it.  However, next time I'll double the amount of chicken and rice called for and add some broccoli as well.

This was the bomb! I made a few modifications, I used one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom, I also used 2 c. rice, minced onion garlic salt, pepper and added 2 c. shredded cheddar. for the topping I layered one cup cheese then mixed bread crumbs with butter and sprinkled on top. My kids loved it and my hubby got seconds which he never does!

I added more garlic and some Mrs. Dash original for more flavor. I omitted the butter and just lightly crushed the crackers. This is my second attempt at this recipe. My family and I thought it was much more flavorful than the original. I will definitely make it again and plan to add broccoli next time as many of you have suggested.

What a pleasant surprise!  I have to admit that I wasn't quite sure about this, but I served it to my husband and in-laws tonight, and we all had seconds.  I used 2 cups of rice (just did an Uncle Ben's Ready Rice whole grain brown and long grain rice,) instead of the chicken soup, I used cream of broccoli, and I used ready-made broth.  My only complaint was that it is a bit salty, so I'll try to do a lower sodium soup next time, or I will omit the celery salt.  I'll definitely do this again!

I have made this dish several times and it is always a hit.  Since I have a family of 4 I use 2 to 3 cups cooked rice and put half in a 9x9 dish to cook and freeze the other half for a quick meal later.  Tonight I used fried onions for the topping and it was great.  Plus I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery soup.  Yumm.

My family just can't get enough of this stuff!! My boyfriend - who I've been cooking for, for 7 yrs - has a few favorites of mine... but he could eat this every day if I'd let him. This recipe is yummy and fills you up quickly - it is also great to re-heat the next day (if you have any left).

This was delicious!  I kept thinking it was going to come out bad because i felt the chicken was not enough and I wondered where the cheese was, but it was perfect.  I even used the wrong casserole size and thought it wouldnt cook thoroughly but it did.  I omitted the celery salt because I did not have any on hand, but it was still delicious.  Will definatly make again with no changes!!!

LOVED this dish! Even though I tweaked the original recipe a bit to satisfy our tastes, that is exactly why I still gave it 5 stars! It is such a great base recipe on its own, but can easily be changed to suit the cook.  Here are some of my minor changes:
Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I used 1 can of that and 1 can of cream of mushroom to keep it from being overpowered by the chicken soup taste. Worked great!
I added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and one can of chopped green chilis to the mixture before putting the cracker/butter mixture on top to bake - again, small change, but super yummy!
I could see adding more veggies as an option, too:
sliced carrots, peas or even broccoli would be delish! 
This is a great new dish to put in any busy familiy's dinner rotation - we loved it!

I must admit, when I had mixed everything together and was putting it in the pan to cook -- I did not think it was going to be good.  It was way too soupy, and I was already trying to think of an alternate dinner plan.  However, the dish surprised me.  It was quite tasty.  I made it as stated but without the celery.

Here's what I did different.  I took 1 cup raw rice and cooked it; I think it yields about 2.5-3 cups cooked rice.  Set aside.  In mixing bowl, I combine 8oz. sour cream, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 tbsp. celery SEED, 1 tbsp. onion powder, 1/2 tbsp. garlic powder pepper and some salt.  I put the cooked rice into the mixture and I GRILL chicken breasts (with the skin on) - just brush them with olive oil and discard the skin when cooked.  Pull apart chicken and add into mixture.  Top with 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and crushed Ritz crackers.  I use low fat soups and cheese; regular sour cream.  Gosh, its the best!!!  Family goes crazy over it!

This was very good. I did make a few modications. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and boiled them. I did not have any canned chicken broth or celery. Boneless breast dont make a good broth so I added celery salt, reg salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon.   I used one can of cream of chicken and one cream of celery. Also added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to mixture and then a layer under the cracker crumbs.  Cracker crumbs make this recipe! Next time i will add extra!

Great recipe! I lower the fat in anything I make, so here's what I did with this one: used boneless skinless breasts, fat free sour cream, low-fat/low-sodium cream of chicken & reduced fat Ritz crackers. With these changes I was okay with the butter, because there is no good substitute. I am not a celery fan - so I skipped it. Great!

This is a very nice and easy recipe that's perfect for those on-the-go evenings. True comfort food. I used "healthy cream of mushroom soup" and also added some parm cheese with the cracker topping. Thank you so much!!

I have to laugh at myself. I made as stated and my first reaction was "this is kind of bland." I was thinking I would rate it 3 stars. I kept wanting more though and ended up having 3 servings! I still think it could use a little more spices or have some veggies added in but it is good comfort food the way it is.

This was just okay to me.  I added cayenne to give it a kick but it still lacked depth of flavor.  If you have kids this is probably going to please them but I wouldn't make it again personally.

Love this casserole...but only gave it a 4 star rating because I do make a couple changes to my taste and then it becomes a 5 star review to me.  the  things I do different is put a layer of shredded cheese then put the cracker and butter crumb mixture on top...and I add veggies.  sometimes broccoli and sometimes kernel corn depending on which veggie I am feeling like.  I also do not boil the chicken I just cook the chicken in the oven with chicken broth instead of water in the pan and I use the drippings in place of the broth and if it is still a little to thick I add a little milk.

Very good. Will make again. I did make a few changes. I only had enough brown rice for 1/2 c. cooked, so I also made 1 c. whole wheat rotini to thorw in. I added a leftover 1/2 brick of cream cheese, and a 1/2 container of Philadelhia Cooking Creme Savory Garlic flavor. I also, sprinkled a tub of shaved parmesan cheese over the casserole, before adding the cracker topping. Served it with salad and toasted ciabatta rolls. The whole family loved it. A definite keeper!

This was very good. Made just a few changes. Added a 1/4 cup of onion to chicken mixture. I also added sliced almonds to the mixture. I put a layer of cheese under the cracker mixture. And for a final touch, I added some crushed cheese and garlic croutons to the cracker mixture. Family loved it!

Very good recipe! I only used one chicken breast because I was only cooking for two. Also, I realized while I was cooking that I forgot sour cream at the supermarket, so I substituted a couple tablespoons of onion and chive cream cheese which thickened up the soup mixture nicely. I mixed in a handful of chopped carrots and broccoli and omitted the butter. You really don't need it. I toasted the cracker crumbs for a couple minutes under the broiler before serving. The title doesn't lie! It was delicious!

I cut this to 3 breasts (used allrecipes' calculation adjustments for that), made extra rice, added extra crackers also and added shredded cheese on top--all as several others suggested. Had plenty of flavor. LOVED it!!!

Fabulous Recipe! Hardy, delicious, cozy, comfort food. Huge hit at my house....kids and husband scarfed it down and LOVED it. We had enough left over for a next day meal:)I left out the celery and celery salt (i didn't have it) I used Uncle Bens dirty rice in a box ( 2 boxes).....probably 2 cups more ritz crackers crushed because I love a thick layer of crunch....and it was awesome. Definitely making this again. Thanks for the recipe

I changed up the recipe a little bit, but not too far off and it was absolutely delicious. My son had a friend over for dinner and he had his mom call me to get the recipe because he loved it so much. 

What I changed: I used store bought broth instead of making my own. I cooked the chicken pieces with some minced garlic, chopped onion, finely chopped celery, fresh broccoli chopped into little pieces, a little oregano, salt and pepper. I left out the garlic and onion powders. I used one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of mushroom. I added a shredded 4 cheese blend to the top of the mixture before I added the crackers. Also, I did not melt a whole stick of butter and mix it with the crackers. I melted a quarter stick of butter and drizzled it on the crackers after I put them on top, before putting in the oven. It really was delicious! It was even good the next day heated up. I will definitely make this again.

Just like it's title. Delicious! I would add a bit more rice next time to make it stretch a little further.

I made this thinking that there would be enough for two nights. My husband loved it so much that I had to make something else the next night. Great dish! * I did add cheddar cheese to mix and topping and about and extra cup of rice.

I definitely say double the rice!  Also, I didnt divert from the recipe except for that and I found that it was delicious.  Once I realized how much soup mixture there was compared to rice, I used 1/2 the soup mixture one night, refrigerated it then used the other 1/2 at the end of the week with a new batch of rice.

Loved it.  I didn't have Cream of Chicken, so I used Cream of Mushroom.  Also used real onions rather than the powder.  Very delicious.

Really good, but I too added more rice, chopped green onions and green chilis for a lot more flavor. Easy to make and gets eaten rather quickly!

This was delicious!! I'm pregnant so it is very hard for me to find things to fit those unbearable cravings!! I followed the direction except I used cream of mushroom instead and when mixing it i topped it with shredded cheese then crushed crackers then melted butter drizzled on top with a second layer of cheese and crackers. It was absolutely yummmmmmy.

Good recipe, I made this for company this past weekend. I made a few changes, I used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of broccoli & cheese, added 2 cups of rice and a bag of frozen broccoli as well as added cheddar cheese. It was a bit time consuming, but everyone loved it.

Delicious and warmed up really well later. Skipped the bone-in chicken and instead just used boneless breasts an it worked fine. Also - used brown rice instead of white and put in 2 cups instead of 1.  Skipped the butter and used oyster crackers instead. Also- added in a whole bag of frozen peas and carrots as well as about a cup of chopped celery to add more veggies. delicious!

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this.  I am an experienced cook and followed the recipe to a T.  It tasted like it came from a box -- over processed and fake.  I would never make this again.

This is an easy casserole to put together. The only change I made was to use cream of celery. I don't care at all for cream of chicken. Next time I make it I will definitely add peas to the casserole.

I didn't care much for this. I'm wondering if the one cup of cooked rice meant one cup of raw rice because this needed at least 3 cups of cooked rice. I used 2, per other reviews, and it still wasn't enough. It also needed vegetables. The cracker topping didn't work for me.

Really, really excellent casserole.  Kids ate it, and 2 year old asked for seconds (never happens!).  My husband had thirds, and had to stop himself from going back for more!  Made it pretty much as the recipe called, used rotisserie chicken seasoning instead of the individual spices, and added a (drained) can of french cut green beans to sneak some veggies in on the kids.  YUMMY!

This wasn't bad. It was a bit too "liquidy" for me at first. Today it is better. I added some fresh chopped onion (just a bit); more celery seed; omitted the celery salt; and used leftover roast chicken from Sam's Club (just chopped it up and didn't bother with the first step of the recipe).  Also, my crumb topping was a mixture of generic ritz crackers and a small amount of corn flakes. I also added some fresh shredded parmesan cheese. This wasn't mind boggling but it was decent.

I just made this recipe yesterday for today's potluck.  I cut up the chicken into chunks because I was serving it to a group and that works better than whole breasts.  This is the third recipe very similar to this that I've tried.  The first was way too bland and I've been stepping up the flavors on subsequent efforts. My changes:  I used the 3 cups cooked rice that the original submitter said was really needed (later correction), added about 1/8 cup finely minced onion and 1/8 cup chopped red bell pepper, left out the onion powder, used one can celery and one can cream of chicken soup, and added about 2 ounces of green peas.  My observations:  The peas and bell pepper added to the attractiveness of the dish and I found it much tastier than previous versions.  On the downside, I had half of it left and I think it was mostly because it still lacks pizzazz on a potluck table; also, it could have still had more flavor.  I think it's worth sticking with, but future tries will include more green peas, slightly cooked carrots, about 1/2 cup finely chopped onion and more bell pepper.  Also, my rice was a bit too sticky and I will try to find a rice that stays looser.  All in all, I thought it was a good tasting dish and my leftovers won't go to waste, but I want to continue to refine it a bit.  Many thanks to the person who submitted it.

I made this casserole for the very first time and it was a huge success!!! It came out deliciously. I just didn't use the recipe exactly as it was written. I what I did do was steal some of the other peoples' ideas I saw in their reviews (thank you all). Instead of boiling the rice in water, I boiled it in chicken broth. I saw quite a few people wrote that they used broccoli instead of celery sticks, so I used that and finally, instead of using buttery round crackers, I used Ritz crackers. Wow - it was great!!! So many of you had some wonderful, creative ideas. I will definitely try it again.

Delicious!!

I made this without the broth and added cheddar cheese on top and in the casserole. I used only one can of cream of chicken.  My husband asked for seconds and thirds!!  Very easy to do. You could also add mushrooms or broccoli.  I did put the cracker in butter and it was soo good!  This is a repeat for sure!

Used crm of celery and crm of mushroom soup, 2 cups rice, sauted onion and garlic and omitted celery salt and onion powder.  Added maybe a cup of frozen mixed veggies to make it a full meal! Also mixed in about 1 cup of cheddar and 1/2 cup over the Ritz crackers.    Very yummy.

Definitely add the extra cup of rice, a cup of mixed veggies and a half cup of shredded cheddar.  I left out the butter since I added cheese.  Great the next day, too.

Very good recipe...I added frozen mixed vegetables to the rice the last few minutes it was steaming and topped with french fried onions the last 10 min.  Only had 1 can of chicken & herbs and 1 cream of celery so I used those and omitted the celery salt.  Figured with all the salty soup, it didn't need any more.  I had cooked extra rice so didn't measure it, just added enough to soak up some of the extra soup.  Served with ground red pepper.  Will make again.

Excellent comfort food dinner! I used other user's recommendation to use 2 cups of rice though and feel like an entire stick of butter was not necessary with the cracker topping.

Big hit in my house!  I used half water and half chicken broth when I was cooking the chicken to add a little bit more flavor.  I also added a sprinkle of cheese.

Topped with Irish cheddar and fried onions. This was a great dish. Simple and easy. Also used a whole chicken cooked in celery, onion, and carrot to improve stock.

I was let down by this recipe, especially after reading all of the positive reviews. It was bland. I did make some adjustments due to what I had on hand. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and I boiled the chicken in water seasoned with soy sauce, worcestershire, garlic and onion powder, and a little yellow sandwich mustard. The chicken itself turned out great, it had a nice flavor and a little zing. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of broccoli, 1 can cheese soup, 1 can of mixed veggies, 1 small can diced mushrooms, and used cream cheese with a little lemon juice mixed in instead of sour cream, because I didn't have any. I only had a few butter crackers, so I combined them with a few French's crispy fried onions and smashed them up all together and spread on top of the casserole, then topped it all off with some shredded cheddar cheese. Despite all of that, it was still very bland. If I do make this again, I will try 2 cans cream of chicken and 1 can golden mushroom, and I will also try flavoring the rice more, as that seemed to be the most bland.

Perhaps my favorite recipe on this site. I usually add extra rice, maybe a half to three quarters cup just to make it stretch further. Freezes and reheats fantastic.

Great way to use up leftover rice and even leftover chicken (I often use some from a freshly stewed chicken, as well as some of the stock from it instead of boiling breasts all on their own)!

I love this recipe! Instead of cooking the chicken myself, I just use a rotisserie chicken. I also double the rice and add some dill, as well. Many times I will sprinkle sharp cheddar on the top instead of using crackers.

My dad is a chef and I repeatedly lost his recipe for company chicken over several military moves. Too sheepish to ask again, I looked for a replacement. This was close. Very yummy! We leave out the celery and add more rice to stretch it. Total comfort food!

This was really good!  But, I have completely changed it since. I like to make my own cream of chicken soup (not as hard as you would think, very easy) and use fresh onions and garlic.  I also add some carrots and mushrooms and herbs.

This casserole is pretty good. It's not fantastic, but it is good. I added an extra cup of rice and subbed a can of cream of celery soup for one of the cans of cream of chicken. I also omitted the butter from the crackers--it isn't needed. I added one cup of shredded cheddar. I'm glad I did--it adds a bit of extra flavor. It's a bit on the bland side, but still good. I hope my kids like it as much as I do.

This recipe turned out tasty enough but was way too soupy.  Another cup of rice would have been good or perhaps some added brocoli or other vegetable to the mix.  Even some shredded cheese would have helped.

I thought this had very good flavoring, but I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes. Also, I might have done something wrong but it was very runny. But I used boneless skinless chicken, used chicken broth instead of using the homemade one, garlic salt instead of celery salt (because I don't have any) and added a tiny bit of minced garlic. Would try it again, just watch the amount of liquids before adding it all in again.

This is very chicken-y and very soupy even after adding almost 2 cups of brown rice. After I added about 1 tbsp of thyme and a little bit of ground sage the base was much tastier. I made this with precooked chicken breast so I used canned chicken broth. I added 2-3 cups of chopped spinach and also substituted garlic salt for the celery salt and increased the onion powder. Next time I make this I will try leaving out one of the cans of condensed soup or using closer to 3-4 cups of rice.

Excellent! I used this recipe as a base, substituting cream of celery for the cream of chicken (because that's what I had), substituting egg noodles for the rice. I retained the celery from the broth and also added some peas for color. The broth added great flavor. The kids and I both loved it!

Good weeknight dinner - it flew off my table. Very kid friendly comfort food type casserole. I used rotisserie chicken which makes the recipe so much easier. The other changes I'd recommend it doubling the rice at the minimum (its too saucy otherwise). Double the garlic and mix in fresh onion instead of the onion powder to give the dish more texture. To add a colorful/nutritious element some steamed or frozed/defrosted broccoli florets might be nice too. The topping was great - I might do more of that next time too. We'll likely try this one more in the future.

This was delicious.  I omitted the celery because my husband hates celery, but I did use the celery salt.  Next time I won't boil the chicken ahead of time.  Maybe grill it or bake it a little first before putting in the casserole.  I used boneless breasts.  My kids didn't like it very much which was surprising, but we liked it very much.  I also added slivered almonds.

Because it is just my husband and I, I used two boneless chicken breasts and micro waved it in water (barely covered) until just shreddable.  The changes I made were to use two cups of Brown Jasmine rice, one cup of Swanson chicken broth instead of making my own broth, and caramelized one onion instead of using onion powder and celery salt.  I prefer shredding the chicken instead of cutting it because I think the sauce sticks better.  If you like spicy dishes, this is not the dish for you.  You may want to add some jazz.  This recipe is an excellent base for adding veggies or other ingredients.  We liked it.

Very good and a great way to use leftovers! I use the leftover rice from takeout Chinese and then buy one of those already cooked rotisserie chickens at the grocery store. I then use chicken broth since I didn't make my own. I also use the healthy cream of chicken soup and low-fat sour cream and don't put the butter on the crackers to make it a little more healthy but not taking away from flavor. Reheats very well since there is always leftovers since it is just my husband and I.

Changes to fit my liking: I halved the recipe and just cooked the 2 chicken breasts in a pan, then chopped. I still used 1 cup cooked brown rice,  3/4 cup chicken broth, 1/2 tsp celery seed, 3/4 tsp onion powder, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and I used 3/4 cup whole wheat breadcrumbs with 1/4 stick of melted butter for the topping. I also threw in half a small bag of frozen mixed veggies.

Not a lot of flavor.  The topping was the only tasty part.

I don't know if I did something wrong...I added an extra cup of rice (as suggested) but this still turned out extremely soupy! It was also very bland. I wouldn't make it again.

Like many of the reviewers, I tweaked this recipe.  Instead of 1 cup of rice, I used 3.5 - 4 cups.  I used 4 chicken breasts with skin & bones to make my broth and I had PLENTY of broth left over.  I took out one cup for the recipe and used some of the broth to cook my 3.5 - 4 cups of brown rice.  I sauteed one onion & 3 ribs of celery in 2 T. butter until tender and added to the casserole.  I used one can of low fat cream of chicken & one reg. can cream of onion soup.  I topped the casserole with 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and topped with lightly buttered Ritz cracker crumbs.  This is a really good recipe and it invites tweaking to your taste.  One nice plus, while it only uses 4 chicken breast halves, even meat lovers won't feel cheated.  Making it with four cups of cooked rice made a HUGE 9 x 13 casserole.  (About 8 - 10 servings).  This would be a great do ahead recipe.  Mix it up and bake just before serving!

My family loved this!  I made a lower fat version - used 1 can of regular cream of chicken with 1 can of 98% fat free soup.  I also used low fat sour cream.  I accidentally left off the butter altogether (meant to use about 1/8 cup, but really didn't even miss it).  I used 2 cups of rice as other reviewers had done.

I thought this was pretty good, but it didn't pass the toddler test like my other rice casserole.  I doubled the rice, and glad I did, I really think it needs it.  I also added a cup of cheddar cheese after i tasted it, because i thought it was relatively bland.  I also left out the butter in the topping, and i thought that it was a nice alteration.  If i make again, I would try cream of celery soup, like my other recipe, for more flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I substituted Jasmine rice and instead of crackers crumbled on the top I added french fried onions.  My family loved it!  I think I will add peas to it next time as well.  I think this will become a family favorite!!

Yum- we loved this! But, I cannot imagine this without some kind of vegetable added, it was slightly soupy, but still yummy with broccoli added. I used boneless breasts and it turned out great.

This recipe was DELICIOUS.  The best casserole I have ever tasted.  My husband, who doesn't care for casseroles, DEVOURED it and took some to work.  I did change the recipe a little because I didnt have all of the ingredients.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and I didn't put celery in it either.

I followed other reviewers and added extra rice; about 1 cup of cheddar cheese. A little extra garlic and some Jane's Crazy Mixed Up salt (about 1/2 teaspoon). It was GREAT!.

This is one of my family's new favorite recipes!  My husband LOVES it!  This recipe is one where anything goes.  Have leftover chicken or rice you have to use up?  You don't need exact measurements!  I've added more or less chicken, rice, celery, sour cream, and/or crackers than the recipe calls for, and it still turns out terrific every time!  I've made it for potlucks, company, and just for us, and I've had people begging me for the recipe or asking for more.  If you're searching for a fantastic potluck casserole, or a comfort food to prepare for those cold winter nights, this is it!

Great!  I added 8 oz sharp cheddar (half on top with the crushed crackers and half mixed into the recipe) and a 22 oz (cooked) bag of frozen broccoli florets.  A very versitale recipe.  Quick and easy with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen.

LOVE IT! I added 1 can of drained corn and did add the extra rice as suggested and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt... I cut up celery and onions and cooked them in some butter too before I added them to the casserole. YUMMOOOOO... I loved this recipe.. It was so good. Bet you could add some broccoli to it for something green in it... Let it stand after you cook it for about 10 minutes before serving.

I'm sorry, but I just don't get all the rave reviews.  I love all types of chicken and rice dishes and this was too soupy until I read some reviews and decided to add another 3 cups of cooked rice along with 2 cans of Ro-tel tomatoes since I was short on time and on hand ingredients.  It was really bland at first not colorful at all.  I'll probably end up eating it as will my children since we're not picky eaters, but I'm betting that once my husband gets home he will take one bite and order a pizza.

This was so good! I used chicken that I had cooked earlier, so I just simmered some 3 stalks of celery, 1 chopped onion, 1/2 cup of frozen peas, and 2 grated carrots in about a cup of broth, until crisp/tender. I added garlic pepper and about a cup of hsredded cheddar. I also doubled the rice and crumbled the crackers right over top with my hands (no butter) per other reviews. My family loved it, and I loved the versatility of this recipe-- just throw in whatever you have on hand!

Very good casserole, and not too rich.  Followed the instructions from the other reviews, one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery. I also doubled the rice to 2 cups and added cheddar cheese to the mixture and with the bread crumbs on top. My only complaint was that I didnt add enough salt. Other than that, its very good!! Will make again!

It was good but not really a keeper as far as taste goes. I found it doesn't freeze very well. Only froze it for a week and the whole of it turned out soggy.

Excellent! I cooked both my chicken and rice in chicken broth and added an extra 2 cups of rice as some had advised, but other than that I followed the recipe.  We so enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used leftover turkey in this and skipped having to cook the chicken as the recipe calls for. I used canned broth and also added an extra cup of rice. Easy and very good! I plan on making this often with lefover turkey or chicken.

Definitely sticks to your ribs, but just tastes a bit too creamy/fatty for my tastes.  I like to add some chopped celery and onion to the casserole, as well as use a can of cheddar soup in place of one of the cream of chicken, and I put in at least 2-3 cups of rice total.  Overall a good casserole, but not a great one.  My husband really likes it though so I have made it twice, and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

Best chicken & rice casserole I have found. The whole family loved it. It's not always easy to find something that pleases everyone in a home with four teens, but one did and it's a keeper for sure. Followed the recipe exactly & it was perfect - no need to change anything.

YUM!! I made this for the first time when some guests came over. Everyone loved it!! It is a bit time-consuming to make but completely worth it.  I did add a bit of cheese and slivered almonds (for texture) in the mixture and cheese to sprinkle on top. It was a hit ;)

I loved this dish! my cousin made it about a year ago, while we were both pregnant, and I craved it all the time, but we lost the recipe! i finally sat down to search for it, its that good! the only thing I changed was instead of two cans of cream of chicken, I did one can cream of chicken, and one can cream of mushroom, to add a little bit of richness to it. It is delightful!

Great recipe --I've made it lots of times. Just a few adjustments:1-1/4 cups rice (usually a mix of wild and regular rice) I use 98% fat free cream of chicken soup (actually tastes better with this) Real garlic, celery and onion (to take out the extra salt content. The onion can be dried minced onion). A lot of pepper. Marjoram (just because I like it in everything)

When I had my 2nd child, a woman from my church brought me a casserole very similar to this.  My husband begged me to get the recipe but she kept forgetting.  I found this recipe and believe it is just about the same thing.  I skip the broth step as I usually don't keep celery around.  I also use one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery.  I like more rice than indicated in the original recipe, I use 3 cups cooked rice (1 cup uncooked long grain).I sometimes add finely diced onions.  It is great comfort food either way.  Tastes great served with a slightly sweet dinner roll.

I love this. Using the stock from cooking the chicken in the casserole is a great idea, and I used two cups of it in which to cook the rice, which enhanced the flavor as well.

This was very good! I listened to the other reviewers and doubled the amount of rice.(I used brown rice) I also used 1 can of cream of chicken & 1 can of cream of mushroom & added 1 cup of fresh broccoli to it. I also sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top before I added the cracker mixture. I know I added alot, but I still think it would be very good without the changes.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  It had much better flavor than some of the other chicken and rice casseroles I've made.  I did add an extra cup of rice after reading other reviews...glad I did.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

I'll give this a 5 because of the ease, and when you get a bite with the crackers on top it's SO good... I had leftover chicken breasts, so used a cup of chicken broth, also omitted celery and celery salt as I didn't have any, still good, also added a little more rice. Creamy and comforting on a cold night.

This is good.  I hate to make a recipe without trying it as is first, but I did feel it needed some veggies added and some other things changed.  I didn't make broth, used a rotisserie chicken and 2 cups of brown rice.  I sauteed carrots, celery, onions and mushrooms and added them for texture and flavor.   I added a little more sour cream, a half cup of water and a jar of chicken gravy I had on hand because I didn't have the soup. Instead of crackers I used panko and a little less butter.   It turned out well.  The brown rice is the key because it will hold up better.  I still had some nice texture on the rice after baking 35 minutes.  It's a great way to sneak in brown rice to your family.  You'll never be able to tell with all the creamy sauce on top.  I'll try it again with cheese next time.  This is a great starter recipe and does well with add ins.  The basic recipe is the same so I'll still give it 5 stars.

First off let me say this is a great base casserole.  That being said I gave it 4 stars as for our tastes I needed to do quite a bit of tweaking to it.  First, I chopped 1/2 cup of onion and celery and cooked those in 2 Tbsp. butter until tender.  I added these to the soup mixture.  I interpreted  the recipe to actually call for 1 cup uncooked rice, meaning I actually used 2 cups of cooked rice.  I omitted the onion powder and added about 1 tsp. poultry seasoning which really helped the taste a lot.

This was great, I love recipes that end up in one pot!  It was quite hearty and a good meal for a cool evening.  I did change a few things according to my tastes: 
Omitted: Celery, butter for the cracker top (used crackers only)
Swapped: Water for organic low sodium chicken broth to cover the chicken while cooking, 1 cup of rice for 3 cups brown rice, regular sour cream for light
Added: Frozen broccoli florets (cut the cook time in half since it would be baked after so they wouldn't get mushy), 1 cup of shredded cheddar plus a bit to sprinkle o top, added a bit of parmesan cheese, more spices

I love this, but I'm sorry to say that I have never made it exactly as written. I always use one can cream of mushroom, and one of chicken. I never make chicken specially for this. I always use leftover chicken. I really think the extra spices in roast chicken help prevent this casserole from being bland. You just can't beat if for being economical and using up ingredients on hand.

Very good casserole, I will make this again.  
I did modify this recipie a bit... 2 things.  First I made extra rice, about 2-3 cups total, mixed 1 cup in the mixture as per the recipie, then spread the remaining in the bottom of the casserole dish.   Then I made a package of "steam fresh" frozen veggies in the microwave and spread those on top of the rice.  Then layered the chicken mixture over that and topped w/ the cracker topping.

This is really similar to my mother-in-laws recipe except it has rice.  It could actually use more rice.  I didn't add very much salt and it could have used more.  I didn't have celery salt.  That probably would have made a big difference.  My husband loved it.

I did like this casserole, I gave it a 4 b/c I had to make some changes and felt I couldn't give it a 5 since I didn't make it exactly how it was written. This is what I did: I only had one can of cream of chicken soup on hand so I used a can of cream of mushroom also. I did add mixed vegetables as others said to do. I also used a bread crumb topping. With those changes, it was very good and I had a friend to drop by as we were sitting down to eat and they loved it!!! I will make this again and may keep it as I did this time or try it exactly as written. Enjoybale dish!!!!

Loved this recipe.  Added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and increased the rice to 1 1/2 cups.  Almost like a chicken pot pie casserole.  My one year old and three year old both ate it so I call that a win!

I've been making this casserole for a few years, and it's definitely aptly-named. I use brown rice and whole wheat crackers, and always mix in some green peas.

This was a good comfort food recipe.I reduced the water and used chicken broth instead. I also added another cup of rice and some salt-free garlic and herb seasoning for a little more flavor.Next time will probably add sliced water chesnuts for a little more texture.

This is a great, simple meal with a nice flavor. I liked the suggestion of adding cheddar cheese ~ I sprinkled a layer on top and then added crushed crackers on top of the cheese. Will be making this regularly. I also like it bc the ingredients are all things commonly found in my kitchen :) YUM from all 5 in my fam! (even my husband who doesn't like rice)

I made this recipe per the directions except instead of cooking chicken breasts, I used a purchased roasted chicken.  Therefore, since I didn't have chicken stock from the chicken breasts, I used canned chicken stock.  I did half the cracker topping and it still covered the casserole.  My grandchildren and I each had two servings.  My teenage grandaughter thought it was a little too creamy for her liking, but I thought it was perfect.  Will definitely make this again.  Oh, after reading reviews, I used 1 1/2 cups of rice.

This recipe was great! I skipped the celery salt though because I didn't have any. I used a whole 3lb chicken and a whole container of sour cream instead of 6oz to the mix. This made alot so I made 2 casseroles and had again the next night kids loved it =). The only thing I would change is the 1/2 cup of butter next time  I will use 1/4 cup when mixing with crackers because it was a little rich. Thanks for a good recipe.

This was good and I will make it again.  
I tweaked it a bit because of lack of ingredients and because of other reviews.  I didn't have celery so it wasn't made with the broth.  I used four chicken breasts instead of bone-in.  I doubled the amount of rice and slightly decreased the amount of sour cream.  I didn't have the crackers it called for so I mixed about 1 1/2c bread crumbs with the butter, which was good but I'm gonna bet that the crackers would've been better.  This meal was very creamy and I think I'll always make it doubling the rice.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  Thanks!

Delicious!! My whole family loved it (including our 3 year old) Made a couple of changes: used leftover chicken so I used store bought broth (I only had beef broth so that is what I used), used garlic salt and omitted the extra salt, and omitted the butter and shredded some jack cheese over the top of the crackers.  Great recipe will definitely make again!

I left out the celery salt and celery and added 1 tsp paprika and added about 1/2 bag of frozen peas.  Also I didn't do the crunchy topping but sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  It was so creamy and delicious!  I am going to make it tonight the same way but with the cracker topping.  This recipe is a favorite for sure.

My family really liked this!  I used fresh onion instead of onion powder and fresh parsley.  I added both to the rice while cooking.  Next time I'd use 2 1/2 cups of butter cracker crumbs and increase the butter by 1-2 Tbsp. because I really liked the crunchy topping.

Great, low maintenance weeknight meal.  Often I try to wow the men in my family with something unique....but, they really prefer meals like this.  Simple and good.  Paired with salad, green beans, and carrots. Perfect!

This is a good casserole, but not great...but I changed a few things. I switched a can of cream of chicken for cream of broc., added a bag of broc. and used 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice...which I think is more than called for. It needs more punch or something...maybe cheese, but I was trying not to make it too unhealthy! Also, mine was a tad dry b/c of the extra rice. I'll just add more broth next time b/c I did like the extra rice. Family loved it and I will make again.

I modified it a little. I added a bag of cooked mixed vegetables to the soup/broth/sour cream/rice/chicken mixture. I also added an extra cup of rice and a little shredded cheddar cheese. Great on a cold night.

I tried this last night and everybody loved it!I made it slightly different, instead of celery or brocoli i put 1/2 package of thinly sliced of french mushrooms. I added 1/3 can of evaporated milk, butter sauteed thinly sliced onion, 1/4 cup macaroni, paprica powder and 2 cups of cream of mushrooms. I omit celery, sour cream and used only 2 boneless chicken breast. Instead of salty crackers for the topping, I opted for BBQ flavoured chips and covered the whole pan for crunchy texture.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have any cream of chicken soup.  I omitted the celery and and celery salt and I used rotini pasta instead of rice.  Like other reviews suggested I added cheddar cheese to the mixture.  This was a really easy and delicious dish.

Very tasty. Changes: Used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts poached for 20 minutes - perfectly cooked. Used 2 cups rice and 1.5 cans cream of chicken - could have probably just used one can. Also sauteed half a minced onion in 1 Tbsp butter which I added to soup mixture.  Used crushed garlic butter crutons for topping. And all fit well in 8X8 pan - 9x13 would have been 2 large.

This was wonderful, once I made some adjustments as well.  I doubled the rice (cooked in chicken broth) and did not use chicken on the bone.  Maybe some day I will, but too easy with just cooking chicken breasts.  Will make this one again.

This is the first casserole that my 9 and 11 year old girls enjoyed, added some garlic we're junkies.  A little salty though, dry mouth through the night, next time will try with noodles and adding mozzarella cheese with some Parmesan noodles.  Thanks

I loved this casserole.  A big hit with the kids.  Used two cups of rice and skipped the crackers and butter.  Added celery, green pepper and onion for some crunch.  Yum.

This was very good.   Only thing I did differently was add more rice as suggested in previous reviews.  We had leftovers for lunch today and they were very tasty.   This one is a keeper and I like that you can prepare it ahead of time, with the exception of cracker topping.  Excellent for a busy day meal that still taste like you slaved over it for hours

I skipped the celery and just used celery salt because I don't love cooked celery. I also used a ckn bouillon cube instead of the suggested broth for more flavor. I thought it was easier to just melt the butter and pour on top then to mix in the bag. I added frzn broccolli for my veggie and I thought it came out great. Leftover were pasty so plan on eating the 1st night.

Outstanding!  My husband is a picky eater, and he loved it!  I had prepared the chicken ahead of time, so I didn't have any chicken broth.  I just used the cream of chicken soup cans and sloshed 1 cup of  water around in them in lieu of the broth. =)

I made this for my boyfriend's family and even his SUPER picky Dad liked it. Made a few changes: I didn't add the butter, added about a half cup shredded cheese (this is for 16 servings), made 2 extra cups of rice, used store bought chicken broth, and I broiled the chicken breast. Everyone raved and had seconds! Will definitely make again and will add veggies next time!

Made according to recipe and it had an ok taste but turned out super-dry. I made 2 and froze one so after I thawed the second one I added a ton of chicken broth to compensate for the dryness but it's not a make-again dish for me.

everyone loved this!  I added some mushrooms to only my dish and I think that is a great way to personalize this for anyone .  I made this a shrimp casserole by using cream of shrimp soup and sherry.  This basic recipe is soo versitile and delicious! Yes I made the chicken version but being the only shrimp lover made a seperate one for me and froze it individually-for me.  Today  my career student son called after his dinner of this to ask for more!!!!!!  He came home to pick it up! I gave him half and he was to give his sister the other half.  They had lunch and he asked her if he could eat hers!!!!!!!!!!! She said no so he  called as I was writing this to complain she is selfish.  I was thrilled and will always make this recipe!  Thankyou! I also used sherry for the shrimp version.  Donnapfi---you started a tradition and I thank you

I've never cooked a casserole in my life. My friend and I chose this one to attempt, ran out and purchased the ingredients, and had a lovely time making this recipe. Tastes great!

This is delicious. I added a few hotter spices to it, because we like things spicy in our home, but overall this is just great. We had some picky eaters over and they gobbled it up!

Good overall meal idea. I thought the seasonings and rice needed to be increased just so it didn't taste like some hohum, canned soup casserole. Really good with a small bag of California Blend veggies added in--my husband who hates veggies was even able to enjoy the meal without picking out the "yuck" as he calls anything green.

My husband, who hates casseroles, loved this and got a second helping. I used store-bought broth and one can of cream of potato soup, since I only had one can of cream of chicken. I omitted the butter and added cheese. Delish!

This is a new favorite!  I have made it twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly except for the celery.  The second time I made it, I used less sour cream and added a little shredded cheddar cheese.  Both times it was delicious.  The kids love it and they even ate the leftovers!

For the life of me, I don't know how this dish got such high reviews.  I made this EXACTLY as written and it was boring and bland.   It wasn't terrible...it was just didn't have much flavor.  With so many other recipes out there, I won't bother making this one again.

I was a little dissapointed in this recipe. It got really good reviews, so I had high hopes. Husband thought it was "too bland." It just seemed like it needed something else. I did double the rice, since a lot of reviewers recommended that. I also added in onion since we are onion lovers. But, it was still lacking flavor. My husband rated it a C+.

I used just one can of cream of chicken soup and added a cup of shredded cheddar and Mexican cheese.  Good comfort food (i.e. full of fat and not very exciting)!  The buttery cracker crust really makes the dish.

Enjoyed by the family tonight!  I used 3 tsp. of minced garlic with 1/2 onion and mushrooms sauteed in chicken broth seasoned with salt and pepper. I had intended not to alter the recipe, but added fresh parm. cheese on top as well. I'm going to add corn and peas next time and spice it up.  Thanks for sharing, we had a wonderful dinner!

As others suggested, I used an additional cup of rice.  I also switched one of the cans of cream of chicken soup and replaced it with a can of cream of broccoli soup.  I made this for a friend recovering from surgery and one for my family.  It was delicious.  I also sliced my celery thin and added it to the mixture.  Thanks.

I can describe this recipe in one word, "delicous".  My kids loved it.  My 14 year old said it was the best casserole he ever tasted.  My 3 year old loved it too.  I will definitely make this one again.

My family enjoyed this very much.  Only problem I had was it seemed a little soupy fresh out of the oven.  Though it seemed to thicken the longer it stood.  So my suggestion would be to let it stand 10-15 minutes before serving. Otherwise great recipe as is. Will make again soon.

We just finished eating this for dinner and we all (including my 1 year old) loved this! I will most definitely be making this again.  The only changes I made were to leave out the celery salt because I didn't have any and to add more rice. I'm definitely glad I added more rice - it would have been too soupy otherwise.

Excellent casserole! I am not a huge fan of chicken, but this recipe truly is 'delicious!' The buttery crackers add a nice flavor to top it off. I added about a cup of shredded cheddar and use two sleeves of crackers (not sure how many cups that equals)...DELICIOUS!!

Good and simple meal for a weeknight dinner. I also added an extra cup of rice, shredded cheddar, and some frozen mixed veggies. I didn't add the butter to the crumbs, probably good, but didn't think it would be worth all the extra calories. Very good, even my casserole-hating boyfriend liked it and cleaned his plate. Thanks!

This casserole got rave reviews from strangers! Asked me for recipe. I used canned chicken broth & 1 can cream of celery in place of one can cream of chicken. I also doubled the rice.

This recipe was just O.K. for me.  I did add another cup of rice per other comments.  I also added basil and oregano for some flavor.  I added frozen corn and cheddar cheese to the top of the dish.  I feel the rice made the dish bland.  I may try with egg noodles next time to see if I can enhance the flavor.

Awesome comfort food recipe! So easy to make, and so practical too, cuz you can use whatever substitutions you have on hand, and it cannot fail you! I Did not measure anyting, added some cooked beef pieces that were leftover in addition to the chicken., added some frozen veggies to the whole thing b4 baking. Also made soup subs and increased the rice, and didnt have enough sour cream, so completed the rest with plain yogourt, and just crushed the crackers on top without butter...it still ALL came out wonderfully delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe. I will try gain and again with variations each time!!

Correctly named ! This was just too easy, quick and good! I have a tough crowd to please and THEY ATE THE WHOLE THING! in one setting. I used 1 whole cup of rice and an extra 3/4 cups broth. Used skinless thighs instead of Breasts and doubled the garlic and onion powder. Didn't have any celery salt so I used a can of Cream of Celery instead of 2 cans of Cream of Chicken. Have already been instructed to make this a weekly event, Thanks.

I made quite a few substitutions, but this is a fantastic base recipe!! I used 2 1/2 cups of rice ( i like more) i used 4 boneless skinless breasts, i added 1 cup chopped red onion rather than onion powder, i used 1 cup grated chedder mixed in the casserole and another cup grated on top, i added 2 cups of broccoli, and rather than the 2 cans cream of chicken soup, i used  one can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can cream of chicken, everyones suggestions made this dish wonderful! My husband and I love it! I will definitely make it again, it is wonderful because you can add whatever veggies you want, its very easy to tweak depending on what you have on hand or what you like!

This was great! We didn't have any celery or celery salt, so I didn't use either.  Also, I cut the ingredients in half as there was only two of us.  I made enough rice for 4 people and added boullion after.  Instead of boiling the chicken, I sprinkled 2 chicken breasts (skinless, boneless)with salt, pepper and lots of garlic powder and onion powder.  I cooked them in the oven in an inch or two of chicken broth.  In the sauce I added a dash of cayenne pepper and a little bit more spices than the recipe called for.  I also added regular chicken broth instead of the broth that was from the chicken.  I layered the casserole dish instead of mixing it all together and added a light layer of shredded cheese under the crackers.  I used lots of crushed up crackers as well. I will definitely make this again and we have lots left over for lunch tommorrow!

This was pretty good.  I did 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken, omitted celery and celery salt.  I added half a bag of frozen broccoli florets...I think you definitely need some sort of veggie in there.  I used the 4 breasts and added 1 more cup of cooked rice.  Could have done with another cup, I think.  It was creamy but not thick, and more rice would help thicken it up a little.  Easy ingredients that I have on hand so I'd probably make it again.

I cooked this one day for myself and my boyfriend and it was fantastic! Instead of bone-in chicken breasts I used boneless, and I didn't use celery salt because we had none, but it still turned out great. Will cook again.

I loved this recipe!  I did do some changes. I used 2 cups brown rice. boiled the chicken in water and used already made chicken broth. 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of broccoli and cheese soup. I added about 2 cups frozen broccoli that i steamed. I also added shredded carrot and shredded cheese. I used rits roasted vegetable (because i already had it) with out the butter, and i upped the temp. to 375 ( because i like my stuff crispy) it turned out great!

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I added more rice to it, like I've read others did and I added a bit more chicken soup and broth as well. Turned out great and the family liked it.

I have had morning sickness so i wanted something sort of "bland". This is a great beginner recipe, you can pretty much eyeball it and add whatever you want. Made for good comfort food, I used brown rice, onion and mushrooms with cream of celery. Added fresh Parmesan to the top. Husband seemed to like it, and I was surprised that my 3 year old ate it because she usually wont touch a casserole!

4 stars because of the changes I had to make based on other reviews: use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, saute 2 chopped chicken breasts (4 is too much) with chopped onion & celery in butter, use pre-made chicken broth, and put cheddar cheese on top with crackers (no butter). Yummy!

I used a rotisserie chicken minus skin and bones and cut-up, ready-made broth, and 3 cups of cooked rice based on the other reviews. Added a pinch of sage and shredded cheddar cheese and it was a hit. Both hubby and son asked for 2nd servings.

good casserole, next time I will use healthier ingredients.  I added some cheese shredded as another reviewer did with nice results.  I thought 1 cup of cooked rice seemed way too little for thesize of dish this should make so I cooked 1 cup of rice instead. I have a feeling this is what the recipe author intended.

I skipped the stock step..too much work, and instead added the celery to the casserole for texture. I cubed the chicken and browned it with an onion and 3 cloves garlic with the rest of the seasnonings. I doubled the rice and omitted the butter in the cracker crumbs, didn't need it. Still, not great. Won't be making it again unless I make even more changes. Bland.

I was a little skeptical, but pleasantly surprised with the flavor on this.  I agree with other reviewers, this has too much liquid.  Next time I will add less.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth to speed up the process of making my own stock.  It cut the total time down by about 15-20 minutes, which was a big help for me.  Next time I'll also add more topping, this was definitely the biggest hit!

I made few tweaks to save time/calories, and overall it was a tasty and filling dish. I skipped boiling the chicken and just browned it in a skillet. I also doubled the rice, omitted the butter from the cracker mixture, and used Garden Vegetable Ritz. Yum!

This was great!  I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken and added chopped celery to the mixture for a little crunch.  I also used chopped fresh onion, but it would have been ok with dried.  Also, as other readers have mentioned, more rice is needed.  Perhaps the rice in the ingredient list should say uncooked instead of cooked thereby doubling the rice?  My husband who doesn't like his foods to touch, asked for seconds.  That's worth a five start rating all by itself.

Very good!  I increased the amount of chicken and rice and used about 2/3 cup of chopped onion instead of onion powder.  It was perfect!  The kids loved it and my husband said it was the best casserole he's ever had.

I love this recipe!  The family ate it all up in two fell swoops!  Instead of Ritz Crackers, I used Waverly Wafers (called Club Crackers here in San Diego area), and their taste is superb!  Really recommend this for a quick and easy dinner that fills up tummies quickly!

Added rice and increased garlic and onion powder, as per other reviews. Still rather bland. I thought I'd try something new, but will go back to my old recipe.

Very bland unless you increase the onion and garlic powder by quite a lot.

Absolutely delicious.  I've made this casserole several times already and it never disappoints. I will be making it again. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and tweeked it a bit  the other times. Anyway you make it it turns out wonderful. This is a good casserole to make for other people. I made it for my daughter's family when she was under the weather and they all loved it. It's a favorite in our house.

Moist and delicious!  I did however make a small change I got from another persons review.  I added defrosted frozen broccoli (chopped) and some shredded cheddar cheese.

My son can't get enough of this. He doesn't like celery so with the exception of the first time i made it, I leave it out. With or without celery, I have to agree with my son. It's very good

I added ground caraway, ground coriander and thyme. My husband says it is his favorite thing in the current rotation, and among his favorites of anything I've ever made. My son had 3 helpings. It was good.

I have made this casserole several times, and it's always a huge hit. I make it easier on myself and use boneless chicken breasts and 1 cup of canned chicken broth.  I add a cup or two of cooked chopped broccoli and a cup or two of grated sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture, and I double the amount of rice. All other ingredients remain the same. Thank you for a hearty and yummy recipe!

This is the easiest, best casserole ever!!!  I have looked and looked for a nice economical, easy recipe for chicken casserole for years and I finally found one.  It is simply delicious!!  It serves a family well and also good for serving guests.  Instead of using two cans of cream of chic soup, I used one chic and one celery and I also used real onions instead of onion powder.  My family loved it!!

Absolutely wonderful!  I did make a couple  of small changes -  I used 1.5 cans Cream of Chicken soup, and instead of melting  the butter I put small cubes of butter on top of casserole.  Delicious!

Delicious casserole, though I did add more than 1 cup of rice. Seemed to be a bit on the runny side for me being a casserole. I actually used 4 cups of cooked rice and added 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese to the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish. Awesome flavor and I would definitely make this again!!!

The only changes I made was I added 1/2 cup more rice and I felt it needed more. I personally didn't care for it I would have rated a 2 star for myself, but my boyfriend seemed to like it ok.  I thought it was way too runny and not much flavor.  IF I make it again I think I'll skip the whole step with the broth and just use already made leftover chicken breast, add some cheese to the topping and maybe add some vegetable such as broccoli and either skip the broth or one can of soup so it's not so runny and use more than one cup of rice.  Recipe as is.... just 2-3 stars.

I followed this recipe exactly but added 3 c rice per the original submitter's comment. I thought it was bland but was a good base. Next time I'll add cheese or will use one can of cheese soup. I'll also add some Better than Boullion to deepen the chicken flavor and will add herbs like thyme, more onion, some garlic, etc. I used one sleeve of crackers and will use more next time. I also cooked for about 10 min longer, at 400 for the extra 10, to darken the crackers/top of the casserole.

I'm not sure how this recipe rated a 4 1/2 stars, unless everyone who rated it was out camping and would eat anything.  I made this dish following the recipe exactly as I always do the first time before making changes to suit my family's taste, but this time I'm not going to bother, it's just not that good. 
Forgive me I cannot lie when it comes to food, food budgets  are being stretched to the limit these days without spending money on tasteless meals and serving your family glop.

This casserole was just ok for me. I liked all the ingredients except the celery and celery salt. However, I did like the rice. I added slivered almonds to the top after plating.

I made this for my first time ever making a casserole, and with my changes I say it's 5 stars, without changes it's 3-4 stars. I seasoned 4 chicken fillets and a few drumsticks with salt, pepper, garlic and herb seasoning and cooked them in chicken stock with celery and onion. I used the broth that it cooked in and added it with one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom. I also added cayenne and paprika to the seasonings and added a frozen bag of southwestern corn. I melted butter with italian breadcrumbs and drizzled it on top over shredded cheddar cheese, then realized after I had put it all together I had forgot the rice, so I put some in, added more cheese and breadcrumbs. After cooking for 40 minutes it looked a bit soupy so I added more rice, breadcrumbs and cheese. At the end it actually was a bit on the dry side- I had added too much rice, but it was SOO GOOD. Definitely a good base to work on for a casserole!

Although we liked it, it needed a little more zip.  Next time I will try adding onions to enhance the flavor.  I did add a little chopped broccoli  for the nutritional benefit and would do so again.

This was very good with one real change: mushrooms instead of celery.  
I cooked 3 (filleted horizontally) boneless chicken breasts in a skillet with salt/pepper/garlic powder.  When the 6 fillet-halves were done, I cubed/cut them.
I mixed everything the recipe calls for (sans celery) into a bowl, including the chicken drippings from the skillet, then chopped up a package of fresh mushrooms, and fried them in the same skillet with some butter-flavored cooking spray.
I dumped the chicken mixture into the 9x13 glass dish, spread the mushrooms on top, and then spread the butter/cracker mix on top of that.  Everything was warm & already cooked, so I only had to heat for about 17 min to crisp the crackers.
Turned out great!
Thanks for the recipe!!  I'll def make this again!

Outstanding casserole, I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  Be aware the recipe as stated has a typo and you will need to adjust your cooked rice to at least 2 cups or a little more depending on your tastes or your casserole will be to soupy.  The changes I made were I used chicken legs instead of thighs (we like dark meat).  I omitted the celery and onion powder and used the real thing.  I added my sliced celery (used one or two extra stalks to make up for not using the powder) and boiled the celery with my meat.  Meanwhile I saute'ed my diced onion over med. heat in a little olive oil until tender and clear.  Once the meat and celery were tender but not falling off the bone, I strained the broth off and separated and cut the chicken into bite size pieces saving the cooked celery as I went.  I just seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste and added a little bit of sage and thyme also to taste.  I added a bit more sour cream to my casserole because I think mine was a little bigger then recipe stated.  Once mixture was in the casserole dish I covered the top with shredded cheddar cheese, didn't measure but used about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of it.  My cheese was about 1/4 inch deep.  The crushed crackers mixed with melted butter are what put this casserole over the top so don't skip or scrimp on this one step.  The butter really livens the flavor of this dish.  I used real butter not that fake stuff.  I know it's not a very healthy dish but it won't hurt to make it once in a wh

This was absolutely delicious!  The changes I made to the recipe were as follows:  used rotisserie chicken from Costco, used one can of cream of celery soup instead of two cream of mushroom soups, added fresh chopped mushrooms sauteed in butter and white wine and added a small can of chopped chestnuts.  My family raved over this recipe!

The dish was yummy. I cooked 3 large skinless chicken breasts. I mixed 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery, 6 oz sour cream, garlic powder, 1 small sauted onion, salt and pepper. I added 2 cups of frozen broccoli florets and went with 2 cups of cooked rice. For the topping I added 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and  I used melted butter mixed with 2 cups of bread crumbs.

I made this recipe yesterday. I incorporated many of the suggestions in the reviews. I used 3 large boneless skinless ckn breasts, 3 stalks of celery, added no salt1/4 t black pepper, 6 oz. of fat free sour cream. 1 can 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, 1 can of 98% fat free cream of celery soup, 1/2 t celerysalt, 1 t minced onion, 1/2 t garlic powder,   I also added 1 t herbs de Provence, and  decreased butter to 1/4 C butter. The  casserole tasted pretty good last nite. Tonight it was so much better. I highly recommend this recipe.

Super yummy!This recipe is a new family favorite!Brought this without testing it first to a friend who just had a baby & it got rave reviews from them.The next night I made it for my own family and we all loved it, including my ridiculously picky 12 yr. old. I did not add the celery when simmering the chicken as I didn't have any on hand. It didn't make a difference! I also skipped the celery salt since I didn't have that, either. It doesn't need it anyways...there's enough salt in everything else. I also added about 1 1/2 - 2 c. of shredded cheddar cheese to the soup & sour cream mixture and two things FOR SURE, you'll need to increase the rice (I used about 3 1/2 cups of cooked jasmine)and DON"T SKIP the buttery cracker topping, it's heavenly. Don't substitute with saltines, either...they would be too bland. For my friends I added some frozen peas that I partially cooked before adding to the dish. Would be great also w/broccoli or peas & carrots or even corn, each of which I'll try in the future. Such an awesome base recipe! Thanks for sharing it! :-)  Enjoy this one, folks!

This is my favorite casserole to bake.I make my own adjustments to fit my taste like to double what the recipe asks for on the rice and crackers. The cracker topping is my favorite part! I also use boneless chicken breasts, but boiling them and using the broth does make a difference. Hands down the best and easiest casserole to make!

Good recipe family love it. I added parmesan cheese to the top and used low fat cream of chicken soup. I also used nonfat yogurt in lieu of sour cream. Used boneless skinless breasts cooked in water with carrots celery and some red pepper flake. Made a great stock. I added crushed crackers drizzled with a bit of olive oil in lieu of butter.

I agree with other reviewers. This is a bit runny. It is however a good base recipe. There are so many things you can do with it. Next time I will definitely modify it. I will also add veggies for a one dish meal.

I tried this recipe as written and thought it was just "ok". I think it's a great base, but was lacking..something? I did, however, enjoy the homemade broth. Yum.

Great & versatile recipe. I made some changes to make it easier & cheaper for us: used leftover rotisserie chicken, doubled the rice (I used instant, uncooked rice and just added extra broth), omitted the celery salt, added some chopped, cooked celery, and only used 1/4 cup butter. Everyone raved. Will be making this again!

I really like saucy casseroles, so this was definitely for me.  I was happy with the amount of liquid, and I like this chicken-to-rice ratio too. I really think this is a personal taste. 
My personal touches: I sauteed raw celery, onion and garlic and did not use powder or flakes. I made my own cream-of variants by starting with a simple bechamel, and I also added 1/3 cup of white wine to the sauce. 
If i could recommend anything, it would be that white wine. It really adds a lot to this creamy sauce. If you do that, I do not recommend adding cheese.

This turned out delicious!  My kids had at least two helpings each!  I made a few small changes.  I was out of celery so I used celery salt and celery seed when boiling the chicken.  I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it.  I used two cups of rice instead of one.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I added about 6 ounces of frozen broccoli and about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese when mixing the rice, soup, broth... etc.  I added a sprinkling of seasoning salt on top of the mixture just before baking.  Lastly, I omitted the cracker crust.  Ok, that was more than a few, but it was definitely a crowd pleaser and a new family favorite.

Flavourful, easy and budget friendly.  We used 2 cups uncooked multi-grain rice, 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, omitted the butter, and replaced buttery crackers with vegetable thins, added a sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese to finish it off.  Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My family liked this a lot.  I cut four boneless skinless chicken breasts into small pieces and boiled them in chicken broth.  I added in half a bag of frozen mixed veggies when I was boiling the chicken.  This is a quick meal that I'll definitely make again.

So yummy.  I would classify this dish under the 'comfort food' category.  I used crushed corn flakes instead of crackers, the crunch adds texture and flavour.  I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of broccoli.  I added freshly grated cheddar cheese and fresh broccoli but forgot to pre-cook the broccoli and the cooking time in the oven was not enough to make it tender.  I will be sure to make this again!

Loved this recipe. Made a few changes because I needed it to be gluten free, and wanted to use what I had on hand ..2 cups of brown rice, 1 box of GF cr of Celery soup and 1 box of GF Cr of Ch soup, added extra sour cream ( actually, my son did that!), and then topped with Cornflakes instead of the crackers. My kids absolutely LOVED it, and they are picky eaters!  This is definitely a comfort food casserole that is going to be a winter staple around here!

This was really good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I made a few minor changes. I used 2 cups of COOKED rice (1 cup uncooked) and also mixed a cup of shredded cheddar in the cream soup mixture. The cracker topping was really good, especially when sprinkled with more cheese! Definitely a keeper.

This was very good.  The only change I made was to chop up the celery the chicken was boiled with and add it to the cassarole.  My kids had three helping each!!  Will definately make again!

we liked it but it took a while to make- i will use this when I need to cook in the am and stick it in the oven in the pm. I doubled the recipe and used 5 chicken breasts w/ some chicken boullion cubes, almost a 24 oz. bag of semi-thawed broccoli, water chestnuts and 1/2 mushroom soup and 1/2 cream of broccoli.  I didn't do the butter drizzle and it was fine.  Next time I would use a bit more broth or sour cream - it was a little dry.  It made so much though it was wasteful.  It made one large (11x14 casserole), one normal 9x13 and one smaller one.  we had half left over for the large one that I kept.  I was making it for me and my sister's family but ended up giving some to my friend's family and really I could have made 5 casseroles out of this.  the original recipe would be plenty for my family (a 9x13) and for another set of adults. (a smaller casserole dish).  kids hated every bite- go figure!

I used 2 cups of rice instead of 1 and instead of cream of chicken soup and celery I used cream of mushroom soup and 2 small cans of mushroom stems and pieces. Which makes it absolutely phenomenal if you're a mushroom lover as my family is. Also I sprinkled poppy seeds in with my butter and cracker mix. Very very yummy!

The taste was quite yummy, but I'm giving this 4 starts because it was quite runny/soupy. It probably needed another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of rice in it. Very easy to make. I will also double the crackers on top and then pour the butter over next time.

The basic recipe is good, but i added a few things based on other reviews. I used a rotisserie chicken, cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup.  used about half the chicken broth.  Added about 1/3 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and some canned carrots.  I would also recommend extra crackers on top.  My family loved the recipe.

Was surprisingly good! I didn't read all the reviews before I made it, but I should have. It can use another cup of rice to make it a little bit thicker.

OMG!!! I LOVE this dish! I made it exactly the way it was instructed the first time and thought it was great. The 2nd time I decided to save time so I used a rotisserie chicken already cooked from the grocery store and used store bought chicken broth. I added onion and frozen peas and it was fabulous! It is now on my list of favorite comfort food.

Further varied Rwn Mayfair's excellent adaptation of this recipe. Agreed 2 c. rice essential (used a brown rice gourmet medley as grains hold together well in cooking sauce). Husband chipped in, buying cream of mushroom soup to mix with cream of celery, as sufficient chicken flavor with the breasts and the broth. Omitted seasoning powders using fresh chopped onion and herbs to the water for cooking the chicken and fresh minced garlic into the soup/sour cream sauce. Used Rwn Mayfair's cracker/cheese combination. Omitted the broccoli as serve sauteed spinach on side. No leftovers - even finicky 86 yr old mother-in-law lapped up the casserole on her plate!

Could have used double the topping as the buttery cracker topping added so much more to the flavor.  Even my picky kids ate it up!

This was a great starter recipe.  I prefer more veggies...so I think I will add carrots next time. I also used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of celery.  I added extra spices to the mix. My husband found this recipe delicious.  He went back for seconds!  :)  Thanks for the recipe.

Good base recipe but I made a few changes.  I did not make my own chicken broth.  Used 1 can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery.  Increased the garlic powder.  Add a package of frozen broccoli florets and a chopped onion.  Also topped with hot and spicy crushed cheez-its instead of Ritz and butter.

I loved it! I did make a few changes just for personal reasons. I did not havce time to boil the chicken and make the stock so I used better than bullion for the stock and I sauted up the celery and some onion and addedd to the soup mix. I also added a small amount of poultry seasoning. Will make again!!

I love this recipe. Something you can make a few days ahead of time when you know you have a busy week, and then just pop it in the oven!  My husband likes it when I kick it up with ceyenne.

I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't taste good at all to me or my family.  My only substitution was 1 can of c. of celery in place of one of the C. of chickens.  Perhaps I needed to add broccoli and broccoli soups as some others have done.  Sorry!  I can see that many people like it and I'm not too picky but have to say won't be making it again! :(

I really like this recipes because its simple. i didnt use the celery salt, jus celery seed cuz it was cheaper at the store. and I used precooked chicken. I cooked the rice in a mix of cream of chicken water and all the seasonings. I layered it: (plain) crackers, rice, chicken, crackers, then cheese. baked it for an hour!! DIE-LISH! oh yea and i did use some canned chicken broth to cook the rice in too

Loved this. Made the stock and it was great - have plenty to freeze for later too. I did add some cheese on top (just b/c we are huge cheese fans) and some brocolli and chopped onion. Used a can of cream of chicken and of cream of mushroom b/c that's what I had.  Everyone loved it! Had enough to fill a round, 4 quart casserole dish. My toddler ate two of his bowls full and then tried to get into my bowl! This is a great recipe; thanks for sharing.

I made a few modifications to this recipe, which turned out wonderfully.  I added some frozen corn, chopped celery, and doubled the rice.  My family loved it and asked me to try some different vegetables next time.  Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser!

I don't usually will give a recipe all 5 stars. But when my husband and the four kids sit down and EVERYONE cleans their plate;and still wanting MORE.Then no one feels better than I.

It was a bit heavy, salty and dry, even after adding broth. I don't think casseroles are my thing.

I was looking for something using ingredients I had on hand. I didn't really read the recipe though and didn't do step 2. I had already cooked the chicken, so instead I used chicken broth in place of the cooking liquid. It tasted fine and cut down the time.

I'm sorry but I did not like this at all. It had a weird taste and texture with the cracker crumbs. It reminded me of tuna helper. Yuck! I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just did not work. There are much better chicken casserole recipes out there so save your time and money and avoid this one.

5 STARS! I've  made this recipe three times,  once for a family in mouning, once for a family celebrating a birth, and once for a neighborhood picnic.  I have NEVER been asked for a recipe so many times!  I made it exactly according to Donna's directions each time, and the plates were licked clean.  More than that, it's EASY!!!  Many thanks, Donna....and All Recipes!

I have made this several times and have found many ways to adjust this recipe. I have used canned chicken in a pinch. I always add peas and never add the broth. It's been a hit every time!

I have always hated cooking and my family was sick of the same 3 dinners (that's all I new how to cook) My husband is picky and we have different tastes...  My Husband and my boys loved it... I followed the instruction, but left out the celery as family doesn't like it... but still came out great!!  Thanks!

Loved this, so simple but tastes great. I used dried minced onion instead of onion powder. I also used dark and light meat.

I made this recipe as stated except for a few alterations to the spices.  I added thyme and used garlic pepper instead of garlic powder.  This was very good but still needed a little something.  I think next time I make it, I may add some rosemary and saute the chicken instead of boiling it to give it some extra flavor.  I did not find this to be too salty.  My thought is that using low sodium ritz crackers may cut down on the salt some.  When I ate leftovers of this, I poured some salsa over the top before reheating - very yummy!!  We will definitely have this again!

Made this when the in-laws came for a visit and it went over great.  Was a little dry but only because it was cooked longer than suggested.  All in all a great recipe!  I added broccoli to the mix and those dried onions on top with the crackers minus the butter.  Yummy!

This was a great meal.  I made minor changes with spices to adapt to my family...also added a little corn to make it a little heartier.  Kids didn't like the cracker topping, but I did!!  Thanks for recipe.

The only changes I made were to add chopped celery and carrot and about 1/4 bag of mixed veggies. It was filling, but kind of bland.. maybe because I used low sodium soups and light sour cream? It needed a little more flavor- maybe adding some chopped rosemary (or another herb) before baking.

I am trying several new recipes out. This chicken casserole is awesome. My wife and I usually never eat leftovers although, this time was diffrent. I made a small change: Added 2/3 cup finely chopped celery and 1 small onion chopped, also chopped finely.

I have made this recipe 4 times already and everytime I put my own spin on it. The largest problem I had with this recipe was the chicken having no flavor. I finally pan fried the chicken, shredded it and used it that way. I also added 1/2 a cup of onions and 1/2 cup of mushrooms added with butter to the pan the chicken was fried in, after draining the oil, keeping the drippings. To get the cup of broth I mixed in water with the onion and mushroom mix, then added that liquid to the rice to flavor it. The taste is perfect and definitely a winner. I recommend using this recipe as a base and working your own flavors into it.

My family loved it.  It is very versatile. I read thru lots of reviews and added more rice, garlic, shredded cheese, onions and mixed veggies as many suggested.  My husband loved it and gave it the two thumbs up.  It is the first casserole I ever made and I was so pleased it went over so well.  Beautiful.

Excellent recipe - however, I agree to add extra rice (1 cup)- also, if you add a can or 2 of sliced chestnuts- it will make this dish even better.

Wonderful! I also added an extra cup of rice and stirred in 1 cup of shredded cheddar. It's very versatile; easy to add extra seasonings and veggies to suit your family's taste. My only complaint is that I thought i'd have extra for lunch the next day, but my family ate the whole thing! This is now one of my regular dinners.

i've cooked this three times at least and altered it each time using cream of celery and mushroom. i used real onion and garlic instead of powder because my family is sensitive to artificial ingredients.

This was just not for us.  We found it to be very bland.  However, it was easy to prepare.  Also, I agree with other reviewers that it needs more rice.  Otherwise there is more sauce than chicken and rice.  I love extra sauce but this was too much!

Really good!  I cook a whole chicken, adding an onion along with the celery.  Reserving 3 cups of broth, I use 2 cups of it to cook 1 cup of rice and add the remaining cup to the casserole.  (This makes the rice really rich and delicious.)  I ended up with more chicken and rice than the recipe calls for, but, as others reviewers added, I  felt that it was better with more.  I also left out the celery salt and used saltine crackers instead of butter crackers.  Just a few tweaks and this was a delicious dish!

Pretty good. Mostly enjoyed by kids & wife, but some changes might make an improvement. Next time, will try substituting a can of cream of mushroom soup, in place of the second can of cream of chicken. Also, will need to ensure I add enough chicken (fell short when made the 1st time). Took longer than expected.

Was WOnderful.  It fed My family of 11 well with some leftovers.  I added 1 can of veg-all to get  in some veggies.  I used precooked chicken from Christmas and I made a broth from som e chicken bullion cubes and hot water.  I also added the french fried crispy onions for a extra crunch.  It recieved great reviews from my household.  And It was really easy to rollow the recipe. U got 2 thumbs up here!  I will most defentally use this recipe again!!!

This was easy and good comfort food. My family really enjoyed it. Next time, I will add more veggies-- onion, mushrooms, peas, and carrots. I think that would make it more substantial. Good base recipe!

Really liked this recipe. I used 3 cups of rice though and used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. Will try it with cheese and broccoli next time. Definately a keeper!

I basically stuck to this recipe, but used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of broccoli soup. I also chopped up the cooked celery and added that to the casserole and I cooked some frozen broccoli florets and added that to the casserole as well. I sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top and topped it with the cracker/butter mixture. I think next time I will skip the melted butter and use crushed crackers only.

Excellent meal. A little time consuming, but well worth it. I changed a couple things. I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery. I added a can of cut green beans in the mixture. I increased the rice to 2 cups and added about 3 tablespoons of butter and about 1/4 tsp of salt to the rice as well. I forgot to add a cup of the broth from the chicken breasts but it still turned out delish. I also used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I didn't add the celery salt as I used cream of celery soup. I crunched up 1 1/2 stacks of Ritz crackers and mixed them with the butter (which I highly recommend) and it turned out GREAT! Thanks to the publisher of this recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Yum! I skipped the sour cream b/c I was out. I added a little milk instead. I used 1 can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. I also added some paprika and a dash of cayenne pepper for some extra flavor. Very good basic recipe that you can customize to the ingredients you have on hand.

This was a very good recipe.  I was looking for a good chicken and rice dish and this one caught my eye.  I added 3 cups of rice and next time I'll add a lot more chicken.  I also put some broccoli in it and some shredded cheddar on top and my son and I loved it.  I'll definately make this one again, but I'll keep trying other chicken and rice dishes on my search for the holy grail of this sort of casserole.

This recipe turned out great! I didn't have some of the ingredients and was in a hurry, so I modified it a little: used brown rice, sprinkled cheddar on the top of the crackers (no butter) and browned my chicken in a little evoo instead of making a broth. Yum! Good comfort food!

To make more results, I added about 3 cups cooked brown rice instead of only one cup and a little extra chicken stock.  It was great!

LOVED this!  I changed a few things.  I added chopped up broccoli, skipped the crackers and just put on homemade bread crumbs, added a little mozzarella cheese under the bread crumbs and used diced cooked chicken that I pulled from the freezer.  It was a good recipe to build on though.  My two year old and 7 month old both gobbled it up!

I think it's better with a pasta instead of rice, like rigatoni, just pour the whole pound of pasta in there.

I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c I made some simple changes to the recipe. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup along with one can of cream of chicken. I added diced onions and shredded Cheddar before baking. I also used boneless chicken breasts, so I could cook it faster. Absolutely delicious!!

This is a very good chicken casserole. My husband who hates casserole's even enjoyed it. I did like other's and made 1 cup uncooked rice. I personally did not care for the cracker crumb top, nor did my husband. The next time we make this we will do without that.

I have made this many times, as written and with major modifications. Regardless it is still really good. I have thrown in broccoli, shredded cheddar, chopped cooked green peppers and onions, a little thyme, some celery seed. I've substituted cream of celery soup for chicken. Whatever I have on hand. You can throw in just about whatever type of leftover veggies you have and seems like no matter what I add it comes out good. The one thing I always do is add more rice, usually at least 2 cups, sometimes 3. Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this last night and we both thought it was good but not great.  I listened to the other reviews and added heaps more rice; however, it still came out "missing something."  I added some celery to my portion to give it some extra crunch but I felt like something else needed to be added to complete the dish.

I did not like this recipe; my bf loved it.  I thought the flavors did not blend well.  The soup flavor was overpowering, as well as the buttery taste.  Maybe it's a man's dish?  He couldn't stop eating it!

This is awesome.  I did exchange cream of muchroom for the cream of celery because of family preference it was still amazing.  If you like celery I am sure it is just as amazing with that.  thanks.
