i just finished eating them. they were OK, i saw that some people gave it 1 star reveiws so had to see the truth for myself. They were kinda dry, and stuck to the iron a little. They definetly werent easy to make. i think that aunt jemimah waffles taste better though. I probably wont make them again without modifying the recipe.

Easy to make.  Has a great fluffy texture that cooks up golden brown.

More challenging to make than your traditional waffle, but definitely worth the work.  I also had problems with the waffles sticking to the iron, though.  Any ideas for preventing this?  I brushed the iron with oil between each set of waffles.

Still, I think they're worth the extra work and bother.

Luckily I read the reviews before I made this.  I really think the cornstarch is supposed to be CORNMEAL.  That is what I used.  I also added about a half cup more of flour to thicken up the batter.  Waffles were still kind of bland

This recipe is good, but I hate to say not the best. It is your basic waffle recipe, only a bit more cornstarch than most recipes... but the flavor didn't seem to be affected by it. It is best for the occasion when you're making a special topping for them :)

1/2 cup cornstarch...you're kidding me.  It amazes me how a recipe can have such opposing reviews. There are much easier, tastier waffle recipes on this website.  Unless you love the taste of cornstarch and flour.

I thought they were fantastic.  The first one I pulled off the iron was incredible light and fluffy and just crisp on the outside.  I loved them!

Cornstarch makes the waffles crispier. I have seen it in waffle recipes before. I substituted buttermilk because I had some to get rid of and it came out great.
