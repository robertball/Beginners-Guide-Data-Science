Growing up my Mom made these sandwiches by the dozen and served them in large parties.  We would make them up ahead of time (assembly line fashion).  Wrap them tightly in tin foil and then secure them in plastic bags.  We would put the whole bag in the freezer (for up to two weeks). - Then on the night of the party we would thaw the sandwiches (still in tin foil) and then bake in the foil as directed.  By keeping them in the foil we could serve them in a basket and the sandwiches would stay warm.  Sometimes we would make as much as 20 dozen for large parties.  They are great to bring to picnics!

I read the reviews and couldn't believe that Katie did not like these!  One word describing these sandwiches?  Fabulous!  I use my Black and Decker Handy Chopper to practically puree the onions - they blend in beautifully with the butter sauce this way.  (I think that I, like Katie, might not have liked the sauce if it had onion "chunks" mixed in with the other ingredients.  As a matter of fact, my husband and I don't even keep onions in the house.  We're not onion people!)  As for the rolls, I use King's Hawaiian rolls - regular or multigrain.  These rolls add a touch of sweetness that everyone enjoys, and they go well with the ingredients.  I have made these on several occasions and they have disappeared quickly each time.  Try them!

I actually got this recipe from my mom who received it from a lady at her church and it continues to be passed on from there! These are sooooo goood!! I made these last week and served with 6 can tortilla soup! WOW! However, I had no idea this recipe was also on this site or I would have made these sooner. My version is a TAD different: For 12 hoagie rolls = 1 cup soft butter, 8 TBLS mustard, 6 TBLS finely diced onion, and 1 to 1 1/2 TBLS poppyseeds (no worchestir sauce). Generously spread the butter/mustard mix on the bottom, layer with ham and cheese (we used colby jack & swiss slices) replace top and then spread a small amout on the top of each bun.  Bake and enjoy these! I feel bad for the people who tried these and they didn't turn out because these are delicious and everyone I have served them too agrees! A great meal! Thanks Doreen (and mom my's church friend)!!

These are a favorite around my house and definately a hit when taken to a party too! I get asked fo rht erecipe all the time. I use the mini dinner rolls - the ones that have like 24 in a pack. You can take them out, slice off all the "lids" at one time, add the stuff in the middle and replace the lid. THEN cut with a sharp knife to seperate rolls either before or after baking so they come out easily with the melted cheese. I also just use the aluminum tray that they come in to bake when I'm taking to a party. EASY and DELICIOUS

5 stars for good taste & ease of preparation.         I used cheese slices (vs. shredded) for ease of use, and Hawaiian rolls as recommended by another reviewer.  FYI, I easily made 24 rolls with at least half of the spread (if not more) leftover.  Not sure how buttery other users made their rolls (or perhaps their rolls were larger), but I'll make half the spread in the future.  The first time I made these, a friend helped me assemble the rolls.  She ended up using all the spread for 18 Hawaiian rolls (with the spread way thicker than I would have made it).  Still received compliments on it, but the heavy butter made it a bit soggy on the bottom, so keep that in mind. Would also add less poppy seeds (1/2 as much or just eyeball the mixture to preference) -- it's not that recipe calls for too much, but more that it's for texture than taste, and I'd rather save some poppy seeds if it tastes the same! Made great appetizers for  a bridal shower and birthday party and received compliments at both.

I have to admit, I saw this title and thought who needs a recipe for ham and cheese sandwiches.....apparently, I do!  These were great.  Based on a prior reviewer's rec, I searched in vain trying to find the dinner rolls (apparently a seasonal item around here)that are in the bread section and you bake them.  So, I ended up making then more as sandwich entrees than apps on hoagie type rolls.  Delish-I can't wait to make again w/provolone!  UPDATE:  I just made as "grilled cheese" type sandwiches (quartered the "sauce" recipe for 3 sandwiches) and they were awesome!  I spread the sauce on both pieces of bread and layered on the ham & cheese.  I buttered the outsides and toasted on a griddle.  When they were good and browned, I added lettuce ad tomato.  I also have always used yellow, rather than Dijon, mustard per personal preference.

I can't give these 5 stars cause I made changes. HOWEVER, WE ate ALL 12 sandwiches in 10 minutes!!!!  After reading reviews and getting some great tips here's what I did.  I halved the recipe and used a 12 pack of heat and serve rolls.  I sliced tops off the entire pack in one step while the rolls were connected.  Lined a 9x13 with foil sprayed with pam (less mess).  I had turkey and ham that I made earlier in the week so I made 6 sandwiches with each meat.  I added cheddar cheese with the ham.  For the turkey I used provolone cheese and ranch dressing.  I didn't drizzle the sauce on the top of rolls, but brushed with butter. This is a great snack/appetizer that all ages can really enjoy.  If you have the ingredients on hand, try them!

This is such a great recipe.  I usually serve these at parties along with soup.  I've gotten so many compliments.  The one thing I do differently is: I use shredded swiss and mix a bit of mayo in the cheese to make it stay on the bun. It adds a little tang.  And I do wrap them in foil and bake them,  that way they stay hot. Great stuff!

My husband loved these, he asked me to please make them again for sunday football. I actually premade them, and put them on a cookie sheet in the fridge then baked later in the day when we were ready.

I make this recipe all the time.  We eat them for lunch or dinner, and they are a hit every time.  I use King's Hawaiian Rolls and they stay soft and tasty even warmed up the next day!  One of our favs!!

An oldie but goodie, this is a wonderful recipe to keep handy.  I've been making these little sandwiches for 30 years.  I do use regular yellow mustard instead of Dijon because I'm not a fan of  Dijon.  These sandwiches freeze well if wrapped tightly in foild.  Remove from the freezer.  Allow to come to room temperatur and bake as directed.

These are great and so simple to make. I change some things just for personal preference. I use Honey-Dijon mustard, omit the onion for onion powder, and Kings Sweet Hawaiian Rolls. I usually make 48 at a time, so I cut them before baking them on cookie sheets covered with foil. Then wrap them to keep them warm. Everyone at our church requests these for our Women's Meetings, Dinners, and any other occasions.  I also make some with Roast Beef, Cheddar, on Butter Rolls. Thanks for an amazing recipe that I will use time and time again!

Wow this recipe was great. I made these sandwiches for a super bowl party and they were a huge hit. I used potato rolls and brown sugar ham. After putting down a layer of ham and swiss cheese I added another layer of ham, I also coated the top of the rolls with the leftover butter mixture. The only complaint was I didnt make enough!!!!

You know....these are wonderful! I've made these a few times myself. Few things I do different are that I use sliced deli ham, sliced cheese (I prefer provolone but any cheese will do) and I use the King's Hawaiian bread rolls (really good if you like the sweetness of the bread). I also prefer regular mustard over Dijon but mainly cause it's what's in my fridge!

Awesome! Hubby and teenage son love these and demolish them everytime i make them. I use the Hawaiian mini rolls to make-honey wheat kind. Slice all at once with out seperating so its one big square place all the filling in and bake then i seperate into rolls after baked. Also good reheated in foil. Dont care for the poppy seeds i leave them out.

My mom made these, too, so we've had the recipe in our family for years.  I make them for dinner, and my family gobbles the up (even my picky 7 year-old daughter).  The best rolls to use are the King's Hawaiian rolls.  The sweetness in the rolls is a perfect match for this savory treat!  I also chop the ham, but leave the Swiss cheese in slices.  I just lay them on top of the chopped ham.  I also loosely cover them w/ foil while baking.  It helps get everying melted w/o drying out the bread.

I was looking for this recipe, and followed it to the T.  The rolls were soaked in grease.  I had made them for my parent's 50th anniversary party, and they were eaten, but I was embarrassed!

Gave it four stars because there is a step that really makes these better. These are a big hit in my neighborhood, but everybody uses even more of the "sauce", you put it in the pan and then also brush on the top and then... most important part... refrigerate overnight. The sauce soaks into the bun (I prefer hawaiian rolls), then when you bake them, the sauce carmelizes, that's the best part. Added benefit is the more time-consuming work is done the night before with only the baking the day of the event.

I omitted the onion in the topping, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I knew my ham and cheese loving husband would like these, but my kids were fighting him for seconds and thirds.  Needless to say, these were very popular, and considering how easy they were, I will be making these on a regular basis.  This was a quick, easy way to feed everyone a weekend lunch.

Very easy, and very good! I was worried about the bottoms being soggy, but I wrapped them in foil and the bottoms actually were crisp. I did puree my onions.

I liked these, but they got mixed reviews at our Superbowl party. I had honey dijon mustard in my fridge, so that's what I used. I also didn't have the poppy seeds. I used Hawaiian sweet rolls and sliced swiss in stead of shredded. I thought they were really good, but my hubby (who likes everything) wasn't crazy about them. Four others thought they were good, though. I only give 4 stars b/c of the mixed reviews at our house tonight :)

I was looking for a recipe that was close to the ham & cheese rolls we have every Christmas morning and these came real close. I plan on making these again just reducing the amount of poppy seeds to only 1 tbsp and add more onion. I don't think I put enough onion in the first time around. Also add more mustard. My fiance agrees with me on the adjustments since its his family that makes these and I think they are good just some adjustments needed. Thanks for the recipe.

I grew up with these sandwiches.  We always called them "Company Sandwiches" as you could prepare them ahead of time, wrap each in foil and throw them in the freezer.  When "company" would stop by you could put them on a baking sheet and bake them right from the freezer -- we didn't need to thaw them out first.  I've been making them myself for over 30 years and they are always a hit.  I usually use dried minced onion so you don't have to have your eyes tear up if you don't want them to.  Enjoy the recipe!

Made these for a murder mystery party and they were a huge hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I took other's advice and used the Kings Hawaiian rolls, sliced the tops off and made a dozen at a time.  I substituted fresh chives for the onion and it was delicious.  Made these a couple weeks in advance and then froze them.  The butter mixture was enough for 2 dozen rolls. Will definitely make these again. Great tailgating recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of some things I did.  First, I used honey ham which I don't like a whole lot in the first place.  Second, I followed some of the other reviews and used Kings Hawaiian Rolls.  The combination was way too sweet for my tastes.  I made these 2 different ways.  One according to the directions and one with a few changes for BF.  I used yellow mustard and no onions in the sandwiches for BF.  The original ingredients are MUCH better.  I think there could be more mustard and less butter though.  Next time I will use smoked ham and either make my own rolls or buy plain or wheat dinner rolls.  Not sweet ones.  Will be making again! Thanks!

I made these for a ladies luncheon at the park.  They were very well received.  I didn't use as much onion as called for.  I made my own rolls (2 1/2 oz size) and wrapped each one seperately in foil.  (Spray foil with cooking spray)  Heated in the oven and then transported in a hot box to the event.  They stayed warm in a chaffing dish throughout the event.  Perfect for all ages.    These could easily be assembled the night before and heated the day of the event.

These were very good - I made them as part of a bunch of appetizers for a New Year's Eve family party.  I particularly liked how crisp the outside of the bun was in contrast to the center.  One person who doesn't even like ham loved them.  My only thought is that next time I may try to reduce the butter - by HALF!  I felt that it was a lot of butter on the roll (and I love butter, so that is saying a lot).  All in all - very good and well-liked.

this recipe is for 24 small dinner rolls and calls for 2 sticks of butter, poppy seeds,one small FINELY GRATED onion, worcestershire sauce,and dijon mustard mixed and spread on the inside of half the roll, then topped with ground good quality cooked ham and grated cheese then top with other half of the dinner roll and wrap tightly in aluminum foil-at this point you may freeze or refrigerate them. When ready to make them (thaw if you froze them) then you place them in the oven and bake.

My bunch loved these!  I've had these before, but with the butter mix poured over the top of the prepared sandwiches.  Buttering the inside is the way to go since it's not so oily on the outside. Using Hawaiian Rolls, I generously buttered the inside of the bottom roll and lightly buttered the inside of the top roll.  Also used Honey Mustard as a another reviewer suggested, but the Dijon would be good too.  I didn't have poppy seeds and we didn't miss it.  Recipe will not disappoint!

I made these for my sister's wedding and learned that they freeze very well if you wrap them appropriately (foil, then freezer safe bags). They are very easy to make and are a big crowd pleaser.

Everyone loved these sandwiches.  I used Hawaiian rolls, spread the butter/mustard mixture on the inside, not over the top.  Did not use poppy seeds because I could not find them in the store.  I doubled the recipe, making one ham & provolone, and one roast beef & provolone with horseradish sauce.  Very tasty.  Thanks Doreen for this great recipe.

Who knew a ham and cheese sandwich could be so good?!  These are phenomenal!  Perfect for appetizers or as a dinner with soup.  I left out the poppy seeds and only used about 1/4 of a large onion.  I didn't use all the spread either.

Our dear friend Anita (now passed) always brought over enough of these delicious sandwiches every New Year's Day to serve an army.  We have always loved hers, and so I have been trying to duplicate her version of them.  This is about as close as it gets.  We like them with more ham and cheese than called for, though.  I made these with Soft-N-Fluffy Hamburger Buns from this site, crowding the rolls close together so I could slice them horizontally like Anita did!  So yummy!

I've made these using the rolls mentioned. Recently I wanted to add a little variety to this stand by. I got a loaf of Black Forest Rye bread. Each slice makes one of these sandwiches. The rye bread added a whole new demension to these wonderful treats. They were such a hit I then tried Seeded Jewish Rye, Sourdough, and Sundried Tomato Foccacio breads. Got raves form everyone. I kept everything but the breads the same and they always turn out beautifully. Thanks for a great party or even famliy dinner dish.

These are delicious! I've made another version of this recipe, and I prefer this one. The other recipe called for melted butter, but I prefer the softened butter in this recipe. I cut the softened butter to 1/2 cup or one stick. I left everything else the same and used King's Hawaiian rolls.

These were easy enough and tasty, but nothing spectacular.  It's a basic melted ham and cheese with a slight mustard flavor.

Yum!  These were so good and easy.  I used about a tablespoon of onion powder instead of the grated onion, due to our guests' tastes.  We used mini party rolls and stuck each with a toothpick to keep it together.  Simple food with a gourmet twist - love it!

These are highly addictive delicious sandwiches.  I halved the recipe today to munch on while watching football.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and they are great as is.  I will be making these often from now on.

I'm really trying hard not to run to the store, so I used what I had. No butter, so I rubbed Olive Oil on the buns, sliced cheese, ham & a bit of Honey Mustard. This was a great idea for me to use what I had & make a great breakfast, thanks!

I made this for my daughter's high school basketball team one day when they had back-to-back games late in the afternoon.  To say they went over well doesn't even begin to describe the hit this made.  They were gone as fast as I could hand them out!

I LOVE onion, but this was way too pungent!  I would modify them and give it another go, less onion & less butter!  OR-double the amount of rolls used.

Yummy!!! These little sandwiches are so good and so easy to make. I followed the recipe as written and used hawaiian rolls. My family loved them, my brother said they tasted a bit like white castle cheese burgurs. It might be the onion mixture with the soft rolls. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make. I didn't have poppy seeds so I use sesame seeds instead. I also only used 1/2 an onion. The only thing I would do next time is mince the onion, so there were not big pieces.

OUTSTANDING!  Used the sweet Hawaiian rolls as recommended, cutting off upper half of rolls in one slice.  Wrapped in foil earlier in day and reheated tad longer since they were cold.  Really loved them and will make again!

My new husband bravely (or foolishly) told me last year that his ex wife made these and that he really liked them. That didn't go over well with me, but I made them anyway and I LOVE THEM. I make them for many of our family gatherings (along with a few of my own original things) and they always get gone quick.

So easy and delicious. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the spread, which complimented the sweetness of the swiss (and saltiness of the ham) very nicely. These were obviously a hit  because within 10 minutes I turned around and they were ALL gone!

They were good, but not great.  I made all the spread (using maybe 1/3 cup grated onion), but then used 3/4 of it on the 2 doz dinner rolls.  They were still pretty greasy and soggy.  My guests ate them but there were no rave reviews and I had leftovers.  They're okay, but I don't think I will make them again.

In our family we call these Ham Delights and we like them any time of the day for any meal - brunch, lunch, party appetizer, or a light supper. We used to always use the Pepperidge Farm Party rolls but sometimes have trouble finding them these days. The Hawaiian mini rolls or small potato rolls work well also, even though they may be a little larger than the Pepperidge Farm rolls.  It's really important not to change the ingredients in this recipe. You must have the butter, the poppy seeds, the grated onion, the Worcestershire sauce, and the Dijon mustard. You must not substitute another cheese for the Swiss cheese. Shaved deli ham works just fine. I've never used chopped cooked deli ham.

I made these and followed the directions, except I only used 1/2 onion, grated. My husband and I thought these were very tasty and delicious (although our kids did not like the spread on the sandwiches). Even though I only grated 1/2 onion, I thought there was a tad too much onion. We will make these again.

I liked them, my family thought they were "okay".  There was WAY too much butter spread, that could have been cut in half and still been too much.  Also "one onion" is very subjective, I like to use yellow onions which are sweeter but generally bigger.  I would say if you keep the other ratios the same then 3/4 to a cup of onion in the spread is plenty.

The recipe had gotten good reviews so I thought I'd try it, and boy was that a mistake.  I love onions, but they just did not go with this.  Mini sandwiches on rolls isn't a bad idea but that sauce is no good.  I made these just like the recipe calls for and after a couple of bites, everyone turned their nose up at these including me.  I really think kids would hate these.  Unless you're adventuresome and willing to waste food, don't try these.

This is an easy and great appetizer.  I used the above recipe as written; however, I completely melted the butter and used a brush to spread the mixture on the rolls.  It goes a long way.  I also used packages of 24 party potato rolls.  I made 60 rolls for a church function, used all of the butter mixture, and almost 1 1/2 lbs of slice deli ham and 3/4 lb of sliced swiss cheese.  My Mom used to make these too.  Her recipe calls fro a 1/2 teaspoon horseradish instead of worcestershire.  A little tip... Instead of pulling the rolls apart, I slice the 12 rolls horizontally into a big square and spread on the butter mixture.  Then I layer the slices of ham and cheese, put the top back on, put them on foil and cut the individual rolls before baking.

These sandwiches are sooooo good. I followed the recipe given and have made them a few times.  I love them straight out of the oven, but have found them to be even better if they sit for while. This allows that butter mixture to soak into the bread to add more flavor and then its not running down your arm when you bite into the sandwich. I bag up the left overs and they make for a great breakfast in the morning as well.  Off to buy my ham now since these are a part of our Christmas Eve fun food. Thank you for this recipe~!

This spread was soooo very very good.  I reduced the butter by half.  The dijon mustard mixed in with the worcestershire was SUBLIME when spread on toasted bread and piled high with thinly sliced Hatfield Black Forest ham and then melted Swiss Cheese.  WOW.

Very good!  We made these for family on Christmas Eve.  We made them about an hour before everyone arrived, then kept them warm in a roaster.  These were a huge hit with everyone!  Next time we are going to try different meats and cheeses and play around a little with the flavors in the butter.

I have been looking for this recipe to prepare for my son's wedding reception.  One variation from the way I originally learned it--I melt the butter-mix in the poppy seed, onion, worcestershire and mustard--then use a pastry brush and paint both sides of the rolls(that I cut all together)

My mom and I made these for years, but lost the recipe.  I was glad to find this so I could serve them for Thanksgiving Day appetizers.  They were a hit.  This batch made 24 sandwiches and I used the Hawaiian Sweet rolls this time.  Usually I use the pull apart rolls and make many tiny sandwiches.

Loved It!!  I made this for my nephew to take to work for a potluck.  He said it was the favorite of the day!  I used Hawaiian King rolls and cut the poppy seeds to 1 Tbl.  I used about 8 oz of swiss cheese because I wanted cheese on the bottom and top of the ham.  I spread a thin layer of the butter mixture on top of the rolls and still had some leftover.  I had to email a copy of the recipe because everyone liked it so!  Great recipe...I will make this again!

I made these with Ham & Swiss, as well as Roast Beef & Chedder - there wasn't one sandwich left.  Absolutely wonderful!

I made these using Sweet Hawaiian Dinner Rolls and they were GREAT!  I suggest cutting the spread mixture in half - it makes way more than needed.  Works well with any kind of ham. I find using cheese slices is easier than shredded.  I also omit the onion in the spread.  I could fit 9 into a 13x9 pan.  I wrapped the others in foil and put them in the fridge so the kids could eat them for lunches.  Just remove foil, wrap in a paper towels and microwave for about 30 seconds and they have a warm yummy sandwich.  Thanks!

I made these to take to a gathering with friends where soup was the main course and these little sandwiches were the perfect side.  They went in a flash!  I will definitely make these again.  They were quick enough to make after work and before the party.

Made these for a baby shower & they were a hit! At first people were like "so what, it's just a ham & cheese sandwich"... until they tasted it.  I did halve the amount of butter mixture & still had enough to do both sides of bread. I did not spread any of the butter on top.

Made this just as written for a party, the spread really added a lot to the sandwich.  Was very easy and delicious...by the time I went back for another sandwich they were all gone!  Guess I'll just have to make some for myself!

For the past few years, I've taken these tasty sandwiches to our July 4th picnic.  They are delicious and usually the first dish to be empty.  I could use less butter, and they would still be great - but who counts calories on the 4th of July? :)

TERRIFIC!  DELICIOUS!  FANTASTIC!  My aunt makes these for Christmas Eve every year.  Since I couldn't get home this year (and these are worth the trip alone), I decided to make these myself.  I used half the poppy seeds, and spread the sauce on both sides of my bread as well as reserving a bit to spread on top.  I just used some brand of brown and serve rolls.  Wonderful!  Please make these.

I never thought I would need a recipe for ham and cheese, but when I tried these and shared them with family they all said "hands down the best ham and cheese sandwiches I've ever eaten".  I used Kings Hawaiian rolls instead of party rolls, delicious.

These are sooo  much better if you use hawaiian sweet rolls, and pour the butter, worcestshire mixture on top of the rolls too before you bake them.  Love these sandwiches!

I made these last year around the holidays when I had a lot of country ham to use up.  Took to a few gatherings and had lots of positive comments. Didn't realize just how well they went over until this week... I've received 2 requests for the recipe and 1 request to bring these to a holiday get-together!  When people remember a dish a year later, it has to be good. I left out the onion and used country ham. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, kind of reminds me of a healthier version of Krystals. I used dried minced onion instead of fresh. Worked out great.

These were so easy and very good! My sister-in-law and myself made these for a large family gathering. She made the ham/swiss and I made them with roast beef/cheddar so the family would have a choice. Both were excellent and are easy to freeze for a snack at any time. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely a keeper.  Everyone loved it at the bridal shower.  Used shaved honey ham & it was a huge hit.  Can definitely be made up ahead of time and kept refrigerated until ready to heat which was a huge time saver for the party.

These were a hit with friends and family at a recent gathering.  Even my 15 month old got a bite and signed for more.

I think I may cut back on the onion next time as everyone commented on the onion be really strong (but it did not keep them from 2nds and thirds).

Will def make again.  I used deli ham and sliced my own cheese because I felt the shredded would be too messy.

Very good. I only used half of the butter spread though, saved some calories! Also, use sliced cheese and it was fine.

Don't be scared away by all the butter, it's not like you eat them every day!  These are so good, I used Sister Schubert Yeast Rolls.  Also, don't skip actually grating the onions.  I tried to just add chopped onions once, and it's not the same thing.  Any kind of ham works, I prefer black forest ham to chopped.

This was my mom's "fancy party" appetizer when I was growing up--my brother and I used to sneak one from the tray.  They're easy to make, can be made ahead and frozen and are a real crowd pleaser.

THESE LIITTLE SANDWICHES WERE VERY TASTY AND EASY TO MAKE. I USED SLICED CHEESE INSTEAD OF SHREDDED BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER. I ALSO SUBSTITUTED SEASME SEEDS FOR THE POPPY SEEDS BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE ANY POPPY SEEDS.

Very easy and were a hit! Next time I will cut the butter mixture in 1/2 ... I threw a lot of it away. Also, I used the hawaiian bread but thought it was to sweet. I love the idea of making these ahead of time and freezing them. I will be making these again for myself, using whole wheat rolls,

Easy delicious hot little sandwich. I scaled this down to 2 servings and used full sized hamburger buns, I had enough spread for both of them. I used onion powder instead of fresh and I only had  shredded colby jack cheese so that is what I used. This was simple and tasty. Thanks for posting this recipe.

My kids have affectionately dubbed these "hammies". Always delicious as an appetizer or for a quick dinner.   We use onion powder in place of the grated onion.

Really good.  I used the sweet hawaiian rolls and Boar's Head sliced ham and slices of swiss cheese.  I set up an assembly line prep after cutting my ham and cheese into roll size squares. Didn't need one whole onion.  I used less than half and there was plenty of onion flavor.  Really good party food that is a little more substantial.

These were so tasty. I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used regular yellow mustard. I didn't realize the recipe called for 2 packages of rolls. I used one pack of Hawiian rolls. The butter made it too greasy but maybe it's because I only used 1 pack of rolls. My husband ate 4 sandwiches and said "This is a very good sandwich" :0

I had these at a party and searched for a recipe to serve at my New Year's Eve Party. What a hit! I put everything but the cheese in a food processor and made a spread. We'd had a honey-baked home for Christmas so the leftovers were wonderful. It was very simple to use. I used dinner rolls but next time I'll find smaller rolls so they go further. Of course I could have cut the rolls in half. Adults and teenagers loved them and the whole gang wanted the recipe.

These were very good- I scaled the recipe down to only 6 rolls to make dinner for my husband and I.  I used King's Hawaiian Wheat Rolls, provolone cheese, and spicy Danish mustard.  We really enjoyed these.

I placed 12 fresh deli dinner rolls in a glass 13X9 pan, used 1/2 the butter called for, only 1T of grated onion, a dash of worcestershire, and 2T dijion, sliced deli baked ham & deli swiss. I covered the whole pan with heavy duty foil instead of individually wrapping ea. roll. Baked 20 minutes at 350 and they were perfect, not soggy at all, everybody loved them, gone in fifteen minutes.

These were a hit at the Christmas luncheon.  I have a similar recipe, but it is much more time consuming and does not taste any better.  
note to self: ( I used a different type of bread this time, go back to Hawaiian brand, this type did not cut easily)  Also , this amount of butter spread would  spread over 3 dozen for me, I threw out excess spread.

What a great appetizer! We made these for my bridal shower and I'm telling you, they were gone almost instantly! We will definitely be using this recipe again! I think I might change it up a bit and use thick slices of ham on regular size buns and make this a hearty sandwich for our next party!

I omit the onions when I make this recipe.  I also use honey ham sandwich meat and sliced swiss cheese.  It's always a hit!  I serve them at parties or for breakfast - and never have any leftovers.  If you make extra, just refrigerate and reheat in microwave.  Recipe also freezes very well!

I wish I could give these little sandwiches 10 stars. I can't believe something so simple to make could be so freakin good. I'm making these next time I need something for a party. Awesome recipe Doreen!!

These are fabulous! What makes these is the spread. You need to GRATE the onion just like it says, with the smallest side of the grater so the onion is basically liquified. I used frozen rhodes rolls and just baked them about 10 minutes, let them cool, then added the spread, meat and cheese and they turned out soooo good! I have since made them with turkey and cheddar and they were excellent. The only things I changed with the spread are a little less poppy seeds and regular mustard (all I had). Excellent recipe!!

These were good but not my favorite.  I followed the directions except I added 2 cloves of garlic to the minced onions.  I also halved the butter mixture since I was only making these for 4 people. I like all of the things that go into this recipe, but the finished product in my opinion was just ok.  My children ate theirs without the butter and my husband only had 1.  These would be good for feeding a large crowd, but I probably won't make them again for us.  Thanks anyway.

I really enjoyed these sandwiches but would definitely make some changes next time.  I took these to a get together and everyone really liked the way they tasted but the chunks of ham kept falling out.  I think it would be less messy to use sliced ham and sliced swiss cheese.  I will also cut the butter and seasoning in half because I didn't need nearly so much as the recipe called for.  I did leave out the poppyseeds because I don't care for them but the sandwiches still had a wonderful taste.

I'm packing 25 bag lunches for a group of flyfishers taking casting lessons from my husband Saturday. He didn't want just sandwiches and chips, but needed hearty fingerfood. I thought of bierrocks, but they are best when warm.These folks will be out on the lake. Then I found these little ham and cheese sandwiches. I decided that they would be less messy if enclosed (like a bierrock). So I went surfing and found Taylor's Piroshki on this site. I used this ham/cheese idea as filling in the Piroshki dough. Wow! They turned out great. I will make some fresh ones Friday night and send them along in the bag lunches. Thanks for a great sandwich idea, Doreen. The first ones I made are in the freezer as we speak. Hopefully they will be as good thawed and reheated!

I was a little nervous making these as I wasn't sure about the onion mixture. These were very tasty  and I would for sure make again. I used the Hawaiian sweet rolls.

I've been making this recipe for 20 years (minus the poppyseeds , which get stuck in your teeth. Ha). I had to share the tip I received 20 years ago.  I use a package of "finger" rolls or my favorite - the Hawaiian King rolls.  They both have to be cut apart. All you do is slice the package of rolls horizontally in half so that the tops of the rolls are one big piece and the bottoms of the rolls are one piece. Just spread the butter mixture on either sheet of rolls and assemble.  I use sliced ham (whatever is on sale) and slices of Swiss and layer.  (Dont make the layer too thick. the rolls arent big enough to handle alot of meat ) . Put the sheet of tops onto the sandwich. Now you have 1 big sandwhich until they are cut. Lightly butter the tops and bake on a cookie sheet  until golden (about 15-20 min)  Take them out, cool a couple of minutes and  , and with a knife, cut the rolls according to the shape of the roll.  It' sounds like a lot but so much quicker than individual rolls and so much of a hit if you use the Hawaiian Rolls. I put the finished mini sandwiches back in the cardboard holder and back into the bag it came in, to transport.  Sometimes I even bake them when I arrive at the gathering.  People always ask about them!, give it a try!

I made these tonight for the first time, and they were great! I had to  modify slightly to use what I had on hand that wouldn't sacrifice the overall taste significantly...substituting with a few dried onions and sesame seeds. I also reduced the amount of butter. For a softer roll, I also covered the pan when heating. Very good!

Made these for a baby shower a while back. About half of the people at the shower asked for the recipe! One thing, the amount of sauce made can easily make double the number of sandwiches. I used the sweet King Hawaiian rolls that most groceries have in the bakery/deli section. Very tasty!

I have made these for years for home and work. I use the Party Rolls. I melt the butter with the mustard, etc. I brush the bottom inside layer with the mixture. When the top layer of rolls are laid on the ham and cheese I cut through the layers and then pour the remainder of the butter mixture on top, spreading with a brush. Cover with foil and bake.

These were pretty good.  I did not add all the poppy seeds as I thought it would be to much, and used plain mustard as I am not a fan of dijon.  Yum!

These are great for lunch too. The mustard spread is so flavorful that they are still good without the cheese (for those who can't have dairy).

When I first saw this recipe, Ham and Cheese Sandwich, I thought "oh come on?!" So, I read it and am so glad that I didn't pass this one by plus all the reviews were great, maybe there is something to this.  I thought it seemed a little labor intensive making all these little bitty sandwiches, but I read the reviews and really got into it.  I first sliced all the rolls (Hawaiian naturally) in one sweep of the knife horizontally, easy enough, then spread the butter spread on the bottoms.  I had thin shaved ham and just kind of draped that all over the bottom so it was well covered, then layered sliced Swiss cheese on top of that.  Put the top layer on and spread some of the butter spread on top of the rolls.  Put a large piece of foil on a cookie sheet, and put into the freezer so as not to smush the butter and rolls and I let it in their for about 15 minutes.  Wrapped in up and put it in the freezer.  My second package, did exactly the same thing, but decided I would try spreading some of the butter spread on the inside of the tops.  This all took less than 10 minutes.  This is great and I was all set for company and all I had to do was pop them in the oven.  These are fantastic!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  These are to die for!!  A must try and oh so easy to make. For those that thought it was too much onion, it would really depend on the size of your onion.  I had a relatively small onion, so I used the whole thing and it was just perfect.

I have made this recipe for several years and it is a family favorite. I use slice cheese and put swiss on 1 side and cheddar on the other. It is an excellent meal after a sports practice. Just add a salad and heat the premade sandwiches and you can't go wrong. I have taken them to all sorts of parties and work events and I am always asked for the recipe.

I've made this recipe for many years and love it. It is always a popular appetizer. The new Peppridge Farms Slider rolls are the perfect size. I make mine with spicy brown mustard and have the ham shaved and the swiss cheese shredded. I also wrap the sandwiches in foil when baking. These are sooo good!

Okay, I need to add to my last review!  I put a tad of the butter mixture in the bottom of the pan.  I then pour the rest OVER the sandwiches once they are made!  They don't get soggy this way.  I also use hawaiian bread and cut the tops off of the entire pack.  I then top it with the meat and cheese then put the entire top back on.  I then cut it into individual sandwiches!  This saves tons of time!!

This is the second recipe like this I have tried from this site, and although both are good, I prefer this one because of the onion!  I used dried minced onion and then let it sit in the creamed butter mixture until softened.  I used honey wheat Hawaiian rolls and left them connected - just sliced the tops of in a sheet.  Delicious!

I've loved these sandwiches for years.  I hosted a baby shower several months ago and they were a huge hit.  I usually skip the poppyseeds and have never made them with onions, but I'm sure they would be good that way also.

I made this recipe for Christmas when all the kid were coming to my house. I didn't have any poppy seeds so I just left them out. This is a great recipe! Everyone loved it including people that don't like onions couldn't even tell the onions was in it.

I made these for my daughter's 1st birthday party. They were pretty good. Don't be scared like I was to put the sauce on. I didn't put as much onion mixture on as I should have. It was very mild, so a little more would have been better. Someone said that it tasted like the sauce that "white castle" uses on their burgers. Never had one, but that's what she said.

There was one guest out of 6 who thought these were "okay."  The onion was completely over-powering, and 1/2 the sandwiches were soggy.  I did not enjoy the taste of the butter spread at all.

FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY...I made these for a small reunion get-together and am making them again tomorrow for another one. This was the only thing requested for the second time around. The mustard/onion mixture just makes the flavor stand out above all other small sandwiches. I do cover with foil while in oven. I only use 1 tbsp poppy seeds. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!

We thought these were very good.  Nothing spectacular, but certainly worth 4 stars.  The mustard sauce is what really made it stand out.  I used provolone slices instead of shredded swiss...I don't care for swiss, and I thought slices would be much less messy.  Other than that, followed exactly.  Will definitely make again.

These were really tasty little sandwiches!  Made them for family for lunch, they were eaten up quickly!  I baked some in foil, some not.  The ones in foil were soft, and the ones not in foil were crusty on the outside.  I prefer to bake them all in foil next time, as I like them on the softer side.

Easy is right! My husband said he was surprised at how much flavor these little sammies had. We had them at our super bowl party and kids and adults gulped them down quick. I did use the hawaiian sweet rolls and on half put the butter mixture on top, and the other half put it on the bottom. I couldn't tell a difference (some others had said on the bottom was too soggy) These will be my specialty at all events! Thanks

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have poppy seeds, swiss cheese, or white party rolls, so I used English muffins and Cheddar and I must say, these were delicious.

I've tweaked this recipe a little and my family loves it.  Reduce to 1/2 cup butter and add 1/2 cup brown sugar to the rest of the ingredients.  Mix and spread butter mixture on bottom of glass pan.  Make up the sandwiches, place them in the pan and flip them over a few times to coat.  Bake for 10 minutes uncovered, flip the sandwiches over and bake another 10 minutes.  They turn golden brown and are not soggy.  The brown sugar goes well with the swiss cheese and ham.  Enjoy!

I used the full amount of the spread, with no poppy seeds as I don't have any.  Didn't like the onion flavor.  Used sliced ham & cheese, and the mini dinner rolls.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and sliced the tops off in sets, and then put them back in the foil pan the rolls came in.  They were good (and kinda cute) -- but they do get a bit soggy.  As I worked through rows of rolls, I started cutting like 1/3 off the top rather than cutting them in half, and I think those were better.  I also think using a less soft roll would help.  I liked the flavor of the spread and almost hate to cut it back.  These are not as time consuming as I half expected.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was delicious. I altered it just a tad by using deli rolls and making them into full-size sandwiches. I put them together with the top of the bun on top of the fillings and then wrapped them in foil and baked them for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. The cheese was melty and the buns were crisp. They were really good. My husband was not as crazy about them as I was because he doesn't really like onions but he DID eat all of his and then the 1/3 of mine I could not so he liked them well enough! Give them a try... they really are good and very easy! The spread is delish!!!

The guys that came over for the football game loved them, I thought they were pretty good and easy.  I spread the butter mixture on the bottom of the rolls then broiled them to crisp them up a bit.  Then add the ham and shredded cheese and the tops of the buns and but them back in the oven to melt the cheese.  I couldn't really taste the butter mixture which I thought sounded really good.

Ten stars! I made these for an evening birthday party and made plenty hoping to take leftovers to work the next day. No such luck. They were gobbled up. I did not use the poppy seeds, but I'll try them next time. Big plus for this recipe is that you can make them ahead and keep them covered in the frig till right before you bake them. This is now a family favorite.

This did not turn out the way I expected at all.  I only used 1/4 cup butter, and it was still way to much.  The bread turned out all mushy and icky.  I think if you just poured the butter mixture over the top and then browned, it would be better.  Plus, the butter overpowers the mustard.  Leave this at home.

I've made these for 3 or 4 different functions now and every time, I get so many compliments and recipe requests.  They are horribly fattening with all the butter in them, but they taste really, really good.  So, make up for it some other way and try these sandwiches!

Not impressive.  I wasn't sure how much of the mixture to put on the rolls.  Maybe it would have been better if I had put a generous amount on them.  Otherwise, it was ordinary and on the bland side.

If you're going to eat them make sure to do it the night before your drug test, because what's life without a little danger.

This was an innovative and fresh way to use up some leftover Easter ham. I made a few changes by using sweet and spicy mustard instead of the Dijon and swapping slices of Swiss cheese for the shredded. Overall, they were a hit, but some thought it was a little spicy (probably my doing with the use of the spicy mustard) and I ended up with a ton of the leftover butter mixture. Next time, I would only make half of the butter mixture, but I think we'll be eating these again!

These sandwiches were pretty tasty but the bread was squishy, would figure out a different way to assemble next time.

This was a nice little appetizer! Everyone liked them, and the mixture is very good!. My only problem was I just took the dish out of the oven and set it on the table for everyone. So the bottoms of the rolls stuck to the dish after sitting there a little while. Next time I know to transfer them after they cool. Or I might try what the first review said and wrap them in tin foil and serve them in a little basket :)

I left out the poppy seeds simply because I didn't have them on hand, 1/2 cup of butter was sufficient, used King's Hawaiian rolls, wrapped them up individually in foil and heated them in the crock pot for a work party and they were FANTASTIC.  Got rave reviews and the crock pot was perfect to use instead of the oven.  I also used cheese slices rather than shredded just because it was easier to keep on the bun.  I'll be making these again soon!

One of my favorites!  I used dried minced onion because I am lazy.  Used Hawaiian butter dinner rolls and I will make exactly the same next time I make these.  Hubby and son loved them for lunch today!

Very yummy! I actually had these at a party and then went searching for the recipe. One time I used dried onion and the other time I omitted it. I don't ended up using less Dijon mustard the second time. Both times I left overnight in the refrigerator and baked the next day. I used Hawaiian rolls. Very delicious!!

This was delicious! The first batch, I spread the butter mixture kind of light, and there wasn't enough zip for the whole sandwich. I like the zip. So  my next batch that I will be making shortly, I'll add to the top and bottom of the rolls. I know my husband will love these!!

I made these for my daughters 3rd birthday party thinking the kids would enjoy...the parents ate more than the kids.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the butter spread made way too much. We coated both top and bottom but only a thin layer.  We only used 1 1/2 tablesppons of poppy seeds and maybe a 1/2 of an onion. We used slider buns which were a perfect size and we ran out of ham so we used some turkey meat in addition.  I can't wait to make these again - they were such a big hit.

I had no idea that a ham and cheese sandwich could be so transformed into such a special appetizer.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the mini-sandwiches in half in order to encourage more people to try them.  Most people who took the small piece came back for at least the other half later!

I would give this recipe more stars if I could. I made them at Christmas and then again for my parents' 40th anniversary party. Everyone LOVED them and my brother wants me to bring them to anything we have from now on. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

Yum yum! Great recipe, my aunt used to make these at Christmas time each year so when I saw the recipe I had to try them.  Took them to a 50th b-day party as an appetizer and they were gobbled right up! Everyone just loved them, as I did as well.

These were good, although with other reviews I was expecting a little more flavor.  I made 30 sandwiches, on dinner rolls purchased at Winco and easily had enough butter mixture.  There was enough to not only butter the bottom of each roll, but most of the tops too.  I can't imagine only making 16 sandwiches with all that butter.  I wasn't sparing with the butter mixture either.  I finely chopped my onion rather than grating and it tasted just fine - no big chunks of onion as another reviewer had mentioned.  I didn't even notice the onion, although I probably would have noticed if it weren't there.  Also I used an entire pre-cooked ham and just sliced it thin.  Probably at least a couple pounds of meat and they weren't overloaded in the least.   All the sandwiches were gone - so that's a good sign, but no one complimented them either.  Will keep in mind, but won't go out of my way to make them.  It's rather time consuming, albeit easy.

My family loves these!  I made them for a brunch at work and they were a huge hit.  I have found that making them with shaved him works better than slices.  I also cut down on the butter, using only one stick plus a couple of tablespoons more.

awesome easy recipe that my whole family enjoyed.  I followed the suggestions of a few and foiled the sandwiches to keep them soft... great idea.  I also tried this recipe with turkey... not as good as the ham.  will definitely make again.

Made these for a 4th of July party, and everyone loved them.  The only changes I made was that I only made half the sauce recipe to spread on the 12 small buns.  I wrapped all 12 buns in foil and baked in oven about 20min. or until cheese melted.  Very good!

My 17 year old was looking for something to bring to one of our family parties when we found this recipe.  Not only was she easily able to make it herself, but everyone asks her to bring it all the time now!  These sandwhiches don't last long, everyone eats them as soon as she takes them out of the oven.

I liked this recipe, it was different from your usual hot ham & cheese.  Easy to make & we made a meal out of it.  Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have swiss so I used white cheddar.  This was so yummy and a very filling late night snack.

These were the hit of my Christmas Eve party. I used 24 small potato rolls, about 1 lb each of shaved ham and roast beef, and about 1/2 pound of sliced cheddar cheese but didn't increase the amount of butter mixture. I did as some other reviewers recommended and spread most of the butter mixture on the rolls under the meat. I thought this made them a bit soggy on the bottom but they still tasted great. Next time I will try spreading the butter on top as the recipe recommends. I only used about a tsp of poppy seeds, sprinkling them on top of the rolls after brushing with a bit of the leftover butter. This recipe is a keeper.

I expected better than this turned out.  First of all, the amount of meat and cheese should be doubled unless your crew enjoys skimpy little sandwiches. The topping could use half the amount of poppy seeds and the butter is completely overwhelming.  Will not attempt again.

These are great!  I made a sample batch before making them for an upcoming baby shower and I am totally sold!!!!  Every one that dropped in (we have a busy house) tried them and loved them.  I used shaved ham, grated cheddar and one tablespoon of dijon and one of honey mustard for the butter mix.  The same night I was cooking up some pan fried pork chops and used the butter mix for them instead of oil or butter.  They were amazing also.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good. Used black forest ham, omitted the poppy seeds as I used sesame seed rolls, and rather than using the 1 c. butter, I used 2 tbsp light mayo & 2 tbsp butter (and still had left-over spread).  We like onion, though, so went with about 3/4 c. grated onion.  I used Havarti rather than Swiss, and took the advice of others and wrapped the sandwiches in foil and then baked for about 15 minutes.  Easy to prepare and not your typical "Ham and Cheese".  Next time I'll be a more generous with the sandwich spread as it is delish! Thanks Doreen!

I've made these several times and they're addicting.  I used onion flakes (too lazy to grate onion) and regular mustard, sliced swiss cheese and sliced cojack cheese.  My husband prefers the swiss, but I like the cojack.  These are great reheated in the microwave, too.

These are delicious and easy to put together.  I initially made only half the number of sandwiches it makes, so I have been making the sandwiches one or two at a time now and microwave them.  They are delicious!

I got this recipe from my sister-in-law years ago, but we always use boiled ham from the Deli sliced thin, and Slices Swiss Cheese.  The other suggestion I have it to use Honey Mustard, and twice as much.  I use a sweet/spicy honey mustard, and double the spread recipe so I can put it on the top and bottom of the rolls.  Everyone loves them, and they really have a lot of flavor.

AWESOME!!! A favorite at our home for a holiday appetizer.  I don't use worcestershire though, I replace it with Accent seasoning.  We like to use our leftover Easter Ham for a day after Easter treat!

Wow! I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe, and it's so simple!  I substituted dehydrated onion flakes for the grated onion since it was all I had on hand.  I've made these several times this way and people love them!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've made these a few times now and I absolutely love them. I have added crushed pineapple on one occasion it was perfect with the hawaiian rolls. My family doesn't care for all the butter so I cut it back.  I forego the poppy seeds since we like them to be a bit crispy. Thank you for sharing

While recovering from the flu I wanted something easy to put together for the fam.  I wasn't sure if I should make all 12 since I wasn't hungry and my 4 yr is also getting over the flu.  Well, good thing I did.  I had two, 4 yr old had two.  Son and husband devoured them.  Delish!

These were a hit for a girls nite out. I, too, varied the recipe using yellow mustard and half the amount of onion. I wanted flavor, not heartburn. I used slider-type rolls so needed to spray the tops and pan lightly with non-stick spray.

These were delicious! I made them exactly as per the recipe however I grated the onion. They were a hit at our party and easy to make. I found I had a lot of the spread left over. Next time I’ll either make more sandwiches or cut the recipe in half!

I use Kings Hawaiian Sub Rolls that are already sliced, sliced ham and Swiss cheese Slices. Then just cut sandwiches vertical/horizontal. Can freeze easily in original packages and pull out anytime! The kids love them. We call them Ham Delights.

I added a slice of turkey to each sandwich and used Muenster cheese instead of Swiss.   Another time I used the seasoned butter for sandwiches we grilled on the stove top. Just as good and a bit quicker

Am I the only one who thought that 8oz of ham and only 5oz of cheese for 24oz of party rolls was the most skimpy amount of filling for a “slider” type sandwich?? If you followed this recipe to a “T” you would end up with only .33oz of ham and .20oz of cheese per sandwich. It’s apparent every one upped the amounts of ham and cheese they used to make these sandwiches.                                                          With that being said, we all know we love this “recipe”. But let’s be honest the ingredients amounts are not accurate on this one.

Made these for a sports party and they were a hit.  I only made half the spread and that was enough.  I brushed some on the tops also prior to baking.  I make Roast Beef and cheddar ones also adding some fresh horseradish in place of the onion to the spread and they were delicious.

Easy finger food sandwich. I've also made using honey mustard dressing as a variation.

My sister in law made this many times and I found it here - she uses brown sugar instead (lower in cal and a bit better for you)(they say sugar is a recreational drug so less is more) but these are apps or main dish with several sides is plenty of food - love to serve with cheesy potatoes and cole slaw.  I love them!

These were a big hit. I finely chopped green onions/scallions instead of dried onion. I used Kings mini butter buns. And also heated covered with foil for 10 minutes and then uncovered for 8 minutes. I made a head of time and then just heated for the party!

What a hit! I served these alongside coffeecake, frittata, croissants, and fresh fruit....they were looooong gone before anything else.  Every single person commented on how much they like them!  I cut my package of rolls together, before breaking them apart, and assembled this like a giant ham and cheese sandwich (note: I did chop the ham up, and used more ham and cheese than called for-didn't measure).  To enhance flavor, I spread the sauce on both the top and bottom of the rolls.  What a breeze to make and tasty to eat!  You can bet I'll be making these again!  What a crowd-pleaser!

I'm a vegetarian & I made these leaving off the ham. They're delicious! I dipped them in sweet chili/grape jam BBQ  sauce & will be making more! Some adding the ham for the rest of the people in my family that does eat meat.

TO DIE FOR! My grandma first made these for my husband and I and wqe finished off 2 batches! We couldn't wait to get home a try it. The only changes I made was to use honey mustard instead of dijon. Also didn't use the poppy seeds. Very easy and delicious!

These were good but I thought 3 TBSP of poppy seeds was way too much.  I used the Hawaiian sweet rolls as suggested by others.  I was able to make 4 dozen and still had butter spread left over. Easy to put together, used ham slices and cheese slices and left out the onion. I will make these again.

COMPLETELY AWESOME! I receive rave reviews when I serve them at my house parties.  My preference is to use approximately 1/3 the amount of sauce stated, as the buns become a bit soggy and it's just TOO MUCH BUTTER for me!

We love these. I usually omit the poppy seeds when I make these for my family, I also use cheese slices, not shredded. With two teen boys I prepare these ahead and they can grab a quick, healthy snack.

As I kid I remember like others my mother would make ahead and freeze.  Great for a group and recipe can be easily scaled.  My mother-in-law uses sliced yellow chedder cheese while my mother uses sliced swiss cheese in their sandwhiches.  My family actually prefers the ham with cheddar.

Thanks for sharing the recipe.
