The Anginetti recipe is a dream come true. My Traditional Italian grandmother made these cookies every year and they were bakery perfect. None that I baked came out like hers until I tried this recipe. It really tastes like the authentic quality of melting in your mouth heaven and a not too sweet experience. They are a "Wow!" To give the cookies a more melt in your mouth quality, I substituted Crisco for the butter. I used the same amount that the recipe calls for. The Crisco needs to be heated and melted then cooled in order to take these cookies up one more notch towards perfection. The next variation that I added is actual lemon zest, in both the cookie and the icing. It then creates a cookie that is truly at the peak of gourmet perfection. I share this recipe with others, and I bake these cookies for so many holiday gifts for family, friends and loved ones. It's the one the people start asking for weeks and weeks before the holidays get into swing. They say, "I hope you're gonna bring us those lemon cookies again this year!!! What more can I say. Just make them.

Great Recipe!  Very similar to what you would find in a bakery.  My only suggestion would be to put the dough in a ziploc bag and snip off the tip (instead of using a pastry bag).

The first reviewer is right: a cookie press makes the gooey dough simple to handle and the cookies don't need 20 minutes to bake. 
These are very Italian cookies, not overly sweet, with a subtle eggy flavor set off by the tart lemon icing. The outside is sturdy and the inside tender and rather dry. The frosting dries like a fondant - hard, glossy and stackable. This cookie will appeal to adults more than to children. It's great with coffee and better the second day than it is fresh. These will ship well.  The recipe as printed makes plenty of extra frosting, possibly enough for a second batch of cookies. Next time I'll use more lemon juice and less water in the frosting.

This is a good recipe for anginetti.... very sticky though and hard to work with.... putting in fridge to harden up for a couple hours makes dough easier to work with and improves cookie.... you can also add lemon extract or oil to the dough and you can also make them anise orange or almond flavored with matching icing.... for those who don't know what this cookie is it is a simple delicate "eggy" cookie.... not sweet untill you put icing.... icing is needed on this one... my grandmother always frosted with very pale easter colors... pastels.... pink green yellow .... and you could also do blue or plain white is okay but not as pretty..... :)

These cookies were wonderful and tasted just like the ones my grandmother used to make. Her recipe called for lemon extract so I added a little to the dough.  I also used a cookie press which made dealing with this very sticky dough easy.  I would also only cook until the bottom edges just begin to brown.  Great recipe - Thanks so much for sharing!

These little gems were soo quick tomake, they were done in between making a pizza and cooking spaghetti marinara with minimal time and mess.

I didnt have a bakers piping bag however I made the cookies as little logs and they were just delicious. Better than any you can buy.

Love this recipe. I did add lemon zest to the icing to make it a bit more lemony. My one mistake was I made the cookies a bit on the small side. Next time I'll make them bigger just like you see in the Italian bakeries.

I had high hopes for cookie. It tasted like a lemon biscuit-very doughy & the frosting was not lemony enough. Even doctoring the frosting with extra lemon extract and juice couldn't help. Would definitely not make again.

I loved the hint of lemon in these.  These were a bit involved for me, but everyone seemed to like them.

I have made this cookie 3 times and the following changes really made it have more taste.  1/2 cup butter, instead of 6 tbl.   I also used only 1 tsp of vanilla.  plus a tablespoon of milk.  Dough is very sticky so I just used a spoon to make the cookie.   I only baked for 16 minutes, 20 is too long and cookies come out crispy. unless that is what you want.   Icing.  1 tbl butter, 1 cup confection sugar, 2 tble milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Dip the COOLED cookie into the icing as one reader suggested.  If you do it when the cookie is warm it just runs off.  These are good and they are something different to add to a cookie plate

I ALSO THINK THIS COOKIE WAS VERY DRY, MORE LIKE A BISCUIT AND NOT ENOUGH LEMON FLAVOR. WOULD DEFINITELY NOT MAKE AGAIN.

Very good. I think a great substitute for icing would be blackberry or blueberry jam brushed on top. Very easy to make.

These cookies are delicious! What worked for me was to chill the dough and then roll it out and cut with a 3" cookie cutter. I made Christmas trees for the holidays. I found they only needed to bake for about 8 minutes. The recipe made 4 dozen. I cut the glaze recipe down to a third and it was just the right amount. I added lemon zest to the glaze. These cookies look and taste very impressive, just like a bakery cookie.

These cookies are great. The dough definitely needs to be refrigerated for at least an hour to work with, because it is on the sticky side. I used the dough recipe but I changed the glaze a little bit, I used 1 tbs of fresh squeezed lemon juice with a sprinkle of lemon zest, 1 tbs of water, 1/2 tbs of unsalted butter, and 2 cups confectioners sugar, melted the butter on the stove, added in the rest until it formed the glaze, perfect!
