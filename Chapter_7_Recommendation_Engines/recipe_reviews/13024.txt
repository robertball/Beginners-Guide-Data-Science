After reading everyone elses reviews this is what I did to make the best Italian wedding soup I've EVER tasted.  First I used about 7 cups of broth. 6 cups of chicken broth, 1 can of beef broth.  The beef broth DEFINITELY adds that extra punch this soup needs.  Definitely only use 1/2 cup of orzo, and boil in a seperate pot.  I threw some green onions in.  With the 7 cups of broth, it was enough for 4 people, + 1 days leftovers, which you'll definitely want! Next time I'll bake the meatballs before hand to get some of the grease off.

My late grandmother came from the Old country, and I've used this recipe as a basis for replicating her recipe, but a few adjustments are critical.

First, the pasta must be cooked separately; otherwise, it thickens and ruins the soup. If you don't plan on leftovers, the pasta can be cooked in the soup, but you need to go easy on the amount of pasta. She always preferred alphabet pasta.

Second, she always used either ground turkey or chicken for the meatballs. Also, you need to take it easy on the spices in the meatballs because they can easily overpower the milder flavor of poultry. (By the way, why would anyone use ground beef in a chicken stock--it doesn't make sense, not to mention it isn't authentic.)

Third, she used celery in her recipe. I add a couple of stalks, finely diced. I also up the amount of carrots.

Finally, for an added touch, she always had hard-boiled eggs available for individuals to add, as they chose. It enriches the flavor and texture.

This recipe is very good--with these few tweaks. Thanks for sharing it.

I made a few changes to this recipe:
- Reduce pasta to 1/2 cup (You can use orzo, small shells, ditalini, orecchiette...)

- Brown meatballs in a little olive oil and drain before adding to soup. (Gives meatballs better color and flavor, and makes soup less greasy!)

- I increased carrots to 1/2 cup, and sauteed with 1/2 cup onion in a little olive oil to start.  I always saute vegetables in soup pot first, before adding broth. (Again, better flavor.)

- I use spinach or escarole; both are yummy!

Excellent soup!! I made this last weekend for lunch, and it was so good that I had to have it for dinner too!  I made a few minor adjustments to it.  For the meatballs, I used 1/2 lb grnd pork, 1/2 lb. grnd beef, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp steak spice and 1 tbsp worchester sauce and froze the rest of meatballs for next batch.  I also browned the meatballs before adding them to the soup. I increased the carrots to 1/2 cup, and decreased the pasta (acini di pepe) to 1/2 cup.  The pasta soaks up alot of liquid, so I cooked it separately and added it when the soup was finished cooking.  I'm definitely making this one again, and recommending it to others!

Delicious! Easy to make! Wonderful~

I followed the advice of others:
1. Make pasta separately (Acini de Pepe instead of orzo)
2. Baked the meatballs at 350 for 25 minutes
3. Used frozen spinach (I had some on hand)

I also added some celery as well as some onion, garlic and zucchini that I had sauteed in olive oil. (also other people's suggestions) It was a nice touch but I think I will skip it next time and stick with the original recipe.

This was fabulous!  I made it for co-workers and they loved it!  I did take the advice of so many and did sub acini di pepe for the orzo, a bag of baby spinach for the escarole, baked the meatballs ahead of time, and added a small boiled and diced chicken breast.  It was unbelievably good!  I even did it all ahead of time, kept things separated, and then put it all in the crock pot to heat through for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe Star!!!

I am the chef at a sports bar and grill in Dania Beach, Florida. My clientele consists not only of local residents but tourists from around the world. I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  You MUST MUST MUST let this soup rest overnight before serving to let the flavors fuse together. The first time I made this soup I cooked the orzo seperately, browned the meatballs but thought the broth was bland. I doctored it with basil, garlic and oregano but my shift ended and I gave up trying to fix the soup. When I came to work the next day the soup had sold out...a gallon of soup in 3 hours during a 90 degree Florida heatwave. I now make this regularly, I still doctor the broth but let the soup sit overnite with the meatballs so the basil infuses. I use fresh spinach instead of escarole and make the meatballs the size of my pinky nail so that there are plenty of them. This soup tastes good, looks good and will get you rave reviews.

I found this soup bland. Moreover, the amount of orzo the recipe asks for is excessive. If the soup is not eaten immediately the orzo absorbs all the liquid. The end result is anything but a soup.

YUM,YUM,YUM!  I love soup, especially Italian Wedding Soup.  This recipe is fantastic.  My only problem was that the orzo completely took over the pot by the time myself, honey and guests were scooping out our seconds (and thirds).  I doubled the recipe and the four of us didn't leave a drop left in the pot!  Will definitely be making again, and again, and again...  Thanks so much for sharing!

Used ground turkey instead of beef...added more seasonings (and garlic powder)...and used a little less orzo.  Turned out very good.  Thanks for the post.

I did lots of tinkering, but nothing that changed the basic structure of the recipe. For the meatballs, a little less bread crumbs, a little more Parmesan, finely chopped onion rather than onion powder and the additions of a clove of minced garlic, a little parsley and 1/2 tsp. salt. For the soup, HALF the amount of pasta still required that I add more broth in the end. I love escarole, but frozen spinach is what I had available and it was an equally good substitute. Any pastina (little soup pasta) would work well in this soup and tonight I used stelline (pasta stars). Hubs and I enjoyed this very much and I can only imagine how much better this will be for lunch tomorrow after the flavors have had a change to marry.  Great!

Thanks to all the helpful reviews, we loved this soup!  I took the advice of others to use 6 cups chicken broth & 1 cup beef broth.  I also added 1 clove minced garlic to the meatballs & used dried minced onion instead of onion powder.  The meatballs are delicious!  I baked them (on parchment paper) at 350 for 20 minutes to get that nice color & get rid of some grease.  Definitely good advice to go 1/2 cup on the orzo (even this ended up soaking up most of the liquid, but it was still pretty good!) & cook it separately.  I used 1 cup carrots & liked that amount.  I also added 1/2 of an onion (chopped) & 1 clove minced garlic sauteed with the carrots before adding broth & meatballs to simmer.  I only had a 10 oz box of frozen spinach so I used that (added near the end of cooking) and it was good to go!  The Hubster just loved this soup and he's a big fan of italian wedding soup, so that says a lot.  Thanks for the recipe and all the great advice!  Makes this a keeper!  :)

I made this last night using a 1lb of ground turkey for the meatballs. The other minor changes were to saute the 1 cup carrots, 1/2 cup onions and celery with a little olive oil first for about 6 minutes adding some white wine before adding 8 cups of chicken broth. I didn't have escarole but needed to use up some fresh spinach. Before serving I whisked 2 eggs with 2 Tbs of parmesan cheese stirred the soup in a circular motion and streamed the egg mixture into the soup. Seasoned with a little sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Yummy!

Easy & Delicious!  I made a lot of alterations, but I think the base recipe would be fantastic as-is.  Thanks Star!  (1) Used ground pork. (2) Baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes.  (3) Increased the carrots. (4) Used spinach rather than escarole.

My kids love wedding soup. They grew up on it. My mother-in-law made this all the time when she had her own Italian restaurant. A couple of suggestions, try boiling the meatballs in water first then add to the soup. It takes the grease right out. Second, boil your pasta separate but don't add it until you are ready to serve. Leave the pasta in a separate container and add it to your bowl as needed. Try adding a little olive oil to the pasta to keep it from sticking together while its in a separate container. Hope these work for you!

Normally, I am extremely studious and research all the recipes before I make them.  However, since this one had such high ratings, I decided to go for it.  Unfortunately, I think I should have read the reviews beforehand.  It is a good starter recipe.  I can only give this recipe 3 stars because it needs to be modified to be tasty and restaraunt grade.  First off, I decided to make a double batch since I had a pound of sirloin and a bag each of baby spinach leaves and carrots.   Like the majority of the people say, even though the meatballs are nicely seasoned, the soup, overall is quite bland.  To save the pot ... and dinner, I dissolved two large chicken bouilion cubes (once again, for a DOUBLE batch) in a couple of ladles of the soup broth and stirred into the pot.  Made a huge difference.  Also, the pasta amount definitely needs to be cut back by half.  I've got tons of leftovers. However, the pasta soaked up all the liquid.  So, instead of soup leftovers, I've got an extremely tasty pot of noodles, meatballs and veggies.  Once again, that can be salvaged with more canned broth during the reheating process.  But, realistically, it's way too much pasta.  I, too, used spinach instead of escarole - just a personal perference ... but tasty nonetheless.  My husband loved it ... and I will definitely make it again ... just with the changes I mentioned.

Comfort food at it's best! I made this because my friend really likes the Campbell's version, and I thought she'd like to try this. I added an extra 16 ounce can of chicken broth, used fresh minced garlic in my meatballs and broiled them before adding to the broth. Broiling the meatballs makes them taste better and allows you to drain off much of the grease that would end up in your soup. Acini di pepe pasta is very good in this soup as well. Taking the time to make a delicious pot of soup is so fulfilling. Try this, you'll like it!

I gave the original recipe 4 stars, as it's a pretty good base.  But upon reading other reviews I decided to make a few additions.  First, I made the meatballs separate and used half ground beef and half ground pork (1/4 of ea.).  In addition to the other ingredients listed, I added dried oregano, salt and pepper to the meatballs.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and cooked a 1/2 cup of orzo separately and added at the end.  I also did 4 cups of chicken broth, and 2 cups of beef broth and used spinach in lieu of escarole because I couldn't find it at the grocery store.

This is the process I used:  First, I made the meatballs, then in a large pot, I sauteed 1/4 cup of onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, and the 1/3 c. carrot in olive oil.  I then added and heated up the chicken and beef broths and added the 2 cups of chopped (fresh) spinach.  Meanwhile I was cooking the orzo and when it was done, I added it to the mix along with the cooked meatballs.  I then simmered altogether for 10 minutes then served with garlic bread!  YUM!

I made this for my boyfriend, and he loves it. The day before I made this recipe, I made my own stock, and I used 4 cups of that stock with one cup of beef bouillon - I thought I grabbed a can of beef broth, but when I got it home it was chicken. The flavor made by combining the broths is perfect! I used shredded carrots (so he'd eat them) and diced an onion for the soup. I did brown my meatballs slightly before adding them to the broth, and cooked the orzo separately. So I used a few dishes to make it, but it is worth the extra clean up! So good!

This was great! As suggested by other users I used 7 cups of broth (6 chicken and 1 beef) and I browned my meatballs in olive oil before adding them to the soup. The soup was not greasy at all and the flavor was amazing.  I also used spinach as my green! Great recipe, thank you!

So good! I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 turkey sausage for the meatballs (doubled batch and froze half for later), baked at 350 for 20-30 mins;  and pre-cooked the 1/2 cup orzo before adding at the end. Also added 1 c. beef broth and some thinly sliced celery. (Thanks, other reviewers!). Everyone loved it and I will definitely make again.

This was unbelievable!  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup of orzo pasta (as opposed to two) and I did cook it separately...it still continued to expand, but the taste is better than any restaurant wedding soup I have ever had!  Great for a cold snowy night!

Without a doubt, this is wonderful, and I'm not even Italian.  The first time I made this I used store bought frozen meatballs, and DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!

Delicious! I used 5 cans of low sodium chicken broth and one frozen box of spinach instead of the escarole. Cooked the frozen spinach in the boiling broth with the carrots and then added the raw meatballs....it came out perfect...great soup recipe!

This is wonderful recipe, especially considering how fast and easy it is! I'm usually someone who picks the green things out of soup, but i ate half the pot myself the night i made this, green things and all.

The only adjustment i made based on other reviews was to cook the orzo separately to avoid it sucking up all of the broth.

The preparation time is short except for the making of the small meatballs.  I would suggest cooking the meatballs seperately in slightly salted water so as to be able to skim the frothy material that is rendered from the meatballs. I would cook the pasta seperately also.  I have made this soup several times and find this method best for my liking. This is a fantastic soup. I used frozen spinach for the greens. Dan Z.

Tasty but needed some additions. For the meatballs I did not add basil or onion powder, I chopped a small clove of garlic and 1 TBS chopped fresh parsley and added it to the meat  I also added 3TBS bread crumbs and 2 TBS grated parm along with the egg instead of what the recipe called for. In the pot for the broth I sauteed in olive oil 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 medium onion, and 2 medium carrots all chopped fine. I also added some chopped anise because I didn't have celery on hand. then I added  a box of Trader Joe Chicken Broth and about a cup of water, let it come to a boil and then added the meat balls. and let it cook for about 15 minutes. I added 1/2 cup orzo and let it simmer until the orzo was cooked, and finally a bag if fresh spinach. I knew there would be no left overs which is why I cooked the pasta in the soup. I used lean chop meat and had no problem with the soup benig greasy at all. Good base recipe, thanks for adding.

This was absolutely SLPENDID! My boyfriend and I had never made wedding soup. He is crazy italian so he doctored u the meatballs with extra cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic powder, basil and some oregano. Still the stated amount of egg and meat, however. They were DELICIOUS! Other than that, followed the recipe to a "t". The only other changes that I think I will do next time is to add a bunch of onion (personal preference) as well as maybe some ground oregano, basil, and salt and pepper to taste to the broth itself just to liven it up a tad. Regardless, great recipe. Thanks!

Wow, I can't believe I forgot to review this recipe!  I made this for a church function a couple weeks ago (doubling the recipe) and people were scraping the bottom of my crock pot to get the last little bits out!  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef because we don't eat ground beef.  I also substituted spinach for the escarole, as the recipe description suggested was possible.  Lastly, to make it a little more authentic, I used acini di pepe (tiny balls of pasta) instead of orzo.  The only bad part about this recipe is the time it takes to roll all those tiny meatballs, but when people scrape the bottom of the pot because it's so good, it makes it worth the effort.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

YUM.  Good soup, I used spinach and acini de pepe as others had suggested.  I cooked the pasta first to prevent absorbtion of all of the broth, and it worked out well for us.  Thanks Star!

I didn't care for this recipe. The orzo took control of the recipe. It calls for too much. There was also something that I didn't care for in the meatballs, but I couldn't figure out what. My daughter did enjoy it though.

This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!  I made it after visiting a local Italian food restaurant and wanting to duplicate what they had made.  This is 10 times better!  The meatball mixture makes more than enough meatballs but as I am a veggie lover -- I doubled the amount of veggies put into the mix.  I give this one an enthuiastic two thumbs up.

I, too, am from Rhode Island.  I have tried many recipes to compare to the wedding soups that are so popular here.  This, by far, is the best.  I think the meatballs could use a little pizazz so I add a dash of Heinz 57 Steak Sauce to the meatballs, but I would not change one other thing!

I'm usually so disappointed when I make a soup, somehow I just don't like it as much as when I have it at a restaurant, but this was great and pretty simple to make. I substituted ground chicken for beef since that's the way I've always had it and used acini de pepe rather than orzo. Also cooked the pasta separately as other reviewers have mentioned. Other than that I stuck to the recipe as written and this was a really nice soup. Just added some black pepper and sprinkled some pecorino romano on top when serving. Will definitely make again. The little meatballs are kind of fun to make!

This recipe was a really good start, but with some tweaks it made the best soup I've ever had. Instead of hamburger meatballs, I felt sausage would add more flavor so I bought a tray of sausages and removed them from the casing. I then rolled the meat into balls and browned them and patted them dry to remove most of the fat. For stock, if you don't have any homemade I like to used 6 cups of water and two Knorr Homestyle Stock jelly cubes. I then season with onion powder, garlic salt and salt/pepper to taste. Finally, I use frozen spinach instead of escarole, and small bowtie pasta instead of orzo. I cook the pasta before hand so it doesn't soak up all of the stock and add the spinach to the boiling stock to thaw.

Changes I made: baked mini turkey meatballs in 350 oven for 15 min, added spinach instead of escarole, sautéed onion, garlic, carrot and celery in pot before adding stock, and used tiny star pasta instead of orzo. Delicious and a family favorite!

This was very good. I changed a couple of things to give it a light but flavorful taste. I double the recipe to feed our family of 6. to make the meatballs I used 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey, 1/3 cup bread crumbs, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup parma cheese. I added the meatballs to the boiling broth that was 10 cups low sodium Chicken broth and 2 cups beef Stock. Along with meatballs I added the carrots, onions, and 1 stalk of celery, chopped. after 8 minutes, I added  14 oz of Fresh Spinach, chopped, and 1/2 cup parma cheese, and 1 cup orzo pasta and cooked for another 10 minutes.  I was perfect! :) Thank you for this great start to a wonderful soup!

Wonderful!!!  The only thing I do different is cook the meatballs prior to putting in the soup.  I either bake them on a cookie sheet in the oven (keeps them in the best shape) or brown in a small amount of oil in the pan I later cook the soup in.

I read the reviews first and made with the following changes. Doubled the carrot, halved the pasta (cooked it first), and used half beef and half chicken broth. I also browned the meatballs in a pan first. It was quite good, needed a bit of salt and could use more broth. However I used penne pasta, couldn't find orzo, and I used 1.5 cups (recipe would have been 3 cups) and this was quite a bit of pasta, I could have used less but the shape of penne takes a lot of room. I also used a third of a pack of frozen spinach, which was perfect.

I have been making this recipe since March 2008 when I found it here. I followed the recipe except that when making the meatballs I added more seasonings. I used garlic powder, a little seasoned salt, and roasted garlic seasoning plus what the recipe called for. I also added crushed garlic and finely chopped onions to the broth. I read reviews that were complaining about the soup being bland and they had cooked the meatballs seperately. Well you threw away all the flavor. The meatballs MUST be cooked in the broth, it makes all the difference. Also, if you use a ground meat with little to no fat you won't have the same flavor because that is where is comes from. I use most generally 85% ground beef. I have been asked for my recipe from so many people I lost count and am always asked to bring it to events. I would give this more than 5 stars if I could!

I love soup, and after making my own, I will never be able to eat the stuff from a can again!  This soup was excellent!  Based upon other reviews, I doubled the meat so I'd have a lot of meatballs, and added extra broth.  I tried browning the meatballs before tossing them in with everything else, but may not do that next time (just to compare).  I never measure veggies that I cut up for soup, and probably ended up with more than the recipe called for.  Really didn't change much: some garlic and onion powder in the meatball mix, and a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper added to the broth.  I have already made this twice, and plan on making it frequently in the future!

This is one recipe I wish I hadn't followed the advice of fellow reviewers!  Per prior reviewers, I used 1 lb ground beef and made the mini meatballs using my favorite meatloaf/ball recipe (minced onion, italian seasonings, garlic salt, worchestshire sauce, milk, egg, bread crumbs), used 8 cans of broth (7 chicken, 1 beef), 2 bags of spinach (1 baby, 1 regular), shredded carrots, and 1 C ancini de pepe pasta.  The soup tastes great, but I realized I actually prefer a blander Italian Wedding Soup.   I will make again, but this time I will follow the original recipe w/a blander meatball and all chicken broth.  I will also use more spinach next time (and chop it before adding it to the soup).  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband actually said this was good before I even asked! As other reviewers recommended, I added beef stock, sauteed the carrots with onion beforehand, and browned the meatballs first (I cheated and used frozen meatballs). I also cut the orzo to 3/4 cup partly because that's all I had and partly because I added more stock to the soup after throwing in a couple of potatoes in the beginning. The potatoes may not be traditional for the soup, but they were lurking in my fridge. 
Thank you so much for sharing! This was the taste I've been looking for for a long time. Now I know that green stuff in the soup I loved so much is escarole!

This recipe is very close to what my Italian grandma makes. I add one more thing, just like grandma: just minutes before you serve the soup, beat a couple of eggs w/ some grated parmesan, and then whisk mixture into the soup. This makes it a bit more flavorful and rich.

This recipe was a HIT with my church!  I scaled the recipe to 150 servings and made it 2 days in advance, saving the pasta for right before we served the soup.

Instead of using broth, I bought jars of base.  Worked out perfectly.  We made the meatballs with a melon baller for uniformity.  I eyeballed a lot of stuff at the end since I had a hard time with the scaling but it came out so good and a week later people are still talking about it!

And I gave 100% of the credit to allrecipes.com!

Excellent!  I used acini di pepe pasta instead of orzo for a more traditional soup, and frozen chopped spinach instead of escarole.  This is definitely a keeper and so easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great authentic recipe.  I go heavy on the grated cheese, adding romano cheese too.  Prior to serving, add a lightly beaten egg to soup.  The extra egg and cheese boosts the flavor and nutritional value.

I might be partial to this, but I wanted to let you all know that this soup (If prepared correctly) is the best I've seen yet.  And I'm sure there are better ones out there now.  But as for me I give this soup , TWO Thumbs-Up!

This soup was excellent.  Modified the recipe by using Acini de Pepe and omitted the carrots.  Had to add some more Chicken Broth after the pasta absorbed the original 6 cups.  Very Good!!  Defintely will make again.

I have made this soup many many times and my family loves it! The only thing i would recommend is to stick to the recipe as far as the instructions go. Some people here recommend BAKING the meatballs thus effectively removing any beef flavor from the soup and then ADDING beef broth! If you cook your meatballs in the soup you will get that beef flavor as they release the flavor when they cook. Also, I add 1/2 cup of pasta and cook it in the soup. I does absorb the liquid somewhat but i like that "cooked in the broth" flavor of my pasta. I just turn the soup off after about 5 minutes of cooking when the pasta is not done yet. After it sits for 10-15 minutes, it gets done but not mushy.

The soup was a hit!  everyone loved it and wants the recipe!! Ended up following everyone's suggestions
1.  used 6 cups chicken broth and i cup beef broth
2. for the meatballs used half pork and half beef and also cooked them before i put them in the soup
3.  only used 1/2 cup of stelline pasta and cooked it before putting in the soup
4.  ended up cooking on low in my dutch oven for about 5 hours to really build the flavor

Yum! This is simply fantastic. I must admit, I did not anticipate this to be as good as it actually was. I expected a decent soup, but what my hubs and I ate tonight far exceeded that. Fall weather is finally here (the temp dropped from the high 70's to the low 60's overnight). Steaming bowls of soup warmed us up on this chilly day. :) To be fair, I must disclose that I made several changes, some to suit my / our tastes and one completely by accident. Because I mistakenly thawed ground chicken, I used that instead of beef. I also upped the breadcrumbs / cheese by a couple T due to my mixture being too mushy to form meatballs (with my change, I had no problems). I added a 14.5 oz. can of beef broth since many reviews susggested it gave this soup the "oomph" it seemed to be lacking. I also added a couple of sliced green onions because I had them on hand. My final change was to sub acini di pepe pasta for orzo and boil it separately, then add to our soup - and I'm glad I did. NOTE: There is no need to bake or brown your MB's first. My hubs usually comments when I skip this step, but he and I both agreed that this was just not necessary. Served with a crusty loaf of Italian bread, this was a delicious and simple meal. Thanks for sharing Star! :-)

We thought this soup was pretty good, but the meatballs were tasteless.  They definitely would have benefitted from some salt and maybe some garlic.  The parmesan flavor wasn't noticeable at all (and I used grated reggiano parmesan) and I think I'd add more of that the next time.  I substituted fresh spinach for the escarole because that's what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Really delicious soup! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked the mini-meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet for around 18 minutes at 375 degrees. I'm glad I did - I can't imagine the texture of the meatballs had I boiled them with the broth. I used two boxes of chicken broth and about 1/2 can beef broth (8 cups total?). I served the soup with sourdough bread, which was excellent for dipping!

I am really enjoying this soup.  I doubled the recipe, but did not double the orzo.  Also, I used homemade beef broth in place of the chicken broth and I did bake my meatballs (400 degrees for ~15 minutes) and just added them to the soup at the end.

It is a common misconception that this is a soup traditionally served at Italian weddings.  It actually gets its name from the "marriage" of leafy vegetables and meat.

I look forward to trying this recipe, which looks delicious.

Definitely cut down on the amount of Orzo pasta called for.....and DO cook the pasta separately....otherwise it easily overcooks and soaks up a lot of the liquid in the soup pot.  Otherwise a very good recipe

It was good soup, but after all the work of making meatballs and pasta, what I really wanted was spaghetti and meatballs, not soup.  Too much labor when other soups are just as good but less work.

Not quite as good as some that I've had, but good nonetheless and very easy to make. I did modify the recipe a bit, following a combination of suggestions from other reviewers. I baked the meatballs at 350 for about 15 minutes and cooked the orzo separately. I then sauted some garlic, onion and the carrots in olive oil before adding the stock and all the other ingredients. Got lots of compliments!

I used spinach instead of escarole, pre-cooked the meatballs in a frying pan until golden brown, and then threw everything in the slow cooker to simmer. Delicious!

My husband said I got this soup bang on.  Used extra lean ground turkey for the meatballs and raw minced onion instead of onion powder.  To soak up the extra liquid, I added probably a 1/2 cup breadcrumbs.  I rolled the meatballs to 1/3" size for our toddler. As others suggested, I increased the amount of diced carrots to two large carrots and added 2 stalks diced celery and green onion.  The stock was homemade beef and chicken split 50-50.  I used baby spinach instead of escarole and poured the soup over rice since we didn't have pasta.  This was quick to make, comforting, and tasty.

I made this pretty much a stated in the recipe.  Hard to rate it if you totally changing it around.  the only thing I did different was substituting Italian seasoning in the meatballs for the dried basil, which I didn't have.  I added the orzo right to the soup as stated and it did not change the broth one bit.  It is still a nice clear thin broth.  I love this soup and will make it again.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I used a different herb in the meatballs.

This was a great soup!  I have always tried the canned versions from grocery stores.  Fresh and homemade always wins out.  I found using fresh basil, coarsely chopped, works nicely.

Just to clear up any confusion, the origin of the name in fact has nothing to do with Italian weddings: the term 'wedding soup' is a mistranslation of the Italian language, minestra maritata, which is a reference to the fact that green vegetables and meats go well together.

Very good soup!  This is very similar to my recipe for Italian Wedding soup, but I like these meatballs better, although I did substitute ground turkey.  To those who found it a little bland - do not pre-cook the meatballs.  Let them cook in the boiling soup and then the spices will season the broth.  I make my meatballs smaller using about 1 tsp. per meatball and I use acini de pepi pasta (tiny ball shape) instead of the orzo.  Sometimes I just use ground pork sausage for the meatballs wehn I am in a hurry.

I also added a chopped onion and sauteed it with the carrots in olive oil at the start.   Added the broth (low sodium) - 3 cans of chicken, 1 of beef.  Initially found the meatballs to be bland.  Next time I made  it I squeezed the pork mixture out of the casings - used sweet italian sausage - and formed it into meatballs.  Browned the meatballs before adding to the soup.  Also cooked the pasta before adding - 1/2 cup acini di pepe - and added at the end.  Just perfect and lesss time-consuming.

FANTASTIC! One of the best soup recipes that I have tried on this website. I substituted spinach in place of the escarole, rice instead of the orzo pasta and reduced the liquid while cooking, since I don't like too much in my soups.

My husband and I fell in love with Italian Wedding Soup made at a place in Florida called Doubles.  This was very close to that same recipe!  I did as the other raters suggested and used less pasta and more broth. The orzo absorbed all of the broth the next day (leftovers).  Next time I will add about 7-8 cups of broth (6 cups chicken and 2 cups beef) and more carrots.  Celery would also be a great addition.  Overall, this is a wonderful recipe!

yummm...talk about comfort food! Who doesn't love meatballs?  And soup with meatballs - fabuloso! It's not quite a 5 star meal but a darn good regular family meal. That being said I did a few things different.  I baked my meatballs a little first - I was too scared to just throw them in, I was sure I would stir the pot and end up with one big meatball stuck to the spoon.  This also helped get rid of the excess fat.  I fried some onions and celery in the soup pan then added the stock just because that's the way mamma always started a soup. Sheer yumminess will add to my box =)
Oh...one more thing, I noticed some of you reviewers added wisked eggs to the soup and I figured what the heck and gave it a try...it ended up looking like little bits of shredded egg, kinda weird, what's your secret to the eggs??

This was fantastic! Changes: I baked the meatballs at 350, covered, for 20 minutes before adding them to the soup, used bagged baby spinach instead of the escarole, and some tiny pasta in place of the orzo, as I couldn't find any. This is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again. Thank you!

This was really good!  Unfortuately, I forgot to add the orzo, but it was still really good. I will make again with the orzo. I also browned my meatballs before i added them to the soup.  I did not add the escarole either; when I got to the store and saw what it looked like, I was not too sure about adding a lettuce type veggie to my soup.  I made it with "Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwiches"(from this site).  The combo was awesome together.

This is an excellent soup and so easy.  I do brown the meatballs first in the soup pot, remove them and saute the carrot (personal preference)  I think this step adds flavor to the soup.

Great recipe.  I added a little celery and added escarole at the end and cooked until tender.  I also used ancini di pepe instead of orzo.

If you prepare this in advance you might want to have some extra chicken broth on hand or use a little less pasta.  The pasta really sucks up the broth after it sits in the refrigerator overnight.

I love Italian Wedding Soup. I never made it myself before but this is just so easy. I added some garlic powder to the meatballs, I think they would be fine without it. Also I found this to be a bit salty next time I will use a couple cans of low sodium broth. This is great soup!

I love this soup served at italian restaurants, I also substitued the Escarole with fresh baby spinach leaves, finely chopped. I found that 5 3/4 cups of chicken broth was not quite enough, so I added another 3 cups. I used Acini Di Pepe noodles instead of the orzo pasta, the orzo reminded me too much like white rice.Other then that it has a great taste.

All I can say is "excellent!" 

This soup recipe was awesome.  I took some of the advice of the other reviewers and used spaghetti noodles broken into 3's because that is how the Spaghetti warehouse serves it.  I also brought a pack of that precooked roasted chicken and cut the strips into cubes.  The results were simply awesome.  My son loved it so much that we ate it all in just two days.  The next time I make it I will add a few more cups of broth, because it wasn't enough and I will make a bigger batch so it will last about 3 or 4 days.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for sharing that recipe.

When my aunt's fancy Italian grocery store was out of this soup, I jumped at the opportunity to make such a high-rated recipe. I, too, used the Acine di Pepe and spinach.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly.  Since I had to transport this soup, I cooked the pasta separately and put it into a freezer bag to add when the soup was to be served.  It couldn't have turned out more perfect!  My aunt thought it was better than the Italian store and my Grandmother loved it, too.  My brother even called today to say how impressed he was with this soup.  This was my first time making soup and I WILL be making this again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was excellent!  I just finished this for dinner and I am very satisfied.  Besides the wonderful flavors mixed in the soup, I like the fact that it has your veggies, meat, and carbs all in one dish!  As per another reviewer, I also baked the meatballs at 350 for 25 min., and they came out fine, except I would say to lightly grease the pan you use, as they tend to stick.  You could also get away with baking them a minute or two shorter.  I didn't add these to the soup while cooking, only when served.  THanks for the great recipe!  Oh, and I also used spinach, orzo (half of what's called for), and added garlic powder to the meatballs.

This soup was really good.  I used a little less than 1/2 cup of the pasta after reading all of the reviews and it turned out very good.  I did end up adding some salt and fresh ground pepper for more taste to the broth, but that was just my preference.  I highly recommend putting the parmesan cheese on top before eating.  If you have fresh grated cheese, even better.

This soup is amazing! Packed with flavor and healthy. I use spinach instead of escarole and I cook the orzo separate, then add it in. I've made this 3 times and everyone LOVES it every time.

this is delicous! I made today,because its a rainy day here. 
I have to say this>>it is the same recipe that is  made by Jo marie in " Love letters" by Debbie Macomber ---I  went to her web site and  found the recipe. It has less pasta & I'm glad I use less -- 1/2 cup is enough. I used a mixture of greens,celery & fresh onion -browned my meatballs, then put in  broth with all the other veg.I precooked the  pasta in broth  and added last and added 1 can of beef broth  after reading all the  reviews--   a new favorite to make again!

Excellent recipe. Very healthy. I did take others' recommendations: added celery, cut the orzo to 1/2 c., and used some beef broth. I also cooked the pasta and meatballs separately prior to adding them to the soup. Will definitely make again! Thank you for sharing.

Love this recipe.  It was different than our normal meals which was so nice.  I don't use escarole, I have been using spinach which is great.  Easy to make.  I actually used the mini carrots and quickly chopped those up a bit.

This was a great recipe. I followed other reviews. I doubled it all, but used 1 cup of orzo. sauteed celery, carrots and onions in my soup pot, then added chicken/beef broth.... made the meatballs and baked them for 20 min at 350 then threw them in the brother, made the orzo separate in another pot...and added it all in...was so good!

I used 1 lb of ground turkey instead of beef and I browned the meatballs for a few minutes in a little bit of olive oil before adding in the other ingredients. Also, I would really suggest adding about a tsp of dried thyme to the meatball mixture, it adds a delicious flavor. I also used a handful of finely chopped Swiss Chard because that is what I had growing in my garden. The result was a fantastic soup my family and I, even my two year old, ate for three days!

This is really good. I made a few additions. I added garlic herb powder & half a finely chopped onion to the meat mixture. I browned the meat balls in a little olive oil because I wanted to eliminate the extra grease from the meat to get in the soup. I drained the meatballs on paper towel. I sauteed the other half of the finely chopped onion in a little olive oil, added 1 cup of carrots, added 6 cups of water and 1.5 cubes of bouillon (one chicken and half beef), then I added frozen spinach and let it simmer. I finally added cooked pasta at the end and let it sit for a bit to let the pasta soak some of the flavor. Great recipe.

Good soup! I made as written and agree that it is too much orzo so next time I will decrease and cook separate.  Will also try chicken meatballs rather than the beef.  I used homemade chicken broth and it was very flavorful.

Just to save time I bought Rozzano 1/2 frozen meatballs and cooked them 15 minutes in oven.  I used chicken broth and beef broth.  I also cooked the orzo before adding it to the soup.  The next time I would decrease orzo by 1/2 cup.  Along with the other reviews it is best to make it one day and eat it the next.  It definietly needs to marinate.  Spices used were garlic, onion powder, oregano.  I will be making this again.

This is not what I was hoping for.  Very bland, and if you cook according to directions, the escarole becomes slimy mush.  I don't even want to try to make it better.

Excellent recipe! We made a few alterations: we doubled the meatball recipe and used 1/3 cup grated onions (instead of onion powder). We also added another 2 cups water to the soup. Thanks for sharing this delicious and simple recipe!

Excellent soup. I like more vegies in my soup so I added extra carrots, celery & onions. I made my meatballs with ground Turkey(Less fat) & used Kale and acini di pepe pasta. Got rave reviews at my house. I froze some before adding the pasta, turned out great!

I thought this had very good taste and I loved how easy it was to make.  Great for a cool day.  One modification that I made was to use acini de pepe which are the small round "peppercorn" shaped pasta. I was able to find it in Ronzoni brand at Giant Eagle.

this is a very good soup.  I added a few finely chopped onions to my meatballs rather than the onion powder.

i followed all of the changes that some of you made. i also put the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes like some of you suggested. my soup turned out kind of bland. it just tasted like the chicken broth in the can. maybe next time i won't brown the meatballs first.  will that make a difference? any suggestions anyone?

YUMMY, Fast and very simple to make.  My hubby is 100% Italian and says that this tastes almost like his mom made for him as a boy.  I have made this recipe a few times now and it is always good.  I have tried using pre-made turkey meatballs (for a more weight watchers friendly meal) and it is still 5 stars in my book.

I had some extra fresh spinach in the fridge when I came across this recipe.  My husband has enjoyed it when we attended a wedding a few years ago...so I surprised him with it for dinner (he had 3 bowls).  Your recipe is just like how we remember it at that wedding and it so EASY to make.  The meatballs have a wonderful array of flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This was GREAT soup! I did make a few tweaks. I doubled the meatball portion of this recipe (planned to freeze them for later use, but ended up adding them to the soup), and cooked them in a pan. I did not have onion powder, so I minced a small onion. I used 1/2 in the meatballs, and 1/2 in the broth. I also added some shredded carrot to the meatballs and omitted the cheese. I substituted spinach for escarole, increased the carrot to 1/2 cup and used wheat pasta. I also added about 1/2 cup fresh corn (left over from last night). When I was making the meatballs I was concerned because they were very "wet", but it worked out great. This will definitely be a repeater!

I love the wedding soup that a restaurant here serves, and have been searching everywhere for a recipe. This is it!  Except I omited the carrots and added celery and onion fried in butter.  I also cheated and used half a box of frozen meatballs. EVERYONE loves this soup and begs for the leftovers...a real keeper!

I LOVE this soup! I have made it so many times already. It is very easy and tastes better than almost any other wedding soup I think I've ever had. I have also made it with chicken and it tastes just as wonderful.

I used 7 cups of chicken broth - I also doubled the meat and halved the orzo -- I satueed 1/3 cup of onions and a 1/3 cup of zucchini in a pan w/ chopped garlic and a bit of olive oil and added it to the soup as well, plus 1/3 cup of chopped celery.  Delicious!! My husband loved it!

YUM! This is just like the recipe from my favorite restaurant.  I added more escarole.  An easy  tip for the meatballs is to just use a rounded 1/2 or 1/4 teaspoon measure to scoop out the meatballs.  You'll be finished in no time at all!

I have finally figured out how the reviews work on this site. People don't really seem to rate the main recipe on it's own. They tend to rate the recipe after they have made one or more changes.  With that said, I have never had Italian Wedding soup like this before. I agree that it needs a few changes. First, try using half ground beef and half Italian sausage meat for the tiny meatballs.  Second, don't put carrots in it. Third always put spinach in it. Fourth, don't use Orzo pasta...use the authentic Pastina. Don't use a lot, it is mainly an elegant broth soup and not meant to be  thick. Now this is the most important step that makes it real Italian Wedding Soup....You lightly beat two eggs and while the soup is on a light boil, drizzle the eggs slowly all around the surface. This will create very thin egg noodles as it drops into the hot broth. Remember that Italian soups always taste great when you sprinkle some good Parmesan on top just before you eat it.

Great recipe.  I doubled all the ingredients , read the reviews, and made the following changes.  I baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I also added 1/2 tsp garlic power, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 1 tsp tomato paste,and  1 tsp chopped fresh parsley to the meatballs and used flavored crumbs.    I sauteed 1/2 cup of chopped onion and 1/2 cup of chopped celery along with 1 cup chopped carrots and 2 cloves of minced garlic in 1 T chicken fat and 2 tsps of olive oil and added to broth.  I used spinach instead of escarole and cooked the pasta separately.

this soup was amazing....my boyfriend LOVE IT!!! HUGE HIT
I tweeked a couple of things cuz my mom always taught me to cook with what I already have in the kitchen. 
1. based on reviews I cooked the pasta separately
2. I used 1 package of lean Jennie O turkey vs. beef
3. I made my own stock with chicken bullion (boil water first add bullion then veggies and meatballs)
4. I added a tsp of dried parsley
5. I substituted kale for escarole 

Can't wait to make it again...yummy...definately worth trying

This is delicious.  I cooked the pasta separately, added zuccini and celery and sauteed the veggies in olive oil to bring out the flavor before adding the broth, as some others suggested.  My husband and I both loved it.

As I was preparing this I thought maybe the seasonings in the meatballs would season the broth.  They did not.  I added salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and some chicken bullion to the broth and it was delicious.  I did double the amount of meatballs as well.  My family loved it and it is hard to please them all.

Basically , I like the recipe, but I did change a few things.  First, I cooked 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic in a little oil then added the broth and escarole.   Also, I added salt and pepper to the meatballs and fried them in a couple teaspoons of oil first to get them browned.  They taste alot better when you do that.  Then I added them to the soup.  Also, I agree that the Orzo's need to be cut in 1/2.

This soup was wonderful. Everyone devoured it and asked for more. As per previous reviews, I used ground chicken for the meatballs, and baked them before adding to the soup to reduce grease. Also swapped out orzo in favour of acini de pepe. As others have mentioned, halve the amount of dry pasta (I suspect the original recipe was meant to call for one cup of cooked pasta, rather than uncooked). Will most definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used ASHLEYBEGOOD's suggestions. Used kale instead of escarole and added some shallots (had them on hand) finely diced to the meatballs. Baking them @ 350 for about 15-20 minutes before adding them to the soup cut down on the amount of grease but still gave them enough time to lend their beefy goodness to the soup. I also added a little garlic and herb seasoning towards the end which kicked it up a notch. Will definitely be making it again soon!

This is really good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Only deviations were:  I used beef broth and chicken broth, added some salt and onion flakes, used spinach and added some celery. 
I served it with a nice crusty bread and the family loved it.  As they say, "it is a do-over"

This was excellent!  I took others' advice as well as made substitutions based on what I had available; here are my changes: Added garlic powder to the meatballs, used dried minced onion instead of onion powder and baked them.  Added a clove of garlic, upped the carrots to 1/2 cup, added 2 stalks of celery, used one cup of chicken stock and 6 cups vegetable stock, cut the orzo in half and cooked it separately, added a green onion, sauteed all veggies before adding broth.  I think that's it.  It was soo good!  Love this soup!

Went with the the other reviewers suggestion of turkey for the meatballs and adding more carrot. 

Worth the extra time it took to brown and cook the meatballs, added more flavor and less fatty. Also precooked the noodles as I wasn't in a rush. Tastier the next day!

Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews!

Was Delicious and definitely browned the meatballs first.  Also used old fasioned oats instead of bread crumbs because I can't have wheat.  Used turkey broth and ground turkey and it was fabulous.  Great Recipe!

Very good. I used spinach as my green though as that's what I'm used to in this soup. Be careful if not serving immediately though, because those little orzos will suck up all the broth if stored.

This soup is amazing!  I used ground chicken instead of beef.  Also topped with locatelli cheese and put some in the meat.  Also, added a can of beef broth per another reviewer.  My market didn't have escarole, so I just used spinach and it was great.  Perfect with those small changes!

I've always wanted to find a great meatball recipe as well as wedding soup. My search is over! The meatballs turned out tender (I used 1.5lb of beef and 1/2 lb of pork). Turned out great!

Excellent recipe.  My only changes are that I use spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef and spinach instead of escarole.  This soup is one of my favorite meals!

Yummy in my Tummy! I made this in a crock pot for a soup themed pot luck. My friend's 5yr old girl had 2 bowls. I was amazed! I make the meatballs with ground turkey sausage, because it gives the meatballs a different flavor & texture. Like other reviews I boiled the orzo seperately, and added a can of beef broth for a hearty flavor.

Made this for a soup supper at work. I had high hopes, so I tripled the recipe.  Out of four soups presented, this is the only one that emptied the crock TWICE.  It was also the only one my coworkers fought over in taking the leftovers (I tripled it, remember?) home. Good stuff!  What I did differently because of what I had on hand: 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 beef, and fresh spinach instead of escarole.

Very good base recipe. Being a dietitian, I like more vegetables so I added more carrots, celery, subbed bok choy instead and used others advice to only add 1/2 cup cooked orzo.  Do cook orzo seperately.  Also added a bay leaf in for another dimension of flavor. Soup was better the 2nd and 3rd time so definately make extra.

Great recipe! Per other reviews this is what I did: browned meatballs in olive oil and used turkey instead of ground beef, added celery, and only used about 1/3 of the orzo pasta.  I waited until just before serving to add the pasta and just cooked it in the soup.  That worked out great since I was done simmering it.  Thanks for the recipe and all the suggestions!

Tasted like the the soup we get from our local Italian restaurant. I made my own chicken stock (with onions and celery) with some added Swanson broth. I added a can of beef broth (made a big difference). The meatballs really need to cook in the broth -it adds flavor (use lean meat as recipe calls for). I used frozen chopped spinach. Cooked acini di pepe separate. It's a keeper!!!       UPDATE:  I make this quite a bit and found that after making the acini di pepe, I drain it, place it in a bowl and ad several serving spoons of the broth.  Once cooled you can add the pasta you need and it shouldn't soak up much broth.  Any left, store and add later.

This was a hit! I made it in the crock-pot so I did have to make a few changes that worked out well. I made the meatballs the night before, doubling everything except the egg. Baked them in a 9x13, uncovered, in a 350 oven for 30-45 minutes in the morning. I also cooked the orzo in the morning. In the crock I put a quart and a small can of chicken broth, with celery, onion and carrots, a box of chopped frozen spinich and oragano, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. This cooked on low all day. When I got home from work I put the orzo in the crock and stired till loose, added the meatballs till warmed. I made this to celebrate my BF's first time voting!! He loved it! We cant wait for leftovers tonight. This is a special soup and is worth a little TLC.

This is my first time trying Italian Wedding Soup.  I have always wanted to try it although I am more of a chowder person.  It was good.  I did not have spinach and with a 4 year old and a 1 year old, I thought that would freak them out, so that is the only thing I left out.  I also doubled the meatballs thinking the kids would like them, but they mainly ate the broth and noodles....and lots of it.  I kept adding more orzo thinking it didn't look like enough, but in the end I needed to add more broth.  It was a good soup, but not my favorite kind.  Next I will be making a clam chowder!

Delicious! I doubled the meat so I could freeze some and see how they tasted in spagetti later on down the road. I only had italian style bread crumbs so I ommitted the basil and onion powder in the meat so they wouldn't be too powerful. I did add the spices to the boulion for fear the soup would be bland. I used frozen spinach and a little more than a 1/3 of a cup of frozen carrot/pea mix (all i had on hand). I also didn't have any orzo so I used macaroni noodles. My 19 month old is going through a picky stage with all his veggies but ate his whole bowl gone! *UPDATE* Ok so I made this last night and it was delicious! I made the meatballs with groud turkey. When I made the chicken stock I added the spices to the stock along with about a 1 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Instead of orzo I used alphabet noodles which are small like orzo and fun for my kids. I drained frozen spinach this time which made the soup that much better because there wasn't an overwhelming spinach taste or look since the soup wasn't green...lol. Perfect!

I make this soup a lot around the holidays.  My in-laws (who are very picky) love this soup despite the fact that most of them hate green vegetables.
Tastes even better when you float half a stick of pepperoni on top.

Very yummy! I brought it to a pot luck at work. I cooked it the night before, undercooking it slightly. Then I just turned it on high in my crock pot in my office letting it simmer all morning. By lunch it was perfect!

This was very good, even my 3 y.o. ate it! I used fresh breadcrumbs and added some oregano and basil to the meatballs. I also substituted collard greens for the escarole b/c I couldn't find it in the store.

This recipe is really nice, you can make any kind of adjustments. I used pork sausage in my meatball mixture and used a little more garlic and bread crumbs. I also boiled the orzo separately with salted water, then rinsed with cold water to stop the cooking process. I added the orzo 5 minutes before serving and I did not loose any of the broth and it was even better the next day! Enjoy!

I substituted ground turkey for the lean ground beef and added some minced fresh onion to the mix -- I actually like the flavor better and it made it healthier.  In my area, this soup is usually made with ancini de pepi noodles (teeny, tiny ones)  I also used fresh leaf spinach instead of the escarole.

I've made Wedding Soup before - but this recipe beats them all!  I doubled the recipe and used a combo of ground beef, pork and veal for the meatballs.  I also sauteed onions and carrots in olive oil before adding the broth to the pot.  This has a great taste and is a definate keeper!

Absolutely delicious! Just be sure to have extra chicken broth on hand (or use less pasta), as the orzo pasta absorbs a lot of the broth.

This was good, but you need more chicken broth, for sure. I pre cooked the acini de pepe, (1/2 cup instead of the full 1 cup) so once added to the chicken broth, it didn't absorb much of the liquid. However, I believe I used too much spinach (I couldn't find escarole anywhere.) I left the carrots out, since I didn't have any on hand. Next time, I'll use more broth, and less spinach. Overall, a very good recipe.

This was my first time making wedding soup.  It turned out fairly well.  I did change the recipe just a bit--I used spinach and also cooked a few chicken thighs in water, and added some of the water after cooking and shredded the chicken to add to the soup.  I started making the meatballs and realized we were out of parmesan cheese, so the next time I make the soup, I will be sure to have everything on hand.  Because of my mistake, I thought the meatballs to be a bit bland.  Other than that, I was pleased!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I took others advice and cut the orzo by half.  I also added a bit of FINELY chopped onion.  I used spinach, because I love it in my soup.  The meat balls were amazing, my family swears I went out and purchased this from an Italian resturant.  Even my 5 year old had another bowl.  This is a keeper and will be great this winter.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made with ground beef but next time would use 1/2 beef abd 1/2 ground pork. I also used frozen spinach and I would only use 1/2 the amount of pasta called for like a previous reviewer mentioned. I would like to make this soup again. Good recipe but I will try another one to see how it compares.

This is a great base to start with--you add or subtract for your own personal tastes!! I use half chicken broth and half beef--it seems to add the certain something that other reviewers thought was lacking. I also add about 1/4 cup chopped onion and 1 shredded chicken breast. The only other change I made was to use turkey meatballs (I browned them first) and pre-cooked the acini de pepe. Thanks Star!!

Wow! Excellent soup.  I did take other suggestions: browned the meatballs, decreased orzo, used spinach instead of escarole, and used italian bread crumbs.  This is definitely a keeper!

It was a nice soup with many flavors.Though , as I learned ,it does not make good leftovers,the orozo turns to mush . . . maybe the pasta/Orozo can be cooked separatley in broth.

This is a superb recipe. I've made this soup several times: the first time, I used too much orzo, which sucked up all the broth--a little disconcerting, to say the least.  Every other time I've made it, I've added cooked cheese tortoleni right before serving. EVERYONE loves this soup. A great find.  Thanks for posting.

Very good soup, however I found it really needed salt - both in the meatballs and in the broth.  Next time I will definitely add salt and pepper especially to the meatballs because the rest of the soup can always be salted to taste after it's cooked. I also added a lot more chicken broth because the amount of pasta called for was overpowering - it was more like a pasta dish than soup!

Maybe it's because I had never had Italian Wedding soup before, but this soup just didn't do it for me.  I had high hopes with all the great reviews, but personally I thought it was just O.K., nothing to write home about.  I used all the suggestions from other reviewers, maybe I tweaked it too much! My husband ate it, but had no comment either way, which basically means he didn't care for it either.

I had this soup at a restaurant called Eastside Marios and loved it. This recipe is very similar. I now make it all the time but I do not add all the ingredients into the meatballs. I just buy ground pork, roll small balls and then freeze them on a cookie sheet. I divided them into soup serving sizes and freeze them in freezer bags to be used later on. This is a great and easy recipe. P.S. I used thinly sliced spinach instead.

The entire family liked this soup.  It is a bit of work but worth it.  If you freeze and reheat it, it still tastes great except that the orzo gets a little too puffy and "overcooked"----not that it stops us from eating it and enjoying!

Instead of making meatballs for this soup as we have done in the past.... we doubled the serving size and used ground veal that was sauteed with finely minced onions, carrots, celery and freshly roasted garlic.  This is a really good base recipe if you are a experienced cook and know how to mix the right seasonings.  You do not HAVE TO HAVE meatballs for this type of soup.  It is just extra work.  Try using a mixture of ground beef and lightly seasoned ground sausage or a mixture of ground pork and ground beef.  Experiment a little.

So easy with ingredients on hand.  Although my daughter didn't like the meatballs, the rest of us really enjoyed this with garlic breadsticks.  Very hearty and filling.  Needed an extra can of broth to make it more soupy. And try to make meatballs small to cook through fast.

I just made this soup and it was great.  My family loved it.  I took the suggestions of some of the others and boiled the noodles before adding them, I added fresh crushed garlic to the meat mixtute and just kind of seasoned the broth to taste.  I was very easy. I will never buy Market Day Wedding soup again!  Thanks Star Pooley for submitting this great recipe.

After trying several delicious offerings of this dish at various local restaurants, I decided to try making it at home as part of our Christmas dinner.  This recipe looked to be closest to what I have eaten in the past.  The only major difference was the amount of escarole, which seems to be much greater in this recipe.  Also, I used "acini de pepe" (bead-shaped) pasta rather than orzo.  Nevertheless, the soup was a hit, especially with my Italian grandmother who had never tried it before.  My grandparents were delighted when I offered them the rest of the soup to take home with them.

This soup is easy and delicious. I can't ever get my kids to eat greens but they do in this soup.
Instead of escarole I use fresh cut-up or frozen cut-up spinach. I make 2 lbs of the meatballs instead of 1/2 and I freeze the rest in small bags of 50-60 balls. This makes this soup even quicker and easier to make. I also sometimes use acini pepe instead of orzo.

I followed this recipe but was very disappointed in the meatballs.  The broth was delicious but the meatballs lacked flavor.  Will definitely make again but change the meat recipe portion.

This recipe was awesome!! I made it for my parents one evening and ended up making it for 42 people for Christmas!! I would have to agree that the original amount of Orzo is way too much. I have actually been making mine with Acini De PePe and everybody likes it much better.

Although Rhode Island based, this soup was just as tasty made in New Hampshire.  We really enjoyed it...and surely will make it again.

This was fantastic.  I substitued some of the chicken broth with onion seasoned beef broth, my husband said he has never tasted better wedding soup.

On the whole this recipe is an excellent example of 
Italian homestyle cooking.  I had to rate its 
quickness and easiness factors as average since 
I think the author underestimated the time it
takes to form the meatballs.  Plus the escarole
is pretty sandy and needs to be thoroughly
rinsed. 

A suggestion:  don't dice the carrots.  Rather 
cut them into 1/2 inch thick rounds.  That will
prevent them from overcooking and becoming mushy.

Incidentally, I prepared the recipe using cubed boneless,
skinless chicken breast and substituted quick 
cooking barley for the orzo.  Try it!  You'll like it!

Pretty tasty!  I followed the advice and cooked the orzo separately, then added it to the bowls prior to serving.  Also, I thawed some frozen precooked meatballs and cut them in quarters to add to the soup,making it even easier!  This is going into the recipe rotation!

Good soup, but if you're not planning to eat it right away, or plan to save some for another time, DO NOT add orzo to the soup itself.  Cook separatly, as they have a tendancy to soak up all the liquid and become too large.

This is very similar to the way my mom and I make it for almost every holiday ... my daughters (5&6) love to help the weekend before by making and freezing the meatballs.  I have one change, though, and it answers the person who says that there is too much orzo:  bring your pasta to a boil in a separate pot and cook it there, then rinse it numerous times.  This will get rid of that bit of foam that can sit on the top of your soup (QUITE unattractive!) and you can add the amount that you deem necessary.  BTW:  I would NEVER use spinach - we are a SERIOUS escarole family!

I recently made this alittle quicker to make by doubling the meatballs and freezing half of them for the next serving.  
This is Italian Wedding Soup I remember my grandmother making.  I've been searching for this recipe for a long time as my grandmother passed away when I was a little girl.  Thanks for putting it out there Star.

I couldn't fine escarole so I substituted mustard greens and ground chicken for the ground beef.  Great taste. I added salt before serving. 
Easy and delicious. My husband said I can make it anytime!

I followed some of the advice previously posted here, using just 1/2 c. orzo pasta was plenty, cooked separately and added at the end. I used turkey instead of beef, 1/2 cup carrots and frozen spinach. Delicious, quick and simple even my picky family loved it!

The soup was very tasty! SO much better than canned. I did as some others have suggested and cooked the orzo first. I also used spinach because I could not get the escarole at my local stores. For the meatballs, I used 1 lb of hamburger, italian seasoned bread crumbs, and doubled the seasonings accordingly. I also browned them in the soup pot I used prior to adding the broth. Just brown, remove the meatballs, drain away the grease and add the broth, then continue as per the instructions. The flavor from the meatballs really made the broth stand up to the rest of the flavors in the soup!

This is a great version, and very fast. Next time, though, I will need to quadruple the recipe, it doesn’t make much. And no garlic in an Italian soup? I will sauté some garlic in olive oil first, then add the broth to boil, etc. Also, the meatballs took more like 10-12 minutes to turn brown.  I may also add a cube of pesto (I make a ton of it every summer and freeze it in ice cube trays). Parmesan cheese on top is a must, too. Great for a crowd, who wouldn’t like this?

This is a very authentic recipe, but I did make a couple of changes regarding my preferences. As I have spinach, swiss chard, in my garden I used that instead of escarole, and acini di pepe pasta instead of orzo. the acini holds up better, and I did add at end after boiling separately. I also browned the meatballs a bit b4 adding to broth, just to cook out excess fat. But all in all great recipe. thanks!

This is delicious and I'd make it again though it's not one of my favourites. Maybe I just don't like Italian Wedding soup that much.
I made the following changes going by other reviewers suggestions and my own intuition; I more than doubled the recipe (which made a bit 'too much' soup) and added about 4 stalks of diced celery, 2 diced white onions, and about 6 peeled and diced carrots. I added some salt to the meatballs and formed them smaller before cooking them separately in a cast iron pan with olive oil. I also sauted the veggies (minus the greens) with salt, aproxx. 1 tbsp oregano, pepper, basil and about 4 cloves minced garlic in olive oil before adding them to the soup. Finally I swapped out the escarole for spinach, left out the parmesan cheese and subbed the orzo for resini, cooking the pasta separately.
The meatballs were oily so next time I might bake them. I also think that chicken meatballs may have taste better in this recipe. Ideally, let this soup sit for 2-3hrs or even overnight to let the flavours develop.

The soup was very good and easy to make. Slightly greasy from cooking the meatballs in the soup. May consider cooking the meatball partially separately and discarding the oil.

I use ground turkey for the meatballs instead of beef. I also double the amount of meatballs and double the amount of broth. I also use 1/2 a bag of shredded carrots to save on time and a I throw in a whole bag of cleaned and cut escarole (Wegman's has this in their produce section). I grate some fresh parmesan onto the top of each soup bowl just prior to eating. I have been making this recipe for years but only now realized I never rated it.

I would have given it 5/5 stars, but I slightly changed it.  I ended up using beef broth, because I was using beef to make the meatballs.  I also added some celery, onion, and garlic.  It is a great soup!

Very nice and light, I did a twist and added just one egg white in small drops at the very end of the soup cooking while stirring. My husband's family used to make it that way and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this soup again very soon!!

This was great starting point, I altered a couple of things, used Kale instead of Spinach, put pesto in meat balls instead of spices, this was quick and easy, and pre cooked Gluten free pasta and used instead of regular. Yummy.

This is an incredibly easy soup to make. I tripled it to make extra for our neighbor and daughters. I used ground pork and chicken, instead of beef, and followed another's advice to cook orzo separately. Tastes wonderful and serving it with bread recipe from all recipes.

What a winner !!!  This was a great soup. Only difference from the recipe was using spinach vs escarole.  Like any good soup, tastes better the day after.

very good soup, however, my meatballs did not stay together.  Way better than canned, but something just a little missing. too much orzo relative to everything else.

Very good recipe as is! I recommend browning the meatballs in a pan first to avoid extra grease. Also, I made it for 8 servings so I used 1.5lbs of beef and 12 cups of chicken broth. No need for beef broth if you add salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder. I also used mini cheese tortellini but that was just a personal preference! Delish!

Made this for a family in grief about recent loss of a family member. I wanted comfort food that they maybe hadn't already gotten 100 times. It was delish and they loved it. It made me so happy to know for a moment, at least, they felt happiness--a wonderful, comforting soup!

I applied a number of adjustments recommended: reduced the amount of pasta & cooked it separately, used frozen spinach, added celery.  Rather than being unkosher and mixing beef and chicken, I used vegetable broth and added the extra beef broth to provide a fuller flavor and served with a sprinkle of shredded parm.  These being tough economic times, I doubled the recipe and got about 12 servings in all.  This is definitely a filling, one-pot meal but if you can, serve it with a nice crusty bread.

Would not make this again.  It was a lot of work, dirtied a lot of dishes and wasn't worth the effort.  It was bland and not very appetizing.  I used recommendations by other reviewers to cook the orzo separately and reduce to it 1/2 c. otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T".  I do not recommend this soup.

Really great base for a soup, however it lacks a depth of flavor. I doubled the amount of meatballs, and bumped up portions of everything else. I also used a mix of chicken and beef broth that added some nice flavor. Kale worked instead of endive and was still delicious--it was what I had on hand, and it's really good for you. The broth is going to need more seasoning than just the meatballs--prepare to add salt, pepper, and oregano/basil/garlic. Next time, I think I'll sautée some garlic and onion before adding the broth. Also, some people have said cook the meatballs before to get some of the fat out--I did this, and I think it was a mistake. A lot of the flavor of the soup comes from the meat, so cooking the meatballs in the broth may add that depth that was missing the first time around. Plus, if you use lean ground beef, the amount of fat shouldn't be an issue. (Authentic Italian Wedding soup has an oily texture because of this.) Overall, though, it's a very tweakable soup, and I'll definitely experiment with it more.

This is the first time I've made this and it is definately one I will be making again. I baked the meatballs in the oven first, and cooked the pasta before adding it to soup. I added Italian bread with garlic and had a wonderful dinner. I also made enough for leftovers. One can never have too much soup in the fall and winter. Wonderful recipie

Delicious recipe. I make large amounts and freeze for later, because it is that delicious! My changes: 1 lb turkey for meatballs and follow everyone's suggestion at baking then separate so the soup does not have too much fat. Keep the ingredients of meatballs the same. Use spinach instead of escarole (and I use a WHOLE bag). I use a whole box of Orzo pasta. Also add 1-2 cups of beef broth for that extra kick everyone talks about. Delicious. Have made it 5-6 times since finding this recipe a month ago!

This was good for a first attempt.  I made it according to the recipe, except used spinach as they didn't have escarole at the grocery store.  Next time I will bake the meatballs to brown them up a little better.  They were kind of grey and unappealing, but tasted good.

Yummy soup, a little plain though. Next time i will do what another reviewer did and sautee onioms and garlic in pot before adding broth. Will also brown the balls. I used chicken stock instead of broth and skipped the Orzo since it doesn't really add much taste or nutrition. Used grass fed beef for the balls and panko for the breading.

Only giving this a 4 because Changed it signigicantly.  I use pork and beef, escorole and spinache, added fresh garlic and onion to the broth and a few other things to taste.  I also used Pastina pasta because they will not swell like the orzo pasta.  Don't be afraid NOT to follow the recipe to a T. Taste as you go and add what you like as needed.

For those who are having problems with the Orzo absorbing all the liquid, I left out a cup of broth during cooking, and then poured in the room-temperature broth at the end of cooking to keep the pasta al dente. Doesn't fix it completely but certainly makes it last longer.

I made this soup for my boyfriend who has always loved Italian Wedding soup. I used Kale instead of Escarole (because that's all I could find), and left the carrots out. The soup was extremely hearty and delicious, and he even commented that I should make this for his mom some time! A delicious, quick, and easy meal.

Excellent, family said it was the best soup they have ever had.   Few changes, used 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup beef broth.  Also browned meatballs first and added garlic.  Great flavor, will add to rotation - thank you!

I made some changes to the recipe after reading other peoples comments. I upped the amount of carrots to 1/2 a cup (which I still think wasn't enough) and added celery and onions. I also sauteed the veggies in a bit of olive oil before I added the broth to the pot. I browned the meat balls in a separate pan before cooking in the broth and added garlic to the mixture instead of onion powder. Finally, I cooked the pasta before adding it to the soup, and  I cut the orzo pasta down to 1/2 a cup since so many reviews said there was too much pasta with following the recipe at a full cup. I wish I hadn't since I felt it needed more pasta. Overall a very quick and simple soup that is quite hearty.

Delicious! I did use 6 cups chicken broth, 1 cup beef broth and cooked the pasta separately. Next time I wouldn't use quite as much pasta, but that's my only (tiny) complaint. The meatballs had great flavor and texture. YUM! Thanks :)

Great recipe. It's one of my husband's new favorites. Pretty easy to make. I've made this at least a dozen times; I always add more carrots and escarole to make it even healthier and substitute 1/2 the chicken broth for beef broth for extra flavor. To make this even easier use frozen mini-meatballs and pulse your carrots in the food processor.

Very yummy soup. After reading the reviews, I did make a few changes: I added a cup of beef broth, reduced the orzo to 3/4 of a cup and replaced the escarole with spinach (this because I couldn't find escarole). I would suggest making sure to cook the meatballs in the soup like the recipe says - it adds a lot flavour to the broth. If you use extra-lean GB, it won't make the soup greasy.

This was my very first attempt to make this soup. Just a hint, my local store did not have escarole, so I used Kale(Same thing?). I also chopped it small instead of having strips of slimy green floatys. Much better that way.I am confused why people cooked the meatballs seperate. It is not like they were greasy..I used LEAN ground beef(recipe calls for xtra lean) and I put one medium sized chicken breast in the food processor to make my own ground chicken.I mixed them together and made small meatballs. Thats what they are suppose to be... small.The amout of pasta in this is WAY too much. you will end up with hardly any broth. Me and my boyfriend were fighting over it. LOL!Use half the pasta as others have stated. I was surprised how flavorfull it was with no onions and celery. I think it is even better the next day. Enjoy. I will make it again for sure!

I put in 6 cans of chicken broth and I could add another to have it more brothy, but I like less broth in my soups.

Really delicious! My family loved it and my kids even said they loved all the veggies in it! I used spinach and added more broth. I also cooked the pasta separately as many people suggested. I sauted some onion and celery with the carrots first. I cooked the meatballs in the soup as the recipe says and we didn't find the soup to greasy at all. This soup came together in about 30 minutes and was a hit with the whole family. I'll definitely make it again!

Wonderful! I always make wedding soup from scratch.( boil chicken to make broth with onion carrots,celery and tomato's.) My daughter had the flu and my Grandmother always had soup in the freezer for when you were sick she called Italian Peniciliin. So in a hurry I used this recipe. Loved it. The only changes I made was I doubled the meatballs because its the kids favorite part. I did add the beef broth and I added more escarole. Threw some left over chicken I had in the fridge. Added garlic to the meatballs and put the meatballs in a preheated 350 oven for 10 min. to get the greese off. Thanks so much for the " Italian Penicillin ;)

Delicious. I added diced onion and spinach instead of escarole. I always add a bit of better than bouillon soup base to all my soups to make broth richer. I ate two bowls!

First time review, long time lurker.  The soup is a hit here.   Changes that worked for us: I used more cheese (about 1/4 cup), and fresh basil (about 3 TBSP).   I cooked the orzo seperately, cooled it al dente, tossed it with about a tsp of olive oil, and add it to the individual bowls before pouring soup. I browned the meatballs seperately, and then placed then in paper towels to soak up oil.  The store didnt have escarole, so the clerk pointed me to swiss chard.  It was a perfect substitute.  The most important part, i think, is to cook the pasta seperately.  I tried a chicken soup recipe last month, and was really sad at how mushy the noodles got for repeated eatings.  Keeping the orzo seperate here really made them stay in shape.  No clumping, either, with the oil applied after cooking.  this one's a keeper!

I followed a lot of the reviewers suggestions and did my meatballs in a saute pan before hand and cooked the pasta seperately.  I couldn't find escarole at the store so I used some other leafy looking green and it didn't seem to make a difference.  This was a great soup!

This recipe is really easy and delicious.  I used ground turkey to make the meatballs.  I have made it twice and each time, I get raved reviews.  For an even quicker way to make it, I make the meatballs ahead of time and freeze them.  Absolutely delicious!!

This is a fantastic recipe and was a hit with the family.  I trippled the recipe and I took one reviewers advice and added some beef broth along with the chicken broth.  Instead of using orzo, I used acini di pepe but I added too much.  Next time I will use 1c of the acini di pepe (if I triple the amount of soup made). Great recipe.

With the exception of the following changes, I followed the recipe ... 1/2 lb. ground pork & 1/2 lb. ground veal in place of the ground beef; italian bread broken into very small peices instead of dry bread crumbs; 1/8 C. finely chopped onion & 1 tsp. minced garlic in place of the onion powder; 2 qts. of chicken stock; 3/4 C. acini di pepe (cooked first); 1 C. finely chopped carrot.  I also browned the meatballs prior to adding to the soup.

Absolutely delicious with some necessary modifications...The meatballs are way too bland as written. Increased the parmesan cheese (used fresh & grated myself) to 3 heaping tablespoons. Added crushed red chilies (1/2 tsp), minced 2 garlic cloves and 1 heaping tblsp fresh parsley minced. Followed other reviewer's suggestion to substitute one cup of the chicken broth to beef. Julienned the carrot very thin instead of shredding. Garnish with extra parm cheese and freshly ground pepper.

This was wonderful at my soup party last night.  I doubled the recipe, baked the meatballs ahead of time using only one egg.  I also cooked the orzo separate.  I added some dried onions, parsley and italian seasoning as the soup cooked.

Very good soup! My husband's favorite soup and now a family staple. I tweaked the recipe as suggested by others: browned the very small meatballs first, added finely chopped onions to the meatball mixture, used 1/2 gr. beef and 1/2 gr. turkey, and 1/2 the amount of orzo. A great Sunday afternoon meal.

This soup is wonderful!  My husband made this for my monthly scrapbook workshop last night and all of my friends loved it, too!  He tripled the recipe and the 3 cups of orzo was a bit much so next time we will scale back on that.  Also, we used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground sausage instead of beef.  Yummy!

I always read through what others have done to alter the recipe.  I used the ground pork/beef/veal combo that I use for meatloaf for the meatballs.  I baked them for 20 minutes (I should have sprayed the sheet with baking spray because they stuck a bit).  I sauteed carrots, onions, garlic, and celery and then added the broth.  Added meatballs and spinach (only one box-frozen 10oz cut).  I cooked the orzo separate but I think I might throw it into the soup the next time. At the table, we spooned in some parm. cheese and turned out great.  My husband is Italian and super picky and he really liked it!  His one criticism was that the meatballs were a little too big (he likes them to be small enough to pop in his mouth).  I made them about 3/4 inch but I guess that's too big for the likes of him.  Anyway, the recipe worked well. Next time, I'll probably add actual onion to the meatballs and not onion powder but I was low on time.

We leave out the orzo and put in extra greens because my husband is diabetic.  Even my little kids like this.  It's WONDERFUL!

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I used ground turkey instead of beef just because I generally like that better, and it worked well in the soup.

Ok, lots of changes for this one. I made the meatballs ahead of time. I used 1lb ground turkey, dried parsley, oregano, basil and chives, grill season, garlic, eggs, and panko bread crumbs. I rolled these really tiny and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. This makes a ton and I froze half of them for future use. When I made the soup I chopped and sauteed 2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery, 4 cloves of garlic and 1 onion used 6 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of beef broth and added 2 bay leaves. I used 2 10oz boxes of defrosted spinach and let the soup simmer together for almost a hour before I let it cool. I also made the orzo separate and added it as I ate the soup. This is really good, much better than the canned stuff(I have tried them all!) Thanks!

'Soup'erb! Sometimes when I knows it's going to be a hectic week I'll slow cook a chicken one night (Baked Slow Cooker Chicken + 48oz canned broth) strain & save the broth to use with this recipe another night.  Merely a suggestion, its still delicious as is!

I cooked the orzo pasta in a seperate pan then added to the soup and then broiled the meatballs on both sides and added to the soup. I also used about 10 cups of broth and the pasta still used up quite of the broth after it sat for a bit so I was glad I used extra. Super easy soup that makes a statement!

Awesome recipe!!!  I made a few changes to this recipe: I used a mixture of ground beef, veal, pork instead of the ground beef, I cooked the orzo separately first and allowed it to soak a bit so it wouldn't soak up too much soup juice, and the more escarole the better!!

This is a great soup. Then night before I made the meatballs, boiled them in water and then drained them and browned them. I combined the chicken broth, grated carrots, frozen spinich (defrosted and dried), and meatballs. I put this in my crockpot and stored in the the fridge.  I also cooked the pasta, rinsed it and tossed it with a little olive oil.  Then next morning I warmed up the soup in the crock pot by heating on high for 4 hour. One hour before serving I added the pasta that I had heated in the microwave.  It came out perfect!  The meatballs were tender, the soup was not greasy and the pasta was perfect. A wonderful soup for a lunch time meeting! Thanks!

My Mother and both of my Grandmothers came straight off of the boat (literally!) and this soup is JUST like thiers. Agreed, you should cook the pasta seperately or add more broth to make up for it, as my mother told me, but other than that it does not get more Italian than this! Some people suggested using chicken or turkey for the meatballs, but that isn't the authentic way to make this - the combination of the flavors works perfectly as is. It is just as I remembered it when my mom made this for me as a kid in the Bronx when I stayed home sick from school. I am so happy that I can make this for my kids now too, when I have them! : )

This was a great recipe....and extremely easy. The first pot I made..did not last long at all, so a second pot is on the stove. I did change a coiple of things.....first, the thought of raw meat cooking in a soup just does not appeal to me..so I boiled the meatballs for 1 minute in water and chicken boullion (2 cubes), this worked out perfectly and reduced the amount of grease in the soup. I also used italian seasoning instead of basil in the meatballs. Other than that, it was delious and very easy.

I liked this soup!  I used ground turkey for my meatballs and was worried about them holding their shape because the meat is so soft, so I put them on a greased cookie sheet and placed under the broiler about 5 minutes till they browned and they held their shape fine!  I doubled everything except I used 2/3 cup of the orzo and about 7 cups of broth.   I also added about 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in my meatballs for some kick!  I agree with another reviewer... I'll never go back to canned soups again!

Great flavorful soup!  I did follow some other suggestions and made a veal/beef/chicken combo to make the meatballs - they turned out excellent!  Like others noted, you could get away with 1/2 of the pasta called for.  Also, perhaps cooking the pasta separate and adding it in the end might cut down on how much it absorbs.  I did add some chicken bullion powder to enrich the flavor but I add it to all my chicken soups. Everyone loved this soup!

I made small meatball and baked them on a cookie sheet first (then patted any extra grease off of them)  I also added chopped celery and onion as well as poultry seasoning and chicken bouillion to taste. I used one readers suggestion and cooked the orzo separately.  Definitely use escarole if you can find it. 

I've been asked for this recipe by at least 6 people so far.

GREAT recipe. Very little changes:  Used 1 cup mini shells instead of orzo (cooked first), and used 7 cups of broth.  I used 3 cups beef and 4 cups chicken.  Also boiled the pasta in chicken bouillon.  Added 2 Tbsp. GOOD Parmesan (no green can stuff!) to meatballs, plus garlic salt to taste.  Browned the meatballs first and also briefly sauteed the carrots w/ finely chopped onion.  Don't throw the pasta in until just before serving and make sure to top it w/ some more of that good Parmesan.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good Basic Wedding soup but nothing special.  With all the fantastic reviews, I had expected more.  It's just run-of-the-mill wedding soup.  I think I'll keep searching for a winner

This recipe was so surprisingly easy.  The only thing that was time consuming was making the little meatballs because they are so small.  However, it was also very good for my 16 month old daughter.  She loved it.  And I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Excellent!

I can't beleive how easy and quick this was! Last night I doubled the recipe (albeit loosely) and my family of 4 devoured it.  I didn't have onion powder so I used chopped onion, slightly sauted with 2 cloves of minced garlic, in both the meatballs and soup.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was so unbelievably easy!  I made it right before I had to get my children from school.  Some slight variations were made.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  We do not eat much red meat in our family.  I also added alittle extra onion powder and herbs.  Fantastic!  Thanks so much.

My husband made this for me as I was sick in bed.  It was delicious.  He used spinach instead of escarole.  The leftovers the next day was more like a casserole than a soup but was just as good.  The kids loved it as well!

This is a really nice soup. I did everything as stated except I used more than a half a pound of beef and used sliced spinach instead of escarole. I also substituted small shell pasta for the orzo. I served it with mozzarella and tomato garlic bread. This isn't quite as good as other Italian Wedding soups that I've had in the past, but this was definitely worth trying.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it!  It tasted good even the next day.  My grandmother loved it too!  I put a little garlic salt in the meatballs and put spinach.  Next time I will use escarole.

This basic recipe is great! I did make a few changes though, and will continue to tweek it. I used whole baby spinich leaves instead of escrole, and added chopped fresh celery as well. The meatballs were perfect as is. Next time I will only use half the amount of orzo because it was a little to thick ( I like my soup a little more soupy.) I also added 8oz. of baby bella mushrooms. It was fantasic!! I doubled the recipe and it made about 6 qts. Thank you!!

Delicious! I've always loved Italian Wedding soup but never made it. I'm so glad I finally did! It was a breeze to make and my little girl loved it. The meatballs turned out beautifully in taste and consistency. We love soup so I plan to add this recipe to my permanent file. Thanks Star, for sharing!

I followed the directions exactly, and will not make it again. Maybe this is  how Italian Wedding soup is suppossed to taste, but for my family is was very bland.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it several times and usually make double the meatballs, bake them, and then freeze half for the next time.  I also use acini di pepe pasta and add shredded, cooked chicken, and use low sodium or homemade chicken broth.  Fantastic.

Followed the recipe except I used Asini di pepe because I do not like orzo and I used half ground chuck and half ground pork. Also will need to half the pasta, it is way too much. Do not make the mistake I made by simmering the soup for 10 minutes and then adding the pasta and simmering for another 10 minutes. This cooked the meatballs too long and they were a little dry. This soup is good to eat and easy to make.

I was not too concerned with the tradition this recipe only in that I don't mind tweaking it a bit. I like to dice up baby carrots and water chesnuts to enrich the color, flavor and texture. Although it is not at all nesscecary is sure is great to add those. This is a favorite for me to make and to eat. SOOOOO yummy!!!! Satisfying to make serve and eat. Highest rating.

I added garlic powder and parsley to the broth.  We all added extra cheese to our soup bowls.  It was very good. My whole family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I just made this tonight and it's pretty easy, the hardest part is the meatballs if you're hand-making them and that still barely takes 10 minutes.  I used all-natural low-sodium boxed chicken broth, and added peas for nutrition since I didn't have escarole or spinach.  Very good and easy!  Will make it again and may try to freeze some as well.

Very good recipe.  I substituted a few things...one huge can of broth (6 c), frozen mini meatballs, and frozen chopped spinach.  Also, my preference would be to cut the orzo to 1/2 c. next time.  I made a day ahead, and it was way too thick.  I added another 2 c. of broth and it was still too thick.  BUT, good flavor/combinations.

This was really good! I added more pasta because I love pasta and I fried the meatballs first just for a minute so they would gain some olive oil flavor and keep their shape. I also used spinach instead because I had it already. It was delicious!

Okay, now I'm a believer too!  Had an impromptu dinner party Saturday night and made this Friday evening.  I also used Spinach but instead of all ground beef, I used 25% mild Italian sausage.  My husband likes "crisper" meatballs so I pan fried all sides and they held their shape nicely in the soup.

I was a little concerend about the "salt" issue because of earlier reviewers so I used "regular" canned chicken broth instead of "lower" sodium and the soup was wonderful.

Delicious!  
Rather than Orzo, I used Acini di Pepe.  Cook the pasta first, and rinse before adding to the soup.  Use ½ cup dry Acini de Pepe for 4 servings of soup. 

My husband loves Italian Wedding Soup, and this is now his favorite!! I’ll be making it a lot!!

This was a fantastic soup Star!! Quick and tasty.  I'm not a big fan of ground meat, but the meatballs were very tasty.  I used baby spinach and that worked very well in this recipe.  The leftovers were equally delicious.  Thanks for sharing this.

In place of escarole I use spinach.  Since I don't care for cooked spinach pieces I put the spinach in a wire basket and immerse in soup while cooking and remove later.  This way I can control intensity of its flavor too.

Wow!  My husband asked me to make this soup for him, and I did thinking I would hate it.  It's fantastic!  I pretty much followed the recipe, except substituted tubettini pasta for the orzo.  I also followed other recommendations to cook the meatballs separately.  I added the rind of an end piece of pecorino-romano cheese to the soup pot, I think it was a wonderful addition.

Next time I make this I will double the recipe, and probably added some salt and some fresh minced garlic to the meatballs.  I think they need a little extra kick.

Yummy!  I didn't have any beef, so I thought I could sub. sausage for it, BIG mistake!  The meatballs came out SALTY!.  Anyhow, I did take others advice and added chopped chicken and sub. spinach and used elbow macaroni.  It was excellent (even w/o the meatballs)!

I have been asked many times for this recipe.  I find the quantity of orzo pasta needs to be reduced slightly.

I made a few changes as the soup was a little bland: I used 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage in the meatballs. I also added pine nuts to the meatballs. To make the broth a little richer, I add some Molly McButter, but be sure to reduce any salt if you do this. I cut the carrots into thin "coins" for a better visual. A few sprigs of fresh basil give it that finishing touch.

Superb!  I used fresh baby spinace instead of the escarole and I also pre-cooked the orzo and added it to the soup afterwards.

I like this soup because it's quick and REALLY tasty.  The tough part is finding escarole.  My DH abhors spinach, so I tried suey choy, a cousin of bok choy, and it worked perfectly.  One could also try bagged mixed greens.  Also if you are in a hurry, use precooked frozen meatballs.

It has been many years since I've had Wedding Soup and this recipe tastes even better than I remember. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added half the amount of orzo. I also added the meat from one chicken breast, shredded, as this was always included in the Wedding Soup that I used to have. Thanks for a great recipe that will be made over and over again.

I had been looking for a recipe for this after having it in a little cafe in Tennessee.  My husband is Italian so I'm always looking for a different recipe to suprise him with.   Very easy...great just as the recipe states!

Very flavorful!  My Italian father loved it! Tweaked the meatballs a bit by substituting fresh onion for onion powder and parsley for basil.  I agree with cooking the orzo seperately...i had to add extra broth to compensate.  Excellent & easy!

I loved this! This was quick and easy.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and it was tasty.  Next time I will cut the amount of orzo in half because it was too much pasta for me.

Fabulous soup!! My whole family loved it. I made a couple of changes...I used italian bread crumbs and added one teaspoon of garlic salt to the meat mixture. I also cut the amount of Orzo in half per others suggestions. Turned out great.

This is a GREAT recipe - I adjust just a little: I add some garlic powder to the meatballs, instead of escarole I use fresh spinach, instead of orzo pasta I use pasta rings, and instead of grated parmesan I use shredded(which comes in a tub) which melts beautifully on top!

This soup was excellent and only took a short time to prepare!  Even a 6-year old loved it (minus the spinach).  Consider cooking the meatballs ahead of time to make them more firm.

This soup was surprisingly good for being so simple.  I used spinach (couldn't find escarole).  I cut back on the pasta as everyone recommended, and added more meatballs to make it more appealing to the husband.  The kids liked it, too.  The parmesan cheese on top really does the trick.

This is an extremely easy recipe to follow. It doesn't beat my mothers - but my mom makes her chicken broth, adds chicken and meatballs, and makes her own pasta... so that's why I don't use my mom's recipe! I added sliced hard boiled egg - I recommend that additional touch!

Mmmm.  Great!  I used wheat germ instead of bread crumbs and garlic powder instead of onion powder; the meatballs were still great.  I was very glad I halved the orzo as everyone had suggested.  Will add this one to my recipe box!

Just adding my two cents worth.  I made this without carrots, doubled the recipe to have leftovers, LOVED it, so did my husband, even after eating this for two days straight.  It has a great mellow taste to it, gave the recipe to a lot of people to try.

This recipe was wonderful!!!  I read the reviews before I made it and followed some of the suggestions.  I used spinach instead of escarole and I only added 1/2 cup pasta.  It was very easy to make and I will make it again soon.

Loved this recipe.  I made a mistake and put the basil in the soup instead of the meatballs and the flavor and aroma were awesome!!  The people at my job have asked me to make these about once a month.  Definitely a keeper!!!!!

Overall a VERY tasty recipe!  However:

* 1 cup orzo pasta is WAY too much...I ended up adding 4 more cups of broth.  Next time I'll split it to 1/2 cup.
* The preparation time is NOT 30 minutes...not if you're going to make the meatballs the right size.  Took me 30 minutes for that _alone_.
* Minced onion works well for a substitution for onion powder.

A good, filling soup.  I was nervous about cooking the meatballs in the broth, but it really brought out the flavor.  I increased the amount of broth per other's suggestions and it worked very well.  I used spinach instead of escarole and it tasted great!

This soup was absolutely fabulous!  I did add an extra cup of chicken broth and onions, zucchini, and skinned tomatoes.  Love this recipe, but I recommend sauteing 1/3 of  chopped onion and a couple cloves of garlic in olive oil before you add your broth to boil.  Also, I add about 1/3 of a finely chopped medium size onion to the meatballs instead of onion powder.  Red pepper flakes also gives it a little more punch.

This soup was delicious, both my husband and I loved it!!!

However, the one problem I found was that the orzo pasta sucked up most of the broth. The next time I make it, I would use half as much of the orzo pasta or perhaps cook the pasta separately and add it to the bowls when serving.  

Other than that this recipe was fantastic.  I would definitely recommend trying this recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I made it for Christmas Eve and my family went crazy.  I did bake the meatballs before I put them in the soup at 350 for 25 min.

"Wow!" This is a new family favorite!
I followed the recipe exactly, using
" Chicken Soup and Gravy Base"
to make the chicken broth, fresh
spinach and freshly grated parmesan,...
I wouldn't change a thing! Not only does
this soup have an amazing flavor, but it's
also very attractive! I'm going to freeze
lots of those little meatballs when I have
time, so we can enjoy this soup more often.
Thank you!

This recipe was really easy to make, and its extremely easy.  I did not make my own chicken stock, but used chicken boullions instead.  Overall, we love it and will definately make it again.

Excellent soup! Takes a while to make the meatballs, but in the end it's worth it! Made it for a potluck supper and have been asked to make it again for a Soup Supper at our Church. Very kid-friendly-they like the small meatballs.

I had ground venison on hand, so I used that for the meatballs.  I think i would use sausage or ground chicken next time.  But this is a wonderful soup.

Made as directed.Would not use escarole next time.(Maybe spinach) And would not add pasta. Would leave pasta on side to add to each bowl. (Too mushy.)

I've made this twice.  It's very good as is but try adding a squeeze of lemon juice from a fresh lemon (slightly large wedge).  It adds even more depth to it!

I made this today as my daughter’s choice of meals for the week.  It was pretty easy and definitely quick.  I had to make a few adjustments, starting with using Acini di Pepe, the small round pasta, instead of Orzo at my daughter’s request.   While this was fine, I felt that it soaked up too much of the broth, so I ended up using double the amount of broth called for.    The rest was perfect and it tasted pretty good.

Although the recipe does not state this explicitly— you DO need to cook the meatballs BEFORE adding to recipe. Also, I substituted acini de pepe pasta for orzo pasta and LOVED it!

This is excellent. I made 12 servings and substituted 2 of the 17 cups of chicken broth for beef broth. I also substituted diced cauliflower for the orzo pasta since we have 2 diabetics. Then I added a little kale. We will be making this many times this winter!!!!!!

This was really good but I did make some changes.
First, I used about a cup of thinly sliced carrots, 1 celery stick and a half onion, fryed it in butter for about 8 minutes before deglazing the pot with a 1/4 cup cooking sherry. I then used 6 cups low/no sodium chicken stock and a cup of beef. At the end though I had to add extra salt as well as a half chicken cube. Similarly to others I added a tbsp of Worcestershire, 2 bay leaves, and a tsp of herbs de provence. I cooked the meatballs, which i made from ground pork, separately in the oven and added them after the broth/vegetables simmer ~25 min, and continued to simmer for about an hour. I added two cups chopped spinach at the very end. I cooked the pasta separate  and only added it to the bowl that was going to be eaten so they didn't get soggy for the leftovers. I also crushed two cloves of garlic in on the last 10 minutes.  Oh, and I misread about the Parmesan going into the meatballs so i just grated on top of the soup. Will make again... tasty :D

This is a good basic recipe but it definitely needs tweaking. I like to use beef & chicken broth because I find that more flavorful but I will use whatever I have on hand. I also use the traditional Italian herbs & seasonings to taste. I like to bake the meatballs until brown before I add them in and I never add the pasta to the broth but rather to the bowls because I personally prefer pasta to be al dente.  Scrape whatever browned bits I have into the soup pot, sprinkle with fresh grated parm & top with Italian croutons. Serve with a crusty loaf and YUM!

Gtreat soup! It’s a keeper. I do use one cup of beef broth as the first poster stated, it adds a lot of extra flavor.  Use only 1/2 of pasta.  Cook it separately

Looked over several of the reviews and used the best variations of many, like less orzo, baked the meatballs and used spinach instead and came out GREAT!
Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that it was not different from the recipe I ate as a child. The meatballs were delicious but I found the escarole to be bitter. I remember these greens to have a mellow taste  and I wonder if they. should be parboiled before putting them into the broth.

This is a great recipe that hits all the marks for Italian Wedding Soup. I just wanted to add that when my Sicilian great-grandmother made Wedding Soup she would beat 2 eggs and pour them very slowly into the boiling soup.  Also, I like a bit of flour to give the soup a little extra body. If anyone wanted a little snack before bed she would boil a little broth and add a beaten egg. Simple and delicious!

I love the progressor version of this soup. It’s was a kick up.
I used the frozen Italian meatballs, I added some fresh spinach, because I had some, celery and onion to the broth simmer. Very quick and easy and a worthy cold night dinner.

This soup was excellent, but I did make a few slight changes. As others' reviews stated, the orzo really expands if you do not cook it separately. To remedy this, I simply used more chicken broth. Also, the soup really needed a little more zest, so I added a fair amount of salt and pepper to the broth. Chicken stock tends to be saltier than chicken broth, so using 1/2 stock 1/2 broth is another option. Overall, this soup is great, and I've made it twice in one week!

I made it! It was delicious. I doubled all the ingredients. I used ground turkey because hubs is allergic to beef. I also through in a bag fully thawed frozen chopped spinach at the end, instead of escarole, because that's what I had on hand. No one seemed to notice. Everyone went back for seconds. I'm glad I doubled the recipe.

The recipe doesn't call for salt but I thought I might add a 1/2 tsp and it ended up being a tiny bit too salty.  I even taste tested it first before adding it to the soup! My daughter thought it was great, even with the added salt.

Substituted arugula for spinach, it is what I had available.  This was delicious thank you for sharing! The parmesan in the meatball mix was such a touch yet subtle and that clear broth yummy!

My hubby's new favorite soup! I used chicken for the meatballs, which I used a pastry bag to dispense into a pan, and browned first. Defintely substitute 1 cup of beef broth for one of the chicken as it makes a huge difference! I also sauteed alittle garlic, finely diced celery and green onion, as well as increasing the carrot amount to 1 cup. I substituted cooked Israeli couscous, for the orzo whch worked very well. I also used kale which my hubby never had before and absolutely loved!

I would make this again. I had trouble with getting enough broth. I would use more broth instead of adding water. I also added chicken because to me Wedding soup means the marriage of beef and chicken. I also used spinach. Made too many changes to this recipe to really give it five stars, but it's a good base for someone like me who has never made soup wedding soup before.

Found another way of using our venison! I had to add more seasoning to it and I also took the advise from someone else about adding beef broth for more flavor. Turned out great.

This was very good.  I did bake the meatballs about 20 minutes.  I used about 3/4 C ditalini and added a little more chicken broth.  Used italian bread crumbs, spinach, more carrots and added a can of rinsed kidney beans.  Served with buttermilk biscuits - made an excellent supper.

This is a really good recipe - I make this for my daughter and I and we both love it!  It’s a good soup to take for lunches during the week.  My only tweak is that I use prepared meatballs because it’s easier, quicker, and cheaper.

I used frozen Italian meatballs, thawed and browned in a skillet. I also added the kidney beans as one cook suggested. I added a little basil paste for flavor and topped the soup when served with Parmesan cheese. This soup is delicious and easy.

Couple easy changes....1/2 lb ground turkey mixed with 1/2 ground beef OR use all ground turkey. Either way spouse never realized not all beef. Used baby spinach. We love it so much I double the recipe and break down to freeze. I have taken to many friends recovering from illness and immediately ask for the recipe.

For the meatballs, I used 1/2 lb grnd pork, 1/2 lb. grnd beef, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp steak spice and 1 tbsp worchester sauce and froze the rest of meatballs for next batch. I also browned the meatballs before adding them to the soup. I increased the carrots to 1/2 cup, and decreased the pasta (acini di pepe) to 1/2 cup. I also doubled the meatball recipe to have leftover meatballs.

Hubby made this with a few changes. He accidentally added the orzo to the soup without cooking first so our soup was thickened and I found that extra appealing. In addition he couldn’t find escarole so he subbed spinach. Besides that he added garlic and onion and the soup was too die for!!!

Great recipe, super easy. I do prefer to cook orzo and meatballs separately; I prefer making small meatballs using ground turkey instead of beef and I bake them for 20-30 minutes (depending on size) at 350, then thrown everything together when I am ready to serve. I also sauté some onion with the carrots before adding the broth. I’ve made it with chopped kale or spinach as a substitute. This is a great soup and is filling enough to have for dinner - and my kids love it, too.

Almost excellent starter recipe. Took several suggestions from other reviews and this was a huge hit even on first attempt. Changes I made were: 
- Used ground turkey instead of the beef to make the meatballs, also doubled the amount of  meat. 
- Once meatballs were formed, baked them until cooked thoroughly and completely browned (better taste and presentation). 
- For the broth, used 6 cups chicken stock and one cup beef broth. 
Cooked the orzo separately and added in just a few minutes before we ate. 

Definitely added to make again list!

I have made this many times.  I improvise depending on how hearty we want it.  Saute onions, carrots, and celery then add broth.   A can of kidney beans and/or tortellini adds heartiness.  No longer the same soup but serves as a great base.  Great recipe as is too!

I put in 5 cups of chicken broth and 1 can of condensed French onion soup. That gave a richer flavor than just chicken broth. I also used Acini di Pepe pasta instead of orzo and cooked it separate. Italian parsley for garnish and fresh grated Parmesan Riggiano. Sooooo good!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and it turned out great.  I browned the meatballs prior to putting them in the broth.  I also sauteed my vegetables (1 carrot, 1/2 onion, 1 celery stalk) in a little olive oil and garlic prior to adding the broth, escarole and meatballs.  I also went easy on the orzo (3/4 cups instead of 1).  I'll definitely be adding this to dinner rotation!

I LOVE Italian wedding soup but this one was a bit lacking in flavor.  I'm not sure if I needed to add more salt or what.  Admittedly I did use pre-made frozen meatballs so perhaps that contributed.  Although I thought the meatballs were fine, just the soup was lacking in flavor.

It was really good. I made This soup for the first time today after having a can of Campbell’s yes soup of the same kind. It reminded me of chicken noodle but obviously not chicken, similar base. I read a few reviews and did this only because it seems like a base to a soup that needed some more ingredients like other reviews suggesting and what was in the can of soup I ate. I used Jennie ground turkey and added 3 medium carrots, 3 stalk celery and half a small onion. And spinach verse escarole for I know spinach is accessible. I also cooked a double batch for wanting leftovers. I cooked the orzo noodles separate because I didn’t want them to absorb all the broth. I’m happy with the results. I will make again. And I sent recipe to family as I am the recipe tester of the family.

I love this soup. The only changes I made was to use mild Italian sausage for the meatballs, which I made in advance, and I used baby spinach leaves instead of escarole. I added the spinach during the last minute of cooking. This is a great weeknight soup.

Made it from fresh chicken stock in my pressure cooker.  Will use the chicken for chicken salad and the stock I used for the Wedding Soup.  Instead of 1/2 hamburger, I did 1/4 hamburger and 1/4 Italian sausage.  Kept all the other ingredients.   Cooked orzo separately.   Added teaspoon of fresh parmesan cheese to top each bowl off.    The soup was amazing!!!!

I sautéed the carrots, onions, and celery in separate pan , browned small chunks of chicken breast, and added water and chicken bouillon to increase the amount of soup, added it to the original recipe for chicken broth plus 1/2 of the carrots  that was simmering. I used a half a pound of organic ditalini and supplemented spinach along with remaining ingredients .

My husbands favorite, make it all the time!  I usually add 1/2 cup diced onion, 2 cups sliced carrots, 1 cup beef stock and substituted spinach for the escarole.  I only use 2/3 cup orzo boiled in a separate pot for 5 minutes, and drain before adding to soup.  Cuts down on the starch.  I always double the meatball recipe and freeze half, to have on hand.  Cuts down the preparation time for next time round :)

My daughter and I have made this twice and loved it each time.  We double the full recipe then quadrupled the meatballs and added garlic.  We also went a bit heavier on the other seasoning. My DD thinks we should experiment with some chopped tomato or paste next time.  I'm sure we will use this recipe for a very long time.

We're a plant based household so I subbed lentil meat rolled in walnut Parmesan and swapped out the pasta for quinoa. All cooked in veggie stock with soy sauce and balsamic vinegar added for extra body and (beefy) flavor. Great jumping off point. Thanks.

Loveeeeeed it! Doubled the recipe because I used a pound of ground beef. Cooked pasta and meatballs before hand (350 for 25 minutes). Used two containers of chicken broth, one can of beef and one can of veggie broth. Also added 1/3 cup of celery (will probably add more next time because it was good) :) My hubby couldn't find the right pasta at the store so we used Ditalini pasta and it was perfect. Ill make it the same next time!

I didn't use Orzo- I only had "Pastina stars" one time and Acini di Pepe another time. My sister-in-law made it with diced pieces of chicken AND meatballs over Christmas  Eveof 2016,  though it was probably a little overkill, but it was absolutely wonderful. I had more of the soup than anything.

will make it again, but with less orzo.  The orzo to broth ratio should be a little more like 1/2 a cup to the 5 3/4 of broth.  Otherwise the orzo takes over the soup.

I made this soup and it turned out great!  It's light yet satisfying.  My husband loved it.  I swap the vegetable to spinach and for the meatball, I added an extra 1 tbsp of parmesan.  However, I must say, the pasta absorbed much of the soup by the time I was ready to serve.  Because I had leftovers uncooked meatballs and the soup, I cooked one fresh can of soup and added the meatballs, more spinach, and carrots and poured it over the leftovers.  It makes it more soupy and still delicious the next day!  Would definitely keep and make this recipe again but with minor adjustment to the recipe.

Excellent just the way it was written. If I changed a recipe completely and then reviewed it that would be for my recipe, not the contributor 's recipe!!! My only comment is that Rhode Island existed long before any Italian immigrants arrived.  It was the first state, 1776.

Delicious. I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions:  browning the meatballs first, chicken + beef broth, and keeping the orzo separate. I also used kale instead of escarole and added carrots and mushrooms. I also added crushed red peppers to the meatballs and the soup itself, because we love spicy food!

roasted the meatballs for a couple of minutes. Don't know if it mattered.  Used fresh basil in meatball. Added a little beef to the stock.  Not flavorful enough. Next time saute onion celery and carrot prior to stock add salt to meatball and soup. Used kale it was good.

I used pre-made mini meatballs in chicken broth with the listed seasonings. I used sliced carrotts, some onion and celery. It was delicious!

This recipe is missing three key ingredients.....
CELERY,SALT and PEPPER!!!!!!!!!
who doesn't add salt and pepper  to their meatballs and broth? Dummy me while making this said ok maybe because there is enough SALT in the chicken broth, I don't need to add more? lol oh noooo,  So ok I followed this recipe to the "T" and was soooo upset it was like blahhhh! My family said it was okay... but I was like no way!! I always make enough for my family to have leftovers a week or so later by freezing my soups, well the second time we had this I added salt to the broth and couldn't stop eating it! DO NOT FORGET SALT!!

Amazing flavor.  I substituted meatballs for a few different typed of sausage.  This soup disappeared in no time.

i made this soup as part of our Canadian Allrecipes Allstars challenge #ARSoupsUp#soupoftheday. i LOVE Italian Wedding Soup and have been making it for years. i followed this recipe but made a couple of tweaks/changes per diet restrictions and what i had on hand. i used homemade chicken stock, i uses spinach instead of escarole as it was what i had on hand. For the meatballs, i used spicey italian turkey sausage. i took the meat out of the casing and formed tiny meatballs until i had enough for my soup. i browned them a little before adding to my lightly boiling broth. i use some small square shaped pasta, as it was the smallest size pasta i had. i also added in a couple of  parmesan rinds for extra flavour. i'm very happy with the outcome of this soup. It really is delicious! YUM

I make this often as comfort food. I vary depending on the crowd. For example, I'll omit the spinach fit my mom who is allergic. I also always use ground turkey in place of beef. And the Tuscan flavored chicken broth gives it a bit more flavor. But I've loved this recipe from the beginning!

VERY easy, and quick to make. I goofed and defrosted ground PORK instead of ground BEEF. No big deal. Followed instructions for the little meatballs, and they turned out just fine. Didn't have onion powder, so used onion flakes instead.  Used the smallest pasta I had on hand. I emptied my pasta container, so there was probably and additional 1/3 cup pasta. Increased the broth by about a cup to offset the additional pasta. Didn't have escarole, so used frozen chopped spinach instead. This was a great guide for making a wonderful soup! Hubby said he would appreciate this on the menu more often! Thanks for a great recipe. I will definately be using this one again.

I found the soup very bland.  I try to cook using low sodium broth when possible, but this needed a lot of other seasonings and salt to make the broth have any flavor.  I don't think I would use the beef broth next time, but I would add an Italian seasoning blend.  I also added about 1/4 cup white wine.  Anything to add flavor.  I baked the meatballs and would do that again and definitely add salt to the mixture.  They are bland as well.

I LOVE this recipe. It's the exact same one that's on the back of the San Giorgio Orzo pasta box (in case you want to follow from that).  I followed other reviewers suggestions (baked the meatballs, added 1 cup beef broth and cooked pasta in a seperate pot).

This was delicious.  It took me about 3 minutes to make the meatballs and add to soup - very easy!  I did cook the orzo separately - but only until it was very al dente.  I then added to soup as it was simmering.  I used a whole bag of spinach that I just rinsed and dumped into soup.   Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe. I made it on a snowy day with grilled cheese made from provolone, tomato, and Italian bread. I added some beef broth to the chicken, baked the meatballs and cooked the pasta first. I used 1/2 penne, 1/2 acini di pepe and a beef/pork/veal mix for the meatballs. I will definitely make this again exactly the same.

I made this for the first time and I liked it although I made a few changes. I always read the reviews and look for tips before I actually make something.
I used ground turkey for the meatballs and browned them in olive oil. I also cooked the orzo separately so it won't soak all the liquid and it worked perfectly. I used 1 and 1/2 lbs of ground turkey to make the meatballs, 5 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of beef broth (as recommended by someone) and the liquid is enough for all the meatballs and orzo pasta. I also used kale because I didn't have escarole and added celery . I also added a pinch of salt. My whole family  liked it! This dish is perfect for cold weather or for someone who's sick. :)

Very good recipe. I make double the meatballs and then freeze half for super quick preps the next time I make it. I use 2/3 cup of orzo and 8 cups of chicken stock so it's more soupy, otherwise the orzo sucks up all the moisture. Also, I've used frozen and fresh spinach or spinach/kale mixture. Fresh is way better than frozen! To cut time I do buy shredded carrots in the produce section. My picky kids love this soup. It's a family favorite.

Incredible just cook pasta separately because is soaks up all the liquid. Pasta becomes over cooked.  But again this was perfect!!!

I have made this several times.  I add salt and garlic to the meatballs and bake them first to get the grease out.  For the broth I use 2 c beef broth and 4 c chicken broth and add garlic powder, green onion, and any Italian seasonings I have on hand.  Delicious!

Great basic recipe! Always get this from the Italian bakery nearly my house and always wondered how they make it. I wish I would have went with my gut and got the ground chicken. The beef meatballs threw off the authentic flavor a little and made it greasy. I also added a can of stewed tomatoes for color. Came out pretty good!

So good! Quadrupled the recipe and used turkey instead of beef, it's fantastic and tastes just like I remember. I didn't use Orzo, I used Pastinas, Acini de Pepe.

Excellent soup! I used 3/4 lb of sweet Italian sausage and 3/4 lb of ground chuck for the meatballs. I added garlic and the other spices with 2 eggs and 8 tbsp of bread crumbs. Baked them on 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.  I doubled the carrots and added 2 stalks of celery and 1/2 an onion. I sautéed the veggies and then added 8 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of beef broth, and added an extra tsp of chicken base. Added my meatballs and spinach and simmered for 20 minutes. I cooked the orzo separately and used the whole cup. I topped it with grated Parmesan cheese when serving. It was amazing. My hubby agreed!

I like meatballs so I doubled the ingredients for the meatball portion. I used 2 900ml boxes of chicken stock + 1 cup of beef broth suggested by another reviewer. Everything else was the same. Everyone loved it which for my family is a rarity! 

Served this with parmesan as people desire and add a loaf of garlic bread. Presto! Dinner is served.

I modified the recipe slightly. I made it with beef broth and baked the meatballs for 10 minutes. That drained the fat from the meatballs. I also used frozen chopped spinach. It was a huge success

A hit at dinner time. I believe you must cook the orzo separately. It continues to soak up the water.  We double up so there are leftovers and the flavored on day two can't be beat.

If you use acini de pepe pasta instead it is way better as it doesn't absorb the liquid like orzo does.  I also used lean ground chicken to lower fat content!

Good recipe, everyone loved it. Next time however I will cook my Orzo separately, so that it doesn't soak up all the broth. Also, I was Abe to do this in the crock pot, while working, and had delicious soup for dinner. I also used turkey instead of beef. This is a great basic recipe though that you can adjust and tweak to suit your taste.

YUM!!  This was the PERFECT thing for a rainy autumn day!  The whole family loved it.  The only change that I made was to use ground turkey for the meatballs and I also doubled the recipe.  Glad I did!!  It's a hit!!  Thanks.

Updating:  I made this again following the directions exactly except I added a cup or so of beef broth and a generous sprinkle of garlic powder and dried onions to the carrots when I sauted them before adding the broth.  Everything including the escarole was exactly as written.  (The orzo was cooked separately as I'm sure the recipe is supposed to say).  It was DELICiOUS.  I added another sprinkle of bread crumbs in my mixture because my meat mix was very wet.  Then I just dropped tiny little balls into the slightly boiling broth.  I found it was easies to set the meat container on the counter next to the Stove and just grab a small pinch of meat, roll it slightly and drop it in.  So good.  I will definitely be making this again.  

OLD REVIEW:  I followed other's suggestions to add 1 cup of beef broth.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef and had to use dried Italian Seasoning because I couldn't find the basil for anything.  It was good.  I'd make it again.  I dropped the meatballs into the boiling broth and it wasn't greasy at all...but that was the point of using turkey anyway.  I also cooked the pasta separately and added it into the bowl before spooning over the soup.  And I used a bag of spinach that I chopped up with scissors before dropping into the pot towards the end.  Boy...when you type it all out like that it looks like I changed the entire recipe but I FEEL like I followed it almost perfectly!

I add chopped onion. Sautee it with minced garlic and the carrots. Instead of the 5 3/4 c of chicken broth I add approx 4c and one can of beef broth as suggested by others.  It does give it an added kick.  So very yummy!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  this recipe!  Best wedding soup ever!  

Here are the changes I make:  I never add carrots, I add a bay leaf or two and I switch up the ground meat.  I usually use pork and beef.   

This has now become my family favorite and I always have to make a double batch as it never lasts. 

Thanks for sharing!

This is my husband's most requested soup. I've made it for many people and it's always a hit. The only thing I've ever changed is adding more carrots and meatballs. It's scrumptious as is.

My family is Vegetarian, so Instead of using real meat, I used vegetarian meat, used the same method as this recipe but left out the chicken stock and used vegetarian 100% stock. I have tasted italian wedding soup over and over many times so I know the difference in flavor and taste, I had to experiment before changing the ingredients to meet vegetarian flavor but i have to say it was AWESOME! ^-^ Because of the difference in meat, I chose tofu meat. Seasoned it with basil first on the skillet so the flavors can infuse the meat, added some rosemary to add to the texture. I do taste the seasoning and spices before adding.

This was tasty,  easy,  and a great turn out. The reason for four stars is the noodles took over. I plan to reduce to 1/2 cup next time and have extra broth ready.  
Went really well with parmesan crusted garlic bread and red wine.

I gave a 5 rating even though we found it bland for our taste.  It is such a simple basic recipe which I like.  There is no reason to pre-cook the meatballs or orzo.  They cook just fine in the broth.  I only used 1/2 cup orzo.  I added one teaspoon italian seasoning to meatballs, and I used chopped fresh spinach.  Excellent.

I like this recipe but it was a bit bland. I too, used spinach and reduced amount of orzo. 
Tip: if it thickens too much as leftovers I cheat and thin it out with a container of chicken broth or Swanson Tuscany infused broth.

I liked the soup it was good! I did add a few things I added 2 cups of chicken stock and instead of orzo pasta I used Acini di Pepe pasta. To the meatball mix I added 1tsp salt, pepper, and garlic salt to give more flavor!

I liked that this soup was jam-packed full of delicious noodles, veggies and meatballs. It was filling and hearty. The meatballs were particularly tasty and flavourful. However, I thought the soup base was bland and lacking in flavour. I would definitely make this again but next time I will add more herbs and seasonings to make the soup stock as tasty as the other components.

This was very good and SUPER easy to make. I doubled the recipe, might cut back a tiny bit on the orzo next time though. Overall it was great.

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have chicken broth so i made 4 cups of chicken broth with a bullion cube. And Then added 2 cups of beef broth. I also sauteed onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in the pot before adding the chicken and beef broth. I also added spinach instead of the escarole. I used ground turkey because that's what I had on hand. I also added minced garlic and onion in the turkey mixture.I baked the miny meatballs in the oven first then put them in the soup. I also decreased the amount of orzo to 1/2 cup as suggested by the other reviews. I'm glad I cut down on the orzo because a half cup still seemed like a lot. Overall this was a great recipe and I will definitely make this again.

Made it this evening for my family and it was fabulous! I followed several of the previous variations. I added a 1/4 onion to the broth, 2 stalks of celery, 1 boneless skinless, diced chicken breast, browned the meatballs, added 1 cup beef broth and 2 potatoes cut in chunks. It was beyond amazing with multigrain baguette and a salad and a great meal! Will definitely do again and again!

Great soup! I doubled the meatballs (because I had a pound of ground beef to use), used 7 cups broth, 5 stalks of curly kale, chopped, instead of escarole, 1.25 cups melon seed pasta (much like orzo), and a large carrot (maybe .5 cup). Served with more parm on top.

I didn't make this exactly as written so I didn't give it 4 stars because I think it came out perfect with the adjustments I made.  I doubled the recipe, used 1 c. orzo for the entire thing, and did 1/3 beef broth and 2/3 chicken broth.  Also used spinach instead of escarole but that's because that is all I had on hand.  Kids loved the meatballs and my ultra picky 2 year old even at the "green stuff" (Spinach).

This is a delicious soup!  Go easy on the pasta, as it can absorb a lot of the broth.  I used spinach instead of escarole, and veggie broth in place of chicken.  I also cooked the meatballs separately.  This is a go-to recipe for delicious and healthy eating!

I am giving this a 5 even though I think it needs the help of reviews.   I read reviews the first time and used only 1/2 cup and also added beef broth.  Forgot about the reviews the 2nd time and used a whole cup of orzo and no beef broth...the soup was overwhelmed by the orzo.  DEFINITELY use only 1/2 cup of orzo!!! Also flavor is better with some beef broth.  Delicious though, and I am glad I found it.

Followed the suggestions made by others, and it turned out well.  I especially agree that adding a small portion of beef stock to the chicken stock enhances the flavor.  The traditional wedding soup is made with chicken stock however- if you look up the origins of this soup, you will see that the term wedding is not from being served at marriages,  It is from a rough translation meaning the "marriage" of chicken and beef!

The meatballs in the soup had a fantastic taste, I think owing to the Parmesan cheese. The basil had an overpowering flavor, but I liked it. The one downside was that the orzo pasta soaked up the broth, so the next day when I wanted to eat it I had to add water to make it soup, watering the taste down. Definitely could have used bigger and more pieces of carrot.

I made this for dinner, and it's a keeper for us!  Some changes I made by reading the reviews were to add some chopped celery, brown the meatballs and cook the orzo separately.  I used one carton and one can of chicken broth, and my personal taste was to keep the orzo at one cup, since we love pasta.  Next time I will add some garlic powder and pepper to the meatballs.

Soooo tasty! I used thyme instead of basil and it tastes great. Also lightly sauteed some garlic in the pot before adding the liquid. Will definitely make this delicious healthy meal again.

I tried this thinking 10 000 people can't be wrong but it does not work.  It is super greasy.  Cook the meatballs separately and add them at the end and cut the pasta to half.  If you don't you will regret it!

Very good!  I used 6 c. chicken broth and 1 beef as other suggested.  I shredded the carrots (to avoid detection by my kids) and sauteed the onion in a little oil to soften before adding.  Also added a little garlic (hey, Italians put garlic in everything, I think).  Also used spinach in place of the escarole.

Really liked it! I added Tonys Seasonings & 1 tsp. minced garlic to the meatballs to give it a bit more flavor. I too cooked the m/b separetly. Didn't want all that grease. Could of gotten away with any kind of noodle. Maybe would of been better and had more liquid if I used a egg noodle.? Different, filling and overall glad I found this recipe!

I've used this recipe several times and it's really good!!  There is another option: I use fresh spinach instead of escarole, and I also use small chunks of chicken breast as well as the meatballs. My family loves it!!!

Made with turkey meatballs but would try ground chicken next time.  Have made with spinach and escarole and prefer the escarole.  An excellent soup for our family.

AshleyBeGoods advice is correct.  Glad I read your review as I'm in the final stages of cooking it right now and will bake off the grease as suggested.  I have no escarole so I'm using spinach.

quick & easy to make and really tasty! even my picky-eater husband enjoyed it. i just used whatever i had on hand and, surprisingly, it came out really good! i added celery, substituted frozen chopped spinach for the escarole, dried chopped onions for the onion powder and instead of the orzo i used small shell pasta. it was really great for a cold, snowy day.

Good soup. However, mine got extremely dry. It really needs more liquid. Great taste though. I used sage sausage. When I make again I will add more chicken broth.

This was very good!  After reading the other reviews I cooked the pasta and the meatballs before putting them in the soup.  I used beef stock for 1 cup of the chicken stock.  I waited until the last 5 minutes to add the escarole so it didn't get too limp.  What I wish I wish I had done differently was: doubled the carrots and done less pasta.

WONDERFUL recipe. Ended up adding 2 more cups of chicken broth in the end. Definitely cook the meatballs IN the broth-you lose flavor to your soup if you don't! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

What a great, easy soup!  I did use 2 cups of beef broth for part of the chicken broth, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I will be making this often.

I used some beef broth based on the reviews and loved it.  My soup tasted bland the day I made it but perfect the next day.  Wish I didn't add salt!  I also used Jenni-O's lean ground turkey (the one that already had italian seasoning) and it worked perfectly.

My family requests this all the time.  It only uses a 1/2 pound burger, making it economical and good for weight loss.  Leftovers are good but all the liquid get absorbed.

Very good. I used a chicken stock recipe from this site that had been frozen. I cooked the meatballs in the broth for approximately 20 minutes, then followed the instructions to the letter. This was very good and oh so easy!

I just made this recipe and it's delicious!  I used spinach and I had to add more chicken broth 3 cups because the orzo sucked up all the broth...I can't wait for my family to try this.  It's fabulous.  I need to go and get a piece of crusty bread to along with it for dunkin!

I was not a huge fan, but my son loved it. I followed others' suggestions and used some beef broth, cooked the meatballs prior to putting them in the crock pot, and cooked the orzo in a separate pot. This did not taste nearly as good as the soup I had at a restaurant.

I added 2 Bay Leaves, Salt, Pepper & Nutmeg to the soup (authentic & tastey)  Also in my opinion 1 grated Onion makes ALL the difference, and I grate the carrot as well, it all looks more Gourmet Great base though, thanks!

I love Italian Wedding Soup, so I was excited to find this simple recipe. I followed others suggestions and subbed one cup of the broth with beef broth and used ground chicken for the meatballs. I also used fresh spinach bc I couldn't find escarole. I used pastina instead of orzo...orzo just seemed too big. I cooked the pasta seperately and added it to each bowl before serving. It did stick together despite the oil I added to it after draining, but it wasn't hard to "declump" it with a spoon. I would prefer a slightly larger pasta...I forget what the small balls are called, but that's what I'd like. The store was out of them. The soup was very easy, even the meatballs, which I was proud of myself for making. I used my small Pampered Chef scoop to shape them...it worked wonderfully! Next time I'll use ground beef...I think it would add some flavor. The soup was good, but a little bland...I've had better at authentic Italian restaurants. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out really good.  I did as others suggested and baked the meatballs at 325 for 20 minutes.  They turned out really good this way.

This was the first time I made this sopu ever..... it was very good, I went with the ground chicken instead of the beef, and I alos used spinach in stead of escarole.  It was very tasty the only thing I would change is the next time I would cut the orzo down to 1/2 cup.  Will most definately make it again....LOVED IT!!!

Incredible! My family raved about this recipe. I followed it almost exactly with a couple of very minor adjustments. I added about 1/2 tsp of beef bouillion powder to the broth and used spinach instead of escarole. Very yummy - thanks for the recipe.

I've made this a couple of times.  The first time, I made it exactly as written (using spinach instead of escarole) and it was delicious.  Most recently, I subbed beef broth for the chicken broth and again, used spinach.  I also made the meatballs smaller and incorporated a lot of previous reviewers' advice to make it ahead of time so the flavors can set.  Both times, it was super good but I do think that making it ahead of time does add to it.  Perfect for a cold, windy winter night.

WOW! The whole family loved this soup.  I made the meatballs with turkey, but otherwise made as written in the original recipe...they had the perfect amount of spice.  i wouldn't do anything different. (I typically love garlic and forced myself not to add and i'm glad!)  I did saute the sliced carrots b/f adding. i used 4 cups beef and 4 cups chicken broth...yum!

Excellent recipe.  Had the recipe in my box for quite some time, but just recently had an opportunity to make it.  I did make my pasta separately, as I usually do for soups.  I did add 2 teaspoons of beef base (Knorrs) and put a little extra escarole in there.  Family ate it all up, I only got to bowls and I doubled the recipe.  Very excellent, will repeat many times!  Thank you.

With several modifications, I might enjoy this recipe better next time.  Thought it was sort of bland.  Next time I will try turkey instead of beef for meatballs; more seasoning; green onions; and maybe more cheese in the soup.

Delicious soup!!  This is my second time making it. I added about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and used Italian bread crumbs. I used 2 of those 32 ounce boxes of chicken broth and two cups of beef broth (I used a beef bullion cube). I also used 1/2 cup orzo pasta and cooked it for 6 minutes before adding to soup.  I browned the meatballs a little before adding them. Served it with some crusty french bread.

I've made this recipe several times. I use a whole lb. of hamburger and freeze half the meatballs to make a quick and tasty meal later. I've used several types of pasta and they've all worked well for me. I've had no problems boiling it in the broth like others have, but I like to use whole grain pastas. I added some beef broth like another reviewer recommended last time and it was wonderful. I've always cooked the meatballs before adding to the soup so I'm not sure how it would have turned out the way it's written.

My husband loved this soup!  I didn't have onion powder so I used finely chopped onion and I broiled the meatballs before adding to the soup.  I also substituted chopped spinach for escarole.  This will be added to our usual rotation!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

What a great soup!    I followed the suggestions of several other members by using acini de pepe, using ground turkey, adding a little celery, adding a few more carrots, decreasing the pasta to 3/4 of a cup, and cooking the pasta separately.   

My own little addition was to use kale instead of escarole.   I really like kale in soups.   I also browned the meatballs.  

This was just excellent.   It is not a soup that shouts at you (like Zuppa Tuscana).   It soothes you with gentle and delicate and delicious flavors.   Take the time to savor this fine soup.

This is a simple delicious soup that I'm sure I'll be making again.  I used spinach and of course added salt & pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read through what others did and I made some changes to the recipe as well. It turned out fantastic! I subbed 2 cups beef broth, used ground chicken/lean ground beef mixture, added onions to the meatballs and browned the meatballs in the stockpot before adding the broth. I did cook the orzo separately and added to the soup 10 minutes before serving. I think browning the meatballs before adding the broth gave it a richer flavor.

I was very surprised at how good this soup came out!  I did make some changes, such as adding the beef broth - as some of the other reviewers suggested.  My husband loved it!  I will definitely be making this often! Thank you for the recipe.

I too made some changes to this.  I found the soup to be a bit bland, so added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp onion powder to the broth.  I boiled the orzo for 5 minutes in the broth before adding the other items.  I baked the meatballs to help reduce the grease.  I grated the carrots and used 1/3 c while increasing the broth to 7 cups.  Since I used everything out of my pantry vs making a trip to the store, I used one box of frozen spinach thawed and drained.  Worked well with the changes.

This is a really tasty, easy soup to make.  I liked it so much I'm making it again tonight!  I made a couple of adjustments based on previous reviews and my own dietary restrictions - I used ground chicken instead of beef for the meatballs.  I finely diced a shallot and added 1/2 of it to the meatballs instead of onion powder (which I didn't have on hand) - the rest of the shallot and carrot I sauteed in a bit of olive oil first before adding the broth.  I also cooked the orzo separately and added it towards the end.  Thank you for the recipe - I love it when something so simple is so tasty.

This soup was great! I followed the advice of others and only used half of the orzo. I doubled the meatballs and froze half for a later date and used half pork and half beef! It was great, turned out perfect.

Enjoyed this recipe, but combined it w/another on this site.  It was the one that added the 3 eggs with 1 c. parm cheese mixed at the end, just bf serving.  Also, I used 1/3c. small ring pasta,as that is what I had on hand. I sprinkled a bit of lemon pepper in at the end, too.  I will make this again, and may add a can of white beans, just to give it more bulk as the winter descends upon us!Bon Apetite!

Love this recipe.  Some of my own touches...

I too cook the pasta seperately, and reduce to 1/2 cup. I also add celery and onions along with the carrots. I add some garlic and worchester sauce to the meat. One final step at the very end is to add a beaten egg and stir it very quick.  My mom always made it with an egg, so I thought why not.

This soup was very easy to put together. I substituted spinach for the escarole and ground turkey for the ground beef.  Some say that the soup was bland, but I think it simply had a mild flavor that was very comforting on a cold day!

Made this soup for supper tonight. It was good, my family raved about it.  I don't know if it was supposed to come out on the thick side but mine did but we like a thick soup anyway. The only change I made was I used kale instead of escarole (not sure what escarole is).

Really, really good!  Used half the amount of rice pasta, based on other reviews and it was just enough.  Used frozen kale in place of the escarole.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay.  The meatballs were a bit bland and I ended up using way too much spinach since I was measuring frozen spinach.  But it was decent.

This was an easy recipe that produced great results.  My grocery was out of escarole so I subbed in fresh spinach.  I also added minced fresh garlic to the meatballs and heeded the advice from previous reviews and only use 1/2 cup of acini de pepe instead.

Excellent flavor and very easy to make.  I used ground turkey breast for the meatballs.  I will definately keep this one handy!

Even using homemade chicken stock, this soup was very bland and disappointing.  Nobody ate the leftovers.  I won't make this again.

I followed this recipe (mostly) and 3 other ones. The soup was delicious. I used half ground beef and half ground chicken for the meatballs and baked them while I sauteed the carrots to soften them. Will definitely make again.

This was my first attempt at making meatballs, so I was a little hesitant. I did brown them a little before starting like others had suggested and I also doubled the recipe (boys in the house ^_^). It came out soo delicious we cant wait to have it tomorrow for lunch!!!

This was delicious.  I used my own meatball recipe and sauteed them in olive oil and butter first.  Added a sprinkle parsley and shredded parmesan before serving.

Excellent soup!  My boyfriend is addicted to this soup.  Instead of beef I used turkey which turned out great- just need to add a little more seasoning and it's awesome.  No more 1030pm Safeway runs to hunt down this soup!

This is a great soup, and very easy especially because you don't have to pre-cook the meatballs.  I usually make about a 15 quart pot and can it for the winter.  My family loves it.  As a matter of fact, my son had to come up with a favorite recipe for a cookbook for his kindergarten class and this is the one he chose.

This was wonderful! I did cheat on it though.  I used premade, frozen Itailian seasoned meatballs that I had.  I also used 2 cans chicken broth and 2 cans Italian seasoned chicken broth. I added 2 cups water. Also used spinach instead of escarole. I wanted more veggies, so I did about 1 cup of carrot. 
I plan on making this again for sure!

My husband and I love wedding soup and this recipe was great! I added a couple chicken boullion cubes and some more water, as it needed some more broth. I also used spinach because I like it better. It was easy and excellent!! I will definately make this again!

I made this for my in-laws and they loved it. I used an extra can of broth, and tortellini instead of orzo pasta. It was even better in my opinion because I love the larger taste of pasta. I will definitely make this again!

i found omitting the carrot and putting a few plum tomatoes in the broth gives it a better flavor. Slice the tomatoe open so juices can release. Just pull the chunks of tomatoes out before serving.

Not that flavorful.  I prefer the canned variety to this.  The meatballs were too mushy for my taste and it just wasn't very good.

I'm thrilled to finally have a recipe for wedding soup.  My husband loves it.  I did add some garlic and used spinach instead of the escarole.  The meatballs started off nice and small but I admit they got bigger as I went along.  At least I have some in the freezer now for the next batch of this soup.  Thanks.

This turned out pretty well.  I precooked the acini de pepe and meatballs as was suggested in previous reviews.  This made prep very convenient as I was able to refrigerate all of the prepared ingredients and then add them to the soup when I was ready.  I thought that the broth was lacking something...maybe it was the type of broth that I purchased?  My final opinion is that it is good, I will try it again, but it wasn't as good as the stuff I get at local restaurants.

My husband loved it, but the broth was a bit bland for my taste. Next time, I will add more seasoning.

This recipe was tops.  I followed some advice from previous reviews that were to my own liking.  Next time I will use just 1 cup of the acini de pepe.  I found that some of my friends could of done without the pasta all together.  But the taste was phenominal.  I also used spinach and I don't think anyone could really tell the difference.

Good flavor.  I didn't decrease the amount of pasta as some others suggested, since I like a thick soup.  For left-overs, I'll just add some more broth.  I couldn't find escarole so I used spinach...and should have added more than was called for.  Thanks for sharing Star.

This is a very good soup.  I added more seasoning to the meatballs.  I used spinach, instead of the escarole.

This soup is good.  Definately only use half the pasta and serve as soon as it's done.  The pasta will absorb all the broth.  Next time I will add more escarole to it.  I sprinkled parmesan on the soup before serving.

This soup was delicious.  I added diced zucchini and onions to the broth, sauteed first in garlic clove and olive oil.  It was fantastic.  My husband is not a soup fan but he loved this one!

Wonderful soup!  A big hit at a recipe exchange party I hosted!  Very simple to throw together. My only "complaint" was there was too little broth in this soup with the orzo.  I couldn't find escarole at my store, so I used a small amount of parsley instead.  The flavor of the soup is WONDERFUL!  As are the meatballs!  I will definately make this again, maybe just decrease the pasta some.  Thank you for sharing it!

This soup was DIVINE!  It doubled nicely and I also added celery!  Wanted to try it with the lower fat chicken broth but that wasn't on sale so it was quite rich but worth it!

Excellent! One of my favorite recipes. I double the recipe. I prefer to use Acine di Pepe pasta instead of Orzo. I like both though. Sometimes I also add chopped celery and chicken. My kids, (7 & 9) who were leary of eating it because they saw me put escarole in it...asked for seconds! Everyone that has tasted it loves it!

I have only had 1 kind of Italian wedding soup, and LOVE it.  This wasn't it, but was okay.  I think the kind of stock used makes a big difference, and probably more would be better.

This soup is awesome.  I varied from the recipe a little, adding celery and baking the meatballs.  I will definitely make this again although probably on a weekend - rolling the meatballs is very time consuming.

I used some chicken stock that I had made previously.  This soup is delicious!  Next time, I will cut the amount of pasta in half.  The recipe calls for 1 cup uncooked, but I prefer a more "brothy" soup, so I will use less.  

I served this at a dinner party and everyone RAVED about it!

Loved the recipe! Don't plan on saving leftovers, though... the pasta tends to, well, take over the soup, as it keeps on expanding even after you are finished cooking.

Mind you, with this recipe, you probably won't have any leftovers, anyhow!

I LOVED this soup!  I used spinach instead of escarole, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The only thing that takes time is making the meatballs, but I did a large batch and froze the rest.....made it a snap to make it the second and third and forth time.

This tasted better than the wedding soup we've ate at restaurants. I cooked the orzo separately and added to individual servings. I also baked the meatballs ahead of time for twenty minutes and used fresh spinich.

This is probably the best soup I have ever tasted or made.  The broth turned out to be unbelievably flavorful after simmering.  I cooked the pasta separately and added to each serving as suggested below and could not have been happier with the results. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This recipe was loved by all and I even got requests for the recipe from others!  If you make a large batch, I would recommend cooking the Orzo seperately and putting how much you want into each bowl, so that you can save the leftover soup for another meal.  Store the cooked orzo seperately from the leftover soup.  The orzo swells up very quickly, absorbing the liquid.  This soup is delicious.

This soup is really the best.Use the amount of orzo indicated only if you don,t plan to have any leftovers or cook orzo on the side and add in.
I made meatballs a little smaller and escarole worked just fine. Great dish all together!

I've made this several times. It's a family favorite. It's the best I've tasted since Grandma's.  My oldest son loves it! He even took the recipe to college with him.

This soup is the best! I added chopped celery and used less pasta to make it more soupy!! Or if I have leftover chicken, I add that also. My whole family loves this, especially in the winter months!!

Great recipe - for some reason Italian cookbooks ignore this soup....but I would use 1/2 cup
acini di pepe as the pasta.  I also added 1/3 cup chopped celery.

My family loved this recipe.  A week after I made it we went to Eastside Mario's,  their equivalent of this soup came as part of my son's meal.  My son said he was disappointed in the soup.  It wasn't half as good as mine.  Yes!!!

This is a very good and tasty soup! I made it after work for dinner last night.  It does take a little time to prepare the meatballs though and to chop the spinach. I served it with warmed Focaccia tomato bread. My boy friend Richard said that this was an awesome meal and definitely a keeper.

I made this for the first time on Easter.  My husband and I had had it before but my guests were delighted.  It was better than any I had tasted.  It has become a family favorite, and I like that it is so simple to make.  Thank you for sharing with us. Lori M.

This is really a wonderful soup, hearty
 enough for a winter meal, and yet light
enough for s summer meal as well.  Super
simple to prepare, to make it a little 
quicker, I use a few handfuls of frozen
spinach instead of fresh and chop the 
carrots in a food processor.  But fresh
spinach is the best, if you have it.

Great soup recipe! We loved it. I made meatballs up in the AM and cooked the soup later and added them them.  Had time to firm up.  I also used some dried onion flakes and a little garlic powder in the soup.
