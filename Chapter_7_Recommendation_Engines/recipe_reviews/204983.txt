Christine, I am SO excited to be the first reviewer of your recipe so that I can give it a good jump start by showering it with the praise it deserves! The recipe, granted, is very involved for a muffin and requires a lot of ingredients. Maybe this unfortunately makes people pass it by. But here is a perfect example of how the effort you put into something is SO worth the results! As the first reviewer I felt a responsibility to strictly stick to the recipe and other than using full fat sour cream and skipping the optional Parmesan topping, I did. As these were baking (mine only took 30 minutes) the aroma was so good it truly was making my mouth water - and I'm not being dramatic to stress a point! Healthy, flavorful ingredients and flecked with lovely colors, but the true test would be the taste test. You have outdone yourself! They are perfect! Moist, great texture, beautiful, and such a unique flavor! You have this recipe down pat, and I would strongly encourage others not only to try these, but to make them exactly as the recipe directs - that means no shortcuts, no changes, no substitutions or deletions. I can't imagine how this recipe could be improved upon the perfection it already is. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe produces a wonderfully delightful muffin!  I must say, it is very time consuming, and took me way more than the 25 minute prep time indicated.  But if you do have the time, these are well worth it.  I made 1/2 a batch and now wished I made the whole thing.  Mine came out perfectly beautiful after 32 minutes.  I'll definitely make these again and might try making them in stages.  I think I'd  prep the zucchini mixture a day ahead, cover and refrigerate it.  And the dry ingredients could easily be combined a day ahead.  This is a wonderful recipe, so do give it a try.  Just plan ahead!

Exactly what I’ve been looking for!  Savory, flavorful, moist, and satisfying.  Two of these make for a perfect snack/lunch on the go.  I followed the recipe pretty exact with only a few modifications—added a handful of seeds (mix of flax, sunflower, and pumpkin), added an additional 1T of milk since my mixture seemed a tad on the dry side (maybe from the seed addition), and used herbs de Provence since I didn’t have dried basil and parsley.  Unlike other reviewers mine were perfectly baked at 38 min.  I will definitely make these again, and maybe try other vegetable/cheese combinations—spinach, tomato, feta sounds goods.  Thanks for the recipe.

Marvelous muffins!  I could not stop eating them!  I sauteed the zucchini and broccoli until slightly tender. I used Greek yogurt and buttermilk and then proceeded with the recipe. I baked it for 25-30 mins. Definitely A+ recipe. I will make these tender, moist, delicious morsels again! Thanks Christina!

Certainly a 5* - takes more time but worth every bit of the effort. Didn't change anything except to substitute yogurt for sour cream bcos I didn't have any. Made it for church brunch & everyone was surprised at how tasty it is.

this is a really good recipe. Muffins are tasty, moist and fragrant.
 I strictly followed the recipe except for the red peppers I can't eat; I substituted them with about 70 grams of minced speck, a typical italian smoked prosciutto.
as others suggested I mixed the parmigiano cheese into the batter.
I'll do these again!

These are really good! I substituted the whole wheat flour with an equal amount of all-purpose as I never have the latter on hand. Worked fine! I realize the Parmesan topping is optional, but went for it. It gets way too brown for our liking. I will omit it next time or try another cheese mixed into the batter. This would be great with olives and feta too.

Can't stop eating these. I was pressed for time so didn't saute the garlic and onions, reduced the onion to 1/4  cup finely chopped and mixed in with the zucchini, also  mixed the parmesan cheese in the batter.

Good but.......  They lacked zip, so with the roasted red peppers, etc in the food processor we added one seedless and deveined jalapeno pepper, another 1/2-1 tsp salt, a handful of parmesan cheese and replaced 1/2 c all purpose flour with 1/2 c nutritional yeast (not brewers or quick rise yeast) (available at most health food stores).  Delicious.

If you're looking to impress, this recipe's for you.  As these baked, the kitchen smelled like a true Italian Bistro. The ingredients list  is long and it takes a little more time to put together, but well worth the effort.  The muffins turned out moist and tasty.

These muffins lived up to all the rave reviews.  My only change was to use a little yellow squash for some of the zucchini.

These muffins are wonderful - a bit time consuming but worth it.  I cut the recipe in half (as there were only two of us eating) and got 9 muffins.  Wish I would have made the whole batch because I bet they would freeze well.  After cooking the onion and garlic, I threw the zucchini (and a little shredded carrot) into the pan for a couple of minutes to soften and then transferred to a strainer to cool.  Did not pulse veggies in a food processor as the bits were already small.  Mixed everything else as directed.  I was tempted to add more moisture as the batter seemed a bit stiff but I didn't, and they turned out wonderful.  These would be great with soup or chili.  Will definitely make these again!

It was lucky these were as yummy as they were after all the prep and washing up they create...! I love that they can be altered without too much trouble. I did according to the recipe this time but next time I am going to add some crumbled feta and wont blitz the veges as I like 'finding' pieces of the veges as I eat. I got 12 regular size and 20 mini muffins from the mix. Cooked the mini for 13 mins and the large for 30 mins.

I did not have sun dried tomatoes or peppers. I did not shred the zucchini first because it was going into the food processor anyway and it worked great. My kids loved these. I made them as mini muffins so they could just pop them in their mouths. They were a little bland, but will definitely make them again.

These are DELICIOUS!  Was cooking for someone who's allergic to milk:  substituted butter for olive oil, 1 cup Oatley Cuisine for the milk and sour cream and left out the parmesan cheese on the ones for our guest and it still turned out fabulous!  This was a great way to get my kids enthusiastic about zucchini!  Thank you so much!

**Update: Just made the recipe with all the dairy called for and it's fantastic this way as well!  Couldn't even wait for it to cool down before eating one-- they smell AMAZING while they're baking!

Great recipe - used 1/2 cup nonfat yogurt instead of the butter and none of the oil. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and added 1 tbs. of flax seed to the mixture and it turned out just great. I got 20 muffins out of the recipe and calculated it at about 95 calories per muffin. I love it when I find a recipe that still tastes good using lower cal substitutions! I am sure that the original recipe tastes much better, tho!

This is a good recipe, easily modified.

I doubled the herbs and some powdered garlic and extra sea salt....otherwise these would have been bland for my tastes.  Also used organic full fat yogurt rather than sour cream and almond milk rather than dairy.

Also used veggies I had on hand... broccoli  + fresh bell pepper instead of dried tomatoes & roasted red pepper (sauteed with other beg)

I made them into mini muffins (4 dozen)... Baked for 25 minutes.  

Turned out yummy. :)

Made a few changes as suggested in other reviews such as 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Added 1/2 tbsp parmesan garlic dip seasoning from Epicure Selections and substituted 1/4 cup salsa for 1/4 of milk (so used 3/4 cup milk) Added in crushed chilies (about 1/2 tsp). So looking forward to having it with chili tonight.

These were a lot of effort, but a nice change from sweet zucchini bread recipes.  I used all white flour because I was out of whole wheat. I left out the red pepper and doubled the sun-dried tomato.  I didn't puree the ingredients, just finely minced. I also put the parmesan into the batter rather than on top.  Very adaptable, and the best savory zucchini bread recipe I've tried. Thanks!

Okay, these are great! They came out just as I was hoping they would too.  I really wanted to stick to the recipe exactly (as first reviewer suggested) but there were a few items I did not have on hand.  So, I used grated carrot and zucchini to make up the 1.5 cups. Used 2 cups whole wheat and 1.5 cup white (didn't have cornmeal) and the texture was still great.  Also, used fresh basil instead of dried and white cheddar mixed in instead of parm.  These are really so yummy, thank you!

I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I just quartered and sauteed them with the onions until all the juice was gone. I also subst. fresh basil from my garden & chopped that with the zucchini ...didn't bother to shred or drain that either. No hot sauce, so I subst. red pepper flakes. Subst. non-fat yogurt for the sour cream and olive oil for the butter. I did throw in a bit of parmesan, too.  Inspite of all the substitutions, the muffins turned out moist & flavorful!

Good muffin but a bit bland. The second time I made them (adjusted to a recipe for 11) I doubled the salt, mixed the parmesan in, and added 1/4 cup Kalamata olives.  I also didn't pulse the zucchini. Still a bit dull and definitely not salty enough.  Doubling the sundried tomatoes, olives, and hot sauce might help, and/or using a lot more or stronger cheese (feta?).  I did use Greek yogurt in place of all the sour cream and two tbs of the butter and split the flour evenly between white and while wheat -- those changes worked well. As always since I live at 7000 ft. I had to make high altitude adjustments (the recipe adapted well to those adjustments).  (Note that the first time I made them, I subbed sundried tomato pesto for the tomatoes -- not a good substitution at all, so I made sure I had the tomatoes on hand the second time.)

DELECTABLE!  My house smelled heavenly while baking.  Wouldn't change a thing; however, I did use roasted garlic because I had some in the fridge.  Some of my ingredients were a smidgen over because after chopping and measuring, it just worked about that way.  Was 1/4+ cup over with the zucchini and did not squeeze; never do--didn't seem to make any difference.  Didn't have any whole wheat flour, used AP, but could see how it might add a little nuttiness.  Stirred the Parmesan into the dry ingredients; and added the zucchini mix with the last half of the flour mix to minimize stirring.     Mixed and chopped everything by hand.  Filled the pan with 2 medium cookie scoops for each cup.  They were golden and passed the toothpick test at 35 minutes. I adjusted the recipe for 9 servings because I only had the one 12-cup pan;  sprayed with Pam, and everything easily fell out of the pan.  Luckily for me I have more zucchini and will be making another batch real soon--like in a couple of days.  Christine, I bet people love coming to your house for dinner.  The flavors are amazing.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  These would be great as a mini-muffin appetizer for a party.  Might try a little bacon next time?

I am making these for the second time today. I had brought them in for work and tomorrow we are having another celebration where I was forced to bring them again. No real force needed since they are indeed very good.

I didn't have sun dried tomatoes nor peppers but I improvised and added extra cheese, which I incorporated into the batter. I skipped the food processor part because I too like bits of veggies to be present so that step isn't crucial. One thing I would change next time-because there will be a next time , these are tasty!- I will also skip the sugar, not necessary and made them a tad too sweet for me. Great recipe that I will play with, for sure!

I used yoghurt instead of sour cream but otherwise just exactly the way it was described - and like others, took me longer to prepare. Perhaps with future use of recipe time will improve.

I replaced the zucchini with carrot pulp from my juicer (which worked well, as it was already dried out from the juicer). Not bad. Enjoy a glass of fresh carrot juice, then make some muffins. Delicious.
