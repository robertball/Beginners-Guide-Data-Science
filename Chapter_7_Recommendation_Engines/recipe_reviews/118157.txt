Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe to a tee, except for microwaving the potatoes, (since I wasn't in a big hurry) just slice potatoes, follow the recipe, and bake for 1 hour.  Easy & delicious!

Krista, I don't even know how to begin to tell you how totally AMAZING this dish was. This is coming from an almost non potato eating person, however, I could not stop munching on them! I did make a few changes, but nothing that would majorly change the flavor. I used four T. of butter instead of the six, regular onions in lieu of the green which I ended  up mixing with the bacon and plopping it on top of each layer. Garlic and onion powders, plus some dry mustard. Normally I use my mandolin to thinly slice my potatoes and cook them in the casserole raw, but they take FOREVER! I was interested in that you used the microwave, but I chose to peel the taters and boil them until just fork tender. I also let them cool completely before I sliced them. I enjoy mixing the Velvetta with a good cheddar, which in this case was a horseradish cheddar. I've made many a scalloped potato dish and by far this was truly the winner of all time. Will never go back to any other recipe. Thank you so much for making all six of us very happy!!

Very rich but absolutely delicious! I left out the bacon and used cheddar instead of Velveeta. The garlic powder and green onions really lift the flavours. Will be making this again for sure.

To answer the question: Don't peel the potatoes before mircrowaving them...they turn black and brown. On the second batch with the skins on, I put them in a bath of cold water and the skins peeled right off (I don't care for skins). 

I left out the bacon too, because it was a side dish to ham. I also added dry mustard for some zing.

I topped with colby jack and buttered bread crumbs. Can't believe there is Velveta in this! It was creamy, cheesy, buttery goodness. 

My family won't forgive me if I don't bring this for the next holiday dinner. Thanks!

This was an awesome recipe.  It wasn't clear in recipe but I just left skin on potatoes and it was fine that way.  I also added some fresh parmesan to the shredded cheddar sprinkled on top and it added a nice dimension.

Loved it!  I took some advise from other reviews and came up with using half processed cheese and half cheddar cheese for the sauce.  I did add 1/4 tspn of Cayenne pepper and used fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  Thanks!

This one is wonderful.  Over the years I have tried many recipes and all of them seem watery. Baking the potatoes in the microwave seems to eliminate this problem as the extra moisture evaporates before it goes into the sauce.
I will add a little more seasoning next time as it was just a touch flat for us. I'm thinking just 1/4 tsp. cayanne pepper might be perfect. Yummmmmmmy !

i made this for christmas dinner & it was a hit! the recipe did not say whether or not to peel the potatoes. i left the peels on & everyone loved them! one thing i would change is the amount of sauce. it didn't seem to have enough. i would probably increase by 25-40% depending on how saucy you like your scalloped potatoes. but my overall rating is 4 stars.

OMG!  I couldn't stop licking the pan as I was making these.  I used only 4 tbsp. butter (5 tbsp. flour), 2% Velveeta, and 2% milk to cut back on the fat a little.  I used large red potatoes, added 5 cloves of minced garlic to the butter (a must in my opinion), and some dashes of green Tabasco.  Delicious, try these out!!!

This was the best online recipe I have ever tried. This came out so delicious and flavorful. I received so much great response on how delicious this was. I do agree it probably could have used a bit more pepper, but even without it is still a great recipe. While making the sauce you can taste it before pouring it on the potatoes and adjust how much pepper you may want to add to it. I did not microwave the potatoes and I left the skin on. I prepared the sauce in the same saucepan that I cooked the bacon in. I didn't have process cheese so I just substitued that with about a cup of shredded cheese and grated parmesan cheese. I didn't have anymore cayenne pepper so I used  black pepper as needed. Running low on green onions, so along with the green onions, I diced up (as small as possible) half a bell pepper and add that ontop. If you do not microwave the potatoes it will take an hour before these potatoes are done, but I had plenty of time so I decided not to microwave them. I did not layer these potaoes I simply place in a baking dish and pour the sauce over it and ensured that the potatoes where well coated with the sauce. This was an excellent recipe that I will be making again and it is definitely well worth trying.

Deee-lish!  While the butter was melting, I added fresh garlic (4 cloves) before I added the flour.  Also, used a brick of cream cheese instead of the velveeta.  Definitely takes longer to prepare than stated, but worth it.  Next time, I'd use my slicer and slice the potatoes before microwaving them.  In fact, I think I'd make them from raw next time.  Easier to slice and then just bake as they tend to fall apart and not keep the 'scalloped' look if done in the microwave that way.  Even my hubby liked these and he's not a potato fan.  Bacon always helps.  From scratch, just bake an hour like you usually do.  Yummmy.

YES YES YES!!!!!only thing I did differently is slice the potatoes thin, chop the onion, skip the microwaving and baked it 350 for an hour or until done (poke with fork)

Make sure you make it in a deep enough 9x13 pan- it bubbled over and made a bit of a mess in the oven. Also, next time I would add only 1/4 t. salt, since it was a bit salty, and add more bacon. Overall, a very good potato recipe!

Wow, This is great. I read the other reviews and so changed things for us and it was to die for. Best comfort food I have eaten in a while...

The potatoes I used my pampered chef slicer(unpeeled), then dropped them in boiling water and boiled them for 5 minutes. Drained.  PERFECT.  

The recipe. I followed it but increased these: 2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper(instead of what it called for). Reduced the velvetta to 8 oz. AND I LEFT OUT THE CHEDDAR CHEESE AS I can promise you this is enough cheese! And I used regular onions and fried them in the left over bacon grease.  And I left that grease in my recipe. Oh man was this so good! YUMMMOOOOOOO... I did bake it for 25 minutes instead of the 15.  

The best I have ever eaten. If I could of I would of given this a 10!.... LOVE IT!  Thanks for sharing it with everyone!

My, my, my...just make it.  Trust me.  It's PHENOMENAL!  :) 
The color is excellent, the aroma filling the house is nice and the flavor is outstanding.  Cannot say enough good things about this and neither could anyone I made it for.  Definitely a meal maker.  ;)
I'd suggest breaking this out when you have a fairly boring meal and need a side.  Sometimes a boring meal can exceed it's potential when a truly delicious side is added.  This is definitely a dish for the occassion.  ;)

Made this for friends the other night.  Note:  when changing the number of servings the length of time microwaving the potatoes changes.  Just microwave the potatoes until done.  Wonderful, delicious. Made with Cheddar Cheese exclusively.  Very Good

Wow! This was awesome! It was just like my moms recipe, except faster (thanks the microwaving), and the velveeta in the roux.  I made two adjustments, I left out the bacon ( I was serving it with roast beef, I didn't think the meal needed more meat) and I left out the onions because my fiance hates them. Try it!  I made this late at night and it was done in a snap! Thanks! Will make this over and over.

Not only did it look great but it tasted great.  I omitted the processed cheese, used 1 3/4 cups of milk, and added 1 can of cream mushroom soup and 1 cup of sour cream. Then sprinkled bacon bits and chives on top for flavor and appeal. Yum :0)

I made this for our Easter dinner instead of my usual scalloped potatoes. The family loved them! Everyone had at least second helpings. I made a roast pan of them and everyone took leftovers home with them.

This was soo good. I added onion powder instead of onion and cooked ham instead of bacon as I was trying to use up some ham. I also skipped the microwaving of the potatoes and baked for 1 hour then removed the tin foil and baked 15 more minutes.

Very delicious but rich.  The velveeta really takes this sauce up a notch.  I personally felt that the cheddar on top of the final layer wasn't all that necessary - this is a very heavy dish to begin with and the cheddar almost makes this a bit too greasy... It's all personal preference.

The sauce would be perfect for a fondue sauce as well - maybe not with velveeta but I could see mixing in other gourmet cheese.

I also used precooked thick sliced bacon - cooked in the micro for 1 min and then let it rest.  Crumbles perfectly without the greasy mess.

My family loved this recipe for Christmas day.  Goes great with just about anything!

Other than leaving out the bacon (because I was serving with ham) I followed the instructions exactly. It was good, but i don't care for the velveeta (personal preference). If I make this again, I will look for a alternative to the processed cheese.

The sauce came out a bit thick for my liking, so I plan to add sour cream among the layers of the dish mixture next time. Also, I used ham instead of bacon in mine, and it tasted nice.

The taste was very good, I baked mine in the oven, and had a little problem, it was my not not the recipes. I cut the potatoes to thin, and it came out soupy, we ate it, and I put the left overs in the fridge for the next day, so would I did, since the potatoes were basically nothing, I added some hash browns with peppers and onion, a can a cheese soup, some more sour cream, and more cheese, baked it, and it was a really good Hash brown casserole for our family. I will try this again, and see if I can fix the soupyness, and cut the potatoes thicker this time! Thanks for the good recipe!

Good Job, Krista.  Just used this recipe as written for a dinner for 70, and it's the BOMB!  I wondered about leaving the skins on, but it worked fine.  No matter how you do it, you can't miss with this recipe.  I may bake the potatoes in the oven next time.

These potatoes were absolutely delish!! I added ham so we could use it as a main dish. There was none leftover! I didn't microwave the potatoes first, but did bake covered for 40 minutes then uncovered for the last few minutes while the cheese melted. Very good, will make again.

Holy Smoke!  This was AMAZING!  I doubled this recipe for a big BBQ we were having and it was a smash hit.  I used red potatoes and 2 whole pounds of Velveeta.  There was a lot of potatoes left over but I am glad I doubled it since we have been munching on this for left overs!  Thank you for sharing!

Made this for dinner one night.  Husband and I both enjoyed it.  I made 1/3 recipe as there is just the two of us. I am planning on making this for Easter dinner with pork tenderloins.  It will be something different for the family.  We didn't feel the bacon added anything to the taste so will probably omit it next time.  It does make an attractive casserole.

All I can say is this was so good! The only thing I did differently was add a half packet of onion soup mix and 1oz of garlic cream cheese to the sauce. These were wonderful. I only had about 45 minutes to get dinner on the table so I microwaved the potatoes and placed everything in the oven to finish on 350 and Broil, not Bake! It was great. Thanks for sharing!It was a huge hit!

Made with the Easter ham,I eliminated the bacon because of that.  I don't know if that is what made this bland tasting. My grandkids loved it tho'  I would definetly spice it up next time.

I did not microwave mine, but like another reviewer, left peels on, baked 1 hr covered, then 15 uncovered.  I did not use bacon (since served with ham), and didn't include cheese on the top- too greasy. I think the bacon would be great though!  Very good recipe, easy to follow and everyone loved it.  Better than the normal scalloped potatoe recipe!

Yummy. Used cream cheese since I didn't have velveta. Added sauteed onions/garlic to sauce, sour cream and chives. Added extra garlic, onion powder. Hubby said it tasted like crab cakes.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I microwaved the potatoes a little longer.  I should have done it even longer because the pototes weren't cooked through, even after cooking it inthe oven for more than the 15 minutes recommended.

This is a great recipe.  The only things I changed were to boil the potatoes till slightly done, let them cool and rice them.  It makes a lot, lot, lot so have a crowd to feed to have lots of leftovers.  I did add a little extra bacon (1/2c) and green onions (1/3).  Adding 3 large cloves of fresh garlic helps also.
Making the sauce takes a while since you can't turn the heat up high or it'll burn on the bottom.

Made this with prime rib for the holidays this year. This was my second time making this. It is an absolutely delicious receipe, but so rich so I only have made if twice in the past year. I used queso blanco velveeta and extra sharp white cheddar. I also added more bacon than called for and I added chopped green onions to the whole thing, not just the top. I do not like messing around with a microwave and 8 large potatoes, so I just peeled and sliced the potatoes and baked at 350 for one hour. They turn out PERFECT cooking like that and the cheese is bubbling and brown on top. Mom asked for the recipe... which isn't usual!!

I made this just as directed ,except for the green onion (didn't have any on hand) and they were fantastic. I left the skins on the potatoes after cooking in microwave and just sliced them to put in the casserole.  Really liked it with the skins left on. My son asked why I hadn't made these potatoes before!

I took the advice of others and added a little cayenne pepper. Also, I did not want to microwave my potatoes so as other reviews mentioned, I followed the recipe except, I placed the potatoes raw in pan and cooked for one hour. It turned out great. It was not too soupy as others had reported.

Thank you for this delicious recipe! I followed it exactly except I boiled the potatoes for about 20 mins and the followed the recipe just cooking for about 30 mins.  Everyone in my house loves them which is NOT an easy feat! Thank you!

I have been trying different recipes from this sight for several months now and this is my 1st time to comment. These potatoes were GREAT! I loved the flavor and the texture. They were very creamy and quick..... Thanks!

I loved that you used the microwave to speed this dish up however I felt that it compromised the end flavor of the potatoes.  I also didn't like the consistency of the sauce.  It was too thick and even after thinning it a bit there was just a heavy flour taste.  Would recommend using less flour to thicken this.  The addition of bacon and green onions made it feel like a baked potato which I liked.  I will try this again but I will tweek it a bit...Thanks for sharing.

I couldn't find my standard recipe for scaolloped potatoes using velveeta so I decided to try this.  I'm glad I did.  The flavor was great.  I didn't have bacon or green onions which would have made it even better.  I did top with a bread crumb/parm. cheese/butter mixture.

What a wonderful recipe. My husband and kids (ages 5-15) absolutely loved it too. I did layer it with hamburger meat. I cooked the onions in with the meat and drained the meat and kept the rest of the recipe the same. The potatoes needed to be cooked a bit longer though. I will definately cook this again and soon!

This turned out very well!  We used Velveeta's Jalapeno cheese and threw in a few sliced jalapenos on the side for the spicy-lovers.  I was a bit frustrated with the microwaving, but I think with practice, I'll get better.  Just remember to turn and move the potatoes while in the microwave - or they won't cook evenly.  The men even got excited about making this one.  :D

My guests thought this was delicious...the only thing I tweaked is that I added 1/2 t. mustard powder to the spice mix, and it made a good difference.  If you're using russets and microwaving them first, don't be disheartened by the leathery look of the skin when you start to cut them up, and don't be tempted to peel them.  The skins sort of disappeared in the finished product, and I think they added a texture that was a positive addition.

Oh my goodness!! These are so awesome! I added a sauteed jalapeno for a little bite and I increased the amount of black pepper. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I would give this a 3 as is. My husband said 4. I thought it was too much Velveeta. So next time I will also follow the other reviewers advise and cut back on the cheese. Hubby also said it could use more garlic..so I will add more of that as well. Thank you for this recipe!

fantastic, creamy flavor! I left out bacon (served with ham)and it was plenty flavorful!
must cool potatoes after microwaving before slicing, or they will fall apart (I ran mine under cold water to speed up cooling process and firm up a bit). wonderful recipe!

We absolutely love this recipe!  I saute some onion in a bit of garlic oil and layer them over the potatoes before spreading the cheese sauce. I also used 6 oz of velveeta and 6 ounces of sharp chddar for an extra kick (instead of all processed cheese).  In a pinch, real bacon bits work fine which is what I had to do when I didn't have any bacon strips in the house. Thank you for sharing this recipe as I've added it to our list of favorites. Wanted to eat the cheese sauce like soup the first time I made it - so yummy. Makes an excellent side dish with ham.  May want to leave out the bacon bits if you are serving it this way...

I'm giving the original recipe a 4 star, but it definitely became five star after a few changes suggested by other reviews.  Instead of microwaving potatoes, I sliced them and parboiled just until starting to become fork tender.  I only did 2 layers.  Used half Velveeta and half sharp cheddar.  Added onion powder.  These were so good with steak!

This was good. I did not use bacon and I added onion powder. Very easy to make. I halved the receipe and only made 2 layers in a 9x13 and it still made a very large portion. I used 2% velveta and 2% milk.

This was a good side dish. I used the microwave method, but next time I think I'll just peel and slice the potatoes and then boil them for a few minutes. I'll definately make this again.

I brought this dish to an outdoor party.  Everybody loved it.  I left the peels on and didn't add bacon.  I also double the sauce to make sure I had enough.  What I didn't use for the dish I saved and used it to make really creamy mashed potatoes one night, and twice-baked potatoes another.

I think this should have a different name, something like quick twice loaded potatoes, the sauce was so thick and heavy that it overpowered all other flavors, not the sauce I expected from something titled scalloped potatoes

These were Excellent !!  So easy to make and microwaving the potatoes 1st was a great tip to save time. The flavor was wonderful. I did sneak in a 1/2 c of whipping cream just to give them a creamy texture since I only use skim milk in my cooking.

My family loves the box au gratin potatoes. I made this recipe for easter dinner and my older son was the first to say "Mom these are better that the other stuff you make."  I will be making this recipe from now on.  The only changes I will make will be more cheddar cheese and more bacon.  Great recipe. Thank you!!

This casserole was delicious!  It takes a lot of work (I was fortunate enough to ahve a friend helping me; I don't know how I would've done this on my own)  The cheese sauce needs to be "babysat" because it takes a while for all the cheese to melt.  THe only modification I made was using fat free milk and mixing the cheddar right into the sauce.  Everyone loved these and I will most likely make again.  Thanks!

I cut my potatoes into thick slices and microwaved in a covered casserole dish with a little water. Takes about 8 minutes. Then drain & stirred in all the rest of ingredients and topped with shredded cheese and baked. Excellent.

This was great!  I will cut the potatoes a little thinner.  If you cut 1/4" thick you may wanna keep it in the oven longer to have the sauce stick more and to be sure the potatoes get a little softer in the middle.  Also my potatoes were LARGE, so I had at least 1-2 potatoes left over as the pan wasn't big enough.  Definitely need to let the potatoes cool before slicing.  I'll be making this again!

An excellent dish that everyone enjoyed.  Next time I think I'll pre-cook the potatoes as some of them were still hard.  Also, sauteed onions would be a nice touch and would add to the flavor.

My family loved these potatos. I did make a few changes. I boiled the potatos until a fork could go through them. I also added a little extra shredded cheddar cheese. i used regular onions like another viewer suggested and bacon bits instead of bacon. These potatos will definately be made a lot more in my home. Thank you for such a great recipe.

If I was rating this myself I would give it a 1 no offense but I hated it BUT my boyfriend rated it an 8 out of a 1-10 and my step-dad liked them to. So, I think it's just a preference of taste. Thanks for the recipe though.
