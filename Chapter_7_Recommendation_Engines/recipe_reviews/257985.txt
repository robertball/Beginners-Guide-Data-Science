I add chia seeds for a nice crunch.  Otherwise good, not too sweet and so easy to make.

I scaled to 7 servings as I only had a heaping 1/2 cup of cornmeal. 
When I make cornmeal muffins I like to soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk first for at least 15 minutes before adding the other ingredients, I find the muffins softer and less gritty, because of this I did need to add more milk, about 1/4 cup. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp of lemon zest and used lemon juice to sour the milk. I used my #50 scoop which yielded 8 muffins which baked at 425 for 5 minutes then 350 for 18 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe! I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless
