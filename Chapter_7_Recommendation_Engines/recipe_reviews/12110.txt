I used coconut cream pudding instead of the vanilla pudding and heavy whipping cream whipped up with two tablespoons of granulated sugar instead of the coolwhip type cream.  I also roasted about a half cup coconut on a preheated baking sheet to sprinkle on the top.  It was great and I received lots of compliments. Too easy to be this YUMMY!!!

I just made this pie and I had to run to the computer to post my review. This pie is fantastic!!!!  I had a craving for coconut cream pie after catching a little bit of a "Gilligans Island" re-run the other day.  I remembered how easy this recipe seemed and grabed the ingredients at the store today.  I used canned cocount milk instead of regular milk to kick up the cocount factor a little and it came out great!!!  I will make this recipe all the time now!!! So easy and so tasty!!!  Yummm

I recently made this for a PTA appreciation lunch and boy did they appreciate it! IT ROCKED! There is not an easier recipe for this out there and it yields bakery tasting results!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend using coconut flav. instant pudding rather than vanilla (I followed this advice after reading other posts...thanks.) I toasted coconut and sprinkled that atop the pie and I also piped whip cream around the sides...it was beautiful and EASY AS PIE!!! MAKE THIS PIE!! :)

Wonderful! I have made this 3 times now. Each time I use 2 small (3.5 oz ) packages of coconut instant pudding instead of a 5oz. (couldn't find) and I think it helps the pie really firm up. I didn't prebake the crust and did let it sit overnight. It's a nice treat when you are looking for something sweet that isn't chocolate. I won't bother making one from "scratch." Everyone already thinks it is!

First of all, I have to admit that I do not eat coconut so this review is based solely on the other members of my family. I used the cocunut pudding as suggested and they raved about this pie which I could not believe because it was too easy!  I took it to a family gathering and it has been requested for every get together after.

I made this with a few variatons. I used 2 small boxes of instant coconut creme pudding,I couldn't find any 5 oz. boxes. I still used the same amount of milk, and I used french vanilla cool-whip. I took one other persons advice and didn't put the toasted coconut on until I served it.
Absolutely wonderful!!!

I made this pie for my husband's birthday since he LOVES coconut cream pie.  He said it was the very best pie he had ever enjoyed.  I did replace the vanilla pudding for coconut as recommeded by others, as well as adding a splash of vanilla extract.  A true keeper.

One of the greatest and easiest dessert recipes ever. I mixed vanilla and coconut pudding as suggested by other readers and added more milk and some vanilla extract. I whipped some heavy cream and toasted the coconut for the topping. I used a Graham crust pie shell. Thank you Darlene.

How easy can it get?  This is great for those last minute summer cook-outs.  My husband loves from scratch Coconut Cream Pie, and he said that this was right up there.  Want even better pie?  Melt 2 oz. semi-seet baker's chocolate, 1 tbsp. milk and 1 tbsp. butter in the microwave and pour in bottom of cooled pie crust before adding coconut mixture. Sprinkle top of pie with sliced almonds...and YUM!

Delicious! Be careful to add exactly the right of milk. I added a touch too much and it didn't firm up as much as I would have liked!

I really liked this but my husband did not.  He did not like the coconut sprinkled on top.  Definitely use coconut pudding otherwise your pie will taste like vanilla pudding w/coconut.  I could not find coconut pudding so I used vanilla but added 3 tsp. of coconut extract.  I also toasted the coconut sprinkled on top of the pie to add color and used a graham cracker crust.  I served this to 2 other people who did not offer any comments but did clean their plates.  I doubt I'll make this again since my husband did not care for it.

Amazing pie!!! Quick, easy, and delicious!!! I give it 5 stars following the recipe and 5+ stars with a few changes...I used 2qty 3 oz instant coconut cream pudding mixes instead of vanilla, made sure to use 2 cups of whole milk (we only drink non-fat in our house...whole milk was much better), toasted a 7oz bag of sweetened coconut flakes (added flakes to the pudding/milk/whip cream mixture without measuring and used the rest on top). The pie shell I used was Mrs. Smith from the freezer section...Follow the baking directions in package to be sure it won't bubble up on you. I also waited just until serving to add topping of whip cream and toasted coconut so it wouldn't get damaged while in the fridge.

I made this last night. YUMMY! I added 1 pkg lite cream cheese beaten with just a small amt of milk, and per other's suggestions I used 1 sm pkg coconut cream pudding & 1 sm pkg french vanilla pudding  with the 1 1/2 cup milk.  Used 1 cup coconut in the pie & toasted coconut & sprinkled it on top of the whipped topping. Put it in the 2 extra servings size graham cracker crust and everyone LOVED IT!  I used sugar free pudding & lite whipped topping & no one noticed. I will definitely be making this pie again.

Mmmmm.... This was very good. It tasted like resturant quality and was very easy. I made this for fathers day and received a 5 from my dad! I suggest toasting the coconut and putting it on top. To do so spread coconut on baking sheet in a preheated oven at 350 for 4 minutes.

This was a quick, easy, and surprisingly tasty fix for coconut cream pie for a crowd. I quadrupled the recipe for a church dinner, and several thought it was from scratch. I used coconut cream flavored instant pudding mix, but I think the vanilla flavor, as stated in the recipe, would be much better. I toasted some of the coconut and sprinkled on top.

This recipe is very easy and very, very good.  It could also be easily modified to make a quick and delicious banana cream or chocolate cream pie.  Use the pudding flavor of your choice; and, instead of the flaked coconut, try fresh banana slices or maybe some crushed Oreo cookies.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

This site rocks! I will be gaining some weight for sure. I have learned to read lots of reviews on a listed recipe to fine tune to my tastes and I got a great recipe from Darlene and then took the input from other readers and came up with the decision to go with
2 (3.5) oz coconut pudding packs
2 cups cold whole milk
1 cup sweetened coconut
1/4 cup toasted coconut (this is the hardest part to not burn it)! Some is for topping and some for pie to give it a texture 
6 oz. frozen whipped topping (thawed)
a touch of vanila extract (I put that in all my desers no matter what)
a touch of coconut extract
and the best pie crust you have time for
For me as a soso cook this is a great recipe and better than almost all coconut pies I have attempted to make! This fooled some very good cooks last night. I only used toasted coconut for the topping and this pie deserves real merangue! (did I spell that right)? I put the mix back in to cool for 30 minutes while a cook the pie crust cool the crust and wait as long as humanly possible awww maybe 2 hours! BTW there will be no left overs!
My favorite pies are all chocolate but if I make one it takes me hours and then my kids eat them before I get any and they do not like coconut so I have reached nirvana finding this recipe! I have a whole book of recipes from this site and they are so great that people share so much here! ttfn

This was truly a great pie!!! I was looking for a dessert to bring to Thanksgiving and decided to make this one... cuz it sounded interested. Normally I make coconut custard pie but wanted something different. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.... except to the two boxes of vanilla pudding I added coconut extract and used evaporated milk because that is what I had on hand..... and baked a regular pie crust first, put the ingredients in as stated.   Of all the desserts that were at thanksgiving.... this one went first!! It was awesome!!! Will definetly make again maybe next time I will toast some coconut and put it on the top.  I also think this recipe can be used for a Banana Cream pie just replace the pudding with bananna add some sliced banana and viola Banana Cream Pie!! Thanx for sharing this!!!

This was really good. I used 2 small boxes of vanilla and a can of coconut milk instead of regular milk, toasted the coconut before adding to mixture and put it on top as well. Great recipe. Thank You for sharing.

I'm not a coconut cream pie eater, but my son is and he wanted to try making one.  So I found this recipe and, substituting coconut pudding for the vanilla, the two of us made it.  According to my 7 year old, it is fantastic!  We even used green food coloring in the pudding and pink for the shredded coconut, and called it worm pie!

Excellent recipe. For a lighter version, that tasted just as scrumptious (and only 4pts per slice for you WW people), I used two small boxes sugar-free, fat-free white chocolate pudding, fat-free milk, fat-free coolwhip and a reduced fat graham cracker crust to lower the fat and calories. Topped with toasted coconut as others suggested - absolutely a marvelous creamy pie that everyone loved including the ones who usually turn up their noses at anything "light".

This pie is WONDERFUL. Easy! Fast! Delicious!  I took another reviewers suggestion and used TWO 3.5 oz. packages of instant coconut pudding (found at Kroger) instead of the vanilla pudding.  I also toasted the coconut that is sprinkled on the top of the pie.  We took two pies to a large garden party and the pies were DEVOURED even before the CHOCOLATE desserts!

I added 2 tsp coconut extract to (a large box of Jello Brand) vanilla pudding & used real whipped cream made from a recipe on this website (1/2 pint heavy whipping cream, 1 Tbsp confectioner's sugar & 1 tsp vanilla). The results are a beautiful, delicious pie!

I used a prepared graham crumb crust and it went realy well with the filling. Being a working mom with a teenager, a toddler, and a newborn, I'm a big fan of any recipe that saves me time and still tastes great.

I have to admit that I only used this recipe as a guide. I used coconut pudding mix instead of vanilla,a graham cracker crust instead of a pastry one and topped it with real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping. As a jumping off point it deserves all 5 stars. Thanks for a great basic recipe !

I've made this a couple of times now and it's delicious!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used 2 of the smaller packages of instant coconut pudding instead of the larger vanilla.  I also added a splash of coconut extract.  It's very easy and I'll certainly be making this again.

I took 2 of these pies to a Church Pie Auction.  One sold for $15 and the other for $45!!  I'd say it was a hit!  And TOO EASY!  I did use the coconut pudding.  I think the vanilla would be too bland.

Excellent easy pie to make!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used the coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla and it was an instant hit.  TI will be making this pie for special occasions as light, cool and absolutely delicious. I recommend this pie for any occasion.

Great tasting pie and super easy to make. I made my own whipped cream instead of using the pre-made stuff and added some coconut extract to the vanilla pudding (about 1 tablespoon). I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious. My husband and I ate every bit of this pie. I used two 3.4 oz. packages of coconut cream instant pudding. Awesome! Served with cool whip and toasted coconut sprinkled on top. To toast coconut easily, put some in a non stick pan and stir it constantly over low-med heat and cook it till it's lightly browned and crispy. That's how I do it.

Yummy!  I make this all the time.  I don't measure out the coconut anymore...I just kind of eyeball it.  I use a prepared graham cracker crust, sugar-free pudding, and I've even used sugar-free Cool Whip & it was fine.

Easy and a real winner!  My store didn't have the right size - had to use 2 small vanilla puddings, added the coconut to them, and toasted it for the top.  Used Cool Whip Lite since it was all I had, still turned out great and got raves and recipe requests.  This forum is the best to exchange recipes and ideas!

This wasn't very good not really like coconut cream pie more like vanilla pudding with coconut in it. Maybe I did something wrong, it is quick though and easy to make. i don't think I will be making it again.

Outstanding Pie. Easy to make and loved by all in the family. Have shared it with many other family members. An added very useful feature as indicated in other emails is to toast the coconut topping first before sprinkling on the pie. Love this web site. User friendly

This was outstanding!!  I did make the mistake of using the smaller size pudding.  So the pie wasn't as firm as it should be, but it was still excellent.  I also used real whipped cream and toasted the coconut.  Our guests  were impressed and there wasn't anything left!  It was sooooo easy.  Thanks for the great reacipe.

Excellent and so easy to make. I agree with others and used Jello coconut pudding instead of vanilla, though. The Jello coconut pudding already has a little flaked coconut in it, but I put a little extra of my own in. Sooooo yummy! I also toasted some coconut to put on top for the WOW factor!

This was pretty good. My 5 yr old and I whipped it up pretty quick! He wanted to make a 'surprise' dessert for his sister's birthday and came up with a coconut pie, though we've never had one nor talked about one- how special, though! My only complaint was that it was a little too sweet.

Delicious and so easy to make! I'm rating it four stars because I did use two 3.4 oz boxes of coconut pudding rather than vanilla pudding to bring out that coconut flavor.  Also, I toasted my coconut before sprinkling it on top.  I used a store-bought shortbread crust. My family loved it, especially my little brother who went back for two more servings.  Thanks for this simple and tasty recipe :)

This pie was SO delicious! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I used 2 small boxes of coconut pudding mixed with 2 1/2 cups of milk. I also toasted coconut for the top and didn't sprinkle it on until I was ready to serve it. Highly recommend! I will be making this again!

This was pretty good tasting, definitely quick and easy!  My son was expecting a more "from scratch" taste so he wasn't too impressed.  But for the speed and ease of putting this pie together it tasted good.

Made this for a coworker who requested a Coconut Cream Pie. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk with a graham cracker crust and about 2 cups of coconut mixed in the pudding. Turned out well after chilling for a few hours.

I made this for Easter, a few people thought I had bought it.  Everyone who tried it loved it, I didn't try it just don't like coconut, so I'm taking the other's opinion on this one. I used a graham cracker crust, toasted the coconut, and used 2 small packages of the coconut pudding.  Will be making this again, thanks for super easy crowd pleasing recipe!

A real keeper!  The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the pudding to give it more coconut taste.  It was wonderful after Easter dinner!

I normally do not like pudding type pies but this is the exception.  I use 2 small pkgs of instant coconut pudding.  Toast 2 cups of coconut, reserve 1/2 cup for the top and fold the rest into the filling.  Use same amt of milk and whole  8 oz.cool whip in filling plus extra cool whip for the top.  Using the convienent roll out crust makes this fast and very easy.

I enjoyed this pie. Sure it may not taste as authentic as a time-consuming everything-made-by-scratch coconut cream pie. But I think the point of this particular recipe was to be simple and quick and that it was. I couldn't find any coconut pudding at my local super market so I added about a tablespoon of coconut essence to the vanila pudding mix. I didn't put any of the cocnut flakes in the mix itself but toasted it and then sprinkled it on top of real whipped cream. (I hate Cool Whip.)This pie worked for me and my family!

It is definitely a 5-star recipe, next time however I will make sure to use a graham cracker crust versus rolling out a regular old pie crust.

Wow, so tasty and so easy! After reading the reviews, I changed a few things. I used a graham cracker crust, used unsweetened coconut and fresh whipping cream. The pudding is ultra sweet so mixing in unsweetened whip cream cuts the sweetness nicely. The toasted coconut on top like the picture shows is a nice touch too.

Used 1 small box French Vanilla instant pudding and 1 small box Creamcheese-flavored instant pudding 'cuz that's what I had on hand.  Increased the milk to 2 cups because of the extra pudding and added 1 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  Didn't read the recipe well and folded in all of the coconut and Cool Whip. It was creamy and delicious!  My husband loved it and it disappeared fast.

This pie was delicious and so easy to make!  I've made it three times in 2 weeks. I used 2 small boxes of instant coconut cream pudding mix and added 1 tsp. of coconut extract and toasted the coconut for the top -(be careful it burns easily!).  It looked so pretty, my husband thought I'd bought it.

Very easy to make and yummy! I followed some of the suggestions and added about 1 tbs. coconut extract to the vanilla pudding and toasted the coconut for the top.  I also added about 1/4 c. chopped pecans to the top for extra crunch.  Great!

This was extremely easy and the result was excellent.  My husband is a coconut cream pie lover and said this was the best one he had ever had.  I did make a few modifications to the recipe.  They are as follows:

2 baked pie shells
1 L frozen whipped topping
1 1/2 c shredded coconut
2 1/4c milk 
1 (175 g) pkg sherriff coconut pudding mix

cook pudding according to pkg directions using only 2 1/4c milk.  cool completely in fridge.  In a large bowl mix 1/2 L whipped topping and 1c coconut with pudding; mix well.  distribute evenly between cooked and cooled pie shells.  Top pies with remaining whipped topping and coconut.  Serve chilled.

Super easy and this tasted great.  My 8 year old son made this to take to Easter dinner, and it was a hit.  We used a graham cracker crust and I messed up and bought a 3.5 oz size box of pudding so I adjusted the milk to 1 cup and it still came out just right.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit with everyone!  I used half cornstarch and half flour, as suggested by others.  I wasn't bothered at all by the stirring.  I topped it with a generous portion of cool whip.  The toasted coconut was a lovely finishing touch!  My parents and in-laws loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this recipe with a regular baked pie crust, but I bet it would be great with a graham cracker crust also. This is super quick and easy, and very tasty. For a little variety and color, I toasted the last 1/2 cup of cocount that I topped the pie with.

Delicious and quick. Used a shortbread crust. I don't like regular pie crusts with cream pies. Get soggy quickly.  Used coconut cream pudding.  Toasted coconut for top. My family who doesn't really care for coconut gobbled it up. Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out perfect everyone loved it and thought it was made professionally from a bakery. Instead of milk I used coconut milk and I think that really took it up to five stars. I also toasted the coconut flakes  that I sprinkled on top of the pie.I can't wait to make this again!!

I tried this recipe by using 2 smaller packages of French Vanilla pudding and put the whole amount of coconut in the pudding. I liked it but I think the pudding is too sweet, but I think all pudding is too sweet. I do like the flavor of French Vanilla better than regular Vanilla pudding.

Thank you for this easy, awesome recipe! I give it four stars because it needs the modification that everyone suggested- use canned coconut milk, even if you find coconut flavored instant pudding. Delicious, and very easy to make!

I made this for a co-worker's birthday.  
Everyone loved it and gave it rave reviews.
Amazingly easy.
I used coconut pudding, just 3.5 oz. as this is what was at the store.  
I used milk for the pudding.
I made my own whip cream (I worried about this as the recipe specifically tells you to use non-dairy topping, but it worked out just fine) flavored with vanilla and made the graham cracker crust.

Amazing...  I did use coconut pudding rather than the vanilla. What made this pie so awesome was the oreo cookie crust I used.  Family loved it

My boyfriend loves all things coconut and I wanted to make him a coconut cream pie but it's still pretty warm here so I didn't want to actually turn on the oven so I was happy to find this recipe. It was very, very easy but I agree with several reviewers that the coconut flavor was not as intense as I was hoping. He loved it but I think the next time I make it I may try using coconut milk instead of regular milk. I looked for coconut flavored pudding in my grocery store but apparently it is not carried around here. Since he liked it, I guess it was coconutty enough for him. This is a really pretty pie too!

This is incredible! I have never made pudding and was nervous I would mess it up, but it went great. It is so smooth and creamy. I added coconut and will use this for a homemade coconut cream pie. With 3 kids, this will definitely stay on my quick and easy snack list.

I made this for my father who is supposed to watch his sugar. I used the large box of instant Sugar Free Vanilla pudding, added 2 tsp of coconut extract and 1 cup coconut. The other ingredients I didnt change.  Turned out very nice.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Following other reviews I made the recipe with 2 small packages of instant coconut cream pudding, 1 3/4 cup of milk, and I toasted 1/4 cup of coconut to sprinkle on top. I found that with the added amount of pudding the pie overflowed slightly, so next time I make this I might add less of the pudding. I found that the 1/2 cup of coconut called for in the recipe to sprinkle on top of the pie was slightly too much; I ended up using only 1/4 cups. With the changes it was absolutely delicious and I will be making it again.

Super Yummy!!!  Everyone loved it!!!
After reading reviews, I too did the following changes:
* used 2 - 3.4oz coconut cream pudding mixes, instead of vanilla pudding mix
* used 1 1/4c coconut milk and 1/4c milk, instead of all milk
* toasted 1/2c flaked coconut for topping
* 8oz heavy whipping cream (beat until peaks form) instead of nondairy whipped topping or 8oz container
Super easy!  Super yummy!

If using coconut pudding, omit added coconut.  Sprinkle toasted coconut on top only lightly.

Perfect texture, but absolutely too sweet. Unfortunately, you can't remove the main contributor of sugar (the pudding) without losing the perfect texture. Would be perfect for kids, maybe family parties.

This truly is a simple recipe to make and comes out tasting so good. I used one box of coconut cream pudding mix and it came out great. I made this for my sister's birthday, she loves coconut cream pie, and she really enjoyed it.

I've made this several times with excellent results every time.  I always toast my coconut though so it adds a bit of crunchy texture to the smoothness of the pudding.  Love this!!

I used a graham cracker crust, stuck with the vanilla pudding and also toasted the coconut for the top. It was amazing!  I'm not usually a huge fan of just a pudding pie but with the whip topping mixed in it was so rich and my husband thought I had bought it!  I will definitely make this again and try other puddings!

Family liked this pie. I used coconut pudding as suggested by some reviewers. I think next time I will use 1 box vanilla and one coconut. Also, I will do as a reviewer suggested and toast the coconut before adding it to the puddin mixture. I think it will give it a less stringy texture.

My husband's favorite pie is coconut cream and he loved this recipe. I made my own pie crust with 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup shortening, 1/3 cup ice water (cut in), pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar. then baked for 10-12 mins at 400. I let the crust cool then followed the recipe exactly except I toasted my coconut.. I love it and my husband couldn't get enough. Thank you for this recipe.

Great summer recipe -- no baking! Easy and delicious.  I used one package of French vanilla and one package of coconut pudding to add depth to the flavor. I toasted coconut in the toaster oven for the topping. No heat generated.

This is delicious, but I don't think it's the same as a homemade pie.  I made it with pie crust instead of the graham cracker crust.  I used 2 coconut cream (small boxes) of pudding mix, added 3 cups of milk and toasted the coconut. It was light and fluffy, absolutely delicious.

Super easy pie! I took advice from other posts and used Coconut flavored pudding, but I couldnt find instant pudding in the coconut flavor, so I got cook and serve and prepared it as the box stated in the microwave and then added 1/2 the whipped cream and the coconut. I was told by many people that this was the best coconut pie ever. I was amazed at how easy it was even without instant pudding. This recipe is a denfinate keeper. Thanks!!

Very good!  I used 2 small boxes vanilla pudding as that is what I had on hand.  Next time I will use coconut flavored pudding.  I increased the milk to 2 cups due to the extra pudding mix.  I put in 2 full cups of coconut into the pudding and then toasted more coconut to put on top.  I can see where some reviewers that didn't like coconut before liked this pie.  It isn't strong coconut flavor, but it is good.  I think with the coconut flavored pudding, it will be even better!

This was very easy and very good. I toasted the coconut in the oven at 325 until it was golden-brown, and I added 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract to the pudding mixture.  Everyone liked it.

The Pie filling never set up for me. I also put it in the freezer. It had a great taste but was a little runny. Might try again. Maybe I did Something wrong.

I made this pie for Father's Day with my one year old daughter.  My husband loves coconut cream pie and he said this was the best he has ever had.  I did use one small vanilla pudding and one small coconut pudding.  I also made my whip topping with real whipping cream.  My husband already says he wants this pie ofr his birthday next month.

Thank you, thank you for this delicious recipe.  I couldn't believe how easy it was - or how wonderful it turned out.  I made it for Father's Day and husband's grandmother told me it was the best coconut pie she's had since HER mother passed away!  Even my never pleased mother in law has begged me to make her her own pie!  No one would believe how easy it was to make.  A definite hit!

Yummy!!!! Love coconut cream pie and have never made it figured it would be too hard. This was great and for sure a keeper!!! I used 1 3.5 oz box of coconut cream pudding and 1 3.5 oz box of vanilla as suggested in a graham cracker pie crust. I used 2 3/4 cups of milk as that was what the box recommened for pudding pies.This was cheap and EASY and would not hesitate to serve to company. Already planning to send one to work with my husband.

This recipe was wonderful!! Like others suggested, I used one small vanilla pudding and one small cocount and added both vanilla and coconut extract. I think I'll skip folding the cool whip in next time. I'd like the pie filling to be a bit more dense. This has become my new coconut cream pie recipe! So easy!!!

Delicious!  I also used one small box of vanilla pudding and one small box of coconut cream pudding and used 2 cups of milk.  I also toasted the coconut on top, which gave a nice touch to the pie.  I recieved rave reviews from my in-laws and husband.  Thanks for the recipe and such a simple pie to make.

Ten stars in my book!  This pie is the best, by far, of any cream pie I have ever tasted!  It is so easy to prepare and the taste will blow you away!  I used toasted coconut pudding and french vanilla whipped topping.  Next, I'm going to try substituting different pudding flavors to make different pies.  Chocolate, butterscotch, banana...

Made this for Christmas--absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. I misread  the recipe and used one 3.5 oz. box of vanilla pudding (my store didn't carry coconut) but it was plenty- not huge but it fit fine in my pie tin, esp. after adding whip topping. After I cooked the pie crust, I toasted the 1/2 C. coconut for a couple of minutes. I don't think it was nec. to toast ALL the coconut. Yummy!

My family and I LOVED this pie!!  It was wonderfully easy to make (had it made in less than 10 minutes) and tasted great.  I did take suggestions from other posters about doubling the coconut and toasting the coconut sprinkled on the top.  This pie really helped make our Thanksgiving meal spectacular.

This was delicious! I made it for my husband and he loved it. I used unsweetened coconut and he said it was perfect. If you have more of a sweet tooth make with sweetened coconut but we thought it was great with regular coconut flakes.

This was a hit!! I usually look for recipes and improvise. This recipe was a great canvas.I cooked vanilla pudding with 15 oz Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut and part milk then added coconut shavings. Cooked and let sit.- toasted coconut- spread coconut shavings to a clean baking sheet, bake 350 to desired color. I baked for 3-5 mins. Be careful to not burn.- Crust- 1 package of graham crackers, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, 1/4 cup toasted coconut - all grinded. Add 1/4 cup of melted butter and mix until moist. Place in pie dish and pat - bake at 350 for 15 mins. Let cool. - Whipping cream - I added the remnants of Coco Lopez and a dash of coconut extract.Add pudding to pie crust chill about 1 1/2 hours - top with whipped cream and sprinkle toasted coconut. Put back in fridge until ready to serve.

I don’t usually vary a given recipe but I will not use nondairy topping. It tastes like grease, so I whipped and sweetened cream as a replacement. My granddaughters always request coconut cream pie

I made my own gluten free crust (coconut flour), and melted semi-sweet chocolate to coat the bottom of the crust before adding pudding.  I also used 1 small box vanilla pudding, and 1 small box coconut pudding (made with skim milk). I used unsweetened coconut, and toasted it before adding to pudding.  I also used Light Cool Whip.  This pie was easy to make and delicious.

This was the easiest dessert I’ve ever made. My dad requested it I will definitely make it again. I used the two small boxes of coconut cream pudding and the extra creamy whipped topping .

So! After years of making coconut cream pie from scratch (which took a LONG time and all your attention to ensure the pudding did not scorch), I tried this pie. Boy am I glad I did! Not only is it a five-minute pie....it tastes far better in my opinion. So if anybody wants the other coconut cream pie that takes forever to do, they can do it themselves! (But no one asked for it!) 5 stars are not enough. It has changed my "holiday life"!!!

After reading  many reviews I decided to make two pies. One with the suggestion of using two of the smaller boxes of the coconut cream pudding and the other pie with 1 small box of coconut cream and 1 small box of french vanilla pudding. Because I read that a good handful of people thought the pie was too sweet, I made my own whipping cream to add for the filling (8oz whipping cream, 1 tbsp Confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract) to help bring down the sweetness. Both pies contained the homemade whipping cream in the filler, both had graham cracker crust (perfect pairing), both had unsweetened coconut inside the pies, both had store bought coolwhip and toasted coconut on top. Then only difference was the pudding fillers. roughly 15 guest tried both pies and prefered the CC & French Vanilla pudding fillers. Also wasn't too sweet at all. I actually added more conf. sugar in as I was making the filling.     One other  recommendation I would say is that I read people increasing the milk portion (because they had chosen two smaller box of pudding which adds up to be more than the listed pudding box instructed in the original recipe). The recommendation that I applied was 2 cups of whole milk and 1 can of Coconut Milk. The pie didn't firm up well at all, even after being in the fridge overnight. I would cut back on the milk or take the can  of coconut milk out next time. Enjoy!

Loved this recipe! I took the advice from other comments and substituted 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream for the half and half. I also substituted 1/3 cup of cornstarch for the flour.  Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I used another recipe from this site for my graham cracker crust and homemade whipped topping.

To turn it up, add 6 or 7 drops of coconut flavoring into the pudding mixture. It really gets the people going. Seriously do it. Right na!

This is a great pie when scrunched for time. Easy to make & delicious. I see making this a lot in the summer for family cookouts when I have a lot of other dishes to make..easy to make but the finished pie looks like it took longer.

This is delicious and easy to make.  I used one coconut flavored pudding and one vanilla flavored,  and used small store bought graham cracker crusts. This recipe fit in 12 small crusts.  I also toasted some coconut in a frying pan to top off the mini pies.  I brought them to poker night and my friends loved it -  even the ones who claimed  not to like coconut.  I will make it again.

I just finished making two pies for Fathers Day tomorrow.  My Dads favorite pie.  They turned out beautifully.  I wanted to use coconut pudding like others suggested but my grocery store did not sell it.  I used the vanilla pudding and coconut milk as others suggested.  I did make the mistake of buying pudding you cook so it took a little extra time to stir the "heat" out of it before folding in the cool whip.

This recipe was good, however I tweaked it, I usually use coconut cream instant pudding/pie mix, however, the groceries were out so I used French vanilla instant pudding, 2 teaspoons of coconut flavoring, added about 1 cup of coconut and 1 and 1/2 cup of milk, my husband loved it, I used the cool whip for the topping and toasted some coconut for the top it was delicious!

So good! I used a graham cracker crust. I couldn't find coconut pudding so I used vanilla with coconut milk.  I also toasted coconut for the top right before I served it. Made it in the morning and it was perfect for after dinner. So easy!

This is out of this world delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers who said to add coconut extract  if using vanilla pudding and to toast the coconut.  I blended almost all the coconut in the filling and put aside just enough, for my liking, for the top.  I also used a deep dish pie crust which was perfect for the amount of pudding and whipped cream filling.  I will definitely make this again!  LOVED IT!!!

So easy and yummy! To cut back on some calories and sugar,I use the small boxes of Jello pudding, 1 coconut cream and 1 sugar free vanilla with 1 percent milk and light Cool Whip. I also toast the coconut flakes before adding them. It turns out great every time and everyone loves it.

I used the cooked vanilla pudding (135 g 6 serving) using 2  c milk and added tsp of coconut extract and cooled with plastic wrap over it to prevent skin (can microwave on high for approx 6 minutes, stirring every 2 min).
 Browned 1 1/2 c coconut for 5 min at 350F and added all but 1/4 c to cooled pudding with half container cool whip.  Put in cooled graham wafer 9" pie shell (2 c graham crumbs, 1/3 c sugar, 1/3 c melted margarine pressed into pan and baked 8 min at 375F then cooled.). Chill for min 4 hours then top with rest of cool whip and sprinkle with rest of toasted coconut.

I had to really edit this recipe due to food intolerances, but I used it as a guide.  I only had cook-type pudding on hand so I used that.  I used a 15oz can of coconut milk (due to dairy intolerance) and used a gluten-free pie crust which I pre-baked.  I toasted up a cup of shredded coconut, made the pudding, using the coconut milk and cooled it to room temperature by putting the pan in about 2 inches of cold water in the sink for about 10 minutes.  Then I stirred in the toasted coconut and non-dairy topping and put it in my pie crust and put that in the fridge to set all the way.  After about an hour I cut a slice and put some non-dairy topping on it and dang!  Delicious!  There's just me so I wait until serving to add the topping.  Next time I will use the instant pudding, which sounds a lot easier.

Amazing, used two 3 oz. boxes of cook and serve coconut pudding, prepared with 1 1/2 c milk and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Had a pie crust in the freezer that I rolled out, and had a great dessert in the frig in 35 minutes. Nice.

There was not a 5 oz package of pudding in the store. I used the large box, of Jello Brand which is 1.5oz, sugar free vanilla.  I also used a can of coconut milk, instead of cow's milk, than I folded in a cube of room temperature cream cheese along with the shredded un-sweetened coconut flakes.  My Mom and husband were fighting over who would get the last of it.  This was a delicious way to get a sugar free dessert for those that can't have the sugar or those that are lactose intollerant (coconut milk).  Finished off the top with toasted coconut. The next one I am going to try a graham cracker crust, made with frustose and butter.

Loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of sprinkling chocolate chunks on top!  I also thought it tasted much better the next day (so make the night before if possible!)  Yummy and easy!

Great, easy recipe!  I used this recipe for my first attempt at making a cream pie and it turned out perfect!  Will make again, but maybe I'll use chocolate pudding, no coconut and I'll put chocolate shavings on top.  I used a regular pastry pie crust which I had frozen in my freezer from the last time I made a pie.  I baked it about ten minutes at 425 and then let it cool to room temp. before adding the pudding and cool whip mixture.  Since it was only an 8" pie crust I used a 3.4 oz (small) box of coconut cream instant pudding, only 1/2 c. sweetened flaked coconut and half of an 8 oz. Cool Whip for the filling.  Then I topped it with the other half of the thawed Cool Whip and sprinkled 1/2 c. toasted (not burnt!) coconut on the top and refrigerated it overnight.  Turned out very creamy and had the perfect amount of coconut flavor...not too much, nor too little!  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

Wicked easy to make and used another reviewer's advice and subbed the regular milk for coconut milk, and toasted coconut for the topping.  It makes a difference.

Made just as written, very good, even better that it took no time at all and didn't have to buy anything special for.  I did only have the Dream Whip mix that you mix with milk, still set

This pie is really good. I made it as is except I added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the pudding mix and toasted the coconut for the top. After I let it chill for some hours it was great. Thanks for the recipe Dmarcks

I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust with this and was pleased with the consistency of this pie.  Like others, I toasted the coconut for the top (a MUST!). I thought the flavor of the filling just wasn't there.  My grocery store doesn't carry coconut pudding, but this pie was easy and great in all other ways so I will try it again when I find coconut pudding.

Good recipe but I didnt have the milk so I used what I had in the house. A can of coconut cream from trader joes and half and half...yep no calories there! Added coconut and chopped pecans on a graham cracker crust...a little whipped cream on top and it was a perfect ending to the chili dinner!

This was absolutely delicious!!!  My fiancee says it was the best coconut pie ever and one of my daughters who HATES coconut tried a small piece and said it was good.  I did use the coconut pudding and toasted the coconut for the top.  This is a simple recipe that I will be making over and over.  I'm sure it will be on the Thanksgiving dessert table and my fiancee has requested it instead of a birthday cake.

My first ever taste of a coconut cream pie.  Exceedingly sweet.  This pie, unfortunately, had a manufactured taste to it.  So I went ahead and made it twice.  Once per the directions, the second time with some of the other reviewers recommendations.  I used cocunut flavored jello and I also added some coconut flavoring.  Nothing I did could really fix the fake flavor of the jello pudding. Next coconut cream pie I try will be the kind that is made by scratch.  Thanks for the recipe, anyway!

This was a great recipe and so simple!  I used the cook and serve coconut cream pudding with extra creamy cool whip for the filling and french vanilla cool whip for the topping.  I toasted all the coconut and used a shortbread crust.  I also think it would be excellent with a chocolate crust, so I might try that next time.  Also, since there is nothing really perishable (besides the milk), this is a great recipe that you can keep all the ingredients on hand for when you have last minute guests.  Thanks again!

Made this last night and it is AWESOME!!  I am a huge coconut cream pie fan and this recipe was right on as far as flavor and very easy to make.  Don't worry if you can't find coconut flavored pudding mix as others have recommended, I used vanilla and it had plenty of coconut flavor.  Just make sure you use the sweetened coconut!  Delicious!

This is awesome.  So easy and delicious.  I did use coconut flavored pudding mix instead of the vanilla; 2 3.5oz boxes was perfect and I toasted the cocunut for the topping.  YUMMY!  This will definitely be a keeper!

This recipe is awesome! I used two boxes of coconut cream pudding(as another suggested) and put it in a graham cracker crust.  My family loves it. Make sure you get a slice it goes fast!!

My partner and his daughter raved.  I don't like coconut, but they both love it.  Since I don't like it, I wanted it to be the easiest one to make!  I used the coconut instant pudding like others suggested.  "Top notch"

My husband made one request for dessert for Thanksgiving, and it was to make him a coconut cream pie. I used this recipe because it was so simple, though I used the coconut cream flavor pudding instead of vanilla, and I sprinkled walnuts on the top to make it look pretty. My husband loved it more than his mom's! Will be using this recipe for next Thanksgiving!

I absolutely love coconut cream pie, and I decided to make some while shopping with mom for Thanksgiving this weekend. It's cooling in the fridge, but I tried a small piece and it tastes amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh, this was soooooooooo good!  I was looking for a recipe that my 8 year old could make & this was a great choice.  She was proud to have done it herself with only a little help from me on the sideline.  Who would think that something with so few ingredients could turn out so well.   We made the recipe just as described & it turned out perfect.  Lots of coconut flavor.

Good recipe.  I used 1 box vanilla and 1 box of coconut instant pudding.  Folded half of the Cool Whip into pudding but wished I had not, as 1 reviewer suggested.  I will try next time.  Will use again.

This was very good for something so quick and easy.  I made my own graham cracker crust but would have preferred a traditional baked pastry crust with coconut cream pie.  I also used two 3.4 oz pkgs. of Jello brand vanilla instant pudding. Not sure where you get 5 oz. boxes but nowhere around here.  I also topped the pie with coconut, very yummy!

I made this last night and it is incredible!  I toasted all of the coconut.  Did add the chocolate layer on top of the crust (as suggested by a reviewer), and if I did that again, I would increase it by about 50%, as it was hard to taste.  Used a small box of Jell-o vanilla fat and sugar free instant pudding, a small box of regular coconut cream instant pudding, 2-1/4 cups 2% milk, and 3/8 tsp. of each vanilla and coconut extracts (it could have used more, esp. of the coconut).  I omitted the top layer of Cool-Whip, as the Pillsbury Pet-Ritz deep-dish crust was plenty full after the pudding layer.  So I just topped that layer with the remaining 1/2 cup coconut.  Super easy, super fast, and super yummy!!!  Since I modified the original recipe SO much, I could only give it 4 stars.

I used to hate coconut, but this has changed my opinion.  The reason I made it was for my family members that love it, and they convinced me to try it.  I'm a changed person :).

This is very good for how easy it is. This is a last-minute dessert you could keep the ingredients in your pantry for.  I used half coconut and half vanilla pudding and toasted the coconut to go on top as recommended by other reviewers.  Not as good as homemade, but will definitely make again for a quick and easy coconut pie fix.

This is a great pie!  And soooo easy.  I bought a ready made grahm cracker pie crust and used one box of coconut cream pudding and one box of sugar free vanilla.  Delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I also made one using one box of banana pudding and one box of vanilla and substituted the coconut for sliced bananas.  Also very excellent!  I cannot believe it is so easy and so good.

A great & easy pie to make. I used 1/2 vanilla pudding and 1/2 coconut. Using all coconut would have been too sweet for me. Go easy on the coconut sprinkled on top - I added too much & it was a little overwhelming.

This pie is mmm, mmm, GOOD!  I entered in a pie contest at work and took home the golden rolling pin award (and everyone put in so much more work than I did!)  I couldn't find any coconut pudding at the store, but vanilla was enough to do the trick.  So easy, and so good!

i'm not a huge fan of coconut but i have to say that this pie is quite tasty.  my mother absolutely loves it.  i toasted some coconut for the top and i really liked the visual effect and the different texture it gave, but i found that unless you eat the whole pie in one sitting, the toasted coconut flakes get a big soggy/soft.  what i plan to do next time is to store the toasted coconut separately and sprinkle it on right before serving.

This is a great coconut cream pie.  I made it with 2 small boxes of instant coconut cream pudding, 2 cups skim milk, fat-free whipped topping, a dash of vanilla extract, and a little coconut extract. I also toasted the 1/2 c. coconut that went on top.  My husband doesn't care for overly sweet pie and he really likes this one.

This recipe is really pretty good.  I did use coconut creme pudding instead of vanilla as others had suggested.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

Wow!!! What a wonderful pie.  My boyfriend loves this recipe.  He and I eat the whole thing w/in a few hours -- it's that good.  I usually use 1/2 vanilla pudding and 1/2 coconut creme pudding and toast the flaked coconut on top.  Delicious.

Very tasty. I used two 3.4oz coconut cream instant pudding packages because I could not find the 5oz box. Tasted very good and was not too sweet or too coconutty. I toasted the coconut that was sprinkled on top and it made the pie very beautiful. Overall a very good recipe if you take suggestions from the other users.

What a great little pie! I used a ready-made graham crust and fat-free coolwhip; also could not find a 5 oz pudding so used one 3.4 oz of coconut cream flavor instant and a few shakes of lemon instant and it was fine. Also toasted 1/2c of coconut for top. Lots of compliments, will make again. Thanks!

Delicious and very easy. When I could not find coconut pudding, I used the recommendations of other reviewers and used vanilla pudding plus 1 TBS of coconut extract. I also toasted the coconut on the small tray in my toaster oven.

Yes, this recipe is easy, fast and kids can do it...but it tastes like vanilla pudding with cool whip.  Not much flavor and no pizazz.  Would not recommend making this unless it is altered majorly with an infusion of flavor (not just the coconut thrown in)

I used a graham cracker crust, coconut cream pudding and whipping cream instead of Cool Whip.  I thought it tasted fabulous and it passed the ultimate test - - my mom, who makes an incredible baked coconut cream pie, loved it as well!

This pie was so tasty!!  Will definitely make it again.  I used a graham cracker crust to make it truly 'no-bake'.  I couldn't find 5 oz of instant pudding mix, only 3.5 oz boxes, so I used one toasted coconut flavor and half a vanilla flavor package.

I was really underwhelmed by this recipie!  Seduced by the fabulous reviews and ease, I was expecting a lot more.  Head my warning...  DO NOT MAKE THIS FOR COMPANY.  As is, it has the gastronomic aplomb of a budget cafeteria dessert!  It essentially tastes like vanilla pudding with cool whip on top.  The coconut flavor is nearly non-existant.  

Undaunted, I altered this recipe and found it was improved by:
- adding a can of Cream of Coconut (not coconut milk)
- using an oatmeal cinamon graham cracker crust
- serving it in custard cups instead of pie or spring form pan  (the Cream of Coconut will alter the firmness of the pudding)

While the end result was a little sweet for my taste, everyone else enjoyed it enormously.  The stronger coconut taste masked the non-excitment of vanilla j-ello pudding.  I may try making it again and substituting coconut extract in lieu of the Cream of Coconut.

This pie is surprisingly delicious.  It is very quick and easy to make.  One afternoon, when my 8 year old daughter and her friend were attacked by the "boring" monster.  I allowed them to make this pie for both families.  They enjoyed the experience and the families enjoyed the treat.

This pie was a big hit at my house. I found that it was quick and easy. I did add a little more coconut and I toasted the coconut I sprinkled on top.

This pie wasn't very good to me. It just tasted like super sweet pudding on a pie crust. Just eat vanilla pudding (enhanced with coconut) topped off with cool whip. Save the pie crust for a real pie.

This recipe could not be simpler, yet the taste is fabulous!  As good as any restaurant Coconut Cream Pie I've ever eaten.  I made this for my husband for his birthday.....it was gone within 2 days and he requested another a week later!  Yummy!!  I also toasted the coconut for the top to give it a little color.

This recipe was so quick and delicious!  It is tradition for our family to have coconut cream pie for Thanksgiving.  I have never had so many compliments on a pie before.  This one is going to stick around our family for a while.

This recipe is definitely quick and easy.  I even had compliments from those who did not normally "like" coconut cream pie.
