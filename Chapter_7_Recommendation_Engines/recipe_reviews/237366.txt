I am not a lover of veggie or vegan chili bc I find the taste very boring.  This recipe, however,  does not fit into that category.  The flavor was surprisingly wonderful and I'm glad I made a double batch. The chili can stand on its own without the coconut milk, but I found that adding the coconut milk gave it a subtle sweetness that added to the flavor profile.  The only addition I made was to thicken it with a cornstarch/ water mixture bc my husband likes thick chili.  This didn't detract from the overall flavor.  If you're not a fan of veggie chili, give this one a try.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  I'll be making this recipe on a regular basis.

Made today.  Left out turmeric as I didn't have it.  I had a green pepper that needed to be used up so diced it and added.  Used 2 tsp. veg granules as I didn't have cubes.  I didn't have fresh green beans so added one can of rinsed green beans.  I had the crock pot on high per directions but after a couple hours, the liquid was almost boiling so I turned to low.  Initially, there doesn't appear to be much liquid in the chili but as it cooks, the veggies and/or beans must release some liquid as  there was liquid almost to the top after a few hours in the crock  pot.  I added the coconut milk which made the liquid a rather unappetizing color.  There was a little too much "heat" to the chili for my liking so if I were to make this again (not sure I will), I would probably cut back on the chili powder and/or red pepper.

This was delicious! I was running short on time (even though it's super fast and easy) and left out carrots and green beans but followed exactly otherwise. My daughter and I are on our second bowl already! The coconut milk (and maybe also the  baked beans) give it a sweeter flavor than most chili. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This was the best vegetarian chili I ever had.  I used vegetable stock in place of the boullion and cut back on the red pepper as DH doesn't tolerate heat well. Otherwise made as-is.

Amazing recipe! I used chicken stock Instead of veggie stock and added white butter beans (those are my favorite) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. (No coconut milk) and I loved it! Shared with my parents, boyfriend and boss and there was plenty to go around!!

I thought that this was a really good recipe.  It was simple and tasty.  I'm not a huge chili fan and I liked it.  Hubby is a big chili fan and said this was one of the better recipes I have made. I didn't make any changes, but I did add the coconut milk.

I didn't have everything on hand but improvised with whatever I had in the cupboard. I had coconut milk, but won't use it again. I think it made the chili slightly sweet and I prefer savory. I didn't have any boullion  so I used a package of chicken noodle soup. All the small skinny noodles disintegrated and it thickened up the chili. Instead of a can of tomatos, I used fresh grape tomatoes, whole. I also added some stone ground mustard and a bit of white wine vinegar for acid. It turned out great. I'd make it again if I ever happen to have the random mishmash of crud I had going on.  I used no carrots or celery, but I did have fresh green beans. It was a good way to get my husband to eat green beans but I'm indifferent about them being in the chili.

This is the second time I’ve made it. The flavor is spot on for me. I love the heat, but if you don’t you can always cut back on the red pepper. I made it as is today but you can really add or substitute veggies easily. I just saw Foodfit’s review - why didn’t I think of using my instant pot. LOL. Next time

My son made this for Christmas Eve.  We used dry chick peas and dry black beans instead of canned.  We had to add 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce to get enough liquid.  We should have added more seasonings as it needed more spice, but overall it was very tasty!

Turned out great—making a trial run for a chili cook off next week .  Really interesting flavors!  Left out the green beans cause they seemed wrong for the recipe.  Will add the coconut milk for the cook off.

Fantastic flavor and easy to prepare. The turmeric and coconut milk round out the flavor nicely. Best served over rice.

I think they must mean 2 tablespoons of chili powder - 2 teaspoons is way too little for any chili.  Otherwise good, but I don't really follow the recipe.  I just wanted to point out the likely error.

It was okay.  I won't make this recipe again because it was watery and the flavors did not mesh as other recipes do.

I made this for a Chili luncheon we had at work. A coworker is a vegetarian and I wanted to make sure she could join in as it was Team Leads cooking. It was my first time making a anything like this. She and the rest of the team liked it. Had several ask for the recipe and many couldn't believe it was vegetarian! Will definitely keep this one!

This is a wonderful, just-right-spicy chili for occasions when you want to serve a vegetarian alternative (or for those who are vegetarian). AS IS, I rate it a big five stars!! I had never used turmeric before, and it really adds a kick to the flavor! Last time I made it with the following variations: I doubled the recipe using a 7 quart Crock Pot. I added 3/4 jar of Pace medium picante sauce; and instead of chopping vegetables I used a tub of grilling veggies from the supermarket to save time  chopping and half of a tub of chopped onions. I left out the green beans because I just wasn't feeling it. I thought the coconut milk was inspired! It was super delicious and I will definitely make sure again!

I was a little worried about not having any meat, but we loved it!   I used chicken bouillon (that's all I had in the pantry.) I also rinsed and drained the baked beans.  I didn't have vegetarian, and the flavor I had in the pantry seemed like it might throw off the flavor.  I didn't want it too sweet.   I also didn't use the coconut milk.  It was delicious!  Served over rice.

Tastes great and is very filling. My husband loves spicy food but I don't, so I cut the chilli powder in half and it still gives a great kick without burning my mouth.

Easy prep for this chili. I did use a small amount of the coconut milk and it did make it more tasty and creamy. I used a little less of the ground red pepper as my taste is less spicy . I served it to a group of volunteers who scarfed if down quickly. Smiling faces all around. I will definetly continue to use this recipe.

Made it for a party, and everyone loved it.   I think the coconut milk is a must, I added the whole can.  Very delicious!

Delicious! I followed this recipe nearly the same, although instead of the crushed red peppers I used crushed cayenne pepper (I enjoy more heat).

Next time I make this recipe, which will probably be in the next few days, I'll probably mix it up a little bit with some kernel corn (add some color) and perhaps a few more veggies.

Made as is but used stock instead of bouillon and water.  Delicious!  This will be a new staple for us.
