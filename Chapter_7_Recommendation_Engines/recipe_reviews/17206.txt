Not what we expected.  Not a sweet bread. It had a very strong chocolate flavor but, it was hard to get past the fact that it was bread.  It was okay with some vanilla ice cream but, I wouldn't make it again.

Not sure what happened but it turned out doughy, and more like pudding cake than bread.  My yeast was proofed so that's not it.

I noticed other reviewers saying this was too gooey, so instead of putting in chocolate chips I added more cocoa powder and it came out hard and dry.  I'm putting it into a bread pudding recipe today. To be fair, though, my review is for my altered recipe. I'll try it with chocolate Chios
