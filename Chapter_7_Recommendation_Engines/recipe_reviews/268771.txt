This was really easy to get together and very chocolatey!   It was really great and perfect for a cold night.  I did find once you put the baileys in the cocoa it cools it down more than I like and the giant marshmallow didn't melt.  Next time I would add the baileys to the hot chocolate and heat on low for a few minutes so the alcohol didn't cook off.  I would also use mini marshmallows.

We loved this super-chocolatey version! I skipped the nutmeg bc I hate it but hubby and 6yo liked it! (I omitted the Bailey's from the 6yo's version and added 1/4 tsp of real sugar to her cup before pouring in the hot mixture). There's really nothing I would suggest to improve this; if you like almond flavoring (like in almond cakes, etc.) you'll love this!

Delicious!  Super rich - more like what we've called a "liquid truffle," or sipping chocolate.  We used mini-marshmallows and toasted them, then topped with grated nutmeg.

We really enjoyed this one. I loved the dark chocolate richness. My daughter really liked this, no Baileys for her. I'll make this again.

I made this recipe out of curiosity and I’m glad I did. Even though it’s dairy free it’s rich and full of flavor. I used vanilla almond milk and I think the vanilla hint added a nice tone to the recipe. My niece is vegan and is visiting for the holidays  I’ll make this hot chocolate for both of us.

Chocolate lovers will indeed love this one!  This is a perfect drink for lazing around on a snowy winter day!  I didn't use the nutmeg (my Swedish grandparents wouldn't understand this), but the marshmallow did melt into the drink making it very yummy!  Thanks, Baileys!

My family enjoyed this recipe. It was nice seeing a dairy free liqueur available. I followed the recipe as is. Though, I heated the ingredients in the microwave. Instead of the nutmeg, which I forgot I decided to make it festive with whipped cream and Christmas colored sprinkles. One could keep with the dairy free aspect with coconut whipped cream. I used unsweetened almond milk, but the dark chocolate and marshmallow along with the topping I added made it plenty sweet enough. Ty
