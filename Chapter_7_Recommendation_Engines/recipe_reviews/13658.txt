The original version of this recipe is better, but I can't seem to find it.

It is supposed to have one 8.5 ounce box of jiffy corn muffin mix, not cornbread mix, and 8 ounces of sour cream, not 1 ounce.

I've tried a few cornbread casserole recipes and this is by far the best! I love that there is no egg in it! I will never bother to try another corn casserole recipe again, this one was perfect!  Just a note, you do have to drain the whole kernel corn.

I believe the recipe should have one - 8 ounce sour cream. 
The recipe I use also calls for two eggs.

I made this for a work potluck and it went over great.  I gave the recipe out to a few.  I did take the advice of others and added 8 oz sour cream, 2 eggs and I aded 1/3 cup of white sugar.  The recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the corn and I did.  Next time, I'll leave the juice in.  I also dusted the buttered dish with a light coating of sugar.  This dish was gone in a flash!
Thank you.

We used 3 cups of Marie Calendar's cornbread mix (sweeter than most mixes), about 1/2 cup sour cream, and 4 TBS melted butter. Everybody loved it.

Great way to take ordinary corn bread and transform the traditional into something different, good and very tasty. My family loves this recipe. It's tried and true, I love the texture. I made one adjustment to it because when I cooked it for an hour it was still a little bit mushy so I kept cooking it for about 1 hour and 15 minute to an hour and a half. It was just right!

I love this recipe.  I accidently left out the butter the last time I made this, but the taste is still the same!  I'll be omitting the butter from now on when I make this.

OK, maybe I'm missing the point here but . . . this is just a "cake-y" textured cornbread, right? Not really a "casserole" 'cause there's nothing else in it!  That being said, I tried it anyway.  I made this EXACTLY per the recipe, but it wouldn't hold together--was very "chunky" (?) & didn't appear to have cooked long enough either!  Then, I read the reviews about 8oz. of sour cream (that's a BIG difference allrecipes' editors!) and suggestion of using 2 eggs.  Ummm . . . OK this is what I came up with: 2 eggs, 8oz. sour cream, slightly less than 1/2cup oil, one 15oz. can of creamed-style corn, 2 cups self-rising (white) corn meal, + 2 Tblsp.sugar.  Mix all ingredients together & pour into greased glass 9" x 9" dish and bake at 425 for 40-45 minutes.  A smooth, cakey-textured cornbread that HOLDS together!  (the hotter oven temp. helps "crisp" the edges/sides of this cornbread, making the pieces cut from the edges of the pan preferred!)  Yum!

I LOVE this recipe! I printed it out last year and have made it at least 10 times since. I wouldn't change anything! The only thing I notice is that the recipe doesnt say to drain the can of regular corn. Oh, and it really does need about an hour to bake. but SO YUMMY! :)

1 stick of butter, melted 1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, not drained 1 small can creamed corn 2 packages jiffy cornbread mix 8 ounces sour cream 2 eggs  Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  In a mixing bowl, combine butter, whole corn, cream corn, corn muffin mix and sour cream. Fold all ingredients together, pour into 2 quart casserole dish. Bake for 1 hour.   I looked at a lot of recipes to try and figure out "Becky's" exact recipe.  I am still unsure that this is the correct amounts, but I don't really think you can go wrong  with these ingredients!  This recipe says to cook it for 1 hour... I would check it at 45 minutes.  Enjoy!

I changed the recipe to suit my family.
I used two boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix
and added a cup of buttermilk. I also
peppered the batter.

I also greased the pan with bacon grease.

Very good. We like this with chili or 
warmed the next day with eggs and bacon.

I thought this recipe was very good my family loves it. The recipe I have calls for 1 box of phildelphia cream cheese instead of sour cream.I simply melt butter and cream cheese in microwave for about 2-3 minutes or until soft. I am always asked to bring this dish for family get together and potlucks.

Drain the whole kernel corn. If you don't after 50 minutes it taste uncooked and grainy in the middle. Also, if using Jiffy Cornbread Mix, it taste better if you add at least two tsp. of sugar.

I have made this a few times. The first time I forgot the sour cream, second time I added about 4 ounces of sour cream. I had the same result each time flavor wise however the sour cream adds a fluffiness to it. Others have reported adding eggs, using them will give you more of a firm texture that can be sliced into squares that will retain their shape when put on a plate. Also I have always drained the kernel corn. Any variation I have used, I have never had a bad serving of this recipe!

Came out FANTASTIC!!!  I added 1/3 cup of sugar, and I actually forgot to add the butter and it still came out great!  I also used 8 ounces of sour cream.  I'm definitely making this again.  Hubby enjoyed the cornbread casserole better than the main dish!!!

I, too have the original recipe of this. I usually use the Trader Joes cornbread mix. I was confused, though, the last time I went to make it. It must have been awhile. Do you other cooks who use it drain the regular canned corn? AND the recipe calls for a smaller box of cornbread than I typically use, so I can't remember if I typically double the rest or not. I guess no-one can help me with that one...oh well...wish I could remember, it's so yummy!

Loved this recipe. I actually substituted cream cheese for the sour cream last year for Thanksgiving, and it turned out yummy. Although it was probably a bit more fattening:)

So good, alway make it in a cast iron skillet... and heat the skillet before pouring in the batter.  Crispy edges are my favorite!

Wonderful.  I am making this for Thanksgiving.  The only thing different I did was add a little bit of honey to the top of the casserole when it was done.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this, and I liked it too. We used 2 Tbs butter instead of 1/4 a pound. Also low fat sour cream. About 3 Tablespoons.  2 Tbs make an ounce, so we used more sour cream than the recipe said. And we used corn muffin mix.  We thought mushrooms might go good in it next time. It came out super moist. Added chicken.

I was going for a cornbread that's like bread rather than casserole. 

I customized the recipe by adding another 8.5 oz. Jiffy cornbread mix (total of 2 boxes or 17 oz.). I used 1 15 oz. can whole kernal corn and 1 can of sweet kernel corn, NO Butter, NO sour cream, and 1 egg.  I pre-heated at at 375 degrees and baked for about 30-35 minutes. I sprayed the 9x13 casserole dish with spray to prevent it from sticking. It turned out to be a moist cornbread and was a hit with my party of 9.

I've made this recipe over and over for years, although the version I found years ago has me mix everything in the very same pan that it will be baked it. I use 8oz sour cream, and the last time I made it with Jiffy 8.5oz. I use a round casserole pan and have never had problems. It is a favorite in my family.

I've tried so many other cornbread casseroles and this is by far the best!!! I also used 1 stick butter, 8oz sour cream and two eggs like other reviewers. When I want just a cornbread texture I omit the cream corn and only use frozen(thawed)corn. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the dry ingredients but still only used one can of corn and one can of creamed corn to make a 9x13 pan. It was delicious! This is a new family favorite and pairs well with white chicken chili.

May have been better if it wasn't so full of whole corn. Definitely a "casserole" and not like "bread."

Perfect on top of chili. I didn't have creamed corn, so I used 2 cans of regular corn, a cup of sour cream, and a touch of milk. Delicious.

After going to a Thanksgiving potluck at our church, I tasted this. After going back to get seconds and being dissapointed to find it all gone, I was determined to ferret out the recipe! This is it. The only thing I did different was to add 8 oz sour cream and two eggs like the others said. It is so good and so unbelievably easy. This one will find its way onto my Thanksgiving table next year for sure!

What a wonderful Thanksgiving casserole! My mom wanted to take all the leftovers home.  I used the Mexican-style cornbread and it was very tasty.  We won't wait until next Thanksgiving to make this again.
The kids can whip this one up for you.  It's that easy.

I really didn't know what to expect with this, but decided to give it a try since we love cornbread.  This was awesome, although I wasn't sure how much 1/4 lb. of butter was, so I guessed.  I didn't make any adjustments to this.  However, after 1 hour of cooking, mine was still mushy (maybe this is the way it should be), but it just didn't seem done so I cooked it for an extra 15 minutes and it then came out perfect (a little softer consistency than cornbread).

Been making this recipe several years now.  Everyone loves it.  This recipe calls for "1 oz." sour cream?  My original recipe called for 8 oz., which I changed to 8 oz. cream cheese.  Soften and break up well.  Sour cream is just that - sour.  Cream cheese is sweeter and smoother.  Try it!

Kick it up a notch! I used 3 cups Marie Callender's Low Fat Original Corn Bread. Added 1/4 lb melted butter, 1 can whole corn (don't drain, add the water too), 1can Cream Style Corn,  8 oz sour cream, 2 eggs, 8 packets Splenda and 3 Tbs. dehydrated jalapeno for just a little kick. Cooked it in the smoker with a ham at 275F for 2 hours for a wonderful lightly smoked flavor.

Easy recipe. I usually double recipe and use Jiffy mix. If you do not drain corn you don't need to add butter. Follow directions on box of Jiffy and add rest of ingredients. You have to add egg with my recipe (found out the hard way). I make this for every get together.

This is good but the "original" recipe I got from my Mom over 40 years ago also called for 2 eggs and a 16 oz container of sour cream.  I've always drained the whole kernel corn so the dish isn't quite as wet.

My morning radio show co-host challenged me to cook SOMETHING for our company Thanksgiving luncheon.  I have no cooking experience past making toast, so I thought I'd try this recipe. I practiced the night before and made these alterations:
I drained the whole kernel corn like JMCURTIS suggested, and I added shredded cheddar and some fresh parsley on top at the last ten minutes of baking.  
By the time my co-host arrived at the luncheon yesterday, the casserole was EATEN ALL UP!  Thanks for making me look good, Sarah!!!

I loved this recipe and it was so easy!  It tastes just like the cornbread casserole that's served at Tony Romas.  I accidentally put in too much sour cream (about 4 oz) but it turned out great.  Next time I make it, I will put in the 1 oz. of sour cream that's called for in the recipe and see which one I like better.

This was a great cornbread casserole.  I made it exactly as listed and it came out wonderful.  The kids and hubby really liked it.  I have also frozen it and then thawed and warmed up in the oven.  It was great then too.

This is a great recipe with a few minor changes. It definitely benefits from a better quality brand of creamed corn (my local store brand looks and tastes like corn jello), 8 oz of sour cream, and a longer cooking time is a must! I consistently need to bake the casserole for 1 hour and 15-20 minutes. Overall, it is a treat during the holidays, especially with a dusting of sugar : )

Cramy, sweet comfort food. There isn't any JAZZ to this casserole; it does what the ingredients promise: creates a warm, satisfying comfort side to any home cooked meal. Also great if you're on a budget (this cost me about $2 to make with the butter on hand), and while I'm not a mom, looks like a great way to make a mostly veggie dish accessable & tasty to kids -- I would have loved this when I was 6!!! :) MY ONLY INGREDIENT NOTE: I used 8 oz low fat sour cream & 1/3 c reduced fat margerine and liked the results.

I didn't care for anything related to cornbread when I was a kid, but this one is great. It tasted just as I hoped it might. It finished with a nice, golden brown crisp topping, and was softer underneath, which is a pleasing combination. I'm often looking for simple, easy, delicious side dishes and this one fits the bill. It's so sweet, it almost feels like one is eating a dessert.

This is one of my husbands favorite sides. I use Jiffy corn muffin mix and 8 ounces sour cream. It is great with so many dishes from mexican to southern barbecue. Once in a while I will add a 4 ounce can of green chiles. Very yummy.

I love this basic recipe. One thing I do is right before it's done baking, I take it out and cover it with shredded cheddar or to make it really fancy, I put slices of smoked provolone on it.  Great recipe.

For all the holidays we celebrate, this is one dish we never forget to make. We're corn addicts, and the cornbread casserole is to die for. It satisfies our taste for something sweet, but could be eaten at the same time with other entrees.

I prepared this for 20 people at our family Thanksgiving dinner.  I did add a 4 oz of sour cream and 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I used a box of Jiffy corn meal mix.  This was by far the easiest dish that I prepared and I received several compliments.  I will make this again.

This is good, but not as good as my original recipe (which I couldn't find).
It definitely does require more sour cream...1 ounce?  I think this recipe requires at LEAST a cup.  I also threw in some chopped green chilis.  This recipe was a little "drier" than mine, probably because of the lacking sour cream and like the last reviewer said....eggs!  This wasn't bad, but I think I will still keep looking.

I cooked this last night for my family and it disappeared.  I did add about 1/3 cup sugar to make it a little sweeter, and found it took just under an hour to cook.

Great recipe!  Found it for a friend who raved about, so had to try it myself.  A big hit with my turkey dinner guests.  I can now throw away all the other recipes I've been trying to decide if I liked, or not.  Thanks, so much!

This is a very tasty recipe.  It's best eaten when it comes out of the oven, after sitting in the fridge it gets a bit dry and the corn crumbles off (although it still tastes great).  

I've already made this twice and it's SO easy and it's delicious!

My family devoured this dish! I did make it as some people suggested... added the 2 eggs, 8oz of sour cream, and 1/3 cup of sugar. It was soooo delicious and moist. It's a new holiday staple at our home for sure! Thanks for a great recipe and a big thanks to the reviewers for their suggestions.

I took it out of the oven at 45 minutes instead of a hour so it wouldn't burn. It was alright. Was very bland. I wouldn't go out of my way to make it. It needs some extra flavor to make it pop and stand out.

My Husband loved it. We didn't change it much except it didn't make enough batter for my two quart casserole so I used one of my 12x9 cake pans and it fit perfectly. I will make it again.

I made a double batch and, taking the advice of someone who also made them, I put in 8 oz of sour cream. My cornbread hadn’t cooked in the middle after twice the time in the oven. The middles did not cook done even after an hour. The middles all sank in.

This side went over great with my family of picky eaters . When it came out of the oven, I knew this was going to be as golden as its appearance.  There  was more leftover green bean casserole than this dish at the conclusion of the meal.

No changes were made,  it's great as is,  but I may make a few changes next time like adding jalapeños or  cheddar cheese. I made this for thanksgiving and everyone thought it was undercooked cornbread until I mentioned it's cornbread casserole... nevertheless,  it was delicious!

I make this with the Mexicorn, that has the peppers in it. I also like to add 1/2 green bell pepper and a red bell pepper , both chopped into small chunks. And I only use about half of a small box of Jiffy cornbread Mix. Just enough to thicken the corn, add 1 egg. And it will turn out PERFECT!!!

I've made this before using another recipe that I liked better.  I think it should call for 1 8 oz sour cream instead of 1 oz.  This recipe calls for no eggs either.

Delicious and so easy!  I fried four pieces of bacon (cut in small pieces) and added that to the mixture, along with the bacon grease.  I also added two eggs.  It came out perfect, almost souffle like.  I topped it with three green onions cut in fine slices, including the chives, it gave it a little crunch and added some nice color, as well.  I didn't drain the whole kernel corn and baked in a lightly oiled preheated iron skillet.  Will definitely make this again!

I make this recipe often. The only thing if have changed is i use plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  Mixes perfectly and you can't taste a difference. 
Made a double recipe to take for Thanksgiving dinne and it was a huge hit.

This was good but I would change a couple things next time.  First, after seeing how much butter was needed I kind of lost my appetite when it was finished.  I think it could do with half the quantity.  As for the creamed corn, it can be found on the shelves labeled as "cream styled corn".  Wasn't immediately obvious to me.  I did also use the small portion of sour cream which still tasted fine.  But how could it not taste good with a 1/4 lb of butter.

I make this regularly cause everyone loves it.  The duration of baking time makes a big difference if you like custard, dry or somewhere in between.

I had no luck with this one.  After 2 hours in the oven it still did not set up.  I did not drain my corn so that may have been the problem.

I made it but followed some of the other suggestions and combined with past recipes. I did use 8 ounces of sour cream, 2 eggs and 1/3 cup sugar.  It was a huge hit! Made it along with chili.

This was delicious! Instead of sour cream I used 8oz of cream cheese (for no other reason than I forgot to buy sour cream). Otherwise I stuck to the recipe as is and cooked it for 1 hr. To get the right texture definitely let it cool for 10 mins before serving.

I've made this recipe many times and it is always a hit.  Although it was fine as written, I generally like to halve the butter which makes it a little less greasy.  I make mine in a glass 9 x 13 pan so it comes out on the thin side but I think I like it that way.  I also like that it is firm enough to slice into squares.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  Always looking for good recipes that don't contain eggs (severe allergy), and this one is great.

My kids loved this and asked me to make it again the next night.  I did use about a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I drained the corn.  Mine came out great, firm and I was able to cut it in squares.

I didn't have a can of whole kernel corn so I left that out. I also used only about 1/4 cup of butter, 1/3 cup of Greek yogurt instead of a container of sour cream, and I added one egg and two tablespoons of honey. Baked in a 9" round pan at 350 and it was done in 30 minutes, extremely delicious. Light and fluffy and moist. Served with butter and honey and wow! Thanks.

This is great, as is-- I've made it several times now, and made the mistake of trying to mess with the amount of sour cream once.  That did not turn out well.  Really, keep it to 1 oz!  This last time, I used an 11 oz can of whole kernel corn instead of 15 oz and it was great-- just drain the whole kernel corn.

This is AMAZING as a breakfast dish in leftover form.  Just put a pat of butter on top and a dollop of honey, then microwave for a minute.  Truly awesome.

Made this for my son's birthday party as something different.  It was fantastic.  I did drain the whole corn and used about 8 ounces of sour cream, and used Jiffy corn muffin mix.  Definitely a keeper and many asked for the recipe.

Tastes good. Just made it yesterday, for part of the family's thanksgiving day spread.  It's sweet, sliceable, and has a much more pleasant consistency than i anticipated.  Only thing that i "might" say negative, was a very strange, "smoky" aftertaste (for lack of better words).  Overall a decent dish.

As others suggested, I added two eggs. I was out of sour cream, so I used 3/4 cups buttermilk, which worked out well. To turn this recipe into a hearty meal, I like to add a couple of sliced chicken breasts (cooked ahead of time) and a can of mixed vegetables and then serve it with some brown gravy.

This wasn't at all what I was looking for.  The casserole was way too gummy without a lot of flavor.  I think the 1/4 pound of butter was overkill.  Based on the reviews I was really looking forward to making this, but I will never make this recipe again.

I went to an engagement party last night and the soon to be groom's grandmother had made this.  It was so delicious I had to have the recipe!  She told me she use 1 box of Jiffy cornbread mix plus the above ingredients.  But she added 1 can of diced green chili's, which added so much flavor!!!!  I am hanging on to this recipe plus adding the green chili's for work potlucks!

Use 8 oz. of sour cream & do not drain corn.  EASY crowd pleaser.  I made 2 of these & they were gone in a flash.

I sauteed 2 large onions in butter. Then I turn off stove and mix in 8 ozs sour cream. Then poured this into corn mixture  and mixed in cheese.  ooh this is good.  My niece requests this every time. I am bringing it to Thanksgiving meal today.

I made this for Thanksgiving and added about 4 ounces of sour cream, drained the whole kernel corn, and best of all addded 1/4 cup of sugar. It was a big hit, the sugar added just a bit of sweetness.

I use the Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix and instead of canned corn I use the frozen whole kernel extra sweet and cream corns.  The honey and the extra sweet sweetens it perfect and I don't have to add any sugar.  I also use a whole 8 ounce tub of sour cream.  It seems that was the recipe years ago when I found it on here.  I recently lost it and cannot find it again.

Awesome and so easy!  Great Holiday recipe! Like others, I agree the sour cream should be 8 oz - I even used Dean's Vegetable Dip instead - it added a lot of flavor and was great addition to this recipe.  Thanks for a keeper!

Thist recipe is similar to another I have tried and I must say I like the other better.  I think that the ingredient list may be off a bit as 1 oz. of sour cream seems inadequate.  I will go back to the "Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole" recipe on the site.

I have been using this recipe for years and it is wonderful. I always use Jiffy corn muffin mix. I am sure the 1 ounce of sour cream is a typo mine calls for 8 ounces or you can even leave it out.  This is a great recipe that goes with most anything from meatloaf to bbq'd anything. Try it you will make this again and again.

I made this to go with our taco soup tonight...it was a huge hit! I didn't have cornbread mix on hand, so I used corn muffin mix. I used only the cream of corn, a little less butter(I added the rest of the melted butter to the pan), 1 can chopped green chiles and 1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese. My daughter, who normally wouldn't eat a dish like this, couldn't get enough. Thanks for sharing!

I made it according to the recipe with one change -- I had to use a different size of cornbread mix (7pz).  I couldn't find the larger size required.  As for the sour cream, I used 2 T (Would that be one ounce?) of light sour cream.  The resulting bread was a hit.  Leftovers would make a good breakfast with a couple of sausage links and some fruit.

Everyone loves this side-dish.  It is so easy to make and comes out perfect everytime.  I usually cook it a little more than 1 hour because we don't like it mushy.  Delicious.  I make it for every holiday!

I also used 1 stick butter, 8oz sour cream and two eggs like recommended my other helpful reviewers. However I did not use the whole kernel corn, and I only put in just over half the can of creamed corn. This is my first time using any recipes on allrecipes.com, and I am really just learning to cook. I am not quite the seasoned professional that can through things together and take risks. When I started mixing everything up I thought there was way to much liquid, and not enough jiffy. I thought, oh, great this is just going to simmer in the oven and by the time my fiancé gets home we can have cornbread soup! But sure enough in an hour it was golden brown and perfect. SUCCESS!!! I can say I will defiantly be more trusting in the future, and if there are anymore newbie's like me, don't fear, you are not making soup. Plus this is the best cornbread I have ever had.

I quadrupled this recipe to feed a crowd of 15 people for our Thanksgiving dinner...I expected to have plenty of leftovers, but EVERYONE loved it so much, it was gone very quickly. I did add an entire 8 oz. container of sour cream, but other then that I stuck to the recipe. I will definitely be making this again and again.

It was alright.  TOO MUCH CORN for me.  It was more corn than cornbread.  I plan to try the recipe with only the cream corn and without the can of regular corn.

My husband loved this!  He was after me to make the casserole his grandma brought to a family picnic.  She had told me the recipe but I had forgotten it.  This is the next best thing....a definite redo!
