As stated, very easy to make as it is basically cream cheese icing served on graham crackers. It was ok, but not something I would likely make again for myself.

This was delicious!! My husband probably ate the whole bowl on his own! Not as sweet as I thought it would be but it worked really well with chocolate graham crackers and apples.

I made this for a Christmas party at work and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe and served it with Teddy Grahams. It was yummy and I will be making it again. As noted before it was not really sweet which is why I think it went over so well.
