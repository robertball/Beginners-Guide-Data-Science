I have a little bit of a mixed review here so I am going with 4 star. Pistachio's are $10 a pound here and then you have the hassle of getting the shell off before chopping. I could taste them yes but were they worth it in the end? To me, no. I would have been just as content by adding more cheddar and calling it good. Hubby on the other hand enjoyed the pistachio addition very much. Maybe I just don't care for my nuts to be be warm and softened? Give them a try and you decide for yourself.
