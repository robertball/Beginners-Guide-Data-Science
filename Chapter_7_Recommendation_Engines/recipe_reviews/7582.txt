I actually really liked this - I thought of it as a lemon curd. I actually mixed up a couple of techniques. 1) used all lemon juice, no orange juice. 2) Stirred in the butter after taking it off the heat. 3) Added 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest along with the butter. 4) Strained it through a sieve into a bowl. 

I'm planning to use it as a filling between layers of a lemon cake.

Turned out really badly. Actually spoilt my cheesecake. People said the sauce tasted funny. I might have gotten the measurements wrong because the butter I used didn't come marked in teaspoons so I used measuring spoons to measure the butter.

I agree with the previous rater, I don't like this.  I know what the weird taste is though that she talked about, it's the eggs.  It might be ok between a couple of layers of cake but not for a topping
