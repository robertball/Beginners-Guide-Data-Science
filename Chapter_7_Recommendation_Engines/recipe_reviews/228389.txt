Wow! This pizza was awesome. It has become my new favorite on this site and I've probably tried 10 others. The flavors went together so well! Normally adding goat cheese to a pizza gives it too much bite and not very much flavor. I couldn't find blocks of provolone so I used Mozzarella instead. The two balanced each other perfectly. I caramelized the onion by using about half the amount of oil suggested and instead just brushed the pizza with fresh olive oil to make up the difference. The herbs on top of the pizza is really what made it. It brought the whole thing together. I will definitely make this one again!

The whole family really likes this pizza. I've made this exactly as written and it's terrific; I've also had great results swapping roasted red peppers for the sundried tomatoes, mozzarella cheese for provolone (or keeping the provolone and just adding mozzarella!), and adding roasted chicken and/or fresh saut√©ed spinach - so many combinations, all SO delicious! Our fav local market sells balls of fresh pizza dough that we use instead of the kind you unroll from a can. The toppings are awesome, but a great crust makes pizza that much better.

This recipe was very rich, dry, and bland as written. The sundried tomato and goat cheese dominated everything, and the provolone didn't add any flavor. The basic idea is good, and the changes I would make next time are:  coat the pizza crust with olive oil and lots of fresh garlic, halve the sundried tomatoes, 3/4 the goat cheese, omit the provolone, sprinkle parmesan cheese, add baby bellas and possibly green bell pepper to the sauteed onions. This would add more flavor and texture variety.  I also didn't see any benefit from pre-cooking the crust.

DELICIOUS!! 
I mixed it up a little bit. I used a very thin layer of canned pizza sauce on the crust and sprinkled that with cayenne pepper. I omitted the provolone and spread some mozzarella on top of the goat cheese instead. Loved it. I will definitely be making this again!
