Years ago, I would have given this a better rating. However, many years of cooking (and eating) in 5 Southern States has taught me that SELF rising Flour is better to use than meal. Also IF you must use meal, make it FRESH, home done FINELY crushed Saltine Cracker Meal. The best oil to fry them in is Peanut Oil as it has a higher burning point.

The cornmeal didn't stick well & had no taste. Better season well & dip in egg or milk before frying. I think I will stick to my ole standby of frying in Louisana seasoned fish fry. Thats the best.. Dredge in egg & then batter!

I dipped them in egg before the cornmeal, and when they were done we sprinkled them with grated fresh parm cheese.

I first tried this recipe because of the book and movie "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe".  For all who haven't seen or read it, both the book and movie are wonderful.  However, the recipe in the book calls for bacon drippings instead of vegetable oil, which I've found adds a good deal of flavor, just to let you know.  This is a great recipe for when you just want something quick.

A true southern recipe! I used self rising cornmeal as this is the only way I have ever seen them made in the south. No egg should be added because it will take away from the flavor. You must try, they have a a lovely sweet and sour taste. To be a really southern dish serve with grits. The best!!!

I fried the first slice according to the recipe and ended up adding a little flour to the cornmeal, garlic salt, onion powder, cayenne, then dipped in cornmeal mixture, then in an egg wash, and back into the cornmeal before frying.

Ohhhhh...yum!  This is my favorite summer splurge!  Made these tonight and they are absolutely delicious.  The cornmeal is the secret here.  I add paprika and s & P to the meal for color and flavor.  Slice the tomatoes 1/4 inch thick, this is a must. Sprinkle with Kosher salt as soon as they are out of the frying pan. I use bottled ramoulade sauce for dipping.  So easy and so good!

Try a different batter!  I made the recipe with cornmeal. When fried, it made my tomatoes taste like popcorn!

This wasn't very tasty  for me.  The cornmeal didn't get very crunchy, but maybe I was doing something wrong.  I had to salt it tons in order to make it taste less bland.  I'll try other "batters" for frying things on this site.

I tried this recipe with very firm red tomatos.they tasted great after slicing i dipped each slice in egg wash before dipping in corn meal. For added crispness. This is superb.

I used red tomatoes which made it a little messy but they still tasted great and received lots of compliments.  I'd definatly try this one again!

This is a great starting point for fried green tomatoes I only suggest a flour/cornmeal breading mix, but over all I found it tasty and easy to make. I did actually try the recipe EXACTLY as you wrote it. Thank You for sharing it.
