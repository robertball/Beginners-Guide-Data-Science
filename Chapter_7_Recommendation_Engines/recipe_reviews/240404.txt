This was delicious, but I did adjust the measurements according to our tastes. I can't say that I really 'measured' anything, but I did use less celery and onion than called for and 1/2 of the rosemary, as it can be strong for us. Also, I wanted to serve this on sandwiches, so I did not use the lettuce leaves, but I did drizzled the ham salad w/ ranch dressing before serving, which gave this a nice extra layer of flavor. I'm used to making my ham salad w/ only ham, relish, pepper and mayo, so this was def a nice change and one I will be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

A bit simple - heavy on onion. Added much more ham

I didn't go by the measurements but by what we like and just used the ingredients as my guide!  My family loves this and will be making it again!

I thought the proportions of celery and onion were too much for the 8 ounces of meat.  I won't make it again.
