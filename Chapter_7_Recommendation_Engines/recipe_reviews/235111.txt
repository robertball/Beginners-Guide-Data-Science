I liked this, but I did with it what I do with another recipe...I put the chicken in plain first (spray crock with cooking spray), let it cook for 3-4 hours on HIGH, DRAIN it, then add the sauce & continue to cook on HIGH for about 30 min. to 1 hr. longer.  This way, it isn't too watery!  The chicken is so tender made this way, my family loves it.

This recipe would be fine for a quick and easy slow cooker meal. Certainly a huge help for a busy day. However, it really wouldn't be much different than just pouring on Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. I couldn't even detect a hint of the red pepper flakes, and Ray doesn't really need any extra sugar since it's quite sweet to begin with.

I really loved how simple this was.  I didn't have high expectations for the taste but it was really good.  I didn't even have to preseason the chicken.  Straight out the package and into the slow cooker.  Tonight I'm trying it on ribs.  The only thing I changed is I didn't add much sugar. Maybe a tablespoon if that.  The sauce is already sweet enough to me.

Update:  I tried it with pork ribs tonight and it was just a a good as with the chicken.  This is a keeper!

I did something different. I added fresh chopped sweet onions & fresh garlic with white wine. Removed powder onion. Let that Simmer for 1 hour. Then added the rest of the ingredients. I removed distilled white vinegar and added apple cider vinegar instead in slow cooker. Once they are mixed, added chicken thighs with no skin and with bone. Turned heat to Low. Oh Boy! my house smells good.

This recipe was so easy to make! I threw it together in just a few minutes before I left for work. Not sure how it tastes because my family forgot to save me some and ate it all up before I got home.

I didn't mix the ingredients together in a bowl (to save a dish), just poured them on top of the chicken breasts and mixed them around with the chicken breasts as they cooked.  I used two enormous frozen chicken breasts and they were done in less than six hours, so I don't think the cooking time is accurate.  As for the problem with the sauce being watery, I noticed that and solved it by cracking the lid on the crock pot (about 1" or so) for the last hr. they cooked, turning them once, so the sauce could reduce and carmelize a bit.  They were delicious, but next time I think I'll add more chicken, because there was a lot of sauce.  Served it with garlic butter rice and corn, and it was a big hit with the kids!  I just hope my crock pot comes clean after soaking all day and night.

A hit at our house!  I love NC BBQ and the vinegar and red pepper flakes did the trick.  In order to get every last drop of BBQ sauce out of the bottle I popped off the spout, poured in the vinegar, shook, and voila!

As others have said, if you use a good bbq sauce, you can skip the additional ingredients. Best tip I saw in the reviews was to cook chicken for a couple hours without the sauce, then pour off the liquid, then add the sauce.

I made this today, and it was very good. I used chicken leg quarters because that's what I had. I served it with broccoli mac & cheese and corn on the cob. It was perfect for a Monday.

FANTASTIC! Perfect amount of kick! I shredded the chicken breasts and put them back in the BBQ sauce for just a few minutes. Served on a Portugese Roll with a side dish of stir fried green beans w/slivered almonds. Just enough so I was able to have dessert.

My husband actually made this and it was delicious! He followed the recipe - the only change he made was adding more red pepper. He shredded the chicken and put it in between toasted buns - it was messy and oh so good!! Served with fries, sweet tea and a lot of napkins our kids loved it, too. We will make this again.

Honestly I have no idea how something so simply can taste so wonderful! I found some chicken thighs on sale and wasn't quite sure what to do with them. Came across this recipe and followed as posted. As soon as I took the first bite, I knew that I was taking a plate for lunch the next day. The flavor was amazing! I read some of the comments about the watery sauce, that didn't bother us as we were going for the bbq flavor and not the actually sauce itself. Although I would recommend if it's too watery to pour some sauce on top of the chicken once out the crock pot and maybe even crisp it in the oven...  
My boyfriend, who for some some strange reason is obsessed with Gold Carrol's bbq chicken, told me this recipe was 10x better than G.C.'s... In this household trust me that's a compliment! (Everything I make is compared to them). This will be my go to for indoor bbq chicken!

I made this yesterday and it turned out great.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I made some modifications to the recipe.  I am cooking for one in a 1.5 qt crock pot so I split the recipe in half.  

I used Stubb's original flavor barbecue sauce since I prefer that to Baby Ray's.   I added a 1/2 of chicken broth and black pepper.  I also added way more crushed red pepper since I like my food spicy.

About 3.5 hours into the cook time, I shredded the chicken and let it continue to cook for the last 30 minutes.  Everything turned out really well!  I will definitely use this again.

I used frozen chicken breasts - cooked on high for one hour turned down to low for 3 hours. Added a tablespoon of honey. I was very nervous about the vinegar but it cooked down. The red pepper flakes gave it a little spice with the sweet. Excellent! Next time I will place the chicken on the grill to crisp it up. Excellent recipe!

Really quick and good. We cut it in half for the two of us, use extra garlic, and use extra apple cider vinegar instead of distilled. Try it over rice so you don't waste any of the excellent sauce. Those averse to heat are suggested to cut the pepper flakes to a quarter tsp or less.

Mine ended up with watery BBQ juice and my chicken wasn't very moist.  I did cut my pieces a little smaller than keeping them in whole breasts, but I don't think that attributed to the watery juicy.  May give it another try....don't know. Not a thrill of a dinner.

It seemed weird to me that it could cook for 4 - 6 hours.  That's a big range!  I made only two large chicken breasts so I cut the ingredients for the sauce in half but followed the recipe and cooked it for 5 hours.  I used Sonny's Sweet BBQ Sauce and wondered if adding the brown sugar would make it too sweet, but it didn't.  It was very yummy.  As others have commented, it makes a LOT of sauce and it is very runny.    When (not if) I make it again, I will make 1/4 of the sauce for two breasts unless I am serving it with rice or something to sop it up.   Hubby liked it and said I should make it again.  Not exactly diet food, but what the heck.  It was easy and very tasty!  We had enough left overs to have pulled chicken on a bun later on.

Did like others recommend, chicken for 4 hrs removed liquid, then added the sauce, but I put the chicken on a bed of chopped onion and saved the stock along with some of the onion and chicken for soup.  I also skipped the brown sugar and used fresh chopped garlic instead of powder.  We liked that the vinegar and pepper made the sweet baby rays  more tangy with more complex flavor.

I'm going out of five stars because it's not finished yet and I know it's going to be delicious. I put four large quarters in a crockpots going skin side down. Next star chop some sweet onion and fresh garlic scattered on top and then some dry seasonings. After about four hours I plan to drain off the juice and fat from the skin flip the babies over and add barbecue sauce. Turn the heat down to low and let it rock along to their summer in about three hours then go to hold for dinner. I'll take a picture before they come out of the park later and how they turned out?

I used chicken quarters and started with then frozen.  I should have thawed them first.   Ended up with bbq sauce being too watered down from chicken being frozen.  Other than that it was good and super tender.

We really liked this.  The only change I made was to use aluminum foil balls at the bottom as a platform for the chicken..this shortened the cooking time to 3 hours.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was absolutely delicious!!  Once cooked I shredded the chicken with a fork, placed it on a nice bun, added a couple of dill pickles and voila--a super simple and easy dinner DONE!!!

Tasty spicy and easy to prepare. Chicken tasted great and plenty left over so I used extra sauce over rice and a side salad and a great meal. Recommend it to anyone.

I've made this in the crock pot  with a whole chicken many times and my husband has almost devoured the entire thing.  And all I use is a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays, vinegar and brown sugar.  Even my picky mom likes it.

Easy to make and good.  I was not concerned about the sauce being watery as I was just aiming for flavorful chicken without the gooey mess. I put it in rinsed and still frozen and just turned them a couple of times during cooking.  I served it leftover rice and steamed green beans.

I followed the recipe as written. I did try to add rice an hour before the end but that was a disaster. The chicken turned out delicious but even after an extra 30 mins the rice was still uncooked. I will make this again but will not try adding the rice.

I only had bone in chicken, so I made 1/2 a recipe using 2 breasts & cooked on high for 3.5 hrs. Also, I didn’t have white vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar instead & it worked out fine. Will definitely make again!

My children are far from picky eaters but they're more of a grazing throughout the day type eaters. They LOVED this recipe. I've added the BBQ sauce to my index card recipe box. they asked for seconds and the hubby loved it as well. There were no left overs that night! 

*I used less red pepper flakes though just for a tiny kick.

I cooked chicken for 2 hours then poured off (and saved) most of the liquid and then I covered with BBQ sauce and cooked 3 more hours.  I used slow cooker.  What a great idea and a great supper without a whole lot of fuss!

I made this with one change: Cook the chicken in the crockpot for an hour on low to release all the water in the meat, then add sauce ingredients and follow recipe.  One reviewer gave this technique that totally solved the watery sauce that was inedible and flavorless  for a previous dish.

Made it according to the recipe. Had leftover mashed potatoes, so used those instead of rice. Tasted better than you would think. My mistake though, is I left the chicken in too long. The chicken was too done to our liking and made cutting it into bite size pieces tough. Like I said my mistake! Will remove chicken sooner to let cool. One thing I did do was to strain the sauce into a separate pan and add the cornstarch mixture to that. Made thickening a little faster. After thickening somewhat I returned the sauce to the crockpot and added the cut up chicken. 
The wife and I will have the rest over rice tonight.

I cook for only myself and 1 other person, so I am always on the lookout for recipes (especially slow cooker recipes) that be easily cut down to a size that will feed us for one meal with no leftovers. This looked really good for that. THE PROS:  it was very easy. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, totaling about 1 lb and cut the ingredients for the sauce in half. I did not add the red pepper flakes as we do not do spicey things very well. Anyway, for the barbeque sauce, it worked well as I actually used a couple of different kinds of barbeque sauce that I had on hand and wanted to clear out of the frig! The chicken was very moist and tender, yet the pieces held together well - not always the case when cooking boneless, skinless chicken breast pieces! The sauce tasted very good to us.  THE CONS:  I gave this recipe only 4 stars because there was WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE AND IT WAS VERY THIN. Even though I only used about a cup of the bottled barbeque sauce, with the addition of the vinegar (and I used cider vinegar because I did not have any white on hand - I don’t think that really matters) and the steaming that adds moisture while it cooks in the slow cooker, I ended up with almost 2 cups of LEFTOVER sauce! That’s AFTER we used sauce on the chicken we ate! I am going to freeze the leftover sauce and make this again and will just re-use the sauce I am freezing to cook the chicken in. At the end, I plan to mix a little cornstarch with water and add to the sauce in the slo

This turned out really well. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce, but also added some chopped onion and minced garlic. It’s really easy; I had frozen chicken breasts, so I just added a little extra time. Served it over brown rice with mixed veggies on the side.

Very delicious. I cut the chicken breast in half and it cooks faster but really you could just cook this in the bbq sauce and you’d have almost the same taste.

Amazing! I only gave it 4 stars because I made some slight changes. I doubled the red pepper flakes for extra heat and didn't add the brown sugar (personal preference). I shredded the chicken and had sandwiches. We LOVED it!

Super easy to make. My first slow cooker meal and it came out flavorful and moist. I used honey bbq sauce so the result was a little too sweet, but otherwise very enjoyable. I mixed the ingredients in a bowl (except the chicken) and placed them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning I added everything to the slow cooker and went to work. It was ready in the afternoon. Now to more complicated things.

It turned out very good.  I would make this again.  When making only two chicken breasts use only half the bottle of sauce but if using savory sauce try leaving the amount of brown sugar the same, otherwise cut everything else in half also.  I drained the chicken before pouring the sauce over, I basted the chicken a couple of times with the sauce during the last hour of the cooking process.

I'm always looking for easy, tasty slow cooker recipes and this one was great.  I used Stubbs hickory bourbon bbq sauce and left out the red pepper flakes as I didn't have any.  There's nothing fancy to it, but for solid dinner on a busy night it works.  I served it with mashed potatoes and my husband said to make again.

So the first time I made it, I left the chicken all day while I was working (10 hours eek!). It came out very dry because of that so I turned it into pulled chicken sandwhiches and it tasted just fine with the extra bbq sauce.

I made it again but only had it in for a little over 4 hours and it was so juicy and delicious! 

It's definitely a hard recipe to completely mess up as it was delicious both times, I highly reccommend paying attention to the time though! 

Great introductory recipe for using a crock pot!

We had guests over and it was a success! Next time I will follow the suggestion to reduce the watery sauce. Also, we went with a mesquite sauce so we should've used less vinegar and I would've preferred more chili flakes or ground red pepper. We had some butter fried zucchini and yellow squash with seasoned rice on the side.

Took other reviewers' recommendations re: cooking breasts first, draining liquid and then adding BBQ mixture (per recipe).  Found chicken was overcooked--tough, but the BBQ sauce was a WINNER!!  Going to try making the BBQ sauce on the oven (for approx. 1 hour) and then just stirring in some rotisserie chicken slices to warm it up.  Again, the BBQ sauce is so worth making it again!!  Thanks for posting!  
UPDATE:  Made this again with following  changes:  Made BBQ sauce following recipe.  Purchased a rotisserie chicken and sliced the meat into strips.  Preheated the oven to 300 degrees.  Sprayed a 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.  Spread enough of the prepared BBQ sauce to coat the bottom.  Added the chicken pieces on top.  Used the remainder of the BBQ sauce to pour over the chicken.  Covered the pan with foil and cooked for 30 minutes.  YUM!!!   Highly recommend!!!

It was good, but a little tangy for my grandkids.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Hawaiian sauce...easy recipe to follow.

I didn't add brown sugar and I used apple cider vinegar. Still turned out great. I shredded the chicken and put it back in the  cooker for a couple hours. I ate it on a hoagie style bun. It  happily fed this bachelor 4x. Will make it again for sure.

Made it but used another users suggestion of cooking chicken first and draining it before adding sauce ingredients. Came out perfect! So easy and added more chicken because I have a big family. They loved it!

I used half a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle sauce and skipped the vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Turned out wonderful! Will definitely make it again.

left out the vinegar and used beer.  It really does come down to the quality of the bbq sauce you use, if it's cheap it tastes like it.  Spend the extra change and get the good stuff.

This definitely wasn't bad, but it was a little tough. I think that next time I make it I'll tear the chicken up once it's cooked and then cook it longer. I did like the added vinegar to keep it from being too sweet.

We enjoyed the slow cooker chicken, but I would cook the chicken for a while first, drain the juice off and then pour on the barbeque sauce. It was a nice way to cook on a busy day.

I made this recipe as written but followed the advice of one of the other reviewers by adding onion.  I sliced an onion thinly and put it into the slow cooker first (after spraying the slow cooker with cooking spray).  I placed 3 large whole chicken breasts in next and covered it all with the sauce mixture.  I mistakenly cooked it on high for the first 3 hours and cooked it one more hour on low.  It still came out great.  It's a very forgiving recipe.  We have enough cooked chicken left over to use for a chicken casserole - probably something Southwest/Mexican.  My husband really liked it  a lot.  One thing I would do differently next time is to try halving the sauce ingredients because it made too much.  Also, I would omit the red pepper flakes.  Sweet Baby Ray's is spicy enough for us.

I have replaced the sugar and barbecue sauce with good old South African chutney.  Result was lovely. A very simple to make dish. I have dished it with steamed vegetables, oyster mushrooms and wild rice.

Absolutely delicious! I doctored it up a bit by adding 1 Tbsp of minced Garlic and 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce for a smokey flavor. I also used Kraft BBQ Sauce.  In the last hour, I spread shredded cheddar on top, It was DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe with 5 large chicken breasts. I didn't have brown sugar so I just sprinkled a bit of raw sugar but it didn't really need it. I also added 2 fresh sweet onions, paprika, and cayenne pepper. After 6 hrs, I shredded the chicken and returned it to the sauce. Served it on buns. Came out delicious!!!

5 Stars for ease of preparation, 4.5 for taste of result.  I prepared this using a Dutch oven, in a oven set @ 250º.  Love how simple preparation is.  I used a different BBQ sauce that didn't include  HFCS.  The chicken this creates is great for building a special sandwich.  Mine was BBQ Chicken, cole slaw, and avacado wedges on a hero roll.  Yummy!

This was wonderful!  I used some home-made BBQ sauce and followed the ingredients/instructions to the letter, ending up with delicious results!  Definitely better than just dumping a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's over the meat by itself, which I have done.  This had a slightly smokey, deeper & richer flavor than using the sauce alone. 
Thank you for a simple, quick to prepare, slow cooker recipe!

Made as directed, the chicken tasted just like vinegar - the flavors didn't work well together.

Incredibly easy to make. I omitted the sugar and used most of a bottle of Ray's bbq (as much as I could squeeze  out easily) and used ACV instead of white vinegar. After 3 hours, there was a lot of liquid, so I cracked the lid open, but it didn't help much. What helped was when I shredded the chicken. That sopped up all the watery bbq sauce. Ultimately, I cooked on low for 4 hours and the shredded chicken bbq turned out pretty yummy!

This is very simple to make.  I started with frozen chicken breast and it turned out well.  I cut the brown sugar in half and it was a nice blend of sweet and spicy.  Served this over white sticky rice and 'Green Beans' from AR.

My husband and I love this recipe. Bit of advice for all, but especially for those saying their chicken was too tough, cook it for 6 hours even if it looks done at 4. The longer you cook, the more tender your meat. I usually reduce the amount of sugar I use. I put the meat straight into the crockpot from my freezer. Love to eat on a baked potato!

Loved this recipe! My family and I loved it! I didn't use brown sugar I used white sugar instead since I didn't have any. I also didn't use vinegar because I didn't have any of that either. I added extra red pepper flakes because we love spice. It was amazing!! Sweet and spicy...addictive. Definitely will make this again :)

This is an excellent recipe! I added  half a sweet onion and cooked it on low for 4 hours.  I shredded the chicken and put it back in the crockpot for another hour. I made this for a BBQ potluck at my job and my co workers cleaned the crock pot! My family loved it too. I will definitely make it again.

Everyone loved it! I used regular chicken and the meat fell right off the bones! I didn't have red pepper flakes but it still came out delicious!
