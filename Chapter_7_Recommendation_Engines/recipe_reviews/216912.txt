This wasn't what I had in mind for the shrimp curry I was craving, but it turned out nicely.  I substituted the milk for coconut milk to give it more of a Thai flavor.  The curry flavor wasn't as strong as I would prefer.  But the meal was delicious and my three year old even liked it!

Great recipe! I normally cook a recipe exactly as listed the first time, but did make a few changes.  I had no celery, so I left it out.  I generally add a shake of salt to my rice while cooking.  

Additionally, I tasted while cooking the sauce and had to make a few slight changes.  I doubled the curry powder, added a good shake of red pepper and an additional dash of salt.  I grated too much cheese, so I added it to the sauce (about an additional 1/2 cup). I also added some salt and curry powder to the shrimp while cooking it (but did not put the liquid from the shrimp pan into the casserole).  Lastly, next time I will add the rice, shrimp and sauce in layers.  I almost stirred the sauce (as opposed to inserting with the tines of the fork) and it still did not get to the bottom of the rice.  This would also be good with some steamed brocolli or sweet peas added prior to baking.

Love it!

This was excellent!  I made some modifications, partially based on the other reviews, and partly to make it healthier:  I used brown rice, doubled the curry, and I added some diced carrot to the celery and onion for sweetness and I left out the sugar.  I also added in some ginger and garlic after step one.  It was very flavourful!

Used brown rice, a whole onion finely chopped, and 8oz sliced mushrooms instead of the celery. Did not use any sugar. At the end, I mixed rice, sauce, and shrimp all together before putting in the baking dish. The flavor was quite mild, so next time I will do as other reviewers and double the curry. All in all it was tasty! *Update* Was making this dish tonight for the third time and decided to sub quinoa for the rice. We really liked it, and I will use the quinoa in place of the rice from now on-so much more nutritious for you! I also have upped the curry to a rounded TBS.

It was pretty good. I substituted rice for potatoes with  turmeric and cumin. I also added Hot Madras Curry Powder instead of a regular one. All my guests like it and ask for a recipe.

My four year old loved it! I didn't have any celery or onion, so I just put the milk in a saucepan, added the curry powder, flour, half the salt, 1/2 tsp celery salt and 1/2 tsp onion powder, and brought it to a boil, stirring constantly with a wisk. I also added a bit extra cheese both in the sauce and on top, probably 1/2 cup extra in total. I prepared the rest as described, though I cut my shrimp into smaller pieces. Makes a good family meal.

Hi! This is my recipe and I want to thank everyone for the great reviews. Editorially,I'd recommend doubling or even tripling the amount of curry that is used. I also mix it all together prior to putting it in the casserole, get more even distribution. This recipe can definitely be frozen. In my opinion, it is one of those that absolutely tastes better on the second day. Glad you all enjoy!

This dish was scrumptious, even to my curry-loathing husband. I did make a few adjustments to suit our tastes;  I added 3 grated garlic cloves, a little slice of grated ginger, and dash of red pepper flakes, with the onions and celery. I used a can of coconut milk and 3/4 can milk, added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese to the sauce, and doubled the curry powder & salt. Also added some frozen peas right before layering (rice, shrimp, sauce, rice, shrimp, sauce, cheese)  Btw. My (tiny) shrimp weren't cooked, so baked them in the oven for approx. 5 minutes with some salt and lemon juice, before adding. Thanks for this great dish MsKillian

I made this tonight for dinner, I substituted rigatoni pasta for the rice.  I also layered it, starting with lightly buttering the bottom of my pyrex dish, then noodles, shrimp, sauce, repeat, I ended with extra cheese.  I also saut√©ed 3 cloves of garlic in with my onion and used Madras curry.  My husband gave it an "11"

My family loved this curried shrimp recipe. I also made revisions, The sauce was too bland, so I doubled the curry and added some ground red pepper.  Instead of layering as indicated in recipe, I added cream sauce to the shrimp in the casserole dish, and then stirred the rice into the casserole.  Grated the cheese and added on top with paprika before baking.  Made it for Christmas Eve late lunch with salad and fresh baked bread.   I have been told that this is now a required holiday recipe!  No leftovers!

A great recipe that you can adjust as you like.  You like a hotter curry, double the curry powder.  Not a fan of celery or onion, omit, it still tastes great. Plain yogurt would be an excellent substitute for the milk, if needed.  A quick short cut.... buy the shrimp at the fresh  meat counter at the grocery store, and have them steam it. (many stores do this free of charge).

Liked this a lot.  Doubled curry powder as suggested but otherwise made as written.  I will add a little cayenne or Old Bay next time to up the spiciness (I used mild sweet curry powder)

This was pretty good. Didn't change anything except my celery/onion measure was about a cup each.  Otherwise made this tonight exactly as directed and DH went back for seconds which almost NEVER happens. Have discovered curry only recently and this was a real nice way to enjoy it. Thanks for another regular rotation dinner.

I followed what other reviewers suggested:  more curry, I used coconut milk, ginger, garlic, and added peas.  I also blended everything, then added the additional cheese for baking.  I omitted the sugar and lemon because I used coconut milk.  It was delicious!!!

I made this recipe to bring to a casserole potluck with my extended family. It was relatively simple to make. I prepared the rice in my rice cooker, which saved on time and effort. I love shrimp and the curry sauce had good flavors. My family liked it without the heat/spice that is associated with curries, so this recipe was great for that. If I were to just make it at home, next time I might try to add some heat with some red pepper or maybe some finely chopped jalapeno.

Loved it! My 4 year old asked me to make it all the time :) The only changes I made were using only 1 cup of uncooked rice instead of a cup and a half. I also added a handful of little button mushrooms. Mmmmm...
btw, I just cooked  my shrimp in the sauce before pouring it over the rice. worked like a charm.

It was great but next time I make it I'll make only one cup of uncooked rice and I'll add more curry powder. 
I also spooned a little of the sauce on the rice before I added the shrimp which seemed easier than trying to stick a fork thru between the shrimp1

We found it a bit boring, and there was not enough sauce for the amount of rice so it was dry.  If I made it again, I think I would just make the sauce, add the shrimp just before serving and ladle it over the rice- no baking.

I used brown rice, as others suggested, and added mushrooms.  Didn't bother with the lemon and sugar.  Was very good.  I will double this for an Orange County Wine Society mini-tasting!

I made this last night as written. I was a little skeptical about having cheddar on shrimp but it was great!
I am actually eating the leftovers right now. I do agree with other reviews that the curry powder should be increased. You can taste it but it's not that prominent.  I mixed all together and then topped with cheese before baking.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used two pounds of large shrimp and adjusted the recipe for the extra shrimp and mixed in some frozen  broccoli for a veggie.  Served with garlic toast.  Family loved it.
