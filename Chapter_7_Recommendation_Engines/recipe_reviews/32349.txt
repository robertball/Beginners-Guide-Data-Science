Great recipe! For anyone who may need a bit of clarification (like me), here is what I discovered. It takes about 6 limes to get a cup of juice. You can make simple syrup by heating equal parts sugar and water in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Simple syrup and bitters can also be purchased rather inexpensively at the liquor store. I used Meyers dark rum and grated about a half teaspoon of fresh nutmeg over the top of the whole batch and stirred it in. The punch has a really wonderful flavor and a bit of a delayed effect so watch out! Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again.

quite yummy, i put malibu rum in it too for an extra kick. and the saying is easy to remember!! friends and family all thought it quite tasty too.
reminded us of the jolly roger cruise rum punch in the caribbean!!
BTW a little secret from the workers on the booze cruise is to add a smidge of nutmeg to the punch.  Adds just a little something to the taste.

Another reviewer hit it on the head: This is a dead ringer for the rum punch from the "Jolly Roger" in, where was it?  Some island in the caribbean; that day remains a little hazy.  If you don't have dark rum handy, make this with light rum, serve it in a tall glass, and put a dash of grenadine in to color the bottom.  Your guests won't know what hit them.

WOW! I love it! I call it Pirate Punch!!  I used key lime juice and some awesome organic pure maple syrup instead of simple syrup, and I used some pineapple rum we happened to have.  I didn't have any bitters and I didn't add nutmeg.  It is so good!!!  This is my new favorite!

"Guaranteed hit at any party!" My only suggestion is to add the simple Syrup "to taste" to avoid over sweetening.

My mom and i went on a cruise several years ago, and after an insane jeep trip over a mountian in St. Lucia, we were given cups of this drink from our tour guide. It's not nearly as strong as the 'rocket fuel' we had there, but the flavor made me feel like we were back  on that mountain looking out at the banana plantations and the beach. i used half orange, half pineapple juice, just for our preferences.

Made as stated. Turned out a little sweeter than I like, but otherwise great. Next time I will try with more watered down orange juice or something, because I would not want to drink more than a glass or two of this with it being so sweet. Guests said it was good! Oh, for my simple syrup I used half white and half brown sugar; but I know that would not contribute to the overall sweetness of the recipe.

I didn't add the simple syrup because I don't like drinks to be too sweet.  Also, I couldn't find bitters at the liquor store, so I used Island punch pucker. It was so good!

For me this cocktail turned out just not bad. I think orange juice overwhelmed here a little. I used dark rum that I brought from the Dominican Republic (one of the best I think). And I didn't use angustura bitters. Not bad recipe to try, but it probably wouldn't be in my favorite cocktail recipe list.

Wow - this is fantastic.  The only change I made and it is a totally personal preference is cut the simple syrup by 1/2.  The bitters and the nutmeg take this from great to out of this world.  Just by chance the OJ that I had on hand was Mango OJ and what a delightful addition, mmmmm.  Thanks, this is a fantastic recipe that I have already made a few times and will become part of my repertoire.

A great punch. I thought it would serve 12 easily, but I had to make a second pitcher, everyone loved it! Wonderful balance of flavors.

I am looking for drink recipes to serve at my sister's 50th "beach theme" birthday party. I saw this and whipped one up as a trial drink to try it out. Very tasty! but I added a pineapple/banana juice mix to it instead of orange juice and used Malibu rum. I also tried coconut/banana juice and OMG! it was even better! lots of variations you can use on this drink!

Love this punch but I left out the bitters and added coconut rum (Malibu) and a bit of marischino cherry juice for color at the bottom of the glasses. Excellent!

This punch is so much better than the sum of its parts.  I had my hubby try it without telling him what was in it and he loved it!  He couldn't quite identify the ingredients and mentioned a "peach" flavor, which I didn't taste.  I also scaled the recipe for 2 drinks instead of 20 as this was a trial run.  YUMMY!   12/10/11 - reviewing this again as I just made a full batch.  Used only 1 cup homemade simple syrup and that was PLENTY!  added extra bitters and a full tsp of fresh grated nutmeg.  also added the juice of one lemon and another cup of pineapple juice.  Then it was a bit on the sour side so I added 1/2 cup of Orgeat syrup (almond sweet syrup), a pinch of ground clove and now it is sublime---not too sweet, not too tart, not too boozy (for this crowd).  Next time I would add some banana flavor or OJ with Mango or something.  Very good just not GREAT.

This punch was delicious and easy to make. I would suggest adding 1/2C simple syrup and adding more from there to taste. I ended up adding 1C syrup and it was still very very sweet. 

You really can't make this without the bitters and nutmeg. They're what makes this drink amazing. I served this at a party last night and everyone who tried it loved it.

As long as you follow the rhyme, this punch is yummy – but dangerous! What I had was RealLemon, Grenadine, Amber Bacardi Rum, and pineapple juice. Plus ice. Pretty sweet, but drinking it, you would never know the rum was there. So the alcohol really sneaks up on you. Loved it, but one per night is probably enough!

Simple and decent. Was in the mood for something a bit tangy so only used half the sugar. Worked well, got pretty smashed :). The nutmeg gave it an aroma which reminded me of bananas.

very sweet but made even better with a couple dashes of bitters. Quite a bit left in the punch bowl. I guess my crowd is more of a beer and wine group. Probably won't make again but it was worth trying.

I thought this was GREAT!  I made the simple syrup from a recipe on Allrecipes, and I cut the alcohol down to only 2 cups (we're lightweights) of booze.  Will make it again!

We made this punch for my husband's Caribbean themed birthday party and it was a SMASH HIT. We modified by using 2 different types of rum (Myers Original Coconut Rum + Jamaican Appleton Rum). We also used a frozen Dole juice concentrate of pineapple and banana and it added just the right amount of flavor. This is going to be a staple of our summertime cookouts. Fun and delicious. Make sure to garnish glasses with little umbrellas! Enjoy!

This rum punch is phenomenal.  I doubled the recipe for a party and it was all gone by the end of the evening.  If I make simple syrup again, I may cut the sugar.  I am not sure with all the fruit juice that the simple syrup needs as much sugar.  My guests were drinking it full strength, but I cut the strength by adding some lime seltzer water.  It was still fabulous.  I will make this again.

WOW!  Awesome punch.  The nutmeg is just perfect!  I used key lime juice, and that cut the sweetness perfectly.

I made this for our 4th of July BBQ and it went over well - even my sister, who doesn't really drink thought it was very tasty.  I used pineapple orange juice and spiced rum.

We had this punch down in St. Lucia (West Indies). Tastes VERY close to real thing. I only added 2 cups rum and it still snuck up on you. Big hit at the BBQ.

This reminds me of a favorite drink: a Rum Swizzle from the Swizzle Inn in Bermuda!  The only thing missing is some pineapple juice and Grenadine.  Still, this recipe is much more simple and still kicks you in the pants!  Very good - not too sweet and easy to make.  We used Bermuda's Goslings Dark Rum.  Great for parties!

This recipe was a hit at a recent shower!  As previous reviews suggested, I used Malibu Coconut Rum.  I also changed most of the ingredients because I needed to go with what I had.  I used Trader Joe's Orange Mango Breeze and Rose's sweetened lime juice and it was still a hit!  Many requested this recipe.  Enjoy.

I used what I had on hand which was orange/banana/strawberry juice, light rum, lime juice, & simple syrup. It was AMAZING. I can see these sneaking up on you. I gave some to my husband and he was shocked at how much alcohol was in one glass. I can see that with the guidelines of the rhyme at the top you can make anything you want, just so long as it sounds good. I can see this being amazing with malibu :).

Strong stuff ;-) I used sweetened lime juice instead of the fresh limes, because that's what I had available. I also added pineapple juice for more flavor and to cut dilute the alcohol some.

Delicious! Almost as good as what we had in the Turks and Caicos! I added a little bit of Grenadine, to give it the familiar color.

After reading the reviews I knew I had to make this. I'm happy to say it exceeded my expectations! What a fabulous drink and like the others have said it does sneak up on you. I can't wait to make it again...thanks for a great recipe! We loved it

Made it as-stated, and while I liked the combination of flavors, I found it was much too syrupy sweet for my taste.  If I made it again I would at least cut the syrup in half, or remove it entirely.

Check out the look on your guests faces when they take the first sip, their eyes actually pop!  Then another sip & WOW, this is crazy good! Everyone loved it!  We filled our glasses, to the top, with ice & then sprinkled on the nutmeg  & bitters & then filled them to the top with punch.  Most sensational drink!  Some people put a few cm of club soda in the glass first for the second drink, entirely changed it, there was more fruit taste & less bam,  they liked it, I liked it original.  I never changed a thing in the recipe, some said a bit sweet, I kinda agree.  I will cut back a bit on the sugar in the simple syrup next time, not too much tho, like maybe 1/2 C.  All in all...Delicious!  
      Oh,yeah, pretty potent too! Be careful how much you enjoy these!  ;D
      Thanks for sharing

My partner and I made this drink a few minutes ago.  Poured over ice, took a drink and looked at each other and said, "oh this could be really dangerous."  I can see these leading to a few stupid nights.  We are really looking forward to fresh orange season to make this with!

For all those who don't like their drinks too sweet, add all ingredients except simple syrup. Then add a little simple syrup at a time, till you get the sweet (or not to sweet) taste you like.

Very tasty.  It’s pretty potent, so we added another cup of orange juice.  This is definitely something we will be making again.

Pretty good, I used orange-mango juice instead of straight orange juice...and added a cup of water, not because it was to sweet, but to make it less thick.

I made it exactly to the recipe directions and it was so sweet, no one would finish their glass.  I added a 2 liter bottle of club soda, still too sweet.  As the ice melted it got a little bit better, but at the end of the party 3/4ths of it was still left.  Waste of money and time.

Made it for a Pirate Murder Mystery! I doubled the recipe but did cut back on the simple syrup based on other reviews. I used about 1 cup for each batch. Also didn't have quite enough limes to get the full amount for a double batch, it was still delicious. It was gone before the end of the night !

This was a big hit at a summer party.  I made a big decanter full  and floated frozen lemon and orange slices in it.  Be very careful though.......Just like the Killer Bee at Sunshines in Nevis it will sneak up and kick your behind!
