My husband and yound son loved this stuff, ok, I have to admit, I noticed it because my hubby is from Ohio, and I liked the name. I changed it up a little, used Ranch Style Beans instead of baked beans, and left out the raisins. It was very different and YUMMY!!

This was super tasty and very easy to make.  I would say it has about 8-10 servings and I had to use my lasagna pan to cook it in.  It reminded me of sheppards pie without the potatoes.
I didn't have enough zuccini so I peeled and diced an eggplant and added that.  Still tuned out good.

Ok so this is nothing fancy, but it's great for using up bits and pieces in the fridge, and it's also very customizable. I omitted the raisins as I didn't like the sound of them in this, and I pretty much just eyeballed the other ingredients using what I had. The only thing I added that wasn't in the recipe was a couple of beef bouillon cubes for a little more flavor. We had it with buttery mashed potatoes. Very good. Thanks!

This was lots of work and quite a mess. It turned out pretty runny, to the point we needed to use bowls. You need a VERY large casserole dish. I used a 9x13 and it was still spilling out when I tried to put it in the oven. My kids would not touch it. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that the flavor was good, but appearance and prep time killed it.

This was very edible.  Everyone liked it but no one raved.  I cooked it when we had lots of family around but won't cook it for the two of us.  The meat mix seemed a bit flat so I added a bit of thyme; that gave it some needed flavor.
