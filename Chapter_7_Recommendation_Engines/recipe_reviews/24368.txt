This recipe was delicious!  I didn't include the onions since my 5 year old doesn't like them, but she helped me make it from start to finish.  The combination of flavors is excellent!   The only small issue I had was that, because I used a regular tomato in addition to the fresh spinach, the pizza toppings were watery when I pulled it from the oven.  This was remedied with a few paper towels.  I think this would have been better had I used smaller, Roma tomatoes and if I had allowed the slices to sit for several minutes after being cut to let some of their juice drain.  My husband & daughter loved it, as did I, and we will have it again soon!

This pizza is to die for!  I made a couple of changes: sauteed the onion first, used bagged spinach since that is what I had on hand, added sliced green olives and used fresh mozzarella (approx. 8oz) rather than feta.  The "sauce" would be excellent as a dip for hot, crusty bread!!  Thank you for this new and easy variation on the traditional pizza!

My family has been enjoying homemade pizza every Saturday night for years.  When I added this one to the tradition, even the 14 year old sceptic liked it!  Now this pizza is a regular hit.
My friend uses the sauce (the first 7 ingredients)on baked perogies and to make garlic bread.  Delicious!  Highly recommended!

I used shredded mozzarella instead of feta and a couple packages of thawed, frozen chopped spinach for the topping.  Really good!

Easy, healthy and tasty.  What more could you want from a recipe.  My husband couldn't stop eating.  The jalapeno and garlic give it plenty of zip and the veggies really make it healthy.  It's truly the best of both worlds.  I cut the feta slightly and added 2 tablespoons of Parmesan on top because we love the flavor.

This was really really good.  I used fresh basil instead of dried and I think next time I'll grill the onions and add sliced black olives for more flavor but other than that it was awesome!

I enjoyed this one.   I'm not big on tomato sauce either so I added pesto sauce from Trader Joes as my base. They also have premade pizza dough in different flavors.  I used the garlic dough.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks.

I think this is the best pizza that I have ever eaten.  I made this using the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough recipe.  I was skeptical because I am a red sauce girl but this pizza was so flavorful, I did not miss the traditional red sauce at all.  The sauce is very flavorful but doesn't overpower the other toppings.  Its heavy on the garlic so be prepared for the resulting dragon breath.

I often use the sauce, but replace the pesto but pasta sauce. I don't like too much tomato sauce on my pizzas, and the amount in this recipe is just perfect! I have tried all the recipe once, substituting pepperoncini for the jalapeno, and it was delicious. Thank you!

I love meat but have been trying to cut back, so I looked for a vegetarian recipe that would leave me satisfied- this is it! I substituted the Feta for fresh mozzarella and added a little bit of grated cheddar to fill out the pizza. Next time I will add a bell pepper and possibly green onions to fill it out. The sauce makes it taste gourmet. We also made our own pizza dough which I completely recommend.

My new favorite recipe on this site.  I didn't have sun-dried pest so I used plain pesto and sprinkled  sun dried tomatoes with the other veggies and it was WONDERFUL!  Jalapenos were not too hot. It was full of flavors and healthy too.

This was easy and yummy, thank you! I did cut down on the olive oil and garlic a tad though since the pesto has so much of both. Besides that didn't change a thing.

I LOVED this recipe!!  I like pizza sauce, but this was a great change from the usual.  I read a few of the suggestions and added some italian seasoning to the crust.  I sauted the mushrooms, onions, and green peppers in olive oil with some garlic and oregano.  I didn't use the tomatoes since I didn't have any.  I added fresh chopped spinach then topped with cheese.  YUMMY!!!  Have made it again and will make it many times over!!

I made this pizza for my boyfriend (I am the vegetarian and he is not) and we both loved it! We added shredded parm to the feta but decided next time we make it, we'll probably use less feta and maybe add some shredded mozzarella. We also added spinach, basil leaves and broccoli and didn't use any jalapeno. The great thing about this recipe is its versatility. We will definitely be experimenting with it in the future!

Very good! I didn't have pesto, but I topped Jay's Pizza Dough (from this site, and rolled out thin) with the garlic-oil mix and topped with 1/2 minced jalapeno and a light sprinkling of cayenne. I then put down spinach, a little diced onion and bell pepper, one can of mushrooms, less feta and a tiny bit of mozzarella. Came out great! Next time I'll tear spinach a bit and add a bit more onion and bell pepper.  One note: I added 1 tsp of garlic salt to the garlic-oil mix, and baked at 435 for 10 minutes. At the end, I sprinkled the plated slices of pizza with a bit of pasta sauce. You can really make this with any toppings in any amounts that you like. If the garlic-oil mix is tasty and salty, it will really make the pizza. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was way too salty.  I think it was the feta cheese.  I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto so I used regular pesto and added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes to it.  I also used 1/2 bag baby spinach.  I will try this again but next time I think I'll use mozzarella cheese instead of the feta or a combination of the two.

This turned out really well.  I too do not care for red pizza sauce so I really loved the lightness of the sauce.  I did cut back a little on the garlic.  I used toppings of spinach, green onions, green pepper, mushrooms and tomatoes.  I let the tomatoes drain and sauteed the onion/peppers for a minute in the microwave.  I thought it was quite tasty.

This was verygood! I used regular basil pesto and chopped up some sun-dried tomatoes to add to it - I let them sit in the pesto for a while.  I omitted the jalapeno, added sliced mushrooms and some red bell pepper.  I know I would have loved feta on this, but I didn't have any so I used a little mozzarella and fresh grated parmesan instead.

Aimee, your 'white' pizza is ace.  I make my pizza without the sundried tomatoes (not my favourite) and use fresh basil leaves that I add toward the very end of baking pizza.  You are the pizza principessa, Aimee!

OMG! This is the first time I have given a recipe 5 stars. This pizza was delicious. So savory and full of flavour. As someone else said, my husband (who is a meat pizza lover), thought this was great.  Pick the toppings to your liking, the sauce is what makes this great!

We had a taste for a veggie pizza & tried this.  Wow.  Absolutely wonderful! This "sauce" would work well for any 'gourmet' creation.  We eliminated the jalapeno (I'm a sissy), and used mozzarella instead of feta (dh doesn't like feta).  Sliced our tomatoes and onions as thin as possible, and chopped spinach directly on top with kitchen shears.  Thanks Aimee! This one is good enough for company for sure.

My family and I love this pizza! This was my first time making this, and came out outstanding. This is great to impress your family & friends, especially those who enjoy Italian foods. I made extra pesto b/c personally I like my pizza coated with a little extra.

MODIFIED RECIPE:
This is great.  I didn't have any pesto, so I mixed EVOO a/garlic and spices and then spread on crust and topped w/spinach, tomatoes, onions, baby bellas, feta, and a handful of shredded Italian cheeses.  I will make again (tonight, actually) w/better chopped veggies (easier to cut/eat) and w/out the feta (I like feta and it tasted good, I just can't get past needing my pizza to have some mozz).

Very good!  I was really suprised!  I sauteed a Vidalia onion until soft and golden and proceeded with the recipe.  I used 3 sliced Roma tomatoes and left off the jalapeno.  Nice change of pace and loaded with veggies!

I liked this variation.  I dried my own tomatoes this fall and made my own pesto.  Both my toddler and husband enjoyed it.

This was absoutely delicious.  My daughter and I were home alone and we devoured the whole thing.  The problem is my daughter is just two years old, so I guess I'm admitting I ate a whole pizza myself.

I loved this! My husband acted like it was ok, but he ate 6 slices of it. I didn't have pesto so I skipped that. I also didn't have feta so I used mozzerella and I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen creamed spinach. I will totally make this again! What a great recipe!

Good, but I like a little more veggies!   Here's what I changed: used homemade pizza dough; got rid of the seeds in the tomatoes a bit so it wouldn't be too soggy; omitted the onion, jalapeno and feta.  (I would have definitely added feta, but I didn't have any.)  I also added some ham, zucchini, black olives & mozzarella.  Next time I would definitely consider adding mushrooms and/or artichoke hearts!  That would've added a kick and would be great combo.- in my opinion! This would probably be a 5 star pizza with the alterations!

Wow! This pizza was amazing. You can taste every last thing you put on the pizza. We used publixes dough in the bakery. I wouldn't recommend using one whole sweet onion unless you have made it before and like it that way. Also 3/4 of the jalapeno is plenty enough. Other than that it smells and tastes better than any pizza i have had in my life.

This was very good. I had to make the pizza dough homemade, and I got impatient....so I put it on pita bread and it was excellent! I even stuffed the pita bread with cream cheese mixed with feta cheese, chives, and garlic powder. It was very good both ways. I'd recommend this to others.

I had high hopes for this, but here are my adjustments if I make it again: omit jalapenos (they are not consistent with the flavor of the rest of the ingredients), reduce or omit completely the onion, reduce garlic by 1 T.  All in all, this was too spicy to enjoy the taste of the feta cheese, pesto, and tomatoes.  Some of that spice came from the jalapeno, but the onions and garlic dominated the taste.  My husband and I could only eat 2 pieces at a time.  My advice - great recipe, but go lighter on the hard stuff.

This is amazing!  I added grilled chicken to it and used green onion instead of sweet onions.  I also used only 2 Tbsp of garlic.  This quickly became my favorite homemade pizza recipe.

WOW!  Both my husband and I LOVED this recipe.  Used a regular pesto (what we had on hand), used more of it instead of the olive oil and seeded the jalepeno.  Couldn't get over how good it was.  Next time would cut out the butter to lighten it up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I found some red pepper feta and tried that. No jalapeno either but I couldn't be happier with the recipe.  It was almost like my favorite bruschetta but even better!

I, too, found it heavy-handed on the garlic, which I LOVE, by the way and kind of on the bland side, but I'm not sure why.  I also added fresh tomato slices and mushrooms.  Because the mushrooms were raw, I sprinkled a little more olive oil on the top to aid in their cooking.  I did not jalapeno pepper since I could not find fresh in the grocery store; however, it wasn't missed. I don't know - something about this recipe didn't click, so I will keep looking for a better Greek/vegetarian pizza with no red sauce.

This very well may have been the best pizza i have ever had. Made exactly as written using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site and it was fantastic. Oh, i used roma tomatoes with seeds removed to avoid liquid buildup. I would recommend using a pizza stone if possible. The pizza cooks so much better. Thank you for this delicious pizza.

That was delicious....it is a new family favorite....I have never had a "white" pizza before, and this made me a fan!!!  I did not use feta cheese (didn't have any, but I LOVE feta, so I will try it next time)...I used Kraft 5 cheese Italian and grated Parmesan cheese.  It tasted fantastic!!

It was a good pizza. I was a little skeptical at first, but I made some changes and it turned out very good! I used:

-an italian cheese blend (mozzarella, provolone, parmesean) instead of feta -italian spice blend (basil, oregano, marjoram, etc.) instead of 1 tsp of the called for spcies
-grated italian cheese blend in the sauce mixture instead of just the grated parmesean
-added red pepper flakes
-left out the spinach and onions, used jalepenos, tomatoes, olives instead

Next time, I will put in a little less Italian seasoning (I'm not a huge fan of seasoning) and add some salt (since I didn't use the feta cheese).

I used what I had on hand...so some variations, (which makes it nice) I used a basil pesto, no spinach, diced/canned tomato (green pepper/onion flavors) sliced onion and mozz cheese. STILL was AWESOME - did use the butter, the oil, added fresh garlic and some dried oregano...baked - and inhaled it!  :o)  A keeper for sure!  Can't wait to try other variations.

I made this pizza last night, it was fantastic! I added an extra spoonful of the pesto sauce because it wasn't enough for my base. Will definitely be making it again...

Very good - a nice change from the ordinary.  My husband wasn't too thrilled when I told him the ingredients, but he ended up loving it!  I want to try it next time with hunks of fresh mozzarella.

Great alternative to other pizza base sauces.  I am allergic to tomato and needed to find something different to cover my pizza bases - and this is it.  Obviously i left out the sundried tomatoes it still worked fantastically! Then i topped with my favourite toppings.

I need to remember to put all the spinach on even though it sounds like a lot because the spinach cooks down. We like more spinach and less tomato. Easy on the jalepeno.

This pizza was very good. I did not add the sun dried tomato pesto, but put fresh mushrooms, and used mozzarella instead of feta. Will make again soon.

I've been eyeing this recipe for quite awhile now, but haven't tried it yet.  All in all, it's a good recipe.  The pesto sauce is (as many others have said) delicious, and the feta gives it a nice salty bite.  However, sundried tomato pesto is quite flavorful on its own, so I can't see how the addition of a truckload of garlic and some extra spices which were already in the pesto to begin with make it something extraordinary.  The spinach and chicken (somehow I thought it called for chicken.  Apparently not.) were a bit bland.  I think more sauce would have overrided this problem though - I made a homemade crust and my pan is quite large, so maybe 1.5x the sauce would have been better for me.  I liked it, hubby liked it, even the kids liked it.  I'm just not sure we all liked it QUITE enough for it to be a regular.  I have a different spinach pizza recipe which is more popular with my crowd, so I suspect the hubs is going to say no-go on this one again.

So good! I used tastefully simple brand Dried Tomato and Garlic Pesto Mix for the base so that took the place of the butter, minced garlic, basil and oregano. And who knew feta would be so delicious on pizza?! Will become a regular pizza option for us.

AMAZING! I added lots to it...
6 oz chicken
with the feta I used 12 ounces...6 of garlic feta and 6 of tomato basil feta
mushrooms
black olives
artichoke hearts
I sprinkled the top with parmesan also. 
I left out the jalapeno, personal choice.
For the onion I used scallion (green onion) -3 of them.
Baked on a store brand crust at 400 for 12 minutes...this pizza is amazing! Can't wait for everyone to try it!

Amazing pizza! My husband and I vowed to make it a Friday night tradition. It was also fun to make. I prepared all the ingredients and we both made our side of the pizza exactly like we wanted it. He wanted tomato slices and more carmelized onions while I wanted roasted peppers and fresh basil. We used a thin crust pillsbury dough that turned out perfectly.

This pizza was excellent! Great flavor and you didn't feel sick from the usual pizza greasiness. My boyfriend loved it too! I used Bobli original pizza crust and I added less than half of 1 chopped green bell pepper and some sliced mushrooms. I used yellow onion instead of sweet onion. Like other reviewers I also took out the tomato seeds so it wouldn't make the pizza soggy. I substituted the jalepeno for crushed red pepper.

I added sun-dried tomatoes and shredded mozzarella cheese and topped it off with feta cheese. SOOO delicious. Might be the best homemade pizza recipe I've ever had!

Awesome.  I doubled the sauce because I looove  sun-dried tomato pesto and wanted a generous amount on each slice.  Also, I sauteed the onions first in olive oil so they carmelized a bit, and added roast chicken from the grocery store, and used mozzerella instead of feta.  Left out the jalapeno because i do not have good heat tolerance.  This was so amazingly good, I will definitely make it again, great for parties, guests.

This is an absolutely delicious pizza recipe for people who can't deal with red sauces.  You can customize it with whatever delicious veggies you have on hand, although the spinach is a necessity.  It works best with a nice, homemade pizza crust.  Yum.

I love my red sauce but love new things. Loved this recipe. BUT, I didn't have a jalepeno pepper, so I just sprinkled pepper jack cheese on top. Very nice.

This was delicious! I really liked the sauce, I have made it three times already!  I sauted the onions a little before putting them on the pizza, I don't really like raw onions.  And I also sliced the tomato before doing anything and layed them out on a paper towel to draw out some of the juices so it doesn't make the pizza watery.  Then let them sit there while you prepare the rest of the pizza.  The jalapeno pepper added just the right amount of spice!  You can use any veggies, it's a great way to clean out the veggies in the fridge you would otherwise never use!

I gave this a 4 out of 5 because of a few things; one whole onion is too much for this pizza and I think 6 ounces of fetta cheese is a little too much because of the saltiness of the cheese.  I would also cut back on the butter it's a little greasy but the flavour is really nice.  I will try this again with a few modifications.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really really good.  Word to the wise ... if you are making your own crust make sure you make it thick enough to withstand all the toppings...or cook the dough first - I made the mistake of adding the toppings to my fresh dough and it just wasnt sturdy enough so we had to use a fork.  The toppings work great together.  I will make this again for sure!

Wow! I'm never purchasing gourmet pizza again. This is THE best homemade pizza I've ever had!! The only thing we did different was less cheese (watching our calories). I can't wait to make it for company. Thanks SO MUCH for sharing! :)

This sauce is outstanding.  It is the only sauce I will put on my homemade pizza.

Really excellent pizza. Cheap tomato based sauce often leaves me with terrible heartburn, but i found this to be a gastronomical treat. The kid loved it too. be warned, this recipe leaves little room for cheap or bad tasting ingredients, so choose wisely, shoppers.

This was a really good pizza!  A nice change from the "regular" stuff!  My daughter and I ate this up...quick!  The boys would rather stick to the ol red sauce/meat pizza.  The heck with them....more for us!!!  I used feta and mozzarella on our pizza and left out the jalepeno and onion.  Yummy!

i trade the amounts of butter and olive oil and added marinated artichoke hearts to the rest of the pizza toppings.  i have been making this style of pizza for years, stuffing pita with a bit of cheese and using that is an excellent idea.  i use my homemade (nutless basil pesto and sometimes leave the tomato out of it.  you can vary this a lot.

This was great! I used a Boboli wheat crust, and I added mushrooms and green/red peppers. It was delicious, I'll definitely make it again.

My DH made this for supper the other night and it was fantastic!!  We used our homemade pizza crust and followed the recipe exactly with one minor exception; we didn't use jalapeño because we don't really care for it.  The only point of interest to mention is that if you're considering making this pizza, make sure your choice of feta is a good one.  The flavour of this cheese is kind of strong and there is a lot of it on the pizza, so a sub-standard choice will really affect how good (or not good) this pizza is.

This is a great recipe, but we did find a bit too salty. We used broccoli instead of spinach, and left out the pepper. It might be due to the store bought pesto used.  We continue to make it as the sauce is really great!

We absolutely love this pizza.  I don't use the jalapeno's becuase we don't like hots.  I also use regular tomato sauce because it is hard to find the sun dried tomato pesto but it is still so good.  I make this at least twice a month.

I used this recipe as "inspiration" and it was delicious!  I couldn't find sun-dried pesto so I used basil pesto. I sauted onions, spinach, mushrooms and garlic in olive oil until done then added diced cooked chicken and a tablespoon of pesto and removed from heat.  I spread the rest of the container of pesto on two pizza shells.  I then topped each pizza shell with the onion,spinach,mushroom chicken mixture then topped with feta, tomato slices and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and baked for about 10-15 minutes.

After the pizzas cooled I cut into squares and served as appetizers.  Huge success.... everybody loved it and I received several requests for the recipe.

We LOVED this pizza, followed the recipe exactly, with one exception, we used the jarred mild pepper rings instead of the jalapeno peppers. These added a nice tang, without being over powering.

Different. I think next time I'll use less garlic (3-5 gloves). This is a nice change & really like the mixture that replaces the usual sauce. Can add different things (pepper flakes, mushrooms, red/yellow peppers) to this basic recipe.

Wow this was good.  I'm not a big fan of pesto so I just chopped up sun dried tomatoes in place of the pesto.  Also added red bell peppers and used blue cheese, since that is what I had on hand.  Excellent!!!!

DH is a fan of homemade pizza, but I don't like the red sauce. THIS is aptly named! We both enjoyed it. I found tomato pesto sauce at Wegmans (their Italian Classics brand-close enough), used a Mediterranean feta cheese, and left out the jalapeño (they don't like me).  I also used Pillsbury's thin pizza dough in the can because it's what I had on hand. I followed those directions; pre bake for 5 minutes at 400 degrees,  then load it up and cook for another 8-10. It was good and as I said, we enjoyed it, but am definitely going to try with proper pizza dough next time. This will go into the dinner rotation. It's quick, easy, and yummy.

I think this is a delicious pizza. I didn't have sundried pesto ,but I did have a jar of sundried tomatoes. I drained them, and put in the food processor , along with some fresh grated parmesan cheese and olive oil. Viola! Sundried pesto! Then, I proceeded with the recipe,as directed. I made my own pizza crust . It was a combo of all-purpose and whole wheat. It was all so good. I highly recommend this recipe. I usually make the exquisite pizza sauce from this site and it is very good with a typical pepperoni,olive, pepper,and onion pizza. But ,oh for a change of pace,this pizza fits the bill! My whole family just loved it. Thanks so much ! In fact, I think they liked it better !

I love this pizza! It is really beautiful and full of flavor. The sauce always looks like you're not going to have enough to cover the crust well, but a little goes a long way thanks to the strong flavor. Sometimes, I'll add oven-roasted tomatoes that I make and they are a tasty addition. My little girl (2 years old) devours this pizza.

If you question, or you think your family will question this recipe, don't worry about it. It is VERY good. I've made it twice now and everyone loves it! My husband can be bratty about eating vegetarian food, and the typical American pizza is his favorite, but no complaints on this one. My 14 year old requested that I make it again right away. My 3 year old ate it right up! Easy and very tasty. Thanks Aimee!

Made exactly as described. Way too much garlic - it overpowers the dish completely. Would make again,  but will decrease the amount of garlic used.

Oh WOW! This was an awesome pizza! It was easy.....fast.....and very rewarding. My kids who would love to have delivery pizza any night.....has asked me over and over again to make this pizza instead of ordering. I'm happy to do so...its so much healthier!

This recipe is great!  The sauce for this "No Sauce" recipe was tasty.  I didn't have any spinach or tomatoes on hand, so I used mushrooms, marinated artichoke hearts, and red onions.  It was perfect!

Wow amazing!  I used an already made pizza crust from Whole Foods.  Made the recipe exactly as described.  I think next time I will cut down on the butter or oil just a bit, since it seemed to be too much.  Really good!

We loved this pizza!  The only changes I made were to cut the garlic to 2 tablespoons and I used regular pesto.  I realized half-way through my second piece that I had forgotten the cheese, and it was still awesome!  Great recipe!

I decided against the onion and the jalepeno but it still turned out great!  My two-year-old helped me mix the sauce, roll out the dough and add the toppings!  Great fun!  We also added some fresh basil along with the spinach.  Yum!

Amazing Pizza!!!! I made my own crust, I used the Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Dough recipe from here and it turned out great! I added slices of chicken breasts which I first sauted with garlic and then simmered in Franks Red Hot sauce as well. My daughter and I loved it, we will be making it for dad next time =)

Yup...i've made all 3 top rated pizzas on this site and this by far was my picky husband's number 1!  He went on and on about how amazing it tasted.  I couldn't disagree.  The only thing I changed was doubling the sauce and making it on a whole wheat crust.  Freaking YUM!

Awesome place to start for non-sauce pizza! I used basil pesto blended with a small package of sun-dried tomatoes and more olive oil. I sauteed onions and red/orange bell pepper in olive oil before putting on top of pizza. Omitted jalapeno, tomato, butter, and dried basil since I had basil pesto. Made it with Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust rolled very thin, and my whole family was raving!

I adore this recipe!  I cut down the garlic and it's such a good base recipe to play with the ingredients.  It's great as is, or I'll sub mushrooms and red peppers, whatever is on hand.

Delicious!  I use a gluten free crust mix and add canned chicken when I'm not eating it with my vegetarian friend.  So yummy!  Next time I think I may add shrimp.

Normally, I do not like pizza, at all. This has quickly become my favorite.  I make one pizza for the family the traditional way, and a small one like this for me. Oh my its SOOO good. Be sure to put spinach under the tomatoes and feta or it will dry out. I use a garlic pizza crust from this site. YUMM.

I used canned pizza dough on a pizza stone and had to cook the pizza for a little longer than the dough instructions because of the wealth of toppings. I did slice the tomatoes the day before so they could drain. It wasn't too wet but because I had such a thin crust we did need a fork. The flavors were amazing.

This was great. Prepared as written (except I omitted the jalapeno) and it was perfect. My husband, who saw the recipe on the counter and said "oh, I didn't realize it was a vegetarian pizza..." (wishing for some kind of meat) even loved it. This one we will make again. Thanks!

I am a Family and Consumer Science teacher (aka Home Ec.) and I had two of my classes try this.  They were very hesitant and skeptical.  We followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little mozzarella in addtion to the feta as suggested by some other people.  The LOVED it.  It was such a hit!  Will definitely make this one again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! I love the inclusion of jalapenos and I used jarred ones instead of fresh. Next time I will use less...the ones I bought were really SPICY!!!! I also slightly sauteed the onions in butter first because I don't particularly love the taste of raw yellow onion. AND FINALLY...Next time I will use less olive oil and/or butter....the pizza was a tad greasy. BUT OVERALL IT WAS SUPER YUMMY! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this tonight and hubby and I agreed that it is very good as we enjoy Mediterranean flavors.  I did not have sun-dried tomato pesto, so I subbed sun-dried tomato bruschetta instead and it was fine.  I didn't measure the onions, spinach, tomatoes, jalapano, or cheese - just spread everything around until it looked right.  ;)

I have made this several times and my family loves it.  The sauce is what makes it so good.  I omit the jaleaenos to make it kid friendly. I have also made it without the onions when I do not  have any on hand and it is still delicious.

This pizza is AMAZING.  I'm your typical pepperoni pizza kind of girl, but this opened up my world to a whole new kind of pizza!  I've made it at least 5 times in the last month.  It's super easy and delish!

I really liked this recipe.  My family had it for dinner this evening and they loved it!  I doubled the recipe to make 2 pizzas. The only thing I did diffrent was saute the onions and peppers in olive oil.  Next time I think I will double the sauce, because there wasn't quite enough for me.

This is a great base for anything you want to put on a pizza. I stuck some sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and olive oil in the cuisinart, pulsed to a paste. I added in the herbs the recipe called for and smeared that all over a boboli shell. Added feta, mozzarella, and asiago cheese (we love cheese), mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, more fresh basil, and olives. It was insanely good.

Yum!  I put this on Valentino's Pizza Crust from this site and it was a fast, easy dinner.  I used fresh basil and oregano because I had it, and it was terrific.  I added some dried rosemary and thyme as well (personal taste) and next time I'll add crushed red pepper.  It was great!

I didn't have any of the sun-dried tomatoe pesto but didn't need it. I mixed up the garlic sauce and spread it on crust. Used crumbled italian sausage, sauteed fresh mushrooms and garlic, and lots of italian blend cheese on top. Delicious!

I used chopped sun-dried tomatoes instead of the pesto (to use them up), then added a bit more of the butter / olive oil / garlic mixture to get the spread consistency.  I also added more Parmesan cheese (cause we like it).  Also made it on a whole wheat crust.  The grains from the crust mixed with the toppings were great!

Can I give this recipe a 10 star rating!?  I adjusted this a bit based on what I didn't have in-- so I made this without the pesto, onion (used dry minced onion instead), and jalapeno but it was still TO DIE FOR and I'm sure those additional ingredients would have made it even better.  I used about a third of the feta so it needed some mozzerlla... but all feta would have been superb!  My hat is off to the chef who successfully discovered a pizza without a red (or white!) sauce.  Will definitely be making again!

What an excellent recipe. We used this as on of several topping options for a party where we created several different homemade pizzas. 
Although we were testing new territory with all of them, this one came out tasting by far the best. We will definitely make this again! Thank you.

TO-DIE-FOR pizza!  This recipe is great and really doesn't need anything else.  I only added mushrooms because I feel a pizza is not complete without them!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this sauce with a homemade pesto rosso, put it on a Boboli crust, loaded it with veggies, and had a huge hit.  My friend went back for thirds!  This gives plenty of tomato flavor for the purists, but it allows all of the other interesting flavors to shine through.

This was really good! We didn't add the tomato pesto. We put alfalfa sprouts on, and they were a pretty addition. We also put sesame seeds on the crust part. We've already made this twice! We'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was great! The sauce that replaced traditional tomato sauce was excellent! I added smoked chicken and sliced mushrooms to the original stuff. I also brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese before baking. Everyone loved it!

Couldn't have asked for a more well rounded and delicious crowd pleaser. We used a whole wheat Bolboli thin crust and baby spinach. It baked down well and maintained that fresh veggy flavor..

We absolutely love this pizza!  We do use store bought basil pesto for the sauce and chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil instead of fresh tomatoes. I also spray the pizza with a little cooking spray to moisten the spinach and onions.  I find it all cooks better that way.

YUMMMMMMY - seriously good sauce - even hubbs loved it & he's not much for change. I loaded one side with mushrooms, fresh tomatos, olives & mozzeralla cheese, the other side with spinach, tomatos, olives & fetta. Deeeelish! Easy to use crust from Betty Crocker - just add water type deal. Easy, quick & actually filling!

I'm only giving this four stars because I was the only one in my family that really liked it.  My husband doesn't like feta.  My daughter does, but she seemed pretty indifferent.  My toddler loved the crust.  I will definitely make this again for a party or when I crave it for myself.  I brought the rest to work for lunch today...I'm hoping the other reviews are right and it's an awesome second-day dish.  I would give this a 5 star rating for convenience.  It took no time to throw together.  Very low maintenance, high flavor dish!

Addicting! I made a large pizza (16 or 18") and we ate it all!  Used homemade wheat crust, sesame seeds on edge of crust, half the garlic and only had 4 oz of feta so added some goat cheese.  YUM!! My skeptical husband loved it too. Will definitely make again.  Oh, make sure to use plenty of spinach as it really shrinks up in the oven.

This was amazing.  The sundried tomato pesto really makes it special. I have used both spinach and broccoli rabe, and both were excellent.  You can probably substitute any leafy green for the spinach.

This was a very simple recipe but oh so incredible tasty!  Everyone loved it except the 4 year old who picked everything off and just ate the crust. I didn't change a thing about this recipe and have added it to my recipe book and plan to make it again.

Flavor was good.  Didn't use jalopenos and had trouble with the store bought pizza dough, so instead I used fresh Italian bread that I sliced and topped with the ingrediants and then broiled for a few minutes until the cheese melted.

I used low-fat basil pesto (the entire package) and sauteed that with the spinach. I used that as my sauce on whole-grain pizza crust. I then topped with fresh roma tomatoes, kalamata olives, onion and TWO fresh, sliced jalapenos (my lips are still burning). Then I topped with low-fat feta cheese and baked it for about 18-20 minutes at 400 degrees...the cheese started to turn brown.

Fantastic and easy, I made with naan bread that I bought on sale. I made 2 pizzas, one I added smoke salmon on top.  Both were delicious, will make again.  I had leftover pesto, greek olives, Mediterranean seasoned feta and half a jar of marinated artichokes.  used it all up on these pizzas.

This pizza was phenomenal. Was a little apprehensive on the amount of garlic, but did not overwhelm the taste.  Used Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from  this site for the crust. No leftovers with this pie.

It turns out that this type of sauce isn't my cup of tea.  Using half the sauce made it bearable though still very oily, but for me it was basically a waste of a lot of other good ingredients.  The amount of garlic, which I was skeptical about, was my favorite part about the sauce.  I think I'll stick with red or white sauce pizzas.

Very good! Great way to use up those zucchinis, spinach and other veggies you have in the fridge that are almost ready to be thrown away.

We love this pizza. I made this recipe many times with different toppings, cheeses and crusts, but kept the sauce the same. And it's always very delicious. The SAUCE is what makes this recipe stand out.

Awesome recipe! The only change I highly recommend is greatly reducing the amount of garlic that is called for.

Delicious!  I added small pieces of fresh mozzarella and black olives since they are family favorites. I had canned jalapeños on hand which turned out just fine. This pizza tasted better than a lot of specialty pizzas I've ordered from restaurants. Roma tomatoes were prefect and didn't make the pizza watery as mentioned in other reviews with large tomatoes.

Not my favorite.  Mine was mostly the flavor of the pesto, which wasn't a great pesto.  It also was pretty wet and made a bit of a mess in the oven.

This pizza is so good!!!!  My family loved it!!!! I wasn't able to find sun-dried tomato pesto, so I used julianne sliced.  I added fresh basil and italian spices.  I added pepperoni, mushrooms and more feta cheese.  Thought of sautéing the onions and mushrooms, but didn't need to, it came out perfect!!! Thanks for the recipe Aimee

This was great. I used a bit more sun dried tomato pesto for added flavor. I also add a layer of mozzarella between the pesto mix and the vegetables, because I didn't have much feta to put on top.

I really enjoyed this!  Roughly chopped just some plain sun dried tomatoes, so no pesto.  Also used a chopped pablano in place of the jalapeno.  Delicious!!

I used black olives instead of tomatoes since I didn't have any. Used my own homemade pizza crust. I used a bit more of the pesto and didn't add in extra garlic since my pesto was pretty garlicky. Was super easy and tasty.

Oh my gosh! I loved this! I am not a big fan of the same old pizza. This was perfect! The jalapenos added just the perfect mix with the sweet onions, tomatoes, spinach and feta. I also added fresh mushrooms. So yummy! I actually was excited to eat leftovers. Oh and we used Naan bread for the crust.

This was pretty good.  A little heavy on the garlic for us though.  Next time I will use a little more pesto and a little less of the garlic butter mixture.  The Feta was fantastic on this.  We used the "Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto" recipe from this site and loved it.  Thanks for the recipe

I made this for my boyfriend and I, but I switched the jalapeno pepper for a bell pepper and made a little extra sauce.  We both loved it.  It was fantastic and filling, but tasted really fresh.

I made homemade pizza dough for the Super Bowl last Sunday and wanted to try a new recipe.  I made a traditional one with mozarella and I made this one.  Very good...even to my hubby who normally likes to play it safe.  I didn't know what pesto was...found a jar of dried tomato and spices and ground it up.  That was very intense flavor, to use sparingly. I also used a can of mixed flavored greens instead of spinach.  VERY YUMMY!

i'm giving this 4 stars because i believe had i done it right it would've been excellent. i left out the pesto then followed directions. i would use more parm next time and use tomato basil feta as well. i may even put some mozzerella on there too. it just wasn't salty enough for me. i also don't recommend using fresh jalepenos as they are not as hot. they are good if you are looking for that super fresh taste.

This was an interesting twist to the regular pizza we are used to. We liked it. I added some colored peppers and used shredded mozzarella cheese to the top. The crust is Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.

This was fabulous.   I sauted the onions and pepper.   I was a little leary about the jalepeno pepper, but it gave it a great kick.  Best pizza I've had!

I only used half of everything to make half of my 16 in pizza. THIS WAS VERY DELICIOUS!!! Next time I would like to omit the jalapeno to suit my 4 year old and 11 month old. Also, I would like to try red and yellow onions and add some type of meat (probably bacon) for next time.

This was excellent.I made some modifications though,since I couldn't find sun dried tomato pesto , I used regular pesto (1 tablespoon), sun dried tomatoes kept in oil ,I minced them and used two tablespoons of them.I added kalamata olives (minced),and cut the amount of garlic to 3 teaspoons.I used the whole wheat and honey pizza crust as one of thr reviewers suggested and the results were fabulous.Thanks aimee for posting the recipe.

I make this all the time sometimes I use a canned crust & sometimes boxed.  I switch it up a lot depending on what we have on hand.  One suggestion would be not too use too much extra feta, it can taste a little salty.

Completely drool-worthy... sooo good! I'd recommend not including the watery tomato seed part of the tomato. Also I use less garlic, but that's just my preference. Awesome every time!!

I cooked this last night for dinner and my husband loved it! Instead of the sun dried tomato pesto I used a traditional basil pesto and omitted the dried basil and it was great!  We'll definitely use this recipe again!

This was very good homemade vegetarian pizza. There are quite a few strong ingredients in this pizza and to be honest, I think some of the flavors got a bit lost.  I used jarred sun dried tomatoes that I drained well before chopping.  Also used the last of my fresh basil and oregano from the garden - - I liked the flavor of the fresh vs. the dried herbs.

OMG!  So very good.  I put artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, salami and mushrooms as toppings.  But the thing that made it was the sauce.

AMAZING. Followed the recipe exactly. I don't even like onions but it worked great with the sweet onion. It was a smash hit.

After making this, I don't even like sauce on my pizza anymore.  I like to sprinkle Parmesan on the edge crust before I bake it, too.  It makes the crust super crispy and flavorful.

Absolutely delicious...its got that mediterranian kick to it, with the pesto and the feta. I too could not finded sun dried tomato pesto, so I made homemade basil pesto (from this site) and it was delicious

This pizza turned out really well! I omitted the peppers, though. Just not a big fan. It was still delicious. My husband, stepmom and I devoured it! Even my 2 year old sister got in on the action.

Very yummy and super easy to prepare. My husband raved and said it was better than any pizza he's had at a restaurant. He liked it even better the next day. I will definitely make it again.

Excellent, but I didn't use the jalapeno peppers.  Would definitely make again.
