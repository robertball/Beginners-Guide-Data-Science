These were a LOT of work, but very worth the effort! I got rave reviews from my dinner guests, and it was very convenient that they can be assembled early in the day and then the cooking is very simple right before you eat. One tip--do not overboil the green onion tops, this makes it very hard to tie them into knots. And I found 7 inch pieces were not quite long enough.

I served these for Easter and they were a huge hit!  After reading the other reviews, I thought these would be more difficult to put together, but honestly they were not that bad.  The fact that you can tie them together earlier in the day is great.  I used the longest green onions I could find, which made it much easier to tie together. They are so pretty, I highly recommend these for a special dinner!

Everyone loved these at Easter.  Some fell apart, so next time I will tie them up, then insert a slender vegetable (carrot or string bean) to make the bundle snug.

EASTER HIT!  This one gets 5 stars on technique alone!  The boiled & cooled green onion tops were the perfect ties.  Steaming in a skillet was very easy & kept my oven free for the rest of the meal.  The presentation is beautiful, looks as pretty as the picture very easily.  I made 14 bundles and it was fun, not tedious.  I made them ahead of time & they cooked quickly. 

I used 7 frozen green beans and 4 strips of fresh carrots for each bundle.  I cooked the bundles in a bit of some bacon grease then added water to steam.  At the end I added butter, 2 T brown sugar & a spash of soy sauce then spooned over the bundles.  Also sprinkled crisp crumbled bacon on top.

DELICIOUS!

I loved these little vegetable bundles.  I made them for easter last year.  They were so pretty and full of great flavor.  I used chicken stock instead of white wine.  I also added some spices and flavors such as parsley and lemon pepper.

I have to admit I was a little intimidated to make these, but it worked perfectly and my family enjoyed them for Easter.  It's much easier to assemble than you think, and I have to admit that this is one of the only times I've enjoyed asparagus!!  They are so cute.

This was a beautiful presentation of vegetables.  The green onions were a bit hard to work with.  Make sure you get the longest stems you can find.

Being that my husband and I are not drinkers, even though the wine was cooked down, it gave the veggies especially the Asparagus a more bitter flavor. This was not enjoyed in our home.

Amazing and beautiful on the plate. They are a lot of work and a little difficult to assemble but tasted great. My dinner guest was very impressed. Will make again.

No question they were good, but too much work.  Myabe it was because I made so many for a crowd at Easter dinner, next time I think I would save it for a smaller scale.

These were very frustrating to assemble, although it was nice that this could be done earlier in the day.  The longer the onion piece you can use, the better.  Although they looked beautiful on the plate - they did not taste very good at all.  Maybe I did something wrong...but, I didn't find them worth the effort and won't try making them again.

Great concept.....but VERY time comsuming! I had a difficult time keeping the "ties" from breaking during assembly or they weren't long enough. I ended up only making a few and tossing all the rest of the veggies together in the onion/broth mixture. They tasted good, and looked cool, just not sure it's worth the effort.
