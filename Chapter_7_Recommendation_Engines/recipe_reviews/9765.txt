I think the measurements must be wrong on this recipe.  The dough came out very runny.  When I tried to bake it, the cookies ran together on the parchment paper.  They turned out to be very sticky,chewy, and not tasting like lemon.  I ended up adding a lot more flour to the rest of the batter which helped a little.  I think if I had switched the amounts of flour and brown sugar listed in the recipe and added more lemon juice & zest, it would probably have turned out better.

Someone made Lemon Macadamia Nut Cookies for me once a long time ago, which is why I tried this recipe.  I didn't read the reviews first, and just made it as written.  First batch became one huge uncooked cookie. Then I read the reviews and tried adding more flour, and already put more lemon than asked for.  The flour made it not turn into one huge cookie...but the flavor was very unpleasant.  Nothing like what it should have tasted like.  :(

Definitely needs more lemon.  Wasn't too impressed with this recipe.
