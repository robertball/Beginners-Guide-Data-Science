The dish was good but I think it needed more cream cheese. I used Ragu traditional spagetti sauce. I had a block of of cream cheese and added  3 ounces but next time I think I'll add 4 ounces (about 1/2 Cup) because the bite of the tomato sauce was really strong. I also mixed the basil into the sauce about 3 minutes before the sauce was done.

I didn't care for this.  It reminded me of tomato soup.

It tasted like tomato soup with pasta, but it was ok.

As is not the greatest dish. I needed something quick and easy and I found this recipe. I changed it a ton after tasting the sauce. I added extra cream cheese, some cream to thin out the mix a bit, garlic, onion, and some Italian Cheeses. I had bits of parm, provolone, mozzarella and a bit of asiago cheeses in the fridge so I used a bit of everything. After all that this was pretty good.

I agree the sauce is a bit thin and I used a 10 ounce container of the new cooking cream cheese.  I also added shredded parmesan, sauteed onion and garlic, oregeno and baby peperoni.  I liked it though and think this is a great basic recipe that can be built upon.

It was good....except first I cooked some onions and minced garlic. I also added heavy cream and then it was perfect!
