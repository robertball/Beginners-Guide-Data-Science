I love these. This recipe is also very detailed, so it's easy to follow. One problem was the cooking time. I found it took only 13-15 or so minutes. Not the 22-25 minutes in the recipe.

Pay attention to the sizing of the croissants. If they are too small they will be crisp with very few folds inside. Try to keep the final triangles larger than 5 inches at the base.  The folding process is actually much simpler than it sounds. It does not take as many chill-thaw cycles.

Everything in this recipe seems to be spot on...except the bake time.  425 degrees at 22 minutes (minimum time given) is way too long.  I over baked half of my recipe (and work) by following this time.  The second pan I am giving 16 minutes and then watching.  This is not an oven to oven temperature difference...it's a frustrating bake time error in the recipe.

The recipe was easy to follow. The croissants turned out light and fluffy, but they greatly lacked flavor. I might try this again, but with salted butter.

I followed the very detailed recipe to a "T".  This author was right on.  They turned out perfect, and I am so glad.  I ALWAYS wanted to make Croissant and now I can say I FINALLY did it!  Thanks so much.

Thanks so much for a great, detailed recipe! It was my first attempt at any real pastry and it was a huge success! This isn't difficult at all if you have patience. I spread a little bit of almond paste on some of them before rolling and sprinkled sliced almonds on top after brushing on the egg wash to make my favorite french treat, croissant aux amandes!

This is very much worth the time and effort.  It was a lot of work but the end result was delicious, buttery crossaints!  I will make it again, for sure!

Have the look and texture of a great croissant. I may have missed something, but it needs a little more flavor. I am a novice at baking breads, so it may be me and not the recipe.

I changed them to use half cake flour and next time I will use 1/3-1/2 salted butter instead of all unsalted. Rise at cooler room temp (sub 80 F) or your butter will melt and soak into your pastry, making it tough.

This is an excellent recipe. However, 1/2 teaspoon of salt is simply not enough. Next time I make it I will simply use salted butter. Also, I baked for 10 minutes at 400 then turned the trays around and baked for an additional 12 minutes at 350.

Amazing recipe.  Thank you for taking the time to write out the instructions.  Followed the instructions step by step and ended up with the best croissants, all that was missing was the Champs-Elysees.

As other reviewers have noted, the baking times and temperature are vastly off. I baked at 375 deg F for about 15 minutes. Your mileage may vary based on the size of the dough. Having said that, the croissants turned out beautifully. Buttery and flaky and just fantastic. The recipe is incredibly detailed you can't possibly go wrong. Be patient and take your time. In the time it takes to make these things from scratch you could hop in an airplane, fly to Paris, pick up a dozen, and fly home.

it took a wee while to make but totally worth it. They are just so good, flaky and soft, really something - I'll be putting my own recipe to one side replacing it with this one. Thanks for sharing

I loved these.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I added a tsp of salt to the unsalted butter per other reviews.  I also thought that making the block of butter 6 inch square was too thick for the initial roll and it did not spread into the first layer of dough consistently.  I went online and watched another how to video on croissants and followed those directions.  I proofed in the fridge overnight. The bake time for me was 375º F for 15 minutes rotate the pans and then 10-15 minutes longer. A word of caution.  After shaping them watch the final proof and don't let it go too long.  The second batch went a tad too long setting on the stove while the first baked and were a bit flat - delicious though. I put the last 2 trays of formed croissants back in the fridge while the second of 3 batches baked and they were perfect.

This absolutely tastes authentic. I'm from Belgium so I know what's up ;) I've made these for a bake sale and they went within 30 min. The 20 hours I put in was worth it though! Love this dish. Although a little time consuming absolutely worth it.

This is a great recipe. I had to prepare it in a rush (one of those life or death situations), so I cheated by cooling in the freezer, but yet the results were really good.

I did not change anything the first time I made these. And they were utterly buttery, crispy on the outside and about a zillion soft layers in the inside. Just perfect. I could go on and on raving about these. I cooked them for exactly 17 minutes, half the time on one side, then turned them over and they were perfectly golden brown. Right now, as I type, I've started the croissant dough process again, only, this time, using half All Purpose Flour and half Whole Wheat Flour. Will update eventually how they turn up, although I'm perfectly confident they will be the delicious, buttery, crispy and yet soft layered treats that everybody would be dying to devour! Thank you so very very much for the detailed instructions.

I thought the recipe made this too complicated - it did not take me so many chill/thaw times. The croissants look nice on the outside, but the inside was not completely done. They also lacked flavor like others mentioned. Next time, I will add more salt and bake them at a lower temperature.
