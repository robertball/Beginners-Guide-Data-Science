This seems almost infinitely variable, as long as you mix fresh with smoked salmon and toss with oil, and don't overwhelm the subtle taste of the fresh salmon.  So, poach the salmon with dill and whole peppercorns, or bake, or grill.  Oil can be olive oil or mayonnaise.  Then some kind of mild onion: chopped green onion, finely chopped Vidalia, shaved or chopped shallots.  Here you could stop, or add chopped fresh parsley, cilantro, tarragon, etc.  Perhaps something piquant liked chopped dill pickle, mild capers...And put on French bread, or salad.

Incredible!  A friend made this about a month ago and it was the first thing devoured at our lunch party. She made it again for a party I had and again, it was nearly the first thing gone (we hid some for later). It's great as an app, as a "dip" with bread/crackers, as breakfast on bagels or toast or on a salad (good luck saving any). Now that I have this recipe, this will be in heavy rotation.  Thanks!

I made this for 6 French tourists who licked the serving bowls clean. If you are serving it for 12, make another appetizer because this is definitely not enough for 12 as it is sooo good. I did as the footnotes suggested and made it the day before and served it at cool room temperature of about 60Â°. I also served it with 1" baguettes that were untoasted along with crackers and toasted baguettes. The untoasted baguettes where the most popular to serve with the salmon.

It was a bit runny so I strained it in cheesecloth before serving. I also warmed it  for a minute in the microwave to bring out all the flavours. Everyone loved it!

Went with all smoked Salmon. Everyone's reactions got one person that does not like any fish to try it and he had a second crisp. That's a food compliment if their ever was one.

Delicious! I had some leftover grilled salmon and looked for a recipe or spread to use it up.  This ended up as an excellent spread and even more flavorful the next day. Easy to make and I minimized the tarragon (used dry) and of course, didn't poach any extra salmon.  Looking forward to sharing with my friends and neighbors.

Very easy to make. It was a great appetizer for a party. I omitted the butter trying to lower the fat content and still tasted amazing. Everyone at the party liked it. I used only fresh salmon (broiled, then cooled).

I added a quarter teaspoon of old bay seasoning. Next time I might even make it a half teaspoon. But I will definitely be making it again.   Great recipe!
