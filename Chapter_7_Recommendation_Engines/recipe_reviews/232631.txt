Oh my gosh! I love this stuff! !! I substituted the rosemary with cilantro, and added the salt and garlic like another cook suggested and it is SO good!! Kind of has a guacamole + hummus taste!  Mmmmmm!

Great recipe after I added garlic, salt & tahini instead of plain sesame seeds. To extend the shelf life, I leave adding the avocado until just before serving. This way I can make it a day ahead so the flavours can blend.

Sorry, this was not good! I love both rosemary + lime but they were overpowering, and the lime zest just didn't work for me in a hummus. This is a great idea in theory, but I might dial the rosemary way back, probably using dried not fresh, and omit the lime zest.

It was very good but I think it needed a little "kick" of something plus it really needed a touch of salt. I couldn't find fresh rosemary that day so I used dry and that seemed fine. Will need to figure out how to pep it up the next time.

I used two cans of 15 oz chickpeas and TWO avocados and 1-2 tsp salt. No zest of lime bc I only have a bottle of juice and I didn't measure the rosemary but went light on it due to other review. It was PERFECT! And my friends loved it too!
