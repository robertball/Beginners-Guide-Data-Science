Here are my suggestions:  double the sauce and add 1-2 cans pineapple, 4 carrots and a red or green pepper.  (green pepper can add a lot of its own flavor so don't overdo it, half a pepper will do)

I made this tonight. Doubled the sauce.  I also added a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks undrained.  Only put in 2 tsp of salt (since doubled the recipe).  I added some baby carrots, brocolli, red and yellow bell pepper strips and fresh mushrooms. Cooked everything for 4 hrs on high and it was done by dinner time.  Quick and delicious! My toddler ate it up.  I even had seconds.  Thanks for a new addition to our dinner line up!

I added strips of raw cabbage - I'm sure that bagged coleslaw mix would work just as well. As well, when browning the pork, I put in about 3 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar. It gave it a little sweetness and my whole family loved it.

This was average.  Nothing more than a low-grade barbecue sauce.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and put them in frozen.  Definitely need to add something to this to make this more savory.  My husband liked it though.

This is a great recipe that can be made with things that you generally keep on hand in your pantry.  I read most of the reviews, and made the following changes:  doubled the sauce, added pineapple and carrots, and eliminated the mushrooms.  The only change I would make is to use a little less brown sugar, as I thought the sauce was a little on the sweet side, but otherwise, a nice, easy recipe that's ready for you when you get home!

FIrst of all, we had had prok the night before and so I felt that we should have chicken or something else.  So, I used this recipe to the 'T' except used sliced chicken breasts.

When we sat down to dinner,  my husband ---who does not like sweet and sour things--at all---said that this is definitely a 'keeper'!!

I think I brutalized the recipe but it appeared to still have turned out delicious. I didn't realize I had run out of tomato sauce, so I substituted with 2 oz tomato paste + 6 oz water + silent prayer. I also added broccoli, changed the onion bit to half an onion instead and added a handful or so of a frozen onion + green peppers + red peppers combination I had in the freezer. Everything played well together and I loved the results. I had been afraid that there might be a vinegary taste but it wasn't detectable at all. I'm almost afraid to try it with tomato sauce now! Cantonese? No. Yummy? Yes.

This was an interesting recipe.  The sauce was very good, but my pork was a little dry and was actually shredding.  I used the option to cook on low for 8 hours.  I added a carrot cut into bite size pieces.  If I make again I will try cooking on high for only four hours.  I would also like to add a can of chunked pineapple for a more sweet and sour taste.

This sauce is amazing!  I took previous reviewer's suggestions and added ingredients.  I also doubled the recipe.  It turned out amazing.  Here are the ingredients I used:  4 lbs pork steak, cut into strips and browned in oil and apple cider vinegar; 2 onions, sliced; 1 pkg fresh mushrooms, sliced; 2 (20-oz) cans pineapple, undrained; 4 (8-oz) cans tomato sauce, 6 large carrots, sliced, 1 red bell pepper, sliced; 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced; 6 Tbs brown sugar, 3 tsp. distilled white vinegar, 3 tsp salt, 4 Tbs Worchestershire.  Throw it all together, and you get amazingness.  You need a full-sized crockpot to make this.  Serve over rice.

Deeee-lish.  Okay, I was in a hurry and took partial advice from other readers.   Used 2 bone-in chicken breast, 4 bone-in chicken thighs. Removed skin.  Dumped in a dutch oven/pot: The chicken, one can of pineapples with juice, 2 cans of dice tomatoes, 1 sm. green peppar (diced), 1 onion (diced), doubled the brown sugar, doubled the vinegar, salt and bring it to boil.  Simmer for 45 minutes and YUM.  My hubby added hot peppar flakes to his to heat it up.  Tasted like a gourmet sweet and sour.  We served it over rice.  Thank you Amy!

This is a "must-make" recipe.  So easy to make, and my crockpot had it perfectly tender and juicy in just 3-hours (it smelled so good I couldn't wait until the 4th hour and had to taste -- it was done, and amazing!)  For the pork, I used a package of thin pork cutlets (less than $2.00 for 5 cutlets), and sliced those thinly.  I doubled the sauce as others had recommended because my family always wants extra sauce to spoon over rice.  I omitted mushrooms to accommodate a family member preference, and added half a can of pineapple chunks, drained, as another reviewer had suggested.  After 3 hours, the pork is fork-tender, the sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and tangy and a wonderful consistency, and my prep time was only about 15 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  For those who try and the meat comes out dry, try doubling the sauce ingredients, and be sure to fry the pork strips first in hot oil on fairly high heat, until the pink is gone.  This will seal in your juices.

with some alterations this has become a dinnertime favorite!  So 4 stars for giving us a great recipe to work with.  My changes:  I brown the pork in a non-stick skillet, sprinkling with salt and pepper, then place in bottom of crock pot.  Then in same the skillet used to brown the pork I place the onion (add a tiny bit of olive oil if needed) and 1 green bell pepper thinly sliced and saute for about a minute or two.  Then I add these to the crock pot making sure to scrape out all the brown bits left over from pork and sauting (somtimes I add in a tablespoon of water to help loosen it up).  Then I add in pineapple, leave out the mushrooms for us, make the sauce, pour it over everything and cook as normal.  With these changes it's a hit for us!

I made this for my boyfriend one night because I wasn't going to be home until late. He said it was awesome! I was hoping to try the leftovers but they were gone before I could! I used boneless ribs, cut into chunks, browned with a mix of veggie and sesame oils. I left out the mushrooms, so it was pretty much just pork and onions. According to my man it was great, so, five stars! Thanks for a great recipe! Update; made this again for some friends and it turned out well. The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned; I thought the dish was a bit salty, but otherwise the flavor was great.

I actually prepared this on the stove top in a 6 qt. covered pan.  I browned the meat and then added all of the other ingredients.  I omitted the mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce and seasoned with a combination of regular and light soy sauces and Thai fish sauce.  I also added red and green pepper strips.  After simmering covered on low for about an hour,  I drained and added a small can of pineapple chunks.  I reserved a small amount of the juice and dissolved 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and used this to thicken the dish.  Served it over canned La Choy noodles.  We thought it was very good!  Will make it again!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I doubled the sauce, added frozen bell peppers and canned chunk pineapple (like others suggested) and served over rice and it tasted just like sweet and sour pork. Next time I will add brocolli and carrots too. We loved it.

This is a great recipe!!! I wanted a different pork recipe & I happened to have the ingredients on hand - my husband & kids loved it. It has the same flavors as sweet & sour pork takeout but without frying anything! I really encourage using the pineapple & peppers combo as the other  reviewers have said and also, doubling the sauce is a great idea if putting this with rice. I browned the pork, sauteed the peppers and onions and combined the rest of the ingredients and put everything into the slow cooker  -- very tasty and flexible enough to substitute any of the ingredients for your own tastes! Thanks for a new favorite!

The flavors of this dish are unique and tasty, but somehow the portions were tiny. I would up the amount of meat used (and the other ingredients accordingly). Otherwise, not bad!

I did not find this great. Bland and boring. My teens thought the same. I spriced it up before serving. Kinda disapointing since it smelt so yummy!

I wish I would have doubled the sauce and added the pineapple and veggies mentioned in other reviews. Making this exactly as directed basically makes barbeque sauce (and not even a fantastic barbeque at that). I will try this again with the additions.

This was good, I used a poin tenderloin roast. I also added the pineapple and green peppers as suggested in other reviews. I spiced up the roast when browning it before putting in the slowcooker.

I made this for my husband last night. He loved it. I deleted the mushrooms and doubled the sauce. I added stir-fry veggies for extra nutrition. I'll freeze it with rice for rice bowls for lunch or dinner.

My hubby and I LOVED this recipe! I took others advice and doubled the sauce - left off mushrooms since I don't care for them.  I added bell pepper and a drained can of pineapple chunks.  Next time I'm going to use tidbits - served over white rice and it was DELICIOUS! (I want to try with chicken too)

4.5 stars. I used pork tenderloin and it came out great, though the sauce was runnier than I anticipated.

Very tasty and easy. I changed the sauce though. I used V8 with two beef steak tomatoes processed into it, double the volume and the mushrooms/onions.

5 stars and more!!
I suggest double the sauce as well, another suggestion for those that do not have a slow cooker. I made everything as the recipe stated and let it simmer in a deep dish frying pan for 1 hour and it turned out scrumptches! I absolutely recommend that you make it :)

excellent as is but I took the advice of others and added 1 can  pineapple and some vegetables.  I also added some tapioca to thicken the sauce a bit but that is my own personal preference.  will definitely make this again.  I'm also going to try it with chicken.

Good recipe. I only had a pound of pork to use, but I still kept the sauce the same because I like to have extra to serve over rice. I used fresh mushrooms and also added some red and green pepper in the last hour of cooking. I did like it,  but like others, I felt the sauce was missing something, though I'm not exactly sure what. I'll probably make again and play around with the sauce a bit.

Kinda blah.  I made this recipe the way it was written just to try it as is but I ended up adding pepper flakes to it.  That helped a little. I saw the part about the pineapple but did not know how that would go over.  I used the remaining meat the next day mixed with bbq sauce and that was ok.  I don't think I will be making this one again.

I have fixed this dish twice. The first time I drained the mushrooms and the dish came out dry.  The second time I did not drain the can and it added just enough liquid to it.  The dish has a great flavor and will more than likely fix it again.

This was pretty good. I didn't read the reviews before I made it. Next time I'll try adding the pineapple and bell peppers, making more sauce and thickening it to a gravy, like the others had suggested. Nice and easy also.

DO double the sauce!! I didn't use mushrooms, but did use pineapple tidbits w/ the juice, tiny carrots, 1/2 green bell pepper..wished I had taken the time to add cornstarch w/ water to thicken the sauce like 1 review said they did. Served w/ Green Salad w/ cranberries (a allrecipe.com receipe), Hawiian Bread and Elvis Presley Cake for my dad's 83rd birthday.

This recipe was great! Followed the recipe and added to it: fresh mushrooms instead of canned; didn't have the Worcestershire sauce on hand used Teriyaki for substitute; added thin strips of red & yellow bell peppers during last 1/2 hour of cooking; and added a cup of fresh chopped pineapple! THE RESULTS were delicious! The meat was very tender! Served over steamed rice. We will definitely make this again!

This recipe is a keeper!  I think that its important you use pork steaks (I made it once with pork chops and the meat was very dry). Also, as other reviewers suggested, doubling the sauce is great if you are serving it over rice.

This is a good recipe! 3 out of 4 of us really liked it.  My 5yr old wasn't as thrilled but she still ate it.  My 3yr old and husband devoured it! I did make a couple changes. Omitted the mushrooms and added a can of diced tomatoes and most of a can of chunk pineapple.  Also added a little cornstarch and water at the end to thicken up the sauce.  It was perfect!  Will definitely make again.

This was very easy and very tasty! I felt it needed a little more kick so next time I may tweak the recipe a bit.  I added fresh carrots and fresh green peppers at the end of cooking and served it at a pot luck.  I also added extra sauce... Everyone just loved it!!  Everyone wanted the recipe!!

Great recipe!  The pork was incredibly tender.  Very easy, good flavor,nice meal to have waiting in the cooker after work.  We doubled it to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was a very good recipe if you follow the other reviews and double the sauce. But instead of cooking it in the slow cooker I cooked the meat on medium heat in a skillet for 30 minutes covered then combine the sauce and vegetables + the pineapple into the meat  for the last 30 minutes also covered while I seperately cooked my rice. Then combine everything together.

it was wonderful. I have made it twice now and the 2nd time I made it I only used 1 tsp of salt because the first time it was a little salty. I also used 1 and a half tsp of minced garlic. I will be making this many more times

This was a big hit for the whole family! My husband and son went back later to have a second dinner, even my 2 year old inhaled it! I had left over pork roast I used for the meat, doubled all of the ingredients for the sauce, replaced the vinegar with cider vinegar + 2 tsp of whit vinegar, added a canon crushed pineapple and a can of basil diced tomatoes both with the juice. Amazing results! This is a keeper in my recipe box!

Was good, but not one I will make often. Added pineapple tidbits and tried to play up the flavor and still think it was lacking something.

I found this dish to be very bland. I had to add a few other ingredients including pineapple, and some of the juice just to add flavor. I don't think I will try this again.

Just finished the dishes on this and the Wife is off to the pizza take out for supper! If you like your pork mushy, go for it! No flavor at all!  Lots of prep work for a whole lot of, well, something lacking. Lacking sweet, lacking salty, lacking a lot! Waste of time, food & electricity!!

We loved this but agree it needs more sauce and some veggies.  It was a nice blend of bbq which I like and sweet & sour which my husband likes.

It was ok.  I used pork tenderloin.  For some reason the pork remained dry.  The sauce was too watery as others have said.  It smelled great and had a good flavor, but I probably won't make it again.

My family and I really enjoyed this simple through together recipe.  It is nothing elaborate but that is what makes it so fun, one can make it so.  For spicy add thai chilis, for hawiian add pineapple and grn. pepper, for italian add herbs i.e. rosemary/oregano/basil.  It can be served atop any starch to fit ones 'through together' idea.  I actually have made this both times ontop of the stove at a heat of medium low (simmer, covered, with the occasional stirring) in just a matter of 2 hrs and the meat just falls apart in your mouth. So even if one doesn't get it going before they start their day tender meat can still be achieved in just a few hours with not much other work. :o) thank you

I thought this dish had potential but seemed a little watered-down and bland.  I may give it another shot but I think I will cut the amount of mushrooms and add pineapple just before serving.  It's lacking something but I can't put my finger on what.  I'm hoping the pineapple will help.

Good and easy when made just as written.  I've also cooked this in a dutch oven on my stovetop.  Since the dutch oven has a tight-fitting lid, less of the liquid evaporates and you have a saucier meal.

This was just alright for us.  It was good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I even added the pineapple and pepper as suggested.   It is very easy, so I will likely make again with a few more changes.

this was interesting...definitely not even asian-esque.  I added more vinegar, some rice wine, and soy sauce.  I thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.  I also added some canned pineapple.  It was not bad.  before I doctored it up, it tasted like vegetable soup.

This dish was good, but not terrific. I think it deserves four stars, but I gave it five because my husband liked it a lot, and said he had a dish that tasted a lot like it that was Cantonese. He nearly ate all of it in one sitting. I felt like it tasted more like glorified sloppy joes, but maybe that's why my husband liked it so well. :)

This came out much better then I expected as I am usually not a big fan of pork dishes. The meat was tender & delicious however I did feel the need to add in some additional veggies just to round out the meal the way that we prefer. This was excellent with some lovely steamed jasmin rice.

This was delish- a definite keeper. I used some pork stew chunks I got on sale. Added the green pepper as suggested, but just put them in at the beginning w/ everything else. Served over white rice and thoroughly enjoyed.

I made this for company and it was a hit!  My husband requested it again for the following week (I don't think he's ever done that before) and my company sent me a thank you note for the "awesome" dinner!  And it is super easy to make.  A definite repeat.

I made this with chops and it was very good.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of tomatoes in juice and it was just fine.  I also browned the pork with a T. of flour and it helped thicken up the sauce.  I made some fried rice and broccoli with chili and it was a great meal!!

I made this dish for dinner a moment ago. My husband loved it. I omit the vinegar, added a dash of powdered black pepper and used golden mushroom instead. Also, instead of tomato sauce, I put a can of stewed chopped tomatoes. It was much better because it gives a chunkier taste. Excellent!

I thought this recipe was easy to prepare, inexpensive and a great meal to come home to on a weekday.
I would add some more veggies next time ... but my husband and I both enjoyed the flavor and the ease of cooking.
It was great re-heated for lunch the next day!

Very good! My whole family enjoyed it. It reminds me of a pork version of "Beef Paprika" which is a family favorite. I'll probably add some paprika next time for a little more spice. Oh yeah, I used carrots instead of mushrooms.

I also did what other reviewers suggested by doubling the sauce and added pineapple.  We decided we only wanted the juice of a pineapple next time.  My husband absolutely loved this.  I have to omit mushrooms though because he doesn't like them.  It was easy and good.  Thanks!!!

This is easy to make, but I did use suggestions of other people by adding carrots, pineapple & green pepper.  I believe they are a must, not an option.  Fresh mushroooms instead of canned would be better.

Enjoyed it greatly.  The house smelled wonderful all day while it was cooking in my crock pot.  I made the recipe with an already cooked half of loin of pork and it was very tender.  It only fed three people though, I would definitely double the recipe.

Good, but tends to be a little dry.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe.  I also added some pineapple chunks and will also add a handful of peanuts next time.

While I found this dish to be very tasty and easy-to prepare since it is a slow cooker recipe, it very simply IS NOT Cantonese!  I will continue to make this dish, but not when I'm looking for something Oriental or Chinese in taste.  Thank you for sharing.

I prefer to use lean pork butt - cut into medium size strips. Much more tender than the pork steaks when cooked for so long.  I also prefer to use canned Asian peeled straw muchrooms from the Asain grocery.  Easy, yummy meal to put together in the morning and have ready when you get home at night.

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce and added a bag of oriental style frozen veggies at the end, this stretched it further and made it a more "all in one" recipe

I added Green Bell peppers, grated Carrots and Pineapple. The sauce lacked a finished mouth feel and taste. I added a little minced Garlic and fresh ground black Pepper. That really finished the sauce off well. My wife and Son loved it!

I chose not to slow cook this dish. Instead, I marinated it overnight, then cooked it on the stove in a non-stick pan; over low/ medium heat. My boyfriend gave it two thumbs up. This cut the cooking time in half, and created a nice sear on the meat. Although this was a small modification, it made all the difference! I found that the pork was still tender and juicy. My only complaint was not having enough mushrooms. We personally can't get enough of the veggie.

Made  this recipe as written but  could not find a pork steak so I used pork  boneless cutlets and cut them into small bites.  The house smelled fantastic and the dinner was a great success.  I will make it again . Fast easy and great tasting

Got amazing reviews from my family. The boys all cleared their plates AND asked for more. There were no leftovers this night. I though it was good but that I had made better asian food before. All in all would mind throwing it together again.

I served this over rice with some veggies on the side.  It was quite good.  I used 2 large pork chops (that I found in the freezer) instead of the pork steaks.  I shortened the cooking time so that way the chops didn't dry out.

Super good and easy to boot! I used 1 lb. of chicken instead of 2 lbs. of pork and next time, I probably will cut the salt just a bit as it was a tad too salty.  I served this over rice with a side salad.  I will definetly make this one again!

I made this for dinner tonight and we enjoyed it. the meat came out very tender. I doubled the sauce, but used tomato puree instead of tomato sauce because that was all I had on hand. I served this with white rice and stirfried cauliflower and carrots. Next time I will try adding green pepper and pineapple as others have suggested.

This reminded me of something my mother would have whipped up to go with the good old chop suey hamburger casserole.  Nowhere near authentic but not bad either.  We aren't diehard sweet and sour fans so I won't probably make it again, but it was fun to make it once.  Thanks.

This was an easy meal to make that we all loved.  It actually took 3 hours on high for a little over 2lbs of pork.  I had to add 2 more tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. I also added stake seasoning.

Very easy and tasty.  I added green peppers towards the end.  Reminds me of sweet and sour pork that my mom made... pretty much the same flavor but hers had green peppers and canned pineapple chunks added at end!

This recipe had more of a bar-b-que flavor than sweet and sour. The pork steak was melt in your mouth tender made this way. Nice sauce over rice.

Pretty darned good.  I took advantage of a few peoples' suggestions: I added a little more liquid in the form of white grape juice and I added a package of oriental veggies.  Very good.

My family loved this recipe and I loved
how easy it was to prepare. It was 
great on rice or even mashed potatoes.

Excellent recipe!  Easy to pull together with our busy schedule.  My three boys loved it.  We made enough for eight and our family of five ate the entire pot.

Wow! This recipe has great flavor and even when made in the 'short-cut' skillet version tastes great. Thanks for sharing this one!
