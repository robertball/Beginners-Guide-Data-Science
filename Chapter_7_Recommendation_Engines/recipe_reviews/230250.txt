Great recipe! But I tweaked it to fit what was on hand. Beef broth rather than chicken. Like the other reviewer, all fresh and no frozen veges. I added a half teaspoon of Thai chili paste (cranking up the hot meter). Apple juice instead of orange juice.  No zest (whatever good that is?!). And I only used two chicken breasts. Everyone loved it (4 teens, my husband and me)!

I made this delicious recipe today with a few changes.  I did not add a pkg of frozen stir fry vegetables because I prefer fresh but also it would have been too many for the recipe.  I also didn't add the red peper flakes.  You can use any type of rice.  I had some jasmine rice on hand so I used that but prefer brown rice.  It took a bit more time to prepare than 20 min. so don't make it if you're in a hurry.  I'm sure this recipe will not disappoint.  ENJOY!!!

Made this recipe for dinner last night. The prep time was longer that twenty minutes, but was well worth it. I had  added a few more spices and some red, green and yellow peppers. 
The taste was so delicious. Thought i had made enough for left overs; Boy was i wrong.
Next time i will make enough to ensure that there is enough left overs!
Just a great recipe, and very healthy as well. Will make this again real so. My whole family enjoyed it

I made this the other night using two packages of frozen veggies and no fresh ones because I was short on time. I also served it over brown rice. My husband told me about three times during the meal that he really liked it. I will definitely be making this again.

This is fabulous! The only change I had to make was using fresh ginger instead of ground. I think the amount of orange peel should be to each person's taste. For me, 1/2 tbs. was plenty but others may prefer the amount called for. Very customizable, quick, and easy. A definite re-do for me. Thank you! :o)

Separate the three steps of veg, sauce and meat so you get a true stir fry.  Add marmalade and cut back a bit on the spice.  Use only fresh veggies and it's perfect!

The recipe is a good base to start from, I would add brown sugar and more spices. The chicken cooked up really well with the orange mix, and we enjoyed all the veggies!

I made the orange chicken stir fry. It turned out great! I didn't have all off the ingredients, so i improvise. Trick... add oyster sauce, it gives the dish a very nice flavor and tang!!!

This was super bland. For all effort, I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe as written (although we use coconut oil to cook).   I used fresh squeezed orange juice and zest but it really didn't taste orange-y at all.  My guy said it was "good" and "edible" but neither of us thought it was very flavorful.  I was really excited about this one and it didn't pan out.  At least it was healthy with all that veg.

Brown sugar. That's all this recipe needed. And a good squirt of sriracha. Excellent with those additions.

The juice overpowered the flavor or the sauce .  Next time I will try orange peel and instead of dry pepper flakes, I will use chili japones.

I used frozen stir fry vegetables and added about 1/4 cup orange marmelade and added a yellow pepper since I needed to use it up. Wow was this fantastic! Without telling me, my family all ate at McDonalds for dinner tonight so I don't have to share this with anyone! Yum!

Very delicious!  I also used fresh veggies that I had to use up.  Broccoli, cauliflower, sweet peppers, celery and zucchini?  I sautéed yellow onion with the chicken for a few minutes before I added the orange mixture. Even my 8 yr old granddaughter went back for seconds!

This was really delicious and fairly easy. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added some brown sugar, and it seemed like a great addition! My husband loved it and wanted all the leftovers for work the next day. I think next time I’ll do fresh veggies instead of frozen veggies, but I will definitely make it again.

Thank you for submitting this recipe.  Made it tonight with minor adjustments (because of what was on hand).  It was enjoyed by everyone including those who do not normally care for Oriental type foods.  I think that adding a bit of brown sugar helped decrease their reticence.

I added honey to the sauce.  Also, next time I will double to sauce.  I stir-fried chicken and veggies separately, then added sauce last.  We liked it.

Loved this recipe! I added green pepper and doubled all the ingredients for my family of 5 so that there was some leftovers for the next day. The sweet orange flavour really comes through. Served with basmati rice on the side.

Could have used some salt - but that is me.  

I modified it.  Cooked the chicken prior to adding the sauce.  Next time will steam broccoli prior to adding.

Great recipe to which you can use any assortment of veggies....likewise, I did not use the frozen veggies, only fresh, and had on hand broccoli,  red peppers and onion.   Used only 2 chicken breasts and the same liquid measurements as I was only cooking for 2;  the extra sauce gives you more to pour over rice.

great recipe. i served mines over thai jasmine rice. the only changes i made to this, well added to the recipe from my garden.
 3 leaves of fresh sweet basil chopped
fresh lemon thyme to taste (it is a strong flavor so be careful)
fresh oregano (just a few leaves)
i also added some sesame oil and peanut oil
 this added a few more flavors that i like and didnt overpower the rest of the dish.

It was good, but definitely missing something. I doubled all of the ingredients for the sauce, and still found that it wasn't quite enough, but that's just a personal preference.

Awesome recipe!  I added a little zucchini to it though!  When I make this again I'm going to try with Lo mein noodles instead of rice!

This recipe is a lot of things, but it is not a stir fry, which by definition is cooking small bits of food quickly in a very hot pan. The chicken is more boiled, than fried, as are the vegetables. Half a cup of orange juice is 4 tablespoons, which is mixed with 3 tablespoons of soy sauce - an almost 50/50 combination which pretty much kills the orange flavor or sweetness. To follow the recipe, total cooking time is between 14 and 20 minutes, certainly not a stir fry. I was left with a lot of liquid, and some overcooked vegetables. I added sliced pieces of the green portion of a leek, a drop of orange extract, some mirin, and a tablespoon of orange/apricot preserves, trying to cover the soy sauce flavor, and a few other things that I don't recall.
What I ended up with wasn't bad when rice was mixed in; in fact it tasted better the next day. But it certainly wasn't the stir fry I was expecting, and only realized it wasn't as I was actually preparing it per the instructions. Not on my hit parade, but probably partially my fault for only looking at the ingredients and not fully reading the preparation instructions more closely.

I made this tonight for dinner and was quite disappointed! Not sure if I went wrong somewhere.. The only changes I made was I didn't use frozen veggies (subbed onions and orange peppers) and didn't have snap peas. My chicken broth was sodium free which may be why I felt the sauce to be a little bland. Both my boyfriend and I had to add hot sauce as it tasted very plain! I'm sure the recipe tastes great if made word for word. I may try this again!

This recipe was just okay. I would try it again with my own touches. We found it to be much too bland. I did use fresh ginger, and all fresh veggies, but I can't see how that would make that much of a difference. Would try it again, but with some major doctoring to add flavor.

This was one of my fav dishes! It was easy and very tasty. I used all fresh vegs and freshly squeezed oranges.  I did add extra red flakes and the heat with the oj sauce worked great. I can't wait to make it again.

I tried the recipe just as is except I used fresh veggies instead of frozen. Way too hot for my family !! The 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes was too much of a "kick". I did not like the orangey taste with Stir-fry. The Stirfry sauce had a smooth and perfect consistency. Would not make this again.

Excellent! I too didn't use frozen veggies, added carrots, no hot peppers. Took longer than 20 minutes to prep. Added more ginger, orange zest was just right for us! I also added a little more soy sauce to taste (I had used "less sodium" soy sauce), and my daughter added some salt - but, we all loved it! We had plenty for leftovers!

thought this was bland. It needs more kick. If I make this again, I would up the amount of pepper.

I followed the recipe (to save time I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies) and found the orange flavor with a touch of heat was perfect. Will make again for sure!

I really really really enjoyed this recipe! Although I did have to make some adjustments as well based on what I already had on hand. I used 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed OJ and omitted the orange zest because of previous reviewers who said it was a bit too 'orange-y', and it turned out wonderful even without it. Left out the ginger since I didn't have any, and instead of the vegetable oil I just did 1 tbsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of olive oil. I used less oil because I had less meat than the recipe called for. Also used shrimp instead of chicken. It turned out a little tough though, so if you use it I would recommend adding the vegetables first then cooking the shrimp last to avoid over-cooking it. And for the veggies I did sliced carrots, broccoli, sweet peppers, and regular peas. I also used about 3/4 of the cornstarch mixture to make the sauce nice and thick so I could add everything over a nice bed of quinoa.... turned out SO delicious!!

I thought this recipe was great!  I made a few changes.  Since it called for orange zest, I squeezed fresh orange juice since I had to buy the oranges for the zest anyway.  My husband and two of my kids (both teenagers) thought it was delicious but said that it was a little too orangey.  Next time, I will cut down on the zest.  I steamed fresh broccoli and then added it to the chicken/sauce mixture and then served it over rice and some chinese crunchy noodles.  I will definitely make this again.
