This is an awesome recipe.  I am a vegan so I changed the cream to non-dairy sour cream.  I used thawed pizza dough instead of french bread dough (because it was all I had).  I sliced the onion very thin and didn't chop.  I used soy margarine and Bac-o's (which are vegan).  My husband flipped over this one!  He's not vegan and he thought it was scrumptious!  I was a little scared of this recipe at first, but it was so easy and delicious.  Beware though, it is very rich!  I'll definitely be making this often!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The taste was great, but I also had the problem with the sauce being way too thin.  It made the dough so soggy that when I tried to get it off the sheet, everything fell apart.  I will give this receipe another try, but next time I will reduce the sauce to 2/3 cup and put the ingredients on the dough first and then cover it with the sauce.

I thought the taste was good, but I messed up somewhere.  The melted butter, onions, and light cream mixture was so watery, it didn't "spread" on my rolled out dough, it ran off onto the baking sheet.  My bacon boiled in the water with the potatoes, but stayed "boiled" and flemsy and not crispy, even after being in the oven.  I think next time I will not use the potatoes and use cheese.  Also, the butter/cream mixture needs to be thickened somehow.  But, the taste was really good!  It's very different!  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids really liked this. I couldn't find refrigerated French bread dough so I used refrigerated pizza dough instead and altered cooking time and procedure accordingly. Based on reviews I didn't use light cream, and used sour cream instead. (Maybe light cream means something else in Canada but if I had used light cream I think I would have ended up with a soggy mess.) This is a convenient quick meal and based on this I would make again from scratch, esp. with creme fraiche. Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good, but did require some tweaking. For the sauce, I only used 2/3 cup cream, but added some garlic powder, onion powder, and chives to add some more flavour. I also added about 2 tablespoons flour and heated it so it thickened and became almost a white sauce.  I also used 2 potatoes as 1 didn't seem like enough. I also doubled or almost tripled the amount of bacon, and cooked it regularly in a pan as boiling it made it soggy. I also added shredded cheddar cheese on top (cheese makes everything better!).  Overall it was a very good recipe, very tasty and original!

My husband made this and it came out a bit under cooked and messy.  Can't say if it was the cook or the recipe to blame, but the flavor was good.

These are the best I have tasted. I am a veggie too. Used soy bacon and sour cream. Fabulous. Thanks a lot.

looked at suggestions and still had some problems with the sauce being too thin. We ended up with a big mess. Still very tasty!

Great recipe but it was a little too soggy for me so the last few minutes I broiled it in the oven to crisp up the potatoes and the bacon. It makes great leftovers as well!

We loved this.  The sauce was to thin though.  I thought next time I would add some flour to the onion mixture then add a little less cream.  I loved the potatoes.  Thanks for the new and different taste.
