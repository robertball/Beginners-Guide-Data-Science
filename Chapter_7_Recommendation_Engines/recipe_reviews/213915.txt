I originally got this recipe off the back of the Sargento Chesse package about 5 years ago.  I have made it numerous times and it is delicious.  Sometimes I use sweet potatoes in place of the russets.  I have also used shredded cheddar instead of the 4 cheese italian.  My brother in law who does'nt care for veggies will eat these!

This was terrific! I added a bit more olive oil.  I also added an onion and a yellow pepper in addition to the other ingredients.  Only thing I'd change next time would be to use less cheese, or none at all.  Delicious either way!

Very easy to make, and to alter with different veggies. I added half of a very large sweet onion. Might add some mushrooms next time. Delicious, healthy, and not too time-consuming for a great way to increase my veggie intake!

this was great, I would add mushrooms and any other veggie that you fancy. I would say that I added at least 20min to the baking time tho.  Also the cheese was pretty stringy right out of the oven, I will let it rest before serving next time!

Easy and delicious! I did as another reviewer suggested and also added half of a sweet onion. We had this for dinner a few nights ago, and I'm making it again tonight!

Made this tonight and followed exactly. Huge hit and no leftovers. Will definitely add more veggies next time to accommodate the vast amount of cheese and fill up the pan a bit more. Seems as if it would be great with some halved mushrooms as well.

Very tasty.  My husband even liked these veggies, and it's difficult to get him to eat veggies!

I have made this twice - with and without the cheese. It's delicious either way.  I chunk up some onion as well and add along with the zucchini and pepper.
