I made this exactly as the recipe specifies.  It's easy to prepare, and I loved the taste and texture. I am diabetic, and my cranky body seemed to tolerate it well, so I'll definitely make it again. Thanks, All Recipes, for pointing out this diabetic-friendly breakfast!

Delicious and healthy!  I did end up warming (and serving) mine with rice milk. I loved how creamy it turned out, which is a surprise for steel cut oats, but also attribute some of the thick creamy quality to the quinoa. I added bananas for some sweet taste, and pistachios for the salty counterbalance. Already making the next batch for tomorrow.

The recipe is great for three days in a row for this single living woman. A little brown sugar, walnuts, milk and I am on my way!

This is a perfect base! You can add pretty much any fruit or nuts. I add something different each week and put it in individual cups. In the morning I just heat it up in the microwave and it's good to go! Try cranraisins and cashews!

I will make this again.  Trying to duplicate a wonderful oatmeal mixture we had at a company called Epic in Wisconsin on a business trip.  I added chia and flax seeds, brown sugar and cinnamon.  They also had blueberry or peach compote that was put on it. For this I added some blueberries the last 5 minutes or so on the stove.  Then some toasted pecans when eating it. They had slivered toasted almonds and both are really good addition.  I will add this to my repertoire of breakfast recipes.

Tasty and easy!  I added some brown sugar and raisins for my own tastes.  This recipe is a good starter that you can play around with in so many ways!
