This is a great recipe for using up available vegis and eating healthy at the same time. I used zucchini, spinach and mushrooms. I baked it in custard cups (for 30 minutes) so I could refrigerate these for a couple more breakfasts. Will def make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Loved It might be a slight exaggeration, but will make this one again. And it's likely only an exaggeration because it's a pretty healthy meal, so doesn't have as much taste as one loaded with fats and salt.

This was an excellent base for me as I like to improvise with whatever is handy in the fridge, plus I knew this was going to be too bland for our pallets so I would be adding seasonings we like in our family. I love that the ingredients are minimal and there's no need to run out and buy so many little things.

So I made this so quickly - instead of chopping up onions and garlic I just used some green seasoning...Caribbeans/latinos will know what this is. Basically it's a seasoning made of ground onions and peppers and various green herbs that we keep handy in the fridge for marinades and sofritos and cooking.  I sauteed some of that in olive oil until fragrant and added diced zucchini and spinach. Just before it was cooked I added a pinch of tumeric. This makes the cauliflower less bland and gives the quiche a yellowish tinge like it has yolks. Then I followed the rest of the recipe and baked it in a old time Corningware dish because I couldn't find the pie pan and it was savory and delicious! Thanks!

Very good and easy to make.  I used what was in the fridge.  I used 2 small zucchinis, substituted 4 whole eggs for the 10 egg whites, and used mozzarella cheese.  It was delicious. I increased the amounts of spices, but it still could have used a little more spicing.  I will definitely make this again.
