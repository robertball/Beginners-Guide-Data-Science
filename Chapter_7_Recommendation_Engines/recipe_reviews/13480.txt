5 STARS only with the following fixes:   2 cups pumpkin is close enough to one 15 oz. can -- use one can and save yourself the measuring. Use 3 TABLESPOONS of spices -- I highly recommend Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus. Add a generous pinch of salt, a half tsp pure vanilla extract and a tsp of fresh orange zest. Make two 8 inch pies instead of one 9 inch. Use graham cracker crusts.  Prebake crusts for 5-10 minutes.   Expect pie, not cheesecake.   There is room on top of the baked pies to add a layer of brandied, Gran Marnier infused, or spiced whipped cream just before serving.   This recipe is easy to prepare.

I thought this pie was wonderful.  Definitely needs a deep-dish pan.  Used a shortbread crust, and added 2 Tb brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to the filling so it would not taste "bland."  Tasted good and creamy like cheesecake.  I will be making this one for Thanksgiving!

This recipe was very easy to make, and I did not have any problems with it turning out. It came out of the oven perfectly done, and set just right. It was made the day before Thanksgiving and put out on the cold porch to keep. 

When I served it up, it was denser than pumpkin pie, yet not as firm as cheesecake. And, the flavor was very, very good. Everyone who had a slice said it was delicious, and I will definitely make this my new pumpkin pie recipe.

This is good!  Not quite pumpkin pie, not quite cheesecake.  The flavor of pumpkin pie mixed with creamy goodness.  I used a premade pie crust and some real pumpkin I had prepared about a week and a half ago and needed to get rid of.  I also used generous amounts of apple pie spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, cloves) and some ginger.

Very good. This is milder and creamier than pumpkin pie, and nothing like cheesecake, so don't expect cheesecake or pumpkin pie, this pie stands on its own! I will use double the seasonings next time, but all in all a very tasty pie. I put mine in a deep dish grahm crust and I much prefer it served chilled, not warm as the recipe states.

This recipe leans more towards "pie" instead of "cheesecake". I know the recipe says "pie" but I guess I expected to taste the cream cheese more. 
It is still a very good pumpkin pie recipe. I baked it in a ten inch springform pan with a graham cracker crust. It was moist and tasty!

That is the worst pumpkin pie I ever made. Pumpkin Pie is supposed to have spice. It tastes like bland mush.

This made a nice pumpkin pie that sliced perfectly.  Please use a deep dish pie plate if you make it though.  There's too much filling for a regular pie plate.

Delicious. I pumped up the spices as we like a more intense flavor. 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1/2 tsp all spice and 1 tspn nutmeg. Also increased pumpkin slightly to use the whole large can, about an extra 1/2 cup. Filled two Graham cracker shells from the grocery store perfectly. Quick and easy dessert!

A great, easy cake to make.  Tastes like a mixture between pumpkin pie & cheesecake.  Also, it's great for diabetics because there's no sugar!
I used the oreo crumbs for the base and used a 10" springform pan.  It was perfect.

This was very good.  I personally will add more spice than what the recipe calls for, but it was yummy anyway!  I will be using this recipe for the holidays from now on!

Delish!  I omitted the spice and improvised with ginger and nutmeg. Also used a deep dish crust and used one standard size can of pimpkin.
Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC!  I made this with a graham cracker crust in a 10" springform pan.  I didn't prebake the crust.  Total cooking time was maybe 52 minutes, but I live at a high altitude and it takes things longer to cook up here anyway.  Final product is BEYOND good!  Thanks so much for posting it!

****When I served the final pieces last night, I heated them up instead of serving them chilled.  They were JUST as good!

So easy and so good. I made this and increased the spice to 2 tablespoons. I also fit it into two 8 inch graham cracker crusts instead of a 9 in pie crust. It was a huge hit.

This was very easy and yummy. The only problem I had, which has been mentioned already in many reviews was that there was waaaaaay too much filling for my store-bought pie crust. Also, I couldn't quite get the cream cheese mixed enough, so I had tiny cheese chunks in the pie.

I make this every Thanksgiving and my family LOVES it. I use a graham cracker crust pie crust instead of a regular pie crust. This recipe will make 2 pies if you use the 9-inch graham cracker crusts from the store.

I love this recipe.  Every time I have pumpkin laying around the house I make this.  My family loves it and can't get enough of it.  The only thing I change in this recipe is instead of using pumpkin pie spice, I use brown sugar.  To me pumpkin pie spice is a little to spice..y.

Incredibly good pumpkin pie. I wouldn't say "cheesecake" although it was creamier than traditional pumpkin pie. Very easy to make. I filled 1 full pie and had plenty of leftover filling... I would recommend doubling the batch and making 3 pies rather than 1.5. I had a friend tell me she is a HUGE critic of pumpkin pie and she liked the one I made from this recipe best!

Yum. There was a lot of filling, so after pouring what fit into a deep dish pie crust, I poured the rest into a 500ml corningware dish. Made a nice little custardy type dish. Easy to make, and very tasty. I will make this again :)

What a great recipe!  Have used this for a couple of family get-togethers when we were supposed to bring dessert and store-bought apple pie just wouldn't cut it.  Added some brown sugar and some imitation vanilla into the mix along with the pie spices.  The fam ate this stuff right up.

This came out absolutely wonderful!  So easy to bake. I added more spices(allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger); very happy with results! What's really good with this is some whipped topping to which I added 1 tbspn of cognac.

In theory great recipe, but pie has zero flavor.  It DOES need sugar, cinnamon or triple the pumpkin pie spice.  Maybe all of the above to revive it.  Thank goodness for whipped cream!

I modified the recipe slightly by using 1 1/2 tsp Cinammon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg instead of the 1 tsp pumpkin spice. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp bourbon. It was perfect with some whipped cream.

Will make again.  I didn't have sweetened condensed milk , so I added a comparable size of Carnation milk, and then 1/3 C sugar and 1/2 C. Splenda.  Added more Pumpkin Pie Spice , too (by 50% more), and this made 2 pies in the  pie plates that are not "deep dish".  Very good.

This is super easy to make. If you're not a baker, no worries you can still pull this off. My family & friends love it.

This is my fiance's favorite pie! I made it last Thanksgiving and Christmas. He loves it so much there were jokes about leaving me if I didn't make it again this year! I add some extra spice and made the pumpkin puree myself and it turns out amazing every time.

was not nearly cheesy enough...I wanted something closer to pumpkin cheesecake. Needed to double the spices to make it taste right.

Lacking pumpkin pie spice, I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger.  It was a nice creamy (flavor, not texture) pumpkin pie.  Will make again!

The Original Recipe Was.... OK I'll Be Honest!!! This Pumpkin Cheese Pie Recipe Was COMPLETELY TASTELESS Until I Customized It! I Ended Up Adding Cinnamon, Brown Sugar, Nutmeg & Vanilla Flavoring!!! The Pie Must Be Customized To The Individual's Taste. Also I Expected To Taste The Cream Cheese A Bit More, It Was A Very Big Dissapointment To Me When I Didn't.

I used pureed winter squash and added 2 tbls brown sugar, doubled the pumpkin spice and added 1 tbls sherry.  Great flavor.  I pute the squash through a ricer. Very smooth texture.  Too much for 1 9" crust.  Used the rest in a vanilla cookie crust.  This was very nummy.  Will be making again and again.

An easy recipe. I love creamy pumpkin pie (my husband hates regular pumpkin pie but loves this). It does create more filling than for just one regular pie. You may be able to get it into 2 very shallow pie dishes or 1 large one plus two small souffle containers. Delicious. Thanks!

This got 2 stars because it was edible.  This was so not what I expected though.  It had a very weird taste.  No one in this house liked this recipe.  Will not make it again!

I loved this creamier pumpkin pie! It tasted fabulous with a bit of extra creamy cool whip.  I used Marie Calender's pie crust for the first time and they are outstanding crusts! I may be making this again in a couple of days, it's that good!
