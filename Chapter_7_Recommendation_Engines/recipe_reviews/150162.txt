This recipe was a nice way to use the rockfish we found. Instead of a vegetable broth, we used chardonnay with the fish and it was both filling and delicious. Be wary - the spinach really cooks down significantly. Five cups of spinach really means five cups of spinach. The cooking dish will start to look ridiculously full, but keep adding that spinach because it reduces down to a fairly small bed once cooked. We second-guessed the amount and ended up sadly short on spinach.

This was a great recipe, but I made a few changes. I heeded the other reveiwers' suggestion that there was too much broth in this recipe and substituted 1/2 cup canned clam juice for the vegetable broth. I had no fresh dill, so I used 1 teaspoon of dried. I salted and peppered the fish after settling it on the spinach, then thoroughly mixed all the other spices in a small prep bowl and sprinkled on top of the fillets before covering with the onion and lemon slices. My fillets were rather thick, so I found it necessary to add about 7-8 minutes to the baking time. I suggest checking to see if the fish flake easily with a fork after 25 minutes, then adding more time if necessary. Presentation is key, so I used a slotted spatula to slide under each fillet and spinach and then onto the plate, then garnished with the cerry tomatoes. Delicious and a great presentation for a dinner when you want to impress. BTW, I had fresh rockfish caught the day before in the Chesapeake Bay so this helped with achieving a final result that was memorable!

Substitution: Chardonnay for Vegetable Broth (Who has this stuff in their house anyway?) and Red Snapper for Rockfish

I also sliced up the entire lemon and covered all the fillets with them. I don't think it made much difference.

I didn't season with salt and pepper whatsoever. I tend to leave that for the table.

This is a nice, simple way to prepare some fish. I think using the wine altered the taste profile a bit, so I'd likely make some other seasoning choices next time, but I liked it overall.

This was excellent tasting and healthy. I didn't use vegetable broth at all. Based on the other reviews of people saying it was too watery, I figured why take a chance. Came out perfect w/out the broth. I used red bell peppers instead of tomatoes, since I hate tomatoes. Loved it.

This is a good fish (in general)dish. The only thing I did differently was added a bit more spice. The 1/2 cup of vegatable broth is way too much. I doubled the recipe execpt for the broth and it was still too soupy.

What a fun dish. Easy, healty, beautiful, and most import, really tasty! I made some minor adjustments to the seasoning because I didn't have some ingredients on hand, and I did half the broth.  When I removed the foil after baking,  the smell was heaven! This recipes is lots of reward for a small amount of work.

Simple and delicious!  I used 3 tablespoons of chicken broth instead of the recommended 1/2 cup of vegetable broth.  It was watery (as other reviewers noted) but the spinach was delicious, so I will probably add the same amount of broth next time (or I may substitute 3 T of orange juice instead for a more citrusy flavor).  

I used a whole bag of spinach but it could have used even more spinach.  I left out the dill and just sprinkled the fish with lemon pepper, fresh pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, then covered the fish with onion slices, lemon slices, and a small amount of butter.  I will definitely make this again!  

I served the fish with red potatoes, sliced and baked in olive oil and parsley.

Thanks for posting this recipe. I wish I had followed it as written instead of listening to the reviewers who said it turned out soupy and didn't need the broth. About 2/3 of the way through the baking process I checked on the fish only to discover that the spinach was laying in a dry mat at the bottom of the dish. I added some broth at that time and rescued the meal but it would have been better if the broth had been in there to begin with.
I used fresh baby spinach and I'm wondering if the reviewers who said it was soupy used frozen spinach?
Anyway I will make it again but with the broth this time. :-) The only thing I changed was to use thyme instead of dill.
I served it with rice pilaf and it was quite yummy.

Very nice recipe, goes very well with rockfish. Substituted white wine for vegetable broth and added capers, used minced garlic to replace garlic powder, and lemon rind for lemon pepper.

Great dish! My Dad dives and got a lot of stuff on his last trip (lobsters, link cod, scallops and rock fish) and was looking for a recipe for the rock fish where you didn't need tartar sauce so we tried this and now everyone in my family said this was the best recipe for Rock Fish they have had. The only thing we are planning on doing differently next time is using more spinach, I made a mistake and didn't see that it wanted fresh dill and I used dried dill which wasn't bad but just need to use less next time other than those to things we are planning on keeping everything else the same the next time we cook this recipe. Great dish!

I used chard instead of spinach and it turn out great. There was a lot of liquid in the pan, but I just used a slotted spatula to scoop everything out.  Super easy meal that I'd definitely make again.

Delicious. This was my first time cooking fish and it was incredible - moist, firm, flavorful. A big hit with the family. Made without broth (was plenty liquidy without adding any) and with about 1 tsp dried dill.

While turns out pacific rockfish is a very dull fish, this is a good recipe.  I used kale, which was too strongly flavored and didn't work well, and white wine (1/2c), which did, and skipped tomatoes, and all I had was dried dill. It needed a bit more spicing - maybe fresh dill would have made it. The onions and lemon were really good and next time I'll put in more.

This was very good.  I didn't use lemon pepper because I didn't have it on hand so I am not sure if that would have added to the flavor, but was great without it.  I used only 1/4 cup of vegetable broth and that was plenty. Don't forget to remove all of the red portion of the fish if it is fresh. Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not a fish eater! Yum!

This is pretty good but I didn’t care for the dill flavor.  I will make again without the dill.  I enjoyed the ease of preparation and all the added nutrition.

Meh.....

I was going to make this dish for my SO. Glad I took the time to try the dish out before cooking it for him.  Nothing is really wrong with the recipe, it just came out too steamed-like for my taste and lacked a flavor punch.

I was pretty faithful to the original recipe.  However, I did cut the broth amount in half and substituted fresh dill with dried.  Also my fillets were fairly thick and were about 8 ounces each, so that changed the cooking time.  I really like the ingredients and the ease to which this dish went together.  My biggest complaint was that it was somewhat bland.  There was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the dish even though I reduced the amount of broth I used, but I don't see that as a big problem.  When you lift the fillets and vegetables out of the dish to serve, the liquid stays behind.  It was a good dish.  I will make this again, but I will use much more seasoning and I may eliminate the broth entirely.  Thanks!

Halfway 10 diced kalamata olives & tsp capers  w  1 1/2 pats butter on fish w butter over veggies cover w foil for last 10 minutes.  Everyone there who cooked asked for recipe

I made this last night- as written- except for the lemon slices because I didn't have a lemon on hand. We thought it was fantastic! Served it over some  jasmine rice. I made 6 servings for 3 people only 1 left this morning.

I've made it twice, and it is excellent. I used pico de gallo rather than small tomatoes the 2nd time, as that is all I had available. I did fry 2 piece of bacon and crumbled on top.   Served with rice pilaf.
Wonderful dish
Thank you

I should have read the reviews first so I would have known to use less broth.  The 1/2 cup in the recipe is way too much.  I also agree with the reviewers who said that they would use more of the spices.  But overall, it was a great way to prepare the fish and I'm sure it could be use with other types also.  I might also take other suggestions and use some white wine or clam juice next time.

Easy & Delicious. I added a couple of dashes of Tajin Clasico seasoning, because I like some hot spice. Also some zest from a frozen lemon.

I substituted kale for the spinach and added some fresh asparagus spears along with the cherry tomatoes. It was really good, tasty and healthy.

I did not have lemon pepper I used 21 seasoning salute from Trader Joe's. Then used the rest of seasonings on list as well.It had different spices in it & gave a punch. No vegetable broth but chicken broth, homemade. I put little seasoning through the spinach before I laid the fish on time. And from there it was everything the same.  Hubby said it was a hit & I will make again!!!!!!  Thank you

I made this using Tilapia ( I couldn't find Rockfish at my grocery store ). I used 3 Tilapia fillets and 1 Salmon fillet. They both turned out delicious. The one ingredient I did leave out was the dill, not a fan. In my opinion it didn't need it and I sure wouldn't want to taste it. I would make this again.

I was pleased with how the final dish turned out. Would add a bit more salt. Used about half the broth. Many complained about how much juice there was. There was a lot of flavor in the juice so I served the dish in a bowl over rice and poured the juice over it. It was delicious!

I didn't have fresh dill (who keeps that in the house?) I subbed in the chardonnay per many suggestions and made as directed at that point. Needed to cook a little longer due to the thickness of the filet but very moist.

As I was warned about this being too watery, I only added 2 TBS of white wine, but It was still way too watery and it lacked "mouth feel". If you like boiled or steamed fish you might like this, but I thought it needed more fat (i.e butter or olive oil) to be satisfying. I'd cut the liquid down even more and add more butter, or just coat the dish with olive oil and leave out the liquid. In addition, the seasonings overwhelmed the delicate rockfish, I really regret wasting the $10.00 worth of fish on this recipe

Simple, easy, tasty, quick. I used dehydrated cherry tomatoes from my garden and it created an excellent tart surprise.  I did not measure ingredients, but I'm sure I used half or less of the broth. Easy to change up spices to what you have on hand or your favorite flavors.

Yummy and easy to make.  I added red peppers and used parsley versus dill.  I used less broth (1/4 cup vs 1/2 cup) and there was still a lot of liquid in the dish.

Very tasty and any white fish will work. Next time I make this I will cut the amount of olive oil in half that is used with the spinach and feta. You only need enough to coat the leaves, not drench them!

I made this dish without deviating from the original recipe too much (I used chicken broth and tripled the recipe). As others mentioned, it was very soupy after cooking, but once the spinach and fish were lifted out of the pan, the liquid remained. The fish and spinach tasted great and the dish was very easy to put together and looked beautiful! I served with roasted red potatoes, it was a hit with my family. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was a very good dish and quite simple to make. I took other reviewers recommendations and double the spices and used half as much broth as recommended. I was able to find fresh dill, which I think made a huge difference. Overall it was a very good dish.

Very tasty and healthy recipe.  I made only limited changes--no both and a bit of wine and I added butter.  The basics of the recipe allow a fair amount of flexibility in the vegetables, herbs and broth/sauce.  The fresh lemon was, for us, an important ingredient.  The taste was  extremely fresh.  I will absolutely make this again.  It really would work for about any white fish.

I'm not a huge fan of rockfish. But we were given some and I tried this recipe because I had all the ingredients. Here are my suggestions. 
1/4 broth.... just to help the spinach gain flavor and not burn.
MORE TOMATO'S!!! 
Red onion was delicious!! 

My son and husband really liked it.

I bought a bunch of rockfish on sale, and this is the first recipe I tried that *didn't* make me regret the purchase. Delicious! I made only minor changes based on what I had on hand: no onion powder, so I used an entire onion instead of the 2 slices specified. I was also out of dill, but I don't think the recipe suffered for it. This is a keeper!

I made this relatively close to spec and it was divine! Kids liked better than fried crisp.  The fish was seasoned and tender, the spinach was the best i ever had.

I used less spinach and more fish. I used all the spices and a bit more lemon. The fish fell apart but everything tasted wonderful.   It’s a good way to bake any white fillet fish.

This was quick,  easy, pretty, and very tasty.  I used an entire 8 oz. package of baby spinach, eliminated the veg. broth and used 1/4 cup of white wine instead. The meal turned out great with a side of mushroom rice pilaf.

I made this... mostly. I was in a pinch for a rockfish recipe. As I'm not the one who cooks fish in my house, I was a little out of my element. However, I had most of the ingredients so decided to attempt. 
I made it in a foil "pod", so wrapped up and sealed. Used frozen (defrosted spinach) as a layer at the bottom. I seasoned with garlic powder and Old Bay, and sliced a large tomato, which BTW, tasted so wonderful when roasted. I seasoned each layer, including the fish, so everything came out nice and flavorful.
Before serving, I opened the pod and cracked the oven to get just a little color on the tomatoes - just 3-5 min.
My wife, who is the fish cook in the house LOVED this dish. This is now in our seafood rotation.

Note: Pods are wonderful - super easy clean-up!

First, thank you for the recipe. 

Being sincere, the spinach watered down WAY too much, and the spices ended up getting saturated leaving the fish tasting rather bland. 

So while I do absolutely appreciate your contribution and creativity, there's gotta be a better way to preserve the flavor of the spices. To be sure - the spices made made the spinach - as my dad said - tasty - but they all left the fish....

If you have a better approach, post it, Ill book mark this recipe and come back to it and try it again, as I like the overall simplicity.

Tasted OK but fish ended up somewhat tough.  I don't recommend oven baking for this fish.  Next time I will try broiling or breading and pan-searing.

Very easy, used 3bunches of spinach, I put a sprig of  tarragon on and under each fillet and slices of lemon on each fillet of rock cod.  Unfortunately the tarragon was very strong and took away from the fish.  Served with new baby potatoes and coleslaw.

Good recipe. I used about a quarter cup chicken broth which was plenty. Half a cup would have made soup. I also used parsley in place of the dill. Very yummy

Really like this recipe. Simple and tasty. However, when I have a few extra minutes, I saute onions, fresh garlic, lemon zest and pepper instead of using powdered spices. Just like the fresh flavor. This has become a standard for any kind of fish I make.

Delicious!!!  Used 1/4 cup water instead of veg broth (just because I didn’t have any) My filet was a little on the thick side so I baked it 30 minutes & it came out perfect! Loved it!!

This is a healthy and simple recipe. I recommend using kale instead of spinach — it holds its texture really well in the liquid and takes on a lot of great flavor. Served it with brown rice.

So good and very easy to prepare.  I seasoned fish with dried dill weed and garlic powder only.  Did not have spinach nor cherry tomatoes on hand, but did place a few thin slices of beefsteak tomato  on top of fish fillets in addition to thin slices of sweet onion and lime.  I substituted a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil on top instead of butter to make it heart healthy.  I also cut back on the vegetable broth to  1/4  cup. Served with white jasmine rice ( seasoned with fresh parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil)  and stir fried shitake mushrooms which I added to stir fried  green chard.  My husband and I enjoyed it so much, I served the same meal a week later!

It's ok.  Followed some suggestions from other reviews and used only 3 tablespoons of chicken stock under the bed of spinach and it was still pretty liquids.  The spinach did reduce down to next to nothing. The fish was flaky and tender which was nice, but you really need lots of the spices to make the fish flavorful.  More than it calls for in the recipe.  I might try again.

We had some rockfish that hubby caught while we were on vacation so thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Wow!  We really liked it.  I was sort of afraid that it was going to be way too much dill but it wasn't.  Everything about this dish was wonderful.  We'll have this again with more of the fish he caught.  A friend of hubby's told him to be sure to cut out the dark underside of the fillet so that is what we did.  Good advice - nothing but nice, flaky white meat to enjoy!

My and husband and I weren't impressed with this meal.  I didn't have broth so used wine.  I added fresh garlic and onions to the top.  While the flavors were good, I didn't like how much liquid was left.  If I make rockfish  again, I will lightly bread it.  Pan fry and finish it off in the oven.

Really good dish, even my husband liked it and he is not generally a fish lover.   Did make some changes, thus the 4, not 5 stars.   Per some previous reviews, I used chardonnay (1/2 cup), then put in about 7 cups of fresh baby spinach, adding some chopped onion and a little bit of minced garlic in the spinach.  For the top of the rockfish, I used pressed garlic (instead of powder), finely chopped onion, some herbs de Provence (instead of dill), and the rest the same.   Put some more of the tomatoes in the spinach also.    I will make this again, perhaps using rock cod, which we can now get fresh in our area.

I really like this recipe!!! I was traveling when I made this, and in an AirBnB with limited groceries. I used baby arugula instead of spinach, used taco seasoning/water in place of the chicken broth, removed dill altogether (hate dill) and subbed heirloom tomatoes. I didn't have onions but I used some granulated garlic. It was AMAZING!!!! Thank you for the inspiration.

I realized I didn't  have veggie broth so substituted low sodium chicken broth and white wine. Also I used a whole Meyer lemon on top. It was a delightful dish and an easy bake for a mid week meal. If I ever buy rockfish again, I would return to this recipe and will use more spice with less liquid to bake in.

This was good. Not amazing, but good. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so added a can of tomatoes. Having read reviews about additional liquid, I didn't add any broth because there was some liquid in the tomatoes. I used a bit more spinach but apart from that, followed the instructions. Healthy, and my kids ages 9 & 11 ate it, so I'd call that a win.

We loved it.  We made it with freshly caught rockfish and used chardonnay instead of broth as someone suggested.  Very mild and firm fish.

It turned out quite well, but I did not add any additional liquid as the spinach gave off quite a bit.  I also added fresh parsley and cilantro.  I added quite a bit more of granulated garlic and granulated onion, some cayenne pepper instead of black. Chopped up all the ingredients and tossed with the fish with a bit of avocado oil.  Then I placed the fish on top of the spinach and followed the recipe.  Because I was cooking a bit more, I increased the cooking time to 35 minutes.

Made this last night for a small dinner party. Taste was excellent and everyone that ate it seemed to enjoy it. First time I made Rockfish and found this recipe very easy. Only give 4, because I found after following the recipe to a tea, it lacked a distinctive flavor. Could probably have used a little Old Bay.  Worth spending the money. This recipe could be adapted with other fish.

We used Fresh Garlic in place of the garlic powder and Old Bay in place of the lemon pepper.  Left out the broth.  Layered the Spinach on top of a slab of butter, fresh dill, onions, seasoned fish (marinated in olive oil with seasonings and garlic), tomatoes, more onions and lemons and a dab of butter) on aluminum foil and sealed (like a tent). Grilled for 20 minutes. YUMMY!

This is a great one dish recipe and tastes really fresh. I took it to a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe. 
I did make a couple modifications. I use any white fish that I have available. I like Roma tomatos sliced instead of cherry ones. I put fresh garlic all over the spinach - about 5 cloves and put onion slices everywhere. I also like to use Greek seasoning on the fish or  some seasoning salt over the whole dish. I also use 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 dry white wine.

Wonderful. I used 3 large filets for 4 of us and used a little bit less than double of the spices and vegetable broth.  I had enough spinach to make a decent layer of spinach, but it could've used a lot more.  I had dried dill and just sprinkled it over the fish.  I used a few slices of lemon on each filet.  We didn't have any bones in ours and it didn't taste fishy at all after it was cooked. There was a lot of liquid in the pan, but it didn't affect what was on the plate. We had garlic mashed potatoes and some bread. Smelled great too.  Oh, I didn't have tomatoes, so will have to try that next time.

Cooked up one filet of fresh Chesapeake Bay Rockfish. Perfect recipe!!  I added sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh grape tomatoes it's what I had.  Perfect sub. I needed to heat my oven up to 425 and add 10 minutes as the fish was still raw after 25 mins of covered cooking time.  No big.  I added carrots to be steamed also in the dish & a side of mashers.  One very easy dish.  Thank you for posting. Toss it all together & your done.  Open the wine !

I can't believe how delicious this is!! And sooooo easy to make! I used a much larger measurement of  the spices. I just sprinkled it all over and didn't measure because I love a lot of spices. Between the liquid from the spinach and broth, it is a little watery, but the liquid tastes so good, it's like a little soup and mixed with rice it's good too :) YUMMMMY

Have made this twice. This was an easy recipe for rockfish. I used chard as the "bed" and microwaved it for a couple minutes in the ceramic baking dish first to get it started cooking. The first time I made it the greens weren't cooked enough, but I think baby spinach cooks faster than chard.... So, precooking the chard worked great the second time. We think it tasted very gourmet, and a nice change from pan frying! Thanks for the recipe!

I used a smaller baking dish and didn't have a problem with the veg broth unlike others, who commented. Since the broth is used to flavor the food, it wouldn't be the same without it. The key is to only put a small amount of broth on a dish-plate before putting the other things ontop of it. 

I'm not the biggest fan of rockfish, due to its fishiness, but I added a third of a chopped onion and increased the lemon-pepper to a tablespoon, and thought it tasted like it was made in a 4star restaraunt...unlike a majority of the recipes I've tried on here in the past year. 

Thanks to this recipe, I will now eat rockfish for life!!!

Yes, we loved it and will be making it again and again and again!  I didn't have cherry tomatoes or lemon, but used lemon juice instead and since hubby doesn't care for 'hot' tomatoes, I left those out as well.  The spinach was absolutely delectable and the fish (we used Basa Fillets) was tender and very flavourful.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thank you!

The flavor was a bit bland and our fish had loads of bones.  It took about 30 minutes.  Might be better with a different kind of fish?

If you like bland food, you will probably enjoy, otherwise don't bother. The only thing with any taste in the dish were the tomatoes. It was beautiful though...

Meh.  It's okay.  The amount of onion was way too much and overpowered the flavor of the fish.  I used 1/3 of a small onion and it seemed to taste much better.

Easy to make!  The overall taste wasn't to my liking but I think we didn't care for the taste of the rockfish and the seasoning was actually very good.
