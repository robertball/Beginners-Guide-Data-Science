As others have mentioned, the flavor of the original recipe is rather on the light side.  For a richer Irish Cream Flavor, double the Irish Cream to One (1) full cup, and also increase the whole egg plus one egg yolk to two full eggs.

I found no need to mix the egg yolk into the batter prior to adding the whole egg; just add the whole eggs all at once.

With this new formulation, the batter, immediately after mixing, is soft enough to be scooped into a piping bag and piped  onto the cookie sheets.  Done so, baked for the recommended time, makes excellent cookies with no need to refrigerate for hours and roll out the dough.

It was grat dough to work with!  Super easy!  I was able to FIX the "BLAND" flavour by adding 1/4th cup of Butterscotch Schanpps, just that little amount adds a wonderful sweetness to it that makes you want more!  JUST ADD A 1/4 CUP BUTTERSCOTCH SHNAPPS and USE 3/4 CUP BAILY'S IRISH CREAM, and it is wicked yummy!  My Family Loves it, the cookies didn't last 15 mintues once I brought them out! So Make a double batch!

I made the dough before I hit the sack, and baked them in the morning, which was a lot of fun. It was easy to make, and the dough was great to work with. But, the final product was rather disapointing. Nice and smooth, but not to great on flavor. The irish cream was hardly noticable. In order to spice thing up, I split the cookies in half and made them into sanwhich cookies, using the Sugar Cookies Frosting as my midle. I switched the milk+vanilla to irish cream, and it came out great!

I doubled the sugar for the cookies, rolled them into balls after chilling them, and flattened them with a glass dipped in powdered sugar.  They tasted fine like that but to add some flavor after they cooled I made a glaze of powdered sugar, Irish cream, and a little Butterscotch schnaps.  It really made the flavor pop.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used more irish cream.  These turned out great!  I brought them to a cookie exchange and had a coworker ask for the recipe!  My roommate and husband raved about them for days.

We made these for our Culinary Arts class, and could not use the Irish Creme(alcohol), so we substituted Irish Creme coffee creamer(the liquid kind).  The texture was great, the flavor lacked a little, but overall, good for a sugar cookie recipe.  I would like to try frosting these using the coffee creamer as the milk in the buttercream frosting, to see if the flavor is enhanced.

After the reviews I  didnt want bland cookies so I added a half a cup of brown sugar a teaspoon of almond and an extra med sized egg. The results were so delicious! They were melt in your mouth yummy! Somewhat biscuit cookie like.

I baked the cookies just as the rcipes reads, no changes.  After they were baked I added green sugar to the tops on some, green butter cream frosting to some and left a few plain.  The cookie is tender and light in flavor.  My husband and children loved them and asked for  me to bake them again.  Now, next time I make them I will change the amount of Irish Cream and follow the advice of a few others.  I can not rate a recipe unless I make and bake it according to the original recipe.  I feel this is a good cookie but a few changes could possibly make it better.

These cookies had a very unique taste they were nice and flaky not overly sweet so maybe an icing would be good I'd say if you like Irish cream then these are worth trying.

I did not like these cookies.  I had high hopes for this recipe, as I made the changes suggested by other reviewers--including doubling the amount of Irish creme liqueur and frosting them with cream cheese frosting (mixed with Bailey's and sugar)--to make them less bland.  However, they still weren't very good.  The cookies were too thick and they didn't taste very good--and I like Irish Cream.  Don't bother making these--next St. Patrick's Day I will just make sugar cookies in the shape of Shamrocks and forget it.

These were the best sugar cookies I've ever had. The Irish Cream makes all the difference and makes the sugar cookie into a full-bodied, flavourful cookie.

The recipe is good except I used half butter and half shortening.  and added a half a cup of brown sugar and I chopped half cup pecans and let them soak in 4 table spoons of irish cream to make the cookies stronger.

After reading other recipes for sugar cookies I do not understand how anyone would find this recipe satisfactory. This recipe is too thick and cakey for me. Changes to this recipe; baking soda not power, less flour 3-3.5 cups, shortening not butter, equal amounts of brown/white sugar, and irish cream with butterscotch schaps.

These were really good, though I cut way back on the baking powder because I don't like the fluffy kind of sugar cookies.  I also followed the suggestions about increasing the amount of liqueur and using 2 full eggs.  The Bailey's frosting I added made them awesome.

I doubled the Irish Cream as others had suggested.  I made the first batch of cookies as drop cookies and they weren't so good.  I rolled out the rest and they still weren't so good.  They were just bland.

Typically I like a flat, crispy cookie. These are puffy and cake like, but i still really like them! Reduced recipe to 12 cookies & doubled the Baileys. I also chilled the dough 20 min, then dropped by spoonfuls (which I smooshed slightly) and chilled another 10 mins. Other reviewers complained dough was sticky (oh~ I totally agree with that!) so i reduced the heat by 25 degrees so they wouldn't spread so much. Baked 8 mins. Perfect! Also, I want to try these with a Hershey's Kiss in the middle... I adore Bailey's & chocolate together!

I followed the advice to double the amount of Bailey's and just use 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg and 1 egg yolk, and the dough came out perfectly!  The cookies were delicious and everyone loved them!

These were average sugar cookies. Soft inside and crisp outside, but not much more than an average. My family of six barely ate one batch and there was plenty of dough left over in the fridge.

Over all this is a must have recipe for St. Patrick's Day. It was very sweet! But the cookies needed more irish cream, about a fourth a cup or more. Also, it needs icing. I made a butter cream icing and added irish cream to give it that taste that the cookies were missing (put in green food coloring and topped it off with green sprinkles too). Kids love it the most. It definitely satisfies your craving for sugar!

kind of on the bland side, but i mixed together some baileys irish creme and some powdered sugar till i got the consistancy I wanted. I then glazed the cookies with the frosting and this perked it up a bit.

I typically bring desserts to work to get rid of them, but people tend to leave me with a ton of leftovers to take home anyway.  I followed the recipe but did as Leo M. Lalande said with doubling the Irish Cream and using two eggs , but iced the cookies with my own homemade royal icing.  My workmates LOVED these!  We shared them around the entire building  and I had only two cookies to bring home with me!
Love to make again and again.

My husband made these and they were awesome. New to the rolling pin and needing reminders of light flour he other wise did GREAT. It was a good recipe for a newly retired guy to do. And this took stress of getting everything done in time from me. They are soft and delicious. We used the frosting from the Bailey's brownies. And white sugar and milk for the virgin ones.

I made the dough yesterday, left in the fridge over night got out to find it was still like glue, rolled out between two sheets of parchment paper but still stuck, put into freezer to see if that works
