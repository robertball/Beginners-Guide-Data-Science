Had a very smokey taste and I would recommend making a little extra sauce to use for dipping.

Followed the recipes closely except substituted chicken broth for the wine and garlic powder for the onion powder. Overall the recipe was delicious and my family loved it!

Wow! What amazing flavor here! I added an additional T. of olive oil to the marinade. It was more like a rub consistency with the added tablespoon. I also took the advice of the first reviewer and made extra sauce, tripled it actually. Some extra for coating the chicken while cooking it and then some to use as a dip with the meal. My husband and I loved the results!

Had this for dinner this evening. I had a couple chicken breast and I pounded them down to about 1/4 -1/2 inch thickness. I didn't have any bacon so I used Olive Oil and Butter to cook the Chicken in (which worked wonderfully) I doubled the recipe and the only thing that I would do different next time is LESS SALT. When I doubled the recipe it then calls for 3 teaspoons - way too much salt. OH and I also added another Tablespoon of Oil to the Marinade. Other than the salt I thought this was a fabulous  recipe! Since the breast were thinner cooking time was a lot less. Next time I will use less salt and top with the Bacon.... YUMMY!
