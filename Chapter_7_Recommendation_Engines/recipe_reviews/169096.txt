I'm cooking this recipe right now on the stove top in my cast iron dutch oven; it's not ready yet, but looks and smells delightful. I wasn't sure how much Balsamic vinegar to use - I'm using less meat overall (moose), and I added 3 Tablespoons of vinegar. Damion, if you ever end up reading this, could you please let me know how much vinegar you usually use? Thanks!

Havent tried it, but am going to.  But a quick question...I have heard that you need to let the venison "sit" in vinegar or lemon juice to get the "odor" out before you prepare it.  Would that be the same thing you are doing when you put the "kiwi and red wine" in it?  Thanks!

just answering the person asking about sitting the venison in vinegar. the vinegar trick is to take the "game" taste out of venison. you add salt to take some of the blood out which is where the game taste is.

Trying to use up some of the deer meat my husband has, he wanted me to make stew.  I don’t eat venison, so this review is based on my DH & DS comments.  I made this recipe as written, using all of the listed ingredients, with the exception of the mushrooms.  Not because I didn’t have them, but my family is not a fan of them.  I used Barefoot® Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine and my family was not impressed.  They said the taste of the wine overpowered the dish.  The recipe calls for balsamic vinegar, giving no measurements, so I added 3 TB as did a previous reviewer.  The ingredients were in the slow cooker on low for about 8 hours.  Family said the meat and veggies were cooked perfectly, but they could not get past the wine taste.  I found this odd since they are both wine drinkers.  They are not sorry that they tried this recipe, it gave them a chance to try a new vegetable, parsnip, but I am sorry that I am leaving a low star rating.  I may give this another try sometime, but I will use a different wine choice.
