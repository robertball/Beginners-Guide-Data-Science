Tried applying this to a different pre-made brie and got some unfortunate results baking wise. Nothing wrong with this recipe though!??

Made without artichokes,  Planned it as an appetizer but rich enough to be the main course! Pairs well with red wine.

This recipe is to die for!!! I'm a brie-freak, but my husband doesn't like it. However, even my husband enjoyed this recipe! This is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

This disappeared so fast from the appetizers bar that I barely got a taste of it! I did sub chopped roasted red peppers for the sun-dried tomatoes, but do believe either would be delicious.

I made this recipe for New Years Eve and it was a big hit!  I did not change anything and the flavors were wonderful on crostini or crackers.  Will make again.

I normally make baked Brie with filo or puff pastry and was going to add the sun dried tomato topping to that. Turns out I bought the puff pastry cups instead of sheets. I followed the recipe exactly, but added the "cups" around the outside. It turned out great, but the cups were undercooked where they were wedged between dish and cheese edge. Next time I will half the "cups" and not wedge them.

I really liked this recipe.  I did add walnuts which added a nice extra crunch as a complement to the soft cheese.  Everyone complemented me on this appetizer.  I served it with  toasted  baguettes slices.

Amazingly easy, and great for presentation.  When I make other brie appetizers, it sometimes gets a little messy!
