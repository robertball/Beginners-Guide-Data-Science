These proteins bites were really different than what I expected. I found them tasteless (but overly sweet), and the texture was just not to my liking (the quinoa made them somehow gooey). I won't make again. I ended up slicing them, toasting them well and serving them with sharp cheddar, to counterbalance the sweetness.
