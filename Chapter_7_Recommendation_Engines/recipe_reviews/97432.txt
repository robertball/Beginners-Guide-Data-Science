This soup has a wonderful texture, thick but incredibly creamy.  The taste is somewhere between dinner and dessert, a nice change of pace.  My soup came out looking appetizing, just a little lighter in color than a slice of pumpkin pie.  I did make one major alteration: instead of topping it with blue cheese and bacon, I fried a pound of bacon and wrapped each slice around a half a slice of Gouda cheese.  I then rolled these into crescent rolls and served them with the soup, encouraging people to dip them.  This turned out to be a major hit!

A very nice fall soup!  I made a few changes and the outcome was fabulous!  I cut the ceyanne pepper completely as we don't like spicy things.  I used turkey bacon in place of regular bacon and I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar.  I also added a few extra pinches of salt and a dash of white pepper.  I will defintiely make this soup again!  Thanks!

Very good and quick to prepare. The longest part was browning the bacon! It was just a bit spicy for my taste, so I will cut the cayenne in half next time and put out hot sauce on the side. My husband loved it just as it was.

this soup is so deliscious.  and the extra touch of bacon and bleu cheese as a garnish really give it an elegant and upscale feel.  i would make this certainly as a first course to Thanksgiving dinner and any time we have special company over during the cooler months.  it is soooo easy!

Excellent. I used cinnamon and nutmeg since I don't care for all of the spices in pie spice, added a lot of cayenne and ground pepper because I love it, and added a few chives to the garnish. Left everything else as written - awesome. Thanks!!!

WONDERFUL recipe.  Too bad I can't find  a way to make it look more appetizing; once I added the molasses, the soup turned to brown glop.  What delicious glop, though!  I added a bit more cayenne to offset the sweetness.  Mmmmmm.

This was absolutely delicious!! I added a little sherry - maybe about 2T. One review asked what "pumpkin pie spice" is... it is a spice mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice - I didn't have the mixture on hand myself, so I used a heaping 1/4t of both cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/8t of ginger and allspice.

YUM! I served this for first course on thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. The only changes I made was I used pumpkin pie filling and therefore omitted the pumpkin pie spice and molasses. I was a little worried that it would come across too sweet so I sauteed 2 onions in butter and added the remaining ingredients as written to that. I didn't use as much stock (I used veggie to make this vegetarian) as was called for or as much half and half. I added the garnish at the end and also added chives for color. My husband said this was his favorite dish of the day. I am making again to bring to christmas dinner. Thanks so much!

A delicious soup! However, when I made it with molasses, it was a disaster; when I made it with genuine maple syrup, it was to die for!  I served in a bread bowl and it went down a treat!

I like thicker soups, so I used 3 cups instead of 1 quart of stock.  To make it healthier, I substituted low-sodium stock, fat-free half-and-half, and reduced-fat blue cheese.  I left the out the added salt as my stock already contained salt.  Turned out great!

This is a great seasonal soup. I recommend using fresh chicken broth rather than canned (I've used both and can taste a noticeable difference). Goat cheese (or any other crumbled cheese) also works as a sub for bleu.

my daughter made this, doubled in fact, and it turned out just awful.  We used fresh pumpkin, goat's milk (which is creamier than 1/2 & 1/2) and followed the instructions to a "t" --it looked lovely, smelled remarkable --but tasted like BLECH!  We ended up pulling out the packaged of ready-mades & had an unhealthy dinner instead.  boo hoo.

A good fall/winter soup.  The recipe says to simmer for 10 minutes over low heat.  I brought mine to a boil so that the ingredients would combine, then simmered.  Also, unless you have a shallow bowl, the bacon and cheese sink and are not actually a "topper".

I was really happy to find a pumpkin soup recipe that didn't have curry. I was afraid this might be too sweet, but was pleasantly surprised! The blue cheese and bacon add a nice savory/salty quality to balance the molassas. I did use only 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper because of my toddler, who loved it, but otherwise made as directed.

Yum, this is the best! I'm not even really a 'soup person', but this one intrigued me and it was certainly simple enough to prepare. I made it exactly as instructed and it was divine. How can you go wrong with blue cheese and bacon as a garnish?! A simple, elegant soup with 5 star restaurant taste and presentation. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought the addition of bacon and blue cheese was a mistake. Completely different flavors that didn't complement the soup in the least. Soup on its own was nothing exciting. A little sweet. This soup didn't do it for me at all.

This was EXCELLENT - used gorgonzola vs. blue cheese 1st time and shredded Parm the 2nd.  Used pre-cooked bacon bits.  Husband also put croutons on top.  So easy and great flavor!  A keeper.

I absolutely love this soup! The first time I made this I did not have molasses so I used brown sugar.  I have tried the molasses since but I actually prefer the brown sugar.  Easy and delicious especially on a cool fall day!

I really wanted this to be excellent but it was only mediocre, or as my BF put it-- "it's not bad; it's not good."  I actually was constantly vacillating between liking and disliking it.  I think the strong molasses flavor overpowered the subtles of pumpkin and broth.  Not recommended.

EXCELLENT soup...and if you have leftovers...sautee some sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a bit of vegetable oil, and add a tablespoon of curry powder while they're cooking.  Once cooked through, add the leftover soup and some frozen green peas (thawed).  Simmer over low heat about 5 min.  Serve over hot rice...seriously delicious!!

This soup Rocks!  I made it exactly as published, even though I was a little worried about the molasses.  It turned out delish!  The only change I had to make was to substitute feta cheese for the bleu cheese. I'm allergic to wheat and can't use moldy cheese because the mold is grown on bread.

Wow! A creamy pumpkin soup with a big spicy kick! I did not top with the blue cheese and bacon, because I did not have any on hand, but it was still delicious on its own with a handful of croutons. I first melted the butter and sauteed the shallot for a couple minutes over medium heat. Then added remaining ingredients, brought to a bubble, then reduced heat to low and simmered for 10 minutes.

Two years ago I tried making pumpkin soup for the first time.  Not so great recipe.  Last year I tried another one.  Sickening recipe.  I was about to give up but gave this recipe a try.  The third time was the charm!  Amazing!  I will make this soup every year for the rest of my life!

This is a great recipe.  I've never had a shallot in the house when I make it, so have used yellow and green onions instead, and the yellow is a MUCH better substitution than the green.  I also omit the butter and use fat free half and half.  If you're used to eating low fat, you won't miss it here.  I've passed this on to many and they all love it.

This is a really easy and nice soup.  Needs more salt and I added extra molasses and a little brown sugar.  The added bacon and blue cheese are essential.  I am not generally a fan of spicy foods, but the cayenne gives it just a little kick and I think adds some depth of flavor.

half and half is a mixture of half milk and half cream. It has 10-12% milkfat and cannot be whipped. In the UK I believe it is called half cream.

This soup has an incredibly delicious flavor and nice creamy texture. I'm sure it is wonderful as written, but I did have to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I was 1 cup short of chicken broth, so I used 1 cup of chai tea instead. I didn't have any shallots, so I chopped up an onion and sauteed it in the olive oil, adding the spices after the onion was nice and soft.  I let the spices cook for a minute or so, and then added the remaining ingredients, following the recipe as written. This is SO good and so easy! The leftovers are wonderful too and you can change it up to your taste. I'm just now finished eating the last cup of it which I added some cooked quinoa to. Next time I'll double the batch so I can have more leftovers! YUM!

This was very easy and totally delish!  I wanted to make it exactly as the recipe states for my first batch, but I'd like to switch out the half and half for lite coconut milk next time I make it just to see what difference it would make.  This had just the right amount of spice to it and the addition of the blue cheese crumbles and bacon as a garnish is a perfect complement to the soup's flavor and adds just a little tang to it.  I brought a sampling in for a co-worker to try.  This is yummy, high-end restaurant quality soup, perfect for a fall day and it's going right in my recipe box.

This recipe is great and a big success! I made the following changes: sauted the onions (instead of shallots as I didn't have any) in butter first, then mixed in the pumpkin and half+half. I added water+boullion (as I didn't have chicken stock) to the consistency I wanted which came to quite a bit lesser than 1 quart. Seasoned with salt and added in more bacon than called for in the soup as opposed to using the bacon as garnish. Added blue cheese at the table. Very good. Will be making it again for sure.

This is divine!  Everybody in the house LOVED the flavor, how smooth it was, the texture, everything.  I've made this on many occasions and never had a complaint but always rave reviews.  I've also skipped the bacon on occasion and added toasted nuts or toasted pepitas.  WONDERFUL recipe!!!

This is such a great twist on Pumpkin soup!  So many of them are too sweet,  but the smokiness in this one is a real treat. Plus,  anything with bacon AND molasses is bound to be a winner! :D

Please allow me to put a big caveat in front of this review.  I really wanted to try this recipe as-is, but because of the pumpkin crop issues this year I was unable to find canned pumpkin in my local grocery stores.  SO, I made a significant change: I bought two butternut squashes and split them, basted them with olive oil, and baked them face up in an inch of water with foil over the top for an hour.  I then pureed the majority of the ingredients in the blender before placing them in the pot.  I really liked the additions of blue cheese, bacon, and hot sauce, and also drizzled some scotch in to add to the recipe's deep flavor.  The richness of the flavor is very nice, and I look forward to trying it with pumpkin when supplies are again available!

This recipe is delicious... I usually make a few personal changes to recipes but this one honestly did not need any. I look forward to the Fall each year to enjoy pumpkin soup, but now that I know how to make it better than most restaurants that I've had it... I have stocked up on canned pumpkin and intend to enjoy the soup year around!  Thanks!!

My cousin made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was awesome.  Just the perfect blend of sweet and spicy.
Don't think of changing anything if you want to keep this with the perfect mix.

This was super easy and fantastic.  I did reduce the amount of cayenne due to some people in my family not liking hot spices, I also added a bit more molasses than the recipe called for.  Along with the bacon and bleu cheese I added freshly chopped chives.  Absolutely delicious!!

This soup was delish!!!!  I didn't have a shallot so I used a small yellow onion and a clove of garlic and minced them.  I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  I thought it was very creamy.  It is a keeper!!

This is yummy! It is not something that my family would normally try. However it was a hit. Half and half can be purchased in your local grocery in America. You will find it in the dairy section. It is packaged in milk cartons.
I hope that helps. I assume everyone on this sight resides in the US.

I haven't made this yet, but definitely going to try.  
But, where the spices are there is one called "pumpkin pie" spice.  It is a combination of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  I use it all the time for anything using pumpkin.

Loved it! Because just making for husband and self, used the whole can of pumpkin, substituted maple sugar for the molasses, and cut up a green onion for garnish since had one that needed to be used. Did not use hot pepper . Would definitely make again. Served with a roll and some red grapes.

Wonderful!  I didn't have shallots so I used a small amount of onion that I blended so the soup would be velvety and smooth.  So good - I will be serving this for Thanksgiving this year.  Thank you!

This was very good!  I used some frozen pumpkin I had in my freezer since Halloween.   After 30 min of cooking, I put my immersion blender in and it made it very creamy!  I didn't have any half an half, but used milk and it came out just fine.  This is a good recipe!

I will make again.  Needed to Doctor it up a little.  Heavy cream instead of half n half. Added 1 tsp of nutmeg, vanilla, and a dash of ground cloves.  Puréed after simmering.  Added shredded mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan about two handfuls, stirred into and served.  Gave options of toppings of blue cheese, bacon, shaved almonds, or craisens.

Pretty bland.... I ended up doubling the salt, adding red pepper flakes and a few tsp of pepper.

Deeeelicious!  Just the right balance in soup texture, not too thin, and not too pasty-thick.  Lovely flavor with a good blend somewhere in between sweet and savory.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I was out of plain salt, so I put in an equal amount of garlic salt instead.

I made a lot of substitutions - beef broth instead of chicken, maple syrup instead of molasses, cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice, bacon bits instead of bacon, whole milk instead of half and half.  It still turned out great.  It's probably the best pumpkin soup I've ever made.  I think the molasses/syrup is what gave it the different flavor.

Very easy to make!  I was searching for pumpkin soup recipe and chose this due to the good reviews it had, plus I had all the ingredients on hand.  Didn't want to mess with cooking down a real pumpkin.   Served it on Thanksgiving - in mini pumpkins as the bowls - a huge hit with everyone!!  Will be making again.  Thanks!

Excellent!! Used fresh pumpkin and omitted molasses and pumpkin spice and used brown sugar and garlic instead. I also made croutons. The blue cheese and bacon were an excellent addition,

Really great, easy soup! I think the blue cheese crumbles really make the soup- they are the perfect complement. And of course, everything is better with bacon! Thanks for sharing!

Very good soup with interesting flavors!  I made it with veggie broth, soy bacon and omitted the molasses.  Also added a dash curry powder.  YUM!

This was very good and easy to make.  We weren't so keen on the bacon, so the second night we substituted toasted nuts. The nuts have the same crunch as the bacon but fit the dish much better.

This is a very easy and delicious soup. I made it once as written and it turned really brown after the molasses was added. I made it again and just added a tablespoon of molasses and it was perfect. Served it with pieces of grilled "Easy Beer Bread Mix" from this site for a really perfect fall dinner.

I found this recipe, got up from the computer, and had dinner on the table in 15 minutes!  Awesome soup. I actually cut out the cayenne because of the kids but still wanted some spice, so I put a dash of chilli powder as garnish in my bowl. Also cut the fat by browning some canadian bacon. Also added brown sugar instead of molasses, and it looked very appealing. Will make on a regular basis.

I LOVE this soup and so does my family.  I made it twice this week!  I use whole milk instead of cream and my sister gave me some real maple syrup so I used that instead of molasses - FAB!!

I didn't have molasses so I used an equal amount of pure maple syrup. It was FABulous! I can't compare to how it would have been with the molasses but having read other comments I can report that the syrup didn't alter the color of the soup. I also left out the cayenne pepper, added black pepper and extra sea salt. Yum! This one's a Keeper!

Wonderful soup.   Make this even easier by using the real bacon pieces found in the salad dressing isle.
No need to change anything.

Absolutely fantastic and so easy! Just a couple of minor changes. I sauteed` the shallot in 1T. of the required butter. Added 1 tsp. garlic powder. For a little texture, I placed a couple of Tbs. of "chunky" applesauce in the bottom of soup bowl when serving the soup. This recipe is so easy and so delicious. Thank you for sharing.

This was excellent.  Definitely easy to make, and different.  I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper, and added some fresh ground black pepper because I like a little kick.  Perfect fall meal.
