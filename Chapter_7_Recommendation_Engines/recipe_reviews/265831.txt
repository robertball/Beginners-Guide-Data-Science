I  am on low sodium diet so I substituted 1 teaspoons toasted sesame oil plus one tablespoon balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce.  My family, who are nor on restricted salt intake, enjoyed it!

This turned out excellent! Left out the ginger due to personal preference. Made a similar recipe as this on the same night and this one was hands down the better recipe!
