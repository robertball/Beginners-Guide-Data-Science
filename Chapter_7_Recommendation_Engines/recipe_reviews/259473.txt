9.4.17   Oh yeah,  we liked this sausage!  I’ve tried a number of turkey sausage recipes from this site, and this recipe is so distinctly different.  Browned up nicely, super moist, and simply bursting with flavor.  First, you get a pop of sweetness from the apple and next, the maple syrup flavor kicks in.  I thought even the texture of the turkey sausage was better and closer to what you find with traditional pork sausage.  Next time, I might even give it a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes which might be an interesting contrast to the sweetness.  Lil Snoo, thanks for sharing, this one’s a keeper.

What a unique flavor! Making sausage is so easy! I ground my own turkey, using some dark meat in there. I cooked up a patty just to try it and, indeed, take care not to overcook it. I used the rest in another recipe and it was really good. The apple gives it a soft sweetness that goes very well with the rest of the ingredients. I added some Thai chilis to give it some kick. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe just needed to grate the apple a little smaller as well as make the patties a little thinner and smaller.  My wife loved them.

This came out really well, I was impressed at the flavors, but it did leave me wanting a little kick at the end. I'm on a low sodium diet, so left out the salt, but doubled down on all the spices (not the syrup) as another reviewer suggested. I also grated my apple instead of dicing it. 

I put it on a pizza, and I ended up sprinkling just a little red pepper flakes on the slice, to a superb effect.  Next time I make this, I will add the red pepper flakes directly in, or possibly just a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. 

With homemade artisan herb dough, homemade sauce, onions, peppers and fresh grated mozz my non pepperoni side was 255 calories and 105 sodium per slice!

I will definitely make this again with some changes. I think I would use dark ground turkey vs. light. I would add more spice next time, as well. Maybe more sage, some fennel, and something to spice it up a bit.

This was a nope for me. Ground turkey is processed with so much water these fell apart in the skillet.  It tasted like boiled meat with spice fruit..
