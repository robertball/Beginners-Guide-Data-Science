This came out great!  Quick and easy!  I wasn't sure what "mix" to use, I had some bisquick and some Jiffy, and used one cup of each.  Turned out great!

The few ingredients make these way too easy for as great as they taste.  Was looking for Christmas cookie recipes to use up extra kisses from my wedding reception... ended up buying more kisses to make more cookies!  The pb taste isn't over-roasted or overwhelming like most pb cookies.  Nice and sweet but not too sweet.  Don't bake them too long or the edges will separate when you press in the kiss.  They may seem doughy when you add the kiss, but after returning to the oven to melt the kiss a bit, they are just perfect!  They stayed soft and delish even days after baking, and looked cute too.

I love these cookies!  This is essentially the same recipe as on the Hershey's website, except they say to insert the chocolate when the cookies are done - not to put back in oven afterwards.  And that is how I made them.  I think the chocolate would get way too soft/melty if you put back in oven.  Using the recipe as is, I ended up with 35 cookies - of course, it depends on how big you make them - they look cuter smaller.  I prefer these with the Hershey's kisses with almonds.

This is my favorite cookie recipe of all time. They are easy to make and stay soft. They have a lighter peanut butter taste that isn't as overwhelming as most peanut butter cookies. Everyone loves them and asks me for them all the time!

Very yummy and tender.  They were so easy to just 'whip up'.  Everyone loved them.  My 4 year old requested them for their preschool party, and the teacher said they were the first cookies to go.  From now on, these are my pick for Peanut Butter Blossoms.  Do yourself a favor and try these!

Delicious!  This is the recipe a friend gave me after trying hers and thinking they were the best I ever had! I used Bisquik.  The only think I would recommend is making 2 batches. I only got 36 cookies out of mine, and since they're so good, they go quickly! Thanks for the recipe!  Enjoy!

While I loathe Hershey chocolate, these are one of my husband's favorite cookies. These were easy to make. My batch actually created >30 1-inch cookies. I won't be afraid to push in the kisses a little more next time as they keep falling out now.

One of the best peanut butter cookies out there!  So easy my 8-year-old can do it herself (minus in and out of oven).  The cookies stay nice and moist and don't harden like other peanut butter cookie recipes.  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe five times in five days. A true KEEPER!! If you haven't tried it yet, really do put them back in the oven for a minute or two, then let the whole batch cool on racks. The chocolate is so much creamier if you do it that way. Just amazing! Also, I buy the bags of already-unwrapped kisses...takes NO TIME AT ALL!!

The 5 stars are for how they turned out with my changes. 
I subbed the baking mix with:
1 3/4 cup flour,
1/4 tsp salt,
1/4 tsp baking powder, and
1/2 tsp baking soda. 
I added an extra tablespoon of peanut butter, and because my peanut butter was not at all oily, I added a tablespoon of oil. 
I skipped the chocolate. 
I rolled the dough balls in coarse sugar before baking. 
I baked them for about 7 minutes. 
Chewy. Soft. Yummy. Quick.

While these were easy to make I won't be making them again. The baking mix made the cookies taste like I added too much salt. When I took the cookies out of the oven they were sizzling like I had fried them and there was oil running down the sheet. This recipe makes 3 dozen cookies, not 2.

These were awesome!  I wasn't sure what baking mix meant, so I used pancake waffle mix that I had.  I was surprised there was no egg in this, but they were delicious and soooo easy!  I didn't have kisses on hand so I put 4 or 5 choc chips in the dent I made.  They did brown a bit on the bottom, but I think that's my ovens fault.  Will make again and again!

My family did not enjoy these cookies. I have never tasted sweetened condensed milk before, but I tried a little as I was adding it to the recipe. I didn't like the flavor at all, but stupidly I thought it would taste different once mixed in with everything else. It didn't. Not only was the flavor not to my liking, but they were so dry that almost every cookie fell apart when I tried to add the kiss on top. My advice is try the sweetened condensed milk before adding to the recipe, if you don't like the flavor then DO NOT add it! Also, some other kind of moistener is needed...maybe it would be better just to add straight whole milk in place of sweetened condensed. That seems like a good idea to me, but I haven't tried it so don't take my word for it. Just be aware that these may be easy to make, but that doesn't mean they taste good.

These come together so quickly, they are an easy addition to Christmas baking. I like to use chocolate stars instead of kisses - no unwrapping and they seem to stick to the cookie better.

These are MUCH better the second day and after.  A little dry and too salty at first, but for some reason it resolves into an excellent cookie after 24 hours.

An interesting riff on my all-time favorite recipe which calls for a full cup of Peanut butter and an egg. The fact that this recipe didn't need that egg was enough to want to try it.


 Somewhere between my organic peanut butter and our homemade "bisquick mix" (to avoid all of the junk additives), the dough was pretty crumbly by the time I beat that last cup of "mix" into it. The crumble factor was rectified easily enough simply by mooshing most of it back into the main dough by hand by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl. 


My main issue was that these cookies don't brown...? The first batch I stuck to the directions and cooked for 7 minutes, layered some melted milk chocolate (Ghiradelli chips warmed in the microwave for 30 seconds + 30 more seconds) then stuck them back in for another 2 minutes and they came out still looking light-colored and raw. The next two batches, I increased to 10 minutes and then finally to 13 minutes, and would you believe that the only part that appears darker is the bottoms where the cookies touched the pan? Each batch tastes fine, tastes cooked, and the only difference to look at them is darkness of their bottoms, go figure.

This is one of my favorite recipes that I have used for years. I like to experiment with them, sometimes I'll sub out the vanilla for coconut extract or almond extract and top with either coconut kisses or the cherry cordial kisses for a little something different.

The only thing I would suggest is NOT to put them back in the oven with the kisses on top.  The kisses will settle into the cookies without doing this step.  I had a melted mess on a couple of the cookies.

I just made these and they came out perfect! The only thing I changed was I had to use Hersheys Nuggets with almonds because that's what I had (leftover bag from Halloween)..I put half nugget into each cookie and it worked great...tastes great too. They are chewy and moist and delicious! and SO easy!I didn't see any need to put back in oven though...as long as you press the chocolate into them while still very warm out of the oven..it melts down into them perfectly. Thanks so much...will use this from now on for my family favorite beloved Peanut Blossoms! Note: they may not look as pretty this way but the almond gives them a little crunch at the last bit and a little different flavor..I like it!! Do they make kisses with almonds? will try that if they do! ;)

I added extra peanut butter but the cookies still didn't have enough peanut butter flavor for me.  While I found the recipe very simple, there is NO comparison to real peanut butter blossoms.  Recipe made about 4 dozen cookies but I used a cookie scoop.  I didn't roll in sugar like I was supposed to so I'll add a star for that.

Who would have thought that biscuit mix could make such a nice cookie.  My little tips are 1.  It is not necessary to change the recipe at all. 2.  We as bakers are used to browning our cookies, not the case with this cookie, its really not necessary.  Cook for the alotted time maybe a minute more on the choclate kiss time to 2 mins or so.  3.  I baked on a insulated cookie sheet covered with wax paper.  Kids will really  love this cookie!

I actually liked the Peanut Butter Kiss recipe better. I did not like the taste of the sweetened condensed milk and the peanut butter flavor is a little to mild. But these were extremely easy and I am sure kids at school tommorow will eat them up. This made way more than 24 cookies, luckily I had enough kisses.

Wow!  These are a snap to prepare (I used the easy biscuit mixture recipe on this site, posted by Janet) and taste delicious!  I didn't have chocolate kisses so used a chocolate chip instead.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It may have been because I used generic baking mix and generic sweetened condensed milk, but these came out awful!

These tasted really good.  I didn't roll the dough in sugar though and I might try this next time.  Thanks for the good recipe

Easiest cookies and the most delicious, soft and chewy cookies, I ever made.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I did not use the chocolate though--after rolling dough into balls and in the sugar, I flattened cookie with tines of a fork and sprinkled a little more sugar on top.  I ajusted the cooking time to 7 to 8 minutes.  I think that this is the best peanut butter cookie ever!

These cookies are absolutely fabulous.  I've read a few ratings where people didn't understand why you pop them back in the oven with the kisses for a minute or two.  That's so that the chocolate in the kisses can soften.  After you let the cookies cool down for a few minutes, try them with the soften kisses and you will be hooked for life.  My boyfriend who hates the criss-cross type peanut butter cookies was skeptical when he saw them.  After trying them, he said they were like a little piece of heaven melting in his mouth.
