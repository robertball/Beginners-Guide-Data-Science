I have to say this is by far the best recipes I have found for scallops. I read all the reviews as I always do and yes there are postive and negative always but that didn't scare me away.I think the taste is fabulous. I use jarred lemon juice a little less then 1/4 cup, I use a butter subsitite,smart butter 1/3 cup, fresh parsley I grew,and the rest of ingrediants on the list.I kept mine in the simmered marinade juice for probably 5 or more minutes and let sit in a bowl after taking them out of juice prob 20 minutes before grilling because I didnt have skewers and hub went to the store to get them. I then reheated remaining marinade adding more butter and little more onion heated for another 5 to 10 min on simmer. Grilled the scallop on the grill 4 or so mins realizing they were sticking so I placed them in a disposable grill metal pan, and cooked a total of 8 more mins . They were absolutely perfect.I tested for doneness making sure white and right texture.I served mine over steamed white rice placed scallops on top poured on marinade that had simmered and a side of garlic broccoli. My  hub ravved saying how good these were, better than a resturaunt and alot more of it. We used large sea scallops btw.Enjoy :)

This recipe was simply amazing and everyone loved it.  It's simple enough to prepare, and tastes like you put a lot into it.I served with a loaf of french bread to soak up the leftover marinade.  

Instead of skewering the scallops and risking losing the smaller pieces, we put them in a double-sided grate with a handle on it.  It makes it easier to turn them, and uses much less time than skewering.

These were pretty good. I probably wouldn't make them again because they taste much like pan fried scallops in butter, therefore there was too much work to get that simple taste.

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The marinade left a distinct aftertaste.  Possibly too much lemon juice or onions.  Not quite sure what could improve this.  We will not try this again.

I was very disappointed by this recipe, and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  My scallops were large frozen sea scallops from Sam's.  I thawed them but they were still cold.  So when they combined with the butter mixture, it all congealed.  Kinda gross.  Then when they went into my grill basket and onto the grill, the butter melted off causing flare ups. The flavor was uninspiring and bland.  I was really disappointed.

This recipe was wonderful. I did need to grill them a little longer than the recipe called for, but other than that it was perfect. Because I had it in my garden, I added some fresh dill rather than the parsley and I also used a little less lemon that it called for, but that was just a perference thing.

Didn't have fresh onions or garlic, so I used onion powder and roasted garlic from a jar.  Also used bottled parsley.  IT CAME OUT GREAT!  I used it for shrimp also which were actually even better.  Will use this again soon!

Excellent!!! I even used this sauce over asparagus. The only thing I altered from this recipe is that I use clarified butter.

This is fantastic!  I used a Weber fish grill pan, so it was easy to prepare and the sea scallops got great grill marks but were moist and juicy.  I used jarred chopped garlic, about 3 heaping tbsp....and put the lemon juice and fresh parsley directly on the scallops while the seasoned butter was melting....yum!!

This recipe is excellent.  I read the reviews and mmade some changes to the recipe by decreasing the lemon and onions to half of what was suggested.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh basil.  Using the grilling basket, these came out perfect.  This one is a keeper.  (I usually don't take the time to rate these recipes, but this one deserved my time and the 5 stars.)

A great way to grill scallops.  The recipe is simple to follow and easy to adjust for larger or smaller portions.  We thought it really highlighted the fresh flavor or the scallops, and will be making this again!

These were pretty good, a little "oniony" will probably cut back on the onion next time and add a little more garlic, but no complaints, will make again!

This was perfect just the way the recipe is written. It calls for fresh Parsley, but does not tell you were to add the parsley in the recipe.  I added it with the lemon juice and salt and was delicious. Used Skewers. My husband and I loved it with "Foiled Wrapped Veggies" by Marni. Will def. make again and again.  Thanks!

I love scallops, and this recipe is very easy to make. I agree with some of the other reviewers as to the lack of flavor. I always believe in making a recipe exactly the way it is written for the first time and now I can make it my own. Next time I am going to replace the parsley with fresh basil, I believe that the lemon and basil will add a nice touch to the scallops. I will update as soon as scallops are on sale again.

I thought this was quite good, I think perhaps the reviewers who didn't enjoy it as much may have used wet scallops rather than dry.  We do not have ready access to dry scallops so when we find them I buy them.  Wet scallops are treated with a preservative that can give a chemical aftertaste,  I have read articles that say you can mask it in various ways but all are unsatisfactory.  Ask your market if they are wet or dry, they should know!

Excellent and simple. We enhanced the butter mixture after assembling the skewers, by reducing white wine in the pan and putting the butter mixture back in and reduced some more.... and then salt and pepper and the fresh parsley at the very end... it made a wonderful sauce and we served over rice! (for the skewers, we used red onion, green and orange peppers between the scallops) Thanks you for a GREAT recipe!

Loved this recipe!  Made one slight change and was to use a blender to grind the onion and garlic finer.

Hubby and youngest daughter loved this. I'm not a scallop fan, so my opinion doesn't count. I did add more seasonings tho, but other than that, the two of them thought this was perfect. I normally either broil or pan fry my scallops, so they particularly enjoyed the smokey flavor the grilling process added. Thank you Mainjump!!

We were not thrilled with this recipe.  I think there was just too much lemon for our taste.  I will try again using a couple of tablespoons of sherry instead of lemon.

There aren't many scallop skewer recipes on this site so used this as a starting point.  I didn't add fresh onion, just onion powder and omitted the parsley. I added fish rub and Cajun rub to the marinade mix for another layer of flavor. I also marinated some mushrooms in Ital dressing for an hour and added to the skewers.  I kept spraying with Pam during grilling on low heat.  Finished off by brushing with melted butter and Old Bay seasoning after grilling.

These have no taste!  I'm glad so many ppl found this a great recipe, but I feel like I wasted 1 1/2 lbs of scallops, will not make again.  I had to add a bunch of Old Bay to eat them:-(

The scallops were tasty, HOWEVER, no where in the directions did the recipe tell me when to add/use the parsley.  I read and re-read it several times and it doesn't give the proper directions.

I didn't grill the scallops, I fried them in a pan, but we thought the marinade/saus was pretty good.

It was OK but not great.  The recipe says to return the butter sauce to the pan but even though I only used 1 lb. of scallops there was no sauce left to return.

I really enjoyed this dish.  However, it calls for Parsley at the beginning but never does say what to do with it in the instructions.

Excellent and easy. I was a little nervous about the onions. But cooking in the butter took the sharp edge away. Served this over pasta with the extra marinade stirred in. Really good.

My family loved it.  I did use just a bit less onion.  I served it over rice pilaf and put some of the sauce over it, it mixed together beautifully.   My family already wants me to make it again.

Used a grill pad. Followed closely except didn’t have fresh garlic. Some apple wood smoke. Using the pad left nice grill marks with no sticking.

I made this for a party we were having and added shrimp. I used a basket with a lid and was able to turn it as it was cooking. The butter with seasonings made it very flavorful and rich. Everyone loved it. I added it to Pinterest to share with my friends.

Getting ready to make and don't know how much onion to get or how to prepare the onion.  The recipe references onions in the instructions but they're not listed in ingredients.  I'm a lousy cook, so I hate to wing anything ESPECIALLY expensive scallops.
