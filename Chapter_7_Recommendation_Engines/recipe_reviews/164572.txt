Very moist cake. Good even without glaze! I used apple cider instead of orange juice in the cake and the glaze to give it more apple flavor. Also cut cinnamon to 1 tablespooon - that was plenty! Will add nuts to the apple mixture next time. And maybe a dash of nutmeg.

Yummy!  I have made this 2x in the past 2 weeks - first time according to recipe (except I cut bake time down to 1 hour), 2nd time I substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil.  Second time, I made this in the Perfect brownie pan (one that makes the individual brownies as it bakes).  I cut the time down to 45 minutes as the metal is touching more sides.  Great for treating people at work this way!

Very moist and a great cinnamon taste throughout but not overbearing. I would use the glaze, it adds to the favor of the cake. Great for church events, family events and more. A real keeper. I would back off the time, just a bit, but our over runs hot.

Yum!  Used  apple cider vs. OJ as recommended.  Glazed after it cooled & removed fr the bundt pan.  Will probably use loaf pans next time & glaze while hot.  This is an excellent/hardy cake.  Very nice for brunch or dessert!

This cake was good but not to-die-for. I think, however, that was mainly due to over baking. You do NOT need an hour and 25 mins. This makes the crust rock hard and it doesn't absorb the glaze. I think if it was baked an hour and absorbed the glaze it would be a lot moister. I'll give it another shot and try that next time, but if that doesn't wow me, I'll be moving on.

I have made several Jewish Apple Cakes over the years and found this one to be dry, lacking in flavor and poor in texture.  The lack of flavor along with the glaze made the cake overly sweet.

I just made this cake today and HAD to taste it before it even cooled off much. It is just yummy! I only used 1T of cinnamon. It was just right. Can't wait to share some with friends, it's too much for just the two of us! Thanks!

Wow I'm not sure what I did wrong and I love to bake. Someone had given me a bunch of apples leftover from a health fair and I thought i would try this...had to throw it away because it was dry and way too sweet for my taste and my family.

Moist cake the topping after it's baked is a great idea. I didn't change the recipe at all but do feel the apples do not need 2 tbls of cinnamin

The recipe works out great, but if you want to kick it up a notch, drizzle a little brandy or rum sauce over the top. I used 5 tablespoons of apple brandy, quarter cup confectioners' sugar and quarter cup butter. Melted this together in the microwave and brushed this over the sides & poured it all over the top. It had a great flavor and really made for a very moist cake.

Very good cake. My family really enjoyed it. I think next time I might add more apples. There didn't seem to be enough for me. Other than that it was great.

Our whole family loved this cake. It is a wonderful choice for fall. We did not want to wait to eat it so we tried to get it out of the pan before it was cool...bad idea. Wait until it is cool or it will fall apart. Tasted just as good to us though.

This was wonderful, my husband and mother-in-law don't like cooked apples and loved this recipe. Made it for Yom Kippur. I cut the sugar in half in each step. Wasn't too sweet. Followed the rest of the recipe, except cooked for one hour total. Used the glaze. Will make again.

A great recipe that brought back fond memories.  My Mom made this cake for us all the time when we were growing up and used the same recipe.  She never iced it with anything, and when I used this receipt to make the cake recently, I  served it plain just the way my Mom used to.  It was perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

The cake is delicious. I don't know if it was in there for a full 1 hour and 25 minutes. I baked to an hour and checked it every 10 minutes afterwards. I also did 3 layers of apples instead of the suggested 1 as I wanted the apples more distributed. Only reason I bumped it down a star is because of the glaze used. I should have just done orange juice and powdered sugar as some of the comments state. Delicious cake though. I'll be making this one again with a different glaze.

I did not add the glaze, didn't want or need the extra calories as the recipe already has 2 cups of sugar and a cup of oil but I found the cake to be on the dry side.Maybe if the apples had been stirred throughout the batter rather than just in the middle. Maybe a 1/2 cup of added applesauce would have been a good addition for moisture.
