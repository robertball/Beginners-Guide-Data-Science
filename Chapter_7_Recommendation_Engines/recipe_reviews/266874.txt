Super easy to make with excellent results. The simplicity of making this will make you want to make  it often! It is rather crumbly and very reminiscent of shortbread. I topped it with whipped cream but found that it is not necessary. If in a pinch for a dessert, this is one to keep in mind.

No changes. Yes I would make it again. I had lots of left over egg yolks and this was a nice, easy recipe to use them up.
