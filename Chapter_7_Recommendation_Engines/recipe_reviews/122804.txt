These are amazing! I scaled down the servings to twelve, and used melted butter instead of the oil for more flavor. I also used 2 cans of refrigerated breadsticks instead of the biscuits because I like their texture and fluffiness better. I then stretched them out and twirled two sticks together to make a pretty knot. After baking them, I spread on the mixture with a pastry brush and topped off with a light dusting of additional parmesan cheese. Amazing flavor! These are now my go to breadsticks for all of my Italian dishes. Thanks!

Chopped about 2 cloves of garlic and tossed in a small bowl with about 2 tblsp. butter, threw that in the microwave for 30 seconds or so... Added some parm and garlic & herb seasoning and brushed on top as soon as they came out of the oven. So quick, easy and most importantly DELICIOUS!

These were delicious.  I used the same seasonings as the recipe but opted for butter instead of oil.  In addition, I used crescent rolls.  I love the taste of crescent rolls and decided to try those over biscuits.  I just took one triangle of the crescent roll, rolled it until it was about 8 inches long, knotted and cooked on 400 for 6-10 minutes.  Immediately after taking the knots out of the oven I brushed the butter/seasoning mixture over the knots.  Delicious.

VERY good soft chewy parmesan knots - I recommend using FRESH garlic and good quality butter...really picks up the flavour.

These are excellent, just like the Italian Restuarant Garlic knots. I found the larger buttermilk buscuits like the GRANDS make fabulous fat little knots. cut them in half roll out and tie a loose knot.  If you use the thinner refrigerated rolls use the whole biscuit rolled out. Cut in halfs are too small. I  brushed them several times, they were to die for and so easy. Everyone thinks they are so much work. WOW~~ Great for pot lucks. Very impressive!!!

AMAZING!!! Absolutely delicious!! I only made one package worth of biscuits (which made 16 knots). I did opt for olive oil rather than butter like other reviewers suggested, and I thought they were magnificent as is. This will be my new go-to recipe for dinner rolls!!!

So easy and yummy. I used Italian Seasoning in place of the oregano and parsley and butter in place of oil. Served them a pizza sauce used for dipping and what a simple finger food for a party. Thank you for the recipe. I will make this again and again. And kids love them too!!

Made a batch for a dinner party.  I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil as suggested in other reviews.  I also didn't bother "knotting" the bread, just made regular biscuit and crescents and brushed the mixture on top.  I've never seen people so excited about bread, and it was so incredibly easy- I'll definitely be making it again.

Incredibly easy with the appearance that it required more effort.  My husband loved these & was impressed that I had the time to make these for dinner on a work night.  Little did he know.

As with other reviewers I am going to recommend butter and not veggie oil.  I am also going to recommend only 1 tsp of oregano if you are using ground oregano (vs. flakes).  And rather than adding the the parmesan chees to the butter mix I would sprinkel it on the knots after you have bushed on the butter mixtur.  Clean up is easier and the cheese doesn't get clumpped up in the nooks of the knot.

I used basil instead of oregano bec thats all I had. I also added garlic and used butter as others have suggested. This had a great taste and goes well with spagetti, soups or salads.

i gave this a 4 star rating because i didn't follow the exact directions. i put my knots in a muffin tin since it was all i had to use at the time. i brushed the knots with melted butter instead of oil with the spices mixed in. i also used half parm and half asiago cheese. used fresh chopped garlic too. these were a big hit and i only got one bite before they all disappeared! thanks cathy for a easy, great tasting recipe. the finished product didn't taste like canned biscuits at all! i will keep this one in my recipe box for sure.

These were DELICIOUS! I changed a few things because of what I had. I used crescent rolls instead of biscuits. And I used butter instead of oil. And I used italian seasoning too. These came out great. Buttery, flaky, and super flavorful. I think next time, I will make the knots a bit smaller and leave them in the oven for longer. But I definitely will be making these again!

This will do for us in a pinch, but it tasted too canned biscuity. I would much rather make the dough from scratch. Does anyone know of a good scratch recipe for parmesan knots?

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome !!  I will tell you this.. I will never be without Grand Buttermilk Biscuits in my fridge !!  These bowled everyone over on Thanksgiving and will remain on our table evermore...  
I made one small change in that we are not fans of Oregano so I omitted that and used Basil in place of it and they were wonderful.  Recipe can be changed up too which is great !  You can make just garlic knots by omitting the parmesan or you can do cheddar knots by using fancy shredded cheddar cheese in the oil mix.  The other thing I did differently is instead of waiting for them to come out of the oven to baste and serve I pull them out of the oven when the last two minutes are left and baste them then put them back in the oven for the last two minutes so it glazes and seats into the knots.  Thank you Cathy for sharing this wonderful recipe !!!  It deserves a 10

I made it my way and got wow reviews, but appreciate the recipe for getting me started. Used premade pizza dough. Rolled dough to 1/4" thin, then cut into 1" by 6" strips which I tied into knots.  Baked as directed on preheated pizza stone until done, then brushed with hot butter mixture. Last, I sprinkled with the parmesan cheese. 
Used 1 stick butter, crushed garlic and other herbs to make brushing mixture.  Microwaved for 20 – 30 seconds to melt better and blend flavors.
My failed attempts to perfect:
 Tried one batch using butter mixture before baking, then basting again after finished. No difference in taste with extra mixture and probably a waste of calories.
Tried one batch brushing 2 minutes before finishing. No difference to final taste and a bit of hassle to baste while in oven.
Tried one batch with Kraft grated parmesan and one with fresh grated parmesan. Call me crazy but the fine mixture of the Kraft parmesan actually covered more area so I liked it better. Save the good Parm for your pasta dinner.

Very easy to prepare, and everyone loved them! The  few changes I made were using 2 cans of Grands Home style biscuits (We didn't need three), and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also thought that 450F was too high a temperature, so I baked the biscuits at 375F for about 9 minutes. I can't wait to make these for family gatherings!

I make these all the time now. I have changed over from oil to just butter. It is still good with it that way. Oil just seems more fattening to me.

So simple and yummy; looks and tastes like something that took far more time and thought.  A great stand-by bread side.

Sooooo good! I used the store brand jumbo flaky refrigerated biscuits (in the can) and I loved the outcome! All I had was shredded Parmesan and I didn't feel like getting the food processor out to make it into grated parm cheese but it worked really well. Also 1/2 c oil was the perfect amount for 3 cans of 8 biscuits. It's a little time consuming rolling each biscuit half if you're doing a big batch like I did but it was worth it. Will definitely make again!

These are excellent.  I got this receipe from Pillsbury.  They call for their breadsticks but I am sure these are just as good.  I had to leave them oven a little longer because they took longer to brown.  Their receipe also called for fresh garlic.  I could have eatten them all!

Wow, these were super good! They are so quick to make up and they really do taste homemade. I thought they tasted more like a roll. I wouldn't have known it was a biscuit. They are so tasty, they even taste good the next day. The only thing I did was change the servings to 20 with the calculate button, so I could use just 1 can to test the recipe. They really do remind me of something from an upscale pizza eatery. TY

So simple yet fancy! I used butter instead of oil like many suggested. Next time I'll try a different kind of bread like some people did. It's a nice alternative to the normal garlic bread when having pasta!

WOW, these rolls were GREAT!!  They required very minimal effort (woo-hoo!) and resulted with amazing flavor!!  I scaled down the recipe to 20 because I was just making them for me and the hubs.  I also used fresh garlic, melted butter instead of oil, and 1 can of refrigerated dinner rolls instead of biscuits...(the grocery store was in the middle of restocking the shelves, and I was being impatient lol).    I made about 10 larger sized knots.  Next time I might try the biscuit dough, but I think they are perfect with the dinner roll dough :~)

These were very tasty. I couldn't manage to roll them and knot them as directed, so after the first attempt I just left the biscuits whole. I also used olive oil, and would do that again. There is another recipe on here (Savory Biscuits) that I like better because it has dill, so I'd add dill to this one next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I cut this down to ten servings, which used half a container of biscuits and made ten "knots". I used melted butter (I'm out of oil right now) and doubled the spices only because when you cut the recipe down, it dosen't come out to be a whole lot of spices. These went really well with my Zuppa Toscana. I'd make these again.

Tasty! I scaled the recipe all the way down to half a tube of rolls. I think I would like to try it with crescent rolls next time, as I tend to like the flavor of those better. Thanks :)

The cans of biscuits are only 7.5 so the rolls were very small. Maybe it would be better not to cut them in half.

I thought the original recipe was good (I used it on the first half) but it was excellent when I added some extra garlic to it.  I tossed everything together when it was warm.

Really easy to make.  I used the inexpensive buttermilk roll option.  I also made them into hearts for Valentine's Day - bit hit.  Did I mention how easy they are?!!

For some reason, mine burned on the bottom.  Not sure if the temp is too high or what since no one else complained of that in the reviews I read.  But the flavor was great and we still really liked them, so I'll definitely try them again.  Cute way of making rolls, something different.

Delicious! I used olive oil which I think is the best idea. Didn't have the specific herbs, so I just used dried Italian seasoning blend. These are delightfully chewy and full of flavor!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and used melted butter instead of oil, only used one can of biscuits (8) and since they were on the small side I did not cut each biscuit in half. These were VERY good with a bowl of minestrone soup!!

This morning, I made this 2 different ways. I mixed in a bowl some splenda and some cinnamon and a tab of orange peel. After it got cooked, I sprayed with butter flavored crisco and sprinkled this on. This might work well with instant coffee. I did the parmesan one with grape seed oil. worked out great.

I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and I would bake at 400 degrees.  450 is too hot--the bottoms burn.  These are cute bite sized with a good flavor.

So good and easy! Very flavorful, I forgot to cut biscuits in half, so they were larger, but still so wonderful! I brushed a small amount on before baking and then again right out of the oven. Will be making this again and again!

These were okay but they need more flavor.  Next time I would definitely use butter and more garlic.  I will try them with the crescents too - prefer the flavor of those.

Good! I reduced the recipe to use one can of biscuits. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable because it felt right to me. I had to roll my dough a littel longer than 6 inches to get enough rope to make a knot - but that might be because I'm uncoordinated. Thanks for the recipe!

THIS RECIPE WAS AWESOME!! I SCALED THE SERVINGS DOWN BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST 2 OF US.  PER OTHER REVIEWERS I USED BUTTER INSTEAD OF OLIVE OIL AND I USED PILLSBURY BREADSTICKS.  I STRETCHED 2 STICKS OUT, GAVE THEM A COUPLE OF TWISTS AND TIED IN A LOOSE NOT.  USE FRESH MINCED GARLIC IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE!!

Yumm-o!!  My family loved 'em, kids gobbled these up and so did hubby!  I made similar modifications as other reviews... used melted butter instead of oil and added fresh minced garlic.  Brushed that on when they came out of the oven and then sprinkled with some freshly grated parm and dried basil.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed some other reviewers advice and used butter instead of oil and fresh garlic instead of powdered, and they were just heavenly!  I love the fact they're so small too, doesn't make me feel bad going for seconds or even thirds!

We really liked these.  It was hard to stop eating them.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 c. melted butter in place of the oil, and I scaled down the recipe since I only had one tube of biscuits.  Will definitely make these again.

I used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil and they were good.  I like basil more than oregano, so used that instead.  The biscuits came out tiny--like appetizers, which was fine with me.  The oil mixture was not quite enough for two cans of the biscuits, so maybe next time I will brush it on instead of rolling them in it!  They certainly are fast and easy.

My kids thought I'd found the secret recipe to the breadsticks at Olive Garden.  They were delicious but I am sad that we filled up on the bread instead of our supper.  ;)

As written, meh. Too much fake biscuit taste, not enough natural flavor. If I made it again, I'd defrost a 1-pound package of frozen pizza dough (or make it myself), divide it into 16 pieces, substitute extra-virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil, swap 4 cloves of minced and crushed garlic for the garlic powder, and use freshly grated parmesan cheese for the tasteless canned variety, but that would be a completely different recipe.

AWESOME! Used butter instead of the oil and used French bread from the bakery that we had leftover from the previous nights dinner - just spread it on the bread, threw it in the oven and warmed it up  - soooo yummy!

These are AWESOME and EASY!!!!!! I used only one can of biscuits and the whole family devoured them! They were good hot, but also good when they cooled off a bit. The kids enjoyed making the knots.

Quick and easy recipe.  I mistakenly used pre-made crescent roll dough to make these and I would advise against because their butter flavor was too overpowering.  Will make again!

I hate to be the "critic" here, but I was not all that impressed with this recipe. I've seen similar "knots" at Fresh Market (FM is very similar to a Whole Foods store, for those of you who have not heard of the chain) and thought to myself, "I can make these at home WAAAAY cheaper." Yes, that's true, but do they taste as good... NO!!! Preparation couldn't have been any easier, though. I ended up purchasing a small tube of large (i.e. Grand's) biscuits. There were a total of 5 biscuits, so after halving each, I ended up with 10 knots. Although my fiance enjoyed these (he had 7 of them!), he suggested that doubling the oil/cheese/herb mixture might have made these better (there was barely enough mixture to spread on what I had, so I see his point). Besides being dry, I also thought these were quite bland. For that reason, I am not sure that doubling up on the topping would make a difference (?). Overall, this was a nice idea, but not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. Thanks for sharing your idea anyways, Cathy :) A lot of reviewers seem to like these!

This was delicious!  The family really loved it!  I added a bit more garlic and used butter instead of oil.  When I use this again I think I may try it with crescent rolls or breadsticks.

Yummy!  I'd give it a 4 1/2 but they don't allow it!  I had to scale down the recipe to 20 servings so I only had to use 1 can of biscuits.  The only change I did was I brushed melted butter on them before baking.

The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was that it turned out when i went to make it I was missing the main ingredient (parmesan cheese - I was so sure I had some) but they still turned out fairly awesome. I used butter with some minced garlic and dried oregano. I'm sure the cheese would've made these 5 stars for sure and I will make them again now that I've bought it.

Tasted like a whole lot of biscuit with a dash of everything else... I suppose that shouldn't be suprising if you bake biscuits and then brush things on instead of it being in the dough. Wasn't impressed.

Very tasty and easy!  I did only use one package and didn't half the biscuits because I wanted more of a dinner roll. I baked them according to the wrapper at 350 degrees. It took a little longer, but I was afraid of burning them.  Once they came out of the oven, I brushed them with melted butter, sprinkled on the garlic powder, parmesan cheese, parsley and oregano.  I choose this method because it seemed like a lot less work and mess.

These were good.  I used crescent rolls instead of buscuits.  I have had a can in my fridge for months not knowing what to do with them.  The flavor was good.  I did use fresh parsley as I didn't have any dried.  That worked fine.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  I used 2 smaller cans of biscuits (the 7.5 oz ones)  and didn't split them in 1/2 to roll.  I split the recipe in 1/2 then to cover my 20 biscuits.  Very good addition to a simple Easter meal! Thanks for the recipe.

This has become a family favorite- something a little different from french bread or croissant rolls. I might try brushing them with butter next time. the oil mixture tends to make the tops a little soggy after a while.

I'm not sure that they were particularly memorable, but they were tasty, and really, really quick and easy to prepare (especially since I didn't even make knots--I just plunked the biscuit dough down like normal).  It's a great alternative to garlic bread--faster than buttering and seasoning all of those slices and a bit cheaper too.  It's nice to do something different with pasta meals.  Someone did ask me where I got them, so they must have been alright!

Awesome recipe and so easy.  The only thing I changed was to use pillsbury breadsticks instead and made those into knots.  I will be making these again real soon.

These are good but need some work. Next time I will definitely use melted butter instead of all of that oil and try it without the parmesan (hubby doesn't like it) and much more garlic!

Sooooo easy & very good!  I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder & olive oil.  I may try butter next time, as some reviews suggested.  They freeze really well, so it's very easy to grab just a few & pop them in the oven for a minute to warm them!

I made these with dinner and they were excellant!  I added a dash of garlic salt after we brused the parmesan mixture on and sprinkled with a little extra parmesan and they were gone in seconds!  Thank you Cathy for a wonderful recipe!

Very basic recipe with a great tasting result, although the garlic seasoning could be stronger.  Otherwise a keeper and go to recipe!

Super easy and tastes great.  Next time I will substitute melted butter for the oil, just to see how it differs.

Nice way to jazz up plain old buttermilk bread sticks!  I brushed on half the mixture before baking and the rest half way through.

In a word, fantastic! I too, used butter insted of oil and added some minced garlic. I scaled the recipe back for 1 can of buscuits. Instead of brushing the tops, i just threw the hot knots into the bowl of parmesan mixture, stirred it a bit and then placed the knots on a serving dish for a beautiful and delicious appetizer. Thank you for this great recipe!

Best bread to compliment any meal. My kids know the recipe and make the knots while I finish dinner. A++
Followed recipe exactly, just a little extra minced garlic with the parmesian

These are fantastic! I scaled it down to using 1 package of biscuits. I also used margarine (no-salt) and real garlic. I just melted the margarine in the microwave with the oregano and garlic, then added the parmesan. Came out perfect and we could not stop eating them. They were so quick and easy I don't see how we won't be making them on a regualr basis. I will try to make it with my own dough sometime.

So good! Made these as a quick addition to a soup lunch. You'd never know something this tasty is so quick and easy.

I used italian seasoning instead of oregano.

Not sure why you'd need make these ahead and freeze, they are so easy!

Excellent recipe!  I used 5 small cans of biscuits (7.5oz), which didn't require cutting the biscuits in half - saved some time.  I will freeze these & serve them at a party next week.

Very easy and pretty good. These were good to make when I didn't have time to make rolls or bread from scratch, and I needed a roll quickly.

These were tasty and very easy to make. They are definitely best served immediately, as the leftovers became just "okay." (but that's the case with just about any refrigerator biscuit) I'm anxious to try these next with frozen bread dough.

These were great! I think they would have been even tastier had I used butter rather than oil, but they were fantastic! I might toss the oil mixture with oyster crackers and broil for a minute to make zesty oyster crackers!

These little Parmesan Knots are absolutely wonderful!!  Be sure to make the full recipe, as you will not be able to keep them around.  I made them for a Christmas party, however we never left the house with them - my hubby and kids ate THEM ALL before we left.  Fun to make and fun to eat.  The only change I made was adding fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!
