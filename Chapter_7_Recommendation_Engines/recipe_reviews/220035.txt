Used a London Broil. YummO. It fell apart. Melt in your mouth. Cheaper cut of meat, but just as good. Also, added noodles to crockpot last hour which gave the noodles more flavor than just cooking them. Had to add a little beef broth when I added the noodles. Hubby even liked..and he is not a big beef stroganoff fan. He said..yes..make this again.

This was good (very basic, great base) as is, but also good and easy to customize. We made a few changes this time. We actually used ground beef to make it more appealing to our three-year-old. Browned the ground beef with water, worcestershire sauce, garlic, onions, pepper, and mushrooms in the crock pot for about 2.5 hours on high. Skimmed off about half the fat, then added the two cans of soup. Cooked about 2.5 additional hours o  low, then added sour cream and 4oz of cream cheese. Very tasty!

Incorporated many of the noted comments when making this recipe.  Used french onion soup instead of cream of mushroom etc.  When I added the sour cream I also added 1 cup of instant potato flakes.  This made it nice and thick. My family loved it.

I make this recipe with quite a few changes.  I use Golden Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Mushroom.  I use stew meat which just makes it easier.  Instead of the onions, I use 1/2 package of dry onion soup mix with 1/2 cup of water instead of 1/4. I only use 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire, but add 1 tsp. of beef bouillon, and in addition to the sliced mushrooms add 8 oz. of whole button mushrooms, adding the mushrooms the last hour.  Instead of the sour cream at the end, I add 4 oz. of cream cheese, but add a dollop of sour cream to each serving.  WOW....guess I should have just submitted my own recipe.

Very good and very easy. I also used stew meat instead of a roast to save on time and was very happy with it.

Although we enjoyed this dish, it turned out rather watery. I don't understand why, but a bit thicker would have made it nicer.

One of my favorites.  However I use a cheap Burgandy in place of the water.  I also use the stew meat as a less expensive option since whatever you use will break down and be tender.  The wine really gives it a nice flavor.

I thought this was decent, but not as good as I'd hoped. I made it almost exactly as written, the only changes being that I had less bottom round on hand (about 1.5 pounds), and my noodles were no-yolk extra-wide egg noodles. I like onions, but I found the coarsely chopped onions to be a bit out of place here. I did follow the "recipe tip" to brown the steak beforehand, and I think it probably made a big difference. It was worth trying, but I'll probably move on to another stroganoff recipe.

I've never made stroganoff in a crock pot, but wanted to give it a try to avoid standing over a hot stove in the 90+ summer nights. The sauce was very watery and I had to add in more sour cream to try and thicken it to the traditional stroganoff sauce thickness. It was still a bit on the thin side but okay if served over noodles. Every one still liked it, but all did agree my stove top is much better.

I made a few changes to this because I only used items that I already had on hand to avoid a trip to the store and save a few dollars. I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken and 1 can of Cream of Mushroom, no water (the sauce thinned out enough without it)and I doubled the Worcestershire sauce. I omitted the mushrooms, replaced the sour cream with non fat plain Greek yogurt, added 1/8 cup unsalted butter and only used 1 onion (3 seemed a bit excessive to me). I used stew meat since it is much cheaper and I seasoned with garlic and a grilled beef seasoning (I used Daddy Hinkle's but Montreal Steak or similar would be just as good).

I agree with some of the reviewers that the sauce was thin but I just combined the sauce with the noodles and served it instead of each person topping their noodles with the sauce. My kids devoured it and even my picky husband got seconds. This meal is going into my dinner rotation. Next time I will use a bit more seasoning but I don't think I will change any of the adjustments I made.

So easy and delicious! But to make it a bit lighter, I use Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup and low fat sour cream. (You won't miss all the sodium and fat, I promise!) I also use beef broth in place of the water called for and I add paprika. Though I love onions, 3 seemed a bit much, so I used one large onion and it was perfect! I did dust the meat with corn starch and sear before adding to the crock pot and it held its flavor while ending up fork tender. I cooked on high for one hour and low for five and it was perfection! One note to those who like to use wine in their cooking (and I'm one of them!), please don't use a cheap wine as one reviewer suggested. Never cook with a wine that you wouldn't enjoy drinking out of a glass. It will make all the difference in your finished dish.

I followed the recipe pretty much as is. I used 1 family sized can of cream of mushroom soup and used leeks instead of onions due to an allergy to cooked onions. I also used beef already cut up for stir fry to cut down on time and effort. It turned out fairly good. It was a bit bland though, and my husband said the meat had lost it's 'beef' taste, so maybe it didn't need to be cooked as long. It was done after only 6 hours. My hubby suggested I use the same recipe using a whole roast and a little more spices and thicken it with flour as I could not get it very thick with the sour cream, even with almost a full 16oz. I think flouring the meat and searing it might also help with the flavor and thickening. I will try it again as it is very easy, just needs tweaking.

We really liked this.  My store had beef cut for stir-fry, although it would have been a bit thick for that, it was perfect for this recipe.  I may have put in a bit too much water trying to rinse out the soup cans, so when I needed more thickening than the sour cream I had on hand, I added low fat greek yogurt.  Great and plenty of leftovers.  Next time I'll halve the recipe.

This turned out really good.. I didn't add the Worcestershire cause I didn't have any on hand. I also added about 2 cups of beef broth and a half can more of cream of mushroom soup when I added the noodles to the last hour and it was perfect ?? much better then putting the sauce on top of cooked noodles.. Will definitely make again!

I would like to suggest adding 2 tablespoons of tomato paste  and a teaspoon of mustard powder to the recipe as written. If wine is added in place of water(good idea,) it should be a dry white wine, if you use red, it becomes a cross between Stroganoff and Beef Burgundy which might taste good too, but I've never tried crossing the two, each has its own excellent flavor.  The beef will be easier to slice thin if it is partially frozen, and will also be more tender (with less cooking time) if cut cross grain.  I agree, the beef should be browned before adding to the pot, how about deglazing the skillet with the wine to get all the flavor?

It is very easy using crock pot .  My husband said it is very bran so next day I added Marjoram, cayenne pepper, Hungarian paprika, caraway seeds, and a few other spices according to Chef John's Hungarian goulash recipe.  It turned out much tastier.  I served with Montana factory home made  egg noodle that I brought from my trip to Poulson, Mt.

This was ok, but a little bland and very runny.  I followed the recipe as written except used precut beef stew meat and 12oz of frozen mushrooms since that is what I hand on hand.  I tried to thicken it up by using 2tbsp of corn starch and water, but it was still on the runny side for me.

I made this using the ingredients and amounts listed.  The only thing I changed was cooking time.  I didn't have 8-10 hours so I put the crock pot on high for 4 hours and it came out great.  Will make again.

Very good but seemed slightly too rich although may have just been my taste buds at the time. Followed directions exactly. Family loved it.  I will make again.

Made this for dinner tonight and even the picky 3yr old asked for seconds. The only alteration I made was to coat the meat in a bit of flour and brown it. This is an easy delicious meal the whole family can enjoy.

This was so good....simply delicious.  Instead of using onion, I used 1 pack of onion soup mix.  I left out the garlic and I used a 4 oz. can of mushrooms.  I will make this over and over again because beef stroganoff is my husband's favorite dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It was very easy to make; however my family did not like the taste that the sour cream added.  If I make this again I will omit the sour cream.

I used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup and one large onion. Also lightly seasoned the meat as well  because i read some of the reviews and they stated it was bland . The flavors were off n it tasted oniony for a lack of better words. We really didn't enjoy this recipe

We loved this.  I used beef bottom roast and cut in thin strips.  Also, I added two cups of sour cream after turning the slow cooker off.  Was thicker and rich and wonderful.  Especially great recipe for busy days.  Put it on in the morning and walk in at dinner time and it's ready!

pretty good - certainly easy, but lacks a little tasty.  maybe add paprika and some garlic salt or Mrs. Dash.

This wasn't bad for as easy as it was.  Not as good as if I made it on the stove but it was much easier.  The texture was a bit odd and I'm not sure why.  I left out the water because other reviews said it was runny.  And I made my own cream of mushroom that was gluten free. 
I might make it again but I would leave the onions out next time as onions in a slow cooker get very sweet and I think it kind of throws off this.

I loved it! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and it came out just amazing. Also, I cooked meat for 6 hours, and added green peas with cooked carrots on the side. Everybody loved it!
