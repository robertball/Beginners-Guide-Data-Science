I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving for my 12 guests and everyone raved about it. I thought it was really great myself! I followed the recipe as is and made it just before the meal (had already done all the prep).  I have to admit I brought the pre-cut butternut squash which makes it even easier. Wonderful blend of flavors! I know I will be making it again.

Made this tonight, but didn't have all the ingredients. So I made my own tomato paste with one skinned medium Roma tomato, then I substituted Hoisin sauce for fish sauce, I used 2 tablespoons of red curry paste and no curry powder, and finally, I used parsley in place of basil for the fresh component. I want to try the recipe as is, but even with the subs, it was still fantastic. The calorie count for the dish, per serving, with my subs is 310 calories, just FYI.

I loved this. I roasted the squash first (50 minutes at 350 degrees with a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of coconut oil for each side) and added some white rice. Delicious!

Had to go to 2 stores to find the McCormick red curry powder from the video, but boy was it worth it. My usual curry powder doesn't have that cardamom which adds such a special flavor and aroma to this particular blend. I did omit the fish sauce. I thought the sauce was divine with the squash. I will be using this same sauce with all types of other vegetables and proteins in the future. Very satisfying dish for a cold winter night.

Made as written and served over rice with naan.  Instant hit.  Next time I will add some siracha at the end of the cook time just cause we like it spicy.

It was amazing!!!  The butternut squash was a booger to peal and slice, but the end result was well worth the struggle!  Yummy!

Super yummy! I roasted half the butternut squash and added the roast pieces at the very end. Plus I made it quite spicy by adding double the curry paste. Served with coconut rice for a Thai-esk dish. Everyone loved it, will be making again for sure!

It's a good idea for a recipe, so I'm giving it the full score. When I made it I didn't follow the directions exactly, so I don't know how reliable this review is.  I added lemongrass and used Thai basil instead of sweet basil.

yes I made changes because I thought I had the ingredients but was out of coconut milk. Yikes!  I had already peeled and cubed the squash too.
I was also out of red curry powder.
I substituted 3 cups of water for the coconut milk.  I added 1 cup of sweetened coconut.  Increased the cumin to 2 heaping teaspoons, and 1 teaspoon of ground cardamom. I also increased the Thai red chili paste.  I omitted the basil (I needed that for a cold pasta salad) and finely cut up at least a 1/2 cup of cilantro (stems and all) with scissors.   I made this last night, thinking there would be plenty left over for the weekend.  (ALL GONE).  I served it over white basmati rice, with sauteed lamb stew meat (salt and pepper only, Not spicy).  big hit.  big!

Great recipe and easy to make.  The only change I would make in the future is to cut the fish sauce in half.  It was a little too much; however, the curry was still delicious.  I added other veggies to the curry which worked out nicely

I was craving curry and had a bunch of butternut squash I wanted to cook up. I roasted the squash the night before, cubed it, and put it in the fridge overnight to cut down cooking time as well as not cube a raw butternut squash (because it's a pain!) I made the recipe as-is except for swapping the veg oil to olive oil since that's what I had in the house. Making this one again three days later. So good.

We really liked the flavor of this dish.  I was only able to use what I had on hand, so the fish sauce and red curry powder were omitted (and the onion which I don't like).  Otherwise, I made as written.  The squash took a bit longer than 20 minutes, though it weighed closer to 4lbs.  We both thought this would be great served over rice (with chicken too)!  We ate it as a side and I'd like to make again with the omitted ingredients.

FanTASTIC. I also added some kale in the final 5 minutes to give it some fiber. And I let it cook longer than the recipe explains because I wanted to make it into a soup. It was a delicious fall meal.

i love squash curry but this was just OK. Too much fish sauce for my taste. I added an extra can of coconut milk.

This is amazing! I made it without alterations, though I tend to heap my teaspoons when measuring spices because I like a lot of spice. I used full fat coconut milk but want to try it using light coconut milk next time.

Made as directed except didn't have  red  curry powder, so I added 1/4 tsp cayenne to my yellow curry powder, and didn't have fresh basil, so used 1 Tbsp dried. I also used leftover roasted squash and grilled chicken.  Delicious. The fish sauce added another dimension, as it always does.

Made as described but added four cups of veggie stock to make into a soup.  I also finished it by blitzing with an immersion blender.  Turned out to be a hearty, flavourful soup.

This is an excellent dish! We strayed a little from the original recipe as written out of necessity: couldn't find red curry powder, so we used regular curry powder with some cardamom and chili powder. We also added a cooked, cubed chicken breast with the squash and called it an entree served over rice. Used only half the recommended amount of cumin so it wasn't too hot for our toddler. He licked his plate clean. It also finished cooking at exactly the same time as our rice cooker. Fate!

Added baby spinach and red pepper about ten minutes before the curry was finished. It was DELICIOUS. Will make it again.

Very tasty recipe with a lot of Thai of Indian flavors.  I thought it lacked a little kick, so I added 1 tsp Cayenne pepper.  With salt and the pepper, I was absolutely a delicious dish.

Wonderful!   I roasted the butternut squash with a little olive oil and s &p, cooled, then peeled and added to the sauce, just to heat.   I will make again even if I am the only one who likes curry in the household!

This was absolutely delicious!! My  whole family loved it as well as my coworker!! I made a few changes.. I used a little bit more red curry paste and added a tsp of regular yellow curry instead of using red curry powder.  Had a little kick!  I will definately make this again!

Can easily be made with chicken, etc.
I did cut the fish sauce to 2T.

I only gave this recipe an average rating because there was one flavor that was too strong.  It overpowered the other flavors and for me it through off the taste of the dish.

Really easy and delicious - a great use of butternut squash! We enjoyed eating it with some peas. Might add some spinach or other veggies next time.

I thought this sounded like a really interesting new use for squash,  but it just wasn't very good. It was edible, but I won't be making it again. I think it was the fish sauce. I made a similar recipe from this site for curry chicken that didn't include fish sauce and it was great. Or maybe it's that squash is better in a drier preparation. Whatever it was, I didn't care for it.

I was unable to find butternut squash at the market, so decided to use sweet potatoes as a substitute. It took twice as long to cook naturally and was on the mushy side but with a little dash of hot sauce this was absolutely stunning and everyone talked about it for hours afterwards. FANTASTIC!

Love this dish!  Making it again tonight.  Super easy and delish.  Serving it on quinoa.
