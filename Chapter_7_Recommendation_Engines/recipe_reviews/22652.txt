It was a good dip, but it got pretty thick in the fridge. I definitely recommend heating it up prior to eating. Various spices can be added to achieve desired taste. I mixed it up in a food processor for good smoothness.

I did not like this recipe at all. I found it bland and not tasty enough to merit all the fat in it -- and I am not even someone who usually cares. I increased the amount of hot sauce about tenfold, and doubled or tripled the garlic and cumin, but to no avail. The texture of the mix was kind of chunky and I couldn't get them out no matter how hard I tried. Really, this was a platform for the tomato, onion and cheese. I omitted lettuce because I don't like it. I used red onion for flavour and colour, and added diced avocado chunks for colour and texture. (If you do this, beware, avocado turns brown in open air after a while.) It would be well to have small diced jalapeno as well. It turned out okay because I increased the topping portion, but I would not make this again.

I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012 - the first review of this was in 2004.  As written this is really bland but has so much potential.  The cream cheese / sour cream layer needs a lot more hot sauce.  I used Tapatilo and didn't really measure but I think it would be about 2 tsps.  Dice the lettuce really small.  Instead of just tomatoes and onions, use a spicy Pico de Gallo - fresh salsa.  There wasn't a scrap left on the plate and that is a good sign.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I just omitted the "garnish" ingredients and put the dip in a chip and dip bowl.  I sprinkled a bit of cheese and tomatoes on top, added a spoon for scooping and done!

I changed this recipe a lot..didn't realize I had no cumin so I used a little season salt.  Didn't use the lettuce, tomato, or onion.  Didn't use as much cheese (the cheese flavor would have overpowered everything) and I mixed everything together.  I'm sure if I would have put all the ingredients it may have needed all the cheese.  Pretty good and VERY simple.  yummy!!

I took a cooking class (I took it at summer camp) and we made this. It was super delicious and we all couldn't stop eating it. I don't know if there is a difference between hot sauce and chili sauce, but we used chili. I highly recommend it, even though I abhor cheese and dislike sour cream and cream cheese.
