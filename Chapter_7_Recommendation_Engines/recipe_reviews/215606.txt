Delicious combination of ingredients. I roasted and pureed fresh pumpkin for this and used chicken breast (pre-marinated in herbs and baked in another dish while I roasted the pumpkin.) I added some minced garlic to the broth cause I knew I would like the flavour in there and I used couscous for the pasta. It turned out delicious. Like a pasta risotto! This one is going in my favourites folder.

Great fall weeknight dish! I followed others' suggestions and added a couple cloves of minced garlic; plus, I used pureed fresh pumpkin in place of the roasted pumpkin chunks and doubled the amount of chicken. Before adding the parmesan, I sprinkled in some fresh grated nutmeg to bring out the natural sweetness in the pumpkin and onion. It was really delicious and easy to make. Definitely a keeper! Next time, I am going to try it with some chicken apple sausage I found at the supermarket in place of the roasted chicken breast.

this is super easy, a good fall/winter dish, and a nice way to use turkey leftovers.  i made it with orzo pasta and 1 c of pumpkin puree instead of squash.  the best bites are the ones with turkey--next time i'll double the turkey.  it didn't blow my socks off but it was comforting and i would make it again. you could probably substitute any spices other than thyme if you prefer--garlic, basil, italian spices, etc.

I have to admit I was quite a bit scared to try this but we did. I didnt have any Thyme so I substituted for basil and a pinch of rosemary.For the winter squash we actually used the Halloween pumpkins. The first night it was okay. The flavors hadn't blended fully. The kids were not to thrilled, but after a day of sitting the kids devoured the remaining yesterday and raved about how good it was. Thanks for the recipe

Soo good... like a pumpkin macaroni and cheese! I think turkey goes better than the chicken that some reviewers suggested.  I did 1/2 lb of pastina and then 1/2 lb of mini wagon wheels-- i think that really added to the hearty texture.

Really delicious. I didn't have small pasta, so I used quinoa and a sprinkling of flour to thicken the broth a bit. Wish
