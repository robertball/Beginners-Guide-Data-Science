I added 4 cups water to 1 cup steel cut oats because that was ratio on the package. Excellent results! It was a little "watery" until I blended it together. The pressure cooker is definitely the way to go when preparing steel cut oats!

This was cooked perfectly!  Trying to eat healthier just got a lot easier.  The oatmeal was tender but not mushy.

For me, this is the perfect method for IP steel-cut oats. This is so much easier than stove top,  I now make them much more often than I used to. The liquid to oats ratio is the right consistency for me. And the time of 3 minutes is perfect. Other recipes call for 5 min or even up to 15 min! The oats start sticking to the pot after 5 minutes. They might seem a bit watery at first, but they thicken quickly. And you can put your add-ins right in the pot if you'd like. If your IP isn't done releasing pressure after 10 minutes, you can go ahead and release it.

The ratio of liquid to steel-cut oats is perfect. So, I consider this a basic starting point recipe especially since salt and sweetener are omitted. I used 1 cup almond milk and 2 cups water (as the submitter suggested in the cook's notes).  I also added chopped apples and cinnamon to top the oatmeal.

This is a great simple recipe. I usually make a batch on Sunday and put them in individual jars to make morning breakfast a breeze. I add the toppings when I warm them up since each kid likes different oatmeal.

Perfect consistency! I added a bit of salt in the water and then after it was cooked, served it with a bit of brown sugar and fresh cut bananas. VERY TASTY!!

Came out pretty well.  I added 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar , only 2 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar free almond milk.  Pretty tasty and like the texture.
