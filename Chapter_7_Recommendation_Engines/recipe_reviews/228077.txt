These are very tasty! I did not have applesauce so I substituted a heaping tablespoon of sour cream. I know this steps away from Paleo but it is still lo carb and delicious. I ground my own blanched almonds to make almond meal, so there was some extra texture lol The vanilla and cinnamon were also omitted...this time. I will be using this recipe and experimenting further! Couldn't give it all 5 stars because I didn't follow directions to the letter.

I liked the way these turned out. I used almond milk because I didn't have any coconut milk on hand. I wasn't crazy about the strawberries with this so next time I will just skip that part and use maple syrup instead.  I'm not following paleo so I'm not sure if maple syrup is allowed or not but I think it would compliment the flavors better. thanks for sharing the recipe!

I couldn't keep the pancakes together.  I was able to successfully make 8 but they were pretty pathetic.  Can someone help me with this?

Sadly I can't say whether these were tasty or not.  The batter tasted good and I was so looking forward to eating them, but they fell apart.  I finally got one pancake cooked and it was burnt.  I tried all sorts of variations while cooking including using 2 pans, one with coconut oil and one with olive oil. All measurements were the same, only substitution I made was almond milk.  All ingredients were purchased recently.  I ended up thinning out the mixture after trying to cook the original.  I'm not sure what the secret to this is, possibly mixing it with another flour. Worse cooking experience I've had in years AND I was hungry. :(

I didn't change the recipe, and these were awful.  It wouldn't stay together during cooking. Lumpy and bad texture. Flavor was fine, but it was like eating a pile of almond crumbs.

Yum!  Better than traditional wheat flour pancakes.  And they kept me satiated a lot longer.  

I didn't have any applesauce, so I just added a little extra coconut milk...maybe 1-2 tbsps.  

Also, we didn't have any strawberries, so we used blue berries with two tablespoons of maple syrup instead.
