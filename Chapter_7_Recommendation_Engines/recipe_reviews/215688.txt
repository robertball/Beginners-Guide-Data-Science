Tried making it with 1 large zucchini.  To anyone that does that in the future...skin the zucchini before stuffing and baking it!  :)  Once the skin was off, it was delicious!

This was pretty tasty & easy. I pureed the zucchini flesh in a food processor -- easier than mashing I think. Also, I used quinoa instead of flour, then added a little almond flour because the filling seemed too thin. The texture was great. Great way to use zucchini as a main dish. It was a little bland- I think I undersalted it. Improved with more salt & a little hot sauce on the side!

Meh.  

The whole thing sounded bland, so in addition to the optional tomato, I added 1 big clove garlic, a few dashes each of parsley, marjoram, and Tabasco.  I pulsed everything in the food processor to make it easier, and it turned out fine.  Rather than drizzling with olive oil, I sprinkled the tops with panko before baking.  I also sprinkled on a little grated parmesan during the last 10 minutes.  

It STILL wasn't very flavorful, and the whole thing had a funny metallic taste to it despite using a good brand of tuna.  I won't be making it again.

We liked this -- quick and easy with a "comfort food" feel. I added 1 tsp chili powder for flavor.

I followed the recipe and even added a few "improvements" like other reviewers. Two cloves of chopped garlic, 2 teaspoons of chili powder, a heavy seasoning of salt and pepper with a parmesan/mozzarella topping and the dish was still so bland. We couldn't even finish it. I won't be trying this recipe again.

This was both healthy and filling but as others had said, lacked any substantial flavor. I added plenty of salt and pepper, topped it with panko and Parmesan, even then my wife said this recipe was not a keeper. Tuna is generally bland to start with so adding additional flavor is difficult. I previously did a similar recipe, zucchini with the spicy Italian sausage which was a hit and I would use that one if given a choice.

These were so great! I grew up eating tuna as a kid so finding new ways to use it other than the good ol' tuna sandwich is always helpful.  These were very easy to make and very tasty, not to mention a healthier twist to dinner.

Tuna Stuffed Zucchini Haiku: "On the fence with this. On one hand, it was healthy, but a bit too bland." I ended up melting grated cheddar on mine b4 eating it, in the hopes that it would be like a tuna melt, but something still didn't jive w/ me on this recipe. I'd even added garlic and a dash of Sriaracha to the tuna mixture, after reading some of the reviews, but we weren't too terribly impressed. Happy to have tried it though b/c I love zucchini in all its forms!

I tried this because I wanted to try something healthy and new, and I picked this one because of the good reviews. well... i got to say, I disagree with the reviews. They seemed to be missing something... not sure what, though. But the main turn off is they had a weird aftertaste. really didn't enjoy at all.

We both loved it because I used all the previous suggestions and added mayo, salsa and chili pepper to the mix. Quick and easy!

Bland. I removed the bread crumbs and added some shredded cheese,  herbs (rosemary, parsley and oregano), red pepper flakes and garlic still wasn't enough to balance out the bland tuna taste. I do have to say the dish was creative! I guess I'm a lazy cooker because shelling out the zucchini seemed to be too much work without a great result. If I had to do it again I'd throw in more flavorful spices.

I use the mixture and just make tuna patties as my family isn't so big on the zucchini, but put extra in the mix. Gotta sneak in those veggies. This is a repeat meal for us, so delicious and healthy.

I don't normally go out of my way to eat zucchini, but I really enjoyed this dish! I added the tomatoes, along with lots of minced garlic, some garlic/siracha dried seasoning to give it a kick, and some additional salt-free garlic/herb seasoning. Prior to baking, I sprinkled it with more breadcrumbs (Italian herb flavored) and some Italian blend shredded cheese. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish and would definitely make the tuna portion of it again!

I was missing some ingredients So I had to make a few substitutions. I subbed rolled oats for the breadcrumbs, green onion for white onion. I added a tablespoon of sour cream, a handful of parsley, some dashes of tier medic and Italian seasoning, and a few cloves of garlic to avoid the bland flavor. I'm not a huge fan of zucchini but the stuffing tastes great and makes the rest of the zucchini bearable. I'll definitely make this again because it's a filling, healthy meal that isn't too hard. I would suggest cutting out more of the zucchini and not using quote all of it in the mix. Overall great! We had broccoli cauliflower mash on the side.
