I did like this recipe, and enjoyed the finished product, but I didn't rate it 5 stars.  I did try to dip this in Asian style sauces, but it did NOT taste like a regular eggroll & the flavors were a little weird together.  It basically tasted like an empanada.  So, I started dipping it in hot sauce - and THAT I really liked.  I didn't add a lot of the soy/salt/pepper "to taste" b/c I worried they would end up too salty tasting in the Asian dipping sauce.  (I used duck sauce.)  So, when I started using other sauces (particularly mustard & hot sauce), it left the insides a little bland.

My family did eat these eggrolls, but next time, we will probably use about half the suggested beef & potato ingredients, but leave the cabbage at 2 cups.  My daughter (she's 3) liked them with ketchup.  I can understand that, because when you think about it ground beef = hamburger, potatoes = french fries!

We could definitely try this again, b/c I did the prepping & eggrolling, and dad did the frying, so it was really more of a family meal than typical sit down dinners.  I will add some different seasonings to the filling, though...so the dipping sauce isn't such a requirement.

this was a good basic recipie, but I added lots of extras. I added carrots, onions, red peppers, garlic and some ginger. I also mashed the potatoes and used some of the starchy water to help hold everything together. They turned out really well.

Egg rolls are fun and delicious. Made as directed, this recipe didn't have enough flavor for my husband and me, but it did get me hooked on trying more egg roll recipes!

When it comes to egg rolls I did not find these up to par.  My family and I found that the beef/potato ratio against the cabbage was too high.  Next time I make these I will halve both the beef and potatoes.  We also found them to be quite bland.  I will try spicing them up a bit next time, maybe with some ginger or a pinch of wasabi.  Something to give them some FLAVOR!

Because of allergies, I had to omit the soy sauce and pepper, but added onion, salt and lots of garlic. (I know it would have been even better with soy sauce!) My husband dipped these in sweet and sour sauce and didn't realize they weren't regular egg rolls and my child who doesn't like egg rolls or cabbage liked them!  Had leftover filling, so I fried it like a hamburger patty.  I'll make this again.  I never would have thought of potatoes... Thanks.

This was a good recipe and quite filling, as noted!  I followed as written, though I baked them rather than frying (Frying is not my special gift...  LOL!).  I made a simple mayo-catsup-seasoning blend to serve as a dip, and they were a hit at a teen get-together.
