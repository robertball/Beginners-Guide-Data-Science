This turned out REALLY well and very juicy.  I cooked it a little longer, and I used about 1/2T of chili powder and 1/2T of cumin per hen.  1/2tsp of each for 3 chickens was not nearly enough for my family.  It turned out just great.

This recipe was the easiest chicken recipe I ever made!  I was looking for something quick to prepare but low on ingredients, and this met both requirements.  It's wonderfully moist and spicy and we loved it!

This was OK, but we prefer other seasoning compared to chili and cumin.

This was ok. DH wasn't impressed. It did come out juicy and tender, and the skin was crispy and flavorful, however the flavor did not carry into the meat. The cooking time was 45 minutes longer than what was stated, be wary if you are timing sides to be complete at the same time! We were done the baked potatoes 1/2 hr. before the chicken was done!!

This was my 1st time making this recipe and it was excellent!! I made it for my parents for valentines day since my husband is deployed in afghanistan. I spent V-day with my parents! It was very tasty and moist!! The only thing I did different was, I put a garlic clove inside the cavity of the hen and added more rosemary in there for extra flavor. I highly recommend this recipe!! It looks so professionally when set upon the plate!! We loved it!!

It certainly was easy! I quite liked it, but my husband found it too bony, he's not keen on bone-in, skin-on chicken recipes. We made it with about half the margarine called for, but otherwise as written. Husband was home that morning so he actually did the work and said the recipe practically made it itself. We had a late afternoon activity and it was nice coming home to a made main-dish and just having to heat up a veg for the side. I always have uses for left-over cooked chicken, so if I plan ahead a little this might be quite good for that.

The hens were moist and pretty flavorful. I used lemon juice since I had no lime on hand. I also put garlic in the cavity, however, next time I think I will actually sliver it into the breast of the bird. Hen needs a good hour to cook. Lift the wings to make sure the meat is not pink.

I  tweaked this a little bit.   I mixed the spices listed plus garlic powder and onion powder in softened butter and spread it under the skin.  Followed the recipe the rest of the time, adding time as recommended by other reviewers.   Turned out great!  will make again. 4 stars, because I tweaked it.

We only had one chicken. As suggested by others on here I used 1/2 T chili powder and 1/2 T cumin. (in addition to the salt and pepper)  It tasted great! I also put some lime juice and the spices in the cavity. 
I changed the cooking time. After the first 15 minutes on 450 C. I took the temp. down to 350 C. and baked for 50 minutes. Will make this again.

This was better than the other recipe that I made but it still wasn't that great. Flavor wasn't throughout the hen. Took longer to cook as well. Won't be making again.

I fixed this for dinner last night. My husband and I enjoyed the dish. There was not a bite left over. The hens were moist and had a nice flavor. This is not a receipt for a person looking for the dish to have a kick.

I followed the recipe exactly. Wasn't enough time to cook unless you like eating bloody chicken. Also,  all you're doing is flavoring the skin. Now, that was tasty. However, that's all it is.

It came out really good.  I'm allergic to cumin aND red pepper bothers me, so I seasoned it with onion, garlic, and salt on the inside. Then on the outside I used salt, pepper, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and a roasted garlic and herb that comes in a grinder. Very tasty. :D

Family enjoyed these birds. Not very spicy so young and old could enjoy the flavor. Did need to cook for quite a bit longer than stated in recipe, but we do like a drier meat. Just a hint of of lime flavor.

It turned out very well! I did use a bit more seasoning than the recipe calls for (my family likes heavy seasoning) but the cook time was perfect and cooking it on a rack helped it to cook more evenly. I will be using this recipe again!!!

OK.  Liked the seasoning/flavor and simplicity.  But the white meat was a little dry.  May or may not make again.

Definitely tender and juicy. I added chopped carrots and potatoes to the dish to cook together. Season wise - 1/2T of cumin and chilli powder per hen per suggestion from another review (I cooked two hen). Garlic powder to taste, slided onion and bell pepper and season salt to taste (versus regular salt).  I added flour the last 15 minutes or so of cooking. I cooked it a little longer than 30 minutes at 350 as suggested by another review. Taste and season while as you are cooking! Great recipe, thanks!

This was super easy. It turned out nice and juicy. I only used 2 of the cornish hens and kept the recipe the same. I decided to serve it with an Asian twist: rice, asparagus, and a Laotian dipping sauce. Yummy!

I cooked this cornish  hen recipe exactly as written, except 2 hens, not 4. It looked beautiful, however, we travel for work and stay in an RV and the oven in those aren't always accurate, so I left it in for 10 more minutes. The flavor was delicious, but a little tough. I think next time I will do what someone else suggested and cook it a little longer.I will make this again!

I left out the chili powder. Don't like spice.

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. I'm not much of a cook but I can follow instructions pretty good.  I can also do a little improvising as I did in this case.  Had to cook it a little longer than stated.  Left off cumin and used lime juice in place of real lime.  I also used the various other seasons I typically cook with like, garlic seasoning and seasoning salt.  Instead of olive oil I used melted butter. It was nice and golden. I dove in to quick to take a photo.  Um Um good.

Awesome!  Never made any kind of game bird before and this was terrific.  My husband loved it!
