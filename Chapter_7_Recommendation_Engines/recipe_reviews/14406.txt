This was delicious Karen. I skipped the vinegar and used olive oil only and let the salad sit on the counter so the salt could draw out all of the wonderful juices. When you've finished the salad make sure you have some nice crusty bread to soak the great garlic infused liquid. Yum!

YUM-O, It was perfect complement to Surf & Turf - Gulf Coast Style also found on allrecipes.com  Perfect blend of flavors!  This was like tabouleh with out the bulgar wheat.  I used an orange bell pepper instead of green, and green onions instead of regular onion, rather than vinegar, I used lemon juice. I used some Cavenders seasoning instead of salt, it's a greek seasoning salt.  I only used one garlic clove and mixed it in a small container with the oil and lemon juice and seasoning. I let it sit in it's own juices and chill for about an hour before serving.    Wow, the flavors really popped!   The only thing we would do different next time, or when using the leftovers, add some feta cheese.  Great for lunch the next day! We will definately make this one again.  This is our new summer favorite!

Delicious, healthy and perfect for summer. I was able to go right out and pick most of the ingredients from my garden. In our household, we enjoyed it even more by using sweet red bells instead of green.  Also, tastes even better when mixed with crumbled feta or blue cheese.

I made this salad for a bridal shower and it was a huge hit.  I used green onions and yellow bell peppers for color.  I also added sliced black olives and feta cheese for more flavor.  Didn't have white wine vinegar so used rice wine vinegar and it seemed to be OK.

This is a wonderful light and flavorful dish!  I was feeding a crowd, so I doubled the recipe.  I also used plum tomatoes instead of regular, as well as added some olive oil and crumbled feta.  Everyone loved it!

Easy to make and delicious, my whole family loved it.But I cut the garlic down to about 1 teas. and used 4 green onions. I used dried basil and parsley equal to the amounts of fresh (I know I shouldn't do this, but in a pinch the results are still very good.)

This salad is the perfect summer food! I just made it and it is fabulous. Fat free too, although adding some olive oil would probably be pretty good too! Thanks for this recipe!

This is a good, light summer salad.  I used less onion, left out the bell pepper, balsamic vinegar and dried herbs.  I'm sure this would be a five star recipe with fresh parsley and basil, had I had them.

as is its ok. i needed more vinegar so the entire salad would be coated so i doubled it. ( i used 2 first and it wasnt enough) after i tried it i added a good drizzle of olive oil and a scant tsp sugar and it was perfect. it was better after it chilled in the fridge a couple hours. thanks for the recipe.

Great summer salad.  After the herbs have been chopped the rest is a breeze!  I served with "Creamy Penne Pasta" and the "Oregano Chicken" and my guests loved it.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

Great use of summer produce, especially straight from the garden.  Easy, light, and quite refreshing.  And just to see how it tasted, I threw in a few red pepper flakes.  Perfect foil against the Baked Halibut Sitka's creaminess I served with this.  Will be adding this to the summer rotation.  Thank you Karen 614

My boyfriend and I loved this the second time around. I don't know why I still put in the bell pepper, even though I hate it. I can't stand raw bell peppers because they are so overwhelming, and I just don't like them.. Neither does my boyfriend, so I left them out this time. I added feta and we ate this with toasted wheat pitas. Very yummy and very light! Will make this again, but only with the adjustments. Also, used dried herbs. No use in buying fresh herbs if I can't use them fast enough.

This recipe was really good and fresh.  My boyfriend loved it.  Plus it was a good way to get him to eat some vegtables.  And easy to make. I used three tomatoes and three cucumbers and only a quarter of an onion. I also added more vinegar and used a red pepper.  It is even better the next day.  I will make it again.

This salad was very good.  I prefer alittle less parsley but the longer it sat, the better it tasted.  Perfect summer salad as I had everything fresh in my garden.  A keeper.

I think I used too small tomatoes.  Next time I will half the onions and peppers & double the tomatoes.  This was good, but it didn't emphasize the garden fresh tomatoes enough.

Love this and it's great for South Beach dieters.  I used dried basil and added some fat free feta & cannelini beans. Also used red wine vinegar since I like the flavor better & a little EVOO.

Perfect for what I was looking for!  Made minor changes for what I had.  Used cherry tomatoes (red and yellow) used a shallot, and a yellow bell pepper.  Perfect and fresh!  The garlic I just used a mincer for to make sure it was nice and crushed.  Yum!

We just had this with our dinner and it was fantastic! What a great way to eat up the tomatoes from the garden. I used only 1 tsp of minced garlic for my own liking. I also didn't have fresh basil or parsley so I used dried and it turned out fine. Next time I'll use the fresh herbs and it will be even better.

This was a nice, refreshing accompaniment to a summer meal. A great way to use up some fresh produce I had on hand. Only change was that I didn't have any fresh parsley so I added a bit of dried oregano. Very good- thanks for sharing!

It may have been the parsley....much too intense flavor that overwhelmed this otherwise nice salad.  Next time will leave it out or use just a bit of dried parsley.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Have made this 3 times.  Last time I made it I put it in my food processor and had a wonderful cup of cold soup (almost like Gazpacho).  Will be making this often.

This tasted so fresh.  The fresh herbs really made it!  I made everything according to the recipe and it was very good the day I made it.  The second day the salad tasted a little wilted.  I would not make this recipe a head of time.  Everyone loved it.

This salad is healthy and delicious!  Usually raw onions bother my husband and I, but the vinegar must have neutralized them.  We both enjoyed this healthy side.

Great dish and good for the weight watchers program as one cup is zero points!  The fresh herbs make the difference so don't skimp on them or the garlic.  I use a small onion so it doesn't over power the tomatoes.  I also use only half of the green pepper and then use half of an orange or yellow one.  Green peppers have a strong taste so the other peppers tone it down..but if you love the taste of raw green pepper than use a whole one and add a little of one of the others for fun.  This is best when made a day in advance.

This was SO good.  I made it as a side dish for a dinner party and one of my guests had three or four helpings.  It was not popular with the hubby, who doesn't like tomatoes, but I expected that.  If you like tomatoes, it's a winner! :)

This recipe sounds absolutely delicious!  We have all these fresh ingredients here in Texas right now at our local merchant farmers markets and I certainly take advantage of them. We used to have our own garden before water became rationed...a real bummer!

Wonderful salad, great way to use up tomatoes from your garden.  Lovely presentation.  Only thing I added was olive oil.  If making a day in advance, hold off on the salt and vinegar until the morning you serve it; gives the flavors a chance to mix without breaking down the tomatoes.

I made this for a Church Picnic and even though there was another tomato salad brought. Mine was the only one that was completely finished. The only thing I did was add a red and yellow bell pepper instead of the green, and added half a teaspoon of sugar. This will always be my go to salad for summer.

Very good with fresh from the garden veggies and herbs. I did use some lime pepper seasoning, and a dash of lemon juice, and just spritzed some red wine vinegar, the juice from the veggies was almost enough. Great for a hot summer afternoon.

This salad was very good.  I used a small red onion, red wine vinegar and dried basil instead of fresh and it still tasted great.  Next time I have fresh basil I will definately use it.  The flavors blended very well and without oil is a very healthy and light side dish.

I made this recipe this morning. I was doubtful of the "1/2 cup chopped parsley" and "1/2 cup chopped basil". That seemed excessive and, it turns out, it was!!! A tablespoon or less of each would have sufficed! (If it's the basil and parsley flavor you're looking for, soak those ingredients in the white wine vinegar for an hour or so and use a press to extract the leaves from the juice, then add the juice to the salad.) Unless you're a dedicated fan of parsley and basil, beware, adjust your ingredients as desired. The tomato, onion,  garlic, cucumber and bell pepper work well together and the white wine vinegar, along with juices from the veggies, creates a nicely flavored vinaigrette. Be sure to adjust the salt and pepper content to your liking! Otherwise it's bland. I let it chill in the refrigerator for a few hours. If it weren't for the picking basil and parsley out of my teeth for hours after, I'd highly recommend this.

I substituted cilantro for parsley. It really brings a fresh taste to the salad. I have made it once with apple cider vinegar but prefer the white wine vinegar.

I would use less herbs both amount & variety.  the herbs over powered the other flavors.  someone else used only olive oil, I would try it again with those changes.

So good!! I changed it up in some small ways but it was still delicious. I used a combo of Roma and yellow cherry tomatoes, I soaked the red onion in ice water before to take the bite out, I used red wine vinegar because I didn’t have white wine vinegar and added about 3 tbsp instead of two, and I added a little olive oil. Yum! I think it would also taste good with avocado or feta, you could probably use cilantro in place of the other herbs (or maybe together) too. I made it as a side dish for curried fish tacos and also had quinoa. It was tasty mixed with the quinoa. Great and easy recipe!!

I made it with heirloom tomatoes and added cucumber. We ate outside with grilled shrimp over couscous and corn on the cob. Summery and easy.

Yummy! Based on what was available from garden I left out basil and parsley and exchanged it for chives. I completely left out the white wine vinegar but did add a lemon goat cheese and it was the perfect addition! Great use of summer vegetables!

Tasty salad. Used small heirloom tomato mix. Used scallion tops and thinly sliced shallots as we don't care for strong raw onion flavor.

Was very good fresh and healthy! I do think a whole red onion was too much though and I added a tablespoon of olive oil and little lemon juice. I will make this again! Yum!

This was really good.  I read a lot of other reviews and decided to add 1/8 cup olive oil (good), 1/3 lb feta (expensive but worth it), change the garlic to a big pinch of garlic powder, skip the basil since I didn't have any, and fresh parsley (20 leaves or a small small bunch).  I think the amount of vinegar is pretty much up to you.  Too much is bad and you need more oil to balance it, but I added 1/8 cup.  My vegetarian wife is particular sometimes, but she said keep the recipe and make it like this next week.  I was going to add olives because it sounded good, but my wife said not to change anything.  I will make it this way again!

Very fresh, from the garden. Great way to make use of an overabundance of tomatoes. Based on some of the reviews, I cut back on the onion and garlic slightly. I used champagne vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that's what I had. I figured they were similar. Delicious! After two days of eating it as a side dish, I put the remaining leftovers in the blender and it made a great gazpacho!

The onion was so strong, it overpowered everything else. And I didn't really care for the vinegar. Maybe with olive oil instead, I'd make it again.
