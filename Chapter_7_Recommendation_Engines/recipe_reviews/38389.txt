This dish is very popular in Buffalo, where I live-especially during football season, and I make it often.   The only issues I have with this recipe are: 1.   that it presumably uses the drippings from a half pound of bacon in which to fry the onions.  Seems like a lot of grease to me.  I just leave a tablespoon or so in the pan. 2.  I double the amount of mushrooms.  They cook way down and add a lot of flavor and texture. 3.  I drain and squeeze the sauerkraut dry, but do not rinse it.  Rinsing makes a much blander dish. It's just as easy to double the recipe, considering all the prep and dirty pans,   and makes great leftoivers

This was different and easy. A great way to use up bacon. I did add two large chopped garlic cloves in with the onion and fat free soup. My husband loved it. I will make this again.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is always delicious.  I use the whole pound of bacon and use canned mushrooms instead of the fresh and it turns out great every time.

Very good stuff.  My mom has a similar recipe that calls for crumbled italian sausage...I might try that next time.  My boyfriend, who HATES sauerkraut liked this well enough that he gave me permission to make this one again. Not a fancy dish but it is filling and tasty.  Thanks Joanne.

This was great. I used chopped kielbasa instead of bacon, and threw some buttered bread crumbs on the top before baking. (The mixture looked a little dry and I didn't want it to dry out in the oven.) It came out very well; not too saucy, not too dry, and with excellent flavors. This would be great to take to an autumn or winter potluck.

This was really very good. I was a little sceptical but pleasantly surprised.  We did not change a thing. Thanks. This will be made again.

This was very good.  However, I had to make a change.  I only had cr of mushroom w/roasted garlic in the house, so I used that.  I think I would have been happier using just the regular.  Other than that, I added some keilbasa as someone else suggested.  The whole family liked it, so I guess it's a keeper!  Thanks for a different but delicious dish!

Crack cassarole. Let's just call it what it is.

This stuff looks like , but tastes like heaven. 
I did a few alterations, to add more flavour:
- used a 1lb of FRESH button mushrooms (don't use canned - yuck!)
- don't strain the sauerkraut. Keep that extra marinate flavor and add it all in.
- saut√©ed the mushrooms and onions in the bacon fat (didn't use the recommended butter extra step; waste of a pain and why add a new fat?)
- used a full 1lb of bacon. YUM. 

This is a new fav of mine.

Definitely easy and can be modified with lower fat options (ie. remove bacon fat, low/no fat mushroom soup, ect)

This was an awesome recipe!  I followed it exactly, except I put in a little less kraut.  Make sure to drain ALL the juice from the kraut or it gets a bit sloppy.  I made it for supper and the whole pan was gone before the night was over.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is an amazing dish...I do however make a few alterations. I use sea shell pasta vs. the rotini, and I cook the onion in a half stick of butter, then add the bacon. (I used turkey bacon and it tasted delicious). I also added the sauerkraut straight out of the jar, juices and all...it adds so much more flavor to the dish! I added about 2 teaspoons of Worchershire sauce and omitted the mushrooms completely. I love mushrooms, but I don't feel they belong in this dish, the few that are in the soup are sufficient enough for me. Lastly I added an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix...really takes it over the top!! I found that because of the thickness of all the ingredients combined, I DID have to add a splash or two of milk to give it room to groove.

OMG! This was so good.  My boys came back for 3rds.  I thought the sourkrout was going to turn them off but they loved it.  I used ground beef and keilbasa instead of the bacon.

Simply delicious. I made enough for four by using 8oz Cappalletti pasta, 4 slices bacon, 1/2 large onion, some garlic, 8oz mushrooms, T margarine, 14oz Sauerkraut, 1 can soup.

Loved it! As the title says, this recipe is fast, easy, and still has some great pierogi-style flavors to it. Perfect for those days when you have a craving but not the time or energy (or certain ingredients!) for making everything from scratch.

You know, this is a lot better than I thought it would be.  I got healthy with it and used turkey bacon, whole wheat pasta, and fat free soup.  Still good, everyone liked it.  More bacon next time (I should've listened to everyone else).

I love this and make it every year for Easter! I went to a party once and they also put in smoked polish sausage. I always put it in now. Makes it more of a meal and more tasty too!

I'm from WNY, too, as others have noted. As a FYI, Lazy Pierogi are not pierogi. They are a whole other dish. A quite popular staple at just about every Polish event you go to. And the variations noted in these reviews are typical variations depending on whose Mom gave you the recipe. We use a version with kielbasa, 1/4 # bacon, undrained sauerkraut, touch of Worchestershire and garlic--in addition to what's noted.

I used less pasta and more fried mushrooms and sauerkraut. I rinsed the sauerkraut too much and there was not much flavor. Next time I will use garlic sausage instead of bacon and I will just slightly rinse the sauerkraut. Will make again.

Very good recipe, definitely different...I added Panko bread crumbs, used whole wheat rotelle and actually less bacon (and used turkey bacon) to make it healthier.

i'm so happy to have found a recipe for one of my favorite dishes! just a couple thoughts:  -didn't add bacon because i'm a vegetarian. might try fake bacon next time.  -used 12 oz of egg noodles (instead of 16) -it was a bit dry, even with 2 cans of soup - next time i might add another can -i've always had lazy pierogi with farmer's cheese. will definitely add some next time.  this is definitely a recipe i will be using again and a gain!

This is one of my favorite dishes to make. I have been making it for years. The only thing different that I do, instead of the cream of mushroom soup, I add some of the bacon grease to the mixture. It gives it a lot more flavor that the cream of mushroom soup.

I had a friend who used to make this.  Her recipe was a touch different as far as the preparation but the end results were very similar.  My husband LOVED this.  He was so excited when he finally got to know what was coming out of the oven.  He said that the meal could have been just this and he would have been happy.  This is definitely a keeper at our house I guess!  I might use a whole pound of bacon next time, but the recipe is perfect just as it stands!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is great. I was very hesitant because it is so diffrent than things I normally make but it was a winner! Very adaptable too. I have used all kinds of noodles & onion flakes and it still turns out. This is a new favorite for my family.

My husband hates saurkraut and he ate it.  I'm from a Polish town and I love pierogi but don't have the time to make them.  This doesn't really taste like a pierogi but still good.

Yummy - but I am not sure I will make it again.  It did not stand out enough to make it again and again.

My family has been making this forever! The only thing I add is caraway seeds; at least 1 TB. More if you love the flavour as we do. This should solve the "bland" issue.

This is a great recipe, although bagged sauerkraut gives it a more fresh, flovorful taste. Also, if you love bacon opt in for a lb., but use less of the grease or it will be too greasy.

super great. I subbed the soup for a from scratch version found here http://centercutcook.com/cream-soup-substitute/ . also i wasn't sure if it should be covered while baking? I left it uncovered. Is that right?

I grew up in Buffalo, and my mother made this very often ! Love love Love this quirky dish ! The only difference is that she used a whole pound of bacon, and saved the grease to pour over the dish, skipping the soup ( eeew )and added garlic powder ....it was made on top of the stove, no baking required! Its a heart attack in the making....but sooooo good !

I live in WNY where this is a popular dish. I found this recipe to be bland, even with not draining the sauerkraut. This recipe is missing farmer's cheese, celery seed and brown sugar.

So good! I'm just getting into cooking for my fiance and this recipe was delicious! I didn't change anything the first time but will probably use fat free soup and wheat pasta the second time.

Went over well with the group of guys who replaced the roof over the barn bridge!  Served with burgers and ice cold beer.

This was just ok, neither my husband nor myself cared to have it again. We did not drain or rinse the sauerkraut-per some of the reviews, so it was a little tangy for my taste.

I topped the dish with kielbasa split in half before it went into the oven and it went on the table for Christmas.  Everyone loved it!  Will make it for any holiday from now on!

this was wonderful.. i was pleasantly surprised at the cream of mushroom soup.. i made this so bf could have a few meals to take to work and i can't have any as i'm lactose intolerant.. i cut the recipe in half.. used 7 oz of smoked sausage.. used more like 3/4 of an onion.. didn't rinse or drain the sauerkraut.. didn't add the mushrooms.. added a bit of leftover zucchini from another recipe.. it really didn't need any extra salt or pepper.. i'm sure bf is going to love this.. ty for the recipe

My grandmother made this dish except hers had a few changes....she used egg noodles, no butter (plenty of "grease" and flavor in the bacon drippings), and she didn't bake it (definitely saves on time)...also added garlic powder for additional flavor.  I've made twice...the first time I rinsed the sauerkraut...definitely better not rinsing...couldn't believe the difference in flavor!
