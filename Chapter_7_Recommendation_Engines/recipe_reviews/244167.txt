I'm afraid I didn't care for this dressing even though I really wanted to. I like all of these ingredients on their own, but together they didn't result in a balanced flavour. I even let it sit for a while thinking the flavours needed to meld to no avail. I used homemade vegan/gluten free Worcestershire sauce (from the AR site)-which I enjoy on its own. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I'm sorry it didn't work out for me.
