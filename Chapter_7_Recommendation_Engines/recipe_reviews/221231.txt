This pie is absolutely delicious! I love the flavor of the fresh lemon and tequila, and it was a hit with the family. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the pie just wouldn't set up enough. After three hours in the fridge, I cut a slice and it just kind of spread out on the plate. No problem...I put it in the freezer for a few hours and it firmed up nicely. I'll be making this one again, as a freezer pie.

To die for lemon pie!  I love deserts with liquor and tequila is my favorite.  I just added the tequila after cooking the mixture so it woudnt evaporate..Putting it in the freezer for a few hours makes it even better....very cold but not quite frozen!  Bon appetit!

After reading the previous reviews, I added 1 package of plain gelatin to the filling as I was cooking it.  The pie set perfectly.  If I were to make it again, I don't think I'd use the sour cream & sugar,but would rather use a whipped dessert topping.  Overall, it is very tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly as I always do when it is the first time. The consistency was poor and I did have to freeze it. Very disappointing as I served at the end of the evening with Turkish Coffee.

this pie was like mush so I suggest putting it in the freezer for a while before serving.  It tasted great, but too soft.
