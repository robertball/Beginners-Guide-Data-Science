This was very good. Perfect spice combo. Used almond flour. Did not have any slivered almonds.  Served with asparagus from the garden. Perfect pairing. Thanks for the post rckymtn!

Excellent mix.  We caught bass and used it on that and it was wonderful.  A good all around dry rub for wild fish.

Outstanding as a rub and cooked perfectly.  I left out the flour and treated the entire recipe as a rub.

DId not like paprika with trout at all.  We love trout and I grill it almost every week, year round.  Usually I marinate it in olive oil, dijon mustard, lime juice and fresh rosemary, but I wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, with the flour and paprika, this just did not work for us at all.  But thank you for sharing.

Best seasoning ever for fish!! Both my son and husband loved them. We have this meal at least three time a month. I do like to brush butter on before putting the seasoning on, it helps the seasoning stick as well as not burn.

Easy and delicious! I baked it in the oven on a rack. Did not have slivered almonds or fresh lemon, used lemon juice from a bottle,  and it still got devoured in no time. Yum!

This will be my new go-to recipe for trout. It was moist, flavorful, and delicious. It got my kids (4&6) to eat the skin on the trout. Make sure you oil your tin foil!!! Other than that this recipes is perfect as is.

Liked it, but wasn't very kid friendly, i guess just because trout has a lot of bones,so thats not the recipe's fault, but anyways, i only give five stars if my kids will eat it too. id try it again on boneless filets from the store
