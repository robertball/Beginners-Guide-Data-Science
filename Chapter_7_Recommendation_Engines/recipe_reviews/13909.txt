These are fantastic!  I was a vegetarian for 10+ years, when I ran across these.  They have a very meaty consistancy.  My husband (non-vegetarian) loves them too!  The only downside is that they are somewhat expensive to make, and takes a little extra time.  Needless to say, it is well worth it!  Goes very well with corn on the side.

I make this at Christmas and/or Thanksgiving as I am the sole vegetarian in my family.  It is always delicious and everyone requests it now as a side dish. Very rich, but can be easily made "light" by using lighter cream cheese and light sour cream.  Don't go Fat Free, though.  It really will affect the flavor.

I made these last night. They were pretty good! We are meat-eaters, but my family ate them up.

Delicious!!  My husband, a meat lover, really enjoyed them too.  He said they remind him of pork chops.  The recipe is perfect as it is...unique yet easy to make and very tasty.  We have added these to our monthly menu and for special occasions.

Yes, the patties were meaty enough but that was about it.  I felt the sauce was too thick and overwhelmed the patties.  I did serve these with some awesome mashed potatoes but now I am stuck with all the leftovers for many more days.

Super easy to make. It was a little bland on the taste but good enough that there were no leftovers. We will make this again. It's nice, because I have those ingredients as staples in my kitchen. Thank you.

These were very good. I think next time I will chop the walnuts up finer though. I did season in the frying pan with garlic powder and gave the sauce herb seasoning as well.  Tomorrow i will try the leftovers on a bun i bet it will be tasty as well. I will give this recipe to my vegan daughter.

These did not turn out very well for me. If I made this again, I would not add in walnuts and I probably would add in more herbs for flavor. It is too rich by itself and really needs a good accompainment to balance it out.
