Per the reviews, I upped the pumpkin pie spice to 1.5 tsp and used closer to 1 Tablespoon of orange zest. Both were good calls that I will do again if I make this again, and next time around I'd add vanilla in the cake and more sugar in both cake and filling. It also definitely needed to bake for a solid hour. Also, note on the parchment paper: I love to bake cakes with parchment paper. I'm lazy and hate to cut the paper to fit the pan, and I usually don't mind a somewhat a warped cake. For this cake, though, its worth the effort of cutting the paper into a rectangle that fits on the bottom and a long, wide ribbon that wraps around the sides.

I didn't make any changes to the basic recipe.  I thought it looked good from what I saw of the recipe but when I made it, the taste was a little disappointing.  I will make it again but this time put more spices in to increase the flavouring.

I upped the spice by a quarter of a teaspoon and extended the bake time by 15 mins as it didn't look done enough. Came out great! Will definitely do again! Will pour less on the bottom carrot cake portion and will swirl in the cheesecake batter a bit into the center as a channel so that it has more of the cheesecake in each bite!

I made this recipe exactly as written and was disappointed in the texture and flavor.  My hopes may have been too high.  My daughter's favorite foods are carrot cake and bourbon, so I wanted to make this for her.   I found the texture to be a little gummy, probably because of yogurt combined with the moisture of the carrots.  I have made other quick breads with yogurt and did not have this problem. I found the bourbon cream cheese to be lacking in flavor.  If I made it again I would use bourbon extract instead of alcohol.  But, unfortunately there are so many good recipes out there I probably will not make it again.

I put  cup yogurt by accident in. I used 2t cinnamon and 1t nutmeg. I also used rum  . II might not have let it cook long enough I did two smaller pans and 25 min. The cake was a bit heavy. reminded more of a bread pudding . Ill try the recipe again.

Followed recipe exactly, not the video.  Am at high altitude.  Cake/bread needed about 15 minutes more to bake.  I let hot pan sit 5 min and pulled up parchment paper to lift cake out.  Bad idea.  Ends of loaf fell apart. Dunno why.  Havenâ€™t tasted it yet, but will add more spices as per other suggestions.  I want this to be heavier and more dense but am not sure how to get that effect.  Will make third attempt without parchment paper and see what that comes out like.  I may add cream cheese frosting on one or two of these loaves.

Made a mistake hoping to make this look more "holiday dessert-like".  I baked in a round 9" pan; put 1/2 carrot cake batter in, then the cheesecake batter in big dabs, and then the remaining 1/2 cake batter.  Then I swirled it.  To batter I did add some (1/3 cup) maple syrup and used sour cream instead of yogurt (only fruit flavored in house).  Put in some extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice after reading the first two reviews.  The cake rose fine baking, tested done, but as SOON as I took from oven, it fell.  Taste was good but texture wasn't what I wanted.  It either wasn't quite done or I should have stuck with a loaf pan and/or not added the maple syrup. Not sure which.  My picky family liked it however.  I put vanilla ice cream on the side.  I will try recipe again and stick to pan size recommended and no maple syrup added to batter.
