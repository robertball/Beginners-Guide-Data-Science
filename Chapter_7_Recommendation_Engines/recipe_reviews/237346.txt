This was pretty good.  Be sure to add some salt and pepper.  I used regular midwestern radishes and white button mushrooms.  Also, I modified the recipe for 5 servings.

I have made this twice now.  The only changes I made were to increase the time to saute the beets, carrots and radish.  I added the mushrooms after about 4 minutes and then cooked for an additional 3 minutes.  I also added salt.

Love the cardamom accent
