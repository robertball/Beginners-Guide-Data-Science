Skipped the couscous and served the black bean/pineapple mixture over baked sweet potatoes.

This was surprisingly good given the minimal effort involved.  I used quinoa instead of couscous, cooked in a combination of pineapple juice and vegetable broth.  I also used home-blended taco seasoning.  My husband didn't love it, but I was happy to bring it for my lunch.

Although the picture is not too appealing, I like the flavors of this recipe, the protein from the black beans and the tang of the pineapple. I added a can of chick peas as well as the black beans, and I had to add more taco seasoning, liquid and salt because of that. I mixed it all together rather than putting the beans/pineapple on top, so that it was easy to divide up and refrigerate for later. Good for lunch with a piece of fruit on the side.
