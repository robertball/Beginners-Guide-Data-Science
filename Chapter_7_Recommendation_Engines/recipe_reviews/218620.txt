I'm afraid I didn't time things very well when preparing dinner to allow enough time for the stock and wine to reduce sufficiently before the fish I was preparing was done.  No matter - this was delicious in spite of it, so I can't even imagine how much better it would have been had that reduction been prepared as it was meant to be.  I did skip the bay leaf and I would the next time I prepare this as well - the right way.

5 stars.  Yummy
I used  bok choy from the farmers market homemade stock with no salt and reisleing for the wine.  It was fantastic.  This recipe will be as good as the ingredients you use.

The bay leaf and smashed garlic clove really infuse great flavor into the broth.  Do take the time to cook it down because you will have a rich sauce if you do.  I did thicken the sauce just a little with a cornstarch slurry.  Thoroughly enjoyed this, and it was a nice side dish to an Asian-themed dinner today.

These were outstanding!  Husband said it's definitely a recipe to make again :)
When I made it last night, I didn't have any white wine.  I wanted to share that it tastes just as great if you substitute the wine for cream.  The sauce also tasted great drizzled on the rice.  I don't normally write reviews when I modify a recipe, but this one is such an outstanding base recipe that I thought it worth sharing.

Sauce took way longer than 15 minutes to reduce and bokchoy took more than 10 minutes to get tender.  I think total time was double than written.  However, I think my baby bokchoy were larger than the average bear.  Still a nice recipe and we enjoyed it. Thx Valereee

Didn't have time to reduce broth but was still delicious.  Drizzled Hoisin Sauce overtop before serving. Will definitely make it again!

Awesome dish, kids love it. The only thing I add is extra garlic. I find it takes a bit longer than 10 min to simmer the bok choy until done. This is a favorite in our house.

Very bitter.  I followed the instructions and used quality ingredients, and it turned out just like the photos.  The bok choy was tender, but it just tasted bitter.

Made this for boyfriend (not a huge veggie eater and picky) and he loved it...now one of his fav dishes.  A def hit!  Thinking though of using a slight bit of thickening agent and using the sauce as a stir fry sauce...any thoughts?

Very simple but extremely tasty.  I added jumbo lump crab after cooking so as to keep the lump intact.

This was very good. I made it exactly as instructed and the marinade was SO TASTY! To create a little more glaze I brushed the salmon with a little extra honey in the last few minutes. I served it on garlic fried rice with a side of bok choy w/ oyster sauce and garlic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I should make the disclaimer that I hate vegetables, and made this recipe because I've been trying to eat more of them and thought it looked like I might actually like it. And surprisingly, I did.  A tip- when you lay the bok choy in the pan to simmer, leave the lid off the pan, otherwise your bok choy will get limp and water-logged. Also, I made the mistake of using chicken broth instead of stock, assuming that when I left the sauce to simmer it would thicken up. It does not, and my sauce was watery. Rookie mistake, I'm sure. In my opinion, it's best to leave just a tad of the bok choy stem on, otherwise when you halve them you just end up with a handful of bok choy leaves. In all fairness, had I not made these mistakes I'm sure I actually would have loved this recipe and given it five stars.

This dish may not be appealing but it makes up for that in taste.  It does take longer than 15 minutes to reduce sauce.

This was my first time preparing bok choy and it was awesome! I added more seasonings. I wish i had cut up the bok choy in one inch pieces because the leaf part was almost like okra. It was like sliding down my throat.

Excellent!  I think this is the 7th or 8th time I've made. I've yet to use a bay leaf. I also cut down on the chicken stock and wine. There is never any leftovers!!

Delicious, easy. Next time, I might slice the  bok choy so I can separate the stems from leaves. Leaves were pretty overdone by the time the stems were tender.

I'd make it again, although I might add some red pepper flakes, lemon juice, and a bit less broth. It smelled incredible, since it's pretty much a scampi sauce, but it never fully reduced and the bok choy just didn't pick up much of the flavor. Next time I'll also cut the heads like I normally do rather than halved; I separate the stems and toss them in first, because they take much longer to cook, and then add the leafy bits later. Otherwise, I wound up with very wilted leaves and chewy stems. Granted, I use shanghai bok choy, which is leafier than baby bok choy. I'm tempted to try this recipe out with something besides bok choy, too.

Deeeelish. Himself and I loved it. I halved the recipe and it was yummy. I did add the chopped up trimmed greens in the last 2 minutes. They are too tasty to waste. I poured them over the top with the sauce.

Halved the recipe and followed the directions except I used homemade chicken broth and added the juice of half a lemon.  Delicious and will definitely be added to our rotation.

This recipe was a big disappointment.  The broth/wine mix thickened to  a much too salty sauce for our tastes.  And the bok choy, when cooked for that length of time got too mushy.

This was easy and tasted great to me. I couldn't get the baby bok choy, so I went with regular bok choy that I sliced up. It paired nicely with the sesame seared tuna, another recipe available here.

This was delicious, even though I over-cooked the bok choy a bit too much. Will make again. Thanks!

This was really good and really easy!! I never prepared baby bok choy as main ingredient and it was great! I used about tablespoon of butter and used red wine instead of white because thats all I had and it turned out delicious!

This was OK.  My husband liked it  lot.  Me, not so much.  I found it a little bit bitter.  I did follow exact ingredients and instructions.  Wasn't bad but not smothing I'm going to rush to make again.  Thanks.

I substituted chicken broth for the wine. Tasted great!
