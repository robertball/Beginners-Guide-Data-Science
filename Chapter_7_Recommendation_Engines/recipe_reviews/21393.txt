This is soooooo yummy! I cut the recipe in half since it is just me, my husband and my toddler, big mistake! We gobbled it all up and wanted more! Next time I will definately make the full 8 servings. Also, I will add a little crushed garlic. Any time you see a 2.5 year old scarfing down cooked carrots, you know it's a good recipe!

I made this recipe with a frozen vegetable mix (broccoli, cauliflower & carrots) & I also used shredded cheddar rather than velveeta. It was quick & delicious & I think the vegetable variety added nice flavors. Thanks, I will make this dish again & again!

These are absolutely fabulous.  Even if you're not a big fan of carrots you will go back for more of this dish.  I scaled it down to 4 people and used a 1 pound bag of baby carrots.  I did cut them in half before steaming them.  I served the dish with a honey ham and it did compliment it very well although I think it would go great with any main course.  My 4-year-old ate all that was given to her.  I highly recommend this dish.

I don't like carrots but this recipe was quite good. (kind of like a baked macaroni and cheese but with carrots instead of pasta) I think next time I'll try it with broccoli or cauliflower. I didn't add the onions and used crushed croutons instead of the crackers. Also I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and light old cheddar instead of the processed cheese.

I fixed these carrots for Easter this year. My mother is still raving about them. My father, who had a stroke a few years ago and won't eat a vege, actually ate them and asked for more. They were so easy. This is a keeper in my house.

Great recipe for carrots.  I baked my carrots first on a baking sheet with sea salt, pepper and olive oil spray for about 15 minutes at 400 then let them cool enough to cut them into biite size chunks.  I also used skim milk and club crackers.  It was delicious.  I love reading all the variations and will certainly make this one again. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This was great! I used the cornflakes and low-fat sharp cheddar and light margarine. Those were the only changes I made. It was a great change from the glazed carrots I normally make.

I have been making this for years but instead of the crackers, I use Kellog's corn flakes crumbs.  It is fantastic.  This is my default potluck dish, and I never take any back home.  I have even started writing out several copies of the recipe before hand to save time, since I get asked for it so many times. I hate candied carrots so this is a wonderful alternative to them.

This was delicious!! I used 3 1/2 cups of sliced carrots, instead of 4 1/2, so it was creamier/cheesier.. I added other spices too (garlic powder, more black pepper and some cayenne pepper). I mixed sweet baby carrots with regular ones, so it had a nice sweetness to it too. And I used grated cheddar cheese and onion flavored crackers. Will definitely be making this again!

My 10-year-old thought these were the best carrots she's ever eaten!  BTW, 4-1/2 cups of sliced carrots is about a pound to a pound and a half.  I used my Tupperware microwave steamer for 7 minutes.

Wanted to see if my brother-in-law would try carrots made this was as he usually refers to them as dirt sticks. He did try them, of course still not his preferred vegetable of choice. I did use unsalted butter instead of margarine, omitted the 1/2 tsp of salt (as I felt the cheese added enough sodium to the mix) and used 1/2 extra sharp cheddar and 1/2 American cheese (as I didn't have enough American cheese for the full 2/3 cup). Next time I might do as others have suggested which is add a sprinkle of garlic powder and a dash of hot sauce. Thank you GrammyRose for sharing this recipe.

These are sooo yummy.  Even all my very finicky eaters gobbled it all up.  Maybe not the healthiest root for a veggie dish but can easily be made healthier by using low fat ingredients.  I did use butter this time since that's all I had on hand.  The only change next time is I will scale the flour down a touch to avoid a more floury Gratin sauce.  Don't pass this up.

My family loved this dish.  It's a great way to use up a lot of carrots and is a nice complement to any main dish (I served this with prime rib).  Fast, easy and delightful.

My family loved this! The only thing I changed was the topping which I doubled.  It's a nice side dish.  Was a great change from the normal veggies.  I would make again and again.. also added to my printed book of favorites.  Thanks for posting Grammyrose :)

Lovely; very good way to get everyone to eat veggies. Absolutely delicious. Of course, I used whole carrots and it took much, much longer to cook, even with cutting them in half. Next time, sliced carrots will suffice. But the whole thing was good; the recipe would be good with other veggies, too.

Very good.  Next time I will increase the vegetables and leave everything else as written.  I prefer sauces to enhance the vegetable, and not overpower them.

This was just what I was looking for!  With harvesting all the carrots from the garden, I did not want to pickle the carrots this time.  I did add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used extra old cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  My husband loved it and so did I.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Believe all the good things you've read about this recipe and don't change a thing! I was dubious the first time I tried this (carrots and cheese?!) but now it's one of the most requested recipes for family get-togethers and pot-luck dinners!
My mouth waters just reading the recipe!
ENJOY!!

Enjoyed putting this twist on carrots for a change.  This turned out great, but I used baby carrots since I was in a hurry, and I left them whole.  I would recommend using regular carrots, or cutting up the baby carrots.

I have to say that I've never made something from this site that was rated over 4 stars and not loved it as well.  This is a first.  I don't know what it was about the combination, but it did not work for anyone in my 6 person family.  I followed the recipe as written (unusual for me).  The crackers were pasty goo on top of bland carrots without much of a cheese flavor.  Sorry!

The best I have ever made!  Made a little more sauce than suggested, and added shredded cheddar and a little bit of Velvetta that I needed to use up!  -- chopped the onions, instead of slicing them!   WONDERFUL!!!  Loved it for Easter Dinner with ham!  Thank You!!

It was good to try something new with carrots! The family liked them but they didn't knock my husband's socks off. I will make them again and maybe add something to spice them up a bit.

Nice way to use up extra broccoli and carrots. I used Italian breadcrumbs in place of the crackers, with 2 tbsp melted butter, and it was pretty crumbly. Kids and hubby ate it up, and the sauce was wonderful. I added 3/4 tsp garlic salt to the cheese sauce to add some zip, and I would do it all over again. Thanks for the post, grammy!

Boy did they eat this UP!  Nooo left-overs and it's requested to be repeated regularly.  I think they'd eat it weekly. My kids say THANK YOU for posting this recipe.

These were okay.  A different way to fix carrots.  If I try them again, I think I will use cream of celery soup and sharp cheddar cheese.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!  I use this site ALL the time to help me when I am in a pinch and have no plan.  The only recipe that has come out better than this is that of Amy Miagaza "Amy's Garlic Egg Chicken" on this site.  (For those of you who haven't tried that one--it, too, is FABULOUS!) This was the BEST cassarole!  It was easy and different and  wonderful!  I will be adding this to my "holiday staples" even though I will be forced to have a few times more (at least) during the year, too.  ;)
Not only did I learn how to make this particular scrumptious dish, the instructions were so clear that, for the first time, I understand the basics of making a "milk gravy" AND a "cheese sauce"!

YeeeeeHawww, Sharon! You should consider writing a recipe tutorial book.  You explained the process succinctly and perfectly.  Kuddos to you! And thanks so much...

This is at the top of our list of family favorites from this site - and we have several. I've scaled it to 6 servings, used sliced fresh baby carrots and enjoyed the positive responses. I've been asked for the recipe - and my husband looks forward to seeing this one on the menu!

Very nice, a different way to eat carrots!  I added a lil' more cheese since I like it so much, and used regular club crackers (didn't have the round ones).  My boyfriend and I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I may need to try this with some other vegetables.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, because I had a lot of peeled baby carrots that needed to be used up.  I simply cut the baby carrots in half, instead of slicing them.  I added garlic powder to add some flavor, and I used some grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta.  It was pretty good, but I didn't hear any raves about it, so I probably won't make it again.

I am a carrot lover but carrots au gratin did seem a little odd to me and it was. however, the sauce was wonderful and I think this would be great made with a mix of vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower AND carrots. the sautéed onions give it a great flavor - don't leave them out! I increased the amount of black pepper to ½ tsp, and added ½ tsp of garlic powder and ¼ tsp of cayenne pepper to the sauce. I will definitely make this again with other veggies because the sauce was that good! thank you grammyrose, as I am a novice and this was my first cheese sauce made from scratch!

This recipe was more than I could have ever anticipated. I needed something to get rid of a bag of carrots i had in my fridge and i stumbled upon this. I made it and have never tasted anything like it. We had this with chicken and my hubby almost forgot the chicken was on the plate because he was so into this delicious dish! I USED SALTINE CRACKERS AND SHREDDED CHEDDAR CHEESE, STILL CAME OUT GREAT!

Made this last night as an attempt to use some of the 5 lb bag of carrots in the fridge.  There were only 3 of us, so I only used about half as many carrots as this recipe used, then just eyeballed the rest (but honestly, kept them at mostly these measurements - it was really creamy).  Didn't have any ritz-like crackers, though, so subbed whole-wheat saltines.  Also realized as it was time to add it in, that I didn't have any milk.  Ended up subbing chicken broth and 2-3 tablespoons of sour cream.  Delicious, if really unhealthy, way to eat your carrots!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got mixed reviews.  I enjoyed it, and several others told me they liked it, but I didn't make a whole lot and had plenty leftover.  I gave it 3 because it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the big hit I had hoped it would be.  I made it exactly as written.

I just made this for supper, and it was SOOOOO good! My sister, who hates EVERY vegetable, was over for dinner and had seconds! I didn't like the idea of the processed cheese, so I used half sharp cheddar and half mozzarella, and it was superb!

This is the only way I will eat cooked carrots as the main characters.  I generally don't like them on their own, but love them as ingredients in other dishes.  This is an exception...thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe. I need to do some tweaking. I will need to add more mozzarella cheese and crackers on top. Using the baby carrots worked great. I will use other suggestions from other reviews and try using garlic salt. Will make again.

This recipe was fairly easy to get together and I was excited about trying it after all of the rave reviews.  It just didn't work for us though.  It seemed like an odd combination between the cheesy sauce and the sweet carrots.  I think it would be much better with potatoes.  The sauce was good - it just didn't meld with the carrots for us.

Very good, but I added way more cheese including cheddar. Next time I will try a different topping, i didn't care for the crackers. Also the butter was not enough to crisp up the crackers, so maybe that was the problem. I will definitely be making it again though!

made this because  i love carrots, onions and cheese so why not all together?! it didnt taste horrible but it had no real kick to it or something we ate it but it is not something we would go looking for in the fridge to eat the next day... though i thought it was pretty quick and easy to make unlike someother reviews

This was a good recipe.  It is imperative that you cook the carrots well before adding them to the casserole or you will be eating hard carrots.  The taste was a little bland for me.  I probably will make this again but with a little tweaking to it.

I've made this with frozen cut carrots and it's just as good and doesn't take anytime at all.  It is always a hit and easy to make.

My family enjoyed these carrots.  I had no crackers so I used corn flakes and I used cheddar cheese since I don't particularly like the taste of processed cheese.  My 3 year old and 14 month old liked them so that's always a good thing!

I have never liked carrots since being forced to eat them as a child...my husband loves carrots and mentioned that he missed having them served since we got married and I don't normally cook what I don't like.  I tried this recipe and my husband is a happy camper...and even I like it.  I will make this recipe often to satisfy his taster and encourage others to try it...it's nice to find a side dish that's not "worn out".  Thanks a bunch for this one...and I love this site!

I loved this recipe! My husband hates carrots and he loved them too. He had a weird childhood food alergies and could only ear carrots and bananas for 2 years. When I said I made carrots he said no way he would eat them. Everytime I make these someone asks for the recipe. I often substite croutons for the crackers. I am always out of crackers...ha,ha. Love this one!

This is an excellent way to prepare carrots. I added two ingredients to the sauce that I normally add to my own cheese sauce: a scoop of spreadable cream cheese (to make is a little more creamy) and a dash or two of cayenne pepper for a little zing. I loved the addition of the onions to the sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. I have always called this dish Scalloped Carrots. Whatever you call it, it's delicious, one of my favorite veggie recipes. I use real bread crumbs browned in butter in a skillet for the topping. Wonderful!

I followed the directions for this recipe as written and it turned out beautifully.  I will definitely use this recipe again. My picky 3 year old even ate it! This is a great way to use some of the carrots out of your garden.

This was a tasty way to make carrots.  I think next time I will add some cheez whiz to the carrots before baking to make it taste more cheesier.

This was awful.  For all the prep work this took, it tasted like "carrots".  From reading prior reviews, I was excited to find something different to do with carrots.  My husband said it was okay and wouldn't let me throw out the left overs, but I would not make this again and not reccomend this to anyone.  Sorry.

The whole family liked it. I didn't change the recipe, but I did cook the sauce in the microwave instead of stovetop. I melted the butter, added the flour and stirred. Then, I added the milk and microwaved in 2 minute increments until the sauce was thickened.

Excellent recipe!  I made no changes, followed recipe as written.  I had an abundance of carrots and wanted something other than steamed, plain carrots.  This was a great addition to my entre', my family really liked it and said to make sure I do this recipe again.  Thank you!

Cut the recipe in half (note that qty in directions do not get altered).  Very good.  Two of us ate almost the whole casserole.  It is a nice change from green veggies.

Very good casserole!  The only change I think I will make if I make it again is to cook the carrots until they are a bit more tender.  I know it's not as healthy, but I like them better that way : ).

Perhaps I didn't let the rue cook long enough because the end product still had a flour taste to it.  I think it will be a great dish once I get the cooking time down.

This recipe made me love carrots all over again! They just taste so different when they're steamed/boilled instead of crunchy (not to mention covered in an amazing sauce!) The sauce smelled so good when it was cooking, and the whole recipe came together very easily. I will definately be making this again!

While this was pretty good, i definitely felt like something was missing.  After tasting the cheesy gravy that you make, i ended up doubling the amount of cheese.  I actually liked the topping, left as is.  I might try this again, with some alterations and after looking up some other suggestions.

Fantastic!  Huge hit with all the family and a good way to get picky kids to eat carrots.

I thought this was really average, but the family seemed to like. A little time consuming to make though.

My friend who doesn't like carrots really liked this recipe.  I used dark brown sugar and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes to thicken the sauce.

I thought this was great. What a nice change for carrots. My family wasn't thrilled with it.  next time I will make a small batch just for me.

This was fine.  We ate them all.  Nice to have a different way to fix carrots.  However, I didn't think outcome was worth the trouble of fixing this on a weeknight...and we like other side dishes a lot more for special occasions.  So, I might make this again.  But not anytime soon.

Loved it! My whole family enjoyed this one and it was not difficult to make. My mother asked for the recipe, which never happens. Thanks for sharing., Loved it!

This was good.  I'd use a little seasoning salt, though, next time.  But I'll make it again!

There isn't much you could do to a carrot that our family wouldn't like.  This is a wonderful change of pace.  The taste of the sauteed onions is great in the sauce.  We'll have this again often.

I've never had carrots cooked this way before.  They were very good.  I'll take them to potlucks and serve them to company.

Pretty good.  Tastes like most vegetable casseroles.  Nice to have something different to do with carrots.

My husband gives this a 4, while I give it a 5.  I loved it. I pulled fresh carrots from the garden and made this for dinner tonight.  It was a perfect side to a grilled steak with the Horseradish Guacamole from this site.  Thanks Sharon.  I will make this again.
