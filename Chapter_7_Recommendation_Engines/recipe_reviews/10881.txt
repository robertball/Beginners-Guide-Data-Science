This is great and quick.  You just have to make sure you heat the peanut butter and chocolate together.  or it will turn out hard as a rock.  Then mix in the marshmallows.  I personally recommend the chucky peanut butter.  Also if you spread it out in a larger pan you will have more bars.   this such a rich dessert.  You can do all this in the microwave as well and that makes that much easier.

This recipe is decadently messy.  I line the bottom of the pan with graham crackers and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes to set.  I have been making this practically every other week since it goes within two days.  This recipe is so quick and easy, I cannot stop raving about it!

This recipe was easy and FAST, it only took about 5 minutes tops to melt every thing down. Not only did the fudge type gooey goodness NOT stick to the pan but left me with a pan that hardly looked used at all, it just kinda slid out. Excellent and delicious. Thanx for a great recipe.

This was the most disgusting cake I've ever tasted! I was so surprised when I saw it had five stars... It stuck to the pan, was hard as rock and onlt tasted like burnt peanut butter. I do not recomment to do this recipe, especially if you are doing it last minute because you will be disappointed.

we put gram crackers on the top, then cut into gram cracker sized pieces! It helped with the mess and also added a great smore like flavor. Next time we are going to prepare in microwave heating and stiring ever 30 seconds.

A great treat.  I used super chunk peanut butter and cut down a bit on the chocolate chips .  Best if kept in the fridge as they get gooy left out.
I wasn't sure whether to cool the melted chips before adding the marshmallows so just waited a minute or two.  Some of the marshmallows melted and it looked great.

I tried making this recipe two different ways.  The first time I melted the marshmallows completely, and used the chunky peanut butter also. It could be compared to a lighter kind of fudge, it was fantastic.  The second I followed the original recipe and enjoyed them just as well.

Make sure you mix the chocolate and shortening together and if you want to ensure it doesn't get too hard, add a tablespoon of butter flavored shortening. Delicious.

Delicious! I melted everything in the microwave as I've always had problems melting chocolate on the stove.  I wish I had pretzels like a previous reviewer . . . that would be very delicious.  Or, maybe some salted peanuts.

Used chunky peanut butter for texture. Also made a batch without marshmallows for my hubby who hates them. In his I broke up about 10-12 ginger snaps. He really liked it!

i don't know why people say that it's messy and all. because it's not at all!! they turned out really really good! and it took only 10 mins!! Try using equal amounts of peanut butter and chocolate chips, then melt all the marshmallows totally. it'll become fudge like, and i didn't even need to cool it before i could eat it! and because of more peanut butter, it makes it taste like REESES! the peanut butter cups. i melted some marshmallows on top and put sprinkles too. addition of nuts will taste good too.

I had to give this recipe 5 stars. It was so simple but everyone loved it so much. I now have people asking me to make them pans of it. I added a little extra touch though. After I put it all in the pan, I melted peanut butter and drzzled it over the top, just to make it look extra-nice. Thanks so much for the great recipe. I've already made it a few times, and will continue to make it.

I questioned this because of the peanut butter but tried it anyways and boy am I glad that I did. This is soooooo easy! And the taste is really good! I don't think that it would be as good with smooth peanut butter though.

This was really easy and yummy - the kids all 'helped' and loved the resulting product.

I broke up a bunch of stick pretzels to add crunch and that saltiness.  Highly recommended!!!  I'm sure the kids would have devoured it without the pretzels but they made all the difference to me.  Yum.

Lol.. someone wrote this was a disgusting cake!   Not a cake but Rocky Road is a "chocolate mashmallow coated candy"... I really wish I had graham crackers so I can make it like cookie bars but I will try that next time; Just a super easy treat when you are craving something sweet!  I added some chopped nuts.  Thx.

I feel fatter already. Quick treat for a sweet tooth but not quite 5 stars. Pretty sweet & I wouldn't give these to little ones unless there was a sink nearby. I added the graham cracker base as other reviewers did. It cut down on the sweetness.

The basic equivalent to marshmallow no-bake cookies. Marshmallows will melt after mixing in the chocolate once taken off the stove, unless the chocolate mixture is cooled before adding marshmallows.

Mini Marshmallows should be left whole ---stirred in after choc-peanut butter is melted, to give the bumpy, Rocky Road effect. Using Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Morsels made this extra good for my tastes!

Although they didn't turn out how I expected them to, they were great! I used what I had on hand: CRUNCHY peanut butter, MINI semi-sweet chocolate chips, and MINI marshmallows. It took about 7 minutes for the c.chips and PB to become smooth and fully melt in the pan (on LOW heat). I recommend stirring very frequently, if not continuously as not to overcook. I was under the impression that the marshmallows were supposed to melt when added to the warm chocolate/PB mixture. They did not. They softened a bit as I stirred them in, but never melted. I thought this was going to be a smoother (more fudge-like)dessert? I spread into pan and then had an idea. I coarsely broke up about 12 pretzel rods and sprinkled them top! I used a spatula to push down the pretzel pieces so they would stick to the top of the bars. I think pretzel pieces would make a great "crust" for these treats as well! I covered my pan with plastic wrap and put in fridge for a few hours. I thought they tasted great (even though the marshmallow texture was way different than I expected) and they were a BIG hit with my family! I will make this again and try adding a pretzel layer on the bottom as well. :) Thanks for a delicious and EASY recipe!

Update: made this a second time, and I mixed the marshmallows in while the chocolate/peanut butter was melting because my husband doesn't like marshmallows (didn't want him to know they were there!). I love this recipe and have added it to my permenant recipe file. Thanks! Original review: Wow---this recipe satisfied a chocolate craving! I halved the recipe... I didn't have quite enough choc. chips so I used 1/2 cup choc. chips + 3 squares of semisweet baker's chocolate. I also had to use large marshmallows, so I just used 2 hand fulls of those. Put in a sqaure baking pan covered with wax paper to cool. Thanks for the post!

I used half semi-sweet chocolate and half dark chocolate because there wasn't enough semi-sweet. It turns out really good! Everyone loves it!
Thanks!

I cut the recipe in half since I only had a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. The peanut butter was not overpowering at all.  I wasn't sure if the marshmallows were suppose to melt at all but some of them did. It wasn't really messy...didn't stick to the pan at all once I started stirring in the marshmallows. In fact, it kinda cleaned it up. It was too gooey to pour though so I'm not sure if the consistency was right but they tasted great! The only complaint I have is that it was difficult to cut but I think letting it sit a little bit at room temperature or using a different knife will solve that. I need to be careful with this recipe though because it's just so good and will probably result in weight gain...

I have changed my mind about this treat. I thought they were too gooey, but after they sat in the fridge overnight, they were surprisingly good! Line the pan with tin foil for easy serving and cleanup. Next time I might try chocolate and mint instead of PB. I just thought the PB taste was too strong. Marshmallows get the best texture when cold!

I think this was delicious. I added graham crackers to top and bottom, chilled, cut into 4 "strips" and coated strips in chocolate and then sliced. (I was going for Katella Deli's rocky road.) It was messy, but it also added another dimension to this confection. I think next time I will make it in the 9x9 pan with no graham crackers. I might eat too much, though.

Yum!! Wanted a quick sweet snack on a rainy afternoon, and this fit the bill!! Didn't even bother to wait for it to cool, enjoyed it with spoons. I stirred Graham cracker pieces into half of it, and that was a different good. Definitely keeping this one!

This is fabulously tasty and so easy even though it tastes like you spent a ton of time on it. I mixed part of the marshmallows in and left part of them in the pan so the chocolate got poured directly over them. Heavenly....This is easily the best tasting quick dessert Ive ever made.

Made this for a open house/dinner I had last night. I did do as a review said and added more peanut butter. I made 2 batches the first I melted the marshmellows on stove with it till swirlled. It looked very elegant...the other batch I topped with marshmellows, chocolate chips and peanuts then broiled till marshmellows were lightly browned. These were the first to go and everyone wanted the recipe.

I gave it 4 stars because I put it in the pan and it just looked like it was going to be way too thick and bulky, so I dropped it in mounds on waxed paper instead.  For an easy and quick treat, this is great!

Too simple to be this good! I cut the recipe in half, made sure the marshmallows melted completely and spread it on waxed paper to ensure no sticking.  Next time I will use chunky peanut butter or maybe add some nuts to get more texture.  This recipe can be played with so much by using different extracts, nuts, and chips.

Pretty yummy and VERY easy no-nonsense fudge, basically! Followed others' suggestion of chunky peanut butter and loved the little bit of peanut crunch without having to chop peanuts (or almonds, which are the traditional nut in rocky road). I was short on mini-marshmallows (we use them as rewards for potty training) so I used 1/3 jar of marshmallow creme to replace the missing minis. Blended in nicely and then most of the marshmallows stayed whole and gooey. Very nice!... Or should I say very naughty?

I found this disgusting.  Waaay too rich, and the flavor was not redeeming.  

I made these seeing three delicious ingredients, and thinking "What could go wrong?"
Unfortunately, this recipe was my answer.

I would have given them one star, except my boyfriend found them edible somehow.

Id have to admit that were not chocolate lovers but this recipe seemed promising and might change the way I thought about chocolate, since I love rocky road ice cream. I was disapointed in the flavor and texture. My 11 year old didn't like it either. Sorry

Bored and searching for a simple tasty treat to make, i chose this. I substituted a 9x9 pan for an 8x8, lacking the suggested. Not exactly a good thing, making them thicker, creating more difficulty in eating and more melting in my hand. After much patience, of cooling in both fridge and freezer, i tried one, and was slightly disappointed with the taste, yet the marshmellows added a very intriguing chewiness, keeping me wanting more. If a 16 year old can make these come out, anyone can. All in all: YUM!

This recipe single-handedly contributed to several pounds gained during my pregnancy. I love it! It does turn out a bit soft and gooey, which I love, but the fridge fixes that issue.

This was delicious, HOWEVER it was difficult and very messy to eat because of the gooeyness. It was like a thick fudge frosting. Next time I would try cutting the peanut butter in half to see if that gives it a firmer structure. This is not a recipe to be eaten right away - took about 3 hours to firm up in the fridge, but then I didn't like how the marshmallows got too chewy when cold.  So I put it back on the counter but it got too soft again.  I also added 1/2 cup of broken walnuts to give it some crunch.  I would definitely try it again with less peanut butter.

11/5/03  Tried with less peanut butter and it didn't change a thing regarding the firmness.  Will try another recipe as I like the chocolate in my rocky road sort of crunchy.

Easy recipe.  I added coconut flakes to the mix since I didn’t have enough marshmallows and I layered the bottom of the pan with graham crackers as another reviewer suggested.   It was a great idea!

Was easy and quick to make. I made a double-batch and used a 9x13" pan greased with butter. I melted the chocolate in a bowl over a a pan of boling water. I turned the burner off and stirred in the peanut butter, then removed the dish from atop the pan of boiling water and stirred in the marshmallows as the mixture began cooling which helped to keep all the marshmallows from melting into the mixture.  I quickly scraped the mixture into the buttered pan. Once totally cooled on the counter-top (I did not refrigerate) I cut into one inch squares and placed in a  covered plastic  storage container. Overnight they hardened somewhat so I covered the candy with dampened paper towels and placed them in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften them, from then on they remained soft. I will definitely make them again and again!

I added some extra marshmallows plus sometimes I make a gram cracker crust using just some crushed gram crackers and melted butter. I like to make it in layers when I add a gram cracker crust. first layer gram cracker crust, second layer the rocky road mix and third layer the left over gram cracker crust then I put it in the Frig. I will sometimes make it without the gram cracker crust as well. I make it for my family or friends sens I'm not a chocolate fan.

So easy it's crazy!  I wouldn't bother with the stove, I used a glass bowl in the microwave.  I mixed the peanut butter and chocolate chips together and used 30 second intervals with mixing.  It was thoroughly melted and blended after two rounds.  I forgot to grease the pan, but it's just for me anyway.  Personally I smashed up some Teddy Grahams (didn't have graham crackers) and sprinkled it over the top for some crunch and a "s'mores" type taste.  Yummy!

only three stars because, while it was very quick and easy for me to make with my 4 year old, it was not nearly as awesome as some of the other reviews led me to believe. (it was pretty much exactly as you would think melted choc chips and peanut butter would taste together with marshmallows thrown in - good, but nothing spectacular). also, my chocolate/peanut butter mixture started to become quite hard as i was stirring/melting it and at the end i had a really hard time mixing in the marshmallows. i am assuming i cooked it too long. so it would be helpful if the recipe were to state "only cook just until melted".

I made this to use up some left over marshmallows, and it came out as I expected from others' reviews.  I melted the chocolate, peanut butter, and marshmallows together and it only took 10 min, talk about fast!  I then put in a 9x9 and stuck in the fridge for about 2.5 hours.  The results were tasty, although it was dry.  That didn't stop people from enjoying it, though.  Those who didn't make it couldn't tell there was marshmallows in it, so maybe it's better to not melt those in but rather leave them in in their fluffy form?  I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, but I can see how that'd be even better than regular/smooth pb.

This is pretty good! I quartered the recipe because that's A LOT! I think it would be best to use JIF because I only use all natural peanut butter and it doesn't have the same consistency/thickness. It would hold up better if you did. Also, I think it'd be best to cut back on the chocolate because, although I am a chocoholic, it was too sweet. Or I suppose you could just add more peanut butter. Either way! Great recipe! Don't know what the previous poster was talking about but this isn't a cake. It's a "fudge".

It was totally easy to make.  I added M&Ms and almonds.  My brother added M&Ms and pretzel sticks and matzah.  We also used peanut butter chocolate chips instead of plain chocolate chips.  It was DELICIOUS!  We will DEFINITELY make it again.  It's a keeper.

This tasted good but I think when I make it next time I'll make sure the marshmallows get melted more.

Very good, but very rich.  I highly reccommend that you have a tall glass of milk nearby when enjoying this dessert!

This recipe was very easy and quite tasty :) I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave, rather than on the stove, then added the peanut butter and stirred until it was all mixed.  After it had cooled just a little bit, I added the marshmallows.

I can't say enough how delicious these are.  They are so easy to make and come out like they are from a candy store.  Everybody loves these.

Loved these.  I added peanuts and the extra crunch made them even better.

I make these for every potluck at work and everybody goes nuts over them.  I recommed freezing them overnight because they will be much easier to cut the next day.

Love it
How can you not have these things on hand? It really hits the spot when you want something quick, easy, and sweet.

This was so simple to make!  I am not a big peanut butter fan, but I thought these were pretty good.

Very easy and good!  I put it in the fridge to firm it up.  I might consider adding some nuts next time I make this.
