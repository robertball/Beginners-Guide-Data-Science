I gave this just 4 stars because we never added walnuts.  My grandfather was from Canada and he made this every year for the holidays.  Instead of saltine crackers, we add a package pf Pepperidge Farm stuffing, an egg and a can of beef consume before putting it in the oven.   Thanks for sharing this recipe, Ron.  I think I'll try the walnuts this year!

The Thanksgiving turkey was always stuffed with pork stuffing (made in advance) and nothing else, then baked immediately. (usually beginning around 4am).    This recipe isn't exactly the same as , as it varied wildly between households, though I'm sure this one is very good.  My mom used salt and pepper and poultry seasoning only. She's made a huge batch. Half was for the stuffing, then she amended the spices and made gorton.
