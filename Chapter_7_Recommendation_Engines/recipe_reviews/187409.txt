Yay!  I get to be the first to review this recipe.  These are SO good!  I didn't have any walnuts, but I contacted the submitter through the Recipe Exchange and she said any kind of nut will work.  I chopped up some sliced almonds to put in the cream cheese mixture and garnished each strawberry with a whole slice of almond.  YUM!  I'll definitely make these again soon!

Yummy. I altered the recipe a little by adding a little more sugar, a little vanilla and topped it off with graham cracker crumbs.  It's like a strawberry cheesecake inside out.

This is very nice.  I did not add any nuts but I did put in a small splash of vanilla.  It looks so pretty.  This would be nice to take to a baby or bridal shower.  THX

These are a nice option to a fancy dessert, but not spectacular in my opinion. I crushed up vanilla wafers and added that instead of nuts. I also took reviewer's suggestions and added a dash of vanilla. Then, I dipped them in chocolate!

Just made these for our Easter meal.  Both my husband and ten year old son loved them.  I didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans.  I processed them with the cream cheese and sugar together, then put them in a ziploc baggie, cut out the corner, and filled the berries.  Then, I sprinkled crushed graham crackers over the top.  These are definitely going to be a staple in our house for parties and just for a family meal.

I make these all the time as a low carb alternative to dessert. This is the best recipe on this site for this type of stuffed strawberry. I have tried this as written and it was ok, a 4 star recipe. With these modifications they are excellent: 1/2 tsp vanilla, increase sugar to 3 tbs, and instead of nuts, drizzle dark chocolate. Now, a 5 star, sure to impress. Also, the easiest way to stuff is to take a little of the bottom so the berry 'sits', then slice off top and green, then at the top, core the berry to make a hole. This is the easiest way.

A big hit with my Sweetie! I used pecans instead of walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe.  Used a small ziplock with the corner cut off to pipe the filling.  Thanks for another great recipe Michelle!!

We are not dessert people, for us, this was an excellent "non-dessert" for a special occasion. Definitely add the vanilla!

Ok, I have reviewed this item before but I just got so excited that I had to fill you in on my "follow up" dessert. So after filling 3 pints of strawberries for a party I realized I had a lot of delicious filling left over. I looked around and found the remaining graham crackers and decided to make "ice cream" sandwiches. I put the filling between two grahams and froze them, WOW. This was the hit of the night.

these are fantastic! I added a bit more sugar because I like things sweet! but definetly will be making again I think I might just core the strawberries next time this may make them a bit prettier and less messy!

I made this for Valentine's Day for my fiance and I. I omitted the nuts because he's not a fan. It tasted great, but the method provided for stuffing didn't really work. In the future, I'd probably slightly core then slice each strawberry once. It might even be faster just to slice them entirely in half and assemble like a sandwich.

These were pretty tasty. I felt like they were missing something though. I would probably make these again but sprinkle chocolate on them or something. I also had a really hard time getting the filling in the strawberries- I cut them properly and I went almost to the bottom of the berry but I couldn't get them to open up at all and some of them barely had any cream cheese in them. I didn't find these the easiest to make- but it was probably just the berries I was using.

Tried this for a Valentine's night dessert and man was it easy and delicious. I actually just grabbed a honey walnut cream cheese from the store and it was great. Made some designs on the plate with some balsamic reduction and it was simple, elegant, and easy after a rich and labor intensive dinner!

Mine came out far less pretty than the picture.  When I added the two diced strawberries to the cream cheese, it turned an awful pink color.  Otherwise, they were ok, nothing great.  Easy, but I wouldn't make them again.

i have definitely made these on multiple occasions, each time it was a hit. i have mixed in vanilla, but have tried using orange liqueur (triple sec) and it adds a delicious and light citrus flavor. i omitted using the nuts and diced strawberries to the creamcheese mixture because the taste was not very appealing to me. highly suggest trying the recipe with triple sec and then dip the bottoms in chocolate, and drizzle the tops with chocolate as well.

It's Valentine's night and we just finished our Valentine's Night Strawberries.  So good! My husband is diabetic so we need a lower-carb alternative, and we hate artificial sweeteners.  This was perfect!  I did add vanilla extract as others suggested.  I also skipped the nuts (personal preference).  It really is like a reverse cheesecake.

I sprinkled finished strawberries with granulated sugar and extra chopped walnuts. Can't wait until those sweet summer berries are ready! Will definately make again!

Beautiful presentation and perfect for my platter of cream puffs.  I have a mix of these with some chocolate dipped strawberries AND the vanilla filled cream puffs (search all recipies for a great one)to take for a Valentine's party.  Beautiful and tasty.

I altered it alittle. I used the large stem strawberries, easier to work with. It made 12. I added more powdered sugar. Topped with chocolate sprinkles. For show i added candy hearts at the bottom of container.

Made these for our special dinner at home last night and they were very good.  I had a little trouble getting the filling in the strawberries, but I know that was attributed to me using my piping gun and the filling coming out a little fast.  We really enjoyed these after our dinner and will make again.  I do think that I might try using pecans instead of walnuts and maybe adding a splash of vanilla to the mixture.

Easier than I thought they would be, and a great Valentine's Day dessert. We paired ours with a nice dry prosecco, and the combination was perfect.

Not many ingredients. Worth the work of cutting those strawberries. The perfect bite after dinner.

Great recipe & easy enough for my 8 year old to do as well :) I took others advice by adding some vanilla and instead of using walnuts we sprinkled graham cracker crumbs on top ;-)

I make this every year for my husband and he always had a look of enjoyment on his face.  As well as he expects this yummy dessert. Thanks for the easy dessert recipe. No use my food processor.  Easy peasy.

Very good filling.  I piped the filling.  I think it would be extremely difficult to use a spoon.

No-way Jose to stuffing these babies!  Some of the other reviewers got it right with hollowing out the strawberry.  I cut the berries in half and tried to spread the fill on.  This did not work well.  It made a mess and also looked atrocious, so don't do it.

I initially tried the recipe as written, but it wasn't sweet enough for me.  I took the recommendation of adding 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and also doubled the confectioners sugar (3 Tbls.).  This simple mix IS delicious over the berries.I suggest stuffing  and just mix it all together.  Right before serving sprinkle the top with crushed graham crackers and voila... desert is served.

I used two pounds of strawberries. For filling, I used 16 oz cream cheese with 1.5 cups sifted powdered sugar and 2 tsp pure vanilla and a pinch of salt. I did have a lot of filling left over. I used those cone-shaped plastic piping bags with a star tip with 1/4" on diameter  hole. Any smaller tip was too difficult to squeeze.
I started in the center of my glass plate to get them to stand up on their cored stem ends. I kept circling the arrangement so they would stand up and support each other. 
I sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and coarse sparkle sugar.

These tasted just OK, but were messy to make and to look at.
