We've made these twice using banana peppers and serranos.  The sweetness makes these addicting and the spice of the serrano blends nicely with the flavors.

At last, something else to do with our abundance of Padron's! This recipe was a hit at deer camp with my husband and his hunting buddies.

Made this yesterday. Added yellow, orange and red peppers with onions to the jalapeños.  It reduced the heat and the Big Guy loved that because hot peppers make him perspire. These had just the right amount of heat for both of us!

I'm making this review just after making these. My pepper crop this year is Amazing!  This recipe is by far the easiest thing I've ever done! If the peppers turn out right- It will be the best recipe ever!!

Great recipe.  The red pepper flakes made this pretty hot.  I used banana peppers and I sliced them into rings.  It uses more peppers to fill the quart jar.  The next time I make this I'll leave the pepper flakes out.

We planted tooo many peppers this year and the usual loss of 1/2 our crop due to drought is reversed this year.  Much rain and an over growth of peppers.  I have Jalapenos galore and am canning for our Fall sale at church. This is an extraordinary recipe. Thank you for sharing.  Anaheim peppers are also wonderful in this recipe.

These are really good. The nice thing about padron peppers is that each is different; one is spicy, one is mild. Nice recipe, easy and straightforward.

This is an easy recipe that turns out beautiful.  I made it with whole and sliced banana and jalepeno peppers.  I did not mix the two, but may try that next time.
