The guacomole tasted great.  I don't know where the 25 minute prep time came in, but it took me only 10 minutes tops, start to finish.  I will make this again.  I didn't have a food processor, so I mixed it in a blender and added less than 1/4 cup water to help my blender mix it.  It still came out thicker than store bought and was excellent.  Next time I might use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also for hot sauce i used habanero sauce and it blended nicely with the avocados.

Great! Didn't use a processor - just chopped for a chunkier texture - squeezed in some lemon juice for a little extra zing. Took a whopping five minutes!

My husband said I made the best Guacomole he's ever had.  We like a "lumpier" guac, so I used a potato masher vs. the food processor.  I also added extra avocado's and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Turned out great!

Very good stuff, makes burritos great. I ommited the hot sauce because I like it milder but it was still wonderful.

I give this four stars as this is a great base recipe and I added my own touch. One clove of minced garlic, extra hot sauce as we like it hot, some diced red onion and some lime juice.  Not a fan of cilantro so I left it out but may chop a real small amount next time.  The key is to let it all set in the refrig for a few hours.  Great with multigrain chips and beer with lime!

I made guacamole for the first time.  It was sooo good.  i only had 3 avocados and I mashed them up to make it chunkier (and less clean up!) I used garlic paste from a jar that I already had in the fridge, some onion powder, a dash of ground coriander and the juice of half a fresh lemon.  This is a very good basic recipe, needs a bit of tweaking though to make it the best.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for our church group and had a very small amount leftover.  I added about a tablespoon of cilantro used 2 cloves of fresh garlic leftout the hot sauce because I used medium salsa and used a little lime juice.  It was great. Will definitely make again.

Very easy to make.  I just mashed the avocados and mixed everything together by hand.  No sense in dirtying the blender.  I like my guac to be a little chunkier anyway!

This was a quick and easy recipe. I used a potato masher since I like a little bit of chunks in my guacamole. I used green pepper sauce and also added 3 T. of fat free sour cream. It turned out very well and my husband loved it.

This is really good.  It is quick and I made it because it didn't call for lemon juice (I was out).  Turned out wonderful.  I did use fresh garlic and added a touch of cilantro.  Will make it again... might even add lemon.

It was good, but I like the bags of guacamole mix much better.  I found this recipe too mild, and ended up adding half a jar of salsa.  Still very good though.

Great recipe!  Was running late, guests were already here - made this in about 5 minutes and everyone raved about it!  Couldn't find the hot sauce so just used a bit more salsa.  Will make it again.

I cut it back to 6 servings, and regretted it (although I only had 3 avacados on hand).  Everything else is a staple in my house. 

I used medium extra chunky salsa, lemon juice (to help the avacado stay green, and give a nice flavor).  I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce (lots and lots!), and as someone mentioned, approximately 1/2 tbsp of cumin - what a kick and what a great flavor!

The color is a little off as it has a liquified tomatoes mixed in - but that's to be expected considering what is in it.

This is usually the way I make guac and it is so simple!  The only thing is I do not do is using a food processor.  I like guac chunkier (gives it the homemade-feel) so I usually lightly mash the avocado.  Also, this recipe depends on the salsa - use a good quality salsa not a generic one.  It really makes a difference!

Very Good flavor. I added too much salt, not considering the chips were salty. The color will be brown if you do not mix 1 tbsp  lemon juice, taste GREAT. Beats any mexican resturant salsa!

This was so easy and we loved this! I make a lot of guacamole and tried a lot of recipes so for DH to even comment on it being good, then it was obviously better than average. Skip the food processor and just use a fork to mash the avocado right in the serving bowl, no need to dirty an appliance. Don't bother with slicing them either, just cut in half and scoop the flesh out with a spoon. I add a splash of lime juice to mine too because that is how we do it.

This is great guacamole.  Add some lime juice to help it keep its color.  I also added some cumin for extra zing.  Yummy, easy and everybody loves it.  Also put a couple pits back in to help it keep it fresh.

I'm not a big salsa fan but my family loves it so I decided to give this a try. I added a few more seasonings and lemon juice and I even liked it. Thanks Shari!

We liked this.  After I made it I added another chopped avocado for chunks.

Totally yummy and easy too. My husband made some homemade salsa to put in it (tomatoes, jalepenos, cilantro to taste, gobs of garlic, salt, pepper and lemon juice-- all to taste and made in a food processor)Our family ate two batches of the guacomole and used it instead of avacado on the Baked Mexican Fish recipe on this site. It was just great. We will make it again.

Great taste but I also added cilantro, a touch of lime juice and a couple chopped up grape tomatoes. I also like it chunkier so I mashed rather than processed it.

Added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and some sour cream (probably about 1/2 cup) Let it sit for about an hour in the fridge which deffinetly helped the flavours to blend :)

I'm not rating this, because I did not follow it very closely, but I wanted to comment on the concept.  I really like the guacamole/ salsa combo; I made a combination of this recipe and a more traditional guacomole: avocado, salsa, garlic, onion, lime juice, and salt.  Yum!

An quick and easy way to make guacamole if you don't have all the standards on hand. I just used a fork to mash like others.  I also added some cumin, black pepper, and lemon juice for some added flavor.  Thanks for the quick recipe!  (it definitely does not take 25 minutes!)

This is quite good. Definitely use high quality salsa. It will make or break the outcome. I did not care for the texture. Next time, I will not use a food processor. Thank you for the recipe.

This is such a fast and easy way to make guacamole, especially when you scale the recipe down to 2 servings (1 avocado), there's no reason to use a food processor. Make sure you drain the salsa a bit. I use about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt in place of garlic powder and salt. And I just keep shaking the hot pepper sauce until it tastes the way I like. (I've been using this recipe for years, but have never rated it.)

It is a very good recipe. I had only one avocado but it still tastes good with less. I added lime juice and it made it even better. I will defiantly make it again

Very good- i made less then 1/2 the recipe, I used rotel tomatoes with green chilies instead of salsa, nice consistency.  No need for food processor. Garlic is a plus, thanks.

Excellent.   However I learned this go-to trick at a San Antonio restaurant on my honeymoon:  grate in some white onion (the onion juice adds a nice kick) and use some fresh squeezed orange juice along with the lime.  Yum!
