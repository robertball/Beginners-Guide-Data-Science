I did not have Rice Krispies BUT I did have Rice Chex. I used that instead. This turned out well but I think I would use peanut butter chips next time instead of Reese's Pieces, that's really just a personal choice. This reminds me of White Trash Candy. The kids and I loved it.

I'm not a huge white chocolate fan, so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this.  However, it really works!  It comes together in minutes and a nice salty/sweet snack.  THANKS for the recipe, Jessica!
