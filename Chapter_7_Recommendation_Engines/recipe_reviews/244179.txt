Made as written except that I could not find habanero peppers and had to substitute with Serrano's which ended up being a good thing. I think habanero would have been too hot and masked the other great flavors and that is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. This dish is super simple and flavorful and I will make again when my banana peppers from the garden are ready.

I can't eat habs so used jalapeno instead. The spices coupled with the hot pepper totally overwhelmed this delicate fish in my opinion. Perhaps just with banana peppers for me? If you LOVE hot, you may like this recipe.
