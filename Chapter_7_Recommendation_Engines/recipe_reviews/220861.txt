Just made this tonight and was fabulous. A few changes like most cooks - omitted the sugar, added 3 stalks of celery, cut in 2 inch segments and didn't coat the meat with flour. Because I had almost double the meat, I browned the beef in divided batches, then added everything else. My 6 qt pot was pretty full so had to remove some liquid to leave the required 1/3 space at the top. ( Very important!)  Also thickened mine with cornstarch. All minor changes. Very nice beef stew recipe that went from conception to table in 1 hour!  Love it!

Thanks Kelly! ... With our changes to meet our tastes, this is the best beef stew I've ever enjoyed to date! [and we are in our fifties] 

We made this particular recipe tonight for supper with the following changes: 

- substituted beef broth for water and bouillon, = more hearty flavor profile and less salt
- added 1 3/4 cups of Cotes-Du-Rhone red wine into pot (moderately dry, great body, excellent with beef) it makes the broth robust and hearty in its flavor!
...  -  cooked onions in pot with broth, wine, 3/4"  pieces of celery,  garlic and herbs
- after setting aside the browned beef, added mushrooms to skillet with butter to saute' / deglaze =  a better "earthy" flavor component, and great with red wine!

Of course the wine alcohol cooks out, with the wine adding to the hearty flavor profile, and leaving just a small wine flavor that only is identified as a final flavor note in each spoonful.

This recipe is now the base recipe for our future beef stews. 
Future versions will include:
- adding corn, and green beans(consider deleting celery to control liquids)etc.; for variation at times. (also are excellent versions of a beef stew)

Very good recipe that can be easily modified per the chef's taste and ingredients on hand. I dropped the sugar and flour. The resulting broth was thinner, which is how I like it.  I would not use bullion cubes but the low-sodium beef broth in a carton. This time I was out, so substituted 2 cups of red wine. Was out of parsley. Used an entire 1 lb. bag of baby carrots; think it was a little more than 2 cups. Added 1 peeled and cubed rutabaga. Turned out great and in record time!

This is a great recipe the only additions I made was I added dry onion soup mix and I used italian seasoning instead of basil.  I also marinated my beef with worcesteshire sauce, balsamic vinegar and steak seasoning then browned with flour. Added some celery and used beef broth...YUM.

We enjoy this stew, and like most reviews I did make a few changes. I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper before dredging the meat. I don't usually have bouillon on hand so I used beef broth and also added two stalks of celery hearts. I didn't have baby carrots so I used four large carrots that I left large as we like our veggies a little crisper. I will probably make this again but would sub summer savory for the basil for a more traditional stew.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe. I made this for the first time and using pressure cooker for the first time.  I had double the meat so I doubled the flour, added Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke while it was frying. I added an extra cup of water, an extra bay leaf, 2 extra potatoes 5 stalks of celery and it seemed like a ton of salt!

Wow this was delicious! Just bought a Ninja Foodi and this was my first recipe using it! I forgot the sugar but it doesn’t need it and I won’t use it in the future.

I really enjoyed the meal and came together easily.  Next time I am going to add 1 table spoon of sugar; it was just a little sweet for my preference (not candy sweet).  I cooked the meal at lunch time.  I put the pressure cooker (electronic) at 165 warm setting until dinner time.  All the flavors absorbed in to the food.

This was crazy good! I have never used basil or parsley in a stew before but was I ever pleasantly surprised. I also had never used flour to brown the meat. I think that was a key feature in the taste of this stew. Excellent and I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups beef broth and 1/2 cup dry red wine instead of water and beef bullion cube. It came out delicious. my husband loved it. We had crusty bread with it.

This was delicious!! I made it in the Instant Pot and it was so good! The meat was very tender and the veggies were cooked perfectly. The only thing I did was add some portabella mushrooms that we needed to use up and I thought it came out a little thin for my family's liking so I thickened the juices with flour/water. There were no leftovers and my whole family declared this is a definite repeat.

I made this in my Instant Pot® and did all the sauteeing in that instead of on the stovetop. I also used beef stock instead of water and bouillon. After the pressure built, I realized that I completely forgot the sugar. Next time! Delicious stew in no time flat!

Double the ingredients for a bigger family, and it turned out great. I did do the liquid and seasoning heating in a pot on the stove and then transferred to the preasure cooker.

Hi i have a question about the type of pressure cooker i have. Mine is an electric and i have settings for pressure, steam, brown. Then i can set the psi and time. So for this recipe i must flour meat and brown over stove then add all to my pressure cooker and set the valve to pressure and how many minutes. Do i release the valve or let it release on its own. Again i am new to cooking with pressure so be kind. Im giving it a 4 star cause of reviews Thanks

I think I added a little too much water, so boiled it down a bit before we ate. I added tamarind paste, sweet potatoes and peanut butter, instead of potatoes, tomatoes and flour. It was a good basic recipe.

this was delicious.    I added 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce.  Next time will need more carrots and will increase by 1.5 cups of water.
