Oh. My. Goodness. Just finished eating dinner and it was awesome. I used 4 pounds of short ribs and doubled the sauce on the advice of other reviewers. I did reduce the sugar and would reduce it even more next time. I didn't have any chile sauce so I used ketchup and some hot sauce, a nice dry red wine and half a can of beef broth. Cooked these ribs in my crock pot on high for 2 hours and then on low for about 4 hours. The bones all fell out of the meat and I didn't even need a knife to cut through! Be sure to skim the fat off before you boil the sauce at the end of cooking. Served this with mashed yukon gold potatoes to catch all that yummy gravy and steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Next time I will reduce the sugar a little more and maybe add a bay leaf and some herbs like rosemary and thyme. Can't wait to attack those leftovers tomorrow!

I made a few changes to this recipe.
Instead of the 1/4 c of water, I used extra red wine.  I also only used 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar total.  I write this because I doubled the sauce, as others suggested, and I strongly suggest doing, as well.  Brown the sort ribs in a bit of olive oil before putting them in the slow cooker.  We both really liked the way this turned out.

These are very tasty, with a nice sweet-sour flavor.  I wondered about the chili powder in a German recipe, but it was good.  I made these for a potluck dinner at church and all that was left were a couple of rib bones and some sauce.  I didn't find it necessary to thicken the sauce at the end with the flour-water mixture.  Also, I took a hint from another slow cooker recipe for short ribs and cooked these the day before, then refrigerated overnight.  All the fat congealed on the top and was easy to remove.  I then just reheated for the dinner.

This was better than the short ribs at Bouchon in Vegas.  I made a few changes:
-browned and slow cooked in dutch oven for 6 hours
-used ketchup instead of chili sauce
-to thicken at the end, I took out the ribs and put it on high heat while stirring reducing the sauce by 50%.

I have used a very similar recipe as this for years. My recipes' portions are a little different. IT IS GREASY!  Here's a tip:  More than double the sauce. Set half of the sauce aside.  About 30 to 60 mins. before serving I strain the sauce from the crock pot and add the sauce that I had set aside.  I freeze the strained sauce in an ice cube tray, after frozen I put into a freezer bag and put one or two into beef soups and gravy.  Good luck and thanks for the recipe.

this was amazing. Served it over mashed potatos in a bowl and WOW.....my husband was a little leary of this saying it kind of tasted like sweet and sour until we put it over the mashed potatos and then even he ate a whole bowl of it....the only issue next time may be to leave out the vinegar....otherwise everyone thought this was wonderful and it is a new comfort food meal. As a note, I made with boneless short ribs and they kind of fell apart they were so tender, which was perfect over teh mashed potatos....reminds me of something you might get in a soul food restaurant down in the south, oddly....A must try!!! oh and have your butcher at your grocery store trim all the fat off of the short ribs ahead of time, takes them about a minute and cuts down on the fat...I had no fat buildup by doing this...they do it for free, you just have to ask!

This is absolutely delicious, especially the sauce it makes. My fiance thinks short ribs are a little "too fatty" so next time I think I will try making a chuck roast using this recipe. Highly recommend this recipe. Oh, also, I didn't use a slow cooker. Just browned in a dutch oven and finished in a  325 degree oven for about 3 hours. Perfectly tender.

These ribs are amazing!  Wonderful flavor.  My husband actually dreamt about them, so we had the leftovers for dinner the following night - he never eats leftovers.  I made them 3 days ago, and he's already asked for them again.  I used boneless beef chuck ribs and followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is so delicious! I've made it several times and get rave reviews. I love opening the door after work and smelling these short ribs ready and waiting for me! Sometimes when I'm pressed for time I'll skip the browning part with no problem. Once I was out of chili sauce so I used a little ketchup, brown sugar and some chili powder with good results. When I want to come home from work with a great dinner already made, this is the recipe I reach for.

My family loved this recipe!!  It was a different taste for us and we will definately make this one again.  However, we had a difficult time finding the beef short ribs and actually never did.  Instead we used boneless beef country ribs, which cooked in about 5 hrs.  They made great leftovers, shredded and put in a sandwich!!

Big hit for our 8 person dinner party. Paired it with my mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables (Brussels sprouts, turnips, yams, red onion, garlic-finished with a little balsamic vinegar) for a perfectly rounded meal. Greasy? I've heard others make this remark and here's the fix. Make these a day in advance, remove ribs and meat to a pan and cover with plastic wrap and foil and refrigerate. Place remaining sauce in fridge over night. The next day, remove fat layer that has congealed. I then take the sauce and transferred it to another pan at this point and finished it adding the seasonings. Transfer the ribs back to the now cleaned crock pot, separating even more of the fat, but keeping that wonderful jelly! Place the sauce over the ribs and put the crock pot back to warm 2 hours before you serve. Awesome! Present the ribs on platter. Ladle sauce as they like and then take the extra and place in bowl so your guests can add more at the table. They'll love it!

Very good overall.  Doubled the sauce.  Used half sweet chili sauce and half ketchup.  Added 1 diced carrot, 1 diced red bell pepper 1 can chicken stock and 2 extra Tablespoons cider vinegar.  Salted and peppered then dusted w/ flour.  Sauteed the veggies in the stockpot used to brown the meat and deglazed w/ the wine and stock.  Cooked in heavy pot in 325 degree oven for 3 hours.  Removed meat, blended remianing stock w/ immersion blender and reduced by half.  Returned meat to coat.

Followed this recipe to a "T" and a cheap piece of tough beef came out as tender as premium cuts. Served it with horseradish mashed potatoes, sauteed leek and a green salad with balsamic vinegrette.. It was a perfect meal! Will definitely make this one again...

Made this just as written and they were good. Next time I will totally skip the flouring/browning in the skillet step because this just made an additional mess and the soggy coating was not pleasant to look at in the final dish. It might add a tad more flavor BUT the flour in the final step was plenty for us. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

Great recipe, but we didn't care for the cut of meat (beef short ribs).  Too fatty.  We will try this recipe again with a different cut of meat and I am sure it will be a much more complimentary outcome for this very yummy recipe.

This came out well, no major issues with the cooking. However, flavor was off. Way too sweet, not enough flavor depth, perhaps decreasing the sweetness woud change this? Between the chili sauce and brown sugar it was just to much.

Awesome!  This is the first time I have every attempted to do ribs and they were fabulous! My husband is a picky eater, but I got rave reviews on this one.  I used boneless ribs and they were great, not greasy at all.  I browned them slightly first, but did not use flour.  I used a spicy bbq sauce instead of the chili sauce.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1 Tbsp as suggested by others since I'm not big on my meat being sweet.  I didn't have regular vinegar, so I used balsalmic vinegar and it gave it a really nice flavor.  I also threw in a tsp. of minced garlic.

OMG, these were outstanding!  Three different people stopped over my house today and all three of them were raving about how good my house smelled!  I followed the recipe to a T until the end.  I removed the meat and bones from the sauce and then started the thickening process.  I removed the bones (which wasn't hard to do since the meat fell right off of them) then added the meat back into the thickened sauce.  These are fantastic served over mashed potatoes.  Hubby went back for thirds - - we have a winner.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Peg13!

This was excellent. I doubled the sauce as others suggested.  The only change I would make next time is to use less sugar, as it was a little sweet for my taste.

These ribs are unbelievably good. I didn't have any chili sauce so I used picante sauce. Also, because it's impossible for me to make a recipe without garlic, I added some garlic powder (about a tablespoon if I remember right). It was so good. The ribs were deliciously tender (I used boneless ribs), and the sauce was yummy over rice.

I'll definitely make this again! The perfect thing on a cold Alaskan day.

We are in the middle of moving, so I wanted to use ingredients on hand.  Slight misread for browning:  half EVOO, half butter.  Used red wine vinegar and Dijon instead of plain vinegar & dry mustard.  OK, maybe a little more Merlot than needed.  Based on other reviews, reduced brown sugar to 2 Tbsp & beef broth for water.  High for the 1st 90 minutes then switched to low.

The results were...AMAZING!  My husband demanded this become part of our Favorites Recipe Book.  The bones fell right off and the meat melted on your tongue.  I DID have to spoon off a good amount of fat before thickening the sauce & will maybe do the day before as one review advised.  We served it over mashed potatoes but egg noodles or rice are in the future.

I made this recipe today.  I don't know about the heritage, German, not German, but it was excellent!  I made a couple of changes such as white wine instead of red, chilli paste instead of sauce beacause that is what I had on hand.  The type of vinegar wasn't specific and I used Apple Cider.  I also added garlic and two bay leaves.  I also did my browning a little differently.  I made a flour/salt/pepper mixture in a bag and shook the ribs, a few pieces at time in the bag and browned each rib adding Olive oil when needed.  After they were all browned, I added them to the crock along with the left over pan drippings.  The little extra flour and the pan remainings caused the sauce to thicken just right in the crock and I didn't have to thicken it in the end.  

I invited my son/daugter-in law, 2 grand children, niece and great nephew to dinner for this meal and they loved it.  I served it with home-made string beans (cooked with turkey necks, onions, garlic) and Rosemary, Garlic Mashed potatoes.  

Thanks a lot!  

PS.  The aroma was simply wonderful!

These turned out great.  I skipped the browning part, and used beef broth instead of red wine.  I used lean, boneless beef ribs and they were so good and tender.  The sauce thickened up nicely with the flour and tasted great over mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Served with "Carmel's Crunchy Pea Salad" from this site.  Delicious!

I gave these a 4 star because of the sauce(which is excellent) but I think next time I will try country ribs and double the sauce.

Good, but beef sort ribs are a little expensive for my buget. I used boneless short ribs ( they were leaner) and was disappointed.  Tasted like chuck roast that was cut into riblets (maybe it was)---they cost twice as much as chuck roast!   If I made this again I would use pork ribs,I actually think they would be better.

I made this for dinner tonight using boneless chuck ribs.  I had to substitute Hoisin Sauce for the Chile sauce, which I didn't have.  It was nothing short of spectacular.  My husband cleaned the crock pot out with Italian bread!  Definitely a company/holiday meal.

I give this stars because the flavor is really yummy, but it reminded us why we don't make beef ribs...they are a lot of work for little meat. That was the only problem with this recipe. There was so much fat in the pot and not much meat! I cooled the sauce and scooped out as much fat as I could before adding the flour. Again, great flavor so we are going to try this again, but with a roast instead.

These are fabulous!!  My picky husband requested them for our Christmas Eve meal, in place of my ham which he really loves.  They had a great hint of spice/heat that really made them delicious.  I only made 1.5 lbs of ribs but still made the same amount of sauce and was glad that I did.  We'll make these again and again.

This was easy and very tasty. I opted not to flour the meat before browing. I was out of mustard powder and did use slightly crushed mustard seed along with 2 allspice berries in a tea ball (for easy removal). I used 6 lbs. of beef short ribs and tripled the sauce (but used only double the sugar). These newer slow cookers cook at too high a temp. even on the low setting, unfortunately, and the ribs were falling off the bone when I checked at 5 hours, but I let it go 2 hours more until dinner time. Removed the meat, used a Trudeau gravy/fat separator, and then returned the liquid to the Crock Pot whisking in some potato flakes as the gravy thickener. Returned meat to the pot (all the bones had come away from the meat) to reheat. Served along with noodles and German Red Cabbage from this site. Will definitely make this again, trying trimmed chunks of chuck roast

We loved this. Served it over mashed skin-on potatoes. (Next time, spatzle!)Yes, short ribs are fatty and tough cut of beef, but crockpot cooking is perfect for them. With that said, perhaps as a test, I will try adding a few chuck short ribs the next time, less fatty according to http://www.beeffoodservice.com/Cuts/Info.aspx?Code=20. (I have to say, I never actually used beef short ribs before and when I unwrapped my order, I was a little shocked at how much fat seemed to be there! Worried me a little) I did trim some fat off before browning. I also doubled the sauce ingredients. I used a 12 oz bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce and regular white vinegar. However, you really only need half, maybe even a quarter of the sauce at the end to make the gravy. I did use one of those fat-skimming pitchers as others did, and it worked well. These needed all 8 hours on low to fall off the bone. I will make this again.

These were really great!  They fell off the bone after cooking.  Instead of chile sauce, I used some leftover tomato sauce, brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon, allspice and ground cloves.  I also added one minced garlic clove and a dash of liquid smoke.  Did I mention that these were fabulous?!!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about them...

This was very good. But then let's face it, short ribs slow cooked are always good. I used a dutch oven and cooked the whole shebang at 350 after browning (after dredging in flour) on the stove top.  Also, used crushed tomatoes instead of chile sauce - omitted the water as a result - and added some hot sauce and lemon juice. Served over roast garlic and horseradish mashed potatoes it was fabulous. Try it on a cool autumn day, it's food for the soul.

Very flavorful and tasty.  I did use a baster to skim most of the fat off and then refrigerated it overnight and got the rest of the oil of.  They were tasty and tender.

This was really amazing, but too spicy for my typically spicy-loving husband. I used Siracaha hot chili sauce and i can only assume from other reviews that complain of too much sweetness that they are using a sweet chili sauce. The bone-in short ribs fell off the bone. YUM.  Changes we made: we seasoned the meat with salt and pepper only before browning on the grill for about 20 minutes on low heat with hickory smoke. We added a small green pepper to the sauce, and subbed more wine for the water the recipe calls for.  I would give it five stars, but I love super-spicy food. We'll make this again, but cut the sriracha hot chili sauce a little.

Tried this recipe the first time and my friends and family loved it!
Since then I've tried several changes, and found some good regular things to do to keep the awesomeness flowing.
I found you can basically use any type of rib or amount as long as it fits in the slow cooker without changing the sauce recipe. I've done 3 to 15 pounds of bone-in and boneless short ribs, country style ribs, and spare ribs.
Generally I use a chianti for the rich, fruity flavor it gives, as well as the dryness of it. I did substitute red wine vinegar once which made it too dry in my opinion, but everyone else loved it. 
I add a quarter of a cup of Tabasco or some other type of hot sauce as well. This gives it a kick without destroying the sweetness. It can build the heat up a lot though.
Probably my favorite thing to make on a cold fall day, and definitely the most requested meal I get.

I made a number of changes to this recipe, but my result was definitely 5 star!  I had some beautiful boneless pork ribs from Costco that weren’t fatty at all – really quite lean – so I had no problems with excessive greasiness.  I skipped the flour and just seasoned my ribs with S&P and browned them.  I deglazed the pan with the red wine and scraped up all the browned bits before adding it to the crock pot.  I doubled the sauce as suggested by others, but cut back on the brown sugar and vinegar.  Instead of regular onion I used pearl onions.  And finally, I skipped the flour/water and just thickened my sauce with a little cornstarch mixed with cold water instead.  I cooked mine on low for the full 8 hours and it was fork tender.  I served this over white rice and it was delicious!

While I liked the flavor of the sauce (it was great over mashed potatoes), the ribs were too over cooked for my taste. After stewing for 8 hours, it was difficult to tell the good meat from the fatty stuff. Might make again with a different kind of rib, and cook for less time.

Since my grocery store did not have short ribs, I used Pot Roast. I also threw in a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green Chiles.
Great flavors...loved it and will definitely make again. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good, I did double all the sauce ingredients with the exception of the brown sugar, only used 2 tbs. total, next time I will use 4, it was lacking a little something.  Cooked for 9 hours due to my work sched. and the meat just fell apart, very tender.  I did think this was fatty, but still had a good flavor, the sauce was divine served over white rice cooked w/ a little beef bouillon and green peas.  The boyfriend went back for thirds!!  Will definately make again and play around with the sugar and possibly add garlic.

Very tasty but also very rich. I skimmed as much of the grease off of the top of the sauce as I could before mixing in the flour. And I made rice instead of mashed potato to serve it over. Good comfort food to have once in a while but if you're a healthy foods, lean meats person, you'll want to steer clear of this one.

I loved the flavor of this recipe.  Like someone else said, it is a little bit lik  sauerbraten without all the prep.  I added mushrooms to the crock pot and cut the brown sugar in half.  I also doubled the wine and skipped the water.  I strained the sauce  into one of those pitchers that skims the fat (I don't know what it is called but it pours off the bottom) and it was not greasy at all.  I think next time I will sautee some mushrooms instead of putting them into the crock pot and put them into the thickened sauce.  Thanks for this recipe!

These were very delicious. I started off late, so I cooked them on the stovetop instead of the crockpot and added some beef broth. It took about 3 1/2 hours on low heat-they were very tender. I didn't have dry mustard, so I used a little dijon instead. Great for a cold, rainy day.

Excellent!  This was very tasty.  It was somewhat greasy due to the fat on the meat but overall very good.  Double the sauce.  Updated:  The second time I made this, I cut as much fat off the short ribs as possible (which is not easy to do!).  The results were much less greasy.  I also cut the brown sugar down about half.   The gravy is SOOOO good but just a little bit too sweet for our taste.  This is such a great comfort meal!  Wonderful with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for sharing!

This receipe was really good!!  My husband and kids really enjoyed it.  However, I recommend making sure you use a red wine that you enjoy to drink (becuase it really does add flavour to the meat).  We loved it and it is something that we will definetly use again.

this was easy to assemble and it just cooked away there in the slow cooker.  I would probably use a little less brown sugar next time as it was just a bit sweet for me.  The gravy thickened up nicely and I served the dish over garlic mashed potatoes.  Give this one a try!

I did not have any chili sauce, so i used taco sauce in the place of it. I left out the dry wine and doubled up on the chili powder. MY 3 YR. OLD SON ATE ALL HIS MEAT!!! Some of you will never know how astounding this is. Definitely a keeper!!! Even my husband (a chef) approved with a smile!  Thanks for making me look like I can cook!

This is a really good short rib recipe! I didn't
have any red wine, so I substituted red wine
vinegar and omitted the regular vinegar-turned
out fine. Short ribs are yummy and so is this
recipe!

Almost a 5!  My daughter had seconds a couple of hours after eating this. She said she would loved it more if the sugar were cut down.  We had it with mashed potatoes but daughter and husband agreed to have it rice the next time.  Though, I didn't have a problem with it.  We used sirachabsauce instead of chiliband also used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Made this on an ice cold New England Sunday.  It came out great.  I used 4 lbs of short ribs and upped everything a bit and doubled the red wine.  My ending sauce was fairly thick and I considered not using the final flour and water mix.  In hindsight I would have been right but it still came out fine.  Next time no flour :).

We really liked this recipe. I did roast in oven (3 hrs at 300) instead of slow cooker because I had a great new pot I wanted to try. At the end when I removed the ribs, I placed the liquid in a separator to get extra fat out and then made gravy. So very delicious.

Excellent flavor!  Out of the ordinary, but not weird.  Unfortunately I used very lean boneless short ribs and I had to shred the meat so it wouldn't be so dry.  Next time I think I will probably try a chuck roast with this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!!

This was very easy to make and was happy with the way it came out. I used the crockpot and i doubled the sauce like everyone suggested.  I put extra beef broth in too. I was so afraid to make it because it was my first time making short ribs and it was for christmas eve dinner for about 20 people. But everyone that it was great and i was so happy at the end. my only suggestion would be to buy short ribs with out the bone just made things a little easier. i did not know the difference until afterward.  Very easy to a make and tasted delicious would make again.

Awesome recipe. I used boneless short ribs, approx 2 pounds. I used 1/2 hot chili sauce and 1/2 ketchup for the 1/2 cup chili sauce. It was greasy as stated by others but the sauce is delicious! I also used Tisdale Cabernet and the wine was about 8.00 a bottle. My bf really really enjoyed this recipe!

This also makes for a great sauce for stew!!

My husband and I love this recipe.  After making it several times with the beef short ribs our only complaint was that the meat was too fatty.  Today  we decided to try it with trimmed, boneless pork ribs. Now we like this recipe even more!  The sauce and meat had much less fat and the flavor was still excellent!

my husband and i just devoured these with wild and happy abandon! Will do again gladly. 1TB brown sugar was enough for us. next time will use a hotter chilie powder. also didn't need to double sauce but added 7oz. of beef broth and it was perfect.

We absolutely loved this dish.  A terrific winter comfort food.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the sauce was terrific.  I added the flour about an hour before serving and just kept them on low.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Awesome dish. Be warned though, it is hot with the amount of chile recommended (which I used, and was okay with, since we tend to like things that are on the hot side; otherwise, do tone it down). Prepared as written and LOVED everything about it (including the aroma that filled the house as it cooked). Served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, and it was a huge success. I can see using this sauce idea for other cuts of meat -- maybe even venison --  since (as another reviewer has pointed out) short ribs can be kind of fatty.

As a working mother, I am always looking for good crock pot recipes. I didn't know if the ribs should have bone in or out? Both were expensive. I bought them bone in and they were very fatty.

Wow wow wow. I loved this recipe. I made a couple very minor revisions: Doubled the sauce based on other reviewers (good call); added mushrooms; subbed ketchup for the chili sauce. 

The sauce is unbelievably good. After cooking in the crockpot for 6 hours, I removed the beef and refrigerated the sauce separate from the meat. It was easy the next day to remove the fat from the top of the sauce. I made a roux of butter and flour and slightly thickened the sauce. Added the beef to reheat and served over mashed potatoes with roasted carrots on the side.

If you don't care for or don't have short ribs, this recipe would work just fine with beef cubes or pot roast. I will definitely be making this one again.

Excellant.  I followed the sauce recipe to a "T".  Trimed much of the fat and removal of the rib skin layer, as I used beff ribs instead of short ribs.  The sauce was sweet and tangy but made great meat sauce and gravy for the mashed potatoes.  Would make again

Overall, I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The only flavor that stood out was the taste of vinegar.  I tried adding sugar, garlic, shoyu, nothing seemed to help.  I was unable to find bone in short ribs so I used boneless short ribs as another reviewer suggested.  Unfortuntely, this was a mistake.  Although the meat was tender it was overcooked.  I followed the recipe and cooked on low for 6 hours.  If you use boneless shortribs, consider reducing the cooking time.  Thank you for the recipe, it sounded delicious, but not one I will try again.

Don't change a thing!!  This was awesome.  We served it with fresh corn and mashed potatoes and thought we were in heaven.

My 10 year old grandson & I made this for Father's Day.  Everyone loved it, especially the sauce!  We threw the ribs on the grill at the end for just a few minutes, and served the sauce alongside.  Both his mom & his uncle asked him for the recipe - great ending to a great day spent with him.

Made this for my husband .... something definately different for short ribs.  We LOVED them.  I will definately be making this one again.  The only thing I done differently which I won't do next time..... I didn't have any red wine, so I added red wine vingar along with the vingar.  It still came out awesome, but maybe too much of a TANG!!  hahahaha  Next time, I'll definately do the redwine.  :)  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

This was a good recipe but I didnt find them saucy enough. Next time I will 1 & 1/2 the sauce mixture. I had alot of ribs sitting on top getting all dried out which was disapointing but the ones who got to swim in the sauce all day were great. I did stir them a few times but didnt want my crock pot to lose to much heat so I had to resist messing with them to much. I used white wine as well, I dont think it would make any real difference. Will make again.

I followed the recipe as is and used my slow cooker but found the resulting meal a little greasy.  I  think the next time I try it, I might take the advise from other cooks and cool off the liquid overnight, then remove the fat layer from the top.  The sauce was very nice.

Delicious!  We didn't get around to having dinner 'til about 2 hours after the ribs were done, so they were on low in the slow cooker for the extra time, but they were still fab.  The only thing I don't like about this meal is the amount of FAT, so we won't have it often - just as a "special treat".  So very tasty!

This recipe came out great.  I did have to make a substitution for the chili sauce.  I used mostly catsup, a small amount of tomato paste and a teaspoon of horseradish sauce to equal the 1/2 cup of the chili sauce. No complaints here!

This is a great recipe.  The meat was so tender when it was finished cooking.  The sauce was wonderful too... I followed the recipe exactly, but I would add some garlic to the sauce next time.  Thanks!

First of all this isn't german. I asked my german-born and raised grandmother if she had ever heard of it, and she said no. She even asked her friends and family still living in germany. With that said- The gravy/sauce was way to thin for what it called for. I give it a 3 only b/c my kids ate it up. My husband ate the ribs but patted off the sauce. Sorry but I didn't like it one bit.

Oooooh man these are SO delicious! My boyfriend called this one, "A keeper!" About halfway through I checked on them, (the meat was already falling off the bone!) and added some garlic powder. Served with some garlic mashed potatoes and crusty bread. Will defintiely make again!!

Fantastic!! My Mom used to fix short ribs but I never got the recipe. This is close if not right on. I didn't have short ribs so I used tenderloin tips and added button mushrooms. This recipe is a 10star keeper!!

You have to cook this overnight because you will get to smell it in your sleep.  Heavenly!  I will serve this with celery-mashed potato next time.  I added extra Worstershire sauce, chile sauce, and garlic to kick it up.  We love spicy food.

This is a great come home to dinner.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce. I hate it when people make tons of modifications so I try to prepare as written, however I didn't have any dry red wine so used a white Riesling (which is sweet) it still had terific flavor and I think one of the main reasons for the booze is to tenderize anyway.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Peggy.

I had bought a four pound pack of short ribs from Costco and wasn't sure what I would do with them until I saw this recipe! I just threw a good size handful of flour into a big zip lock bag, then just eyed the flour while I added the salt and pepper and I also added garlic powder, probably at least a tablespoon! I wasn't sure what the chili sauce was suppose to be either a hot one or a sweet one so I choose a sweet one that I had in the frig. After it had been cooking for about five hour, the first three on high, I tasted the gravy/sauce, it was okay but still lacked something! I added more garlic powder, probably another teaspoon's worth and then about another three or four tablespoons more of the brown sugar. It came out great! You do have to take a spoon after it has cooked three or more hours and drain off the fat, short ribs tend to be a little greasy! We had the ribs served over egg noodles! This was a welcome change out of the rut I tend to get in when it comes to cooking dinner! I will make these again for sure!

Were these ribs ever good!!  We had to eat them with a knife and fork because the meat had all fallen off the bone....and the gravy!  Everyone at the table said they were the best ribs they had ever had.  Will definately make time and time again.  No body could believe that I had not slaved for hours to make them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Some people will really like this for its sweetness.  It was too sweet for us.  I'm looking for more of a tangy sauce.  The onions were especially sweet.  I probably won't make this again, but it wasn't bad.

I gave this 5 stars because if I made it as it says, I know it would not have been disappointing. On that note I made some modifications based on other reviews. I used fairly lean short ribs, flour and seasoning coating then browning as directed to seal in all the juices. I doubled the liquids with only  the wine (NO WATER ADDED) and 2 Knoor's beef pods 1/2 the chili sauce for fear of being too spicey. Added 1 T each Rosemary and Thyme and Trader Joes  21 seasonings. Covered bottom of crock with 1 chopped onion then added browned meat on top then more onion. Poured wine mixture over and cooked for 6 hrs. Excellent flavor and husband LOVED. Served over "short" Spatzel german noodles. The gravy didn't need to be thickened with flour at all. Perfect consistency! I add a little more chili sauce next time just to get closer to the actual recipe ingredients. The Knoor's flavor pods really do add a great deal of flavor to whatever your cooking. I add chicken pods to my chicken soup, just to punch it up and gives more chicken flavor. YUM...

This is the only recipe I need for fabulous short ribs!  The sauce creates a thick and rich gravy.  No need to change a thing - I did thicken the sauce a bit before serving.  Wish I could give it more stars!

Outstanding! I made it as written, except I doubled the sauce, which was soooo good over smashed red skinned potatoes!! The bones pulled away cleanly, and the ribs were tender and very tasty! Definitely will make this again!

Absolutely excellent, and I didn't have to change a single thing in the recipe!  The meat was outrageously expensive for what you ended up with but, other than what is out of the cook's control, I would definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!! I did however,  use a sirloin tip roast instead of the short ribs. I didn't change anything else and it came out GREAT. The second time i made it,  I doubled the sauce.  I could drink that stuff. Lol

This was WONDERFUL! I didn't have short ribs but did have sirloin steak, so I cut 4 steaks into serving-sized pieces and used that. Having read many reviews, I doubled the sauce (used 1/4 c. vinegar & 1/4 c. brown sugar for the doubled sauce--less than the recipe called for), & used white wine, since it was what I had. Also used 3/4 c. ketchup & 1/4 c. sriracha instead of chile sauce (next time will use less sriracha--too hot!). For this amount of meat, I could have tripled the sauce & will in the future. Cooked it 6 hours on low. The steaks were fairly tender, but may try longer next time. Served it over mashed potatoes. Mmm-mmm-mmm was it good anyway! My husband like it as well. I will be making it again soon. Thanks for a great and flexible recipe!

These brown up beautifully in the slow cooker without the added fat and flour of browning.  Also, used 2 tbsp cornstarch, 100 ml more of red wine mixed with 100 ml of water for thickening at the end.  Probably lightened this up by a few hundred calories.  Excellent, a keeper.

Super recipe! The aroma while it cooked made it really hard to wait for dinner. I followed the recipe exactly except for the chili sauce, which I didn't have. I used a small can of tomato sauce and about 1/4 cup of leftover enchilada sauce and squirted in a little sriracha sauce. I also had 4 lb. of meat. There was plenty of sauce to pour over the meat and the egg noodles. We're having the leftovers tonight with spatzle.

VERY intriguing flavor!  However, I seldom use short ribs because of the fat, however, I prefer to fix exactly first time to review, then I try with any changes I want to incorporate.  This was spicier than we like, as a rule, but the next time I used less.  I also had to deal with too much fat, prior to thickening.  To avoid this, I used an in-bone chuck roast (small) the second time I made this, & it was perfect.  A little sweetish (which was what really intrigued me in the first place), as well as spicy too!  I felt the sauce really complimented the meat.  Served with mashed potatoes (was thinking of Garlic Mashed, but was afraid favors wouldn't mesh, & acorn squash (from A/R site).  I was proud to have served such an "over the top" appearing comfort food meal!!!  HTH!!!    Blessings!

Excellent!  I didn't have chili sauce so I used Asian chili and garlic sauce.  It really spiced it up.  We served the gravy with polenta.

This recipe deserves a repeat.

This is a keeper! I usually slow cook short ribs in a tagine, but wanted to try a slow-cooker technique. I plan to read through the comments to see what other reviewers may have said, but I cooked it exactly as written and my husband raved about the recipe. We'll be making it many times in the future!

They smelled sour and were so fatty.  Maybe it was the cut of meat but they were freshly butchered short ribs.  I served them over roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  We served seven people for dinner and nobody liked them.  So embarrassing!  I followed the recipe to the letter with the addition of a couple of cloves of garlic.  It's was so odd because usually the recipes from this site are which are so favorably rated are great.

On a whim I bought a couple of pounds of bone in goat chunks, I believe my first time for goat. I could not find an interesting recipe for goat so I chose this highly rated recipe since the goat chunks looked just like short ribs. It turned out great. Goat has a very nice delicate flavor. The sauce is most excellent and has very complex flavors. I left the meat in the crock pot and thickened the sauce on the stove top since my crock pot is sort of weak on heat. 
THANKS FOR SHARING  !!

I followed some other reviewers and cut back brown sugar, doubled the sauce, and left out the vinegar.  I also did not have chili sauce so I combined ketchup, hot sauce, and a little garlic sauce.  I made them the night before, let sit in the fridge, then skimmed fat off the top and reheated for dinner the following day.  I did not have to add the flour/water mixture to the sauce, I thought it was thick enough as-is, and perfect for scooping over mashed potatoes.  I have a few more packs of short ribs in the freezer and I will definately be using this recipe again. They were fall-apart tender and the flavor was wonderful!

I used boneless ribs and followed the recipe. Very good flavor, however I found the sauce a little on the sweet side, so I will either reduce sugar, or increase vinegar next time. The ribs were also completely done in 5 hours. Very good recipe, thanks~

My husband loved this short rib receipe so much he has asked me to use this sauce on other cuts of meat. He rarely loves a crockpot receipe so this is definitely a winner.

Fantastic recipe! The only modification I made was to use 3 tablespoons of Sriracha in place of chile sauce because I didn't have it. It gave the ribs a nice kick. I served it with an acorn and butternut squash mash. The sweetness of the squash was a perfect compliment to the heat of the ribs.

Amazing!  Careful with the sugar or it will taste too sweet.  I eyeballed the sugar and I think I put in a bit too much.  Still, best ribs in a slow cooker I've tried.

This was delicious and makes a wonderful gravy to go on smashed potatoes!!!  I used all the ingredients as listed except I cooked it in a dutch oven on 300 for about an hour and a half.  The meat was falling off the bones, but still had some chewiness that I like.  Definately a keeper!

I tried this last night. It was super easy to put together, and in two hours a great aroma filled the house. My only complaint would be the vinegar. It completely over powered the sauce. My husband tried using bbq sauce to cover it, but it still had a sour wang to it. I will try it again omitting the vinegar completely. The meat was soo tender, it deserves a second chance!

I've made this several different times in several different ways and it is a delicious crowd-pleaser every time.  For those who prefer a milder sauce, I omitted the chile powder.  I also turned it into a hearty stew by tripling the sauce ingredients and adding some par-boiled potatoes and carrots halfway through the cooking cycle.  I also added an additional splash or two of the red wine when thickening the sauce to give it an even richer flavor.  All in all one of the best (and most versatile) recipes of this type I've found.

Pretty good! Nice sauce. Not outstanding, but made a very nice dinner. I didn't have any chili sauce so I used ketchup, nor did I have red wine so I used beef broth. I subbed the sugar for maple syrup and doubled the sauce. I did not see the need to thicken the sauce at the end with the flour and water. * hours on low was perfect!

I liked the sauce on the finished product but my husband didn't care for it.  I wouldn't make again.  I just have not had succes with how fatty short ribs are.  It seems like they are mostly fat and not enough meat.

In lieu of chili sauce & brown sugar, I used the sweet chili sauce which you can find in the Asian food section of the grocery store.  Loved this tasty recipe ... thanks!

I tried this last weekend and it was soooo good! My husband was very reluctant as they were cooking but was raving on his first bite. It was easy and the crockpot made it even easier. I just pan seared them and transferred to the crockpot from there and they cooked for about 7hrs. I totally recommend this recipe. Oh I used chili garlic sauce instead of just chili sauce and it gave it the perfect kick.

ok, this was a really good recipe - I have to admit though that I am not a fan of short-ribs.  Too much fat for my taste; I like my meat a lot leaner.  I did enjoy the flavors of the sauce and the meat was tender.  I will not make again, but the recipe did a great job with flavor.

Excellent, easy, elegant dinner.  We served 25 discerning hunters that loved it.  The only problem is that we should have added another third of the recipe!  There was not a teaspoon of sauce left!

These were fantastic.  My husband and I are not big beef eaters but our 18 year old son was craving meat so I tried this.  We all loved it.  I did make 2 changes though. I used a can of onion soup in place of the wine.  I think that cooking with wine can sometimes give the dish a sour flavor unless you cook off the alcohol first. Then I baked it in a large covered cassarole dish at 425 for about 2 hours. The meat was very tender and tasted great! I will be keeping  this one.

This was relatively easy to put together, and the end result was really good.  I would probably make a few changes next time, mainly reducing the amount of acidity (vinegar taste was a little too strong), and add more fresh herbs and carrots for sweetness.  I agree with a former review in that the ribs/ gravy tasted even better the next day, so make sure you have enough for leftovers!

Delicious...made pretty much as written EXCEPT I made it with chuck roast instead of short ribs (wanted to save some money).  I also used a dutch oven -- 325 for 3 hours -- because I don't have a slow cooker.  Everyone loved it, even my 4 year old. Served with German potato salad and sauerkraut!

We enjoyed the flavor of these.  I made this as directed but opted not to brown the ribs first to save time.  I served these over mashed potatoes.  My only complaint is that this didn't make 6 servings.  It was closer to 3, but then again maybe my ribs were just really fatty.  I would make this again if I found a really good deal on short ribs.

Wow. Simply amazing.   I used tomato paste instead of chili sauce. I also put a squirt of ketchup & that chinese hot sauce for a kick. 1 tbsp of garlic powder, I thought fresh garlic might overpower the other flavors. I used a cabernet sauvigion wine which was PERFECT!    I doubled everything  (except the onion)because I had more than 3 pounds. This was resturant quality. It was sweet and tangy. I served with a weight watchers mac and cheese and green beans and BIG glass of southern sweet tea!

What a treat!  We loved this recipe, the sauce really made it for us.  My four year old ate two servings!  Next time I will drain the grease from the broth before I add the flour.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.    Perfect Sunday night dinner.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it is so easy to throuw together.  I don't eat flour or sugar so I omit the flour and I use agave syrup in place of the brown sugar.  I also use unsweetened kethchup or tomato sauce instead of the chile sauce.  I also use 1T of both the mustard and chile powder AND for heat I add 1 teaspoon of cayenne.  It's wonderful.

Mmmm Goood!  I couldn't find chili sauce (don't know where to find it in my supermarket) so I used Sarucha (aka "rooster" sauce, Hot Chili Sauce) in its place, didn't use the entire amount called for (about 2/3 of the half cup) and replaced the rest with some ketchup.  Left this dish delish!  Spicy and so tender it melted in our mouths! Tasty!

The sauce was very good even though I did add a few extra spices.  The ribs were too greasy for my taste though which leaked into the sauce but the meat turned out nice and tender.  Would make again but use a less fatty meat.

I loath short ribs, but I have to give this a 5 star ... esp for the sauce.  Outstanding flavor!  To cut back on amount of fat from shortribs, I seasoned and broiled them @ 400 for 45 min.  This helped a great deal.  I highly recommend the sauce and intend to use it with a brisket (yum...).  Thx for recipe!

I made this for a family dinner when my husband's side of the family was visiting for a wedding.  I doubled it and used boneless pork and beef ribs.  It was delicious and a huge hit!  This was served with with lumpy mashed potatoes, and it disappeared!  I will definitely make this again, especially if we have company.

I've made this recipe several times exactly as written, except I use boneless short ribs. The sauce is perfect, the meat tender and flaky and the flavor to die for. I get recipe requests every time. I usually serve this with garlic noodles, but am going to try it with baby red potatoes tomorrow.

I buy my short ribs at Costco and always double the recipe - we hardly every have leftovers because everyone loves these so much.

I've made these ribs several times since first reading the recipe here and they are always absolutely delicious! My slow-cooker doesn't do high heat very well so I pour the liquid into a saucepan and thicken it on the stovetop. I've occasionally substituted ketchup for the chili sauce and it comes out fine, if a little less "zippy". This has become one of my husband's favorite dishes and part of my permanent recipe rotation!

We loved this! Couldn't find beef short ribs so I used boneless beef braising ribs.  Used Apple Cider vinegar since that is what my German grandmother always used.  Did not thicken the sauce as it appeared to be just fine.  Served it over rice, but I think it would be even better served over noodles, spaetzl or even fettucine.

Very good! Not as greasy as I would have thought. This is a somewhat sweet dish which is what I like.  Meat was very tender.  I served it over noodles like it said but next time I might try something different like mashed potatoes or rice.  Also I did not have to cook it as long as the recipe says.  Next time I will also double up on the sauce ingredients.

The sauce was really really good, but I must not be too hip on shortribs.  I thought they were too fatty and hardly any meat.  But LOVED the sauce. Only change I made was added garlic.

I made this with a pot roast instead of ribs and cooked it on high for 4 hours (started too late). Followed the sauce recipe exactly and it's pretty good, sort of medium intensity, that is, not too tangy and not too sweet. Will try it with ribs next time, cooking on low for a longer time. Keeper.

Very good recipe.  I did make some minor changes - used boneless beef ribs (can't seem to find short ribs where I live), Cafe Zinfandel wine (that's what I drink, so that's what I had), I was out of ground mustard so I used mustard seed that I ground with a mortle and pestle and, since I was doubling the recipe, used an entire 12 oz bottle of chili sauce while just doubling the remaining ingredients.  I thought the ingredients worked well together, not too sweet.  The only thing I wished I'd done differently was served it with mashed potatoes instead of noodles.  Will definitely be making this one again.

Excellent recipe.  The meat was very tender and juicy and there was plenty of sauce for us. Was a little bland for my taste and my husband agreed.  Next time I'll add a little extra vinegar.

This was pretty darn good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had time to cook it for 5 hrs instead of 6-8 so I am sure those 2 extra hours make a world of difference...

While some are saying the ingredients themselves may not "sound German" the overall taste at the end is actually very reminiscant of German cooking. My mother-in-law is German and while she didn't recognize the recipe she did love how it tasted. I served it with spaetzle and red cabbage. Awesome!
The best crock pot recipe I've come across in a long time.

Pretty darn good. I used boneless short ribs and they were perfectly tender and not at all dried out. Thanks for the recipe!

I really loved this recipe! I'm not a big meat eater but these ribs were so tender and the flavor was very tasty and sweet without being overpowering.  I would recommend this to everyone!!

This is my kind of recipe...simple and flavorful! The short ribs I used had bones, but while slow cooking the meat fell right off the bones! I had no red wine, so I used Marsala instead and it worked out just fine. Hubby and I loved the sauce though I felt it was a bit too spicy for our 2 year old. Consequently, next time I make this I'll cut the chili sauce down to a 1/4 cup. This recipe is now part of our permanent file. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you prepare this one!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit - I served it with rice and it was a definite keeper.  My husband said it was one of his favorites.  This was easy to make and I did not make any changes!

Not bad. But tastes kind of plain eventhough I tried to jazz it up a bunch.  My family didn't seem to care one way or another.

This gets 2 stars for being easy only.  We didn't like the flavor at all.  Maybe we just don't like "German" short ribs(?)  Sorry.

This recipe was excellent!  I substituted grape juice for the red wine and used red wine vinegare.  The sauce thickened on its own so I didn't need to at the end.

I only gave this recipe three stars because I thought that these ribs, while superbly tender, were bland and boring.  The flavor was fine, just very underwhelming. I suggest doubling the liquid and spices in the marinade and adding some punch with garlic or the savory spice of your choice.

I made the recipe as written, but used ± 2.5# short ribs cut in chunks.

This was so good!  It had the greatest flavor...  It was a little dry/charred, but that's user error...I had it on LOW for 12 hrs (I commute).  It was also swimming in oil, so next time, I will double the sauce like another user posted, and take out the oil with a baster.  Oh yeah, and I will definitely put in more onions, because they were caramelized and SO good!  My fiance thought it was great!  I also had potato pancakes, sauerkraut, bratwurst, and rolls!  mmm...

As Tony says. "GREAT" I used a baster and removed most of the fat before adding the flower and water.

Absolutely the best slow-cooker recipe ever! Try using other veggies too like celery and carrots. Excellent flavor and just the right amount of spice! Make sure all the meat and veggies are covered in sauce so nothing chars.

This is a truly delicious recipe.  I didn't have any short ribs in the house, so I used a boneless chuck roast instead.  The flavor is excellent--I can't wait to try it on ribs the next time!  Makes plenty of sauce.

This is a great recipe for a cold day.  I skimmed about two inches of fat off the top, but what was left was wonderful.  I highly recommend spooning the sauce over spatezle.

My husband loved this recipe. He wanted to give it five stars. The only reason I did not is because the sauce had a layer of oily liquid on top. This may have been caused by the type of ribs I chose, but next time I think I will let it sit overnight and scoop off the congealed fat as others have suggested.

This was fantastic.  I couldn't get beef short ribs, so I used pork short ribs instead.  I didn't care for all the little bones, so next time I'll try a different cut of meat.  The sauce was so delicious!  We made garlic mashed potatoes, and poured the sauce all over them.  Fantastic meal.

I am not usually a fan of slow cooker recipes, but this was fabulous!  I used 5 pounds of short ribs, so I doubled the gravy ingredients because a lot of gravy is a must for my family. Short ribs can be difficult to find, but this recipe makes it worth scouting them out.  My only other comment is that 3 pounds of these, with bone in, would never serve 6 people!

Excellent!  I cooked in slow cooker mode in an instapot. Six hours was barely enough. Next time I will use better quality meat like a roast. The short ribs we had didn’t do justice to the recipe. We used adobo sauce instead of chili sauce.

This turned out so delicious. I didn’t brown the ribs first but just put them in crockpot. This would be good, too, with a great cut of roast.

We enjoyed this. My BF really liked it. He arrived home from work and asked what smelled so good in the house. I did take others’ advice and I doubled the sauce. It made WAY too much sauce. But the sauce is yummy!  I froze the extra for use with some future dinner. As others mentioned, I found this a little greasy, but that’s the cut of meat and that’s why this one is only a 4 star for us. I’d make it again, but not routinely. I made it originally because we had the ribs in the freezer from our last farm beef purchase.

delicious and easy to whip up with on hand ingredients. I cooked some egg noodles and threw that into the thickened sauce. 
Nice easy dinner.

This was excellent. With my Austrian heritage. I did add some gravy master and  half the  vinager. I served over homemade Austrian  potato dumplings and red cabbage. It’s better the day after as well. Other than that I followed the Recipe as is.

This really has potential but the beef ribs didn't work.  Could have been the ribs.  We got them from our nephew's cow.  I'm going to try it again because if I can get the meat tender, it'll be a good one.

Whoever gave the recommendation of letting these tasty ribs cook the 8 hours overnight is a genius.  How EASY to mix all the spices/onion, put that into a lined crockpot, quickly brown the meat, and cook everything on low overnight.  This morning I removed and refrigerated the meat, slid the onion/spice liquids into a sauce pot, refrigerated the contents to allow the fat to rise for removal, and will thicken the sauce later today and heat up my flavorful ribs for serving tonight.  Terrific flavor!   LOVE this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I doubled the recipe & the only change i made was not to add sugar after reading other reviews. I also trimmed the fat off  the ribs so it wouldn't be too greasy.  Definitely was a hit with family & will make again.

Delicious! All the bones came right off. I only cooked them for about 5:30 hours. Will definitely do this one again. I added applesauce, red cabbage and spaetzle as sides.

Holy smokes!! This was delicious!! I used 3 pounds of boneless country style beef ribs. I followed others’ advice and cut the sugar, using 2 TB rather than 3. Next time, I might cut the sugar even more. I used sweet chili sauce, red wine vinegar, and a Cabernet for the red wine. Cooked on low in the slow cooker for six hours and served over egg noodles. The ribs were so tender and delicious! My hubby was a happy man eating this. Will definitely make again.

We really liked this! I followed the recipe, being wary of too much sugar like some reviewers had mentioned, but wound up using the amount called for. Not too sweet at all, nice balance of flavors. (If anything, could go another T sugar and vinegar to make that flavor more pronounced) I did double the sauce amount, and glad I did. Browning the ribs off first must have contributed not just flavor but also thickness to the sauce as I didn't need to thicken it as called for. I used more ribs than called for,  cooked on high for 6 hours, and the meat was falling off the bone. Will definitely use this sauce for beef roasts (like a  quick sauerbraten) and would be great on pork as well. Next time will serve with sweet and sour cabbage! (Have to admit was really skeptical about the chili sauce and chili powder, but those flavors were not really evident  and just added complexity.)

I seasoned the flour with a little no salt seasoning. Put ribs on a oiled foil lined cookie sheet, sprayed ribs with cooking spray and browned in 450 degree oven. I too doubled the sauce, only used 2 tbsp brown sugar and increased dry spices to a tbsp each except dry mustard which I used 1/2 tbsp. added beef stock instead of just water at end. Was fantastic. Thanks for recipe

This dish was delicious!  I used 4lbs of short ribs and I doubled the sauce as others suggested, but I really don't think that is necessary. I cut back on the brown sugar too. The only thing I would do is I would add a bit more cider vinegar next time. Having lived in Germany for two years, I know this type of dish should have a bit more tang to it. Also I would make it ahead of time and give it time to cool so I could skim off the fat more easily. I'm sure this would reheat just fine. But I will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe!  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Everything was soooo tender and juicy!!  Had a nice subtle taste of the chili sauce and chili powder (not overpowering at all!).  The gravy was to die for!  The wine really made this dish.  This will be my go-to recipe for short ribs!!!

Sooooo good! I swapped out a few ingredients; mustard for the chili sauce, molasses for the brown sugar, soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce, coconut oil for the olive oil, and apple cider vinegar for the regular vinegar. Absolutely delicious, and would make a great sauce for meatballs too!

I've never had short ribs. This was crazy good and so easy.  I was confused by the link to Germany, though. My friends and I renamed it the United Nations short ribs as there are so many flavors.  LOL Thank you.

OMG!  I made a few changes - I didn't bother to brown the ribs, filled bottom of dutch oven with shredded cabbage and sliced onion, placed ribs on top - mixed all other ingredients - including the 2 T flour - and poured over top.  Covered it up tight, baked at 250 for 5 hrs - and we ate every bite!

We love this recipe, deliciously German. Serve it over egg noodles. We use Sriracha hot sauce, and 1/2 the amount. But, we double the liquid.

We really liked this recipe.  Added more of the liquids in proportion to cover the ribs more completely.  Sauce had a nice flavor.

These are a huge hit every time I make them.  If I’m out of red wine, I just substitute red wine vinegar for the total amount of wine & vinegar.  Oftentimes I skip thickening the sauce at the end because they are so good you really don’t need any sauce.

Maybe this would be good if cooked for 6 hours, but I cooked it for 8 hours and it was SEVERELY OVERDONE.  Meat was dried out and rather hard.  A big disappointment!

Good recipes.  Not as good as I thought it would be, figuring the amount of people that have saved and rated this recipe. I did add some baby red potatoes to my crock pot half way thru the cooking process. They turned out perfect.  Would make this recipe again, unless I find a better.

Great meal after skiing!  I substituted Chinese sweet chili sauce for the chili sauce.  It had a nice zing and I didn't have to run to the store.  Used my handy stick mixer to finish the gravy in the crock pot, Thick and yummy.  A definite keeper!

I made this recipe using some of the hints others gave and also baked them in the oven after browning them - they were delicious.  I hadn't made short ribs in years and this was a great recipe.  I also lucked out with my butcher who had some beautiful - but expensive - short ribs in their freezer.

What did I get wrong? The chilli sauce and chilli powder amounts stated made my ribs so hot as to be barely edible...and I LIKE hot and spicy food! Maybe I'm using the incorrect type of chilli sauce and/or powder.

served over mashed potatoes, this was FAR better than I had anticipated. So glad I tried this recipe. Bonus- short ribs are an inexpensive way to eat beef.

taste better then it smelled ! idid in crock on hihgh for 4 hrs . I used westeren style ribs . these cooked a little dry ,but They still had a unusual but good flavor . 3 kids 5-12 didn't like at all by the end. I didn't have chili sauce though . next time I will add chili sauce to see if that tightens the flavor . will try again some time . came close with kids . they like first couple of bites the taste was to stong for them ,maybe the wine ?

This is a great recipe! The only changes I made was to add three diced cloves of garlic to the sauce.  Also, depending on the ribs you use, you'll need to take out some of the rendered drippings from the sauce before you thicken it. I found it would of been too greasy for my taste if left in.  I served it with mashed potatoes and candied carrots. Very good!

Not bad but it made the house smell like McDonalds takeout while cooking.  I feel like it had a bit too much vinegar in it.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make this again but it was worth a try and I would recommend giving it a whirl.

Our grocery only had one package of short ribs so I used a package of baby back ribs. I cut them in 2-3 bone sections and followed the directions.  They were excellent!  My husband said they were the best ribs he's ever had!

Yum!  We made this for a football Sunday, and it was really a hit!  We served it on noodles, and made a big salad with a buttermilk ranch dressing -- the perfect complement to the zesty short ribs and sauce.

I used Sriracha to spice up some ketchup instead of the chile sauce. Probably made it a bit hotter, but I loved it.

My family loved this recipe.  I followed it carefully.  It was delicious.  I was not sure if I was suppose to cut the ribs before I coated them with the flour.  I did not.  However, because it said small bowl I think I was suppose to do so.  I uses a little over 3 lbs of ribs and we had three family members for dinner and we ate the whole thing!  I don't think 3 pounds would yeild 6 servings!  It was awesome.  The meat fell off the bone and it was an tantilizing combination of hot, sweet, and sour!  Excellent

This was great!  I only used 1/2 of the brown sugar but otherwise made it as directed (and doubled the sauce).  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ribs were a tad dry. I cooked it 8 hours, but next time I'll try 7 hours.  I served with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots - yum!

Yummy!  I only used half of the chili sauce and added some bbq sauce instead.  It had just the right amount of heat.

I'm torn on this review.  I enjoyed the recipe after I got used to how very spicy-hot it was. IF I cook it again, I would cut the chili sauce in half & maybe add ketchup for the other half.

We liked the flavor of this recipe. Not a fan of the short ribs, they were fatty and greasy. Next time we will use maybe beef tips or country style ribs with the fat trimmed off. I would also double the sauce next time. Used ketchup because we didn't have chili sauce. Mixed the flour with cold water and whisked it in the sauce and it thickened up right away. Served over mashed potatoes but think it would have been better over rice.

We had this the other night. It has been a long while since I had short ribs. These were quite good. They were tender and flavorful. We had to thicken the sauce for a more gravy like consistency.

The sauce is excellent!!!  The cooking method is tender.  These ribs are a little fatty so remove as much as you can before eating.  Leftovers were great!!

Didnt cook this in the crockpot and didn't use beef and it was still 5 stars! Used boneless county pork ribs in a Dutch Oven and it cooked in 60 minutes! Glad others suggested doubling the sauce because it needed the volume to cover the meat pieces and it was delicious!Added cut up parsnips and simmered aditional 30 minutes - a real keeper!

These were very tender, but the flavor just wasn't there for us. With some tweaking, it could be a 5 star recipe. Next time I might try cutting down on the vinegar or trying cider vinegar. I might also try port wine instead of dry red. Thanks for the submission...it's a good jumping off point for us.

While this cooks in the slow cooker, the smell is a bit off-putting -- strong vinegary smell all over the house. But the flavor is good. Mine turned out a bit greasy, hence the 4 out of 5 stars.

I am not a rib kinda' person - but the sauce for this was wonderful.  My husband loved this and I will make it again - butnext time with a different meat.  It would be just as good I think with a shredded beef roast.

This was great, but as previous posters said to I used only one heaping tablespoon of sugar, added a package of dry beef boullion, and used a bit more red wine. We only had two pounds of ribs and the sauce was the perfect amount. I found a Spaetzle recipe on the to serve with the ribs, and we were transported right into Oktoberfest here in south Austin, TX!

I was really excited to make this dish but was a little disappointed... it just didn't live up to the hype. It was good, but not out of this world. I did reduce the brown sugar, but it was still a little too sweet for my taste.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit, but it was a great base recipe!  I used country style pork ribs instead of beef short ribs.  I also used a bottle and a half of chili sauce, half a bottle of pinot noir, and a cup of beef broth.  I doubled the spices, and added paprika and garlic powder.  I strained the fat off after slow cooking and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce and it turned out wonderfully!! Next time I will try it with beef.

This made very tender ribs, but not the flavor that my family wanted.  We then tried them two ways-with an asian sauce and traditional barbeque sauce.  It really helped to bring out the flavor then.  This is a great way to cook ribs if you want them tender, but are willing to add another sauce.

the recipe is worth trying. I thought the beef tasted like sweet and sour pork. I served mine over rice and spooned some sauce over the top.
 on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this one a 7,,,,, enjoy ;-)

The recipe was very easy to make.  My husband loved it.  Me, not so much.  I was hoping it would have a more barbecue flavor to it since I use a lot of the same ingredients when I make my barbecue sauce. I will try to make again using a different cut of meat (I thought the ribs were too fatty) and play with the ingredients until I get the taste I want.

We weren't very impressed with this recipe. The sauce was very bland. Won't try this one again.

I put the sauce in a separate container and put both ribs and sauce in the fridge overnight, skimmed the grease the next day and heated the sauce adding the flour and water and a cup of prepared BBQ sauce to add more flavor and more sauce. The ribs were warmed on the grill for flavor and the meal was like eating dessert.

It was very good. I may reduce the sugar next time as it was a bit sweet. I also marinated the beef in the sauce overnight and added some garlic to enhance the flavor. Slow cooked it for 8 hours and the beef fell off the bone nicely. To remove the fat layer from sauce, I simply used the fat separater cup and it worked well. My husband liked it although my three yo didn't.

This sounds quite yummy, can't wait to try it.  Would also be good served over rice and served with a green salad or green vegetable.

My husband's only complaint was that there isn't enough meat on short ribs.  I made this using a chuck roast (no modification to the other ingredients)and it was excellent.  Leftovers make great sandwiches.

The flavors did not go together well and it just tasted bitter. Two stars because the meat was tender (as it usually is in the slow-cooker) but nobody really enjoyed it.

These were good but very fatty.  The sauce was just one gloppy mess at the end.  The ribs were fine but unless you refrigerate this and skim the fat the next day, don't bother.

I received a crock pot for christmas, this was my first recipe I tried.  It was wonderful.  Even the kids ate it and asked for more.   They now want this for their birthday dinner.  My only comment was the short ribs I purchased were a little fatty, I should have trimmed them as the sauce had a bit of fat I had to skim.

Fabulous!!!  I used a mild/sweet oriental chili sauce because my family does not like spicy food, then added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the sauce.  Everyone gobbled them up.

They were VERY GOOD.

We had them with sour kraut.

We did not coat the ribs ahead of time or brown the ribs.  Just put it all in the slow cooker for 8 hours (maybe a little more). 

Put it in a smaller pot to fit in the fridge overnight.  The fat solidified and was easy to remove the next evening at dinner time.
Next time I will put the ribs and liquid in separate containers to make it easier to get all of the fat our, but the meal was not greasy or fatty. We reheated it on the stove.
  We each had 2 ribs and we both left some.

It's a keeper.

Great recipe.  If you don’t own a slow-cooker, sear these ribs in a pot and then cook them in your oven at 225 for 8 or 9 hours until meltingly tender.

Peggy, 1st thing, what "chile sauce" did you mean to reference in your recipe? I used the beefed-up catsup from Del-Monte or Heinz for the following. If you meant for us to use spicy stuff, please let us know.
I hate deviating from the original, but unfortunately, I had to. Oh, by the way, this is the 1st recipe we've ever tried from this site, so you should feel honored. I picked it because of your ratings and crock use, then we couldn't find our crock! So I had to make adjustments. I used 5 1/4 lbs bone-in short ribs, browned in a Dutch oven. I doubled the sauce but added 3 garlic cloves cut in half and made 2 cups of salty, brown water using 2 little brown cubes some people call "bouillon". (Next time I'll probably use canned broth or stock!) I added all 16oz as my wife is not a big fan of the red wine flavor. 2 hours at 350 degrees and 1 to 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees and these ribs were wonderful. We thickened some of the sauce and served the very tender, boneless meat over noodles. Thanks for a great recipe we'll put in the crock next time.

Excellent!  I used pork ribs instead of beef. Didn't have any chilli sauce so used some chilli paste mixed with some tomato paste. Also added garlic powder as suggusted by other reviewers and a dash of liquid smoke. The ribs were so tender!  The sauce required a little salt to bring out the flavour but other than that were very tasty.

I had a freezer full of meat and not one short rib to be found, so I used a pork tenderloin instead. I doubled the sauce, however, only used two tablespoons of the sugar. The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was delicious. Thanks Peg for a great recipe!

These were okay.  They tasted like beef stew which wasn't really what I was looking for on and 85 degree day.  Also, the fat on the ribs was really mushy after they cooked which kind of grossed me out.  I won't be making these again.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and just wanted to let you know how great it is!  Easy to throw together in the crock pot and great to come home to at the end of the day.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!  :)

This was pretty easy to make. The sauce is great! While the crockpot makes it easier, it seems to me that it may just as well be done in a dutch oven.

Served 500 pounds of these ribs at our Bockfest weekend in the spring.  Huge hit...had about 50 people ask for the recipe.
