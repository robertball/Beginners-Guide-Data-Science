I couldn't give it a five because I didn't follow the recipe,exactly...the avacado gave it a smooth creamy feel and taste, YUM ! I added frozen bananas to thicken and sweeten instead of honey and used almond milk in place of milk . To increase the healthyness I added powdered Barley grass and powdered Wheat grass, It was EXCELLENT, the whole family liked it , even our kids wanted more ? Will be making this again !

I'm from Brazil and my grandpa has drank an avocado smoothie practically every morning for years.  This is a pretty good one.  His are more simple: Avocado, milk, sugar.

The avocado makes this simple smoothie really velvety smooth.  I love it, but recommend adding a bit more honey for those who are not health nuts :)

I am always looking for ways to use avocados.  We have a tree in our yard just loaded with avocados.  This was incredibly delicious.  I made it for breakfast, but could easily be a dessert - very rich and creamy - milkshake like.  Even the kids enjoyed it.  I am allergic to dairy, so I used 1 cup almond milk, no yogurt and 1/2 of a banana to sweeten instead of the honey - perfection.

My family and I love avocado smoothie. My ingredients are avocado (of course), sweetened condensed milk (1 regular can), and ice. Blend all and serve.

This was and amazign recipe!! I just loved  the taste and it was simple, easy and fast to make...a great summer time treat! (For kids too!) Saying that, I did make a few changes to make it healtier... I used raw (unprocessed) milk, homemade yogurt, 3 drops of vinilla stevia (to replace the vanilla in the yogurt), and agave nectre instead of honey...it was so great!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! Thank you loveinit!
I made a few changes:
a) Since I am somewhat lactose-intolerant, I replaced the milk with Organic Vanilla SoNice Soy Milk.
b) I only used three ice cubes.
This was plenty sweet as it was; I'm surprised anyone would find it otherwise. I think next time I might use plain soy milk and plain yogurt to dial down the sweetness.
Thanks!

I added strawberries that I froze in a ziplock bag and left out the yogart,(who needs extra calories with no additional taste?) it taste much better that way and you can't even taste the avocado.. which is good for me since i don't really like avocado, I just eat avocado so that i can have long gorgeous princess hair and beautiful skin.

i thought it was ok,but there is too much yogurt. I had a stomach ache because you could taste mostly yogurt, but hardly any avocado. I would prefer a stronger taste in avocado

i had frozen my avocados and was looking for a smoothie recipe that i could use them in, so i tried this one. Now i have a new favorite! I try to stick to the recipe when I try it for the first time however I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used nonfat plain organic yogurt. We tasted and my husband wanted the vanilla taste so I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and it made a big difference. I'd rather not have the extra fat and calories from the milk so I may replace that with unsweetened coconut or almond milk next time. As is it is very delicious. It didn't appear to separate. It will brown a little as it is left out. I don't know how it will keep in fridge as we didn't have any leftovers.

Absolutely divine!! The avocado flavor is very light and I think other fruit/veggies could easily be added. The avocado provides an unbelievably smooth, creamy background for the flavors of the yogurt, mikl, and honey. Very filling as well.  It reminded me of a milkshake!! So glad I found this recipe!

Delicious! Made as directed and was perfect! 

People please stop rating recipes and then say you can't give it a five bc you didn't follow instructions or talk about how you changed 10 things. That's like watching part of a movie and trying to critique it. Makes no sense.

Loved the recipe. For my taste 3 tablespoons of honey was a bit too sweet. I added fresh blueberries (about half a pint) and it evened the sweetness. Loved the combination.

I came on here to give this recipe 5 stars when I noticed I didnt follow the recipe exactly I forgot the yogurt. So I had to make it again following the recipe. I love the way I made it by accident without the yogurt. But with yogurt is good too. My 20 month old loves it so much!!! I never really liked avocados but I'm trying to be more healthy. The first time I made this I made this I used a hard avocado I didn't realize I had to use a ripe one since I never used avocados before. This recipe has mafe me an avocado lover! I make it everyday now. Yummy!!!!!

like a previous reviewer, I couldn't give it 5 b/c i made a few changes. Instead of the milk/yogurt, I used almond milk (vanilla). I also added a scoop of whey protein & a little bit of lime juice. This was surprisingly tasty!

DELICIOUS! After being told by my doctor that I need more fat in my diet, my first instinct was to turn to some kind of avocado dish. It is EXTREMELY smooth and creamy to the point where it was almost worth eating it with a spoon. However, I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 cup (Fage) greek yogurt and a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I used half a frozen banana for sweetness and creaminess and only 4 ice cubes. Everyone should definitely try this!

Amazing! Great starter recipe. Changed add one banana, lowered honey to 1T, used FF Greek plain yogurt, not vanilla, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Did I mention amazing? I've never had an avocado smoothly before and it was the creamiest, yummiest treat.

Really good!  I modified only slightly, but I don't think it is needs to be necessarily.  I only had fat free plain Greek yogurt and vanilla protein powder so mixed those in and added half a banana.  Probably could add strawberries, blueberries or just about anything else you put into a smoothie and would come out great as well.  I cant overstate how good this is and the health benefits.  Absolutely wonderful!

This was pretty good- my 18 month old devoured his with a spoon! It's got enough sweetness, but you can taste the avocado, and it's thick and filling. It isn't something you can drink a big glass of, but it is good

This shake is incredible!  I made it the way the recipe was stated, and it needed a little something to boost the flavor.  I recommend adding about five tablespoons of honey instead of three.  Other than that, terrific!

DELICIOUS!!  I had a lonely avocado to use up and wanted something different.  I am thrilled that I came across this recipe!!  I scaled down to just one serving and made this for myself for lunch.  Creamy, wonderful tasting and such a pretty green colour...can't wait to make another one tomorrow with the other half of my avocado!  This will be a great summertime treat!

Awesome recipe!! Just got into making smoothies and this, by far, is my favorite. Its filling enough to replace a meal, but still tasty enough to satisfy a late-night sweets craving.

My boyfriend and I were trying to decide what to do with leftover avocado from lunch.  This was the natural choice. We made some slight changes.  Instead of a whole avocado, we used about 3/4 of a large avocado.  We used 2% milk, a half cup of fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt, only two tablespoons of honey and only 6 ice cubes. The result was a light and satisfying treat!  We will definitely make this again!

I made healthy changes but I’m sure the original version was fantastic.  To make it lower glycemic, I used plain whole milk Greek yoga with vanilla stevia drops and vanilla to replace the vanilla yogurt.  Instead of honey, I used agave nectar and I didn’t have milk so I used coconut milk.  It was still great!   For extra zing I added fresh lime juice and like it even better.   Will repeat.

So delicious! This has long been a Vietnamese restaurant favorite of mine. When I'm out of honey, I use raw sugar and it gives it a little different flavor. The last time I made this, I blended in some 75% cacao dark chocolate with it. YUMMY!

Super yummy! Key is to use really ripe avocados. I halved the recipe and it is still a huge serving. I used vanilla greek yogurt (Voskos) and it whipped up so smooth and creamy.

This tasted more like Avocado yogurt, I think whipped cream would've served more justice for it to be called a smoothie.

I didn't know what to expect...so I told myself I make it exactly how the recipe is and then tweak it...(didn't have regular milk,used soy milk instead) when I tasted it I was like WOW!:) didn't add nothing else and I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted so yummy! *My bf don't like avocados so much,but he loved the smoothie!

This is surprisingly good! Even my kids (ages 2 and 4) really liked it. I did try the smoothie with and without a banana. For my taste, I liked it much better with the banana. Very good.

This smoothie is soo good!  I didn't have any vanilla yogurt at home so added plain yogurt with half teaspoon of vanilla extract instead.  The smoothie came out a little thick so I added a little more milk to even out the consistency.  Super fast and easy to make!

Fantastic and smooth!  I used plain greek yogurt instead of vanilla to cut down a bit on the sugar.  I love real maple syrup and used it to sweeten instead of honey.

I made this and found it to be really good. I did make a few modifications - I used plain greek yogurt, I added about a tsp of vanilla, no honey and I used a frozen banana instead of the ice cubes! It was very tasty, much better than I expected an avocado smoothie would be.

I loved this recipe. SO Simple! I substituted some chobani brand banana  yogurt for the vanilla (its all I had) and used agave nectar instead of honey. I omitted the ice cubes b/c we didn't have any and it was still delicious! Great smoothie texture! I think I will try it again, but try a fresh banana instead of the yogurt!

As usual, I adapted this to what I had on hand, but it was a smash hit! Kids LOVED it. I used 1 avocado, 1 frozen banana (since I only had plain yogurt), 1 cup plain yogurt, 3 T. sugar, and 6 ice cubes. YUM YUM YUM.

This smoothie is DELICIOUS but little tidbit... make sure you use vanilla yogurt. I had none the second time around so I used plain yogurt and it is not at all the same. I added some almond extract (out of vanilla atm) and it helped but definitely not the same! Organic vanilla yogurt works great :)

I'll admit that while I LOVE avacodos I was highly skeptical of this smoothie.  This is AWESOME!  It's very refreshing and a great way to use those avacodos that are a little to brown or mushy for other applications.I replaced the honey with 1 T raw agave... perfect

Leave the yogurt out...it makes it taste like yogurt.  Tried other reviewers suggestions...banana, makes it taste like banana....sweetend condensed, taste like sweetend condensed.  Keep it simple for that true creamy avacado taste.

Pretty good - I used greek yogurt and only 3/4 milk and added 1/2 a banana as well. I also used agave nectar instead of honey. Great healthy shake!

This was SOOO good!  I replaced the milk with unsweetened almond milk, and used splenda instead of honey.  The second time I made it I threw in a few tablespoons of coconut milk.  That was great too, and gave it the mouth feel of a milkshake.

If you're watching your carbs this this recipe has 6.75 net grams of carbs per serving if you made it the way I did.  Not bad for a super healthy dessert.

Outstanding!  I had an avocado that I needed to use and found this while searching for smoothie recipes.  I substituted the milk with vanilla soy milk.  I will definitely make this again - great nutrition, wonderful taste, texture, and visual appeal too!

Great recipe! I think the honey over powers the subtle avocado flavor, so I use 2-3 Tbs of sugar instead of 3 Tbs of honey.

Didn't follow 100%, sorry we all have different tastes 
I just change the vanilla yogurt to Greek yogurt, + add vanilla essence, and only 1 teaspoon of honey. 
Perfect and sweet enough for me, no ice because its winter time at the moment.

This is a delicious and very refreshing smoothie. I  have a dairy allergy so I used Almond Milk in place of the milk.
I will make this again.
Thank you for the recipe.

Very good and refreshing! My avocado was on the way out, and I was able to salvage about 3/4 of it. I cut back a bit on the other ingredients and went very light with the honey (a tblsp?), and it was plenty sweet. I used Greek vanilla yogurt and added a scoop of vanilla protein powder. Nice change from the banana and other fruit-based smoothies!

I changed plain vanilla yogurt to  Chobani blueberry yogurt, and it was delicious. I always add a pinch of salt just for flavor, barely enough to taste.   So smooth, creamy, and light! Will definitely make again.

I was really looking forward to this and at first, it tasted alright but then as I kept drinking it just tasted worse and worse and I got diarrhea from it at least 10 minutes later.

I loved every bit of this smoothie. The texture was amazing. I used almond milk instead regular milk and plain yogurt instead of vanilla. I just added a little extra honey for sweetness. Will be making this again.

JUST made this! First time using an avocado in a smoothie and it was delicious!  I halved the recipe to make one serving for myself and used a 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract since I only had plain greek yogurt and only used 2 ice cubes.  Wonderful flavor, nice and smooth, will definitely make again.

It is suprisingly delicious! I am not a big avacado eater but I want to incorporate more into my diet b/c of the benefits  it provides. It's sweet enough. Actually sweeter than I thought it would be. I did use coconut milk b/c I don't drink cow milk and I added a dash of cinnamon to mine also. 2 thumbs up :)

Surprised at how good it was. Seems like might be a great base to play around with to make it a 5 star. I had large avocados and adjusted up from there. I only had a fresh batch of unflavored greek yogurt so I adjusted by adding back some whey and vanilla and increased the honey. Next batch I added a little Triple-Sec - not bad but not the way to go.  I'm hoping to come up with a 5 star 'cuz this was worth it.

YUM! 

I didn't follow exactly but I have been searching for a smoothie recipe that even comes close to the Strawberry/Banana  Smoothie that I get from Surf City Squeeze and I finally found it with this!! YUM!!  As if I wasn't in love with avocado's and their nutritional goodness before! I love avocado but was wondering how it'd taste in a smoothie - super yum.  

I'm eating mine with a spoon. I will have to either add more milk/almond milk/coconut milk to make it thinner or invest in a cup that has a wide smoothie straw.

Tweaks I made: 
* I didn't use honey (will try it in my next one tomorrow) but added 2 tsp of actual sugar, today.
* Added 1/2 Banana
* Added a handful of Strawberries
* Added a handful of Raspberries
* Added 1 1/2 Tbs Coconut, Flax seed and Chia Protein Mix.

Will be making this again and again!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This is wonderful.  I use agave instead of honey.  But everyone in the house loves this (even the picky eaters).  You can substitute the milk for almond or coconut milk, as well.  Add some protein powder and you are good to go!

I'm obsessed with how thick creamy and rich this recipe is!!! I give it 4 stars because I'm not big on avacado and the flavor isn't amazing to me but replace the milk with dark chocolate almond milk and it's worth 5 stars sooooooo gooooood

I did not have yoghurt on hand so used frozen vanilla ice cream instead (therefore no ice cubes needed). Utterly delicious!!! Can't give it a five as I made a change.

We were in a pinch and didn't have the yogurt, so I added about 1/2 c more milk, and a few drops of vanilla. Was out of honey, and substituted maple syrup.  Yummy. We thought we were drinking a milkshake. Will definitely make again. Need to go buy more honey. This is a great alternative for taking care of an "ice cream fixation". Way healthier.

Add extra honey or a teaspoon of brown sugar if you're not crazy for a pervading guacamole taste.

It's also very good with almond milk and greek yogurt subbed for normal milk and normal yogurt, respectively.

Made with 3 avocados, about 1/2 c vanilla yogurt, 1/2 c milk a scoop of ice. Needed a bit of water to make thinner. Really delicious. Would also be good as a dessert-like mousse. 
Also made with avocado and 2 bananas, about 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup yogurt and ice. Fantastic. The kids loved it!

Easy and yummy! I made just a few changes to fit with our paleo diet.
I made mine a single serving: 1/2 an avacado, 1/2 cup almond milk and 1 frozen banana.

I was given a lot of avocados, so in searching for new avocado recipes I tried this one.  I had big avocados (local from Yucatan) so I used half first just in case that was enough and followed the rest exactly. This is wonderful!  Delicious and refreshing.   Thank you loveinit!!

It was pretty decent.  Very smooth and pretty sweet when using the 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt and honey. Very easy as well.

I am dairy intolerant so I took the advise of many on here and made this with half a banana instead on yogurt, and coconut milk instead of dairy milk.  I also used stevia instead of honey and added vanilla.  It was a little bland (which I acknowledge is probably my own fault for skipping the honey), but for those in the same boat, I then added several mint leaves and WOW!  It is so smooth and creamy, and the mint made it feel like a milkshake.  So even though I changed the recipe quite a bit, it gets 5 stars for being the perfect foil to personalize for your own needs and preferences.

OMG Avocado smoothie! If you like the taste of avocados on their own, you will love this smoothies. But I gave it four stars because you have to use half the yogurt and 3/4 the milk. Add the honey to taste. Some like it sweeter than others.

Delicious!! I didn't have any yogurt, so I used about a tablespoon of sour cream (scary to me too) and 4 ice cubes. Honey was definitely needed! Didn't make it too sweet, but perfectly sweet. I also used vanilla almond milk, cause that is all I drink :) overall simple and great smoothie.

I can't give it 5 starts because I had to change a few things in the recipe because my husband can't eat dairy, yogurt, or honey.

So here is what I did and it tasted great

1 avocado, 4 ice cubes, 2 frozen bananas, 1 cup SO coconut milk, 4 tablespoons pure maple syrup and blended it all together.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe as written and both of my kids loved it.  They are 3 and 5 and asked me to make the recipe again today.  I have been eating avocados all my life, but never in this manner. This is going to be a family favorite from now on.  Thank you for introducing us to such a wonderful recipe!  Oh, and I should mention that they did not see me make the recipe and I served it with nachos for lunch.  I had sliced another avocado to go with the nachos and when I offered them a slice they both exclaimed that they don't eat avocados...if they only knew!??

This is a GREAT recipe. Made it this morning. Didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used a little more than a cup of peach yogurt. DELICIOUS! I try to make a smoothie in the morning before work, I finished this ON my way. I didn't even have any left by the time I got to work. Will definitely be making this regularly. It's filling, it's been 3 hours since I had the smoothie and I'm still pretty full!!

I've tried to hide things in smoothies for my daughter for quite a while with no success.  She always detects (and rejects) the healthy ingredient.  This smoothie was different.  The avocado doesn't hide.  It's the star of the show and it tastes great.  I used plain yogurt with a few drops of vanilla extract because its what I had on hand.  I upped the honey a little to ensure success (but it doesn't need it).  Next time, I'll decrease the honey back to 3 Tbs.

So, so good. Creamy, not watery. Had no milk on hand so I used Carnation dry nonfat instant milk instead. Had no vanilla yogurt so I used Trader Joe's lowfat plain 2% Greek yogurt. Added a pinch of brown sugar. So tasty.

This is wonderful. I don't buy flavored yogurt so used a full-fat plain yogurt and added vanilla extract. I did add extra avocado as I blended, the smoothie didn't seem to have much of an avocado taste otherwise, perhaps the original recipe was tested with a super-sized avocado? As with most smoothies, you can adjust the milk and yogurt to obtain your desired consistency.

I love this drink, I did adapt the recipe somewhat. I added Agave instead of honey and almond milk instead of plain milk. I wanted it to be a bit more nutritious. One can still add in flax oil, and to make it an energy drink you casn add gensing and a spring of mint, chocolate mint, spearmintaw/ an umbrella when serving others ....It was great as it was originally too. Jist thought I would add a few garnishing for summer fun.

Delicious. I used raw honey and substituted one Tbsp of the honey for two Truvia packets to save a few calories.  I was afraid to try this!  But it was wonderful!  I will be making it very often.

SO GOOD! Thick, creamy and delicious! Before I added the honey I tasted it and thought it sweet enough with vanilla yogurt, so I omitted the honey, and WONDERFUL! Thanks for a great, quick, filling snack!

I've had my share of Brazilian Avocado smoothies, and this one is just as good! I did put a little less yogurt, and a little less honey, but overall - great recipe!

Don't know what to say other than that this was heavenly. Just what I needed. And my toddler was nuts about it! One word to the wise, though: there is such a thing as too much of this stuff, so you better have someone to share with!

I used greek yogurt, which gave the smoothie a slightly thicker texture than I think was intended.  Next time I would use regular yogurt or add extra ice cubes to try to thin it out a little.  I used the full amount of honey called for and felt it was a little too much; next time I would only use 2 or 2 1/2 tablespoons.

Delicious.  I wasn't sure how this would taste.  It was really good.  I added a frozen banana, a pear, & 1 tsp stevia and left out the honey.  AMAZING and creamy and healthy. YUMMO.

I recently ordered one of these at a Vietnamese restaurant, just because it sounded "interesting." Holy Moly... I LOVED it and drove my husband nuts the entire ride home, trying to guess the ingredients! :)  I  looked for a recipe as soon as I got home!  I knew AR would come through for me!  This is awesome!  Thank you SO much for the recipe!!!

Really great!  I cut the recipe in half, and used a scoop of vanilla protein powder as well.  Avocado may seem odd in a smoothie, but it was super good.

WOW! This is the best smoothie recipe I've had so far. Very smooth and creamy, as someone else pointed out. I did have to make some adjustments, since I didn't have everything the recipe called for. Instead of vanilla yogurt I used non-fat plain yogurt, and instead of milk I used soy milk. And also I added some extra honey, since the yogurt didn't have sweetener. It's better than I thought it would be!!

Delicious! I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used Yoplait Light Peach. An odd combination perhaps but it was great! I also only used half an avocado because I like avocado and ate half before I got into the blender! Still loved it; so did my 3 year old.

For being what it is, this smoothie is very yummy. I think I still prefer my avocados as a dip or sauce though. Kind of hard to get past the avocado taste mixed with sweetness.

I thought this was very delicious, although I added a bit too much honey the first time.  Other than that, I thought the recipe was very good and easy to make!
