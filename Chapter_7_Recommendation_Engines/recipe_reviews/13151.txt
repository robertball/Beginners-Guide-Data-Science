Our favourite Polish restaurant serves pickle soup and we hoped this would be similar.  WOOHOO!  It was almost identical.  I had homemade beef broth in the freezer so started with that and cooked diced carrots and pickles in it for 45 minutes, then added the potatoes, cooked till soft before adding the flour/milk.  Yum-yum-yummy!  My parents, who are not Polish loved it so much they took the leftovers home with them.  I will be making this a lot!

awesome! I used ground beef with fried mushrooms and onions. I also added some of the dill pickle juice to the soup and added whipping cream instead of flour and milk.

Very easy and quick to make.  I added one thing, mostly because it's a main way I make soups.  While boiling a large pot of water, I fried on med-heat 1 chopped onion and 2 chopped celery stalks until opaque (not browned).  I added this mixture to the pot along with the diced carrots (I did not do mixed vegetables, just carrots).  Of course, pickle juice was added and when the soup was completely finished, I stirred in a little bit of fresh chopped parsley.  Excellent soup!!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I folllowed the recipe as written except used 1/2 water and 1/2 beef boullion, my wife loved it!  To make it a little more interesting I added mini meatballs made as follows.  1 lb 8% fat ground beef 1 egg 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1/4 cup mustard 1 medium onion diced  mixed ingredients and made mini meatballs which I cooked in a little beeft broth then drained and browned. I placed 5-7 meatballs in each bowl and we LOVED it. It really gave the flavor of a great hamburger with mustard and onion surrounded by the great dill pickle taste...we will definitely do this one again.

Am making this for New Year's Eve dinner tomorrow and we are having company :)  I'm brave.  I've used chopped cabbage and a diced carrot for vegetables.  I increased the water by 2 cups and the pickles to 3 cups over all.  I also used a cup of pickle juice.  Once its cooled I'll stir in lite sour cream instead of flour and milk.  Its summer here in New Zealand and its going to be warm tomorrow so I thought a cold soup would be a nice starter.  I'm also making Polish lasagna, cabbage stew in my crockpot and Polish desserts.  Should be good.  It already tastes good hot :)

Delicious!  I made this with bought beef stock and at the end I omitted the milk, stirring in a little sour cream when serving instead.  Highly recommended - I shall definitely be making this again.

I add sour cream and milk to give a little different taste.  You can use Vegeta soup starter for some extra flavor.  Love this soup.  My husband's family is Polish and they think it's authentic.

I made this for lunch today. It was quite interesting. My husband likes it. My taste though is geared more toward spicy, which made this taste bland to me. I did follow the recipe very closely and I'm sure it came out just as it was supposed to. I won't be making it again but I give it 4 stars for originality and ease of preparation. Thanks for sharing.

I made this soup based on the ratings...for a 5-star recipe, I was very disappointed.  The soup was exceptionally bland, and needed a lot of salt and pepper.  It might be better if some beef broth or granules were added.  For lack of a better word, it just tasted strange.  I will definitely not make this again.

This soup sounds incredible, and also easy to make.  We love all things savory, so I know we'll love this soup.  It's also nice that it can be enjoyed cold, on a hot & muggy summer day.  I'm even very pleased with the Nutritional Info, and that's REALLY saying a LOT, since I'm a stickler for (reasonably) healthy dishes.  One question I must ask, but please don't laugh at me.  I don't live under a rock, and I'm a pretty good cook, but I have NO CLUE as to what Neck Bones are!  Are they from beef, pork, or veal?  I've never seen them in my supermarket.  Is there anything else I can use if I can't find these bones?  Thank you.

I will add beef broth to my leftovers to see if that helps the flavor.
