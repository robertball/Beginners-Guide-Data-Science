This recipe has been a favorite in our family for at least 25 years. When I make it I don't use the bacon.  I wrap each piece of chicken in slices of dried beef. I also pour boiling water over the dried beef, drain well and then wrap the chicken.  These two hints will greatly decrease the fat and sodium in this recipe.

A couple of comments..The fat content goes down when using only 1 slice of bacon and you still get the flavor of the bacon and place on top of dried beef.  Secondly, I use 1 can Cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom and 8 oz of sour cream and add some additional dried herbs to it (use your favorites).  I do not use any flour, the sauce does not need it and comes out  just perfect.

A favorite of mine over the years. Never thought of using my slow cooker. I have always baked it in the oven for approx. 90 min. or until bubbly. Sauce is delicious over rice.  Thanks Troy.

You don't use the whole pound of bacon. The recipe only calls for 2-3 slices of bacon wrapped around each piece of chicken. Some people are reading the recipe incorrectly.

I fixed this for Sunday dinner today and we absolutely loved it! I didn't completely cover the chicken with the bacon but instead wrapped a slice around each piece of chicken.  The gravy was delicious! I considered only giving it 4 stars because it has sooo much fat in it but it's just too good to NOT give it five stars! Thanks for sharing!!

I have done this in the oven, was called California street chicken. A pound of bacon is way over the top. Simply wrap one slice of bacon around each breast. It is yummy but you can just as easily get the same effect in an oven an slow cook there for 3 hrs @ 275

My daughter made this for the first time today and it was the best slow cooked chicken I have ever had, no joke. She did not use a whole pound of bacon. She just wrapped each chicken breast in a piece of bacon. And if you use chipped beef instead of dried beef, only use about an ounce or it will be too salty. We've learned that from other recipes.

I didnt have the dried beef so maybe that would have made a huge difference as I see all the other ratings are good. Also the pound of bacon killed whatever kind of gravy/ sauce it was supposed to be. It just turned into a greasy bacon fat liquid.

This recipe is amazing! Growing up my mom would make this in the oven, minus the flour. I love cooking with my crock pot so I was very happy when I found this recipe. The only thing I do differently is I fry the bacon before adding it to the crock pot. Otherwise, your bacon will turn out like slime. Thanks for submitting, Troy!

Tasty and easy to make. The bacon, though, looked raw and unappetizing even after 5 hrs. in the crockpot.  Fine for hubby and I because we knew the bacon was fully cooked, but if serving to a guest it may be unappealing. Makes plenty of gravy.

Huge hit! I've never had the family finish dinner so quickly and rave so much. Like other reviewers have said, a full pound of bacon is a bit much. I only used 2-3 slices on each large chicken breast.

The family liked it and said they would even like to have it again. It did need some salt and a few spices. This time I opted not to use the bacon. I was afraid of it being soggy not crispy. will try it with next time.

I liked this recipe but I over cooked the chicken and it was dry. I had put the crockpot on high for 2 hours and low for another 2. I guess that was too much. My kids didn't like this at all so I won't be making it again unfortunately

The sauce had excellent flavor, and the chicken was moist and tender.  However, I did not care for the bacon in the dish.  It ended up rubbery and gross!  I may try again and just place the bacon on top and then remove it before serving.  Or I may just skip the bacon entirely.  While it added flavor, it also added a lot of fat.

Thought this was an easy, no-think chicken recipe.  Hard to mess it up!  Served with noodles and peas.  Kids really loved it!

We have been eating this most of my life, called Party Chicken, but not in the crock pot.  It was good and I did not wrap them with bacon, but sprinkled some (real) bacon bits on top. I served it with rice. My husband said he just got "tired of eating it" and did not finish his portion.  It had that crock pot flavor.

I am going to make this for dinner tomorrow.  I am going to cook the bacon separately and then put in on for the last 30 minutes or so of the cooking time.  We will see how it turns out.  The recipe sounds great and we can't wait to have it

Very good.  And I'm not a fan of mushrooms.  We had to make our own cream of mushroom soup from scratch since my wife is gluten intolerant.  I really don't know what else to say -- the food was great, but I probably will do homemade cream of chicken instead if I do it again.  The people who like mushrooms who ate it thought it was great.

This is wonderful!  I used about 1/3 lb bacon, added a package of sliced mushrooms because I needed to use them, upped the amount of chicken and tripled the sauce ingredients to feed a crowd.
At the end of cooking I added some chili flakes and black pepper  - personal preference.

made this exactly as written. I actually found bacon that didn't have much fat on it. But all I could taste was the bacon. Next time I would cook the bacon for a bit, then wrap only a couple of pieces around the chicken. And I would dice up the dried beef first.

I call this Rocky Mount chicken named after a B&B in my area.  I serve with rice, green beans and dainty rolls.  Thanks for posting the crockpot version.

Really YUMMY! the only thing I would change is  and I also wrap chicken in some of the dried beef. If  you like it with lots of gravy just add an extra can of the soup I like the cream of mushroom....

This is a family favorite! The original recipe was for the oven. I've gotten lazy and I don't use flour or dried beef. Now getting even lazier and trying it using a whole chicken with the bacon strips laid on top of it, as I have found this done in other recipes on Allrecipes. I'm sure it will taste just as good!

Delicious! A meal the entire family loved. I was unable to get dried beef and made it without. I lined the bottom of the crockpot with slices of bacon instead. Was very yummy!!
