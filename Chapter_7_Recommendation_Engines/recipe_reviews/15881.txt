Pretty good. I've never had pineapple in a pie before. I couldn't really taste the lemon though. Next time I may add lemon pudding or something.

After making several pies for Christmas, my husband asked me for a pineapple pie. I had never heard of a pie with pineapple. So I searched Allrecipes  and found this one. I used 1freshly peeled and cored pineapple instead of canned. Both my husband and daughter loved it.

you will find it's better without the flour.

I had a larger pie plate, (10"), so I doubled the recipe and it worked out perfectly.  I would add more lemon next time and perhaps a tad less flour. I also lightly chopped the pineapple chunks to make it easier to eat.
