This was great - the pineapple added a yummy twist we all enjoyed. I didn't have time to toast the bread, so I omitted that step. Also, I found this recipe loaded with oil and sugar. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup milk to the bread instead. Then, I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup, which was  more than enough. I'll be making this again.

I can't believe the respone I got to this recipe. My family loved this! !!  I made it this morning for Thanksgiving Dinner tonight.  It was super easy and  super quick.  I love bread pudding so I was excited to try something a little different.  I made 1 1/2 times the quanity of ingredients, I also added about 1/4 cup or so of heavy cream.  After 35 mintues it was not really brown or bubbling, so cooked it 15 min more.  The middle was still soggy.  I ended up cooking it about 1 hour and 10 min.  

My family raved so much about this I will be taking it to my Christmas Potluck lunch next month at work and of course making it for all my aunts, uncles, and cousins again on Christmas because they couldn't get enough!!! Thank you for a great new holiday tradition.

I took this to a Mardi Gras dinner and it was a big hit!  After I toasted the bread I removed some of the crust. It fit into a 7 1/2x11 glass pan perfectly. I did cook it for a little while longer, though.  Cooked uncovered towards the end.  I served this with a squirt of canned whipped cream.  I will make this again.

I really liked this and it was very easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased to 1/2 cup margarine and 3/4 cup sugar. I used french bread (without the bottom crust) cuz that's what I had. Took about 50-55 minutes of baking on the middle rack before turning bubbly and golden. It was delicious & just sweet enough to allow for that dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top!

I've made this so many times I think I can do it in my sleep. We are great fans of the recipe as written but on occasion I've used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar, tossed in coconut for a little variance added raisins and no raisins, and if my hubs knows this is for dessert, I assure you it will not serve 8! This is his alltime, bar-none, favorite recipe from this site. Big, big thank you!!

Fantastic recipe.  I made it exactly as listed and then added chopped pecans, which provided a wonderful texture, as well as flavor.  The pudding reminded me of a pineapple upside-down cake.  Will definitely make again, but will reduce butter and sugar each by a 1/4 cup.

This was delicious! I could not get crushed pineapple so I drained a can of chunks and put them in the blender to "crush" them. I had to cook it for longer and I increased the temp to 400*F for that extra 10 mins and I left it uncovered for the extra 10 mins too!!!

I took this to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house and it got stellar reviews. I assembled it the night before then baked it just 30 minutes (or maybe a little more...it got kinda crazy during the last minute prep!). I used craisins and they added just enough of a zing to balance the sweetness of everything else. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. I first must say, I'm not a big fan of Pineapple and asked for recipes on the Buzz to use a Fresh Pineapple. Since we love bread pudding, when someone recommended this, I thought, what the heck...I'll give it try. The photo I uploaded; well, it was the last piece. Yeah, we like it that much! I topped with chopped walnuts, not whipped cream due to intolerance. Fabulous warm, and good cold.

This was delicious! It was a big hit in my family. Even my husband and oldest daughter who don't like bread pudding ate it up. They said they liked this recipe because it was light and refreshing,not heavy and overly rich like other pudding dishes. I will definitley make this one a lot. I plan to cut down a little on the sugar next time and I might add some nuts for crunch.

To start this recipe was simply amazing. I made this for dessert after a dinner I cooked for my boyfriend and his family. They simply loved it. The only change I made was that I used the whole can of crushed pineapple including the juice. The bread pudding was so moist and delicious. My boyfriend's mother is simply in love with bread pudding and she said this was one of the best she has ever tasted. Even months later, they still talk about the delicious dessert. It looks like I will have to make it again. Thanks very much for posting this recipe :)

Very nice and easy bread pudding, but . . . you really, really need a sauce to go with this!  Modified the ingredients as almost everyone else did and only used 1 stick butter (1/2 cup) and only 1/4 c sugar (since there is plenty of sugar in the pineapples.  Recommendation - don't drain the pineapples if you want your pudding to be moist.

Stellar!  Decadent!  Flavors of pineapple and cinnamon married so well together.  I've never tasted bread pudding prior to this recipe, because I dislike eggy flavor, or texture in anything, so I was some-what weary.  I toasted cubed Panettone bread along with pecans and walnuts; nuts enhanced the texture and flavor.  Mixed splash of cream & home-made vanilla extract, coconut extract, cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar until creamy.  I added, toasted pecans & walnuts along with the bread and sprinkled nuts to the bottom of the baking pan; sprinkled extra brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking.  I also baked some in a muffin tin and it worked perfectly as a single portion.  This rich recipe has converted me!  It's delicious hot out of the oven!  Thank you Margie!

It just wasn't to our liking.  We love bread pudding and pineapple, but together, it was okay.  Nothing out of this world.

I really enjoyed the idea of pineapple in the bread pudding! I used Panettone (italian fruit bread with raisins already in it). I used only half a cup of sugar, 1/2 of the pineapple juice from the can, 1 1/2 cup milk and 5 eggs. I really just added milk into this after reading so many other recipes and seeing milk I thought it was essential.. and it was! Can't imagine how non moist this would have been without the milk which is why I kept this review at 4 instead of 5! Still this recipe inspired the use of pineapple and that was amazing enough! try it out!

I reduced the eggs to 4, the butter to 1/2c, and added some milk.  I cut the sugar in half because I wanted this for breakfast - it's like having baked french toast.  I didn't serve with whipped cream.  It was a really nice twist with the pineapple.

Very good.  I'll make this when I have to feed an army for breakfast as it's quick and easy.  I used drained pineapple chunks and leftover brat buns.  Added the cinnamon to the egg mixture.  Turned out great.

Excellent.  I used blueberries instead of rasins and it turned out fantastic.  Blueberries and Pineapple made a great combination.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is such a big hit every time I make it. I make it for almost every lunch or dinner that I host because I'm requested especially to make it every time! I use fresh pineapple chopped in to little pieces and it turns out fabulous. The last time I was out of pineapple I made it with apples. Still turned out amazing although pineapples really make it special. LOVE IT!

Like several others, I changed it up a little. I used all of the butter called for, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda. I also added the pineapple with the juice along with 1/2 cup of milk. I added a few butterscotch morsels instead of the raisins. I would add toasted almonds on top also. I made a Splenda/Cinnamon blend to sprinkle on top. I took the foil off the last 5 minutes or so to brown slightly. Turned out great. Will definitely make again.

The only reason I rated this 4*s is because mine came out very dry and I think that was because I drained my pineapple very well.  It needed a little bit more liquid.  I followed the recipe except that I use Splenda blend (1/2) instead of the 1 cup of sugar.  I only used 1/2 cup margarine.  I also used 100% wheat bread since that's all that I had.  Since it was a little dry, I microwaved some all-fruit orange marmalade for about 25 seconds and pour this over the pudding....it was 5*s...  I also did not have raisins so I used dried cherries. I also sprinkle pecans over it.    I can't wait to make this again.

This was pretty good.  I didn't read and didn't cover it, I think it would have been a lot better if I had.  I will deffinately make it again though and experiment, maybe with coconut extract also???

This was a fast, easy dessert to make.  My family loved it!!!!!
Update: Made this for super bowl and added coconut to it.  Next evening I made coconut creme pudding and put it in the remaining bread pudding.  Everybody loved it!!!

Very yummy bread pudding. Sweet, buttery and moist. I added in a dried cherry, cranbery blueberry medley, since that is what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe!! I added the pineapple juice (didn't drain), 1 cup of milk and used a bag of Martin's potato bread stuffing instead of the bread and didn't toast them (had some left over from Thanksgiving and needed to use it). Everyone loved it!!

Instead of sprinkling with cinnamon, I added 2 tsp. cinnamon to the egg mixture and blended together with the bread.  It is really good!

My family loved this!! The pineapple makes all the difference! Baked it as-is but I reduced the sugar to 2/3 c and sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on top instead of cinnamon. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Instead of putting the bread in the oven, I cut it in cubes and let it sit out in a bowl uncovered for a day. As others suggested, I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and the butter to 1/2 cup. I mixed the butter in with the egg mixture, along with half of the cinnamon, and sprinkled the rest of the cinnamon on top. I baked it uncovered for 45 minutes. Tasted great.

Very good!  Quite easy to make, too.  I didn't notice that the recipe instructed to drain the pineapple.  I just dumped in the whole can, as is.  It didn't seem to matter.

I tried this today to use the hardened french loaf that I had forgot about on the counter...and it turned out fantastic!  I did cut back on the sugar though but still found it to be plenty sweet.  I did not have crushed pineapple so I used a can of chunk pineapple.  It looked very nice but the chucks were so much hotter than the rest of the dish and took a while to cool off that I would recommend against this.  Thanks for sharing this...I will make it again.

Made a few modifications because of what I had on hand. Used hot dog buns, cut butter to 1/2 cup. Used 1/2 eggs and 1/2 egg beaters, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, craisons instead of raisons..YUMMY!! All gone in a flash. Served with no-sugar vanilla ice cream! Don't think twice about trying it. Pretty fool-proof I would say.

WONDERFUL! Simple to make.  It looks beautiful and tastes so good!  I usually hate bread pudding, but this is awesome!  I did use a little more butter and vanilla and cooked it longer than the recipe required.  More sugar could have probably been added too.

Wow! Followed other's recommendations and used only one stick of butter and 2/3 cup sugar. Dried blueberries was a perfect flavor match. The pudding was too dry for me so I drizzled some of the pinapple juice on top and at the edges. Next time will add the pineapple juice for moister texture.

Very different since there is no custard, but delicious! I think next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup since it seems extra sweet to me.

Fantastic!  I also reduced the butter and sugar.  I used stale hot dog buns and substituted dried apricots for the currants (because that's what I had on hand).  An absolute keeper, and a great way to use bread you might otherwise feed to the chickens. ;)

This recipe is wonderful!  I'm generally not a big fan of bread pudding but I had a lot of bread that was getting ready to go bad soon. I followed the recipe exactly.  I topped each serving with a little bit of caramel sauce.  (I got that recipe from the peach bread pudding recipe on here.) A new family favorite.

VERY GOOD, Just a little too sweet so next time will bring sugar down to 3/4 cup and will try using half brown sugar and white sugar.  Didn't add the raisins/currants.  Used 1 cup of melted butter instead of 3/4; Used 20 ounce can of tibits instead of crushed pineapple; added the cinnamon in the egg batter instead of on top; and cooked uncovered.  Next time will try adding a little cream cheese to it! Will be making  this again very soon!  Thanks for sharing.

This bread pudding is delicious!! I used wheat bread, 12 slices to fill up the 9x13 glass dish I used. I did not toast the bread because I didn't have time. I took advice from some of the other reviews and decreased the butter (to 1/2 cup) and sugar (to 3/4 cup). It was the perfect sweetness, but I think I should have used at least 3/4 cup of butter and maybe 1 more egg. The wheat bread I used was bigger slices than traditional white bread.  It was not as moist as I would have liked, but that was just because of my changes. I was worried about using wheat bread, but it was still awesome!! I will definitely make this again. Easy and delicious!!

i just made this and it's delicious! but i altered it as follows:  only used 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter and a 1/4 cup whole milk in place of the 3/4 c butter AND i cut the sugar in half and used a 1/4 cup blue agave nectar- i think that added a bit more moisture, plus it takes less to be just as sweet as sugar but has a lower glycemic impact than sugar.  OH! and i also only had three eggs on hand, so i used them and hoped for the best... and it came out fine!  so all around i guess i made it a bit healthier but just as tasty.  :)

This was DELICIOUS!  I used some leftover bakery rolls, and because it didn't seem like enough bread as called for in the recipe, I used only 4 eggs, decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup of butter.  Only had an 8oz. can of crushed pineapple and golden raisins on hand.  Turned out wonderful!  This is a keeper!  Will definitely make again!

I had some King's Hawaiian rolls and shredded coconut left after holiday meals and baking, and I wanted to create a Hawaiian-style bread pudding. Came across this recipe and used it as a great foundation. Based on the number of rolls I had (8) and the number of servings I wanted to make (4), I scaled this recipe in 1/2, but used the whole can of crushed pineapple. I also cut the sugar in 1/2 (after scaling) and omitted the currants/raisins because I added about a cup of shredded coconut and about 1/2 cup of pecan pieces, both of which I toasted slightly (of course, macadamia nuts would have been more Hawaiian, but I didn't have any on hand - will definitely use next time).

We really enjoyed this!  Much less "custardy" that most, which is what my husband doesn't usually like about bread pudding.  Not overly sweet either.  Used golden raisins.

I've made this before, but I don't think I rated it.  I doubled this recipe since I was making it for a birthday gathering.  The only thing I didn't double was the sugar.  I used 1-1/2 cups, NOT 2.  It was scrumptious and not over sweet.  In fact someone commented that this was the first pineapple bread pudding they liked.  Usually it's too sweet.  Don't double the sugar, you won't miss it.  Otherwise I didn't change anything.

As a lover of a good bread pudding, I wondered how it would turn out using no milk,well it was fabulous. The best i have ever had.

My favorite bread pudding recipe because it's not soggy! Update: I've made this a dozen times at least and people who don't like bread pudding or pineapple are often coming back for seconds. If you do want to try a variation though, I have a suggestion that worked for me: Leave out the currants/raisins and put blueberries in place of the pineapple. Sprinkle some walnuts on top and it is SO good - especially at breakfast.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried!  Every time I make this bread pudding, people rave about how "great" it tastes.  It's become my signature dish at social gatherings.  Hint:  Serve the bread pudding warm with some vanilla ice cream.  The contrast in temperature adds a nice twist and it tastes awesome!  Another suggestion would be to use a little less sugar than indicated in the recipe.  It was a little sweet the first time I made it and I have since reduced the sugar content.  Kudos to whoever came up with this recipe!

Fantastic and easy recipe!  My family went nuts over this one.  I did use brown sugar/gran sugar (equal parts) in this one and served it with some Vanilla Bean ice cream and drizzled everything with a bit of caramel sauce.  It was DELICIOUS!  Will make this again!

This bread pudding is the best!!!  I get into so much trouble if I don't make it often enough for my family.  I do use raisen bread instead of white bread...I sure white bread works just fine.  Thanks!!!

So easy and delicious! I reduced the white sugar and used brown as well. Next time, I will not drain the pineapple as suggested,too. Everyone who tried this loved it. Will definitely make again.

So delicious! I sprinkled it with powdered sugar once it was done baking instead of using whipped topping. This was my first time making bread pudding and I'm eager to try other recipes like this one!

made this for dessert on Christmas eve....best bread pudding ever.  pineapple adds sweetness but doesn't overpower the dish.  I accidentally added more vanilla than it called for...cap came off and it didn't matter as the dish is so good!

I have made this many times now, I get so many compliments, even my grandmother raved about it! I've used it with regular bread, with leftover rolls/buns and it always comes out perfect! If you make it I'd advice doubling the recipe because this goes fast!

I cubed my wheat berry bread in 1/4" cubes, cut the crusts, added thin strips of granny smith apples (instead of currants/raisins) and added 1/4 cup of milk to top of mixture (before pressing down with spatula).  Also, decreased the sugar.  Also used nutmeg and a tad of cinnamon for topper.

I did exactly as the recipe directed and added a pinch of nutmeg. The flavor is good but the consistency is a little off.

I served this with whipped cream on the side for a potluck, and everyone loved it! I was sad there were no leftovers :( I agree that the sugar and butter can be lowered a bit.  I didn't have any vanilla extract on hand, so used almond extract instead, which was delicious! Also, I added unsweetened coconut flakes for a tropical twist. YUM!

This was fantastic - finally a recipe my 4-yo and 1-yo both love!  I used whole wheat bread, reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup, and added an extra egg and a little milk, and it came out fantastic!

This was the best bread pudding I have ever eaten! Not too sweet, not too bland, just perfect! It was a huge hit with my family! I did add extra raisins and had to bake it a little longer than the recipe called for, but it was awesome! I will, without a doubt, make this again! Loved it with the pineapple also!!
