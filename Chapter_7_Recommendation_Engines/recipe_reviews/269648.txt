I made these with gluten-free flour, added a tspn of vanilla extract, and refrigerated overnight. My niece and I used cookie cutters to make snowman and snowflake cookies. They were yummy, but not exceptional.

These are phenomenal cookies and I will be making these for the rest of my life! I make a lot of olive oil cookies but have never made ones including egg, so the result here is totally different. Theyâ€™re chewy and delicious, just like a typical sugar cookie. I followed the recipe to a T except I used einkorn flour. I experimented by making some totally plain; some plain but rolling in sugar before baking; some with chunks of chopped dark chocolate; and some with the chocolate and also walnuts. I found that if making plain, rolling into a ball and rolling in sugar made for a prettier cookie. I actually think I prefer plain vs chocolate, but really they were all delicious. I can imagine experimenting further - maybe adding some lemon zest to the plain version? Thank you so much for this recipe, a lifelong keeper!
