OMG! These were so easy and so delicious! I must admit, I did cut back on the chili-garlic sauce...I wasn't sure just how hot these would get.  I threw everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for about a half hour. I threaded the shrimp onto the skewers and grilled - it doesn't get much easier than this. These were a perfect little appetizer!

Like the recipe is written, I skewered the shrimp and then basted, thinking it would be less messy than saucing them and then skewering.  These shrimp were tasty and certainly easy to prepare.

I loved this!!!!! Sriracha sauce is one of my favorite sauces to use on everything and this was just as I hoped, very spicy and sweet. I marinated my shrimp in this and then grilled. The sauce carmelized on the shrimp while grilling. Just delicious and so very easy. I served these shrimp on a salad with some fresh avacado, heart of palm, chick peas, tomatoes, and greens. Excellent!

Easy & delicious!  I tossed the shrimp with the sauce - skewered and grilled - no basting - perfect. Thank you.

Made this for Recipe Group...Not sure how to rate this b/c I really didn't know what chili-garlic sauce was. Going by the other reviews, I decided to use sriracha sauce. I only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for (1/4 cup) w/ the full amount of honey and it was waaaay too spicy. I can't imagine using a whole 1/2 cup. I would think it would be inedible at that point. I ended up cutting the heat w/ some sweet chili sauce and that helped. The flavor was good, it was just too much heat...Did I use the wrong chili-garlic sauce???

I made this for the weekly recipe group selection. I had two pounds of shrimp and the sauce amount was plenty. Since the recipe doesn't specify the kind of chili garlic sauce, I used our favorite Mae Ploy and added in a couple tablespoons of Sriracha sauce and I reduced the honey a bit since Mae Ploy is already pretty sweet. I tossed the shrimp with the marinade, reserving a small amount for basting and let the shrimp marinate for about an hour. Was very tasty shrimp and we all really enjoyed them. Served with Easy Asian Pasta salad from this site, a great combo.

I had planned to grill these but my grill was giving me problems, SO I changed plans and threw everything in a saute pan and just cooked it all up!  Taste great, very yummy, and served over a brown rice pilaf :)

Prepared this for the recipe group June 22, 2014...well, it doesn't get much easier than this!  This was simple and delicious.  I added a splash of mirin wine for a little acid in the mix.  If you love sweet and spicy flavors, this is a great recipe for you!  We loved this.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Recipe Group Selection:  14, June 2014 ~ I made these for my husband, well, I mixed up the sauce and my husband grilled his own shrimp.  I used equal parts sriracha and honey.  He said it was plenty warm, but he loved the taste on the shrimp.  He gave the recipe a 5+ star rating, and my shrimp size a 3 rating!  Being that I don't eat shrimp, I had no say in rating this recipe, but DH loved it.

Recipe Group Selection for June 14, 2014 – This was my first time using chile-garlic sauce and I have to say it carries a kick.  I’m glad I lessened the amount of the chile-garlic sauce using only 1 tablespoon of garlic-chile sauce and 1/4 cup of honey.  This was quick and very tasty.

This is a simple recipe that packs a ton of flavor!  I didn't feel like grilling so I cooked mine on the stove in the marinade.

Really annoying to see the negative "way too spicy" comments when the wrong ingredient is used!  If you didn't use chili-garlic sauce, then don't rate it!  Hint:  chili-garlic still has heat, but it also has a sweetness to it--sriracha is pure chili heat.

Excellent Shrimp, we BBQ this often - to those who used the Sriracha sauce because you couldn't find Chili Garlic Sauce, it's at Walmart in the Oriental Food section

I would make this again, but the next time using much larger shrimp.  I scaled down the ingredients to match the size of shrimp I was using.  The smaller shrimp just cannot hold the marinade like the larger ones can.  The flavor was good though, with just a bit of heat.  I did add some sriracha to the marinade to make it even more spicey.

I did not make any changes.  It was really good and so easy.  I put on a grilling tray on the grill.  If you want more spice do half garlic chili sc and half siracha.  I would definitely make again.

Very simple and tasty.  I marinaded my shrimp for a couple of hours and the only thing I added was a bit of oil and Chinese five spice.

I also made up another batch of this marinade and dunked some boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I think I liked it even more.

Used a bit of srichacha  and tweaked it with a little honey to taste (my husband is diabetic so we have to watch the quantity), and sautéed  the shrimp in a pan. This was the easiest, quickest recipe --no marinating needed — my family loved it!  Thank you for the recipe!

I question definition of medium shrimp especially if using only 6 skewers.  I like to have space in between my shrimp on skewers to cook better, so chose preferred size would have been a better direction and use as many skewers as you want.  They all marinate the same.

I have a habit of going for more complicated recipes, thinking they will taste better.  Trying to break that habit, while still eating healthy and this recipe was perfect.  Everyone loved this. Used sambal oelek  for the chili paste, even though I wasn't sure if it would work.  It was perfect.  Husband grilled the shrimp.  Even our 16 year old, who has said he doesn't like shrimp or spicy food, loved these.

Loved how simple this was with only a few ingredients, so it's perfect for a weeknight dinner. Made as is. I loved the kick, but it was a little too spicy for my husband, so we might cut down on the chile-garlic sauce on his half next time!

I'm a month behind making this for recipe group but it would've tasted the same in June! lol. I loved this one. Sriracha and honey? You just can't go wrong. No marinating and still packing a punch? Even better! Warning though, it is somewhat spicy. We have a heat wimp in the house so we only basted one side of his shrimp and they were perfect for him and still had the flavour. I will be making this one again soon! Thank-you TheGoddessGiGi!
