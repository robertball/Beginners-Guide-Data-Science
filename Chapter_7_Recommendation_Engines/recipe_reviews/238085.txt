Really simple, really good. I didn't have Gorgonzola, so we added some shredded cheese to it at the end. Also added cumin and made toast to serve it on. Healthy and delicious!

Made this for dinner as a trial for a new backcountry recipe.  This one will go in our regular rotation at home and maybe on the trail too!

This is super delicious and I've made it part of my usual recipes as a breakfast meal. I didn't change anything.

This was delicious! I added a sprinkle of greek seasoning and inused a shallot in place of garlic since we were out. I like another reviewer's suggestion of adding hot sauce! I will definitely give that a try next time.

Easy to make, only difference is that serve it on a thin egg white layer, so that I can wrap it like a burrito. Absolutely Delish! Will make it often!! Have had it for dinner 2 nights in a row!

This is really delicious.  I just recently began eating tofu and this is the simplest dish I've tried-- and so very tasty.   I added extra spinach -- doubled what was called for but I think you could add a lot more -- if you like spinach-- because the tofu and cheese makes the dish quite rich.   If I had a bumper crop of spinach I would quadruple the amount of spinach.
