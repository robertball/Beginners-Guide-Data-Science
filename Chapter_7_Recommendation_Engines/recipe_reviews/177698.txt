I have been making this for 20 yrs.  I learned that putting less mushroom soup in the patties helped with the falling apart.  But what really mattered is not frying them.  I bake them in a roaster so there is no need to flip the beef.  Baking them doesn't char the outsides and they taste more like salisbury steak vs fried hamburger.  My kids are over 30 and still come running when I make this recipe...

just finished devouring it!! yum! I took the advise of others and knew that I needed more bread crumbs and seasoning, so I had a stroke of brilliance and added 2 cups of Stove Top Stuffing mix! Oh MY so yummy, moist FLAVORFUL! Also, I got excited about this recipe and had my mind set before I realized I didn't have any eggs, but turns out I didn't need them, I added about a table spoon of olive oil to substtute. the patties stuck together wonderfully. we'll be making this AGAIN and AGAIN!

I like to use fresh bread crumbs in the "steaks". For a little more flavor, I add a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning, onion/garlic powder and a good measure of fresh ground pepper. My kids like this over buttered egg noodles but I like it over MeMe's Mashed Potatoes. Pure comfort food, like something my Mom would have made for me as a kid.

Have made this for years, thought it was my mother's recipe until she gave me a copy from a magazine!   We love it.   I use a large can of Mushroom soup to get more gravy.  Instead of real onions, I use about a tablespoon of dried onion.   I only turn them once when browning and remove them in order to mix the gravy and add mushrooms ...then return the burgers. We love them served with egg noodles.

First time i ate Salisbury steak fixed this way.  It was so yummy! And yes, mine fell apart when i cooked them to, so i guess i had to much wet ingredients.  But they were still very good.  Will be making these again.

The recipe was pretty good, simple and got everything in my pantry. I'm only giving 4 star as I made a few adjustment. Many reviewers recommended adding more spices to the meat for flavor so that's what I did. I added garlic powder, onion powder, steak spice, worcestershire sauce and few drops of Frank's Red Hot. I also used more breadcrumbs and even Stove Top stuffing as one reviewer suggested. I did not want to risk the patties falling apart so I covered them breadcrumb before browning. Browned them, added mushrooms halves, not slices, so I can tastes them better, and simmer with some mushroom soup for awhile, flipping occasionally so all patties soak up the mushroom soup evenly. I added some dried chives near the end as well. Overall, recipe was simple but shaping the patties was a bit time consuming for me. 1 pound gave me 9 patties and I hand kneaded the spices into the beef for even distribution. I also find that mushroom sauce a bit salty so maybe I'll dilute it a bit more with milk or bit of hot water. My husband enjoyed it and I would make it again.

I seasoned the ground beef with salt and pepper and I also doubled the amount of bread crumbs and my steaks didn't fall apart. I grated the onion with the large holes of a cheese grater, and it helped the onion meld with the meat better instead of having big chunks of chopped onion in the steaks, and it was faster than chopping to boot!

Due to the reviews stating that the steaks fell apart, I used cube steak instead of ground beef, omitting the bread crumbs, egg and oil. I sauteed the onion and mushrooms before adding the mushroom soup and 1/4 cup of milk to the pan. I covered and cooked for about 15 minutes on low heat. This was pretty good. Needed a touch of salt, but that's it!

Didn't put the soup in the meat patties as they were moist enough and used all of it at the end with more mushrooms (which I semi-microwaved first).

Great recipe.  I added another can of soup and about 1/2 c of milk for the sauce since I wanted gravy for mashed potatoes.  You also can't go wrong with fresh mushrooms.

My family really enjoyed this.  I added onion powder, garlic powder and worcestershire sauce to the beef as some had suggested.  Also, I used 2 slices of torn bread instead of the dry crumbs.  The gravy was too thick the first time I made it so I now add milk to get the consistency that I want.

Excellent!  I too added more spice and I also microwaved the meat.  If in a hurry, 8-10 minutes on high.  Turn meat half-way through.  Then add the rest of your gravy/sauce.  Heat on high for 3-4 mins.  You're ready to consume..........

Mine fell apart, but they tasted good. I seasoned the meat mixture up the way I wanted it, worcesthire, liquid smoke, paprika, herbs. I recommend using less soup and more egg. Also I made a homemade quick beef gravy with the pan drippings and fresh mushrooms, YUM!

These were great!  I didn't  follow the recipe exactly (didn't measure & didn't have mushrooms), but they were still yummy.  I used 1 slice of bread and a couple slices of left-over onion. (I use a Handy Chopper to make bread crumbs and mince the onion.)  They were very delicate to turn over and one broke in half, but it made it taste even better cause the gravy cooked into it more.   So good!

This was pretty good.  My husband REALLY liked it.  My 12 year old  didn't like it  so much due to the mushrooms and onions.  I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because really, mushroom soup does NOT equal gravy to me.  Perhaps the addition of some DARKER soup, (onion?) or maybe a package of french onion soup mix added to the mushroom soup would have made it better.  I DID add french onion soup to the meat which gave it a great flavor... maybe I should have used only half the packet and the other half in the gravy....

Only gave 4 stars since I made modifications, but this came out VERY good. I cannot cook with raw onion in my house so I used a packet of dry onion soup mix and added it to the beef. I kept everything else the same except the remaining can of soup I thinned with a bit of milk and a dash of worsteshire sauce and cooked as directed. This was VERY flavorful and tasted great with a side of mashed potatoes. Thinning out the soup made more gravy to put on the potatoes. Yummy!

I had my doubts about this after reading some of the reviews but I took the suggestion of others and added extra bread crumbs and didn't turn the patties often (I still had two break up).  Also I used Italian bread crumbs, dry onions and added salt and pepper.  I ended up adding some jarred gravy since there didn't seam to be enough in the pan when it was finished.  This was excellent and we will make it again soon.

Very good.  Must be careful with turning them or they fall apart.  I did not add mushrooms.  I removed cooked steaks from pan.  I then put in the soup and added 3/4 can of milk to make a gravy.  Then I returned the steaks to the gravy and warmed them.

YUMMY!! I had never even thought of making Salisbury Steak until we had the frozen dinner type. My husband said, "Hey, I bet you could make this better." Little does he know, all of YOU make these recipes better before I even look them up! :) I adjusted the recipe to feed 7 and the "steaks" came out pretty big in size and flavor. Loved this with mashed taters and extra gravy--thank you!

Taste was good, but these patties would not stick together for anything, and simply wouldn't cook right. I finally had to put it in a loaf pan and bake it. Also, I added more salt and pepper, and worcestershire sauce, so while it wasn't an ideal way to serve it, it still tasted good.

This was okay and we ate it but I didn't like it at all. Too oniony for starters. I had to add some beef stock and some milk to think the soup to make a gravy. No way was it going to boil for ten minutes with the soup if I hadn't. These fell apart easily and I had to be really careful when moving them so they wouldn't break apart. Don't bother making this dish as there are much better recipes here with as little effort required.

Tried this recipe and the flavor of the meat patties was great.  Just what I would expect in a Salisbury steak. Problem was they fell apart.   I would leave out the egg and add more bread crumbs.  If you are doing this recipe "as is" first then make sure that the meat mixture isn't too wet. I added milk to the soup to make the gravy so that the mushrooms would cook. Husband liked this recipe so it's a keeper.  Thank you for posting.

My patties always fall apart using this recipe. Good flavor though. Next time I won't add any soup at all to the mix. I'll add it to the pan after browning meat.

This was a savory dish with great flavor. I added a little garlic, Italian seasoning and used dried onions. It was easy to prepare and everyone enjoyed it.

Recipe is great. This is my second time making it. The first time I made it exactly by the directions and loved it. This time I didn't have any bread crumbs so I ground up some all bran cereal instead. It was great and healthier!

This was ok at best. Very plain. And as another reviewer stated, mushroom soup does not qualify as gravy. Will not be making it again.

Second time around making this dish and these fall apart worse than ever. Flavors are there if you add some herbs and seasoning, not nearly enough sauce or gravy.  Seriously unimpressed :(  Try increasing bread crumbs or including 1/4 cup oatmeal in addition.

As is I rated 4 * but with personal changes I would rate it 5 *. I doubled recipe adding salt and pepper, onion and garlic powder rather than fresh onions, kids do not like the crunch factor of fresh onions. I only added 1/4 c. of the mushroom soup to the meat mixture so the steaks would stay together. Sauteed the mushrooms then the steaks in oil. For the gravy I mixed the rest of the c of m soup with about a 1 1/2 c. beef stock, poured over the steaks and mushrooms simmered until tender and cooked through. Served with mashed potatoes and the gravy and green peas. Delicious!

My family LOVED this recipe...even the kids! I toasted 2 slices of whole wheat bread for the bread crumbs, added salt and pepper to the meat mixture, and a little milk to the soup to thin it down a little and it turned out great! (even without fresh mushrooms) Only flip the patties one time to keep them from falling apart.

The soup is way too thick, need to add milk or something. Hamburger patties fell apart, way too much onion, no seasoning. Would not recommend!

Just one thing to say I made this for my family and they all thought it was most excellent.I used Italian style bread crumbs and I did not add any salt or pepper. The Golden Mushroom Soup from Campbell's provided all the flavor and seasoning that is needed. I would suggest cooking a tin or two of Pillsbury Grand Biscuits-Butter Flavor to wipe up the gravy afterward... Umm umm good... Definitely a 4 to 5 star meal. By the way I used ground chuck, 85% - 15% no need to drain any grease there was very little.

I love this recipe. I use a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of golden mushroom soup, mixed together for the gravy. It gives it a lot more flavor in my opinion.

I just tried the recipe, after reading all of the reviews and using what I have in the house. It's good to me but the family will try later. I did add more seasoning (garlic, no sodium seasoning and a little Lipton's Beefy Mushroom soup mix) to the beef based on "bland" comments of others. I also wanted more gravy so I add a package of low sodium brown gravy to the soup and mushrooms. If you want tons of gravy you may need more soup/gravy added but for us it's good. Meat does fall apart a bit so you need to be careful when flipping but not a big issue to me for a quick hearty meal.

Delicious dinner!  Hubby doesn't like mushrooms, so I subbed onions and bell pepper.  Seasoned ground beef with garlic and worchestershire - just make it your way!  Add mashed taters and garlic bread and dinner is served.  Hubby is up doing dishes now!!  This one will become one of our regulars.

I tried this and it turned out amazing, with the exception of falling apart next time I will not use as much cream of mushroom in the mixture. My Fiance absolute loved it and said it was better the next day for lunch.

Super easy recipe my family really liked. I added a can of milk to the soup for extra gravy. I also  added  an onion soup seasoning packet 1/2 to the gravy and 1/2 to the meat mixture along with garlic.

I doubled the recipe and my family loved it.  The presentation was not too good as the patties fell apart when I turned them.  I followed the recipe except for the gravy.  I added some flour and oil for thickening, then added the rest of the mushroom soup.  I will definitely use this recipe again but will try adding more bread crumbs next time.

Very simple, very fast, but I should have followed my gut and sauteed the onions first. Every bite had raw onion in it, and I'm not a huge onion fan.
Not the Salisbury Steak I remember as a kid, but it fed us in a hurry, and I might make it again someday if I'm in a pinch.

I used cream of celery soup and added salt, pepper, and garlic to the recipe. I think it needs a bit more bread crumbs, because the "steaks" fell apart when you flipped them. It was delicious, despite the presentation, and my whole family enjoyed it!

The taste was awesome.  However the patties crumbled apart so it didn't make a great presentation. It could have been from me not measuring but it still tasted wonderful!
