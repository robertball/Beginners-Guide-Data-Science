Had some extra lemons and some extra whiskey so I baked this exactly as written. What size pan should be used?  The one I used was too big.  If i bake this again I'll use something like a 10 x 10.  Couldn't taste the ginger and I used more than a "pinch".  Couldn't taste the whiskey.  A little dry but would be good with some fresh fruit on it.  Since I'm a rookie baker I'll try another recipe before trying this one again
