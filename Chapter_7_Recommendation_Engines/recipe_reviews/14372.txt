I thought this was great, but there was way too much mayo and sour cream.  I used about a third of what the recipe called for the next time I made it, and it was perfect.  I also love capers, so I added a few more.  Overall, it was great!  Definately my new tuna recipe!

MMMMMMM....Love tuna salad and this was really yummy. I didn't have any almonds in the house, so I had to omit them. I cut back on the mayo and also added green pepper. I put this on an english muffin added some shredded cheddar and put it under the broiler for a tasty tuna melt! Thanks Patricia!

Interesting blend of textures of flavours.  Unfortunately, I did not have almonds on hand so I omitted that from the recipe.  I can imagine, however, the crunchiness from the nuts would have been a great addition. I also used yellow peppers in replacement of the celery.  I've never tried tuna salad with sour cream, so this was an interesting taste.  Next time, I would probably add less of both the sour cream and the mayo as it was a bit too creamy for me.  Overall, I quite enjoyed it.

It was really good, but there was way too much mayo and sour cream for me, I would cut the amount of each in half next time. I would also either omit the capers or 1/2 the olives because it was a bit salty for me. Lastly I added a dash or black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice which added the kick I needed. I'll probably make this again with the changes.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. We particularly like it served on extra Sourdough bread, but have enjoyed it on a bed of lettuce for a light and cool summer dinner. Since I am not a person who loves tuna (but know I should eat some fish now and then) all these tasty ingredients effectively mask the fishy-ness that keeps me from eating tuna. Thanks for giving me a tuna salad recipe that I can really enjoy.

I agree with another reviewer, there are too many flavors together.  It was pretty overwhelming.  I don't think it had a bad taste, it was just very strong.

I felt the capers made the salad too salty. I used black olives instead of green. I might make this again with some different ingredients.

There really isn't anything special about this recipe.  I think there are actually too many ingredients, i.e., having olives, celery, green onions, capers, and almonds each separately would be better than combining them all together.

I thought this was great!  I did leave out the olives since I thought that the capers would provide enough of a salty bite, and I am glad that I did.  This had both a great texture and taste.

Yummy.  These are some very nice additions to your regular "run of the mill" tuna salad.  I thoroughly enjoyed this in my sandwhich at lunch today.

Just made this and it was really good. I needed a recipe without relish bc I ran out so I took a risk and tried this. I made as is at first obmitting the almonds and using one big spoon of sour cream and two big spoons of mayo. I only made 1/2 the recipe. It was good as is but I added another stalk of celery, more worcestershire, garlic powder, onion powder and cayanne to give it a kick. Do not add salt whatever you do. I also read some reviews added lemon juice but I added the juice from my bananna peppers instead. Next time I would use more caperes than olives. I am really glad I found a recipe that tastes good without the typical ingredients.

I made this exactly according to recipe, only using reduced fat mayonnaise/sour cream. For me, the capers and green olives together made it way too salty. I think if I omitted the capers, it would be perfect. Honestly, it reminds me quite a bit of a Dirty Martini Dip I've made before--only with tuna fish.

Yummy! I made some for easy lunches this week. The only thing I added was a dash of black pepper. Everything else was the same and it was really good.

Great flavor and texture.  I like the crunchiness in the tuna salad from the almonds and celery.  I made tuna melts with this recipe.  They were excellent. Whole wheat English muffin slice, a slice of tomato, a heaping serving of the tuna on top of the tomato, then a slice of provolone cheese.  Top lightly with dried oregano.  Broil for 2-4 minutes, or until top of cheese is brown.  Serve with a side salad and alfalfa sprouts.

Excellent start to a great recipe...I used it as a base to add other ingredients. I reduced the mayonnaise down to 1/4 c and 1/4 sour cream as it was way too much. Then I added 1 tsp curry powder and 3/4 cup of rinsed canned garbanzo bean. Yum!

I used 1/2 cup sour cream and skipped the mayonnaise.  I used cashews instead of almonds and left out the capers because I didn't have any.  It's pretty good, thanks for the recipe.

Liked all the stuff in it...added texture and flavor, however, it was missing a flavor that I thought capers would provide.  Need a tuna salad with bite.

This was wonderfully tasty, used ½ the mayo (olive oil mayo) and used nonfat plain greek yogurt (½ amount) in place of sour cream. Also used more of capers (3 tbsp) omitted olives, freshly ground pepper to taste, added juice of 1 lemon, and 1 teaspoon of dill otherwise followed recipe. YUMMY and HEALTHY :-)

Just made this for my lunch and it's a keeper!  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions.  I didn't add the capers(I don't like capers) and I left out the almonds(I like almonds, but not in my tuna).  I also cut the recipe in half because it was just for me.  I used light sour cream and a combo of light & regular Hellmans Mayo, to cut some of the calories.  Love the addition of the olives and worchestshire sauce!!  Served mine over a bed of lettuce...will definitely make this again!  Thx

This is now my new favorite tuna salad! I didn't have celery so I onitted it and I also didn't use the sour cream and used way less mayo. Awesome :)

I was looking for a great tuna salad with capers but this one just contained too many flavors for my taste.

I kind of forgot I was eating tuna! The almonds and the capers coat the salad with a nutty flavor that take away the fish taste from the tuna. I added a small amount of fresh ground pepper. It was yummy my family enjoyed the variation of our normal tuna sandwiches...

I've been making this tuna salad for years now. It's the only recipe I use. As some of the reviewers mentioned, sometimes the mayo/sour cream mixture is too much. I find alot depends on how much you drain the tuna. If the tuna is wet, you need less mayo, etc. I always keep capers and olives on hand just for this tuna salad!

I have made this recipe numerous times for several years for many others and virtually everyone with few exceptions loved it! Many requested the recipe as well.  I love this as a extravagant change from the more usual and yet well liked tuna salad recipes. Bob Acker

Really good, I will continue to make this. I liked the crunch.
