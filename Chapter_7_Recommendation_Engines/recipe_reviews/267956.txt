This was a simple and tasty dish. It was so much fun too. I did have a little trouble getting the cheese strings to go around the meatballs. Be sure to have the cheeses completely separated into strings and ready to use. It took me so long to get the cheese on the meatballs they started to get cooled off. Even so, I definitely plan to make these again

Hardest part is making the coffin. I used fresh meatballs as I'm not a fan of frozen meat. Love the creativity of it.

I had fun making this recipe and my family loved it! Easy to make and easy to clean up. Now, that's my kind of recipe!
