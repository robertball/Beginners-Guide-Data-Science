OMG! So Good! I have to admit I didn't use their version of a cajun spices.  I used Cajun Seasoning Mix from this site instead.  This is more like a rub for the chicken. It came out great. I also made a cajun mayo for the chicken sandwiches.

This was very good but I didn't like the celery salt in it for some reason. I made it again and used the Cajun Seasoning Mix from this site instead of the spices called for and we liked it much better.

I cooked these on the George Foreman grill.  I omitted the celery salt and used onion powder and used garic powder in place of garlic salt.  I agree that putting them in the fridge for a couple of hours really helped with the flavor.  Thanks for the post.

We loved this! I did make some changes. I grilled three chicken breasts but still kept the spice amounts the same.  I used ALL of it on just the three breasts and I thought that was the perfect amount. I also omitted the lemon pepper as I never use that spice. I threw in some chili powder instead. It was REALLY spicy. My 6 year old must have had three big glasses of water during dinner :) But if you like spicy like we do then this is a definite keeper. Will absolutely make it again! Oh, almost forgot...I rubbed the seasonings on the chicken yesterday and then our dinner plans changed so my chicken ended up sitting in the frig for a little over 24 hours...getting spicier and spicier as the clock ticked on :)

LOVED this recipe!  My husband and I like spicy and we got spicy, finally, in this recipe.  I nearly doubled the seasonings and marinated the chicken for 6 hours.  Husband ate it without bread and I had it on whole grain bread for a healthy meal!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a really good sandwich. Super easy to prepare and makes for a hearty meal. The tomatoes and lettuce are critical to its flavor...don't omit them. I used a cheese Kaiser roll, soft and perfect. Don't forget to pound the chicken thin. It grills in under ten minutes. Consider spreading the bread with a little thousand island dressing, too!

Wow! Soooo yummy!!! I've been on a winning streak lately. Most every recipe I've tried has been fantastic - and I'm adding this one to the list. It is a rare occasion that my hubs & I agree on a dish (we have completely different tastes). We both LOOOOVED these! I first stumbled upon this recipe in my TOH Light & Tasty (now Healthy Cooking) cookbook. The fact that I can eat this w/o feeling "guilty" is a HUGE plus. :) As Amber suggested, I grilled 3 breasts but used all of the spice called for. I think I'd have to double it if I were making all 6 servings (this was perfect as is). I used my handy C&B reversible gridle, but a George Forman grill would work great too. Having said this, I do believe you need to grill these. It adds flavor (grill marks... yum!) and enhances the overall appearance, IMHO. One more thing to note: Although many have topped their sandwiches w/ a cajun spread, I really think a simple alternative like mayo works best. You don't want your condiments to "compete" with the spicy chicken. Also, I thought the spice blend would be salty, but it really wasn't. PLEASE resist the temptation to modify or skip it alltogether. Try this once as is - I promise, you will NOT be disappointed! Served on onion rolls (which I brushed w/ garlic butter & then grilled for a min. or so to "toast") w/ a slathering of lite mayo, lettuce & tomato. Fries were the perfect complement to our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Ms. Peterson! :-)

Loved this recipe!  Perfect for summer because I can do the prep work ahead of time and just throw them on the grill right before we are ready to eat, and I never have to heat up the house with the stove or oven!  Very tasty and moist!  I will be making this chicken recipe for a variety of uses!

Easy recipe, good flavor.  I put a little more seasoning than called for, since I like spicy/strong flavors.  Would cook again

The recipe was very simple and easy. It had an OK taste. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5. I may try it one more time and multiply it by 4 or 5. I am eating the sandwich right now. With every bite... I like the flavor more and more. I just wish there was much more of it.   All in all its a good recipe. If you find yourself able to eat jalapenos and not consider them very spicy... then you may need to double, triple,.....ect this recipe.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any lemon-pepper seasoning, so I made some of my own, and I also used sesame seed buns instead of kaiser rolls. The chicken was sooo good! I was afraid it was going to be a little too spicy, but it was PERFECT and tasted great with the tomato! I actually had some dipping sauce from another recipe on Allrecipes (Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce by Jackie Smith), that I put on the sandwich, and it was a great complement to the chicken!

We could barely make the seasoning mixture coat one chicken breast, let alone two. We doubled the spice mixture to completely coat two flattened chicken breasts. I would also reduce the celery salt to 1/4 teaspoon and substitute garlic powder for garlic salt. Otherwise the chicken is too salty.

Very good and simple!  Just added light mayo and took out the tomato since I don't like them.  Made it on the foreman.  Will make again.

This was pretty good. Next time I will make sure to pound the chicken very thin or use breast tenders, and will let the rub sit for longer. I let it sit for 3-4 hours tonight, but I would probably let it sit overnight next time. I spread the rolls with Secret Burger Sauce from this site, and served with Onion Soup Potatoes. Good meal, overall, and I will make this again.

I thought it was pretty good. I added a little splash of Worcestershire sauce. I also omitted the cayenne pepper but added mild jalapeno Tabasco sauce. I cooked it on the stove in skillet and it turned out very juicy and tasty. My husband loved it!

the chicken is great, pretty basic, but great none the less. I threw it on the grill, and saved the leftovers to throw on a salad later in the week! Thanks so much!

These were good-better as a sandwich than as a plain cajun chicken.  BUT, I had to double the seasoning to lightly coat both sides of the chicken and it still wasn't all that flavorful and definitely not hot.  I'd try another Cajun chicken recipe before this one, but it was still good-just not great.

Take the extra time to grill these and you won't regret it. Make sure you're not using expired spices and you will have a delicious and spicy meal! I suggest using ciabatta bread and some pesto, and substituting the lettuce with spinach.

This was really good--just like a restaurant sandwich.  I only used four small chicken breasts and let them marinate overnight and the flavor was just right.  I served it with mayo, lettuce, & tomato!

I did like the taste of the chicken. I had it in a sandwich with pepper jack cheese and that almost took away from the flavor. I think next time I will try these in a wrap with either chedder or montery jack cheese. I also need to find a "spread" for them that will not take away from the chicken. I will try again and experiement with different things - thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  This has become a staple in our house.  I only use 4 chicken breasts halves and double the spices.  Add dill pickle slices and mayo to the sandwich.

Absolutely amazing recipe! As for toppings, I suggest thickly sliced fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and Thousand Island dressing. (My family actually started putting blocks of tomato and a dollop of T.I. dressing on a piece of lettuce before wrapping some chicken in it and eating it like a taco - delicious!)

I quadrupled this recipe and marinated split chicken breasts in it, then basted the breasts while cooking them on the grill.  Great flavor.  I'll definitely use this as my cajun seasoning recipe.  Not too spicy, not too salty.

This is my favorite chicken marinade.   I use it in Chicken Burritos, Fajitas, salads and of course sandwiches.   I usually quadruple the recipe as I like to taste the kick!

Very good and very easy!  I used a whole breast with rib meat and got two sandwiches out of it.  I buttered the sandwich buns and put them on the grill with the chicken for the last 5 minutes of cooking.

These were so very tasty!  I did not measure my seasonings, I just sprinkled them on!  I added more cayenne pepper because we like our foods spicy and I also added some cajun salt as well. 
This was served with rich mexican corn as our side dish(also from this site).

This chicken sandwich is delicious! I highly recommend it and didn't change a thing about it. If the weather won't let you use the grill, try it on a foreman grill, turns out perfect every time and soo juicy!

I made these for a football party and everyone loved them.  Very good and not too spicy.  I kept this recipe and will make them again.  They are so easy!

Loved this recipe! I did some guesswork as I added the spices and possibly added a bit more than called for but my boyfriend and I devoured our sandwiches. This is a great recipe when you're trying to do something different than the same old grilled chicken. Definitely a keeper!

I just put the spices in a bad, shoot them, and tossed the oiled chicken in to season.  Turned out great!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. We only used two chicken breasts instead of how many it calls for but the seasoning was just right. We thought it needed a dressing so we mixed mayo with some italian herbs seasoning paste and it worked perfect. Definitely will cook again.

These sandwiches were great! I made them for my husband and I and he told me to be sure to include them in the dinner rotation!
