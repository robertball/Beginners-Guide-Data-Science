The first bite of the chicken at the narrow end of the breast had me thinking the marinade was a bit overbearing, but I admit I tend to be a non-marinade guy.  However, as I took a couple more bites I was treated to a wonderfully moist chicken breast where the subtle sweetness of the marinade complemented the chicken perfectly.  I will definitely make this again but I’ll make sure the chicken breasts are reasonably medium-thick so the marinade does not overpower the taste of the chicken.

Very nice. I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked the chicken in the sauce instead of grilling it. Everyone loved it!

Respectably good marinade.  All the ingredients played quite well together. The honey could barely be tasted, and didn't contribute much sweetness, but helped to carmelize the outside. In fact, nothing really stood out above the other components. We didn't discern the Dijon mustard or the garlic, either. Not that this is bad, mind you. I marinated a portobello mushroom cap and tomato slices, grilling them along with the chicken, and this sauce was compatible with those items, as well. The chicken was very juicy, but I attribute that more to the manner of cooking than to a virtue of this particular recipe. Very good. Not exactly rock-your-world-can't-wait-to-have-it-again-five-stars good, but I could see myself possibly making it sometime in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used stone ground mustard and marinated for 24 hours. We grilled for 8 minutes on one side and 7 on the other. These were the most tender, juicy and flavorful chicken breasts that I've ever eaten in my life. They nearly melted in my mouth. I should have taken a photo, but they were eaten too fast to get one. Make this chicken, you won't be sorry!

Delicious!  I used olive oil instead of canola. Also baked it in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. Wonderful lemon flavor and very moist.

This is a great recipe. I've made it a few times, and found I prefer to cut the Italian seasoning in half, and skip the salt. The chicken breasts I buy are usually already injected with a salt brine, so no need to add more. It's funny to see all the reviews attributing moist chicken to the marinade....raw chicken is moist, even without a marinade. It is overcooking that results in dry chicken. So, use this marinade for a nice, lemony chicken, and make sure not to overcook it if you want it moist :)

Love it! Easy and it uses things you have on hand in the  house. I subbed maple syrup for honey because I didn't have any honey but it was still awesome. Made the chicken moist and gave it a great tangy taste. My hubby even at it the next day and he usually hates leftovers. I'll be making this again, thanks.

So good!! I made the marinade and baked it in the oven. This was some of the most delicious, tender chicken ever! I’ll definitely be adding this recipe to my regular rotation.

We multiplied this recipe by 10 for a dinner we held for our daughter's college swim team (40 of them). Despite the fact that there was also smoked pork tenderloin and pasta with homemade sauce, they devoured every single piece of the chicken. For convenience, we made double batches of marinade, added the chicken as directed and froze the filled bags flat on a cookie sheet. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Made exactly per recipe (except baked instead of grilling) and it was very good.  The Italian seasoning was a little overpowering for my taste, though.

I thought this was a very good chicken marinade although the honey is not prominant at all, the lemon really shines through in this one. I did use olive oil and cut the salt way back, other than that, love the fresh lemon zest and fresh garlic. Thanks!

This is a great marinade.  The only  changes I made were to increase the garlic, and I broiled the chicken in my oven (we don't have a grill).

It also works for pork in the same proportions.  I've also used it with a couple of limes  in place of the lemon, which also works well.  Thanks for posting!

Family of 6 LOVED it.  They even fought over the last  piece.  NOTE:  I peeled one lemon and slivered the peel.  Added to the marinade, it was a powerful punch of lemon.  YUM!

Really easy marinade and my family loved it. We are big fans of the Rosemary Ranch Chicken on this site - this marinade had as much flavor but was much easier to prepare. Will definitely be adding it to the "rotation."

Made it with a some"mods". Was out of Worcestershire so subbed a low sodium chicken stock. Used only a 1/2 tsp of salt and doubled the honey. The chicken was super moist and my man loved this dish!!

Great recipe. I put everything but the lemon juice and zest in a Ziploc bag and marinated the chicken breasts overnight. A couple hours before cooking, I added the juice and zest. In addition to the honey, also added 1 tbsp. maple syrup also. 
Not outdoor BBQ season so I cooked it in oven at 350 for 1 hour. Served over basmati rice which soaked up the sauce. served with grilled asparagus, was a great meal. Thanks for recipe!

The honey flavor is obscured by the strong citrus presence and additional flavorings, but is still a good marinade.

delicious! A great way to mix up just plain old chicken! I even cooked it on the grill and it was extra delicious. I did cook it on a copper grill pan outside, but it was the best chicken we have ever made!

This was absolutely amazing!  I served with roasted potatoes and broccoli.  Saved some marinade which I made into a sauce for the veggies.  So good,  I will make this for company.

My new favorite chicken marinade!! Too cold out to grill, so I threw it in the stove top to char it a bit. Very flavorful! Will definitely be making this again! (Used boneless skinless tenderloins instead of the breasts and paired it with a very simply roasted butternut squash recipe also on this app

Took a chance on this marinade and wasn't disappointed. Followed recipe exactly except I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice instead and I only marinaded the chicken for an hour because we were short on time. Still had a lot of favor and the kids liked it. We will be keeping this one.

Very tasty.  Super simple.  I even used reconstituted lemon juice I had in a bottle in my frig to save from having to go to the store.

This recipe is delicious.  I made it exactly per the instructions, marinating at the minimum two hour mark.  The flavors melded perfectly and the chicken was moist, tender and flavorful.  It received rave reviews at dinner last night.  Thanks for sharing, Autumn Pumpkin!

Very easy, husband loved it. I added only a splash of oil and cooked the chicken in the marinade in a skillet. I didn't have italian seasoning so I used  a mix of oregano, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. It turned out really well. I served it with rice and a salad.

I tried this recipe a while ago and then lost it. I've been trying to find it for months since, it was definitely worth it! This was some of the best chicken I've ever had! I love marinades, so, I did tweak it a little to taste and it was Sooo moist! I liked the flavor so much, I swapped in olive oil and used it as a salad dressing. So glad I found the recipe again!

This has so much flavor and with all the ingredients I had around the house. I didn't have a lemon, so I used two tablespoons of bottled lemon juice. I didn't like all that salt so I cut it back to a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and also only 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. It worked great on the chicken I cooked on an indoor grill.

Omg. This is so good! I don’t typically like white meat chicken because I find it dry but this is seriously the best chicken I’ve ever had! Like restaurant quality delicious. I made sure to use thick chicken breasts. We grilled it and then cut them in half to make thin cut breasts and then finished cooking them on the stove top so they wouldn’t burn. Will probably start making this on a regular basis. Paired with mashed potatoes and garlic honey broccoli. Yummy!!

I loved this recipe. The chicken breast’s taste is really nice. I also used olive oil instead of canola oil, and I baked the chicken with the marinade as some people suggested. It was a good recipe, and I will insha’Allah do it again.

Extremely easy to make and a recipe that you tend to have all ingredients on hand.  Mixed up the marinade quickly before work this morning, pulled the chicken from the freezer, let it marinate all day.  We ended up baking in the oven for about 45 minutes, but it was deliciously moist and tasty.  Will definitely make again

Since this was the first time I've made this recipe, I followed it closely.  It turned out beautifully.  The chicken was very moist with a great set of flavours.  It went very well with the suggested grilled potatoes and coleslaw.  We also had some fresh asparagus with lemon and parmesan!  Yum!!

This was the juiciest chicken we've made on the grill. So flavorful! I made a few changes, instead of canola oil I used Avocado oil, regular mustard and instead of Lemon I used Lime. DELISH! The boyfriend loved it.. we will definitely make this again.

Quick and easy on the grill.  Good balanced flavor and the left overs were very good to.  We're big on leftovers at home.  With very busy schedules we like to cook once and have several meals.

This is absolutely the best chicken marinade I've ever tasted!  I don't like Dijon mustard by itself and really didn't expect to like this marinade but it was FANTASTIC!!  The lemon juice and zest tempered the mustard perfectly.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I scored the chicken breasts about 1/4 inch deep to allow the marinade to better penetrate the meat.  This is a keeper!!!

Very good, marinated for 24 hours and grilled on stove top. Stayed moist and tender. Thought it could have used a bit more flavor but will play with seasoning next time. My 19 year old son said it was the best grilled chicken hes ever had and requested I make it every week!!! now that's saying something!!!

This was a very simple recipe. I made it in the oven for ease as the others said it came out well. My husband and I agreed that the lemon flavor conflicted with the Italian seasoning. The dish was ok but not fantastic. Prob won’t make it again.

First of all I used thighs instead of breasts because thighs have more flavor and because I didn't have and dijon mustard, I used regular mustard and some white vermouth. 
This was such a big hit.....I served it with coleslaw and corn on the cob.

I marinated in all ingredients but wrapped in foil and cooked in my air fryer for 17 minutes at 350 degrees (3 breasts) - easy, moist and delicious!

I got the ingredients together and my husband mixed up the marinade while I was out.  After careful grilling we enjoyed restaurant-quality really moist, flavorful chicken breasts! It was easy to make, and absolutely delicious. We followed the recipe exactly. We will be making this again. I’d even serve it to guests.

First, drives me crazy when people don't use weights for raw meat. It's on the package for crying out loud, and the size of chicken breasts can vary widely. I had 14 oz of chicken tenders and halved the recipe. A half recipe could have taken care of a full pound as well.That out of the way, I really liked this marinade. Once cooked, I could taste the lemon, the sweetness from the agave syrup (pours easier than honey) and the savory from the Worcestershire sauce. I tasted it as I was making it, and there was a nice flavor already before I added the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, so I further reduced those. Will definitely make again.

This is a great summer dish.  I cut way back on the salt and let the chicken marinate all day for a light citrus flavor in every bite.  Will be making this recipe again.

Really good—packed with flavor.  I halved the Italian seasoning as one reviewer suggested, but that was the only change I made.  Oh, and since I don’t have a grill, I baked it at 425 for about 20-25 minutes per another review.  Moist, tender, delicious—and easy.  Thank you!

I had planned to make this earlier in the week, and it ended up marinating for about a day and a half. As someone else said, none of the flavors really stood out. It was moist and tasty, but I was looking for a little more flavor.

The zest is crucial IMO. I'll also probably drizzle  some honey on the chicken halfway through cooking to create a glaze.

Oh my goodness! My husband love this chicken. I didn't have a lemon, but I had lemon juice so I used 1 TBSP lemon juice in its place. I also used 1/4 cup + 1 Tbsp Evoo in place of the canola oil, addede 1 oz White Balsamic Vinegar, 1 oz water, used 3 large cloves of garlic, smashed and chopped and changed the seasoning to 1/4 tsp EACH: Dried Basil, Dried Oregano, Italian Herb Seasoning and black pepper. I did keep the 1 TBSP Each of Honey and Dijon Mustard, and 2 tsp worcestershire sauce. In place of the amount of salt in the recipe I used 1/4 tsp salt and 1-1/4 tsp Nu-Salt (salt substitute with potassium). I actually marinated chicken legs. I used 2/3 of the marinade in the zipper closed bag (in frig for 3 hours) and put the legs on the Indoor Grill, turning and basting with the remaining marinade until they got a good char (not burnt!). Then I transferred them to a shallow baking pan and roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees F. for 35 minutes (till cooked though). Yes, it meant turning on the oven, but for me it was a better alternative to going out in the heat, humidity and insects.

Didn’t have a fresh lemon so I used lemon juice. I followed everything else in the recipe  except I cut the beasts in half for better coverage and even cooking.   Possibly because of the lack of lemon zest the flavor was slightly lacking contrast.  It was certainly “good enough” and I will keep it on my list to try again with fresh lemon.

I will make it again.  It has a good flavor using ingredients as listed in your recipe.  I seem to dry out chicken breasts on the grill but marinating them, turned out to be five hours, helped keep them more moist.

Did make a few changes from original recipe as I  used dried rosemary instead of Italian herb ( don't care for it) and cut back on salt by half and pepper by 1/4 and used two tablespoons of honey, marinated overnight. It grilled beautifully and was moist. I'll make it rest of the summer. Really delicious. I don't think the small changes I made would completely change the taste from the original recipe as the lemon juice and zest  is what  really makes it. Therefore a 5-star rating is due.

The recipe was great, but the chicken breasts I had were huge and ended up taking 11 minutes to cook on each side (Although I also live  4,000 feet above sea level).  My suggestion if you have chicken breasts thicker than 3 inches is to flatten them a bit prior to seasoning and cooking.  Otherwise, very tasty!

Loved this!  I made the marinade the night before then marinaded the chicken for about 4 hours before grilling. I will defiantly make this again.

I used lime vs lemon on legs vs breasts and it was terrific.  Great recipe. Everyone in my family loved it including my 2 picky kiddos.  Defiantly will make this easy to make dish again.

Loved it.  I added some red pepper flakes for a little spice.  Sweet, salty and spicy.

I omitted the Worcestershire sauce because I had none and not a fan.  Used skinless chicken thighs and whole grain Dijon and remaining ingredients as written.  I grilled after 5 hours of marinating - quite delicious!  They literally were done after 5 min. on high heat.  I felt a little more salt was needed after cooking since I omitted the salty Worcestershire sauce.

This was just OK to us. Flavors were fine, but very subtle. Probably won't use this again.

I didn't have any Italian herb mix so I just used oregano and basil and it was perfect.  It is a great marinade, even the kids were happy!

My Husband grilled the chicken per the recipe - yummy in my tummy! Such a fantastically fresh tasting chicken.  My husband searched on grilled chicken and picked this recipe - he said the recipe just sounded really good.  He used olive oil instead of canola - otherwise, nothing was changed - no need, our meal was delicious.  We had it with white rice, and steamed vegetables.  Def a do-over.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Tried this marinade tonight and it was delicious! Used olive oil instead of canola. I felt it was a little salty; next time I will try with either less salt or sans salt. Flattened the breasts with a mallet before grilling. 5 minutes each side on low heat on a gas grill. The chicken was superb -- succulent! This immediately became one of our favorite marinades. Thank you for sharing!
