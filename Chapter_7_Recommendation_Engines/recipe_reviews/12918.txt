I made this in the crockpot and it turned out well.  I took the suggestions of others;  it tasted really good and my husband really liked it- and he is really picky about how food tastes.  I cooked the turkey sausage and onions in a pan then put them in the crock pot; I added the following: garlic, cannellini beans, petite diced tomatoes, sweet turkey sausage (I would use spicy instead of sweet next time),fresh grated parmesan cheese which I added at the beginning of cooking and some when I served it.  I think it would have tasted just as good without the half and half or evaporated milk.  Also be sure to put the spinach in in the last half hour-I put mine in with the rest of the ingredients and the spinach was a little mushy.

This was okay.  I pretty much followed the recipe and I felt like it was missing something.  Next time, I WILL use spicy sausage and add white beans.  I think it would also benefit from some fresh basil and parsley.  It smelled wonderful, and I served it with a caesar salad and garlic rolls.  Oh, by the way, since sausage links are sold mostly in packages of 5, just throw them all in and use 8 cups of broth instead of 6.  It works.

This soup made a great meal.  To make it lower in fat, I used turkey sausage and 98% fat free chicken broth.  I also used frozen chopped spinach.  Delicious!

Couple tips:  No need to fry the sausage meat in a frying pan first.  Saute it in a stock pot (Le Creuset dutch oven pots work great for this dish) and then add the rest of the ingredients in the same pot.  Also, I don't use any milk or cream and it makes a ice "brothy" soup.   

I have made this many times and it always comes out great.  You can vary the amount of any of the ingredients to your taste and it still tastes terrific.  For a change of pace, substitute 2 cups of cooked rice into the soup instead of the potatoes.  I like to use a mix of white and wild rice when I do this, but any rice would work well.  Thanks for a great-tasting, quick, and easy recipe!!!

I love this soup, I used to have to go to Olive Garden every time I wanted this soup, now I make it at home all of the time.  Sometimes I use kale instead of spinach, and I usually add some Oscar Meyer bacon bits.  Also, I use spicy turkey italian sausage.

Very tasty soup- a nice variation from the types of soup I usually make.  Based on other reviewers suggestions, I used spicy turkey sausage instead of pork to save on calories and fat.  I personally didn't feel it affected the taste at all, but my husband would have liked to try it with the "real sausage".  I drained my sausage well after browning.  I added some minced garlic in when I browned the sausage.  I took the sausage/garlic and put it in my crockpot along with a package of Simply Potatoes diced potatoes with onions, the broth and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  After it cooked for a few hours on high, I added in a can of drained cannellini beans and a package of baby spinach.   I let that cook for another hour or so and then added in half and half instead of the evaporated milk just before serving.  I think I will let the potatoes cook a little longer in the crockpot next time.  They were not quite as tender as I would prefer, but overall, I was very impressed with this dish.  I am planning to take it to a soup and salad social that I am attending next week!

My family -- extended family included -- absolutely loves this recipe. Starting with this recipe I was able to convince my wife that spinach, when prepared well, can be quite exquisite. My father continues to dislike spinach; but he craves this recipe...so I always have to make large batches to share with my mother and father.   It freezes very well, by the way. The original recipes calls for odd measurements such as "three Italian sausages" and "1/4 cup of evaporated milk." Sausages aren't normally sold in thrice, and what do you do with the other portion of the evaporated milk can once you've measured out the measly 1/4 cup? Therefore, it helps to bump-up the serving size to fit the number of sausages commonly sold in a package (5 or 7, depending); I've also noticed that it only enriches the taste of the soup if you use a whole can of evaporated milk, too.  All in all, a fantastic recipe to use again and again.

This soup was easy and delicious. Based on other Italian style soups I have made, I felt compelled to add the rind of a piece of aged parmesan cheese during cooking which enhanced the flavor of the broth, then served the soup with addition freshly grated parmesan. It was great.

Wow. Wow. Wow. What an easy recipe with such a sophistacted taste! My husband and I loved this. Cannot wait to make it for company. I also think it would be a terrific fall or cold weather dish. Used mild Italian sausage and five pieces total. Had two cans of chicken broth (reduced sodium) so I just added a can of water and two bouillon cubes. Can't wait to see what this is going to taste like tomorrow.

My husband likes large dinner meals in which soup is just a course. I served this with a salad and it was very satisfying.  Between every mouthful, my husband stopped to tell me how wonderful this was. I didn't have hot sausage so I added crushed red pepper and it was delicious!

I was afraid that it would be tasteless with so few spices, but the spicy sausage is all the flavor you need. I took a few review tips: added one rained can of petite diced tomatoes, one drained can of canellini beans, and a minced garlic clove with the onion. Next time I will try it with pasta....
UPDATE: I tried the pasta, SOOOO much better. Once you put the broth in, bring it to a boil, add a good soup noodle, I like the Barilla Pippettes, about 2 minutes before the pasta is al dente, add the tomatoes and beans. Continue with the recipe...

This soup is awesome with some additions: I added cannellini beans, sliced red potatoes, about 6 cloves of garlic(with the onion and the sausage), and some thyme, oregano and fresh parsley. I used homemade stock so I added salt and pepper to taste. I cooked the hot sausage in the same dutch oven and de-glazed the pan with a little white wine. Then add the potatoes and cover with chicken stock( about 7 cups) and bring to a boil, simmer until potatoes are tender.  Add cream( about 1/2 cup), to taste depending how creamy you want it, and then I added the beans and spinach. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. I garnished with grated parm. We had this delicious soup with garlic herb bread. YUMMY!!! I will make this again.

This has become one of our favorites.  I often add one large carrot sliced very thin, for a bit of additional color.

I did not have Italian sausage on hand (hubby doesn't eat pork) so I used a recipe on the site to make my own using ground turkey: Homemade ItalianTurkey Sausage. Let me tell you this soup was fantastic and had a wonderful flavor profile. I am so glad AR had it as Recipe of the Day the other week. It will go into my meal rotation for sure.

Okay, I did go against my norm and made a couple adjustments, but there's no doubt that this is a 5-star recipe as is. I Cooked the onion most of the way, then added a full pound of bulk hot Italian sausage (I *am* a carnivore!). I used homemade low-sodium chicken broth because the meat has enough salt in it. My grocery store does not sell spinach in bunches, so I used 1/2 pound and that seemed just right. I did have to add 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt and added 1/4 teaspoon of course-ground black pepper. I goofed and served it before adding the evaporated milk, but added some to my second serving. Both were excellent, but I think I like it without the milk even better.

AWESOME! I took some of the other suggestions and added 2 cups of beef broth to the 6 cups chicken broth; also added 1 can of cannelini beans, extra spinach and crushed red pepper flakes. Served it to friends who said it was the best soup they'd ever eaten.

I have made a similar version to this recipe so I know it's good. I do use Kale instead of spinach although I have tried both. I prefer the kale, for some reason it adds a heartiness and fullness to it.

This soup is excellent, and so simple! 

I use frozen spinach and regular milk, and it's still very, very good. Oh! And a shake or two of Parmesan cheese in each individual bowl is a must! Really makes it delicious.

My goodness this was good.  My boyfriend and brother absolutely loved he heartiness and spicy/heat this soup provided.  I used 4 links of chorizo and a dash of crushed red pepper and it was delicious.  Served with a salad, parmesan herb bread and a glass of wine - it was an excellent meal!

Excellent!  I made it this afternoon for lunch.  My husband, daughter & I loved it.  I added garlic & a can of petite diced tomatoes.  I used mild sausage because I have a young 5 year old daughter who is not into spicy food.  She asked for a second helping!

This recipe was super easy and my husband loved it. I subbed soy chirzo, veggie broth and rice for the potatoes (my husband doesn't like potatoes...who doesnt like potatoes?), it turned out really good. Filling.

Delicious! I thought the spicy sausage might be too much for my kids but they all enjoyed it. I added garlic, diced italian tomatoes and beans as many other reviewers suggested. I served with a crisp salad and garlic bread sticks. Thanks for a great recipe!

Ever try "Zuppa Toscana" at The Olive Garden Restaurant? Delicious. This is a very close version. I like to use Kale instead of spinach, and add approx 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and top the bowls with a little shredded parmesan. I like Dianne's use of evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream I normally use. I will try that the next time I make this.
By the way, if you're making this for the first time, be sure to drain the sausage WELL. (or you'll find alot of orange-colored grease floating at the top of your bowl)

Yummy!  I was looking for a soup with sausage in it after seeing Rachel Ray make a lentil and sausage soup.  So I was very excited when I found this in my inbox today!  One of my goals for this year is to experiment more in the kitchen, and so I did!  I skipped on the evaporated milk (may add next time).  I added fresh garlic, white beans, red pepper flakes.  I have no luck cooking potatoes and saw that someone used rice, but thought, "Mmmmm... pasta," and used that instead.  Had it ready when my boyfriend got home from work and he scarfed down TWO bowls!  We greatly enjoyed it... the only change is that next time we'll have a nice crusty bread along with it.  Thanks!

This is a wonderful hearty winter soup.  I used spicy sausage and half-and-half and added white kidney beans and a pinch of thyme.

This recipe is wonderful. I live in the UK and am unable to get American style Italians sausage, so I made it from scratch, but that was the only drawback to this recipe. The whole family enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again.

Wow, I was not expecting this to taste as close to the Olive Garden's as it did. I used kale instead of spinach, and heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. Instead of pork sausage, I used some turkey sausage, and it is amazing!

Soup was pretty good I didn't chop the spinach and even though I used baby spinach the pieces were still to large.  I would have giving this a 3.5 if I could have, and be sure to use half and half in place of the evaporated milk.

This was really good. Smelled delicious throughout the house.Because we like spicy I purchase the hot sausage and also added some red pepper flakes as suggested by others. I used all chicken broth rather than water for added flavor. The one thing that I have will do next time is I will remove all of the stalks from the Kale. I had never cooked with Kale before and mistakenly assumed that they would soften up after cooking. Oops. It was still delicous and I look forward to eating the left overs.

Instead of the spinach, I used kale (but did not even come close to needing the 3/4 lb the recipe suggests. I think 1/3 to 1/2 lb kale would be fine.)
And I also substituted Honeysuckle White's mild turkey sausage and a dash of cayanne pepper to make up for the lack of spice. Overall, the recipe came out great, but it needed a little adaptation for the mass of the kale.
Definetly could give the Zuppa Tuscana soup a run for it's money!

**Since Honeysuckle doesn't make that sausage anymore, I use their brats and remove the casings, then brown and crumble the meat. Everyone has been asking for this recipe, it's quite a dish!**

This is fantastic soup! Whole family loved it, even spinach haters! I would suggest rinsing the sausage though as I had a half inch build-up of oil on the top.

**Update** This has become a staple in my house...especially during the winter season. I found out what was causing my oil problem, it was the chicken broth (college Inn), I have switched to Swanson 99% fat free and I have no oil build up and it tastes better...I just drain the sausage-don't rinse. I also substitute sweet italian sausage (more flavor) and I use heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. This version is to die for! Spicy was good but couldn't enjoy it being that hot! Thanks again for the recipe, I just made a pot and am getting ready to enjoy!

This is great! Pretty much made it as suggested, tho I played with the amounts of stuff...i.e. four turkey sausages, one small onion, entire frozen package (one of the boxy ones) of whole leaf spinach, four red potatoes unpeeled...i also added one grated clove of garlic when the onions were cooking with the sausage...delicious!!

Very good. I added some canneli beans to give it more substance. I also didn't want to open a whole can of evaporated milk to just use 1/4 cup, so I used half and half instead. Thickened it up with a bit of flour (I like a thick soup). Topped with fresh parmesan cheese. Yummy!!!

This soup is amazing! I did make just a few adjustments after trying the original recipe first. I added 5 links of sausage along with 2 onions and 3 cloves of minced garlic, followed by 5 potatoes and 1 can of great northern beans rinsed and drained, extra broth, finally I subbed kale for the spinach and added the entire can of evaporated milk. To die for delish!!!

This soup was good, quick and easy (used my new Vidalia Chopper, buy one it’s great). Always starts soups with onion, celery, carrot and garlic; sweated them and then threw in the sausage to brown (in my stockpot, why dirty another pan?).  Drained a bit of the grease off and then proceeded with the recipe.  I didn’t have any fresh spinach so I used frozen (10oz) and added a little onion and garlic powder. Tasted the soup and decided to forgo the milk -I didn’t think it needed it.  Would make again - could also use tortellini in place of potatoes if you like.

I altered this to be a vegetarian soup. A bit of a stretch, maybe, but it was awesome and a hit with friends (including one meatlover.)
Substitute vegetable broth (I used a mix of vegetable broth and vegetable bouillon substitute) and zesty italian vegetarian brats. Added some crushed red pepper for spice. Lovely! I need to make more.

Easy and hearty.  I took advice from others and sauteed my sausage and onions first and added minced garlic and red pepper flakes.  I also added one can of diced tomatoes.  Threw the above in the crockpot and came home to a hearty soup.  1/2 hour before serving I added the Spinach and the evaporated milk.   Very very very easy and a wonderful flavor.  I'll definitely make this again.

Just to mix it up my second time making this soup I used andouille sausage and collard greens instead of the spinach This soup is still great! I used ground turkey in addition to the sausage and used fat free evaporated milk.

Mild Italian Sausage was on sale at the butcher counter, so I bought it and added extra red pepper flakes in the cooking. Made no other changes. This was truly WONDERFUL! Made this for the first cold evening of the fall season and it was PERFECT! Definately making the regular rotation!

This recipe is fantastic! My husband came home for lunch the next day just so that he could have the leftovers. Even my six-year-old loved this soup. I used a little whipping cream instead of the evaporated milk, but it turned out great.

So not on my South Beach Diet, but worth every bite.  I'd par boiled chicken the day before for grilling with fresh basil, rosemary, oregano and bay leaves, then used the broth for mustard greens from the garden.  The next day I had a ton of broth and some greens left, so searched for a recipe.  I am not kidding, this stuff is to die for.  Since I already had mustard greens in the mix, I only added part of the spinach.  This recipe will be coming around again.  I'm thinking crock pot while camping would be awesome.

As written, very tasty.  To make it five stars in my opinion, add a little garlic and parm.  Also, I prefer kale, but the spinach is very good, too.  You can definitely sub cream, half and half or milk for the evaporated milk.  And do skim off the sausage fat, as another member suggested it doesn't do anything for flavor at all and just makes the soup look really oily. I cook my sausage at the bottom of the dutch oven in which I plan on cooking the soup - time saver and one less pan to clean.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Really good soup.  Like some of the others I added cannellini beans and used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than open a can of evaporated milk.  I just finished eating a bowl of it with parmesan cheese on top.  I feel very contented right now.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was DELICIOUS! It tastes identical to the zuppa toscana that's at Olive Garden. I followed the recipe except for using half and half in place of evaporated milk. I also added some fresh grated parmesan to the soup as it was cooking as well as on top before eating. Pair it with parmesan french bread and it is an amazing and satisfying meal!

Made this for dinner the other night and both my boyfriend and I loved it! I highly recommend draining the italian sausages and pan of the oil/fat as it ruins the look of the soup and does not contribute to the flavor of the dish. Very good soup, indeed!

Fantastic.  I never change a thing the first time I make something because then if it isn't good, you don't know if it's the original recipe or what you did to it. This was excellent.  A big hit!!!

This was very good. I didn't have spicy Italian sausage I only had mild so that is what I used. Also replaced the evaporated milk with half and half and added garlic. Thanks.

My family really enjoyed this quick, easy soup.  I doubled this recipe.  I used a combo of hot and mild sausages (a total of 6 links), and used the whole can of milk.  I will be making this again soon and I can see endless add ins! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the second time I have made this soup--it is scrumptious!  I used Honeysuckle Sweet Italian Sausage, added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some spice/heat, and I used Evaporated skim milk to reduce the fat.  A wonderful, fulfilling soup that goes together SO QUICKLY!

I love this recipe...it is easy, tastes great and makes phenominal leftovers. I change a few things though.  I put 4 cups of milk in instead of evaporated milk and I add sea shell noodles to make it a little more filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is definitely a five star recipe as written.  I normally don't change recipes, but after making the recipe quite a few times, I decided to play a little with it.  I use low sodium chicken broth, five links of hot sausage (since that's how many are in the package), red potatoes instead of white, a couple teaspoons of minced garlic (I'm a huge fan of garlic), and some hot sauce (probably a teaspoon or two), then follow the rest of the recipe.  We like things a little spicier and this is probably our favorite soup.  I can't wait until it gets a little cooler to make it again.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

After eating Tuscana soup from Olive Garden, I made it the following day.  I used a little more chicken broth because I prefer more liquid, I also used 1 can of canned evaporated milk, fresh sausage sweet and spicy about 1 3/4 lbs. total and I used kale instead of spinach.  What a hit.

Great starter recipe, but I made several changes.  First, I definitely recommend adding 2-3 cloves of garlic and sauteeing with the sausage (I used turkey sausauge and added quite a bit of red pepper flakes and cayenne - definitely like things spicy!) and chopped onion (although I substituted shallots).  I used the chicken broth as stated but also added 2 cups of beef broth to add more flavor.  When adding the potatoes, I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes with chopped green chilies and a can of cannellini beans.  And finally, I used skim milk thickened with a bit of flour and then topped the soup with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  This soup is definitely a meal on its own, especially when served with a nice crusty bread.  I used chiabatta rolls.

This is a delicious and inexpensive soup, two things I look for in a recipe.  I added extra broth and more potatoes to make a little more.  I only had regular sausage, so I added cayenne and Italian seasoning to make up for not having spicy Italian sausage.  Added garlic to taste.  I used about 3/4 of a 10 Oz package of frozen spinach, drained, in place of fresh, and subbed about a cup of milk for the evap.  Thanks!!

This is fabulous!  I even rinsed the sausage to cut down on the fat and it was still great!  I served this with Mama's Best Broiled Tomato Sandwiches (from this website) and it was a tasty pairing.  Has anyone out there tried to double this recipe and freeze half of it?

This soup is great!! I had stomach surgery last year so soup has become very important in my life.  Not just any soup but good hearty soup that is more like a meal. I had this soup at Olive Garden over the weekend and liked it so much I was on a quest to try and find a similar recipe.  This is it!!! and it was better than the restaurants.  I added a medium shallot along with the onions and 3 garlic cloves sliced thinly and frozen chopped spinach.  It was relatively quick and easy, but definitely worth the wait.  Will make this frequently.  Thanks from the bottom of my tummy!

I thought this was great but I did make some changes. I wanted a bigger pot so I used 9 cups of broth, 5 pieces of sausage and 12 oz of evaporated milk. Also I'm all about easy recipes because I have a toddler so instead of peeling and dicing potatoes I used 2 bags of Simply Potatoes. It turned out great and I served it in bread bowls. For my toddler I cooked up some pasta for her and added some of the soup and some shredded cheese, she loved it and the added pasta made it easy for her to eat off of a spoon without much mess. Next time I may add a can of petite diced tomatoes for color. 
All in all a great recipe that I'll be sure to make again.

Fabulous!  I love the Olive Garden version, and this is almost as good.  I used homemade stock, slightly more evaporated milk, thawed and drained frozen spinach, and half spicy/half mild sausage.  It was delicious.

This was just ok for us. I think the biggest thing it's missing is garlic. I realized that after I had a bowl and ended up throwing in a tablespoon of crushed garlic into the pot. Also the recipe I like the best for this kind of soup used kale instead of spinach. I liked that way better too. This one was worth eating, not bad, just not as good as I've made before.

It was fine, but it's the first time I've tried an Allrecipes with 4 1/2 stars that wasn't really good.  It was quite bland.  I even added mushrooms, beans, and zucchini, but the flavor just isn't deep at all.  Looking back at the photo I guess that's what it looks like but there aren't any spices added.  I thought the spicy sausage would give it depth, but it didn't.  I recommend that if you have to try this, add 1/2 and 1/2 at the end, instead of adding evap. milk, and add garlic and spices like thyme or basil or ?

5 stars because I made some changes.  3.5 stars if you make it like it suggests.  Add 1 can of drained garbanzo beans,basil and parsley to taste. I also put in garlic salt to taste. Probably 1 tsp of each spice or so. Delicious and nutritious!! Love it!

Loved this recipe! Did not have enough chicken broth so used a combo of chicken, beef and veggie broth, five sausage links and a five pound bag of potatoes I also used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. I did not care for the spinach(I love spinach cooked or raw) next time I will sub. and use kale and add some cooked and crumbled bacon when adding sausage.

I used a large plastic roll of spicy sausage and added a little cyanne pepper. It was delicious! My husband raved about it all through dinner.

excellent recipe.  i made some changes that might interest otheres, thought i'd list them.   instead of using straight chicken broth, i also used some beef stock.  in addition, i baked the sausage links in a shallow baking dish, then used some of the broth to get all the drippings from the pan into the soup.  after letting the sausage settle, i cut it lengthwise, then into 1/4in pieces, leaving the skin on.  i found it added more flavor to the soup, and more texture.  also, instead of using spinach, i used kale which i added at the last so as not to wilt it too badly.  i used heavy cream instead of evaporated, and just enough to turn the color.  and plenty of garlic!  hope this helps =)

Yum! Only change I made was to thin slice the potatoes instead of cubing and added a few teaspoons of red pepper flake. Tastes just like Olive Garden.

Very good.  So easy my husband was able to make it.  We used the spicy sausage and used the entire pack of 5.  Also added garlic to the recipe and doubled the broth.  We used about the entire can of evaporated milk, but I wanted it to be creamier...personal preferance there.

This soup is absolutely amazing.  My husband is really picky and he couldn't get enough. I made it with ground turkey instead of the sausage and added lots of spice and some red pepper.  So yummy! This will definitely be a recipe I make often.

We made about a recipe and a half. We didn't have enough chicken broth, so we added a cup of Chardonnay and one of water. Next time, I would leave out the water and substitute one cup of wine for a cup of chicken broth.

We've been eating a nice hearty soup and salad for dinner, and this soup was delish! I used turkey sausage as well, and next time I would probably use half and half just to give it a richer taste. I'll be making this one again!

This was good, but not incredible. All I could really taste was the Italian sausage, and it was really runny. My husband loved it. I think it could be great with a few adjustments.

This is way better than Olive Garden.  Didn't modify this recipe much.  I did add 1 cup of cream and used a mild italian sausage instead of spicy.  But then I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to kick the heat up a bit.  Really good recipe.

Oh My Lord!!! This is one of the best soups I have EVER had! The flavor is tremendous and the recipe is so unbelievably simple! Foolproof as well. I didn't have any spinach, so I added a good healthy dose of parsley for greenery. I also used low sodium chicken stock, sweet italian sausage, instant dry milk. I topped my steaming bowl with shredded jack and colby. It is so hearty I didn't need a single cracker. I just know that spinach would make this dish even more amazing....I'll be sure to remember to get some! I think the suggestion for adding diced tomatoes sounds great, and I'm certainly going to give it a whirl. A truly scrumptious soup, this has been added to my fall/winter menu!!! MAKE IT!!!

Update: I made a huge slow cooker full of this wonderful soup for our Halloween party. The pot was EMPTIED and got RAVE reviews. People could not get enough of this soup. My new fave for gatherings and parties!

Absolutely loved this soup!  Warm, spicy, filling, great fall comfort food.  I followed the recipe pretty closely with just a couple of tweaks.  I used spicy hot italian sausage and added 64 oz low sodium chicken broth, 5 medium yukon golds, and added some fine chopped carrot for added veg.  I added a 16 oz bag of frozen chopped spinach, white pepper, and a few shakes of garlic and onion powders.  Hubby raved!  Good food, thanks for sharing, Dianne.

This was excellent. My new favorite soup.  The only real change I made was additional evap. milk and kept simmering while waiting for everyone else to get a little thicker soup.  Because of that I added the spinach last to prevent it from cooking down too much. I used canned potatoes and it hid their canniness well. I also used hot sausage(chicken) as stated and don't think it would have been as good with mild. The spinach got a little extra cooked when reheating so if I make it to freeze I will leave that out and add it when reheating.  And next time I'm adding red peppers for color. YUM!

This was not bad, but seemed like it needed something else.  Possibly adding some tortellini or gnocchi would help, and I think the broth could have been thinkened up a little.  I doubled this and the only changes I made were: used mozz. and basil flavored chicken sausage, a whole can of evaporated milk, and about a tbsp of garlic powder.  I left out the salt completely.  I think with some tweeking this could be even better!

I am a soup-a-holic and this still gets 5 stars from me. I made it true to the recipe the first time and it was really good. The next 15 times I got creative and found that the best was when I substituted kale for the spinach (kale stays hearty no matter how long it is kept warm). I added corn, carrots, a dash of nutmeg and for even more heat - or if you use sweet Italian sausage – a shake or two of ground cayenne pepper. Served with a nice crusty baguette this is the perfect rainy day or cold night comfort food… Cheers for the recipe!

This might be my new favorite soup! I substituted turkey sausage and used fat free evaporated milk to make a lower fat version and it as AMAZING! My husband loved it and didn't believe me that it was "healthy." This will become one of our regular recipes!

I make this soup but also add some slices of pepperoni, canneloni beans, and bite sized pieces of a chicken breast. I use escarole instead spinach as I prefer its flavor. Usually will omit the milk as I prefer a more brothy style soup.

This soup is wonderful.  I laughed when my husband told me it was better than the soup at Olive Garden because a lot of reviews I read said that.  I served this with "Cheesy Garlic Bread" from this site.  The only changes I made with the recipe were to use frozen spinach and turkey sausage.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you!

This is the best soup ever!... I made mine with kale instead of spinach.  It cooks a little firmer. I used whole sausages, cooked in the oven and then sliced thin. I squeezed them between paper towels to blot off grease.  I added a little heavy cream the last 5 minutes along with the kale!  We loved it and will make often during cold months!  In the picture you can see I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing but however you do it, the combination is wonderful!  Enjoy!

The process can be shorted by getting the spicy italian sausage from Trader Joes, peeling the outer layer off,  chopping, and adding to the broth.

I used half hot and half sweet Italian sausage, it was a huge hit!!  Tastes just like the soup at Olive Garden.

Oh ... my ... goodness.  This was the reason we went to Olive Garden, now we have it at home.  The only think I eliminated was the salt.  Thank you Dianne.

Sorry to say I wasn't really a fan of this one.  The always-hungry husband didn't even want seconds.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, except I used 5 sausage links (whole package) instead of 3.  Now I wish I had read some more reviews and used their suggestions.
Honestly, I found it to be pretty tasteless, even with all the spices in the sausage.  If I were to make again (which I don't think I will), I would go with others' advice and add some cannelini beans, along with some chopped garlic, dried parsley, oregano, and basil, and perhaps even a can of Italian style stewed tomoatoes. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on top might be a nice touch.
I feel this soup has an identity crisis-- is it meant to be broth based or milk based??  The addition of the evaporated milk seemed unnecessary and only a contribution to the soup's overall bland flavor.  Also, the potatoes lended a mealy texture to the thin broth that was unpleasant.  I didn't rinse the sausage (thinking the grease would add more flavor), but I wish I had because the sausage grease separates from the milk and the broth in a very unappetizing manner.  I had hoped the soup would have more flavor when I re-heated it today for lunch, but nope.  
Sorry; I guess I have to be the maverick here and say this one is not a keeper.

Great soup recipe! To save time, I used 1 lb. of ground spicy Italian sausage and a 6 oz. bag of unchopped, baby spinach. I didn't peel the potatoes because the recipe didn't say to peel them. Since I used more sausage than the recipe called for, I used 4-14 oz. cans of chicken broth (reduced sodium). As many suggested, I added 3 crushed garlic cloves and red pepper flakes. I like creamy soup so I added 1 cup evaporated milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream and topped off each bowl of soup with parmesan cheese.

I followed the recipe and found it to look very unappealing. The taste was fair, but it looked thin and unappetizing. I felt compelled to pass this on.

Wonderful soup.  I used the Basic Chicken Stock recipe on this site and it was fabulous (using 2 or 3 Costco broiled chicken carcasses).  Followed others suggestions by adding a can of cannellini beans and added garlic with the onion.  Fabulous served with red pepper flakes and crusty french bread.  Oh, I also used the whole small can of evaporated milk.  A keeper for sure!

This was so great - we will definitely be making it again.  I browned the meat on the stove and 'half-baked' the potatoes in the microwave, then threw everything else (raw onion included) into the crock pot for a couple of hours.  It was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This really didn't do it for us. It was nothing spectacular at all. I wish I'd used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk - the milk added nothing to it. Also, it was WAY too salty (I used chicken bouillon granules). I must admit, I was pretty disappointed.

Delicious!  But next time I will use something a little firmer than spinach.  Maybe kale or something that will give it more texture.  Also, I will use real cream instead of evaporated milk.

I give 5 Stars to anything healthy that I can get my 12 year old stepson to eat! I used turkey sasuage, only 2 potatoes and one can of White Northern Beans (lots of fiber!) When he asked what the green stuff was, I told him "seasoning"; he then ate TWO helpings and then we told him it was spinach, and he said, "I knew it!" RIGHT!

There's not much I can say but.....WOW!  Excellent.  I will probably add some white beans next time for more body.  The taste is sooo good!  Even the kids loved it.  Used half-n-half instead of evaporated milk, as some previous reviewers had good results with it.

I didn't have evaporated milk, so I substituted 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream. I also added a can of Italian Kidney beans for added substance.

I made this in one pot. Easy and delicious. I increased the recipe to make six servings. I browned the sausage and onions together, added potatoes, broth, salt, pepper,  plus a can of canelli  beans, a can of petite diced tomatoes ..but I didn't add milk at all. I simmered it for about two hours and then added the spinach 15 minutes before we ate.

I have been making this recipe for years now and can't believe I have never reviewed it. Well, here goes. If you like Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana, you will LOVE this recipe! It tastes better. I do use spicy Italian sausage. If you only have mild sausage, just add red pepper flakes. Heat is a key factor in this recipe. I also add a 15 oz can of cannellini beans. Everyone that has tasted this soup raves about it. It's not difficult to make either. You will be amazed.

I did change the sausage to ground Italian mild

Delicious soup! I used a turkey fennel sausage and added cayenne for a bit of spice. Kale is a great substitution for the spinach and I added fresh Parmesan and basil as garnish.

So savory and delicious, flavors work so well together. I had a bunch leftover so i froze it and ate again on a later date. The spices were phenomenal both fresh and frozen! My husband and i are big soup eaters and this will be in my cooking book for years to come!

one of our family favorites, easy to make and very light and tasty.  We  use hot Italian sausage.  If you rinse off the fat, it has less calories but also less zip, cause you rinse off some spice.

I did slightly modify...
Ingredient modification: Tblspn  of olive oil, 1 cup chopped onion, carrot, and celery, ½ pound of uncooked spicy Italian sausage, ½ pound of uncooked mild Italian sausage, 1 bunch fresh Swiss Chard, 4 cups quartered small fingerling potatoes, ¼ cup of half & half, 1tbl chopped garlic, Salt and pepper to taste.  
Cooking Modification: I used my pressure cooker.  It has a browning cycle to brown onion, carrots & celery in olive oil for apx. 5-7 minutes. Add skinned, coarsely chopped Italian sausages and cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink. Stir in chopped chard and sauté till meat is browned and chard wilted.  Add 4 cups of potatoes and chicken broth. After adding the chicken stock, I pressure cooked the soup for fifteen minutes. I allow the soup to set for 10 minutes before releasing the pressure.  I then added my half & half salt, pepper and garlic and allowed soup to mellow for five minutes. Serve with Grated Parmesan or Reggiano cheese…enjoy!

This was delish! I made a few changes, first of all i used two shallots instead of the onion. i use one pound of hot turkey sausage patties, which is easier than deskinning the links. i used fresh heavy cream in place of the evap. milk, i added one clove of garlic wich i quartered, and i used one inch piece of the rind from saome peccorino romano cheese. my super picky fiance really loved this soup, in a house full of 7 people, everyone loved it.

I wanted a fusion between this soup and Italian Sausage soup so... I used 5 mild sausages, sauteed them with the onion and 4 cloves of chopped garlic in olive oil. Boiled 8 medium peeled/cubed redskin potatoes in 8c of chicken broth for 20min, added 1 1/2 cups of drained diced tomatoes and boiled for an additional 10min, then added my sausage/onion mixture and 1 package of frozen chopped spinach... brought this all to a boil then simmered for 20min. I omitted the evaporated milk and topped soup with fresh parmesan instead... Fantastic!

This recipe was fantastic! I wanted to recreate the Tuscan soup they have at Olive Garden so instead of using spinach (which I read in other reviews became too soft), I used Kale which held its shape but was still tender and DELICIOUS! I also topped it with some grated Romano cheese which added some extra flavor and I suggest adding crushed red pepper flakes depending on how spicy the sausage you may be using is. The Italian sausage I used looked like it would be spicy according to the package but it didn't have enough kick for me. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe it is definitely a "go too" recipe for me

Easy to make and tastes great. You can use frozen spinach - it doesn't matter. I simplified by boiling the potatoes in the broth until they were almost done, then added the rest of it for about five more minutes.  That makes it a one-pot meal.

This was amazing!  Some changes:  In a large stock pot, I sauteed the diced white onion in a little EVOO, then added the spicy turkey sausage (all 5-minus the casing).  Browned those, did not drain fat, and added the sliced potatoes (you get a lot from 6-7 medium whole potatoes), added about 8 cups of low fat chicken stock, and brought to a boil.  Salt and pepper were OK, but I have something called Italian Seasoning Mix, so I added that, with some garlic powder...and wow!  Finally, I used frozen chopped collard greens (about 2 cups), and threw that in after the potatoes were already soft---cooking them for an additional 5-10 minutes to heat up a bit.  This is good without the milk (which we had half and half---works well), but it's each person's taste.  A little parmesan cheese on top and it was delicious!  Not too bad for you either!!!  Thanks!

Great soup! I scaled this to 7 servings since I wanted to use all 5 links in the package (hot/spicy turkey sausage). Used chicken bouillon since I didn't have actual broth on hand (for 10 1/2 cups). 1 1/2 small onions, 3 large potatoes (all I had), 2 bunches of fresh chopped spinach, 1 full can 2% evaporated milk, about 1/2 cup bacon bits (really adds flavor), 2 fresh cloves minced garlic, 1 can white beans plus pepper to taste. Excellent!

Very easy recipe to follow and easy to enhance. I used a bit more sausage and also added garlic. When the potatoes were done, I used a wooden spoon to mash the potatoes into the broth giving the soup a nice texture. I also add a splash more evaporated milk and a dash of Italian seasoning.

I enjoyed this soup.  I subbed Italian seasoned ground turkey for the sausage and it worked out well.  Next time, I think I will peel the potatoes first and cut them into much smaller chunks, and make a roux so it will be a little thicker.  Good recipe.

The recipe as written is pretty blah - I followed it as written except added some carrots and canelli beans. The broth was a milky watery film. (I think another reviewer was right - it had an identity crisis)  So I took some flour and butter and added the rest of the can of evaporated milk + some 2% milk and made a thick gravy and added it to the soup - then it was 4.5 star worthy - not thick but not watery. Served it with a crusty loaf of chiabatta bread. Thanks for the start of a great soup.

We have an Italian Restaurant and were looking for a different type of soup to serve.  This one sounded really good so we tried it.  This soup has been a big hit with all the customers who have ordered it.  We did not change anything in the recipe.  Quick and easy to make.

Very good soup and easy to make. Had leftover links in the freezer so tried this. Very tasty! Added chopped garlic along with the onion and a large bag of spinach. Only wish it was a little thicker but that could easily be solved by adding a couple heaping tablespoons of instant mashed potato flakes, my secret weapon when thickening soups. Got better with flavor the next day, too. Bonus!

Superb, everyone loved it.  Used a few spicy patties I needed to use up plus a few italian turkey sausage links crumbled.  Made a roue instead of the evaporated milk.

Loved this!  I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand and other reviews.  Used 5 cups beef stock and entire can of milk (low fat) and used 1 package of Gnocchi in place of potatoes.  It was awesome.

I've made this twice now... 1st with a medium italian sausage and the 2nd time with hot italian sausage.  I have found that the hotter the spices in your italian sausage the better!  Puts the perfect blend of spices in the broth!  Great comfort soup!

This soup was great!!! I did drain the sausage which I am glad I did, because it was fatty! I made a couple of changes - I used kale instead of spinach because that's what Olive Garden uses and I truly enjoy that. I also used 3 extra cups of broth because I found that 6 cups just wasn't enough. Also, I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 2% milk. Unfortunately 1/2 of 2% milk just doesn't cut it. I actually added a total of 3 cups of milk. Made the soup JUST like OG!

This is a great, quick soup without a lot of ingredients. I added some chopped carrots to the onions while they were cooking, and a few dashes of hot sauce. The hot sauce really adds another level of flavor, without being too spicy. Thanks for a quick go-to recipe!

Delicious! I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I just added 1 cup of skim milk. It was very good! I'd add more spinach next time.

I have made this soup for years now and I agree you can't make a small batch because EVERYONE wants some!  But why is everyone using spinach?  The original recipe & Olive Garden uses Kale!  I also use red potatos w/skin, double the onions & garlic. I use granulated chicken base & the small container of whipping cream.

I use a couple pounds of red potatoes and cook them in the crockpot with the chicken broth for about 6 hours on high with the onion. Right before serving, I stir in a pound of turkey breakfast sausage the milk. I then ladle the soup over the spinach. I garnish it with a good sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese. GOOD soup. I can usually make a pot of this and eat on it for lunch all week.

this was a great simple soup.  Followed others advice, added a can of drained diced tomatoes and a can of drained and rinsed white kidney beans.  I used more spinach than called for and added a couple pinchs of red pepper flakes along with fresh basil, garlic and parsley.

I did some variations on this soup. I used kale instead of the spinach and added it in and simmered for twenty minutes and used half and half instead of evaporated milk and I used 6 bouillion cubes and 61/2 cups of water. This I boiled on the stove until cubes were dissolved and added the potatoes and cooked until tender. Sauteed spicy italian sausage and the onions and I did not drain the sausage, if too much oil drain some but it adds more flavor .. I did not use any salt as the bouillion had enough and added pepper ... My friend loved it and I served a spring mix salad and garlic knots

This soup was delicious! The hubby raved about it. I followed the directions listed, except that I used the whole can of evaporated milk and added garlic. It was creamy, yet pretty light. It was easy to make and came together quickly.  We will definitely be making this soup many times in the future.

This soup was great!  My boyfriend and his son loved it!  I would definitely make this again.  I did make a few alterations to the recipe after reading comments by other members.  I used Kale instead of Spinach and Half & Half instead of Evaporated Milk.  I also added minced garlic, garlic powder, McCormics Italian seasoning, and a dash of McCormick's Lemon Herb seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper the recipe called for.  One other thing I did was use beef bullion to make the broth.  I did not brown the sausage and onions first due to trying to save time, but it still tasted very similar to the Zuppa Tuscona soup I usually order when I go out to the Olive Garden.  Thank you to whoever wrote this recipe because now I can eat this soup anytime I want in my own home.  :)

Delicious!  I increased the number of sausages, browned them whole, and sliced them before adding to the soup.  With hot Italian bread, it's a meal.

Fantastic soup!  I used a package of Italian sausage and just added more chicken broth & a half a cup of evaporated milk since I used more sausage then the recipe called for.  Other than that I kept as written.  The taste was very flavorful.  Great soup for a cold winter night!  Enjoyed by all.

This was pretty good.  I started with chopped onion, carrot, celery, and 2 cloves of garlic, because all soups should start this way.  I followed the rest of the recipe closely, except for using heavy cream in place of the evaporated milk, since I didn't have any.  I don't know if I'd make this again, but it was a nice change for once, since it had potatoes rather than pasta or rice like most soups of this kind.

I used 1/2 bunch of kale instead of spinach, 4 oz of Jimmy Dean's Hot Italian Sausage, and a little Parmesan cheese, and my boyfriend said it is better than the restaurant's. Served it with salad and bread.

This soup has been in my collection since January of 2006. I love it. I'ts simple to make. This is a 'go to' recipe when I need something reliable and unique. I try to prepare recipes from these collections exactly as they are written to ensure a fair review of them. This recipe was perfect for my tastes  exactly as it is written.

This is such a good, yummy soup! I have made it on numerous occasions, and have played around a little with the ingredients (as with any soup!). I've added tomatoes, roasted red peppers, yellow peppers, and ALWAYS add tons of garlic! I've made it spicier with cayenne, or have substituted bacon for the sausage. Sour cream works well too if you don't have the condensed milk. Try topping with fresh, shredded Parmesan after serving into bowls. mmmmmm

I love this recipe.  Very full of flavor. I have made this a number of time and it always turns out great. The only change that I make is that I use Sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy.  That way the kids eat it too. Very easy too.  Thanks!

I have made this many times - it is so forgiving.  I have used pasta instead of potatoes; frozen spinach (one box or two depending on my audience); the whole can of evaporated SKIM - why waste it?  Everyone always loves it especially with a little shaved cheese on top - but leave out the salt!

I followed the recipe exactly, but we didn't care for this one. After the White Chili recipe that I found on this site, we're pretty spoiled when it comes to soup/chili/stew. Thanks anyway though.

This recipe was so good!! It was so easy to prepare and tasted as yummy as the Tuscan style soup that Olive Garden serves (one of my favorites)!  My husband absolutely loved it and I will definitely be making this soup again real soon!  Although I don't believe you need to change a thing for this soup to taste great, instead of using the spicy sausage, I used a pound of sweet Italian basil sausage and about one and a half cups of chopped baby spinach.  I would also recommend doubling the recipe since you are going to want seconds!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Dianne!

I tried this recipe and is was really great. I used bulk sausage instead of the links. My husband ate several bowls of this. I will be making this one again really soon. It is really addictive to eat. You have to try it.

This soup was fabulous. I did add a couple of cloves of garlic when I cooked the sausage and onions.  I also made my own chicken broth and I chopped up the chicken and put it in the soup as well.  It was a great success....I also used the mild italian sausage...but if you like alot of heat, you should use the hot.

I made some minor changes, but thought it was excellent as written.  1. I used about 3/4 pound bulk hot (spicy) breakfast sausage, and browned it until crisp. 2. I used 1 whole can evaporated milk. (Next time I may try real cream).  3.  I made the basic soup mid-day and let it sit about 4 or 5 hours to blend the tastes.  Then I reheated it, and picked up the recipe steps with adding the spinach.  Mine made about 8 servings.  I think this is a real winner!  Thank you, Dianne.

Yum! I made this with 1 full can of evap. milk and some grated parm cheese.  This was awesome.  It goes very well with garlic bread. I added more sausage than what the recipe called for.  Next time I may add a whole pack of sausage.  I have found a keeper that is easy and just wonderful.

This was a great starter recipe, however I did make a few changes. I added       1 bunch of escarole to the spinach and used spicy turkey sausage along with a couple minced cloves of garlic when browning the sausage. I also added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a can of great northern beans. Instead of canned milk, I used 1/2 and 1/2 cuz that's what I had ( I used about a cup cuz I doubled the recipe) We had this soup with sliced ciabatta bread that was grilled with olive oil rubbed with garlic and then broiled with fresh parmasean cheese.
My husband gobbled this up and said it was definately a keeper!!!!! Thanks for the inspiration Dianne :)

Very good, I made a few changes for my familys taste I used the whole 5 link package of hot italian sausage, 8 cups of chicken broth, 7 cups of cubed potatoes so it is not too spicy and 1/2 cup of cream, all the other ingredients the same as the original recipe

This is not the "To-Die-For" Soup one may imagine when reading the reviews.  It was OK, but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  Probably won't make it again.

I was more than happy with this recipe.  I rarely give 5 stars.  But, there isn't anything I can think of to make this recipe better.  I made it as-is...no changes.  Delightful on a winter night!

I know this will become a family favorite.

Made this soup for a dinner party last Saturday.  Everyone LOVEed it!  I guess the potatoes I used are really big, there's so little broth left after all is done.  I'll use only two next time I'm making it.

Since it is soup weather now, I was looking for something new and simple.  This is it!  I used mild sausage, added a little flour to the sausage/onion mixture for thickening and topped the soup with parmesan.  Delicious!  Thanks Dianne for the great recipe.

My husband and I love soup and eat it as a main dish. I have made many soups and this goes to the top of the list.
I substituted sweet Italian sausage, heavy cream and 1 can of cannelini beans for one of the potatoes.

A nice flavor.  Good as a side dish rather than a main dish, in spite of the sausage.

This is one of the best soup recipes we have ever had.  My husband and I both loved
it.  It does taste just like the Olive Garden soup I always order when there.

We substituted small navy beans for the potatoes and used half and half.  It
was awesome even before we added the cream.  I may leave it out next time.

Try this, you can't go wrong!

My Husband loves this recipe, He say's it 
tastes just like Olive Garden's Recipe. I 
made it with half and half this time instead
of evaporated milk and I liked it better. 
This recipe is definitely a keeper!    I've made this soup so many times since my first review.I wanted to add that I use crushed garlic and always use half and half. Lately I've been buying Tuscan kale at whole foods and it's wonderful in this soup .My guys love it so much!

My husband said that he didn't like the hot sausage that I used.  He said if I make it again I should use Bob Evans roll sausage and only used 1/2 roll.  The soup was too hot for me, but other than that it was good.  I added some garlic and white kidney beans.

I made the recipe exactly as written the first time and it was very good. I decided to play around and I added white beans, kidney beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes and parmesan cheese while cooking. I've made it multiple times with the added ingredients and my whole family loves it! Always serve with freshly grated parmesan and plenty of garlic bread!

overall, my impression is "not bad." the flavor seems a little lacking as if some key ingredient is missing. might be needing a little garlic to give a kick :) i took the advice of one reviewer to add in another solid such as white beans in my case. overall, i might make this soup again if its a hit with the family. after all, its quick and easy :)

My family loved this recipe!! However, the second time making this meal I added some more into it. 1 or less teaspoons of Reggano Parmesan grated cheese, bit of butter a couple shakes of garlic powder and some bread sticks on the side. So all in all it's a great warm meal. =)

I use red new or baby potatoes, scrubbed well with peelings left on  sliced not cubed, and half and half not evaporated milk. Need to use SPICY Italian sausage and crumble it for best flavor in this soup. One could use Kale or Spinach.

Great base for the zuppa tuscana from Olive Garden.  I did change a few things- Add 3 cloves garlic that i sauted in with the onion, exchanged chopped kale for the spinach, and I usually exchange half & half for the evaporated milk.  However right now with watching my calories, i used turkey italian sausage rinsed and fat free evaporated milk- whole can. Serve with fresh grated parmesean cheese and baguette.  Thanks for the great recipe.

so easy and delicious.  Took other reviewers advice and added a can of white beans (next time I would add 2).  Used a whole can of evaporated mile and 2 cartons (8 cups broth) because I used a whole package (6 links) sausage.

Been making this or something similar for years.  Easy to follow - I use Kale instead of Spinach but either is great. Other times I puree a few pieces of the cooked potato to thicken it a bit.  Yummy either way.

I made this soup for my staff and they absolutely loved it!!  I used hot italian sausage this time.  If i made it for my family i think i would use mild sausage.  Draining the fat off with cool water is a great tip as well!  I needed to use my crock pot, as i was taking it to work, so i boiled the potatoes in the chicken broth, then fried the sausage and onions.  I put them together in the crock pot, added the rest of the ingredients, and cooked on high for about 2 hours, then reduced to low or warm until we were ready to eat!  Turned out great!

Only had regular sausage and it definitely needed the spice. Even with added garlic, red pepper flakes and some cayenne this was bland albeit perfect for my aunt and uncle in their mid-70's.  I probably won't try this again

I altered this recipe since I am a vegetarian by using 
Field Roast vegan grain meatlike chorizo links and vegetable broth. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as written. 

The result was a lovely delicious soup that was easy to prepare.

This soup is absolutely delicious. My whole family loves this soup, I've even shared this recipe with a few friends. I alter it just a bit, I add 4 links of sausage and a little over a quarter cup of heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. You can also substitute the spicy sausage with regular Italian sausage links. A recipe worth trying!

I've been using this recipe for about 8 years. The recipe as written is just fine, but also very forgiving if you decide to make adjustments.
Optional suggestions: mild Italian sausage instead of spicy, kale instead of spinach, use could double the amount of Italian sausage all together, drop in the rind of parmigiano reggiano, and/or garnish with fresh chopped parsley.
This is an awesome recipe as is, and I know it's a recipe that my daughters will one day make for their future families too.

Delicious.  Made a few modifications.  I cooked the sausage on its own so I could drain the fat from it and sauteed the onion with a few garlic cloves.  About 5 minutes before it was done cooking, I added fresh parsley, oregano, basil and 1 can great northern beans.  I subbed 2/3 c. cream for the evap. milk.  Perfect soup for a cold day.  I think that next time I'll use gnocchi instead of potatoes.

this is a really good basis for your own embellishment. i didn't venture too far since it was my first time making it, but i took the advice of another user and added parmesan cheese and cooked it in the crock pot. a whole onion may be a little generous, but i placed half in the broth which i had warming already and half with the sausage in the pan for browning. i think the evaporated milk adds quite a bit, even if it's only in color. this is a very good recipe!

Very good! It was very salty so I had to add some water to it. I also added garlic and a splash of red wine, and some italian seasonings. Topped with parmsean  cheese shavings. Served with garlic bread.

Doubled the recipe, used red potates (skin on and sliced) and half and half.  Took others suggestons and drained the sausage after browning.  Added some oregano, a couple of palm fulls of grated cheese and used baby spinach.  Def was yummy but feel it can be better, a little more tasteful.  Will add chopped garlic next time while browing the sausage.  All in all a keeper!

This is a wonderful soup, and full of flavor.  I added a large chopped chicken breast, a rinsed can of canellini beans, a rind of locatelli, rosemary and crushed red pepper to taste.  It is imperative that  you use the HOT Italian sausage, as the sweet just doesn't add enough flavor.  The locatelli rind adds a nice dimension to the dish, and should be removed before serving.  If you serve it with garlic or cheese bread, it's a filling, low cal winter meal.

Rather than using white potato, I substituted with reds.  I know "Tuscan" indicates spices, but the family chose a milder sausage (apple flavored) and
the soup was still as delicious as Dianne's.

Great Soup!  The best thing about this recipe is that it takes less than 30 minutes to make!  The sausage gives it soo much flavor and the spinach adds some extra color and nutrients.  We loved it!

The flavor of the sausage will really determine how this soup tastes; I used jalapeno chicken sausage from Trader Joe’s.  Also, I found that about 8 oz of spinach was a proportionate amount.  Delicious!

I have made this so many times now.  I keep trying variations.  The first time, I made it as written and it was perfect!  I've tried it with frozen spinach, not as good.  I've tried different types of sausage and also with collard greens, and also with kale.  The original recipe with kicked up spices is, by far, the best! Friends now flock to me upon hearing that I'm making it again. Friends of friends have asked for for the recipe, it is thought of that highly!  Yay soup!

Easy to make and tastes great. Browned the meat with onions in the pot and added the rest so there were less dishes. Works well with escarole as well.

I served it to my extended family, and everyone LOVED it....so simple but full of flavour!  Like other reviewers, I added white beans and a can of diced tomatoes. Because the package of sausage had five links, I almost doubled the amount of broth and added a whole can of evaporated milk.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh. Will definately make again!

I used all 5 spicy sausage and it is HOT!  Will try again with Mild sausage and then add hot sauce or red pepper flakes to taste.  Added dash of italian seasoning and a can of white beans.  Softened onions in butter in soup pot, then browned sausage and followed the recipe the rest of the way.

Awesome soup!  The only tweaks I made were swapping kale for spinach, and adding a can of cannelli and garbonza beans.  I will be making this again soon.

This is a delicious recipe.  I used Cajun Sausage (cut into small pieces).  For seasoning, I used half teaspoon Cayenne Pepper.  1 teaspoon Basil and 1 teasp Garlic, and also a smidgeon of Habernero pepper sauce.  It was great.  My bf ate two bowls and kept complimenting the broth.  Only reason I give 4 stars is because I'm not a huge soup eater, but given how cold it is, it hits the spot!

This soup was very good.  My husband said it was "amazing".  I followed the recipe for the most part, but just went ahead and added the whole can of evaporated milk.  I used quite a bit black pepper.  I then added a dash of garlic powder, italian seasoning and sprinkled with really good parmesan cheese.

Loved this soup! Very flavorful and hearty meal with a salad and a warm crusty loaf of Pugliese. Used spicy chicken Italian sausage and sauteed with the onion first before adding to a crockpot. Cut the chicken broth to 4 cups to avoid opening up 2 quart boxes of broth. I added the pressed garlic, diced tomatoes and cannellini beans suggested by others. Then I used the entire 12 ounce can of evaporated milk which I added at the last hour along with a box of thawed out frozen spinach. Kicked up the spicy factor with ¼ teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I will definitely be sharing this recipe and making it over and over.

I think this soup was great.  I added some flavors to suit my needs: italian seasoning, cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and carrots, and of course some garlic cheese bread.  This was so delicious and defintely worthy as restaurant soup! My fiance and I will keep this recipe.

I was looking for a quick meal and this worked out great!  My husband and I both loved it.  I doubled the evaporated milk, added more hot pepper to my sausage when frying and added some parm cheese at the end.  It came out awesome and will definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe, the only thing I didn't like about it was the amount of potato, I thought there was too much, but that's just my personal preference.  Since the sausage comes in a package of 5, I put all of them in there and thought it was great.  It gives the broth such great flavor.  Added tomatoes and kidney beans, delicious.  Thank you.

Loved this soup!  I bought the sausages from the Whole Foods meat counter so I bought two hot and one mild and the spice was about perfect for me.  The only changes I made were to use kale instead of spinach and added some garlic to the onions and sausage while they were cooking.  I simmered the soup for about an hour.  I found it was even better the second day.

So good. I added 2 cans of potatoes since I didn't have any fresh ones on hand and used mild sausage because of the kids. Serve with salad and garlic bread. Only 4 stars because the kids complained of it being spicy (even with mild sausage). But the grown ups loved it. Delish!

This soup was very bland; the only flavor was when you were lucky enough to get a piece of sausage. I won’t make this again, but if I did I would defiantly add more spices!

Yum! Used kale instead of spinach and didn't use the milk. Added diced tomatoes for a little more color. Carrots would not be bad either if they were sauteed with the onion. Drain the sausage and rinse and that will take care of some excess fat.

Delicious! Both my husband and I loved this soup. I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage links which definitely gave the soup a kick. For the spinach I just grabbed a big handful out of a bag of baby spinach and chopped it. I do wish I would have drained the sausage better or rinsed it after cooking as quite a bit of grease showed up on top of the soup. I also added a dab of cream since I didn't think it looked creamy enough with the evaporated milk. Will definitely keep this recipe!

This was very good, the only thing I did differently was add the whole can of condensed (fat free) milk because I didn't want to waste the rest.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is thicken it a bit with flour or corn starch.

Excellent soup. To the recipe, per other reviewers, I added the entire can evap soup, a can of diced tomatoes, and red pepper flakes. I used a package of 5 turkey basil sausage from Sams Club, just sliced into bite size pieces and fried with onion before putting into soup. Also substituted one sweet potato for one potato. Used an immersion blender for 1/2 the soup, left the other 1.2 chunky. It is excellent. Will make for sure again. Its a keeper.

I have been making a clone of the O. Garden toscana soup for about ten years. It's a dead ringer! And now we have fat free 1/2 & 1/2 available. I also use kale and either hot or sweet Italian sausage. If I have the sweet, I add some fennel and dried red pepper flakes to the broth. I slice, not dice my potatoes after they have been scrubbed really well. (don't peel) I have taken it to work to potlucks and always end up giving the recipe out. Of course, it's also nice to sit at the restaurant, visit with my honey while we're waited on!

This is fantastic! I pretty much followed the recipe although I added sriracha because I love things that are spicy. Thanks for the great recipe Dianne, I will make this again!

I used chicken and frozen spinach instead, and added some rice as I only had 2 smallish potatoes. It was tasty. It's a pretty generous 4 servings for sure!

This soup is great! I made two small variations. I used hot turkey italian sausage instead of regular. I also bought a garlic and cheese focaccia, baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, cut it up and placed it in the bottom of the soup bowl, poured the soup on top and let it sit for about five minutes. DELICIOUS!

This was good, but not a must have for my personal recipe box. I did modify slightly to add more flavor and more chunk because we like our soups chunky and hearty. So here's what I did!  I diced up two medium red potatoes. Put them in a pot and covered them with homemade chicken stock. Brought to a boil and reduced heat to medium high. Cooked for 15 minutes. Peeled one delicata squash, scooped out the seeds and diced up. Tossed into the pot with the potatoes and cooked for another five minutes. While the potatoes and squash are cooking, in a sautee pan I cook the sausage (I buy bulk italian sausage so I don't have to remove the skin), onion, and 4 cloves minced garlic. Add the cooked sausage to the pot with the potatoes. Deglaze the sautee pan with about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of stock. Pour into the pot with the potatoes. Add in 1 15 oz can oz diced tomatoes, half a 15 oz can of green beans (drained), 1 15 oz can of kidney beans (drained and rinsed), and 5 mushrooms, halved and sliced. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Add in the evaporated milk and spinach. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Thanks for a good base recipe!

Added a cup of pasta along with the stock, really glad I added the pasta it just gave it that little extra texture.  When I first tasted this soup, was not much for it at all, needed lots of seasoning to give it some taste.  With the addition of lots of pepper it was perfect.  Next time I think I will add some bacon.  Also used hot and spicy sausage.

I changed 4 things.  
I used mild Italian sausage. Added extra sausage. Added in about 1/3 teaspoon of coarse ground garlic powder...and used low sodium chicken broth.  You can't beat this one for a fast "soup" night!  Also...it was already in mellow flavor right away.  A lot of soups are BETTER the next day, but this one was just GREAT right off the stove.  We are soup lovers and we really enjoyed this!

Amazing!  This soup's flavor and delicious smell appealed to everyone.  I used an entire roll of italian sausage (crumbled and browned in a skillet) and substituted a package of frozen spinach (microwaved briefly to defrost) for the fresh.  I also doubled the potatoes and used regular milk (which made the soup a little lighter, I think).  Pair this soup with a crusty roll and you have a wonderful winter meal.

Loved the flavor and so easy to make.  The only thing I might change is the evaporated milk to cream but the evaporated milk tasted great too.  I also like mine a little spicy so I added a little red pepper.  My husband so this was definitly a keeper.

I've made this twice now, and it has come out perfect both times.  I really enjoy the smooth broth and the spicy sausage.  I used poultry sausage both times and I am extremely pleased with the results.

This is a great quick and easy dinner on a chilly night.  I used the entire package of Hot Italian sausage and about twice as much spinach as the recipe called for.  The soup was very satisfying with just a little kick.  The condensed milk gives it just the right creaminess.  Served with a loaf of crusty Italian bread, olive oil and cheese.  Wonderful!

This is a great simple soup.  I Just finished it and am taking it to a friends for lunch.  I am sure all the other variations were helpful according to preference, but I am giving it 5 starts AS IS.  I was too lazy to do the onion and used onion powder and it was still great.  I used spiced Italian sausage, and I did as recommended, drained and rinsed sausage.  I bet it is even better after sitting a day!

This was excellent.  I did make a few changes.  I used sweet italian sausage, and then just added some red pepper flakes to taste.  I used half/half, instead of evaporated milk.  I also sauted with the onion, 2 cloves of garlic.  It turned out to be a nice hearty soup.  Served with salad, and warm bread. We loved it-  Thanks

This is an easy tasty soup I make a big batch and freeze single servings for me. Since we like spicy I use sweet italian and hot sausage, I make at least 6-10 cups of chicken broth and a pound of each sausage and use 5 potatoes. I make it all the time and my son and guest LOVE it! It takes no time to make!

Pretty good. Used mild Italian turkey sausage.  The evaporated milk didn't add much to the soup, so I some heavy cream (maybe a 1/4 cup). Used frozen spinach.

Excellent. I followed the suggestions and used five sausages, an entire can of evaporated milk, shell pasta as a sub for the potatoes, a can of white beans, extra fennel and some dried basil and used fresh pak choy and spinach from my garden.

It amazes me how someone can take a recipe and and alter it, sometimes with several different ingredients and then give a wonderful recipe like this less than 5 stars. This recipe is delicious.

Excellent.  Cooked this in the crockpot.  As another suggested, I used a can of evaporated milk, as well as sour cream.  I also used bulk mild Italian sausage and frozen spinach.

This is a good soup.  I had to use mild sausage for my kid's sake and just add red pepper flakes to my bowl.  I also added cream to the soup just before serving (a tip from another recipe variation).

This is a really good soup. I did use seashell pasta instead of the potatoes and I cooked sliced carrots in chicken broth and then added it to my soup and I tripled the spinach and this soup was excellent.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I didn't make it exactly as stated. I would rate my version as 4 stars. I only used 2 potatoes, no evaporated milk, chicken bouillon instead of broth, no onion, extra sausage (sweet Italian turkey sausage), frozen spinach instead of fresh and added half a pound of pasta. It was delicious and hearty, but even after eating three servings, I found myself unsatisfied and hungry an hour or two later. I don't think my changes would have anything to do with that. I guess my mistake was serving this as a main dish instead of a soup course. Otherwise this was a good recipe. Next time I will use wheat pasta to make it bulkier and serve with something else. I will also use spicy Italian sausage, which I think would be great - I had to use sweet this time because the boyfriend doesn't like spicy.

I would call this soup good but not as great as all the reviews describe.  I liked it fine but my family didn't AT ALl.  Followed the recipe to the letter except, based on the reviews, I doubled it thinking everyone would wolf it down.  Big mistake.

My family loved this soup.  I added some chopped carrots and a can of drained white beans with the potatoes. I didn't add the evaporated milk, I smashed some of the potatoes in the soup to thicken it.  It was a great way to get my kids to eat spinach.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has been a family classic now for the last 6 months since I found this recipe. My dad just asked me to make it again for his visit. I have to admit, that I prefer making without the evaporated milk. The first time I made it, I tried the soup before adding it, and I liked the taste better.. so I've been making it without since. it's delicious both ways.

This was very east to make. Overall, it was pretty good but I thought it needed a little "help." I did not add salt but found it to be salty when finished. I ended up adding the entire can of evaporated milk to mellow it out. I also like spinach so I added an entire bag from the produce section. For flavor, I kicked in a tsp of onion/garlic pepper. If you want to thicken your soup, remove 1/2 C. of the cooked potatoes and mash them with 1Tbs of flour and some of the liquid from the soup. When fully mixed, stir in with the rest of the soup and bring to a simmer for a few minutes. Thank you for posting this recipe as I also like the Olive Garden soup.

I made my own stock today and then used it in this soup.  Boy, was it good.  I only wish I had a loaf of bread to eat it with!  I used spicy turkey sausage and added a TBP of flour after frying hoping to have the soup a little thicker.  It may have helped some, but I would have liked it slightly more thick.  Next time I make it I'll use more.  Very easy to make, and very, very tasty.  I will make again and again.

I have made this soup dozens of times in the past five years and it is always a hit!  everyone loves it - DELICIOUS!  it can be made more fattening or more healthy, whatever you're in the mood for... the sausages, potatoes and spinach are a fantastic combination, love it!!

The soup was great. Though I used sweet Italian Sausage rather than the hot and spicy italian sausage due to that some of my family members doesn't like spicy stuff. It still tasted good.  Will try the spicy later.

Awsome! I made it in the slow cooker and added kale instead of spinach about 10 minutes before serving. My husband has been making requests for me to make this again soon.

My DH and I really liked this soup a lot.  It was very quick and easy to throw together on a week night.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to the chicken broth - I added 1600 ml intead and it was just the right amount IMHO.  I will likely make this again...but next time I will add pasta instead of potatoes...or maybe even canellini beans!

Exceptional! My husband and I enjoyed this soup so much I can’t wait to make it again. As other raters suggested, I added white beans, parsley, Italian spices and garlic powder. Instead of potatoes, I used mushrooms, which added to the flavor, but probably made the soup thinner than it would have been otherwise. Yummy!

Absolutely Delicious...My whole family loved this recipe...even my kiddies. Although they tried to pick out all the spinach...so the second time I left it out, but it wasn't as good. It definitely added a bit to this recipe. Thanks...it was great and we will definitely make it over and over.

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this soup.  His comment was "it's a keeper".  So I made it again, this time adding carrots and more spinach.  We thought it was better with more "stuff" in it.

We have never been fans of this, but this recipe is exceptional.  It was great to have onhand for an "instant" dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it, but to experiment the next time I will try some of the others suggestions (especially garlic).

I liked this soup as did my boys age 9, 6 and 4 year.  I used 2 cups of rice instead of potato and liked it a lot.  I used chicken base and water vs. chicken broth and it got very salty, so need to adjust next time.  I also used real cream and liked it, obviously not cutting the fat.

I just made this for the second time . This time I used kale instead of spinach , italian sausage from a roll and added the sauce(roux) from the "delicious ham and potato soup " recipe on this site . That solved the problem some were having about the thin broth. I have 4 teen boys eating without complaint , actually praising the soup ! Either way you fix it this is terrific soup !

Surprisingly my husband liked this soup much better than I did.  I can't say exactly why I was disappointed in it because it wasn't really bad, it just didn't make my list of favorite soups.  I cut the amount of broth in half and I'm glad I did or it would have been much too soupy.  I doubt I will make it again.

Excellent recipe!  I served it with a warm, crusty bread (which was awesome dipped in the soup).  I did as other reviewers suggested and added a can of basil & oregano seasoned diced tomatoes.  I was also going to add the white beans, but I forgot!  I will definitely make this again, and add the beans next time.  My whole family (including kids who don't like spinach) loved it!

The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was because I changed it a bit too much to rate the original.  I actually used this as a base to start with then changed it a bit to make it healthier, and it was fabulous.  My boyfriend, who hates "healthy" food could not stop eating it.  I used lean turkey sausage, both spicy and sweet,used a few more links, used 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 fat free chicken broth, instead of the potatoes I used red, yellow and orange peppers and added a can of diced tomato w/italian spices along with some chopped garlic in place of milk.  Again it was fabulous!  Thanks for the great starter!

The 6 people who ate this soup all loved it!  In order to use all 5 of the sausages, I increased the recipe to 8 cups broth, 4 lg. potatoes and 1/2 cup evap. milk.  All other ingredients as stated.  It was delicious and one I will use a lot, especially in the Winter.

THANK YOU! THIS SOUP IS KILLER! I made a larger batch and froze some leftovers. I also added garlic, oregano and Parmesean cheese. Very easy to make and just so good. I think I will try to make this in the crockpot sometime. Nice change from our Lancaster County- PA Dutch Potato soup. Great leftover too!

This was delicious, hearty, and so easy!  I used frozen, chopped spinach.  I also added the whole can of evaporated milk (14 oz. I think).  Very yummy!

This is the perfect "Hungry Man" dish. If you have a guy like me in your house (I run about 5'10 230lbs) who has a stomach like a horse and likes to eat use this dish. Its a hearty meal a little heavy on the sodium but perfect in taste. I used 1 whole 2 oz can of milk. I added garlic bread as a side but could only eat one bowl because it is so filling. Being a novice at cooking this was actually really easy to make.

Exactly what I was looking for...used turkey sausage and fat free evaporated milk and it still turned out great. Also added 2 cloves of garlic and red pepper flakes to the onion mixture and topped with parmesan cheese in bowl. Will absolutely make this again-especially good for a "warm winter soup."

My family liked this soup a lot, and it was easy to make.  I did use frozen spinach, and I doubled the meat, as it was our supper, with crusty bread.  I will definitely make this again.

I LOVED this soup.  I used spicy italian turkey sausage, and it was a BIG hit at my house.  What was leftover did not last long.  I will be making this often.

Used 1 link spicy italian sausage + 4 slices chopped bacon, and subbed half a cup of 1% milk instead of evaporated.  I added grated parm and hot pepper flakes to leftovers, and that helped.

This was delicious!  I didn't have evaporated milk, so I substituted sour cream.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh - approximately 1/2 of a 16 oz bag.  I would definitely make this again!

Delicious soup!  This was a very simple soup to make but still had a wonderful flavor.  We used precleaned baby spinach as someone else suggested and we added a bit of Tony Chachere's seasoning to kick up the heat a little bit.  I think we will add some white beans next time to make the soup a bit more filling for the men folk.

Wonderful soup! I used a roll of low fat sausage,added 2 diced carrots,1 can of mushrooms & 2 cloves of garlic. I used 4 cans of broth.I also used a tall can of evaporated milk with 1Tbs. of cornstarch whisked in. And a handful of Italian 4 cheese.Serve with homemade croutons and a sprinkle of parmesan.

One of my favorites from this site!!  It is so quick and easy and the flavor is fantastic.  My 7 year old son, who does not like spinach - always asks if I am making this when he sees me cutting up potatoes (even if they are for something else) because he loves this soup.  It is SOOO great with freshly grated parm.  I make this all wintr long and never tire of it.  It is even better the next day!!

Delicious and deemed "fabulous" by my otherwise picky husband.  I substituted heavy whipping cream for the evaporated milk and added a couple cloves of garlic and a can of cannellini bean for an even heartier soup.  Topped with grated romano cheese, it's a new family favorite!

This is delicious! I made it once with carrots instead of potatoes and it still turned out perfect. I have also used turkey sausage, less fat same great taste.

Excellent.  It was important to use hot sausage because it really gives the broth a kick.  I wouldn't change a thing with this one.

Very easy and good.  I used white beans (2 cans) instead of potatoes.  I also added parm cheese. Would be good with a little grated carrots and/or minced celery.

Oh WOW.  This soup was amazing!  And SO quick!  I felt like a pro after making it!  I used maple sausage as it was all the store had at the time and half and half as recommended.  The maple sausage gave it a fabulous flavor and it wasn't even real spicey!  I strongly suggest sprinkling with freshly grated parmasean for an even greater effect.  Enjoy!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It is just like the one at Olive Garden.  I did use half and half instead of evaporated milk like someone suggested and I do think it would taste just as good without it.  Very fast and easy to make.  Serve with some crusty french bread and it is a complete meal!

This soup is really delicious!  I thought is seemed like it was too simple with not enough ingredients, but the flavour was great!  It may not be a real hit with kids because it was quite spicy, but it hit the spot for me.  I made a few changes, and it came out great anyhow: used one can chicken stock and one can beef stock (by accident), light cream instead of evap. milk, and added a few Tbsp flour at the end to slightly thicken the broth.  I also added some simple home-made croutons for crunch on top.  Can't wait to make it again, thanks for the recipe!

This soup was fanatastic.  The reason I didn't rate high for kids because it was too spicy.  I would use mild sausage for kids.  I will definately make this again.

Yummy. yummy. yummy.
It doesn't get much tastier than this - or easier.  I wasn't sure this would compare to the Olive Garden's, but it definitely does!  
I used homemade chicken broth -- I would highly recommend it.

It's a very easy and quick recipe that gives a good start on making a Tuscan soup.  however, I agree that it is a bit bland and could use some improvements.  I added a small amount of chopped parsnips and it was a wonderful addition of flavor.  next time I will add more, plus garlic, fresh thyme and parsley.  the potatoes were too bland so I will sautee them with the meat and onions and add the salt and garlic then.  u think this will make a huge differemce.

I follow the directions of the original recipe but added celery, carrots and use two different types of sausage (mild and chipotle cheddar)  2 of each because I made a larger portion of soup.

The key is to thinly slice potatoes. Dont use spinach, use kale and use mild sausage if you use crushed red pepper. Dont put carrots in it. It takes away from the flavor. But baby potabellas are good in it too.

I've made this more times than I can recall at this point and have tried several of my own variations. I skip the evaporated milk and use whole milk (it's what I always have on hand), mild sausage instead of hot (so the kids will eat it), kale instead of spinach (it's what the big chain uses and gives a flavor I prefer), and add some crushed red pepper flakes to the adults bowls when it's finished. Amazing. My favorite soup. Very forgiving with mixing things up as needed.

My daughter is pretty picky about food, in general, and she loves it!  The rest of my family thinks it is amazing!  Our local store was out of spicy Italian sausage so I used Cajun Andouille sausage, instead.  I also added Kale and an extra 1/4 cup of evaporated milk.

I’ve made this soup a few times and it’s one I always come back too.  This soup is extremely tasty and the perfect amount of kick to it.  No need to change anything.

This is a go-to soup for us as it's very light but filling. We typically pair it with some bougie bakery bread to make it pop.

Loved this!! 
Added fresh garlic, cayenne, and Frank's red hot for a little extra "kick". 

Also, substituted Italian sausage for breakfast turkey sausage, and red potatoes instead of russet. 

So good! Will for sure make again!

Absolutely delightful! I was concerned about the lack of herbs and spices in this recipe(especially garlic),  I used Aidelle's Italian Chicken sausage. and decided to adjust the seasonings at the end if needed.  I made a great decision! the recipe was perfect! I didnt even add salt or pepper at the end.   I used Kirkland chicken stock and didn't add anything else.  I used a blender to chop the ingredients after I added the milk and for us, that left just enough texture to really enjoy the different ingredients.   My husband and I loved this recipe on a very rainy night and it will definitely become a regular in my winter cooking repertoire.

This was a HUGE hit with the 9 ladies who came over for a meeting at my home. I doubled the recipe and added two cans of great Northern beans (I drained the liquid first) and I added 1 can of Italian Style diced tomatoes. Several of the ladies said they have made it for their families and everyone has proclaimed it delicious!

I've made this recipe several times now and it is SO GOOD!  It's very easy to modify a little here and there to your tastes.  I use one pound of spicy Italian sausage and 3 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth and fill one of those cans with water and dump that in too to make it brothier because the broth is delish.  I also chop up a few carrots and saute them with the onion and add 5-6 chopped garlic cloves.  I add a whole big bag of baby spinach and use half and half instead of the evaporated milk.  I also added in a few shakes of italian spices.  I don't think these are major modifications and this recipe stands strongly on its own.  Make it!

Great recipe. Added half cup of: celery and carrots. Included parsley, basil and garlic. Used four hot spicy Italian sausage and four potatoes. I would recommend draining sausage and onions before adding to soup pot. Thanks for posting.

My family loves this recipe.  The only thing I change is I use Kale and heavy cream instead of the spinach and evaporated milk.  And of course to be like our special restaurant serve it with a salad and bread sticks. :)

I browned Hot sausage (used all 5 links) and onion then added them to the broth and potatoes in a crock pot on high for about 2.5 hours. Followed the instructions adding the rest of the items. I served with crunchy garlic bread and the taste was fantastic, not filling enough for dinner though. I’ll have to add something next or use it as a starter, thank you!

This turned out really well. The only change I made was substituting spinach for kale. We loved the spiciness and creaminess of this soup. It is perfect for cold weather.

We loved it! I made a few changes, I didn’t have evaporated milk so I didn’t add any. I also added a few chick peas and mung beans and then topped it with fresh basil and shredded parmigiana cheese! SO good! Serve with buttered hard rolls!

I loved this soup and so did my family! I made minor changes but I’m sure if I made it as written it would have still been 5 stars. Because I wanted to use all the sausage, I doubled the recipe which also allowed me to use the entire 5 oz. can of evaporated milk. I also switched out spinach for kale since I wanted it to be sturdier. And, I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes but only do this if you like it really spicy.  This soup was easy to make and down-right delicious! It’s a keeper!

I read all reviews, then made the following adjustments:  used turkey sausage, entire five-link pkg, no need to drain fat.  Added 6 qts low sodium chicken broth. When potatoes were soft, added 1 lg can petite diced tomatoes with broth & 1 can drained cannelloni beans per other reviews.  The following are my additions:  Next added 1/2 diced red bell pepper, 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 3 tbsp minced garlic (from a jar) & several heaping handfuls of chopped kale in place of spinach.  I added fresh basil, not sure how much.  Important to note, you can adjust all ingredient amounts per personal taste - it will still be delicious.  Finally, I added 1 cup whole milk at the end, again in place of evaporated milk or cream, as some reviews.  Served with crusty garlic Italian bread, & freshly grated Parmesan cheese, & it was an amazing healthy delicious meal that I will surely make again!!

I'm not usually a recipe-follower but this recipe turned out great. I made some adjustments according to what I had on hand. I excluded the evaporated milk and left it brothy. I also substituted broccoli for spinach. delicious and easy!

To make this similar to a popular Italian food chain, I use kale instead of spinach.  Excellent soup!

This soup is delicious! My husband and I loved it. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used half and half.  I did add garlic (love) and used pre washed spinach (time saver). Will absolutely make this again.... and again.

We didn't care for this soup. I followed the recipe and (to us) it just tasted like sausage without much other flavor.

Nomnom. All 4 kids loved it & hubby. Dinner success. Added parm during sausage cooking and topped after completely done. Also added some minced garlic, about half a tablespoon.  I didn't measure the evaporated milk, put about 1/3 and a dash more. Loved it.

So delicious and nice and simple!  Tastes very similar to the delicious Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden.  I used kale instead of spinach and added garlic increased the proportions on the recipe a bit in order to use all the Italian Sausage I had, but otherwise left the recipe as is.  I will be happily be eating leftovers for a few days.  I might add corn next time since I really enjoy corn in soups.  I think this recipe is very forgiving and could easily be modified to add and subtract ingredients as desired.  I always add salt but this recipe really didn't need it.  It was the perfect level of flavors without adding any other seasoning.  I will be adding this to my standard repertoire and cooking this many times in the future.

I only made two minor changes to the recipe, as this was the first time I made the soup and wanted to see how your recipe tasted before making any major adjustments, if any at all.  Instead of using ground sausage, I used linked, turkey sausage cut into quarter-sized pieces.  Instead of spinach, I substituted kale, which needs a little extra cooking time, so add it earlier.  I doubt that either change made a significant difference to the final product.  The soup was very tasty!  Thank you.

I used this recipe as a base to build upon. It was a great start to an excellent meal! I was very happy with how it ended up tasting.

I am such a vegetable junkie and am always looking for new vegetables to add to my meals. I added in the diced tomatoes that other people suggested and I also added chopped carrots. I probably would have added celery too if I had any. 

I also added some crumbled bacon because I love that smoky flavor of bacon in soups like this. The parmesan that other people suggested was added too. 

This is a completely side note, but I was dead set on making this for dinner when I realized I didn't have any sausage on me!! But I looked up a recipe on how to make ground beef taste like Italian sausage. I added the blogger's link below. I couldn't even tell it was beef! My husband couldn't either and I didn't mention it to him.  

Overall a great soup recipe and I would recommend it.

Delicious! Made this in a slow cooker. I mistook and got a package of mild sausages so added some red pepper flakes. I didn't have the evaporated milk so used lactaid whole milk instead. After I threw in frozen spinach, it got that iron bitter taste which my hubby hates so I added a pinch of sugar. We both gobbled it up! Thanks!

Was absolutely delicious, with a few changes. One of the besy soups I've ever made. I used 4.5 links of hot italian sausage, added 1 clove of minced garlic after the onion and sausage cooked a little in the pan,  used Kale (much better than spinach, just make sure not to cook the stems in the soup). I also used a little more than 1/4 cup of half and half, instead of evap milk. I thinly sliced my russet potatoes instead of cubed, and added grated parmesan on top in each bowl at the very end. Served with garlic bread and a nice crisp salad, and it was an amazing meal!

This soup is super easy and super tasty.  I have made it twice.  I used turkey sausage both times and added extra spinach.  There was no need to add extra salt to taste it first before you add any.  I'll definitely make it again.

"If you are trying to cut fat, remove meat from pan, place in a colander, and rinse under cold water."
If you use cold water, it will just harden the fat and cool off the meat. If you use warm water the grease will go down your drain; not an acceptable practice.

I used low sodium Chicken broth and needed to add a little salt to the broth. I also topped the soup in the bowl with crumpled bacon which I saw on an Olive Garden recipe which was excellent. I boiled the potatoes as directed for 30 minutes which made them a little softer than I expected (the boiling  time depends on how small you cube the potatoes and what kind of potatoes you use, I'm sure) but this also made the soup a little thicker/creamier. I used russet potatoes. I also used HOT Italian sausage and it wasn't too spicy. I added pepper. Tasted great as expected. Some may prefer a little more seasoning. Others have used plain water and chicken bouillon. I also would not cook the sausage too long. It will also boil in the broth an additional 30 minutes.

Made this soup with a few modifications to the recipe and it turned out super yummy! I added a few cherry tomatoes, halved, some white butter beans ( Goya canned), and some thyme for seasoning. I used kale instead of spinach cuz they hold up more nicely in the soup, when the soup is ready I added some cilantro to give it more aroma. It was fantastic!

I made the Cheater's Version: used a box of dried scalloped potatoes and half a bag table-ready chopped kale salad, added white beans, soaked 1 tsp fennel seeds in some boiling water and added just the water to the soup to boost the sausage flavor.  The sauce packet from the scalloped potatoes gave the soup the creamy texture needed; I used 2% milk instead of evaporated and finished it with a little white wine and parmesan cheese.  Will make it again.

I made it according to recipe exactly but the very end of cooking I threw in some shredded parmesan cheese. I added a small amount of Italian seasoning, garlic salt and garlic powder to the meat as I browned it, but that's because I wasn't impressed with the sausage I bought so I added some love. This recipe is so delicious and my whole family loves it! We paired it with salad and our dinner tonight was complete :) we even gave a bunch to our neighbors because I made a huge pot with 5 links, 5 potatoes and a big bunch of spinach. I also use "better than boullion" to make the broth with 16 cups of water. I could have added more potatoes but I didn't want to over do it. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent. I read through a bunch of reviews and was able to get rid of a few extra things in my cupboard and freezer based on other commenters. Thank you! This recipe is versatile and forgiving. I used ground sausage--a couple bits I had leftover in the freezer, a Parmesan rind, kale instead of spinach, and a few cloves of garlic.

I made my own spicy sausage using chicken using Emeril Lagasse's recipe-this cuts calories, fat and sodium. I made an 8 serving portion size and just threw the whole can of evaporated milk in there. I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never tasted Tuscan Soup-this was amazing, even my kids loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe! :-)

Loved it! Very similar to a soup Olive Garden has. I didn't use the evaporated milk. I used the ground spicy Italian sausage instead of the links. I'm a big fan of garlic to I added one smashed clove of garlic when I cooked the onions. My mother in law loved it. She is hard to impress.

I have made this multiple times for both family and work gatherings. I use kale instead of spinach. I always use red potatoes but that is just a personal preference. I have received multiple compliments on this soup. In fact at my work function I had one employee yell out "who made the soup, it is delicious." I then had to run and get a bowl before it was gone.

Super pleased. I added white kidney beans for texture as well as some basil and Italian seasoning. I'd also encourage anyone who makes this for the first time to experiment a little with the amount of chicken stock this recipe calls for. I used about half the suggested amount along with the evaporated milk to the specs of the recipe and the finished product was this beautiful texture, almost gnocchi-esque. I'll be making this again super soon. In the meantime I'll be standing over the pot with a spoon and the fridge open. :)

I had leftover chicken sausage so I decided to make this recipe.  It required minimal seasoning and turned out great. The kids actually ate it. I can see using this soup as a base and substituting the protein however way you like. Clams would go well with it.

DELICIOUS!!!!!  I omitted the potatoes and milk and added pasta. Also, like the other reviews, I added fresh herbs (thyme, oregano & basil).  if you add salt, you have to take it easy because its seasoned perfectly with hot Italian sausages. Next time I will add the milk.

I did not have spicy Italian sausage on hand (just mild sausage), so I added this to the mix: 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and a bay leaf.  Also, to keep the milk from curdling, add the milk with the spinach in the last half-hour of cook. I doubled the recipe and it was a good thing as my husband kept going back for more.

I really liked this soup and will definitely make it again. I used a half pound of Italian sweet sausage, a whole cup of evaporated milk, 8 ounces of broth, and a package of baby spinach. I also garnished with greater parmesan.

I made is minus the spinach or kale and I love it just as much. I did add a little minced garlic will cooking the onions with the meat. I make a big pot and freeze most of it so I can take it to work for lunches and eat it up in a mini crock pot.

Love this easy recipe.  I took advice from other ratings, and added the white beans, 3 garlic cloves, parmesan cheese to the broth, and used a full can of evaporated milk.  I used broth from a chicken I roasted which had seasonings in it.  Turned out excellent.

Ok, so what I made was not the recipe, but paralleled it.  It was so delicious that my picky little boys gobbled it up.  Cubed the potato, drizzled in olive oil, fresh oregano, and S&P.  Roasted it in oven until brown.  Combined this with browned breakfast sausage, chopped Swiss chard, vegetable broth, and carrot chunks.  When all was heated through, mixed in about 3/4 c of sour cream.  Everyone dumped a load of parmesan on their soup.

This was really good and really easy!  I used turkey sausage to keep the fat and calories down a bit.  The spicy sausage really seasoned the broth nicely.  I also used bagged baby spinach to keep things simple.  I followed the recipe very closely but did add a can of navy beans.  The evaporated milk at the end made it creamy without adding the extra calories that cream would.  Will definitely make this one again.  MNBarb.

Woke up to a chilly morning and decided to make this soup - yummy! I haven't even added the evaporated milk yet and it's delicious. We had mild Italian sausage and we like our soup with a kick - so I added about a pinch or two of red pepper flakes and white pepper, about 1/8th teaspoon of thyme and basil, a whole bay leaf, one thinly sliced carrot and about three tablespoon of shredded Romano cheese into the soup while it was simmering. This is definitely a keeper and will be rotated into our favorite recipes.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This gets 4 stars because it's off just a little. First it needs a little chopped bacon, and it's made with kale not spinach. I add half and half, not canned milk. Go to your butcher in the back of most grocers and have them wrap up how ever many links you need. Some stores will even take them out of the casing for you. This soup is super easy and it's one of my go to meals when I need a quick easy meal. Everyone always loves it including my 6 year old. Of course when I make it for her, I use sweet Italian sausage.

I made this in the crockpot. Browned the meat, onions and garlic with some bacon (because why not!). Added everything but the evaporated milk and spinach into the crockpot on low. Added the rest about 20 min before served. It was so delicious! I'm currently living in Germany and miss Olive Garden so much! I think this might actually be better than theirs.

I love this recipe! Super easy, super delicious! I left out the milk, simply didn't think it needed it. Great recipe if you're short on time and need something tasty and filling. Also wonderful with lime tortilla chips :)

Great recipe! I sautéed onions garlic and the red potatoes first in olive oil then added the sausage and some white wine. After the sausage was cooked I added salt, pepper, red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and oregano. I then added 32oz of organic chicken broth and let that simmer for an hour and added the evaporated milk and served. It was delicious!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  Changes I made:  added cubed chicken, oregano, basil and pepper to the sausage (i used spicy chicken and turkey sausage - 4 links).  I added 6+ cups chicken broth.  I added mini-farfalle noodles.  I hadn't considered that the noodles would suck up the chicken broth. So, there wasn't a lot of broth at the end.  I wold add more broth next time.  It was delicous though!  Just the right amount of zing (and I did not add cayenne or crushed red pepper).  I also added shaved parmesan cheese to our bowls when served.  It was perfect for a cold, winter night!

I have made this recipe countless times, and minus my son who thinks he doesn't like sausage, everyone always loves it. I do make it pretty much as written, however, I use bagged baby spinach and I just throw in the whole bag, I use all 5 spicy sausages that come in the package, and I just put potatoes in until it looks like the right amount.

This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper for me!!!! I used heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk and red potatoes in place of regular potatoes. I added some carrots that I needed to get rid of which I thought was a nice addition. I wasn't sure if this soup was going to be filling but to my surprise it truly was!!!!!!!

While looking for something new I stumbled on this recipe. This dish is super easy and fast and very good even though I didn't have all of the ingredients and didn't want to go out in the cold to the store. First I changed the serving size for just the 2 of us.   I didn't have the sausage so just used my ground beef standby.  Only had one can of chicken broth so added water.  Didn't have evaporated milk, so looked up how to substitute and found I could make my own by cooking regular milk low and slow.   Also took others suggestions and added a half a clove of minced garlic, some petite diced tomatoes (a couple of spoonfuls), some Parmesan cheese (not fresh or aged, just regular).  I left out the red pepper flakes while cooking, but my husband and I ended up adding to our bowls and more Parmesan.  Served with garlic bread sticks.  We both went back for seconds.

Fantastic!!  I used 4 chicken sausage links.  My boyfriend prefers a brothy soup, so I didn't add any evaporated milk or cream.  I used 8 cups of broth, and only 2 large russet potatoes.  Per advice from other reviewers, I also added a can of white beans and petite diced tomatoes.  Great change from the soups I usually make, unbelievably yummy!!!

Very good.  Basic recipe is good enough, but I didn't have the Italian sausage, so just used a different type.  Added some hot chili peppers, Italian seasoning,ground black pepper.  1 1/2 cartons of Chicken stock and kale in place of the spinach.  I also added dehydrated hash browns in place of the chunky potatoes.  I added fat free evaporated milk and could not tell any noticeable difference, just less fat.  It is a definitely do over for any night.

This was awesome.  I actually used beef stock, since I had some that was about ready to expire.  I also used a large bunch of Salad Savoy (purple) instead of spinach.  I received it as part of a vegetable co-op I participate in and I didn't know what to do with it.  This was really delicious, and very light.  I did rinse the sausage to get rid of some of the fat.  Amazing!

This is one of the best tasting soups that I ever made!  I followed the recipe for the most part except I had no spicy sausage on hand.  I used 4 patties of Jimmy Dean turkey sausage instead and cut those up and browned them a bit in the pan with the onion and I added a clove of garlic with that, too.  I used fat free low sodium chicken broth.  I didn't need to add any spices at all, not salt, not even the black pepper.  I used a whole bag of Ready Pac baby spinach and chopped that up. I also didn't have any large potatoes so I used a half bag of the small yellow dutch potatoes (skin on) and quartered those. They worked out perfectly b/c they are naturally creamy and they cooked quickly. I wasn't sure about the milk at first, but it doesn't make it creamy, just richer and more substantial. The soup was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful! Taste just like olive gardens. Did not have chicken stock so used bouillon cubes. Also used the full can of  evaporated milk. On the sausage bought a pound of ground Italian sausage. Hubby stated he hates Italian sausage yet he liked it, alot! Will make again. Thanks for recipe.

Great recipe! I too made a few changes.  I used sweet Italian sausage and used five links (and 8 cups chicken broth).  When I was cooking the sausage I added some herbs de provence and garlic salt.  After the potatoes were almost cooked I added cannelloni beans.  I also chopped a bundle of fresh basil and added it with the spinach. My fiance and I thought it was quite delicious!

Great soup. 4 stars b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly but took the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic, white beans, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese. I also subbed kale for spinach. It was so good! Made it in the crock pot.

Very good! I used cream instead of evaporated milk, cannellini beans instead of potatoes, and I added white wine, diced tomatoes and lots of garlic. The soup was delicious, and even better the next day when the flavors had blended more.

I tried this recipe today with slight substitutions. I chose it because we are in a remote location & this one with evaporated milk RATHER than heavy cream worked. I had Roasted Red Pepper & Spinach Chicken Sausage which I used in place of the Italian Sausage & left out the fresh spinach (which we did not have on hand.) I used less 1/2 cup less chicken broth & then used a small (5oz) evaporated milk. I will try it next time with the fresh spinach or kale be used. According to the spices one adds I thought this was very close to the potato & sausage soup at a Name Brand Restaurant, famous for their soup & salad. Loved it.

I;m making this again tonight. I am following the advice of others, and rinsing the sausage after I cook it, and using kale instead of spinach. I am using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evaporated milk, and adding a few extra fennel seeds. Good recipe!

This was great!  :-)  I did add a can of cannelloni beans and about a cup of evaporated milk.  I bought the hot Italian sausage which I usually can't deal with, but it made the soup very tasty!   Thanks so much for a great recipe!  I'll be trying this again!

I cannot tell you enough how wonderful this soup is!!  I didn't even have all the ingredients on hand (was short on chicken broth, so I used 2.5c broth and 2.5c water, then threw in two bouillon cubes; didn't have potatoes so substituted frozen broccoli florets).  I also used mild Italian sausage, sprinkled it with a bit of red pepper, and it was perfect.  As per other reviewers' suggestions, I added a full cup of evaporated milk to thicken the broth a bit.  Simply delicious!!  Full of all kinds of flavors!  It did not even require any additional salt or pepper (likely due to the fact that the bouillon cubes contain quite a bit of salt).    Simply delicious, and SUPER easy to make...anyone could make this delicious dish!

I made this recipe following the directions exactly except i added some garlic to the sausage. and it was very good! I think next time I will try it with Kale because i think it might holds its texture a little better when reheated. I would also add the whole can of cream for a more creamy base. But over all it was delicious!

I wound up using 2 of the 3 taters, which was perfect.  Also, I bought a "tube" of ground low-fat breakfast sausage and it was SO GOOD!    I have to admit I was hesitant about this recipe because the ingredients are so simple & few but the results were so flavorful and both my husband and I were in heaven, which is rare to occur during the same dish, lol.  This is being added to my regular arsenal.

Loved this! My only changes were no salt (not necessary), used a box of frozen spinach (heated up first and added at the end), and threw in a can of drained cannellini beans. My 8 year old brought it for lunch and loved it, though only one kid would sit with her due to the spinach. Ugh.

Hands down THE best soup I have ever made! I added a lot more spinach and a whole can of condensed milk, and it was practically perfect! The only change I would make in the future would be to drain the sausage after browning as it was a little greasy on the top. Once it cooled I just skimmed a bit off the top and it was heaven! I cooked this tasty soup up in my dutch oven on the stovetop. Wonderful!

This was a solid "okay".  If I could have, I would have given it 3.5 stars - a little more than average, not quite worthy of 4 stars but I rounded up because, although they didn't rave about it and nobody wanted seconds, the kids did eat it.  It wasn't bad - just nothing fantastic.  Looks much tastier in the picture than in real life.  Made it just as written.  Not planning on making it again though.

GREAT! I made it for the boyfriend and he was super impressed. But one thing I will keep in mind is to put the sausages in AFTER the potatoes are done cooking because I realized how much they stiffen up through the cooking.   I modified this recipe a bit by adding a can of diced tomatoes with a can of kidney beans once the potatoes were done. The evaporated milk is nice to get it that authentic, Tuscan look.  I served this with a soursough loaf and we were both very pleased with the outcome. The portions

Great soup. I used spicy sausage and added a can of diced tomatoes and white beans. Served with crusty french bread and Parmesan. The hubby gave it 2 thumbs up!

This soup was amazing!  I followed all directions and added great northern beans, garlic and diced tomatoes and we loved it!  Definitely spicy sausage a must!  My only suggestion is to drain the sausage before you add the other ingrediants, this way you keep the oil out of your soup. Enjoy!

This is an excellent recipe. My husband doesn't like spinach so I substitute arugula.  I also use a mix of chicken sausage and italian sausage. I've served this to company, taken it to the sick, and serve it at home. Always a hit!!

This soup has excellent flavor to have so few ingredients!  The only changes I made were as follows:  I used turkey sausage, reduced sodium chicken broth and added 2 cloves of minced garlic when sauteeing the sausage and onions.  Great!

I used basil chicken sausages and the recipe was just okay, I imagine if I used spicy sausages, it would've been better. Will definitely try recipe out with spicy sausages next time.

I really loved this recipe; my husband wasn't so ecstatic - hence the compromise in rating.  It was not too spicy and the creaminess toned down the spice of the sausage.  I will make this again for sure!  Thanks.

Loved it. From the suggestions I added cannelini beans and a can of diced tomatoes. Also had some summer squash lying around so threw that in too. I'm guessing it'd be great with almost any veggies!

This was wonderful! It tastes just like the spicy saugage soup served at Olive Garden. It didn't taste as good the next day because of the spinach but it was DELICIOUS the night I made it!!

I gave this recipe a five on behalf of my husband, who absolutely LOVES it...but I myself do not care for the italian sausage taste. (Personal preference, though.) It really does taste like the soup from Olive Garden, as others have stated. I didn't add or change anything, and we liked it just fine.

The family loved this soup.  Try using 1/2 mild and 1/2 hot sausage if you don't like a lot of heat.  Also we use half and half instead of evaporated milk.  Toss in fresh garlic.  Add some orzo for a little more substance.

This is sure to be a keeper. I didn't have Italian sausage but, did have a small amount of breakfast sausage (Jimmy Dean) and turkey kielbasa. In my pantry I had small egg noodles and substituted this for the potatoes.  Other then this I followed the recipe and all I can say is m-m-m-m-m. I got rid of leftovers but, next time will use the spicy Italian sausage.  Thank you for the recipe!

What an INCREDIBLE recipie - it tastes just like our favorite restaurant makes it! This is so easy even my hubby - who is NOT a chef - can make it! We use Jimmy Dean Spicy sausage (the 16 oz tube) and cook it in the stock pot while crumbling it, add 8 cups of chicken broth, as many potatoes as is your preference and 1/2 - 3/4c evaporated milk. Thanks for this wonderful recipie!

I really liked this and decided to add some ground anise for italian zip-- ground fennel or actual fennel bulb would be a nice addition if no anise.. Thanks for the great recipe-- I beleive actually a version of italian wedding soup.

Very Good!!! I used polish sausage and added Italian seasoning and a box of frozen spinach (chopped) cooked in micro and drained.  And 1/2 cup of fat free half & half. Very flavorful!!

This is just wonderful!  I did use sweet sausage and added just a little crushed red pepper as I am feeding some seniors who prefer less spice.  My 16 yr old daughter loved it even though it has spinach.  A winning recipe in my collection.  Thank you.

This recipe was awsome!  It reminded me so much of my favorite soup that I always order in one of the famous italian restaurant chains!  My family absolutely loved it!  I kicked it up a little bit by adding shredded parmesean cheese on top.  Try it - - it is really good!

I tried this soup and it came out amazing. Instead of hot sausages I used regular sausages and added hot pepper flakes to be able to control the heat. This one is a keeper

An easy recipe to put together for a family supper.  I used about 6 sausages instead of the three requested, and I added some extra seasoning as well.  Served the soup with homemade cornmeal muffins.

Really good soup. I am going to add fresh garlic when I cook the onion and use lower fat turkey sausage next time. It was a great way to use the spinach I had. I used half the recommended amount of chicken broth and substituted water for the rest.

I'm add ing my 5 stars to the list.  I love this stuff!  It's always perfect on a cold winter day.  I prefer the mild sausage and that's such an easy substitution.  Enjoy!

Soooo yummy.  Made a creamier, vegetarian version using the following changes:  To the onion, I added 2 chopped leeks (I needed to use them up), and 2 minced cloves of garlic.  Used 6 Boca veggie Italian sausages, thawed in microwave, sliced into small pieces and browned with onion/leeks/garlic.  Used veggie broth instead of chicken, and added 1 cup white wine, 1 cup cream. Since the veggie sausage wasn't spicy, I added 1 tsp each of crushed red pepper, crushed jalapeno, and spicy paprika. Once all the ingredients were finally cooking together, I used a hand blender to cream about a third of the solids in the pot; this created a creamy soup that was still fairly chunky.  Then I let it simmer an extra 30 minutes.  My carnivore husband couldn't get enough of it!

This recipe is great.  I had to make a few changes though due to ingredient availability.  I substituted: (1)11 oz. baby spinach chopped instead of 1 bunch; (2)1/2 cup lite sour cream instead of evaporated milk, and (3)1 link or 8 oz. of Boudain instead of Italian sausage.  Even with my substitutions, the soup turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make again!

This turned out great.  Very tasty & I will make it again.  I followed the recipe very closely.  I used Knorr chicken bullion & water, Italian sausage I had in the freezer, & chopped the potatoes to the size I'd want on my spoon. My sausage was much spicier than I remember buying which was a plus to the over 16's.  I had to pick up kids after adding the potatoes, so I simmered it on low an hour or more.  The evap. milk was a nice touch, and improved the color.  I don't think it's intended to make it creamy.

Loved it!  I used ground Italian sausage instead of links and additional potatoes and broth to increase the servings for a larger crowd.  It's good both with and without evaporated milk (I use fat free).  Definitely a winter time staple!

Excellent..  I did not add the evaporated milk but did end up crushing some of the potatoes as someone suggested.  I also had about 3/4 of a cup of egg noodles left in a bag so I dumped those in too.  I have just had 2 bowls and still licking my lips..  =)Make sure to drain the sausage..

I have made this twice now, once without the evaporated milk, and once with.  They were delicious both ways.  I also used one whole package of sausage, which is about 5 links, and the extra meat was nice.  I haven't had the soup at the Olive Garden, but I don't think that I will ever need to order it after this recipe!

This was good, certainly didn't have the wow factor, but nevertheless a decent soup.  We thought it could use some chopped carrot, so the next time, I will make that addition and see if that changes things.

This was pretty good, added some leftover pinto beans to soup as well.
I didn't enjoy it as much when I ate it the next day; flavors had blended too much. Will make again, easy to prepare; thanks.

This is one of the best recipes I have come across.  I don't love to cook and who has time these days.  It is SO EASY, makes a large amount and freezes well.  It's a staple in our house since we often work opposite hours.  It's a rather healthy and very hearty meal to have out of the freezer for us.  Love, love, love it!!

This is delicious!  A great soup for a quick warmup.  I really like the greens mixed in with the broth.  It give a unique taste to the soup.

Wonderful.  Used spicy Italian Sausage and it was a bit to spicy for 2 of my 3 kids.  But my husband, 12 year old and I loved it.  Next time I'll try regular Italian sausage.

Wow.  The only thing I did was double the recipe (big family, plus I wanted to make enough for taking to work this week) and added a few sprinkles of red pepper falkes.  Even my THREE year old liked it.  This really tastes good!  I will add it to my biweekly rotation!

So tasty!  I used a roll of bulk hot sausage from the refrigerated section instead of links and subbed Yukon Golds instead of large potatoes.  To make the soup look more like the one from Olive Garden, I use smallish Golds and cut them twice lengthwise. Then I slice each wedge thinly and add this to the soup.  That way I'm not eating big chunks of potato and I think that it cooks faster too.  I also used a bag of pre-washed spinach and just sliced it and added just enough to bring some green to the soup.  I think that a whole bunch would have been much for me. This soup is spicy with the hot sausage, but since there are really few ingredients in the soup, I think that the hot sausage is a must!

Good soup.  It was fairly close to Olive Garden's Zoupa Tuscana.  I used the recipe for "Italian Style Sausage" to make turkey sausage for the soup.  We ate the whole pot.

I am not a big Italian sausage fan and I liked the soup.  My husband LOVED it.  I recommend you don't make it too far ahead of time.  Your potatoes really break down.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  We will keep it in mind the next time we have guests over.  I changed the recipe just a bit by adding shallots.  I also used 5 sausage links instead of 3 and increased the broth to 8 cups plus a little water.

One of the reasons I love going to Olive Garden is for their Tuscan Soup. This taste's JUST like it. I LOVE  this soup. Fortunately there are other reasons to go to Olive Garden, or I would just sit home eating this soup!

I enjoyed this recipe, but found is not quite spicy enough. I wonder if it because I rinced the meat to get rid of some of the fat as another user suggested. I'll try it again.

This recipe was Fantastic! It tasted like the real Zuppa Tuscana from Olive Garden! The only thing I changed was the spinach. I used kale instead. Add a little to the cooking time if you do so. My kids and husband loved it!

I wasn't to sure about this soup but decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised, it was great!  I did make a few small changes. I used 4 links of sausage, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1 bunch of kale instead of spinach and only two potatoes.  This soup was hearty and delicious.  Yum!

I'll add to all the other positive reviews.  This was fantastic!! Also one of the easiest soups I have made.  The flavor was so good and all we had with it was a loaf of crispy bread.  Thank you Diane.

This was really tasty. I used Italian Hot Turkey sausage. It took no time at all to prepare. My husband loved it and even brought it to work for lunch one day. Would definitely make it again.

SO GOOOOOD!!! What a wonderful flavor! Next time I'll double it (for  some leftovers).  As others, I added some oregano, garlic, and northern beans. I think the beans added a lot. I also added a chicken breast and carrot to make it a little more filling. Topped it with some parmesan cheese and served it with a mixed green salad and parmesan/ garlic bread. Mmmmmm.... Thanks!

I didn't have any spinach on hand, so I used some other veggies for color... and also added some pasta, so it was more of a casserole. Overall it was awesome, and it was something my husband liked, so it is definitely something I will make again and again!

Great soup.  I made it exactly per the recipe.  I expected it to be a little creamier, but was not disappointed.  I used spicy italian sausange and I felt it had a lot of flavor.  Will make this again.

Just had this recipe tonight.  I give it 5 stars because it was quick and easy and tasted great.  It reminded me of the soup you get at Olive Garden.  I only had regular Italian sausage, so I spiced it up with some red pepper flakes while I was browning the sausage.

My husband and I and our houseguest enjoyed this soup enormously.  The only change I made was using half & half instead of evaporated milk.  The soup is quick and easy to make, using one pot, and the portions are generous.  I highly recommend this for a cold, damp winter day.  Thank you,Dianne

It was neat to see how it all comes together and is very similar to the Olive Garden Soup. I had to play with the spices quite a bit though to get them to be recognizeable at all when I tasted it. I did add red pepper flakes and that helped a bit. The potatoes were bland and could use some of their own personal attention before being added to the pot, BUT, even with all that said, it was a good soup and I will be making it again, just with a different approach. Hot, crusty bread goes great with it as well!

This was actually really good, minus the spinach.  The only thing my family added was a pinch of chili powder to their bowl.  I dont know what Olive Gardens soup tastes like, but this was a good side dish.

Both of us enjoyed this soup.  I didn't have evaporated milk so just used a 1/2 cup milk.  Turned out great.  Have been looking for a soup like this, and this is the best I've found.

This is truly AWSOME!! I didn't have spicy sausage so I added crushed pepper flakes to regular pork sausage, and also I had accidentally picked up Italian seasoned chicken broth but it turned out fabulously!!! My husband said it was better than Olive Gardens and even my two year old loves it!! You can't go wrong!!

Great, similar to OG and quick! We like to:  Add a clove of minced garlic to the onions, use sliced small potatoes and add a can of cannellini beans.  Gotta top with grated parmesan.  My kids aren't fond of spinach, so we warm up frozen spinach and add it to individual bowls before serving.

I made this recipe as-is as an appetizer for an italian-themed dinner party and everyone really liked it, but I thought it was lacking a little something. The next day, I had a little leftover and I sprinkled on some parmesan and extra pepper and it was excellent! Next time, I would deffinately add parmesan from the start.

This soup is so good, I made a small batch first, then it was eaten up immediately so I made another big batch the next day!  Definitely rinse the sausage, it was still a tad greasy even with that.  I like mine extra spicy, so I added lots of pepper.

very good-I sliced the potatoes in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4" slices.  I also stacked the spinach leaves and sliced them similarly.  I also reccomend rinsing the sausage, this makes for a less seperated soup.  Soup was very good, very simple.  Will use this one again.

Very good.....I did make a few changes. First, I used 5 links of hot turkey sausage, added 2 cloves of garlic, a can of petite diced tomatoes in their juice, used a frozen box of spinach, and used about 2 c. of frozen O'brian potatoes in this soup. It was excellent! A little quicker with the frozen veggies, and healither with the turkey sausage. Will make again soon!

Yuuuuuuummmmmm...I used turkey sausage. Also, I didn't have evaporated milk on hand so I replaced it with 1/4 c. of whole milk and added some flour to make sure it turned out thick enough. It's probably a bit healthier this way, so I won't try the evaporated milk - it tasted great and I don't want to get addicted to the ev. milk. :) Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Wow, this is fantastic!  I used 5 links of Shaw's Supermarket brand Hot Italian Chicken Sausages cut in quarters.  I added more evap. milk than called for...used one can of low fat chicken broth, 4 cups water and two chicken boullion cubes because the pantry needs restocking!  I added one canned of drained cannelini beans, and shredded 6 baby carrots.  I also added 2 cloves garlic and fresh grated parmesan. This smelled so wonderful while cooking, and I just couldn't stop taste-testing it!  I can't wait to make it again, but I'll double it for leftovers or for a crowd.

Great soup - quick and incredibly flavorful.  I added a can of small, white beans - seemed like the perfect touch.  Use low-salt broth if using canned - it was a little salty. Next time I might vary it a little by not using the spinach and adding some sauteed fresh mushrooms.  I brought it to work and a co-worker who ate SIX cups in one sitting!

I followed the suggestions of others and added garlic, carrot and a can of white cannelini beans. I also used baby spinach and didn't bother to chop.

The result is a hearty,tasty, nutritious soup that is very easy to make.

This is a fabulous recipe. I took other reviewer's advice and substituted evaporated milk and used fat free half and half. Also, added 1/2 can of white kidney beans in lieu of one potato. Added a couple of cloves of garlic for a little extra flavor and simmered with a chunk of parmesano reggiano. As good as or better than OG's! Will be making this again. Thank you Dianne for this great recipe.

One Word, FABULOUS!!!  The only thing that I altered was, I took someone's advice and added a little more of the ev. milk and I do know that OG uses Kale, not spinach in there recipe, so I used 1/2 box of frozen kale and it came out perfect!  Thanks for posting!  A definte keeper!

This turned out great, but I had to substitute some ingredients because of what I had on hand. I used some frozen mashed potatoes (about a half a bag)and added a bad of 'winter mix (cauliflower and broccoli)' frozen veggies instead of the spinach. Quite a change to the recipe, I know, but I kept the rest of the ingredients and followed the directions. It was very hearty and delicious! Thanks Diane! My family loved it!

Potatoes, italian sausage, spiniach, and chicken broth make for an out of the ordinary recipe.  I'm warming up leftovers now!  Give this a chance.  My only complaintsuggestion is that the recipe asks you to "crumble" the sausage.  You don't "crumble" raw sausage, but, after cooking this dish I do suggest that you "crumble" the sausage as much as possible.  Big clumps of sausage take away from the dish.

My family loves this soup.  We no longer use pork products so I substituted Turkey italian sausage and a little fennel seed, I sliced the potatoes in maybe 1/4 inch thick slices instead of cubes and used chopped Kale because my husband does not each spinach.  This was so awesome. Great for a cold day meal served with a good salad and garlic bread.

I wasn't sure I was going to like this soup when I was making it - boy, was I ever surprised!  I used regular Italian links instead of spicy, since we don't really care for the other, and I cut them into small rounds instead of crumbling them.  Delicious!  Thanks, Dianne!

very delicious, and fast.  great for a weeknight.  i found the hot sausage a little hot for my own taste, but the BF loved it. diced up a lone zucchini i had hangin around.  next time might add cannellini beans as others suggested.   and used heavy cream as i like a thicker soup.

I made this soup as directed with a change in the sausage.  I wanted a more meatier soup so I used a whole "roll" of Bob Evans Spicy ground sausage.  It was fabulous.  I cant imagine eating it with just a little as the recipe calls for.  I served with french bread.  Magnifico!

I enjoyed this so much I made it twice on the weekend. Do use fresh spinach.  I also used Spicy Pork and Red Pepper sausages which were on special at my local supermarket and they were superb.  I also used a tin of cannellini beans. This is definately in my top ten of soups.

Wow! This was great!! Everyone loved it. My dad had 4 bowls!! IT was too easy. Like some others, I thought that the simple ingredients equated to lack of flavor, boy was I wrong! I will be making this again and again. Thanks!!

Another keeper. The only alteration I made was adding about 1 tablespoon fennel seeds while the soup was simmering.  (Enhances the Italian flavor.) If you like full flavored comfort food, double the recipe - you're going to want another bowl tomorrow and the day after that too!!!

This was a very good soup. Next time I am going to try adding the parm. cheese as suggested in another review. Also, I might try this with linguica or chourico, as I am not a huge fan of sausage in soups. But the broth was excellent and the spinach was really good.

This soup was a big hit for my family and friends. I am not a big fan of spinach but loved it anyway. Wasn't sure how much "2 bunches" of spinach was but would definitely use more next time. Love it! Thanks.

Great recipe.  It's very easy to make and would be perfect for a cold day.  Definately comfort food.  I used sweet sausage for the kids and half and half, and it's perfect for our tastes.

This soup reminded me of the spicy sausage potato soup served at Olive Garden.  It was delicious!  I topped it with shredded parmesan before serving and also used canned chopped spinach since I couldn't find fresh.  A definite keeper.

I loved this and served it over egg noodles but next time I think I will cook the chicken and place to one side then cook other ingredients to form sauce. pour some over noodles and toss, then reheat chicken and drizzle remining sauce over top. I will try to make this healthier next time too. This is a definate keeper  :)
