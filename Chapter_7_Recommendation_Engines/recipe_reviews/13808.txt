Outstanding dish! I used this recipe several times varying is each time. Rave reviews. Multiple requests for the recipe. I put a layer of 1/2 of the mixture in a 8X8 baking dish, then added a layer of egg noodles (about 2 cups, prepared) then the rest of the casserole. I smoothed the ingredients to "seal in" the noodles. Added about a 1/4 cup shredded Jack on the top and baked. Instaed of frozen mixed vegetables, you could use any combination you like, for example, carrots and corn. I'll post the actual recipe I ended up with under "Vegetable and Egg Noodle Casserole."

Good side dish, I used a generic frozen vegetable medley bag and I didn't have cream of mushroom and used cream chicken.  Also added some other spices to spice it up.

This is pretty good. However, something is missing. It needs something additional to it like pasta. I would probably make this again.

I took this casserole to Thanksgiving, where the vegetarians and meat-eaters alike scraped the dish clean.  I used a veggie combination that included potatoes, which was a very nice addition.  I used Jack and Cheddar, and that worked out just fine.

This was a last minute addition to Christmas dinner. It was good, but not spectacular.  I think using fresh vegetables would make it tastier.

After reading that other people thought this recipe was too bland, I added about 3 Tbsp of minced garlic. I also found that I didn't have any Colby-Jack Cheese, so I used Cheddar and Mozzeralla. The dish came out WONDERFULLY and excessively yummy. Still not a lot of kick in the spice department, but yummy. We'll do this one again, maybe next time we have a potluck somewhere.

I took the suggestion of adding some cubed hash browns; I used cheddar cheese, since I had that; opted out on the water chestnuts; omitted the salt and pepper, since the soup is fairly salty. Brought to Christmas Eve and received a lot of positive feedback. Good for a large crowd and will definitely make again. May add chopped and sauteed onion and skip the french-fried onions altogether.

The flavor is nice if you use good quality ingredients, but IMO this needs some noodles and some chicken.  These things would bring my rating up to 4 stars.

It was a really good recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I used 1can of cream of mushroom &1 can of cream of celery.  I also added partially thawed Orida frozen crinkle cut fries, roughly 1cup.  It turned out better than I had anticipated.  My husband really enjoyed it!

I really like this recipe and have used it many times. I have varied the mixed veggies and it seems to have better flavor when I select veggies with peppers in it. It has replaced the traditional Green Bean Casserole on my holiday table to rave reviews!
