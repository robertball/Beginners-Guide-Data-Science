This is my recipe and it was changed by Allrecipes after submission. You need to use course ground dijon mustard. I have never tried regular dijon so I don't know how well that would go. Also, just heat up the grill, don't worry about one side being high and the other medium. I never submitted that.  This is one of those recipes that you can just eyeball how much blue cheese and onions you want on each filet.

I rarely cook, but when I do I go out to make a great impression. I decided to use this recipe as a "makeup" dinner after an argument with my long-term girlfriend. Was it a hit? It was a home run, touch down, goal and swoosh all in one. I have often spent well over $100.00 for meals that couldn't touch this one with a ten foot pole. Five stars is not enough!!! I served this with green beans with onions, mushrooms and a light cream sauce and a fully loaded baked potato.

I made this for valentines day dinner for my husband, and we both agreed, this was the BEST steak I have ever fixed!!  The marinade was really flavorful! Like some of the others, I used goat cheese instead of blue cheese and it was supberb!! I actually made this on my cast iron indoor grill and put it in my oven broiler to melt the cheese and it turned out great. I will definately be making this again and would highly recommend this to anyone to try.. It was extremely easy too!!

Yum!!!  Cooks up great in a pan on the stove as well.  Cooked the steak until nearly done, then added the onions into the same skillet to caramelize.  Heaped them on top of the steak along with the cheese just long enough for the cheese to melt, and it turned out fantastic!

This is the first review I have ever put on this site, and I had to because this was sooooo good!!!  These were the best steaks that we have ever eaten.  My husband raved as well. I followed the recipe exactly except for used mozzerella cheese instead of blue cheese (what I had on hand.) We will definetly make these again and again!!

This is the Best Recipe ever!!  My mom found this recipe on this board in the summer and we both have made it for all the dinner parties we have had in the past 4 months.  Everyone loves it; even the people that don't care for blue cheese (try using a milder blue cheese for those people).  Also we have used various cuts of steak - you don't have to use the expensive cut of filet mignon.

My husband and I love love the classic burgundy wine sauces that accompany our filet mignons. This was a nice change and very interesting. I wrapped my 2inch thick filets with bacon. I then took 4 oz of feta (we don't like blue cheese) and mashed it with 2TBS of softened butter to make a paste. We like our filets medium rare so I broiled them 4 minutes on each side. At the last 2 minutes I put the cheese spread on and continued broiling until  it was bubbly and melted. Delicious! NOTE: it's important that while you are marinating these to leave them at room temperature. Filets should be allowed to rest at room temperature 30-60 minutes prior to cooking. This will ensure a juicy steak.

This was a great twist to an old favorite. Turns out the Dijon works just fine, but I will try the course dijon next time and compare. Used splenda to carmelize my onions rather than sugar and could tell no difference. May wrap the outside of the filets in bacon next time as well...BAM!!!

Great!  The only thing I did different was use brown sugar instead of the white, red wine instead of the vinegar, and mixed the blue cheese with cream cheese.

This was an excellent recipe. I'm not a huge blue cheese fan, but it mixes well with the other flavours and isn't too overpowering.

I didn't care for the taste that the marinade gave my filets...was disappointing, especially after reading all the good reviews. As always, thanks for sharing but I won't make this again.

The only changes I made were 1) r/f gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, a little less; 2) regular Dijon instead of course grainy dijon; smart balance instead of butter; cooked as directed but used indoor grill pan on high heat, 3-4 mins per side for med-rare. This has potential to be 5 stars if I correct my technique. Would prob cook on outdoor grill next time. . . smoked out my house and steak is just so good on grill! Would cook a little longer at med-high instead. The marinade and caramelized onions made this. . . great dish! Thanks!

Very good. I substituted feta for the bleu cheese only because that is what I had on hand. It was excellent with the feta.

This was great, I grilled the filets on a grill pan in the house and topped with brie instead of blue cheese.  I served the filets on top of 2 Ore-Ida hash browns and then put a circle of green beans sauteed with onions around it.  It looked very fancy, but was funny since they were really frozen hash browns.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and he RAVED about it. Living in Chicago, we've had steak at some of the finest restaurants, and he said this rivaled anything else he'd ever had. I must admit, it was one of the tastiest I've ever had. I changed a couple of things tho... I marinated the steak for about an hour and a half I think (turning multiple times), and instead of the blue cheese, I used crumbled gorgonzola. I will make this again and again and again.

These were outstanding!!! I marinated my steaks overnight and was afraid I'd ruined them but was fortunate--the balsamic vinegar was good quality, so it was almost like wine. The real irony here is I'm typically vegetarian, but had a real craving for a good steak. This was it!!

I made this for my boyfriend after a long day at work and it was better than any other $100+ steakhouse dinner in Chicago alongside green beans and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. My boyfriend was unsure if he liked blue cheese but loved it on his filet... definitely a great addition! I will save this for Valentines Day dinners and special occasions to come!

This marinade was DELICIOUS!  It does help to have a great cut of steak too...I followed the recipe as stated and it was moist and flavorful.  I didn't have bleu cheese so used feta in it's place.  My company was wowed by this dish!  Served the grilled onions recipe from this site on top.  Will make again!

Really delicious!  I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese because it's what I had, but think I would prefer the "bite" of the blue cheese even more. Husband loved it, too and I'm sure we'll have the filets again soon.  

Suggestion:  I combined the cheese and onions in a bowl just before adding to the steaks, to give the cheese a head-start in melting.

Most Excellent. I added an 1/8th of a cup of Cabernet to the marinade, otherwise it was, 'as is'. I think it is very important to use a quality blue cheese. This is a good one, for sure.

I had leftover filet that was cut into cubes (leftover from fondue night) and thought this would be a great way to use it up.  The cubes soaked in the marinade very quickly.  The carmelized onions are a must!!!  I didn't have fresh blue cheese, so I tried blue cheese dressing.  Still very delicious.  I am still amazed at how all the flavors worked perfectly together.  I served this up with a standard baked potato for a gourmet weeknight meal - and it was loved by everyone.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I have made this recipe now 4 times and each time I say it's the best steak I've ever had.  Now...I don't go buy the $90 steak at the steakhouse, but I'm not shy about ordering a good piece of meat from a top steakhouse and if you get a good cut of meat from a butcher then it will top just about anything.

Excellent!  I made this for Valentines dinner last night, and now I wish I'd made an extra steak for later.  I didn't have any blue cheese, but the marinade and carmelized onion were full of flavor on their own.  I did use about 2 tablespoons of the leftover marinade in the onions, and reduced it before adding the sugar.  I was able to cut out the butter by using the olive oil in the marinade instead.  Can't wait for an excuse to make this again!

I thought it was very tasty.  My meat lover husband not so much.  But then again he prefers his steak plain with just a little salt and pepper.

LOVED this recipe! My husband boasted that it was the best steak he ever had! Didn't see that coming:) He's had lots of steak! Wonderful display as well! **NOTE** Make sure your steak is at room temperature before grilling to achieve maximum tenderness! I removed the marinated steak from the fridge and let sit for an additional 30 minutes to reach room temp. I highly recommend this recipe!

the flavor was really good, especially the steak came out moist and soft.  the only thing i was too thrill was that it's too oily so i will cut back on the butter and the oil in the marinade.  i didn't really care for the cheese so overall, great steak

Oh, this was wonderful.  My boyfriend always orders steak medallions gorgonzola at our favorite fancy restaurant, and this was almost just like that.  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and everyone thought it was divine.

Fantastic!!! Thought my filets might have been dry as they were in the freezer for awhile.  They melted in your mouth.  No need for any sugar with the onions, just cook slow over very low heat.  They will naturally carmelize. Other than cutting out the sugar and increasing the cook time for onions, followed recipe to the T and enjoyed every bite!!

This was excellent.  I really think the blue cheese made this dish.  I loved the onions, but they were a bit too sweet for me, will try to cook w/o sugar next time.  Other than that, I plan on making this again.

I made this for dinner last night.  After a few bites, my boyfriend muted the TV and said to me, "Baby, this is outstanding.  It's so tender.  It tastes just like the ones in the restaurant.  How did you do that?"  After eating his, he finished mine.  I used 1-inch filets and left them out to marinate.  I pierced each sides with a fork a few times to help the flavors soak in.  I then broiled them 3-4 inches from the heat source, 7 minutes per side.  I put the topping on during the last 2 minutes.    Served them sliced over a romaine salad with sliced red onions, pine nuts, croutons, and blue cheese with balsamic dressing.  Also added the grilled shrimp scampi from this site.  Mmmm.

Awesome recipe!!!  We made it for Valentine's Day dinner and I've been craving it ever since!  I have had this every other night since then!  Yummy!  Instead of filet, we used NY steaks from Costco...

My local grocer didnt have filets, so the butcher talked me into new york strip steaks.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I marinated the steaks for 2 days because I prepared a weekends worth of food in advance and we ate them on Sunday.  SO GOOD!  I used dijon mustard since I didnt have ground.  The flavor was so amazing and the steaks were so juicy.

This recipe was great!  I made it for some friends last night and it was a hit.  I too halved the vinegar and instead of grilling or broiling I cooked the meat in the skillet I carmelized the onions in then added the onions and goat cheese on top of the meat and put the skillet under the broiler to melt the cheese.  It was great, definitely  keeper!

This was an excellent recipe.  I feel like a gourmet cook when I make recipes like this.  I caramelized the onions and added a bit of white wine which only enhanced the sweetness of the onions.  I also used feta cheese because I had no blue cheese.  The steak practically melted in our mouths.  I served it with baked potatoes and a fresh garden salad with raspberries, sugared pecans, and a raspberry viniagrette.

Excellent! So easy to make and very flavorful. The balsamic marinade is excellent. I used dijon and will again. I also used sweet onions and omitted the sugar, there is no need for it. My husband loved it. A keeper!

I used coarse ground mustard in lieu of plain dijon mustard (it was what I had on hand) and omitted the onions out of personal preference, but the marinade was delicious.  Very simple and easy to make.

Made these for a special anniversary dinner party and they were amazing! The flavor the marinade added was subtle, and didn't take away from the premium cut of a filet. I Carmelized the onions a couple hours ahead of time, which I would recommend as they take quite a while. The flavor they add is well worth the time . I substituted Feta for the blue cheese, just a taste preference, but it turned out really good as well.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe as written except I reduced the sugar slightly and didnt bother with one side of the grill being hotter than the other. Someone complained about the blue cheese - saying it overwhlemed the meat - please don't skimp on the blue cheese!!! The blue cheese, along with the yummy marinade, makes the recipe! If we didn't want a blue cheese taste we would not have selected this recipe! Glad I made this for our anniversary dinner...Can't wait to make again soon!

AWESOME! After I trimmed the filet, I marinated in a large ziplock, with all of the air squeezed out.  Do NOT marinate for longer than 30 minutes.  You would think that filet mignon would not absorb a lot of marinade because it is so moist but it does. The only changes I made were to cut the sugar in half and use brown sugar instead of white and I used gorgonzola because that was what I had. Fantastic!

This recipe was awesome! Loved the blue cheese. Altered the marinade - used actual dijon mustard and red cooking wine in place of the balsamic. It was great! Also cooked up some bacon and crumbled on top with the onion and and blue cheese. It was delicious!

Not for me!  Caramelized onions add a lot of sweetness to a premium cut of meat which does not require or want sweetness.  I will stay with a basic filet mignon or maybe some slightly Asian flavor but not a sweet flavor.  Thanks for trying.

Oh my! This was amazing. I had bought Piedmontese filets and was worried about trying something new with such an expensive cut. I don't think I've ever received so many compliments! Be sure to grill these, don't sear!!! I always buy Benissimo Basil & Dried Tomato Olive Oil (actually dipping oil) to use in some receipes so I used it instead of adding the herbs. Amazing! I offered blue cheese and goat cheese. Thanks so much, I will definitely make this many times this summer!UPDATE: Less than a week later, I used the marinade on some steak/onion kabobs on the grill, then sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles when done. Not exactly the same but at was wonderful as well!

I can't give it a full 5 Star because I fudged a little.  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so I had to substitute some Merlot for the marinade.  I also added one glove of fresh pressed garlic to the marinade.  Also, after I finished I realized I had inadvertently omitted the mustard...oops!   Anyways, even with those (or because of?) this steak was AWESOME!  I served it over fresh garlic mashed potatoes with green beans, and it would DEFINITELY rival any steak house.  Overall, I would give what I came up with a 5 Star rating...all the way!

Soooo good and so easy.  I think I'll cook the steaks a little less time as we like them rare but my husband and I both agreed this recipe is a keeper. Also when it was time to add the blue cheese I first layed down some tin foil on the grill to save the clean up.  It worked just fine.  Thanks for a great receipe.

Pretty amazing, I reduced the amount of onion and used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, but otherwise kept it all the same!  Great with some mashed potatoes, caesar salad, and bread.

This deserves ten stars. It's the best steak marinade/recipe I have ever had, and I compare every steak I eat now to it. My husband and I never get tired of it -- we use it for all steaks, not just filet mignon. I also gave it to a girlfriend whose husband is a picky eater -- they broil it and LOVE it. I often top the steaks with feta instead of blue cheese, since blue is often an acquired taste for many. This is perfect!

Delicious!   We tried it with ribeyes and with chicken breasts as well and both were wonderful.   Served it on top of crispy baked hash brown patties as another reviewer mentioned and it added another layer of delectable flayor with an added crunch - yum!

We liked the marinade and blue cheese, but the onion was too sweet for us.  Maybe if I'd not used a sweet onion or omitted the sugar we would like it better.

simple, fast and extremely good. I started out using filet mignon for this recipe and quickly learned that it tastes just as good with pretty much any cut of beef.

This recipe was amazing.  I found this months ago, but was waiting for a special occassion to make it, what could be better than filets on sale at the grocery store?  I only made a few slight changes.  Instead of course dijon mustard I used spicy brown mustard.  We love spicy brown, so everything that requires mustard we substitute spicy brown mustard.  I think the recipe calls for a little too much rosemary.  I liked the taste of the marinade, but didn't like all of the crushed rosemary pieces.  So I through it in a blender on purree and it came out great.  The pieces of rosemary were blended in the sauce and it thickened up a little.  I marinated the filets for an hour, but took another reviewers suggestion and let them sit at room temperature.  Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar when grilling my onions.  I didn't have an indoor grill, so I broiled the steaks.  Right before they were done I topped with blue cheese, then added the onions while serving.  Next time I will melt the cheese over the onions to keep everything in place.  I was a little worried all the marinade, onions, and blue cheese would taste together, but they came out wonderfully.  My boyfriend said it was one of the best meals I have made and was a great meal to compliment the stressful day he was having.  He just got lost in the yummy steaks.  Great recipe!

My husband is a grill king, so we were a bit afraid of ruining good filets...not to mention, he doesn't care for rosemary.  Well, we thought we'd give it a try and followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing we'll change next time is to marinate the filets longer and add more toppings. This was delicious! TIP: After filets are cooked, put them on baking tray before adding toppings so you don't loose the toppings.

Fantastic! Follow the recipe as is. The only thing I did differently was use Monterrey Jack cheese instead, since that's all I had. The caramelized onions are a delicious touch. This is definitely a dish to impress guests. This one's a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't feel comfortable putting the steak with onion & cheese back on the grill (seemed a bit messy), so I just microwaved the bleu cheese to melt it, then poured it on top of the filet and onion.  YuMmMMmMMMmyyyYYYy.

I get my filets at COSTCO and they are very big so my husband and I usually share one.  After letting the steak rest for 5-10 minutes, I slice it, cover with onions and cheese, and pop in the toaster over for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  I've made this several time and regardless of which cheese I select (last night was Gouda), it always tastes awesome.  Definitely restaurant food!!!

This was very good and a great recipe for New Years Eve dinner.  We did make two small changes and used Hot and sweet mustard (we did not have any Dijon handy) and we did use crumbled gorgonzola instead of the blue cheese.  It was a hit with both adults and kids.  Yummy!

This is a fabulous, elegant dish that is very easy to prepare.  I omitted the blue cheese since I don't care for it and also the sugar since balsamic vinegar is sweet enough for me.

We'd never made filet mignon before, and this recipe was absolutely incredible!  The meat was so tender and juicy, and the flavors were to die for!  It is definitely a repeat-dinner.  One thing I learned, though, was taht you can't really be too generous with the seasoned salt and pepper.

My boyfriend LOVED it. He's a big fan of gorgonzola, so i used that cheese instead of blue.  It didn't really meet my expectations.  I guess i was expecting a little more after reading all the ratings.  Don't get me wrong, it was still very tasty!

This was the absolute best steak I have ever had!  If you cook it right, it even better than a steak from Burn's Steakhouse.  I used goat cheese instead of blue, and it melted in my mouth.  I will definately be making this steak for many years to come!

Oh my gosh!  Literally we JUST finished eating this for dinner not even 2 mins ago and it was SO delicious, tender, and flavorful that I had to write a review right now.  The flavors are WONDERFUL and the meat so tender!  I can't cook a filet to save my life but these came out to an excellent tenderness.   I used filet mignon and pork filets and they both worked wonderfully.  My husband said "These are so good I could have these again tomorrow."  I laughed but he looked at me and said "Seriously!".

First, let me say I rarely give a 5 star as that is "Thank God for this!" food.  That said, this was close.  I wanted to give 4.5 stars!  Spouse thought it was a 5, I thought 4 (steak was aged too much though) and kids thought 3.5 & 4 stars.


Used brown sugar and marinated for about 45 minutes turning several times.  Took about 4 minutes or so for cheese to melt (gas grill) so factor that in on your preferred doneness.


Overall, an excellent meal!

This was amazing - made it last night and both me and my boyfriend loved it!  A definite keeper and my new favorite way of preparing tenderloin filets.  I made it exactly as written with one exception; I cooked the filets in a cast iron skillet instead of on the grill (with temps of -10 it's a bit too cold to be doing anything on the grill right now).  Absolutely delicious.  We tried it with and without the blue cheese - great both ways.  Thank you to JDVMD for sharing the recipe.  Yum!!

Fantastic recipe! I am not a steak eater, but once a year will eat a filet.  This was our first attempt at grilling them at home.  My husband did a great job with the grilling of the steaks.  The instruction/heat time was perfect for a medium-rare steak.  The flavor was outstanding, and the bleu cheese was a perfect topping.  Served these with 'Grilled Rock Lobster Tails', 'Grilled Sweet Onion' both from AR and grilled Parmesan green beans.  Definitely a 5-star meal tonight.

I didn't have Rosemary or Blue Cheese and somehow managed to forget the sugar and onions (duh), but it still was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! This will be the only way I cook a filet from now on.  Oh, I also didn't have
Dijon, so I just used another spicy mustard I had.

This recipe is great when you cannot afford a fillet mignon this will also work well with a london broil and chicken breast if you want to change it up.

I marinated the filets about 90 minutes and when they were almost done on the grill, I put them in the pan that I carmelized the onions in, topped them with the onions and cheese and put the lid on till the cheese melted. I didn't want to lose any of that good blue cheese in the grill. The combination of the onions and blue cheese on the steak is awesome.

I made this a few nights ago for our Valentine’s Day dinner along with potatoes and roasted asparagus.  I was surprised by the short marinating time, but followed the recipe.  I caramelized the onions earlier in the day and zapped them in the microwave just before topping the grilled filets.  Rather than try to top the steaks while standing over a searing grill, we brought them inside, topped them with the onions and blue cheese and popped them under the broiler just until the cheese began to melt.  Hubs and I both like our filets and we really enjoyed the caramelized onions on this.  But we both agreed the blue cheese overwhelmed all the other flavors, even though I skimped on it a bit.  For us the blue cheese was about all we could taste.  So our conclusion is that we’ll definitely make this again, but skip the blue cheese entirely.  I guess it’s just not for us.  I do think, however, a balsamic glaze drizzled over the onions/steaks would be fabulous!

Delicious!  We used this on a couple of sirloin steaks and it was fantastic.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I just mixed Hot and Sweet with Coarse Brown, turned out great!  The onions are terrific!  Add blue cheese a little at a time, because a little goes a long way on this steak!  No leftovers, everyone cleaned their plates!

I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic. I broiled the steaks in the oven instead of grilling.  They turned out great!

I used goat cheese (AMAZING) as it was what was in my fridge and I didn't feel like doing groceries... and I added a red wine reduction, def. not needed as this cut is so juicy but it definitely complimented it fantastically. 
Best meal I've ever made... maybe even ever eaten..

We used a different marinade (bottled 'red wine and cracked pepper' by Diana) but overall I wasn't impressed. We did cook this in a grill pan to achieve a nice 'crossed' sear. The amount of blue cheese and the caramelized onions seemed too much for such a delicate cut of meat. It was eaten and enjoyed by our guests, but it won't be a repeat.

I am not an accomplished chef with steak, but with the directions here, the steak turned out amazing!  We used sirloin and still had great results. If you are not a blue cheese fan, feta also works well. The directions on how to cook the steak made all the difference for me. We just made this for friends and it was a big hit

Very good.  Only changes: eliminated sugar and butter...and added a bit more olive oil to make it healthier.  Taste did not suffer at all.

My husband called this FABULOUS!  All the flavors work well together-  balsamic vinegar, blue cheese, carmelized onions.  We loved it!  I marinated for a little over an hour but followed the rest of the recipe as written.

1----This was a poor combination of flavors, and I am sorry that I tried the recipe and wasted this expensive cut of fine meat.  The mustard, vinegar, blue chees, and onions are all very strong and fine flavors.  Individually these are all marvelous, but combined they fight--like mixing beautiful colors and getting gray!  I would not recommend this, and I will not make it again.

I didn't like the balsamic flavor with the filet (and I normally love balsamic).  It takes away from the wonderful flavor of the steak.  The onions are good though!

I used rib eyes instead, but OMG these were delicious! I love cheese and never thought to put it on my steak. I have tried it with a couple different cheeses and they are all fabulous. My fav is smoked gouda. Everything goes perfectly together in this recipe. Thank you!

Simply put, when asked his rating, my husband raised his left hand as he was taking a bite with his right and showed me five fingers!  This was awesome.  I had to use gorgonzola mixed with some blue cheese dressing because that was on hand for our impromptu menu.  I also perfectly broiled the meat since it was -2F outside and I was in no way going to grill!  YUM!!!

This is the BEST recipe.  I have never been a fan of blue cheese. I initially made it for my husband... but i LOVED it.  It's easy to make and it tastes fantastic!

I didn't top the filet mignon like directed, but used the basic marinade and cooking method. It was WONDERFUL

This recipe is great! Very fancy. I get the filet mignon that is wrapped in bacon. I cooked it on the grill 5 minutes on both sides and then cook it bacon side down, rotating it ever few minutes so the bacon gets crisp. The meat came out medium rare. I also recommend mixing the blue cheese with some soft cheese (I used a laughing cow swiss cheese triangle) and make sort of a cheese paste. This way I was able to contol where the cheese went and I was also able to use more! I broiled the meat, onion and cheese in the oven instead of on the grill and it works out much better (nothing falls off).

This is by far one of the best recipes on the site.  I make it time after time.  I am also a police officer and have made it for my squad along with a twice baked potato and it goes over great!

I would rate this as 6/10. The marinade was good, but the blue cheese was too intense.  I felt that it took away from the meat and the marinade.  Maybe it would be better with a different cheese on top. If I make it again I might try feta.

I followed this recipe exactly. I had never tasted blue cheese before this and I (unfortunately) found out I don't like the flavor of blue cheese.  I found the cheese overpowered everything and I really really didn't the combo of flavours.  My husband thought it was okay and suggested 3 stars.  Maybe I would like it better with goat cheese...but I probably won't try again.  Sorry...but thanks for the recipe.

I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!  This was by FAR one of the best recipes I've tried from allrecipes.  I made it exactly as the recipe says and WOW was it amazing!!  I used Porterhouse instead of Filet, but this marinade would be great on ANY steak!!!  Try it today!!

Both my husband and I thought there was too much balsamic vinegar in this recipe. It overpowered the steaks. If I make this again I will reduce the amount of B vinegar or use Red wine vinegar instead. I always like to try a recipe as written and then tweak it later on if not to our liking.

Wow...this was delicious. I made it for my family on Valentine's Day.  I used feta instead of blue cheese (personal preference) and everyone loved it.  I was the only one who ate the onions...and they were wonderful!

Unbelievably good!!  I made it in my panini maker (it was 7 degrees outside the day i made this) then put the filets under the broiler to melt the cheese.  Wouldn't (and didn't!) change a single thing!!!  It took about 10 minutes on the panini grill on med/high.

This may very well be the best thing I have ever cooked.  I subbed goat cheese for the blue cheese (personal preference) and I'm still in the afterglow period............fabulous.  I cooked inside in a cast iron pan for 10 mins. and under the broiler for 4 mins. To die for medium rare......served with baked potatoes and a salad.  Thank you for this recipe.  I think I want to marry you.........

Super easy recipe and yummy.  I marniated about 1.5 hours and used Omaha Steaks sirloins.  I didn't use any cheese, but it wasn't needed either.  My husband and father in law couldn't get enough. Thanks!

Yes!!  Fantastic!  Great marinade...only change (my choice) was no blue cheese...don't like it at all.  Don't need it...the carmelized onions do a fantastic job of bringing out the flavor of the steak.  Thank you!

Absolutely fablous!  I added 1 cup mushrooms, 1 finely minced shallot, and a splash of Pinot Nior to the onions.  The flavor is truly amazing.  Next time, I'll this with ribeyes since that is my favorite cut.  You really can't go wrong with these!

Loved the blue cheese and onion topping! It really tasted incredible! I always seem to overcook the steak ( any steak)though. Anyone have tips for the perfect "medium" steak?

Lovely way to prepare a great filet!  The marinade does not take away from the taste of the meat, and lends a nice, subtle flavor.  I used goat cheese instead of blue, which better suited my tastes.  A first rate dish.

Excellent!!  Marinated the filets for around 2 hours and they were fabulous!  The carmelized onions are to die for and the bleu cheese adds an extra special touch.  I made this for my boyfriend for our Valentine's Day dinner and he was very impressed.  Thank you for the post!!

Great recipe!  I tried blue cheese on 2, and mozzarella on the other 2. Both tasted fabulous! The marinade really gives the filets a lot of flavor, but is not overpowering. I will use this recipe a lot this summer!

WOW!  This is fabulous and just melts in your mouth.  I used good old Stadium brand mustard, because that is what I had on hand, and let the filets marinate for about 6 hrs.  Because I am not a fan of blue cheese, I used goat cheese instead and it was wonderful.  I cooked the 2" thick filets to about 160º internal temp. and they came out perfectly, with just a slightly pink color inside.  GREAT RECIPE, JDVMD!!

Let me start by saying I don't really care for steak, so covering it in cheese and other goodness was sort of a brilliant idea to me.  I couldn't find filet mignon at our commissary anywhere so I went with 4 strip steaks and they worked fine.  Everyone really loved this.  Except me.  I mean the toppings were tasty and all but the steak still tasted just like... well, steak.  I didn't think the marinade did much for it.  On the upside, I left two of the steaks in the marinade overnight and cooked them today, sliced thin and had steak salad for lunch.  That was superb.  I might make again.

What a wonderful balance, I didn't Have Dijon, rather a Spicy Brown Mustard, nor did I have blue cheese, so I just smothered the filet in the caramelized onions.  The dish turned out perfect.  I had a nice bottle of Affentaler Valley of the Monkey Baden Pinot Nior to match the meal. Thanks for the excellent posting.

This was wonderful, the caramelized onions and the blue cheese on top of the steak made it go from ordinary to something special. I followed the recipe that was here and did not make any changes at all.

I was out of blue cheese but made it with the rest and it was one of the most savory pieces of meat I've ever enjoyed.

My husband loved this recipe as written.  I preferred it without the toppings (onions and cheese) in the end...  It was easy enough for me to just scrape them off and enjoy the flavor of the marinated steak.  We will definitely be making this again.

Was delicious! I cooked it for my family and I hardely EVER cook, so they were already a little uneasy leaving dinner up to me..My dad can be hard to please, but he and the rest of the family loved it. Was easy to follow and cook. We've made it again since.

This was delicious!  I made this for my husband and I for Valentines day...we were both saying mmm mmm good!  I left the blue cheese off and pan fried in my cast iron skillet and then put in my broiler for about 10 minutes.  It was absolutely great!  A wonderful way to end our Valentines day.

I am reviewing the marinade only, as we used a cream sauce with onion and blue cheese for the topping instead (from the tasty kitchen site...very good, by the way).  The marinade did impart some sweetness to the filets (my boyfriend commented on the sweetness immediately with the first bite), but other than that, I didn't think it did anything for the steaks in terms of flavor.  Also, for those who are planning on searing the steaks indoors, take note: the balsamic vinegar caused problems when I went to pan-sear the steaks.  I patted the steaks dry, removing as much moisture as possible from the marinade, and used Mark Bittman's technique for searing that requires less heat than normal (a method I have used over and over again with great success and zero smoke).  The balsamic vinegar burned almost immediately, even on moderate heat, filling the kitchen with particularly acrid smoke.  While the steaks were cooked to a lovely medium rare, the burnt balsamic black crust was a detraction.  That being said, I think the onion-blue cheese combo is a nice touch, and our cream sauce used similar flavors - all I did differently was add cream to the onions after they were caramelized, reduced that by about half, and then melted some blue cheese into the sauce - a nice option if you want a milder blue cheese flavor.

This was similar to a recipe my husband's friend cooked for us, but not quite as good.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  Also, I made some slight changes (we hate blue cheese), so maybe it's not fair to only give it 4 stars since I didnt follow the recipe exactly. Anyhow, I left out the dijon and added fresh chopped garlic to the marinade and just a wee bit of sugar.  Also, instead of blue cheese, we topped with goat cheese and it was very good.  Overall, a keeper, but needs to be tweaked a bit. . .

Yummy! I grilled these steaks outside and they were great.  I also did some chicken in place of the steak (My Mom does not like steak, go figure) and it was also very delicious.  I have used this marinade on it's own many times now and love it.

I used some large Filet Mignon steaks so I doubled the marinade and then decided to marinade overnight.  Made this for guests last night and they raved.  I also used gorgonzola cheese rather than blue cheese...just a preference.

This steak was great! Next time we will cook for less time, as we took the suggestion to melt the blue cheese in the broiler and the steak was a little too well done. Awesome taste though, definitely restaurant quality. Will make it again and again!

This was fabulous! The marinade was wonderful, though one should make sure that the excess is brushed off before putting the steaks into a pan. I loved the carmelized onions and bleu cheese with this. It's the first steak I've savored without steak sauce.

Very good!  Would be good on any cut of steak.  I made it just as the recipe was written.  Only the time of cooking the steak was adjusted due to steak size and preference.

LOVED the caramelized onions on this. Next time I will add less blue cheese, as it is a little tangy for my taste. 

As a tip, make sure you let the meat "rest" for a couple of minutes after grilling instead of cutting right into it. The juices will have a chance to spread evenly throughout the meat, instead of spilling out to leave you with a dry steak.

I used crumbled feta seasoned with dried tomato and basil instead of the blue cheese. I served this with pan seared jumbo scallops topped with diced roma tomatoes, asparagus, and a spinach salad with tomatoes, dried cranberries, and feta for a lovely Valentines dinner for my husband. We scarfed every bit of it with some champagne. The steaks were delicious, especially paired with the scallops. I will definitely make this again!! It looked beautiful on the plate and tasted wonderful.

Absolutely wonderful, the only changes I could suggest is doubling the marinade and I did marinade for a couple of hours.  I also added garlic to the onions and used a little extra butter.  Really, this is fantastic!!!  My guests insisted on having the recipe and others that I have sent here are loving it also!  Also, paired this with the Ultimate Twice Baked Potato recipe on this site.

Wow what a splurge at home!!! I would have paid well over $100 (per person) for a steak like this at a fancy restaurant. My only changes were to omit the mustard, sprinkle my filets w/ Omaha Steak Seasoning and use mozzarella cheese. I served this with Never Enough Green Bean Casserole and Pecan Sweet Potato Casserole (both on this site). Bread and a salad too. A Valentines Dinner to remember!!!

My husband and I loved the recipe. I cooked basmati rice covered it with sauted spinach and then added the steak with carmelized onions and blue cheese on top. It was wonderful!

Made this for our Valentine's Dinner.
Really good,the only change I made was that I used spicy brown mustard since that is what I had on hand. Hubby and I both loved it. Made for a great "Restaurant" dinner at home.

This was an absolutely phenomenal recipe! My husband is the “steak god” and even he said this recipe outdid anything he’s made. (I still let him do the actual grilling because I will turn EVERYTHING into hockey pucks on a grill!) This is definitely a new favorite for us. The only (over-the-top) change I added was to roast two large cloves of elephant garlic in the oven with a large drizzle of olive oil, coarse salt, and fresh cracked black pepper. We simply served this with steamed asparagus and some white corn.

You MUST try this recipe!!!!

Delicious recipe - I made it with strip loin steaks, fresh rosemary and cooked on an indoor grill, which doesn't have a hood, so I transferred the steak to a skillet before topping with the onions and crumbled cheese and put the lid on the skillet. Melted like a charm. Thanks for the company worthy recipe Linda.

this recipe was absolutely wonderful. The only complaint I had was the cheese did not melt, but then again it was 10 degrees F outside and that was where the grill is. My 9 yr old daughter who loves just about everything but has the belly the size of an ant finished and entire 6oz filet with the last two bites of mine. My husband has declared this a keeper. I will definitely make this again.

Sooooo.... My wife thought she would make this for me a few weeks ago. IT WAS AMAZING!!! There were quite a few substitutions and deletions.

We used Filets wrapped in bacon.
No Dijon Mustard (I'm not a big fan of the yellow stuff)

She used Feta for the topping which she mixed with a wedge of Laughing Cow creamy swiss cheese spread. 

We visited my parents recently and made this for them for dinner. They were overly impressed and swore up and down that the meal would cost more than $40 at any restaurant. 

TOP NOTCH!!!

This recipe is wonderful!!  
Very easy to prepare and so full of flavor. Our friends asked why we wanted to ruin a good cut of meat with all of the ingredients.  I called them to tell them how wrong they were! We will make this again...very soon.  Thanks!

My family found the blue cheese topping way too strong.  My husband normally likes blue cheese but even he didn't like it.  However, the marinade I really enjoyed.  The flavor is excellent.

Wonderful!  I used what I had available, which was beef tenderloin instead of filet, and feta instead of bleu cheese.  We loved the marinade!!  Use a good quality balsamic vinegar, it is worth it.

I decided to give the Easter turkey a miss this year, and make this instead. The onion and cheese combination was absolutely delicious, but we weren't as keen on the marinade - it made the meat a bit wet and sloppy. We would prefer a simple pepper and garlic dry rub. It was good though. Thanks!

Excellent taste. Used the beef center loin steaks wrapped in bacon. Didn't have blue cheese so used a touch of Dried tomato-Feta cheese ranch dressing instead on top of caramelized onions (which are a must for this recipe!). Recommend to try this recipe.

Sorry, I didn't care for the blue cheese on top of the steak at all (though I generally do like blue cheese), and the marinade was just okay.  Similar to a lot of other steak marinades I've had.  I guess I expected something more after reading the reviews.

I made this for my husband and he said it was the best thing I have ever cooked for him. He recommended that we make it at our next dinner party. We did and our friends are begging for us to have another one. I don't have a barbeque, so I made it in a grill pan and covered it and removed from the heat at the end to melt the cheese a bit. This recipe is super easy and gets rave reviews....can't ask for anything better.

30-45 min is really all you need for this quick & easy marinade to tenderize a good cut.  This one has me pausing in between bites just to savor every bite!

Wonderful meal.  The vinegar/oil/mustard mix gave it a nice taste, but the carmelized onions and blue cheese were the key for me.  We had this with the "Roasted Vegetables" recipe from this site and it was just an outstanding combination.

This was wonderful! Very tasty and easy to make. I used a cheddar cheese instead of blue as my husband doesn't like it. Will be making again for sure.

The best steak I've ever made.  I sub'd the blue cheese with goat cheese and can't wait to make this delicious steak.

The marinade was ok.  I didn't like the flavor the blue cheese gave the dish.  It was too overpowering. I don't think I'd make this dish again.  I think this would be quite enjoyable for someone who absolutely loves blue cheese.

The filets were perfect.  This was my first time making steak and I was very impressed with myself.  They were perfectly done and the flavors went together wonderfully.  I marinated for about an houring before grilling on the stove in a grill pan.

Love this recipe!  It looks difficult and fancy but is secretly easy to throw together. And delicious! The only change I made was swapping brown sugar for the white.

My normal filet marinade takes 24 hours, so when we decided at the last minute to make some filets we had in the freezer, I was on the hunt for something that didn't need that long and turned to this recipe, given all the great reviews. For starters, the marinade smelled and tasted fantastic!! I was extremely excited about how my steak would taste, simply based on the marinade. It was also super quick to whip up with ingredients I had on hand. 5-stars for that.  The only reason I'm rating it lower than 5 stars is because I definitely disagree with the 30 minute marinade time. We gave it about 45 mins (again, this was a last minute dinner idea so we were pressed for time), which was no where near long enough. =( The steaks barely picked up the flavoring of the marinade and because of that, tasted pretty bland.  We'll definitely be trying it again - but only when we have several hours (or overnight) to marinate.

Great flavor on the steak but blue cheese crumbles did not melt!  Would have had to cook steaks too long to get it to melt. Disappointed!

Replaced white sugar brown sugar.  Caramelizing was enhanced richly, to me.  Didn't serve wine, but meal was delicious.  Also tweaked the recipe's marinade.  "Delish dish, simple and not time consuming at all!"

The marinade was delicious. However I seared the meat on both sides for two minutes each on a cast iron grill pan then finished in a 400 deg oven for 8 minutes for a perfect medium rare. My husband loved it. I also didn't cook the onion just because we don't like onion. Enjoy!

It was okay, but not mind blowing.  The marinade was very good and I will definitely use it again, but probably not the blue cheese crumble.  I expect this has far more to do with my own personal taste then any failings with the recipe.

OH WOW I love steaks and grilling and this is by far the best filet mignon I have ever had.  Made this for Valentine's for my husband and he loved it, can't stop talking about how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly as shown and served with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.

I was very hesitant to try this recipe. It didn't seem right to cover up the flavor of a very good piece of meat. It was FANTASTIC! The cheese and onions were a great compliment. I used a very thick cut of ribeye and it was great.

My husband is not usually fond of marinated steak but this recipe was an exception.  I made it for company and they raved. Moving the filets to the medium side of the grill to melt the blue cheese was a great idea.  I will make this again.

We made this for a quiet "Super Bowl" meal.  It was fantastic. We used large T-bones as the filet's were quite small at the butcher shop that day.  We also made with Moms Sweet Potato casserole and Apple Cole slaw from this site.  We served creme brulee for desert.  It was probably one of the best meals we have had in a long time.I will  never be able to eat steak just plain again. Thank you for a great recipe!

Sooooooo good- use with bleu cheese or goat cheese, both are fantastic.  the steak was tender and the toppings complimented the meal.  served with mixed greens salad and au gratin potatoes.

My husband isn't a big fan of beef tenderloin was very very happy with this recipe.  He said you would pay good money for this if you ate out.  I will make this again for sure. Thanks!!

Steak turned out beautifully cooked, about the best ever. However the marinade was too strong, and I felt it ruined the flavour of the fillet steak.

My husband looked at me like I was crazy when I said I was going to pan sear this. We have a great barbeque outside, but it was raining.  I preheated the broiler to finish it. 90 seconds on each side in the oven proof pan and a bit on the thick edges and then into the oven broiler checking the temp every few minutes.  I pulled it out 10 degrees before medium rare, let it sit with the onions and cheese on it until the temp came up to 145 degrees.  Wow, soo good.

I had blue cheese that I had to use before it went bad so I tried this.  I didn't change any of the ingredients and it was liked by all - but we all still are crazy about the Filet Mignon with Mushroom-Wine Sauce that is on this site.

I made this last night for my friends for our Christmas get together and it was a hit.  I did not use any type of cheese, the marinade and onions were great by themselves.  Will make this again. Thanks

Tasty.  The balsamic vinegar overpowered the other flavors so I would cut back a little on that next time.  But good flavor and great with the onions and blue cheese.

This was DELICIOUS! The flavors were perfect together. It looked like a lot of extra steps to grill a steak - but it was so worth it! It didn't take that much longer to prepare either. I don't think I'll ever want a plain old steak again! Much better than any restaurant steak I have ever had.

My husband loved this recipe!  He wants us to make it again for our an upcoming dinner party.
FOLLOW-UP:  For our dinner party, we started with a Creamy Squash Soup, Pumpkin Salad, and then the Filets with mashed potatos and a hearty Chianti we picked up while in Tuscany.  Huge Hit!  Wonderful!!  Thanks!
