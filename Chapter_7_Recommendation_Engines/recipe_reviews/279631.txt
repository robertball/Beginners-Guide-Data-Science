I have never made leavened bread before and I decided to start with this recipe.

The yeast step didn't work for me as far as creating a froth.  I poked around on the internet some and found you have to add sugar to get the yeast to activate.  My yeast appeared to be dead, but I completed the recipe anyway.  I got a raw-looking (but not actually raw inside) outcome that tasted all right but was not risen.  I blamed the yeast.

The next day I got some other yeast which I tried to activate with water, per this recipe.  Nothing happened.  Then I tried again using sugar, and I got a big froth.  Yay.  Maybe my loaf will rise!

No.  One hour in an airtight container and there was really no perceptible rise.  The air in the container was noticeably warm, though, so I could tell something chemical was trying to happen.  

Kneaded and then put in slow cooker.  2 hours later I had a loaf nearly identical to the one from the prior day.

TLDR:  1.  Use sugar in step one of the recipe.  2.  If you don't mind a barely-risen doorstop for texture and size, this recipe is OK.  The flavor is fine.

Unbelievably easy! I’m obsessed with this bread and have made it three times in less than a week. Because of the lockdown, I don’t have bread flour and so have had to experiment with what I’ve had on hand. The first time I used 30% spelt flour and 70% einkorn. It was a nice loaf! The second time I used half einkorn, half all-purpose flour. It was even better! I can’t wait till I get some bread flour, as I’m sure it’ll be even better yet. I have used a combination of oats and seeds (sesame, poppy) to cover the bottom and top of the bread. Also, since I’m out of parchment, I have been lining the slow cooker with aluminum foil, and it works totally fine. I broil at the end as suggested. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I have made it again and we still enjoy it. It's nice to know what's in your own bread.

Thank you for the recipe!  My kids and I really like it!  This 2nd one looks better.  Can’t wait to get to it!  Sorry I don’t know how to use this camera yet.  I’ll take pic as soon as I learn how to make it smaller I guess

So easy and versatile. I added some VWG to my all purpose flour. I’ve used all sorts of add-ins: olives cheese everything seasoning rosemary oregano sautéed garlic, and even a cinnamon with a little brown sugar one.  I love that it’s in the slow cooker especially in the summer.

This bread is great. Made it two weekends in a row. Used sesame and black cumin seeds. Will experiment with other seeds. Thanks for sharing.
