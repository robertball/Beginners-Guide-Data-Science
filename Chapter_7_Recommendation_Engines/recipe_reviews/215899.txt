Very delicious!  I will definitely make this again!  The only thing I would change is maybe cut back on the red onion a little bit and add a few more olives.

I made this and put it in a tortilla with slices of red pepper.  It made a satisfying, healthy lunch that tastes pretty good.

This made a really good, easy, healthy lunch.  I served it on a bed of lettuce tossed with a tiny bit more dressing.  I don't care for raw onion too much, so I left that out.

YUM!!  I've been trying to find ways to jazz up my tuna salad for lunch at work.  This recipe hit the spot!  I used the absolutely fabulous greek/house dressing from this site and switched out the kalamata olives for black olives because of personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, wow, and WOW! First off, I have to say I'm not a huge fan of tuna. I just started eating it more recently, and it's one of the few things I'm picky about. I had a favorite recipe that I had been making, but was looking for something new to try. This sounded good, and I was right! The only small changes I made were to use less red onion (at most 1 tsp) and more dressing (about 1 tbsp). I've eaten this for lunch 2 days in a row, stuffed in avocado halves. AMAZING! I'll be making this often!

A delicious lunch that I will certainly make again.  I added grape tomatoes, some cucumber, and put it into a tomato basil wrap.  I used the 3 oz can and had plenty for two.  Very tasty!  Thank you.

Great recipe! After just coming off and 5 day fast and cleanse I have to be mindful of the first foods I start eating. Being that I had a ton of tuna fish (packet, low sodium) I wanted to make a tuna salad. I tweaked it a bit...combined: tuna, celery, SDT, art hearts, chix peas (low sodium, rinsed and drained), red pepper, red onions, scallions, cherry tomatoes, black olives, fresh parsley, basil and Rosemary, feta cheese, lemon juice, little of olive oil and Greek dressing. Served over a bed of fresh spinach salad mix....Delish!!!! And super healthy!!! (Actually had the lady at the supermarket ask if I was a vegetarian!!! Lol)  great base recipe!!! Thx for the ideas!!!

I made this into pasta salad. I doubled everything but the dressing, and added 3x  vinaigrette. Then i mixed it all with spiral rotini, diced peeled baby zucchini and a diced tomato. delicious.

Made this today, 6/16/19.  About 10 days ago I was at one of my favorite coffee shops and decided to try the daily sandwich special, a mediterranean tuna salad.  I was a little unsure if I'd like it as it had kalamata olives and feta cheese in it.  I like olives (although not sure I want olives in a sandwich) and am lukewarm on feta.  The sandwich was very good.  So much so that I went online looking for a recipe for a similar sandwich.  I came across this allrecipes one which I had saved but never made.  I didn't have olives but did have basil tomato feta.  I also didn't have the Greek dressing so used plain mayo.  It was very similar to the sandwich I had at my favorite hangout.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! I made it with two pouches of Ranch Starkist Tuna Creations I had on hand (reluctantly, afraid of flavor clash) but it was fantastic! Next time I'll load up on the olives because I love them. Thanks for this!

This was so easy to make.  Despite the fact that there are few ingredients, it was a flavor explosion. Everything worked together wonderfully. I'm adding this to my monthly menu!
