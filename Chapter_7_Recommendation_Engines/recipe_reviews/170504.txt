Overall pretty good. You must let them cool in the pan completely before cutting, and they will stay together.

They stay together pretty well compared to other homemade bars.  I didn't have enough blueberries so I had to substitute with dried dates.  I don't cared too much for the maple syrup taste so I might use honey next time.

This recipe has been a really great starting point for us to experiment with.  From here we've changed what fruits are included, how much syrup to add, and other small changes too.  It's great!

These were great!  I substituted pumpkin seeds for the sesame and sunflower seeds, added honey, vanilla, wheat germ, flax seed and greek yogurt and baked them in mini muffin pan—they are great for breakfast with a smoothie—my 13 and 23 year old love them!

Easy to make and tasty.  I needed to use up some 1/2 eaten bags of almonds, dried cranberries and blueberries.  This worked great. I did add some walnuts to mine because I didn't have enough almonds.  Will make again!

I really wanted to like these because I've been looking for a good recipe for energy bars.  However, I thought they were relatively tasteless.  They aren't cheap to make either.  Before I put them in the oven I tasted them and they just seemed very bland so I added a cup of unsweetened coconut hoping that would give them a little more flavor.  Unfortunately, I just wasted the coconut along with the other ingredients.

Really good bar, easy to make and very nutricious. Reminded me of the first packaged granola bars you could buy when they first came out when I was young, crunchy and maple tasting!!

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes.  We make these bars quite often and it's a great base to be able to mix and match seeds and fruits based on what you have or feel like having.  I often replace the sesame seeds with pumpkin seeds, and use raisins in place of the blueberries (only because I've had a hard time finding dried blueberries lately).  I think using a quality maple syrup really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for a delicious, easy, and healthy recipe!

very good recipe and so healthy---------I tried even harder to make it more healthy by subbing agave for the maple syrup and cut up prunes for the blueberries (that I did not have).  I, also, added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and baked in mini-muffin pans as suggested.  My picky husband liked them a lot!
