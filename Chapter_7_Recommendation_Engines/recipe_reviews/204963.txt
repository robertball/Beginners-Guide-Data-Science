I made this with skinless chicken breasts, red bell pepper, and no frozen peas, I didn't have any on hand.. The recipe is delicious! I do however always cut the amount of liquids to my rice dishes, I hate mushy rice. 

My in-laws we born and raised in Peru, they thought this was very authentic. Living in Miami Florida, there is a melting pot of cultures, with lots of South American resturants.. this is better than some Peruvian Arroz con Pollos I've had else where. Thank you!

This is pretty good. I've never added orange juice to it though. I'll try it next time. Beer works well instead of white wine too. There's one thing I like to do different: I do like my cilantro/chili/garlic mix to "fry" and not just to simmer. The flavor (AND aroma!) that the chili pepper, the garlic and the cilantro release when being fried is IMO much better than the one they release when being simmered. So I omit the liquids in this step and add them later, and instead I add some oil to the blender (otherwise the herbs, garlic and peppers won't blend well) and then pour the mix into the hot pot and that will cause it to "fry". I also sautee the onions in the same pot, right after the cilantro/garlic/chili has been frying for a few minutes. Everything else is the same. **note**: Be VERY careful when deveining and deseeding the chili peppers. I do it with a knife and spoon and try not to touch the inside of the pepper until it's perfectly clean. Otherwise my hands will burn and so will everything I touch. Also, be ready to cough a bit, as the smell of the spicy part of the pepper you're removing will release some vapor that will make you cough. You can always buy the chili paste in a jar, but I warn you, that one will be hot.

Peruvian Arroz con Pollo has no Orange juice or wine on it.... The original and delicious recipe is with beer and  chicken broth...and for it not to get too mushy the quantity of liquid has to be the same amount as the rice...if it is 2 cups of rice the you add 2 cups of liquid.

This reminds me of the Peruvian baked chicken we used to order from a takeout place in Manhattan.   I bet the sauce would make a great rub for roast chicken, and will give it a try.   The dish is great as is, or you can substitute chicken breast.

This was delicious and well received by all, including my picky kids.  I grew up in Ecuador, and this is a litttle different than the arroz con pollo I am accustomed to from there, but it was awfully good nevertheless and we will definitely make it again!  Thank you!

This is absolutely delicious!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  We are still licking our fingers.  I added a tiny dash of cumin and turmeric for color, and one of my family members added some lime slices on her plate.   I will definitely add this recipe to my recipe book!  Yum...

I made this for a party with Peruvians and Columbians. Everybody loved it. I used boneless, skinless, organic chicken thighs from Costco. I used beer instead of orange juice. Also, per some other recipes, I left the thighs for a couple of hours after patting with lemon juice, salt, pepper, and cumin. Tomorrow I'm using the recipe for arroz con pato (duck) and will use the orange juice in it.

Great tasting recipe!  I used a touch more garlic and substituted a jalepeno for the aji pepper and 1 Tbs of dried cilantro for the fresh.  This recipe makes a lot of food.  I thought it was going to be too much for my largest skillet, so I used a dutch oven instead of one of the skillets and it worked great.  If you do it this way, remember to simmer the cilantro-orange-garlic mixture in the dutch oven after frying the chicken (while sauteeing the onions and rice in the other skillet).  Otherwise, you're juggling hot ingredients between the pans trying to get it all to fit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just wanted thank all of you for the positive feedback for this recipe. I probably made 30 versions of this dish before this assembly of ingredients fell into place ( and I'm so glad I  made a point of writing it down and sending it in when it did!)

This is close to the recipe my mother-in-law makes. Her family is from Panama. One difference is that there is no wine in hers. Another is she uses no orange juice. I also add a bunch of flat-leafed parsley; chopped, capers, and use canned small peas.

Loved it!  I have a friend from Peru whose family owned a restaurant there.  She makes this dish all the time as it was passed down to her by her mother.    She'd never heard of using orange juice or wine before.  But then she tried it and decided to change the recipe she'd been using all her life to include them!

I liked this a lot. I used 4 thighs & 6 drumsticks, 1 bunch of cilantro, 1 serrano pepper, 1 onion and substituted 2c brown rice for the white. I liked the brown rice, but had to cook it a little longer to allow it to cook. 3 1/2 c chicken broth was fine for my rice.

It wasn't as spicy as we like it. So next time, I think I will use 2 serrano peppers and Ill add some salt (I didn't add any the first time).

This recipe was awesome, my husband loved it. He wants me to make it  again today.I was nervous at first because I did not have aji pepper, I used a jalapeno, and it was still wonders. Thanks again for sharing  oh by the way, I also did not have frozen peas. I used sweetpeas on a can, and it was soo good, I think it gave it more flavor.

I made this with skinless, boneless chicken breast and two Serrano peppers (which was the perfect spiciness for us). My husband and I really liked it. It was flavorful without being overpowering and the cilantro and orange juice combination is delicious! I would make this again for sure.

This was quite good. I couldn't find the aji pepper so I substituted a serrano pepper. It was not very spicy so I think I'll use two next time.

It was delicious even after all the changes I made: substituted parsley for cilantro, jalapeno for aji, used a whole head of garlic, and no orange juice.  Also only had 3 chicken quarters (split into thigh and chicken pieces, for 6 chicken pieces in total) but felt like plenty, since the rice was the star of the dish.  

Had to salt the liquid pretty liberally though, maybe because my chicken broth was low sodium.  Will make this again, sticking closer to original recipe.

Hi Katie: I am from Peru and an avid cook from their many recipes, arroz con pollo is one of my daughter Alex's favorites so I only make it when she is around, since it is a lot of food for dad and I. Loved the way the rice came out and the chicken was moist and juicy.  My only reccomendation is to use a frying pan and a big pot instead of two frying pans.  The volume increases and it is much more comfortable cooking it all at the end on a big pot. Did not change a thing otherwise, It was "riquisimo para chuparse los dedos" taste for salt before putting lid on. ENJOY

The orange juice and wine was a twist I had to try. I still prefer the simpler method and like to top it with an onion tomato relish (slivers of yellow or red onion and thinly sliced tomatoes soaked in lime and salt to taste). I often top it with a dash of add hot sauce too (a vinagery one).  I couldn't find the whole pepper in my area so I used the aji pepper paste (a Tbs, which was a bit much. Prob would use ~2 tsp next time), which was a fine substitute. It is important to use dark meat with this recipe as it would be too bland with white. Overall, the recipe is very good and well written. Thanks!

I made this for a potluck, wanting something a bit different.  Even though people were a bit scared off by the green tinge, my husband now insists that I make this again.  THAT is a rave reivew from him.

Great recipe! I used chicken thight because that's what was on sale. Also used 1 jalapeno due to not finding aji pepper. (I will be ordering aji pepper paste as I've needed aji pepper a few times lately). My kids truly enjoyed this dish and gobbled it right up. Unique taste and very filling. I'll definitely be making it again (and again!!)

Excellent!  Everyone here loved it!  I wasn't able to find the aji pepper in the produce section however I did find it in the dried chile section.  I just soaked it in water before taking out the seeds and blending it in the cilantro sauce.  DELICIOSO!!!!

This was a good meal, hearty and delicious.  The recipe is solid as far as amounts and cooking times.  However, I do not have a skillet big enough to hold (12 inch skillet wasn't big enough) all of it so right before everything cooks together for 30 minutes I transferred it to a large pot, got it boiling and then continued the recipe.  It came out perfectly fine.  I also used only 1 bunch of Cilantro instead of a bunch and a half but it came out OK.  Instead of the Aji Pepper I used 4 Serano Chili Peppers.  They are very small and my husband said the dish had a bit of a kick (spicy) but I didn't really notice it.

This was delicious! I didn't have an aji pepper, so I substituted with Peruvian Aji Amarillo paste purchased at a local Spanish supermarket in a nearby neighborhood. Great flavor, very authentic! I've traveled to Peru many, many times and am quite familiar with the cuisine. In fact, Peruvian food is probably my favorite of any kind. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Also, substituted 1 cup of beer for the white wine.

Ahhh-mazing! SO glad we came across this recipe! We omitted the peas, used fresh squeezed orange juice and added a packet of Goya Sazon. Riquisima!

I made this recipe for my family and it was wonderful.  I made only a few changes, however, the taste was amazing.  I used chicken breasts, 2 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce (not aji pepper), can of peas and carrots (instead of carrot and frozen peas), and no Worstershire sauce (because I had none on hand).  My meal looked exactly as in profile picture shown.  I added extra chili, which made it spicy, yet very tasty with no burn.  My mom, aunt, and uncle raved on the taste.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing!  I used one entire bunch of cilantro, just chopped about an inch off of the ends of the stems.  The stems have great flavor that doesn't need to be discarded.  My husband served a mission for our church in Peru and was very happy I learned how to make one of his favorite dishes.  Thanks, Katie!

I made this for  a potluck and everyone raved over it!  I've made it several times since and it is so good.
The only changes I made were:  I used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the bone in.  I like more veg, so I  doubled the amounts of carrot, pepper and peas. And lastly,  because some reviewers thought it was too much liquid, I added another  2/3 cup of rice. It turns out perfectly for me every time.

This was an amazing change from our traditional arroz con pollo. Very rich in flavor and the orange rice was delightful! we left out the peas and added cooked bacon and used its grease instead of olive oil.

I used this recipe as a guideline cause it's been ages since I've made arroz con pollo. My husband taught me to make it a few years ago and he never uses wine, orange juice nor Worcestershire. I decided to try the orange juice and Worcestershire but left the wine out and added some lime and it turned out delicious! I might add that I used A LOT LESS liquid and it's really important to let it sit 5-10minutes before serving.

Delicious! A bit time-consuming but worth it! I am not good at following recipes. I tend to use what I have on hand. I skinned the drumsticks, salted and peppered and browned, probably longer than necessary. Had fresh cilantro and minced garlic on hand, used my Magic Bullet and it worked great. Moscato, Lime-Aid since I had no orange juice. Minute Rice, part brown and part white, Canned peas, frozen, pre-cooked carrots, one large onion, used red and yellow peppers on top. Oh, and I had some jalapeño chopped and frozen, so I used that instead of the Peruvian pepper. Wonderful flavor! So worth the time!

Because some reviewers mentioned the rice turned mushy, I cooked my rice in a rice cooker separately, and added it in at the end for a few minutes to blend the flavors. I found aji peppers at my local public market, but since never using these peppers, I wasn't sure how long these peppers typically are. The ones I used were about 2 inches long, and I used 3. The meal wasn't too hot using the three, and it seemed just enough.  I also omitted the orange juice and cilantro and I thought the meal turned out great.

Maybe I didn't make it the right way, but for all the effort, I didn't enjoy it that much. All the ingredients looked like it was going to be delicious, but it was just kind of blah.

I add the cumin as others have said, also additional salt and green olives. I never have peas, have used corn 2 times and comes out great! Husband loves it and I do too and I usually don't like baked cooked or simmered chicken. I have used chicken quarters once and drumsticks another time, both turned out great. Always have used brown rice. Thanks for a great recipe!!

No idea how "authentic" it is but it's very flavorful and tasty. Made several adjustments based on preferences/ ingredients I had on hand.
- eliminated peas, cilantro
- used only drumsticks 
- used half the amount of orange juice 
- cooked rice separately so it won't get soggy
- added bell peppers at same time as other veggies
- added more broth than called for, especially as the liquid cooked away (eyeballed it)
- didn't use a blender (more out of sheer laziness)

Next time I'd double the veggies

My mother is from Peru and I grew up eating this stuff and it is one of my favorite dishes. I thought the flavors were really good for this recipe. The chicken came out perfect! Very tender.

A couple complaints / suggestions...

Too much liquid. The rule of thumb is 2 cups of liquid per 2 cups of rice. Another reviewer had also suggested this.

Too much onion. I made it with two unsure of how it would turn out, and it was indeed too much. Next time I will only use one onion, which I think is plenty.

This recipe as is will result in mushy rice. My suggestions above should fix this.

Mine came out a little bland. I didn't add enough salt to the combined ingredients before cooking the rice. Next time I will make sure the mixture tastes pretty salty.

I live in Costa Rica and Arroz Con Pollo is a staple so I've had my fair share. This is far better than anything I've ever had. I love it and my husband does too. I'm making tonight for a group of 15 and I am sure they will all love it!
