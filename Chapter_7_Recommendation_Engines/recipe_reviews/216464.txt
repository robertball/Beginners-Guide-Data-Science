Very similar to “Arugula Caprese Salad,” also from this site. If you use the ingredients “to taste,” rather than strictly measuring, I like this recipe better.  The amount of onions is overkill; almost 3 T., minced, for one serving! I did reduce that significantly, and just kind of sliced the onion instead of mincing it.  I do love the mix of spinach with the arugula, the mild spinach a nice counterpoint to mellow the sharper, peppery, arugula.  Unfortunately, I had no spinach on hand to add, yet it was still delicious.  I had a similar vinaigrette leftover from another salad, one I had adjusted to the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio I prefer.  The red onion added the slightest bite and flavor contrast to wake this up.  Because I had it to add, and because this was so similar to a salad I had just days ago, I added artichokes and black olives.  (And some leftover cannellini bean salad and broken crostini once I took the photos  :)   Hubs had a dinner meeting this evening, so this was a perfect “dinner alone” meal for me along with a glass of my favorite Cab and a beautiful Naples sunset.

excellent salad, great taste and texture.  Next time I would reduce the dressing by at least half.
