If I could give this 1000 stars, I would!!! This recipe is so fantastic. I made it differently, though... I didn't make mine in the oven, I made mine in the crock pot (a double batch fits well in a 3-quart cooker, if you have an army to feed! lol!) basically just mixing everything together (softening the cream of mushroom soup just for about 30 seconds in the micro to make it easier to stir.) I cooked it on low for about 3 hours, stirred it, and let simmer until I was ready for it. Then, right before serving, I stirred some of the FF Onions in with the beans, then sprinkled some on the top as well. I had a few people at Thanksgiving with an aversion to not only green bean casserole but to mushrooms as well, but they tried it and LOVED IT!!! I guess you could leave out the mushrooms if you have a lot of protesters! :) I WILL be making this again! I will try to add a bit more cheese next time, I like stuff very cheesy! 
Oh, I also used the "Real Bacon Bits" instead of frying up bacon and crumbling it myself (I'm a lazy cook, I look for shortcuts where I can, heh heh) and it tasted just wonderful! Turkey bacon might be good, too!!! Play around with it, have fun!

The original recipe called for a jar of Kraft Bacon cheese spread.  It comes in a small, 5 oz. glass jar (with a metal pry-off lid).  It also comes in other flavors. Old English is the one I use when I can't find the Bacon (as a last resort Velveeta-type)and add 1 to 2 T. finely minced cooked bacon. Obviously, the bigger the chop, the less bacon there will be in 1 T.  This recipe doubles or triples nicely.  I have also doubled the amount of green beans without changing the other ingredients and this works well too in a pinch.  Hope this helps ~Deb

I chose to do this in a crockpot over Thanksgiving, do to the oven being overused as it was. I doubled the recipe and used the kraft old english substitute, frozen greenbeans and no extra mushrooms (also sub cream of celery). I let cook about 4 hours on low. If doing in a crockpot, in the future i would recommend turning off to let the sauce set up (was a little runny.) Also the cheese added a little too much salt, so i just added pepper. I like this recipe and will use again for Christmas.

This was a nice change from the usual green bean cassarole. I used frozen greenbeans like others have suggested and I really liked them better than the canned ones. I also used some fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. My only dissappointment is that it was a little too cheezy for my tastes. I think I would prefer about half the amount of cheeze next time.

This is my go to recipe for all pitch-ins and family functions. I omit the bacon pieces to make it vegetarian. As seen in the italics at the bottom, the velveeta is a substitution and not in the original recipe. I use kraft old english cheese spread. It is in a little glass container that looks like a juice glass almost. I've tried to make this in a crockpot, but it doesn't get the same flavor. I've found that baking it as normal (without adding the french onions) and then transferring it over to a crockpot to keep warm works okay. I do bake the french onions separately to get them crispy, but I serve them in a dish on the side. I do not put them in the crockpot.

Yum! This was my first Thanksgiving as hostess, and this recipe definitely helped me through it!  I put it together the nigt before (all but the fried onions) and kept it in the fridge to make things easier the day of the big meal. I used Kraft Old English Cheese for the processed cheese, made my own real bacon (instead of bacon bits), and used fresh baby portabella mushrooms (instead of canned). All of the leftovers are gone and I'm ready to make this again! This recipe will be a staple for years to come!

This was not only delicious, but versatile! We enjoyed the casserole on Christmas, and then I added some more veggies, chicken, velveeta, french fried onions, and cream of chicken soup together to the leftovers, topped it with a pie crust and had the BEST POT PIE ever.  This was a HUGE hit on Christmas!

I have been using this recipe since Nov of 2005, and I still think it is the best green bean casserole recipe.  All of my friends and family now use this recipe as well.  There are a couple of changes that I make.  I use cheese whiz instead of the block processed cheese, and I add either worcestershire sauce or soy sauce for added flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good!  I loved the addition of the mushrooms and bacon, but wasn't crazy about the velveeta cheese that I used - I would probably try another cheese the next time. Thanks!

At first the thought of putting cheese in a green bean casserole didn't sound appealing but, it is awesome! It is easy to make and at Thanksgiving it was the first dish that was gone. I recommend it.

So I was making dinner for a friend who requested green bean casserole, which I usually HATE, so I found this recipe and made it for him...it was DELICIOUS; I should mention that I always double the green beans and soup, add garlic salt, pepper, and about 1/8 to 1/4 of a block of cream cheese along with the original amount of Velveeta, (the cream cheese is the secret ingredient that really makes this recipe amazing). I then mix some of the french fried onions throughout as well as top the casserole with them. 
Be sure to cover while baking to keep the onions from burning and then bake uncovered for ten or so minutes towards the end. My friend said that it was "better than his mom's green bean casserole," which would most likely be a HUGE compliment coming from anyone. :) Thank you for this recipe! Now my family and I will actually eat green bean casserole, but only when prepared like this!!!

So good!  I used shredded cheddar rather than processed cheese.  I also used 2 bags of fresh, pretrimmed green beans instead of canned and just microwaved them for 4 minutes before stirring into the soup/cheese mix.  I'm adding this recipe to my Thanksgiving menu.

Made this for my first thanksgiving dinner. It was a hit. The only problem I had was that I had no clue how to measure out the velvetta. I just guessed and it came out delicious, and I've never even liked Green Bean casserole. Didnt add bacon because I didnt have any, but I would make it exactly the same. This is my go to casserole recipe now!

As an experiment I made two green bean casseroles for Thanksgiving this year.  One was the traditional Campbell's recipe right off the label; the other was this one with a twist.  Both did great and my brother in law went back for seconds and half his plate was this cheesy green bean casserole.  

I made it with Kraft Old English cheese and bacon, no mushrooms. The mixture tastes a bit like cheese soup. Mixed in green beans. Before baking I topped the green beans/cheese/bacon mixture with a package of shredded cheddar cheese over the top. Then, instead of french fried onions as used in the traditional recipe, I did a Ritz top. Melt one stick of butter and mix with a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers - (note, I would do more than one sleeve next time because everyone took a lot off the top).

Baked per instructions. It was sensational.  My husband never eats green bean casserole and took seconds.

I did this in the crock pot and thought it turned out really well! I followed other's suggestions and turned the crockpot off about 30 min. before serving - made the sauce stand up so it wasn't so runny. Just keep an eye on it if your crockpot runs hot (mine does!) and stir it every hour or so. I threw mine in about three hours before dinner on low... I also used three cans of green beans and there was plenty of sauce for that many beans. Tasty and a good alternative to the standard green bean casserole!

Great recipe that is easy to make. I like things fresh, though, so I use a pound and a half to two pounds of fresh green beans, 2 fresh white mushrooms, two slices of crumbled bacon, and 3ozs. of shredded sharp cheddar in place of the prepared items. Prepare as directed with the following changes: Clean and snap the beans and dice the mushrooms. Cover with water and simmer for 8-10 minutes then drain. Substitute the shredded cheese for the processed cheese to melt into the heated condensed soup along with the crumbled bacon. The result is a fresher-tasting dish with far less sodium.

I combined this recipe with elements from the traditional recipe (added pepper and some of the French's fried onions in with the mix).  Also, I instead used 2 - 16 oz bags of frozen french cut green beans.  (If doing this, the rest of the ingredients must be doubled because the frozen is more quantity than the canned.)  I left out the mushroom pieces/stems.  It was great.

Very simple and tasty recipe!  Perfect quantity too as it's best fresh from the oven.  I found the leftovers a little soggy the next day, but this is definately a recipe I'll be making again.

I thought the cheese in this sounded kind of weird, but after reading all the reviews, i used the 5 oz. jar of Kraft old English cheese and I didn't have bacon bits so just cooked it without them.  This was Delicious!  Thanks!!

Very good recipe.  We will make this again.  I used 1 1/2 bags (16 oz) each of frozen beans and needed to adjust the baking time to be about 20 minutes longer.  Other than that, these were a big hit.

I love this recipe!  I make it for Thanksgiving dinner.  I use two bags of frozen green beans for this recipe, fully thawed and well drained, and fresh mushrooms that have been lightly sauteed instead of the canned.  When I'm feeling spicy I sneak in just a little red pepper flakes...but great without them too!

Great twist on an old classic! My husband loved it (especially the mushrooms).  I used a 5 oz jar of Kraft Old English (sharp cheddar cheese)...you can find this right by the velveeta.  Yummy!  This is a keeper!

Made this for my daughter's birthday dinner and loved it.  It was better than most typical green bean casseroles that don't have the cheese.

Doubled the recipe for a 18 person Thanksgiving Dinner. Used Kraft Old English Cheese (found in the dairy section of market). Replaced canned mushroom with 3/4 container of fresh sliced mushrooms. Used almost 1 10 oz can of French's Fried Onions. Added the onions with 15 minutes left of cooking. Everyone loved it!!

Not much flavor.  I did use french cut green beans which added a little visual to the recipe.  I felt as if this recipe was lacking something.  We all ate it but no one was blown away.

This was a pretty good recipe. It is a very different taste than the usual green bean casserole. We thought was as good as the old fashion recipe, just a cheesy option. It is a good recipe, but not fantastic.

I made this for Thanksgiving in place of traditional green been casserole.  I left out the processed cheese and used a can of Old English Cheese Spread instead.  I also used real bacon instead of bacon bits and used ALOT more than called for.  I stirred in 1 small can of French's onions into the dish.  I put all ingredients in the crock pot on low for 4 hours stirring occasionally.  Easy and deish!

I made both the traditional and this recipe side by side and today (day after) there's mostly the traditional one left over... so with that being said, I gave it 4 stars.  The cheese was different, but the bacon made it a winner!!
Update: Made it again this year and it was/is oh- so-yummy!  I use real bacon and less processed cheese than called for (I doubled the recipe and used 4 oz).  Everyone loved it!

We loved this new twist on the traditional green bean casserole!  I only added the fried onions to the top during the last five minutes of baking, otherwise they would get too burnt if left on for 30 minutes.

I am sorry, but I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I will not make it again.   The soup sauce was bland, too thick and gooey.

I didn't care much for this dish.  Seemed like a glop of processed food. 
Probably would be good though for people that usually eat this kind of thing.

This sounded really good so I went all out and instead of canned mushrooms, I cooked some fresh in butter and garlic to add even a bit more flavor.  Everyone else seemed to like them alright but for the extra work I think I will go back to my old green beans and mushroom soup mixture and call it good.

Great update to the generic casserole that we are all familiar with... It was a hit at my company pot-luck dinner. I will be making it again for the holidays.

I really altered this recipe to fit what I had in the kitchen. Like some of the other reviews, I used frozen beans and fresh chopped mushrooms. Instead of the processed cheese, I added some leftover cheese and onion dip. Rather than bacon bits, I added chopped chorizo sausage. As I far as I know, you can't easily get french fried onions here in Australia, so I topped it with crushed cornflakes and grated cheese. It tasted really good. I have made it before following the recipe closer and it tasted great that time too!

I made this today as a last minute idea for our Christmas dinner. What a wonderful recipe!  It was quick, easy and I sort of had everything on hand!  I didn't have cut green beans, so I used French Style, and I may have put a bit more than 3oz of Cheese.  But for the most part I stuck to the recipe, and even my sister-in-law who doesn't like green beans, said this was the best green bean dish she's ever tasted.  Thanks for sharing!

I love the traditional green bean casserole, and I love mushrooms.  However, the combination left something to be desired.  My children didn't like it at all; the 17, 19 & 22 yr. old children said I should stick with the usual (the recipe on Durkee's can).  It was something different, though, and I like to try different things.

This is no doubt the easiest & Best green bean casserole dish cooked with ready made items. I used chicken soup(didn't have mushroom) & 8oz of fresh mushrooms (cooked down to remove liquid). It is soooo tastey! Loved it!

"Never enough" is absolutely true, I made a double batch for Thanksgiving dinner and it was gone in a flash!  I took the reviewers' suggestions of using Old English cheese and it turned out great (I was a little hesitant about putting cheese in green bean casserole at all).  Excellent dish, thanks for sharing!

made for thanksgiving- was pretty good, but I'm not the biggest fan of velveeta and i could detect its gooeyness in the sauce.  I'll prob go back to my traditional recipe next time, but it was fun from something different!

I made this recipe last night and it was not to our liking. This is one thing that was wasted in my house and it is nothing that I will never make again. I am going to stick to the original. The cheese is what makes it not to our liking.

This was a GREAT change to green bean casserole, its been a tradition for Thanksgiving. I didn't want gr. beans this year, hubby wasnt going for that. So I tried this and was more than pleased, this was fantastic, so creamy, flavor was great, really wasn't enough for leftovers!! A keeper!! Thank you

I've never had green bean casserole with cheese in it before. So I'm making t my way. I mix one can of cream of mushroom soup with 3 tsp. Worcestershire sauce. I mix my green beans in with the mushroom sauce then place it in a 2.5 liter casserole dish. I buy a big can of the french fried onion rings and put them all over the top of my casserole. I bake it at 400 for about 40 minutes. Tasty every time.

This was a big winner, my family saying they prefer this to the usual green bean casserole recipe. Instead of committing to an entire block of Velveeta that I probably would not get around to using, I subbed in 2/3 of a jar of Kraft Old English Spread, the kind that comes in a 5 oz. jar. Delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving thinking it would be eaten but not loved by the family.  To my surprise, they want me to bring it again to our Christmas dinner!  The only change I made, was that I used Cheesey French Fried Onions (found at Kroger) instead of the regular ones. I definitely think this is better than any other green bean casserole I've ever made or consumed.

Made this for Thanksgiving. 3 hours before dinner was served I doubled the recipe, mixed it all up & put it in the crock pot on low. Let's just say everyone ate green bean casserole this year! Hardly any left after dinner!

I've made many green bean casseroles over the years, but this one definitely stands out as the best!

Tasted great but a there was a little too much sauce.  Next time I'll use three cans of green beans.

I thought this was awesome.  Fresh greenbeans are a must...I softened them in the microwave first to make it easy.  Also used fresh mushrooms that I sauted in the pan before adding the soup. For more flavor I added in an additional cup or so of sharp cheddar.  Also used cheddar fried onions, and they were amazing!  HIGHLY recommend searching out an organic or 'natural' condensed cream of mushroom soup.  I think the one I found made the recipe.

This was pretty good, but for a reason I can't really identify, had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Was it the processed cheese or the store brand beans? I'm not sure. The store brand beans I bought had another problem in that the stems were not all cut off of the beans. Next time, I'll buy a premium brand. Please note that the volume of this casserole is quite small. If you have more than four people to feed or wish to have leftovers, it makes sense to double this recipe.

i did change this a little because i got to work tonight to find out we were going to a bring a dish function. i substituted extra sharp cheddar for the velveeta and fried and crumbled some bacon and used fresh mushrooms. this was a hit! there were about 300 people at this event and more food than ive ever seen and when i went back for our dishes there was alot leftover but this dish was empty... i did notice that several peoples dishes had the recipe attached to the side and next time ill do that because a few people asked for it.

This was fantastic! I served it for Easter dinner and it was a big hit, even among those who claim not to like green beans. The only thing I did different was add smoked Gouda instead of velveta and left out the bacon.

Definitely delish. A little expensive ... for a side dish. I cooked mine in a crock pot and it ended up a tad runny ... had to add more fried onions to thicken it up. Everyone loved it.

I didn't have an oven, so I made this recipe on the stove-top, letting it heat & thicken for about 30 minutes. It turned out great. I added the fried onions just before serving.   A few modifications: I left out the bacon bits but added half an onion and fresh mushrooms. I also used fresh green beans, and the fresh taste was delicious.

I loooove this recipe! I've been using it for Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 2 years and even the pickiest eaters love this recipe! I usually leave the fried onions off to the side and let the people who want them have them since I don't like them.

Since all the ingredients besides the bacon bits and french-fried onions come from a can or are processed, I have to say that was a drawback. I made the recipe exactly how it calls for but if I had to do it again, I'd choose the Old English Cheese instead of velveeta and I'd use 1/2 as many mushrooms. I would also add slivered almonds to the top. But in all honesty, I wouldn't make it again.

The name is so fitting.  This was the first dish we ran out of at our Thanksgiving.  Will be making two of it next year.  Followed the recipe as written except used Cheddar French-fried Onions and baked it for about half the written time before adding the cheddar french-fried onions then returned it to the oven for the remaining time.  Turned out wonderful.

This recipe is delicious! My husband and I decided this will be the new holiday tradition.  The only changes I made was I used about 3 quarters of a package of Krafts 4 cheese mexican cheese (2%) instead of processed, used about 5 strips of bacon chopped and added a half a can of milk (but I think I boiled out the liquids to thicken the sauce).

This recipe was great! After reading some of the reviews I was nervous about adding the cheese but decided to go for it.I'm glad I did. I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My family and friends unanimously said it was the best green bean casserole they ever had. A definite make again.

This is fabulous!  I'm not a fan of the traditional recipe and this is just what I was looking for.  I used about 5 strips of bacon more cheese and mushrooms and added some of the onions into the mix.  We have declared this our new green bean casserole recipe!!!  Everyone who tried it was interested in the recipe.  Thanks so much!

These were great. I sauteed 6 slices of bacon,[chopped] untill lightly browned, added a med. onion,[chopped] till it was wilted. Added two cans of chicken broth. Put about 2 lbs of fresh green beans in the pot. cooked untill they were done. {I like them a little over cooked}. After that was almost all the way cooked,I added 8ozs of fresh sliced mushrooms.Drain.Added four Tbls. of a cheese spread I had on hand with the cream of mushroom soup. Mixeded it all together normally. My oldest daughter had three helpings of it. My husband looked me in the eye and said "These are really good." I don't uaually get that with my regular "green bean casserole recipe." This will be the only one I'll be using from know on. Thanks again.

I'm sad that these turned out poorly for me.  I decided to put them together the night before and bake them on Thanksgiving and that may have been their downfall, so DON'T DO THAT.  On Wednesday, when I mixed everything together (I used fresh steamed green beans instead of canned) and put it into the casserole, it was absolutely delicious.  But after baking them the next day, it's like everything melted and slid off the beans - they were watery.  I also made the mistake of adding too much bacon - seemed like it needed more when I mixed everything but by the time they were baked it was too strong.  I'm giving this a 3 star rating because I don't think it's the recipe's fault - could be my make-ahead strategy that was flawed.  I may try this one again some day.

It sounded great but I wish I hadn't added the cheese.  I double checked my French's traditional recipe and this one, then re-checked the size of the cans of beans.  All were the same amounts so I'm not sure what caused this casserole to be so darned soupy.  I couldn't find the beans in all the mess!  Our plates were left with a pile of the soup mixture as everybody had to pick through it to find the beans.  Way to soupy.  Could have used at least another can of beans.  I won't make this again!

This was good, but nothing outstanding. Mine was a little soupy and I could have added an extra can of green beans to firm it up. I made this casserole just as a side dish for hamburger steaks. I think I will save green bean casserole for a holiday. It seemed weird eating this in October.

This was excellent.  I used a jar of Old English cheese and the pre-cooked real bacon bits.  Next time I will leave out the canned mushrooms though, as a personal preference.

I will never again make that old boring Green Bean Casserole.  This is so much better, I used real bacon and chopped Portabella mushrooms. What a combination it was great!!

Made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  We loved it.  Will definatley make again.  I used real bacon and about 4 oz. Pepper Jack Velveeta for a little bit of spice.  (for the person who said they weren't sure how to measure it... I just guesstimated cutting the loaf.... 1/2 of a 16 oz. loaf is 8 oz. and half of that is 4 oz.)This casserole was really a hit... thanks!

I thought these green beans had a lot of flavor and were tasty, but I didn't like how saucy it was. I prefer more green beans to sauce than more sauce to green beans, so I doubled the green beans but left the sauce amount the same the second time I made this. I liked it much better the second time than the first time. Everyone else liked them too.

I made this for Thanksgiving one year and I'm now required to make it for every Thanksgiving. 

I did make some slight modifications. Instead of bacon bits I fried up real bacon and ripped it into small chunks. I also usually make a double-batch and use an entire 8oz block of velveeta.

Always looking for new ways to mix up old traditions, and had never added bacon / bacon bits before so I decided to give it a whirl. It was exactly the upgrade this old family favorite needed!  Thanks for the idea.

I feel like I shouldn't review b/c I changed this so much, but this recipe idea saved me!  My in-laws asked me to bring green bean casserole and I am SO sick of it and don't ever want to see it at a meal again.  This was a great variation and no one complained that this wasn't the traditional version.  I changed it up by using 1 can of cream of mushroom soup mixed w/ 3 oz velveeta which I poured over 3 cans worth of green beans & 8 oz of mushrooms which I fried in a pan first to get some of the moisture out.  We had it in the microwave first, then it made its way into the oven as space allowed, so I don't  have completely accurate directions there.

This was a very good alternative to the classic green bean casserole.  I used fresh green beans already cooked until tender.  I didn't have any of the French Fried onions, so I omitted them and I used Tastefully Simple's bacon bacon in place of the bacon bits.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce.  I will definitely be making this again in the future.

LOVE IT!!!! Left out the bacon, used real mushrooms instead of canned, used real green beans, and shredded sharp cheddar. I just like the fresher ingredients. just boil the green beans and mushrooms for about 8 minutes before transfering everything to the caserole dish.

It was a little salty, but definitely worth the calorie count. The fried onions I used were flavored so that may have added sodium, but I'm not sure.

I'll probably try this again as written.

I use the crock pot (saves room on the stove) and always double or triple this recipe and still rarely have much left over. I must admit, I rarely measure when cooking (only baking), so it can vary slightly from one time  to the next. Excellent variation on a classic!

I made this recipe yesterday for my family's Thanksgiving.  I usually use the original Campbell's recipe, but I think that this one definitely had more flavor.  Everyone loved the slight cheese flavor and the bacon.  I am not the biggest fan of mushrooms, so I left out the can of mushrooms stems and pieces, and it still turned out great!

Very tasty variation from the canned soup recipe.  Used sharp cheddar instead of Velvetta and lots of fresh button mushrooms sliced and sauteed beforehand.  Very good, enjoyed by all.

I love all the ingredients in this and got great feedback at my potluck today - but agree w/others that this recipe is a bit "saucy" so I'd add extra beans to this. This was tasty! I put this on top of my mashed potatoes and was awesome.

This recipe is so good, I had to refrain from keeping the pan for myself.  I was taking it to my potluck at work, so I used an 8x12 casserole dish, which required me to double the recipe.  It was a success and I will always use this recipe moving forward.

Very good, cooked my own bacon instead of the bacon bits & added Tony's creole seasoning for some kick - such a nice change from the ordinary

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago, now every holiday and pot luck I am asked to make it again.
I have changed it up just a bit though, I use fresh green beans and fresh mushrooms.....YUMMY!

This was a hit!  I doubled the recipe since we were having about 20 people for dinner.  It was gone very quickly!  My kids raved and raved about it and have requested that I now cook this more often than just Thanksgiving and Christmas!  The only thing I did differently was to leave out the extra mushrooms and I used Real Bacon I had fried up and crumbled.  :)

I made a huge batch of this for a family get together and realized that I hadn't bought enough Cream of Mushroom but I happened to have one can of Cream of Chicken so I used it. Everyone absolutely raved about how delicious and creamy it was. I'm not sure if the Cream of Chicken added to it or not but everyone really really loved it!

This was very nice, quick, and easy. The only reason I took away one star was because it was still a basic soup/green bean casserole unlike what was stated in the caption. It should have been described as a cut above your standard green bean casserole, as opposed to "This is NOT your usual plain green bean casserole." This statement was misleading. I also used frozen vs. canned beans. These were very good, but by no means great. It tasted very close to most others. My expectations were much higher based on the captioned statement by the person who submitted this recipe.

My family loved it! I omitted the can of mushrooms and I didn't miss it at all. I really don't like canned mushrooms very much and didn't want to bother with cooking down some fresh ones. I will definately make it again. The cheese and bacon made it so much better than the traditional cassorole. Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  Definitely my new fave green bean casserole.  I used the 5 oz. jar of Kraft Old English instead of Velveeta since I didn't want to buy a whole thing of Velveeta.  Super-duper delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was the disappointment on the table.  It tasted like plain old green bean casserole to me - and I am not a huge fan of that.

I personally dont like green beans or the casseerole but tried this version (after searching through many) to make for others during thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like it, including myself. I believe what makes it better is the cr. mushroom soup.  I also used cheddar fried onions on top instead of regular which gave it a lil more cheesy taste and also used the old english cheese instead of velveeta and bacon- it was delicious! It didnt need any other seasonings other than what was already in it.

I didnt think this tasted too far off from regular green bean casserole.  I didnt really taste the bacon in it so you probably could leave it out or add more.

My husband was determined to find a better green bean casserole- and he did!  Last year at Thanksgiving people were impressed.  He used the old english cheese instead of Velveeta.  It was a hit!  We're making at again this year.

I have made this for a number of holidays and even my non vegetable eaters come back for more.  I always double and sometimes triple the recipe because it goes so fast.  I have substituted low calaorie velveeta and low sodium soup with no one any the wiser and it has still been delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I used a large (50 oz) can of CUT green beans and a small (15 oz) can so added a few tablespoons of whole milk and a little more cheese whiz.  I left out the mushrooms just b/c family doesn't care for them.... this deserves an easy 5 star rating!  Will be adding this to the holiday menu.

My husband's favorite green bean casserole.  Take the time to fry up some good bacon and crumble-always packs a bigger flavor punch than bacon bits.

This is a good green bean casserole, I cooked for some picky folks and they ate it all. I used the Kraft Old English Cheese like some suggested, and I had to leave out the extra jar of mushrooms. I am sure this recipe is great either way. Thank for a yummy side dish.

AWESOME recipe!!  You may be hesitant to change such a classic dish, but don't be... you MUST try this.  The changes are subtle enough that no one notices it's a "different" recipe -- they just comment on how good it is.  I made this for Thanksgiving and had a request to bring it for Christmas too.  The ONLY thing I added was extra beans.  If you're making a double recipe, you can easily add an extra can of beans.  Also, with a double recipe, I just used the 5oz jar of Kraft Old English cheese spread (instead of trying to get 6oz).  Thanks for this one!!

My Daughter always requests Green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. Instead of the usual recipe, I thought I would try this one. The cheese really adds to it so even I enjoyed it. I will be making it again for Christmas. I have to tell you that I cheated with the bacon and used the bacon bits in the bag.

Never had green bean casserole before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I loved it and can't imagine making it without the bacon. Will be using this recipe every Thanksgiving. Thx!

I LOVED this recipe! I served this as a side for my Thanksgiving dinner and got nothing but compliments! It was easy, and could stick it in the slow cooker and forget about it till dinner was ready. Only change I made is I doubled it, and used a 6 oz package of velveta cheese, and used French style green beans instead of cut.

This is the greatest greenbean casserole ever! I usually don't care for them but this one, wow! Instant family fave on holidays or any time. Most of the ingredients are always readily available at my house, making it quick and easy. Good compliment to steak, chicken, or turkey. I can't say enough good things about it, seriously!

Made this dish for Thanksgiving, it was good, but it just seemed like it was lacking a little flavor. I think next time I might add a little sourcream. Other than that these were good

I just didn't think this recipes was that great.  It was too creamy; I tripled the recipes though.  I also used off brand french-cute green beans...may have contributed.  I will try it some other time, maybe, and hopefully it will be better.

Hmmm, well I don't know what went wrong but my dish turned out really thick.  If I make this again I would add a little milk.  The cream of mushroom flavor was all that I could taste.  I have had this dish made by others and I loved it, that is why I gave it 4 stars.

I have never been a big fan of Green Bean Casserole but hubby wanted it for Thanksgiving. So I thought I would try this, the addition of bacon sounded like it would be good. I used frozen green beans (14oz vs 12oz) & freshly chopped mushrooms instead of the canned, but otherwise I left the recipe as is. It was HEAVENLY. Not mushy at all! I am now a green bean casserole fan!

This is my favorite green bean casserole recipe!  The cheese adds so much creaminess and flavor to the dish, and I actually haven't met anyone who hasn't liked this version of GBC!  Also great the next day reheated!

Awesome recipe! I used a 16 oz bag of frozen whole green beans and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Also used light processed cheese and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup. This is the green bean casserole recipe I will be using from now on. Thanks so much for sharing!

I needed to double this recipe since I had to feed quite a few people. It seemed to be pretty runny (even though I drained everything). It was a nice change from the ordinary but it wan't enough to make it 5 stars. I may just keep it the old way (less expensive and less time!!) But thanks...

This recipe was soooo easy to make. And my picky boyfriend loved it.  He has eaten many green bean casseroles, and says it's among the best.  I adjusted the recipe for two people by eyeballing it and it still worked out just fine!!

We all loved it! It was my first time making this salad..and we especially liked the fried onion rings on top after we baked it. I put some garlic and onion powder in the soup sauce to give it some more flavor.

I am not a green bean casserole gal.  I am always asked to make it and have never eaten it once.  When I came across this recipe I thought well, this will be the one I fix this year.  My husband fixed my plate at Thanksgiving and he put some on there so I had to eat it.  This was delicious.  I really did enjoy it.  I doubled the recipe, but only used one can of stems and pieces I thought two would be too much.  I am making it again for Christmas.

I thought this was sinfully delicious. Not an everyday treat because of the mammoth calorie content and the unhealthy processed cheese, but a wonderful addition to the Thanksgiving table.

Very good!  My husband loves green bean casserole and he loved this!  He said it's much better than the normal recipe. He said it tasted kind of like a bacon/cheese/onion burger.

YUM!  I made this for a large dinner party and it was everyone's favorite.  I used the fake bacon bits, though, and it still came out wonderful (although the bacon flavor was just a bit too strong).  This will become one of my regular dishes.

Do yourself a favor and double the recipe!  There truly never enough we fight over it.  I came across this recipe over five years ago and it’s stole the show many times. So much I’ve been handing over the recipe to those who ask. It’s super easy my kids can do it. And everyone loves it.

This was good but I suggest using fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I think it would have been a bigger hit if I used fresh. I also used real sharp cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta which I loved.

So, let's start on the premise that I HATE traditional Green Bean Casserole!  I needed to get this recipe out so those of you who also hate it have an alternative when you're dealing with family at holiday dinners or whatever.
Cutting to the chase, I chopped a large shallot, threw it in a pot with 2 Tbsps (or so) of butter and sautéed it for a few.  I added 2 large cloves of garlic, mashed & chopped, a good splash of dry white wine and let all cook for a few minutes (maybe 5).  I then added a drained can of French style green beans and 1/2 can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup (undiluted), covered it with Italian 6 Cheese (or whatever # of cheese you have in your deli dept) and crushed 1 or 2 strips of cooked bacon over all.  Bake at 350 for 25-30 mins and, by God, it's really good.  I no longer HATE green bean casserole!

This green bean casserole is AMAZING! However, we are a mushroom-hating family, so I substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken soup and omit the mushroom stems, of course. It is a favorite of all who try it!

This has become my go-to green bean casserole.  I do use fresh green beans, which I cut down to about the same size as canned green beans would be, and I steam them until they are almost done, and I use fresh mushrooms, which I slice and sautee.

Good. Had a slightly smoked flavor. Edit: I actually prefer the fake bacos in this. They hold their crunch better.

I used fresh french green beans and white mushrooms. I added some milk to the soup and velveeta to make it just a bit thinner. I used more fried onions for the top than required (full package). It turned out really yummy. A keeper!

I love this! Adding bacon and cheese to this traditional casserole is the greatest idea! I sautéed some onion and mushrooms with a little garlic and added it to the soup mixture which I thinned with a little milk and chicken broth;) Other than that, I followed the recipe, and it was delicious!

This was good, I used a lg jar of home canned green beans instead of the two store bought ones. I think I was the only one in my family that enjoyed it but I'm giving it five stars anyways cause I have picky eaters who don't like anything.

Five star rating from the 16 people that I presented this great dish to at Easter Dinner yesterday. I was a little stressed because I only knew four of the guests personally, and the others were from all over the U.S.

If you are looking for a dish to please men -- this is it! All loved it at my party, but the 18-40 yr old men fought over the leftovers. (IMO - kinda wierd for green beans LOL)

I did use Kraft Old English jars of spread instead of Velveeta, but nothing else was changed.

Also, I would bake at 350F (or 375F) instead of 325F. I have an oven thermometer and it took FOREVER to get the outside edge bubbly at 325F.

Thanks, Deb! Delicious recipe.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving!! I doubled my ingredients for more servings and instead of Velvetta I used 2 jars of Kraft Old English Cheese Spreads. I omitted the mushroom stems because my hubby does not like them. Will def make again!

This is my new favorite green bean recipe! I also used old english cheese and prepackaged bacon bits as I read in another review. The whole family loved it, even our toddler that will not eat green beans!

Loved this casserole, was a nice step up from the usual!  I did use fresh mushrooms, lightly sauteed & did cook 4 slices of bacon and chop it up.  It was great, but now I want to try with the Old English cheese!

I made this for a potluck at work today.  It was the first dish gone and several people mentioned to me how much they enjoyed it.  I did make a few changes.  I left out the bacon because we have a lot of people that don't eat pork.  And stupid Whole Foods does not carry velveeta, so I ended up using pimento cheese in it.  That was surprisingly good!  I doubled the recipe but used 5 cans of beans.  It was plenty creamy, I can definitely see where some of the comments about being too much sauce are coming from.  I did mix some French fried onions in with the casserole as well as topped it with them.

I threw everything together in a crockpot when I got to work and came back to stir it every 1/2 hour or so.  Really pleased how this came out in the crockpot.

I have made this twice, using frozen green beans not canned. The first time it wasn't that great, it was a little bland. The second time I added cubed ham, salt and pepper to taste and it was much much better.

I made this casserole last night for our family's Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit!!! I made a double batch and used 2 large containers of the French fried onions(You can never have enough of that), and only 1 1/2 cans of the sliced mushrooms. The only change i would make is to add more bacon because no one even noticed it was there. Delicous dish!!!!

Everyone loved this dish for Thanksgiving and people were asking me for the recipe. I did everything exactly the same with the exception of using Velveeta. I read previous reviews and used the Kraft Cheese Spread in Old English. I used almost the entire spread and I also used a lot of extra real bacon bits. This is such an easy recipe I could not believe how great it came out.

This recipe is great and so much better than the traditional green bean casserole. My family loves it the only change I make is to add more bacon bits (the recipe calls for enough but my husband is a huge bacon lover). I now take it with me to family dinners and people always ask for the recipe. It is so easy to make.

This dish was very good.  I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out wonderful.  The cheese gives it a very nice flavor.  I did leave out the bacon (just a preference) and it still tasted great.  One note though I would double the recipe if you are cooking for more than two people.

Wonderfully delicious!  Just a kicked up version of the traditional green bean casserole... I do not eat mushrooms and my husband turned his nose up when he realized I was putting them in the casserole... but he still ate it(and thought it was wonderful)!!  I just chopped the mushrooms up pretty good before adding them so that nobody would "freak out" over a large chunk of mushroom!  Like I said... I do not normally eat them but they added such good flavor along with the addition of Velveeta and bacon!  YUM!! Definitely a new Thanksgiving staple!

Delicious!  Using real bacon really adds depth to the  flavor of the dish that isn't in the other recipes.  I used 3 cans of beans and generic cheese (it was 1/2 the price of Velveeta) and it turned out perfectly.  Everyone had seconds!

It was just ok. I used the Old English jar of cheese and added a couple of slices of chopped bacon. I also used fresh mushrooms and frozen green beans in place of canned.  I will not make again as I prefer the original to this.

This was the BEST green bean casserole.  It's a keeper.  The second time I made it I doubled the amount of cheese.  Again, it was delicious!

Not saying that there was anything particularly wrong with this recipe, it just wasn't to my tasting and most definitely wasn't a hit. There was a ton left over. I was looking for something different but I guess you really shouldn't mess with a classic!

I didn't want to use the same old recipe that comes on the can of french onion strips for this casserole. The Velveeta and bacon bits add that extra needed touch to get even the picky younger brother to eat it at Thanksgiving!

OMG! I did'nt expect this to be sooo good. I used french style green beans, but next time I'll use regular cut. The french cut were very thin. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I used this recipe for my first green bean casserole dish. I used this recipe because I thought that it was different and it looked easy to make. I changed up a few things though, I used frozen french cut green beans and frozen corn instead of mushrooms. I cooked the bacon and made it crispy. I also used Kraft Old English cheese rather than the Velveeta cheese. The casserole turned out perfect and it was extremely delicious, my husband loved it. I'm going to make this for Christmas dinner this year.

I think this was a great "beggining" of a recepie I will use for many more holidays. I say beggingin because i made a few modifications. I dont like using canned veggies, so I used frozen french cut green beans and fresh mushrooms. I also added garlic salt but everything else remained the same. Big hit this thanksgiving!

Awesome! I will never make my green bean cass the old boring way again! If I'm in a hurry I use the pre cooked bacon bits and microwave them for about 30 sec to crisp them up and bring out the flavor.I could seriously eat a ton of this dish! very rich and yummy.

I never have been a fan of Green Bean Casserole, so imagine my dismay when I was nominated to make it for Thanksgiving dinner.  I immediately went on a hunt for some way to make it better - when I came upon this recipe.  Of course, I thought it was just "okay" (I'd rather have sauteed or steamed fresh green beans with onions and a little bacon), but the rest of the family thought it was good, and better than the Campbell's recipe.  If I get nominated to make green bean casserole for future Thanksgiving gatherings, I will likely make this recipe again.

I used double the green beans and still felt it was a little too soupy.  Good flavor, everyone seemed to like it.  I think I just don't care for canned green beans.

This was pretty good and I don't like green bean casserole.  I think I will add more cheese next time though.  And I used frozen (thawed) green beans instead of canned.

althoug i didnt care for my recipe, i think this one would get five stars if i had found the right cheese/bacon combo.  i didnt add extra mushrooms cos i thought there was enough in the mushroom soup.  the cheese/bacon cheese i used was crystal farm's cheddar with bacon cheese food and by itself it didnt taste good so i'm not surprised my recipe turned out like it did.  we put cheese on our bean and peas to get the kids to eat them, so i think this recipe is right up our alley.  next time i will try velveeta and bacon bits or regular "cooked" bacon.  thanks! **update** made this recipe again with a jar of old english cheese and it was fantastic!!

I made this with frozen green beans, and then with canned.  I really didnt like the frozen and not many others did either.  The canned seemed better.  I put a lot of the fried onions in the mixture as well as on top.  I dont know, it just wasn't as great as the other reviewers seemed to think.

Made this exactly as written for Christmas dinner and got many compliments. It's close enough to the one we all know so well to satisfy the traditionalist, yet is noticeably a step up (even to the hardest-to-impress person at the table). Will definitely make again - and will replace the old recipe with this one.

This was the best green bean casserole I've ever made.  Definitely better than the old standard on the side of the can of french fried onions!  I did use fresh mushrooms and real bacon and I think it was the right thing to do.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did substitute shredded sharp cheddar cheese for the processed cheese which I think gave it a bit of a better cheese flavor. I will make this again.

this was the only thing that was completely gone after dinner - no leftovers!  we didn't have any "cheese food" for the recipe like Velveeta, but used american cheese slices (which were also labeled cheese food)and that worked out fine.  next time i will double the recipe to have leftovers!! soo yummy!

This was delicious! I used Kraft American cheese slices (one slice per can of green beans) because I forgot to get some Velveeta, but it seemed to work just fine. Everyone gobbled it up! The bacon is a really nice touch.

I've tried a different green bean casserole recipe every year. This is the only one that I will actually repeat again next year! I used swiss cheese. Next year, I will use a little more cheese and at least double the bacon bits, I didn't really taste them hardly in this recipe.

This is a winner in my household, i'm no rachael ray, but I can make a mean green bean casserole.  I used shredded cheese instead and it still turned out outrageously good.  Never will I use the tradional recipe again!!

To me, this was nothing special it tasted no different than your original green-bean casserole. I could not even taste the cheese. I doubt I would ever make this again.

Pretty good. I would probably cut down on the cheese in the future, a little bit too cheesy for my taste. Either that- or I'd add a few more green beans. It was a wonderful edition to our Thanksgiving menu, though!

Wonderful variation on this recipe. My husband is not very fond of GBC but he likes this one. I have not tried it with the bacon yet as I did not have any but even the adding of cheese made a big difference. I will not add the mushrooms as my husband does not like them. I will use this GBC again.

I tried this just to change the regular ho-hum thanksgiving menu.  It was great!  I was a little worried that the cheese and bacon would give the dish a weird flavor, but they did not.  My husband kept reminding me that I need to keep the recipe, because he enjoyed it so much.  I will definately be making this dish again, holiday or not!

Wow!  This is such a nice break from the same ol' green bean casserole.  The bacon pieces and cheese really make this taste great.  I'm sure it will be a hit at Thanksgiving!  I wasn't able to find the bacon/cheese spread but used the Kraft Old English spread...it was perfect.

A nice change to the ordinary green bean casserole.  Tastes very good, but not very good for the waist line.  Something I will splurge on at Thanksgiving!

I made this recipe for part of a New Years dinner and it was well received! The cheese and extra mushrooms were the perfect touch! I would definitely make it again.
