I must disagree with the first reviewer of this recipe.  I found it quite tasty.  Now bear in mind that it is not as good as a real Chicago Italian beef sandwich.  It is however a reasonably good healthy substitute.  After reading the first review I had really low expectations for the recipe but I pressed on as I adore Italian beef sandwhiches and longed for a substitute that would fit in with the healthy lifestyle that I've adopted since I left Chicago for LA.  As the first reviewer noted it smelled great as it cooked.  I left it slow cook for a little more than 10 hours (not much like 10 hours and 15 minutes)  and it was very nicely tender and the flavors of the other ingrediants had penetrated nicely into the meat. I tasted it right out of the cooker and I definitely did not feel like it was bland.   My plan was to eat these sandwiches for lunch this week so I packed up a container of the meat (with peppers, onions and juice), a whole wheat French role, and, yes, a container of cheddar cheese and hot peppers.  I reheated the meat at lunch, put it the French role and covered the meat with the Cheddar and hot peppers - just like Portillos - and took a bite.  I thought it was great.  I will definitely use the other half of the Turkey breast to cook this recipe again.

This smelled really good while cooking, but was surprisingly bland.  My husband added some cheese to his sandwich (melted/nuked briefly in the microwave) to try to punch it up a bit, but ended up not even finishing.  There would have to be some major tweaking to make this work.

This is a great recipe!  If you think this is bland or pasty, then I might suggest checking your cooking times and/or crock pot settings.  In our crock pot, this comes out moist with the consistency of actual italian beef.  Melt a little bit of mozzarella on a hoagie and you have a very healthy alternative to the real deal.  Excellent!

I thought this recipe was really good.  A great way to use turkey breasts.  The meat was so tender, moist and flavorful.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated and put it on an italian roll with shredded cheese.  I've been eating the leftovers all week for lunch.  A little turkey goes a long way with this recipe.

Our family has been trying some healthier alternatives for dinners and this one is a keeper.  My husband is really picky and he raved about this. I did add one tablespoon extra of worsteshire sauce and used red onion. Other people have said this recipe was bland but we did not find this to be the case. Will make this again for sure.

This was OK - a little bland, but not bad. Next time I'll put in a little more oregano and worshire to punch up the flavor some.

The meat was moist but didnt seem to pick up a lot of flavor from the broth. I made a gravy out of the broth and topped the sandwich with that and some mozz.. yum

This was delicious! Next time I would like to try it using beef instead of turkey. I added the bell pepper and onion to the  when I added the turkey breast and beef broth. After it had cooked for 5 hrs, I added the other ingredients except for the gravy, so it had plenty of time to soak up the flavors. I let it cook for the full 10 hours then added the gravy and let it cook another 20 minutes. As soon as my husband took a bite, he said the recipe is a keeper :)

I have made this many times using a beef chuck roast...never turkey. I replace bullion and water with beef stock, add a good sprinkle of salt-free Italian seasoning (in place of oregano), salt & pepper. I then add the peppers, onions, garlic, vinegar, worcestershire in the beginning...not later.  The beef pulls apart after 5 hrs on high. I then add the envelope (or 2 depending on how thick you want your gravy) of beef gravy mix at the end. I serve on Ciabatta rolls with mayo and pepperocini.  Great for a weeknight dinner (with leftovers for the next day) or a party!

This recipe is a keeper.  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Doubled the worcestershire sauce because we like the zing.  I toasted some hamburger buns with some cheese on them in my toaster oven and strained off the extra liquid from the meat.  Made a delicious sandwich.  The meat had a wonderful flavor.  I'll be making this recipe for years to come!  Thank you!
