I prefer a brandy old fashioned, otherwise the recipe is the same. And don't forget the oranges!! I muddle the oranges with the sugar and the bitters, and then add the ice and brandy. It's almost the state drink of Wisconsin.

I don't have sugar cubes, so I had to wing the amount of sugar to muddle with the bitters.  I used Jack Daniel's, and this made my husband very happy!  Thanks!

Try using orange bitters, a couple drops of maraschino cherry juice and one large ice cube to keep it from watering down... and it's perfect. My husband always requests me to make these my special way in the cold months. They key is also to have a good whiskey!

I love a good cocktail. Next to a well made Manhattan you can't beat this.

I tried this with Woodford Reserve Bourbon. I added a dash of Grand Marnier and a dash of sour mix. I loved it!

Very good. Can also substitute simple syrup for sugar cube and water.

This is another recipe which differs in  description from the associated video (wish there was more consistency). Good, but we found adding at least another teaspoon of the maraschino cherry juice (and perhaps another dash of Angostura Bitters) made it smoother.

I’m a booze wimp, so I used 2 sugar cubes in mine, but most love just one. Really yummy. It has become my new favorite cocktail!

I omit the lemon and the cherry and add 4 dashes of orange bitters with 2 dashes of Angostura bitters. Then I burn the edges of the orange rind before dropping into the glass for a little smoke flavoring

I’ve gained ten pounds because of my beloved whiskey sours. I’ve switched to this to save calories. Delicious!
