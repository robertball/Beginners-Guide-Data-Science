Since most recipes tell you to saute garlic for about 30 seconds, I cut back on the time for fear that 5 minutes would turn the garlic bitter.  No doubt about it, this salad does have a kick.  If you're in the middle on spiciness, you may want to add half a tablespoon of the chili-garlic sauce, taste, and then add the rest if you feel you need it.  Same comment applies to the addition of the red pepper flakes.  This is a pretty nice Asian cuke salad, and I definitely liked the flavor of the coriander which is a spice I've not used often.

Tasty and spicy. I mostly followed the recipe except used 1/2 tablespoon of fresh coriander and a teaspoon of organic peanut butter (made from just peanuts) in the dressing instead of chopped peanuts because that's what I had. Next time I will use more of both: maybe a full tablespoon of fresh coriander and a tablespoon of peanut butter (if I don't have peanuts). The peanuts are an important part of the taste. We ate this as a side salad to burgers, and it was very good. I imagine it would also taste great on rice.

I added red onion, chicken, and cooked chow mein noodles. It's so good. The only problem was I didn't have enough for leftovers. I'm going to double it next time so I can enjoy it for lunch the next day as well.

These were okay.  It had a balance issue with it but didn't want to mess with it. I didn't have peanuts so that was the only ingredient missing and also altered the chili garlic.

I made it according to the recipe.  The cucumbers were crisp and the Asian tang was a flavorful change from creamy dill cucumber salads.  We had it with ribs and potato salad.  My husband was not a fan of the Asian flavors and that is why I gave it a 4.  He thought they were too much. So I happily get the leftovers!

I added some pickled red onion and a drizzle of sesame oil. I love the influence of Asian flavors in this type of recipe.

I usually use another recipe on this site for a similar salad, but I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made this one instead. I wouldn't change a thing. It was delicious!

This is very tasty and refreshing! I added a drizzle of sesame oil to boost the Asian flavor even more.

I love Thai and often crave the unique flavors. I LOVED this so much! It's just like the delicious salads at Thai restaurants and with just the right kick.  To turn this into a great meal for my family, I doubled the batch exactly, then added a rotisserie chicken, most of a bunch of cilantro and one very large tomato.  PERFECT! I will definitely be making this again when looking to use summer's bounty of cucumbers!

Too spicy, and I usually like the extra kick. Next time I will omit chili garlic sauce. Kind of quiet too; next time I will add thinly sliced red onion and cilantro. I will also substitute jarred minced garlic for cooking the garlic.

I didn't have Asain Garlic Sauce  and I made my own. Don't skip the peanuts bc it changes the entire dynamic of the recipe.
