This salad is exceptional! I adore the bacon/chicken combo it is super in this salad. Love the crunch of the walnuts. Simply added S&P to the dressing before whisking it up.  I used raw broccoli. Thanks for sharing

Fantastic salad! I don't use sugar, so subbed honey instead. Fried up a whole pkg of uncured bacon and added to the salad instead of sprinkling on top as a garnish. The dressing is perfect! Will make this salad A LOT!! There is a lot, but leftovers will be perfect for lunches.

Great summer salad. I added half a red apple, chopped small, and that extra sweetness added a lot. I put the salad on top of lettuce when I served it.

I thought this salad was very good, with a nice combination of flavors that went very well together.  I even tried some without bacon (GASP!) and found it to be equally as good as the portions that included bacon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, JeriM in Austin, TX!

I loved this salad! But I did change it to one red onion instead of green. Tiny less sugar, add cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.Also sliced hard boil egg on top with a sprinkle raisins on top! What a nice sweetness touch it made! Delicious!

A great discovery! I microwaved the broccoli just enough to leave it still crispy. It's worth the time to fry up the bacon. The combination of flavors was just right!

Made this for dinner one hot night and my wife and son both loved it. Tonight I'm omitting the chicken and adding orange bell pepper and using it for a side with grilled pork loin from this site and mac n' cheese.

I took the suggestion of throwing the broccoli in the microwave for one minute. Also, instead of plain walnuts, I added a craisin/glazed walnut salad topper from the salad section of the grocery store  and mixed in two packages. I grilled the chicken breasts to add a little depth to the flavor.  Turned out fantastic!

I don't use any sugar in my household, so I used a stevia blend instead. I'm also picky with mixing any type of nuts with other foods. But other than that, I actually loved it.

Made it just like the recipe called for. Followed the tip of steaming the broccoli in the microwave for 4 minutes, then chilled it in the fridge immediately after. The salad was tasty.

This was an awesome recipe.  My husband and I loved it.  I cut the recipe in half...grilled 4 boneless chicken thighs lightly seasoned with salt and pepper with my stovetop grill pan.  Used sliced almonds as I didn't have walnuts, and threw in sliced orange pepper and a half a red apple coarsely chopped.  Threw the bacon and the chicken still warm into the salad and ate it immediately.  Will definitely be saving this recipe for future use.

The chicken & broccoli mixture was good. I used chicken cooked with lemon & herbs. Since we have nut allergies, I omitted the nuts and added craisins and half a bell pepper diced and half a cucumber diced.

Excellent! Subbed honey for the sugar by warming up the vinegar slightly, stirring in the honey, then mixing in.  Also added a few cut up dried cherries and a little bit of freshly ground black pepper.

Uber yummy! Made some substitutions: skipped the bacon and added a cup of raisins, used agave instead of sugar and reduced the mayo. My husband (the picky eater) wanted to know what I was going to eat for the rest of the week. A household WIN!!

Very Tasty! How could you go wrong; fresh veges, chicken and bacon- YUM! We had this for dinner and there are no leftovers.
