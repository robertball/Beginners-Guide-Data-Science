Delicious! I didn't alter the ingredients at all; however, I whipped the butter and sugar together for 5 minutes before adding the egg and vanilla. This made for a crispy cookie, not chewy. These cookies are wonderful, and will be made again (and again).

Wonderful. I added a half cup of chopped pecans and cut back on the 1/4 cup of coconut. Iâ€™m certain they would be great as stated.
