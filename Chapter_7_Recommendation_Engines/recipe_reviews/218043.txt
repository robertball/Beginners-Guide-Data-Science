I usually try my best to follow the recipe the first time around. I don't like to make any changes, but sometimes it gets a bit pricey to buy new ingredients you have never used before. I have never heard of the item vermouth. I looked up on the internet to see what it was and what would be a possibly good substitute for it.  I used Sherry instead. I also used only half of what the recipe recommended for lemon juice since it looked like a lot when I was squeezing it into the skillet. I halved the recipe since I was just cooking for myself. Overall, the dish was very tasty and I would definitely make it again. It's a great dish! Also there is no photo?! I uploaded one of mine. :)

Hermosa -  Any good white wine could be used for vermouth. That's what it started as but got fortified a little. What you used would be great also, but a very different flavor. Also to all the citics I see hear, NEVER us COOKING sherry, read the label, it has a lot of other stuff including salt. When it aclls for Sherry, use that, it is a clean taste. Also, for the fresh herb bigots, they do have a good flavor, but should be put in at the end as they don't stand up to long cooking like dried herbs. Pick and choose for what you are making

This is so good!  Even my kids love this recipe ages from 15 to 3! The only change I made was to use chicken cutlets. They cook evenly and quickly.

Totally GREAT.  I cooked my chicken in the George Foreman, and made the sauce in the pan.  I added mushrooms (should have added onion, darn!) and capers.  I did not add the Bay Leaf.   I mixed the pasta with the sauce and added lots of shredded Swiss Cheese. OHHHHHH, so gooooood.  Thank you!!!!!  I cannot wait to make this again.

I made this recipe just about exactly as shown, I only added another teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce up a tiny bit more, I also served this over a bed of whole grain rice medley.  This dish is very yummy, and very lemon-y indeed!  If you like a good strong lemon taste then use 2 lemons, if you think you’d prefer a more subtle lemon taste maybe cut it down to 1!  Overall a very tasty and healthy dish that I’ll make again!

This was great!  Very easy and we served it over angel hair pasta.  My whole family enjoyed this which includes a 2 and 4 year old!  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this tonight with a friend, it was so good the only thing I would do different is use one lemon and one lime. Also, I'm going to try putting mushrooms in it next time. I did what a previous reviewer said to do by putting an extra teaspoon of corn starch in it along with turning up the heat at the end to 6 mins instead of 5 mins I will definitely be making this again, for sure. Thank you for sharing this one. Good job!

Excellent recipe!! This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and college age sons could hardly wait to eat it, as it smelled so good. To the person-Willolyn who rated this recipe 1 star, I used sweet vermouth.  Try making a recipe before rating it please!

Yum! My fiance and I loved this recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the recipe needs some slight modifications (as noted by other reviewers).  One lemon is more than enough.  In fact, next time I make it I will use slightly less lemon juice than one lemon.  I'd also like to recommend leaving the artichoke in larger pieces.  I also recommend serving it on top of a long grain wild rice and brown rice mix.  It was delicious!

It has both the healthy and flavor factors going for this.  With a whole wheat pasta and salad this a perfect meal for a healthy diet.   I used light butter and white wine instead of vermouth since I didn't have it on hand!

Very good chicken recipe! Mt changes were : adding smoked paprika to the flour mixture, one TBS butter combined with one TBS olive oil instead of usung all butter and two TBS of capers. My lemons were small so I added the zest from one of them. The flavors were perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a good recipe as is but it is missing something. The chicken was super tender and I served it over linguine. As others have said 2 lemons do make the dish lemony if you want to cut it down definately use only 1 lemon. Another poster mentioned she'd add mushrooms the next time and I agree with her. There is such a strong lemon flavor it needs to be balanced with something else. I think i'll try mushrooms the next time too. It is a very tender dish. I didn't change a thing when I cooked it for the first time. Maybe a little cayenne, not sure but it needs a little extra something. Enjoy! Thanks for sharing the recipe OP.

I made this tonight and my husband loved it!  I served it over Farfelle pasta.  I also didn't have vermouth and instead used white wine (just a Pinot Grigio I had on hand).  I didn't have lemons so I just used lemon juice, about 4 Tbsps.  Depending on your love for the the lemon flavor you can adjust that.  Highly recommend!

Really liked this recipe.  I added capers for a little added tartness.  Whole family liked it.  Chicken was very tender.

Excellent recipe.  Good for a weeknight.  Followed other reviews - used chicken cutlets in place of boneless breasts and Chardonnay in place of vermouth.

It was pretty "Lemony" with the two lemons but the flavor was great. I added a cup of fresh mushrooms quartered, wow they were great, my wife said I should have added more mushrooms. I cut the chicken breasts in half to make them thinner, for more surface area.  And I browned the heck out of the chicken, I think it added some flavor. I think the prep time is more like 15 minutes. Great Recipe!

One of my absolute favorite chicken recipes from this site.  Don't change a thing -- it is perfect restaurant-quality as is.  Especially use vermouth as the interaction of the vermouth with the artichokes and lemon can't be matched with any other wine (at least for my tastes).

This was way to lemony!!! I don't know that even cutting lemon in half would make it good. We didn't eat one bite. Was looking forward to it :(

I made this recipe last night verbatim and at the end added some sliced mushrooms.  IF I make it again, I'd cut down on the lemon and vermouth.  It had too much of a "bite" for us but everyone cleaned their plate.  I served it with thin spaghetti.

Excellent recipe! Never would have thought of it myself.  I chose to add some capers. I would think that spinach would accompany it well too.

This is a very flavorful dish! My husband is not too crazy about lemon so I only used 1 lemon and substituted balsamic vinegar for the vermouth as I had read on the internet this was a good non-alcoholic substitution. I would definitely try white wine the next time I make this dish. We ate the chicken over brown rice and there was alot of sauce in the skillet to pour over the rice. Delicious!

This turned out much better than I anticipated.  I made some tweaks to it though.  Instead of vermouth, I used a Chardonnay I had already opened.  I added mushrooms and capers and omitted the cornstarch and added a tad more flour at the end.

The sauce was great, but I didn't care for the way the artichokes tasted. I'm not sure if it was the brand or it had just picked up a lot of the vermouth. I used the red vermouth, it didn't state red or white may have also been why. It was very good besides that!!

This was one of my favorite dishes I've ever made.  If you like lemon flavor, you'll love this!  It's very easy and the only changes were substituting white grape juice for vermouth and I added onions with the artichokes, which was really, really good.  I'll be making this over and over again!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry, I did not like this dish. Way too artichoke-y, too much sauce, the chicken would have been better if in bite size pieces and the prep time was not 5 minutes as stated. I won't make it again.

This was dee-licious..The only change I made was using white wine in place of vermuth- I used a pinot grigio- Served it with rice and vegetables and I will be serving it many times in the future.The taste and texture were perfect- As good as any dish you could order in any * * * * * restaurant..

It was good, but a lot of work for what you got from it.  For that much work, I'd want more than just the meat portion of my entree.

I don't normally rate the recipes, but I had to comment on this one.  I am always looking for great recipes for chicken and found it in this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  The sauce is so good; even my kids loved it.  This is definitely going into my meal rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a couple of changes based on experiences with similar recipes - I sliced the chicken instead of leaving it whole, and browned it without any breading (breading will just get soggy in the sauce). I served it over whole grain spaghetti and it was pretty good. I think it would be better with more sauce; I'll make it again and double the sauce ingredients.

Made this recipe exactly as stated with one exception. I used two tablespoons of cornstarch as other reviewers suggested to thicken the sauce a little more. My family said it was okay but didn't mind if I ever made it again (which I won't because it was quite time consuming).

Loved this! Couple adjustments--Used only 1 lemon, 1 Tblsp. worcestershire, sweet vermouth, chicken tenders, also added 1 chopped shallot, & 3 oz chopped pancetta (best addition for sure). Served over angel hair pasta with side of steamed spinach. A new family favorite.

I have made this several times now and we really like it! I only use the juice of one lemon (just my personal taste). I am not big fan of white meat so I cut off the tenderloin, filet the breast, and then pound them thin with a meat mallet. The chicken is fork tender cooked this way! It is wonderful served over Jasmine rice or angel hair pasta. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was awesome!!! The only change I made was to use white wine for the vermouth and I used cutlets so I cut down the simmering time to 10 minutes then took chicken out of the pan to mix in the artichoke and thicken with  the cornstarch. I love lemon so it was just right for me, I only had one lemon so I used the zest also. I'm on dialysis and have to watch my salt intake and this was a wonderful...healthy and tasty. Will definitely makes this again!!!

It was ok. I agree with other users that less lemon is needed. I do not know if it was all the lemon, or the artichoke hearts (it was my first time having them), but the sauce was not very tasty. It seemed off, and I couldn't pin-point why.

This was certainly "lemony" and even more so since I zested one of the lemons and used that !  I agreed with another review who said there wasn't a whole lot of sauce - I might try to increase it to more next time as I served it over rice.  I used Pinot Gregio.  This is a fun recipe to play with - next time I'll try some capers or mushrooms or both !!
My husband loved this dish !

This was a very nice change of pace dish for us.  I wanted to prepare something light, lemony, and springy, and this fit the bill.  I used good sized chicken tenders, and pounded them flat, which decreased the cooking time.  I added some pepper and oregano to the four, and a touch of olive oil to less butter to saute.  I made the sauce as published, but did decrease the lemon to one, as my lemon was good sized and figured I could add more if needed.  This doesn't make a ton of sauce, next time I would double or triple as it is delicious and great over the angel hair.  I think I'll add capers next time too for a touch of color and bite.  Maybe some fresh parsley, too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us Gurtrug, I enjoyed preparing it.

I thought this was great.  I'm going to try it again without the Worcestershire tonight, i wasnt crazy about the 'bite' it gave.  My husband commented that it looks like we were eating at an Italian bistro.  I served it over angel hair, and spooned a bit of the sauce over it.

I have to do 5 stars.  My husband wanted this twice the week I first made it.  I am now making it a 3rd time in 2 weeks.  Not our usual pattern. The second time I made the recipe I used chicken fillets, for little pieces of chicken in the pasta, but much preferred the whole chicken breast.  We didn't find it to be too strong a lemon taste.  We love lemons.  It is called lemony chicken and that is what delivers.

Very yummy! I am a huge fan of lemony dishes. This one is fantastic! It does have a strong lemon flavor so if you're looking for a more mild lemon flavor, I would suggest cutting down to one lemon, otherwise the recipe is perfect! My hubby gave it the go ahead to make it again :)

I liked this recipe but its probably one I won't make again.  I felt it was a lot of work for not that amazing results.  It was good and we all enjoyed it, but just not enough for me to make again.  I had all the ingredients except for vermouth.  I used white wine instead.  The overall dish had a good lemon flavor, not over powering.  I felt it needed something though.  Another review er suggested capers and I think that may do the trick.  I served this over whole wheat pasta.  It was a nice meal.

This recipe was great! I disagree with previous reviews that it is too lemony. Next time I will be adding more wine and more lemon. I served this over angel hair and it was delish. Looking forward to leftovers this evening.

The chicken was tender and even tho I used only 1 lemon, it had a very strong lemon flavor.  Most likely will not serve again.

This was easy to make and the chicken came out very tender.  Unfortunately no one in our house cared for the sauce at all.  I think 2 lemons' worth of juice is way too much.  It was over-the-top tangy.  Won't be revisiting this one.

This is so delicious! The first time I used an artichoke medley with roasted red peppers and green olives and it was absolutely perfect! The second time, I didn't have any artichokes, so I used cream of mushroom. They both tasted yummy!

Only sub I made was chunks of boneless skinless chicken thighs for the breasts...made for "Dinner on the Grounds" for church...of course, not many are willing to try something different, but those that did ate every bite.  I'm personally glad I had a few leftovers to bring home as they're dinner tonight.  Absolutely delicious...even after standing almost 2 hours before serving.  Perfection when served immediately.  Bravo!!!

This chicken was good, but too lemony for my taste, and I love lemon. My two lemons made 2/3c. lemon juice. Also, the cooking time seemed off for 4 chicken breast "halves" (two breasts cut in half). I skipped the last 15 minute cooking time & it was cooked just right, tender & juicy. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

This turned out wonderful and was great left over as well the next day. We used boneless skinless chicken thighs and white wine instead of vermouth. The only other change was that after reading some reviews cut the worchestire sauce to about 1/2 tsp. We served it over healthy vegetable spagetti. We did not think using 2 lemons was too much, but we happen to really like fresh lemon flavor.

This was good.  I added more garlic to suit my family's taste, used fresh basil and only one lemon.  Didn't have vermouth so I substituted white wine.  Served it over rice.  I thought the chicken could have cooked a little less, it was slightly dried out.  The sauce was delicious though.  Thanks for sharing!

This sounded great especially after I read the reviews, but we were not pleased with this at all. The sauce was WAY too lemony. Maybe I'll try this again and cut the lemon to just one.

I really wanted to like this more but I can't agree with the worcestershire sauce. I just felt that it overpowered the sauce.  I remade it without and it was very good. I added mushrooms also.

A light, refreshing dish that has big flavor.  Served over steamed white rice that got drenched in this simple, but delightful sauce.  Lemon, sherry (no vermouth at hand) and artichoke go wonderfully together and produce a flavor complex enough that did not bore.  This is a great sear, flood and simmer dish.

This one is definitely a keeper.  I didn't have vermouth so substituted white wine but made no other changes.  Served with angel hair as suggested, but would also be great over brown rice.  Very, very good.

i always read the reviews before i try a recipe.  this one had great reviews. unfortunately i found it very lemony, strong and unpleasant as i tasted it throughout.  we love lemon!  i cut the chicken cooking in half which was perfect.  i had to add about 4 T sugar to make it not as acidic or ??? as it tasted at the beginning.  it ended up ok.  my guest agreed.  i have 2 criteria - wud make again or wud not make again.  this wud be the latter.  however, i do bow to those who love this recipe.

I followed this recipe quite closely, with a few changes.  I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves, and used probably a pound and three-fourths.  I browned the chicken in a combination of butter and olive oil, rather than butter only.   I doubled the sauce, except, thankfully, the lemon.  If I had doubled the lemon, the whole thing would have been inedible.  As it was, the lemon was on the edge of overpowering.    The sauce was a nice consistency, but the basil was also a little overpowering.   There was a lot of flavor to this dish but not a lot of depth.  It’s possible I’ll make it again but right now I don’t plan to.

This recipe needs adjustments. It is too tart with lemon juice. I made it exactly as written and it was tart yet needed more spice. If I make this again I will add a little onion and less lemon juice.

Wow this is lemony! I think adding water chestnuts or mushrooms would help soften the punch. My husband and I liked it but not my 9yr old. Not sure I'll make it again.

A perfect meal!  Quick.  Easy.  Delicious.  I used thighs and breasts to satisfy all.  Served over pasta made it a complete meal.  Added pimento for color.

This has been a go to recipe for years now. Lately we've been cutting down on carbs so I serve it over spaghetti squash and the texture combo is awesome!!

I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breast halves. Since they were fully cooked after browning in the pan, I removed them to make the sauce so they didn't dry out, then returned them to the pan after the sauce had thickened. I also added 1/2 a diced onion as the sauce cooked down, as one of the comments recommended. I also sub'd white wine for the vermouth. Served it with steamed green beans. The whole family really enjoyed it - even the toddler people. Great healthy dish.

My family of six has been eating this at least once a week for years.  We LOVE it.
I use only two chicken breasts and triple the sauce (except 3 T of lemon juice, not tripled).  We never have any leftovers and even my kid who doesn't like artichokes loves this recipe.  We serve it over rice and it's pretty low calorie. Some of us put on a little Frank's Red Hot.

I use capers and leave out the vermouth.  I also serve it with rice  instead of pasta and use the sauce to moisten the rice.  A good weeknight meal.

I got lots of positives from the adults on this meal. The toddlers were all about the egg noodles side dish.  I did add a little zest of the lemons to the sauce - don't do that. It was on the verge of too lemony.

Light, healthy and easy. Kids did not care for it but the adults enjoyed it. Served over pasta. Did not use flour. Instead chopped chicken into bite size and cooked with olive oil until no longer pink. Added celery salt and dash of tarragon to add more flavor. Also used white wine and lemon pepper spice. Did not have lemons so used 3 small limes.

Sauce was really good on the chicken, but when also put on the noodles, there was way too much lemon in the taste.  If I were to make it again, I would reduce the amount of lemon in the recipe

I think it's good but my hubby thought it was great. I had to add more salt because it was a little bland to me.  Also added some red pepper flakes and mushrooms. Used white wine instead of vermouth.  Served it over rice.

This was a great recipe!  My husband loved it, and so did I, since it was fairly easy to make.  After reading other reviews I only used the juice of one lemon, and it was perfect.  I put the sauce in a gravy boat and served the chicken with brown rice.  We ladled the sauce over the chicken and rice.  Tasty!  This is a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe.  The second time I made it I doubled it so I could freeze meal sized  portions.  Even though I am retired I am very busy so like to be able to take my meal out of the freezer to save time.  I cut my chicken into small pieces and browned them and set them aside and just added back to the sauce and simmered long enough to cook.  The chicken was very juicy and not dried out.  I used the two lemons when doubling as found two were a bit much for the smaller recipe.

Never been impressed with enough recipes to bother rating them, but this one is TERRIFIC!  My husband usually adds tons of pepper to any dish, but he wasn't even tempted to with this one.  Used only 1 lemon.

I like this dish a lot. My 6 yo daughter did not - mostly based on the appearance of it on her plate though. I did add some mushrooms and used marinated artichoke hearts. I also used white wine in place of the vermouth since I don't have any. I love how healthy this is and the flavors came together nicely.

made this tonight and everyone liked it, I hate to rate and change the recipe but the only change I made was to do one lemon, I will make again. As for those that said the worcestershire was to much I have to say you didn't even taste it. I also used a sweet vermouth as the recipe didn't say which one to use.

I made this for a friend that was asking for a home cooked chicken dinner.  I served it over rice - we both really enjoyed it.  This is one I will be using on a monthly basis.  It also freezes and reheats very well.  I did make a few alterations to the recipe:

 - switched a semi-dry white wine for the vermouth
 - deleted the bay leaf (I did not have one)

I served the dinner with the same wine - Yummy!

My family raved about this dish. Mostly followed receipe with 1 lemon instead of two. Added mushrooms and artichoke bottoms, no leaves. It was fabulous. Sliced sourdough and oh yes used white wine instead of vermouth.  Love this dish! Thanks for sharing~

This recipe combined three of my wife's favorite flavors, Artichokes, lemon juice and Worcestershire.
She loved it, I used white wine instead of vermouth and I think next time I'll use a little less Worcestershire.

This is great! I added crimini (baby Bella) mushroom slices the last 10-15 mins and capers the last 5 mins. I love artichoke hearts so used TWO cans. Used Gewürztraminer wine as that's what was handy- very good! Used both lemons. I can't think of anything it "needs"- had excellent flavor! Also, I'm a celiac so I used a gluten free all purpose flour for coating the chicken.  I could probably do without the worcestershire sauce, only because I don't really like it, but that's not a fault of the recipe, just a personal preference.

This was really good.   I added some capers.  Next time I will add a few mushrooms.  My partner loved the sauce!  I liked how quick & easy it was to prepare.  We had it over egg noodles since we didn't have any angel hair.  Also, next time we think it will be really good over rice.

I made this recipe to the T except that I used white wine instead of the vermouth.  I really did not like the worcestershire in this recipe, I really did not see the point in this light recipe to use this ingredient.  Other than that I will make this again.

My family would have liked this more if it were a little less lemony.  I used 2 lemons and it was still too much.  I will try it again with 1 lemon.  I also just used white wine and it worked perfectly fine.  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  We served it over brown rice and had a very healthy meal.

I made this the other night and very pleased with the results.  I change, reduce or add ingredients based on our taste . For example I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, I  added chopped onions and fresh mushrooms, lots of garlic, some of the juice of the artichokes , switched the vermouth to white wine and reduced the lemon to one, 2 cups of chicken broth, and 1 tblsp of worcestershire sauce and served over fettucine.  Definite keeper.  might try sherry next time instead of the wine.

This dish is absolutely deeeelish!  Next time I think I will cut back on the lemon juice.  Other than that it was fantastic!  Lots of flavor.  I did add some mushrooms and some capers and served it over a bed of linguini noodles.  We ate it so fast, I forgot to take pics!

My husband made this with mushroom instead of artichokes- because he forgot to buy them when he went shopping!  Too bad because he loves artichokes.  This came out great...and my husband is not one to follow recipes.  My son and I were surprised how tangy it was but not too much.  Baked potato and salad and dinner was a hit.  Kitchen didn't look like a disaster either.  Dare I say...so easy a husband ....Thanks.

This is a very flavorful dish! I didn't have ckn breasts, so I made it with chicken thighs - I just allowed it to cook longer until the thighs were cooked through. The ckn was tender and the flavors robust. Next time I make it I'm going to add some mushrooms.

I loved this dish! I served it over herbed spaghetti squash (healthier than pasta), which I think made it even better.  My husband enjoyed the dish, too, and was so impressed, I think that I've converted him to spaghetti squash. Great!

I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for one, and I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves and white wine in place of the vermouth.  Because the tenders would cook much more quickly than breasts, I just browned the tenders and kept them warm while I made the sauce, then added the tenders at the end for about 10 minutes.  The chicken turned out moist and tender, but I did not care for the sauce.  I found it too lemony and also the Worcestershire sauce was too pronounced for my taste.  Also, after I added the cornstarch mixture, the sauce became too thick so I thinned it with more chicken broth.  I used 1 lemon since I was making a half recipe, but perhaps the lemon juice should be measured in teaspoons or tablespoons.  Next time I'll reduce the lemon juice substantially and omit the Worcestershire sauce.  Sliced sauteed mushrooms would be a nice addition, I think.

Great dish! I only had artichokes in olive oil but artichokes in water would definitely be preferred.  I will definitely make it again.

This dish was amazing and tasted very gourmet. My family loved it. I served it over a bed of angelhair. The sauce got absorbed into the pasta after it sat, so if you want it for leftovers, I would keep the chicken and sauce separate. I didn't have vermouth, so I used Chardonnay which was perfect. The chicken could have been more flavorful, so next time I will season it with salt and pepper rather than mixing salt in with the flour so that it gets more evenly flavored. I plan on making this again.

Very good! You could adjust the amount of lemon juice, if you wanted a little less "lemmony".

Chicken was tender...but the flavor....not so much. It was a lot of work for not such a great dish. Thank you for the recipe but I will not make this again, and I am not a picky eater at all. Just not to my liking. The lemon was perfect as directed, but maybe to much vermouth? I don't know. Props though for so many who like it!

Because so many reviews stated that this dish was too lemony, I used only one lemon and we could not eat this - and I love lemon!  I added some honey to it, melted some butter to put on another dish of pasta, and we were able to eat the chicken.  What a waste!
