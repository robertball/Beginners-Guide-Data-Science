This is a pretty yummy recipe if you happen to like cauliflower and want to eat healthy. I cooked my florets in low-sodium chicken broth.  I didn’t want it to be so liquidy that I could pour it from a blender so I used my potato masher and hand mixer, and them mixed in some mushrooms sautéed in vegetable oil. I have to say that if what you’re looking for is a healthy version of mashed potatoes, this is not it. My boyfriend put so much salt and butter on his “to make it taste like something” that I probably should have just made the potatoes and spared myself the dirty looks haha.

These were very good!  I used them to top a shepherd's pie and my hubby gobbled it up without comment on them tasting different from what I usually make.  When he was almost done eating I told him and he couldn't believe it!  I could tell the difference, but then I already knew.  He has a very picky palate so I was waiting for him to say something, but no.  Great way to enjoy "potatoes" without the carbs!  Oh, I cooked my cauliflower on the stove in chicken bouillon and added garlic powder to taste plus mincef dried onion, a bit of parm cheese and topped my casserole with a little shredded swiss.

I made this for our health center's healthy holiday eating potluck. Everyone loved it, and people thought it was mashed potatoes. I didn't find it too "garlicky" at all.

I know a lot of people love using mashed cauliflower as a substitute for potatoes- I am not one of those people.  Although the consistency may be close, the flavor is sweeter than potatoes.  I can't judge this recipe based on that fact, though- as far as mashed cauliflower recipes go, this one is pretty good.  Just know that it won't pass as potatoes.  The sautéed onion and garlic were a nice addition.

I adjusted the recipe to accommodate a pound of cauliflower, and it turned out sickeningly garlicky. As is, I only rate it two stars, but with much less garlic it could score higher. I had to add sugar to it just to eat it.

Add some freshly chopped chives and black pepper, my kids really liked it.  (Nice with a meatball & tomato sauce dish.)

09.08.16 ~ I made this to go with a meatloaf that I made for someone recovering from a fall. I used 10 oz. fresh cauliflower rather than frozen. The taste is nice, but the texture was a little less creamy then what I was hoping for. I will make them again, using chicken broth rather then the water and adding a little more liquid, if I need to. All-in-all, a nice change from mashed potatoes.

I made the recipe as stated.  Pretty low on flavor, but liked the texture and healthy eating alternative.  Would probably make again and get more creative with the spices.

This was a nice optional way to serve cauliflower and the texture was nice and creamy like potatoes.  I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt as that was what I had and it did not seem to make a difference in the taste.  I also added some Parmesan cheese because of my own taste preference.
