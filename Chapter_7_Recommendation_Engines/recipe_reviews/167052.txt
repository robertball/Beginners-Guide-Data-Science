It’s painful for me to give this recipe a 1-star rating, but necessary as written, even tho’  it has the potential to be a great dish.  First of all, the amount of butter and garlic is WAY overkill. Throw that amount aside and use your own judgment – a little butter, a little garlic and a squeeze of lemon.  Then… 40 minutes to cook fish? If you want great, golden color and perfectly cooked fish bake it at 400 degrees for 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your filets. And don’t bother to turn it! Not only is it unnecessary, you risk breaking it apart!  I sprinkled the fish with paprika before baking for additional color, and fresh, not dried, parsley after.  Also, I didn’t use tilapia (because I really hate it – tastes muddy to me).  I made this with grouper, although any mild-flavored white, flaky fish would work – like cod, haddock, flounder or orange roughy.  This dish, with the above changes, was much improved  - nicely done, great color and appropriately seasoned.  Just as with a good steak, if you’ve got a good piece of fish it really needs nothing more than salt, pepper and, with fish, a little lemon.

This is an interesting concept.  I've tried most other tilapia recipes on this site and find them to all either be too similar, too complex, or not my style.  40 minutes @ 375 is WAY too much though.  I could already tell just by my experience with baking tilapia and reading other reviews.  I tried 35 minutes @ 350 and still found it to be too much.  I don't think I'd lower the temp anymore though.  I might try 350 @ 30 minutes next time around.  I added 2 tablespoons of prepared dijon style mustard based on some other shrimp scampi recipes I've tried and enjoyed.  I think this gave it a more interesting flavor.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of white wine.  I like others only flipped the fish once... at the 20 minute mark.  I also placed about 3/4 of a pound of uncooked medium sized shrimp in there with the tilapia and took them out at the same 20 minute mark that I flipped the fish at.  They were an 'appetizer' and they turned out perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I'd probably give the original recipe a 3/5 but based on the unique concept and potential I give it 4/5.

Great recipe! I rated this a 4 because when cooking the fish for @ 375 degrees 40 mins, turning it every 10 mins like directed, it was a little dry. Next time I may cook @ 350 degrees instead of 375 degrees

Very tasty recipe. I rated a four rather than five because the cooking time is way off. I set the timer for 30 minutes because 40 just seemed too long. The fish was completely cooked in under 25 minutes. I'm glad I checked it when I did or it would have been dry. I did not turn the fish, either. It isn't really necessary and can lead to breakage.

This was quite good, although I made a few minor adjustments. I cut the amount of butter in half to reduce the calories and used the juice from one lemon to keep the liquid amount about the same. I didn't have whole garlic on hand, so just used the refrigerated minced kind.  The flavor was wonderful and there was still a good amount of sauce left in the pan even after reducing the butter. I would give it 5 stars, but since I felt the need to make those modifications I'm going with 4.

This. Was. AWESOME!!! Super easy and super good. Only change I made was that I added a couple of glugs of white wine. Also, I didnt flip it at all and only had to cook mine for about 20 minutes. Super good over some angel hair pasta. Yum!!

Really good! I cut the butter down significantly and it turned out just fine. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes, only flipping once (I didn't want to risk them falling apart). Thanks! :)

I was worried because I was doubling the recipe - cooking for 7 people - and I only had four cloves of garlic. But I made it and it is SO GOOD that I can't stop eating it! There isn't going to be any leftovers! By far the best recipe I've found so far. Nice and light and doesn't cover up the delicate taste of the fish. Excellent!!!!

Made this tonight.  Absolutely easy!  One of the easiest recipes for scampi I have found.  We added about 15 shrimp to this to have some variety in seafood, added about 1 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning, and the whole dish turned out fantastic.  Appreciate the recipe.

My family loved this recipe.  It is very easy and quite tasty.  How can you go wrong with 3/4 C butter?  I did make it on the stove instead of baking it.  I melted the butter, sauted the garlic added the lemon juice and tilapia.  Covered and simmered until the fish was flaky.  Oh, and added a splash of white wine.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

I kind of adapted this to my tastes a little. I only flipped the fish over once. Twenty minutes into baking after turning the fillets over I sprinkled them with a bit of lemon pepper seasoning. Five minutes prior to the last five minutes of baking I added fresh tomato for color and a little extra flavor. This was an awesome recipe and super easy!

This was very good. I was in a hurry and wanted something quick and easy. I used ½ cup butter & 1 tablespoon olive oil, and one lemon. Baked 350° basted only once no turning was necessary.

Great recipe idea!  I took a few of others suggestions - cut the butter to 1/2 cup, added 1 Tbsp dijon and 2 Tbsp white wine.  I also minced the garlic instead of cutting in half (we LOVE garlic) and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top when it came out of the oven.  Added 1 lb of shrimp and cooked at 350 for 20 mins and it was PERFECT.  My 2 yr old and 6 yr old ate it so fast I don't think they even took a breath, LOL.  Definately a keeper!

This was fantastic.  I made a few changes after reading other peoples reviews.  I used 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of lemon juice (we love lemon juice in my family), minced the garlic and heated it in the microwave like the recipe called for.  Poured over the fish, covered with foil and baked at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. I didn't turn it because I was afraid that it would break apart.  It was delicious, flaky and my kids LOVED it.  Can't wait to try this same recipe on other fish.

This recipe was very nice although I kinda branched out a bit! There's nothing worse than a mono-flavor fish in my book and the lack of spices scared me. I seasoned with old bay and adobo and melted butter before baking. I did use the garlic butter to flavor the pasta tho and it was delish. i didn't have a lemon so I used an orange (juiced) and as a garnish. I also had this a bit spicier and ate that with a cinnamon alfredo to balance it off.

This was super simple and easy. I don't have much time with a 5 year old and a 5 month old. I didn't have the time to turn these every 10 minutes and the fish was just fine without turning it. This is a recipe that I will keep in my kitchen or a long time.

This was delicious.  I reduced the recipe to 3 servings, but used 4 fillets and used the juice of one whole lemon.  I also added some sliced green onions into the butter mixture while I microwaved.  Served with steamed broccoli and some low-carb Dreamfields spaghetti with the extra sauce spooned over the top.  My roommate and I both enjoyed this meal.  She said it reminded her of Olive Garden's scampi.  What a compliment!

Cooking time was WAY off! Only took 20 mins. I used italian seasoning instead of just the parsley. I dont think all that butter is necessary inless you are having it on top of pasta or rice. We are trying to eat low carb so next time Ill cut the butter down. Since I love garlic this was perfect!

I used 5 cloves of garlic and since I didn't have parsley I sprinkled some dried basil and dried marjoram over the filets.  I also added sea scallops to the same dish and cooked them alongside the fish at 350F for 20 minutes, then flipped the fish and continued cooking for another 10 minutes. Turned out amazing!

I didn't care for this recipe - it needs "something"...more lemon, maybe?  Or some white wine to give it some tang?  Some herbs?

I really enjoyed the basics of this recipe. However, I had to add my own modifications because I really like my flavors. I added ground pepper, and garlic and onion seasoning to the butter/lemon/garlic mixture. I also seasoned my filets with a few dashes of garlic powder and Cajun seasoning. The cajun kind of adds a slight punch to the overall flavor. And to top it off, I put lemon ringlets on the top of my filets to enhance the flavors. I only cooked them for like 20-25 minutes on 375. If I would've left them in longer, the fish would have been dry! I also never flipped them because that breaks apart the fish.

Amazing! Added little extra lemon, did half margarine/half butter, 4.5 over flowing (not heaping) tsps jarred, minced garlic w/juice, a couple pinches of cayenne and followed rest of recipe. I've made it twice now- second time I added shrimp as well. Husband and I both really enjoyed it on pasta with broccoli. You won't be disappointed if you're a scampi lover! Mmm mmm!

We LOVED this recipe with a couple tweaks that I took from other reviewers.  I give my tweaked version a 5 star rating!

I only used 1 stick of butter in with the fish and two very large cloves of garlic sliced.  I also used fresh parsley from my garden and added about 1/2 cup of a sweeter homemade white wine.  I baked at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes without turning.  

Since I planned to serve over angel hair pasta, I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough "sauce".  In a saucepan, I added about another 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 stick of butter, about 1 teaspoon of dried parsley flakes and a little garlic powder.  Once baked, I added this to the sauce from the fish.  This dish turned out to be a very nice, light delicious option for Tilapia and is a definite keeper.  My family LOVED it!!

Yumm, I added a splash of white wine. I will make it in a saute pan on top of the stove next time, to make a bit thicker sauce. Delish! Quick, and easy. Thanks for the submission

Yumm! This was so delicious! Great recipe! Due to a few personal preferences, I added a couple pinches of dried oregano, a scant amt. of red pepper flakes, and a bit of white wine to the butter/garlic sauce. I only use margarine, but it was still an outstanding and tasty meal! I baked this for 20 minutes @350. Next time, I'll add even more lemon juice because I love it. Thank you JasnsWif for a truly delicious dining experience.

i dont know how i feel about this recipe. i used fresh parsley instead of dried, and even put in more lemon juice than it called for. as well as putting lemon pepper on it before cooking! i still felt like it was bland, and i didnt taste any of the lemon juice. it wasnt horribble, but it wasnt amazing either!!  definitely not my favorite tilapia recipe, not sure if we'll make again!!

Thanks for sharing, I was kind of weary about how it would taste or come out because of the simplicity. I'm glad I gave it try anyways because it was so delicious!  The whole family gave it thumbs up! Simple and yummy!

I made this recipe (altered slightly) for dinner last night.  This was a decent place to start.  I rubbed the tilapia with lemon pepper on both sides and placed into a greased baking dish.  I took half a stick of butter and melted it and then added about 4 TBSP of lemon juice.  I added about 1 teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of parsely (for color), and about 1/2 a TBSP of garlic powder.  8 TBSP or cloves of garlic would have been WAAAYYY too much!  I poured this on top of the fish.  I also only cooked the fish for between 15 to 20 minutes at 400 until it flaked and did not flip it.  I did baste it with the butter sauce about halfway through cooking.  You do NOT want to flip tilapia as it cooks because it is a delicate white fish and WILL wall apart easily.  Cooking it for 40 minutes WILL dry it out!  DO NOT DO THIS!!!  With the changed I made this recipe was 5 stars, as written the best I could give it was a 3 (being generous!).

Very good and very easy!  I reduced temp to 350 after 20 min, was done in 30 min.  Next time I will start at 350.  Hubby loved this, didn't even use the tartar sauce that he puts on all fish!

I only used maybe 1/2 cup butter, but increased the lemon juice significantly. I also skimped on the garlic as I was afraid 8 cloves would be way too strong, so I used 4 tbsp of the refrigerated mined garlic (equal to 4 cloves) Only required 20 minutes of cooking time with no flipping, tried to flip one of the filets at 10 minutes and it fell apart so i just left them alone for the remaining 10 min. Served over lightly buttered wheat noodles and garnished with lemon rings and fresh parsley and the flavor was very good, but couldnt really taste the garlic. Next time I will try the suggested amount, or try fresh garlic cloves instead of the refrigerated kind.

My family loves scampi also, and I love easy. Tilapia is very mild, so the whole family will eat it since it isn't 'fishy'. I love this recipe. Moms, I HIGHLY reccomend this for your "I don't like fish!" kids.

This really couldn't get any easier and it's quite tasty too.  I made 7 tilapia filets and used a little less than 1/2 a cup of butter.  I would probably use the full amount next time for that amount of filets.  The cooking time is WAY off like other reviewers said.  I cooked at 350 for 20 minutes and flipped once (although next time I probably won't bother flipping at all).

This was very good! Even my 9 year old ate it up! I only gave it four stars because I found it almost impossible to flip the fish without it falling to pieces. I opted not to flip and it still turned out yummy!

This had to be the best scampi sauce I've ever had.  It was quick, easy and tasted wonderful.  I've tried it twice, once with fish, and the other time with shrimp...both times excellent!!! Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I added lime juice instead of lemon, and probably used more than 11/2tsp.  I didn't have any parsley, but added a few halfed cherry tomatoes.  I also added a few shrimp close to the end of the cooking time.  I will be making this again!

This recipe is awesome. I changed it a bit by making it a stove top pan seared seasoned tilapia, with less butter, adding olive oil and a splash of lemon and white wine. Finish with parsley. Quick and delicious.

Amazing! The only thing I changed was I used refrigerated minced garlic since that is what I had on hand and I did adjust the cooking time/temp. 350 for about 35 mins turning only once. It was so
Good! Perfect as written!!

We LOVED this. I kept the ingredients more or less as stated. I think I probably added in a lot more garlic because I used some jarred garlic I had, which is a lot less potent. I also added in some Parmesan cheese to the melted butter which made it even more yummy. Our fillets were much smaller than those in the recipe (2-3 oz maybe), so we cooked this in half the time. SO EASY!

I cut down on the butter, but would have been nice to have more to serve as a sauce. Also didn't have any lemon juice, so added lemon pepper and turned out just fine. Great recipe served over pasta!

Made this for dinner last night - my husband and I really liked it.  I used 6 filets, reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and added a splash or two of pinot grigio. The garlic content was perfect, in my opinion. Added some lemon slices on top of the filets and didn't use parsley (because I didn't have any).  Baked at 350 for 20 mins (added a few small shrimp at 10 mins).  Served with whole wheat fettucini and mixed veggies.  We will definitely make it again (but for a special occasion because it sure does pack a lot of calories!)

Delicious, rich and buttery but still light tasting.  I added a few shrimp during the last 10 minutes to enrich the dish.  Husband loved it.

Wow! This was great! Very simple, yet delicious! After reading some other reviews, I decreased the oven temp and only flipped once. Worked wonderfully!

This was a nice tasting dish but the cooking time is totally off. I followed the instructions on my pack that the tilapia came in. It said to cook at 375 for 8-12 minutes. Another way to cook is broil each side for 3 minutes each. I prefer to broil as it is a bit faster. Good taste though. I will make this again!

Wonderful recipe!! I followed the recipe except the cook temp and time. I baked it at 350* for about 20 minutes. I did turn it over once. My picky kids loved it. The 6 year old even said he wanted it every week. I served it with white rice and corn on the cob. This one is definitely going in my recipe box to make again and again.

Super easy and quick to put together!  Did as other reviewers suggested, 25 mins at 350 and it was perfect.  Next time I'll probably add some more spices though.

This was very good served with pasta and buttered veggies. Didn't remind me that much of shrimp scampi, but I'm just weird like that. I would make this again. I used frozen tilapia, and it worked out well, I didn't cook it for the full 40 minutes, I don't think there would have been much fish left.

AWESOME! I didn't have quite enough lemon juice, so in keeping with the pungent flavors, I substituted half of the lemon juice with dill pickle juice. It was very flavorful and so delicious!! I also had to use garlic powder instead of the real garlic and it worked out nicely. And like the other reviews have suggested: I only cooked for 30 mins and did not flip fillets. My extremely-picky 11 year old stepson (whom only raves about his mother's cooking) was impressed and asked for another helping. YAY! Thanks JasnsWif!

I knew 40 minutes was way too long to cook most any fish so I checked mine at 15 minutes and they were perfectly done.  There is no need to flip the fish; it will cook through just fine.  I am going to make this again and will mince the garlic and also sprinkle with Cajun seasoning before cooking; as written this recipe is a bit bland as well as cooking time is off.  Anyone not familiar with cooking fish would end up with very dry fish.

Love the idea. The flavor was great. I only used 1/2 cup butter and 5 minced garlics, and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I baked 400 degrees for 18 minutes. Whole family loved it. Thanks for posting

Great recipe, but I made it with a few revisions: 2 large cloves of garlic minced instead of 8 halved, 3 fillets instead of 4, I added paprika to the garlic butter mixture and I reduced the cooking time without ever turning the fillets. I heated the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds, added the garlic & parsley and heated for another 30 seconds (just long enough to melt the butter), then I added the remaining ingredients. I poured the mixture in the pan, put the tilapia on top of it & spooned the mixture over the top of the fillets. I thought the cook time was too long based on other tilapia recipes, so I cooked them at 375 & checked them at 20 minutes. They weren't done, so I cooked them for another 10 minutes. The fillets were still a little soft, but the butter & garlic were brown. I cooked them for another 5 minutes & the fillets were done--although some places were crispy and others were soft. In spite of the uneven cooking the flavor was great & my family loved it. Next time I will probably reduce the temperature to 350 & try 30 minutes. (The oven loses heat every time you open the door, so that's probably why it took so long at 375 with all the turning.)

Very buttery and delicious. Enhances tilapias natural buttery flavor. Used lemon pepper seasoning instead of lemon, still amazing flavor.

I tried this tonight with 3 filets for Dad & myself.  It was delicious, but a little over-cooked.  I would turn the oven down to 360 or 350 and cook the filets for 30 minutes.  They were becoming over-cooked after 32 minutes, so I retrieved them.  I also included steamed spinach as a side and linguine noodles.  The butter garlic saute sauce I poured over the noodles and placed Parmesan cheese on the side.  Delicious!

Not a fish fan myself, but this recipe is amazing! Obviously not the healthiest choice, but oh so yummy. Easy to make too. I like to go a little heavier on the lemon juice. The cook time for me tends to be closer to 35/40 minutes, but we like it to be drier. This recipe has made it into my regular meal rotation.

This was good!  I really liked it, while my husband didn't like quite as well but said he would eat again.  My fillets cooked in only 20 min, I knew the 40 would be way too long. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe.  I may add some panko bread crumbs next time, but will cook again.

I made this last night for my family. I have 3 kids who are picky about any food they are not familiar with. They all ate it and were asking for more so now I have found my tilapia dish. I did not cook it for 40 minutes though. I did just 30 minutes and flipped it every 10 minutes. It came out divine! I can not wait to make it again. Easy, fast and delicious. Thanks for the recipe! A true success. Sorry did not have a chance to take a photo it went to fast. LOL!

Looking for another way to cook tilapia - this was a good recipe for something light. I halved the recipe, added just a bit of onion powder, cooked at 400 for 15 minutes on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. There shouldn't be any need to flip. Very good.

I used frozen tilapia and the recipe was wonderful. I followed the lead of others and cooked at lower temp (350) for shorter amount of time. I cooked it (frozen) for 30-35 minutes. It was PERFECT texture, perfectly moist. I used unsalted butter so I needed to season the fish with salt after I cooked it  (and added a little pepper just to taste but wasn't necessary, just a preference). Don't make this recipe if you don't love butter. My family loves butter so we love this recipe. Buttery, moist tilapia with a nice garlic flavor. I had shrimp on hand so I topped the fish with shrimp. But I tasted the fish first so that I could rate the recipe! :) I rated it 5 stars because there is no 4.5 rating. I would have rated it 4.5 because I would have loved the tip on using salted butter or to salt to taste.

As a fan of anything "scampi" I tried this recipe and I liked it. I reduced the butter down to 1/2 cup and upped the lemon juice to 1/4 cup. I also used the jar minced garlic I didn't measure how much I put in but since I love garlic I put in quite a bit of it. Pour the mixture over the tilapia and baked it for 35 mins 375 degrees. I didn't bother to turn them. Sprinkled the dried parsley on at the end.

Loved this recipe! I added a little bit more garlic cloves and somewhat use a touch of seasoning salt on the fish. The white wine was an added bonus. I forgot to add it in the butter/lemon/garlic mix and added it once the fish was almost done. I also used a little more butter than I probably should but my boyfriend loved it. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is pretty good and super easy! It's a great option to make on a week night to get a tasty dinner on the table quickly. Like other reviewers, I shortened the cooking time to about 25mins and the fish was nicely done, flaky and flavorful. In the future I might mince my garlic and increase the lemon juice so the sauce has more of that lemony-garlic flavor that I love and less of the over-indulgent butter flavor.

As others mentioned, I cut the cook time down to 30 min. But it turned out WONDERFULLY! Everyone liked it. Will make this again!

this was very good - I was looking for a different way to cook the tilapia and this did the trick.  I melted the butter with the garlic in the pan in the oven to avoid too many dishes.   I cut the butter down to 1 stick though and it was plenty.  I had the prepacked frozen fillets in a 2 lb bag - they are small and not 6 oz each as this recipe calls for but I used the entire bag.   This was very tasty and super easy - definitely will make again.

I liked the recipe and will make it again, but I would recommend two changes.  First, I thought it needed a little salt.  Second, make sure to check the fish carefully because mine was done in only 20 minutes.

I used margarine instead and I don't know if that is why it came out a little salty, but it was great because I had white rice as a side. Also instead of using cooking spray I used some of that butter that  the recipe calls for on the baking pan. I cooked for 25 mins as well not the full 40 mins. I did double the fish and it came out fine by doubling the ingredients.

Will not repeat. I will stick with my Mom's shrimp scampi recipe, and fix tilapia on other ways. 
The cooking time is definitely too long; I added the extra shrimp as one reviewer recommended and that was the best part. I cooked it at 400 for about 15-20 minutes. I can't imagine cooking the tilapia for 40 minutes!

I started by halving the recipe but only used 1/4 c butter, as per other reviewers. Also went with 30 minutes at 350 and didn't flip the fish, though I did baste after 20 minutes. Skipped the parsley but did put on some paprika before cooking. also used minced garlic instead of halved. turned out great, it's a keeper. will use wine in the broth next time.

This was really good!  I didn't alter the recipe at all other than decreasing the butter to 1 stick and only using 4 garlic cloves since my young brood was eating as well.  I served over whole grain pasta with broccoli.  The caloric content was about half as I used smaller fillets and less butter.  I'll definitely make this again since it's quick and easy!

Yummy! Needed a bit of salt but other than that it was excellent! I didn't flip them either. I cooked the fish for 35 minutes at 350, spooning the sauce over the fish 1/2 way through. Excellent!

I cut back on the butter because my filets weren't very big, but still had plenty.  I didn't use enough garlic because I didn't have it on hand, but I've bought more so I can make this again.  I wouldn't use this recipe everytime because it's not very healthy, but it was tasty!

I tweaked the recipe a bit also adding a bit of lemon extract, a LOT more lemon juice and some lemon pepper. I also threw in a few artichoke hearts and then served it over angel hair. A great recipe!

I found the tilapia to be kind of soggy and lacking in any real flavor. My hubby ate it all up and liked it but I had a few bites and gave the rest to him because I didn't enjoy it at all. Would not make again.

This was a good lunch for my boyfriend and I. I listened to most of the reviews and added lemon pepper, halved the butter and added white wine, and cut the cook time to 25 minutes at 350 and this turned out good. Boyfriend gave it a B+ while rubbing his belly. I only wish I could find something to give it a little more zing that pushes it up to an A+!

A lot of calories (even with a reduced amount of butter) for not a lot of taste.  This dish was a miss for me.

Way too much butter when i recalculated for 5 filets. I opted for even less than the recipe called for and added more garlic and juiced 3 medium lemons. This recipe not only lacked visual appeal but taste. If it had had shrimp in it it may have been different but i was not impressed.

I actually was not a huge fan of this. I followed the directions exactly and it tasted rather bland to me. Didn't seem worth all of the butter calories I was surely ingesting for such a bland dish. Actually, the best part about it was the garlic. After being baked, it was mild and delicious. I don't think I'll be doing this again... unless I try it with shrimp.

You will love this buttery flavor!! We loved it, by far the best tilapia recipe. I baked it for 30 min at 350 and the fillet was falling apart, so 40 min at 375 is definitely way too long.

This was delicious! I did not have many expectations from this dish, seen that it was so easy to make with not many ingredients. But it was soooo good!!!! I had read the reviews first so I only turned it over once, and put it on 350 degrees and took it out after 25-30 minutes. I also seasoned the fish with some salt and pepper before adding the sauce. I forgot to add the parsley, but I didn't miss it. Next time I'll try it with the parsley. But I'll definitely will be making this again!!

I did follow some of the suggestions in the reviews. 350° for about 20ish minutes. And will use less butter next time, though it did taste great. We love garlic, so I will also either mince or slice thinner in the future, so I'll get more garlic in each bite. But the family was pleasantly surprised.

Very good flavor, but do not bake for more than 20 minutes or you really over cook.

Loved this!! I had double the amount of fish filets but, as others suggested, I used less butter. I reduced to half a cup and left the remaining ingredients the same. Also, increased the oven temp to 400 and cooked for just under 20 minutes.

It was great. Received plenty of compliments. When you add a lit bit of white cooking wines be little pieces of hot pepper it takes the taste  to new level. Pour the wine while it’s cooking but not too much .

Way under seasoned and too greasy. I ended up draining the butter off for the last 10 minutes and mixing it with some bouillon, water, flour and some spices and putting it on after it was done baking.

Too much butter, 1/4 cup is fine. Cooked for 20 min, and didn't turn. Tasted great! I've used several different white fish, and it's my wife's favorite way to have fish now.  I never seen to have any parsley, and it's OK without, or sometimes I even use dill in the butter sauce.

I loved this recipe! I did everything the same EXCEPT: I added lemon pepper and put each fish in an individual aluminum foil" pack" before I put in the oven (I let them marinate in the lemon juice ab an hour prior to doing this.

Husband LOVES it. I added lemon pepper to the fillets before adding the butter mixture used 6 cloves instead of 8 and added extra lemon juice. I didn't measure that I just squeezed it in it was bottled. I put it on at 375 for 20 minutes and it wasn't dry at all. Fantastic recipe and we will definitely be making it again.

I loved that it was an easy recipe but found it to be too bland for my taste.  I took recommendations of others to cut down on butter (mixed butter with good olive oil instead), sprinkled with salt and paprika and added more garlic but still found it to need a kick of more flavor.

I put a little twist on the recipe. I used frozen talapia from Costco. 2 1/2 sticks of butter, the juice of 2 large fresh lemons and I roughly chopped the garlic necessary for my servings.
I coated both side of the fillets with garlic salt and pepper and once I covered them with the butter mixture, I lightly coated the fillets with Old Bay Seasoning. Then covered the pan with tin foil and cooked them for 35 minutes @350 degrees.
My In laws and my wife loved it, and you will too! Thanks for the recipe! Enjoy!

we are new to the health game, and decided that fish was a great place to start. I followed the recipe to the T. This is a definite keepee

I will only make 2 adjustmenta next time. it calls for Too much butter. It calls for 3/4 cup and next time I'll only use 1/2 cup. Also, it was difficult to flip the tilapia every 10 mins. so I recommend on flipping twice instead of 4 times.  I did however add some Chile powder to it as we like a little bit of a kick.

Really good, my favourite flavours together... but I used less butter than called for.  We used "Le Merlan" or whiting fish, a fine substitute.

Tasted a lot like red lobster's shrimp scampi. I'm not real fond of tilapia but this was good! I did make a few changes and adjusted the ratio of ingredients because I had more fish..I only baked it for 25 minutes, I did not turn them (I tried turning one but that made the seasonings slide off into the butter and at the end, that particular fillet wasn't quite as flavorful as the others) , I used 8 tilapia fillets,  1 cup of butter, 11 cloves of garlic , 1-1/2 Tbsp of parsley,  3 tsp of fresh lemon juice, and I added a bit of black pepper and basil. I spooned a little of the butter over them before serving.  I plan on making this again and will add shrimp next time. Thank you for the recipe!

After coating the tilapia in the lemon garlic butter, I breaded it with seasoned bread crumbs. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 350. It was delicious!

My husband and I liked this, kids were mixed reviews.  I did lower butter to 1/2 cup, added 1 tbsp of dijon mustard, and a little lemon pepper.  Served over noodles.  There wasn't as much sauce as expected, but it worked out OK.

I followed the recipe it was good but needed some salt added at the end to bring out the garlic flavor. I will be making this again and maybe add a little dill.

I made this recipe exactly as written and put over one pound of tilapia.  It didn't have enough flavor for us.  Next time I'll try mincing the garlic instead to release more flavor.

It was edible.  I made it exactly as directed except lowered the temp to 350 and only baked for 20 minutes.  I wasn't impressed.  It was very bland.  The flavor wasn't offensive but that's because there wasn't much flavor there.  My daughter refused to eat it.  I ate some but only because I didn't want to waste food.  There are plenty of leftovers that I fear will just end up being tossed.

I used only a little butter mixed with high heat cool oil. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. I used one clove of garlic not 8. I gave it a three but with these changes it was a 5. I also made a sauce out  of the oil and butter in the pan after using a little flour.

Don't flip it. Cook for only 20 minutes. Ad more lemon. Add white wine to increase flavor. About half of the butter  is sufficient. Much easier to prepare this way than as described.

This was delicious and so easy to make! I will definitely make this again. I may cut back on the amount of butter next time and marinate the fish first to soak up the flavors. All in all - a great recipe.

My family loved this.   Changed  a few things tho... I only used half stick of unsalted butter,  3 Tbsp minced garlic,   lemon juice, and sprinkled season salt and parsley on top.  Baked at 350 for 20 mins. and broiled on low for a few mins.  It was a nice golden brown.

Delicious! Almost too easy to prepare.  I didn't change anything, and served it with wild rice. My 5 sons and husband devoured it. They all eyed it suspiciously at first, and got small portions. After one bite I saw 2 of them get up immediately to put more on their plates. It was entertaining to watch their surprise. I had to double the recipe to make enough for my family, next time I'll triple it and hopefully get enough for myself. Thank you for sharing :)

i loved this recipe! so easy and simple! however, the amount of butter is overkill AND the cooking time is way too much. i decided to cook mine at 25 mins and still i found it a little overcooked. Next time i will try it at 15-20 mins. Also, despite warnings from the other i did try to turn the fish and it broke apart! :( I guess I should've listened to the warnings! other than that i love it and will be making fish like this more often!!! Also, i had it over white rice, honestly just jad some leftover rice and didn't feel like making pasta or another side dish.

Made this last night. Very glad I read the reviews prior to, as the 20 minutes cooking time was definitely enough.  I didn't have to flip to fish and I added a pound of shrimp.  I reduced the amount of garlic,  but increased the amount of fish, so the amount of butter was appropriate.  I also covered the pan with foil in order to keep in the moisture and removed it for the last 5 minutes.  Overall the flavor was excellent and my family and I really enjoyed it!

Since it's just me, I cut this recipe in half using only 4 tbsp of butter. Still way too much. I only baked for 20 minutes & it was somewhat dry. Still tasty but if I make this again I will definitely use less butter, more lemon juice, minced garlic, fresh parsley & bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.

Great recipe...with a few minor adjustments :)

The recipe did call for a lot of butter...A LOT!  But, I ended up making 8 tilapia fillet and about 1 lb of small shrimp.  The butter content worked fine for all that! 

I went along with the recipe, but as I was prepping, I recalled some reviews stating that it lacked flavor.  So, I kicked it up a notch. After putting the tilapia and shrimp in the pan, and drizzling the butter concoction, added the parsley and once it baked for a while, I added dashes of italian bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese...oh and the crushed red peppers.  

My oven is kinda hinkey so I set it at 400 degrees for about twenty minutes (because I forgot to set the timer), then increased it to 425 for about 10 more minutes. 

Also, instead of using pasta, I used my SpiraLife and made zucchini pasta.

I have not made this twice.  The first time I did it, it was wonderful!  Loved it!  My husband requested it again.  I used a Dutch oven to cook it.  I used it again this time and changed it up a little bit and it was AMAZING! I cooked the sauce in the dutch oven on the stove.  I used some olive oil with the butter and when adding the lemon, I also used a microplane, to add some of the lemon peel which intensified the lemon ever so slightly.  I also added dill as well as the parsley. I then seared the fish on both sides in the sauce.  I seasoned both sides of the fish in the searing liquid with salt, pepper and some old bay, and basted it with the liquid when I turned it.  Then I put it in a 350 degree oven and let it finish. I never touched the fish after the initial sear and it was done a little faster because I seared it first.  Thanks for the idea!  We will make this regularly.  It was like an expensive seafood dish we would pay big bucks for at a restaurant, and SO EASY!

Very easy recipe with lots of flavor. I cooked it at a 400 degree oven for 15 mins. and did not flip it. The shrimp and tilapia were cooked perfectly. I cut the butter in half and used lemon juice, garlic and lemon pepper sauce. My husband loved it. I served it with brown rice pasta in a simple tomato basil garlic sauce.

Super easy and very flavorful! I used less butter and reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes and didn't flip the fish. My husband raved about this dish. I served it with creamed potatoes and peas. Yummy.

I gave this a 4 because it hag gray potential but when you do a few substitutions it was prefect.  cook at 400 for 15 minutes like the other reviewers said.  add the 2 tables spoons of dijon.  this is must needed.  and add some shrimp to it while it is cooking and this is delicious! !!!

I really liked this dish! The only reason I did not give this dish a 5 was due to the fish falling apart when I went to flip them after 10 minutes.

FANTASTIC! I never, and I mean, never cook! It just seems to take too much time and effort.  However, I'm trying to eat less processed foods so now I'm forced to. This recipe is sooo easy to prepare and cook its ridiculous.  Plus is down right delicious! Perfect for the those who loathe cooking as much as I do:) Only thing I did different was sprinkle some pepper and a little no-salt in addition to the parsley...perfection.

This came out great and it was very easy I adjusted the cooking time to 350 for 25 minutes it could probably go another 5 minutes and  added cajun spice and sprinkled some panko bread crumbs.And do not flip the fish.This dish went fast.

Very good! My first attempt at making tilapia and it was very easy and tasty. However, I didn't use as much butter as suggested and I also added garlic powder as well as some other seasonings. Will definitely make again!

DH and I both liked this recipe which was very easy and used ingredients I almost always have on hand. What more can I ask for? I followed several of the suggestions - used less butter, added dijon and a pinch of cayenne, and served it over pasta. I do believe it would have been a little boring without the additional spices. With those modifications I'll definitely make it again. And I cooked it in the toaster oven - no need to heat up the kitchen on a warm day.

Similar experience to other reviewers; the dish turned out great, but the butter can be cut in half and the cooking time may need adjusting.  I made the dish as described except I only flipped it once.  It was a good alternative to the usual tilapia recipes.

Preferred the 1/2 cup butter as suggested. Added chopped tomatoes to the pan while fish cooked. 350 for 30 minutes.

This recipe was okay. Tilapia is almost impossible to flip 4 times without it breaking apart. Also I think 40 minutes at 375 is way to long and hot. I recommend cooking at 350 for half hour. No need to turn over the filets either. Sauce was okay. I'd lessen the garlic and add more lemon juice.

It was quick and easy and I loved the end product, but I would also agree with the need for minor adjustments..the main one being that you don't need as much butter as it days you do. I didn't use as much and it still came out flavorful

Far too much butter for my taste, and i didn't use the full amount. Also could use more flavor. I'll probably add more pepper and salt if I ever make it again. As is, it is edible, but bland.

This was amazingly good and easy.  I took advice from others and cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes then turned it and cooked another 10 minutes.  The fish was moist with great flavor i added a little lemon pepper to the fish first will be making this again.

This was tasty and very easy to make.  I baked at 375 for 30 minutes and it cooked fine; I put 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder for a slightly different flavour and cut the butter in 1/2.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was my first time cooking fish (other than boxed frozen fish sticks) and I was really pleased with how this turned out. I will definitely make it again.

My boyfriend liked it so well that he asked me to cook up an extra two filets and he at it with rice for lunch the next two days :)

I loved this. I wanted something a little different to do with tilapia that wasn't labor-intensive. This was perfect and delicious! I suggest serving with a good roll to sop up extra sauce and some roasted veggies. Thanks, will definitely make this again!

Enjoyed it.  I used more tilapia than the recipe called for and eyeballed the measuraments, but it was really good and so easy when fish was all I had on hand.  I will definetly make this again.

I, like many other reviewers, cut down the amount of butter to about half what the recipe called for. This recipe can be used with just about any type of fish, or even chicken, and it would be great.

This was good but not what I had hoped for. Shrimp Scampi is still number one.

Not very much flavor when the directions are followed as is.  I added some paprika, salt, and pepper which seemed to help.

Too much butter, very bland not like the typical "scampi" sauce. Just awful tasting.

the cooking time was way off. i lowered my oven temp and decreased the cooking time and mine were still a little overcooked. the sauce was good. i used walleye and added more lemon juice than called for. i didnt bother flipping them since i wanted them to stay in tact. this was good over brazilian white rice and stuffed zucchini on the side(both from this site). this was missing onions for me so i used a rice recipe that called for some. w/ a little playing around this is a different way to cook whitefish.

Really good and really easy.   My fillets were too thin to flip, I guess.  So after I pretty much destroyed one I let the rest cook unmolested.  I'll use more lemon juice next time.  I served with saffron rice and steamed vegetable medley.

This was delicious and was remarkably easy to make. I was done in the kitchen within minutes and the rest it did by itself. We all loved this. I did have a lot of butter, so I will play around with that next time, but there definitely will be a next time.
