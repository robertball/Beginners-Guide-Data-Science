This was a fantastic dessert.  I made a couple changes though.  Instead of pie crust, I crushed up butter cookies and made a crumb base, which went really well with the filling.  I didn't use any frosting as I didn't have any on hand and the flavour was still great.  Maybe the filling wasn't as fluffy as it would have been otherwise.  I found the filling sweet enough as it was so I can't imagine how much sweeter it would have been with the frosting added.  Thanks so much for this recipe - it's definitely a keeper!

This was very sweet. I did not taste any Champagne flavor. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because my guests really enjoyed it.

The light fluffy texture sent me floating on air! It's delicate pastry was complemented by the tart of the pineapple, although I must say it was quite tingly on the tongue. I do have one suggestion for those brave enough to attempt this dish - add some real champagne (about 2 cups) for a real KICK to the dish! Much more amusing to your dinner guests! HAW, HAW!
