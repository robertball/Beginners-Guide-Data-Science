I DID THIS RECIPE AND IT IS GREAT, BUT I BELEVIE THAT IF YOU ADD A LITTLE CINNAMON AND I CUP OF RAISINS INCLUDED WITH PREPARING THE BREAD WILL BE EVEN MORE DELIGHTFUL.

This tasted wonderful however I agree with 2 other reviewers about there not being enough liquid.  I would suggest adding another half of the liquid part and mixing it all up in a bowl before putting it in the baking dish. I think this would help get the bread pieces a little less dry.

I made this bread pudding for the first time with leftover stuffing bread from Thanksgiving dinner.  I took the advice from some other reviews and used 4 eggs and 4 cups of milk.  I also added plumped raisins and about 2 T cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the mixture that is poured over the bread. This seemed to coat the bread very nicely.  I cooked it in the oven without foil for the first 20 minutes until lightly brown and then covered with foil for 30 minutes.  The last 10 minutes, I removed the foil and by doing this, the top of the bread did not burn, just got a nice golden color.  

For the sauce, I used a combination of Bailey's and Jamison's.  Delicious!! My only concern was that I seemed to have quite a bit of liquid to cover the top, so I poured about half of the sauce on top of the bread pudding and then placed back in the warm oven to soak up some of the juices.  Once I took it out of the oven (about 10 minutes later), I poured the remaining sauce over the top and let it set.  Seemed to work out really good.  I'll definitely make this again!

Delicious!  Wow!  We served this for dessert on St. Paddy's Day and it was incredible!  I didn't have any whiskey in the house, so used one of those "airplane bottles" of Bailey's Irish Cream instead and it was superb.  Very smooth and subtle.  The sauce would be fine with a bit of vanilla instead of the alcohol,too, I think.  Try it and enjoy!  It's certainly going to be an oft-served item in our home.

I added a little personal touch to the bread pudding by adding some peaches and pumpkin pie spice.  I hope Cherry will not be offended.  It reminds me of one of our favorite desserts from Madison, Wisconsin's Great Dane Pub.  I love the sauce!

I just made this recipe last night and was not totally impressed. I would double the egg mixture. Because my bread dried out. I also add a little vanilla to jazz up the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe.  My daughter asked for seconds, and my husband can't wait to have more.  He said next time I should double the recipe so that it lasts longer!  However, I left the whiskey out because my husband can't have alcohol for health reasons, so I added more cream to the sauce instead.

I thought this was absolutely fabulous but I added raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe.  These additions definitely made the recipe terrific.  My kids weren't interested in trying the bread pudding but my dog loved it.  I think he especially liked the whiskey sauce!

This was wonderful!  I had never made bread pudding before, so I was a bit nervous.  But I tried it out on visiting family and friends and it was a hit.  Very easy to make.  Can't wait to have it again!

This came out a little too soggy. May have been my error, I was trying to half the recipe. I may have put too much liquid, but it looked dry with half as nuch milk mixture. Whiskey sauce was a little bland.

Excellent!  This recipe makes a moist, light and rich bread pudding.  I use rum instead of whiskey, and its over the top good.  I've replaced my granny's recipe with this one!

I just made this Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce for an important church dinner for the first time, and I came home the star of the show. I advise all users of this receipe to choose an excellent thick French bread, not a crusty one, and use an expensive whiskey! We loved it!!!!!

easy and delicious; i vary it by using cinnamon & challuh breads instead of the french breads, as these are thicker bread to retain moisture. Also, I add 2 more eggs to this recipe, and use about 1/4 more of milk for extra liquid. The whiskey sauce is great, although, you may have to decrease the whiskey to 1/3 cup for the sauce to thicken a bit more into a glazey-like consistency.

This was a tremendous hit at our house.  Substituted light butter and coffee cream, added cinnamon, plumped raisins, and a bit of nutmeg, and omitted the pecans.  The big  flavor change was that I used amaretto instead of whiskey -- what a delicious sauce that made!

Very good!!  I used Wild Turkey for the whiskey in the sauce & it was a bit much, so I will cut back next time or use Makers Mark or Jack. I also added some cinnamon to the milk mixture & it was yummy!!

My family loves this. I use several more eggs, half and half (less milk), less sugar and Challah bread. No nuts for my hubby. So we like chocolate chips and chopped up dried apricots instead. The sauce was excellent too.

Yummy!  Rave reviews from all who tasted it--with some adjustments.  I increased the eggs to 3, and increased milk proportionately--may use 4 eggs & more milk next time.  I also added 1 t. cinnamon and some raisins.  The whiskey sauce was very mild (maybe because I used Jameson?), so I think next time, I'll simmer 1/2 cup to half volume before adding the remaining ingredients.  Overall, a good basic recipe that's easy to play with.

Average tasting.  The sauce had too much whiskey and too much butter.  Won't make this again.

Great recipe!  Super easy and fun to make it your own.    I omitted the pecans and added chocolate chips to appease my friends who don't believe it's a dessert unless there is chocolate.  
I'm excited to try a different kind of sauce.  Maybe espresso?

This is a great Bread Pudding! We all enjoyed it. Having two Epileptics in our family (no acohol), I would still keep the base recipe and use a lemon pudding sauce.

Thanks Cherry for the great recipe. It reminds me of the one I lost. My bread pudding and whiskey sauce hasn't been the same since!!! I am finally back in my families good graces. This is one of those "keep it simple" is best recipes.

I didnt make the pudding from this recipe, I made the whiskey sauce. The BEST sauce I have EVER had. It is buttery, not too sweet and just the right amount of whiskey. This is now my go to sauce. Thanx!!

Great recipe. I read all the reviews then tailored to my tastes. 

PUDDING: Used 4 eggs, made w heavy cream instead of milk and added water to add for more liquid as noted, and with the last cup of liquid I used 1/2 & 1/2 then scalded to flavor. I beat the eggs separately, so could I could heat cream, butter, sugar. Added cinnamon and vanilla to the cream mix to my taste for the pudding base. Cooled cream mix, then very slowly added beaten eggs. Make sure it's cool enough or you might get cooked eggs! Did not use pecans. Will use raisins or sultanas next time and may plumb overnight with whiskey, water mixture. Once my bread was ready, I used a stock pot allow liquids and dry to mix. Placed bread first, then gently added the warm liquid. Left it to soak about 15 min. Then transferred to baking pan. Oven at 300-325 and baked for 70 min. Just check, when knife comes clean, it's done.

SAUCE: I doubled the cream; two TBSP butter, 1tsp cornstarch dissolved in small amt water, use powdered sugar. Cook til thick, then add whiskey and cook 5 min more. Cooks out most of alcohol but very smooth.

I'm a lover of bread pudding so my recipe is modified based on what I have loved in other versions eaten

This recipe is good.  I would cook the sauce just a bit longer to get the whiskey flavor to subside but overall delicious....

Best bread pudding I’ve had since I can remember. I used Bourbon instead of Whiskey since that was what I had on hand and I also added a pinch or two of cinnamon. Fantastic!

Use brioche instead of French bread, it's sweeter and a bit more dense. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the milk to 3 cups. Also added raisins and cinnamon, delish! Everyone was raving about it.

I had to double the first part with the eggs, sugar, and the milk... Although, I didn't make any changes to the amount of milk. Butter was double and it made for a deliciously buttery crunch to the French toast pieces! Overall, I really liked it and it was also my first time making this dish! Thanks a lot for the recipe, April.

This is such an easy and quick recipe. I actually cut the recipe in half (cause I didn't have enough bread). It was perfect. The whole thing was eaten up by my man. Will be making this again.

I used a 2lb Cranberry walnut bread along with the same recipe for the wet ingredients. I did add more raisins and served it with warm whiskey sauce. A family favorite since this is the 2nd time I've made this in 3 days-lol. I would recommend covering with foil after 45 min since, if doubled, you will need to continue baking for an addition 2 hours! You want to make sure the Center is fully cooked and not served mushy and under-cooked.

I made this when we had impromptu guests coming over. I happen to have a loaf of day old bread so why mot bread pudding. I followed the directions as a instructed. I did let the mixture soak through for about an hour. As suggested by another reviewer, I added cinnamon, raisins as well as pinch of fresh nutmeg. I had so many compliments. The bottom was so creamy with the top being a bit crusty. So good. I only had bourbon on hand so I used it instead of the whiskey. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Amazing! I tweaked it a bit to suit our taste. I used a baguette it was perfect size. I used 4 eggs, a vanilla bean, teaspoon of cinnamon and a half of a teaspoon of nutmeg. I also only had walnuts on hand so that was what I used. This recipe was a perfect base for an amazing dish! Thank you! ??

It was fabulous!, and I think I'll have to make it again.
And as other reviewers before me, I did make some changes. Some based on the other reviews.

I did increase the liquid:
1) I used 4 eggs instead of 2.
2) I increased the milk to 3 cups.
3) Instead of whisky I used "captain Morgan's, spiced rum" (leftover from Xmas)
4) I didn't have nuts to use, but, I took a few small handfuls of "craisins" soaked in the captain Morgan rum for an hour or so. (A little punch of tart was wonderful) I just sprinkled on top just before baking, not mixed in.
5) I also added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.
6) I increased the rum a little. (just to use it up ;).
7) baking; I covered loosely with foil for the first 45 minutes, then uncovered for 25 minutes. To keep it from drying out.
I was a great hit with everyone!.

I used a pint of heavy cream, soaked organic dried mixed berries to make them a bit softer, and added apple pie spice instead of straight cinnamon. I also used half a large miche loaf of Panera white bread cut in cubes. In addition, I added half a cup maple whiskey to the custard mix before poured it over the bread. Which I toasted a bit in a warm oven to give it some substance before baking cover for 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I may add a few more minutes It has turned out wonderfully and I will skip the sauce tomorrow for Christmas dessert.

tried the whiskey sauce. Excellent. I used lighter cream, therefore I think that's why it didn't thicken, but still very tasty. Used this on plum pudding this Christmas. Will use it in the future for bread puddling.

Just wondering about the poster who said she added raisins and fed it to her dog. Is the dog still alive? Just a few raisins will kill  a dog. Be careful.
