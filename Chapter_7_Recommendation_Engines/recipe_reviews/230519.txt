First time I made them just as the recipe stated.  They were pretty tasty straight out of the oven, but after they cooled they were thick, bread-y, and chewy.  My kiddos wouldn't even finish them. (and they are NOT the type to turn their nose up at Banana chocolate chip muffins).  Take two I tweaked.  Instant oats instead of rolled, a little vanilla and salt, and a good healthy glop of sour cream.  And a tiny bit (about half Tbs) of softened butter.  Now THAT was yummy. Yes, I know, I'm defeating the purpose of "healthy" - but one thing I have learned in my motherhood. It doesn't matter how healthy something is if none of your kids will eat it!

I replaced the sugar with splenda and a little honey. I also replaced the chocolate chips with blueberries and coconut. Very moist and tasty. Will make again.

I made this recipe, but accidentally used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1/4 like the recipe called for.  They turned out perfectly!  They were moist and delicious!

I really like this recipe and will probably use it from now on. It's hard to find recipes that use all WW flour and taste good. I made the following changes: I used butter instead of applesauce because I like the buttery flavour, I used coconut sugar instead of white because it's better for you, I added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla, I also used quick oats. Anyhow, they turned out perfect and next time I'll try with applesauce. Great recipe!

Yum! Thanks so much for the recipe! There were a couple of things I did differently...I didn't have unsweetened applesauce, so I used regular. I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of white sugar, my milk was 2% rather than skim and I love vanilla so I tossed in a tsp of that. The muffins turned out moist and delicious!

I made this per the recipe.  I thought it was lacking something.  Maybe salt? Maybe vanilla? Overall a good texture, but I just thought it was missing a little something.

I only did 2 things different in this recipe. Used all purpose flour and no chocolate chips, but these muffins were like eating plain dough. They had NO TASTE WHATSOEVER. I don't know how this recipe got good reviews, but i would never make it again

These are very good.  I do not prefer apple sauce as it makes muffins sticky, so I used a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil instead.  I shied away from the full amount of whole wheat flour, subbing in a little white flour, but I love the whole wheat flavor so much (kind of nutty), that I wished I just followed the recipe on that point.  I think walnuts would be good.  Oh, one more thing… where is the salt in this recipe?  I added a 1/2 teaspoon which was good.  UPDATE: I made these again with coconut, walnuts and a sprinkle of flax seeds.  Delish!  Be sure to bake until they get a little browned on top for it makes them taste toasty.

These are really good. I was a little worried that they would be too dry, but they weren't. I love that they have a good amount of protein and fiber and they are tasty. My 5 year old loved them too. I used the mini chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate chips and doubled the recipe. It made 26 muffins. I'm going to try to individually freeze them to have for an easy breakfast. Thanks for sharing!

I reviewed this recipe a couple months ago and was very pleased then and now with the recipe. You can see my previous review below. I wanted to add that I did freeze half of the muffins in a Ziploc bag. I thawed them out one at a time and cut them in half and stuck them in my little toaster oven for a few minutes which got a nice crispy exterior on them, then spread s little butter on them. They were absolutely delicious after being frozen. I even microwaved one and it was very good also. I just liked the toaster oven because you get that crispy outer exterior like when they come out of the oven. One last thing, I noticed some people did not like the dense bready consistency of these muffins. You have to remember that you’re using whole wheat flour and rolled oats. That is automatically going to give you a heavier dense consistency in the muffin. And that certainly does not make it bad, what it does make it is extremely filling. You eat one of these muffins and you know you had a really good snack that was very filling. Plus they are still moist and very tasty inside. If you want a lighter and cake like consistency to your muffin I suggest you try a different recipe that isn’t healthy. As long as whole-wheat and rolled oats are involved in this recipe, it’s going to automatically be a denser type muffin. I love them!

The muffins were pretty good but not as soft and moist as I like. Maybe more applesauce was needed.

Update: I made these muffins again but with some changes.... (original review of three stars remains for original recipe).

I used instant instead of rolled oats, I used sour cream instead of milk, I added about two tablespoons of extra applesauce, added two pinches of salt and a splash of vanilla, as well as cinnamon and nutmeg. Instead of chocolate chips I used raisins because that's what I was in the mood for. They turned out great. A lot moister than last time and just delicious!

I found these to be pretty dense. Flavour wasn't bad but they didn't blow me away. Enjoyed trying the recipe though. Thanks Nichole

Delicious, moist and very yum! This was gobbled up in no time at my home. I did however have to use all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat and oil instead of applesauce (because I didn't have both of those on hand). In my attempt to still try and make these healthy, I put in just 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of the recommended 1/2 cup and that was plenty enough! I did take the suggestions of a few other reviewers and threw in a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the batter. Thanks for the recipe Nicole - I look forward to trying this with whole-wheat flour the next time! :)

I added about a half cup of extra banana. I used quick oats instead. I added cinnamon and vanilla and used coconut milk in place of skim milk. They were moist and delicious. This is my new fav muffin recipe and the kids loved them!

I tried this recipe. It was good except there was a baking powder after taste. I did it according to the recipe. I will be making these again but next time I will use half the baking powder.

This recipe is awesome! I also changed a few things. I used 1/2 cup butter instead of applesauce. I know it's less healthy, but I had butter in the house and not applesauce. I didn't measure the banana, but I used two very large bananas - I think it was closer to 1 3/4 cups. I also added 1/2 cup walnuts, 2 tsp vanilla and a 1 tsp salt. Instead of rolled oats I used quick oats. I did 1 cup whole wheat (then ran out) and used 1/2 cup all purpose white. They came out totally amazing, very moist, super yum - the kids (ages 5 and 7) each ate two straight out of the over and were still asking for me. I think my husband ate four! With the changes I made, it ended up being 18 muffins. I also don't fill the cups up too high.

I love this recipe.  I only changed 3 things:  I used Demerara sugar instead of white sugar, I put it in a 9 x 7 Pyrex dish instead of making muffins and I sprinkled walnuts on top before baking.  It was sooooo good!!  Normally when I make banana bread the middle is still kind of squishy but not with this one.  I like that it is not like cake, that it is like bread..you know...banana BREAD.  This will be my go to recipe for banana bread from now on.

This recipe tasted like wall paper paste muffins. It did not sound like a very flavorful recipe so I added cinnamon, nutmeg, some brown sugar and decided to trust the high ratings. So sad it was not something I can rate highly. The two rating is only because one person at my house liked them.

I changed the recipe... A lot.  I usually do not do things like that but i needed this kind of muffin... And I needed then to be good..... So I used 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 flour; as well as 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Same volume as this recipe called for. I omitted the applesauce and used sour cream in it's place. I added vanilla and a small amount of melted coconut oil. I barely mashed the banana's and used three total. They turned out amazing. I doubled the batch and got way more than  that! I will be making this again for sure in the same fashion as this time!

My second time to make these. For "healthy" muffins, we liked them. I made them as directed with one exception... I used about 1/3 cup whole milk. This helped with the dense and gummy issue I had with the first batch- but I highly recommend adding vanilla! They seem to be missing a little something- perhaps that would help.

I used 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup almond flour instead of the flour in the recipe.  I also used 1/4 cup Xyletol/Stevia blend, and 1/4 cup cocoa instead of 1/2 cup sugar.  I used Mini Choc Chips, and I substituted almond milk instead of skim milk.  (I also increased it to 1/3 cup).  I used 2 mashed bananas. I even added a little peanut butter too.   Even the kids and husband loved them.  I think the cocoa adds flavor... very good.

I tried the recipe with minimal changes, after reading other reviews. I added a tsp. of vanilla and a 1/2 Tbsp. of cinnamon. I also did 1/4 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar, and 1 large egg plus 2 egg whites. I will admit, I added some more chocolate chips...I love chocolate...Overall, the flavor was great, but a a little dry and too sweet for my liking. I think I will cut back on the sugar (nix the white sugar) and increase the amount of milk to make them more moist next time! Thanks for sharing though! I agree with others that this is a recipe that you can easily adjust to your liking!

yes..very good but did add vanilla, allspice and some wheat germ. Very moist and loved that there is no butter in this recipe so much healthier for you! This one is a keeper!

Like some others, I substituted 1/4 cup of flax for some of the whole wheat flour but other than that I followed the recipe.  These muffins are wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly. The muffins themselves turned out just ok. But the worst part was that half of a muffin would stick to the paper liner. If you are going to try this recipe, use a cooking spray. Maybe someone will have a better luck.

I love this recipe! When I substituted a low calorie sugar blend for the sugar, these muffins came out to being under 160 calories each! And they're delicious. Will be making this recipe regularly! Possibly with something else other than banana, next time... not a huge fan of the banana and chocolate combination.

Just wanted something different this morning for breakfast. Decided on banana muffins and found this one. Tweaked the recipe a little and added one teaspoon of vanilla extract and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Also used cooking spray on the muffin tins and omitted the liners. Total baking time was 17 minutes. Have to say these muffins came out moist and were absolutely delicious!

Added 2TBSP  flax and for 50% of flour, used oat flour. Replaced white sugar with brown sugar and used 50% greek yogurt and 50% apple sauce in place of all apple sauce to make healthier. Still tasted great.

I made this because I saw the high ratings, but I should have read them first! I agree with almost everyone else. While they are fairly good made this way, and very healthy, next time I think I will add a little coconut oil and maybe use 1/2 cup of white flour, cutting the ww flour down to 1 cup. It’s definitely a recipe worth working with.

I was looking for healthy banana bread recipe and found this.  It is more bread like consistency but still delicious!! Made 2 substitutions 1) almond milk instead of skim and 2) cut the sugar in half and added a big squirt of agave into wet ingredients for sweetness.

I made these as written subbing gluten free flour. They were okay but not our favorite banana muffin. They were a bit dry when compared to other banana muffins I have made.  These muffins also stuck to the wrappers really bad. I would blame the wrappers but i've used them in the past with no issues. I will say I like the oatmeal in the muffin

They were kind of dry, but that didn't stop me from eating them all!  Easy to make.  Maybe some more applesauce will moisten them up a little.

Followed the directions exactly, and it turned out well. Using paper muffin cups made some of the muffin sides stick to the paper, but only while warm. I think the taste would be better with Craisins instead of chocolate chips.

This is a perfect base recipe.  I read the other reviews prior to making mine, so I went ahead and made recommended changes. I used all-purpose flour, added extra banana, salt, vanilla, a little extra milk (used 2%) and a tbsp. of butter.  They are delicious.

I followed the advice of another comment and added some sour cream, a little salt and butter. I made these with all purpose flour. I also added cinnamon. Not as healthy but so good! I whipped the eggs as well.

I will definitely use this recipe as a base again... I changed some ingredients to what I had on hand. :)  I cut the sugar in half, by using 1/4 cup Turbinado sugar, 1 tsp Stevia, & 1 Tbsp maple syrup.  I didn't have applesauce, so I used coconut oil.  In addition to 2 bananas (1 Cup), I added the fresh frozen (thawed) fruit I needed to use up :), 1 cup rhubarb diced small, 1/4 cup chopped bing cherries, 1/4 cup plums.  The results are a nice spongy, light, healthy muffin high in antioxidants.  Not tart, and not too sweet.

Great recipe that is very adaptable to taste.  I soaked the oats first in double the amount of 1% milk.  Used 2 bananas and then extra applesauce to equal 3 cups combined.  Both these additions made the muffins very moist.  I also used brown sugar (about 3/4 cup) instead of white and added nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and extra chocolate chips.  With these changes the recipe was 5 stars and my kids were begging for more.

The muffins were moist and light, with a great texture, so I like the base recipe (with more milk -- I added more from the get-go to get the batter right).  With modifications it is my go to recipe.  I upped the bananas to 3-1/2 or 4, increased the oatmeal by a quarter cup, and added some salt and vanilla.  I almost always put in chopped walnuts and use mini chocolate chips.  Sometimes I put in cinnamon or chia seeds, or replace 1/4 cup of the flour with flax seed.  Every now and then I add 2 tbs coconut oil instead of more milk. With these changes, I get 12 muffins and one mini-loaf. They are awesome.  But do be careful not to bake them too long — they take 15-16 mins in my oven.

Delicious! This recipe has inspired me to make this, or versions of this, for a decent chunk of my daily nutrition. It's the perfect balance of hearty and sweet. Not too heavy. I used all purpose flour but it still stuck with me through the day. I pulsed my oats to make them instant oatmeal consistency and blended all of my wet ingredients. New favorite muffin!  I also added pumpkin seeds to one, and they toast up and definitely add good crunch and  a few more nutrients.  Not bitter at all. Enjoy!

These are really good.   My picky kids are eating them.  But they are sticking to the paper liners and leaving about an eighth on a muffin that I can not get off.  But the flavour is good.  My three year old helped bake them and they turned out really good.

Left a gritty aftertaste, substituted coconut oil for applesauce as there was none in the cupboard.

I am on a restricted diet right now but was looking for something sweet. I made these with gluten free flour and carob chips instead of chocolate chips. I used 1-1/2 cups bananas instead of the applesauce and added 1/4 t ginger. It made 16 good size muffins. I adjusted the cooking temp to 350 and cooked for 20 minutes and they came out perfect.

Great texture, but a bit tastes too much like banana and I'd like to taste a bit more of oatmeal.

Favourite muffin ever! I made only a few changes: 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1/4 cup applesauce for the vegetable oil. Had no pecans so used sliced almonds. Instead of plain oats I used my homemade muesli mix (oats, pepitas, flaked coconut, dried cherries & walnuts). They turned out fabulous and my husband loves them too and they're much healthier than the bakery cookies or muffins we usually buy. Thanks for the recipe!

I used applesauce and spenda and quick oats. Added some vanilla and 1/2tsp salt as others recommended. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  For no fat and no sugar, pretty good!  I would continue to make these rather than traditional banana bread when I want to avoid eating the whole pan of something pretty awful for me...

Delicious!  Smelled so good coming out of the oven.  I subbed honey for the white sugar, and used dark chocolate chips.   The dark chocoloate chips really make this dish!  Very moist texture for the muffins too, unlike many whole wheat recipes.  Doesn't not taste like health food for those of you who are put off by whole wheat.   I will definitely make again!

Muffins were quite good. I followed the advice of some reviewers and added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and ground flax. I used quick oats, as someone had suggested substituting that and also added some walnuts...very nice and I will make them again.

Did not like these muffins at all.   Followed the recipe exactly except used all purpose instead of whole wheat flour.  The tops were nicely browned but they were chewy/gummy and really lacking flavour.  There is barely any banana flavour to them and they really stick to the paper liners.  Sorry but we just did not like these.

These were pretty good, but they really need salt. Some vanilla might help as well. I'll probably make them again with those additions.

First time making them & they're fantastic muffins!  I used coconut oil & olive oil (1/2 cup total) instead of the applesauce, and 1/2 cup of milk (actually used Kefir as it was handy) rather than 1/4, and substituted 1/2 cup of the WW flour for Almond Flour.

5 stars WITH CHANGES!!! Used a bit more applesauce (about a tbsp or 2 more), added about 1/2 tbsp butter, 1/2 cup Brown Sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 sour cream instead of skim milk, instant oats, 4 very ripe bananas very well mashed, 1 and a half tsp full of vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, mini muffin tins sprayed, added a variety of fruits because I was out of choc chips. Note that I mixed the banana egg etc mixture in the stand mixer to make it as smooth as possible because I used brown sugar which gets lumpy, and also because I didn't melt the butter. Added some blueberries in some and some banana chips in others and nothing in others. Baked at 400 for 15 min, cooled for 5 in tins, moved to wire rack. Not sure if this is all necessary but... I like the hearty taste, the grainy of the wheat flour. I can't stand sponge white flour muffins anymore. So far my picky kids are eating them like there is no tomorrow. (They are just out of the oven).

Very yummy!! Easy to make, used all whole wheat flour, used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added extra bananas, used oil and 2% milk. They turned out beautiful after 15 minutes in the oven and they did not stick to the muffin liners.

Too dense and hard to swallow. I didn't have any wheat flour so I used all purpose and that made the difference! I may go back to the other recipes and try them again with all purpose flour.

Love these!  I make these regularly.  I use 3 medium to large bananas instead of the one cup, it makes them more moist and I always use paper baking cups.  Also use mini chocolate chips.

I made many of the changes suggested by other reviewers - added 1/2 tsp salt, vanilla,  slightly increased the milk (including a dash of cream), a tbsp of oil, and slightly reduced the oats, in an effort to ensure they wouldn't be dry. I also took them out of the oven a little early as a precaution. Even so, way too dry for my taste. I think you have to substitute more oil or butter for most of the applesauce or take other steps to make these moist.

I didn't have wheat flour, so I had to use white flour.  They were so good that I can't wait to try it with the wheat flour.  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar because it is less dense and not as sweet.

I did add a 1/2 t salt.  I beat the eggs and then added the banana pieces along with the milk and applesauce, and beat again.  I like to incorporate more air into the liquid ingredients to make a less dense finished product.  My entire family loved them.  Even the picky eaters :)

The cooking temp is way too high. First batch burned so I turned down second batch to 350 for 16 mins, perfect! Also used quick oats. Very tasty. Could easily substitute many ingredients for your personal taste and health needs. Very flexible!

Made this recipe for a quick breakfast and it turned out great! Used Quaker Old Fashioned instant oatmeal instead of rolled oats and dark chocolate chips instead of milk because that's what I had at home. I probably put a little extra nuts because we are texture eaters and like that better. Also didn't have any applesauce so I made it with an apple, little lemon juice + cinnamon + water in the Vitamix. Everything worked out great! The hubs really liked them and didn't even realize they were healthy. Froze half individually wrapped in foil and have been defrosting them for breakfast as needed. They are super delicious if you cut them in half and spread some peanut butter - plus a cup of coffee....heaven. Into the breakfast roster this goes! Thanks!

First time making these. Took one of the reviewers recommendations of swapping honey for the sugar and adding vanilla. Great recipe! Really sweet, the honey (I had put in 1/2 c total) is very prominent so I think I would maybe add more vanilla and apple sauce and less honey next time. I would make this again!

These turned out great! I am so glad I made them despite the poor reviews.

The only things I did differently was add a bit of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. I baked them until the top was golden brown. Because of the apple sauce (which keeps them constantly moist), I decided to put them in the fridge which I hope will help extend the freshness. I would definitely make these again!

I added vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon and its still pretty bland. Not the best texture, it did rise nicely. Also "healthy" I think refunded sugar is WAY more of a concern than using a healthy oil or butter so I will keep looking for a breakfast muffin recipie.

Only used half of the recipe except Bananas 
Did not use sugar
Did not use chocolate
Used olive oil instead of applesauce 
Used a pack of brown sugar instant oatmeal instead of rolled oats.
Used Almond milk instead of skim milk.

I didn't have all of or enough of everything except Bananas. That's why I did half of the recipe. The Bananas made up for the sugar that I didn't add.

Tastes great.

I made this recipe and the only change was that I used white chocolate chips instead of dark or milk. I loved them, especially considering no butter or oil was used. They are also only 4 points on Weight Watchers, so a great grab and go breakfast.

The only change I made was using 1 C normal flour and 1\2 C whole wheat flour.  I didn't measure the banana, just used one large banana. At exactly 16 minutes I took them from the oven, and they were a little over-baked.  But they tasted good, I like the ingredients, our 3-year-old ate them.   For my oven, I think they would be better if removed after 15 minutes.

I used all purpose flour instead of wheat, because it is what I had on hand. I will use wheat next time to keep with the "healthy" idea, and may try it with a little less sugar. This is a decent recipe for being "healthy"!

Probably one of the best healthy recipe I've tried! I changed the sugar for 2 tablespoon of mapple syrup, I just had pears instead of apple sauce, so I made pear sauce! Then I put dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips and pumpkin seeds at the top!

I left out the sugar and used pear butter for the applesauce.  I think they are very good with the bit of spice and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Love this recipe! Used all of the same ingredients except for a few substitutions- coconut sugar instead of white sugar- and I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  The applesauce is wonderful but I discovered that it became very sticky in the oven and the batter adhered to the baking cups. Next time I think I would make this in bread form or avoid using the baking cups.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

I'm really surprised at the 5* reviews.  Did those people REALLY use whole wheat flour?  I confess - I modified the recipe and only used 1/2 c. whole wheat and 1 cup of white flour... but the result was that the muffins were STILL really heavy in texture.  I also have to say I agree with the reviewers who said the flavor was bland.  Maybe some cinnamon should be added?  Either way, between the oats and the whole wheat, the texture is really dense.  I'm all for "healthy" muffins but I don't think I'll make these again.

I think this recipe is a bit bland. Next time I will add some spices...cinnamon for sure and maybe some nutmeg and vanilla.  I used half whole wheat, half all purpose flour. I didn't have applesauce so I used 1/4 c canola oil and upped the milk to 1/3 c and extra banana.  They are moist and baked up well, just needs a little more flavor in my opinion.

I really liked this recipe and cannot stop eating them. I used brown sugar instead of white, used sour cream instead of skim milk, used melted Earth Balance spread instead of applesauce and added 1 tsp of vanilla.

While I altered the ingredients a little (soy milk, vanilla, flax seeds, less sugar + honey instead), these are dense and do get a little dry. I made full size and minis - at least they look cute, taste isn't half bad.

Loved this recipe. Like other bakers I changed a few things. First of all I doubled the recipe and used butter instead of applesauce. I used 1 cup rolled oats but pulsed it in the food processor for a finer texture. I used 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour instead of all whole wheat flour. I added 1/2 tsp salt,  1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I doubled the milk as advised by others. Doubling the recipe made 12 cupcake size muffins and 1 large bread loaf and added walnuts to the top of the loaf only. My husband and kids loved it so oooooooh much....... It was super delish!

I loved this recipe. I did have to make changes because of diabetes. I used Splenda in place of sugar, light soy milk in place of milk and broken up sugar free Hershey bars in place of chocolate chips. I loved this recipe because I can eat it with minor changes. It was moist and It didn't taste healthy. It tastes good diabetic or not.

These muffins are delicious.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 t salt, add a little bit of flax meal, and use quick cooking oats.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a hit for the whole family.

Just baked up these beauts!  Made a few adjustements - I blended up the oats a bit (measuring after blended) , instead of 1/2 c sugar used 1/3 c Agave, doubled the milk to 1/2 c, added 1 tsp vanilla and added chopped up dates instead of chocolate chips. Heaped up the scooping a bit more and baked at 375 for 18mins.  These are definitely going to be a morning go to! Might add ground flax and chia next time.

These muffins were perfect for me as part of my whole grains/healthy diet. They were quite tasty and very filling. They looked nice enough to serve to guests when I brought them out of the oven. I plan to make these more often! As a note, I substituted almond milk for skim milk and Splenda for sugar, and they were still delicious.

I thought these were very good, but I was a little disappointed in the calories of these, especially with no oil or butter.  I followed the recipe as written and don't know that I would change anything because I like my muffins a little chewy.  2nd time making, reduced chocolate chips in half and that cut calories from 190 to 175.  Ian loves these!

After reading several reviews, I decided to switch out the sugar for organic honey with cinnaman ( same amount), then I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, used instant oatmeal instead of large flake oatmeal, used 3 large bananas, added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 flaked unsweetened coconut, didn't use applesauce or milk but instead added 3/4 cup of coconut milk, then added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. They turned out perfect! Beautiful texture and NOT too sweet but just sweet enough so I consider it a treat!

Mine were very heavy and dense. I didn't like them at first. Not sure if quick cooking oats make a difference. However, after I froze them and warmed them up two days later I liked them. Yes, they are a denser muffin but they are tasty & healthy.

Our favorite muffins by far! Substituted coconut milk for skim milk; added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Used chocolate chips made from coconut instead. Delish!

I made these muffins this morning for the grandkids.  They loved them! So did I. I did not have whole wheat flour so I had to use white. I will definitely be keeping this recipe handy!

After a little alteration and much calculation they are only 86 calories each!  I was looking for a yummy, healthy banana muffin recipe and stumbled upon this one.  In an effort to reduce the calories a bit more (and since they were in season) I replaced the chocolate chips with a cup of fresh blueberries and they are delicious!  ENJOY!

Followed the recipe exactly -- or so I thought until already in the oven.  I had left out the milk.  In after thought, the milk really isn't needed as the dough had plenty of liquid without it.  (I think it was probably due to the fact that I used frozen bananas, which tend to have an abundance of liquid.)  In any event, this recipe makes a great dense, healthy breakfast muffin.  Love that it's made with whole wheat flour, and the chocolate puts it over the top.  Thanks, Nicole, for a good recipe!

Really good! I definitely needed to double  it! I added an extra banana, substituted butter for apple sauce ,(because we did not have any), added more milk, and added some cinnamon and salt. (I read some reviews) Loved the oats in it, it added a different texture that I liked.  I also baked it in a square pan. Can't wait to bake it again! (As muffins, possibly doubled. )

made a batch of 48 the first time I tried this recipe. I added some frozen blueberries raspberries and Blackk berries just for more flavour and they turned out so great! I used any old Apple sauce cups I had a around even a cranberry Apple sauce and I used homogenized milk instead of skim because it's all I had. I used quick oats too! This recipe is super flexible and great for when you need to get rid off a few frozen banks and any other stuff in your fridge! Tailor and flavour it to your preference and it still turns out great!

Made these today. They came out pretty good. Even my picky husband liked them. I did have to make a few changes based on what I had on hand (quick oats, dark chocolate chips, white whole wheat flour, and 2% milk), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will make again.

I think it's a good recipe to customize in your own way. Which is what I did. I used egg whites only & light almond milk which I increased by a little for more moisture. I put some baby carrots through the food processor and used them instead of applesauce because I didn't have any. I also used a combination of gluten free, unbleached white and flax meal for the flour. Used 1/2 raw honey & 1/2 brown sugar. I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, a couple tablespoons of melted Earth Balance and a pinch of salt. Also, per other suggestions, a teaspoon of vanilla. Honestly, the thing I liked the least was the chocolate. The bites with multiple chocolate. Chips are sooooo sweet! I'm not a huge fan of chocolate like some people but I made these mostly for some guests I'm having. Maybe the tiny chocolate chips and less of them? I believe I would prefer these with raisins or dates instead of chocolate chips. I will make them again but will try raisins and maybe some pecans.

They are amazing! Now, the best recommendation I can give is that you use a very ripe banana. Trust me when I tell you that the texture is much more moist/tasteful when you use a ripe one rather than a regular yellow/green one. I also add almonds shavings or cranberries depending if I have those ingredients in stock. You can always add something to them. I usually warm them up in the oven or microwave because they do tend to get a little hard the day after. I have them as snacks or for breakfast and I accompany them with some peanut butter or greek yogurt. My husband makes me bake these every two weeks mainly because they're low cal and filling.

I just made these and had one fresh out of the oven! I made a couple changes to the recipe after reading some reviews. I added 1/2 cup of milk (I used organic plain soy milk) and instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar I used 1/4 cup of honey. I cut down the sugar to make these healthier. I also used instant oats because that is what I had on hand.  I ended up having enough batter for 14 muffins (may have been the extra milk). They tasted yummy fresh out of the oven. The chocolate chips add just the right amount of sweet. I put the recipe into my fitness pal and each muffin came out to 144 calories per muffin (26 carbs, 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of protein, 10 grams of sugar...still a bit much sugar for my taste) with the changes!

I loved this! I did change it a little to make it somewhat healthier. Instead of 2 large eggs, I used 1 medium egg & 1 egg white. Instead of rolled oats, I used old fashioned oats. Instead of skim milk, I used sweetened vanilla almond milk. Instead of white sugar, I used organic cane sugar. Turned out delicious & moist.

We make these often in a double batch and my kiddos love them!  They sneak them when they think I'm not looking as if they are getting away with eating "junk" food - if they only knew that they are a healthier "cupcake".  I follow the directions, with the exception that I add a splash of vanilla.  When doubling I use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, so that they aren't as wheaty tasting and dense

Ok well. I made lots of alterations and it turned out perfect and super healthy. I made it as mini cupcakes. I used 1/2c milk, 3/4c apple sauce, 1/4c desicated coconut instead of choc chips, 1/4c brown sugar, 1/4c white sugar. 1c 1/4 of wholemeal flour. 
So i used more milk and apple sauce, and used brown sugar instead. It was still quite sweet so next time, I'm cutting down on white sugar. 

1 batch i did that, the second batch, i used the same recipe but i added very finally food processed carrots, so you couldn't really taste it but its a healthy addition! Delicious :) Very spongey and perfect. So healthy. Next time I might add more oats though. I also added 2 tsp vanilla essence

I didn't use the whole wheat flour, but regular flour. Everything else was the same.  It seemed a little bland, so I probably would add nutmeg or cinnamon next time. The highlight was the chocolate chips, not too much banana flavor either.

Instead of whole wheat flour, I used 1/4 cup coconut flour and 1/4 cup almond flour.  Added a 3rd egg and a bit more applesauce.  I also used brown instead of white sugar.  I thought they came out perfectly.  Easy to modify to your preferences.  Great!

We all loved this!  No substitutions at all...a great way to use the extra bananas from a warehouse store purchase.  Delicious and healthy, just the right amount of sweetness and plenty moist.  I felt good about baking and eating these, and giving them to my whole family!

Great muffin with a wonderful after taste!  They could be a little moister, but for a straight whole wheat muffin they were perfect.  They were a hit with all the toddlers!
