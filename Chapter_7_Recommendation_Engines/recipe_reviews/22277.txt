True, it is easy, and I like the addition of caramel candies and the pecans on top.  However, it tastes too floury.  And, at least from my experience, 50 minutes at 350 is not nearly enough cooking time.  I would not make it again.

This was my first time making an apple pie and it turned out great. I just finished eating a slice. After reading that some found it sweet and too runny I added 4 TBSP  of flour and 1/2 cup sugar to the apple (I used 6 Granny Smith apples) mixture as reviewers suggested. I changed the taffy by using 1/3 cup cup brown sugar, 3TBSP of flour and 3TBSP of butter. It was not too sweet and was wonderful with vanilla ice cream.

I used a little over 3 cups of apples and after reading previous reviews, only 1/4 cup of flour.  I also left out the lemon juice because I didn't have any on hand.  The pie was really sweet, but really good!

I made this pie and it was loved. It was not floury tasting. And it is not a traditional apple, so it does not taste like it. The apples balanced the sweetness of the caramel. Very good and different!

This recipe was delicious! The only change I made was I only used 2 apples.  Other than that one change this recipe was easy and very good.

OMW! I actually had this recipe and lost it and was elated when I saw that someone posted it ..it's one of my husband's favorites and I couldn't find it in my recipe box. 

Excited to see his reaction when he comes home and I promise his response will be "this taste incredible". :)

This was OK but it was more like a tart than a pie.
