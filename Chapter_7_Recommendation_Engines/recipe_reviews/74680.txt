Hi all, I just wanted to note that some of my suggestions were deleted by allrecipes when they posted this.  I make this using a round dish not a square one.  This makes a difference in how evenly it cooks.  I have used the stack cooker by tupperware and the largest round stainshield by rubbermaid.  Things you can try to change up the taste: adding a can of green chillies, or salsa, or topping with crushed crackers (cheese-its, Ritz, or chicken-in-a-biscuit, etc), or topping with fried onions (original or cheese flavored), fried jalapenos.  Combine a few of these or just try one.  Just gives you some different takes on this recipe.  NOTE: Really doesn't need more salt especially with any of these add-in ideas.  Maybe pepper though!

First off, let me say
ThankyouThankyouThankyou!
I'm a college student who misses cooking, but my dorm only has a microwave and we're not allowed heating elements, so my opportunities are limited. I just tried this recipe and I'm amazed at how good it is. I didn't have any trouble heating it; I used a smaller casserole dish and only used half a bag of tater tots, and it heated fairly thoroughly, though I think next time I'll defrost the tots for longer. Also, when I stirred the mixture into the tots, my broke up a lot of them with my spoon and I think that made it heat more thoroughly.
All in all, great recipe. I'll be making this a lot in the next few years !

This was easy and pretty tasty.  I had some ingredients to use up so I did shredded hashbrowns and velveeta instead of tater tots and cheddar, and doubled the sour cream.  I didn't have cr chx with herbs, so I added pepper, basil, oregano, garlic salt, and minced onion to plain cr chx soup.  With the cheese and ham I probably could have done garlic powder--it got a little salty.  Plan on taking more like 20 min to cook with stirring about every 5 min.

I made this dish the other night and it was difficult to get it to heat all the way through (it may have been my microwave.) I just scooped some out onto a plate and heated it up. It was delicious! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is definately cheesy!  I nuked it in a round dish as mentioned by the author, it helped a bit, but there were still cool pockets.  The tater tots started to break down when stirring it all together.  I believe frozen hash browns would work just as well.

So far so good, but I began trying to fit a 9 x 13 in a microwave that doesn't suit it.  Thanks.

I added 2 lb. beef instead of the ham.  Also sprinkled cheddar cheese on the top as it was baking.  Super easy!  Will be making it again

A nice, easy way to make a balanced meal and use up the leftover ham from Christmas.  It uses ingredients many people have on hand, as I did.  Only thing, I didn't have shredded cheddar, so I used shredded mozarella.  Pretty good - but I bet the cheddar would have been a bit better.  Husband is picky and he liked it.

Not much for casseroles, but had the ingredients on hand so gave it a try. It was pretty good. Certainly easy to make!

This was well liked by my family. The cooking time was not long enough. I doubled it to 10 minutes and it was still cold in spots.
