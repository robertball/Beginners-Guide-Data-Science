I put this all together last night after I got off work and DH grilled it tonight.  What a super easy recipe and I just happened to have some Shiraz wine in the house (as DH belongs to a wine club).  I think any good "red" wine would be fine, but who knows for sure.  Why mess with "perfection"!!  DH called me at work to tell me how "perfect" this dish was.  He absolutely loved it and he is the one that gave it this rating.  Thanks for a super easy, tasty dish.  Make sure you do the "dip" part, i.e. thickening of the marinade.  DH says it was totally awesome even without, but loved it even more with the "dip".

I make this every time we have salmon. We haven't found a better marinade yet!! I skip the lemon pepper only because it's such a small amount that you don't even notice it's in there. And I have found that if I try to mix the corn starch in cold water before the marinade is boiling....it doesn't thicken the sauce like it should. I place the salmon on a bed of rice and pour the sauce over top, it's excellent!!

I made this last week and my family is already asking for it again.  My daughter ate most of mine and my husband is only a minor fan of Salmon - both loved it.  

I did cut the soy sauce in 1/2 and used a low sodium soy sauce because several had said too salty - other than that I followed the recipe.

Salmon was very flavorful. Family really liked the "gravy". Will make this again as it was a complete family hit.

This is probably the best salmon I've ever eaten, and my meat-and-potatoes husband also thought it was fantastic. We were afraid it would stick to our yukky grill grate, so we enclosed the fish in a doubled-up foil packet sprayed with olive oil, and it came out great. Plenty of flavor even without the sauce.

Fantastic! I used a pinot noir, only made 2 salmon filets but made all the marinade & used the remainder of the sauce (after it was thickened) to glaze caramelized pearl onions. I cooked these inside on a grill pan. I make salmon often & hubby said this is his favorite recipe...thanks! I served this w/ sangria (great use for the rest of that wine!), the glazed caramelized pearl onions, steamed green beans & strawberry panna cotta for dessert. Really enjoyable dinner!

This is by far my husband and I's favorite salmon recipe EVER.  My husband asks for this salmon all the time.  I sometimes don't make the gravy, so I know it is just as good with or without!  I usually make it with white rice and green veggie, but it is good with jasmine rice too.  Oooh and drizzling the sauce over the rice is so yummy too!

My husband really likes salmon, but I never have. I decided to try this recipe, and it was fantastic! We especially enjoyed the dipping sauce. This was so easy to make, and didn't take much time at at all. This recipe will definitely be put into our meal rotation.

Absolutely delicious!  I only marinated the salmon for 3 hours and that was honestly enough for me, but what makes this a killer dish is the "gravy."  All I can say is try it, you'll like it!

This is a very good salmon recipe.  It is similar to many others but stands well on its own.  I made the marinade with only a couple of changes: I halved the olive oil and I used lemon juice and black pepper instead of lemon-pepper.  I also marinated for 3 hours instead of overnight since I really donâ€™t believe marinating fish any longer has much effect.  I grilled the salmon on a small grill on medium for 8 minutes skin side up (skin removed) and for 6 minutes skin side down.  This was done perfectly.  I served the salmon with the marinade and steamed potatoes.  As I said above, very good salmon.  Thanks RK.

I raised my family in Alaska so we eat a lot of salmon. My daughter made this for her family the same night that I made it for my husband and myself. My daughter and her family loved it; hubby and myself not so much. I just couldn't get past the fact that the sauce looked and tasted a lot like the gravy in a frozen TV dinner.  Another reviewer stated, the sauce does not go well with salmon, and I agree.  Alaskan Firecrqcker Salmon from this site is still our "go to" recipe. I will not make this again.

Awesome! Even my fish-phobic kids like this, they'll eat anything if there's "gravy".  I have made this 3 times now, have found that 1/2 cup of soya sauce is enough, I use 1 tsp lemmon pepper, and although marinating overnight is best, if you don't have time 2-3 hours will do just fine. It is best grilled on a cedar plank, but if you can't you can bake in the oven on parchment paper @ 400F for 10 min per inch of thickness measured at biggest part of fillet. You MUST MUST MUST make the sauce. This recipe makes just over a cup of "gravy", so if you have a lot of salmon you may want to double the recipe, but it is quite rich and a little goes a long way. For the reviewer who used water instead of wine and didn't like it, it's because you didn't follow the recipe!!! I always use Shiraz because that's what I like to drink anyway, but I think a Merlot or Cabernet would work too. Definitely a keeper, good enough for company! I like this served with a wild rice pilaf and grilled asparagus or peppers with olive oil, lemon pepper and sea salt. This marinade was good on rainbow trout too.

This is some of the best salmon I've ever tasted. I didn't have a grill available, so I baked it, covered, in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. I've made it with various types of dry red wine (not just Shiraz) and it's wonderful every time. Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Tried a 2hr vs. 24hr marinating time.  With the sauce, either version was great!  The 24hr marinated salmon definitely had much greater flavor and good color, so great even without the sauce (better with though!).  Therefore, the longer you have to marinate the better!  Note: I used a very fruity Shiraz.

This was excellent! I was not able to marinate it the recommended amount of time, but even after 4 hours of marinating it was delicious. I have three boys who are 5, 4, and 2, who all asked for seconds on this!

This was a good recipe. I marinated early in the morning and kept in the fridge all day. Served with steamed green beans and whole wheat couscous.

I'm always looking for new ways to fix salmon and this recipe sounded pretty good.  I used half the amount of soy sauce called for but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I liked it very much and I will definitely make it again.

This marinade is spectacular!  I marinated it for about 8 hours and the flavor wasn't really overpowering.  The only thing I didn't do was boil the leftover marinade to serve with it.  That didn't seem very appealing to me.

Fantastic!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I did find I had quite a bit of "sauce" and might cut down on the recipe next time.  Guests loved it :)

Positively the best salmon recipe I have ever had.  I have cooked this for dinner parties and get rave reviews every time.  I prefer to just reduce the marinade,  but it is still good if you are in a hurry and use the starch.  Serve it on wild rice with the sauce poured over.   Delicious!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used a cabernet wine since that's what I had on hand.  I have made this with shiraz too, but any bold red wine works great. I marinated for only 4 hours, which was plenty because the salmon came out so moist and flavorful.  I grilled them on the George Foreman (425 degrees for 6 minutes).  For the sauce, I let it simmer for a good 5 minutes to reduce it a little and let the alcohol cook off.  Served the salmon and sauce over rice and with a side of "Sesame Green Beans" from this side.  It was an awesome dinner!

This is a great change up recipe for salmon.  Our family has grilled salmon frequently (usually on a plank)and there always seems to be some left over.  Not the case with this recipe.  It was all gone!  I  following the recipe as published including the overnight marinade.  The key was the dipping sauce (it was sweet) which gave the salmon a different twist.  We will definitely have this again soon.

I'm afraid I have to go against the majority on this one.  It was way too salty!!  The soy sauce was overkill.  It was a waste of good salmon (and good wine).

I made this as the recipe states, using a beautiful 1+-pound sockeye filet.  Living in the Pacific NW where the salmon stands on its own without lots of extra sauces or flavors needed, I think we're spoiled.  While this was good, and the flavors were interesting for a change, and cooking it on the grill was especially nice, we'll probably stick with a simpler preparation of lemon, onion, S&P. Thanks for sharing your recipe, RebeccaKalakota!

TO DIE FOR!!! Perfect the way it is wouldn't change a thing! Wasn't a big fan of Salmon, gave this recipe a try, and I am in love! Had it last night for dinner. My husband did such a good job grilling it just right and this marinade made it PERFECT! Now, I can't stop thinking about it!!!

This is quite possibly the best salmon recipe I've every tried, and I've tried a lot!  My husband and I both like a darker marinade and this has just the perfect blend of flavors. Even when I didn't have time to marinade it for long it was still delicious. I like being able to add the sauce when serving as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! The marinade is great. I only let mine sit for about 4 hours and it was tasty. Using the marinade as a sauce is pretty salty. If you think 'steak sauce' it might work. But I added some honey to mine to cut the saltiness. May just cut back initially on the soy sauce in the future.

Very easy. Kind of expensive (you might want to use a different wine, e.g., cabernet will work just fine). Very, very tasty. I found the sauce a little too sweet for my taste: next time I make it IÂ´ll use less  brown sugar

This was an amazing way to grill salmon. We only managed to marinate for 4 hours and it was fantastic. I can only imagine how the salmon would have tasted after 4 more hours. Definitely on the family's most wanted list. ;)

I had to try this simply because I have never seen a red wine salmon marinade before. The fish was very tasty, and the gravy was good, but I think I love the taste of salmon too much to make this recipe a bunch. Great to change it up, though - thanks for the recipe, I plan on trying with chicken next!

I did not like this dish at all. The sauce tasted like a very thick teriyaki sauce. I ended up scraping off all the sauce from the top of my salmon and still did not like the flavor of the fish. I followed the recipe - but used water in place of the wine - b/c I did not have any on hand. I used my grill pan and just did not like this dish.

Given all the great reviews, I was hoping to love this. I made exactly as it is and found that the large amount of liquid marinade changes the texture of the fresh salmon even when grilled. The sauce had an overwhelmingly salty flavor. All 3 salmon lovers in my family thought it was just ok, and that it hurt the texture and flavor of good fish.

I'm sorry but this was way too sweet. I followed this recipe to the T except I used merlot and marinated it less. I thought that the marinade was too strong a flavor for the already strong salmon. It just overpowered the fish too much. I only marinated it for 4 hrs. Usually, when I read a bad review amongst many rave reviews I say to myself, oh they just did something wrong. Maybe I did do something wrong by using merlot. But really, I love Salmon and don't think that this marinade goes well with it. Sorry.

This is a winner, made it for Sunday dinner and it was the best Salmon ever. I marinated it for eight hours but next time I will marinate it over night. I put it on my Webber charcoal kettle and cooked it to flakey perfection as I normally do but I have never marinated Salmon and I'm tellin you this is really good. Do yourself a favor and try this. I have to thank the person that submitted this recipe, I just can't say enough about it. Thank You

Oh my gosh! This was so good! I haven't had alot of salmon in my life, but this is for sure the best one I've had. The sauce was excellent & we even dipped our grilled zucchini in it. I didn't have Shiraz wine, so used Merlot. Definitely a repeater. Thanks for the recipe.

Used cab sauvignon instead of Shiraz (already opened) and didn't have lemon pepper so just used lemon juice and black pepper.  Marinated for over 24 hours.  It was good but a little sweet for my taste.  When I make it again, I might try adding some balsamic vinegar.

Followed directions to the T. There was a lot of sauce left over and my boys didn't even like the sauce.  The marinated fish was good though. Might make again.

This is a wonderful recipe and I would give it more stars if I could.  I followed the recipe exactly and marinated the salmon for about 24 hours.  It had great flavor and we didnt even need the dipping sauce.  I'm already planning to make this for company soon.

The salmon was great cooked this way.  I am not a big fan of soy sauce so I only used  1/4 cup instead of the half cup.  I used the red wine I had opened. It turned out great will be adding this to my list of favorite dishes.

I made this recipe and my husband and I both loved it.  I followed it exactly and just used whatever red wine we had open.  I will definitely make this again - great for grilling for my friends who dont like meat.  It is a keeper.

Really liked this recipe! I actually dislike salmon - it's too strong of a flavor for me. But since my husband loves the fish, I cut half the salmon for me and used this recipe. I marinated it for only 4 hours (and had to use dark brown sugar) but it still had lots of flavor. And when I made the sauce (flour instead of cornstarch & it worked just fine) it made it even better. I'll definitely make this again!

this is now in the top 2 of my salmon recipes. i marinated the salmon in the morning so it didnt get the full 24 hours, but it was still very good. i also cooked the salmon in my oven for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees, per other recipe directions. i think this salmon would even be good if you didnt have time to marinade and just threw some sauce over it to cook and made the gravy to go with it. i was nervous about gravy on my fish, but it went perfectly with it. (in fact we went back for more gravy.) i had never used shiraz wine before, but i will now for sure.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  I would make sure you use low sodium soy sauce or its way too salty.  I guess also the type of wine you use could make a difference.  Thanks for sharing.

The sauce was very good.  I added more cornstarch because I like a thick sauce as opposed to a thin sauce.  Overall a keeper

I made this last night and it was FABULOUS.  I did not change anything about the recipe and was perfect as it is.  My entire family loved it, even my kids who are 1, 3, 5 & 7!  One daughter did not like the dipping sauce but had two large pieces without it.  It's great with or without the sauce.  Next time I make it I will probably cut the soy sauce in half just to cut back on the sodium.  Don't be afraid to try the recipe - you won't be disappointed.  Especially great for those who are not sure they are fish lovers!

I found this recipe and my husband made it. We followed the recipe exactly. He really liked it because it was good and easy. I do not care for fish as much as he does and I just thought it was okay. The flavor was very similar to teriyaki. We used frozen salmon and my husband said next time he'll use fresh to make it even better.

Added some red pepper flakes because we like stuff with a little spice and really enjoyed this! We only let it marinade for a few hours and will let it sit overnight next time.

Made this for Canada Day BBQ at friends. My wife doesn't do garlic so I substituted ginger. Also used whiskey rather than water with the brown sugar. I left most of the skin on, put it on foil and did it to medium on a hot grill. This dish turned out fantastic and the 'gravy' puts It over the top....great reviews. Definitely a keeper for me.

I have made this for friends that do not like to eat fish..... they want this at every gathering.  I do let it sit for 12-24 hours until the salmon turns purple..... and over cook it to candy the tips.... yummy!

FABULOUS!! What a classy recipe! My husband and I love salmon, but I know that salmon does have a potent taste. The marinade and sauce makes the salmon very tasty to anyone who is "so-so" on salmon. 
I only made a couple changes:
1. Used only 1/4 cup soy sauce.
2. I didn't have a grill, so I marinated the salmon overnight in a covered casserole dish, then baked it at 350 for 20 minutes in the same dish. After the salmon was cooked, I transferred it to another dish, poured the sauce into a pot and thickened. Thanks RK! We love this one!!

I would reduce the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. It's a bit over powering. I used the "gravy" for the fish and for some steamed veges (see pic). Will make again!

We really enjoyed this recipe for the salmon, but moreover, I found the marinade/sauce goes good with just about any kind of meat.  I've served it over steak (personal favorite), pork chops and chicken and it easily turns any of them into a special meal.

I am incredibly picky about seafood. If it tastes like fish it all, I don't like it. The marinade for this salmon is so delicious though, this is one of the few fish recipes I really enjoy. Thank you.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. I changed a few things the second time around and I liked it a little better, but all-in-all this is a great recipe. Below is what I changed:
-I used a blush wine instead, which gave it a slight berry flavor
-I left out the lemon pepper, which I liked a little better.

We really enjoyed the recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time would be just a little less soy sauce. I thought marinating it overnight was too long but found it to be very nice.

I made the recipe exactly as it is, except grilled it for a little while on a Maple plank. It does best on the grill, but the plank adds some smokey flavor. My husband and I loved this recipe. We both loved the dipping sause.

After all of the reviews, I was really hoping I would love this, but I didn't.  I am not a big fan of salmon, but I like Sockeye when it's cooked right.  I didn't like the flavor of the fish or of the gravy.  My husband liked it, but I don't think he would be upset if I didn't make it again.  Very dissappointed !!

I used regular cooking wine and it came out fantastic!!  I put the sauce in a dish for my guests to put on themselves...some didn't want it while others loved it.  It tastes great either way!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent.  It is as good as any salmon I have had in a restaurant.  The "gravy" made the dish.  I will make this again, easy and great flavor

This was really good.  I am not a salmon eater, but this is definitely a keeper.  We are not wine drinkers, so all I had was white cooking sherry, and it was still very tasty!!

My entire family enjoyed this marinade  with the salmon.  Even my 12 month old ate a couple of pieces.  Salmon is so healthy to eat, but not always the best tasting. This recipe will be made again!  Thanks a lot.
