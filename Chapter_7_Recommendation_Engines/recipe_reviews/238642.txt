All of these ingredients work well together, very creamy smoothie.  In the future, I will a little vanilla extract, think that will enhance the flavor.

This is a great recipe and my wife and kids love it. I have been on a green smoothie kick and am not real fond of banana so I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 2 cups of spinach and a cup of water. Instead of a full banana I used a half of a banana and a half of an avocado. I also bumped up the mango to a cup. My 13 year old son has early morning football practice and he said this is by far the best smoothie for him to start his day and give him an early morning boost.

Very nice. I didn't have bananas on hand, so I added a little more mangoes and added 1 tbl of honey. Thick and yummy.

This was so yummy and creamy! I was surprised that the flavors worked together, but they do. I followed the recipe and then added about 2 cups of spinach. Turned out great!
