Loved this recipe! Easy, light and refreshing. I of couse had to add some additional things for preference. First I used sesame oil instead of canola. For a better presentation I also used white and black sesame seeds. Lastly salsa isn't salsa to me with out onion, garlic and cilantro so I added some of each. FANTASTIC!

An outstanding recipe.  I used a sushi grade of Ahi Tuna and made the recipe exactly as directed.  The flavors were very complimentary of one another.  This dish presents very well for entertaining.  I only regret that I ate it before I took a photo of it, to submit.   Thanks for a keeper!!

Absolutely delicious!!  I couldn't find wasabe powder, so I just used wasabe paste.  My husband tasted the summer salsa without the tuna and didn't like it at all.  BUT when served with the tuna, both of us thought it was perfect.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Wow!  This recipe makes you look like a chef!  I cubed my tuna and cooked it in a covered skillet with a little canola oil (I don't have a grill).  I also had a little wasabi mayonnaise on the side.  It was restaurant quality.

So...  I used frozen tuna steaks, my wasabi powder is old and mild, and I substituted orange/peach/mango juice for the lime.  Still, this recipe was solidly unremarkable.  The tuna steaks needed salt, pepper, or *something* more than sesame to flavor the bites without salsa.  I ended up sprinkling my serving with cayenne to make it more interesting.

SO good!  I didn't use the wasabi powder but I did put lime zest in the salsa and it was fab!  Will do it again for sure!

This was delicious! I didn't even have to toast the sesame seeds, they got nice and crispy while cooking on the tuna.  I let them brown a lot which gave more flavor to the tuna. The salsa was incredible - I didn't even bother with the wasabi and it was very flavorful and a perfect combination with the sesame seeds.  I don't have a grill so I did this in a heavy pan on the stove top.

The summer salsa is the BEST part of this recipe.  I've made it since on it's own for tortilla chips and think it would be great with tilapia or shrimp.  This was fantastic with a nice semi dry white wine.  Fantastic!  Make sure your avocado and mango and nice and ripe.

My review is for the tuna only.  I didn't make the salsa.  I think I would have liked it better had it called for more seasoning than just the sesame seeds and a shorter cooking time.  Once it is opaque the tuna is almost well done and we much prefer it on the rare side.  Having said that, I must admit I had to cook it inside because the grill is iced in right now.  I broiled it and watched it carefully so I do think I cooked it as instructed.  Thanks anyway.

I really wanted to like this dish. The salsa is really quite good, but it can't change the fact that the tuna is just bland and plain without the salsa. I want my tuna to be delicious regardless of the sides/sauces.

This was the first time I ever had tuna steak, and oh...My...GOD!!  Was this awesome!!! This recipe was so easy, so quick, and so delicious, I felt like I was a chef in a five-star restaurant. The way those sesame seeds taste after they are grilled on the tuna is some kind of luxury. Will make this many many times over again. Changes? I did start out with a pre-marinated tuna steak which I bought from Trader Joe's. And I added a little more wasabi powder at the end because as it sat, the flavor of it seemed to subside to me. GREAT RECIPE, Thanks So Much for this!! Oh yeah, next time, might try orange juice in place of the lime. I bet that would work nicely too.

The tuna itself needed a bit more flavor. Without the salsa (which was really yummy), it wouldn't have held up.

This recipe was easy to prepare, the presentation was nice, and it tasted wonderful. CHANGES: I followed another reviewer's advice and added a little bit of onion, garlic, and fresh cilantro to the salsa, but I think it would've been good without it too.  I also used a combination of sesame oil and canola oil and sprinkled a little soy sauce on the fish before coating it with sesame seeds. NOTES: I had never cooked tuna steaks before, so I went with the 4 min per side that is stated in the recipe, but it was too long.  I think 2 to 2.5 min per side would've been enough.  To be fair, its entirely possible that I had the heat up too high.  The next time I prepare this (oh yes, there will be a next time), It will be absolutely perfect. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Wow, I impressed my wife with these.  Tuna was a little pricey at $7 each but the salsa was wonderful.

This is a huge hit at our house.  Light, fresh and flavorful.  The only changes we made are adding some small bits of crystallized ginger to the sesame seeds to coat the tuna.  I know it doesnt sound good but really, it adds a new depth of flavor that compliments the tuna and the salsa.  LOVE IT.

I enjoyed this recipe! The wasabi powder in the salsa gave a nice heat to this dish. This dish was made for the grill, but unfortunately, I live in a small apartment with no grill on hand- so I pan-seared it. This recipe says to cook the tuna until opaque, but I tend to like mine more on the rare side to preserve all of that fresh flavor. Definitely a word of advice: season this fish with s&p a good amount before cooking it. I have made that mistake of not seasoning well with this dish before. It comes out pretty bland. This dish had a nice balance of sweet and spicy with the mango and wasabi powder. This was a nice salsa that I could eat alone with tortilla chips. I added a few slices of raw baby radish to give that crunch I was missing from the recipe.
