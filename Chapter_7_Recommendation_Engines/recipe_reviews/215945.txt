Where is the green chili?  The recipe is tasty but I wouldn't call it chili verde

Four stars because of the canned chowder. I made this with some leftover homemade chicken chowder, added drained & rinsed pinto beans and freshly roasted diced green chiles.  Garnish each serving with shredded cheese, light sour cream or chopped cilantro. Delicious!

This was really good, I added a little cumin and crushed up some tortilla chips to add texture and was DELISH. Was easy and quick. Kid and husband approved as well.

I loved this recipe. I put it in the crockpot to simmer all day. I also made dumplings (1 cup flour, 1/2 cup milk, 2 tsp. baking powder and 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter)drop on top of chili and put lid back on crock pot) Dumplings will be cooked in 10 minutes.

I've been on the look-out for a tomato-free chili recipe for a while, and this is a good starting point.  I had to tweak it a bit to bump up the flavor, though.  I added a can of diced green chilis, a can of corn, and some chili powder and cumin for flavor.  I think next time I'll bump up the seasoning even more - maybe some red pepper flakes or diced jalapeno.  While I'd love to find something a little more "from scratch," the appeal of this recipe is how easy it is to throw together, and the potential to build on it to make it your own.
