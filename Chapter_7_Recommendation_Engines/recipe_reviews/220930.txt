I hope this cake isn't being passed by because of its title. The submitter calls it a bunny cake but it shouldn't be limited to just the shape of a bunny! But with only one review  I'll bet this is what's happening to this excellent and obviously overlooked recipe.  Have no misgivings about making this basic yellow layer cake.  It's merely a slight variation on the classic "One-Two-Three-Four Cake. The lemon and orange extracts  were just the right amount for a delicate flavor, not masking the beautiful, butter cake taste of this at all. That said, any flavor extract would work - or stick with just the vanilla! I did make one small but important change - as I frequently do with butter cakes as they have a  tendency to  be dry, I substituted vegetable oil for the 1/8 cup (2 T.) butter called for in this recipe.  I  baked this as cupcakes, about 20-22 minutes.  I tasted one before it was frosted and it was blue-ribbon good.  It has a beautiful, moist and tender crumb, neither too dense nor two fluffy. A cake that stands on  its own without being buried in frosting is a real winner in my book. As for the frosting, I knew I'd love it when I saw its ratio of fat to powdered sugar and its mix of both butter and shortening, offering the best qualities of both.  Make sure you use hi-ratio shortening and pure 10x cane sugar and you will have the smoothest, creamiest buttercream  you could hope for. Note:  this recipe should make a 13x9" sheet  cake,  9" layer cake or 24 cupcakes.

First time making this cake. Used 1/2 Splenda to make it more Diabetic friendly.  It was fantastic!  Those that can use all sugar will find it even better than fantastic.

This is a really good pound cake. The citrus flavors were very subtle. I may add a tad more extracts next time or even some orange or lemon zest to make it more flavorful.  

I used a lamb mold and there was extra cake batter after I filled the mold to the top. So I just found a small ramekin and made the extra in that.  Make sure to leave the cake cool in the mold for the 15 mins that the recipe calls for; if you unmold while its too hot, your cake will fall apart.  Also I froze the cake after standing it up on my platter prior to frosting it. I also had to put in a couple of long skews to hold the head a bit.  I was extra careful this year because last year my lamb was in crumbs (I used a box cake mix - don't' ever do that!;-)), so I may have overreacted.

All in all, this will likely be my cake mold recipe from now on.

I made this cake exactly as described, except that I cooked it in a six inch-high, six-inch round cake pan and, because I had extra batter, eight cupcakes.  The cake didn't bake all the way through, even though it was overdone on top, and after I took it out, it collapsed.  I've used this cake pan with numerous other recipes and never had an issue, but it may be important to use a shallow pan with this recipe.  The cupcakes came out fine, but I didn't like the texture, which was weirdly grainy,  which is why it got three stars.

I have probably made this recipe 5-6 times, as cupcakes, layer cake, and shaped cake, and it has turned out beautifully every time. It has become my go-to recipe for white cake, I love the slight citrus flavor and it is perfectly light and moist. I always follow the recipe exactly (aside from varying the baking time based on which pan I use), and wouldnâ€™t change a thing. Thanks for sharing!

I agree with another reviewer.  Don't pass this up because of the name.  I made cupcakes for Easter out of this recipe.  They are delicious!  I did have to double the frosting recipe for the recipe since I piped it on.

This is my go-to cake for birthdays, first day of school, or any other special family event.  I'm not sure why some have called it a pound cake, as it always turns out light and fluffy for me--nothing like the texture of a pound cake.  I have switched up the extracts, always with delicious results (as written, it is subtly citrusy--a light, fresh flavor).  My family's favorite cake recipe!
