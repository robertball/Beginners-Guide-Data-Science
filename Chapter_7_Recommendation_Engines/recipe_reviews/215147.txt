:( This WAS horribly dry. I wasted all my plums on it! I don't know how the recipe could possibly work. Even the baking dish size it called for didn't work.

Delicious. If it turns out too dry, I would suggest omitting the bottom crust. I added a little extra sugar because I have Friar plums which are very sour. Loved it!

We loved this!! I only wish I had more plums so I could have doubled it! I subbed tapioca pearls for the flour as our plums are so juicy, and I had drained a lot off.  Loved a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - perfect!!

I've made this twice and guided by some of the suggestions, I added more fruit than the recipe calls for.  I really like the oatmeal topping and it didn't come out dry.  My first batch came out a little tart so I peeled the skin off the next time and it was much better.

This recipe needs to be re-vamped. The amount of butter/margarine and suger used is too little, as the the base of oats aren't gooey enough to stick together as a crumble, which is what the recipe looks like in the picture.  To rescue it, I added more butter and sugar and returned to the oven at low heat to (wet) the topping oats.

There isn't anything right about this recipe. I used an 8x8 pan instead of the large one - no way there would be enough of anything to fill the larger pan. It calls for a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg? I cut that way back since I can't even imagine how awful that would have been. I used about 15 plums and increased the amount of topping. This still turned out to be only about 3/4 of an inch thick. I'm wondering what the people did that liked it? Did I miss something? I won't make this again.
