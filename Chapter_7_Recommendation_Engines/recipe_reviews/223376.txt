I have made this recipe a couple of times now and my whole family loves it! My husband says it is the most flavorful roast beef he has ever had. My two young daughters gobble it up. I serve it over rice with a side of broccoli cuts and fresh Italian baguette. Super easy and delicious!

It had a nice flavor. I used Victoria Gourmet's Toasted Onion Herb Seasoning to replace the Lipton. Would probably cut the amount of "gravy" in half for my family of 3. Extra gravy would be great over mashed potatoes.

What an easy slow cooker recipe! (and a great way to use up stew meat!) Moist, tender meat with plenty of gravy. I followed the recipe with the exception of the ginger ale and fresh mushrooms as I didn't have any. I sub'd sparkling soda.... figured it'd be similar! And I bet the yummy mushrooms would make it even better! I served it over buttery mashed potatoes. A keeper for our busy family of 6!!

My whole family loved this dish.  I used lemon lime soda instead of the ginger ale.  I served over mashed potatoes. I cooked on the low setting for 6 1/2 hours. Outstanding!

This was very good. Even the super picky 5 year old ate it. I had to tweak it a bit because of what I had on hand, however. I used 4 sirloin steaks and had to replace the ginger ale with cream soda because that was what I had on hand. It came out a bit sweet, but no one noticed except me--I think it was only because I knew I had substituted the cream soda. It was very tender and still had a nice hearty flavor with a gravy consistency, and made a lot. We used the extra gravy over rice. With the substitutions I would rate it 4 stars, but I would definitely make this again with the right ingredients and I think it would be 5 stars.

I followed the recipe to a tee. It was bland, it needs seasonings. It was way too salty, and I used the low sodium soup. At least the meat was tender. The onion soup mix is not necessary. My husband liked it...he would give it a 4 rating.

I made this tonight for dinner and boy was it a hit!! I did use water instead of ginger ale. I did not add garlic as I used the beefy onion dry soup mix which has plenty of flavor. I put it all in a baking dish and covered with foil and baked at 325 degrees. It was so easy and so tender and delicious, I'm sure that it would work as well in the crockpot. Thank you Kathleen for a very delicious recipe.

Made the recipe exactly as printed. Taste was unpleasant and meat was not the tenderness I expected from a slow cooker. My husband thought it was bland.  Would not make again.    MS

I followed the recipe pretty much exact but I added salt to taste along with herbs like basil, oregano, dill and served over mashed potatoes. It was so good and my family loved it!!!

This was easy to make, and made LOTS for leftovers.  I added some more garlic to it,however it seemed to lack something?  Not quite sure but it felt a little plain.  Will make again though as I think its something everyone would eat, good for having guests over.

This was really good and very easy. The sauce wasn't super creamy/thick, but I'm glad it wasn't. It was lighter but still flavorful. I marinated the stew meat in some minced garlic, Worcestershire and pepper the night before. Definitely a keeper.

This turned out pretty “ick”...way too much liquid, barely any flavor, although I added a lot more garlic...not a hit with the family....

We found this recipe to be extremely oniony between the onion soup and the chopped onion.  Also pretty soupy, so I added a cornstarch and water mixture near the end of cooking.  Overall, just "eh."

I followed recipe exactly- super bland.  There was a lot of liquid/gravy, put it over egg noodles--No flavor.  My husband and I had to add salt and pepper after every bite.   He commented that he has never had to add so much salt to a dish.  The beef was very tender though.

Made as written. The dish tastes bland at first, but once it begins to cool/rest, it tastes amazing. If you eat it immediately you may not like it.

Even my BF liked it a lot and he's not a beef lover.  I used one can of soup, one packet of onion soup mix , Half a bulb of garlic, 2 small cans of button mushrooms and 3/4 can of 7UP.  Very moist, flavorful and went great with elbow mac.

Family loved it!  Being busy we tend to get into a rut with meal planning, so decided to try this.  Made it as written, except left out the mushrooms, since all my guys don't like them.  Everyone loved it.  Cooked rice and added peas at the end, so we had a veggie.  Definitely will become part of the rotation!  Thanks so much!

We liked this. I didn't have the gingerale so I used sparkling water. So not the same but this came out really good. The mushrooms were so good.
