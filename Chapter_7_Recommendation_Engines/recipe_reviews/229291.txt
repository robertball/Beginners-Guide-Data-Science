This is great! Keep it sealed in a large glass jar in my pantry. For those who don't know what to do with it, you use it as a substitute for Bisquick. That's what it's for. If you don't know what Bisquick is or how to use it, visit the Betty Crocker website and look up Bisquick recipes. Not sure, but if you didn't know what to do with the recipe, why would you even look it up? :-)

I will never buy Bisquick ever again. I realized making a casserole I didn't have any on hand...came right to this recipe and threw it together with everything I had on hand. The casserole turned out excellent and then threw out some bisquits with it and they rose wonderfully! What a fast recipe to make up in a pinch!...Cost wise, excellent and makes way more then you can purchase it in the store. TY! Enjoyed the results that followed!

Great substitute!  I altered the recipe a little as I did not have dry milk powder on hand.  This is what I did:
6 cups all-purpose flour,
3 tablespoons baking powder,
1 tablespoon salt,
3/4 cup shortening

You will never have to buy Bisquick again, with all of those preservatives.  I did not add the dry milk.  When I was ready to make biscuits, I used 2 cups of the mix, and 3/4 cup of buttermilk, made with Saco. This made 6 nice sized biscuits. Some of you were wanting to know. This worked well for me. They were delicious biscuits.  Thank you fayyr for sharing your recipe.

Homemade baking mixes, like this one, are a great shortcut for busy cooks.  All the flavor and convenience of Bisquick with none of the preservatives.  For the two users who gave the recipe a lower rating because you don't know what to do with it:  use it as a substitute for any recipe that calls for Bisquick.

I scaled back the recipe to make 3 cups of this mixture to make 'Beer Muffins' from AR.  It worked fantastic.  Really no need to buy a pre-mix anymore. To make 3 cups:  2 1/2 c. + 2 TB flour; 1/4 c. + 2 t. dry milk; 1 TB + 1 1/4 t. baking powder; 1 TB + 1/2 t. sugar; 1 t. salt; 1/4 c. + 2 t. shortening

Great recipe for baking mix.  I put everything in a large bowl except for the shortening. I mixed it all up and filled two quart jars with the mixture WITHOUT the shortening.  I put 1/3 cup of shortening in the remaining mix, cut it in as directions state, then filled my last quart jar.  This way, I can use the jar with the shortening for biscuits and use the others jars without shortening for everything else, as most other things such as pancakes do not require shortening in the mix. It turned out great!

If you use butter, not only will the texture change, but if you do not keep it refrigerated, it will quickly become rancid. DO NOT USE OIL---it can't be "cut in" so it won't work at all well. This leaves two choices: all vegetable margarine, if you have it in Australia or lard, which is the ingredient that "all vegetable Crisco" (a well-known brand of shortening) originally replaced. Lard isn't particularly good for anyone, but neither is hydrogenated vegetable shortening. Lard should give a superior texture to baked goods, but since it is an animal fat, it might need to be refrigerated like butter--I really don't know because I don't use lard. I just remember my mother telling me it was "old fashioned" Crisco and Mom used lard only to make my grandmother's recipes for authenticity and nostaligia, probably. Hope this helps.

For recipes and instructions for using the mix:
I like to go to BettyCrocker,com and do a search for 'Bisquick recipes'...there are a TON of great ideas for how to use the mix...

We made pancakes with this mix today and they were great! I usually follow the Bisquick box to make them but since we didn't have the box, we did a little trial and error to come up with our "recipe."To make pancakes, we used 2 c mix, 2 eggs, 1 1/3 c milk, 1/4 c oil. Also, the recipe fit perfectly into 3 quart jars. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this tasted just liked the boxed stuff at the store. I used the change servings button and changed it to 4 servings. It made 1 3/4 of a cup of mix, close to what I needed for a recipe. My only change was using butter instead of shortening as it was what I had. ty

I made a few changes that some may like.  I used self rising flour.  There are 6 and 2/3 cups flour in a two pound bag.  I used a combination of dry goat milk and cows milk.  Goat milk is healthier and richer but expensive. I used 3/4 cup dry milk, 3tblsp sugar, a dash of salt and did not add oil. When I make a recipe it is easy enough to add coconut oil or butter  and I prefer either of them to regular cooking oil. I measure that by eye so can't give you an amount. I then add enough water to get the consistency  I want.  As I am a get it done quick cook I usually make a drop batter rather than one that needs to be rolled and cut.  The biscuits are heavenly and the dumplings just add so much to a hearty soup

I made minor modifications, however I did not remove stars because I changed this great recipe. It was a great mix that I modified for dietary requirements. It was a super place to start, and I think it would taste as good, or probably even better, as is. Thanks so much for this recipe. Hubby loves it. He was in despair when he had to give up his boxed mix because of the sodium. I make this and put it in a baggy, and he can make pancakes, waffles, drop biscuits, basically anything he wants.

Made this for a recipe that required baking mix which I didn't have, scaled to 5 servings for the 2 cups I needed. Didn't have milk powder so I used milk in the recipe instead of water. Omitted salt since I am on a low sodium diet.

This baking mix tastes Better than Bisquick IMO and of course doesn't have the additives. I have used it for basic biscuits, beer and cheese biscuits, pancakes (I don't like Bisquick pancakes but this mix was delicious) and biscuit topping for chicken pot pie. It's perfect every time.

Perfect for those recipes that call for baking mix!  I only needed a small amount so I adjusted the serving size to 2 so I could make the Johnsonville Sausage Balls (made half that recipe).

Perfect as a substitute when I needed baking mix.  I love subs like this, as I'm often without them but I bake and cook constantly.  And, I hate waiting until I can go to the store to find ingredients.  This worked wonderfully, and now I have extra for other recipes that call for baking mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used dry buttermilk instead. The reason some people ask for directions is because bisquik uses milk & this doesn't. They could have add some type basic directions.  Not everyone is a genius.

Made this a lot.  For the lady asking whether to use oil or butter, I wouldn't use oil, but real butter (I suppose one could use margarine, too), or lard works great.  Just freeze whichever you use and grate it,  using a box grater,  into the mix ,then add milk or water and mix gently  with hands just until moistened.  Roll out to about 1/2 inch thick and cut out.  Lightly grease baking sheet. Bake about 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees, depending upon oven and altitude, until golden brown.  Makes fluffy biscuits!  Any biscuit recipe would work with these instructions.

This recipe made great dumplings for chickens and dumplings. I can't wait to try it in biscuits.
