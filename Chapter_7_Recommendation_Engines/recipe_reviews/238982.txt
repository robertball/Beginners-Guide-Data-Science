I recently found I have to be gluten free, & largely avoid sugar, soy, & dairy, so am always looking for recipes I can make that meet my new restrictions AND still taste delicious. I say this is a winner! Didn't change anything. Simple, easy, moist, yummy! And dare I say, almost healthy for you! (Shh! Don't tell my husband!) Thank you for a delicious, healthy dessert recipe I will be adding to my new "regulars".

They turned out nice and moist and stayed so even after they cooled down. I added a splash of vanilla extract and puréed in a NutriBullet. My husband ate them without even blinking and said he could taste the coffee I added (about 1 level tbsp). Hahaha. I'll break it to him soon that he had a portion of beans. Or, maybe not.  Will definitely make these again!

I've made this using canola oil in place of coconut oil. They came out really nice, but more cake-like than I prefer in a brownie. But really, it's the taste that matters. Hide the empty cans and no one will know. I sprung them on my nephew, who will not eat any beans at all (it's a texture thing) and he loved them. I did 'fess up, and he didn't believe me until I showed him the cans. They're not quite as good as Outback's Chocolate Thunder From Down Under (google the recipe) but they're darn good. And the beans bring added protein and fiber, a good thing.

Was curious so tried it... would say if you're gluten free and need an option I'm sure this is amazing, but... if you can have the real thing you can tell the difference. I can taste the beans, not bad, but different. Overall my kids and I had one serving and decided to pass on the rest (which would NEVER happen with a pan of traditional brownies) If you're curious I'd say give it a try... it's easy enough ad you might just like it.

These are seriously awesome!  I left out the chocolate bar and added a tablespoon of espresso instant coffee.  I cut them into small portions and wrap  in Saran Wrap and freeze.  Perfect healthy little snack.

We're not gluten free, but this sounded interesting.  After reading some of the negative reviews, I decided that if we're going to try these, they'll need something to give more texture and we def did not want to taste beans.  I used half the suggested oil/half applesauce, added 1/4 cup almond flour, an extra heaping TLB cocoa powder  (I had no chocolate chips or candy bar), and 2 tsp wet instant coffee to the bean mixture.   I'm allergic to tree nuts (dang it!), but can eat hazelnuts.  I added a 1/2 cup chopped for the extra crunch.  They were on the cakey side, which we like.   These were AMAZING!!

These brownies are amazing.  They are moist and delicious and you would never think they had black beans in them!  They are certainly better than box brownies and definitely leave your family and friends wanting more.  They also look delicious.  They are a winner in my recipe box.

I loved them! They did not taste exactly like brownies, but I substituted with Paleo friendly chocolate chips. It was more chocolate tasting and very moist. I really enjoyed them, the richness allowed each one to be more satisfying. Next time I’m going to try adding walnuts for a little extra crunch. The best part was how easy it was to make. I would definitely make these for other people.

Easy to make and the people I served it to didn't know it was beans!  I think it's because of how much chocolate, and the tastes of honey and coconut oil rather than sugar and vegetable oils.

I didn’t put a candy bar on top and I didn’t put any choc chips inside I just sprinkled them across the top.   I think the honey could be cut back a little as I felt they were plenty sweet.  Tasted yummy though.

Good alternative to regular brownies although definitely not equivalent. They were very moist and had an excellent consistency, but next time I will be making them with additional sugar.

Great, great recipe!! It was delicious. Good texture and density. Not too cake-like and not real dense. I added a bit of coffee, cinnamon and vanilla to mine for a flavor preference.

I made this recipe. It was wonderful. I followed all ingredients exactly, and added 1 TBS of coffee. The Cub Scouts were eating healthy brownies and had no clue. Some parents even asked if they were fudge. I will definitely make these again.

I was skeptical but decided to make these brownies and hope for the best. I’m so glad I did! They are delicious and are a great healthy alternative to traditional sugar-filled brownies. My fiancé loved them and has no idea they were made with black beans or he wouldn’t have tried them. I have diabetes, so the fiber and protein in these are great for me. We’ll keep this a little secret and sneak healthy brownies to my fiancé.

Best of all the black bean brownie recipes!  The baking powder  ensures the cooked brownies don't have a heavy, gluey texture.  I substituted  a fourth cup brown sugar for the honey b/c out of honey at the time.   Used dark chocolate/sea salt bar for the top.  Note:  MUST be well cooled before cutting.

Was skeptical at first, and now sold. This brownie version is simply amazing. No one in my household has dietary restrictions, however the family tolerates my chef creations. This bean-based treat is all the RAVE.  Was out of honey and substituted with agave. Because I like nuts, walnuts or pecans will be in my next batch.

very good recipe. I made it twice. I have never put in the candy bar as I wanted a healthy treat.  Once I ran out of cacao and put in chocolate protein powder.  I have also used genuine maple syrup instead of honey.    I made it into muffins both times. I also used dairy free/nut free chocolate chips.   Be careful of the sizes of your tin of beans. They are often NOT 15 ozs.

They were ok while warm, but got bitter when they cooled off.  Also, they didn't stay together, they just broke apart.  I will have to work on that to make the kiddos happy.

A very delicious brownie,and healthy too.
I found it a little moist though.
