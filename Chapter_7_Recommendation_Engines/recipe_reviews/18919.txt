I used the Absolut Citron as the previous reviewer suggested and the Appletini came out just like at the local martini bar.  Very sweet and yummy.  Good porportion of alcohol and juice.

I made this with DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker, Smirnoff Green Apple vodka, and apple juice and it was the hit of the party!  (We'd tried it with Absolut Citron, but didn't like that as well.)

I've been making martinis this way for as long as I can remember (though I didn't get the recipe here). This makes the best martini EVER. My friends love them cause they are really smooth and delish, but are afraid of them because they are deceptively intoxicating (I don't even know why).

Definitely needed the Absolut Citron and Dekuyper Sour Apple Pucker. It makes the perfect Appletini!

Yummy.  I used the sour apple pucker schnapps as suggested by one reviewer and the citron vodka.  It tasted a little like a liquid green apple jolly rancher!

Another alternative is to mix the sour apple (sourpuss), regular vodka and limeade all equal parts shake-up and rim your glass with cinnamon & sugar (mixed together) and it adds a bit of apple pie flavour.

Based on other reviews I added a dash of lemon juice (not having citron vodka on hand) and it turned out yummy. It is a bit sweet, so I added some extra apple juice and a dash of water to balance the pucker. Will make again. **Update, I added a dash of beer to counter the sweetness of the pucker. Yummy! Helps a lot if you're not big on sweet!

I made a big bowl of this for a party.  It was both strong and sweet, even after adding a little extra juice.  A great combination :)  Everyone asked for the recipe.

These were good but I had to add a little more juice; I am definitely going to try this again with Absolute Citron, i used (very) cheap vodka and although still good, I think it altered the results quite a bit.

Delicious.  I doubled the apple juice and it still had enough "kick".  This is a new favorite.

Even hubby liked these & he's not a big fan of sweet cocktails. He did say that they packed quite a punch & told him that's how the big girls play. LOL Thanks Stacia!

This is my new favorite drink.  I added Chambord to the bottom of the glass and it made it look fancy.  I highly recommend this drink.

I made this just like the recipe said and enjoyed it.  I used cherry and Apple's as a garnish. It did have a strange taste but to fixs that I just added more Apple pucker.

These are awesome! I made mine with sour apple schnapps (all I had) and a tad more apple juice. I don't know if that qualifies it as a martini anymore, but it still turned out great. Thanx!

Sweet drink just like I like them.  I have never made a martini before because I am more of a wine drinker. I made these on new years eve and they were liked by both the ladies and the men.  I used absolut vodka and DeKuyper sour Apple schapps.
