I followed the recipe exactly but we had to put it down the drain. It tasted ok but something was missing. It didn't look appealing at all so i would recommend swirling the chocolate in but not blending so that the rice doesn't turn brown.

I followed the rice part exactly, but for the pear part I screwed up and poached using another recipe I had been looking at that had a little wine instead of cinnamon. The dish is very sweet, more of a dessert than a meal. I think the rice was lacking something, not sure what since I am not good at figuring that out, but what was lacking may very well have been the heavy cinnamon that would have come from the pears had I poached them right. All in all, quite good. When I make it again with the pears poached the right way, I'll re-rate.
