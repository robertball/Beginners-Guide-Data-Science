This is a caribbean recipe, would be even better if could use 'sofrito' but not all the ingredients can be found everywere in the US.  Also the original recipes use 'caldo de pescado' (fish broth) instead of water, adds lots of flavor!!

We truly enjoyed this recipe.  I took the suggestion of using some diced tomatoes and cilantro.  We found it to be very flavorful.  I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes in place of part of the water.  Added a little fresh Cilantro and skipped the peas.  I used a brown rice and it needed about twice as much time as suggested in the recipe but the flavor was great (the kids even ate it!). A+.

This was a good recipe.. I made a few changes and it came out really good. I substituted half of the water with chicken broth. Added sofrito, chicken and shrimp and potatoes. My picky son loved it!

Very tasty, very quick.  I made a few adjustments based mostly on what was at hand.  I used the sauce from a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce that was hanging out in the fridge in place of the seasonings, I used a whole red pepper instead of 1/2 a red and 1/2 a green, and I used brown basmati because that's what I had.  Great the next day, too - maybe better.

This was really tasty - with the flavors and seasonings it was like a mix between paella and jambalaya, but still very different from either. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used a can of tomatoes since fresh tomatoes are awful this time of year, and I added some cilantro. Overall very tasty - thanks!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe very closely - but I did take the advise from the reviews to use a couple of cans of diced tomato to make up some of the 7c of water.  Also I used frozen broccoli (husband hates peas). I used brown basmati rice - love that! but it does take longer to cook. When it was nearly done I sampled it and it was a little bland so I added a couple of spoons of beef broth granules which added just what it needed. I will definitely be making this again, it was so good and a nice variety for cooking shrimp.

Absolutely delicious! don't let the number of ingredients scare you, it is very easy to make.  Mine did not come out as a soup but more as a rice dish but everyone loved it.  Next time would subsitute some tomatoes and/or chicken broth for some of the water.

I made this with a few tweaks, added crab and scallops with cilantro, brown rice. Very Good. Also used baby carrots no peas.

My husband and I thought this recipe was very bland. I don't think I'm going to try this again.

Family loved this. I had to cook it a little longer than stated so that the rice was done. I substituted seafood stock for most of the water. Also, it was very soupy so I may cut back on the liquid next time.

This recipe smelled great whilst cooking. We were all so excited to sit down to eat. Unfortunately, what we had was a very bland final product. It looks beautiful and is edible, but was watery and had little to no flavor.

First too much oil.  I would put 2 instead of 3.  I used homemade shrimp broth instead of chicken broth.  I also added fresh cilantro at the end.  I liked it very much but there was something missing to taste like the ones I’ve had in Puerto Rico and the Dominican ones I’ve had. I would make this again but maybe use my cilantro cubes.

Turned out great. If making it to be consumed by the masses  be careful with the Red Pepper. I like Red Pepper!
