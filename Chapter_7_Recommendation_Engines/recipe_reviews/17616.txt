I admit I pretty much chose this recipe in the fun and spirit of The Super Bowl but man-oh-man, was I in for a surprise.  I baked this as cupcakes - they're not just ok, they're excellent, and NOT "considering they have beer in them,"  but maybe BECAUSE they have beer in them!  Maybe the beer is the reason they're so light, fluffy, moist and deliciously spicy.  I used Guiness Draught, and even using a heavy, robust beer such as that, it was not apparent or overkill at all.  I baked them about 20 minutes, and topped them with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site.  It was the perfect combination.

This is WONDERFUL! I used pumpkin ale and baked it in a bunt pan at 325 for about 40 minutes turning it every 10 minutes. I also put a powdered suger glaze made with orange juice over it.  This was a hit at work!  I will keep this recipes close by.

this recipe lived up to all its rave reviews! It was so easy to make and I couldn't believe how fluffy and moist it was. I cooked it in nine inch rounds instead of a loaf pan to make a layer cake that was iced with cinnamon butter cream frosting, toasted coconut and chopped walnuts. The brown ale I used added a great flavor as well.

These were nice and fluffy but without frosting, be warned that for a cake these were not sweet at all. However, paired with the "allspice cream cheese frosting" they were quite delicious.  Maybe next time I'll add a little white sugar next time.  I also doubled the recipe and it made 30 cupcakes baked at 18 minutes.

I enjoyed this cake...I put it in a bundt pan and cooked it at 325 degrees for forty minutes, as another reviewer suggested.  If I were to use a bundt pan again, I would probably increase the recipe by 50% to make a fuller cake.  I dusted the cake with powdered sugar and served it warm.

I made these into cupcakes... found that they were very moist and tasted awesome. Even when the recipe was doubled and made in one batch Lots of complements on them. Paired it with a cream cheese icing.

My husband really loved this.  I added raisins because, to me, everything tastes better with raisins. It was very moist.  Make sure to use a beer that tastes good.  I learned that the hard way from a recipe for beer bread.

Moist and full of spice! This cake was good - not outstanding. My boyfriend asked if there were bananas in it... he thought it tasted more like a heavily-spiced banana bread, vs just a regular spice cake. He is enjoying it - topped with a velvety cream cheese frosting. Not a recipe I'll go back to often, unless SPICE is the name of the game!

Delicious!  I did not have brown sugar so I substituted white sugar.  I put 2 eggs instead of 1.  I did not have ground cloves or allspice so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  I did not have walnuts so I put 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  I brought this to work and it did not last long.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

AWESOME!!  This was super easy to make and really moist and delicious.  I am a college student & all I had in the fridge was Bud Light, but it didn't matter, it still tasted super good!  My boyfriend and his office mates loved it!
(I doubled the recipe and added an egg to make the mix smoother)

This was very good, kind of like banana bread without the bananas.  My stove is broken, so I baked this in my barbecue and it came out great!  I used Wassail (Full Sail brewery) which added some extra spice.

Delicious! I followed recipe exactly (minus nuts) and it came out fantastic. I doubled the recipe and it made about 5.5 cups of batter, so I made a regular 9X13 cake with 7 cupcakes. I tried a cupcake fresh from the oven and the taste was awesome! I intend to frost with cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake for my Daddy's birthday. The aroma of the cake was wonderful! I made it as a bunt and used a basic vanilla glaze on top- the only change I made was that I didn't have Allspice and instead used nutmeg-- I'll try it next time with Allspice. I also absentmindedly flipped my cake before it cooled and the top remained in the bunt, oops!-- besides that it was a very moist spicy cake. I will try adding nuts or golden raisins, etc when I make this in the future.

Followed the recipe exactly. Used Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale which is a Belgian spiced ale and made cupcakes...they were great. Spicy with some "zinginess." =) They ONLY change I might make next time is slightly less clove. Like 3/4 tsp instead of 1 tsp. It was every-so-slightly overbearing. But really, a minor complaint!

With the positive reviews, couldn't resist trying. I was lacking cloves, so I used nutmeg,it turned out great. I also frosted it with  vanilla buttercream frosting, it would also be good with a dusting of confectioners sugar.

Made it as is (w/o the nuts for me), and I have to say it is my favorite cake ever! OMG! I did a vanilla drizzle on top and that was it! My daughter and I devowered it in 2 days! **I have to add, I am NOT a cake eater** but after the first one was gone, I am making a second! Sorry honey, you have to sacrifice your Bud Light! lol

The flavor of this cake is outstanding!  I cut the cloves back by 1/4 teaspoon but in the end, I think I could have used the whole teaspoon.  I had to double this recipe to make enough to make two 9" rounds.

This cake was fabulous! I used Sam Adams' seasonal Pumpkin Ale (which added a great flavor) and topped with canned cream cheese frosting.  My husband and co-workers loved it.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is fantastic. Doubled it made 32 cupcakes. The instructions list walnuts, which the recipe does not -- I think they'd be a good addition but I didn't use them this time (mostly because I didn't know the recipe called for them). This tastes a little bit like carrot cake, with a fantastic light texture. In fact this may become my new carrot cake base because I like the texture so much better! Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious! I made it with Sam Adams Winter Lager and substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the allspice, since I didn't have any pure allspice. (Pumpkin Pie Spice contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice). The flavors turned out PERFECTLY. Just make sure not to de-pan it too early. I removed it from the pan after 10 minutes, and half of it fell apart. :-/ Still tastes great, though!

Made this for a company potluck, no leftovers! If you make it in a Bundt pan, I suggest doubling the recipe. I made a simple drizzle frosting with confectioner's sugar and water, it didn't need anything else. I also used a breakfast oatmeal stout for the beer.

Delicious and easy to make--very moist cake! It's a new favorite for us as people that don't usually like cake. I only had whole spices so had to improvise by crushing them myself which made them a little chunky in the batter, but we actually liked the little bits of spice.

This recipe was wonderful! Made with Rogue's Santa's Private Reserve and used William Sonoma's Gingerbread Man Cakelet pan - made approx. 15 Gingerbread Men Cakelets. Cooked for 15 min - perfect! So very light and ultra moist and tasty! Will try in other forms next (loaf, cupcakes) since I only have one cakelet pan! Great recipe!

This cake gave the house a great aroma and the taste was good, however it turned out too crumbly.  I topped it with cream cheese icing and that helped with the moistness.

I just made this cake and my apartment is full of the lovely aroma of spice!! i make all cakes in my food processor, with this recipe I dumped all ingredients (except for nuts) in at once and whizzed it together. I folded in nuts by hand. Turned out A++ moist and light. Thanks for a great recipe.

We subbed honey for half of the brown sugar. Talk about moist and flavorful! Dee-lish.  And a nice way to use up a little leftover beer from another recipe.

I tried this recipe out of the blue and loved it!! For the beer, I chose what we had in the fridge which was a Sam Adams Winter Lager and the cake turned out absolutely delicious!! Everyone in the fam loved it. Especially the boys in the house. For the frosting I used a simple cream chesse recipe, I mixed together 1 package of cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/2 stick of butter, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Perfect amount of frosting for cake and VERY YUMMY.

Made these into cupcakes and the recipe made 15 amazing moist cupcakes. I used a banana bread beer. Frosted with the Allspice cream cheese icing following the changes other reviewers suggested by using an 8oz cream cheese and 2 cups icing sugar.

I made this recipe just as the original cook recommended. I used the loaf pan.  I whipped the batter until it was frothy.  It was moist and delicious.

This recipe made 17 yummy, spicy, moist cupcakes! (18 min at 375) The only change I made was the brown sugar. I was out, so I added 1 cup sugar and 1 Tbl molasses. They turned out great! I, too, topped these with a simple cream cheese frosting. My husband loved his "Beer Cupcakes" for his birthday!

I don't like spice cake, and I was asked to make one for my aunt's birthday.  This cake was light airy, it was sooooooo good.  I would make it again for myself even though I don't like spice cake.  It make a lover out of me.

These are absolutely fantastic! Slightly disappointed that the beer flavour doesn't come out, but delicious nonetheless. I made 60 mini cupcakes and they were devoured in less than 2 hours between 8 people.  T.h.a.t.G.o.o.d.!

Very good! I used a good brown ale and instead of the cinnamon, allspice and cloves, I used 2 teaspoons of Apple Pie Spice (its a mixture of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg). Turned out great!

I thoroughly enjoyed this cake. I made it into cupcakes vs a 9x5 loaf, and it worked out well. I cut the cook time to 20 minutes.

My boys, 3 yrs and 5 yrs respectively, also enjoyed the flavour...and they can be very picky eaters when it comes to spices. I also used the Allspice Cream Cheese icing (recipe on this site) to top them.

The only reason I'm giving a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is that the consistency makes this cake more like a muffin than a cake. While I enjoy muffins, I was anticipating more of a spice cake than a cakey muffin. That said, the icing made it much more cake like. 

**Note: These did not taste nearly as moist the next day. Again, this adds to the muffin vs cake consistency.

I made this exactly as per the recipe, and I used a nice India Pale Ale for the beer. The batter tasted bitter before baking but it came out absolutely delicious. I topped with Caramel Icing I from this site, a perfect combination.  Super moist,  fast and easy little cake which does NOT taste like beer!  Yummy!

Who knew beer could be so-o-o-o-o good?!?!?! Not only did I love it but so did everyone else. Only thing I did differently was add a sprinkle of nutmeg. I made cupcakes & 18 minutes was perfect. They were light, moist and flavorful. Will definitely keep this as a favorite for any time of year!

I made this with nutmeg instead of allspice as that is what i had on hand.  I used about 4 cloves ground as I did not want to overpower the flavor.  I did not use walnuts.  I think just a tad dry maybe add some applesauce to wet ingredients next time.  I made a low fat cream cheese frosting by adding only powdered sugar and eliminating butter.  I made these into cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes.

This was very good, in spite of the way I prepared it! I used my bread machine's "quick bread" cycle, just because I was too lazy to haul out the mixer, (the bread machine was out on the counter) and the batter did not mix properly. I wound up beating it by hand. In spite of this, the cake turned out really well. The children loved it served with vanilla ice cream. I used brown ale, which went really well with the spice blend. This one is now in my recipe box.
