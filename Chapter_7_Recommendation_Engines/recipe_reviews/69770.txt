I live in Eastern Carolina and many elements that are traditional are missing and affect the flavor.  Bacon is a must and true fish stew is actually a stoup that is layered and simmered very slowly for a few hours not a few minutes.  Trust me.  I've lived near the coast all my life

Oh, I like this! It is just what I was hoping for. I made it exactly per recipe *except* I did not have non-condensed tomato soup so subbed regular condensed tomato soup. I will definitely keep this around for days such as today (cold and rainy) and perfect for when I don't have a lot of time, energy or fresh groceries. I might serve this with jalapeno cornbread or hushpuppies. It is very good as given, but would also be good to throw in whatever is on hand. Thanks! Just what I was looking for.

Okay, I had to come back and change this to 5 stars. It is even so much better the second night! The flavors have blended and it just bloomed -- became a serious contender! I also wanted to mention that at first I put only 1/2 teaspoon red pepper but I do like *medium* hot and there just wasn't any heat the first night, even though I added several grinds of black pepper too. The second night, I added another 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper and it was perfect for *medium* hot - so next time I will start with 1 teaspoon. Also, tonight I wanted a little green veggie so chunked in a can of okra in tomatoes. It was sooooooo good! This went from being something I like and can use to a favorite, one I'll make sure I keep some canned mackeral on hand for. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe. Oh, I also added another egg tonight. Wonderful. Next time if I have only the condensed tomato soup I'll probably sub a can of seasoned diced tomato. Enjoy! I'm now adding fresh sliced carrot or...

I,too, think a few suggestions are in order.  Pond-raised catfish for a start.  Then, layer seasoned fish, onions, sweet peppers, minced garlic, plain flour, crushed tomatoes, and water.  Cook over medium heat for 5-6 min.  Turn the fire to simmer and shake the pot--do not stir.  Simmer to 20 min. Garnish with chopped green onion tops. Serve over cooked rice.

Very cheap meal. I like the egg with it and the canned mackerel is not bad at all. It could use a little more substance though.

I add a large can of diced tomatos, an egg per serving, more onion, more potatoes, more bacon and I also debone the canned mackerel. (Only add as many eggs that are going to be eaten in one meal. They get tough if reheated. If reheated you can add more eggs then.) I also cook longer than stated. I am from a coastal county in NC and my family has made this fish stew for years. I can remember it being cooked in a large cast iron pot outside using fresh deboned fish.

I made this the other night for the shelter I cook at. It went over good. Since my items on hand were limited and had no potatos I used kidney beans. Mackerel is one of the things that have an aquired taste for it. The ones that had the taste for it totally loved it.
The others thought, "this is different. Not bad but definitely unique".
In my case...I loved it.

I added chopped celery and 1 can fire roasted tomatoes.  Also, halved the potatoes and parboiled them before slicing.  Decreased onion to about 1/2 a red onion.  Added Madras style curry powder and a dash of Northwoods seasoning for extra fire.  Wanted to finish with a dish reminiscent of fish curry and succeeded.  Delicious!

I love this fish stew. I added a small can of tomato sauce and a small bag of salad shrimp for flavor.  Perfect for our cold rainy days here in east Tennessee. My grandchildren even love it. Thank you so much.
