Husband isn't a potato fan so he didn't really care for this but I really liked it. I added more extra-sharp Cheddar, and I also made them into potato cakes and cooked them in a skillet. Not the healthiest thing in the world, but really tasty. Thanks!

Great way to use up some left over taters.  Not quite dressing.  By choosing your herbs to go with your meat this is a perfect side with anything.    I used rosemary and garlic to go with lamb,

This was just ok.  It seemed almost more like a breakfast casserole than a potato side.  I did like that I was able to prep it the night before, but it takes a long time to bake.  I found mini disposable loaf pans at the grocery store and used them to reduce bake time; it still needed 50 minutes to bake.  Thanks for the recipe, Jeff Lilly!

I made this as a side-dish to a beef tenderloin.  It's a great concept that you can definitely play around with.  I didn't use baked potatoes, I just boiled them just like I make mashed potatoes.  I also added chives, used seasoned salt for more flavor and used butter to grease the pan.  I was thinking about adding some chopped turkey bacon but regrettably I didn't.  Like I said, you can really play around with this recipe.

My kids loved this, I felt it to be a little bland but good. But I cannot argue when each one of them had seconds.
