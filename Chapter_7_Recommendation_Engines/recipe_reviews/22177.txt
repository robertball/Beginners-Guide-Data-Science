The consistency, texture, and flavor come through on this one.  It's great.  Although, I like the lime sauce a little less strong so I add less lime juice.

Mmm.  So delicious and, like she said, very easy to prepare.  Cakes were kind of small.  Next time, I'll make them bigger.  Yum.

Oh man these are good! I thought there were too many noodles so set some aside but them used them up as I went along so they were perfect...wasn't the prettiest looking (didn't even try to prevent noodles from sticking out) but it tastes great! Also added 1/2 a serrano pepper & some garlic. YUM!

I added a little fresh chopped garlic and extra cilantro to the cakes, otherwise I thought they were a little bland.  I also substituted low-fat sour cream for the mayonaise and that worked very well!

Delicious!  Did not seem to want to hold together at first, but once in the frying pan held together nicely.  Cilantro-Lime Mayo was superb!

I wanted to make this so badly, but didn't have exactly the right ingredients.  Used canned crab (gasp) and ditalini noodles, lite sour cream instead of mayo.  It was fast and delicious!!! I could eat this everyday. Thanks for a super adaptable recipe.  Keep em comin!

I just tried the mayonnaise (as suggested by another recipe) and it was OK, but nothing special.

This wasn't for us - sorry. The taste just wasn't there and we didn't like the texture. The mayo was too limey for us. I made this exactly the way it was stated in the recipe.

These were great.  My boyfriend requested that I make them every Friday from now on :-)  The only suggestions I would make would be to make extra mayo and you can break up the noodles ahead of time as long as you have a fine mesh strainer.  Cutting cooked noodles was kind of a pain.

we made the crab cake sauce also, everyone liked that sauce better. this needs to be kicked up somehow. but we will use it agian with the other sauce. it makes a great presentation and the lime is a great contrast to the other sauce

these just didn't impress. they were too much trouble for something that tasted just "okay" and they looked unappetizing. the noodles just soaked up the oil and it was impossible to make patties without the noddle sticking out. like i said, they taste fine, but i won't make this again. and the cilantro-lime mayo?  sorry!

I only used the recipe for the Cilanto-Lime Mayonnaise Sauce.  I love the cilantro and lime combination and it was great on the crab cakes that I made.

Will definitely make again.  Sauce is light and refreshing.  Will keep in mind for using up leftover pasta.
