I absolutely loved the mocha flavor in this icebox cake. The end results depend on how good your cookies are.  I used Chips Ahoy.

This was a snap to make and it was delicious.  I enjoyed the tender texture of the cookies and chocolate chips alongside the smooth, rich cream filling.  The espresso powder lends a very nice hint of coffee.

This was a great tasting dessert that my husband and I loved.  Easy to make. I used what was on hand. Instead of mascarpone, I used cream cheese.  I probably used to big of a dish because I did not have enough cream mixture for the top. So I whipped another cup of heavy cream with a dash of vanilla, bit of sugar and a scant amount of expresso. It complimented the other two layers. I did use Chips Ahoy as someone suggested. They were perfect. This tasted perfect the next day if you can wait that long to try some. LOL

I made this, but I followed Ina Garten's version of this recipe. The main differences is her recipe include cocoa powder and coffee liquer. I also made this as a trifle instead of a cake, as I thought it might be rich and wanted people to be able to scoop smaller servings. That was a smart move...it is rich but unbelievably great. Reminds me of a tiramisu, but much easier to make. And this was one of the quickest desserts to put together...all you do is whip and layer.

This was delicious; however, my filling was thinner that what appears in the recipe's photo.

This is delicious! I made my own espresso powder and made my own cake pan size 8 inch chocolate chip cookies- two layers.

I have a 9‚Äù springform pan, 13oz cookies left 4 that were crumpled for the third layer. One guest requested recipe, a 12 year old requested it for her birthday, a sister who does not like chocolate said she could enjoy that kind, none was left. Definitely a win!
