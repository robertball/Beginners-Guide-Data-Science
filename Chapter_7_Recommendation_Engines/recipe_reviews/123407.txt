I wanted just a basic blueberry sauce with no competing flavors and this couldn't have been easier or better.  Because I was making this specifically to swirl through homemade vanilla ice cream, I deliberately increased the cornstarch just a smidge.  Also added a teeny pinch of salt simply to heighten flavor.  I used frozen blueberries.  This was exactly what I wanted, a lovely blue, not too sweet blueberry sauce that took just a few minutes to make.

Made this as a topping for cheesecake - fantastic and easy! The only change I made was to use two tablespoons of cornstarch to avoid a syrup consistency - I wanted the topping to sit on the cheesecake without dripping down the sides. I paired this with a lemon cheesecake and the flavor combo was awesome!

I subtracted a tablespoon of water and added a tablespoon of lemon juice. I made no other changes or substitutions. This was perfect--the kids ate this sauce over homemade buttermilk pancakes and mmmmmm'ed all the way through breakfast. GREAT blueberry sauce.

Fantastic! I made this for a birthday pancake breakfast - for 7 teenage boys. They loved it. I especially appreciate that the ingredients are simple; the sauce had straight-forward blueberry flavor. I also used this recipe to make a strawberry sauce using frozen, sliced strawberries w/sugar - I thawed the container first, substituted apple juice for the water and mixed the corn starch into the juice before combining in the pot. It turned out great as well.

This recipe made more than I expected so after using on waffles and pancakes for breakfast, we served the leftovers warm on vanilla ice cream -- YUM.  Not too sweet... perfect.

This was great! I put it on top of so-so pancakes and it made them seem delicous.  I almost used another recipe with more ingredients and then saw this one, I'm glad I did because I saved time, and money and got the same great taste!  Very Easy. Thanks!

This was so easy and so wonderful!  No changes.  We used it over waffles and my friend's kids kept asking for more waffles (so they could have the blueberries) until she had to cut them off. :)  This would be great on pancakes, crepes, or ice cream, as well.

I used this recipe as a base for some fruit toppings for a cheesecake. I added a bit more cornstarch and used frozen strawberries for one... and apples with spices for the other (to make kind of an apple pie flavored topping). They were both great. Thanks for providing this method!

This recipe was so easy to make! This is the first sauce I've ever made, and it came out wonderful! I served mine over pancakes and topped it with whipped cream. Even using a boxed mix for the sake of time, they tasted like home-made with the blueberry sauce. I will definitely make this again in the future!

My husband and I LOVE this sauce. I use frozen berries so that we can enjoy it all year round. The blueberry can be a bit overwhelming so I've also made this with just strawberries or mixed berries of raspberry, blackberry, strawberry and blueberry. Any type of fruits I've made it with have all turned out delicious!

The recipe was really good, I used splenda in place of sugar. The kids that did ask for it liked it...however...I tasted the pancake mix I used with it...I didn't like the pancake..but the kids did. I used frozen blueberries. And it was quick and nice. Would make again.

Very sweet, but very yummy and FAST to make.  This sauce would be a nice complement to not only breakfast foods and desserts, but some entrees/meats as well (grilled chicken, for example).

I have been making this for years. If you want to really bring the flavors out, try adding 2T. Creme De Cassis (black currant liquor) and 1/4 C. natural maple syrup.

Love! I've made this several times now using all different kinds of berries - blueberries, raspberries, strawberries...and it never fails to turn out beautiful and delicious! The -only- change I make is to only use half the sugar called for...it's enough to take the tartness out, without making the sauce overly sweet. :)

I halved the recipe and it was great for 2 smalls and 2 adults.  I mixed the sugar and cornstarch together and added the water and then added the blueberries and set it to low heat while I made the pancakes.  When it was go time I turned it up slightly to get it to boil and be ready.  I did stir every once in a while while cooking the pancakes and then consistently while it boiled.

Absolutely wonderful blueberry sauce! I was searching for an easy sauce, nothing complicated that I can use for pancakes, toppings for cheesecakes or ice cream and I found it! I had over 2 lbs of fresh blueberries I need to use up so this was perfect. This was a simple, basic and easy to make sauce and sooo delicious! I did add a teeny bit more cornstarch to the mixture in order to make it slightly more thicker...I love tha fact that it was the right sweetness. this only took a few minutes to make, then I cooled it down a bit. this is going into my recipe box. Thank you Ellen for sharing this recipe with us!

Delicious! It tastes like the filling to the best blueberry pie ever.  I used half fresh blueberries and half frozen and about 1 extra tsp of cornstarch to make sure it was thick enough.  I served it over cheesecake and it was such a heavenly dessert.

This was great tasting and I will make it again but it had too many blueberries and not enough sauce in my opinion. I put it on pancakes so I was wanting something a little more "saucy". I will add more water next time. Great recipe overall!!

The consistency of this sauce is perfection!  It's  my new favorite pancake and waffle topper.  With only 4 ingredients, what could be easier?   I decreased the sugar from 1/2 cup to a scant 1/2 cup as I'm always on the lookout to save a few calories here and there without compromising flavor.
7/6/2016  - update:  I don't decrease the amount of sugar anymore - I just spoon on a little less instead.  You can almost always find this in my fridge!  Everyone loves it.  :)

Wow, this is fabulous. It makes me want to start growing some blueberries in my yard. I made half the recipe to try it out. I decided to make it because I had some frozen blueberries I wanted to use up. I will also try it with fresh in the summer more likely. The ingredient list was simple, the directions were easy to follow, and the blueberry sauce is amazing. Thank you

Good consistancy, but something missing.  Scaled it to 8 servings, and it tasted like cornstarch.  Maybe needs a bit more sugar.

This was delicious!  It was a little thick for my needs.  I was using it in place of syrup on waffles, but even still the flavor was absolutely wonderful.  My husband assumed I had used it all on the first servings for the family of waffles, and was SO disappointed when he realized he had settled for regular syrup when blueberry sauce was still left.  Very strong, pure blueberry flavor.  Next time I'm going to add half again as much water just to make it a little more "saucy".

This was very good warm over pancakes. Will make again. Didn't change a thing except for letting it simmer maybe 10 minutes waiting for other things to be done. I think the 16 servings is a little off though, maybe 8-10.

I was looking for a basic sauce that wasn't too sweet to top angel food cake (for a low sodium/fat plan).  This worked great!  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, increased the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons and used 3 cups (freshly) frozen blueberries. will experiment with different fruits and use splenda next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great sauce to have on hand for topping anything.  I used the full amount of sugar but I wish I'd cut back by 1/4 cup since my fresh blueberries were sweet enough.  No problem but I know next time to adapt it to the sweetness of the fruit.  I'm using this to top a cream cheese pie.

This was AWESOME!! I usually don't do reviews because I'm a tweaker, but I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfection! We used it for a "breakfast for dinner" night and put it on top of waffles. So good it was hard not to lick the bowl. It would be great in yogurt or cottage cheese or on cheesecake too. A definite keeper!

Simple and quick!  Made great use of some not so great blueberries I had in the frig.  I used it as a pancake topping instead of syrup.

Excellent. I covered the bottom of a non-stick skillet with frozen berries & sprinkled on about 2-3 T. of sugar. I mixed the cornstarch and water, poured over the berries and sugar and heated to boiling. It was a little too thick, so I added a bit more water to thin it out. Tasted for sweetness. Delicious! Served over waffles and topped with whipped cream.

Perfect as written--it was so good and so easy to make.  I added a little extra cornstarch and it wasn't needed.  Next time, I'll stick with the amounts listed.  I  put it on a lemon cheesecake pie, and everyone thought it was great.

Fabulous and super quick and easy. I will admit, I added about two tablespoons of orange liqueur to the liquid measure but I'm sure it would be delicious either way. We served these over fresh crepes.

I used a little less than 1/2 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet and used frozen organic wild blueberries. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully. Thank you!

Very quick and easy.  I used a little less sugar (splenda equivalent actually) because of the amount of sugar already naturally in blueberries.  It was a great topping on pancakes that the whole family enjoyed.

This blueberry sauce was AMAZING!  I used it on waffles made with the Bisquick box recipe (added 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to the waffle mix) and the combination was GREAT!  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the sauce like some reviewers suggested and the sauce had a nice thick consistency.  I like this sauce better than syrup for sure.

For an even more amazing taste experience, replace the water with blueberry wine. Don't worry about the alcohol as it cooks out while leaving a unique, great flavor. Yumilicious!

OMG! This is delicious! I also made the same recipe with a package of frozen mixed berries and that was just as good if not better. Normally I can't stand cooked berry sauces, but because it only simmers for a minute, you don't lose any of that fresh berry taste.

Awesome sauce.  I made this as a topping for our waffles, and it was easy and delicious.  I have made blueberry sauces before that call for lemon or cinnamon, but I actually prefer just the straight blueberry flavor coming through in this sauce.  Thanks!

Super!!!  I'm glad I didn't try the recipes with a lot more ingredients!  I made this while on vacation and all 4 of us thought it was unbelieveably good.  A keeper and so simple!!!  You could substitute the blueberries for strawberries, raspberries, etc!

I quadrupled the recipe and canned it in jelly jars.  Goes great in a gift basket with pancake mix or ice cream mix in with it.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that it worked really well to run the sugar and cornstarch through a flour sifter to get it well mixed.  It came out thicker consistency than I thought it would but heated up will be a perfect syrup and room temperature it makes a great cheesecake topping.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Well...I made this 3 days ago for the first time.  Yesterday, I ran out.  So I walked to the nearest store, a 5 minute walk, for more blueberries.  Four stores, several miles and quite a bit of time later I was still blueberry-less.  It was dark so I returned home.  But, now I have another jar of it cooling!  Crisis averted!!!  I'm only using 1/3 c. of sugar per 2 cups of blueberries.  This sauce is YUMMY!!

This is really simple to make & pretty good.  I am not a huge blueberry fan but decided to make this for friends, after being given a huge basket of blueberries. They thought it was really good. Served over pound cake and ice cream, topping it with whipped cream.  
I liked the ease of this recipe & the very short ingredients list.  Thanks!

This was soooooo good.  I am always so appreciative for SIMPLE recipes...who needs all the fancy ingredients??  There are five of us in our family and I am always looking for comforting, home cooked recipes, and this is burned in my cookbook.  Delicious warm on waffles, great on ice cream, love it, love it.  Thank you, thank you!!! I did a berry mix, also done with just raspberries, this is a great basic recipe and swich up the fruit...

Came out perfect.  I used as a topping for rice pudding.  I didnt have corn starch so I used some flour instead.

This was good, but I used 1/4 c honey and about 1/3 c sugar, plus orange juice instead of water. I also squeezed in the juice of one lemon to brighten it up.

This just happens to be one of the best sauces I have ever had!!!! It is definitely going to be in our family recipe book from now on!!!  The only thing that I did was substitute the sugar with Splenda being that I am diabetic.  It's definitely restaurant quality. Actually, I think its better than most restaurants I have been to.  Thank you!!!!

best!!!!! so easy, much "healthier" than store bought syrups and MORE delicious!! you really cant go wrong with this recipe, and I'd choose it over storebought syrups! used on pancakes. this topping is warm, tastes fresh and fruity and is simply delicious! i was suprised that it was so good b/c theres so little ingredients. WILL make again. just one thing it looks kind of gross when its boiling - you mite think your making it wrong but dont let it deter you. its beautiful when its finished

Loved it!!!  I did not thicken it with cornstarch, so it was more of a thin syrup and just lots of blueberry taste.  What a simple use ot the fresh blueberries on sale..

WAY too much sugar!  This could have been a 5 star blueberry topping, but the amount of sugar called for  (1/2 cup) is just entirely too sweet. I had to keep adding water, cornstarch, OJ...anything to make it not taste like candy!  ICK!  Finally, I adjusted it by adding more water and cornstarch and a pinch of salt and it tasted much better.  In my opinion, sugar should not be the main star of such a wonderful fruit, the blueberries should!  By not being so sweet, makes it a classier topping.

Simple, fast, and yummy! I had a cup of fresh blueberries to use up, so when my 3 year-old requested pancakes for breakfast this morning, this was the perfect opportunity to put those berries to a delicious use! I halved the recipe, and swirled in a Tbsp of butter, as I generally do when making blueberry sauce for pancakes, french toast, etc. as I prefer a slight buttery flavor without having to slather on extra.

Great sauce!  I did add a bit more cornstarch like some of the other reviewers because I wanted it a bit thicker to top a cheesecake.  I also added a few cranberries for color and taste (and since it is cranberry season)

This sauce was great!  The first time I make a recipe I tend to follow it exactly, then start making adjustments after that as needed...  But this doesn't need any changes.  I used frozen blueberries.  It doesn't get any easier!  So far my husband and I have had it on ice cream and on french toast.  We both agreed, as much as we like maple syrup on french toast, we like this even more.  I can see trying it on pancakes, waffles, cheesecake, lemon butter cake, white cake, shortcake, pound cake, plain yogurt, pudding, crepes....  The only thing is (and maybe this is a reflection of how much we liked it and therefore how much we used), I would say this recipe makes way less than 16 servings.  For us it was probably 8.  Thank you for submitting the recipe, Ellen.

The best so far. Instead of using water I used blueberry/pomegranate juice that is now so popular at the store.  My blueberries were very ripe and sweet so I scaled down the sugar to 1/3 cup.  It worked out great.

For a long time I have wanted to find a perfect blueberry sauce! This is it. Came out perfectly the first time. I did add an extra pinch of corn starch as one review said to do. No other change is necessary for a lightly sweet and true blueberry flavor. Easy, full of flavor and reheated beautifully! I used frozen Wyman's blueberries. The small sweet Maine berries are the best. Try it on the lemon pound cake recipe found on the side of the Duncan Hines lemon supreme cake mix box! I pleased ten hungry people who LOVED it. The warm sauce was the trick!!

Scaled down to 8 servings which was just enough for 3 waffles. Served with "Waffles I." My daughters had a kick when they looked at their tongues.

I make this all the time.  Every Saturday for pancakes!  I use 1/2 the sugar and once I bring to a boil I simmer on lowest setting for 10 minutes to cook the berries until they burst because that is just how I like it.  I have also made this with strawberries, rasberries, blackberries and a combo of everything...whatever is on hand.  Fresh or frozen.

This was fantastic and I couldn't believe how simple it was, nor the fact that it turned out so well using frozen blueberries.  I served with Vanilla Crepes.  Yum!

UPDATE: Just finished off a strawberry batch.  Lovely.  ORIGINAL: Made exactly as directed and (as so many others have already noted), could NOT stop licking the spoon.  Consistency is just right - thicker than store bought pancake syrup - with lovely chunks of berries.  Can't thank you enough! UPDATE 1: Making my 3rd batch in 7 days - that's how good this stuff is.  Yield is apx 1 1/2 cup.  Have had mixed with yogurt, crepes, pies, ice-cream, waffles, and pancakes.  Even whipped up a blue/strawberry shake (survey's belly, sighs, and trots off to gym).

Fantastic!  This recipe is great as written.  We served this over our waffles this morning.  I will note, however, that although this recipe says it makes 16 servings, my husband and I had just enough for ourselves for this morning's breakfast with some leftovers.

Just like everyone else says - it's quick, it's easy and it's yummy!  I did use 2 T of corn starch for a cheesecake and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Quick and easy.  Only change I made was to use 2 Tb. of corn starch, as others had recommended.  I used frozen blueberries and found it very sweet.  (This, from someone who likes to eat sugar straight.)  I loved it, but it would've been too sweet for some.  Since blueberries can differ so much in regards to sweetness, I'd recommend starting with about 2/3 c. of sugar then adding more to taste.  I put it on fat free, sugar free cheesecake pudding.  Sure, it's not *as* healthy, but the family loved it and we got those good antioxidants, too.

This was really good! I used frozen blueberries and decreased the sugar a bit, as I like more blueberry flavour and less sweetness. I served it over whole wheat pancakes and it was delicious!

This was really good over french toast.  Will use the leftovers over vanilla ice cream!  The measurements are perfect but it needs to cook longer than the 1 minute stated in the recipe to thicken the appropriate amount.

So good for something so simple. This is perfect for a quick and delicious pancake topping or crepe filling.  You could easily add cinnamon or whatever to taste, but it's perfect as is.

YUMMY! So easy to make, and so tasty! I used frozen blueberries right out of the freezer. I originally put this on top of "Blueberry Flax Pancakes" and it was awesome. Now I've got to find ways to incorporate this sauce into all of my breakfasts :)

Delicious...works with splenda too! I don't recommend trying to keep it in the fridge for more than two days. Eventually the bond of the cornstarch deteriorates and it becomes lumpy blueberry soup instead of a syrup (I think this was 5 days later). Delicious on pancakes and over vanilla ice cream

I used this recipe to make cherry pie filling instead of using the canned.  I used 1 1/2 times the cornstarch, since I was going for a thicker sauce, and used frozen tart cherries.  This is a great recipe to use on many fruits, whenever I want a fruit sauce - great tool to have!

Tastes great, easy, quick. I used store-brand Splenda instead of sugar. Served warm over an English Muffin. I plan to try it cold mixed into plain Greek yogurt.

This was fantastic.  I added a layer of this to the Easy Cream Cheese Danish recipe on this site and it was incredible. I used fresh blueberries.  I still have plenty left over and I look forward to using it in my yogurt and pancakes.

I had 2 lbs of blueberries in the fridge that were in danger of going bad (Costco had a sale and I went a bit nuts) so I needed a recipe and I needed one quick. This fit the bill perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly for the first batch, and while it was AMAZING I did find it a bit sweet. So for my second batch I reduced the sugar by a third, and for fun threw in a tablespoon of Cointreau. Soooo good. Can't wait to try this on cheesecake and waffles (if I don't eat it all by the spoonful first)!
Jan2012 edit: I'm still regularly making this recipe, and have even canned some to sell at our church's Fall Fair and to give away as Christmas gifts. Compliments all around. :)

We love this sauce on French Toast or ice cream.  Delicious warm or cold.  The first time I made it we thought it was too sweet, so I cut the sugar in half.  I once was out of cornstarch and it still made a nice sauce, just a little thinner.  I was looking for something without spices or orange juice to take away from the blueberry flavor and this is just perfect.  It's so easy to make all of my kids have made it at least once.

Amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I ate this with the Blueberry Oat Waffles found on this site and it was truly divine--the best waffles I've ever had, all thanks to this sauce!  This is definitely a keeper!  Edit:  I've also made this with strawberries and blackberries and the result is just as good!  Now that I'm on a diet, I use Splenda instead of sugar and it comes out just the same!  Ellen, I cannot thank you enough for this sauce; it's fantastic!

I made this to serve over Creamy Lemon-Blueberry Dessert.  I thought the consistency was just right--not too thick, not too thin.  I can see making this in the future to serve with pancakes.  Good stuff!

Excellent recipe.  I don't much care for pancake syrup (and maple syrup is so expensive), so this is a wonderful alternative for me!  I mainly use this for pancakes and waffles, but it would also be really good over ice cream or cheesecake.  I've made this with fresh blueberries and frozen, and both work well.  I've also made this with sliced peaches, cherries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries with excellent results.  It also freezes and reheats well.

Excellent and easy recipe. I made this with half the sugar as a sauce for salmon to replicate a dish I had at a restaurant. It was delicious. My son and I ate the leftover sauce right out of the pan for dessert :)

This recipe makes a very nice sauce.  Used fresh blueberries and at the end of cooking (had to cook longer than 1 minute, by the way; probably 3 minutes before it was no longer runny) added a couple of squeezes of fresh lemon juice.

I will never buy to use as a topping a can of blueberry pie filling again!  This recipe is GREAT!  I cut down on the sugar but that is what is great, you can make as sweet as you want.  We put on pancakes and cheesecake -yummy!

Fabulous it works with raspberries too. I've been using this recipe for canning. Uses way less sugar then what jam takes and no pectin. Makes wonderful gifts.

Easiest topping for a cheesecake I've ever made in a pinch...and I can control the sugar with any berry I use.  I used fresh berries, which can sometimes use just a little sugar but I used 1/3 cup sugar and the contrast with the cheesecake's sweetness was wonderful.  Next time maybe add some lemon zest at the end for a fresh zing.

This was pretty good, but it was way too sweet for me. I had some blueberries that had been fresh-picked at a u-pick farm, and most were still a day or two from being 100% ripe, so I thought with the tartness and reducing the amount of sugar, it wouldn't taste too sweet. I'd cut the amount of sugar in half and add some lemon zest/juice next time.

Fast, easy, and fantastic. What could be better? I used frozen wild blueberries and added an extra half-tablespoon of cornstarch, as I wanted the sauce to be a wee bit thicker. I let it boil for two minutes, and the consistency was just right for serving over ice cream. After spending the night in the fridge, the flavor was even better. We ate the remainder on buttered toast over the next three days, and it was still perfect. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

We loved this blueberry sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to add about another teaspoon of cornstarch because it was a little too runny for my taste. I served it over Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes from this site and it was really good.  I'll be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used frozen, unsweetened blueberries and one guest commented that it was nice that it didn't have the super sweet taste of pancake syrup.  2 Tbsp cornstarch gave it the consistency of jam, but it was great.  Blueberries don't roll off the pancakes on the way to your mouth. :) Thanks so much Ellen!

This is an old favorite of mine. I make it with 1/2 cup water (rather than 1/3 cup) and I add 1 tsp. lemon juice and a dash of salt, which brings out the flavor better, and will make it a 5 star rating.

My 3-year-old son and I picked blueberries together and had a huge amount that he wanted nothing to do with tasting. (Picky kid.) I started with this recipe poured over pancakes, one of his favorite foods. At first he protested and refused to eat them, but after deciding to eat around the topping, he eventually got distracted enough in the conversation to get sloppy in his picking around it. After getting a smidgen of this sauce, he started licking it off of his pancakes! Needless to say, blueberries became his favorite fruit and this recipe is why. It is simple, delicious and absolutely one you should try. I'd recommend trying with raspberries and blueberries together, as well.

An awesome sauce for breakfast and for cheesecake. If I am making for a cheesecake, I thicken the sauce with cornstarch. Delicious......

This was really good.  I used mixed berries instead of just blueberries...which were frozen (barely thawed) instead of fresh.  Served over slices of pound cake.

Excellent blueberry sauce!  I use fresh blueberries from our bush.  I have made it with sugar and without.  Without sugar it tastes more sour, so I add a little less than half a cup.  I have used this sauce to pour over banana pancakes and to go with an angel food cake, always served warm.

This is an easy sauce with few ingredients...it's perfect.  I have made this with frozen blueberries and it's been a huge hit with my family.  A great way to use the frozenberries in my freezer.

I used 2 cups of frozen Berry Medley from Sam's Club. One Tb. of corn starch was perfect--I read that some people added more but it was plenty thick. I also added about a 1/2 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon, and 2 t. butter.

The first time, I made this exactly as written. I thought it was good but I could taste the cornstarch too much.  The second time, I added 1 tsp. of lime juice and a dash of cinnamon, and the corn starch flavor was gone.  The lime juice didn't make the sauce too sour and the cinnamon just enhanced the blueberry flavor.  Perfection.  Thanks for the base recipe!

I made this with a package of frozen mixed berries. After thawing the berries, there was enough liquid so I didn't need to add the water. Used 1 1/2 TBSP of cornstarch to make it a little thicker for cheesecake topping. Just right!

So easy, very tasty, and versatile. I used blueberries and a few leftover blackberries to make this...and plated it on the side of a blackberry buttermilk cake - my guests raved about it. Made the recipe exactly as is, but halved the portion size. Perfect.

Very tasty recipe.  I made this for the top of no bake cheese cake.  The flavor was great.  I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it a little more.  This made it almost gel like.  I won't use quite as much next time.

Very quick and easy! Makes a nice amount and keeps well if you do have any left. It's 5 stars as written...sometimes I add a hint of cinnamon and a dash of almond extract depending on what I'm using it for. It's great stirred in oat bran; my kids love this combo!

Sooo easy, and not just for breakfast! I was looking for something for desert. Too hot to bake today and decided on mango sorbet that I had on hand - but it seemed too plain by itself. I made the blueberry sauce after breakfast, since I didn't use the berries in pancakes as I had planned (hubby decided he wanted bacon, eggs, and grits instead). It was a bit thick and real sweet - so after letting it stand at room temp for a bit - and adding a squeeze of lemon - it was PERFECT drizzled on the sorbet! Great light desert on this summer evening - Thanks Ellen.

Thank you for sharing this quick and simple recipe. Just what I was looking for to top the blueberry pancakes I made for a "special occasion" breakfast. Couldn't stop licking the spoon! Perfect.

This was soooo easy to make with a bunch of fresh blueberries that was left from our bluberry picking day.  Served this over plain cake and even saw my brother licking his fingers after cleaning his plate !!

Yummy and fast. The second time I did this I made it in the microwave. I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch, which made it come out a little bit more like pie filling.

I thought this was a great sauce. At first I thought it was too sweet, but once it chilled it was perfect. We used it over cheesecake.

This recipe was excellent and so easy!  I wanted to add a little depth of flavor, so right before it thickened completely up, I added 1/4 tsp of ground cinnamon & a dash of each ground nutmeg & ground cloves!  SO awesome!

If you have left over, frozen blueberries, and you just don't know what to do with them?  Then make this wonderful recipe.  I made an angel food cake and just did not want to make icing for it.  I found this recipe and that cake was gone in seconds.  Now I make this every time I make an angel food, or pancakes, or French toast.  Just one word of advice, double this, or you will be crying when it is all gone. =^o^=

Only because I couldn't make the recipe to a T does it get 4 stars.  I don't know how the recipe would be if I did.  I didn't have any cornstarch so I used a little extra flour and used fresh blueberries so I needed some extra water.  Boiled for about 3 minutes over medium heat. Served on pancakes.  I would reduce the sugar as well.  Simple with a great blueberry taste, will definitely use again!

I have yet to use on anything other than pancakes, but it is absolutely delicious.  The sugar amount may have to be adjusted depending on the sweetness of the blueberries and also for preference.  Every one who has tried this loves it.

Super easy to make and yummy! I will absolutely make again but I think that I will reduce the sugar. The sauce was plenty sweet, not too sweet but I like the idea of using this instead of syrup and cutting back on the sugar a little.

Absolutely delicious; the juice from 1/2 a lime (replaces part of the water) kicks the flavor up several notches, without tasting at all lime-y.

This is just like the blueberry sauce we had in Alaska.  I've been trying to duplicate it and am so glad I found this recipe.  I like it because it tastes fresh and the berries remain whole.  It's among my favorite breakfast recipes and I intend to serve it to guests that come up for football games.  I'm not going to save this for breakfast though.  It would be great on pound cake.  Thank you!

This blueberry sauce was excellent and easy. My family really liked this sauce. I liked it, but I'm wondering if I could use less sugar, next time. I like blueberry sauce with orange juice and lemon zest, but I didn't have any orange juice or lemons. This worked great, instead.

I used frozen blueberries that I picked and froze, myself. I let the blueberries thaw for about 1/2 hour, first, sitting over a jar of hot water. I also used a 3 quart pan because I don't have a 2 quart pan. I have an electric/ceramic cooktop stove, and it took about 20 minutes to bring the sauce to boiling with the dial turned one notch higher than medium heat. I also let it boil for two minutes instead of one because it didn't seem thick enough. It was perfect. 

Thanks for the recipe.

I had to double the corn starch as well to get the consistency I wanted.  A bit sweet, but otherwise, very good.  I love how easy it was to make.
