This was pretty good soup. The flavor was quite good, but could have used something more. I wonder about adding cheese to it? Also, I added flour to thicken it, because it was not very creamy, as I tend to like.

I used Mrs. Dash for the non-salt seasoning and it was very strong.  My kids were not real fond of it and I really wasn't either.

Excellent. Minimal changes; I don't typically measure seasonings in soup...I used 2% instead of soy milk...and I did not add broccoli, I was looking for a more traditional soup so I did add about six slices of browned and crumbled bacon (more for my man's tastes than mine I guess). Served with toast, super simple.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars, mostly due to the changes I made to mine. It was a good base recipe though.
I used Russet potatoes, peeled & chopped.
I omitted the carrot.
I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic, chopped
Omitted the Italian seasoning and used fresh black pepper instead
I used skim milk instead of soy milk and I first made a roux with flour & butter. 
Also omitted the broccoli.

OK, I made A LOT of changes. This was delicious.

This was pretty good but I made some revisions. I didn't have salt less herb blend or Italian seasoning so I opted for salt, pepper, thyme, parsley flakes and 4 cloves of garlic. I also eyeballed about 2 cups of pre cut broccoli into the crock when putting everything else in. I let cook on high for  5 hours ish then added half and half. I'm not sure how much, I eyeballed it. Probablly 1.5c. I know that sounds like a lot but I'm going for a creamier soup. I then thickened it with some corn starch as well. Added a final dash of salt, pepper and thyme to tAste and let thicken for a half hour. I served hot with Parmesan cheese on top. Oh yeah. I also used 3 carrots and 1 onion. :) will be making again. Thanks!

This was a really yummy recipe, I used homemade chicken stock, added corn and used 2% milk instead of soy but those were my only alterations and it was delicious! I will make this again!!!

I liked this recipe, especially because I was looking for something without cheese. I made a few changes that I thought made it better however. I used 2 vegetable bouillon cubes and 16oz water and 14.5oz can of chicken broth. I used 2% Milk instead of soymilk. I also added cornstarch at the very end to thicken it up. Lastly, I didn't add any seasoning at the beginning, I added parsley and italian seasoning at the end and I added white pepper that gave it a very nice home cooked meal flavor to complement the veggies.

This was pretty good....I did make some changes.  I omitted the celery and broccoli while adding some crushed red pepper flakes and bacon.  This soup is very versatile.  I think next time I will add flour to thicken it and red onions.

It called for way to much spices, no one in the house would eat it myself included, so I definetly would not make this again or suggest it.
