Pretty good and easy dough.  The instructions, however, are missing a step--there's an egg in this recipe but it's not clear when to add it.  After trying this, I've now realized it goes into the dough--you need 1 1/4 cups of liquid, and the egg is the 1/4 cup.  I made this in the bread machine--more out of laziness and wanting to multitask than anything else--and forgot to check it until it was done.  That's when I realized it needed more liquid.  No big; I just added in liquid (put in water bc I wasn't thinking) and let it go again.  This made for a light, quick pizza dough that is perfect for a regular thick crust.  If you like thin crust, you'd probably want to make two crusts out of it.  Made it for D's Taco Pizza recipe and it worked well.  thanks for the recipe!

I gave this five stars because it's good and it's easy to do and time to do it is next to nothing.  It's a flexible recipe, too, as herbs can be added to the dough according to one's taste.

I wasn't sure how to rate this.  I didn't follow it very well.  I started out with the intention of following it, but discovered I didn't have any eggs.  Turns out, I'm glad I didn't.  The egg makes the dough too cakeish.  I wanted a lighter dough.  I substituted about a quarter cup of hot tap water.  The step I liked was stirring the oil and flour together.  It seems to lighten the crust.  I also didn't knead it but about two minutes.  The more you knead it, the smaller and more uniform the holes in the crust made by the yeast are.  I wanted more variation.  It was easily elastic enough.  It turned out just right as far as texture goes.  Next time I'll add a bit more salt.  I also don't understand people who want tons of flavor in the crust.  Isn't that what you put the stuff on top for?

I make this dough all the time.  I love that it can be ready in about 90 minutes.  I make one deviation from the recipe - I make a well in the flour and salt mixture and pour in the eggs (beaten), olive oil and yeast mixture and then I mix everything together to form the dough.  My family now prefers homemade pizza to delivery.

Very Easy to make! Add your own seasonings into the dough mixture according to your own taste. Not everyone likes the same toppings on there pizza in my home. I put pulled pork with red onions on one side and turkey taco left overs with fresh tomato and onions on the other added mozzarella all over a little more seasoning  it came out great! I suggest 17 to 18 mins of cook time at 425 instead of 20 mins.

I have been looking for a light but not crispy pizza dough ever since we visited Italy this summer. This one is great and so easy. If I were to make a big batch and freeze it would I freeze it before or after rising?

This was pretty easy recipe to follow. After I had started, I remembered that I didn't have any eggs so I used a suggestion from a couple reviews that said to use 1/4 cup of hot water. The dough rose and rolled quite well. I have tried a few other recipes and they were flavorless so I added a healthy sprinkle of Johnny's Garlic Spread & Seasoning to it. It smelled amazing while it was cooking. The recipe itself is missing the instructions on how to cook it once the dough is complete. I rolled mine fairly thin, so I baked it at 425Â° for 15 minutes. The crust is nice and golden. Enjoy!

Overall, it was a pretty good recipe. It was a bit too dry at first but i added a bit of oil and set it out to rise for a bit and it was perfect. Just before the pizza went into the oven, I dabbed some garlic herb butter on the crust and it was wonderful. Definitely recommend and will make again.

Loved the recipe as it was, however, I did change out the flour to use Caputo Double 0 Pizza Flour.  It makes a big difference!  My Italian Store carries it... U can also get it online from Amazon..Also, I use corn meal mixed with Olive Oil on the bottom of the Pizza Pan.  Really bring the texture and taste of the dough alive...

the bread lacks flavor, and the cheese burnt too quickly using the suggested cooking time.  it came out decent.  will tweak it for future uses.

MEAN recipe!!! The proportions made it exactly how I want my pizza texture to be, if you knead in as much extra flour as the dough wants to catch. Ie: use mass flour on your kneading board.
We added 1 tsp of cumin, 2 tsp of coriander and 2 tsp herbs into the mix for our style of flavour.
For those confused about when to add the egg, we broke the egg onto the dries and whisked it in for about 30 secs, just trying to whisk the egg alone basically, then oil really start mixing whole thing and then added the yeast mix and it worked fab, the whole thing rose like hell burgers. I think you don't want to overbeat these things unless you want the bread more tough.
Awesome recipe tyvm Ignazia!
We are gonna be putting on some happy pounds - no wait - it's soo yummy we won't need any pud!
PS found a great place to rise dough - on the computer box! Took half the time to double!
PPS personally I only cooked it for about 25 min fanbake at 165 degrees celcius, bit cooler than author. Golden and crunchy with heaps of rise.

First of all let me say that this recipe was really easy to fix, easy to follow instructions. We didn't like the texture of the finished product though and I have to agree with another person who wrote a review that the bread lacked flavor. We decided to give it another try and add herbs to the dough to see if that changes the flavor to where we like it. Since we just moved into this house and the oven is pretty new to us, we cut down the temp and left it in for almost the time that was suggested but the cheese was getting dark so we took it out earlier.

Meh. Tasted and felt like bread. I coud have bought a decent loaf and used it as a pizza crust and it would have saved me an hour or so of my life, not to mention washing a bunch of bowls and stuff.

I made 5 pizzas over the weekend for the family.  This recipe was the above average recipe. Most liked the Master Pizza Dough recipe, but this came in second. It was good and the pizza went, so I probably will make it again.

I made bacon, chicken, ranch pizza with this dough twice. I shared some with a neighbor who told me this was the best pizza dough she's ever eaten.  Thanks for the recipe.

Is it the perfect looking and forming dough?   Yes.  It is easy to shape and it keeps.  It keeps shape very well.  
Is it the best tasting crust? No. It reminds me of the crust of the frozen pizzas.  It hold the toppings, but taste a little like cardboard.  It lacks flavour.  The only difference in this recipe and may others are the added Egg and Olive Oil.  I can't see why these items would detract from the taste.  The salt is the same.   I can only guess there is a reason it's not a normal pizza recipe.  
After the dough was done rising, I could see something was wrong.  Something inhibits the elasticity.  The gluten was not acting normally.  Which allowed it to be shaped very easily, but just was not right.  
Sorry, I am not trying to be mean.  I think it is perfect for on the go family, that needs to make a quick no fuss pizza crust.  I have struggled with dough being hard to make shape in the past.  I did like how easy it was to work with, but the flavour matter more to me.

It's all about the egg!

The name says Italian but the egg screams FRENCH!!! Great formula... The crust is crunchier on the outside, softer on the inside and has incredible color all thanks to the "incredible edible egg".

Plus if you take the time to egg wash the edge... Wowza! A few pennies and you get a shiny golden gleam around your pie and Wala, all of a sudden your crust isn't the foundation, it's the star of the show!

This formula easily sized up for 50-12" pies, stored well, acted the same fresh and the next day as well. This dough is a keeper!

I'm a classically trained bakery pastry chef and I know a winner from a loser. My money's on this one in every race!

Very easy to make and in no time at all. Can you make the day before and leave it in the refrigerator? Can you freeze it?

Great pizza dough.  This has been my new go to for a few months now.  Using it tonight for a ham and cheese calzone.  I messed up and forgot the egg. After I had mixed everything I noticed that the dough seemed dry.   Went and double checked the recipe when I noticed I forgot the egg.  Took a chance and added it in anyway with a bit more flower and it's right back to where it's supposed to be.  Can't wait to get it into the oven
