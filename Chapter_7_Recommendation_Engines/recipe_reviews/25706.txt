I don't usually rate recipes I had to change (do you rate on the original or on what you did?), but there are very few reviews for this and it deserves some comment.  First, the title is odd to me since it isn't a vegetable-heavy recipe. I added some frozen chopped okra at the same time I added the corn to actually have some veggies in the chili. Next, although you can make this in the time listed, it benefits GREATLY by allowing it to simmer for an hour or so before adding the corn. The flavors need that amount of time to marry, especially if you use ground turkey like I did. That also helps the chili thicken. Speaking of flavors, I kicked it up quite a bit. The recipe doesn't call for any salt. Even using a salted broth, I found that it needed additional salt. I added about 1.5 tsp. I also bumped up the spices for a total of 3 tsp chili powder and 1.5 tsp cumin. Additionally, I added about 1/2 tsp red pepper, 1/4 tsp smoked paprika and a bay leaf. I'd also suggest sprinkling a little of the chili powder and cumin on the turkey at the time you brown it so that the flavors can better permeate what can be a rather bland turkey taste. I love how the cinnamon gives the chili a lovely smell and adds complexity. It is a versatile recipe, lending itself to modification.  I used black beans and black-eyed peas (what I had on hand) and those were yummy in it. I'll be making modified versions of this recipe in the future.

This recipe was fast and easy to make with items I always have in the pantry. I used cubed dark meat turkey instead of breast meat. My family thought it was too mild and needed some spicing up so you might want to increase the spices to your taste. Sour crean added a nice flavor but the chili still could have been thicker.

I can't understand why one one review of this recipe shows.  I originally saw it a number of years ago and never try recipes less than four or five stars.  We love it.  Not usually having cubed turkey or chicken on hand, I usually use either ground turkey or ground beef.  It lends itself well to a vegetarian version, too.

Yummy chili.  I did add more cumin and chili powder--couldn't resist, and added more beans by putting in chickpeas as well, and dumped in picante sauce I had in the fridge just because I didn't have canned diced tomatoes (thought I did, but apparently not).  I almost completely forgot the corn and added that in at the last minute.  This makes for a lot of chili--or I just added  a lot of stuff--but hubs and I really enjoyed it.  I did decide to plop it all in the slow cooker and let it simmer all day, which I'm glad I did.  Only issue is that the slow cooker made it watery, but I kept the lid off for the last hour or so of cooking which helped it thicken.  All in all, I did add some things but I think it's a versatile recipe that allows you to do it, and it turned out well.  thanks for the recipe1
