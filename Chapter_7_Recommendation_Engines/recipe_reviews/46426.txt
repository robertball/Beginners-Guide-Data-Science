I made this recipe for a school function because one of the moms is diabetic.  These did not turn out at all how I expected.  They didn't rise as much as your typical cheesecake, and once they cooled they sunk in.  Since they didn't look too appealing I decided to try one before taking them to serve to a group of people.  There was an over-powering taste of egg and artificial sweetner.  This recipe needs tweeking to make it work.  Maybe substitute low fat vanilla yogurt instead of non fat plain for some flavor?  Needs less egg also.  Needless to say, I did not take these to the school function and had to run to the grocery store at the last minute.  I gave this recipe a 2 star rating instead of 1 only because I think it could have potential with the right adjustments.  (Maybe someone good at adjusting could offer ideas?)

I agree with the first reviewer - the recipe needs tweeking.  My mom is a diabetic and my mother in law con not eat sugar (she's been on a sugar free diet for more than half her life).  So I tweeked the ingredients as follows:

1/2 cup splenda sweetened raspberry yogurt 
2 egg whites - no substitute this gives a better rise and taste and a diabetic can gauge the intake if the ingredients are listed if the take insulin.

I also mixed in blueberries for two reasons: 1. they are a great source of antioxidants and 2. they added a zing of berry flavor and rasperries can lose upon cooking.

My treat, with modifications, went over so well I've had to make them for every large and not-so-large meal since.  Both moms love them - can't beat that!

Happy cooking!
