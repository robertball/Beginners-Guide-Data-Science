I used skim milk with this recipe and let the pudding sit overnight-the filling was nice and firm the next day when I added the fruit.  Very refreshing for a hot day and not too sweet-highly recommended.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe when I read the previous reviews, but I have to say I don't know what the negative comments were about!! I made this as a dessert for my fiance on Valentine's Day, and both he and I LOVED it! The vanilla pudding had a subtle sweetness but didn't overpower with its flavor. You have to let the pudding sit for five minutes before pouring it into the pie crust -- that way the crust won't get soggy. I used a graham cracker crust, brushed it with egg whites and baked for 5 minutes at 350 degrees -- made the crust shiny and stronger. I found that four hours was the perfect time to let the pudding chill in the crust in the fridge. SO GOOD! Thank you!

We thought this would be OK ... but it's amazing!  We used the same fruits as in the recipe (except no raspberries), with a graham cracker crust and pre-made pudding cups, and apricot jam for the glaze.  Buying pre-made crust and pudding saved lots of time, and cutting the fruit really didn't take long at all.  This is the PERFECT summertime or cookout dessert - so light tasting, and sweet enough without being overpowering.  TRY THIS RECIPE!
Updated to add:  Be sure to only make what you'll eat right away, though, because it does NOT last in the fridge;  the glaze puddles on top of the pudding, which is not very attractive.

I made this the day before I took it to a dinner party.  The crust was soggy from the pudding.  I also didn't like the cooked pudding.  (I'm used to instant.)  I would only go with either blueberries or raspberries, not both.  There wasn't much room with the other fruits so might as well not have to buy both to only put a few pieces on.  1 c of peaches was 1 peach.  1 c kiwi slices was 2 kiwis.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe, just not my preference.  I was really excited about making it and both my friends and I were disappointed with it.

These fruity tarts were big hit at our last school luncheon.  We used VIP brand mini pie shells and the melted jam over brushed over the top made them look too pretty to eat, well almost. Great submission, and super easy make ahead dessert.

Excellent dessert!  Be careful of amount of milk
for size pudding.  My package was 3 oz. so I only needed 2 C milk.

The taste was great, but I had a problem with the pudding being too soft.  When I got ready to cut it, the pudding was still somewhat liquid and spead all over the place.  I had to just spoon out the pie onto the plates.  Luckily I served it to my family and nobody complained.  I will give this recipe another try, though.  Next time I will use less milk.

Very tasty! However, the pudding did not firm up very well, despite overnight chilling. No matter! I used only strawberries and it was delicious. As others have said, it came out a bit runnier than I had hoped and I used a spoon to serve it. I may try again using proper custard that will set nicely. Very easy recipe, though, and it sure looks impressive. I used apricot jam to glaze and it looked beautiful. All in all, yum.

This was a hit with my family! First they just thought it looked gorgeous and it was! I just used strawberries blueberries and kiwis. I let the pie with the pudding in it set all night then added the fruit just before we left for dinner. Before puting the fruit down I drizzled a little honey to help it "stick" and then drizzled strawberry jam on top as directed. It tasted great! Maybe I will try banana pudding next time and add bananas on top.

Eh. I don't know what I expected. It tasted exactly how you would imagine. I used only peaches with a marmalade glaze and it was gorgeous, but pudding heavy and indelicate.

I really wanted to try this but couldn't get vanilla pudding mix so used vanilla pudding from this site. I also had to vary the fruit a bit. There were no peaches in my local supermarket and raspberries and blueberries were incredibly expensive so I used strawberries, kiwi and red grapes. Still looks very pretty and was a big hit. I can see this being a great standby dessert for unexpected company. Thanks

This fruit tart was so good! I took another reviewer's recommendation and brushed the graham cracker crust with eggs whites and baked it at 350 for about 5 mintues. I liked that this dessert wasn't too sweet.

Won't make again. I used a brand name pudding & fruit jam, but didn't care for it. Blah. I could take the time to make it alot better buy making vanilla pudding from scratch & using a different crust. I'd leave off the jam because I don't think it did a thing. My fruit was basic - strawberry & blackberries which were fine.

I used instant puding and the pie broke when we tried to cut it, but nobody cared about it, because it tasted so good. I will make it again. It's easy and looks good, too.

When I tried it the pie shell didn't hold up but maybe was because i used instant pudding (couldn't find non instant) and used shortbread pie shell. Not advised but was great even mashed up. Nice change to have something yo use fruit in.

My husband made this for my birthday and it was fantastic! He said it was super easy to make. The whole family loved it. He used canned peaches instead of fresh, as that's all he could find (he rinsed them to remove some of the sugar). It wasn't nearly as sweet as I thought it would be, but it was perfect. Really great recipe, and it looked just beautiful too.

Pudding was not too sweet so it was a nice light desert, and very appealing to the eye.
