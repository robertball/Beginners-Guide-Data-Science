I admit it. I changed the recipe, but only because I was too lazy to make my own pie crust for tartlet shells. I used puff pastry instead. The filling was very nice, with the blue cheese and onions and pears really playing nicely together. I might suggest using half blue and half cream cheese to make the filling a bit creamier, but that's an opinion thing. I will make these again, and I might even make them as tartlets next time!
