Very good, tasty soup. My picky kids wouldn't eat it because of the tomato chunks and beans (they just had plain spaghetti - easy enough!), but my husband and I liked it. I had no prior experience with beef marrow bone and was a little skeptical, but it worked out well and added a nice flavor. The recipe doesn't say to remove the bone before serving the soup (or the bay leaves for that matter), but I did - personal preference. I also used dry herbs instead of fresh - might try fresh if I make this again. Overall, a nice, satisfying soup.

My family & friends loved this soup.  Made it the day before and the beans & tomato had mixed in to thicken & flavour on the day we ate it.  A very hearty rich delicious soup.  Thanks.

I made exactly as described, except that I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so I used Liquid Aminos instead. I thought it was"ok." Adding baked beans to it gave it an interesting flavor.
