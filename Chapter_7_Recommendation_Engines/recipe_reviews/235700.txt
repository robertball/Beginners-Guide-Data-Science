Easy, tasty and brought lots of compliments from my relatives after the Christmas Day dinner because it was so refreshing.

I loved how easy this recipe was compared to other peppermint pie recipes I've tried.  I crushed soft peppermint candies rather than candy canes (I don't like the way bits of candy cane get stuck in my teeth) and put a layer of dark chocolate syrup in the middle of the layers as well as on the top.  Everyone at the party loved it!
