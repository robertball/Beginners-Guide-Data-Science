I submitted this recipe, and my family and I love it.  Feel free to leave the bacon off for a vegetarian side.  *Step 3 should read to cook the butternut squash UNTIL tender.....Enjoy!

This was lovely! Add some crushed red pepper for a bit of that sweet/spicy kick. Will certainly make again

The ingredients were a great combination, I just found that the squash needed more time to cook. I also used veggie bacon. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper, and some liquid smoke. A nice side dish for burgers.

Not worth the trouble it took to make it.  The maple flavor needed some balance.  Will not make again.

I just made this and it is pretty good. I used 1 large diced carrot because I did not have squash. I also used a leek instead of onion. Quick, easy and very tasty.

I was looking for something different to do with my butternut squash and this dish definitely fit the bill! It was a hit!!! I followed the recipe as written except that I used the whole squash (it was a small one, but amounted to more than a cup) and I only used 1 tbsp total of maple syrup (personal preference). I had to substitute regular broccoli for the baby broccoli as I couldn't find any baby broccoli at the store. Once the dish was ready, I thought it could use a little kick, so I added a dash of red pepper flakes. That did indeed add another depth of flavor that my boyfriend and I really liked. I served it with cornbread and garlic chicken. I will definitely make this again, and I will keep an eye out for baby broccoli so I can use it next time. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!
