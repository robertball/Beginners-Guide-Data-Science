Coming from an italian family, I make everything from scratch. Let me tell you, the texture of this recipe is awesome. I used to go to a Brazilian restaurant that sold a very similar cake with ice cream. It is to die for. The only change I made was omitting the coffee the second time I made it, as it is a little strong for my children.  I received so many compliments about how good this cake taste. They are very susceptible to breaking when unmolding, so I now make it in soufflé cups and they look and taste great

This recipe delivered everything I could ask for in a classy restaurant dessert, and it was easy! Be sure to really whip your eggs, I used a food processor. That will make the difference between eggy/rubbery results vs the divine cake that whipped eggs makes.  Yes, using high quality chocolate is preferred but I usually don't have that on hand. I used about 6 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips, melted in the microwave with the butter for two 20 second intervals.  I have tried other "molten lava cakes" from this site and this is by far the best one, in my opinion.

It was as easy as the recipe stated. I was leery of the instant potatoes, but it was quite good. I impressed the hell out of my boyfriend.

This had an interesting texture; I will try to beat it longer, which may make a better cake

These are delicious. The challenge I've had is finding the right bake time. But that's between me and my oven. The recipe is solid.
