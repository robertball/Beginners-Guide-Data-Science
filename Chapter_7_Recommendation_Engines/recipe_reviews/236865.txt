Substituted FF half-and-half for the heavy whipping cream (sorry, simply can't handle that in my diet), otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  Love the flavor that the bacon brings, but I thought it was too thin for a "chowder." To be fair, that may not have been the case had I used the heavy whipping cream.   I did thicken a little, but it still wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.  BUT...it did taste good, so I consider it a success!
