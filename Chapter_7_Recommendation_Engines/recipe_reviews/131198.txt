This was so good!! I doubled the recipe and it came out great! I added pineapple chunks to the top of the pasta as well before pouring the sauce and shrimp on top. It was surprisingly light and I was so happy that everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely be making it again soon!

Delicious!  No need to change anything.  Top with a little crushed red pepper and parmesan and take it down!

Too much pepper! The pepper over powers the flavors of the whole dish! I have now learned an important lesson, salt & pepper to taste! ...Never to what a recipe states!! I think otherwise this would be a fantastic recipe! I think it would go great with rice and maybe add some broccoli!

Excellent.  Try using "Little Bowtie" Farfalle, pasta; it holds the zest and sauce very well.

I made this for dinner tonight and was not the least bit impressed.  Neither my boyfriend or I could finish even half our plates.  I think it called for way too much orange and lemon zest.  If I try this again I will only used 1 tsp of each and add lemon juice as well.

Fantastic!! I used whole wheat linguini instead of regular.  Also added a little lime juice with the orange juice..

The zest came through very strongly, all you could taste was orange and lemon zest.
