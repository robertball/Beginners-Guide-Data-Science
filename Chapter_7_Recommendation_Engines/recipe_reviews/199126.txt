I thought this was and excellent alternative to the usual basil pesto. I omitted the oil completely to save on calories and added a little red pepper flakes and a couple of fresh sun dried tomatoes to the mix.  I used it as a sauce base on a piece of flatbread and then added roasted cherry tomatoes and had a delicious pizza! Thank you for sharing.

What a wonderful way to make pesto! The peas really add body to the sauce without the need for a lot of oil. I love peas and I love pesto; this is a great combination of the two. The recipe is wonderful as listed (perhaps with some salt), but I also look forward to experimenting with it: more lemon, more herbs, a little heat.

This was exceptional!  I looked at others' comments & decided to add about a 1/4 cup of walnuts & another Tbs of olive oil.  It was delicious & my normally very picky eater ate 3 helpings!

I was thrilled to find this recipe - I've always made pesto with spinach to boost the nutritional value for my preschooler, but I was low on fresh basil and had no spinach in the house.   As luck would have it, I happened to have a  bag peas that had been hanging out in the back of the freezer for months.  I tried the recipe as written and it was excellent.  I decided to tweak it to the "gusto" of my family, and I added a little more olive oil, red pepper flakes and salt.  My 3-year old just ate 3 spoonfuls right out of the food processor and he LOVED it!  This may become our basic pesto recipe from now on!!

This was really yummy!  Definately needs salt, and I added a couple of splashes of hot sauce to an extra kick.  Will make again!

I LOVE this recipe!!!! It was absolutely delicious and healthy! I reduced the oil and subbed dried basil for fresh because I didn't have any. Will definitely be making again! Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I am not a fan of peas, but I definitely enjoyed making and devouring this recipe. I did not have all the ingredients on hand, but the substitutions I made did not affect the taste at all! Basically, I used Canned Sweet Peas, instead of Frozen Peas and Dried Basil instead of fresh and no lemon juice. Still Amazing. Anybody else should definitely go with the true ingredients since I just didn't have the time to get anything. Finally, Thank you for sharing your flexible recipe!

This is a great way to use up some of those nearly forgotten frozen peas which are sitting in the back of your freezer.  I added extra garlic and olive oil and tossed the pesto with chicken and served it over angel hair pasta.  It makes a good spread over french bread too!  Oh, I threw in about two tablespoons of pine nuts when I blended the ingredients together.

Tasty but the peas are fairly noticeable. I added almost a cup of fresh basil to improve the flavor. Very appropriate for spring.

This is very, very good and I shared it with vegetarian family and friends.  I did add extra lemon juice and more olive oil and also about 1/4 cup of warm water.  A wee bit of salt too.  Thank you very much for the recipe cookinBe.  BJ

Used entire bag of peas, tons of basil from our garden, walnuts, cracked black pepper. Froze it in ice cube trays. Stored frozen for months great! 1-2 ice cube "pesto" cubes on top of Chicken Breast baked great. Love this to come home and have a fast dinner (with healthy uncooked peas & basil). Thanks for the inspiration for our tiny tweak.

I thought it was OK...never met a pesto I didn't like. I find it more unique to use spinach in lieu of basil (unless I'm making traditional pesto). I like more Parmesan and need some toasted almonds (or pine nuts, though again, they go in regular basil pesto) that have been blended, mixing them in w/ half or more of the peas, reserving some intact ones for texture.

I enjoyed this fresh twist on standard basil pesto. I used a cup of fresh snow & snap pea pods from my garden (instead of frozen) and blanched them in the water I was boiling for pasta. I added an extra Tbs of parm & a little extra lemon juice. Tasty!

I'd give this 4.5 stars really, and what's the best about it is that it's great for vegetarians to get more protein easily.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, adding about 2 tablespoons more fresh parmeson, a little salt, lots of pepper, and an extra clove of garlic.  It was still very mild - could use more of your choosing (salt, garlic, lemon, pepper etc.).  I like that it was mild because I made this for 3 people and we had lots of thick pea pesto sauce, so got some decent protein in!  I served this with pasta and zucchini, and would add even more veggies next time (like broccoli, asparagus or spinach - maybe even blend the spinach in the sauce).  To get more protein, I made a salad with garbanzo beans (you could also try kidney), lettuce, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and red cabbage.  Extremely filling dinner that I surely will make again!

Fabulous! Followed recipe exactly with the exception of using dried basil and adding salt. (My basil is only now coming up.) I'll be making this often.
