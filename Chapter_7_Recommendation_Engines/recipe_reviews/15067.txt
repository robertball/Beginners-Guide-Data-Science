Here are few tips that I learn from doing that recipe. First, I tripled most of the recipe, except for the topping. I baked it into big rectangular corning ware dish (about 16" x 9). I added a touch of almond extract. It gives it a nice taste. When baked, I topped it with a touch of icing sugar. It looked great. DO NOT over cook. I baked them for 30-35 minutes. These squares are better when they are moist. Do as the recipe says. Do not use a toothpick to judge if bake or not as it will come out as if it was not baked. Hope this help!

I took these to work and everyone loved them! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9X13 pan instead so they were thicker, more like cake. I also used less brown sugar than it called for (because I ran out) and substituted with extra white sugar, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. It turned out great! The only thing I would do differently--if doubling the recipe in one pan again, I wouldn't double the cinnamon sugar topping because there was way too much. I used it all and when the bars were picked up, tons fell off---mostly sugar, leaving a VERY strong cinnamon taste, probably more than many people would want.

Just made these this afternoon and the kids had already eaten half the pan before the bars finished cooling!  These are really tasty.  I doubled the recipe (but I cut down BOTH sugars to approx. 3/4c each) and increased the apples to 2 large chopped apples (just over 2c).  Left out the nuts.  The bars were still sweet enough and don't require any frosting (although the caramel drizzle one reviewer suggested would be delish).  Did not double the cinn/sugar topping.  Baked in 9x13 pan for 33 minutes.  My daughter said to save this recipe and we'll definitely make again soon!

I didn't try these so I have to write this review based on Hubs' report. He said these were the kind of thing he could eat till he got sick on they were that good. Five stars, he said, and better than his all-time favorite butterscotch cookies. Wow! I used Granny Smith apple, left out the nuts at his request and glazed them (right on top of the cinnamon sugar topping) with a butterscotch glaze I kind of just threw together as an experiment: 2 T. each of butter, brown sugar and cream, boiled for a couple of minutes, added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla, then more cream and powdered sugar till desired consistency.  These are chewy, subtley cinnamony and appley with a butterscotch finish (his words, not mine). Definitely a make again!

I made this recipe 3 times in the last couple of days.  I had bought apples in bulk and needed to use them.  I made 2 recipes with a 9x9 pan, cutting both sugars down to less than 1/2 cup each.  The first time, I used 1 cup of apples but the next time, I used 1 1/2 full apples and I liked it better with more apples.  With more apples, the squares are more moist and cakey.  I also made a batch in a 9x13 pan -- I doubled the recipe, used 3/4 cup of each sugar, used 2 1/2 full apples, and baked for 33 minutes.  No need to double the sugar topping.  Delicious!  And I had all the ingredients in my pantry already.  This is going to be one of my favorite recipes.

I have to say that with a little bit of this and a little less of that. This was the most incredible apple cake we have ever had. My husband who is very picky couldn't stop talking about it. He said it kicked but!!!! I added 2 cups of apples and only a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added a 1/4 cup of apple juice. It was so moist it melted in your mouth. I also made a creamcheese topping to spread on top. OH MY GOSH!!!!
You can get the creamcheese topping from this website as well.

I have made these several times now and thought that it was about time that I put my review in.  These are wonderful!! Everytime that I make them they disappear quickly.  I use 1 and a 1/2 times the recipe and bake in a 13'X 9' pan. Then I put a carmel glaze drizzled over the top. Just put powdered sugar (about 1/2 to 3/4 Cup)in a small bowl with enough milk to make a semi-thin glaze and stir a couple of tablespoonsfull of the carmel used for dipping apples etc.(Found in the produce section of your market). Drizzle over the top.

Love this basis of this recipie but I did tweek it the second time.  I made the first batch exactly as specified and would rate it a 3.5, mainly because it was too sugary for me and not enough apples.   Second batch was  5 stars, here's what i did: I doubled most of the ingredients and used 5 nice size apples (about 2 1/2 cups) and added 1/2 cup apple juice.  I also cut down on the sugar, using just 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white.  It turned out less sugary, moist and delicious!  The second time I didn't even finish by sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar on top - the family didn't even notice!  They've been begging for more apple brownies ever since.

Really moist and gooey.  I doubled the recipe too, except for the sugar and cinnamon topping. For the sugar, I used only 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Next time, I think I'll add about 1/2 cup apple juice for more apple flavor and tang.  I will also use Granny Smith and double the apples. I used a braeburn apple this time and the flavor was too flat.  I doubled the recipe but still used a 9x9 dish and baked exactly 40 min.  Like a gooey coffee cake. Just make sure to cool completely before cutting since the cake is so moist.  Will make again.  (I gave only 4 star since it wasn't 100% perfect. Doubling the apples is a must!)

Moist and chewy just like brownies!  So yummy and easy to make that I baked these two days in a row for both daughters' school apple festivals.  Used 1 whole apple (1 cup diced).  Before serving, dusted with powdered sugar to make it look more attractive.  Brought home empty plates both nights!

These were so GOOD.  They didn't last very long at the school surprise that I made them for.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were great.  We did make small portions and they were very sweet....but really great.  Thanks for a new treat.

I wish I would have doubled the batter recipe, not the cinnamon and sugar topping quantity.  This was a tease! If you are going to try this, double it. Don't double the cinnamon and sugar topping. I used 1 teas cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of white and brown sugar for the topping. I baked it for 35 mins til bars sprung back when touched. I noticed the squares were crumbly, it was a little salty and dry--------Mar 07th, 2011. I made these again last night. I doubled the recipe this time. I accidentally added baking soda instead of baking powder. I left the soda in and added baking powder too, so 1 teas of soda and 1 teas powder. I think it was a good mistake. I added 2 full cups of chopped apples and squeezed a wedge of lemon over them. I didn't need to double the topping amount by last experience. I baked it for about 55 mins in my small oven. It was hard to let it cool, it smelled so good. The first bite was heaven and it got better from there. It was crunchy on the outside and soft and apple-y on the inside, melts in your mouth delight. My family couldn't stop eating. This is the best apple/cake/squares ever. It was all gone in less than 24 hours. When I woke up at midnight, there were 6 pieces out of 12 left, went back to bed. Woke up again at 8am, 4 pieces left. After work NONE left. Lol... This is one of my favorite recipes now, thank you for sharing. It was OK the first time but irresistible the second time. It gets better and better!

I took these to our church picnic yesterday.  I hadn't even tasted them yet, so imagine my surprise when they won the best overall dessert prize!  Following other suggestions, I doubled the recipe and baked for 33 minutes in a 9x13. I used closer to 2c apples, about 2/3c of each sugar, and the original amount of cinnamon sugar topping. Husband's not even an apple fan and asked me to make these again soon!

Heavenly. I followed some users advices, and done some changes of my own: 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 ts cinnamon for the topping, double the whole recipe because it serves only 12 very small squares, unless you're doing it for 2 people only :). it's taste is even better the next day. I've used a fruit dip recipe (this site) to make diagonal lines over the squares, for the amount mentioned above (original recipe) just mix 4 ounce of cream cheese, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and pipe it on the squares diagonally (cut the squares before you put the topping). Hope this will help you, it did for me :)

The taste was fine, although I found it too doughy, it baked longer then stated  and the out-side became crispy with a gooey raw center.  Also, I didn't like the topping, it just fell off.  I could not cut these into neat squares as they fell apart and would not hold any shape.  Im sorry that these did not turn out for me.

Although I was a bit concerned about making these squares they turned out great.  And they smell wonderful.  I would not recommend freezing them though as they get soggy and look bad (although still taste OK).

These are delicious! I went apple picking and was searching for a non-pie apple recipe. This is a very quick, tasty dish. I made it for my husband to bring to a tailgating party and it got rave reviews. I made another one with the leftover apples I had towards the end of my apple supply. I added much more apples than the recipe calls for. I used 6 small empire apples. I also topped it with 1 Tbspn of brown sugar and 1 Tbspn of white sugar instead of all white sugar. There is a bit too much of the sugar topping. The first time I made it I put it all on top and the result was a lot of loose sugar on top when you bite into them. The second time I made them I only sprinkled a little to cover and threw the rest out. Next time I make them I will drizzle a little melted butter over the top too in order to solidify the topping.

Like some other reviewers I doubled the recipe but left the cinnamon sprinkle topping the same.  i also added extra apples and reduced the sugar a bit.  Like everything else in food, it's all a matter of personal tastes!  Very nice, moist, snacking cake.  Next time I'll add even more apples!  Deelish!

5* for taste, 5* for ease of preparation, and 5* for absolute yummieness.  I had these puppies whipped up in 5 minutes and out of the oven in 28".  3 minutes later they were gone.  I mean scarfed.  Had to change up just a bit by changing sugar to Splenda (and cut down to about 1/4 cup eyeballed), and upped apple to 1 cup.  I was also out of butter and forced to use margarine, but incredibly that worked out fine as well.  I lined our pan with parchment paper and had no problems with them staying together.  A top notch recipe.  My family and I thank you!

Great recipe! I added a 1/2 cup of applesauce but otherwise kept the recipe exactly the same.  Tastes wonderful! Only thing I was missing was a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Great way to get rid of extra apples without to much fuss. Very moist and not to sweet. I did double the apples to 1 cup and reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup. I also added a streusel topping with 2 tbls chopped butter, 2 tbls flour, 5 tbls sugar and 1/2 tsp brown sugar. It added a nice crunch.

this is a very easy recipe to follow and my 6yr old was able to do it almost all on her own. I followed the directions minus the nuts and topping, I found it sweet and not very appleish. I added 3/4 cup of apple which was 1 full apple, next time I think I might shred an extra apple to make it more appleish, recude the sugar by half. This does mix up like a thick dough but the end result is like a brownie and with my alterations, more apples less sugar, it will be a healthy snack for my kids to bring to school. Thank you for sharing with us

Totally delicious and so simple! I wanted a fall apple recipe and this fit the bill! I made a few changes as others suggested: I added 1/4 c. of oats to the batter and used 1 cup of diced apples rather than only 1/2 cup. I also decreased the topping to only include 1 tbsp. white sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon. A total keeper! I can't wait to make these again.!

These were delicious everyone loved them.  A little too much cinnamon sugar had to turn it over and shake off the excess after they cooked I would use half next time.

Doubled recipe for 9x13 pan. Used 2 1/2 c. Chopped apples and did not double sugar topping. Fabulous!

These were actually really very good - kind of like a cross between a cookie and a brownie, with a very crispy crust and a very chewy center.  I topped the bars with a light drizzle of maple glaze. I would leave off the cinnamon sugar 'streusel' which is a little redundant with this recipe, and go with a glaze instead, which also makes them look pretty. I would also double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan next time as they disappear quickly. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted amazing. The Flavor was wonderful. The second time I made it i decreased the amount of topping and substituted the butter for applesauce. It tasted even better than the first time!

These had a good chewy texture and were plenty moist but had no flavor.  They simply tasted sweet.  With just 1/2 cup of apples and a small amount of cinnamon there wasn't much flavor.

These are TO DIE for. Gooey and good. DO NOT overbake. 20 minutes was all I needed. I too doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan. 

Note: this is a very thick batter and I was sure something was missing when I spread it in the pan. It wasn't easy to spread. But leave it alone, it is perfect! 

I am going to serve this topped with a caramel drizzle and a scoop of vanilla ice cream or real whipped cream. Delicious!

I tripled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan, used apple butter for the butter, halved the sugar and used half whole wheat flour. I had a bag of caramel bits which I used instead of the nuts due to allergies and I skipped the topping since I didn't want the added sugar. My son's hockey team really enjoyed them. Took 40 minutes to bake.

LOVED these!!!  I did double the apples and reduced the sugar slightly, but I think that they would still be delicious as written.  Modify sweetness and fruit content to your liking -- you can't go wrong.  I love using fresh fruits in easy-to-prepare desserts, so this one is a keeper!  Made these to send home with family who were visiting from out of town and the Hubster was so sad to see the apple squares go!  So I'll have to make him another batch.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I have made this recipe 3 times now.. and we love it!  The first time, it was undercooked.. the middle was doughy.  The second time, it was overcooked and the sides were quite hard.  The third time.. it was PERFECT!  It was a huge hit and everyone was raving about!   Pay attention to the time that the apple squares are in the oven.. it is very very important.  I did double the recipe and the only thing I changed.. omitted the nuts (not a nut fan) and tripled the apples - used Gala apples.  Chopped up the apples a pretty fine size.  Made the apple squares so good.  Also, dont need as much cinnamon / sugar on top as the recipe called for. Definite keeper.. will make this recipe over and over again - soo incredibly good!

I don't think I've ever been more pleased with a new recipe!  I used whole wheat flour instead of regular ~ because that's all I use ~ and doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 inch cake pan, as others have.  I have a 16 year old son who's IMPOSSIBLE and won't eat nuts in anything, so I decided to forgo the walnuts and added extra apple ~ for the doubled recipe, I used 1 and 1/2 cups Fuji apples (GREAT this year here in MI).  I was also out of cinnamon, so I used 1/8 teaspoon cloves and 1/2 teaspoon ginger instead. And I used just a tablespoon of white sugar with a couple of pinches of cloves and ginger sprinkled on top before baking.  WOW! My son LOVES it!  I LOVE it! When you can tweak a recipe and have the result turn out amazingly, the recipe in itself is great.  This is great!

Amazingly soft and tasty easy to make treats. What a great way to use some extra apples. Instead of the streusel topping, I blended some cream cheese, touch of brown sugar and some cinnamon and LIGHTLY spread some on the squares (after baked and cooled of course)... tasted like an apple cinnamon cheesecake! DEE-LISH!!!

These were fantastic! -- but with a few modifications.  I took the advice of many and doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I also cut down on the sugar and was so glad that I did.  I used 3/4 of a cup of each sugar for a double recipe and it was plenty sweet. I also upped the apples and used 2 very large apples (I used Jonagold - it's a sweet apple).  I also added at least a 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon and a whole tsp. more vanilla. As for the topping, you definitely don't need to double it because there is still plenty!  This cake was soooo moist.  I baked it 33 minutes at 350 and it was perfect. I brought this to a function and it was the star of the night.  :)

Sooo good!! Omitted nuts ....and I think that 2 tspns of cinnamon to 2 tblspns sugar is wayyyyy off. I added 1 tsp to the 2 tblspns sugar and it was more than enough.....I love cinnamon, but it can be potent....other than that...these bars were delicious....used a whole Cortland apple...very fine dice. Great bar recipe. Thanks!

Doubled the ingredients, using a heaping 2 cups of apples. For the topping I used just 1 Tblsp. sugar and 1 Tblsp. cinnamon which made enough. Baked in a 13x9x2 pan in my toaster oven for 30 minutes. Very moist and tasty. Nice warmed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Will be making this again.

I used one whole green tart apple, it was probably the size of a softball.  I did not peel it, just cored and diced into the batter.  I'm sure it was more than 1/2 c of apple.  The batter was made as is except reducing the white sugar to 1/4 c since most reviewers said it was too sweet.  I added a small amount of nutmeg too.  The batter was very thick when trying to add in the apples so I added about 1 T of apple juice.  The topping seemed heavy on cinnamon so I only used 1/2 t.  The squares were very delicious.  I will make again.  I really think you need to use sour apples for this or it would be entirely too sweet.

Very good.  I followed a few of the suggestions by other reviewers - cut down slightly on the sugars, doubled the chopped apple, reduced the suger/cinnamon topping and drizzled with carmel apple dipping sauce after it's cooked.  Yum.  Next time I might try a crumb type topping or a cream cheese topping but I will definately be making this again soon!
**Update - made it a second time & doubled the recipe but still used the 9x9 pan.  Used 1 1/2 c Granny Smith apples rather than Gala like I did the first time & added a dash of almond extract.  I also used pecans this time while the first time I omitted the nuts.  Even better than the first time!  Family loved it and I will be making it this way at their request often!

These turned out great!  I used frozen pears, 1/2 whole wheat with 1/2 all-purpose flour and  half the amount of butter with 2 tb. applesauce.  Then, sprinkled the top with quick oats instead of more sugar because I'm using these for breakfast in the morning, if they make it that long!

Loved these! Highly recommend. Definitely eat them while they're hot out of the oven w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dash of cinnamon on top. So buttery, chewy, sweet, and a bit crispy on top. Just plain yummy.

Excellent recipe. My husband and I loved it. Made as directed. However, next time I would add more apples and cut down on the sugar. I don't think it needed as much as it called for.

My husband and his hunting partners have thoroughly enjoyed this treat.  As with many other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9X13 pan.  I used 1.5 cups sugar total in the double recipe and 2 cups apple total.  These are a great cross between a bar and a coffee cake.

These are quite reminiscent of blonde brownies just with apples in them instead of chocolate.  Same texture and similar flavor.  Very sweet, I think next time I will cut the sugar down just a little but I will be making these again. I served them topped with sugar-free caramel ice cream topping and a dollop of light whipped cream.   They were delicious!

Excellent.. doubled recipe per suggestions and just sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on the top and didn't measure it.. probably used less than stated.. only used 3/4 cup of each of the sugars (doubled recipe) and used 2 full granny smith apples which was probably 2 cups. Also added raisins b/c I love love love them and about 3 tblspns or so of apple juice.

Totally delicious and moist! I added about double the cinnamon to the batter, and for the crumble on top I mixed the cinnamon with brown sugar instead of white, which made it like a streusal. I grated the apple instead of chopping, and added about 50% more. I also used whole wheat in a 1:1 substitute for white, which was not noticeable in this recipe at all. These are great for grabbing for breakfast in the morning in the way to class, and my roommate and I ate them all in a few days!

I've had many Apple Square recipes over the years, but this is, by far, the best. I only made the 9x9 size pan  because ithere's just the 2 of us and having a 9x12 pan of them would be dangerous. I made no changes... just made it exactly as the recipe said and they turned out great. My husband ate 1/2 the pan and would have eaten more if I would have let him. As he said... all he needed was an ice cold glass of milk.  Enjoy!!!

These bars have a pleasant flavour however, I would reduce the cinnamon to half the amount as is overpowers the bar flavour.

These bars are so moist and full of flavor - I made them for breakfast.  However, they were so wonderful - I had them for lunch and supper dessert as well!

Well,  must say first off that I failed when making this recipe. To start off with I didn't have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8x8. (That was mistake number one.) I didn't have brown sugar, so I used a cup of white. (That actually worked)I mixed it all as instructed and baked it. It came out looking great! (Apart from the fact that the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top just looked like raw cinnamon and sugar on top.)The middle sunk a little after cooling.So this is where my fail actually takes place. I envisioned a nice bubbly crust on top, kinda like you might see on a nice creme brule (sp?) Well not having a food grade blow torch I turn on the broiler and set the apple bars in. I stood there knowing it shouldn't take long. After a few minutes I open the oven to find FLAMES!!! I snatch out the flaming apple goodness and blow it out FAST. I stand there staring at what looks like a charcoal briquet. My heart has sunk to my toes. I decide to try and pick off the scorched top and was happy to find it was just the cinnamon/sugar mixture that was ruined!! The rest just turned out to taste like a nice moist apple cake. It tasted really good! If not for my total failure it may have just tasted great! I think I will try this recipe again without catching it on fire.

Just made and tasted these and i have to say these reviewers are not lying! Absolutely delicious, kind of like a cinnamon apple brownie! I did only make the single recipe unlike the suggestions of doubling it, because i would have eaten it all on my own. The only changes i made were using earth balance butter substitute instead of butter (only because it was all i had) and added probably closer to 2/3 cup of apple chunks instead of the 1/2 cup. I think the pan size i used was slightly smaller too, maybe an 8x8, id say perfect size

I doubled the mixed in apples and covered with thinly sliced apples on top before sprinkling with cinnamon sugar. Took about 40 mins to bake. I was afraid they would fall apart but they came out perfectly, super moist with a lot of Apple and minimal cake. I am counting these as a healthy snack :)

This was awesome! It was cakey but light and flavorful. I did add a dash of nutmeg and instead of 1 teaspoons vanilla, I added 9/10 teaspoon vanilla and 1/10 almond extract. It wasn't overpowering. Other thank those two minor changes, I didn't change a thing and wouldn't either. I'll be making this regularly.

These are fantastic! I doubled the recipe and used pecans because that's what I had on hand and the rest I kept the same. I used two large Granny Smith apples. I think I might drizzle caramel sauce on them next time for the topping, but these are perfect as is. Everyone loved them, thanks for the great recipe!

Once again I hade no walnuts, so I replaced the nuts with apple, doubling the apple amount.  Despite this add of freshness, me and my hubbie still found this recipe far too sweet and sticky. I will maybe make this again for a kids birthday, but definitely not for us.

I found them to be very good.  We have so many apples from apple picking and I was getting tired of making pie and had to try something new.   I've tried making apple cake before and was really disappointed so I didn't have high expectations when I made this...but it blew me away and I enjoyed it.  They're like apple brownies with a nice chewy texture.   I followed what one reviewer said about not testing it for "doneness" by inserting a toothpick but just cooked it for the time the recipe required. I also didn't have walnuts so I had use peacans.  And after putting the batter in the pan I lightly sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top. Oh, and I added a bit more than a 1/2 cup of apple...almost used 1 cup just because I really need to get rid of the apples and I'm glad I did because every bite has apple in it.  Yummy.  I was giving them five stars but my husband didn't care for them and other family members agreed that they were just "okay" but nothing to rave about.  So I took a star off.  I'll probably try these again when I have too many apples at home.

I upped the apple to almost 1 1/2 cups, used Splenda for the sugar and omitted the nuts.  Made them in a 9x9 pan and baked them for exactly 30 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Great flavor and I will make them again.  Will probably up the cinnamon next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe, however I did not have an apple in the house but I had zucchini (boy do I have Zucchini) so I peeled a smaller one, grated it, squeezed it dry and put in about 3/4 c. Took 10 min longer to bake but WOW! I grated it so my husband will eat it and not guess that it has zucchini in it.

tastes great!  I did as other reviewers suggested - increased apple and decreased sugars. For the topping, I also cut the cinnamon in half.  I also added about 1 T. of brown sugar.  It made a great topping!

I cut the sugar in the cake part by ¼ cup, used at least 1 ½ cups of thinly sliced apples, didn’t use the nuts (although they would have been delish) and cut the cinn/sugar topping in half.  Good and easy dessert for a fall evening.

The 1st time I made this I used an 8" square pan.  They turned out 'gushy' but we ate them warm with vanilla ice cream. The second time in a 9" pan I only used 1/2 the cinnamon sugar topping, because it seemed too much.  They were great, very tasty and good texture. I decided to try them a 3rd time with the full amount of topping so I could fairly review this recipe. They turned out very well, but I don't think that there was any benefit to the additional cinnamon sugar. This recipe makes a square with the texture like a brownie.  Adding more apples would change that.  Also, if you double the recipe , it should be baked in a 10"x15" pan rather than a 9"x13" as it's closer in square inches. I just made my double batch in 2- 9" square pans. They were a big hit. I used a Granny Smith apple.

These were great! Made a few changes- I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. Used 2 medium sized Granny Smith apples. I made a struesel topping (flour, cinnamon, sugar, and cut in the butter) instead of the cinnamon/sugar mix. baked for 32 minutes, came out perfect! Tasted like an apple coffee cake. This will be a regular recipe for me!

Yum!  Texture reminded me of coffee cake. Made as is except I used pecans instead of walnuts and added a couple of splashes of apple cider.  I also used closer to 3/4 cup of apples which seemed like the perfect amount.  30 minutes was also the perfect amount of baking time as mine came out perfectly.  I think I'll make them again and next time will add a bit less cinnamon sugar on top and will drizzle with caramel or cream cheese frosting!

YUUUUUMMY!!!!! Quite tasty.  It took about twice the time to cook, but that's probably because my oven SUCKS!!!  But it smelled so,so good and tasts great, i'm eating some right now.  I wanted a crumble top so I sprinkled about 2- 2 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar and about 1- 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon, this may be too much for some, but I don't think it was overwhelming.  I also pureed the apple in my proccessor so it was like apple sauce instead of having peices in the bake.  It spread around the apple flavor better.   Good recipe, thanks.

My advice when making this is to not measure the amount of apples, and to use 1 whole apple. This is a small recipe,so no wonder it doesn't last long.

These are great! I followed some other reviews and doubled the recipe, only using 3/4 cup of the sugars. I only had one egg, so I substituted the other egg with 1/4 cup applesauce. I had no walnuts, so I used raisins instead. I used an ice cream scoop to fill my muffin tin and baked for about 15 mins. Delicious!

was very yummy and good!!  I doubled the recipe like others suggested, cutting the sugars to 3/4 cups each.  Used two honeycrisp apples, so there was lots of apple in mine.  Added 1/4 cup of apple juice.  Just sprinkled the top with cinnamon/sugar from my cinnamon/sugar shaker.

Made this recipe for the first time earlier this week - I have now made it 3 times!! And doubled it the 2nd and 3rd time. Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly other than maybe a little more chopped apple than called for, and a little less cinn/sugar topping. Had some apples to use, and didn't feel like going thru all the work of apple pie, and didn't want apple crisp. This was SO quick and easy, and makes the house smell amazing! I will definitely be making this every fall for apple season! The first one I made I left out at room temperature, but the next time I refrigerated them when cooled and I liked them better a little chilled. Husband loved it, everyone at work loved it, and it was one of the first things to sell out at a bake sale today. This recipe is definitely a keeper - Thanks BarbiAnn!

Made this for dessert last night and everyone loved them!  Could not stop at one - these won't last long.  Followed suggestions by other viewers and doubled recipe for 9 x 13 pan, except used 3/4 c of each sugar rather than doubling sugar.  Do not double topping as single recipe of that was too much-I would halve the topping next time.  Thanks for a great recipe! It's a keeper!

I made a double batch in a 9' x 15" pan to take in for the teachers at my girls' school I used pecans because I found that's what I had on hand. They are really great. I'll make a pan for us to keep at home soon. These are very moist but firm enough to pick up and eat but I might use more apples when I make them for us. They are perfect as is, though. I don't mean that as a criticism. Thank you for sharing BarbiAnn!

I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of apples.  I made this recipe to use up apples that I had in the house.    Recipe was very good but like others said, I agree it was very sweet.  I must admit we haven't tasted them completely cooled yet.  They are awesome warm with ice cream.  I did not have walnuts in the house so I sprinkled sliced alonds on top 1/2 way through baking so they wouln't burn.  Will definitely make again, perhaps with less sugar.

Sweet and delicious. I doubled the amount of apple (seemed like a "must" after reading some reviews), used toasted walnuts, only used 1/2 C of white sugar (and some more to sprinkle at the end), and used half applesauce+half butter. I just mixed 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and skipped sprinkling part. The end result is sweet enough (at least for me and my family) and delicious. I might try adding dried cranberries or raisin next time.

These bars were absolutely delicious! Very simple fast to make. I would recommend baking them for only 20 minutes if your oven tends to be on the warmer side. I also added more apples (probably 3/4 C) but this kept the bars extra moist although a bit more crumbly. Next time I will definitely be doubling the recipe!!

Just made these and they are wonderful, not too sweet.  Only made one change, used rolled oats instead of nuts as the family does not like nuts., the oats added a nice chewiness.

This has become a breakfast staple in my house replacing pop-tarts and cereal bars. My girls also like to take them in their lunch for a treat. I triple the recipe, leave out the nuts and leave off the cinnamon/sugar topping. I bake in 2 9x13 pans and cut each pan into 18 bars. After they cool I layer them in an airtight container and freeze them. In the morning the girls heat them for 30 seconds in the microwave and they are wonderful. If they take one in their lunch it is thawed by lunch time. They are great to have on hand when the girls bring friends home too!

I thought this was awesome.  My kids also loved it.  I just changed the amount of apples and sugar a little.  I doubled the recipe and made two pans worth.  I made one with walnuts and one without cause my kids don't like walnuts.  Instead of doubling everything, this is how I changed it.  I used 1.5 cups of apples and 3/4 cup of each of the brown and white sugar.  So basically more apples and less sugar.  For the topping I didn't double it and it was more than enough.  Loved this and will make it again for sure.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good with a few changes, double or triple the apples to 1 to 1 1/2 cups, I added 3 tablespoons of apple cider & I added a dash of allspice. The first time I made it I followed the directions and you couldn't taste the apples, it tasted like snickerdoodle bars. While very good and they went fast it wasn't the apple taste I was going for.  The second time I made it with the changes I listed above and it was much improved.

These really are good. Read most of the reviews, I did not double the recipe, but I did make some changes. I used 2 cups of apples, and I only used 1/4 white sugar.Could probably use only 1/4 cup of brown sugar too. They are sweet, so I would not use more sugar. I also drizzled with a little powdered sugar and milk mixture. These were delish, and I will be making them again

I doubled the recipe and used margarine instead of butter and didn't use walnuts. I used 1 T. of brown sugar, 1 T. of white sugar, 1/2 tsp.of cinnamon and 4 T. of finely chopped pecans for the topping. Baked 25 mintues at 350, turned the oven off and left the pan in the oven for an additional 5 minutes. Drizzled with a simple galze of melted margarine, milk, vanilla & powdered sugar. Very nice texture, moist and tasty

This recipe was wonderful!  I tasty way to use extra apples.  I am only giving this 4 stars because I made two batches of these and both were a little dry for my taste.  My first batch I followed the recipe exactly, and those were considerably more moist than the second batch.  On my second batch I did not have any nuts in the house, so I substituted the same amount of old-fashioned oats in its place.  And I drizzled some honey over the top before baking in addition to the cinnamon and sugar.  Those bars were more cake-like and much more dry.  I ended up glazing both batches with a simple powdered sugar glaze to moisten them up.  They were delicious!  I will be making these again, that's for sure!

The flavor of these bars were great but no matter how long we cooked them they were somewhat doughy and fell apart when we tried to cut & serve them.

At first I wasn't sure....but once I put one in my mouth it just melted. Took advice of others and doubled the recipe. Just sprinkled the white sugar and cinnamon on top rather than measuring out. Filled a 9x9 pan perfect. Will try a "low-fat" version next time.

I doubled the apple, used granny smith.  I omitted the sugar cinnamon mixutre for the top as it would have been too sweet.

This was more like an apple walnut blondie than it was a cake, had a nice chewy texture to it...didnt last one day in my house.

these are great! everyone in my house loved them. i used a 8x8" pan so i had to bake them a tad longer. i also doubled the apples, halved the sugar/cinnamon topping and made the vanilla glaze from this site. i will be making these again and again!

Made as directed except did not use all of the cinnamon/sugar mixture to put on top that it called for, probably used 2/3 of what I had mixed up.  Probably would have liked them fine w/o it on there at all.  These are delicious! I made a pan to donate to a church function, will make another one so we can have some at home to eat.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, except added an extra 1/2 c. of apples.  It was delicious!  I will make this again and again.  Next time will double recipe as it didn't last long.

Loved this recipe.  I cooked it for 25 minutes.  They were moist and tender with great apple/cinnamon flavour.  I used one granny smith apple which I chopped finely.  The recipe was perfect the way it was written.  Next time I will certainly double the recipe so we have some to enjoy the next day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Simple recipe and absolutely delicious. I added a simple glaze first (1 cup powdered sugar and approx. 1 tsp milk (adding more as needed and eyeballing for a thicker consistency)) and then sprinkled on cinnamon-sugar. Beautiful and moist. They make the house smell amazing!!! lol Yum!

AWESOME!!!!!  I cannot express how much I loved the end result.  I was skeptical after mixing everything together as it was clumpy but during the baking process, I observed the mixture smoothing out and rising.  I, too, doubled the recipe but not the topping as there was plenty already.  I couldn't keep my hands off of these things!!!

I love this recipe! I used 1 1/2 apples and it made it really moist and gooey. Perfect if you put ice cream on top. The cinnamon sugar makes a lot so I only used half. Everyone loved it :)

These are absolutely the best thing ever. I can't believe how good they are! I accidently used a stick of marg, so mine came out very moist. I used pecans and it was incredible! I really can't believe how good they are. This will be my standard coffee cake recipe from now on. I'm going to try it without the apples and make a crumb nut topping next week.

I made a lot of changes, but the base-recipe was so good I still felt it deserved a high rating.  I used 3/4 cup white spelt flour and 1/4 cup oats in place of the full 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup melted Smart Balance Light in place of the butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar plus 3 packets of stevia (no white sugar was necessary!), 1/2 tsp. cinammon in place of 1/4, pecans instead of apples and an entire large apple in place of the 1/2 cup.  I also added 1/4 cup all natural apple juice to the batter and drizzled a dairy-free caramel-sauce over the top (omitted the specified sugar and cinnamon at the end).  I baked it for the specified time in a standard tart-pan, and it was incredible--easily the best apple-dessert I've ever served.  Thank you so much for the great base to work with!

baked in a 8x8 pan because I didnt have a 9x9  turned out great. Moist and chewy good!! I had apple that was ready to be eaten and thought I would see if i could find a quick easy recipe to use it in. THIS IS IT! I do think the topping is a bit excessive probably next time I make them I will cut the topping down to maybe half.

This is basically an apple cake.  I don't know what I expected - maybe more of a bar.  Has a good, rich flavor and the cinnamon sugar on top is good.  I felt like they were missing something even with that, tho, so I made the caramel-icing recipe and drizzled it all over the top and that was what really hit the jackpot.  I used less powered sugar in the icing (1.5 cups) to make it less thick.

I'm giving this recipe five stars but i had some difficulty with cooking time when following suggestions from others to double the recipe and cook in a 9x13 pan. I baked for 45 minutes and the bars were raw in the middle. The flavor is fantastic and the edges were great but next time i will follow the recipe as written.

AMAZING! I also doubled the batter and increased the apples to 2 1/2 cups to fit in a 9x13 pan. Absolutely delicious recipe for the fall. I will probably make these several more times before the season is over!

these are absolutely delicious! the only thing is DON'T over-bake. it completely changes the taste and consistency. these are much better on the gooey side! made these for family members who were in town visiting (and all of whom were on diets) and they gobbled these up so fast! they're irresistible... esp if you're partial to apples and walnuts.

These are great!  1/2 cup of packed brown sugar is enough. No need for the 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Also, 1 tbsp of white sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon is plenty for the topping.

After reading some of the other reviews, i decided to use granny smith apples to help cut the sweetness.  I added almost 1 cup of chopped apple (half of the granny smith), an extra T of butter to the sugar and cooked for 25 min.  I also only used 1 T of sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for the topping.  These are delicious and with the granny smiths, they were just right as far as sweet!  (I would decrease the sugar if you aren't using a tart apple.)  Nice and moist with just enough cinnamon and crunch.  Will def add to my recipes!

I made this yesterday and it came out delicious! I didn't follow the mixing directions though, I was in a rush so I through everything in a blender ^_^. I didn't have any vanilla flavor left so I added just a little bit of almond milk. The batter came out creamy, the apples and walnuts were totally pulverized. Still tasted great! It reminds me of like a corn bread except appley and sweeter!    I would make this again. I might try it the directions way so I can crunch on the walnuts and taste the whole apple...or I might make it my way again. Worked great for me!

I agree with Irene who found the batter really thick like paste. I added some skim milk to it, and it thinned out perfectly. Instead of nuts, I used butterscotch chips which were yummy. For those trying to make this healthier, it worked fine with melted Promise Active spread.

A good recipe for a healthier snack/treat. I can see this being used as either a snack or dressed up for a dessert--drizzle some butterscotch or caramel sauce...a little whipped cream or vanilla ice cream...served with the apple square. Yum! It isn't QUITE a 5-star recipe, but great nonetheless. --I baked in 8x8 glass pyrex and it needed about 35 minutes.

I added two whole Granny Smith apples diced with my food processor (2.5 - 3 cups in the end) and halved the sugar. I think there is too much topping and might skip it the next time I make it.  I've made it twice now and the 2nd time I used applesauce instead of butter and half whole-wheat flour.  I thought it was great!  It is more like an apple snack cake, chewy and moist.  Good for breakfast too.

These were WAY better than I expected.  I love it when that happens.  I omitted the nuts and added a little more cinnamon to the dough.  I also added about a cup of apples.  These are so tasty and festive in the fall.  I'm going to make them again tomorrow. I think I'll experiment with different toppings.  This will be a regular this time of year.

Update:  I made these again.  I made my apple chunks bigger this time and I liked it that way.  I also topped this with powdered sugar instead of the sugar/cinnamon mixture and I thought that was better.

Excellent recipe except for the amount of sugar.1 cup is way too much sugar and makes the cake very sweet. I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.
Overall loved the recipe:)

OH MY GOSH! These were SOOOOO good!! I'm afraid I may not have any left tomorrow! Everyone in the family, hubby kids and I, loved these! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the square bake dish so I used a 9" pie pan instead, and it turned out fine. I will definitely make this again and again! Goes great with a scoop of ice cream as well!

I doubled this recipe but kept the sugars at 3/4 cup each.  I replaced half the butter with applesauce and topped the bars with a streusal topping instead of cinnamon-sugar mixture (1 tablespoon flour, 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon--cut in 1 tablespoon butter cold butter and then add 4 tablespoons finely chopped pecans).

These were fantastic! Some changes I made were adding 1 tbs milk (because it seemed a little dry), oil instead of butter, and extra apples! turned out great! Though there is a little extra sugar topping, so lower it just a bit.

These were great - I double the recipe as suggested.  Next time though I will put more apples and cut down on the white sugar - but that is personal preference.  Maybe some raisins too.

This was a very good recipe. I probably won't put as much sugar on top as called for. Just because I want to atleast feel like it's healthy.:) I did add nutmeg to the recipe and it was really good. 
thank you..

These apple squares are delicious and so moist and full of flavor! They smelled so good cooking that we couldn't 
even wait until they cooled to try them~ they are GREAT warm with vanilla ice cream on top! I am sure they are great at 
room temperature, too,  but we ate them all while warm so I'll have to make another batch to find out =).

Wow, these just came out of the oven and they are good.  I love reading the other reviewer's tips and tweeks (Thank You!).  I decided I wanted thicker bars and more of them so I followed many of the reviwers suggestion to double the recipe, using a 9x13 pan, reducing sugars to 3/4 white, 3/4 brown and omitting the topping.  I also using a little over 2 cups of chopped apple (Cortland).  The recipe is fine without more sugar on top of it.  I will be making this again.  (next time I think I will add 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon to the cake batter for the 9X13 pan sized cake).

After reading a few reviews, I doubled recipe for a 9x13 pan, tripled the apples, kept the walnuts the same, cut the sugars by half, replaced 3/4 of the butter with applesauce, and used 1/4 of the topping. Absolutely delicious and the apple flavor shines through. The walnuts provide a crunchy compliment to the sweetness. The family loved it. Thank you!

I bake for seniors groups. I try to do something different every week. This week I choose these apple squares. I am sorry I did. I am on a diet and I had a tiny little piece and could have eaten the entire 9 x 13 pan. They are absolutely delicious and so easy to make. The ladies don't like nuts (dentures you know) and I didn't have any raisins to I added the last of my currants and it turned out great. Can hardly wait to see their reaction at tomorrow's meeting. I hope I managed to keep my hands off them until then. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe. Oh I took others advice, doubled the recipe, used only 1/2 c of brown sugar and 1/2 of Splendid and used 3 Pacific Rose apples with skin still on. Just sprinkled about 1.5 T of brown sugar on top and pressed it in so it wouldn't fall off. Forgot to mention also next time I would triple the recipe as they came out a little on the thin side and the 'girls' like a good mouthful.

Love it! I add a nice thick caramel topping and then drizzle a little icing usually. This time I made it plain. Love the recipe it's a favorite in my chocolate lover house so that's saying something :)

I doubled the recipe, only used 3/4c each of white and brown sugar as suggested by another review. Used 2cups apples and included the chopped walnuts. For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white which tastes delicious and does not fall off like another reviewer complained of. Baked for 30min. Thank you, can not wait for the family to try.

I took these to a party and got the "best treat" award by popular vote.  They were eaten up quickly!  I have made them again and will so so again!  I doubled the recipe and the first time I made them I did a white chocolate drizzle and a caramel drizzle.  I also doubled the amount of apples and used 2 different types of apples for a nice blend.  I like them with or without a drizzle but it looks wonderful on a party platter.

This is a good recipe.  I made it one day, 1 1/2 times the recipe in a 9 x 13" pan.  I backed the sugar up by about a third and halved the topping, all based on other people's reviews.  The result was good enough that we wanted more but seemed to be missing something, so I made another batch.  One and a half times the recipe in a 9" x 13" pan, with full bore sugar.  I used Honeycrisp apples, four of them, but otherwise followed the recipe, including the entire amount for the topping.  SUCH good food!  Lots of classic flavors here, especially when you put a square of it in a bowl and pour some cream in beside it.  Sometimes you just need all the sugar.  Thank you.

I have NO idea what went wrong!  I was afraid to overcook after reading several others info.  So, I baked for the longest time listed and promptly took out and left to cool completely.  When I cut into it, it was "swampy!"  I decided what the heck?  Put it back into a reheated oven and left it there for about 15 more minutes, burnt the top, (no surprise there) but the middle of this tasted o.k.  Which is the reason it got 2 stars...  I don't know if I'm going to commit to this recipe or not.  Maybe if I have a burning desire to fail again, I will try it.

Looking for something to do on a snowy day while my wife was out and saw this recipe.  My wife and I recently picked two bushels of Northern Spy apples and I was looking for a good apple recipe. I did not use the last two ingredients as I thought there was enough sugar in the recipe without the topping.  I followed the recipe but used a full large diced apple instead of a half cup.  Probable came to a full cup or slightly more as I didn't measure.  Also used a full cup of walnuts crunched in a plastic bag with a rolling pin.  This is a fantastic recipe.  Didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used a 7x11 pan figuring this was close enough to the 81 sq. in. pan.  Next time I make this I will double the recipe as we ate this to quickly.

Similar to other reviewers, I doubled the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. I increased the apples to 2 large chopped apples. I did not use the topping. Rather, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drizzled the warm cake with a caramel. Baked in 9x13 pan for 33 minutes. Delicioso!

I also doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 cake pan for slightly longer. I added pecans, which I had on hand and also added an extra cup of apples. Everyone loved these bars!

Excellent. I did not change anything, except less cinna/sugar mixture. I will try a bit less sugar and more apples next time (as other reviewers did), just because i dont think we need to eat all that sugar (although it tastes very good). Mine was done in 25 min. I do want to add you need to make sure you sift the flour first, and then measure 1 cup. It seemed by some reviews that maybe they weren't sifting first, saying they got a very thick dough. Its a thick batter, but not as thick as some describe.

This is excellent! I doubled the recipe like a previous review suggested, except the topping and the white and brown sugars- I only put in 3/4 of a cup of each instead of 1 cup of each. I also chopped the apples up quite small and added an extra 1/3 of a cup. The result was phenomenal and very moist. Didn't even notice I cut back the sugar. I bet it could even be cut down more. Great reviews of it in my house! This is a keeper.

I love these so much I've made them 3 times in the past two weeks. I used pumpkin pie spice since I was out of cinnamon and I don't put the sugar topping on. Without out it it's easy to grab a piece with your hand and eat it.

We absolutely loved this!! I've made it three times over the past week. I tripled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, added a splash of almond extract and made an oatmeal topping instead of cinnamon sugar. It's amazing either way we just like oatmeal on top. Also, I cut down both sugars by half and it was plenty sweet enough for us!

I had high hopes for these.  I followed the reviews, doubled for a 9x13 pan, reduced sugar, added more apples, didn't double the topping. It smelled wonderful but it was very dry.  I don't think I baked it too long because I thought the batter seemed dryish when I was spreading it in the pan.  My son-in-law thought they were great, and they did taste okay, but the texture was dry and crumbly. Will not make again.

Made it tonight for a Thanksgiving party. Really tasty! I love apples and this reminded me of a very similar recipe that my mom used to make. I doubled the recipe like most of the other reviewers, cut the sugar in half, used 4 gala apples, shredded instead of chopped(will increase to 5 next time) and I squeezed most of the juice out, also ground walnuts ,used baking soda instead of baking powder(always works better for me). Baked in a 9x13 dish and it came out very fluffy and not too sweet, more like apple bread(I like that!) skipped the sugar on top, only used cinnamon and after cooled and cut, I sprinkled vanilla powder sugar(home made for x-mas cookies). It's the only topping fine enough to stick, as I noticed some of the comments posted that sugar was falling off. Will make again:)

Talk about an easy recipe!  I thought the squares needed more apples so I used a whole cup of chopped instead of just a half cup---a wise decision.  I may use a bit more next time I bake these.  I also cut down on the amount of the sugars, as advised by previous reviewers.  Since I baked these in an 8 x 8 pan, I decreased the amount of cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the top and baked them for 10 minutes longer.  The sweetness of the squares was spot-on after making the sugar adjustment.  Absolutely delicious!  I will most certainly be baking these again.

Very good! I used oats instead of walnuts and made one-and-a-half times the recipe in a 9x13 pan - I think doubling it and using a 9x13 would also be good.

I doubled it and used a 9x13. It seems too small a recipe for a 9x9.

Looks like I am in the minority.  So disappointed and very carefully follwed recipe but cut back on sugar a little because otherwise too sweet for us.  Even added about 2 tbsp. of apple juice because the mixture seemed dry and doubled up on apples.   The end product still tasted doughy and dry and certainly not moist as I had hoped it would be.    Sorry but will not try again because many many more apple recipes out there.

SO great. Don't use the topping it calls for, make a crumble using brown sugar, melted butter, flour, vanilla, salt and cinnamon.

These were very good; slightly chewy and moist in the middle. I must say though, there was WAY too much sugar/cinnamon on the top. After they were done cooking the sugar/cinnamon mixture was still sitting on the top so I had to shake it all off. Even after doing that there was ample cinnamon flavour. I would recommend using 1/2 the topping mixture, or even less.

These bars were delicious!! I cut back on sugar a little bit because of so many reviews talking about how sweet they were. They turned out perfectly, although there was a little bit too much sugar on top of the bars. Overall, a great recipe!

Oh my gosh!  These are sooo good.  I followed other suggestions and cut the sugar by using the full measurement of brown sugar and omitting the white sugar.  I doubled the amount of apples too.  I drizzled the top with some butterscotch chips melted with a little heavy cream.  These did not last 24 hours at my house!  I'm making  more this weekend!

Followed the recipe to the dot and they came out PERFECT! (I used a 9x13 pan, because I don't have a 9x9, and doubled the recipe). Don't let the super dense batter discourage you, once in the oven and it starts baking, the juices from the apples will dissolve into the batter and make it super moist. One note I would like add is for the topping, next time i would cut the sugar and cinnamon. I had too much excess cinnamon/sugar on the top, I literally had to dump it out at the end of the baking. I would probably add in more apples.

So moist and delicious, made the recipe as is, except a bit more than half a cup of apples, more like 3/4.  I used one apple, and didn't want it to go to waste.  I baked it in a square silicon pan and it came out beautifully.  Yum!!!

these were very yummy! i found them to be a little thin. i think next time i would double the recipe and then still bake them in the same size pan.  i also doubled the cinnamon and was glad i did.  the cinnamon on top might have been too much though - not because of how it tasted, but because there was literally so much it didn't adhere to the top and was falling off all over the place when we were eating them.  but all in all these are super easy to make, and they really taste great!  we used braeburn apples. yum!

This is the best recipe for apple bars I could find.  I bake treats for the elderly at the nursing home I work at and they absolutely love these.  I double the amount of apple and bake them a little longer until a toothpick comes out clean but I have never had a complaint with these, everyone loves them!

These are wonderful! I followed one reviewers suggestion and doubled the recipe but not the cinnamon sugar topping.  Baked them in a 9 x 13 pan for about 45 minutes and served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  A HUGE hit at my house. Thanks for the great recipe.

SOOO good, it didn't last long in my kitchen, and there's just a few of us here! (on average, 4 or so)

I followed some of the other ppl's advice and cut some sugar out, added extra apple chunks and also some apple juice (about 1/2 cup).  Very moist, and sooo delicious!

Great recipe. Like others suggested, I doubled most of the ingredients, and used 2 cups of sliced apples. I also substituted the walnuts with hazelnuts. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 a cup and baked it in a 13 x 9 pan for 35 minutes. After they cooled I sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Everybody loved it.

5 stars for taste, but the 4 stars are because I just barely had enough batter to cover the bottom of my 8x8 pan (obviously smaller than the 9x9 called for in the recipe). 
Otherwise, very tasty. I cut back on the sugar maybe a 1/4 cup overall and did not use all the sugary topping. Would make again, but maybe triple to put in a 9x13 or do 1 1/2 times the recipe for the 8x8.

really liked the recipe it was very easy and quick. it is a sweet snack so if you want something with not too much sugar you could probably add a little less than called for. i really liked that this recipe has walnuts made it different from other apple snacks. some reviewers said to add ice cream to it when it comes out of the oven, i bet that tastes great!

Delicious! I took the suggestion of others and doubled the recipe to then bake in a 9x13 pan. I also put 4 cups of diced Granny Smith apples and put 1 whole tsp. of cinnamon in the batter and 1/4 cup of water because the batter was too thick in my opinion. I thought it would be too many apples, but when I tasted the squares they were perfect! Really great for school lunches. Will make again and again.

Fantastic!!  I doubled this recipe.  Our family doesn't like such sweet things so I doubled everything but the sugar.  Even with half the amount of sugar it was just wonderful.  I did add a bit of apple juice like another reviewer suggested. (1/4 cup).  I also made caramel sauce and drizzled that over so all of these things add to the sweetness of the cake.  That is why I only used one cup of sugar instead of 2 when doubling this recipe.  Either way you like it, the cake is super moist and just delicious!!  You must try it!

These were soooo delicious and perfect for using up extra apples in the fridge.  I quadrupled the apples (2 cups) and tripled almost everything else except the topping and the sugars (1 cup brown sugar, and 1 1/4 cup white sugar).  Baked in a 9x13in glass pan for 30 min.  They are so moist and delicious! My only recommendation would be to dice the apples.  I chopped mine into larger pieces and u dont get as much of the apple flavor throughout as if you would with diced apples, I will also try granny smiths sometime but whatever you have on hand will work perfectly!

If you are looking for something very yummy and easy to make look no further!!!!!! These bars are excellent. I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9X13 glass pan and it still didn't last long. Perfect recipe. I only made 2 changes, 1) doubled the recipe 2) added 2 cups of apples. They deserve 10 stars

These bars weren't bad, I had a hard time mixing the batter together though, it seemed like it was too dry to stir! Also, it is hard to get them cooked just right, the bars in the middle seem like they aren't done all the way through! I had to add at least double the apple, and it was unclear as to whether the apples should be sliced or diced or what. I ended up dicing the apple, and I used two eggs to try to make the batter easier to stir together. But taste-wise they are pretty good.

This rating is per my husband...in his words...if you made these twice a week it would not be enough! He loved them and the little piece i managed to get was very good, very moist. took a little longer to cook than the recipe said...but that could just be my oven or that i added a half cup more apples than it called for because i wanted to use up what i had. will definately be making in the future!

I have made this many times now and the pan almost never lasts more than a day in our house. I make it almost exactly as written except that I leave out the walnuts (allergies) and only put 1 t. cinnamon in the topping (just a matter of taste). This is definitely our new favourite fall treat. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Doubled the batter and also added double the apples to the doubled batter and did not put in any nuts. Baked for 33 minutes in the oven. Used a coarse cinnamon sugar grinder for the topping. Delish.

Super yummy!! I did however make some simple changes to this recipe. I added some home made maple syrup and some apple cranberry juice. I also cut out the nuts and more than doubled the apples. It turned out very moist and flavor rich!!

These squares are really good, they turn out like apple blondies. Because of reviews saying they were quite sweet, I used 1/2c brown sugar and omitted the white. They turned out fantastic and still quite sweet. They are super moist and dense. The nuts add a nice crunch.

So good, so moist, best way to use up some apples I picked from the orchard. I did triple the recipe for a 13x9 pan. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe try it with bananas!

I had high hopes for these but they were just average for us.  Made them as stated except I used twice the amount of apples and went a little skimpy when measuring  the sugars, as suggested by others.  They were really hard to spread in the pan and turned out pretty thin.  The topping was way too much and I even left some in the bowl because it looked like too much.  I did drizzle them with a basic powdered sugar icing (which added a nice touch).  I sent these to a potluck without trying them, based on the great reviews, and I am so regretful now.  With all the great bar recipes out there, I will definitely not be making these again.

These turned out so delicious! I made with the written amounts of sugars and these were very sweet. Personally I will cut each down to 1/4c in the future but that's a matter of preference; as written these are still yummy. I also used two chopped Gala apples, which came out to at least a cup and a half. This made a very fruity moist bar, which we loved. I would use half a cup if I needed a bar that was more resilient, with all the apple I used you couldn't really pick one up and munch it. The batter is stiff, I plopped it into the pan and had to use my fingers to spread it out. I look forward to making these all fall, thanks so much for sharing!

Mine turned out much less bar-like than any of the other photos, but I am really happy with them.  I double the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes.  It tastes a lot like apple pie.  The only other changes I made were that I omitted the nuts, and I reduced the topping to 3T and 3t of sugar and cinnamon.  Next time I think I'll sprinkle the top with half, and roll the apples in the other half.  Delicious - definitely a keeper!

UPDATE: I'm changing the rating from 4 to 5 because they tasted insanely better the next day. OLD REVIEW: These were really good! I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 2 in the topping. I think plumped raisins would also work really well in this recipe. Will add some in the next time I make this. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing, BarbiAnn!

Made as written except that I used twice as much apple and doubled the cinnamon.  Excellent recipe.  And so quick and easy.
I'll be making this again this coming week for a large seniors' group.

Love these!!! After reading all the negative reviews, I was kindda skeptical, BUT! It turned out PERFECT with: 1-) Triple recipe  2-) Use only 1 cup of brown sugar 3-) Increase to 4 Large apples cooked first with 1/2 lemon and 1/2 cup water for 10 min on boil so that the water evaporates a bit. 5-) Sprinkle with 2 Tbs sugar + 2 tsp ground cinnamon. LAST bake in 9x13 glass dish at 175C for 45min. MOIST but holding together :) I also tried it with 2 cup of AP flour + 1 cup of whole wheat flour and the consistency is even more brownie like PLUS more healthy! :)

Made these this morning and doubled the recipe so I could give some away.  The cinnamon sugar topping is a bit much, and it did not want to stick to the top of the squares, so I melted some butter and placed it on top of the cinnamon sugar mix so it would stick.  These tasted really great, but had a sort of gummy texture.  I think the texture is due to all the humidity in the air this morning.  Great recipe!!

Delicious!  I have seen this recipe quite a few times and finally broke down and made it.  Followed recipe and directions exactly with the exception of adding 1/2 cup more chopped Granny Smith apple.  The next time I make it I will add a scoop of vanilla ice cream along with a caramel sauce.  It's a keeper!

These are really good! Although, I think they would be more appropriately named (apple cinnamon brownies). They smelled wonderful baking to. I liked how easy they were to make and I only had to peel and chop one small apple. The only thing I changed was using whipped butter instead of stick to cut the saturated fat of the butter in half. However, there wasn't much in the recipe anyway. I will make these again. They will be very good in the fall.

Tasted good - though I should have read the reviews first. Will double the recipe and add more apple for moistness.

Just made these and they are AWESOME! Moist and chewy and sure to go over well at my party tonight (if they last that long!). I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan and increased the apples to 2 cups. I will definitely be making these again.

I was looking for an apple pie recipe but I came across this instead. I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. I don't like apples as a fruit alone but I do like it in sweet snacks and this sweet snack is really good. Didn't have high hopes for it but the reviews were great and it was easy so I gave it a try and I am glad I did. Didn't have any nuts so I just added a little more apples. I only had brown sugar and that is what I used. I also added some pineapple extract. Will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing

These are great, especially with vanilla ice cream!  I will probably double everything the next time (and add even more than double the apples) and bake in a bigger pan.  So good!

These are wonderful! I doubled everything except the topping as others suggested and used 3 apples ( 2 1/2) cups) as well as only using 1/2 cup of each sugar both times that i've made this.  It is really, really good! The healthy version of a brownie!!

These were very yummy, but (I can't believe I'M saying this) a wee bit too sweet for my liking. Next time I make them, I think I'll cut back on the sugar a teeny bit.

I made these for a get together with my friends yesterday and they were fantastic!!!

I didn't use nut because I didn't have any so I up the amount to about a cup (1 large granny smith). Once we tasted them we decide we would continue making them without the nuts. I also used an 8.5 X 11 pan because that's what I had.

I know some of the other reviews said the cinnamon sugar feel of the top of the bars. I avoided this by just gently patting the topping into the top of the bars before baking. I didn't reduce the topping amounts because we love cinnamon!!

I will make these again and again!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

Made this once yesterday and they didn't make it through the night. I made some more but I cut back on the sugar. I only used 1/4 cup each of the light brown and white sugars and doubled up on the chopped apple, putting in a whole cup, and it came out just as nice but not as sweet: perfect in my estimation. Moist, sweet and tart all in one little snack.

This is sort of like a soft bakery cinnamon roll.  Our family is not a cake loving family, but this was awesome!  As others have said-doubles well, spread with creme cheese icing and you have a cinnamon roll without the wait of raising yeast dough.  The apple bits in the center are just an added bonus-great recipe!

These bars turned out pretty good! They have a very delicate,sweet flavor. I only used 3/4 cup each brown and white sugars,and doubled the recipe. I baked in a 9x13 pan. I also used 3 apples chopped fine. Mine turned out moist,and fluffy. To me, the picture makes them look chewy,like a brownie,which I would have really enjoyed that texture,but all in all,these are great!!

These are really good.  I had to bake mine nearly 40 minutes to get the squares to set properly, but other than that... the recipe was great.

-It was very well rec'ved by my picky husband & that speaks volumes!!!  I did take people's advice & cut back on the amount of sugar.  I basically eliminated the white; just using the brwn sugar.  I doubled the recipe & baked it in a 9x13 ~ superb.  
-Next time I'll use the same amount of sugar, but half white & brwn.  It did taste great, but was on the darkish side. 
-I think I used 3 C apples.  I filled a 2C measure till the top & kept going!  I chopped the apples; next time I'll see what dicing it would do.
-I toasted the walnuts, then did a med-fine chop.  
--I have family members that can't have chocolate, so this is a great recipe to bring to get-togethers!
--Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe!  My hubby was happy to share it at work & I had enough to give to friends, too.  I'm definitely 
making this again!
--I gave it 5 stars 'cause it helped bring smiles!

delicious! will be making this over and over again. I doubled the recipe also, added 1/2 cup of apple juice, increased the apples to 3 cups, didn't double the sugar topping, decreased both sugars to 3/4 cup each, kept it in a 9x9 pan and cooked it for 40-45 minutes. Oh and drizzled caramel sauce over before serving :) yum

I made this tonight for the second time, and figured out what I did wrong the first time.
The first time I didn't sift the dry ingredients, and the squares turned out extremely gooey.  This time, I was sure to sift the dry ingredients, and they turned out AMAZING! Not gooey at all! (Still very moist though).
I also left out the nuts and doubled the apples.
Also, I used brown sugar and cinnamon on top, instead of white sugar. I thought the white sugar was a little too heavy last time.

Just made these! Absolutely amazing! I always read the reviews, and if there's something that seems to be consistent it them, I take it into consideration. So I only used 1/4 cup of each sugar, and added a little extra chopped apple! I also made a simple drizzle of 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 and a half Tbls milk, and 2 Tbls of room temp caramel sauce. They were great!

I definitely added more apples to the recipe because I had some extra that I was trying to use. It turned out delicious. They are moist and chewy bars that would be great plain or warm with a scoop of vanilla. My husband and one year old daughter ate nearly the whole batch!

We really liked these.  I used All Spice in them instead of cinnamon, only because I didn't have cinnamon in the cupboard.  They were really nice with the all spice.  I also added apple juice to the batter like some others.  Once I mixed it I could have kneaded it and rolled it out with a rolling pin, it was really dry.  I added some apple juice just to moisten it up some and make it more batter like and less dough like.  For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and mixed it with some all spice.  They came out awesome!  Next time I'll probably make them with cinnamon though.  Great recipe!

I must say that I made these "gluten free". I used gluten-free flour, and then added 1/4C apple juice to the liquid mixture and upped the diced apples to 1C. Baked for 30 minutes. Crumbly, but sooo yummy, I don't care if I am just covered in them!

The only change I made was to leave out the nuts and replace them with more apples.  Actually I think it could have used even more apples.  So tasty and so easy!

These are soooooo goood! Very easy to make for a quick desert. I think if would be even better with  vanilla ice cream.   The only thing I did additionally was- i added some butter and flour to sugar and cinnamon that goes on top. I love the crunchy streusel toppings on desserts like this. This one I will put in my special recipe box!!!!

Yum! I replaced about 1/8 t. of the vanilla for almond extract that gives it a great hint of almond that goes well with this recipe. I left out the walnuts and half of each of the sugars. The first time I made it I used 1/4 C. white sugar and 1/3 C. brown and that was good also. I can't imagine how sweet it must be with the full amount of sugar. I also added a whole small apple - 1 C. rather than 1/2 C. As others have suggested, the cinnamon sugar topping can also be halved. I didn't use the full amount either.

Good the first day but the second they get soggy so if you are planning to make ahead leave out some liquids.

Wonderful.  What a delicious and easy recipe.  I used pecans because my DD is allergic to walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  Thank you so very much for sharing this great sweet treat with all of us.

These are so easy to make and SO GOOD!  I used gala apples and they turned out awesome.  I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 glass pan, and baked them for 35 minutes.  They were perfect.

I'm assuming this was awesome.  I don't know because my son and husband ate the whole thing (which I doubled) before I had a chance to try it.

These bars are very good. Only made 3 changes: increased chopped apples to 1 cup and increased cinnamon IN the batter to 3/4 teaspoon.  Thirdly, decreased topping to 1 teaspoon cinnamon & 1 T. sugar (or substitute "Cinnamon-sugar" blend).  With these minor changes, recipe is excellent (and makes the house smell delicious while they're baking!)  **UPDATE!**  2/28/11:  One more change that REALLY enhances the flavor:  batter is a 'little' stiff, so I added 3 T. of Apple Butter!!   Oh MY!!  The spices in the apple butter REALLY add to the cinnamon-y taste of the Apple Bars.

These were AMAZING!!  The only thing I changed was add 2 large apples (a little over 2 cups) and a little more cinnamon in the mixture.  Made the house smell like heaven and they tasted so good.  I can eat an entire batch by myself.  Great to heat up for breakfast in the mornings.

This is now the third time I am making this recipe, so obviously thought it was great.  I modified this significantly to make it more healthy.  This is my current batch modification (I doubled the recipe): 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (yes, even when I doubled the recipe) 1 cup oats, 1/4 cup wheat germ, only 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and I omitted the white sugar,  used 1/4 cup light butter and also added 1/4 cup natural applesauce.    I do not feel the recipe was compromised by omitting the white sugar.  Next time I make this I will consider sneaking shredded carrots...   Assuming this batch will turn out just as delicious as the others.

I really enjoyed this dessert. The texture of the soft apples with the crunchy nuts make it delicious. I gave it 4 stars because I think it could use more of the apple/nut mixture.

I made these bars last night, and they were a big hit with my colleagues. I substituted pears for the apples, and I also doubled the batter part of the recipe so that it would fit in a 9 x 13 in pan. I did not double the cinnamon sugar topping as it was plenty. Actually, I thought it was a bit much. I might leave it off next time I make these. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I Loved this! I doubled most ingredients except for the white and brown sugars. I did add apple juice until the flour mix was really moist. Did not add nuts just because I didn't have it. Also ,I skipped the extra sugar for the topping, you don't need it. My 10year old said it was to 'die' for and my 7year old loved it.I made it in the evening and woke up with only 3 pieces left. Will make this one again and again.

I am giving this 4 stars for the exact recipe but 5 after the minor changes I made. For the original recipe pan size, I increased the apples to 1 cup, reduced the white & brown sugars to 1/4 cup each and added 1/2 cup sour cream. For the topping I used: 1/4 brown sugar, 1 TBS butter, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional). Cut the cold butter into the sugar & cinnamon then add the nuts. Add topping then bake. You won't have the problem of sugar falling off the top of the squares with this method. I tried one person's suggestion of a powdered sugar glaze & that was a hit. Next time I will try a butterscotch/caramel glaze. However, these apple squares are wonderful without the additional glazes...just a way to make the recipe a little different.

This was awesome!!!  A 9X13 pan PLUM & apple version of this just came out of my oven at 3 pm & now, 40 minutes later, half the pan is gone!  Even my daughter- who doesn't like cooked fruit- is eating it up!  Why plums? Well, I had 2 lbs of too-sour apples that I was GOING to use for this recipe, went to find the apples this morning for this recipe- and only AFTER I had started the recipe (thinking I had all the ingredients needed) did I find my husband had forced himself to eat them all week because no one else would!  There was only 1 apple left!  So, what to do? I had some over ripe plums from my parents' farm that no one was eating either, so we used them instead, with the 1 apple... We doubled the recipe and also used Splenda Brown Sugar, Half-Salt and no white sugar.  I also tweaked the topping by just adding a small package of Quaker instant oatmeal to the cinnamon-sugar mix and it all came out so fragrant and delicious!!   My house smells SO good now, too!  Thanks for the shares!

Made these today as I had a bunch of wind blown apples in our garden. Read several reviews and decided to double the recipe (excluding the topping). I used a 9X13 stoneware pan, which was the perfect size. I also used 3/4 C of both brown and white sugars and about 1 3/4 C of apple. To make the task easy I use my Pampered Chef Food Chopper, which leaves me able to decide on small or large pieces of apple. I did not do the same topping...just sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I think I would even reduce the sugar amount maybe to 1/2 C (or less) of each next time, as it was plenty sweet. My three little boys have already devoured half the pan, so I will definitely be making again. I think I will try it with different types of flour too, like oat or wheat.

Very tasty! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, but changed the sugar ratio to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. Also used 1/2 wheat flour and 2 large Granny Smith apples and a bit of applesauce. The result was a bit crumbly, but that was probably because of my flour change. My only complaint is that the taste didn't have enough of that apple "zing." The original topping ration is plenty even for a double batch.

If I were to make this again, I would definitely change the topping! (I wish I had read the reviews first.) A 1:1 cinnamon:sugar topping just is too cinnamon-y and powdery. At the very least, add more sugar.  If I were to do it again, I would maybe add flour and butter to make more of a streusel topping. The actual bar though - WONDERFUL!

Fantastic recipe!  I followed one reviewers suggestions and increase the apple to 2 cups for a double recipe and did not double the topping and it was amazing.  I have already had 7 people ask for the  recipe and I only made it 3 days ago.  Thanks for a Delicious treat that I will make again and again!

YUM! This is exactly what I was looking for. These bars were pretty easy to make...it's the day after I made them and the pan of them is almost gone already! I definitely should have doubled the recipe. The only changes I made were to use 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup of chopped apples. I also took the other's advice, and added 1/4 tsp. almond extract. I baked for 25 minutes, and they came out perfect. The cinnamon-sugar topping made a little too much, so I wouldn't make so much next time. The only thing that was a bit tricky, is that the bars were a little hard to keep in a bar shape when I went to take them out of the pan, not a big deal though- just required some being careful.  The consistency is great, not too dense, not too light. Definitely a keeper.

These were pretty good. I baked them for about 25 minutes and they were firm on the outside and gooey (but not too much) on the inside. I didn't have walnuts so I used almonds instead which was still fine. I think they'd make better breakfast bars than dessert-like bars. Despite the amount of sugar topping, they don't taste that sweet. They were nothing amazing but still good and easy to make.

Doubled the recipe, put in 2 cups of apples, only one cup of brown sugar (no white), added caramel drizzle on top.  Absolutely delicious, and it disappeared within minutes.  Everyone raved about it, and asked for the recipe!

This was great!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and used a crumble topping with 3 T oatmeal and 1 T butter in addition to the sugar and cinnamon.  Wish I would have made a double batch.

Instead of all white flour, I added about 1/3 cup of a mixture of wheat bran and wheat germ.  Also, I reduced the sugar to about 1/4 c. brown and 1/3 c. white.  Still very sweet and tasted great!  I may even try reducing the sugar a little more next time and adding applesauce to replace some of the butter.

I wanted to rate these a 3, but three other adults and 2 children enjoyed them (No one raved. They said they were alright.) so I gave them a 4. The only liquid here is butter and egg, so the batter was like a paste. The only thing I changed was I doubled the chopped apples and I still thought the result was quite dry. (I was serving them 10 minutes after they were completely cooled.) I baked for the minimum of 25 minutes. I realize these are squares but it was only thin, on the dry side cake for me. Now don't get me wrong...it was OK, but there was nothing here that urges me to make it again. Sorry BarbiAnn! Maybe I'm just getting spoiled.

Yummy!  Doubled and made it in a 9x13 pan--and tripled the apples too (Gala).

These were fantastic!  I doubled the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan.  Used 2 cups of honey crisp apples, didn't double the sugar topping.  I thought it was good, but my older brother thought it needed more sugar (he's got a small sweet tooth).  I will definetely make these again.  When you are mixing the batter it looks like there is not enough liquid, but as long as you don't overbake (I left mine in for 33 minutes), they will be super moist and delicious!

I liked these a lot. The only changes I made were using whole wheat flour and using 1 whole cut up apple. Easy and much healthier than most other desserts I make :)

These are awesome!  I made them for an early Mother's Day dinner last night, and everyone liked them.  So simple to make, and I always have all the ingredients on hand.  My husband already asked if I was making another batch today!  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Delish, but better with a glaze. and a little tempermental.  Can go from moist to gooey, depending on apples, weather, who knows?  anyway, the topping and a good glaze can cover a myriad of sins.  I beat 1 Tbl lemon juice, 1 tsp cream cheese and 1/2 cup powdered sugar with milk to drizzle over the cut bars.  just the right counterpoint to a pretty conventional recipe.

I've made these twice in the last couple weeks. They are so yummy! Hubby and I eat them up within two days. The first time I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and the second time all whole wheat flour. It still tastes delicious and its just a bit healthier. I also use 1 large apple, not just a half cup. I'll definitely make this over and over!

This recipe was great. It wasn't spectacular, but it was very nice. I think next time, I will triple the amount of apples and double the amount of nuts. Because people said that this was too sugary, I did not add sugar to the top and I left out a little bit of the white sugar. However, I did not find the squares sugary at all. In fact, next time, I think I will follow the recipe exactly. The cooking time and ingredient amounts were perfect. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely try it again, but will double the recipe next time.

I bought a bag of red delicious apples a week ago and most of them have been mushy so no one is eating them.  I was a little worried about using an apple that no one will eat in a baked dish but I figured this was a small recipe, so no big loss if it didn't turn out, right?   Well, this was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as written, except maybe more apple.  I used one and a half smallish apples.  I love this recipe for the easy and speedy preparation, the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand, and the small quantity it makes so that I don't have a huge pan of dessert sitting around begging to be eaten.  Great go to recipe for those chilly fall days when I need something sweet and satisfying.

Very good, but they could be improved with more apples, like other reviewers have suggested. A LOT more apples. Next time I'll more than double the amount. I skipped the sugar on top iced them with old fashioned caramel icing. Then I garnished with pecans and called them caramel apple squares for a bake sale. They were a hit.

The apple squares were a hit in my family. Instead of adding only 1/2 cup of apples I added 1 1/2 cups of apples. It made the squares really moist.

While these were good I was hoping for something a little more stable.  I agree with the reviewer that said this was more like a cake.  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and used 3 cups of chopped cortland apples.  It was a nice cake but not what I would consider "bars" I think a crumb topping would go great on this and then call it an apple coffeecake.

Quick & Easy!  I didn't have enough flour so I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup of oatmeal and it worked great.  Also threw in just a small handfull of white choc. chips and I peeled & sliced a whole granny smith apple, tossed it with the cinn. & sugar and laid the slices on top of the batter for a really nice presentation.  My kids loved this recipe so it's a keeper!  Thanks!

YUM!!!  I read the reviews before I made this so I used 2 cups of chopped apple instead of 1/2 cup, and used about half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and no nuts because I don't like nuts.  It was awesome!  My daughter ate 2/3 of this cake tonight.  I will be making it tomorrow.  There is a home-tasting party company that has a mix that tastes EXACTLY like this cake.  I will never order one of those again!  Thanks so much BarbiAnn for the great recipe.

I just finished baking these and they turned out pretty good.  I had to bake 10 minutes extra since the inside was still moist when I cut into it.  I didn't use the nuts, but instead doubled the apples.  I also exchangd the vanilla for almond.  I got a little taste of the outside before I had to put it back in the oven and it seemed pretty good.  I also used about 2/3 the sugar and cinnamon that the recipe called for.  All-in-all I think it turned out well.  I'm bringing it to my sister's for dessert tonight, so hopefully they'll agree!

I followed the recipe exactly as written although a couple of things threw me like "sprinkle the remaining sugar and cinnamon over the top" but there was no "remaining" sugar and cinnamon.  The recipe says to mix together the butter, brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar which is listed in the list of ingredients.  Also listed is 1/4 tsp cinnamon which went into the flour mixture as directed.  The batter was so think I couldn't even stir it, let alone spread it in the pan!  If I had to do it over again, I would make drop cookies.

These had a wonderful taste, but they simply fell apart for me.  I used about a cup of Granny Smith apples, and used maybe half the amount of cinnamon/sugar topping.  They were nice and appley tasting, and sweet but not overly sweet.  I used butter, not margarine, which added more richness to the flavor.

Really very good.  Sort of like an apple-cinnamon brownie.  Two things though...be sure to use a tart apple, such as Granny Smith.  It would be a little blah with a milder one.  And when it says "cool in pan," it MEANS it.  They're very squishy until they're cool.  But great...thanks for the recipe. :-)

They were pretty good. As someone else suggested, I replaced half of the butter by peanut butter for an extra twist. We really liked the mix of flavours and both went for seconds!

Addictive is the term my husband used after he finished the pan of these squares.  I doubled the recipe (except for the sugar and cinnamon topping), added more apples but still baked it in a 9x9-inch pan for 35-40 minutes.  Works for me...nummy!

Pretty good recipe, but the moistness seems like it is underdone. I prefer a moist cake that does not feel like you are eating batter. I will try it with larger apple pieces next time, and not add the extra liquid despite the suggestions of others.

I took these to a party and everyone thought it was Nana's Apple Cake from a certain home party show!  They were so good.  I also added more apples, cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  Very easy to make!

These are great! My only suggestion is to add some more apples. Otherwise these were wonderful. I recomend topping the bars with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe BarbiAnn!

very moist and tasty square however next time i will add less sugar- it was slightly too sweet in my opinion for a fruit square.  But i will make this again.

I followed the recipe, doubling it as I had a 13 x 9 inch pan. It seemed to be spread quite thin. I used 1 large granny smith apple and pecans for the nuts. As for the topping, I used 3 Tbs. sugar and 3 tsp. cinnamon. I took these yummy squares to a party and got rave reviews and took home an empty platter. Thanks for the recipe.

These are delicious and so easy to make. My kids don’t like nuts, so I left them out. I found the sugar topping was too much, so I have kept half of it to use for next time. This is a great way to use up those apples that are getting a little wrinkly in the fruit bowl.

I also doubled the recipe as I didn’t have a square pan (living in an RV while house being built) I’m in high elevation but didn’t change anything. Came out great in my camper stove. First time I “baked a flour dish in the oven” here

It turned out pretty good, and was very yummy, but next time I make it I won’t add all of the topping because it’s very sweet. I’ll also probably add a little butter to the topping to make it less powdery, because the topping just fell of when it was finished baking. I’m not a huge fan of walnuts, and I think there were a little too much so I’ll probably reduce the amount next time. I would also add more like a cup of apples, because I didn’t think 1/2 of a cup was enough. Otherwise very good, with a great texture!!

I've made it twice, once in an 9x9 pan and once  as a double batch in a 13x9 pan (cooked about 35 min.). It was so easy and amazing! My son loved them and he eats almost all of them and he occasionally sneaks them--he might have typed that part himself:^)

The best Apple Squares I have ever tasted. I did make some changes. 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 1/2 cups chopped apples. Because of the extra apples I had to extend the cooking time an extra 10-15 minutes.

This was delicious. I omitted the nuts (just a personal preference) and sprinkled a little less of the topping. Turned out fantastic. I'm going to make another batch to take to work... A perfect way to share the taste of Autumn apples!

Yum! I pulled this out of the oven about 30 minutes ago and just tried a bit! It was so moist it melted in my mouth! I couldn't stop with just one bite, even though I was just planning on a small taste since I am taking it elsewhere! . I tripled the batch and used only 1 cup each of the sugars. I actually only had one egg and had a bit of a panic until I remembered flaxseed is an egg substitute! Perfect! I used 2 HUGE Granny Smith apples and one small gala, which was probably around 3 cups. I filled a 9 x 13 and an 8x8 and threw them in the oven. They cooked 30 minutes and sprang back perfectly. I will absolutely be using this recipe again and again!! I only wish the whole batch was for me!

I followed all of the suggestions from MOMTOKTL. It is the closest thing to home made-apple pie taste you can get. With these changes I would give it 5 stars.

This is a great recipe! Doubled it and used a 16x10 pan. Only used about 1tbsp of sugar cinnamon topping which was plenty! Baked for 30 minutes and the squares came out moist and delicious! They actually get better the next day! :)

This is exactly the same recipe I have received passed down from my mom, who has been making these squares for 40+ years; its no fail and always a huge hit wherever we take them. Very quick and easy to make. I usually just sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture over top in the amount that we like but its never the full 3 tbsp or so of mixture...just a dusting. I also rarely measure the apple but I know its always more than 1/2 c; closer to 1 cup. Very yummy and a family favourite!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit at work and home. I take it out after 20 min and drizzle some caramel sauce on it then cook for 10 more min. They are perfection. I have tried it with different types of apples and find honeycrisp to taste the best.

This has replaced my MIL's recipe that I had been using. They're awesome! I followed other reviewers' comments regarding doubling the recipe. I did not double the topping and I only used 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugars instead of doubling them. It was plenty sweet. A definite keeper. Very moist -- almost like an apple pie/cake hybrid. Would be heavenly served warm with some vanilla ice cream on top.

Doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. Only used 1 cup brown sugar and no white. Was plenty sweet. Used 3 apples and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Did not use topping. Made a bit of creamcheese frosting/glaze for the top.

So I just made this and my teenage daughter said it was good. I didn't have fresh apples so canned apples were used. It wasn't too sweet but my batter was thick so next time I will try to add the apple juice. I will make again.

I doubled the recipe as recommended and didn't double the topping, there was plenty of topping. I also used 2 apples. The squares were ate up very quickly. I was asked for the recipe, which is a good indicator of how much it was liked.

These are really good! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. I would reduce the amount of cinnamon in the topping a little next time. They taste like strudel tops on muffins. Super easy and fast to make. I was almost going to make muffins and this seemed easier. Also I used raw sugar instead of white sugar since that's what I had.

This is good. But I'll probably bake it in an 8 inch pan next time, instead of the 9 inch indicated in the recipe. It dried up a bit in the 9-inch pan. Or I'll probably double the recipe too.

This recipe is very good and didn't last for more than a day at my house!  I needed to triple the vanilla extract and cinnamon so I would be able to taste them.  I also added a cup of apples unpeeled.

Didn't work for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly. It just wouldn't cook. It was practically raw in the middle and then rock hard on the outside. The cake also never rose. The sugar/cinnamon coating on top remained just like plain dry sugar granules. Very strange.

This was just okay. a 9x13 dish was too big. The bars were too thin, and fell apart easily.There also seemed to be too much sugar and cinnamon on top. The flavor was pretty good though.

We really liked these squares.  I used white whole wheat and sucanat sugar, in place of the flour and brown and white sugars.  Really good and healthier.

A HIT!! I made this last night. I doubled the recipe & one pan is mostly gone. My family loves it!! I left the nuts out and shredded the apples. I also reduced the sugar. Next time I may include raisins, pumpkin or cranberries (it is the season)! Will definitely make with different types of apples!

These were pretty good.  Like many other reviewers I doubled the recipe (except for the topping) and threw in about 2.5 cups of chopped apples.  The bars got a little darker than I thought they would and I was afraid I'd overcooked them but they taste good.  I will make these again.  DH is plowing through his 4th one right now.

These were delicious. I halved the sugar, skipped the nuts, and shredded the apple (about 1/2 an apple). Next time I'll try half whole wheat flour, half all purpose flour. I'll definitely be making these again. I almost always have these ingredients on hand and they were fast and easy to make.

I asked my husband how they were and his exact words were "if you never made this again I would leave you." LOL! So delicious... My only changes were that I increased the apple to 3/4 c (I used Granny Smith) and I used turbinado sugar in place of regular white sugar.  I can't stop eating them and he and our son can't either... Will definitely be making this again and again!!!

These are fantastic! Ooey, gooey, streusely goodness. The batter was very thick and I was worried it wasn't going to set up right, but it came out great! I did have to bake it for about 6 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

Followed this recipe exactly and it didn't seem like it got baked all the way inside. Texture was gritty, like you could taste the sugar when you took a bite. Flavor was good, but these probably should have baked for 35-40 minutes.

OMG, I loved this recipe.  I did tweak it a bit.  I doubled the recipe since I used a 13x9 pan. I read some reviews, and ended up putting 2 cups of apples into the bars.  I did at some nutmeg just to have something extra.  I also put in around a teaspoon more of vanilla because why not? Lastly, I added almond milk to the recipe.  After cooking for around 30 minutes, the bars came out fantastic, and were reminiscent of coffee cake, much to the enjoyment of my family.  Also, for the topping, I just played it by sight.  I poured a little cinnamon in a bowl and a little more sugar and mixed.  After pouring the topping on top, I would make more depending on how covered the top of the dessert was.  All in all, it was amazing, and am definitely stashing this recipe away.

Wow! They turned out just as I was hoping they would. I made this last night, I save one square for my husband lunch. He told me they are even better the second day. It's hard to believe because they are so good! I am going to make them again. I made as is today I'm going to try a oatmeal strudel topping!

While these were good, they aren't really anything to write home about. I left off the sugar/cinnamon topping because the batter was all ready extremely sweet. I might make them again sometime but not anytime soon.

These are AMAZING! I read the less positive reviews first and was a bit hesitant on this recipe, but I followed exactly except for leaving out the nuts and doubling the apples (due to allergies). Absolutely perfect! They haven't completely cooled on the counter yet and they're 1/3 gone! Thanks for the fab recipe!

Yummy! I reduced the sugars to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown, and increased the apples to 2.25 cups.  I also skipped the cinnamon sugar topping.  Everyone loved it!  And with less sugar and more fruit, it was healthy enough for breakfast.

Well, I wanted to love these, but just thought they were ok.  Let me say that I did like the taste overall.  The problem was like some other reviewers, Mine did not come out like bars.  After cooling in pan as directed I found the outsides to be a harder consistency and the inside to be a bit too moist and gooey.  Possibly if I had cooked them a bit longer, but then I fear the outside would have been too hard.  Too bad because the taste was good, but I needed them to serve in bars as finger food, not on a plate with a fork.

This recipe turned out great with a couple of small changes. I doubled the recipe but cut down the brown  sugar and white sugar to 2/3 cup of each (instead of 1 cup of each had I doubled the original recipe) and used 2 apples (approximately 2 cups). I baked it in a 9x13 inch pan. It turned out very moist and has just the right amount of sweetness and apple flavor! I will definitely be making this again!

These bars were really good! My only suggestion would be to decrease the amount of cinnamon sugar on top to at least half. There was just too much and it made them too sweet. Otherwise, a very nice fall treat. :)

This was really, really good.  Used a whole pealed apple, heaping 1/2 cup & a little less sugar, barely shy 1/2 cup each just because of the other reviews I read.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe once and loved it so much, that I quadrupled the recipe and made it again the next day. The second time, I subtracted just about a fourth of a cup from both sugars and used more apples than the recipe did (2 whole large apples). I also just sprinkled the sugar cinnamon topping to what looked about right; the recipe called for too much. Then I bought some caramel ice cream topping and drizzled it on top. EXCELLENT. It came out even better this second time.
I shared it with everyone I could and they are all asking me when I will make it again.

Amazing!  Took this to work and everyone fell in love.  I doubled everything, but only used 3/4 cup of both white and brown sugars.  Baked at 350 for 28 minutes.  I also added nutmeg to both the batter and sugar topping.  Drizzled with caramel and a powdered sugar icing (which I made with caramel macchiato coffee creamer instead of milk). I will make this again :)  This was so easy.

Super Delicious!! Iv made these a few times everyone loved them!! Today i decided to play with the recipe a bit to make them a bit healthier! i used oat flour in place of regular,used half melted butter/half apple sauce and halfed the sugar and they still were plenty sweet! I also didnt use the sugar ontop of te bars just sprinkled with the pecans.Excellent with my tweaks at 12 servings brought the calories down to about 112! a definite keeper!

These were really good and full of flavor. I used half pear and half apple. I made the recipe in a larger pan so doubled it except for the sugar which I did at x1.5 then 2 cups of the fruit. Warmed up with some vanilla ice cream and a caramel drizzle....DIVINE! Love this recipe for kicking off the fall season. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I did use more than a half cup of apples and I also added a little all spice and nutmeg and then I drizzled caramel on top after they were cooked.  It's delicious!

Love this recipe, I tweaked it a bit, added 2 cups of apples vs. the 1/2 cup, skipped the nuts, cut the sugars in half, doubled the cinnamon, and my topping was a tbls. of butter, 3 tsp. of cinnamon. 1 tbls. of brown sugar, and a handful of quick oats, mashed with a fork and sprinkle on top, ok, I guess I tweaked it a lot lol

This recipe is delicious! However I wouldn't exactly it healthy with amount of sugar in it but my husband loved them. I used gala apples but will probably try Granny Smith or Macintosh with a sugar substitute.

I can't rate this on the exact recipe. I read a lot of reviews for this and tried my best to follow their suggestions. Many suggested to double the recipe except for the sugars. Now, little fact, I always half recipes when I first try them out. I don't want to waste my ingredients for a failure you know? So Instead, I used the regular recipe and decreased the sugars from 1/2 cup to 1/3 (i am sure many hear would suggest 1/4 but I have a giant sweet tooth) and double the apples from 1/2 cup to a whole one. That is what I did. Now, I was expecting more of an apple crumble consistency, this was more of a cake. But as the recipe is, it is delicious. I made these for my mom and her friends and they loved it. I made these along side with some very tasty lemon bars (also from this site) and these ran out quick. They said the apples were baked perfectly and it was just the right amount of sweetness.They bashfully reached for seconds and thirds and I was very happy they enjoyed. I liked them as well and will definitely reach for this recipe during the holidays!

These apple squares are delicious!  I doubled the recipe and put batter in a 9x13 pan. They freeze well, they are always a BIG hit around our house with family and friends.  Great Christmas square!!!!!

My boyfriend and I made this recipe a few times, and after following the recipe exactly the first time we made a few adjustments. The first time it tasted fine, but the squares were not quite as firm as I'd expected--it seemed rather soft, so soft that when I cut into it the squares merely fell apart and I ended up eating them with a fork. (He didn't mind, however--he likes his baked sweets somewhat under-baked.) the second time we increased the baking time, and used the whole recipe in two separate baking dishes. It turned out a little better, but not as much as I'd hoped. If we do make this one again I may have to experiment to get it to come out the way I'd like it to. Overall the taste is great--I would try not to do anything to change that--but it doesn't hold together very well.

Cooked for 25 minutes, made the recipe as specified, except 1/3 whole wheat flour instead of all AP flour, and extra apple (since 1 apple is ~ 1 cup of chopped apple, not 1/2 cup) and didn't have brown sugar, so used all white sugar and used probably only 3/4 of the sugar listed.

Yum! Made as written except used powered almonds (had on hand from spice store).  Will make again, so easy, tasty and think any kind of nut and/or fruit would work.  Plan next batch with pears (will use double the amount of fruit)and more of my leftover finely ground almonds and maybe just 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in topping and a dash of nutmeg.  Great recipe for kids to make as all done with sturdy wooden spoon.

Had high expectations for this recipe but the flavor just wasn't there for me, a little too sweet and not enough spice.  Next time I'll use a sharper apple with more flavor.

Yum Yum. Served warm with vanilla ice cream is my favorite. I added about 1 cup of apples. And 1/4 cup fresh home made apple sauce. It turned out wonderfully. I just felt like 1/2 cup of apples wasn't enough apples for something that was supose to be all about apples.

This was my first time trying these and they were delicious! Our family recently picked some apples from a mountain close to our town and I could not decide on what to make. I read some of the previous reviews and tried some of the adjustments. I doubled the recipe but left the sugar amount the same, and baked it in a 9x13 pan. Others said not to double the cinnamon but I (accidentally) did anyway and it still came out great. I used 2 large Fuji apples instead, since that's what we had.  I had planned on using chopped almonds, as one member suggested, but figured I'd leave them out and take my chances. I also added about 1/3 cup of apple juice to give it more of an apple flavor. I left out the top coating of sugar and cinnamon because I didn't want it to be too sweet, and because others said it fell off too easily anyway. Let me tell you, I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts (I made these for my husband's co-workers), but these were AMAZING. I was going to drizzle some caramel on top but they were perfect without it! After cooling I cut them into squares and they didn't cut neatly, but that's perfectly fine by me. I had no problem getting a fork and going to town on all the delicious crumbs in the pan. It pretty much came out like an apple pie cake. I'll definitely have to make more sooner than expected.

Too sweet. I doubled the recipe (didnt double the topping as suggested) reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup for both brown and white and it was still too sweet.
*however one girl asked me for a recipe, she tryed it next morning, so maybe they get better next day :)

I made this today. I followed the recipe for 9x9 pan as it is just for me.  Wow it tastes great.  My plan is to make this as a quick breakfast on the go.  I am gonna freeze a portion of it to see how it tastes.  If its good then I can make larger batches and defrost as needed.
The only modifications that I made to make it a bit healthier was to add 1/4 cup of oatmeal and 3/4 cup of flour instead of a whole cup of flour. I also sprinkled in some ground flax seed. As reccommend by others I doubled the amt of granny smith apples.

This has lots of possiblities. I can see adding in cranberries or rasins too next time. 

I will definately make this again.  Sorry to be one of those reviewers that modify ...but I always see these recpies as a base to modify my personal preferences.

It's not very often I want to rate a recipe more than 5 stars.  These bars really are amazingly good.  Words cannot describe how lovely these are and why have I only now tried this recipe?! I did not add any nuts as I was making for kids.  I think I will add more apple to the next batch.

I tripled all but the topping as others did and baked in a 9x13 pan. Tastes even better the next day! Almost too sweet for my kids according to the seven-year-old! More a dessert than  breakfast...Tasty, though! I would probably bake it on 325 for my oven next time because it got a little brown on the outside before it was done through.

This is an amazing recipe.  The only thing that I added was that I grated one apple and thinly sliced another apple for the batter, I added 1/2 tsp almond extract, and cut the sugar cinnamon topping down to 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Best served slightly warm when they are really soft - they get a little chewy when they are cool.  Good flavor though!

I have got to say that this recipe was awesome. I thought that 1/2 cup of apples was not enough so I put in 3 medium sized apples. With this amount it was perfect. There was enough to ensure that great apple taste and that everybody had some. For the topping I accidentally used 2 TBS cinnamon instead of tsp. Got to say that the finish product was just as great. My family loved it. My one brother loves apple and when I gave him 2 pieces he asked for more unknowingly that he already ate 2! One thing that is important when making these, is to make sure that it is not hot. Maybe stick it in the fridge. Also egg replacer works well. Not as well as a regular egg but still good. Will definitely make these again and again. A truly simple dessert.

I doubled the recipe and brought it in for pot luck at work.  What a hit!  Everyone loved it and ate every bite!  So many people asked for the recipe that I had to print extra copies and leave it by the empty dish.  Amazing!

The only thing I changed (based on other reviews) was adding more apples and drizzling on a caramel glaze after they were done (caramels, butter, vanilla, and cream melted slowly together). Fantastic!! I'm sure they are delicious as the recipe is written, but I wanted a little bit more fruit in it for my kids. And the caramel glaze was not strictly necessary either, just a bit of decadence.  : ) My 2 & 4 year old boys devoured them (and they often just eat the icing on a cake)!

I've made these a couple times now and I'm a big fan. I put in twice as many apples and about half as much sugar and they turn out wonderfully. A little more cake-y than square-y but there's nothing wrong with that. Great for get-togethers or to cut a freeze and bring as a snack in your school or work lunch.

These were great! After reading the reviews I ended up doubling the ingredients and made this into a cake and baked it for about an hour. Few days later I made cookies and they were just as good.

Very very Yummy. Lasted only 24 hours in our house. So good! If this is your first time making this I would double the batch because your going to wish you did if you only make one batch.  I cooked it for 30 min in my gas oven.

These were delicious and gone in a flash.  I even doubled the recipe!:)  Anyway, I doubled everything except the topping and baked in a 9x13 pan.  It took about 34minutes or so in the oven.  Even with not doubling the topping, I still didn't use all of what I had.  I would probably halve the topping, or at least cut back a little on the cinnamon.  Also, I would add some more apple next time, even though I used two overflowing cups I would have liked more.  I also used an apple peeler/slicer to cut my apples, but next time I would hand cut so I could leave the apples a little more chunky.  Overall, great recipe!

I made these last night for work.  My family couldn't get enough of them so I ended up making 3 batches.  One for home, one for my husbands work and one for my work.  I put them out this morning and they are already gone.  I cut mine into bite sized pieces instead of small squares.  It made it nice for my coworkers to just pop one in their mouth as they walked by.

Thanks.  I will be making these again for the holidays.

Oh so good! I doubled the recipe but not the topping and added a few drops of almond extract as suggested. Baked for 32 minutes in a 9x9 pan. Turned oven off and let it cook for 5 more minutes. I made this for my twins' preK class. My kids tried them before I served them lunch and boy, the did not even finish lunch because they wanted another share of this. Can't blame them.

Great recipe - very easy.  Loved the one bowl, no mixer!  I doubled the recipe and used a jelly roll pan.   Served to a group last night and everyone requested the recipe.  I don't like making changes to recipes, but I did double the amount of apples.

For dietary reasons, I made a lot of adjustments to this recipe, but the bars were quite tasty (and I credit that to the original recipe, and some suggestions of other reviewrs, not my changes). I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan. Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4, only used 2 Tbsp butter, and added 1/4 c. applesauce and 1 small, mashed banana. Only used 1/4 c. of both brown and white sugar, per other reviewer's recommendations, and doubled the amount of apple.  I did keep the topping amounts as noted, since I'd cut the sugar in the base recipe.  These wen't over really well with the kids as well as adults!  (Really loved eating them warmed, too.)

These were so delicious! I omitted the walnuts since I didn't have any, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. My one complaint is the baking time. Even after baking an extra 5 minutes they still turned out a lot goo-ier than I expected, but they still tasted great, and my family ate them up.

Excellent squares, I made them for a catering. Easy to make and very beautiful!
Only thing I did differently is tripled the amount of apples.  When I make it again I would only use 2/3 the sugar, it was very sweet for me.

AWESOME! I made them vegan by subbing Earth Balance butter, egg substitute, 1/2 cup organic brown sugar, 1/4 cup organic white sugar (next time I will reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup also as it was WAY sweet for our tastes), applesauce to thicken, used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon, and pecans instead of walnuts...this was magnificant and I will now be making a triple batch for my running group...thanks!!!

So delicious!  I have taken it to parties as a dessert and everyone always wants the recipe.  Moist, dense, and apple-y.  I usually double the amount of apples, though.  (and add extra cinnamon since we like it!)

The first time I saw this I just had to try it. After reading past reviewers suggestions I decided to double the recipe except for the brown and white sugar which I kept at 3/4 cup each. I used two granny smith apples and it ended up a little over 2 cups, diced. I used 2T of white sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon topping. The topping was a nice cinnamony, sugary crunchy texture. Loved it and there was just enough flavoring throughout the squares. I've made this a couple of times and my family said these taste just like "French Apple Pie," and like it much better with the Fuji apples -vs- Granny Smith. They also said that the Fuji apples have a mellow flavor and a firmer bite. They like biting into the small apple pieces which I think adds a nice texture to the squares.   Next time I think I will serve this warm with a scoop of cold french vanilla ice cream. Ono!

Amazing !!!!! These are so good. I doubled the recipe except the topping, and also decreased the sugar to 3/4c each. I added  a 1/4 tsp of each nutmeg, allspice & cardamom. I also didn't add the nuts. Thanks for sharing.

So Good!  Easy to make too.  I did not sift anything, used one whole apple, doubled the cinnamon and did not even bother with the nuts or topping.  It took a bit longer to bake than what the directions say, maybe 10 minutes more, but they baked perfectly!  Next time I might not use all the sugar it calls for.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I love these bars! They're moist and delicious. I didn't change a thing to the recipe, except for halving the cinnamon sugar topping. I think these are best when they're cold!

These were very simple to prepare and turned out wonderfully. Next time I may add more cinnamon and try some nutmeg for added flavor.

This is THE BEST APPLE TREAT ON THE PLANET!!!  It is soooooo good and sooooo easy!!  I did put 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because I love it but other than that I made it as is.  I have made it 3 times in the last month and everyone that tries it wants the recipe!  I would give it ten stars if I could.  Thank you BarbiAnn for a great recipe!!!

Very pleasant dessert.  I doubled everything except the sugars and apples, and used a 9x13 pan.  I cut the sugar by almost half, using more brown sugar than white.  I used 2 and a half times the apples but left out the walnuts to accommodate the kids.  I added chopped walnuts to the topping on half of the Apple Squares.

This is awesome! So moist and comfortingly good. 

I had some apples in the kitchen and thought I could use them for this recipe. I followed the reviews and doubled the recipe (except for the topping) then baked it using the Perfect Brownie pan. 

It came out perfect, like the ones you find at cafes and dessert shops. Will definitely keep this recipe for Easter.

Amazing!  Really, truly delicious.  Made double the mixture and only half the topping.  My oven is slower than most so this took an hour at 150 degrees.  Took approx 5 mins to eat the lot!!!!!  Would recommend NOT omitting the walnuts as lend a special something.

These were what I made last night. They turned out amazing! I doubled the amount of apple it called for, used 1/4 cup of apple juice since we had it in the fridge & one of the reviews said it made theirs more moist, & only used half the cinnamon sugar topping. And, I used trader joes jumbo raisins (chopped) instead of nuts. But the best part was the caramel frosting I drizzled on the cooled bars: confectionary sug., milk & a couple Tbs. of prepared t-marzetti's caramel apple topping. YUMMY!

I add more apples and less sugar in the bread part, but for the topping, I make a crumble with the sugar/cinnamon as I add some flour & butter to it also. Always use Granny Smith/tart apples. Soo good!

I have made these 2 times and my entire family loves them. They get eaten very quickly here in my house! I double the amount of apples and make sure the walnuts are chopped very fine. This is also DELICIOUS with a bit of caramel drizzled on top after it is removed from the oven. I will be making this for Christmas dinner at my family's house!

These are delicious, but you will need to DOUBLE the recipe!  We used Splenda Brown Sugar and didn't use walnuts.  Also, the sugar mixture for the top is not necessary.

These squares are super moist and super yummy! A perfect fall treat. I, like most other reviewers, doubled the recipe. I still used my 9x9 pan, so they came out thicker, almost like brownies. Got a little confused with the consistency of the batter because the recipe says to "pour" it into the pan, but mine was thicker, almost like a dough and I had to spread it. Everything turned out great though, and they got rave reviews! I drizzled a little melted caramel over them after they came out of the oven.

Delicious ! I did not add the nuts and increased to 3-4 apples. It was very moist and better the next day. Not a very pretty dessert, but never mind- the taste is wonderful!

These are pretty darn good! I just can't give it 5 stars though because it wasn't quite sweet enough for this junk food junkie. But they're still very yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the bars tasted great, but definitely needs a few tweeks! When I bake again [and I definitely would bake again!] I will DOUBLE the apples as well as used less cinnamon. The cinnamon called to sprinkle on top at end is a bit overwhelming, and I actually brushed a lot of it off once out of oven because it was too much. I would do 1 TBSP of sugar & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

These bars are absolutely fabulous!  I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan.  My family of four ate over half the pan in one sitting.  I did add a butter/sugar/flour mixture on top.  Will definitely be making this again very soon.  We call this comfort food.

I made these with pears instead of apples.  They are excellent.  The only thing I will change is to use 1 tsp  cinnamon and 1 tbsp sugar for the topping instead of 2.

These are quite good. I made a double batch, using less than 2x the sugar and only 1x the cinnamon topping, as other reviewers suggested. I used about 2 to 2.5 cups of chopped apples. If I make this again, I will cut the sugar even more, maybe just 1/2 cup each for a double batch.

I was verrry unsure about this after i mixed it all together, it was lumpy and hard to spread, maybe my fault. I thinned it a little with 1 tbsp sunflower oil, but next time will increase the quantity of butter a little to ease the spreading. BUT it baked beautifully, the batter rose up between the apple pieces and baked nicely. I did reduce the sugar and used only brown, to 3/4 cup and it was perfect. I made it last nite and there's just 2 pieces left between hubby and me. He thought it was divine! Thanks for a great recipe.

OMG! This is so good. I used 2 medium apples (less than 2 cups) because I have so many, which made it more of a crumb cake and not a bar. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. It is a waste of time to make a 9 x 9. Double it or quadruple it right away. You won't be sorry. *My only complaint: In what world is a 9x9 pan 16 servings? We got 9:)

My husband and 7 year old daughter couldn't get enough of these squares!  I doubled the recipe...next time I'll double everything but the sugar and cinnamon on the top as it was too much.  I think I'll even add extra apple as well.  This is a keeper!

These apple squares are delicious and very easy to make.  I also used Splenda in place of the white sugar, used pecans instead of walnuts, and tripled the amount of apples and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  My house smelled wonderful as they were baking and they came out great!

These tasted good and were sweet, but they were never "done".  After cooking at least 45 minutes, they were still very gooey and seemed like batter. They should not be called squares, as they don't come out of the pan holding their shape. Maybe if it was called Apple Dessert, expectations would be met??  Yummy taste, just not the form or texture I expected/needed (wanted to take them to my son's kindergarten class)...

I am still giving this 5 stars even though I modified it.  Hubby is borderline diabetic so I substituted Splenda  for the white sugar and Splenda brown sugar for the other.  Used a no calorie, liquid butter for the butter and egg beates for the egg.  Everything else the same and it was wonderful!!!

This was amazing! I doubled the apples and walnuts (we love both!), and it was scrumptious! I gave my printed copy of the recipe to a friend that tried them! Rave reviews from all the adults at our bible study last night!!! We'll be making these again, but we'll double everything to make a bigger batch!

Absolutely the best apple recipe I've made in years! I doubled it and took a few squares to my father-in-law...he showed up the next night asking for more. Even my picky husband loved it...we split the last piece because we both wanted it so much. Thanks!

I must have overbaked this recipe; I doubled and placed in a 9x13 pan and backed for 30 minutes.  The edges were a bit dry, but the middle was moist and delicious!  I would defnitely make again and adjust baking time.

I bake often but this did not turn out right for me. I think I did not bake it long enough but it looked done. I topped cake with the caramel glaze and it became gooey. It may have been too warm for the glaze. I put it back in the oven with hopes of saving it and it was better but not quite right. I had to spoon it not cut bars. Not sure if I will attempt this again or not. The glaze was real good and just the right touch.

The batter was a lot thicker than I expected - almost like a dough.  (Not sure if it was supposed to be like that?)  The end result is like an apple cake - pretty good but nothing special.  After seeing all the reviews I wonder if I did something wrong...

I love this recipe! It is so simple & easy to make. I did make a slight modification. I added craisins (dried cranberries). It gives a tang to the sweet apples.

These are very good.  I substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts and doubled the amount of apples.  A splash of lemon juice brightens the taste.  I also left out the white sugar, only sprinkled on the top.  Wonderful fall recipe!

These are so yummy. Like little slices of apple pie, cake style! I doubled the recipe (also increased my apples to 2 cups) and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 minutes. So good with fresh Ontario Macintosh apples!

Made these per the original recipe, but did double and use a 9 x 13 pan like others suggested. It's a good thing I did too, or we wouldn't have had any left after the first day. I used Gala apples and walnuts and it is delicious!

These are fantastic! I made the following changes to mine: Increased the chopped apples to 1 cup, reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp almond extract, and added a handful of chopped dates that I had left over from another recipe. I baked these in an 8x8 pan for 30 minutes, and they turned out moist and chewy. YUM! Next time I might try a different using pecans as the nut or adding raisins.

Absolutely yummy!  I used honey instead of sugar ( as i always substitute for white sugar) and I had no square tine so i used muffin tray.. but they were moist and delicious. I also drizzled    "Icing" made of natural yoghurt and honey on them...very popular... dissappeared in no time.

Wow! These were delicious!The football team raided these and they were gone within minutes!  I was asked to make a dessert for my sons football team for their dinner on Thursday night, so I made these. I read the other reviews. I doubled the batch, add a 1/4 tsp of almond extract, put in a 13X9 pan and baked for 33 min. Perfect! I also drizzled a glaze on top, although not necessary, they are perfect they way they are! My glaze consisted of  1 cup of 10x sugar, 1/4 tsp almond extract, 2 TBSP of milk. I drizzled over bars, let it "set" and I got so many requests for the recipe! Even from the Moms the following day at the game! Made me these tonight for my honey, he will be pleasantly surprised! Definitely a keeper! Thanks BarbiAnn!

Found that I needed to bake this longer and that more apples teaste better.  I would recommend the same as many others of 2x the apples.  I would also recommend cutting back on the topping slightly.  Overall very good.

The changes or additions I made: I minced one granny smith apple...equal to 1 cup of apples instead of 1/2 cup chopped as required in recipe. I also added 1/4 cup of oats to the batter. Used 1 T sugar for the topping and 1/4 t cinnamon. This is really good. You can serve it warm with ice-cream if you want to get fancy. Then drizzle with a warm carmel sauce and a pinch of chopped nuts thrown on top. Fancy!! : ))

I followed the recipe but these did not bake well.  They were dry on the outside and still gooey in the middle.  They tasted good but very very sweet.  If I did make these again I would cut down the amount of sugar.

These are delicious! I use one whole granny smith apple, chopped, which about doubles the amount of apple called for, and instead of putting the nuts in the batter, I chop them up and toss them with the cinnamon sugar topping and after spreading the mix over the top, I press down lightly so not too much falls off. With the extra apples this is not a tight bar that holds well in your hand, but it is so good, especially when it's served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Followed the recipe almost exactly and it was incredible. The only change I made was to decrease the white sugar to 1/4 cup, and it was still VERY sweet. I diced one large apple and it turned out to be about 2 cups but I used it all anyway. I spread the walnuts over the top and then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top until it was evenly covered. I chose to make these because I had 40 minutes to make a dessert for company, they were fast and easy and delicious! Will make again!

I cut the sugar in half, doubled the apples, and inadvertantly omitted the sugar/cinnimon mixture sprinkled on top in my initial batch.  With these changes, the cake came out moist and flavorful, and it dsappeared quickly at the event at which they were served.  I'm making another batch tonight!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 cake pan.  It’s an easy way to use up apples, the sugar and cinnamon topping was a little over powering. I followed the recipe, but next time I will cut back on the topping. They are more like a cake than bars, would be good with a whipped topping!

These are delicious!  Great afternoon snack with tea or coffee and the kids love them!  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I also used a little less butter than the recipe called for (because I ran out) so I substituted a little canola oil.  Turned out perfect. I didn't use the topping in this recipe because I had some left over from the "to die for blueberry muffins" recipe from this site.  I saved it in the freezer for a recipe just like this.

Wow!  I followed this recipe exactly--amazing!  So easy and delicious.  The only thing I would change is to do about 1/2 the amt. it calls for of cinnamon sugar...the topping was a little too sweet for my taste.  But excellent texture and flavor.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe.

These are really good.  I double the amount of apple though and they turn on great!  I also dont put in nuts.  It turns out very moist and delicious!

These are good but they are incredibly sweet -too sweet and I love sweets..  I doubled it and baked it in a 9X13 pan.  My only change was using twice the apple called for.  The cinnamon-sugar topping is way too much so if you use it I recommend cutting it down quite a bit.  I actually think a glaze, like many reviewers used, would probably be better.  Besides a sugar adjustment, the flavor and texture were very good and it would be great with some vanilla ice cream!  I baked them 30 minutes but after cooling, I think they could have used another 5 minutes or so.

It was my son's turn to bring the snack for his cub scout troop so we made these together. They were very good, kind of reminded me of apple pie. However, I don't know if my pan was a bit too small or what, but it turned out about the size (thickness) of a cake.

These were VERY good.  I made some healthy changes to this recipe and it was still delicious.  Here are my changes  -Half white flour/half wheat -1TBSP milled flax+ 3 tbsp water mixed well replacing the egg (we were out) -one whole small apple, diced small which was a heaping half cup, rather than just a half cup. -replaced white sugar with half white sugar half Splenda. -pecans instead of walnuts  The batter was VERY dry when mixed like cookie dough consistency (probably because of my flax substitute) so I added a few splashes of white grape juice that we happened to have in the fridge.  Baked at 350 for about 30 min.    The problem now, is that I've eaten 3 of them.  Defeats the purpose of the healthy changes!

I tried this and there wasn't nearly enough batter - try with 1 apple and double the mixture.

I doubled the apples. Perhaps that was too much, bars fell apart. I halved the cinnamon/sugar topping - still too much. My coworkers really liked them, but I wasn't impressed. Even with all the apples these were still lacking in flavor. I do reccomend throwing them in the freezer for 10 - 20 minutes before attempting to cut them.

I didn't expect this to be so cake-like; however, it is extremely good!  My friend didn't want to try it because she doesn't like walnuts (nor do I!) but after convincing her to try it she thought it was delicious as well!  The only thing I would suggest (if you like desserts to be sweet) is to melt frosting and drizzle it on top.  I had the leftover cinnamon stick dip from Pizza Hut and used that as the topping and it really made the difference!

Alterations: used half whole wheat/regular flour, half of the sugar(both brown & white), two cups of chopped apples instead of .5 cups. Smelled amazin' as it was bakin'! I would definitely recommend using 1/2 of the sugar/cinnamon mixture--recipe calls for way too much sugar here as well. Next time I'll definitely be cutting it down & maybe using all whole wheat flour. Twas my first time using whole wheat & I must say it's not bad at all. Also, baked 'em for 35 minutes.

These are absolutely delicious. A few minor suggestions.  Add plenty of extra apples. I at least double what the recipe calls for. If you want to double the recipe for 9x13  pan, don't double the topping cinnamon and sugar.  There's plenty with 2 T sugar and 2 t cinnamon.  Made these yesterday for the 2nd time and my hubby has eaten 3/4 of the pan already. They are so easy and good.

These were great. I took them to work and within 15 minutes the pan was gone (and there are only about 10 people in the office). 

I doubled the recipe & put in 9x13 pan (they got about an inch thick). Also, took advice of others and doubled apples (2 cups) and left the topping at the original amount. It is a stiff dough so it was tough to mix the apples in so I might try mixing them in before the flour mixture the next time. I did drizzle on a powdered sugar glaze just to gussy them up a bit. Would also be great served warm with ice cream or made with rhubarb instead (have to try that in the spring). I'll definitely be making these again in the next day or so. Thanks!

These tasted alright, but they were too doughy. They fell apart easily and weren't what I would call a bar. They're more like a doughy pastry or something. Probably won't make these again. Very sugary.

Yum!  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup but still a bit too sweet, 2/3 cup mixture of the brown and white sugar would probably be perfect.  I also only used 2 tablespoons for the sugar/cinnamon topping, made a nice top crust.  Used probably more like 1 cup of chopped apples and 1/2 cup of wheat flour in place of some of the white flour since I ran out.

I doubled this recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan. I made two separate batches, one in a glass pan and one in a lined metal pan. They both came out the same, delicious! I took them to work and they were all gone by lunch time. I highly recommend this recipe!

A moist, delicious bar. The smell when these are baking is divine! I cut both sugars to 3/4 of a cup and it was more than enough.

Yummy, these bars are so delicious! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe to put in a 9x13 pan. (I used 2 eggs, pecans instead of walnuts). I didn't increase the sugar on the topping. I'll be making these again (and again)!

I always read the daily new reviews - it's a great way to see what everyone is trying and a nice way to find good recipes.  I noticed everyone was making these and loving them...well I have now made them and love them.  Next time I will double the recipe because my out of town company has devoured these in less than a couple of hours.  This recipe is definately a keeper and a remaker :-)!!!

Flavor-wise, these are probably a 10.  The texture, however, was funny to me.  It was cakey on bottom, cobbler-like on top, and gooey in the middle.  Maybe I didn't bake them long enough?  Either way, they didn't last too long at my house.  Will absolutely make again.

I made these for work and they were a hit.  I doubled the amount of apples and used a smaller pan so they would be thicker.  Several people wanted the recipe.  Make sure you watch the last 5-10 minutes of baking because it is hard to determine when the bars are done.

Absolutely delicious! I modified it slightly, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon in with the dry ingredients, 2 cups of apples (cortland)and for the topping I used dark brown sugar and half the cinnamon. I will most definitely at least double this recipe next time, if not triple. This is a keeper for sure! Thank you for the recipe!

I just made these and they are great!  To make them a little healthier, I added 2 Tablespoons of applesauce and only used half the butter. I also doubled the apple. They are wonderful and smell so good that my kids came downstairs to ask what I was making.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I just made these and they are delicious!!  I upped the apples to 1 cup and decreased the cinnamon for the topping to 1 tsp.  It made my house smell just like an apple pie baking!  Soooo good!  This is definitely a favorite!

I reviewed this recipe a while back and gave it about 4, maybe 4 and a half stars.  I went back to this recipe and after re-doing it, I give it 5 stars all around.  I made some ingredient adjustments but kept the 'main theme' of the dessert right in line with the recipe.  I used large apples which was probably double the 1/2 cup called for.  And this time I actually cooked the apples on the stove top before adding to the 'cake' batter.  I added a little lemon juice, water, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt to the apples and made kind an apple pie type of filling.  This helped the apples bake right and become super moist.  I also added 1/4 of applesauce and some nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  I did not have walnuts on hand and had to leave them out.  Then I doubled everything, including my own changes, and baked in a 1/4 sheet cake pan, leaving off the cinnamon sugar topping.  And instead I used a vanilla glaze recipe from this site, just adding in a pinch of cinnamon.  These bars were so incredible moist and yummy.  Definitely more of a cake bar, but not quite a cake if that makes sense?  Either way, very yummy.  Will be making this over and over and over!

I used half the sugar and doubled the apples (granny smith) as others have suggested.  Very good texture and taste I had to taste test when they came out of the oven to make sure they were ok:)!)-- I looked at the recipe about 4 times to make sure I was not omitting liquid because of how thick the batter is.  I baked them in an 8" square pan and also omitted the topping as we are planning to eat them with ice cream on top!!

I was pretty happy with the end result, but after reading other reviews, I, like many others, made some changes to the original recipe. I decided to make a double batch, so I doubled everything except for the sugars - I only used 3/4 cup of each. I increased the apples to 3 cups, but next time I think I would use at least 4 cups for the double batch. I think that in the future I might add some oatmeal as well. I also added 1/4 cup of apple juice, and instead of doing the cinammon sugar topping, I did a streusel topping of 2 Tbsp flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinammon, and 2 Tbsp cold butter. The streusel wasn't very impressive, though, so I ended up topping the bars with cream cheese frosting and then sprinkling them with cinammon. The bars stuck to the pan (even though I greased it) and crumbled some, but they ended up tasting pretty good.

Good bars with a brownie-like texture.  Next time I'll use a Granny Smith and halve the cinnamon sugar topping.

I have made these 3 times to all rave reviews! I have always doubled the recipe and greased an 7X11 pyrex each time. My daughter does not like walnuts so I increased the apples the one time I didn't add walnuts. They were perfect each time. It is okay to top with cinnamon sugar to taste. We have done a little and a lot and again, either way they were delicious!

"They're the tastiest apple cinnamon bar I've ever eaten" from my boyfriend... good thing I doubled the recipe! The only change I made was I left the walnuts out and added a bit less sugar. Delicious! Thanks!

This was Soooo good! I was weary about the thickness of the batter as i was making it. It looked more like a cookie dough batter- very thick. I re-checked the recipe and proceded on. I used an 8x8 glass dish. I can only imagine how thin it would be if i used anything bigger. I used 1 granny smith apple. The end results were AMAZING!!Very moist and delicious! I was thrown off by the term "bar" being used for the recipe. Nothing like a "bar" at all. Mine was more cake like. 5stars for sure!

THEY WERE VERY GOOD AND MOIST BUT THE TOPPING OF CINNAMON AND SUGAR IS WAY TO MUCH.. WHEN YOU GO TO GET A BAR TONS OF THE EXCESS CINNAMON/SUGAR MIXTURE SPRINKLES OFF.. SO I WOULDNT USE AS MUCH AS IT SAYS.. BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE GOOD.!

These were AWESOME!!  My 5 year old absolutely loved them.  I also added extra apples and cut down on the sugar and I didn't add the sugar and cinnamon on the top.  I will defintely make these again.

Very good, and healthy too.  I made a few changes to make it even healthier.  I trippled the apples, halved the butter, and added half a cup of applesauce.  I also replaced the white sugar with Splenda for baking.  Turned out well, but next time I will not add so much splenda because it tasted a bit too "fake" sweet.

I used half WW flour, applesauce for the butter, flax and water for the egg and used one big Crispin apple and these came out perfect. I took them to a dinner and someone ended up stealing the pan and eating the last third of it by themselves. The cinnamon could be increased if you like cinnamon, but otherwise it's not too strong at all.

REALLY GOOD!!! I followed this recipe almost exactly (I added more chopped apples than called for) and it turned out soooo good.  My boyfriend absolutely loved these, and I would not change a thing (except for the addition of about a quarter to a half more apples).

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly. Thought they were good but not very thick. This time I doubled the ingred and used a 7x9 pan. I used 3 apples and increased the cinnamon and added a little nutmeg. Did not double the topping, though. We like them much better as they didn't fall apart like the first batch did. Good basic recipe.

These apple "brownies" were great a few minutes out of the oven and the next morning too. I did cut both the sugars by a few tablespoons each. Next time I will also cut the topping in half.

This is kind of a strange recipe. I followed it as written, and the "batter" was really thick and grainy, so I thought the cake/bars would be really dry, but it turned out pretty raw and gooey--not in a very pleasant way. I cooked it the full length of time, and perhaps should have gone longer, but it was looking kind of crunchy on the outside (which it was). It was also way too sweet, and I'm not one to be put off by sweet desserts. so, I will probably be looking for another recipe rather than trying to tweek this one.

I made these and they turned out very well. I agree that less sugar could be used and I'd increase the amount of apples. But for a first try making this, I brought them to my work bake sale and they were all bought right away.

Good recipe.  Like other folks have said, I put in half the amount of sugar and I added 2 cups of apples.  (Left out the nuts as I'm allergic).  Instead of the nuts I added a handful of raisins.  The bars turned out great!  They were gone in less than 2 days.

I was trying to use up apples we had picked and am I ever glad I found this recipe. EVERYONE who has tried it thinks it's delicious !! (Especially warm).It's moist, chewy and easy, as well as convenient since all the ingredients are staples. My boyfriend said he wished we had vanilla ice cream, but it's great just as is.Thank you for a keeper!

Phenomenal!  So quick and easy.  I doubled the apples and nuts and added 1T water because the batter was so thick.  I could eat the whole batch myself, but I would have to wrestle for it!

I have made this several times, and they are great.  The only problem I seem to have is getting them out at the right time.  They are usually either slightly undercooked, or slightly overcooked, but either way, they are still good.

I've made these several times now.  They are always a big hit (had requests for them for certain functions).  I put in more than the half cup of apple the recipie calls for and it's one of the best things you've tasted with apples and cinnamon!

I used 1cup chopped apples & added 1/4cup rasins. Also added a pinch of mixed spice. I thought that the batter was too dry, so mixed in 1/4tbsp milk. It was perfect. Thank you BarbiAnn for a wonderful recipe.

I am not a huge fan of apples but my little one is so...I made this last night and I ended up being the one that ate most of it. It was a hit in my house and I wish now that I had doubled the recipe...next time I will for sure  :)

These were really good.  I think the added sugar and cinnamon on top make it too sweet, though.  I also cooked them for about 40 minutes.

These are yummy, easy to make and quick also. I made these for an office picnic lunch. They were a hit. I doubled the apples---I like big apple chunks :)Also, they are a little sweet. Either eat them in small portions, or cut back a little on the sugar. I also add a little almond extract and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg for extra special flavor. They are always a hit at church too.

The flavor of these squares was AWESOME! However, I took the one reviewer's advice and doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan... DO NOT DO THIS!!!! They cooked improperly and were hard as rocks!! However, the flavor was excellent. I took these into work and all the girls loved them, and told me to try again using the original measurements and 9x9 pan. Great recipe – I botched it, but will definitely try again!

These were great! I left out the nuts, and they were still tasty. Super easy. Could probably be doubled in a 9x13 pan with no trouble.

Thank you BarbiAnn for a great easy recipe.  I have apple trees and was looking for ways to use up all these Jonathons.  Wow.  I just made a pan and they are gone, so I'm going to triple the recipe and send some to the office with my husband.  And in the morning we're having omelettes, coffe, and your apple squares.  Thanks

Very good, especially warm!  I had a couple Granny Smith apples to use before they spoiled.  I found this recipe and had ingredients on hand except had to sub in Pecans.  I doubled recipe as others mentioned and kept
The cinnamon sugar topping per original recipe and did not double.  It was perfect!

It was very tasty. I made 1.5 recipe in a 9×13 glass pan, used a little bit less than 2/3 cup of white sugar plus a tbsp of molasses, 1.5 cups apples, 2 tbsp of apple juice and 0.5 tsp of cinnamon. I topped it with a cream cheese glaze (30 gm cream cheese, 45 gm butter, 1 tbsp milk, 2/3 cup icing sugar, 1/8 tsp of each salt and vanilla)

My job has a get-together each month to celebrate everyone who had a birthday that month.  I don't usually bring items that I haven't tested before but after reading all the wonderful reviews, I took a chance and made this recipe.  It was a huge hit!!  And the aroma......yummmm.  The only changes I made were to omit the nuts due to co-worker allergies, so I doubled the apples.  I minced the apples so there were mini pieces everywhere!  I've already shared the recipe with 4 co-workers.  After my kids tried it, they insisted I make it just for them.  Thank you for an awesome and easy recipe.  This is now in my steady rotation of go-to desserts :)

Made this yesterday with apples we picked from an orchard. these are quite yummy. I love that they have a brownie texture. i doubled the recipe bc i didnt have a 9x9 pan.  i also used chopped pecans bc i didnt have any walnuts. I also didnt read correctly and instead of topping the squares with sugar and cinnamon I mixed those ingredients in with the chopped apples and pecans ..was delicious.  using the brown sugar makes these nice and chewy.  super good.

These turned out well.  I enjoyed it for dessert although my husband wanted it for breakfast instead!  I doubled the recipe and used 2 whole apples (golden delicious).  I did not double the walnuts because they aren't my favorite.  The only edit would be to reduce the topping (to the original recipe amounts) because it was too much.  Baked in a 9x13 pan.  I will definitely make these again.

i made this in an 11 X 7 pan since i didn't like how thin the cake in the picture looked.  i also doubled the ingredients.  it was more cake like that way.  i didn't think it was overly sweet. everyone liked it. the apple pieces did float to the top . i baked it for 25 minutes and it was just right.  will be making this again.

It was really good but next time I'll add less sugar. Maybe 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of half a cup.

OMG!  Dangerously delicious!  So easy.  Made it with pecans because that’s my preferred nut.  Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9X13.  My husband and I can’t leave it alone.  This is a great go to recipe for a take along to a picnic, work or family gathering.

First time making these. I took the advise of others who made these. I doubled the recipe except for the topping. It was quick  and simple. In the end they came out great and we're loved by all. Thank you!!!

I doubled the recipe and added another egg and 1/2 cup milk because, as it's written originally, it was too dry to work with and it crumbled.  Fixing it the way I did filled a 9x13 glass dish and it baked up like a cake.  Serve it with french vanilla ice cream and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!

This recipe was so easy and much better than I expected! I didn't do step one... I stirred in the salt, baking powder, and cinnamon after the butter/sugar step. Then the flour. One bowl! I used canned apples, drained. So delicious! !

I doubled the recipe and cooked in 9x13 cake pan. Didn’t use much of the topping and it was delicious!  Took about 15 more minutes to cook. I will definitely be making this again!

Easy to make, and the kids liked it, but the adults found it too sweet. Second time I made it I left out the white sugar and only used brown in the dough. Much better.

Well, first I doubled the recipe and spread it in a 13" x 9" pan. Then I followed other readers advice and cut back the sugar (3/4 amount of brown and 1/4 amount of white) and doubled the apples. I also lightly sprinkled the topping over, so didn't use all of it. It was still plenty sweet, I think next time I will cut the brown sugar back even more.  It baked up beautifully and tasted great, but had to give it 4 stars because of the changes.

I read some reviews. I doubled using 3/4 cup of each of the sugars. Forgot to add the apples, so we pushed them down into the dough. Halved the cinnamon/sugar mixture, and placed on top. Drizzled caramel sauce over top when first out of the oven. Yummy goodness. And easy too!

4.5 stars.  Overall, we thought these very tasty.  The next time, I will reduce the amount of cinnamon/sugar on the top, it seemed to be too much.  It would probably be good to frost these as many other reviewers did.  I would make these again as it proved to be a quick dessert.

I gave ti 4 stars as is, but I give my version a 5. My changes are a merger of several other suggestion and some experimenting. All of the "failures" were eaten with gusto. My take was to basically double the ingredients, bumped the  apples up to 2 1/2 cups (2 large), and baked longer in a 9 X 13 pan. This makes a thicker and moister version.

Deicious!  Delicious!  Delicous!  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!  I followed the recipe as written except I didn’t mix the nuts into the batter as some family members don’t like nuts.  What I did was sprinkle only half the top of the cake with nuts and left the other side unadorned.  Fabulous taste and texture.  Can’t wait to make it again!

We really liked this recipe! I didn't use nuts because I'm allergic, but the taste was still great. I only gave 4* because unfortunately I found that there was way too much topping (cinnamon and sugar)...it was just loose and falling off, which I didn't like. When I make these again, I would only make a half or quarter of the topping mixture.

I made this dessert for my brother, they devoured the whole pan. The squares were stuck to the pan because I forgot to spray it. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. We l absolutely loved it and I love using this app.

Delicious! Instead of mixing the nuts into the batter, I chopped them up fine, mixed them with a caramel glaze, and spread them over the top of the cinnamon/sugar topping. Oh. My. God. My picky 7 y/o couldn’t stop eating them... and neither could anyone else! Mmmmmmmm...

Love this recipe. I tripled the recipe but only used 1 cup each of the sugars, added a pinch of nutmeg to the flour mixture, 2 cups chopped apple. Spread in 11x16 sheet pan sprinkled cinnamon & sugar mixture topping with chopped walnuts. After cooling drizzled glaze over. Will warm and top with whip cream to serve if no glaze. Will make again.

This has a good balance of sweet and wholesome. I did sub 1/2 the flour with whole wheat.

These turned out really good. I took them to a potluck and received compliments. Some people thought I bought them at a bakery and were surprised when I told them I made them.  However, the batter is really difficult to work with as it is very very thick. It was a bit frustrating to mix and then try to spread into the pan. For those reasons I give this a 4 out of 5 stars, and probably won't make them again just because of my own lack of patience. The bars were incredibly delicious though.

Loved these bars. I made 1 & 1/2 the recipe , by scaling to 24 servings and baked in a 9 X 13 pan.
So I upped all the ingredients accordingly, except the white and brown sugar and the topping. I kept those  the same, meaning that I used less sugar in the batter and less topping.
I took half of these bars to a get together with 4 other ladies , who also brought some home made sweets. My container was the only one that left the place empty !  Everybody loved these apple squares..

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed  the suggestions of others and doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan, added one more apple, added a bit more cinnamon  and used less sugar.  Took to work, everyone raved about it and the squares were gone before the end of the work day.  A co-worker requested the recipe for a dinner she was hosting the next day.  I will be making this again!

Apple Squares! Loved these things!  1   what Would I change about them? Cut the measurement for the topping sugar/cinnamon mixture in half ( way, way too much) and i would cut the apples up a tad smaller than I did

Nice recipe.  Used leftover southern fried apples (decreased cinnamon because of this) from this site.  Decreased the sugars to 1/4 cup each as suggested by others.  I may use dark brown sugar next time.  Batter was thick and rich tasting.  Almost like applesauce cake.  Didn't use cinnamon and sugar sprinkle on top.  May make a light cinnamon glaze instead.  Thinking about trying this with leftover candied yams!  Turns out fine with a heavy cake/pie pan in a toaster oven.  Decease temp by 50 degrees and may be ready with less time.

I give it 5 stars after the changes.  I used the most popular/helpful review for a jumpoff point.  The size pan I had available is 10x15x1/1/2 cookie sheet (lined w/ parchment paper).  I tripled the dough recipe (expect for the sugar-- I used ½ c of white and brown sugar).  I chopped 4 good sized apples (2 granny smith and 1 braeburn and 1 gala) That's about 4 cups of chopped apples.  I did not season these.  Next time I will season w/ cinnamon, a bit of sugar, nutmeg, allspice and bit of lemon juice so the bars won't be so bland tasting.  I only used little cinn/sugar topping per other reviewers suggestions. I followed the basic method for combining ingredients. Smooth out in the pan.  Try checking as early as 20 min for the proper cooking time.  It should just sping back when you touch it.  One reviewer described these as "apple brownies"  --that's pretty accurate.  Holds in refrigerator in a plastic container for days and-- moist and still a bit cakey-  still taste great.

It's pretty good. I drizzled some frosting on them after they came out of the oven. I don't know if I got the consistency right, but the end result was a great flavor stuck in a strange consistency

SO GOOD!
I added more apples and it was extra-sweet! If you double the recipe, you'll get very thick apple squares, and can bake them for 25-30 minutes.
These apple bars were great and, the first night I made them, they only lasted about an hour!

I have made these squares for everyone I know (they become OBSESSED & ask me to make them a pan haha) so I consider myself an expert! I have made them as-is, wi/o nuts, w/pecans, as a vegan dish (sub 1/8c cinn. applesauce per 1egg, 3/4c olive oil sub milk OR use same amount coconut milk or rice milk) but the secret ingredient, hands down, is cinnamon applesauce. When I first made the recipe (as-is) I had to add an addtl egg because mixture looked dry. The addtl egg did add moisture but squares were still a tad too dry. Not a lot but just enough that my family noticed. The next time I made them, I subbed 1/4c cinn. applesauce for the 2eggs & that did improve the moisture somewhat. Also, I didn't care for the texture of chopped apples so I switched that to grated. I kept tweaking it slightly every time I made them & now, my literal 10th time making them, I finally have a mix that I'm personally very happy with! It's not radically different from the original recipe (the original is AMAZING & I thank the poster for this!) but here is what has worked best for me: Double entire recipe for 11x9 pan, Use heaping TSP of cinn. in dry mix, Use 1/4c cinn. applesauce in place of two eggs. Use heaping TSP of vanilla extract, add 1/8c cinn. applesauce to batter once dry & wet is mixed, grate apples w/large grater (looks like shredded cheese), fold apples into combined mix. Mix should look like cake batter w/some texture. I baked at 350 for full 30mins and it was PERFECT. A new fave :)

like others said, the consistency was kinda weird and a bit too sugary. that being said, the concept and overall taste was awesome, so i gave it a good rate. i think this would have to be modified in some way to work better. the texture was real crisp on the edges, but totally gooey in the middle. it was like should i let the edges burn or eat the middle rare? i like things rare, so i went for the latter, but they def didnt look just like the picture. my oven is a p.o.s., but i saw that others were having the same problem, and i followed the recipe to the letter.

I made theses several times and they are FANTASTIC.  A nice change from coffee cake, very yummy.

This last time I omitted the butter and used a mashed banana in its place.  My man liked them even better this way, they were more cake-like ... and lower in fat :-)

Oh my goodness these are good. I should have read the reviews before making these as I would have doubled the recipe. I wanted to send these in my son's lunch so I left out the nuts (school is nut free). I also left off the topping as they seemed to have enough sugar in them already. Next time I'll try to reduce some of the sugar as these are plenty sweet but oh so good.

These were a huge hit at the office! Here's what I did: I doubled the recipe (but not the topping) and used a 9x13 dish to yield 24 squares. I used 4x the apples (about 2 cups), coarsely chopped (about 1/4-inch cubes). I left out the walnuts. I baked for 30 minutes. They were dense and moist, just the way I wanted. I would absolutely make these again and again.

We loved it! I doubled the recipe and then doubled the cinnamon, so it was more of a cake than a bar. It took 40-45 mins. to fully bake. I substituted coconut oil for butter, and substituted half brown sugar and half powdered sugar instead of white sugar (because I don't buy it.) Instead of the topping suggested by the recipe, I made a butterscotch drizzle with 2T. coconut oil, 2T. brown sugar and 2T. cream, brought to a boil for 1-2 mins. then added 1t. vanilla. Added powdered sugar and whole milk until desired consistency and let sit for half hour to thicken while the cake cooled.

This was a really yummy cake. I  doubled the recipe and added about 1/2 cup of blueberries, only because I had some that needed to be used up today. I also only used half of the white sugar. I used a 9 x 13" pan. It turned out very well. Everyone in the house really liked it.

Delicious ! Yummy, chewy, nutty Apple bars! I spooned whole wheat pastry flour into a 1 cup measure, added almost a whole teaspoon of cinnamon because I love cinnamon and they turned out great! At first it looked like it wasn't enough batter  for 9"pan but while they baked they spread out & baked up perfectly delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had just the right amount to use up. But walnuts would be just as delicious. I skipped the sugar & cinnamon topping it was not needed

I didn't need all the cinnamon and sugar topping.  Mine was a little softer than I expected, so it didn't cut well, but it was still very good!  I had to plate them as piles instead of squares :-P.

I was hankering for dessert and did a search based on the ingredients that I had in my cupboard.  I found this recipe.  Made a few modifications:  I put a whole apple (I think 1/2 cup ended up being 1/4 of an apple) and used almonds (didn't have walnuts).  I also sprinkled about 1/4 of the sugar and cinnamon mixture...thought it would be way too sweet otherwise.  This turned out to be a good decision.  Dessert was moist and not too sweet.  The almonds were a little hard so walnuts or pecans would probably be better but I still loved it and would definitely make it again!

This was very tasty, but in my opinion.... there were not enough apples in this cake, compared to the amount of cake!  Next time I'll use a WHOLE (very large) apple, not only 1/2 of an apple.  I liked that it was very easy to make, and also tasty.

I have made these several times, they are very good!! Definitely use butter, NOT margarine, and omit the salt if using salted butter. I also use 4x the apple - 1-1/2 cups chopped & 1/2 grated (granny smith). Cook time 30-minutes. Perfection.

These are delicious. I doubled the recipe, reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 c. and white to 1/2 c. Used about 2 1/2 cups of chopped apples (did a small dice instead of slices) and was done at 30 min. even though doubled. Served with a locally made caramel/sea salt ice cream-so good! Oh, I did not double the topping however, the original amount called for is PLENTY for a 13x9 pan! If I was making the called for size I would cut the topping in half!

Delicious, sweet and made the house smell wonderful!  Doesn't need much sugar (use 1/4c both of white & brown sugar). I followed other reviewer's advice and cut the cinnamon sugar topping in half and added 1.5c or 2 small granny smith apples. Baked for 30 minutes then turned off oven to leave in for 2 more minutes. Careful not to overbake!

I have made these at least 10 times now. I cut one star because it is too sweet  and not enough apples in it. I found that 1/3 of brown and 1/3 of white sugar gives the perfect sweetness. I also add 1 cup of gala apple. Also cut the topping in half and make it in an 8 inch pan.

I altered the recipe per other's advice,  but my review is based off how it should've turned out...not the way mine did.  I guess this is a lesson:  if you alter the original recipe, use your common sense a bit.  I added maybe 3 c of apple (everyone said more).  Of course I had doubled the recipe, but with that much apple, I had to make another half portion of just batter.  Now I'm putting it in my pyrex dish...by the way, no one mentions how difficult the batter was to mix in with the apples/walnuts...and set the oven, and don't check back til 30min post.  At that point, the exterior is a gorgeous just past gold, but the middle does not look set.  I put it in for another 10min.  Now the exterior is more brown, and it looks ok enough to take out.  Unfortunately, once cooled, the middle was still barely solid.   I did try a corner piece which was nice and crunchy and good.  But back into the oven for the rest of it, this time covered in foil for another 30...Anyways, the end product led someone to ask me if I had tried to steam the cake to make it healthier.  What?   Hindsight and all, I should've baked lower and slower.  If there is a next time, I'll be sure to watch it more closely.

Love these bars. My first batch, I added condensed milk on top of the sprinkled cinnamon (& no additional added sugar.) It gave it some moisture.  My second batch, I replaced the white sugar with apple sauce. Both great.

Just made it and the vultures where on it as soon as it came out of the oven.  Everyone loved it.
doubled the recipe but didn't use all the topping.
I don't like walnuts so used pecans that's all I changed.

Doubled the recipe and cooked in in a 9x13 pan. They were delicious. I don't usually make "bar" recipes so I was a little worried that the batter was too thick. Didn't need to worry, they came out great.

Love this recipe! I've made this many times including the original which is great! I used the other comments to adjust more to our tastes like 3/4 cup of both sugars and 2 apples. I always make a double recipe. I also add 1/2 cup of chunky applesauce to keep it moist. I leave off the crumb topping but sprinkle just a tiny bit of cinnamon and make a drizzle out of confectioners sugar and milk and drizzle it on when I take it out. My oven runs hot so it only takes 23 minutes. I can't go by the toothpick test...it's not moist if I do. I took a photo in the pan because once I cut it, it's gone!

These are delightful.  I followed the recipe with 3 exceptions. I doubled the amount of apple.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I used the Pampered Chef deep dish baker instead of the 9x9 pan.  They are chewy and moist and flavorful - a little bit like a blondie with apples inside.  They go together quickly and give a great return on your time and ingredient investment.

One apple yielded 1 cup chopped apple.  I used the entire cup but beyond that I followed the recipe exactly.  Cooking time was accurate.  I added a glaze and served warm with sea salt caramel ice cream. YUMMY!!  This was a big hit with guests.

It was very easy and I will make again and again.

Delicious! Like apple pie but easier. I would leave walnuts a bit bigger for more texture. Also, they should be eaten within 2 days or they get mushy.

This recipe was absolutely the best...easy to make!
I doubled the recipe and used an 11x15 glass dish.
I took it to the teachers and they loved it!  Will definitely make this again. I bake at 350 for 36 minutes.

Love this recipe. I doubled the recipe each time using a 9 X 13 pan. The first time I made it exactly as posted and it was delicious. The second time I made one small change. I added the apples & walnuts to the wet mix and then added the flour mixture. It was much easier to mix and made no difference to the delicious outcome. I had a bushel of apples to use up so I'm making Apple Crisp, Apple Sauce,  I made 4 trays of the Apple Squares. Cut them into 12 servings a tray. Placed each individual serving into a sandwich bag (not good for freezing, but read on) and placed them in the freezer. Once frozen I put them all into a couple of large freezer bags and voila! Individual bits of heaven whenever you want them. Once they are thawed I heat them up just a tad and garnish with a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. I guarantee that I will be making these for years to come.  Thank you BarbiAnn.

I made these squares for Thanksgiving & everyone absolutely loved them!  Half a cup of chopped apple seemed a little light to me, so I doubled it.  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts, & I actually blended them in the food processor so the crunch would spread out more evenly in the bars.  They turned out great!  Highly recommend this recipe!

I made this exactly as listed, but I did as others suggested and used an 8 inch square pan, not the 9 x 13. It is absolutely delicious. ( I have a gluten allergy so I used gluten free flour and it was still perfect.) I wouldn't change a thing.

These were fabulous.  I had actually had them before when a friend made them and brought them to a pot luck.  I was impressed by their brownie-like texture, as most other "apple brownie" recipes come out cake-like when I make them.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 7 1/2" x 11" pan, used half whole wheat flour (out of necessity - was low on all-purpose) and added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  These are to die for.  Taste even better the next day, plus they freeze beautifully.  Dough is a bit sticky to work with - I pressed it into the pan with wet hands.  But totally worth it!

Definitely a keeper! I'm not big on overly sweet baked goods so I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar, left the walnuts out cuz I didnt have any & the strudel that goes on top. I also turned mine into a small loaf instead of bars, just need to increase the bake time to 45 mins. Next time I make this I'm going to double the recipe, add the walnuts and use brown sugar instead of white.

Like some others, I added 1/4 cup of apple juice and cut down on the sugar just a bit, though I feel like it would have been sweet enough with 1/4 cup each of brown/white sugar.  I baked for 25 minutes, added another 10 minutes, but still feel like it's a little underdone though that's my own fault for adding more liquids. Good flavor though, and something I will make again. Used an 8x8 instead of a 9x9.

Not exactly what I was hoping for. Much too doughy with not enough apple flavor. In the future I'd definitely add more apples and maybe even a little apple cider to it.

Very happy that this is a great and tasty recipe! I followed the recipe as written but like others, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup each of the brown and white sugars. I also added cranberries, extra apples (about 2 cups or 2 apples total), and a healthy handful of oatmeal. I used sliced almonds as I had no walnuts or pecans on hand.I baked for about 35 minutes and they came out perfect. This is an easy recipe with a moist and delicious result. Will definitely make again. This one is a keeper.

The basic recipe is pretty good, but I would not make it again without several changes.  After seeing how tiny the amount of batter was, I tripled the recipe (except topping) as many reviewers suggested.  I used a mixture of Macintosh and Cortland apples, less sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and baked it in a 13x9 pan with the topping, for about 40 minutes.  

I did not find that the topping fell off, but the cake itself lacked flavor.  It was plenty apple-y but needs way more than the amount of cinnamon suggested here.  I actually used more cinnamon than called for, plus extra nutmeg and ginger, but it was still a little bland.  If I make it again I will definitely triple the recipe again, using only about 3/4 cup of sugar total, and add in quite a bit more spice.  Instead of the streusel topping I would frost it with a cream cheese frosting.

Used granny smith apple.  Used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 butter.  Turned out dense/overly moist but delicious, especially with vanilla ice cream.  Make sure center bounces back after light touch to ensure it is done.  Didn't need as much topping (try blueberry muffin topping instead?)

Delish!  There's nothing better than a cup of coffee and warm apple squares on a crisp fall afternoon.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and wouldn't change a thing (except for making a double batch!).

This recipe is delicious! The only change I made is I double the recipe for a 9x13 pan and I triple the amount of apples. Makes it way more moist and a better apple flavor. I make this multiple times a year. It is highly requested!!

It was Ok but, it turned out more like apple coffee cake.  I did use Gluten Free mix instead of flour so my husband could eat it.  If I make again the next time I will use maybe 1.5 or 2 cups of apples.  I did use 1 full cup of apple and skipped the walnuts.

I wasn't quite able to spread the batter out to the sides of a 9" sq pan. It had me worried there for a bit. It was good, but was so thin. I would either use an 8" pan or double the recipe, because I'd like them a little thicker. I did omit the nuts.

I followed the advice of another that said to triple the recipe, but not the topping.  It turned out great.  I would wait until it cools to cut as it can be a bit crumbly.

I followed MJ's suggestion to triple the recipe, baked in 16" x 9" dish for 35 minutes. I also added COCONUT and I can't imagine this recipe without it. It provided a great chewy, crunchy texture. Everyone I shared this with raved about it.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts and reduced the sugar slightly. I spread it thinly to come out less cakey and more like a square. ...But coconut, people. Coconut.

These are amazing! Perfect for fall. I did tweek it a tad and added 1/8 teaspoon of allspice and 1/8 of nutmeg. For the topping I lessened the sugar and did equal parts white sugar/brown sugar and a pinch of allspice. Goes GREAT with vanilla ice cream.

This is great. I have made this three times now. Like other reviewers, I tweaked it to reflect our tastes. I doubled the recipe, reduced the sugar by half, put in a full tablespoon of cinnamon, used four cups of chopped apples (three the first time around), used the same batch of  toping on THREE double batches (I made them in very short succession, and it wasn't until today that I finally finished the topping).  Really wonderful and so easy to prepare. My family loves this. Thank you!

I cooked it 30 min and used 1 small green apple and it came out very thin and fell apart.  Topping was too much.

Love this!  I took advice and tripled recipe.  Used 16x9 glass pan.   Lined it with a light sheen of butter.  Lightly sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on the bottom and edges of pan.   Had to cook for 45 minutes and probably could have been 42 min.  Apples were diced a little smaller than recommended.   Next time I may make them a tad larger.   Made my own topping.

Doubled the recipe, except left the sugars as is (1/2 cup each). Added nutmeg. Added another cup of apple. Baked in a 9x11 pan (altered a 9x13) --- it's hard to spread. They rise and get puffy, nice thick bars.  Those who say they are "too doughy and raw" might be sifting flour and then measuring out a cup. I spoon flour into the cup and level off. Mine aren't too doughy, cooked through, and very moist. I used a combo of cortland apples diced up in 1/2 chunks and half a granny smith apple in a fine dice. Didn't top w/ cinnamon sugar but will instead make a vanilla powdered sugar thick glaze.

We made this and it was supper easy and SOOOO good! The only comment I have is to double the recipe, because the original recipe dons make that much. It took about 35 minuets for us to bake, and 20 minuets to cool. this is a fun and easy recipe. IT WAS SO GOOD

This recipe is amazing. I added a bit more cinnamon, but that's just my preference. I've made these a few times now and brought them to various events; everyone loves them! Definitely a new favourite in my books.

A very good light and tasty apple treat. I made a few substitutions to make it healthier--I used half cup whole wheat flour, applesauce in place of white sugar in the batter, and used brown sugar with cinnamon for the topping. I increased the apple amount to one cup. I also had fresh raw pecans on hand and used those for the nuts.

This was yummy!! Mine didn't look as good but tasted awesome. I did double the cake part of the recipe and used a 9x13. I also used 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp almond I did add nuts and a few white chocolate chips. Thanks.

I made it with 1/2 of the white sugar in the cake and 2 x the cinnamon in the cake, and this is a really nice square/thin cake.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was great with seconds for all!  I made it in a spring form pan lined with parchment paper and it worked perfectly...   Try this one you will like it...

I added more apple than called for but still turned out great. Not sure what I did wrong though because they ended up more flat in the middle. Still delish and everybody loves them. I used Braeburn apples but will try a Granny next time. Great recipe, thanks!

Wow!! This is really good! I made as directed but tripled the batter amount except the topping, just used the stated amount for that and it turned out great. I did top it with a powdered sugar glaze but I know it would have been good without it too.

Awesome!!!  I doubled the recipe but cut back the sugar so that I used only 3/4cup of each sugar. I used 2 cups of chopped Galas  I only used the amount of topping for one recipe and added 1/4 cup of raisins to the dough.  Baked it 33 minutes just like another reviewer and it was fabulous!!

I followed the recipe as written.  Was a big hit in my house.  Very easy to prepare and tasted great warm with a small scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt.  Added to my recipe box!

Great recipe! As previously suggested, I doubled the recipe except for the topping. Left out nuts and added a dash of almond extract. Baked at 350F for 33 minutes in a clay 9x13. It was delicious! Might add coconut next time for some more texture and flavor.

I went a little easy on the sugar, but otherwise made them according to the recipe. (Left out the walnuts, due to allergies). Thought they came out great! And so easy to make!

Excellent. Made as written except sprinkled about a teaspoon of cinnamon/sugar mixture on top and added 2 chopped granny smith apples. My oven runs hot and I needed to bake it for 40 min to get it cooked through. Delicious!!!

These are really tasty, but a bit on the chewy/dense side. Next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time) I will substitute applesauce for the 1/4 cup of butter in the hopes that it'll make them a little less dense and cut down on some of the fat.

Although I had my doubts due to it's dry batter, this turned out to be a wonderful treat. I added many more seasonal spices (as I am want to do), and made muffins instead of bars or cake. They were delicious!

I made this exactly as it is.  I doubled it so we would have more.  Everybody loved it and actually made a point of telling me how good it was.  The texture and flavour were wonderful.  This is my new go to recipe for apples.

I received many compliments from my co-workers for baking these Apple Squares. I doubled the recipe (except the cinnamon and sugar  for the topping) and baked it in a 9x13" pan for 33 minutes. As suggested by other reviewers, I used both cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices, increased the amount of chopped apples (2 medium Granny Smith apples-about 2 1/4 cups for the doubled recipe), and sprinkled the pecans on top. The next time I bake these, I will decrease the white sugar to half as they were just a tad sweet for me!  Great recipe and worth a 5 star status!!

I used a whole apple with this. Saved half of diced apples for the mix and used the other half tossing it with the sugar mixture and it turned out PERFECT. We put butter pecan ice cream on top and it was heavenly

I used 2 cups chopped apple and left the other ingredients the same. I wanted more apple and did not think I needed more dough. I think they came out delicious. Oh yeah, I also did not have baking powder on hand so I used 1/3 tsp baking soda and 2/3 tsp cream of tartar (basically the same thing chemically). After baking, I drizzled caramel syrup (the kind for ice cream) on top. Yummy!

These are good but I thought they were dense, at least for my liking. I made the dough as is, the dough is very thick and was hard to spread. I only made 1/2 the topping and it was more than enough. I think maybe doubling the recipe is a good idea if you want a higher bar.

Smell heavenly when baked. I only put 1/4 cup each brown and white, add 2 cups small diced apple. Follow the rest of the ingredients and instructions. The resalt is a bit chewy, soft, sweet just right. My husband LOVES them.

5 stars as is...even more stars with raw cranberries; used 1/4 c. each of the white and brown sugars, and 1/2 c. apples PLUS 1/2 c. raw halved cranberries.  Oh my!  Megalicious.  Loved the crust and may make muffins so each serving gets that crunchy crust.  M-m-m  Also very pretty with the red peeking through.

Delicious!  Double the recipe, and put all the dough in a 9 x 13 pan lined with parchment paper.  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  Baking takes about 35 minutes, sometimes a little longer.  I would worry more about under baking them (too gooey) than over baking (a little chewy if over baked) Made these twice in one week they were so good.  Without a doubt will make again soon.   The first time I made them I forgot to add the nuts, and just sprinkled them on top before baking.   The second time I stirred in the nuts with the apples.   I prefere them sprinkled on top..which is what I will do next time.  oh soo good.

Really moist and delicious. Doubling or tripling the apples is a must. Also, use apple varieties that are meant for baking! Granny Smith worked really well.

it was really good but i recommend putting more apples in and less cinnamon because i couldn't really taste the apples but there was a strong cinnamon taste to it.

The dough was dry and hard to mix wasn't sure it was supposed to be that way.  Made it anyway and oh was it soooo good.  I didn't change a thing and they came out beautiful and super moist and chewy almost like an apple cookie.  Yumm

These are wonderful, moist and tasty.  They have become a request at the office.  I omit the nuts because of allergies and add more apple.  This has become a favorite go to recipe.

This recipe tastes pretty good but it defiantly needs more apples and less sugar. As is the recipe is a 4/5 but with the above changes the recipe becomes 5/5! Try it how you please :)

This recipe is delicious. I am not a baker but making this was easy and the end result was delicious. I cut the sugar to just over half and felt it was plenty sweet. Will make again and will keep the sugar at 1/2 the amount called for. May add more apples.

Very versatile! Was looking to use my home canned quart of apple pie filling. So being I had lots of apple, I tripled the recipe except for the sugar. I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar being the apple pie filling had sugar in it. Also, I only doubled the sugar cinnamon topping but I could have cut it back some more. Worked out wonderfully.

I made this exactly as written, except I left out the walnuts (I would have added them, but I didn't have any and it's a snowy day here).  I was worried because the batter seemed very, very thick and I had difficulty spreading it out in the 9x9 pan.  It didn't look like there was enough batter.  However, I used my hands to spread it around as much as possible and baked it for about 22 minutes in my gas oven.  They puffed up while baking and turned out very moist. This will be a frequently made recipe in my house--we always have the ingredients.

Cannot say enough about how great these are with minor modifications. I always double to a 9x13, but the pan is lucky to last a day in our house.  I cut the sugar by half and double the apples.  A winner for our family of five.

Wow!  We love these bars.  We left out the walnuts and put in 1 1/2 cups of apples and they were fantastic.  I think next time I will make a double batch and cook in a jelly roll pan - that way they will stay around a little longer, because they go quick.

These were great!  I doubled the recipe, except for topping and omitted walnuts, for a 9x13 but added a heaping 2 cups of apples, per reviews.  Normally I would make a recipe as-is the first time, but 1 cup of apples didn't seem like enough.  Definitely making again, and except for chopping the apples, it took no time at all to make.  I want to try drizzling with either caramel or a powdered sugar glaze next time and using applesauce in place of butter.

I have made these bars with apples, raspberries and gooseberries, and I wouldn't recommend substituting the apples. The apple version was great, the others tasted funny. I'd recommend replacing at least half the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat flour and reducing the white sugar. I also found that toasting the chopped nuts before adding them to the mixture makes the bars more flavorful. Good recipe, and easy to make.

Super-simple recipe to make.  I had apples that needed to be used up and came across this recipe.  I doubled it and put it in a 13 x 9 pan.  I made half the pan with the nuts and the other half without.  Both sides were equally enjoyed.  Nice and moist with a crunchy topping.

Loved these apple bars. I left out the nuts (personal preference), used a 9x13 and doubled the recipe EXCEPT the cinnamon/sugar topping which I kept the same for the first batch I made. I felt like that was still too much topping for me (and I'm a big ol' fan of sweets!). So on my next double batch, I just sprinkled on the topping until it covered the surface of the bars in a thin layer. It ended up being only about 2/3 of it, which was ideal to me. With that change, it's a keeper--disappeared in my office in record time!

I followed the recipe and instructions. They did not work at all! Thin, gummy, couldn't cut into squares to serve. I guess you could scoop them out and add ice cream. But as a cake type square, didn't work! Lora Deanne

I am giving this recipe 4 stars based on my husband eating 1/2 the pan and I just made them. They are the consistency of a brownie. I guess just a personal preference but I did not like the chewiness of them, I prefer a fruit bar with a crust, fruit layer and crumb topping. Did not change recipe and baked for 30 mins.

Really delicious!  Also easy and quick.  I inadvertently left off the sugar-cinnamon topping but the bars were plenty sweet for us w/o it.  This will be one of my go-to cookie/dessert recipes.

Very good. I used two apples (over a cup). I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I baked it until it was no longer "gooey" in the middle (about 40 minutes)

As a personal preference, I made it without any nuts.  When I make this again, I'll put a whole cup of apple in (it seemed like coffeecake, not apple) and decrease the topping.  About 50% of the topping "stuck" to the batter, the other just falls off after it was baked.  With those changes, perfecto!

This was "OK" but not great.  Too much sugar topping, for one thing.  Overall pretty bland.  Nothing I or family members would have trouble resisting or anything.  Sorry, but when I am going to splurge on treats they better be worth it!

These are amazing!!!  I doubled the recipe & replaced the flour with whole wheat but everything else was exactly the same.  We ate them with some ice cream - they remind me of cinnamon roll but in a bar form.  GREAT recipe!!!!

I made these as written, we liked them pretty well but would make multiple minor changes to further better them. Next time will follow others rec and double recipe, definitely use at least 2 and half to 3 apples, cut down sugar etc. All in all a good base recipe

I loved this!! So easy to make and just delicious!! The only changes I made,I did not have brown sugar so I used a tad bit more white sugar and some maple syrup and of course I put in about 1 1/2 cups of apples.  This was so moist and the apples were so yummy!!

I quadrupled the recipe except for the topping and baked in 3 square 8 in pans. I also increased the amount of apples like other reviewers did. I used 6 Gala apples total. I don't care for apple desserts, but these were phenomenal.

I took the advice of several other reviewers and doubled everything but the topping and baked it in a 9x13" pan. I am glad I didn't double the topping. As it was, I used only half of it, as it would've been overwhelmingly cinnamon-y if I'd used it all (I just sprinkled it on until the top was totally covered and then stopped). I had no walnuts so I used pecans instead and they worked great! I think I might prefer them to walnuts in this recipe, actually. It might be a little dough-y and chewy, but I think that's how it is supposed to be. I don't get the idea that this is meant to be a cake. It looks and tastes like an apple pan cookie to me.

Always a hit when I serve this. I usually substitute half the white flour for whole wheat. The kids don't notice a thing. Warning - this is very sweet, particularly if you are using sweet apples, like Gala. Still it is very tasty.

Pretty good. I had to sub walnuts for pecans because that's all I had. I wish I had a kitchen blow torch to melt the cinnamon/sugar topping just to see how it turned out but the topping was fine the way it is.

It is really dense but still amazing. Mine seemed to take a bit longer than 30 minutes. It was probably closer to 40 minutes and could have easily baked another ten or so more. It just seems to have a really soft fall apart texture otherwise. Will totally make again though as it was really yummy. Made exactly as stated

My Dad loved these apple squares,  so he would give them a 5 stars,  I thought they really needed vanilla ice cream with them, which I didn't have, they are very sweet,  I thought they were going to be more chewy, but mine were more cake like.  If I make again, I will tried and tweet it so they will be more chewy.  I also had gala apples which I added a large tablespoon of lemon juice to them after I cut them up and stirred it up to make them tart tasting.  I also only lightly covered them with cinnamon sugar like other reviewers suggested.

Didn't have nuts on hand so made it without.  Also, as per other suggestions, didn't add the sugar or cinnamon on top.  Used about 3 cups of apples and it was amazing! Moist, just sweet enough

Delicious dessert.  I swapped pecans for the walnuts, and substituted half the AP flour with whole wheat flour.  Next time I'll try reducing some of the sugar as it is really, really sweet.

Loved this recipe. Has a lot of room to play with it. Next I will be trying this one swapping the apples and walnuts for cherries and chocolate chips. Love recipes that have a simple base and lots of room to play with ingredients and seasonings.

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy and delicious.  Based on other reviews, I cut the "sugar" in half.  I actually used maple syrup instead of sugar and the flavour was excellent.  I also used whole wheat flour, as that is what I always use, and I skipped the cinnamon sugar topping.  I will definitely make these again.

Pretty good.  I doubled the apples and cut the sugar in half.  Used applesauce as a substitute for half the butter.  Used whole wheat pastry flour for half the flour. Added 1/4 cup rolled oats.  For topping used half brown sugar/half white sugar along with the cinnamon.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. I burned it the first time and everyone still liked it. Subsequent tries were just right but some family members preferred the chewiness of the burnt version. Spices are just right; I did cut the amount of topping in half. Thanks to BarbiAnn  for a go-to recipe that can't go wrong, according to my family!

Tickled to find this delicious, baked sweet treat. A great way to get our family to enjoy more Omega-rich walnuts. Will likely cut out the white sugar next time and will triple the recipe.

These were delicious and a huge hit! Took the advice of doubling recipe and baking in a 9x13 which worked great. No need to double cinnamon-sugar topping. Do not overcook.

AWESOME! Followed directions but doubled and put in 9x13 pan. Baked about 35 minutes and when golden brown and bounced back! I used a combination of Granny Smiths and a Honey Crisp--wonderful! I then put a little carmel glaze over the top. I just thinned down the carmel apple dip you can get in the produce dept.--I took it to church council and served with a little vanilla ice cream.........RAVES! We have a new minister..I was so nervous. He LOVED it! Will make again for sure!

I made these using the changes suggested by other commenters-- doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan, used 3/4 cups of both sugars and twice the required apples.  I found it uninspiring--I thought it tasted sort of bland, like coffee cake, and not too appley, but everyone else LOVED them.  In the future I would not skimp on the cinnamon sugar topping.

Fabulous! The second time, I subbed soy flour for 1/3 of the flour, and Xylitol for white sugar. Just as good that way. Wll try subbing whole wheat flour for 1/3 next time. Oh, and I doubled it the first time, tripled it the second. No problems. Rave reviews from everyone who tried them!

I used whole wheat pastry flour, real butter, and omitted the nuts because we aren't big fans of them in baked goods.  Instead of the cinnamon/sugar topping, I used a struesel that I always keep on hand in the freezer (1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup quick cooking oats, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup butter, some cinnamon and cut butter into dry ingredients) to top it with.  Oh, and I used pear instead of apple that I just grated to save lots of time.  They are delicious, but a bit sweet.  Next time (probably again this week!) I will try using less sugar in the batter and still top them with the streusel.  These are delicious and I know my kids are going to polish these off.

In all fairness, I was unable to rate this based on the exact recipe as given due to an extreme number of food intolerances in my 10 yo, but with all of the adjustments I did for this, it turned out wonderful!  I might tweek it some, but I think it was because of my adjustments, not the original, or it wouldn't have turned out as great as it did!  It was devoured in an afternoon!  fyi, here were my adjustments: replaced flour with gluten-free mix of flours, replaced baking powder with 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar (corn intol. so no baking powder 'cause it uses cornstarch), replaced butter w/melted palm oil "ethical" veg shortening ('cause dairy intol), and replaced egg with 1 T flax see and 3 T water (egg intol).  Also added 3/4 tsp xanthum gum and 1/4 tsp baking soda due to use of gf flours.

Love this! I made almost as directed, just reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup each, because reviewers saying it was to sweet. I also used 2 Peaches instead of apples because that is all i had, and instead of the cinnamon/ sugar mix on top I made a crumb topping that I found on this website. Turned out great and I like that I can use other fruit and it turn out just as good! Definetly a Must-Try recipe!! Thanks BarbiAnn!

I followed the directions (and ingredient quantities) exactly as written and after cooling in the pan, had a big gooey mess. Nothing like 'cake' at all!  The 'goo' was way too sweet so not even like a good apple crisp.  Very disappointing after seeing all the rave reviews!

These turned out great. I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour & 1/2 c white flour then added just a bit of apple juice. I think next time I'll cut down on the sugar just a bit. My picky 4 yr old loves them! I'll be making these again.

Followed some suggestions from other reviewers... cut the sugar in half and doubled the apples, then drizzled some caramel topping while still warm from the oven.  Turned out very moist and we all loved it.  Thanks for posting, BarbiAnn.

Fantastic. I substituted Splenda and Splenda brown sugar blend, and these are the best things I have ever tasted. I agree with the person who said that if you double the recipe, do not double the topping, but otherwise these bars are amazingly good. Not to mention how good the kitchen smells while they are baking!

LOVE!  Baked this at night, which was not a good idea.  I've eaten more than I care to admit at 11pm.  Make this!  You won't be sorry.  I doubled and put in a larger pan.  Added the almond extract, otherwise followed recipe.  LOVE!!

Delicious!  Will definitely make them again.  Doubled the recipe, except for sugar.  Substituted almond meal for half of the flour, and chopped dates instead of chopped walnuts.

I love this recipe.  It's very fast to whip up. I make it without nuts for my family's preference, but I'll add almond extract sometimes.  I like to double the recipe and serve big squares with ice cream.

This was a HUGE hit in my house.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and used one whole Granny Smith apple (peeled, which is not stipulated in the recipe), and reduced the cinnamon sugar by half, and it was plenty.  I might use a little less apple next time as the texture was slightly too soft, but none the less delicious!  Best served warm with vanilla ice cream!

This was a quick and tasty recipe.  The boyfriend really likes them.  I didn't measure out the apple, but chopped up about 1 granny smith, and didn't add nuts in the batter, but some crushed pecans in the topping.  They were a little bit crumbly after cooking (and cooling) but the next day hold together a bit better.  Great apple/spice flavor.

these are AH-MAZING!!! I made them exactly as written and served them hot with vanilla ice cream on top. We all had seconds! They  are more firm the next day, (provided you have any left!), more like a brownie consistency. The topping is perfect with it and tastes like carmel. These are my new favorites!!!!

Sorry, but this was just sort of average to me...I was expecting more from all the great reviews.  Kind of like a dense apple cake in consistency.  I used double the amount of apples and half the amount of sugar, which I'd recommend.  It IS very easy to make though.

Very tasty.  Followed the recipe except I had to use self-rising flour b/c I didn't have any baking powder.  The next time I make these I will omit the cinnamon/sugar on top.  I may add a glaze instead.

These are great! I was feeding these to toddlers so I decided not to do the cinn/sugar topping, instead I drizzled with a cream cheese frosting glaze. 1/2 c powdered sugar, 2 tbsp cream cheese, 1 tbsp butter, dash of salt, and maple syrup to desired consistency for a good frosting. then I added a splash of milk to thin it out for a good drizzle. AMAZING!!!! Thanks SO much for sharing!!

I loved this squares. I pretty much had all of them. These apple squares had a brownie taste to them from the walnuts witch I am addictive to. The only thin I think could be changed is the topping. It is like a half- inch layer of sugar so if you half that I think it would be a bit healthier to eat and still have be sweet enough for the biggest sweet tooth.

I love this recipe and so does my daughter. I doubled the recipe as suggested, added about 2 cups of apples, also added a touch of almond extract. I didn't even add the sugar and cinnamon on top.

A simple, easy treat to make. These disappeared within a day of making it, all of my roommates loved it! Definitely a keeper.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  I originally made this years ago when I was first married.  The only thing I did differently then was to melt the butter in the sauce pan and then added everything to the sauce pan - just one pot to wash!  I was looking for this recipe just recently and I could not locate it - you can be sure I will be making this ASAP! 
**** I forgot to follow up after I made the apple square some time ago!  Just made another batch and they are just as good as I remember.  PERFECT FALL DESSERT!

Yummy flavor, very sweet.  I could probably get away with adding only the brown sugar and leaving the white sugar out.  I will double this recipe next time too.  I was scared that only a 1/2 C of apple wouldnt be enough, but you get the apple flavor throughout so I was happy.  WIll make again, thanks!

Wow! These are good!  Doubled the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan and glad I did, one batch would have been a tease.  Made these along with decorated sugar cookies, chocolate peanut clusters, don't know if they will last till Christmas!  Next time I will triple the recipe to make thicker bars, cut down on the sugar somewhat and they were plenty sweet.  Needed to use up some apples I had, great way to do it, thanks BarbiAnn!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added 1 cup of apples. When they first came out of the oven, I wasn't to crazy about them. But once they were room temperature, they tasted wonderful. I even put a few in the fridge and think they tasted even better the next day cold! They were very soft and chewy. Tasted almost like a mixture between an apple crumb cake and a brownie. Will definetly make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good bars.  Mine came out a little gooey, so I will increase the baking time next time.  But they were very good otherwise.

I tried these yesterday for the first time, and the whole family gobbled them up! Perfect for a cool fall day.  The only thing I changed was adding a bit more chopped apples, and I used pecans instead of walnuts, YUM.  Id suggest serving warm with cool whip or van ice cream!

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for 32 minutes.  When I tasted them I thought they were very good.   When my husband and his friend found them yesterday they devoured pretty much the whole thing!!  The key is using a flavorful apple.  I am now making my second batch in two days for our Sunday football party.  Thank you for the great recipe!

YUM! Doubled the recipe (but cut down BOTH sugars to approx. 3/4c each) and increased the apples to just over 2c. Left out the nuts. Did not double the cinn/sugar topping. Baked in 9x13 pan for 30 minutes.

YUM! love these....very simple and good. This recipe though doesnt make very much so I would double or triple it. I doubled mine, and it still fit in a 9x13 pan. Also mine needed to baked for at least 35-40 minutes. Maybe thats because I doubled it though....

I have been getting recipes from this site for a while now and have never rated one until now.  These are SO good.  I doubled the recipe, as other reviewers suggested, and made them in the morning and they were gone by the evening.  Even my picky children loved them.

Great treat and fun for the little ones to help with.  I made a few changes to reduce calories. Splenda instead of the white sugar. Brown sugar splenda instead of the brown sugar. I halved the flour (using whole wheat flour) and added oats. Increased the apples (precooked in the spices) to 2 cups and threw in a handful of dried cranberries. It makes for a quite dense, but yummy version of this bar! Thanks for the recipe.

YUM!!  The consistancy is nice, almost like a bread pudding (according to hubby).  I added more apples and cinnamon.  Next time I'm going to use whole wheat flour.  Delicious and thank you for sharing!

I tinkered with this recipe a little.  Substituting 1/2 cup of whole wheat + 1/2 cup white flour.  I added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and a drop of lemon extract to the wet.  I also dropped the sugar to 3/4 total:brown, white and turbinado sugar. For the topping I mixed 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with a combo of the turbinado sugar and white sugar (about 1 tsp. turbinado and 1 tsp white sugar.  It turned out fabulous.  My husband already devoured half the pan.  THanks for the great recipe!

The first time I made these it was for an Octoberfest party and they flew off the plate. I decided to try them for my son's football carbo cram and the boys loved them! Easy to make as well. Thanks for the recipe it's become a favorite!

This is a fantastic recipe! My neighbor came over to chat and before I knew it they were almost gone! I had to hide some for my husband! I read the reviews and did double the recipe. I used almonds instead of walnuts. I will surely make these again!

I too doubled everything but the topping and baked in a 9x13 pan. These where kinda a cross between a brownie and a cake. Very yummy autum treat.

This is an awesome recipe. My daughter (who is 5) won first place in a baking contest with this recipe. I did make a few changes: used 2 1/2 cups chopped apples and drizzled with the caramel glaze someone else suggested in a review. My daughter couldn't have been more excited about winning her first baking contest. Thanks for the recipe.

These are really good. A definite keeper. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I didn't have any nuts, so I made it without them. And I used 2 Gala apples, a little over 1 C. Next time, I'll put in another apple. If you double it, don't double the sugar/cinnamon topping, though... it does wind up being too much (I wish I'd have read the reviews & comments before I made it!). It's very sweet, very moist, and very delicious. My daughter absolutely loved it and was already suggesting when I should make it again as she ate it! A DEFINITE KEEPER!!

These are so amazing and simple to make. I had to sub cornstarch for an egg since I doubled the recipe and it still turned out awesome. I did make more of a crumble style topping with oatmeal, sugar, cinnamon, and butter which I really think adds a lot.

My apple squares are out of the oven and cooling. PERFECT!! for a first time. Followed other reviewers to cut off some sugars and add more apples. Definitely add apples to make 1 cup. Also added apple sauce to cut on butter (3 heaping tblsp) and the remaining melted butter (only 1/2 of the 1/4 cup needed). Texture is moist and dense with all the walnuts and apples coming out of it. Absolutely a make again! Cook time was 32 min.

Thank you BarbiAnn for a great recipe and thanks to the reviewers for such helpful advice.  I doubled the recipe and used two cups diced Honey Crisp apples.  baked 33 minutes as suggested in a 9x13 pan.  Next time I'll bake for an extra 3-5 minutes (they were a little too soft). Outstanding flavor!  I brought them to our annual block party and they were gone.  Lots of raves.  Our entire block thanks you!!

ASTOUNDINGLY DELICIOUS!! Deserves 10 stars! This is a keeper recipe for sure. I couldn't resist adding just a few freeze dried rasberries crumbled up into the mix. I also doubled the recipe since i was using a 9 x 13 dish. but I did not double the sugar, so AWESOME is this result! Thank You BarbiAnn!

I thought these turned out beautifully with a delicious brownie like consistantcy.  The only things I changed based on other reviews was to cut the sugars to 1/3 cup each and increased the chopped apples to 1 cup.  Wonderful recipe for the fall...I will be making again.  Thanks BariAnn :)

Really yummy! reminisant of eating cinnamon toast :) I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan and they turned out having a great brownie-like texture. As others have commented though, I wish I would have reduced the topping slightly since there ended up being a lot of spice on the top. I'm sure though that in the right size pan the topping is the perfect amount, so that mine had too much was no fault of the recipe ;p

I thought this was somewhat sweet. I would cut back on the sugars next time. Also they were hard to cut into squares. Seemed too soft. My husband devoured them though. Thanks

This is really tasty and easy to make. I had some apples at home and decided to make something apple-y. I doubled the amount of apple to 1 cup and i didn't have any walnut at home so i used 1/4 cup of raisins and a bit of oats as well. Can't wait to try it with walnuts! I'm taking it to my Bible study now!

I tried this out yesterday for a Memorial Day BBQ. I had a bag of Mcintosh apples that I needed to use, so chopped those up with one granny smith and it worked really well! Looks are deceiving - this dessert looks average, but once you pop one into your mouth, you are a true convert. I added the suggested 1/2 cup apple juice which makes it moist and gives more apple flavor and made the cream cheese topping, as another reviewer suggested. I piped the frosting on top in a streusel style. Definitely dressed them up and made them even more tasty. These are going to be part of our family recipes - esp during fall apple picking!!

This recipe is muy muy muy delicious! We, my groupmates and I made this, I picked this recipe and one of them said I could get married lol.. Anyway, this recipe is a hit to my family and friends. I myself like to think of it as a cakey apple pie. Which is a good thing. The only thing I have a question is when you put the last two ingredients.. before or after they bake?

I was a little worried after making the dough that there were too many apples, but after baking, these turned out amazing.  I like this recipe because it doesn't have a lot of butter, and because it does have a lot of apple flavor.  Sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar makes a nice crunchy topping.  These are great hot out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Almost like a "better for you" apple fritter.

Hubby and I enjoyed this a lot! I added 2 tablespoons of applesauce to make more moist and it did just that. This was something new for us to try and we really enjoyed it. Mine crumbled a bit too much I wasn't able to get perfect bars but they were tasty. I will be making again. Thanks!

Sooooo yummy! A great use of apples when you need a delish dessert but don't have any "junk" ingredients on hand!

These were ok, but I prefer apple pie more, and I'd rather make that. Worth a try though.

This is more like a coffee cake to me.  I doubled the recipe except for the sugar and it just ended up being not that full of the 'apple' flavor I was expecting.  My husband really liked it, but I didn't care for it-just ended up being dry & crumbly also.  Maybe if I were to change the recipe around a little more it would be better?

Update: I made this again today with pink lady apples. They were very good in these apple squares. I have never used the nuts because I don't like nuts in or on anything, a texture thing I guess. My husband took almost half the pan to work he enjoyed them so much. So that being said both granny Smith and pink lady apples work wonderfully. I should also say I did half AP and half WW flour and you couldn't tell at all. Love the texture with the soft,inside and slightly crusty outside with the bits of apple. Yum!

I love this recipe!!! The cinnamon gives it a nice flavor. Although I would put more apples in because you can't really taste them much.

Very yummy.  My husband loves it.  The only thing I changed the second time I made it was to add a bit more apple as I found that the taste of apple wasnt strong enough.  This also depends on the type of apple you use.

Oh these are delicious, sweet but delicious.  I love the fact they are made from basic store cupboard ingredients.   I missed out the walnuts, because I am not fond of them and used a cup of apples, simply because I used the one apple I had left.  Very moist and tasty, next time I think I will make a double batch so that I can have thicker bars.

Absolutely delicious!  So moist...I thought they were even better the next day.  I cut back on the white sugar and only used 1/4 cup, still used 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Added 2 cups of apples (per some other reviews) and omitted the walnuts bc I didn't have any.  Baked in an 8inx8in glass dish for 40 minutes.  Will definitely make this one again!  If serving to guests, I might drizzle with a confectioners sugar icing.

I was looking for ways to cook apples after a visit to a local u-pick orchard and stumbled on this.  I cooked my squares as directed, but I really disliked the texture and I would have preferred more of a dry bar.

I made this tonight and we enjoyed it .. I doubled the recipe to bake in a 9 by 13 inch pan added around one and a half cups of a granny smith apple however I did not double the sugar I added approx 1 1/4 cups total and the end result was plenty sweet.. I also made a quick glaze .. Very good thanks for an easy treat :-)

They're good. They're not as good as "Apple Bars" from this site, however, but then that recipe has double the apples, walnuts, and a 1/c cup butter, so I guess this one is the healthier version. I will continue making the other version instead of this one, however this IS a good recipe! (Yes, the batter is too cookie-like to pour. Don't add more liquid, you'll just make the squishy centered mess that other people made and then didn't like!)

Very good simple recipe. Baked 2 of these before work today and took one to the office and one to my husband's office. Great reviews. Several asked for the recipe. I drizzled with a little caramel frosting (on this site) on the top and then also took a tub of CoolWhip for those that wanted that also on their warm dessert. Not necessary but they sure loved it.  Easy to make and enjoyed by all.

These were amazing! I used 1 Macintosh apple, which was a little more than 1/2 c, & diced it small. The flavor was incredible & the testure was soft & melt in your mouth! I'd like to experiment w/different toppings other than the cinnamon sugar tho! Thank you-another favorite recipe!!!

This was my first time making this recipe. I read reviews and decided to double the recipe and add a tad more apples (like 1/2 cup more diced apple). First, the "batter" was so thick I added about 1-2T of tart cherry juice. I did not add the sugar on top - I only added some cinnamon. I used a 9"x9" square pan baked at 350. My issues with this recipe are; (1) with the doubling in that pan it took nearly an hour to bake and i had ot put aluminum foil to keep the to from burning (which worked wonderfully), (2) It was too sweet for my taste. i like sweet things in general, but I used Jonagolds and the cake was just too sweet, (3) It was too "cakey" I thought it would be more dense and bar-like but it was more cake-like and I was disappointed. They aren't horrible and I am sure my hubby will eat them as will I but if I attempt this recipe again, I will certainly need to make a lot of changes.

I also doubled the batch. Put 2 1/4 cup diced apples and only used 3/4 cup sugars.  I didn't want walnuts so I chopped up some peanuts which turned out to be a good addition.

SO yummy!  A great way to use up extra apples from apple-picking.  Had to add couple tablespoons of apple juice to be able to mix the flour into the sugar/egg mix, and it is a bit tricky getting the bake time right (all those reviewers said DO NOT OVERBAKE! so I was a little scared, esp living in a high altitude area) - I would say go with 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my volleyball team pasta dinner and the girls gobbled it up. Like many suggested, I doubled the recipe without doubling the topping and made it in a 9x13. I quadrupled the apples (but left out the nuts) so I had to up the cooking time a little, but it came out perfectly and I will definitely make it again!

This took no effort and turned out amazing!  I added a little extra cinnamon to both the batter and the topping as well as a pinch of pumpkin pie spice as well as a touch of almond extract as someone else had suggested - it was delicious!  I also decided to make it in a 10" pie dish so I could serve slices which worked wonderfully!  It goes amazing with some fresh vanilla ice cream!

Very good! I was looking for a quick, "fallish" afternoon snack to make today, and this fit the bill perfectly! I followed BarbiAnn's directions exactly, except for omitting the walnuts (I only had  pecans on hand and didn't feel they would be a good substitute) and using about 3/4 cups worth of GrannySmith apple (my large apple was well over a 1/2 cup's worth; I realized that half of it would suffice, but decided to add a tad more - and then eat the rest!). I used my 9 inch Pampered Chef stoneware baking dish for this and baked for a total of 27.5 minutes. I still think I could have baked longer, but the top was VERY brown so I decided not to.... My only suggestions (for next time!) are to double the recipe (not the topping tho) and cover with foil to prevent excessive browning. I think with these changes, my bars would turn out even better! As is, they are just too thin (IMHO) and don't hold up well once cut (they crumble easily), but that's a minor complaint that can easily be corrected by doubling the batter. Thanks for sharing your idea, Barbi :)

Well, these have been out of the oven for an hour and are almost gone! Everyone liked them. Chewy little apple treats. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 of a cup, and increased the apples by a 1/2 cup. Perfect for this time of year.

Very nice.  It does taste like a gooey coffee cake, as one reviewer mentioned.  I doubled the recipe and made it in the 9x9 pan, although I heeded other reviewer's comments about the topping and kept that to the regular amount.  Very crunchy on top and gooey, but not liquidy, and it makes for a very nice snack.  I did bake longer--about 2x as long bc I doubled it, and it worked just fine.  I put Apple Tapioca over squares for dessert tonight and felt it was lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy - this is a fool proof recipe! The whole thing was gone in just minutes, and received rave reviews. Needed to stay in the oven for about 30 - 35 minutes.

I made this today with some tweaks to the recipe. I used 1/4 c white sugar, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, and sliced one fuji apple thinly and layered it on top of the batter. I then sprinkled a mix of brown sugar, cinnamon, flour and butter over the top of the apples. Baked it for exactly 30 minutes and it was perfect!The center was moist but not mushy and it wasn't overly sweet. Soooo Good...I'll definitely make these again very soon.

I made these after getting a little ambitious about my baking with apples & purchased near 20 lbs. of apples from my local orchard. These are delightful! I changed a few things and added some other's suggestions- I subbed pecans for walnuts (just as tasty), used the cinnamon/sugar topping and made a butterscotch reduction (as suggested above) with 2 T. each of brown sugar, cream, butter, and what teeny bit of vanilla extract I had left. They came out great- gooey/cakey with the crunchy sugar topping & gooey butterscotch/caramel on top- they are not overly sweet, which is also nice. These would make a nice light dessert or go wonderfully paired with coffee in the morning.

Delicious! I followed the advice of others and left of the majority of the sugar/cinnamon topping, and it was so good I'm making another batch while the first is cooling. Yummy.

I was looking for a recipe that would only take one or two apples, and didn't make a large amount, so this seemed promising, especially since we love apple cake.  But we thought it was WAY too sweet with the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. It might be OK if that were left off entirely, or if you only use a light sprinkle of it.

DELICIOUS!!!! I added a 1/2 cup more apples (granny smith) for a total of 1 cup. Other than that followed recipe exactly. The only thing I will do different next time is double the recipe because these didnt last long at all :)

Awesome.  I left out the walnuts (personal preference) and increased the apple to 1 c.  I only wish I had doubled the recipe.

These were really good. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter and whole wheat flour instead of regular. I also used agave nectar in place of the white sugar and some of the brown. And I added some oats. The result was a cakelike bar that is very healthy too!

My husband liked them I did not. Maybe I didnt cook them all the way or what. But i followed the directions to the T and if I left them in there any longer the outside would have burnt. Outside was okay but not great. Inside was a bit too mushy for my taste.

This was delish! I suggest doubling the whole recipe except for the topping in the same size pan and adding more apples. I didn't use nuts and it turned out real moist, which is good if you usually like your baked goods moist. This is one recipe my family couldn't keep their fingers out of (:

Made these yesterday and the Husband could not stop eating these. I think the icing top would have been a better choice instead of the white sugar. I did use power sugar on top to give it some color. Next time I will do the icing.

This recipe is very good. Like many other reviewers recommended, I doubled the recipe, added more apple, but did not double the sugar/cinnamon topping - which I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugars. It was very good, thank you for the recipe!

I don't think I'll make these again.  They turned out fine, but they just don't pack a lot of flavor, to me.  The only difference I made from the original was to double it and use a 9x13.

the basic recipe is good as is...well maybe a bit on the sweet side but that is personal preference. my 2nd time making this recipe i made some changes: i double the recipe BUT left the brown sugar and white sugar the same at 1/2cup each. (note: this is personal preference), used wheat flour instead of all purpose, 1/4cup olive oil & 1/4cup applesauce, 3 medium sized granny smith apples, added some raisins. the result was an apple square that was a bit denser, lite sweet taste but totally guilt free.

made it last night-so quick and easy to prepare. hardest part was chopping the apples. doubled to 1 c (two small apples) and omitted the nuts and topping. had addictive crust on top and soft and chewy inside. definitely making again!

These are FABULOUS!  I've made them at least a dozen times this year and I have been asked for the recipe over and over.  You would think this recipe would call for a lot of apples given the flavor, but I was surprised at how little apple is actually in there.  Don't make my mistake and try to add too much more apple because then the squares are too wet and never really set up well.  Still delicious that way, but ended up needing to be eaten with a spoon and vanilla ice cream!

this was a simple (yes, even with the ingredient list that looks long) recipe that came out moist, spicy and delicious.  i increased the amount of apples (i may play with the recipe a little more to up the apples and lower the sugars) and doubled the cinnamon.  it's a winner.

I gave the recipe 4 stars because i've fixed it twice and the dish is MUCH better with ALOT more apples. I used about 2 cups. Soo yummy. I also upped the sugar a bit..and cinnamon! 
But overall GREAT RECIPE!!!

These were very good, but dry.  I doubled the recipe and maybe didn't have enough apple in it.  My son took them in his lunch for several days.  My toddlers loved them too.

I was disappointed in this recipe. If you like a snack cake dessert you will like this but I was looking for something more like a dessert bar.  Flavor was just ok.  Very easy to make.  I did add a whole apple.

I tried these and they were wonderful and easy.  I rated it 4 stars because I cut the sugar/cinnamon topping in half, didn't use it all, and still found it too sweet.  That's just a matter of taste though.  I'll just cut back more next time.  Great Recipe....thanks!

Great recipe - but way too much sugar.  I cut the sugar in half.  1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar.  The modification in sugar was perfect.  It's the perfect sweetness and not over powering at all.  You can really taste the apples. I will definetely make again and will be bringing this recipe to my cookie exchange in November.

We picked about 25 pounds of apples this weekend at a friends house so I've been working apples for 2 days. I tried this recipe to try to do a variety of different things with them. 

Like another poster I tripled the recipe and took it out before it looked quite done. 

I find the texture a bit dry and the taste a bit bland. I was concerned I'd had too many apples and it would be mushy but that wasn't the case at all.

I used an apple peeler/corer/slicer device then put the apples through my food processor to chop to get them well disbursed but it didn't seem to help.

very yummy, especially with vanilla ice cream. I doubled the recipe except the topping as others mentioned and put it in a 9x13 in. dish. These had the consistency of cake and I'm not sure if they are supposed to or not, but they were nice and moist.

This was great.  I doubled the recipe and it was still gone in a flash.  I added more apples (almost double).  Make sure you watch the time close because you do not want to over bake it.  I like it best a little warm (just pop in the microwave for a few seconds) with a little vanilla icecream or cool-whip on top.  My kids and I are making it again today and I bet it is gone by dinner.

My husband loves these. LOVE. I add extra apples because I want them to at least be a little "healthier" since he wants them so often. I find them too sweet but that's ok. It's a good portion control method :)

These are tasty!!! I baked for 33 minutes and I used 1 cup of chopped apples.  They are super moist and flavorful.  However, I had a hard time cutting them into squares...they fell apart.  Next time, I will serve this out of the pan like a cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  This one is a keeper!

This was a good base recipe and it would have been much better but it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO overly sweet!  And I have the biggest sweet tooth ever, so for me to say that really says something.  I would cut the white sugar completely. Also, I would NOT put sugar on the top....sprinkle it with cinnamon is fine. They are more like cake than bars.  I think I would make a rum sauce to drizzle over these and they would be fabulous!  Overall, TOO MUCH SUGAR!

OMG!!!  These were sooo good.  I thought that they were very easy to make too.  They just got out of the oven and thought that they were not going to live up to my expectations, but I was wrong they are great!  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Yummy fall dessert!  Used one medium apple.  I didn't have vanilla extract so I substituted almond extract and it was fine.  I'll try it with the vanilla next time.

This recipe is good. I used a 9x9 dish but doubled the recipe. I also added about 1/4 cup more apples (gala), I also used splenda (substituted it for half of all sugars it called for), bake for additional 5-8 mins. Toothpick was just gooey at the end of pick. All 6 of my family members LOVED this.

I followed recipe as written.  The family liked it, but it is very sweet and a bit gooey.

These were very good. Could be a bit sweeter I think. Next time I think I will add a little more brown sugar

Very good!  I doubled the recipe but cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (total), and used about 2 cups of chopped apples. A family hit!

I was looking for an alternative bar recipe instead of the same old brownies I always make and came upon this recipe. Wow! They are absolutely delicious. Very moist and gooey with just the right amount of apple flavor. The cinnamon/sugar topping adds an extra special touch. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Pretty good stuff. So "autumny"!  I spread it into a 9X13 and only baked it about 12 minutes.  They were yummy.  I think next time I would double it and try the powder sugar icing.  Better warmer than cooler. My guys said I better make this again and soon.

Delish! As per other reviews, I added 2 cups chopped apples, reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. sucanat, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. in the batter, added 1/4 c. apple cider and omitted the walnuts (personal preference). I baked it for exactly 25 minutes and it wsa very moist and flavorful. Next time as per other reviewers I will double or triple the recipe. It was wonderful! I just made this again with pears from our tree and it was just as good!

Delicious!! A winner in my book! Doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan, omitted the nuts, used 2 cups of chopped apples instead. Made this cake twice over the weekend and already my family is asking for it again.

I omitted the nuts because we don't like nuts in baked goods.  I have made two pans in two days, that is how good these bars are.  I used it as a breakfast food.

Four stars good. I wasn't as impressed with these as some of the reviewers who rated it more highly. They were good, but I doubled the recipe (as is just doesn't make enough). Even doubling, I thought it necessary to add an extra 2/3 cup of chopped apple (I used Braeburns). 1 cup of apples (1/2 cup in the original recipe), just didn't seem enough. And still the squares came out on the dry side. Maybe the poster should ammend her advice about waiting until they bounce back before taking out of the oven, or perhaps oven temp is too high? They can probably come out a few minutes earlier, and next time (yes I will make these again, they were, overall very good, just not what I expected) I will add more apples also. The recipe doesn't specify whether apples should be peeled first before chopping. I peeled mine, maybe that's the issue?? Did anyone else find these a tad on the dry side?

These bars are the best!!  The only thing I did differently is to add more apple, i just didn't think that 1/2 cup was enough.  I used 1 whole apple.  Otherwise, Awesome!

This was GREAT! I had to stop myself from eating the whole pan- everyone loved them! I doubled the recipe and baked in 9X13 with extra apples. So moist and the walnuts made them super spectacular! I will definitely be making them again and again

These are excellent, but I do feel they are more of a coffee cake texture than an actual square/bar texture. Unlike most reviewers, I made the original recipe for a small square pan. Per reviews, I made the following modifications and was very pleased with the result. 1.) I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup for each the white and brown sugar 2.) I used an entire apple, about 1 full cup and left out the nuts 3.) I didn't make the full cinnamon/sugar topping amount. They turned out very moist and everyone loved them. They are extremely easy to make and I will definitely make them again. Excellent for either a dessert or breakfast item.

These smelled great and tasted good, but were a total mess.  I couldn't even cut mine out of the pan without them falling apart.  I cooked them 10 minutes longer then directed and they were still gooey and too soft on the inside.  Maybe I did something wrong, but they didn't work out for me.

So good.  I just made them tonight.  There is just one piece left, but maybe not for long.  I used one whole apple (peeled, cored, and chopped of course) instead of measuring out 1/2 c. - so as not to waste part of an apple.  And I didnt have walnuts, so omitted them. They were done in my oven after about 20 minutes baking. I did reduce the amount of cin/sug topping, per other reviewers, giving it a sprinkle all over, but not a thick coating.  They were great.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making these again...and again...

LOVE these! So moist they fall apart easily but they're SO good!  I doubled the recipe, used 2 good sized apples, cut the sugars to 3/4c each (which was plenty) and added 1/4c applesauce. Delicious!  My husband would prefer this to chocolate cake!

These were outrageous!!!  I did not have any walnuts, so I just used apple and it still was great.  Definately a keeper.  I plan on making it again tomorrow for company but I will make a a walnut and brown sugar topping instead.

These bars taste even better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly except I omit the nuts due to a friend's allergy to them. The consensus is in--they're delicious!

These were a very yummy treat, but with a few changes, they could be 5 star!  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  They really are PLENTY sweet without even adding the sugar topping.  I added it, but it just seemed to kind of bake into the top of the bars - no real topping.  Next time I will definitely totally leave off the sugar topping, and probably even drop the white sugar in the bars down to 1/4 cup.  The spice and apple tastes are so delicious, you really don't need all of the excess sweetness.  The only other change I would make is to increase the apple amount, and be sure to chop them into very small pieces so that you don't end up with sort of mushy big chunks in your finished product.  Overall, a tasty recipe to try, and a great addition (with changes!) to my collection - Thanks!

Dynamite! As per other reviews, I did add 1 cup of apples. Omitted the nuts, because I didn't have any on hand, but next time I think I'll use pecans. I followed the recipe exactly except for the amount of apples, and I do think that the sugar amount could be scaled back a bit. Next time I'll do the 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only 1/4 cup of white. I also scaled WAY back on the topping, cooked it in a round, stoneware pan, and boy these turned out wonderfully. A keep for sure!

These are definately a keeper! I doubled the recipe, cut back on the sugar and added a little bit more apple. Then I just sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top. Delicious!

Great recipe, although I did make a few changes.  My kids don't like nuts so I left those out and increased the apples.  Also for the topping, I combined about a half cup flour, a couple of tablespoons of butter, 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I spread this over the top and baked.  Outstanding!

Excellent treats. Turned out very moist and flavorful. Filled my house with a wonderful apple, cinnamon smell that brought my neighbor over to see what I baked! I did double the recipe and made a 16x9 size pan. I also added a 1/2 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg. Really kicked up the flavor. Will definitely make again!

SO GOOD!  I added almost a whole cup of chopped apple and decreased both sugars a little.  Also, just sprinkled the topping on lightly.  Lovely, tasty, and easy.  Will make again.  Thanks

Added more chopped apples and trimmed back the white sugar for a more flavorful and less sugary treat.  Allow for more baking time if you double the recipe like I did.

YUM! Added WAY more apples as I prefer the fruit to mostly cake and cut each sugar in half. Super easy, super quick. Everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe and agree that you DONT need to double the topping. I was pretty conservative on it and had left overs. 
I'll be making this every time apples go on sale. ;)

these are pretty good.  i doubled the recipe, but not the topping and chopped up 2 whole granny smith apples and baked in a 9x13 as suggested by other reviewers.  however, even with not doubling up the topping, i still thought it was too much.  next time i will halve the topping so i don't feel like i'm eating a mouth full of sugar.

My family really enjoyed these but for me personally, they were way too sweet.  I used a whole granny smith apple instead of a half and only sprinkled a little of the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top.  I will cut the sugars down next time I make.  I also left out the walnuts (personal preference.)

Terrific!  Per others, I doubled everything except for the topping (kept the same), lowered the sugars to 3/4 cup each, and used 2 cups apple.  I baked for 33 min.  Go easy on the topping - you don't need to use all of it.

These were very tasty. Mine did not cook enough I think so next time I will leave in a little longer then recommended. I am sure it was just my oven. Also per others suggestions, I just sprinkled a little sugar cinnamon on top I did not use the recommended amount. Everyone loved them.

This is excellent! I just took it out of the oven and am sampling it right now... the only difference I will make next time is to greatly reduce the cinnamon/sugar topping. Even though this recipe is very good, the topping is way too sweet. The layer underneath, however, is DELICIOUS!!

Scrumptious! I followed the advice of MOMTOKTL while doubling the recipe (more apples, less sugar). I also decided to use 1/2c of toasted walnuts for a deeper, nuttier flavor. These were fantastic! I will certainly make these again. They are perfect in the fall!

It was Ok, I have had other recipes to rave about but not this one.
I doubled the recipe and added almond extract and 1/2 t. nutmeg as suggested. 3/4 c. brown suger and 3/4 c. white sugar and 2 1/4 c. chopped apples. Baked in 9 x 13 pan and sprinkled powered suger over the top while cooling. Did not us the topping the reciped suggested.

so easy to make with pantry items.  did exactly as directed in an 8x8 pan except doubled the apples.  Next time - would decrease the sugar to 3/4 c and keep the double apples.  Likely would make a double batch bc doesn't make much.

These turned out good, just very dry.  I must have done something wrong considering all the good reviews but I do not know what that could be, considering I mixed everything in the same measurements except adding more apple.  Because I don't know why mine was so dry I do not think I will make it again.

This was very good.  I made 1 slight change and that was just adding about 1/4 cup apple cider to make the mix a little more of a batter consistency.  Very good!

My 11 Year old daughter and I made them and they are so delicious. Especially when you take them out of the oven and let them cool a bit, they are out of this world!
