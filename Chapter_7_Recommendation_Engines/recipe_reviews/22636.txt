Very good flavor...SWEET, but good.  I wouldn't call it fudge though.  More like taffy.  I've been making fudge and candy for years.  I used a candy thermometer and backed it up by using the 'water' test. Still, it came out bad.  Did not set up after 2 hours in the refrigerator so I put it in the freezer for 2 hours...Still didn't set up.  I would have given this more stars had it actually been fudge.

It was ok I'm going to try it using milk to see if it turns out thicker then the regular  recipe calls for water
