These were delicious! I was a frog leg novice until today. This is simple to prepare. In fact, I blogged about this recipe. The only change I made was to add a little water to the beaten egg. I'm not sure it would coat an entire pound of frog legs otherwise. One part of this recipe puzzled me: it calls for chili paste or chili sauce. After getting some guidance on the Recipe Exchange, I went shopping for some Asian Chili Sauce. I bought two types, sweet and hot, divided the sauce, and made some of each. Both were delicious. I will make this recipe again, even though I couldn't convince any one else to try it. Maybe next time!

Good. Really good. Four middle school aged boys at home and they loved it, especially the dipping sauce. Very tasty!

It was good.  Best to eat fresh though.

I loved this recipe. I made it exactly as stated (or as closely as I could) with the exception of adding a pinch of ginger to the marinade. I don't know if it made a big difference or not. I do know that this was as close to what I get at the buffet as I have come. Next time I am going to try adding just a bit of white pepper to the egg mixture.

I tried to add a good photo, but just end up with the same photo same size duplicated...sorry

Had to have been the cornstarch. Plus makes the oil really dirty after 2 set of legs. Now I had some thick 5lb's of legs, but there was no flavor. Dipping sauce tasted like soy sauce. Not a fan. L from FL, repin Cajun cafe on the bayou.. park blvd. From the Gulf. sorry.

My boyfriend and I tried this. We weren't impressed. It tasted very fishy. Maybe we got old frog legs. Or maybe we don't like frog legs since neither of us have had frog legs before.

I love it! The seasoning was excellent! I just
 realized I forgot the cornstarch,but it was minor. The dipping sauce is too salty so I added more sugar.
