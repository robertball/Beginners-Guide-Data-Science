This is yummy. Sort of a pie, sort of like a pudding. This reminds me of a dessert called chocolate lush. I made this for my hubby's birthday instead of a cake since he isn't a cake eater but loves cheesecake, pudding and parfaits. I used 2% milk and chocolate pudding mix since he doesn't like coconut either. This was really simple to prepare and just took a bit of time is all. Could be done with any flavor of pudding. This makes a huge pan and could serve 12 easily. Thanks for sharing this delightful dessert recipe.

THIS IS A NICE CHANGE WITH THE COCONUT PUDDING (I ADDED FLAKED COCONUT TO THE PUDDING TO ADD SOME PUNCH) BUT I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS WITH CHOCOLATE PUDDING & THE REAL NAME IS NOT "MOM'S TEXAS DELIGHT", IT IS SLUSH CAKE. IT WAS FAMOUS AROUND THE 70'S & WAS ORIGINALLY MADE WITH PISTACHIO INSTANT PUDDING----BUT MOST PEOPLE PREFERRED CHOCOLATE.

I have added canned crushed pineapple to this, just drain the pineapple well and spoon over the cream cheese. I have used Bananna pudding adding sliced banannas.

This has been my all time fav. desert since i was like 10 years old.  This is the best!!  You have to use Chocolate pudding though.  Never heard of using coconut cream pudding, but maybe i will try it sometime.  But for sure try it with chocolate pudding, its classic.  Oh and it is even better if you use dream whip, instead of cool whip.  Depends on your preference.

I love love love this recipe!!  I've made it a couple time as written, and I changed it up a little and used a traditional graham cracker crust (pecans can get a little expensive).  I love them both!!

I make this with white chocolate pudding and a layer of chocolate fudge pudding, and when you add the rest of the whipped cream i top it off with walnuts (chopped) and chocolate shavings,  a beautiful dessert to bring to gatherings.

Be sure to try this with the coconut cream pudding--it "makes" the recipe.  This just isn't as good with banana cream pudding; and, although a chocoholic, I've never made it with the chocolate pudding.  Pistachio--that I'll have to try!

This recipe is delicious and a hit at potlucks.  I use chocolate pudding instead of the coconut, but that is the only variance.  Try this - you'll love it!

Tasty dessert!  I made one and a half times the amount of crust because I can never seem to get the crust spread out in a 9 x 13 inch pan and another half recipe of crust was just enough for my pan.  I compared this recipe with other pudding desserts and others call for 3 cups of milk with 2 boxes of pudding.  I compromised with 2 1/2 cups of milk which seemed to be just right.  I topped mine with toasted coconut pieces.  This is a nice dessert and a change of pace from chocolate.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been making this for years with butterscotch pudding. This year there is a new flavor "Pumpkin Spice Pudding" a limited edition flavor for the season by Jell-o. I would suggest stocking up on it for the year. It makes this dessert "THE BEST EVER"

great base recipe.  I added crushed pineapple (drained) into the cream cheese layer.  And I doubled the size of the crust (2 sticks of butter, 1/2 cup of pecans, 1 1/2 cup of flour, and 1 package (6 graham crackers) of graham crackers to make the crust thicker - I think this really helps to add sufficient texture to this recipe.

Would be a five star with a few edits.  I double the pudding and cream cheese mixture, use Dream Whip instead of frozen whipped topping, top with toasted coconut and chopped pecans, and use a Nilla Wafer crust on this one.  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vanilla-wafer-crust/

This is an excellent recipe, our family has been making it since the early 1970s.  The changes we made were to use real whip cream and to make the Coconut Pudding from scratch.  Has been a family favorite for nearly 40 years.  Either way it is just great.

I have made this type of recipe before but used pistachio pudding, which is a big hit. I tried this tonight and it was good but next time I will add another box of coconut cream pudding and a cup of milk to the third step. The cool whip and crust outweighed the flavor of the coconut pudding. This would be a great recipe to bring to grad party's or family gatherings because it goes a long way. BUT....add that extra box of pudding and cup of milk!

Delicious! After the first two layers, I added a layer of TOASTED COCONUT AND TOASTED CHOPPED PECANS, this added a depth of flavor and crunch. Then I topped it with the remaining toasted coconut and pecans. Definitely a prize winner at my house. Would be great for any group affair.

Could not find coconut cream pudding so I used banana cream pudding.  It came out pretty good, but is a little too sweet for my tastes.  The crust is really good though.

I made this recently for a party and before the evening was over, 3 folks asked for the recipe.  It is scrumptious and easy to make.  I followed the directions to the tee using the coconut cream pudding and beating it until thick.  It does set up pretty quickly and is simple to make.  You won't be disappointed.

I most definitely will try this. I'm certain this is a recipe where you change the  flavor of the pudding to make it a different dessert.  I have made this with chocolate, butterscotch and pistachio with wonderful results. Thank you for this version.  Will make on the weekend and add coconut as another reviewer suggested. No doubt, it will deserve the 5 star review I am giving now.
