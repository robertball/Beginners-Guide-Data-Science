This recipe came in handy for me today as I ran out of homemade applesauce and it's been too hot to cook new applesauce. I cut all the ingredients in this recipe in half EXCEPT the cinnamon. It works in a pinch. I still prefer the flavor that you get from cooking apples but it works.

This is alright if you really wanted applesauce and don't have time to cook any. I liked the brown sugar in it. I certainly prefer cooked applesauce--the texture of this is not as appetizing to me.

I didn't care for the texture of this recipe.  Simple fix-put it on the stovetop and cook it for 15-20 minutes on low.  So as written, not so great, but average in taste and still conveniently quick when finished on the stovetop.  To each her own; it's a texture thing for me.

Great, easy way to get the most of apples past their prime. I left the apples unpeeled for ease and nutrition.

I was surprised by how much I liked this recipe.  I have only made applesauce on the stove or crockpot, which I love, but this has such nice fresh apple flavor.  Great recipe!

we did not have enough apples but it still came out good.  My 6 year old Granddaughter actually made it.  We would make this 1,000 times.  We loved it.

While I much prefer cooked applesauce to this, there's something about this "raw" recipe that I like. I like the taste of the fresh apples and the brightness I get from the lemon juice. I should have been more careful, though, about the water. I ended up having to add another apple half (I had cut the recipe way down) because it was too liquidy for my taste preference. So, add the water a little at a time from the beginning.

Excellent recipe; quick & easy. Found a recipe for "Empanadas" (fruit turnovers) but no applesauce,then went to my favorite cooking website & found this special recipe; made @ noon & delish "empanadas" after supper. All Recipes is my favorite for cooking.Best website & able to adjust recipes for 1 -20.My kudos to all.
Sincerely,
