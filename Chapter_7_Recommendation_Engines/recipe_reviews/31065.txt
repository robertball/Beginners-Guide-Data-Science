This recipe is awesome.  My hubby can't wait for me to make it again.  I did change the way I cooked the chops though:  I covered the pan and cooked it on a very low flame for 20 minutes, turning the chops over once during cooking.  They were tender and moist.  I also used 1/3C milk with only 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch and the sauce thickened up nicely, without any lumps!  Thanks for a great recipe!

As written, this sauce doesn't work - but I think the flavor combination is worth 4-5 stars, so I'm cutting the recipe a break. I browned pork chops in the oil, then set them aside and did the sauce. I used about 1-1/2 cups of apple juice, 1/2 cup milk, coarse Dijon mustard, and fresh parsley. I did adjust the seasonings a bit to compensate for the extra liquid. I put the pork chops in the sauce to finish cooking. We liked this a lot with the changes, it's a great idea.

Very delicious!  Took longer than 20 minutes to cook, though.  I would use less flour for the gravy.  It took about 3 times as much milk as called for.  Overall some of the most yummy pork chops that I've ever tasted!!

I liked these and so did the hubby.  The only problem I had was having to add about a cup more apple juice to have any sauce at all.  Thanks!

Wonderful flavor.  The gravy was WAY too thick.  I ended up not being able to get all of the lumps of flour out, even adding more mil and apple juice.  Overall, fantastic tasting, but would add only about a tablespoon of flour instead of the 1/3 cup the recipe called for.  Chops were not dry at all, very tender.

I tried this for the first time last night and the hubby and I loved it. I'm not a huge fan of pork but this was great. I used orange juice instead of lemon juice since I didn't have any in the house. It was a sweet glaze on the outside with the salty pork taste in the middle. I didn't use all of the thickening flour mixture and had to add a little more apple juice to help the consistency, but when the pork was done cooking (slowly), the sauce had reduced too much. It turned out great though. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn.

These were very different and delicious. My husband thought they were excellent and I will definitely fix these again! I served them on top of noodles and had corn on the cob,plus Jan's fresh blueberry pie.

Very simple and absolutely delicious. I spread the mixture over the pork and let it marinade for a few hours. It was a perfect dinner with some yellow rice and vegetables.

Good flavor and just about the right amount of sauce.  The sauce was way too thick.  It was more like a dip.  Next time we will probably use more apple juice and then less milk to keep the flavor in.    If you cook it at too high of a temperature it will dry out the pork chops, cook it slower and in the sauce.  Might be good marinated in a mix similar to the sauce.

I have used this recipe many times, with perfect results each time.  I omitted the mustard, though, as my family doesn't care for mustard.  These pork chops are wonderful served over rice!

I would completely skip the milk and flour. I braised the pork chops in a skillet with Pam. Remove the chops and add the juices, mustard & honey. Mix well, put chops back in skillet, cover and cook. Add additional apple juice as needed. Sauce before adding milk and cornstarch was much better than after added. Next time, I will skip that step all together.

Im giving this 4 stars for concept, but I changed it quite a bit based on what I had on hand.  I seasoned, floured and sauteed 4 center cut, bone-in pork chops. I set them aside and in the same pan added 1 C apple juice, 1 T lemon juice, garlic powder, mustard powder, 1 T brown sugar, dried parsley.  After this began to simmer, I added the 1/3 C milk with about 2 T flour to thicken it up.  Put the chops back in and covered for about 5 minuted to finish cooking. We LOVED this meal.  Flavorful and juicy.  I think Im going to make it again this week!

Pork came out very dry.  The "sauce" was way too thick because the recipe uses TOO MUCH FLOUR!!!  After thinning out the sauce considerably with apple juice the whole thing had an odd, unpleasant taste.  I will not be making this again.

I'm sorry -- this was a throw away.  I followed the instructions except for leaving out some of the flour (the sauce was like gum!)  Everyone thought it was awful; the one time the kids get to have dessert w/ no dinner.

An interesting recipe.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either.  It was definitely edible but not even CLOSE to being a favorite.  I'm not much of a mustard fan so maybe that had something to do with it?  I gave it a 3 because It just wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be.  Although, I do have to say, the pork was very moist and I was very happy about that.  Pork always seems to dry out and this was definitely not even close to dry so that part was good.  I didn't care for the mustard or sweetness of the sauce/gravy though.

The sauce totally didn't work out for me, but there was so much flavour in the porkchops that I didn't mind. Next time I will brown the chops before adding the liquid.

I found this recipe really easy to do. I substituted parsley for basil, oregano and sage. I also used cornstarch instead of flour. The gravey went good over mashed potatoes as well.

I usually have trouble with my chops being dry, but not this time.  They were tender & moist, with a great flavor.  I thinned out the "gravy" a bit with more apple juice, and was very happy with the results.  A definite keeper!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I had to add a little bit more apple juice, so the sauce was not too thick.  I loved the gravy, but my husband did not care for it at all.  He did like the seasoning though, so I may just take his pork chop out of the pan before making the gravy next time.

Very good!  The only changes I made were browning the chops for 5 minutes a side before starting the sauce... and about the sauce.  Maybe it was that I left the heat up on med-high but the sauce began to get very thick 5 minutes into cooking.  By the time the dish was done I didn't need to thicken it, I actually had to add a little apple juice to thin it out, and still didn't have enough sauce.  Next time I guess I'll double the amounts and go from there.

I thought this recipe had a very good taste to it.  It was a little dry, but I believe that was chef's fault.  I will make this again.

Yummy!  Used pork steak instead of chops and butter instead of oil.  Had apple cider on hand, not juice, so used that. 1/3C of flour sounded like a lot, so cut back a little.  After all that, it was SOOOO good.  Did skim off some of the grease before making the gravy.  Didn't find it all that 'sweet', but was very tasty.

These were the most tender and delicious pork chops I've ever had.  Had trouble with the gravy getting too thick, but I think that's because the heat was too high. Other than that, this recipe was easy and very tasty.

This was excellent and so easy! I don't understand the less than perfect ratings on this one. My husband does not like sweet stuff, but even he liked them. I made these a couple weeks ago, but he asked me to make them again yesterday.

Yummy! I took advice of others and used cornstarch, still had to thin with more apple juice. (not a problem w/ 2 small children).  I also added two very large cloves of garlic, chopped.  Really easy and I thought very tasty.

I seared the chops first and then removed them and keep them warm.  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and added it to the saucepan and scrapped up all of the fond from searing the chops.  Then I mixed the flour and milk separately and added it to the saucepan.  I stirred and let it thicken and then added the chops back.  I covered it and cooked on low for about 10 more minutes.  Delicious and perfection.  Serve over rice and add extra sauce on top. Really good!

I tried to make it but I almost burnt myself with hot oil which was popping and hopping out of the pan splattering all over the place. Now I have a unnecessary mess to clean up. I have no idea why that happened, I followed the directions. I put the amount of oil in the pan that the recipe asked for. I heated the oil on med heat and after it was heated I started to put the lemon juice in it. I was doing one serving which asked for 3/4tsp of lemon juice. I put 1/4tsp of lemon juice in the oil and the reaction didn't stop until about ten seconds went by. Just imagine if I would have put the whole amount in.

I just made this for my family at my mom's house, kind of an early Mother's Day dinner, and they loved it. I did have to make some changes though since I was cooking in Mom's kitchen. I had talked up this recipe for DAYS, so she was really looking forward to it. This is what I did:

I added a little lemon zest to the sauce base before adding the chops, just because. 

Mom was out of a LOT of things, including dijon mustard and honey. She DID have some takeout packets of honey mustard sauce and plain honey, so I used some of those.

Mom was out of dried parsley, so I used an herb blend I found in her cupboard (Herbes de Provence) that had a little marjoram, thyme, lavender, etc. 

Mom was also out of flour, which I did not realize till everything was done. So I improvised with a little extra milk, an extra splash of apple juice, and about 2 tablespoons of plain cream cheese. The chops were delicious without the "gravy", so I figured if I ruined the "gravy" it wouldn't be too tragic. The gravy turned out to be what everyone liked the best! 

This is a very flexible and adaptable recipe. Hopefully I can try it in it's original form soon!

It was a good quick recipe, we used butterfly chops, i also noticed that i had to put in more apple juice to make the gravy, there wasnt enough sauce and that the flour,milk was lumpy, when trying to make the gravy, but the flavour was good, its one to keep in my recipe book

This has great flavor. Not to sweet, but that is ok with me. My 2 year old ate it, always a plus. I didn't have dijon, so I just put a tbls of mustard and it was fine. I also mut 2 tbls of cornstarch in the milk instead. Turned out great.

Well, I will say that when I tasted the first bite I thought these were pretty good. But then as I kept eating there was just something about the flavor of them that I just didn't care for. I reluctantly finished my pork chop, but felt dissatisfied after doing so since I expected these to be so much better.  Maybe it was the celery seed flavor?  I don't know. My husband took one taste of the gravy and opted out as well.  For whatever reason, we just didn't care for these.  Thnaks anyway!

We typically love meats flavored with apple, and were eager to try this one, but it did not measure up.  For those of you who did like this but had troubles with the sauce, I found that mixing in about 1/3 cup of water near the end of simmering thinned it out nicely.

I really enjoyed this recipe as well as my 3 year old.  My husband however is not a fan of meat and fruti combinations.  He ate it though and took some for lunch so he couldn't of have disliked it that much.  I used cornstarch instead of the flour and milk to cut back on the calories a bit.  Thickened right up and had no troubles with lumps.

should give it zero but there wasn't any zeros.  after supper i told my husband "i'm just glad i didn't spend more time on that dinner" and he replied "i'm just glad that dinner is OVER!".  enough said...thanks for the try, anyway.
