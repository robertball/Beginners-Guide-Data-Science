This dish is often found in many high-end restaurants, but with quite a few things you can do to upgrade the flavor with common ingredients.  Since the average person has to get their ingredients from supermarkets, Port Salut cheese is probably the best substitute for the difficult to find Reblochon.  That said, you are MUCH better off using chopped Pancetta (which you won't have to drain) than bacon. A couple of cloves of garlic go very well in with the onions and bacon/pancetta.  Also, I would recommend only half-pre-cooking the potatoes in step 1, then slicing them, and then frying them in withe the frying pan items before putting them in the baking dish.  Perhaps most importantly, this dish was MADE for Thyme - add 1/2 tbsp of thyme to the cream and wine before baking too.  Yummy!  Great addition to the site!

Raclette cheese also works well as a substitute for the Reblochon, which is much more difficult to find.

was VERY yummy!  a quick warning...if you can find the reblochon like it calls for, it smells pretty nasty (a combo of sweaty feet and B.O) BUT the final product DOES NOT taste like you are eating feet!  I loved it!

This was a fantastic dish and everyone at our get-together loved it. The Reblochon apparently is illegal to sell in the states, but if you go to a quality cheese shop then should know a good knock-off to replace it. The dish was superb and simple.

Very good. I couldn't find Reblochon at the places I hang out, so I ended up using Brie. Also made my own creme fraiche for the same reason. My finished product obviously wasn't completely authentic, but we enjoyed it anyway. I'd like to try it again sometime with the Reblochon cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Reblochon is a very regional cheese specific to the Alps.  Which is what makes this an Alpine specialty.  It will be hard to find Stateside.  It is really good if you wait for the creme fraiche and put it on top of the cheese and everything the last 10 min.

Used a whole pound of bacon, but other than that made exactly as directed and was it ever wonderful!  Husband took leftovers to work the next day for lunch and everyone asked what he was warming up since it smelled so good.  Thanks!

Very nice dish and got plenty compliments at the True Blood potluck party tonight. I doubled the recipe and ended up using over a pound each of bacon and brie cheese(couldn't find any of the others mentioned) My creme fraiche didn't turn out and ended up using about 1/3 cup of sour cream instead. I found several Youtube videos of this dish and might try one of those next time. Lots of variations of this recipe. Most of them used brie which helps with the pocket book! Did I say cheese is expensive here in Hawai'i??!!

If you can't find reblochon, Jamie Oliver says these cheeses should work well.  "Try using Cr√©mier de Chaumes, Epoisses or even a mature Irish Ardrahan."

I could not find any lardon so I replaced it with ham that I cubed and fried up with the onion. I also split the round of cheese length-wise and placed it on both sides of the middle level of potatoes. Thus the progression was potato, onion/ham, cheese, potato, onion/ham, cheese, potato. I also used a few dollops of sour cream on the top since I was out of creme fraiche. The end result was FANTASTIC. 

P.S. Use a nice, dry white wine.

This is the third time I've cooked this within a year and added slight variations to it each time 

1 as it is shown here 
2 was no bacon (girlfriends request not mine)
3 as shown with a garlic clove thrown in

All times have been delicious although my affinity for garlic floats me to the third one

Excellent, makes me feel like I am in France again!!

I have had Tartiflette in France, and this was a nice reminder.  I had a little trouble with the bacon -- I think the dish could have done with more bacon, but that might be my faulty memory.  I also think there could be more salt and pepper throughout the cooking process.  I did put some on at the end, but it only affected the top of the casserole.  I think adding just a little with each layer when assembling the dish would have worked better.
On the whole, though, this was a great recipe, and I'm sure I'll make it again sometime!

Fairly quick, tasty and easy to make. Love the creme fraiche as a cream alternative. However as we live in the Alps the Reblochon is easier for us to find than other people!

This turned out pretty well, though didn‚Äôt taste exactly as it had in France.  I used Raclette cheese, though I might try a different kind next time.  I used Russet potatoes, though will boil them in their skins next time and peel after boiling as suggested.  Overall pretty good.
