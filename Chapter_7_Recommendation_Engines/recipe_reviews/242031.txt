Hee Haw!  I left the seeds in the peppers!   This is good salsa!   The tomatoes and peppers were done in 20 - 25 minutes.  I used parchment on the pan, as aluminum and the acid from the tomatoes can leave a funky flavor.  While the tomatoes and peppers were roasting I loaded the blender with the other ingredients, so the whole thing only took about 30 minutes.  I would suggest letting it cool and the flavors mingle before serving.

The very best salsa I have ever had. Made a double batch a few weeks ago. All gone......friends all took a jar. THAT GOOD! Making a double batch again today. Great on eggs and fish. Used it to marinade a pork butt for carnitas.  Fantastic grilled then roasted.

Skipped the jalapenos peppers because I don't like it overly spicy. Added in an extra tablespoon of cider vinegar to enhance a little more sour. The recipe has really rich flavours and a good spicy kick. Very happy I made it.

This is so good. Wanted to eat it with a spoon like a spicy gazpacho. We like out food very flavorful so I just upped the spices. Used Mexican oregano and added additional cumin. Used more of the cilantro- added the entire stem and leaves to the blender since the stem is full of flavor. Also added some smoked paprika and ground chipotle to the mix to up the smoky factor. Pulsed it a few times and it was perfect.   Next time will make at least a double batch - so easy and delicious.    BTW.- I have spent a lot of time in central and southern Mexico and this is very similar to one of the salsa that myfriends have served me in their houses. Use on eggs or frijoles or add to quesadillas.  Very authentic.
