11.7.18  I typically follow a recipe the first time, but when you know something in it totally isn’t going to work for you, often resulting in a bad review, then it makes sense to change it, That being said, most cranberry sauces are too sweet for us, so with that in mind and to satisfy our level of sweetness, I cut the sugar back by 2/3. I know, I know, that’s a lot, but with that single modification, this cranberry sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and tart to satisfy our personal taste preference. And keep in mind, you always can add more, but once it's in there, it's not coming out.   I’ve made cranberry sauce with the orange-y flavor before, but I must say that I liked the unique flavor that the fresh ginger root brought to this recipe. The instructions don’t say what to do with the pecans, but I did coarsely chop them.  Cranberry sauce is so simple to make that I find it hard to believe that people still buy the canned (although I know some people like it better).  Cutting the sugar way back was key to success for us, and my review is based on that single change.  It was good!
