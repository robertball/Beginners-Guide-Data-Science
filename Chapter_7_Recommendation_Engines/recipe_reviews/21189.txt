I have a simliar recipe, it calls for 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  Also, I dot with butter then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar prior to baking.  My whole family LOVES them. They are a nice change from fatty doughnuts.

Simply a delicious muffin!  I used oil instead of shortening and it was so easy to whip up.  Loved it and would recommend it.  The snickerdoodle muffin!

These are a great alternative to doughnuts.  They are just as good and not as fattening.  Great to bring along to a play group or morning get together with friends.

I made this recipe with some kids that I were babysitting. They enjoyed helping me to make it... and they loved how it taste. This muffin is almost addicting, it's so good! I was amazed that it actually does taste like a donut! Since my mom won't let us make donuts, we can make this muffin instead!

I work in a High School kitchen & we always look for a variety for the kids.  I make 5 different kinds and these go first.  Love the texture and topping.  Thanks Debbie.

Found these to be pretty good, but I don't think my crumb toppping worked out very well. The 1 muffin we had left over the following day was excellent.

I made these without the topping and they were a bit dry and boring. They tasted more like a cupcake, but without icing! Still, they got eaten quickly enough!

Since I really love jelly donuts, I made a jelly version. First, I added vanilla and some nutmeg to the batter, and I used less sugar. As other reviewers have noted, the batter is a bit stiff. So, I put a heaping tablespoon at the bottom of each muffin compartment. Then I put a dollop of raspberry jam centered on the top of the batter. I added another teaspoon or two of milk to the remaining batter, which made it easier to spoon over the batter in the pan. You can spread this batter out a little, but you risk mixing the jelly into the batter. I found that the batter spread enough during baking to cover the jelly completely, so it's not really necessary. I then sprinkled white sugar over the tops of the muffins. I also let the pan rest about 10 minutes before popping it into the oven. I was rather pleased with the results, but I'll definitely grease the muffin pan better to prevent sticking at the bottom!

I have not tried THIS version of the recipe, but can tell you that if you are looking for something that tastes EXACTLY like a cake doughnut (including the texture), this is not it.  Cake doughnuts use NUTMEG in the recipe, giving them their signature flavor.  My recipe uses only 1/4 tsp nutmeg in the batter (which will be stiff), no cinnamon.  Bake muffins WITHOUT topping, allow to cool for a minute, then brush tops with melted butter and roll top in a mixture of POWDERED sugar and cinnamon.  My kids beg for these on a regular basis, and that is really saying something!

I thought these came out great, I rolled just the tops in the cinnamon sugar blend.  Very tasty and simple.

Did not like.  Very bland.  The only thing that made them edible was the cinnamon sugar on top.  They definitely need more cinnamon or some vanilla or something.  Will not make again.  Very disappointed because I LOVE doughnuts.  Followed the recipe exactly.

These are okay-tasting muffins, but they're not worth the fat or calories!  If you let the batter stand for about 15 minutes before scooping it into the muffin tin, the tops will not fall flat.  These muffins became very hard and dry overnight; they don't taste much like doughnuts either...

I have a similar recipe, except the sugar is halved and I use nutmeg instead of cinnamon in the batter. This should alleviate the snickerdoodle taste. Also, add the sugar and cinnamon before baking.

As far as taste goes these were very good. Mine stuck to the well sprayed muffin pan so maybe next time I will use the paper cups. I added about 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg to the batter to get more of a cake donut taste.I tossed what was left of the muffins in a paper bag with the cinnamon sugar in it to coat.

I agree with other reviewers, these did taste like Snickerdoodles moreso than doughnuts.  Either way they were very yummy.  After taking out of the oven, I melted some butter, dipped the tops in the butter, then cinnamon sugar mixture. mmmmmmm

These were really good! I liked that they took no time at all to prepare. I didn't think they tasted like doughnuts but they still were very good. I did sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar before I baked them. The kids loved them. 
Thanx for the recipe!

Great Recipe!  Quick, Easy and Tasty! We do love these! I added vanilla to the batter. Great for on the go or for breakfast & brunch! We are having breakfast for diner tonight and these will go great with Baked Pancakes.  These do remind me of snickerdoodles. Great Muffins, not cupcakes.  Light but tasty!

I shared this recipe with my mother who had just purchased a pan for baking doughnuts rather than frying them.  The recipe with the pan just didn't do the trick.  After searching I found this one for her and she tells me it is really great, her friends are raving!  Thanks

I have had this recipe for years. After comparing the two...mine is slightly different, which I think my differences would be an improvement.  Matter of opinion I suppose. My recipe calls for 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg in place of the cinnamon, and bakes at 350 degrees. But the main difference, which I believe to be the best part, is.... after baking, immediately remove the muffins and roll in 6 tbls of melted butter, THEN roll into the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Gives the muffins a nice coating. Hopes this helps someone. Other than that. These are loved by my husband.

Just made a batch of these... I didn't have any ground cinnamon though, so I used almond flavouring and topped with sliced almonds. They look - and smell - delicious. Waiting for them to cool a bit so I can try them! UPDATE: Just tried it and its really good. A little on the sweet side though... next time I will cut down on the sugar.

Delicious!  I brushed melted butter on the muffins before I rolled them in butter.  This was perfect with my morning coffee and the kids loved them as well.  Not sure why some folks would try this recipe without the sugar/cinnamon coating at the end - THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS RECIPE IS ABOUT!  It's all about being decadent!

These were doughy and spread all over the pan. It was strange, because the texture was bad, but the flavor was great! I don't think I'll ever make these again.

This was new and different. Took this to a church function and they were gobbled down super fast.  Only change was cane sugar for granulated palm sugar, came out great!

This is an excellent muffin recipe, the key to getting the sugar topping to stick is to dip the muffin tops in melted butter as soon as you take them out of the oven, THEN dip them in the sugar topping.  When you do that they are perfect!

Anyone who is surprised that these do not taste like doughnuts has ZERO understanding of cooking!  For one thing, doughnuts are fried.  These are doughnut-like in flavor, as the name suggests, and delicious.  The best thing about them is that the ingredients are on hand in almost any kitchen, so I often make these when I'm behind on my grocery shopping.

Of course these don't taste EXACTLY like donuts!  Donuts get much of their flavor from the frying.  Since these are a baked item, the taste will be different so I don't understand why people are complaining about that.  Perhaps a better description is "similar to the FLAVOR of a cinnamon sugar donut."  Anyway, my family enjoyed these.  I used butter instead of shortening, added vanilla, and made 6 jumbo muffins, cooking them for 25 minutes.  The outsides got crispy and the insides were tender.  The kids sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top but the adults ate theirs without.  Everyone agreed they were good and I plan on making them again.

Good but not much like a doughnut taste at all. I like the recipe on the can of clabber girl brand baking powder. Calls for less sugar and adds nutmeg and also calls for oil not shortening.

Very good!!  I made a few adjustments for high altitude cooking since I live in Northern Colorado.  I decreased the amount of sugar and baking soda just a tad and increased the milk to 2/3 cup.  They turned out beautifully!  Tastes just like a cake doughnut.  Thanks!

I made these because my husband wanted doughnuts and I wanted muffins.  I was quite dissapointed.  I substituted nutmeg for the cinnamon to reduce the cookie taste.  They didn't rise much and were pretty dry (even with some added milk) even for muffins.  I just barely managed to get 12 muffins out of the recipe.  I will probably not make these again.

Very good.  I baked for 15 minutes and then removed them from the muffin pan and rolled them in the sugar mixture while they were still warm.  Great with coffee or milk.  The kids really liked them a lot.  I followed the directions exactly and would not change a thing!  Thanks Debbie.

These muffins were excellent - a great alternative to doughnuts.  I took the advise of adding nutmeg and dotting with butter & sprinkling with cinnamon sugar before baking and the result was wonderful!  Texture was light yet substantial - flavor was delicate - I may add vanilla next time.  YUM!

These muffins taste like snickerdoodles!  My first time making this recipe, the muffins didn't raise as much as I had wanted, so I will probably be using 2 C's of flour next time.  My family and friends really liked them.  It's a keeper!!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and they were pretty good, no complaints. Then I made them again with a few changes : oil instead of shortening, added 2tsp of baking powder, and 1/4tsp nutmeg. Now they are great, my husband asks for these one to two times a week for breakfast.

Great for a treat with coffee or milk. Check them at 18 minutes. I find the done perfectly at this time. I had no baking powder and was saved by the Internet / 2 parts Cream of Tartar to 1 part baking soda...worked just fine!

very good.  one thing makes the crumb topping really stick is to dip the top in butter right out of the oven and then into the sugar mix.  they will no doubt have a good sugary topping.

excellent recipe! however, i sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top of the muffins before baking... it makes a nice crisp (not too crisp) edge around the rim of the muffin.... VERY good! :) made it three times in two days!

This is a very good and simple recipe...that is the beauty of it. I would add nutmeg to taste, keep or omit the cinnamon. I also believe the baking powder is off a bit, maybe why some are haveing trouble, try 2 1/4 tsp. Better ratio. Try with liquid coffee  creamer flavorings, like eggnog!

I didn't think of using regular oil, so I used butter. Because I didn't notice the number of servings on the recipe, I didn't know what size cups to use, so I used the mini ones (ignorantly baking them the whole 20 minutes). It's no wonder they came out so nasty and dry. ~LOL~    Not realizing the wrong size was the culprit, I put a bit of applesauce in the second batch and (sticking with the minis) baked them 18 minutes.  This time I completely dunked them in my special cinnamon glaze (the secret to my glaze/icing is butter and salt). My husband popped one in his mouth and didn't say anything for several seconds. I was afraid he wasn't going to like it until he said," Dunkin' Donuts' got nothing on you." They didn't rise very much, but who cares? They were FANTASTIC.

Oh my gosh are these good!!  I prefer not to use shortening, so used oil instead...definitely recommend using the melted butter to help the cinnamon/sugar stick.  It's impossible to eat just one! (I've had three!!)  I had no problem getting 12 muffins from this recipe - used a large scoop to get batter in muffin tin (used paper liners), and actually had some extra batter to spread around.  The batter is thick, but the muffins are delicious - not dry at all!  My kids loved them...even  my three year old son who rarely sits to eat ANYTHING!  We will be making these a lot - thank you!!

These were good but should be called a Snickerdoodle Muffin instead...got my hopes up for a cake donut flavor to no avail.  I will probably make these again with some tweaks.

If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would. They were delicious, and extremely easy to make. Before I made them I read the other reviews and saw that most people did not think they tasted like doughnuts. So I didn't tell my younger siblings what they were called. They were very easy to make, and I only made one change. When ever you had cinnamon sugar to something that is already baked, you ahve to have butter first, otherwise the cinnamon sugar doesn'st stick. I had two bowls, one with melted butter and the other with the cinnamon sugar. When the muffins were out of the oven I dipped them in the butter and then in the cinnamon sugar. These muffins are rather crumbly, but their good taste makes up for that.I only gave it four stars because they should not be called "Doughnut Muffins" the truth is they do not taste much like doughnuts. They taste more like cake then doughnuts.  Very nice recipe, will make again.

These muffins were so delicious. I did not think that they tasted like doughnuts, but were very sweet anyway. I followed the recipe exactly.  For those of you who said that the muffins did not rise; you probably used baking soda instead of baking powder like the recipe calls for

This was great! I really enjoyed them. After reading some of the reviews talking about it being dry, when I creamed the shortening and the sugar, I also added a couple tablespoons of butter. The muffins turned out great! It wasn't dry at all! Will definately make again!

I was looking for a quick recipe that I had all the ingred for and came across this one. A hit with everyone. The only change I made was added vanilla and dipped in melted marg. before rolling in cinn & sugar. Taste like our favorite snickerdoodle.

Wasn't impressed by these.  I can't say they were bad, but nothing great.  They really do taste like a snickerdoodle.  Not was I was going for.  I didn't think they would taste exactly like doughnuts, but maybe a little bit more than they did.  They taste like a cake cookie.  I won't be making these again.

Didn't have shortening so used oil - muffins didn't rise at all. However, flavour was akin to cinnamon donuts - much to surprise of party guests. Not bad - for those with sweet tooth.

This recipe is delicious!  The one change I did was add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 to the muffin mix.  I also used a hand mixer on the recipe.  They do taste like cake donuts to me.  The other thing is that the recipe made 10 not 12 muffins for me.  When they rise in the oven they get very tall!  My husband, who is a bit picky loved this!  I recommend this recipe.

Delicious!  My daughter, the donut queen loves them.  I, the muffin queen love them, too!  I used oil instead of the shortening, mixing dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in another, and mixing the two together.  Easier, and just as tasty.

Quick, easy, delicious (especially fresh from the oven), inexpensive - all the ingredients are common pantry items.  I had raves when I served this to my church group, and requests for a copy of the recipe.  Thumbs up!!

These muffins were wonderful. I have a recipe much like this one, but this one is better because the batter has cinnamon in it. The only criticism I have is that Debbie didn't mention that you should dunk the muffins in melted butter if you want the cinnamon-sugar mixture to stick. Otherwise, it falls right off.

Used oil instead of shortening and also halved the recipe. My muffins sunk down a little in the middle, but that didn't affect the taste at all! They were yummy, but needed to have a little more cinnamon sugar topping. I ended up periodically sprinkling more on my muffins as I ate them. They also stuck to my muffin liners, but were tasty enough that I might make them again anyway.

Tastes great! although 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon is way too much for the top. half of that amount works fine.

Very easy!!  I tripled the recipe for a church bake sale and had them done in no time.  I did brush butter on the top to make the cinnamon &  sugar stick better but other than that I left everything the same~~shouldn't have tripled the topping though~~I have more than enough left over for several more batches.  :)  They do taste more like snicker doodles  than doughnuts, but that is quite alright with me.

My family LOVES this recipe. I have made it for breakfast for my daughters' sleepovers for years and they are always a huge hit. They are best right out of the oven as they do not keep well in my opinion.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe for muffins. I made according to the directions modifying only to the extent of dusting the filled muffin cup with the cinnamon sugar prior to baking ( I filled the cup for 12 oversized muffins ) and I sprinkled the muffins again with cinnamon sugar when they where done baking. The muffins came out wonderful! And when cooled enough to eat, we were able to take just the muffin top off and VIOLA it was like a snickerdoodle cookie was baked right into the muffin! Such yummy bliss. The muffin was moist and delightful! I will be making these again and again and again LOVE THEM!

Easy and tasty. I used wheat flour and grapeseed oil, I added oil to the crumble also to hold it together. Tasty but does noot taste like a doughnut.

An excellent muffin! Not sure about tasting like a doughnut but I've decided on calling them snickerdoodle muffins. Very very good and somewhat easy to make, it was my first time baking anything and this was very easy to make.

The flavor was good, but the middle completely fell in for some reason. Also, I greased the muffin pan really well, but they just wouldn't come out without being destroyed. At first I thought it was the pan, but I've used it many times, and never had a problem with it.

These were great! My friend and I doubled the recipe, and I'm glad we did cause these taste superb. Will definitely have to make these again. We had a lot of the cinnamon sugar mixture left over afterwards though, will probably half that in the future.

I used a doughnut pan instead of a muffin pan.  I added a little nutmeg, about 1/4 teaspoon.  Also, you need to coat the tops with melted butter as soon as they are cool enough to come out of the pan (doesn't take long) so the cinnamon sugar mixture will stick.  I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar.  These are great!  In my opinion, they taste a lot like doughnuts, enough so that they are a great replacement for doughnuts.  I did try this recipe in a muffin pan and for whatever reason, they weren't as good.  I think they are better when they are baked in smaller sections (doughnut pan).

I made them with oil instead of shortening, and while they came out great, they definitely need to bake longer than 20 minutes! If you use oil, then add another 15 minutes to the baking time. :] Also, spread the tops with a little butter afterward; it makes the cinnamon-sugar stick beautifully!

Delicious! These muffins really do taste like doughnuts! We made them on Valentine's Day, so we swirled a bit of red food coloring into the batter, and added red sugar crystals to the top. Even my older daughter, who doesn't eat a lot of sweets, ate these!

The muffins were excellent!  The only thing I did differently was I used brown sugar for the topping instead of white.  My family just loved them, I made them last night and I only have one left!! I will definitly be making these again and again!  Also they are so quick and easy to make!

This is the best muffin recipe I've ever made. I made an orange version with orange zest into the dough and orange jam in the middle of the muffin. Mmm ... Tasty!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because if it wasn't for my tweeking, they wouldn't have been as good as they were (which wasn't anything spectacular) They didn't taste like doughnuts to me at all. They were crumbly even though I used butter and shortening, I made a glaze out of butter,powdered sugar,vanilla and cinnamon. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad tasting, just not as good as expected.

These are super easy to make, but did not taste like a doughnut to me. Also, I had to brush butter on tops (which did not rise, in fact, they caved in) in order for the sugar-cinnamon topping to stick. I was somewhat disappointed. They're good, but not as good as other muffins, and definitely no replacement for doughnuts.

I made some of these as the recipe directed, a few with chocolate chips, and a few that I added 1 tsp of apricot preserves.  The plain ones were very good but not great- the others turned out awesome though.    I'll definitely make them again.

The sugar topping makes these stick to your non-stick muffin pans--beware! I should have added it during the last five minutes of baking perhaps. Also, these are *very* sweet, but I guess if you are reading a review about "doughnut muffins," you are probably not the sort of person who avoids sweet! These will remind you of cake doughnuts, I think, but of course they are not exactly the same.

Good overall, but not one of my favorites.  I think I just like muffins to be a bit more complex in flavor.  But they would be very good for kids.

These muffins do not taste like donuts -- but they do taste good.  I baked mine for fifteen minutes instead of twenty and they turned out perfectly.  They were okay without the topping, but dipped in butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, they were heavenly!

These did not turn out well at all. They baked much more quickly than the recommended time, and were tough and very doughy tasting. Way too brown on the bottoms. I tried with and without baking cups. Both were terrible. Even my garbage disposal of a husband turned up his nose.

These were so good! Tasted like a doughnut/snickerdoodle. My son and husband loved them, and they're made of things that are normal staples in every home, so they're easy to whip up!

These were so good even without the topping.  I made them for my daughters pre-school and they loved them!

These muffins are GREAT!  I am baking them right now and haven't even dunked them in the cinnamon sugar mixture (as I want it to be fresh for tomorrow's brunch and am going to follow the suggestion of dipping them in melted butter first).  They taste like snicker doodles!  My favorite cookie.  These might be my favorite muffin!

These were VERY good. My 3 year old loved them and he never eats muffins. I'll be making these often. The texture was excellent.

I looked at the recipe and realised I had everything in the cupboard.  That was a big plus.  It was a snap to make and my kids and I ate them up. They were great.
