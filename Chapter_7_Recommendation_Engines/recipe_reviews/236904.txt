Nutritious, delicious, and easy!  My picky kids actually (surprise!) eat it without complaining.  Make sure to use sharp or extra sharp cheddar as that's where the real flavor comes from.  You can also use Kale instead of Spinach and it works well.

Four/five liked this recipe in my family, which usually means weâ€™ll make something again. I loved the flavor that the barbecue sauce gave this recipe, and I was afraid at first that would make it too sweet, but no worries there! I made this as a meal, and thought that this was definitely filling enough for that even with out any meat. The quinoa and black beans have enough protein to keep you filled up. Great flavor!

These are very tasty.  I wanted them to be more of a meal than an appetizer.  I added some cooked chicken that had been seasoned with taco seasoning.  I also threw in some frozen corn.  I used the the tortillas you cook yourself.  Great quick, healthy meal.  I will make it again.

I've made this one and several other wraps, love them all! Quick and easy plus my husband who was a devout usual bread sandwich now would rather have a wrap!

Made according to recipe this time. However do to personal preference next time I may add more heat and less bell pepper. May even try with some grilled steak!

I will make this again but with LOTS more spice and no BBQ sauce - that made it too sweet for my taste.
