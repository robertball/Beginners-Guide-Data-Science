This was a great use of the abundance of basil I have growing in the garden. I made two small changes to this recipe.  I used red cherry tomatoes because I couldn’t find any yellow, which in the scheme of things makes the slightest bit of difference.  In addition, I used toasted walnuts instead of pine nuts – just a personal preference.  This makes a wonderful pasta salad for a hot summer’s day.

We loved this!  I used a different type of pasta, red cherry tomatoes, and didn't have garlic but otherwise followed the recipe, and it was delicious.  Used about 10 - 15 larger leaves from my basil plant.  If using larger-sized pasta than orzo, I'd suggest making some additional pesto so there is plenty to coat your pasta.

Loved this salad but did customize it after burning the only pine nuts I had..  Worked out well using almonds.  I also doubled the garlic  and added light golden vinegar to taste.  The vinegar really made it great.  Did not have orzo so used funghetti and they were great.  Will definitely make again.
