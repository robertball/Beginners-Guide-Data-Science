A family favorite! We made our own spaghetti sauce (tomato sauce with lots of chopped veggies), like we always do (no offense, Newman's). My husband was so hungry that he couldn't wait for the 2nd round of cakes to come from the ovens, so he tried the regular spaghetti on the plate to compare the two dishes. He firmly decided that the baked cakes were better, and needless to say, he patiently awaited the remaining 4 minutes for the second batch! The baking process brings out the flavor of the sauce. Delicious!

This was a really cute idea and made portion control easier too. I baked these almost 25 minutes and they just didn't get crispy on the outside except for a very few noodles on the bottom edge. They did get stick to the foil. Somewhat dry too as the pasta absorbed all the sauce. I used my own sauce instead of the brand mentioned. This just didn't turn out as well as I had expected. Thanks for a good idea though and changing up a boring meal.

pretty good.  I added bell peppers, onions, and garlic to the sauce.  I didn't have Newman's sauce so I just used Roasted Garlic Prego.  This is an easy and different weeknight meal.
