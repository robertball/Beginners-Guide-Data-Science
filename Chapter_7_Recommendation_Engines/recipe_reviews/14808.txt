Terribly bland-I added three times the amount of chili powder with the hopes of perking up the flavor with no luck.

Perhaps, to cure the blandness, you could use lime juice instead of lemon, and add a little  fresh (seeded) japeno, and a little fresh cilantro. Throw in a clove of garlic. How about a tad of white vinegar? Those are all key to real guacamole, so surely they will perk up the broccoli version!

I read the reviews, but I still wanted to make it because I am looking for healthy recipes. So I (1) added 1 clove minced garlic(if you like garlic add more (2) I used the white part of the green onion for the onion called for in the recipe and then used the green part to sprinkle over the top.  It helped.

I found that adding in about 2 Tbsp. FF or 1/3 less fat cream cheese thickened this recipe up and made it superb!!

I found this recipe to be a bit bland.  I tried to add some seasonings and a little salt, but it didn't help.  It certainly is healthy, though---and pretty easy (although a bit messy) to make.

I used raw broccoli instead and it was WONDERFUL.  Great snack for those of us that like something healthy and lower in fat!

This recipe turned out tasty, but not as much reminiscent of guacamole as I was expecting.  However, I modified it, which may account for the difference in taste, which was unique, but pleasant.  I used nonfat, plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and mayonnaise, and I added lime juice, extra chili powder and onion, some garlic salt, and cumin.  It is slightly spicy, and it's refreshing, as a dip with wheat crackers.

My husband just could not believe this was broccoli.  I used lime juice instead of lemon because that is what I had.  I also added one jalapeno pepper because we like spicy things otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.

I personally liked this recipe.  I added some fresh ground cumin or cuminos to the recipe, though.  I will probably make this again while on the low-fat diet.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was a nice recipe, but I agree with other reviewers who thought a bit more flavour was needed.  I added a fresh clove of garlic (minced) & a little more lemon juice.  A very fresh, zesty and not too broccoli-like flavour.  Very good!

If you make this recipe exactly as written you get the most bland, boring fake guacamole you have ever eaten.  I added so much more cumin, cayenne, garlic and tomato to make it palatable.  If you can overlook the smell (cooked broccoli is very pungent), I was able to enjoy the dip with chips.  My boyfriend literally wouldn't touch it--so I doubt this will ever be made again in my house.

Made this for a change of pace. It is really very good. It would be difficult to tell it wasn't avocado's if you didn't know it was made with broccoli.
