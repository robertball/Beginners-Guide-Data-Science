Hearty and flavourful and no need to cook the dish for 8 hours unless the beef has not been properly cooked and crock pot  is slow.  Next time I make this will add some garlic.  :) For me, it actually has a more stew like consistency.

I made this today and it came out fabulous!  Only change I made was to add the rice (Texmati Rice) about 1/2 hour before we were ready to eat.  So delicious.  Highly recommend.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this soup. I did add a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce, and about 1/2 t minced garlic because I was afraid it would be bland. I didnt use the tomato soup, because i grow tomatoes and I used a blender full plus 1/2 more of pureed fresh tomatoes and a teaspoon and a half of sugar to make it taste more tomato soup like. an enjoyable soup with ingredients we grow and had at hand. thanks for sharing

I scaled the recipe to 8 servings as I only had 1 lb ground beef. 
For seasoning I omitted the salt, I added Worchestire sauce, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs Dash garlic & herb, black pepper, and a bay leaf. 
I used 2 pouches of salt free Herbox beef boullion for the cubes. 
I shredded the cabbage in my food processor and weighed out 2 lbs. 
I had to add 4 cups of water.
I cooked the soup on the stove top and it was ready in 90 minutes. 
I served over rice instead of adding it to the soup as my son has texture issues.

I do not think it needs to be in the crockpot for 8 hours on high. Came out thick like stew, definitely hearty. It had good taste but next time I will cook it on low and possibly add more water to the recipe.

More like a stew than a soup but my husband prefers this.  I did add 1 clove diced garlic, allspice, little vinegar and tbsp brown sugar.  Those are the spices my grandmother would add.  Came out great.  Freezes well.  Will make this again.   Maybe a new soup  for the Super Bowl party we have.

This is tasty.  I doubled the recipe and it filled my large stick pot.  I found the liquid to be adequate, but I made the rice separately and added it to the bowls as I served.   I always add a sprinkle of cinnamon to my cabbage soup in my bowl, as others donâ€™t like the flavor.  I would make this again.

A good quick crock pot  dinner that will keep you warm in the winter. Is use beef base instead  or kitchen bouquet  instead of bullion  cubes to cut down the salt. A good Jewish  rye finishes it off great
