I've made this recipe twice now...the first time I pretty much followed the recipe except adding broccoli to the rice mixture and adding breadcrumbs to the chicken breasts.  This time, I took some advice from several other reviewers.  I doubled the amount of rice and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  I also dissolved 2 chicken boullion cubes in the 2 cups of water before I mixed it with the soup and rice.  I cooked 3/4 of a bag of frozen broccoli spears in the microwave and added it to the rice misture.  I sprinkled a little garlic salt on the chicken, and covered it in a thin layer of bread crumbs.  I like it before...but I really like it now.  The cream of mushroom soup gave it a little more flavor and the chicken breast is sooo moist.  I can never get chicken to turn out this moust.  Love it!

Great basic recipe, but I agree with other reviewers - needed some "oomph", so I replaced 1/4 cup of the water with lemon juice, added parmesan cheese and 16 oz frozen broccoli.  When I put the chicken on top, I sprinkled with garlic powder and some italian breadcrumbs.  Good comfort food on a winter night.

I tried this recipe with no adjustments and really liked it. I read some of the reviews yesterday and mixed it up a little last night. I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead, replace the 1 cup of water with a cup of chicken broth, added 1/2 cup sour cream, with a little more pepper and salt as well. It was sooooo much tastier. My husband and I liked it much better this way.

This is a good recipe the key to making it more tasty is adding sour cream. I added both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. one cup of rice and a cup of sour cream. salt, pepper, and garlic.

This is a great base recipe.  I used 1/4c. fresh lemon juice and seasoned my chicken with lemon pepper, garlic salt, paprika and parsley.  I added 2 fresh crowns of broccoli to the rice before dumping it into a greased 9x13 glass pan.  The chicken came out incredibly moist.  Next time I might use cream of mushroom soup and use 1/3c. white wine.  Also, the 3/4 c. rice is the PERFECT amount.  I think this recipe would be too bland without adding your own seasonings.  Oh, and the cleanup was the best part - only the bowl to mix the rice, etc. and the glass pan!

I do this a little differently. I use chicken flavored rice, 2 cans of broccoli cheddar soup, and top with crushed crackers. If I'm in a big hurry I use 2 cans of the chunk white meat chicken instead of the chicken breasts. Very, very good...I could eat the whole thing by myself!!

as I read in other reviews I did some stuff to alter this recipe and instead of water i used chicken broth, I put bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese on top. i did not have broccoli on hand so i did not use any veggies but next time i may add in some frozen peas. it did however take longer to cook then i thought it would, almost an hour but it was well worth the wait the whole family absolutely loved it!!!

Not all that much flavor in this one...and, it took a lot longer to cook for me, as I think I used the wrong type of dish to cook it in (I used a round corningware dish that was taller rather than flat). I added italian herbs and garlic salt, per the other reviews, but it still was pretty bland. Chicken was on the dry side, too. I don't think I'm going to make this one again...

Loved it! But like others before me I added a can of chicken broth instead of water, did not have chicken/broccoli soup so used cream of chicken and added fresh broccoli, sprinkled garlic powder and a dusting of bread crumbs on top of chicken. Delicious!!!

Well, the flavor is very good but I did make some changes of course. :0) I added a bit more garlic, some bread crumbs to the top, seasoned salt, and some onion. But I am not sure what rice cooks in 45 minutes in this, mine ended up needing a good hour and 40 minutes for the rice to not be crunchy.

I gave this recipe only 2 stars because if you were to actually follow it, this is what I would rate it.  I changed it up a little bit, and still was disappointed.  Due to other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp salt (which was still not enough) and topped with a mixture of spicy mustard and honey.  I had to bake for 1 hour at 375 for chicken to cook through.  The rice was still not completely done, and there was a lot of watery mixture on top.  I think that it should have probably been stirred 1/2 way through the cooking time.  The chicken wasn't very tender or flavorful, and we found the rice to be bland.  If I was to use this recipe again (which I wont!), I would substitute the water for butter and milk, add more salt, and maybe put a topping of stuffing on.  Since there was quite a bit of left-overs (no one in the family ate very much), I will be adding salsa, cheese, and corn, to make a mexican casserole.  Hopefully, it's better the second time around!

I made this when my husbands family came to visit from out of state without noice, it was a HIT, and it is very easy to put together and visit while it cooks! The only thing I did different is I added 1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli! I will be making this again!

I made one batch of this, and it barely filled the bottom of my pan. So I doubled it, and I adjusted it after reading some reviews. Instead of 1 cup of water I used 3/4 cup and 1/4 lemon juice. I used brown rice. I added broccoli, parsley, basil, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. I used two 12 oz cans of chicken. I cooked 45 minutes, and the rice was still hard. I put it back in for another 20 minutes, the rice was still hard. I put it back in for another 20 minutes this time not covered with aluminum foil. The rice was partially hard. Stirred, and put in for another 10 minutes uncovered. Rice still wasn't done. If you're going to use brown rice look into precooking it first...

This one didn't work so well for us.  ended up cooking for almost 1.5 hours for the chicken to get done, and still half of the rice was over done,while the other half of the rice was still crunchy. It was also too soupy for us. I have made similar chicken and rice dishes in the past, so I'm not sure what happened here, but I probably won't make this again. Thanks though!

Great base recipe. The firsr time I tried it with the suggestiin of using 1/4c lemon juice....not for us (was VERY lemony) after making several times I have decided on cubing the chicken, adding salt, garlic powder to the mixture, using frozen broccoli instead if canned and topping with crushed ritz and parm. DELICIOUS! Oh and i always use brown rice (no problems cooking)

This recipe is extremely bland. I even like bland food and this was just too much. The pepper didn't really do much for the rice and the paprika wasn't marvelous on the chicken. I've eaten a dish similar to this throughout my life that my parents made when they wanted a quick dinner and I loved it, but this is lacking. It needs more soup and rice and broccoli. The soup has a lot of flavor, but it's so bogged down by chicken and rice that it can't really show off. I'm going to try it with twice the soup, more rice and add broccoli florets next time.

I did change it up a bit after reading the other reviews and it was excellent! I steamed some fresh broccoli in the microwave. I used Uncle Ben's chicken & wild rice in the box (all of rice)(set aside seasoning packet) and mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (only because I didn't have cream of mushroom) and added little less than 1/2 cup of sour cream into the soup & rice mixture. I mixed the seasoning packet out of the box and 1 1/2 cup water & shook this together in a covered cup and added it to soup mixture. I added a little salt, pepper & garlic powder and stirred all this together. I poured mixture into a glass casserole dish and put chicken breast & broccoli on top. Sprinkled garlic powder & paprika on chicken. Covered with foil & cooked 50 minutes. So Good!! Thank You!

The first time I made this step for step but since then have experimented different soup flavors. My favorite of them all is I used Campbell's broccoli and cheese can and used extra pepper and salt to rice then after mixing the rice and water and can put slices of cheddar cheese on top of rice. For the chicken if the breasts are thick I'll put a couple of slits so it will cook all the way through. I seasoned with salt pepper and some mrs dash. It tastes delicious and is so easy. Great base recipe especially if you're busy or don't have much time. It cooks itself.

I added more rice.. shredded cheese.. chopped up celery.. and breaded the chicken and then added garlic salt and paprika on top.  It was good but I think it can be made even better by added more flavorful ingredients. (My five year old loved it!)

I don't even think this recipe deserves a star.  Maybe one star for effort...not sure.  I took in account other reviews and doubled the rice, doubled the cream of chicken, doubled the water.  I seasoned the chicken with some garlic, paprika, thyme, basil, and salt.  It took so long to cook (over 1 hr in my oven) and the rice..some was cooked, some not cooked.  Needless to say I will not be making again.

I have made this several times now, and my whole family loves it which is a surprise! The first time I made it according to the original recipe, then the next I tried a few of the other reviews suggestions and it was great! I use 2 cans of soup, cream of chicken, cream of broccoli, cut up the chicken and use bread crumbs with seasoning! Easy to make and great leftovers!

i made this recipe twice and will give it 3 stars as written. as i made it i will give it 5. the changes i made were to dip the chicken pieces in bread crumbs with the paprika and some garlic powder mixed in and then seared them until crispy but not done. i mixed the rice and instead of using water used chiken broth as well as adding a bag of frozen brocolli and cauliflower ( the one thats mixed not a bag of each) and mixed in cheddar cheese to my liking. i also sprinkeled the top of the chicken with cheese in the last 5-10 minutes as well. my family loved it.

This was very yummy and my kids absolutely raved about it!  I added a can of cream of chicken soup, a cup and a half of chicken broth instead of water then about 3tbsp of real butter and 3tbsp of cream cheese.  On the chicken, I put paprika, cayenne, onion powder and lime powder.  I sprinkled some shredded cheddar over the top and baked for about an hour to get the rice and chicken completely done.  Instead of broccoli, we had creamed spinach on the side.  It turned out very creamy and very tasty.  Kudos to Campbell's Kitchen for the good base recipe ;)

It was a good recipe, but I think the tweeks and suggestions that other people said really made it work.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and put more veg in the rice (onions, mushrooms, broccoli, and celery).  Will definitely make this again!

This was super easy. I also doctored it up a little. I took another's suggestion and added broccoli florets, also added about 2 small potatoes quartered & mixed it in with the rice & cream of mushroom soup. Added some rosemary, Mrs. Dash and other spices too.  I also browned the chicken ( I used thighs) for about 6 min on each side before baking.  Thanks for the super easy & tasty dish.

This is so easy and tasty. I like to prepare it with the original recipe sprinkle cheddar on top.  I also steam some extra broccoli for the side.  I guess I could just toss some frozen into the rice mixture- maybe next time.  Great recipe for a busy family!

This was very easy.  I used a whole pan of legs so my cooking time was longer, but it was still easy enough.  I doubled the rice and water and soup - one CO chicken and one CO of broccoli.

The recipe "as is" was 5/10, I cut broccoli up into the rice, chicken broth is good rather than water.. and lemon juice helps.  Also, I flatten the chicken breast a little

This is a very easy, simple recipe that is easy to add to. I used 1 fresh broccoli florets, used almost 1 cup of rice (instead of 3/4 c), used entire can of chicken broth, added 1/4 c sour cream. I also topped with crumbled ritz crackers, parmesan cheese and some fresh parsely and basil from garden. My husband loved it! Also, I cooked an hour. Very filling and savory!

I loved this recipe a LOT! I had to add 15 minutes cook time, however because the chicken and rice were not quite done. However, it's definitely one dish I enjoyed both making and eating and it's quickly becoming a staple in our dinner line up.

Good recipe, but make sure you cook your rice first. I doubled the recipe to make 8 servings and my rice was a tad bit crunchy. Also use more seasoning to your own liking. I also used one can of cream of chicken & mushroom and one can of cream of broccoli cheese. Then I topped it off with shredded chesse.

I used to general idea of this recipe as a base- but instead of cream of broccoli soup I used cream of mushroom soup and fresh broccoli and I seasoned the chicken with sazon. When it was nearly finished baking I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Came out perfect.

My husband told me the last time I made this recipie this is his favorite!  It is super easy to make.  Once I got comfortable with the movements and ingredients I even started changing up the condensed soups; cream of mushroom works great with this.  My four-year old daughter likes it when I add frozen peas and corn in the mix.  The entire dish- with or with out the frozen veggies- comes out perfect every time.  SIDE NOTE: season the chicken with salt and pepper before putting it in with the rest of the ingredients to give the meat more flavor.

I love this recipe. Very easy to tweak and still get awesome results. In fact, I've even utterly bungled it and still gotten a delicious meal. lol My favorite way to make it is with cheddar soup subbed for cream of and chicken broth subbed for water, then some frozen veggies tossed in. YUM!

I followed the recipe except I put chicken broth instead of water and I seasoned the chicken with more than paprika. It was amazing.  Simple and delicious.

This was a good enough dish, but rather bland over all.  That said, everyone in my apartment ate it up and we didn't have leftovers!  It was fine, just nothing exceptional.

This was tasty and super easy to make. Made some adjustments for my and my hubby's tastes. Doubled the rice. Used 1 can cream of chicken and equal amount of sour cream plus 1 1/2 cup chicken broth. Added crushed garlic, onion powder, salt/pepper and shredded cheese. I also diced my chicken and added raw broccoli florets. Mixed it all together and baked. Turned out very well!

A good basic recipe, but needs way more in the way of flavor.  The children only ate it after drizzling honey on their rice.  Next time, will use more cheddar sauce, not as much water, and will add milk and more spices.

I, too, doctored this recipe up after reading the previous reviews: I used Cream of Celery soup, a cup of chicken broth instead of water, fresh chopped broccoli florets, and Garam Masal seasoning in with the rice. I covered the chicken with thin pats of butter and paprika before baking. The taste was phenomenal!   This is certainly a good 'base' recipe but would have to be unbearably bland as is.

I used this recipe, only I did double. And instead of 2 cups of water I did half water half milk. And added some garlic powder and onion powder to it as well as cheddar cheese. I did the chicken in chunks and put some whole pieces on top. Mix in some broccoli and delicious. Cooked for 45 min.

I made this recipe, however I doctored it up as well, I browned the chicken, using a chicken seasoning (used lawrys).  Then to the water,(increased to 2 cups) I brought this to boil with chicken boullian to give some extra chicken flavoring, then I added the rice and cream of chicken soup. Then I added 1 cup of mixed veggies and 1 cup of baby frozen broccoli pieces. Stirred together and laid the chicken tenderloins on top and cooked on top of stove until rice was tender.

This was OK.  I followed all of the modifications written up by Ginny in Mass (that appear on the front page).  The chicken was VERY moist.  Some of the rice didn't cook, though.  I did like the flavor of the "sauce" created by the cream soups, and I did save and eat the leftover rice and sauce mixture.  But all in all, I don't think I'll make this again.

Good recipe. I made this with brown rice instead of white, used chicken stock instead of water (my husband doesn't like the plain taste of brown rice), and it was yummy. Definitely a recipe that one can play around with, or just keep as is. Thanks for sharing it!
