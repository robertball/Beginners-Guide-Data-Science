Made a 1/2 recipe & got 12 muffins. Though not really wild about these as a muffin. Both the hubby & I thought they tasted more like a cupcake and probably would be good with a lime and/or coconut icing. Most likely won't be making again.

Really good.  As the recipe calls for, I used grapeseed oil, but I had WIldtree lemon grapeseed oil, so used that.  Rather than the whole wheat flour, I used coconut flour, so I doubled the milk since more liquid is needed when using coconut flour.  I didn't add the flaxseed because I didn't have it.  I did use the all purpose flour amount as called for.  I sprinkled the tops with coconut, so when they cooked, the coconut toasted.  I am not sure what size muffin tin the recipe writer used, but I used standard cups and it made about 20 muffins and I only needed to bake them for 20 minutes.

Pretty good.  I had none of the special oils, so I just used regular old vegetable oil, and it worked just fine.  I've been on a mission to use up some of the coconut I have had in the cupboard for what seems like forever.  It's still good, but I wanted to make sure it stays that way, so I thought these would be a good thing to try, especially as I also have flaxseed meal to use up.  These are a hearty, somewhat limey muffin.  This makes 24 regular muffins, so bear that in mind if you are looking to make a small batch.  You will only get a small batch if you make large muffins.  With smaller muffins, I baked for about 25 minutes, which worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted great! Perfect hint of lime and coconut. I cut some of the sugar and replaced a cup of oil with a cup of applesauce. Only critique is it made way more than 10 muffins!
