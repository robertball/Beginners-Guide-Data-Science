The onion flavor was really strong on these when I made them and my family barely touched them. I put the leftovers in a baggy in the fridge and then tried them a couple of days later. The onion had mellowed and they tasted wonderful. I'd make these again but would bake them a day or two ahead of time.

This was, by far the WORST recipe ever.  My daughter spit out the "penny" after two bites, and the only one who enjoys them is the dog!  DO NOT waste your time and money on this one!

I only used 1/2 of the envelope of onion soup mix.  These were well recieved at a party... and I had more than one request for the recipe.  I made these about 1 week in advance and froze them.  (They even taste yummy right out of the freezer!)

I only bought mild cheddar but they were too cheesy for us. Maybe if you added a sauce for dunking.

I used 1 c. flour, 1 tsp. salt  and 1 stick butter for 6  oz grated cheese. Refrigerate 1 hour minimum.  I rolled it in waxed paper like you roll clay to make a snake, then cut into cookies.  Easy to work with and totally delicious.

This recipe sounded good, but the result was a disaster!!  The butter makes them far too greasy, and the taste of the onion soup mix is OVERPOWERING.  I ended up throwing the whole batch into the trash.  Don't waste your time on this.

These were not good, I wish I had made something else New Years Eve.  They were dense and the flavor was terrible.  Don't waste your time with this recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe, although I would have added less soup mix or different spices alltogether. But otherwise they were good! I have tried a different recipe for a similar cheese snack, and this was much easier to roll, as some other recipes are far too crumbly. once you put it on the plastic wrap, it is pretty easy to roll into the log.

Awful! I made these with sharp cheddar because I thought mild would be too flat of a taste. They were terrible. A waste of money and time.

These sounded so good but when I tried them they weren't anything like I expected. Now I am glad I cut the recipe in half. I won't be making these again

Tasted like flour and hardly any other flavor.
