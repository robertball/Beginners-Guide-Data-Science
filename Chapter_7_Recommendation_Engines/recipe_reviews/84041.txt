Utterly forgettable. The description made it sound really tasty, the reality was dry pasta without enough anything all tossed together. I don't think this is worth trying to tweak.

I thought that this recipe was way too greasy and did not have enough flavor.  Would not make it again.

Quick dish and a great way to enjoy chicken and pasta together, esp. if you have an abundance of sage in your garden.  Adding bread crumbs was a neat touch.  With a little personalization this could be a signature dish for anyone whose creative in the kitchen.

next time, I will add a lot more sage and a bit more olive oil, it wasn't as flavorful as I expected.

It was quite bland and disapointing although it was a decent basic recipe.

Rating a 4 instead of a 5 because it needs modifications. With the mods, this is a 5. Per other reviewers, I spruced this up by adding salt and pepper, chopping the garlic, and saut√©ing the chicken in a decent amount of butter (to add more to the sauce). It was really good and light!

This dish was easy and so delicious.  I seasoned the chicken with extra garlic salt. I used less olive oil and some butter.
I will be making this again

To those talking about how this was too plain and bland: I don't know what you're talking about. This was delicious! I'll be making this  many more times. I'll be growing sage in my garden just because of this recipe. 
For those who said it was too greasy or too dry: Use common sense! you can easily drain some of the oil before you add it to the noodles. but for us it was the perfect ratio. not greasy not dry. 
I minced the garlic in my food chopper. added a little more breadcrumbs. I added salt and pepper to the chicken. 
So easy and such great flavors. Breadcrumbs added a nice touch.  We had salad on the side. Perfect meal.

Why this recipe does not include salt and pepper I will never know. I went a step further. After preparing the garlic/crumb mixture I sauted the chicken in the same pan. I added salt and pepper and the some Worcestershire sauce (about a tablespoon) and some chicken broth. Cooked the chicken until it was done and decided it needed a little kick. Siracha sauce is the old standby so I squirted some of that in. More cooking, tasted and it was great. 

I then added the egg noodles (what I had) and the crumb mixture. It soaked up all of the juice. The dish was great, but I would make with thighs next time. I doubled the chicken without doubling the crumb mixture, since I had two breasts in the package. It worked fine, just more chicken.

I really liked this recipe. It tasted exactly as I expected it to--light and subtle--which, admittedly, is a different style than most American pastas. I didn't think it was bland at all, but the garlic cloves I used happened to be giant, so perhaps I used more garlic than the recipe calls for. Also, I used dried thin spaghetti rather than fresh linguine, so that may have affected the texture. Regardless, my whole family liked this one. We'll have it again!

Very disappointed  :(  The recipe sounded very tasty and I was excited to make it!  It was very plain with no flavor.  All I could taste was the olive oil!  Would not recommend.
