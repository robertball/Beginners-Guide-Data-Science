I used vidalia onion instead of red, as that's what I had on hand, and reduced the cilantro by about half due to personal preferences.  I probably used a bit more mango, too, as I used two large ones.   I resisted adding some chopped jalapenos, and although they would have gone nicely in this dish, I think what makes this one special is the nice balance between fresh ginger, the mint and the sweet mango.  It's a pretty mild and sweet salsa - we served with plain old pork chops and it really brightened up my dinner plate, and this would also go well with fish, chicken or shrimp, too.

Fabulous. Thanks Barb. I doubled the ginger as another reviewer suggested and doubled the mango. It was so good. I took an empty bowl home from the church fiesta night.

This recipe was so perfect for shrimp tacos.  I use a little more fresh ginger, it add such a wonderful, different flavor.

I added a jalapeno for a bit more kick. GREAT!! Making it again tonight to add on top of a pretty piece of salmon.

The ginger & mint make this salsa yummy.  It is wolfed down wherever I bring it.  Some of us even put it on our Thanksgiving turkey.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy. I substituted flat leaf parsley for the cilantro as my daughter dislikes cilantro, and used jarred pureed ginger. Served with grilled salmon, and it was a big hit. Thanks!

Excellent, although I modified for what I had on hand. I used a sweet onion instead of a red one and included 1/2 a serrano pepper and a few dashes of cayanne for some up-front spice in addition to the after-burn of the ginger.

I'm still rating this with 5 stars, even though I didn't have any mint.  I can only imagine this would be even better with the mint!  I added some red pepper flakes and a bit of chopped jalapeno because we like the heat.  Try this one...it's good with meats, on fish tacos or with tortilla chips.

The balance of flavors is just perfect, and it freezes very well. So nice when you need something convenient and healthy. Great on pork chops!
