With all the flavorful savory ingredients in this recipe I had high hopes and expectations for a real taste sensation, although I must admit I was a little skeptical about achieving that result by baking rather than sautéing. As it turns out, I was right.  Both Hubs and I were underwhelmed and thought these were kind of boring.  I’d love to try this recipe again, with all its wonderful ingredients, but on the stovetop rather than the oven, where the mushrooms can sauté rather than stew in their juices.

I made this recipe for my husband because he loves mushrooms (I hate them).  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband LOVED them.  He loved them so much, I actually tried them and I could not believe it, but I liked them.  I'll be making these again!!!

We thought this was very good. I only gave it a for because I altered the quantities of the ingredients. I used 1/2 onion, 1 clove garlic, 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/4 cup of wine. It went over well with our herb roasted lamb dinner. My husband, who is not keen on mushrooms, very much enjoyed it and even went back for seconds. Its a keeper in our home.

Excellent! 

Enjoyed the flavors of the thyme with the portabello mushrooms we used (will also try it with morels)! Yes, I too, would prefer this sauteed, and I have enjoyed this dish both ways! But if you are looking to lose some pounds (as many of us are), or on a diet, baked is the way to go, and with the flavors of the spices, and truly to taste the mushrooms (I use portabellos or morels) this dish cannot be beat.

With some ingenuity, anyone can enjoy this recipe as they see fit... But it is obvious to me that the author of this recipe was trying to put forth a very healthy, yet tasty recipe!

This was very good and quick to put together.  A nice mushroom side dish.  I served it with steak, but have to admit I prefer the texture and meatiness of fried mushrooms with my steak.  I will make this again but perhaps not with a steak.

I thought this was so-so.  I much prefer the flavor and texture of sauteed mushrooms.  The good thing about this recipe is that it's easy to make.

We enjoyed this recipe but I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauteed them rather than bake.
I enjoyed the flavoring of this recipe, but don't know if I'll ever do it baked.  There is something about the texture of baked that does not set well.

This turned out to be tasty, (though I substituted sherry for white wine ).  I wasn't as happy with the texture of the mushrooms after they had baked -- which accounts for the 4 stars instead of five.    The fundamental ingredients are good but can be a bit bland..  I added ground black pepper and a dusting of parmesan cheese when they emerged from the oven and that helped.   Next time, I think I'll go back to a stovetop preparation.

These were okay. We enjoyed them with supper, but the leftovers sat in the fridge all week. Good, but not great.

I was running short on time so I sauteed the mushrooms. When they were done I turned off the heat a sprinkled fresh Parmesan cheese on them and covered until the cheese was melted. Delicious! My hubby used them instead of gravy on top of his meatloaf, so that makes this one a keeper.
