Try rolling your chick breasts in egg (beaten) and then flour.  Place in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow the sealing to take place - otherwise your butter oozes out and the seal helps keep it in.  After you pull them out of the refrig - roll in buttermilk and I used plain corn flakes.  I agree with the other reviewer - parsely (even dried) in your butter stuffing mixture makes this more traditional, beautiful and palatable.  In addition, I used minced fresh garlic instead of powdered - just my personal preference.

This is a good recipe, I grew up eating chicken kiev as my family is acually from kiev...I haven't had it in a while because of the high calorie content, but that has now changed, i did make a few changes, first I added fresh parsley to the butter mixture, when it's ready and you pierce the chicken it's much more pallate pleasing that way. Then, I also use a little flour after i roll the chicken, when combining this with eggs instead of the buttermilk, it helps to seal the butter inside. I also double rolled the chicken in bread crumbs. Overall this is a fantastic way to eat chicken kiev, I made it for my eastern european grandma who was a professional chef for 40 years, and she knew the difference right away, but even so found it to be very good. Enjoy!

This is mine but I had a few tips. If you add the rest of the cereal mixture with a little buttermilk/butter they are great to add to each bite of chicken. i call them "crunchies". i kinda guesstimated at the amounts of spices, you can figure out how much of what is best for you. i looove garlic and the sweetness of the cereal with it tastes sooo good. Since the honey sweetened flakes seem to be gone try frosted flakes!! It is very good! also I've made this with chicken tenders, melted the butter mixture and injected them instead of rolling around the frozen butter. faster and easier and just as good!

This was really good, but I made a few minor changes.  Instead of making my own butter, I used pre-made garlic butter.  I won't do this again as the garlic flavour was just too strong.  Instead of using butter milk, I used an egg wash as this seals the chicken so all the butter doesn't leak out.  Lastly, I did not use honey corn flakes, I just used regular cornflake crumbs which I seasoned.  This was a really good/quick dish, we'll definitely eat it again.

This is now one of my husbands favorite meals.  It's easy and quick to make.  I my own variation of it with omitting the garlic powder from the butter mixture and adding some lemon juice.  I also use regular bread crumbs or crushed stuffing mix (when I use stuffing, I don't add the other spices) instead of corn flakes.  Lastly, I dip the chicken in either ranch dressing or eggs (whatever I have around) instead of using buttermilk.  It's a great recipe!

This recipe was sooo good.  I was totally skeptical of the seasonings with the sweet cereal, but they complimented each other so well.  I tried another chicken recipe from this site that I thought I would like but didn't at all, and I almost didn't try this because of it, but it was soo good.  I used some Sazon instead of paprika (didn't have any) and it was just great.  From one Jess to another, Thanks!

My Husband and i rate this a 5 star, it was very good and somewhat easy to make.  Due to the fact that i did not have all the ingredients on hand, I did make a few minor changes, i used plain corn flake cereal, and dried parsley (not fresh).  It turned out great even with the changes.  thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love chicken kiev in restaurants but have never been able to duplicate it at home, this recipe comes close.  The only thing I would change is instead of using sweetened cereal for the coating, I would use plain corn flakes.  Next time I may also just try italian-seasoned bread crumbs and leave out all the other spices that are supposed to go into the coating.  The contrast between the sweetness of the coating and the chicken was just to odd for my family's taste.  Other than that, the chicken tasted great and I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was a great dish.  I switched the garlic powder with some fresh chopped garlic and I used the regular corn flakes instead of the sweetened ones.  I will definately fix this one again.

Excellent flavor.  My husband even liked it.  Couldn't find honey frosted cereal, so used plain old frosted flakes.

The taste isn't bad, but not spectacular either.  The taste alone would warrant 4 stars.  However, I'm giving it 3 because this meal is so darn hard to prepare.  Be prepared for one heck of a mess when you make this.  Is it worth it?  On a regular basis, no, but it is a nice change of pace.

It's not a bad idea to double the sauce/stuffing recipe.  It seemed on the light side to me.

Love this dish. Didnt have corn flakes so I used seasoned croutons  Didnt have buttermilk so I used Egg whites. Sealed in the jucies very nicely. Tossed in some cayenne just to heat things up a bit. Its a simple gourmet meal I think.

I used egg/flour instead of buttermilk...and regular corn flakes. Also, I made a slit in each of the chicken breasts and inserted the butter slabs in those. It kept the chicken moist and prevented leakage. Yum!!

This was exceptionally good! Much better than I expected it to be. I didn't have all the ingredients. I mixed the butter with minced garlic and S&P. I used egg whites instead of buttermilk. And I mixed my (unsweetened) cornflakes with S&P because I didn't have the other ingredients.

Delicious, followed other reviewers and used egg wash, then flour to seal in butter. Let sit in fridge, then I dipped chicken in ranch dressing diluted with milk and rolled in plain corn flake mixture. Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty dish. Next time, I think I might add a few more seasonings to it, as well as doubling the butter mixture. Oh, and use colorful toothpicks so I can find them easier.

this is good - I am glad that I read the reviews and used plain corn flakes. Also - I am increasing the garlic and other seasonings next time out of personal preference.

Very tasty and flavorful! If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would. Preparation was a little time-consuming, but well worth it. I cooked for 36 minutes and chicken was a little dry.. 30 would've been perfect. I may save this one for special occasions. Thanks Jessica!

This was great! I used Kellogs corn flake crumbs instead of the actual cereal and regular milk instead of buttermilk since that was all I had. It was still wonderful. My whole family loved this recipe. I will definately make this again.

I fixed this chicken last night and I have to say that we didn't care much for it.  I wasn't real crazy about the sweet flavor of the honey corn flakes with the chicken.

This was a good dish.  I only had two cups of the frosted flakes, so I also added peanut butter puff cereal and it still turned out good.  The kids liked it, so it's in the rotation now.

Great recipe but I lowered the fat and calories by using muenster cheese instead of butter and frying the chicken w/ veg. spray instead!  It was AMAZING even better than butter!

This recipe was delicious. The chicken was moist and tasty and I like the way it contrasted with the sweet crust. Even my finicky brother ate this.

This was really good!  The only changes I made was to use panko instead of the sweetened corn flakes, and egg whites instead of the buttermilk.  The butter did end up oozing out but I'm sure that was my fault.  Thanks, Jessica.

Wife and 2 year old son loved this.  Very delicious, like the sweet contrast with the spices.  Used Frosted Flakes for the cereal.

I would use 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of 1/4 cup -- I had to add more to bowl in the middle of making it and hands were a mess.  

Thanks for a good keeper.

This recipe is a good alternatative to the real thing, but I had a hard time rolling up the chicken.
I will try again, also I used Chives instead of just parsley,and Panko bread crumbs.

This turned out wonderful! With 5 picky kids, coming up with a chicken dish to please is hard work. This totally fit the bill. For the few kids that didn't want "rolled" chicken, I just breaded theirs with the coating and cooked it with ours. Any butter that leaked out (not to much) made theirs taste even better. This is most definately going in the keeper folder. Thanks

delicious!  Be sure to "wrap up" the chicken breast well with toothpicks so butter mixture doesn't all leak out during cooking.

It was really juicy on th inside and crunchy on the outside.  I didn't use the sweet cornflakes because I didn't think it would taste right.  Definitely deeeelicous.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I will need to adjust the measurements on the seasonings and butter for my own taste.  I scaled down the recipe to 4 breasts and it just seemed more butter, garlic, and parsley was needed.

I have been baking chicken using this similar recipe since I was a kids.  But I've always used rice krispies instead of corn flakes.

I use the same recipe but instead of cereal I make my own bread crumbs with the seasonings on them. I toast them in the toaster oven with the seasonings on them then crush them in a bag before using them to coat the chicken. Everyone is always amazed I am able to whip something so different up in a jiffy. I keep the butter frozen in batches so I can make just two pieces, if I need to.

We loved this.  I used fresh garlic rather than powder for both the butter mixture and the coating, and used crushed rice crispies and bread crumbs for the coating.  Very crunchy and delicious!  Will make for a crowd next time.

I thought this recipe was great. I made it on a Wednesday and from start to finish dinner was on the table in about 1 hour. A little tip for pounding out chicken is to lay out a big piece of plastic wrap (maybe two for more coverage) and then place the chicken breast on that and lay anonther piece on top of the chicken. You can use a frying pan to "wack" the chicken a couple of times and it will thin out then repeat with the same plastic for all other pieces. When you have finished pounding out the chicken you just toss out the plastic wrap and there is no mess. Makes for a quick and easy clean up. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thanks for a lovely recipe Jessica.  The family all loved this chicken dish.  Just make sure you like the taste of honey otherwise it may taste a little too sweet.  Great!

we really enjoyed this dish!  it was a nice change from our usual chicken fare.  I chose to use panko bread crumbs instead of the crushed cereal.  The chicken turned out juicy and tender, and was very flavorful.  The technique with freezing the butter was a new idea for me, but worked perfectly. i did use a butter spread instead of real butter to lower the calories and fat, as well.  very good!

Good recipe! Didn't have Honey coated corn flakes so melted down 3 tbsp. honey and added to buttermilk before coating chicken with corn flake mixture. Also added strips of mozzarella cheese with butter strips before rolling. Super yummy!

I think the breasts needed a bit more butter/parsley filling, but besides that - awesome :D  I used fresh minced garlic cloves and chopped green onion in place of the powders.

I have made it a few times already and have now changed it up- I use fresh garlic (usually atleast 6 or 7 cloves) and I've been adding a TBSP or 2 of lemon/black pepper marinade(the regular ol'kind in a bottle for marinading chicken) to the butter mixture to give it a bit more of that lemony flavor that I've had in other kiev recipes. thanks for sharing this one jessica! the picky kids request it atleast once a week, I'm a big fan of how its not a fried recipe full of too many calories.

Fabulous! My family ate every bit of it! I will try stuffing the chicken with cheese and bacon or smoked deli turkey next time. The butter in te middle made this dish a little greasy. Minced garlic in place of powdered is much better. Enjoy!

I did this exactly like the recipe said, and the butter didn't "leak out."  However, my husband and I were put off by the sweet flavor from the corn flakes.  Next time, I would use regular corn flakes.

Very good!  The butter made the chicken very moist, and I liked the crispiness of the breading.  I thought the sweetened cereal added an interesting twist.  I used chicken tenders for increased surface area and dried parsley because that was all I had.

Very easy dish to prepare.  The chicken was wonderful and moist!  It looks fancy too. I made only 3 chicken breasts and sliced the butter into only 3 strips.  It's easily feeds a couple or a croud! Thank you!

This is a good recipe. I gave it four stars for the breading. I think next time, and there will be one, I'll go with regular corn flakes as others have. The sweetness was just too much for me. Also, for all the garlic powder in there, I couldn't taste it at all. I think the sweetness of the cereal is taking away from the other flavors.

A cast-iron skillet makes flattening a breeze. I had that done in no time. I think I spent more time crushing the cereal. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was good but not fantastic. I find pounding chicken to be a pain and this recipe wasn't worth it. I did like how it was baked and not fried. I changed a few things. I used plain corn flakes and not sweetened. I also followed others' suggestions and dipped in seasoned flour, egg, then the corn flakes. I wanted a tighter seal. This had very good flavor but it's getting 4 stars because it was a pain :)

It was good, but that's about all I can say. My butter oozed out all over the pan. This may be my fault, but I've made this recipe twice taking extra special care with the tuck and fold and tooth picking, but it oozed again! I even tried the flour and milk trick someone else suggested. Does anyone have any really good tips on how to keep this from happening????? PS. I also used regular cornflakes as honey flavored seemed a bit funky for me. Very good if the butter would stay put!

This was delicious but more involved than something for a weeknight meal. My butcher suggested already tenderized chicken breasts and said to use a rolling pin to just roll them flatter. Saved time and mess! I used ready-made cornflake crumbs and dipped the breasts in egg before dipping them in the buttermilk. This seemed to help keep the butter inside better. Everyone loved this and I will definitely make it again.

When I read the recipe it sounded like something very interesting, but it was quite disappointing. I used plain cornflakes, but followed all the other directions. My husband didn't like it, and I didn't like it too much either. I will not make it again.

I baked for 40 minutes, perhaps 30 would have been better.  The meat was dry.  Granted, I did use plain cornflakes, but I thought the dish lacked flavor.

I have very picky eaters in my house and it is very hard to get them to stray from the norm, but with this recipe it was easy, the sweet breading is a wonderful touch.

OK, I sort of made it! I had a hard time pounding the breasts - little pieces kept flying all around! I read that one person thought it was too time-consuming so I decided to sprinkle the garlic & parsley onto the pounded breasts. I picked some fresh basil off my plant placing some leaves on top of the garlic & parsley. Then simply sliced the hard butter and wrapped the meat around it, securing with toothpicks, rolled it in regular milk, then in breadcrumbs seasoned with Italian seasonings. I placed the 4 rolls into a small baking dish, drizzled melted butter over them & baked 45 minutes at 375 degrees. I found this not too tedious and I will make it again. My husband, who is incredibly picky, said it was very spicy - the fresh basil (Boy, was it!) - and that he would eat it again. And yes, even with all the extra steps removed, it is still a lot of work; something you need to plan ahead.

This is a very good, simple recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. Only thing is next time I think I will use fresh garlic and maybe a few more spices just to really get that flavor in there. As is, this recipe is great though! Will be making it again!

This was really good.  I rolled the breasts in an egg/flour mixture and refrigerated that for a few hours.  I used bread crumbs.  Really really good!

Instead of using the cereal, use instant mashed potatoes instead.  I mixed the instant potatoes with 3/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and it was crispy and delicious!

The chicken was great, but I think I flunked on the "crunchies," as they ended up more like "soggies." FYI-Frosted Flakes has a new product that is called "Frosted Flakes Gold" which is honey coated, that's what I used. Worked like a charm.

We like this pretty well. I didn't have corn flakes, so I used crushed corn chips. Very crispy! I used chopped garlic in my butter mixture. I also salted & peppered the chicken breasts after pounding them, and also added a little dried basil. Next, I secured with toothpicks, dunked in egg beaters, and then coated in crushed corn chips. I melted more butter, added in more chopped garlic, and used that to grease my baking dish. Turned out very well - even my picky kids ate it.

A very good recipe - I used packaged corn flake crumbs (much easier) and an egg wash instead of the buttermilk. I had a minor amount of butter leakage during baking - but the chicken swas still tasty. I used fresh garlic in both the butter mixture and the corn flake coating (4 cloves all together). I'll make again, trying for an even tighter seal.

This was good; I will surely make this again.  My only confusion came when the recipe called for honey sweetened corn flakes.  I found regular plain corn flakes & sugar corn flakes (like Frosted Flakes) so I wasn't sure which to get.  I opted for plain Corn Flakes & it was good...but still I'm not sure I got the "right" one!

Very good recipe, I substituted the cereal with bread crumbs, which worked just as well.  I know many people have complained about the butter, but I didn't have any trouble with it.  If the meat is pounded enough and then rolled tight enough only a nominal amount of butter leaks. Good recipe for a cold night and relatively easy to make.

Not bad, but a lot of work for a weeknight meal.  It requires a lot of diligence with the toothpicks to keep the butter in, and still you can't prevent some of it leaking out.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used egg and milk to help with the leakage and it was fairly well contained, but could not prevent it all.  This didn't really taste like Chicken Kiev to us, but had a nice flavor anyway.  I did not use cornflake crumbs, but rather used Garlic and Herb bread crumbs.  It is a nice recipe, but I probably won't be making it again any time soon.

Not bad, but not like any Kiev I've ever ordered. Baking it causes the butter filling to melt and run out of each chicken roll. The tops were dry and the bottoms were soaked in butter.  But the chicken was moist and tender.

This recipe was fairly easy and very yummy.  I made it for company and they loved it.  The cereal on the outside was fun and sweet!
