Your basic chicken soup recipe found in most general cook books. It is the old reliable of chicken soup recipes. I appreciated the hint to cut the carrots, celery and onions in half. I had always cut them up in small pieces, and then when I would drain the broth, it was messy to try to retrieve the cut up veggies to put them back in the broth. This is so much easier! When I drain the broth, I place a paper towel in the sieve. It makes for a nice clear broth. I also cook up some noodles to add to the soup. I do not like to add the noodles directly to the pot of soup, because the noodles will aborb too much of the broth.

I give this a three as written. But with changes it moves up to a four. I added some fresh herbs, and did not use the veggies that were in the stock, because the veggies had lost all of there flavor. I used freshly chopped veggies. Then I added 2 cups of water with 2 cubes of chicken bouillon.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I used about 2 1/2 lbs. of cut up chicken and used 4 packets of Goya Chicken Bouillon and I think that probably was the secret to seasoning this soup.  I used baby carrots and put two whole (scrubbed with the peel on) potatoes in the bottom of the pot with chicken.  I followed the instructions and let it cook, took the chicken off the bone and returned everything to the pot after I cut up the veggies.  I then added some frozen vegetable soup cut veggies (celery, peas, onion, potatoes, okra, etc.) and ditalini pasta.  My son has a cold and this soup really hit the spot with him, even in 110 degree weather! I really recommend this soup recipe!  I put half in individual containers in our freezer and my son, who wants soup every day, will be set for at least a few days!

This recipe is very tasty though it is also very basic - which is perfect for the beginner chef.  Once you begin to "doctor" your own recipes, you will see that the more flavors you add to chicken broth, the better. For example, why stop with carrots and celery? In addition to these things, I add a potato, tomato, fresh basil, fresh parsley, red peper, onion, etc... Make sure to be generous with the salt as stock can be quite bland unless seasoned appropriately. I even use a couple of bay leaves and a couple of peppercorns during the cooking process.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer. I use a lid on my soup to keep evaporation to a minimim, though I "vent" the lid with a wooden spoon during cooking (kind of props up the lid) so that it isn't completely sealed shut...  Add water 1/2 way through cooking if necessary.  Boullion is OK, but not necessary if you have the appropriate blend of chicken, veggies and herbs.  Serve with rice or your noodle of choice.  Never cook noodles in the broth - always in a separate pot because the starch will ruin your soup. The more you times you make this recipe, the more you will enjoy it - as it is definitely a process of trial and error. ENJOY!

Wonderful soup, I cooked the soup w/out carrots & potatoes most of the day, adding them in the last hour.  For a little extra taste I added some cumin.  The whole family loved it, great for a blustery and rainy day here in the great northwest!

Pretty good soup. I used a roasted chicken carcass from our previous nights dinner as I feel it adds more flavor then the uncooked chicken. I also used canned chicken broth in lieu of the water, along with my usual seasonings. We're eating a lot of soup these days as it's frigid here in northwest N.J.! Thanks Jill!

Yummy.  I followed the recipe as written - and at the end - added "uncooked star shaped pastas" and cooked an additional 10 minutes - making it Homemade Chicken Soup with Stars.  I submitted a photo of the finished project.

This is a great recipe to work with as your base for your own chicken noodle soup.

I usually follow the general idea of it to make my stock, adding a bunch of garlic and a couple other spices.

Then I add my own veggies to the soup. If you like beans in your chicken soup, add beans. Basically, add whatever you enjoy!

This was the first time making Chicken Soup from scratch, and I was surprized at how simple it was.  My husband wanted homemade noodles with it so I used Pat's recipe for "Basic Pasta", and it turned out GREAT!  We added the noodles to the soup, and let them boil for about 15 minuites, and served.  I saved the leftovers, and they tasted even better the second time!!!  I also added a bit more water while the chicken was boiling.  I will definatly be making this again!

This is a very good start for chicken soup.  It can be easily adjusted to suit your taste.  Just about any combination of herbs will work with this.  My hubby and 2 little ones are sick with this stomach virus stuff and I'm thinking that chicken soup would be good for their tummies.  I'm planning on using this as a starting point.  Thanks Jill.

Basic or good?? Some advice: 1. Don't chop chicken parts in small parts: these will surface in water and make for hard skimming. 2. Boil first the meat (16 cups of water), on medium heat: start with cold water for tastier soup, or with warm water for tastier meat.  3. Skim often and add a spoon of cold water to make up for loss. 4. When no more foam, salt (now!) lightly and add cleaned vegetables. Add also a big celery root, quartered and 4 turnips. Bring fast to a boil, then simmer for more than 3 hours. 5. Chop vegetables before serving. Note: always salt while preparing, otherwise the vegetables are not tasty. Adjust taste at the table.

Changes I made to this good basic recipe: Boil 3.5  or 4 LB chicken first (add 1 tablespoon salt after boil begins) and skim the foam until it is almost gone.  Then add UN-PEELED, washed veggies (I add 2 quartered onions, 1 parsnip, 6 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and also a large quartered yam) and simmer for about 60 minutes.  Remove chicken to plate and take meat off of bones.  Return bones and skin to pot with cooked veggies and simmer another 60 minutes.  Pour soup into large strainer sitting on bowl big enough to hold soup.  Strain again if you wish.  Then toss out veggies, bones, skin and return soup to stove and add fresh bite size pieces of carrots.  Bring soup to boil and then turn off . Then add some chopped broccoli. Carrots and broccoli will be done in 1/2 hour.    Ready to eat!

Recipe was great.  The only changes I made were to change out the veggies when I was taking the meat off the bone. I added fresh basil, parsley, potatoes, celery, carrots, onions and half a cube of chicken buillon. I also ensured that I strained the broth  through a napkin. The result was beautiful broth and great tasting veggies! I also cooked some extra wide noodles on the side and added them when serving the soup. I found that chicken soup tastes better once it has rested for about 30 mins to an hour. My boyfriend and I kept going back for refills all evening!

This was very good! I did make my own stock..Whole chicken covered in water, a leek, whole onion, fresh Tyme, fresh Basil, 2 carrots, celery, salt and pepper corns.  Boiled until the meat was tender (hour) then strained the broth..Strain with a cheese cloth if you want clear broth but not needed..(kids and I ate the veggies) Then I followed the recipe minus the onion since I boiled it in the broth and have a little one who won't eat it.  I added a few teaspoons of chicken bouillon, salt, pepper then I added wide egg noodles. As I read before the noodles do absorb some of the liquid but mine still had plenty. My kids moaned the whole process saying it smelled so good they couldn't take it.  Then when they ate it were raving about how good it was :)  love to hear it.  Thank you for this recipe!!  Very good. Will share this with others and absolutely make again!

I prefer to use water I put refrigerator after a few day the clorine evaporates and tastes better.I use an oversized stainless stock pot.I like to add some parsely and a bay leaf;a cayene peper wont hurt is you like some heat.The trick is to simmer not boil;after the bottom of the chicken is tender I flip it.Dont forget to descum.After the soup is done I fill the sink up with ice water and chill the soup;befor putting in the refrigerator.The next day I debone and skim off all the fat and scum that solidified over night.

This is a good recipe for a base start.  I combined ideas from this recipe and barefoot contessa's.  I followed the first recipe by boiling everything together for 1 hour plus I added ginger, a head of garlic and thyme.  Then I strained everything, pulled the meat off the chicken and put the chicken and broth back together in the pot on the stove (discarded everything else as it had lost all its flavor and nutrition).  In a separate pot I then sauteed garlic then onion, celery and carrots to caramelize a bit and then added them to the broth.  I also added a little more fresh parsley, garlic, ginger and thyme to serve.  Brought it up to a simmer for a few mins and shut it off.   Very tasty.

This was very good.  Incidentally, you have to salt, salt, salt.  When the soup was cooking, there was no foam on the top.  After refrigerating it, however, I was able to strain some fat that had collected.  I did not use any extra broth or bouillon but did add bay leaves, fresh basil, fresh oregano, and garlic to the initial pot.  I think it really needs these additions.  As recommended, I threw out the cooking vegetables and added some more 20 mins before serving.  I cooked some fusilli separately (there weren't any egg noodles at Trader Joe's) and put them in later.  However, they still sopped up a ton of broth and ended up a bit swollen.  Next time I will add them at the very end.  Perhaps egg noodles would have fared better.  This would be freaking awesome with some matzoh balls!!

Delicious!  Make sure you use a whole chicken to get the homemade chicken soup flavor and benefits.  You'll never go back to the canned version.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe. The key to good chicken soup is the chicken, bottom line!! They probibly used an old rubber one (LOL). Try and get a soup chicken, not a fryer, or baking one, you may to go to a meat market, butcher shop. Get one with fat, and not an old one. I made the soup everyone LUVed it. No need for boulion either !!

I never made chicken soup before and thought this was a wonderful recipe. I did add additional seasoning such as bay leaf, pepper, oregano and a couple of cubes of bouillon. Just seasoned to taste. I also liked only halving the vegetables. Thank you.

I made this recipe nearly as written, substituting a 2.5lb package of chicken thighs for the whole chicken (because I had them in my freezer already), and it made a perfect, basic soup.  I did not add the optional bouillon cubes and found that liberal seasoning with salt/pepper was just right for a flu-stricken palate.  I can see using the broth produced by this method as the base for a chicken noodle soup or adding additional herbs and spices to add variety to the traditional chicken soup.  I had some cooked brown rice on hand, and found that adding a bit of that to a serving of the soup also worked very well.  I will certainly be making this wholesome soup again - from now on it will be my go-to recipe when I need a good chicken soup!

Perfect basic feel-good soup.  I used extra broad egg noodle & the family could not get enough of it.

This is a great basic chicken soup recipe, but add some zucchini, squash, and the right spices, and it will be an awesome recipe.  Great for cold days....

I used to make chicken soup for my mom this way!  You brought back some good memories.  Cut the vegetables big so you can put them back in or use them for something else.  You can always add more veggies after straining.  Also, for the noodle question, I would cook the noodles separately and add them as you eat, unless you like them mushy.  Some brown or wild rice goes right in the pot very well (just give it time to cook).  Yummy, thank you for sharing.

This was a very simple basic recipe. I used leftover of a rotisserie chicken, I added some cabbage, 1 medium potato, fresh cilantro and some noodles.

This was so easy and my husband and the kids loved it.  I made extra broth by adding more water and chicken boilloun cubes.  I also added extra wide egg noodles for a delicous chicken noodle soup.  Freeze the extra broth for use later and add noodles.  Yummy!!!

Yum! Feel so good after having this when I'm sick! I fried the onions with a little garlic and ginger paste in the beginning - does wonders to the flavor! Also added 2 cubes of chicken bullion.

This is basically how I make mine, except I add fresh rosemary stalks and a couple of bay leaves. Sometimes, I add noodles or rice too. Makes for a hearty meal. Thanks! Judy

Very good chicken soup.
I would say this recipe is for more experienced cooks who have had practice in making their own broth. I had a hard time getting the right flavour, especially since I prefer a stronger flavour, so I like to add chicken broth as well as the bouillon. One thing I would suggest is to use the veggies to flavour the broth, but to put fresh ones in towards the end. If you put them in from the start, they get way too mushy.

I made it today for me and my mother. It finished so fast that I couldn't take a photograph and post here..
Well, my brother (staying in up-stairs) came down to have it just because of the smell of the soup..
By the way, the soup is soo tummy filling...

I used new veggies afterward, they lost flavor and were too soggy. Great flavors for the recipe I give it a three for the unexpected extra steps I had to take cutting up more veggies.

I liked the recipe, it was easy to make.  I used roasted chicken leftovers rather then a raw chicken, thinking it would have more flavor.  However, I think the soup needs something but I'm not sure what, a missing spice maybe. Otherwise, it was a good beginning at making homemade soup.

I have a question  I use water and a on the bone chicken breast to make my broth. I use about 5 cups per breast.  I'm seeing so many recipes calling for using chicken broth (canned) I'd like to get more flavor but I really don't want to use a canned broth I feel like I might as well just open a can of Campbells.  Also I remember my mother using a soup chicken which was a fatty chicken.  I guess those days are gone or where should I be looking?

Thank you

This is an excellent base for Chicken soup, I made my first ever batch yesterday.

Since I only had fresh Cilantro on hand, I decided to give my soup a Latin flavor and added Cumin, Lime zest, and rice.

My wife, who doesn't like soup, raved about this batch, and I was very happy with the finished product.

Great. I used chicken quarters instead of the whole chicken and I think it was probably less messy in the long run.  I strained off the foam as suggested but in the end did not strain the broth. Because they were quarters I just served the chicken with the soup.  I also added potatoes and baby carrots at the end of cooking versus the begining along with the onion.  Plus I added about a 1/4 of a large tomato and also added garlic salt. In the end I used a lot of salt.  I am not sure if my potatoes were absorbing it, but I used about 3 tablespoons of salt!  Great recipe.

I first made this soup last month when my husband and I became very sick for days with a stomach flu.  We could only keep down ginger ale and crackers.  We were getting very hungry so I decided to try this recipe.  I pulled chicken breasts from the freezer and just threw it into the pot (frozen) with the celery, carrots and onions.  I added chicken bouillon and as I just had a new shipment of Pensey’s spices I also added thyme, oregano, sage and parsley.  Before long just the aroma made us both feel better!  When cooked I just cut up the chicken and veggies and served.  My husband loved it!!  Today I am cooking it today (by special request) and after reading some of the reviews I think the only change I’ll make is to discard the vegetables after the broth is made and add fresh veggies before serving.

I am an extremely beginner cook and this recipe turned out great for me! I was only making it for myself, so I used a boneless, skinless chicken breast, and I added powdered chicken bouillon, which I found necessary, as the broth alone was a little bland. I added barley on a whim. It tasted wonderful and made it more filling. Definite do again! Thank you!

This recipe makes awesome good soup.  My whole family loves it.  Sometimes I put it in the crock pot overnight.  In the morning, I continue with the recipe and usually will add a bag of Amish egg noodles. Mmm Mmm good!

I agree with others, that this is a fine basic recipe and needs some added spicing up.  For sure, I always like to add ginger...especially if it's during "cold" season.  And some cayenne pepper, too, to help it open up the sinuses!

I add peppercorns when beginning the soup.  I strain the carrots, celery, onion and peppercorns when chicken is down.  I start with fresh carrotts and celery in the broth and add more boulon and chicken broth instead of adding more water.

This was my first stab at a homemade chicken noodle soup and it came out good.  I used a roasting chicken as that is all that I had that I had cut into parts before cooking.  I didnt use the onions as my 6 yr old is not a fan.  At the end of the cooking I added a little bit of College Inn Chicken Broth.  It turned out well.  Also I added wide egg noodles that I also cooked in the chicken broth.

This was a lot more like my mom's chicken soup than some of the other recipes.  It makes a lot, so I froze a ton and have been able to take it out of the freezer for cold nights and no time for cooking.  Hubby loved it when I added some egg noodles:)

I wasn't too happy with this recipe.  I found that the broth was bland and the vegetables were too mushy to use throughout the cooking.  In the middle of cooking, I started to follow another recipe from this site, which used more seasonings and used fresh vegetables in the end of cooking.  With that recipe and a few variations that I made, the soup turned out great.  But, if I stuck to following this recipe, I would not have been happy with the way it turned out.  As a side note, however, I tend to like flavorful meals, which is why I did not like this soup.  But, if you like bland flavors, this recipe would be good for you.

Excellent!  I added a can of cream of chicken soup.  I didn't have any bullion cubes.  I also put in a bit of tarragon...love the flavor.  It turned out most wonderful for a crisp autumn day.  Thank you!

My poor roommate was sick with the flu and I decided to make this for him. I'm a beginner cook but this was soooo easy. I took the advice of other reviewers and discarded the soggy, tasteless veg at the end of the cooking time - I tried a bite of celery and it had no flavor left - and added some fresh veg then cooked for another 30 mins. I also added some chicken base. In the end, I think it could use more flavor, perhaps more herbs or something. Maybe more salt, but that might just be my inexperience. In general, it was just super-easy to make, delicious and perfect for my roommate who loved it. I'll definitely make this again in the future. Thanks so much!

Great basic recipe.  Fast and little effort goes into this soup...which comes in handy when you don't feel so great yourself :)  I just added a bit of chicken breast (diced), onion, celery, carrots, water and let it simmer.  Everyone loves the smell of chicken soup so I let it simmer for 2+ hours.  Last I add egg noodles...boil and eat it with crackers.  Nothing better!!

Great basic chicken soup recipe. I had never made homemade chicken soup before, and this was a wonderful starting point. One thing I did need was to add more salt as it was pretty bland. I also added a few different veggies because I had them on hand, and it turned out great.

My 10 year old son could simply not get enough of this meal. I added plain ramen noodles so it was less of a soup and more of a noodle dish. My rating is based on my son's review since any meal that my children rave over is a 5 in my opinion. I added a chilli garlic sauce (prepackaged) to my serving to give it more oomf. I will certainly make again.

There really is no other way to make chicken soup! I used baby carrots and instead of a whole bird, I used 6 split breast halves. (that's all I had on hand) I have made it this way ever since I learned how to cook! definitly have to add chicken boullion!

One of my all time favorites. I add 4 or 5 chicken boulions to the soup. A half an hour before it is time to eat, I boil egg noodles with 2 to 3 chicken boullion cubes and empty the entire contents into the soup. Yum! Thanks for one of my all time favorite, easy, and delicious recipes!

Very flavorful!  I added more water (as it cooked off), a can of chicken broth, and sliced fresh mushrooms.  Did not add the chicken bouillion.  The celery became mushy so I had to fish them out and add new ones toward the end.  Next time I will add all the vegetables for the soup a half hour before the end of cooking.  
I followed a previous reviewer's recommendation and added a dash of cumin -- that was a nice touch!  Made the soup very savory.  Also added herbes de provence and the result was delicious.  One more thing - my chicken was 5 lbs.  That was too much meat to soup ratio in my standard sized pot.  Next time I'll cook a 3 lb chicken like the recipe says!

A classic must-have recipe for the home cook!  Just a simple, rustic recipe, to which you can adjust the seasonings as you desire (I added fresh sage).  Just be careful at the end when removing the carcass from the broth...mine was so tender that it started to fall apart...the giblets, etc. almost fell into broth.

Good chicken soup! I did not use the optional bouillon granules, and it came out needing salt, so I added some after straining the broth and it was good. Made it for my husband when he was sick with the flu and he loved it! Will definitely make again.

Per the suggestion of another user, I used an already cooked chicken portion, so I bought a rotisserie chicken from the market and used about half for the soup. I did not use any onions or salt and pepper since the chicken was already well cooked, but The rest was true to the recipe with no added ingredients other than the already optional teaspoon of bouillon. The soup was flawless. No noodles needed!

I agree, this is a basic chicken soup recipe.  What I did to customize this recipe, I added 2 envelopes of chicken gravy, to thicken it up a bit, and that extra chicken flavor.  Just wonderful.

This soup was wonderful I'm a senior citizen and have never made chicken soup from scratch my mother always made everything from scratch. My neighbor is getting out of the hospital tomorrow so I made a pot for her and her husband. My husband rated it 5 stars. Guess that's good enough. thanks for the recipe.

Pretty straight forward. However, omit the bouillon, and opt for chicken base. Make sure salt is at least the 3rd ingredient. Get this from GFS, or Sams,ect. It makes the difference between too salty and rich taste.

I made this soup to prepare myself (and my family) for when I return home from having surgery(I wanted something wholesome and easy to store and reheat for us to be able to have for dinner/lunch for a couple of days). I didnt add the vegetables until perhaps the last 20 minutes of cooking because I didnt want them to be too mushy. I used baby carrots, used skinless chicken breast, and added chopped tomatoes. The soup turned out very delicious and satisfying.  Even my picky 6 year old liked it and ate the carrots.  I made some simple mexican rice and served over the soup.  Very filling and tasty.

Definitely will make again. I added the onions, carrots and celery after the chicken had boiled for 60 or so minutes. Veggies get too soggy if you throw them in right away. ( Of course, I was using an un cooked bird, which takes a good 90 minutes) Added bay leaf, egg noodles and thyme, used a healthy amount of kosher salt and strained through a strainer with paper towels for a much cleaner broth. I think a green garnish like chives would add to the beauty of this soup. Enjoy

Basic recipe for beginner chefs.  I like to saute my  carrots and celery before putting in soup, it locks in some of flavor and prevents them from becoming too mushy. Also a couple of crushed cloves of garlic is good. Also, you can make this basic recipe with any ethnic twist. Indian style, add a little curry powder. Italian,  add basil oregano and sprinkle with grated parmesan. Mexican, add a container of salsa. Greek, add spinach and squeeze lemon. Have fun!

It was wonderful and easy, just a bit time consuming but delicious! I love it!

I did add 3 bouillon cubes though, it was a bit too bland for me.

Good basic recipe.  I learned a trick with turkey and chicken, which is to break the bones with a hammer and stew them in the broth for added flavor.  No bullion needed, then. So, you need to cook it once to get the meat done, then again with the bones in.  Cook veggies, throw them out, then add fresh ones.  Also, I use some garlic in the original broth.  :)

I'd suggest adding lots of garlic and cayenne (if sick) and a bouquet garni (thyme, bay, sage, parsley).  I also added fresh-grown summer savory just for fun since I had no marjoram.  Oregano would work as well.  But, I know, you don't want to add too many herbs or the flavors get a little too "complex" or overdone.

Easy recipe, although I had to doctor it up to give the broth flavor.  I added sage, thyme, rosemary, a lot of salt and a few garlic cloves.  Then it was delicious!

This was the best chicken soup I have ever had! I will be making this over and over! I did not have a whole chicken in the house so used thighs. My husband raved about how tender and moist the chicken was. Can't wait to make it again and add hearty greens.

| agree with most of the others-good basic recipe which you can tweak to make your own. I added a few whole peeled garlic cloves at the start to make the stock and put in lots of carrots, celery, and onion later. I added boullion as well as some crushed red pepper, Tony's creole seasoning, and parsley near the end of the cooking time and cooked some pasta seperately and added before serving. To change it up, try adding some lemon juice, a dollop of sour cream, fresh grated parmesean cheese, or all three to individual servings. Mmmmm.....

I added potatoes and some pasta towards the end.  I made the recipe as is only did not use the vegetables that I used in the stock.  Instead I sauteed carrots, onions, and chopped celery together and added it to the seasoned stock when I started my soup.I am not a fan of overcooked veggies. It was wonderful.

This was my 1st attempt  at chicken soup.  I was very happy with the end result.  I also altered the recipe.  I disregarded the vegetables after cooking the chicken and added fresh ones later.  Also added 4 gloves of garlic.  I took the advise of another reviewer and added 4 packets of goya chicken bouillon .  I added peas also.  The house smells like my moms!  It's a very windy day here.  So, this is a perfect dinner for us tonight!

This was delicious. I did alter the recipe a bit by adding 2   medium sized potatoes, diced and some egg noodles. The family ask that I keep the recipe and make it more often. My wife took some to the inlaws and they to loved it and asked me to make sure to send them some more the next time I make it. Also love that it is so easy to make. Thanks for sharing.

Simple and delicious.  I added chicken bone broth along with my chicken because I only had deboned chicken breast.  I added tricolor carrots and a sweet potato the firm kind, with the pale flesh. Everything else the same.

This recipe was an excellent basic recipe for chicken soup and allowed for a lot of flexibility -- my favourite type of recipe.  I used a leftover chicken carcass from a previous meal and used chicken broth instead of bullion.  I also added a couple bay leaves, parsley, onion powder and some cumin as others suggested and finished it off with some noodles (cooked separately).  I used new carrots and celery after straining for fuller flavour.  

Thanks everyone!  This is my first time making chicken soup and it was fantastic.

Pretty much the way I make soup.  May I suggest adding the center tender stalks AND the leaves.  The leaves add so much more flavor.  Also if you wait until the next day to serve this you can lift the solidified fat off the top of soup before you reheat it.

I've used this recipe several times. Only I buy a rotisserie chicken, remove the skin and bones, and throw it in to expedite the cook time for weeknight meals. I use chicken and vegetable broth for ease, and I also like to throw in whole peppercorns as well as crushed.

Good basic recipe. Someone mentioned bouillon not being homemade. I think that it still is considered a spice and I love the taste it adds. But if you don't want to add that, I like adding a little bit of tomato sauce in mine. I make mine with carrots, corn (cut in 3's), potatoes (just 1 usually ), cabbage, garlic, onion, and squash. Very tasty! But I think all chicken soup is :)

Great simple recipe to start with and I look forward to playing with it. I added potato because I had it on hand. Everyone liked it, it was cheap and there was not much cleaning up to do afterward. Very nice recipe for traveling abroad as most of the ingredients are readily available in many cities if you enjoy cooking for others while traveling.

I'm giving this a 3 because in my humble opinion homemade doesn't involve the use of chicken bouillon and that's what I was looking for. I think if you add enough herbs when you're boiling down the broth and later to your soup you won't need manufactured bouillon, that's what I did using this as a basic recipe minus the bouillon.
I threw some sage, rosemary, bay leaf, thyme, (dill I think?) whole peppercorns...anything I could think of that goes with chicken into the broth when I boiled it.
I didn't take everything out of the pan before straining, I just dumped the broth and all over a colander and strained it into a big bowl that way. Picking out pieces of chicken right from the colander. I too used fresh veggies in the final soup. 
Then I threw in all the other herbs I mentioned before and added salt only to taste. Next time I'm going to throw in a little bit of raw brown rice too.

Very easy to make especially when I'm not feeling well! I used drumsticks instead of a whole chicken and found it very easy to de-bone them.

Very good, recipe for chicken soup.  It's basic enough that you can add your own variations to the recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend when he was sick with a nasty cold.  (I actually added a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a kick.)  He claims it was just what he needed.  :)

Nice basic recipe. For a rich color, I cook it with onion skins. Yellow onion skins for a light brown or add red onion skins for a very dark broth. Just discard after straining broth.

I never made chicken soup before. This was just what I was looking for,a basic soup recipe. It came out so good. I did add a potato and some different veggies as I do not like celery (I added red/green pepper)but that was all and it came out perfect! 
Thanks :)

For years I have been making very complex chicken soups. However, I wanted a plain, ol' comfort food recipe and this fit the bill completely. I like a little more oomph with my spices so I added a layer of Ruth Ann's Muskego Ave Seasoning from Penzey's and it was awesome!! This is a great recipe!

love this soup.  I add a chunk of ginger root (scored with a fork) and some fresh dill. YUM!  Sometimes I add some pureed squash, cauliflower or sweet potatoes for my pickier eaters.  i don't boil the veggies with chicken bone, I like to skim off the fat first.

This is definitely the most easiest homemade chicken soup! This soup reminds me of how my grandmother would make it. I did add 2 crushed chicken bouillon cubes and about 30 minutes before it was done, I added some potatoes. YUM! This is a keeper!

Very good and tasty... and easy to make. My only point would be that a mention to delay the addition of  faster cooking vegetables until the end should be made. Otherwise they become too muchy.  Thank you for that excellent recipe.

Good basic recipe. I added pees and corn, based on personal preference, along with pasta.  I used a partly eaten rotisserie chicken so that I didn't have to worry about the meat being done.  I also subbed chicken broth in for half of the water.  Definitely needed the optional 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon.

Really just looked this up to see the difference in my chicken soup. 
I sometimes add dumplings,  I don't like egg noodles so I use a hardy pasta like elbows or centellinni (like a double elbow)! 
I add broccoli, garlic cloves, poultry seasoning and I like coriander seeds whole but others in my family like for me to crush them with my mortar and pestle. 
The rest is the same.  ; )

This is as good as it gets,your basic tried and true recipe.Thanks to Jill for posting.I buy chicken thighs in bulk so I used 4 thighs (skinless) and since I cook for my 80 yr. old mom I added some cooked rice.We want her-like us- consuming less sodium so I have begun making more soups as we do not like canned,plus I have the luxury of a deep-freeze.My honey was sick so he ate most of the soup over the course of 2 days so I made another batch.Plus another for the freezer!

I halved the onion and it was still a bit oniony for me. Otherwise it was good.

So simple and very delicious!   I had  heard the chicken soup can help a person to recover from a cold so I made the soup as soon as I was up to it.   I especially liked the simplicity of it by just cutting tge vegetables in half when cooking it and then chop them after all was cooked.  I added some sprigs of parsley.   I’ll be making the recipe again.

Made this using bone in chicken breasts. Followed the recipe as written except for the following additions. Some poultry seasoning, 1 cup of long grain rice for more bulk, and a can of Cream of Chicken soup for a richer taste. Trying my second time now using a whole 6 lb chicken. Doubling up everything so we will have lots to freeze for later dinners.

I followed this recipe, however I simmered for 3 hrs,  skimming throughout,  strained, added more slivered carrots, celery and onions, cooked another hour, cooled and added gluten free noodles once the broth was cooled! Definitely a good starter broth.

I used chicken drumsticks and thighs instead of a whole chicken. Removed the skin and trimmed all the visible fat as much as possible before cooking. Added a whole onion and 6 cloves of smashed garlic cloves to add more flavor to the broth. After straining the broth and returning it to heat, I added 2 chopped carrots, chopped kale and a teaspoon of herbs de provence.  Boiled some noodles in a separate pot (just 1.5 cups cooked) and added to soup right before serving.

Excellent homemade soup recipe. I used chicken breast I had already cooked. I added it to the soup once the vegetables were cooked, to avoid over cooking the chicken. Stores well in the freezer. Great meal on a cold day.

This soup is too good to be true. Yummy plus you don’t get that chicken smell in it. I did not have celery and the chicken Bourbulin cubes. So I added the celery salt at the end with pepper and black salt. Delicious.

Simple recipe. Came out great. Nice basic flavor. I cooked a four pound chicken for two hours, not one as suggested, and I added very fine egg noodles as a finishing touch. Everyone in the family loved it. Will definitely make again.

I really wanted to love this recipe, based on the scores of reviews I read. I don't want to trash it because so many others enjoyed it, but I thought made as directed, this soup was like dish water. I did not use the veggies because after boiling for so long, they were very unappetizing, so I substituted fresh veggies. No lie, I added lots of other seasonings, including four boullion cubes and two packets of Goya poultry boullion. I kept adjusting after each addition until I got the taste I wanted.  In addition, I added about 1/3 c. flour mixed with 3/4 cold water.  (Shake well until completely blended, then add to soup to thicken - my mother always added a flour mixture to her chicken noodle soup.)  After that, I reduced the soup for added flavor. Boiled egg noodles separately and added to the soup. When it was done, it was very good, but the finished version was a long ways from the original recipe. Good base, but I think this is just a starting point to anything remotely palatable.

I cooked it in the crock pot and it was delicious.  Instead of a whole chicken I used a package of boneless thighs and some breast tenders.

This takes a lot of time and tedious work but it's worth it in the end.  So delicious!! Just be careful when you're taking the meat off the bones - little bones always somehow end up in the soup.
This is my new favorite recipe for chicken soup.

No salt or pepper, had those at the table.  Used store bought matzo balls.  Shredded chicken into pot when reheating before serving and had enough left over for a couple of meals   
Easy and very good.

It was very easy, but if I make again I would add carrots and  celery later or take out sooner as they were pretty mushy.
Need to set the stock in fridge for awhile so you can scoop off the grease on top other wise too greasy.
I added Better Than Bullion Chicken flavor at the end as not enough flavor for me. .  
I would make it again.  Pretty tasty and very easy.

I used Jill's basic recipe then I used KATEFOODFUN's suggestion to use fresh veggies. I also added a little parsley and oregano. I used angel hair pasta for the noodles. I added a little to much pasta but, to me that's the best part.

This is a great basic recipe. I have found it's best NOT to put the onion back in. I also like to add more colorful veggies! Whatever is in season. Also, for seasoning, I use adobo y sazon. (Puerto Rican seasonings) Love it!!!

It's a good base. I added fresh garlic, some savory herbs and spices, kale and cayenne pepper. My family devoured it.

Such an easy way to make chicken soup, cutting veggies into bite sized pieces AFTER cooking time (genius). For the minimal amount of work required, it yields great results in flavor satisfaction and in family thumbs up.

I add a little white wine, garlic, and thyme, as well as salt and pepper to taste.  I used a previously roasted chicken, pulled off the meat and put the bones and skin in cheesecloth, because I have texture issues, but I wanted the flavor. I have also added milk (coconut or almond works) to give it more of a stew feeling in the past.  Perfect recipe for cold days, picky eaters, and special diets.
