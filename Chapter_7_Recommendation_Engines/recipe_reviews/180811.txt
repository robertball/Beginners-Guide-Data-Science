Great for large parties, as this does make a lot! I used Hellman's light mayo (about a cup) and reduced fat sour cream (about a cup and a half) as I wanted more of the "ranch" flavor. It was perfect for assorted veggies, crackers, and chips for dipping.

I make this a lot as a dip for french fries. I add a tsp. of horseradish for kick and sometimes a couple tsp. of bacon bits. It's great. Try it with your own homemade ranch dressing mix. It's even better.

I have made this extremely easy dip for the several years now.  ONLY 1 ADDITION-
1 TBS MORTONS NATURE'S SEASONING 
       *WHICH IS SO GOOD ON MANY THINGS, FROM EGGS, STEAKS, FRIES, SALADS, TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING*

Another twist, add one sm. box chopped and DRAINED spinach.  Yum-o...serve with baby carrots, cucumbers, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes.

This is great subtitute for SOUR CREAM & ONION CHIP DIP. I used Dukes lite mayo and reduced fat sour cream and it gave the perfect consistency. I didn't use a full 16 oz of each, just (equal amount of each) to the amount I needed, as dictated in the recipe. Then, added the ranch dressing powder to taste in about the same scale as the recipe. So, very quick and easy!

Pretty Good!  I made a smaller portion and used light mayonaise.  I dipped with Ritz crackers.  Yum!

Made this with 16oz of LIGHT sour cream, and only 1/4 cup light mayo + 1 pkt ranch dressing mix.  It was still really creamy and flavorful AND BEST OF ALL EASY!!!  Served with celery, carrots, cucumbers, and cauliflower for a small crowd.

I gave this a five even though I changed it. I omitted the mayo. Perfect dip for vegetables or chips!

It's amazing!  I used Great Value ranch.  I would recommend that and Hidden Valley to whoever's new here.  And just a pinch of salt and a tiny little smidge of white vinegar.

This is OK, but the flavor is too bland as written. I like using the mayo/sour cream combo--it tastes good with veggies or chips; however, next time I will use only 8 oz mayo and 8 oz sour cream to one packet of ranch mix.

I added Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning  (to taste) to give it a little spicy kick.  The dip was a huge hit!

A good, basic dip to begin with...I had to add onions and more dry ranch dip to get it to a good, flavorful level for chips.
