It wasn't around long enough to take a picture 'cause it was SO GOOD!  I was so tempted to use a splash of red wine to deglaze because I only had powdered bullion, but the flavours were FANtastic anyway!  It tastes like something you would order in a fancy restaurant.  My steak was absolutely perfect (rare) but I had to cut my husband's steak (must be well-done) into thick strips to finish it because the mushrooms were threatening to burn.  Then, with both steaks in the pan (mine to reheat, his to finish) I started the finishing steps for the amazing sauce by swirling around the pan so the juices would get around and under the steak and mushrooms.  The plating was gorgeous!  We had been 'Christmas snacking' all day, so all I needed was the garlic mashed potatoes (no pepper--just marg and cream)to add to the plate.  My husband LOVED it!  I used black currant jam and Real mushrooms, too.  Excellent!

Altered this recipe to our taste as follows:  Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, used currant jelly instead of strawberry and substituted a fruity white wine for vanilla ice cream.  Pan searing the filet made it extra juicy.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!! Okay everyone this is it, this recipe is delicious!! I made it for my hudband and two kids and it was a winner all around! The only thing I did was put less mushrooms into it, cause we are not huge fans!! If you are having a formal dinner this would work. It looks beautiful after you frizzle the sauce onto the steaks. And when they take a bite mmmm what a suprise.

At first when I read this recipe I was a bit leary of the jelly and ice cream.  When I made it for my hubby he LOVED it and he is very particular about his filet!  I've made it since for my Dad and my brother and they both loved it as well!

Five stars for  creativity and taste.  I used thin-cut petite sirloin steak and it turned out great.  The mushrooms really make the sauce and the jam and icecream add sweetness, but not too much.  Definitely worth a try.  I may  have let the sauce simmer too long, but it was just enough for my husband and I, and I made the full amount.  You may need more for 4 servings.

Saving the liquid from mushrooms is fine if you are using dried mushrooms but canned is salt water! Using dried mushrooms add a cup of hot water to 3 oz of dried mushrooms and let stand for a hour. Then remove the mushrooms strain the liquid through cheese cloth and continue with the recipe or deglaze the pan with red wine instead of the canned water.

I had to alter the recipe a bit due to dairy allergies, used vanilla soy milk in place of vanilla ice cream.  Loved the flavor of the mushrooms, but the sauce was a weird color, too sweet and lacked depth. It was not bad, but not even close to restaurant quality and I definitely would not serve to guests. I might take the mushroom part of recipe and use a port or dessert wine glaze instead of the jelly and ice cream, but will not make again as it is written.

Used some red wine and olive oil during the simmer instead of the butter.  Had some American Idol strawberry swirl ice cream in the freezer - this concoction was pretty darn good.

This recipe sounds scary, but give it a try! It's a little sweet but sooo good! We served it for dinner guests everyone loved and no one guessed there was ice cream in the sauce!

A web gem!  I used fresh mushrooms and deglazed with dry sherry. This is truly gormet beef.

AWESOME! I really wasn't sure about the ingredients, but it is so good! I made it for my boyfriend who is kind of a foodie and he loved it! I also made it for my family who is really picky and they loved it and requested the recipe! I highly recommend it!  ***I used filet migon and diced my mushrooms really fine!***

This was an excellent recipe.  We used a very tender filet which helped.  I actually added the mushrooms sliced to the pan with the filets (instead of chopped and in with the butter spread.)  Presentation was wonderful and it was easy to do well.

Didn't pan fry.  Grilled the steak.  Needed more mushrooms in the sauce.  Funky to add vanilla ice cream.

Excellent!!!! This cooked up very quickly and the sauce was so good. It was a nice change of pace and not overly sweet but the taste of the jam and ice cream come through. I will definetly make this again.

I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in the recipe.  I think the ice cream made the sauce overpoweringly sweet.  Up until that point, I thought the sauce was very good sooooo, from now on I'll either just eliminate the ice cream or possibly try heavy cream instead.

I loved this sauce.I wanted something different because with my children they are so picky and I get tired of the same thing.My oldest daughter loved it.Thank you for a very easy sauce that made my dinner very good and different.I will make this again.Also I didn't have the ice cream but used milk instead and the sauce was still excellent.I'm going to try other jellies and even put it on fish.

This was very good.  Next time I would use a little less icecream.  The sauce was a little to sweet but over all pretty different.

Terrific recipe! I made a few changes with what was on hand.Boysenberry jam that I had open. Replaced the ice cream with 2 Tbls. whipping cream that I had for another use, and substituted the lemon juice with  a splash of Cianti! Served it with Knorr's Butter & Herb Noodles, and a fresh salad of baby greens, pears, and gorgonzola cheese, spritzed with balsamic dressing. Definitely a keeper.
