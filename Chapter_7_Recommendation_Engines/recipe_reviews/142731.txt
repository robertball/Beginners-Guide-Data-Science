A good, healthy dressing. I felt it could use a little more flavor though and added one more tablespoon each of soy sauce and vinegar, plus a tablespoon of sesame oil and black pepper.
Be prepared to have a very large amount of dressing on your hands!

This needed a lot of doctoring up for us.  Even with the addition of Wasabi it had a 'flat' taste.   As written I would not make this again.  Sorry, it just wasn't for us.
