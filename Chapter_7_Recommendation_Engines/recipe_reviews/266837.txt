Such a simple yet flavorful recipe for quick on-the-go breakfasts during the week. Would make an equally fantastic option for a brunch. So versatile too - easily swap out the type of cheese, or use precooked bacon or sausage instead of ham. The possibilities are endless! You'll want to keep this in your regular rotation!  **** NOTE that the "Grands" crescent rolls aren't biscuits - they are the XL size of regular crescents and come in a 12oz tube instead of the smaller 8oz tube. ****

First of all, Pillsbury does make the crescent rolls in the Grands, bigger like their biscuits. I just made this yesterday, and hubby and I loved it! I have more ham and cheese, so I will make more soon.  I did use the Gruyere, but I think just about any cheese you have would work.

I made this as an appetizer for company.  They were easy and good.  Finger food.  I substituted Swiss for gruyere.  I'll make them again for sure..

So easy and delicious!  My husband devoured these.  I am making them again today but with turkey and swiss.  Fun and easy recipe  that you can change up.  I like them for breakfast but could also be a great appetizer or snack.  Thank you!

Made with regular croissants as I didn’t see Grands at my store. Made as directed — delicious and simple. Had 2 for  lunch; rest going in freezer. Considering finely chopping ham next time so there will be plenty of ham taste in each bite.

The only change I made was I used the new Hawaiian crescents which I wouldn’t do again. I also cut the the crescents in half and made 16 instead of 8.

Loved the flavor, and it’s a great way to use leftover ham.  Unfortunately I didn’t read the reviews before making, so I ended up with regular crescent rolls.   Will definitely look for the grands!

Very simple recipe and easy to make.  I added some spicy brown mustard just to give them zip.  Grab-n-go for a lunch too!
