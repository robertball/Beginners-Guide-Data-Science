This will be my one and only recipe for fajitas now! I did have to add olive oil to get a smoother consistency. I can't wait to try this on chicken or even pork.

This marinade for steaks was awesome. My boyfriend very picky when it comes to food but he wants me to marinade them like this from now on. He also wants me to try this marinade with chicken next.

WOW! This was so flavorful. I loved it. I ended using a half cup of lime juice since I had 2lbs of steak and it came out perfect. I'm going to use this recipe at home the next time we make "Carne Asada."

This was a delightful marinade - I removed the seeds from two of the jalapeno peppers and that make it the right amount of heat with lots of delicious flavor!  It likely would have been ok to leave the seeds in the other two peppers, but that might have been too much heat for some people.  Also, feel free to use the drippings (not the extra marinade!) on the plate after you cook the steak as a yummy gravy on mashed potatoes!

Very good! I had at least 3# of sirloin, so I double the lime, but left all of the other ingredients the same - there was plenty of flavor. I marinated mine for almost 24 hours (did the marinade last night after dinner and threw it in the fridge, easy). I did add a little oil to the marinade about 10 minutes before I grilled it. Turned out lovely - and about as tender as sirloin gets without beating it. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this today and my bf loved it. He didn't even use any steak or BBQ sauch,which he normally does with his steak. 

I ended up rubbing the salt, pepper, oregano and a little bit of olive oil onto each side of the steaks. Then I placed it in a bag of cut-up jalapenos and garlic, squeezed two limes into the bag, and let them marinate for 24 hours. 

The steaks were grilled along with the jalapenos. Came out perfect!

Best steak we've had in a long time. A little spicy, but what do you expect with 4 jalapenos. I'm going to try this marinade on other meats too.

If you love jalapeno's, this is for you!  I add 2 more cloves of garlic to my mixture since garlic is a hit in our family.  We noticed that the home grown jalapeno's are hotter than store bought.  So you might want to keep that in mind.  To me a marinade is runny and this is more of a paste.  Next time I might add some vegetable oil as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  My husband just asked if we could make it again...I noticed that he has set steaks out!!!  A real keeper for this family!

My mom & dad loved this recipe. I'm not particularly a fan of spicy food, but since they are, I decided to make this for them. The steak came out very tender and they mentioned that the jalapenos gave a nice edge to the flavor of the meat. But since my mom is a bit sensitive to black pepper, I think I might cut back on the amount used for this recipe. But all in all, they loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked it and didn't think it was too hot but a few people at the table disagreed with me.  If you are cooking for people w/ little spice tolerance I'd stay away from chicken... this pasty marinade stuck in the grooves and made the chicken much spicier than the steak.  Currently my default for fajitas.

First of all, I don't know why I marinated good steaks. But the tablespoon of salt should have caught my eye. That is a lot of salt. Too much. Quite disappointed.

One word = YUM! I seeded the jalapenos so we just got the flavor and a little heat. Perfect! I let marinade overnight and grilled it for dinner the next day. We used leftovers for steak tacos. Fantastic! Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper!

I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars because it was too salty. Next time I'll half the salt. Be sure you use the full amount of jalapeno or it will be extremely, extremely mild.

so good! I love the taste of jalapenos but not so much the heat. The lime took most of the heat away, but left all the flavour! Yummy :)

This is the single best steak marinade I have ever made.  I used this with New York Strip and marinated for 1 day with no adjustments to the recipe and it came out AMAZING.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes spicy.

WOW, this is a fantastic recipe! I doubled the recipe becasue I had about double the steak (flat iron steak).  I didn't think It was at all bland as some have stated, I also thought that the heat was not as hot as I thought it would be.  My son's best friend (born in Mexico) came over when we pulled these off of the grill and stated he had just eaten so he only wanted one bite; One full steak later he asked if he could take the recipe home for his Mom.  BRAVO

Tried it and loved it!  The steak required a marinade of at least 8 hrs. but the wait was well worth it, and was an course alongside Sushi rice and Sesame asparagus.

GREAT marinade.  I marinated the steak for about 15 hours, and turned out great.

I made this for my fíance and he loved it! I changed a few things, I used lemon juice instead of lime , I also used jalapenos from a jar because that is what we had at home. I did have a problem with blending the ingredients because I made it for one person, so I just chopped up the jalapenos up really good. I will be making this for him again!

I let our steaks marinade for about 7 hours, then pan cooked them. The marinade was delicious!!! We have some left for tomorrow night, should taste even better by then!

I really don't know what I was expecting when I read this recipe, however what I ended up with was an amazing dish! The taste of the peppers really holds well in the steak and gives it a nice spicy feeling in your mouth. You can even go one step further and make the Devil's Steak Sauce recipe on this site to serve with it.

Such a hit!  I need to learn more about peppers, though, as I made it too mild once and too hot another time using approximately the same amount of peppers.  Very simple addition to a steak and so delicious.

This marinade smelled delicious. I was a little disappointed with the flavor because for me, the oregano was too dominant of a flavor. Next time I will cut it back, or most likely omit it and sub. cilantro or cumin. It was good enough to make again and I think with that one change, I will love it!

An excellent marinade, though slight caution should be given to those without a passion for peppers. I paired this recipe with one for Bacon & Blue Brussel Sprouts. It was an excellent flavor combination, and the Gorgonzola cheese provided an excellent cooling agent if the spice from the steak became too fierce. All told, thoroughly enjoyable but plan to have something nearby to take the sting away in the event of sensitive pallets.

Perfect combination of flavors! I didn't have lime juice, so I used lemon juice instead. I cut the steak into strips and created a fajita which was delicious! Husband's rating: favorite meal.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. If we make it again, we will cut down on the jalapenos. Using 4 made it a bit too hot. Otherwise, a great recipe!

My husband made this when my parents came to visit. It was wonderful! Deliciously unique flavor, very tender steak, just yummy all around. It didn't really need a sauce, but he also made a chimichurri sauce from this site and it was a bonus! Thanks for a great recipe - we'll definitely make this one again.

Yum!  I made this for dinner tonight.  Very good!  Don't be worried that it may be spicy - it's not.  Lots of flavor!  I did change a couple of things:  1.) I am on a low sodium diet, so I omitted the salt and added 1T of low sodium soy sauce.  And 2.) My hubby doesn't tolerate garlic very well, so I only used 1t of jarred minced garlic.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good but not as spicy hot as I had anticipated. I'll try adding more jalapeños and maybe letting the steaks marinate longer next time.

Great idea for a marinade. I didn't have a blender on hand, so I seeded the jalapeños and chopped everything to a fine paste instead. I will likely make this again the next time I buy some jalapeños.

We don't like spicy stuff so I left out the jalapenos and lime juice.  Skeptical I still left the steak in a bag all day with minced garlic, salt, pepper and oregano.  The flavor really seeped through and wallah - new recipe for me!

This was a great marinade recipe and I used it with buffalo steaks. Like another reviewer, I didn't use a blender and just finely chopped the ingredients and it worked well, just a little more work. This definitely is one of my favorites now for steaks.

This was really delicious!  Instead of blending the marinade i just chopped the jalepenos and garlic put them in a ziploc bag with the other ingredients and marinated the steak over night.  After grilling i sliced the steak for fajitas and they were soooo good!!  I can't wait to make this again, maybe with chicken next time for more fajitas!  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe and sent to a friend who made it last night, it was delicious! She also made a side of sauted onions which complimented it nicely. I think this would go great in a salad as well. Thanks so much for sharing!

I was hoping for more of a kick.  Good overall, maybe I'll toss in a chili pepper next time.  Never too spicy in our house!

Made the best New Years treat! Making it again for dinner this week. Oh, yes it needs to marinade for at least 8 hours.

I loved this marinade! I added a few slices of onion to the mix, used a 1 1/2 lb london broil, and let it sit overnight. I cooked it in a cast-iron grill pan on the stove. I used the meat in a soft taco shell with sour cream and cheese - yum! I had another 1/2 left over that I let marinate for another 24 hours - the flavor was much stronger and better! I sliced this piece up over a salad.

Fantastic. I removed the seeds and ribs from the jalapeno peppers. Allow the steak to marinate for 2 days. Very good. Had the jalapeno flavor without the heat. Even my 4 year old loved it. This is a keeper!

Outstanding!! I used two jalapeno peppers, and bottled lime juice. I let it marinate for 12 hours. This was so juicy and full of flavor, I will diffently be making these again. Thanks for a wounderful recipe.

This was a great recipe! I made it tonight for my parents and they loved the flavour, I did add an extra jalapeno pepper which made it a bit on the spicy side, I would probably just use the recommended amount of peppers next time, as I marinated for 24 hours allowing plenty of time for the flavour to soak in.

I usually double this recipe to feed my family of 4 and ommit the jalapenos all together. Along with all the other ingrediants doubled, I add a can of Ortega chilis and 3 fresh cerano peppers.  Can't get any better than this!  So full of flavor and makes it a bit more spicy!

It was not good at all! I followed it to a T and it came out tasting too much like green pepper, not even jalapeno tasting, it didn't do well for our dinner. They ate it but told me to skip next time.

I cheated by only using two jalapeno peppers and the steak turned out not spicy at all. Definitely has to have at least four peppers to get the kick!
I would prefer to cut the amount of salt in half but my salt-loving husband thought it was perfect. Great flavor.

Marinated for about 8 hours, but the part of "draining" the marinade off is impossible, because it ends up a semi-paste, which must be scraped off before you cook. We used thick ribeyes instead of sirloin, because that is the only steak we like. Gave them excellent flavor, didn't even use steak sauce.

one of my favorite marinade recipes now... only differences I did was, I didn't blend it in the blender I just finely chopped my jalapenos and combined all ingredients together, I added a little vegetable oil and marinaded the steak for 8 hours in a shallow baking dish then baked at 350 until desired doneness, turned out absolutely delicious! thank you!

This was excellent!  Lots of flavor and I didn't even use a grill. I cooked in my cast iron skillet on very high eat, didn't even add oil. I marinated for almost 24 hours.  As good as any steak in a restaurant.

I didn't get any heat at all from the Jalapenos.  Maybe because I deseeded them?  It was still great, but not spicy at all.

This is pretty good.  It's a little heavy on the lime and I'll probably use tequila for half of it next time.  I used it on elk steak and they are very tender and flavorful.

Awesome recipe! I tried this out and the steak came out delicious. I suggest buying a quality meat. The second time I made this I cut the meat into cubes and that was also very good. I put the meat and marinade in a plastic overnight then flip it over in the morning and cook it when I get home.

I am a carnivore.  I love me some steak, almost any steak.  This recipe not only kills the meat flavor but does not have its own inspiring substitute.  I used fat Prime Ribeye for this and I have to say, simple salt, pepper and maybe some garlic and onion powder would have blown this away.  Best Ever Ribeye recipe.... Willinghams Original Wham Seasoning, marinated overnight or even 20 minutes blows the doors off of this recipe.  2 stars because hey, it was a fat Prime Ribeye

I made this to use up all the jalapenos that came from my back porch garden.  I did add some extra lime juice to make it cover the steaks.  My friend, who loves spicy food, loved it.

I have limited access to a grill so I roast most meat and I must say that this marinade works great on both pork tenderloin and boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Did not like as a steak alone. Used as fajita/burrito in a tortilla wrap with some veggies, salsa, guac & sour cream. Everybody loved it plated this way.

Delicious!!! I did add a bit of olive oil to make the marinade go farther. I was afraid it might be too spicy because I left alot of the marinade on the steaks while grilling. It was perfect!!!

Not my favorite marinade...needed some sweetness to offset the sour and hot IMHO.  Next time I would use a flank steak and add some honey or real maple syrup, even orange juice concentrate.  Watch the marinating time as I find the citrus acid can cause the steak to break down and be mushy.

I made the recipe for two, but used large steaks so used the serving size of 4. I marinated for about 28 hours and I wasn't very impressed. I thought it tasted sour.

Excellent!  I seeded three of the four jalapeños, and grilled for about six minutes, but my steaks were thin...only about 3/4 inch thick.  Chopped the meat into bite size pieces and used in a fajita salad with lettuce, tomato and avocado.  Sooo yummy!

I did add olive oil but I actually only marinated this for 3 hours and it was delicious. I tenderized the meat first and we like it pretty rare so the flavor was real fresh! Thanks for this! Also, you should mention that it is gluten free! Almost all steak marinades have soy sauce and this was simply a delightful find!

This wasn't bad but we found the lime overpowered the other flavors.  I could see using this in fajitas or similar dish but would not recommend it if you're just looking for a spicy marinade for grilled steak.
