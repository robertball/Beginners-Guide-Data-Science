Pretty good but a little too sweet. I used 1/2 the sugar the recipe called for and I added in a little more vinegar.

Very nice salad!  I thinly sliced the cucumber and added the salt.  I let that set for about twenty minutes to let the cucumbers produce their own water. I added thin sliced red onion, cut the amount of sugar in half, used white wine vinegar, left the amount of dill the same and omitted the water. I chilled it for the time stated and it went great with grilled chicken.  If you like this, you'll like "Dilly Cucumber Salad" from this site.

Love this recipe with rice dishes.  Perfect blend of sweet and tartness.  This needs to sit at least 6-8 hours to fully appreciate the flavors.

This salad was a great side dish with grilled salmon. I used rice vinegar and omitted the sugar entirely. Red onion also added some nice color.

This is a great way to use those garden cukes.  I like adding 1/2 cup red bell pepper to the mixture but it's great as is.  I love the taste of fresh dill but the dried dill really works best with this recipe as it's not so overwhelming.  Very refreshing.  IF you're going to reduce the sugar....reduce the vinegar, too.  The cukes make plenty of their own liquid.

A little too sweet for my taste... next time I'll cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added halved cherry tomatoes, they tasted wonderful with the onion and cucumber the next day!

Been making this recipe for years.  I use Splenda in place of the sugar which makes it so low in calories (and no fat) that it's almost sinful for something to taste this good!  UPDATE 6/3/12:  Recently started adding tomatoes to this recipe, and it makes this dish look even more appetizing (and even more delicious).

Made this for a party we had last night and it was a hit.  The cucumbers are light and refreshing.  After reading other reviews I left out the water and didn't miss it.  Thanks for sharing!!  Will definitely be making it again!

Very nice.  Used 1 large English cucumber. 1/2 cup sugar, no salt and everything else the same.
Added a handful of grape tomatoes cut in half for some color.  Made four days ago and finishing up just now.  Keeps getting better and better....

After making this recently for a family party, my brother said if he could only have one thing to eat for the rest of his life, Cucumber Slices with Dill, would be it!  Can you imagine that he loved it that much?  I added a bit more dill than the recipe called for, but that is the only difference.

Simple use of garden surplus. I used stivia in place of the sugar and it worked well.

I reduced the amount of sugar by over 1/2 and marinated the mix overnight. Then I drained it and added about 2 cups sour cream and served it. My guests really liked it.

This was very easy and tasty.  I needed a use for my cucumbers and this was great.  I only had a red onion but it really tasted fine.  I'll have to try it with a regular onion and see if there's a difference.

I used 1/2C sugar and English cucumbers (less seeds).  This recipe is great.  Everyone (even the kids) liked these cucumbers.  I make them the night before so they have plenty of time for the flavor to develop.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Really tasty; has the perfect balance of sweet and tart, with the subtle taste of dill.  My older daughter ate two servings of it.

great salad, and no mayonnaise! I half the sugar and make it every year when my cucumbers start ripening.

This a great cucumber salad and I really enjoyed it because it was not mayo based. The one thing I changed was the sugar content....I only used 3 packets of Stevia sugar sunstitute instead of the amazing amount of sugar called for and it was perfect. I used English cukes and red onion, fresh dill and made early in the day for the flavors to blend. Nice and refreshing w/o overdosing on sugar. Thanks!

Delicious! I left out the water because the cucumbers definitely release plenty, and I used less sugar, but the flavors were perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly and it's fabulous!  It's the perfect refreshing side to heavy main dishes.  Though it's exactly like my German mother-in-law makes, I think that if you like the sweet cucumbers you get on the side of many Thai dishes, you'll also love this recipe.

An explosion of flavors for your mouth!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, but I think it could have been reduced even more.  Marinated for 24 hours.  My guests raved over it!

I cut the recipe down to use just one cucumber, cut the sugar in half, used red onion and doubled the amount of it.  I let it marinate all night.  Very yummy!  I would only let it marinate for a couple hours, as the longer it sites, the softer the cucumbers get (which is fine if you like it that way).

I have made this salad 3 times now.  Each time I made a little change and it was still great.  It is good as it is written.  I also tried it with 1/4 c rice vinegar and 1/4 cup white vinegar.  My husband liked it this way better because it had a milder vinegar taste.  I also made it with Splenda as someone suggested and it was good that way too.  Something else that makes it even better is to add fresh dill rather than dried.

I really liked this as an alternative to Cucumbers in Sourcream (which I love). The sweetness is a nice change of pace. I cut recipe in half and used Splenda. Worked out well and half recipe made enough, unless you have a really big crown of cucumber lovers.

The mixture of sugar and vinegar was perfect.  I made this for a dinner party and EVERYONE raved about it. Even the kids liked it.  I made a double batch, but otherwise I didn't make any adjustments.  I used a food processor to slice the cucumbers and onions for convenience, but it made the slices very thin.  I made it in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day (about 8-10 hours) and it was great.  I will definitely make this one again.

I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar.  The result was a wonderfully refreshing salad!

I agree the sugar proportion we use (60+years) is equal to the vinegar... then adjust with water, if any. Great side salad. Making this today for our Octoberfest.

Perfect - light and fresh no worries about mayo going bad if left out.  I used half of everything except the cucumbers so they would stay crispy and it was awesome.

Really yummy and very easy. As others suggested I cut the sugar in half (1/2 cup).  I let sit overnight.  The next day I put the slices over lettuce and added goat cheese crumbles (and used the juice as a salad dressing) and had quite the yummy salad!

1/2 the sweetner and add a little salt.  The cucumber volume will half after 2 hrs.   We loved it!  It went super well with the Lentil & Rice with Fried Onions on the site.

I incorporated suggestions by others: brown rice vinegar, skipped water (ABSOLUTELY - the cukes weep more than enough fluid !!!), reduced to 2/3 C sugar and later 1/2). Radically increased dill to 3 T dry on second pass and will use finely-chopped fresh the next time. Used a mandoline to add render a red Bell pepper into 1.5mm slivers of color and doubled the onion, using Vidalias. 

OK, it is entirely appropriate for my nick to be "Carnivore" . . . yet I made a meal out of this salad two nights running.

My mother loves these, and the restaurant where she always ordered them closed down.  So I made it my mission to find a recipe so I could duplicate them for her.  This one came the closest.  I made them for her, and she was so excited, so I make them a couple of times every summer for a summer cookout at my family's home.  
I also made them for a summer fish fry we had at work, and my co-workers just about inhaled them.  Imagine my surprise when I realized the container was empty -- I hadn't had any myself!  A lot of my co-workers asked for the recipe.

My boyfriend is German and I wanted to make him this for his birthday party.  He loved it so much he ate it for breakfast the next day.  It's light and tangy but very flavorful with the dill. Would be great on a hot summer day.

Pretty good.  I would like a more full bodied vinegar flavor, so if I were making this for myself only I'd nix the water and most of the sugar.  But I wasn't, so I left the ratios the same although I cut the recipe amounts down--I only had one sad cucumber left for this.  Bf liked this, so I'm glad I left everything as is--he doesn't like vinegar so much so if I'd cut the other ingredients to let it shine he'd have turned up his nose.  This is so easy, and was a nice complement to our quick dinner of egg salad sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good!  I used only one cucumber (a VERY large cucumber!), omitted the sugar completely, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Next time, I think I will chop the cukes, but continue to omit the sugar.  I prefer the tang of the vinegar.

This was very good!  I was a little hesitant because I don't really like vinegar, but the mix of vinegar, sugar, and water is perfect.  I read many reviews that said it was too sweet, but I thought that it was just right.  I only had two cucumbers, but I added tomatoes to make up for the difference, and I'll add them from now on.  They were delicious in this recipe.  I thought that the dried dill was fine, too.  Today was the second day that I've eaten it, and it's even better than yesterday...letting it marinate makes it taste even better!    Update - I have made this twice now, and the second time, I used "Equal" sweetner instead of sugar.  It still tasted delicious and really lowered the calorie count!

This turned out very good, but I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. 1 cup seemed like way to much and I was right. It had just the right amount of sweetness for us with just 1/2 cup. Thanks! :)

Great summertime recipe!  I heat up the sugar, water and vinegar to make sure it gets dissolved well.  Then I salt the cucumbers and pour the hot vinegar mixture over the dill, cucumbers and onions.  Does well if you let it set overnight.  Tastes like something you'd order in a restaurant.

I tweaked the recipe a bit, but I did really enjoy this. After reading a few other reviews I reduced the amount of sugar by half and later realized I should have reduced the amount of liquid too. I also used fresh dill and added halved grape tomatoes, which are really tasty in there!

loved it.  I whipped up a batch and took it to work for my lunch over several days.  I liked the sweetness as a change from the more vinagery recipe.  I also used a purple onion instead of a white or yellow one.  I will make again.

Easy to make and simply delicious.  The longer you let the cucumbers marinate the better the taste.

Awesome! I have been looking for the right mixture for this salad for a while.  I doubled the salt and cut the sugar in half (and it was still very sweet).

I made this for a summer barbecue party. I prepared it the night before using a little more than half the sugar as suggested by another reviewer. It was a huge hit! Everyone was very impressed. I will be halving the recipe and making it for my family. Easy and delicious!

no one really touched this at the party.  my in-laws and neighbors said that they really liked it.  i, however, was not very excited about it.  they really tasted like sweet pickles.  i like my pickles to taste like pickles and my cukes to taste like cukes.  overall, not bad

Awesome! Used half the sugar called for and added a bit more vinegar. Also used 2 tbsp of dried dill and a vidalia onion. Marinated overnight. Had to drain all the excess water before serving but the flavor was wonderful!

Very good and gets even better when marinated 3-5 hours. The dill really added to the recipe- I added 2 tbsp instead of 1.

Love this recipe . . . and I've never really been a fan of cucumbers! But, I'm a convert now and this recipe is perfect as a side dish. The only thing I do differently is replace the sugar with Stevia to bring down the calories.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years but I have to say that I absolutely LOVE it with the dill weed. Besides the dill weed addition, yours is so much better than mine. I'm not too proud to admit it. lol Thank you for my new recipe!

I prepared the recipe for a potluck and everyone loved it! I had reviewed the comments of others and made the following modifications: sprinkled salt on the sliced cucumbers and let sit for 20 mins, didn’t add water as plenty of liquid seeped from the cucumbers, used fresh dill, and cut sugar quantity’s in half.

This was WAY too sweet . I listened to other reviewers and cut the sugar in half. Even then it was too sweet and I had to add more vinegar and water. I like the simplicity of the recipe. With adjustments I think it is a keeper.

Loved it! I used cider vinegar and Stevia instead of water and sugar since I need to watch my sugar intake.

This was a last minute thought/dish so I served it approx 2 hrs after making and it was still a hit. Better the next day after marinated overnight. Followed the recipe except used celery seed instead of dill (because that's what I had). Keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This was pretty good but I cut the sugar back by half and still felt it was a bit too much. I will make it again but cut the sugar back even more. Other than that I really liked it.

Great recipe. Loved the taste I made minor changes using less sugar and I added a little caraway seed to give it a more earthy taste and balance. Glad i tried it.

I made it with stevia instead of sugar for a family get together and it was almost gone!  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Plus using stevia it cuts out most of the calories.

It was really good...Some changes like no dill weed (thought I had some, ended up as not),  halved the sugar (will probably lessen it even more next time), added a little more vinegar. It was very refreshing and will be even better in the summer for a picnic or a cookout.

I used half the sugar, and replaced apple cider vinegar for half the white. Took to a potluck and it was a huge success.

This has been one of my favorite salads since I was a kid. It is so refreshing.
I like mine tangy, not sweet, so I cut the sugar to only 1/4 cup. This dish is perfect for BBQs and hot summer days.

OMG,  This was good, but the next time I make it, I will use less sugar. Too sweet is the reason for the 4 stars. Everyone who I let taste it, liked it. Some even asked for the recipe.

Added more fresh dill. Cutback on the sugar as others suggest....ended up adding more as it was too tart for my taste!

I always make a double batch of the mixture for 4 thinly sliced cucumbers with a small amount of skin left on for strength and a super thinly sliced large onion YUMMY....i just brought it to a family cookout and people were raving about it I felt guilty cause it was so easy to make. Thanks for a great summer dish.

This might be weird but I had 1/2 of a pretty big zucchini left over so I skinned, sliced and marinated in this mix.  I cut the servings down to 2 and used one pack of Splenda for the sugar.  Wowzer, what a treat  I really liked the zucchini so I know I'd like the cucumber.  Easy, peasy recipe.  Thanks JulieK for this little gem of a recipe.

This was very good and super quick to fix. Only wish I had more fresh dill from the garden to put in. Will make again.
