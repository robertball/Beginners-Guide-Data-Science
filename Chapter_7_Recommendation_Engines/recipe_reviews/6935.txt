I was looking for a pretty tea bread for the Christmas holidays.  I made this as written with one exception-I left the raisins out, seemed like overkill to me.  This is a colorful, moist loaf, perfect for gift-giving.  My only question is: why call it Cherry SPICE Loaf?  Not a lick of spice in this recipe!
