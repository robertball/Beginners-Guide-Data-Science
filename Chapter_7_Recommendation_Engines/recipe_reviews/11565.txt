This recipe was very good and easy to make. It was smoother than no-bake oatmeal cookies. Next time I think I will try adding honey to it and maybe a few more chocolate chips. Try this one.

I had a hard time combining the oatmeal and chocolate chips into the batter and have everything stick together. If I were to make this again I'd cut the oatmeal by at least a quarter if not by half. The dough would be much easier to handle this way.

I used the whole egg rather than the whites omitted the salt and doubled the amount of chips! Because I used whole wheat flour it didn't surprise me that I didn't need the full amount of oatmeal called for. These are great little cookies!

I used an old coffee grinder to cut up my oats into "quick cooking" ones--worked great. I replaced 1/2 c. of flour with malted milk powder just to see what I'd end up with. I like the way they taste with my malt experiment but I can see how these would be really good if one were to follow the recipe!
