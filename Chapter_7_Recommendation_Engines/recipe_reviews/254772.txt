Batter was too thin and cobbler cake was too wet. I would use more bisquick next time.

I also had to add a bunch more Bisquick.  I made it exactly according to the directions and baked it, but it was still liquid inside, so I stirred in about 1 cup more Bisquick into the concoction. I baked it about 20 minutes more. Next time I'll try adding an extra cup of Bisquick right at the start and see how that works.

I did add a bit more bisquick probably a cup.  My batter seemed runny with the suggested amount.  Turned out super delish!
