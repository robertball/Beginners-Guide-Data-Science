The recipe submitter mentioned to use whatever veggies you like. With that being said, neither my hubs or I like pumpkin so I replace it with asparagus I had on hand. This recipe is excellent. The only problem was the cook time was too long. I pulled mine out 15 minutes early and they still got a bit too much char on them. Reduce the cook time and you have a 5 star all the way!

The veggies turned out great but I would only put them in for 45 minutes at 450.

Delish! I used broccoli, cauliflower, onions, red bell peppers and carrots because thatâ€™s what i had and it turned out amazing! The carrots were a little crispier but you can always leave them in there longer. These with pasta and marinara sauce are the perfect combination.
