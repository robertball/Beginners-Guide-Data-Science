This was a huge hit at my family BBQ. It was so easy. There is one recommendation I'd make, not about ingredients or taste, but about the process. The cinnamon sugar got very goopy quickly because of the wetness of the coconut milk. Next time, instead of dipping the pineapple into the sugar, I'll just give it a generous sprinkling on both sides.

As with the other reviews, this is a great recipe!  To add to this, the best idea is to lightly toast coconut flakes in the oven, then sprinkle them on the pineapple towards the end of grilling.  Perfect addition!

these were amazing - be sure to pat the pineapple dry before coating; grill soon afterwards.

WOW!  So simple and so good!  Made this for Memorial Day.  No one was very enthusiastic until they tasted it - and then they RAVED!  Great dessert idea for cookouts.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

These were pretty good, but I think I may have cut the slices too thick. If they were thinner, I think they would have been better. We had them on the grill for about 10 minutes each side and they still didn't cook through, so next time we will slice them thinner. Otherwise, the cinnamon taste was quite good. We also sprinkled coconut flakes over them, and this added a lot of taste - I would suggest adding the coconut!

Delicious...had these with a honey sesame chicken and they were great.  I did reduce the coconut milk (just a little bit).  Thanks for the post. (Can't wait to serve to brother's girlfriend...who loves pineapples.)

Wow!  I do not like pineapple and loved this.  My cousin just showed me how to make it and I can't wait to do it again.  We ate it will vanilla ice cream as desert and it was a huge hit.

I thought this was good, but what a mess on the grill. The pineapple I used was fresh, and with the cinnamon sugar it didn't taste much like pineapple but was more of an apple taste. Next time I make it, I think im going to do a variety of fruit- apples, pineapple, maybe some strawberries and make a kabob to grill.

These were quick, easy and delicious.  I used canned pineapples, laid them on a paper towel to dry while I finished preparing dinner.  I poured the 1/4 c. Coconut Milk into a bowl, dipped each pineapple into the milk and sat in a bowl until the boyfriend was ready to grill them.  Per the request of another reviewer we sprinkled cinnamon sugar once the pineapples were grilling instead of before to try to prevent a gooey mess.

Everyone enjoyed these pineapples and kept asking for more.  Even joked about them tasting like pina coladas.

While we served these with dinner as a try-out, I would most likely serve these as dessert next time.

This was absolutely delicious.  I soaked the pineapple slices (cut fairly thick-I got 7 slices from one pineapple) in coconut milk before placing on the grill.  Then I sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar.  I served this with vanilla bean ice cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg on top.  The smokey taste from the grill tasted so good with the tangy pineapple and sweet cinnamon.  I'll definitely make this again.  My husband declared it the best pineapple he's ever eaten!

Loved this! And we aren't pineapple people.  I precoated my pineapple ahead of time, and let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to throw it on the grill (maybe 30 minutes?).  I actually cut it into chunks, dipped them in a blend of white sugar, brown sugar & cinnamon, and put on skewers. (Don't forget to soak the wooden skewers in water so they don't burn)  Thanks for a great recipe! A real keeper, and impresses company!

Excellent recipe. Would have been 5-star, except for the instructions. I didn't dredge the pineapple slices -- I applied the cinnamon-sugar mixture with a shaker instead. I also used regular milk, and sprinkled the almost finished slices with dessicated coconut. mmmmm The next time, I'm going to make pineapple-banana-mango kabobs using the same method. Thanks for sharing.

These were awesome!  I did change a couple things....for convenience, I used 2 cans of sliced pineapple, drained them, and soaked them in a whole can of coconut milk the day before.  I mixed about 3 tbsp honey into the coconut milk and omitted all of the sugar (healthier and diabetes friendly), and just gave 4 or 5 good shakes of cinnamon.  So easy, so good!

this was delicious.  We followed others and sprinkled the pineapple with the cinnamon and (we used splenda) mixture.  the coconut flavor really comes through and it was delicious.  Next time we will cook them longer and use more sprinkling but all in the family loved this one!

This is a good recipe for grilled pineapple and I would make it again.  Rather than use canned coconut milk I had an open bottle of non-alcoholic piña colada mix and used that.  When make this again I will cut back a little on the cinnamon & sugar mixture.  We enjoyed the leftovers cold the next day.  Thanks PraiseGod for sharing your recipe.

Didn't care for this. Made it exactly and grilled it over the campfire on a grill.  The coconut milk was a bit overpowering.

The recipe is OK.  I am a big fan of pineapple so I wanted to give the recipe a try.  Adding the coconut milk and C&S mix didn't do much for me.  The best thing to add to pineapple is a red powder called Li Hing.  If you go to Hawaii you can find it at most stores (even Wal-Mart) - very few stores carry it on the mainland.  If you still want to give this a try I would have the coconut milk drain off the pineapple as much as possible before coating it with the cinnamon and sugar.  When you grill it the coating comes right off and your grill gets pretty messy.

I had my doubts when I made a gloopy mess dipping these into the cinnamon sugar mixture, then again when all I could smell was burnt sugar, but all that concern was for nothing!  These came out GREAT, although next time I will sprinkle with sugar as others recommended.  I used light coconut milk, as that's what I had on hand, and it was perfect.  If your grill rack gets messed up like mine did, just scrape it while it's still hot - cleaned up in a snap.

This is a great recipe.  I changed it up a bit and skewered (thawed) frozen pineapple chunks and thick slices of banana, rolled in the coconut milk, then in the sugar mix, and finally topped with flake coconut.

These are delicious. I did make a few simple changes that made the process so much easier. Instead of coconut milk I melted a small amount of virgin coconut oil, lightly coated my quartered, cored pieces and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. 
When they were done grilling, I cut the quarters into bite size chunks and they were great!

Wow, these were sooo yummy!  I used coconut cream instead of milk & spread it on the slices like butter.  Then once I put the cream slathered slices on the grill I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top. (liberally since our pineapple was SOUR!) Then when I flipped them I added more sugar to the other side.  It was the perfect way to eat the sour pineapple.  We all loved it.  I will recommend making sure the grill is clean first!  We grilled our immediately after grilling hamburgers and they had a slight hamburger taste.  My husband couldn't taste it though.  Also, I turned the last 3 uneaten slices into a smoothie by adding the leftover coconut cream, a banana, ice, fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 and a little sugar and blending in the blender until smooth.  YUM!

This was ok, cooked it after making a pineapple glaze for chicken. I may try it again, but it was average.

This was FANTASTIC!  I also cut the pineapple into chunks and put them on skewers.  I blotted them and brushed on regular milk with a pastry brush(I don't like coconut).  I had no problems with mess, the cinnamon sugar stuck very well.  My husband continued to sprinkle on more cinnamon sugar as he grilled them.  Needless to say, they were gone in no time.  Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to go buy another pineapple!

I could not taste the coconut very much, but everyone liked them. I wonder if they could be made without the coconut milk or perhaps sprinkle a little coconut on them too.

These were FABULOUS! And I didn't even use fresh pineapple. I just popped open a can of sliced pineapple rings & folowed the recipe. Everyone loved these! I prepared a pork chop dish w/ a fruity summertime salsa & this as a side but the pork chops were much better topped w/ these. I can't wait to try them w/ fresh pineapple.

I soaked the pineapple in the coconut milk while I had other things cooking (about 1 hour). Then put them on the grill and sprinkled the cin. sugar on. They turned out pretty good. They did not go over well with alot of the people that were here but I liked them and so did my teenager (who managed to eat most of the two batches by himself) Sorry, but since the majority of the party did not like them I can only give them3 stars.

Made these at a b-b-q and they were delicious.  I did not dip the pineapple slices in the cinnamon sugar; I just sprinkled it on the slices as I was grilling them.  The whole crowd loved them.  I will definitely make them again.

I thought these were pretty good, but not enough coconut flavor.  I used canned slices and sprinkled them with a sugar cinnamon mixture.  Maybe the addition of shredded coconut would help.

Most of the stuff dripped off of my pineapple even though I dried it per instructions on someone else's posting. I think I would like it just as well just put on the grill without the mess. If I ever made it again I would dip and coat at the grill VERY messy inside!

I thought these were very good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers, and just used regular milk instead of the coconut milk. I thought the pineapple tasted a little liked baked apples...very tasty on the grill.

We folowed the recipe and then dipped the rings in shredded coconut before putting them on the grill....fabulous! A nice change from the usual side dishes. Would like to try it with regular milk next time instead of coconut milk.

This is delicious- We made it 3 times this memorial weekend. The measurements are not very accurate though. I used a TON more cinnamon and sugar and had coconut milk left over- Really you just have to guess on those measurements. It would have been nice to include how to make cinnamon sugar- I used 3 parts sugar to 1 part cinnamon -it worked great. I dipped them in the milk then the cinnamon sugar and put them straight onto the grill. The cinnamon sugar did get gooey towards the end.

I made this yesterday. I was given some ribeyes and decided to grill them. Since I got an email from apprecipes, the day before, I thought about making it. Our local Kroger had fresh pineapple on sale for $.99. 

I made this with wedges and the cinnamon sugar. Had no coconut milk. Still was delicious.

Perfect accompaniment to grilled pork loin. I used pineapple spears (think the container you can buy at Costco)and cut the woody centres off each. Using the container they came in I emptied in 1 can of Light Coconut milk, closed it and marinated for the afternoon. I left the grill at medium and let the coconut milk drip off before placing on the grill. As previously suggested, I liberally sprinkled each side with cinnamon sugar as I turned them over. The smell was heavenly!

Don't think you can go wrong with these...the coconut flavor was mild in my opinion, which suited our guest. I'll make this over and over again.

Grilled pineapple is always great but I didnt really taste much of the cinnamon.  I will use more next time.  I served it with cocnut rice and teriyaki pork chops

So good. I used fresh pineapple and cut it in quarters then served it with caramel ice cream. Tasted like baked apples. Extremely delicious.

Excellent. I liked that I really couldn't taste the coconut. These were very nice, paired them with grilled teriyaki chicken. Thanks!
