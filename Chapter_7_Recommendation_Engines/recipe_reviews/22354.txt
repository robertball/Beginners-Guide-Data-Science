the people before me have said good things for this recipe but personally i tryed it and it was ver frustrating because it kept breaking apart and in the end it was just way too flaky.I have been cooking for a long time and i also took a cooking class where we learned how to make pastries and such. But i like trying new recipes and i can promise u that i will never try this one again.

My first time ever making pies, I used this recipe to make five double-crust apple pies and four pecan pies. They came out great, even though I messed up the first two crusts trying to roll them out between two pieces of wax paper. The rest rolled out beautifully on a floured tabletop. I used lard for the shortening. The crust was so flaky.

This crust recipe was just ok. I dont like having to wait overnight to make my pie. I like pie crusts that only need to be refridgerated for an hour or so. Coming out of the fridge it was really hard and I had to roll it in my hands until it got softer; but the consistency was kind of crumbly

This is a great easy pie crust recipe! Its not quite as good as one with eggs and vinegar, but it is very flaky and really does melt in your mouth! I didn't refridgerate mine, instead I put it in the freezer for about 3 hours. I also added a teaspoon of white sugar. Make sure your shortening is chilled, it makes things much easier!

I've been cooking for 30 years, and have never mastered the art of making pie crust until trying this recipe. It is melt in you mouth good, easy to make, and easily converted to vegan by using my favorite vegan margarine. A+++

I made this crust last night with the chocolate tofu pie filling. It was fabulous and my family had finished the pie for breakfast in less than an hour. On to another one today with the tofu and two for friends filled with a terrific vegan pumpkin filling.

Loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, this was my first attempt at a 'from scratch' pie crust. I used it on a double crust Chicken Pot Pie, It turned out beautiful, it was flakey and melted in our mouths. I don't think that I would choose this for a 'sweet' pie but definately will be using it again for meat pies.  I didn't have any plastic wrap so I stored the pieces all together in a tupperware container and they were just fine. I rolled them out on my counter top sprinkled in flour and folded them twice to transfer them to the pie plates and it worked beautifully for me. As I said this was my first attempt at a home made crust so I didn't flute the edges perfectly but it still came out of the oven looking pretty. I baked the pie at 450 for about 25 minutes I usually have to bake them for 35... so keep an eye on your pies, as this dough seemed to bake a little faster than normal.

Fantastic!, I wanted to try and make my own pie crust for the first time, this is my go-to website for recipes, and I came across this recipe, it works awesome, easy to do, the crust came out so flaky and light, I will never buy store pie crusts again.  This tastes great, I made a blueberry crumble pie with the crust.

My only complaint is that, in my opinion it gives 2 shells with 2 latices tops. Not 4 shells like in the description.

It is a perfect, tried-and-true recipe that is exactly what my g'ma and great-g'ma used and turns out absolutely beautiful EVERY time!  No fancy ingredients. Put it in freezer for about 1/2 hr. and it rolls out lovely.  Anyway...give this a shot and you may just think you're a pastry chef!

I've been using this recipe for years with my apple pies. I make 6-8 apple pies every year for Thanksgiving and this recipe has NEVER failed me and gets rave reviews. For those complaining about waiting overnight, I have had luck putting mine in the freezer while I prepped other things, and had no problems rolling it out that way.
