This is my recipe and I am always changing and adding things. I recently added fresh (or dried)basil and diced tomatoes along with the spinach and it makes this dish 2 times better. Thanks for the reviews and the comments.
Happy cooking

This recipe is so good I always double it, using a 12in. straight sided skillet. Great leftovers. There are some shortcuts that can cut the prep time at least in half.  I use a 30 oz bag of frozen potatoes, shredded or o'Brien.  Almost any size bag of prewashed spinach coarsely shredded will do.  Powdered garlic and onion can work fine if used generously. I have never used milk in it because I use a whole dozen extra-large eggs.  My mom, who is 95 likes it plain, my husband sprinkles it with cajun seasoning, and many eat it with salsa. In an extended family of disgustingly  finicky eaters, everyone from 3 to 95 likes this! Happily for me, I was told me about this dish over twenty years ago, but I have never seen it in print before. You have done everyone a huge favor by sharing it,Cheryl.

The possibilities are ENDLESS!  

I opted to cut the potatoes up, put them in a large bowl, coat them in olive oil, season with salt, pepper, italian seasoning, garlic salt, and cayan pepper, roll them around a bit to coat and THEN cook them.

I also put it in the oven to continue cooking the eggs.  I topped with cheddar, mozerella, and feta cheeses and a bit more italian seasoning and fresh tomatoes.

There are SOOO many things you can do with this recipe! Go to town!!!

Have made similar recipe for more years than I care to admit.  My only complaint about this one is that the potatoes were so bland they detractred from the overall flavour.  Try seasoning the potatoes with garlic powder, Mrs. Dash, and salt & pepper as they are cooking so they can absorb the flavors.  I always add mushrooms with the onions and garlic and saute until the water has cooked out.  I also omit some of the egg yolks (whites only), which allows me to add lots of yummy Swiss cheese without making the dish too decadent.

this was so easy to make and tasty.  i added twice as much spinach than what the recipe called for and a few less potatos.  i also put it in a 400 degree oven for about 8 minutes after it was on the burner for 6.  it was also very good the next day!

FANTASTIC!  This is the 1st recipe I've ever taken the time to write to you about because it was SO GOOD I made the time.  Even though it was the first time I made it, I modified it slightly by adding fresh, quartered grape tomatoes, 2 strips of bacon crumbled and doubled the cheese.  My 3 young boys would never eat cooked Spinach and before I knew it, the whole thing was gone!  Oh, I also substituted the fresh garlic with garlic salt because I figured it would be more evenly distributed that way. Of course I eliminated additional salt. I will make this ALOT!! Inexpensive, healthy, quick  - and eaten.  What else could you ask for?

This was pretty good, but I will be making some changes the next time I make it. Potatoes are best if sliced thin, but they only take about 8ish minutes to cook. Reduce the amount of olive oil you cook it in, and increase spinach and cheese if you don't want the potatoes to overpower it too much.

The proportions seemed off to me in the recipe.  I used large red potatoes so I only used two...but there were still way too many potatoes.  And even though I doubled the spinach, I thought there should have been more.  I will try this again...but I will cut down on the potatoes even more.  One other thing I would suggest is to generously add salt and pepper to the potatoes before addding the egg mixture...I found the potatoes to be a bit bland.

I made this with extra spinach and mini yukon gold potatoes.  Also I used six egg whites and three whole eggs instead of six whole eggs.  Light and delicious dinner!

I made this frittata for brunch for friends and it was really easy and quick. Everybody loved it!!
I doubled the spinach and it was delicious (and  
I dont  even like spinach!). The next time I made 
it, I used jalapeno jack cheese instead of the
cheddar--and it was even better!!

You can do so much with this recipe...it is great!  Used half the potatoes, added sauted mushrooms, some chopped sweet red peppers, sliced red onion and subbed swiss cheese for the cheddar...  Eventhough I made so many changes, I still feel that I can rate this recipe with 5 stars, I'm sure it would be great as is, too!  I would probably have made it without the extra veggies had my H been home to keep me reeled in!  I did cook the potatoes on the stove top, added the other veggies then transferred to a pie plate and added the cheese and eggs.  Baked in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.

This was awesome exactly as is.  However the cooking method really doesn't work.  You have to work some of the egg down over the sides of the frittata when on the burner and then when bottom is done, put it in a 400 degree over for 7 or 8 minutes.  It's the only way I found to get he egg done with frittatas.  The taste of this one is excellent and will make it again.

This was great!  I sliced the potatoes very thin and took the advice of some reviewers by tossing them with salt, pepper and granulated garlic.  I didn't have green onions on hand so I chopped some yellow onion very fine and tossed it in with the potatoes.  I also arranged the potatoes in a very thin layer so that it would make a crust.  I let them cook for a long time to get nice and dark on the bottom before tossing in the spinach and ham.  I mixed most of the cheese into the egg and milk mixture (reserved a little bit to sprinkle on the top), and let it set a bit on the edges before finishing it off in a really hot oven.  Delicious and soon to be repeated.

First, I modified the recipe, so take my rating for what it's worth. However, it did turn out really well. I used half butter half grapeseed oil to cook the potatoes and added 1/4 cup of frozen chopped onion to the potatoes as they cooked. I let the potatoes start to brown and get crispy edges over medium high heat with a little sea salt. My spinach was already cooked and seasoned leftovers, plus added a bit of paprika, cayenne pepper, basil and nutmeg. I was short one egg so added a little more milk and used fat reduced colby jack cheese. Also I also baked it off in the oven at 350 degrees rather than trying to get it cooked right on the stovetop with a lid. Everyone really liked it and my family of five include children and a 95 year old, so we're talking about some very diverse food preferences. I served this for dinner with the cinnamon pumpkin waffles from this site. It was a good combo.

Great quick dinner when you don't have a lot of time to cook.  Used regular onion and added sliced carrots and a few slices turkey bacon, chopped, to the pan.  Added some spices to the mix such as cumin and transferred vegetables to an ovenproof dish that I sprayed with Pam.  Poured in the egg, topped with cheese, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Cut it into wedges and served and everyone loved it.

Fantastic. Really! I used a bag of frozen spinach, since that is what I had on hand, and shredded the potatoes because I prefer the texture. I also added some beef chorizo. I baked it instead of using the stovetop method, since I had other things on the stove (made this for a brunch) and it worked very well @ 375 for about 30 minutes. It didn't dry out, which was my concern. Next time I think I'm going to try bacon. YUM!

This was excellent! Substituted garlic powder for fresh garlic and frozen spinach for fresh. I cooked the potatoes until lightly browned and then added the remaining ingredients mixed into the eggs, pouring it over the potatoes. Once it was almost completely cooked, I flipped it out of the pan onto a plate, and cooked on the other side. Then, there was a crispy potato crust on the top. Delicious!!!

Update: I made this again this morning but decided to use tomato basil feta cheese and also added some dried basil and the garlic, salt & pepper to the potatoes.  Missed the tomato but did everything else the same as below.  Absolutely wonderful additions!  It also only took 7 minutes on the stove and 2.5 minutes under the broiler.  Not sure why but it's good to keep an eye on it.  Original: Due to what I had on hand, I changed a couple of the ingredients.  I used 2 cups of sliced fingerling potatoes and a shallot instead of green onions.  I also added 4 sliced large brown mushrooms towards the end of the potato cooking time.  For the eggs, I used 4 large eggs & 1/2 cup egg substitute (cutting back on fat). Then after I added the egg, I sliced a medium tomato and placed that on top, then added the cheese.  I cooked this in a cast iron skillet so I could throw it in the oven on broil to cook the top.  It took a lot longer than 5-7 minutes to cook the eggs.  I had it in the broiler off and on for a total of 3 minutes and probably about 10-14 minutes total on the stove.  (And oops!  I forgot the salt/pepper/garlic but it still was excellent.  Sure it would be better with the garlic at least.)  Thanks for a delicious (and low calorie) morning.

This was a foolproof frittata recipe. I had 25 cooking labs of high school students make this for a breakfast buffet. Only one of the labs screwed this up which is pretty darn impressive.  The potatoes were a little too much so we cut it down to 3 other than that we kept the recipe as is. The kids and faculty loved it. Thanks for this easy and reliable recipe!

Delicious and very quick to cook.  I substituted chives for green onions, and cooked it about 10 minutes longer in the oven. A real hit with the whole family!

Great recipe, I did add thinly sliced pumpkin (same time as the potato) I also added zuccini, red capsicum and mushrooms. I guess you can add just about any vegies to a base like this. Partner announced that I can make this again anytime. Great recipe, very tasty. Thanx!

Eggscellent!  I used 2 regular potatoes(because I didn't have small, red ones) peeled and sliced very thin.  Instead of salt and pepper I added a pinch of cayene and nutmeg.  I used 1 1/2 cups of torn spinach.   Before adding the cheese I laid slices of cooked bacon on top of the eggs.  For cheese I used TexMex shredded (sprinkled generously).  After cooking for 7 minutes on low, I put the pan in the oven and broiled on high until lightly browned.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for submitting it Cheryl H.

This was delicious. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I found the top of the frittata did not set. This was a perfect opportunity to pull out the blow torch to finish cooking the eggs and lightly brown the cheese.

This was fabulous!  I used only 3 potatoes (instead of 6), and an entire bag of spinach (instead of 1 cup).  As someone suggested, I added chopped tomatoes (3/4 cup) and chopped fresh basil (2 Tbl.).  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  Added extra seasoning for flavor.  Would be good with mushrooms and meat also.  I'm updating this to five stars.  I've made it several times, using mushrooms if I have them on hand, and it is always so good!

My first time making a frittata so I followed the directions exact.  Was one egg short but didn't seem to matter.  The end result was very neat and delicious.  I'll definitely hang on to this one and make variations with mushrooms, tomatoes and some funky cheese.  But thanks for being my first! :)

Super recipe.. Very versatile. I added Tomatoes and some basil and it was a hit. I am looking forward to using this recipe in many different ways. Its a shame others are so negative.

I've made this twice, and found it to be all right, but not one of my absolute favorites. I like the suggestion of adding broccoli. I too have also added more spinach. The last time I made it, I only had 5 eggs, and it still turned out fine.

This tasted very good, after some additions. I added bell pepper and mushroom as well as a bit of nutmeg, dried basil, cayenne and chili pepper and doubled the amount of cheese and spinach. However, I still felt that something was missing so I think next time I'll add more cayenne to give it a little more kick.

This is a great base recipe.  I would be sure to add plenty of salt and pepper.  Also add some dried herbs (I used an "egg and vegetable mix" from our farmer's market) and a good bit of hot sauce to the egg mix.  I substituted red pepper for the green onion - just used what I had.  Though, I think the green onion would be good too.  I also used frozen spinach and it worked well.  It took longer than the 5-7 minutes for my eggs to get firm at the end.

Very good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. Perhaps next time I make it I'll tweak the recipe and add some more flavor.

Easy and yummy.  I browned the potato slices until crisp on the outside, carmalized the onions, and added a little fresh ground Parmaean on top and that was really good.

loved it - definitely use whatever ingredients you enjoy on omelets. The potato adds a nice "bottom" for the frittata! The amount of potatoes may seem like a lot but it turns out perfect in the end.

it has great potential!  Good flavor.  The potato slices were a little difficult to cut through.  I think that next time I will buy hash brown potatoes (in the refrigerated section at the grocery store) to use instead of sliced red potatoes.

Really good, a keeper.  As others suggested, I decreased the amount of potatoes to 4 small red and I seasoned them while cooking.  I used pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt; these changes worked out great.  I also used pepper jack cheese in addition to cheddar.

This was very good.  I used white potatoes and more spinach like other recommendations.  I love making Frittatas.  Just use what you have on hand.  I have the perfect size large skillet.  I cook everything in the skillet, pour on the eggs and pop it in the oven until the eggs are done.

Great basic recipe.  I like to put the pan under the broiler for a minute or two to firm up the top without overcooking the bottom.

This was super fast and yummy!  Didn't have any green onions so used regular white ones, and diced the potatoes instead of slicing because I thought that would be too hard without a mandolin...Also put it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the cheese nice and bubbly!  Thanks for the recipe

Very good. I used one medium sized russet potatos and one small red potato as that is what I had. I also added 1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms and sliced roma tomato after pouring the eggs over. 6 eggs didn't seem to be enough so I increased to 8 and put the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 after it was mostly set on the stove top to allow it to finish cooking.

5 STARS for this great, versatile recipe. Upped all the amounts by a smidge to make two "pies" which I then baked like a quiche, for 40 minutes @ 350 degrees. I topped each plate with fresh, farmer's market tomatoes and basil mixed with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. What a huge hit - just what I was in the mood for. Thank you, Cheryl!

Loved this!  Really easy, filling, and easy to change up.  I added leeks and bacon, but you could tweak this a hundred different ways.  I made this in my ancient cast-iron skillet and don't have a fitting lid, so once I added the eggs, I put in the oven at 350 for 12-15 minutes until it was set.  Got rave reviews from brunch guests and picky hubby.

This is great.  I use whatever veggies/cheese/potatoes I have leftover and throw it in.  Sometimes I leave the potatoes out. I throw in fresh herbs if I have them.  So versatile.  I always use the same ratio of eggs to milk.  I also put it under the broiler for a minute or so to brown it.

I also added a diced onion to this recipe and cooked them with the potatoes.  I microwaved the potato for 4 minutes before putting it in the pan so that it would cook faster.  I used butter instead of olive oil and mixed some of the cheese in with the egg and put some on top.  I broiled the frittata for 3 minutes after cooking it on the stovetop.  Yum.

I used extra potatoes, spinach and cheese and the egg was taking a long time to set on the top  so I had to finish cooking it under the broiler in the oven.  Also I seasoned the potatoes and egg and milk mixture with lots of salt and pepper and substituted mozzarella cheese for cheddar so my husband would eat it.  Really delicious.  Everyone at my Easter brunch loved it.

I am incapable of making a recipe (off any site w/out reading reviews )    I added tomato, 2 cups spinach, (per other reviews) Tossed the potatos with oil and garlic pwdr., salt,pepper and some spicy seasoning my husband makes.
I used a jalapeno cheese blend, (put  some in the egg blend)and some on top. Through out, I added Italian seasoning.
Broiled at the end for a minute. We ate almost the whole thing for Ash Wedensday dinner,followed by dessert crepes from this site(with a few changes).

I made this for breakfast this morning. I added 1oz of ham per serving, though, because we like meat in there. I have to cut down on the garlic next time, because my husband doesn't like . It was very tasty and delicious. My daughter liked it, also. I would definitly make it again. Thanks.

I served this for a teacher breakfast, adding diced turkey sausage, purple onion for color and sharp cheddar to top. I did keep it warm in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes to just make sure it was cooked thoruoughly. This dish was delightful, and was a a big hit with my colleagues!

Delicious and easy. I followed the advice from other reviews and seasoned the potatoes. I also added chopped up ham. I put the frittata in the oven for 5 minutes to finish cooking the eggs. I will definitely cook it again.

The potatoes should be well-seasoned. Other than that, delicious! I added chopped red peppers and turkey breakfast sausage. I also had to add another egg since I upped the ingredients. Threw some basil on top for curb appeal. Just season those potatoes!

We just made this for brekkie yesterday. I don't have a pan that would hold that much so! 2 LARGE (well, regular-large) white potatoes, 4 eggs, a bit less cheese, otherwise the same. Delish, except it took longer to set up due to reduced eggs probably (about 15 minutes and I had to turn up the temp at the end). I am thinking sweet potatoes, apples and nutmeg would be a wonderful spin...with mozza or brie :-) Thanks for a good base recipe that DOES NOT involve flipping!!

Great recipe! And you can use pretty much anything in your fridge that you want to use up. I only used 3 small red potatoes which I seasoned with cumin, garlic salt, and pepper prior to cooking. I also used uncooked asparagus cut in 1" pieces, instead of spinach, and added chopped ham at the same time as the asparagus and green onion. I used a bit more garlic than called for and used a mix of pepperjack and cheddar cheese. I also added about 1/4 cup of cilantro to the egg mixture. I certainly recommend putting it under the broiler when it's almost finished, which browns the top nicely and gives it a little more "fluff".

Many people have given this a lower rating because they say it's bland. I give it 5 stars because it's so versatile.  I used leftover honeybaked ham, one small pineapple that was cooked on the ham, 3 russett potatoes sliced thin, 1/2 small sweet onion diced and added to potatoes. I cooked the potatoes and onions and spiced them to my liking as recommended. Then I added the ham and pineapple. Then I added 7 extra large eggs beaten with the milk.  Didn't use spinach because fam doesn't like it.  I only used three potatoes...four would have been better.  Almost didn't have enough to cover bottome of pan. Someone mentioned putting a small amount of water in the potatoes..but this made them too soft. They crumbled up, but it was still awesome! I served with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chopped grape tomatoes.  Will use this again many times!

This was a very easy recipe.  I used Simply Potatoes to speed up the potato cook time, seasoned with Lawry's and pepper. Used a container of egg beaters instead of milk and eggs and added tomatoes when I put the spinach and onion in.  I put this in oven at 350 after letting cook on the burner for about 5 minutes.  I didn't have a lid big enough for my skillet to cover it.

i read the reviews (as i always do, for an inspired changes) and they are dead on. definitely season the potatoes in a bowl before adding to the pan. i opted for garlic powder, sea salt and  a peppercorn medley. i didn't use nearly as many potatoes, you honestly don't need too. i used more green onions and spinach. i added garlic salt to the vegetable mix while cooking. i made it for easter brunch and my family raved all day about it. will most assuredly make again... with my tweaks of course.

This recipe was SOOO easy.  I used 2% cheddar cheese and 1% milk and it turned out great.  5 Weight Watchers Points per servings.  So delicious.  Next time I'm going to add tomatoes I think.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

My potatoes must have been too big.  I used five red potatoes, but I wouldn't consider them "small".  My fritatta ended up taking about 12 minutes for the eggs to firm up.  The family seemed to like it, also I added some roasted red bell peppers on top with the cheese.

needs salt, too much garlic.  Will be fine with those changes-but don't know if that makes it non-south beach friendly.

I cooked this for dinner tonight and it was really good!  If you are having it as a main dish, I'd say it serves 2-3 people.  I also added a little brocolli to the mix.  Next time I would try a diced white onion instead of the scallions, which kind of disappeared in the dish.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!  :)

The recipe turned out delicious.   I eliminated the potatoes, used frozen spinach and added mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, yellow onions and a few slices of red bell pepper. I will definitely add to my book of favorite recipes.

I was pretty disappointed by this, actually. It has a lot of potential, but exactly as written, it's lacking in flavor.

I was just itching to add seasoning to the potatoes, so I came to check on reviews.. after seeing so many mentions of it, I sprinkled them with garlic powder [after already succumbing to the urge to salt them]. I was sorely tempted to cook with butter instead of olive oil, but it was already in the pan...

Anyway, it was edible, but lacking in serious flavor. This COULD be wonderful- add more seasoning along the way, add in some more flavorful ingredients [it's just asking for tomatoes!] As written, it's pretty blah.

Good recipe! After reading others suggestions for adding more flavor, I sauteed onions, seasoned frozen potatoes and frozen artichokes and spinach in some bacon drippings. Topped with fresh mozzarella and finished in the broiler to brown. Topped with pesto to serve for extra garlicky goodness! Very pretty too!

Delicious, but it took at least 10 minutes on 3-4 for the eggs to firm up. If your family is super-hungry, might want to give them a 45 minute estimate instead of a 30 minute.

I am on South Beach Diet. I omitted the potatoes and used mushrooms instead. I think adding garbanzos would be good, too.Will do this one again. Iay use the liquid egg products to cut down on cholesterol.

I used leeks instead of spinach and used Paula Dean's House Seasoning instead of salt and this was sooo yummy! I forgot to add the milk and used regular idaho potatoes but it was still very good. My kids enjoyed it as well! This is a keeper and I found another use for leftover leeks!

Simple, fast, and delicious.  I too added diced tomato (one medium tomato for 4 eggs), plus an Italian seasoning blend and basil.  Ended up eyeballing the ingredients since I only used 4 eggs and it still turned out fantastic.

We like this recipe a lot-- can easily  be adjusted to ones taste--
I especially like the fact that it does not call for a large quantity of cheese-- more healthy!
A double frittata pan makes it much easier!
We serve with fresh salsa!

This is a fantastic basic recipe and I have made it frequently.  Due to personal taste, I always reduce the amount of potatoes in half, slice them very thinly and add seasoning (cook's salt) when first cooking the potatoes.  I also double the spinach.  For the last few minutes I transfer from my wok to a large flat glass pie plate and then broil in the oven so the top is nicely done.  Delicious!!

This was fine but not as super-yummy as I was hoping. I put some salt and pepper on the potatoes while they were cooking to hopefully help season it, but I still felt it was a little blah. I think it could definitely be improved in various ways - by adding some seasoning, perhaps more spinach, and/or using a more flavorful cheese like feta or goat cheese.

This was quick and easy recipe.  Great ending to Girl's Weekend!  I did, however, make some adjustments. Since I do not typically use salt, I substituted Mrs.Dash and Italian Seasoning.  Instead of using the red potatoes, I used bagged hash browns and significantly browned first, added diced ham, and topped with Feta.  In addition, I put my pan in the broiler for a few minutes to get the cheese all brown and bubbly!  It was a great hit!

This is an easy and tasty recipe, and one that I highly recommend.  I needed to add a few more minutes at the end to get the eggs to completely set. I was out of spinach, but just used salad mix for the greens. I also minced my garlic instead of crushing it. My husband loved this dish. Try it!

This was SO GOOD. We scaled it down for just two of us and cooked it in a small saucepan to get the right shape. Subbed regular onion for green as I didn't have any. I also added basil and tomato as the post suggested. Next time I will add more spinach because you can never have enough! I loved the potatoes and the garlic, and the tomatoes really added to it. I'll mix it up next time but this is great! Thank you!

Wonderful dish! I used frozen hash browns instead of potatoes and I basically doubled the recipe for a big group. I was worried that it wasn't going to cook right because the top was liquid and the sides were a little to brown but I just let it keep cooking and it was perfect. Especially the crispy brown edges!

Made this is an old, well-seasoned cast iron skillet and used frozen broccoli florets instead of spinach.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent! Made an tasty, fast, and nutritious dinner!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I cooked mine in a small cast iron skillet. It was so thick I didn't think it'd cool through on the stove. I put in under the broiler for 15 minutes or so, and it cooked right up.

I just made this for my mom's birthday brunch and everyone loved it. It's super easy and really delicious. I thought 6 potatoes was just right, though mine were very small which is probably the key. I was cooking bacon at the same time, so I added a little bacon grease. It definitely wasn't bland. One thing to note, the last step took 15+ minutes, not 5-7, and I also put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end. I'll definitely make this again.

I thought this was pretty tasty and I would make again. I used other reviewer's suggestions and jazzed up the potatoes a little by adding 1 Tbsp olive oil to them in a bowl and mixing with a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried basil, and dried oregano.  I also had other veggies on hand, like grape tomatoes and a few mushrooms so I threw those into the frittata.  Next time I'll add even more mushrooms b/c I love them with spinach.  I had frozen spinach on hand so I used the whole box of that.  I also added nutmeg to the spinach and some basil to the eggs.  I used 3 whole eggs and 6 egg whites (calorie cutter).  I cooked it on the stovetop and then transferred to the oven at 350 for about 6 minutes and then set it to broil at the very end.  Had it for dinner and little kids and husband all liked it.  It also reheated nicely for breakfast.

So easy! I cheat and use canned sliced potatoes (when I tried to do it with fresh potatoes, they took FOREVER and weren't worth it, which is why I only gave it 4 stars) generously seasoned with whatever's in reach.  I use more spinach than stated, and find that it really helps to put the pan under the broiler for a couple minutes to firm up the top.

Excellent, easy to do recipe.  I bought a lot of baby spinach and had the rest of the ingredients, with the exception of a medium skillet.  It still came out great.  I changed it a bit, took about 10 minutes to cook, then I put the skillet in the broiler for 1 minute.  Great!

I think many adjustments had to be made.  First, 6 potatoes are just too many, even if they are small.  I think if you're cutting/slicing the potatoes and you reach 2 cups, that should suffice.  Also, just putting the potatoes on the stove for 10 minutes covered just makes them burn.  If anything, add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup a water.  I also added basil and paprika as this recipe is quite bland.  I would add much more spinach and garlic.  Also, I had to finish this in the broiler for 5 minutes as the top was not cooked through.  Also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top for extra flavor.  It's good basic recipe but needs much tweaking and can be good for all sorts of veggies.  Bon appetite!

I thought I had to have a $90 frittata pan before I could make a frittata but that's not the case. This recipe is easy and delicious and you can easily make changes. Last time I made it I added some fresh cilantro. Next time I'm going to add some aspargus and tomato slices. Excellent recipe!

Loved this one....made a few changes because of what I had on hand. I did use a box of frozen spinach drained instead of the fresh, used vidalia onion instead of the green and used 8 eggs instead of 6. I also baked this in a pyrex pie plate at 350 till golden brown and set. Really liked the red potatoes with the spinach. A nice hearty frittata, will make again. Thanks!

This was bland as-is. It definitely needs more seasoning and/or add-ins for flavor. If I make it again, I will see if adding a more scallions will help.

I've never made a frittata before.  This recipe is a keeper.  I read the reviews and followed a couple of the suggestions: reduced the amount of pototates, flavored the potatoes with Mrs. Dash, and increased the spinach.  In addition, I cooked the frittata on the stovetop for 5 minutes and then transfered it over to a 400* oven for an additional 10 minutes.  This is a great hearty brunch!

i love this recipe because you customize it w/whatever you like. after heavily seasoning my potatoes and cooking them, i then added a little butter to saute my onions. this added that extra buttery flavor. i also substituted freshly grated parmesan and it came out scrum-diddly-umptious. next time i'm going to add red bell peppers and mushrooms.

Followed some of the other suggestions in seasoning the potatoes (italian seasoning and cayenne pepper) before cooking and it came out great!! Also put in half an italian sausage, crumbled and fried beforehand. Topped with gouda/cheddar/mozza blend and put in the oven on broil for the last few mins so the top cooked and cheese came out melty. Did not change potato/spinach amounts, but only used four eggs and it was just fine.

What more can I say, it was delicious!  I don't think I changed a thing, although the second time I made it, I used collard greens instead of spinach, because it's what I had on hand.  In that case, I added the greens a little sooner than the recipe says, since they take longer to wilt.  Like many other posters, I had to finish this in the oven, under the broiler.

This recipe's a great starting point.  I like the quickness and healthiness.  But I was surprised it never got broiled!  I broiled mine after the bottom was cooked.  I also added a lot of seasonings and would double that next time!  moral of the story: Add Spices!

My family really enjoyed this dish tonight. I did add more seasonings and instead of cooking it on top of the stove, I baked it in the oven. A quick, healthy and easy week nite meal that pairs well with a nice fresh spinach salad. Thank you Cheryl!

This was a great dish - so easy and tasty. You could really do anything with it. Next time I'll add more spinach, less potatoes and maybe throw in some mushrooms. YUM! Next time I'm looking to clean out my fridge I'll make this. Thanks!

Easy & very good.  A keeper. I subsituted frozen spinach and yellow onions.  You do, however, need to put it in the oven or under the broiler to set the eggs.  Only change, next time use more cheese.

I shredded my potatoes for this recipe and it makes a lot so there was a lot leftover.  I tell you this was better the next day.  My husband thought it was a bit dry so he ate it with ketchup.

Ok as is (we added more spinach), but next time we'll even add more. I think we'll use mushrooms (portabello) & maybe some pepperjack cheese for some spice.

I made this one morning when we were looking for something different than the traditional eggs and toast. It was wonderful! I didn't have any potatoes that day and it still was wonderful. I can't wait to make with potatoes next time as I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks for a great breakfast!

This is, arguably one of the best recipes I've tried.  It is so flavorful and pretty much makes a whole meal by itself.  My husband has even taken leftovers for his lunch and it reheats well.  A quick meal, the longest part is just preparing the veggies.

This was a great recipe although I increased the size to 8 eggs and 8 potatoes and used sliced green onions as well as half a regular yellow onion. Also, since I live in France and don't really have access to Cheddar cheese, I used freshly-grated Parmesan Reggiano instead. I also added a dash of onion powder and some other mixed herbs.

This is easy and delicous.  Definitely double the spinach and living in the south I used Vidalia onions which are in season now and it added a delicate sweet touch to it.

A winner! I made this for my book club and it was a hit.   I reviewed the others' comments and made the following changes from the basic recipe:
3 B-sized red potatoes (instead of 6): they were seasoned w/garlic powder, salt, pepper and olive oil prior to cooking.
2+ cups chopped fresh spinach (instead of 1)
1/2 of a red bell pepper chopped and added w/the spinach and garlic.
Yellow onion instead of the green onion (because it's what I had on hand.)
3T fresh basil with the spinach +
1/4 c slivered fresh basil on the top of the frittata prior to baking.
I used a 'Mexican' blend shredded cheese (again because that's what I had on hand.)
I cooked the frittata stove top for 6m and then in a 350F oven for 10m.
Two thumbs up!

Too many potatoes and not enough spinach or cheese! It was not at all bad. 

Less potatoes, more cheddar, more spinach!

Added onions and garlic to potatoes earlier to flavor them.  Used a lot more spinach and parmesan instead of cheddar; no milk.  This tasted good but did not set up until I put it in the oven to bake for 400 at 5 minutes after cooking on stovetop.  This is an important change to cooking method but was tasty.

Like several other reviewers said, this recipe is very versatile and easy to work with. I halved the recipe since it was for just two people and I added mushrooms and I used mozzarella cheese. I had a hard time getting the potatoes to become soft enough in my frying pan so I think I may microwave them or boil them for about 10 minutes next time but there will definitely be a next time! This is relatively healthy, cheap and delicious, a perfect combination.

I am going thru a phase these days with an aversion to potatos so I used white rice instead. I also did not have spinach on hand but tomatos and green pepper and some cooked chicken. I made a two serving dish which came out very nice. Thx fir sharing it.

I don't normally like frittatas, but my boyfriend and I are trying to find more ways to get healthy protein in our breakfasts, so I thought I'd give this a shot.  All the ingredients are things I love, and this worked perfectly.  Tasty and fluffy.  Big win!

Used red onions chopped. This recipe does need some pizzaz so I used lots of black and red paprika with italian seasoning on the chopped potatoes. Spring onions is a better choice, but i had only red onions. I used Mexican cheese mix and still tasted yum!

Great recipe you can change up a million ways. I didn't have milk, so I used Greek yogurt. You can spice up and add veggies to your taste!

This was a very good recipe. I doubled it, diced the potatoes and added more cheese. It tasted as good as it smelled. I like the suggestions from others and will try some next time. (I forgot to take a pic before I had cut it).

I cooked my potatoes til golden and done in coconut oil seasoned with smoked paprika, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders. I used collard greens because I'd gotten some from the CSA today and couldn't figure out what to use them for. I can imagine that this would have been very bland if I hadn't seasoned the potatoes first, but it's so versatile that I gave it four stars. I'd never made a frittata before; quiche, yes.

So happy to find a recipe for a frittata that I had the ingredients on hand.  I could also add to it and it still was very good!

I cut the potatoes into a large dice and used twice as much fresh spinach as the recipe calls for.  There are so many things you can do to make this a different dish each time.  Ham would be phenomenal as would tomatoes.  I finished the frittata in a 350 degree oven.  It took about six or seven minutes and it was perfect!  Reheated the next day it was still delicious so this would be a perfect recipe to make on the weekend and heat up for busy weekday mornings.

I made the frittata today for a friend and it was wonderful. I made a couple of small changes. I cooked four strips of center cut bacon and used the bacon grease and a small amount of olive oil to cook the potatoes. I added the bacon to the dish and stired it in before sprinkling the dish with cheese.

This had an interesting taste.  Probably won't make it again, but if I do, I think I would mix the spinach, green onions and garlic together and pour it over the potatoes instead of mixing it all together.  The potatoes would make an excellent "crust" for the bottom.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Loved this recipe.  Made a few changes, regular chopped yellow onion instead of green onions, used a variety of potatoes, red, baby yukons & purple potatoes.  Used Herbamare seasoning instead of salt & pepper.  We ate this as a brunch and it was delicious.  Will definitelty make this recipe again!!!

This was the perfect recipe for me to learn to make a frittata with.  I have made it twice so far.  My only change is the addition of more seasoning.

I make this for breakfast frequently.  It's filling and doesn't take all that long to put together.  Make sure, however, that you use the small red potatoes, not the medium or large size, if you're scaling the recipe for one person.

Pretty good, if not exactly flavor packed.  I did add some diced country ham as well.  If I were to make this again, I would do as other reviewers suggested and try seasoning the potatos and using more spinach.  As is, the recipe feels like it is missing something.

4 1/2 stars.  Extra points for being easy!  Made it as is, adding lots of extra garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the potatoes.

I thought this was good right out of the oven, but just okay the next day.  I did add some seasonings (salt/pepper/garlic powder/oregano) to the potatoes, which helped a lot with flavor.  I feel like it would have been dull without it.  Not one of my favorite recipes, but it was good fresh out of the oven.

Excellent dish and was a hit at my brunch.  However, the potatoes weren't fully cooked.  They either need to be microwaved for a minute beforehand, or cooked a lot longer on the stove.

This was a delicious treat for breakfast and easier to make than I'd expected. I used sweet potatoes (because that's what I found in my pantry), and it was they provided a sweet contrast to the spinach.

This was okay.  I took a suggestion from other reviewers and seasoned the potatoes with garlic, s&p before adding the spinach and egg but I still don't think it was enough.  It was a little bland.  Definitely increase the amount of spinach to at least 1 1/2-2 cups.  It was good, but with a lot of extra work it could be even better.

I took everyone's advise and reduced the amount of potatoes used. 4 was more than plentiful.  I would recommend using fresh garlic, I didn't and it affected the flavour slightly. I also added chopped bacon that I fried over a pan before adding this in.  Also want to say that this bakes very well, I didn't have a skillet and being my first frittata i wanted to make sure that it was going to be cooked so I put it into the oven and covered with foil and it cooked beautifully.  I think it's a very versatile recipe that you can add or remove ingredients as you wish.

Delicious and easy!  It always gets rave reviews from guests.  By accident, I always seem to use too many potatoes, but I add another egg or two and it still turns out awesome.  Oh, I also add a pound of cooked, chopped bacon...

DELICIOUS. I used russet potatoes instead of red skinned and shredded them instead of slicing. It turned out very yummy :)

I love this done with the tomatoes and basil.  I left out the spinach this time because we served Costco Spanakopita on the side.  Doubled everything except the potatoes because I used my big skillet.

This is so very delicious. The only thing I did different was left out the salt as my husband is on a low sodium diet. Will definately be making this over and over!

I preseasoned the sliced potatoes with cayenne pepper, garlic salt, and pepper.  Cut down on the potatoes by 1/3 and doubled the spinach.  I also used 3 whole eggs + 3 egg whites to make it a bit healthier.  Topped it with mild cheddar cheese though next time I'll try sharp cheddar or some other stronger cheese to make it more flavorful.  Overall, a pretty good dish but it definitely needed more flavor even with my changes.

Sorry, but I didn't like this at all.  The ingredients were bland and boring.  More importantly, in comparison with other frittatas that become light and fluffy after being baked in the oven, this one is cooked over the stove the whole time, so it turns out soggy and mushy.

This was delicious!!  I added tomatoes and finished it off in the oven to make the cheese bubbly and browned. I also used frozen hash brown potatoes and seasoned with italian seasoning before adding the veggies.  Amazing - and so easy!

Loved the veggies and the cheese in this. However, I found the potatoes to be quite bland. If I make this again, I will probably reduce the potatoes and add other veggies instead.

This was a great base recipe.  It didn't have a lot of flavor...my bf said that it tasted like cheesy hash browns.  I think I'll add tomato and basil and bacon, maybe some additional spices, the next time I make it.  Great recipe, just doesn't have much flavor.  Love how quick and easy it was to make, though.

Yum! This is a great recipe because you can add whatever you want, depending on what you like and what you have in your fridge! I made mine with eggs, milk, hash browns, spinach, mushrooms, salami, tomatoes, onions, cheddar cheese and added some different seasoning, after cooking on the stove for a while I put it in the oven to broil. It was a great hit, will definitely be making this often!! I am always looking for different ways to include vegetables at mealtime and this makes a great sidedish. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't have green onions so I chopped a small yellow onion and added it when taters were about half done.  Added 1 shredded carrot.  Surprisingly sweet flavored.

We are absolutely making this again.  Even my husband who is not thrilled about green onion or spinach said it was excellent.  It's quick to make, too.  Next time, I may try egg beaters because I think with all the other flavors it will work well.

Very good.  Made it for "breakfast for dinner" but it could have been dinner in its own right.  I seasoned the potatoes with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Lawry's seasoned salt before I cooked them.  In addition to what the recipe calls for, I added 1 diced tomato and fresh basil.  Had mushrooms but forgot to put them in.  Would have been better with the mushrooms because I think I used too much basil.  Used 4 eggs + 3 egg whites so the eggs took longer to cook than the recipe said.  Next time I hope to have a bigger pot/pan to make it in so it's larger and thinner.  Abe loved it, I liked it (would have liked it better with less basil).  I would definitely make it again.

I like to stay as close to the original recipe when I first try a recipe on here, and like many others have written, this recipe is a very good place to start.  The basic idea was great.  Just a little bland.  I added mushrooms and extra spinach.  I'll most likely make it again, but next time I'll probably add more seasoning.  It was a nice light breakfast and VERY easy.  One dish.  I like that.  :) Like others, I started on the stovetop for 7 mins, and threw it in the oven at 400 for about 10 mins more.  Came out perfect.

Good breakfast idea for something a bit different from the norm.  Basically, you could add whatever items you would want.  The egg did take a while to set.

This recipe was a great starter for an amazing breakfast! I made some alterations and added quite a bit, and it turned out fantastic. Still needed a bit more salt in the end. Here is what I did: 
Used half the oil
I only used 4 potatoes, added dried basil while cooking those plus seasoned them with a bit of salt and pepper
Then I added in about 3 times that much spinach and 3 times the green onions - with some water added to help wilt them without the extra oil
Added 8 oz fresh mushrooms - chopped
Added 1 green bell pepper - diced
Added 2 extra tablespoon fulls of minced garlic
Added 2 more eggs and more milk (used skim milk)
Added a tomato (chopped) with the eggs and milk
Added Muenster Cheese to the top and sprinkled the cheddar on top of that
Then I finished it in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes instead of cooking it the rest of the way on the stove top

LOTS of veggies in it, and it's SO good! I think it would be awesome with some salsa or tobasco. Maybe next time I might use some garlic salt on the potatoes and dice a jalepeno to add with the spinach for a bit of kick (no seeds - can't be too spicy in the morning, lol).

Very delicious and easy to make. I used a mandoline to slice my potatoes, making them quite thin. I didn't have cheddar so I dabbed on some neufchatel cheese instead. Like other reviewers, I finished mine under the broiler because the bottom was getting perfect and I didn't want it to burn. I agree with others who say the recipe could use more garlic and onion. When it was served, I topped it with homemade mean green tomato salsa which is heavy on the garlic, my own secret recipe. Super yum, thanks for the recipe!

This is great, either as written or with modifications such as adding mushrooms, bacon, or peppers. I agree with prior reviewers. Use the broiler.

Wonderful! Made a few changes: used 2 cans diced potatoes, drained (because I was feeling lazy), added extra (baby)spinach, skipped the green onions because I was out, used swiss instead of cheddar, and added roasted red peppers because I find any excuse to use them. Turned out beautifully. Started on the oven and finished in 400 degree oven as others suggested. This will definetly go into regular weekend rotation.

This cooks up beautifully. Next time I will add about 1 cup of shredded cheese to the egg mixture and then top it with the cheese that is already called for in the recipe.

I loved this recipe. It even made my father happy and he's one of those who have to have meat with every meal. I have made it several times and decided that I should take the time to review it. Absolutely great. :)

This is a great "basic" recipe that tastes good as it is, but which can also be improvised depending on what you have in the fridge. I shredded one whole potato and used up leftover scalloped potatoes from Easter (the Three Cheese Garlic Scalloped recipe also on Allrecipes). I shredded some sweet white onion for flavor and topped with bacon pieces and parmesan. It was a hit at my brunch potluck!

YUMMY! Loved how easy this way and made just a few changes to make this a little more to my family's liking. We used Feta cheese instead of cheddar, added halved grape tomatoes, extra spinach, and extra green onion. I also added a couple of dashes of dried basil (since I didnt have fresh.) Turned out wonderfully, however, it took MUCH longer than 5-7 min for my eggs to set so keep that in mind (closer to 12-15 min for me. Also I used 3 real eggs and 3 egg subs (Rediegg).

Yum...loved this one!  There are so mnay variations with this recipe, the combos are endless, which is fantastic!  I used diced red potatoes (2 large ones), left out the onions (personal pref) and added (with baby spinach) a ton of mini bella mushrooms, fresh basil and diced tomatoes.  I also only used 4 eggs with 2 egg whites and after cooking on the stove, I also put into the oven for 8 minutes (combo of baking then broiling) and just loved it!  You can do so much with this one and will continue to enjoy many more times!

I'm so glad I ran across this recipe, it was the perfect brunch item today.  Not having small potatoes on hand, I substituted a large yam - it worked perfectly!  So much so, I'm going to keep the change and make it permanent. DELICIOUS.

I made this frittata for supper last night and we really enjoyed it.  I did make some minor changes though; instead of using red potatoes, I used white (diced them instead of slicing), I used shallot instead of green onion; for added richness I used 10% cream instead of milk (an unnecessary substitution as it turns out).  The only change I made was to use about 1/2 box of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh.  The meal came together very quickly without a lot of fuss and in the end it was very tasty.

Easy and elegant!  I tried this after having a frittata in a nice Italian restaurant.  I substituted diced green peppers and added chopped tomatoes, but will use  spinach and potatoes (and mushrooms) next time.  The restaurant served herbed hollandaise over the frittata, which would also be a good idea. Endless variations possible.

This recipe is really great, but as some other reviews stated, I believe it's a good starter recipe. I replaced milk with fat free half & half and adding a lot more garlic and sesaoning. I think mushrooms would be a great addition.

As other reviewers have written, this is a decent starter recipe.  This needed a lot of extra seasoning as well as additional sautéed vegetables.  Although this was easy to make, there are several other frittata recipes on this site we enjoyed more.

This frittata was easy to make and really good. The changes I made were to substitute garlic powder for the crushed garlic and Italian cheese blend instead of the cheddar.

This makes for a great light meal. I added a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms and subbed a half a bag of diced 'ready potatoes with onions' and swiss for the cheddar.  It was awesome.  Used four eggs because it was only two of us and still had enough for lunch the next day.

i should have read the reviews BEFORE making this recipe but i was in a rush.  next time i will try seasoning potatoes while they're cooking as they were a bit bland.  the amount of "small" potatoes i purchased was more for a LARGE sized skillet.  i also substituted vegetable oil and a cheddar blend cheese.  added more garlic salt, garlic and spinach. i sprinkled cold diced fresh tomatoes on some of it also - it was refreshing.  this recipe is not great but pretty good.  i will try to make it again seasoning potatoes as they cook.  thank you for sharing this recipe - my first time tasting a frittata!  i will certainly make more as they are very quick and easy to make.

A very good dish that I used as a side dish for a ham dinner. Since I cook for two sometimes three the left overs  will be greatly appreciated. A keeper for sure.

This tasted great - I substituted frozen for fresh spinach and yellow for green onion.  Next time I think I will cook for a few minutes and flip the frittata before adding the cheese.

I added seasonings to the potatoes as many recommended, doubled the spinach, and finished it in the oven as many recommended. The potatoes were still not done (I did not know what "tender but firm" meant, clearly.)

Searched it up to use an abundance of spinach we had on hand. Probably won't make it again.

The leftovers were better with adding sharp cheddar and green taco sauce.

This recipe is an excellent base but I do agree with other reviews. It needs to be seasoned a little more aggressively. I had leftover roasted red potatoes in the fridge so I sliced those and put a light golden brown on them with bacon fat. I added 1/4 of an onion, sautéed, and doubled the spinach. I layered with white cheddar and seasoned each layer with garlic and seasoned salt and additional black pepper. Topped with sour cream and served with a toasted baguette. I did stove-top it until semi-set and finished in the oven at 400 degrees F for about 6 minutes. Broiled for an additional minute. Will keep this recipe handy.

This recipe is very good as is. I had a little potato lying around and a remnant of frozen hash browns (the cubed type), so I decided to give it a try. It came out very well and I think it will be perfect for a light dinner or a good brunch.

Excellent breakfast or dinner entree!  Lighter than we anticipated.  We used baby spinach because that was what we already had on hand, and did not get much of a spinach taste.  Next time we will use regular spinach.  Might try mushrooms, as well...

This is a good vegetarian dish. I made it exactly as printed and it was enjoyed by both my son and me. One of my family members does not like spinach (imagine that!) so I'll make it with cooked broccoli and maybe add sliced mushrooms, too. An egg or two extra may be required. I think I'll make it again soon.

Good Base recipe.  As another reviewer stated, if you don't season the potatoes while they cook, they come out bland.  I seasoned with garlic powder, turmeric, nutmeg and black/white and red pepper.   Added bacon and allowed pototoes to cook in bacon fat.   Only used two Idaho potatoes instead of six.  I cooked it on the stove in a cast iron skillet till the edges turned lighter, then put into a stove  at 425 degrees for ten minutes.  Delicious!

I  just made this for dinner because I forgot to take anything out of the freezer.  I did make some substitutions and used this as a base recipe.  I didn't have red potatoes so I substituted russet and my green onions had gone to God, so I used sliced sweet onions.  I had cheddar cheese, but I figured I'd try goat cheese with sun dried tomatoes.  WOW!  My husband cleaned his plate and is looking forward to leftovers for breakfast.

It was my first time making a frittata.  I burned the potatoes due to my own negligence but was still pretty good.  I did use a large skillet instead of a medium after reading some of the comments on this recipe; I think medium would have been better.

Made once as is.  Bland and too basic.  Made 5 star offerings many times since.  SEASON those potatoes and use your imagination for the mix-ins.  I have added smoked salmon with spinach and dill..delish !!!   Once used crabmeat I had bought to make another dish, a dip that did not get made....also delish.  OF COURSE  any veg almost will work as well as ham, chicken or leftover roast meats if you want it as a full meal to please most men.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the recipe, as written, needed modifications. As other reviewers pointed out, the potatoes were very bland, to combat this, I used some restaurant seasoning from a local burger place. This is an awesome vegetarian dish, but I live in a house of carnivores so we had to add meat. I added some deli ham and some cooked, chopped bacon just before adding the spinach. The 4 star review was from the as written recipe, the slight modification of seasoning on the potatoes made it a 5 star dish. The addition of meat made it a dish my family wants again.

Required a large skillet. For a regular pan, use more oil then indicated and stir potatoes for even cooking and so they don't stick. Could also use more spinach and more cheese. Found that it took more time to cook than noted, and had to also put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to finish.
Add herbs and/or spices for more flavor and serve with Sriracha if you like it extra spicy!

My Grandmother and 97 year old Mom always made this dish on Fridays when we couldn't have meat.   I use this recipe and throw in whatever I happen to have in the house in the way of vegetables and always add a generous helping of parmesan cheese.   Being Italian, I feel parmesan cheese just adds flavor to everything!  I like the potatoes on the crispier side too.   I only use onion powder because I don't like onion.  No one seems to notice the lack of onion but everyone compliments the frittata.  It's good hot or cold and healthy too!

I followed the recipe and added a quarter diced tomato, however the bottom of the frittata got burnt in the skillet. What is the trick to not getting the bottom burnt? to not cover it? or to flip it halfway?

Im only rating this four stars because I made adjustments and think it would have been bland otherwise.  My son, who is often picky, and my husband, who eats anything, both liked it.  I added a little chorizo sausage and mushroom to the mix, I used an italian cheese blend, and I added basil at the end.  Definitely use the basil if you like it.  I got that suggestion from a prior review.

I have made this a few times now and it turns out really good every time. Not sure if it is because I live at high altitude or what but I do have to finish this in the oven, 10 minutes or so at 350 degrees and it is perfectly fluffy and delicious...I know it is done when the center has risen and the edges have pulled away from the side of the pan. It is really easy to modify this recipe and add whatever veggies or cheese you have handy.

It was good. I added spices and flavored olive oil. I regret  not cutting slices in half but the men liked it. They added additional  seasonings like sriracha and salsa...even canned chicken which I meant to add.

This easily made it's way to being a staple dish in our home. We added in chopped mushrooms and also seasoned the potatoes prior to adding the spinach mixture. It's been said countless times before but I have to repeat that the possibilities are endless using this a simple base.

I used almond milk instead of regular milk, chives instead of green onions, and garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. I also added paprika and Italian seasoning. It's very yummy!

I pretty much followed the recipe other than adding some seasoning to the potatoes while they cooked (as suggested by other reviewers).  I needed to finish the dish off in the oven as I had a hard time getting the top center of the eggs done.  It was pretty good, but I was not 'overwhelmed'.  Still ended up more bland than I was expecting.  Maybe next time more garlic and onion, or maybe use leeks instead of the green onion.

First time followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Second time I increased the spinach slightly and added halved grape tomatoes flat against the pan, prior to pouring egg mixture, to add a little color and interest.  I am not an accomplished cook, but this has worked perfectly twice. 
Great recipe.

I increased the proportions and put it in a 10" skillet - took forever to set.  Next time I will probably put it in a medium casserole dish and bake it.

So easy and quick to make.   My changes were to add three times the spinach, use different cheese (because we can!) and cut out the milk (useless for this recipe).  My kids loved it.  There were no leftovers and many requests to make it again.  We served it as a side dish, but it could easily have been the main dish.  This is such a great basic recipe as is, but you can make it personal with just a few additions.    Bacon, ham, fresh herbs, tomatoes and mushrooms are just a few things I'd like to try (a few at a time of course).  Thanks for such a super fun recipe!

I like the dish and rated 5 stars, but I would correct the recipe a little bit. Next time I wouldn't hesitate to double the spinach. And also I think it wouldn't hurt to season potatoes with Italian spices mix.

It's such a great recipe. I did season the potatoes with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, cayenne & lots of s&p. (Saw someone else did this). I have added sliced tomato on top & made it without milk & cheese. All versions tasted good :)

Used zucchini and green beans instead of spinach as I didn't have any and 4 eggs (as I don't like things too egg-y). Hubby loved it and I liked it, but it definitely needed more spice.

I had never made a frittata before. I tried scaling the recipe down to 4 servings, and put it in a smaller pan. However, there was still a lot of filling, so it took twice as long to cook because it was too deep in the pan, and meanwhile the bottom burned. Next time I will use the larger pan even with fewer portions.
I also used a reviewer's suggestion of seasoning the potatoes, but then forgot to add salt later on, so the rest of the frittata needed salt after I had served it. Overall though, the hubby requested I make it again, just without the burnt "crust" on the bottom. :)

This was just ok.  My stove must run high.  After a couple mins on medium heat some of my potatoes were burnt, so I had to turn it to a medium low.  As others stated, this will not be done in 5-7 mins, especially not on low.  I had turned the oven to 350 to preheat, and the eggs were not done by that time.  I put the skillet into the oven and baked it for about 18 mins, perfect.  Not sure if I would make this one in particular again, but it is a good starting base.

I made this for Mother's Day. My mom said that she liked it ( I didn't try it, I don't like eggs ) the reason why I gave it a four star rating was because the eggs did not cook in 5 to 7 minutes, it took about 20! I think the only reason that the potatoes were not raw was because of the time it took to cook the eggs. By the time it was done my mom was already up, so it could not be a suprise breakfast like I had planned. I will only make this again if my mom BEGS me to.

This is a great, versatile recipe. You can use any of your favorite veggies and cheeses. The only thing I did differently was to throw it in the oven to finish up cooking the egg mixture and brown the top slightly.

Great recipe base. I made it as written today. It was very good. I will definitely be making this again but I think next time I'll add a cup of broccoli, skip the cheese, decrease the potato, decrease the oil (just my own personal preference). This was my first frittata and definitely not my last. Thanks for teaching me how to make it!

I've made this a few times now, always to great reviews. I recommend trying it with jalapeno cheese as opposed to regular cheddar, and mushrooms mixed in.

Delicious!  I added some Lawry salt when cooking the potatoes and omitted the salt and pepper.  It took a little longer to cook than the recipes states, but it was really delicious.

I didn't find this dish interesting enough to make again. The flavor was a bit bland, and it should have called for enough spinach to warrant calling this a Spinach and Potato Frittata.

This recipe did not turn out like I thought it would. The frittata was bland and too potatoey. My family had a hard time eating it. If I ever make this again, I will be slicing the potatoes thinner and maybe adding a few more seasonings.

To my amazement, the kids all had seconds, and even my husband (who is not a big fan of eggs) liked it. It was so easy and tasty. I just eyeballed the measurements and it still came out great.

I make this all the time, great! I cheat and use refrigerated hash browns for a really quick version. I also place the pan in the Broiler for few minutes to toast the cheese.

The taste really was good after adding some Italian seasoning, salt/pepper, and some parmesan/romano cheese (all I had).  This gets a 3 instead of a 4 because there is no way this takes 5-7 minutes for eggs to set.  I put a lid on the pan and mine were still runny...I got fed up, turned them over, and discovered burnt eggs on the bottom.  If I make this again, I will transfer the skillet to a preheated oven.

I'd never made frittatas before, but tried this out based on the ingredients I had on hand.  It was delicious and incredibly easy and my overnight guests were very impressed!  I've made it several times since, using potatoes as the base and then whatever leftovers veggies I have on hand.  Perfect clean-out-the-fridge dish!

Quick, easy, and YUM! I used refrigerated hashbrown potatoes instead of the reds, and garlic powder instead of fresh crushed garlic. Great by itself, but also good in a tortilla with sausage and salsa. Thanks for the recipe!

I attempted to follow the recipe here, but quickly found out that six potatoes is too many, as is six eggs.  This is an easily adapted recipe though, and after making various substitutions and changes, it came out decent enough.  If you have left overs, refrigerate them as soon as you can, and it's easily reheated.  Great with horseradish or Sriracha's, because the original recipe is a little bland on taste.

This was so yummy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spinach, added a little more cheese and seasoned the potatoes while cooking them.  I also added some turkey bacon to it.  I have an electric stove and in order to get the eggs to cook I had to turn the heat up to med low rather than low.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good. I only gave it 4 stars bc I modified it slightly based on ingredients that I had- I used potato, onion and tomato from my CSA box and then used leftover asparagus instead of the spinach. Myu husband had 3 helpings and my 2 year old cleaned his plate. Bottom line is that this recipe is extremely versatile and really delicious- we will make this again.

Yummy! I used it as a guide as I do with most recipes.  Used what I had on hand; replaced spinach with asparagus (less), red onion for green, parm, ched, & muenster cheeses t.out/ atop, sliced tomatoes with basil on very top.  Reduced recipe to fit my saucepan.  Overall good idea:)  Took closer to 15 min to cook after adding eggs.

After it took much longer to cook than expected (per usual with my stove), I found the egg flavor to be overpowering and maybe not enough spinach flavor, but more likely just the right amount of spinach and too little spice. Like pepper or Comino. Couldn't taste the green onions. Very easy to add too much cheese.

This was great!  I only used about 3 red potatoes and added garlic powder, onion powder and diced tomatoes.  I used another reviewer's advice and heated on the stove and oven and it was perfect!  Next time I will add a little more salt but besides that it was wonderful!

Great basic, so to speak, palette for adding other items. I added thinly sliced, then diced ham, broccoli, onions, green bell pepper and garlic powder to the potatoes. Let them cook, then added cheddar and monterey jack, salt & pepper to the eggs. We always add some sour cream on the side with our frittata's. HOME RUN!!!!

Potatoes are plain, so next time I'm going to use other people's advice and mix them in olive oil/spice mix before putting in the skillet.  I doubled the spinach, threw in some sundried tomatoes and used goat cheese as well.  Fool-proof recipe and I can't wait to try other versions!

Wonderful recipe. A few modifications: 1. I used Yukon Gold Potatoes because I like them better... and I used 4 instead of 6 based on what others had said about too many potatoes. The end ratio was great. 2. I doubled the spinach and added a bit more green onion 3. I put both cheddar and monteray jack cheese on top. Yum! 4. I served with fresh tomatoes as a topping.  Delicious, easy and cheap. The triple winner! Leftovers are great too.

This was a good recipe and delicious. You may need to add extra time for cooking, and more seasoning for more taste.  I used additional cheese in this recipes also.

This was great.  I threw a small, diced onion in with the potatoes, omitted the green onions and used 8 eggs instead of 6.  Easy to put together and tasted great - make sure you remember to season with salt & pepper!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was too much garlic for my taste (and I love garlic!) and it took WAY longer than 5-7 minutes. I will make again but put less garlic and will not expect it to only take 20 minutes to cook!

My husband and I loved this!  I did season the potatoes with plenty of salt and pepper while they were cooking, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  This is definitely going into our "Meatless Monday" rotation.

YUM, YUM, YUMMMMM!!!!!!!  My meat-loving teenage son declared this to be the best vegetarian meal that he’s ever eaten!  (I altered it a bit to match what I had, added zucchini and mushrooms and some mozzarella cheese in addition to cheddar).  YUMMY!!!!

My family loved this frittata! I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese. I popped it in the oven to broil the top to get the cheese bubbly and browned.

I've made this a handful of times now, great recipe.

This was very good.  Only varied by adding some tomatoes and thyme.  Next time I would add some mushrooms as well.  Will make again.

This was really good.  Instead of red potatoes I used frozen hashbrowns because it's what I had.  I used more spinach because I didn't want leftover raw spinach in the fridge.  I used egg beaters to cut some calories as well as 2% cheese (but a little more of it).  =)

This recipe is not great and my family decided that we like other frittatas better.  However, I liked it better than some others that we have made.  Served with toast and cinnamon apple sauce.

Delicious! I made this for dinner adding a few pieces of crumbled bacon..yum! The left overs were perfect for breakfast! I cooked mine a little longer than the five-seven mins noted, but you be the judge. Excellent dish!

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I could eat this all the time, breakfast, lunch or dinner.  My husband also said this and raved about it.  It is so easy doing it all in one pan too!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Oh, and the only changes I made was using half the potatoes (because I seen it recommended on here), and I added Mrs.Dash herb and onion spice mix. I wouldn't be afraid to try it all, and probably double the spinach.

read your recipe and happened to have all the ingredients so gave it a try--very, very good!  i used a carton of egg product instead of the eggs and milk, and added  tomato, basil and rosemary from the garden--i found out i didn't have grated cheddar so i used lots of parmasan instead--if i make it again i will do the parmasan again--

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  It's very easy to follow.  The only problem I had was I doubled the cheese and when the frittata was done I had a pool of cheese in the middle of the frittata.  I let it sit for about five minutes and it was perfect.  It heats up great the next day!

I followed this recipe exactly except I added more spinach and a few tomato slices on top - it came out perfectly!! This one has moved into our favorites list.  I'm going to add asparagus next time - can't wait!

Recipe was very good and very easy to make. I used rice milk instead of cow's milk along with no cheese and it tasted great. My husband isn't a big fan of eggs and he even liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

Mine looked nothing like the picture! I added extra garlic, salt, and pepper, but still found mine to be bland. Also, like comments have said, the egg didn't cook throughout before the bottom burned, so I would suggest starting this in an oven-safe skillet and transferring it to the oven to finish off the egg. 
My husband loved this, but I thought it was only OK. I put some fresh salsa on a couple bites and that really helped the flavor. My husband loved his with Tabasco sauce on it.

Good breakfast or brunch dish. Even better with goat cheese or feta cheese. My frittata didn't completely cook in the pan, so I put under the broiler for 2 minutes to fisnish it.

Big Hit and easy to do - the 2 things every cook wants!  I'm giving 4 stars because of the changes I made, but I'm sure doing it "pure" would rate 5 stars.  I used tater tots instead of fresh potatoes -just to get rid of them- and sharp cheddar cheese.  I skipped the usual S&P to taste and instead used dashes of dry mustard, celery seed, thyme and white pepper.  One suggestion I would make: the time just was not long enough for me, and afterwards a friend of mine said that if you cook it until it gets that filmy look on the top and the sides are done - put it under the broiler for a minute or so which gets the top cooked.  She makes frittatas all the time, and this is what she does.  My husband not only had 2nds last night but asked this morning if there was leftovers!

I can't believe how fast and easy this was to prepare.  It was very, very good but I know it can be even better if I tinker with the ingredients a bit.  (More salt with the potatoes, more garlic, maybe some regular onion instead of green onion.)  My whole family loved it!  Definitely something I will make again and again.

Pretty fast and easy to make. I made with egg substitute so it turned out to be more like an omelet rather than a frittata; recommend using at least 1/3 of your recipe with real eggs to hold it together.

LOVED it!  I have made it twice already.  You can definitely add more spinach, more green onion and more garlic if you like.  I used O'Brien potatoes from the freezer to save some time.  This was a delicious breakfast when I had guests though we all agreed it could use a little meat in it.  The second time I made it, I made it for my bf who has high cholesterol but I didn't want to lose out on yummy Sunday morning breakfast - so I used egg beaters and veggie breakfast sausage.  I used four patties of morningstar, chopped up, which was a little too much, but it was also delish!  YUM.  Try it, you'll like it.  :)

This was my first frittata recipe. I really like the combination of ingredients listed here and thought it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but the potatoes were not cooked fully when the rest of the frittata was set. I will make this again but I plan on decreasing the amount of potatoes and increasing the eggs. Also, I might try blanching the potatoes first to make sure they're cooked through.

This recipe was great and easy. I still need to practice because the top was still runny as the bottom was becoming very golden. In order not to burn the bottom, I quickly flipped the frittata to cook the top.

If I could give this recipe a 4.6, I would.  I used chopped vidalia onions and added them and the garlic to the potatoes when the potatoes were about 1/2 way done.  Also doubled the spinach.  Had to put under the broiler to finish the eggs off.  Topped with an additional 1/2 c. mozarella, cooked bacon pieces, sliced tomatoes. I also added basil pesto. Served with sour cream on the side.  Very "tuscan".  Light and delicious.  I look forward to adding different things next time - maybe cooked italian sausage, mushrooms and fire roasted red peppers.

This is not bad.  But potatoes take much much longer than 10 minutes to cook for me, so I just planned on them taking 20-30 min.  And they did.  I thought about baking in the microwave for a few min, but I didn't.  I didn't really like the combo of spinach and potatoes, but I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like wilted spinach much.  I love it raw and in baked goods, but not this way.  But I can see myself liking this with broccoli or something else, so that's no reason to dock the recipe.  Instead of cooking the frittata covered, I popped it in a 375 degree oven for about 15 min to firm up the egg.  Worked beautifully in my oven safe skillet.  Thanks!

Very good, hearty frittata. I added a little bacon and more garlic than the recipe calls for. I had to cook it several minutes longer than the time indicated to get the eggs to set.

Thank you for sharing such a great recipe Cheryl.  This recipe is easy to modify to your personal taste or for whatever veggies you have on hand.  I added tons of garlic and some fresh oregano.  I also used half egg whites and half whole eggs.  It was delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe over and over.  Next time I will probably add tomatoes and fresh basil or rosemary.  Yummy!  Thanks again.

Good base recipe. Like other reviewers, I finished under the broiler. I don't like my eggs even slightly moist so I always finish frittatas this way. Make sure to stir the potatoes while cooking, else they burn.

I didn't have to broil. I cooked the frittta COVERED for around 7 minutes which made sure the top was cooked. The next time I will mix the cheese into the egg mixture in addition to scattering on top.

This was so good! I did it almost exactly like the original recipe except I took some others advice and put it under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end. I made two mini frittatas since I knew my husband would not want to add tomatoes in his but I did. I'll make this one again and again!

I liked this, although I think I went a little heavy with the potatoes.
I put this under the broiler for a few minutes to finish cooking the egg on top, and give it a nice golden-brown colour.

This recipe is very quick and easy to prepare, but is also very tasty. My husband and I loved it. The only thing I would recommend is serving it with a small dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche since that flavor pairs so nicely with the potatoes in this dish. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was really good and easy to make.  I used 1-1/2 regular sized red potatoes.  I needed about 12 mins. to cook the egg and they were still a tad runny on top.  I think next time I would take a previous reviewer's suggestion and broil the dish for a min. or two to finish off the top.  I served with a dab of sour cream.  Fresh cut tomatoes on top would be great, too.  Thanks!

This was a very easy and tasty dish! I followed the recipe pretty closely but  instead of just cheddar I also added a formaggi cheese mix and also added some crumbled feta before serving. Yum Yum! I think I'll try adding some pancetta and maybe some grape tomatoes next time. The variations are endless!

Really good!  I'm a bit lactose intolerant, so I replaced the milk with soy milk, and the cheese with a tablespoon of ranch dressing mixed in with the egg and milk, and it was excellent.  I made sure some of the potatoes got nice and brown and crispy before adding in other ingredients, and also added a zucchini in with the spinach.  Delish!

This was pretty good.  The potato layer was a little bland, but it perked up with additional salt and pepper, a lot of salt and pepper.  :o)

This recipe was really very good!  It was simular to my fried potatoes, however, a little different.  I added a few red pepper flakes and some green pepper.  We love cheese on potaotes so we put extra. Like the whole package!! I served this as part of my Sunday dinner and everyone loved it!

I took other reviewers advice with this and seasoned the potatoes with salt and black pepper whilst cooking. I only used 3 potatoes and more spinach. I finished it off by putting it under the broiler for 5 minutes. This made a great lunch for me and my oldest daughter with slices of Country Seed Bread from this site. I'll definitely make this again. Many Thanks.

I made this in a saucepan instead of a skillet since I didn't have any skillet lids. My boyfriend and I both really liked it and he's rather hard to please. And cooking potatoes in a covered saucepan like that was an epiphany, much easier than frying and they taste just as good. A winner of  a recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I did make some modifications though. I used purple, red, and gold potatoes (a mix from Trader Joe's). I thought the amount of potatoes the recipe called for was too much (I recommend using only half) and the spinach should be doubled. Next time, I'll add cooked mushrooms and tomatoes.

This is a pretty good, healthy, easy to make, and your kids will eat it recipe.  I added bacon bits while cooking the potatoes, it added some meaty flavor to the potatoes as they do need some extra flavoring.

This was a great starter recipe.  I added some more seasonings to my potatoes (seasoning salt, more garlic, pepper) and I think that really made the difference.  I ended up transferring the frittata to a plate to flip it over in the pan to set the top.  It all stayed together and worked quite nicely.  My boyfriend came home from a business trip and is loving the leftovers!

Eating this right now.  It's pretty good.  I had to make a couple changes to the recipe, though.  I used 2 regular Idaho potatoes and cut them up in pieces; I don't have red potatoes on hand.  I also had to use canned milk because I ran out of regular and soy milk.  I also had to use mozzarella cheese because that's all I have for now.  I also used red onion because I didn't have green onions. I had to allow the whole mixture to cook a little longer because at the end of 7 minutes the eggs weren't fully cooked.  It browned the bottom of the frittata some but it's still good.  (Can't eat not-fully-cooked eggs now, not healthy.)

Overall though, tastes good.  :)

Very tasty and quick -- a practical recipe for a fancy-but-quick breakfast/lunch. I used goats milk  and coconut oil for health reasons. I also increased the amount of spinach. Great recipe!

great twist for the ho-hum scrambled eggs.  i subbed shallots for the onion and added a pinch of nutmeg.  i also put under the broiler for 2 minutes to brown the top a bit.  it even slide out of the pan as it should! nice.

This is delicious! I used white potatoes instead of red and I was delighted with the results. Thanks for a great recipe!
