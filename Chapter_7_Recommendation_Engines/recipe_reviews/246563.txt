This was very tasty... the broth had a really nice flavor.  I didnt think it would with such few ingredients.. nice surprise.  The reason I am marking one star off is the cooking method. I think it is overly complicated. Saute the veggies in  a stock pot, add the rest  of the ingredients, except flour and noodles.   cook until desired tenderness of veggies. Mix the flour with some water and temper it with the stock.. add it to the soup to thicken... no need for the oil  or cooking the veggie separately.  I do think keeping noddles separate is a good idea as leftover noodles in the soup would soak up the broth and make them mushy

Loved the recipe. I couldnâ€™t find curry powder so I used curry paste. It turned out fine. I also used honey instead of maple syrup and I was happy with the results.

It wasn't horrible and I tried to like it, but there was too much going wrong for my taste. I didn't care for the thickness of the broth. It was more like gravy. The soy sauce overpowered the curry and I couldn't taste any curry at all The carrots  seemed to clash with the noodles. I  did add spinach, tofu, and mushrooms but that didn't seem to go well with the broth either. I may try to tweak this  to my taste but I won't make it this way again.

Honestly, one of the best recipes I have found so far! Really easy and fast to make, still have left over ingredients so I will definitely be making this again, also red curry paste seemed to work pretty good with mine! Alittle expensive for my college budget, but totally worth it.
