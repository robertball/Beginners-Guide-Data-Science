Normally I am somewhat leery of recipes which are given by food manufacturers because I think it is often a means of selling their products. But this recipe was actually quite good and easy to make. The only thing I did different from the directions was to cook it for about an extra five minutes because I wanted the mac and cheese to be a little crunchy around the edges. When I make it again I think I will shred a little parmesan under the tots. The cauliflower Veggie Tots were quite good and I look forward to making them as a side for burgers or brats.

So wanted this to be good but ........ not so.   I followed the recipe as stated which is rare for me and grandkids, parents and grandparents gave it a serious thumbs down.  The mac and cheese had a gritty texture and the veggie cauliflower tots were disappointing.  I have a  great recipe for mac n cheese with tator tots which I will continue to make.

Darn the flour didn t incorporate into the milk properly. The Mac and Cheese wasn t edible. The broccoli tots were YUMMY!
