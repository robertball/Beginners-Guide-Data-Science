This recipe, like most, is not going to suit everyone's taste as written. But it is a good basic recipe and a good place to start. Remember that you can always add more of one ingredient, but "removing" means adding more of every other ingredient.
My thoughts:
1. notice the recipe starts with 2 cups of beans, not 2 cans (garbanzo beans are also called: chick peas or ceci beans
2. drain and retain all the bean juice as you will want to add it later to get the texture to your liking (water will also work)
3. tahini can vary in intensity, I recommend starting with about 3 TBSP and working up or down from there (Tahini can be identified by its bitter taste)
4. start with 1 OZ of lemon juice and work up if you like your hummus more sour
5. it’s always best to add salt towards the end because some beans have salt in the juice
6. garlic- what can I say about garlic- some people will say 1 clove, some people will say 12 cloves (I use 3-4 depending on size)
7. olive oil is traditionally served on top, I blend 1TBSP in and pour more on top- olive oil is a "good oil" so don't worry about adding it
8. paprika is traditional on top but won't add much heat, if you want some kick, blend in cayenne, jalapeños, or crushed red pepper (I use 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes)
9. I consider cumin a necessity (start with 1/4 tsp and work up from there, I like 1 tsp)
10. have fun- try adding roasted garlic, chives, scallions, roasted red peppers, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, or feta cheese

My husband and I are arabic so we eat a lot of hummus and after making this recipe we agreed it is absolutely easier to make it then to get in our car and drive to the restaurant and carry it out. However, we needed to make a couple of minor changes to get to this point. We used 2- 15 1/2 oz cans of garbanzo beans. We thought it was a bit too much tahini so we used slighty under 1/3 cup. We added an extra clove of garlic (at least).  We also added red pepper which is a staple ingredient in hummus so I was surprised it was ommited (not a lot- maybe a teaspoon or so).  We also agreed with other reviewers that you need some of the chick pea juice to thin it out just a bit.  We used 3/4 of a can of juice from one can of the chick peas.  My mother in law tells me that if you peel the chick peas (which is supposed to be fast and easy) it will come out better too- I don't think I will do this though because it tasted great just like this.  We also used a little more lemon than the recipe called for - it just depends on your taste.

Lots to read on this one! Here's a review of the reviews. Use fresh lemon juice. Save bean liquid if thinning necessary. Some like less Tahini - 2T works. Cumin, tobasco or red pepper adds flavor. Roasting the garlic mellows it. Some add more cloves. Make it the night before serving so all the flavors meld. Indian or pita bread brushed w/olive oil, topped w/parmesan cheese, toasted in the oven and cut in wedges works well for dipping as does bagel and other chips, or crackers. Tahini can be hard to find - some grocers carry it on the peanut butter aisle. I go to a fun health food store called Manna Mills that carries it. Hummus is heart healthy and earth friendly. I disliked chickpeas as a child & recently learned to enjoy them (read the classic 'The Yearling').

Been making Hummus for 35 years.  This is THE recipe!  I've made gallons of this one, and lived next door to a Lebanese family in Georgia recently, the Dad a restaurant owner, who live on Hummus... and mine (this one) kicked butt!  Add 1/4 to 1/2 C roasted red peppers to the mix for color and flavor to die for.  Forget the blender.  If a blender works, it's too thin.  A big, heavy duty Quisinart will save hours!
Another tip:  Fill muffin tins, then freeze them, then put the Hummus portions in a bag in the freezer.  One cake, thawed, warmed a little, with 2 T Premium olive oil, sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with warmed pita bread is the way to go.  SOOooooo good for you!!

This is wonderful! Tastes better than the hummus I get at the local deli. Stick with 2tbsp tahini, as others have recommended. I added three cloves of garlic (next time I'll add four), a pinch of chili pepper flakes, cumin and dried parsley. This is so good, you'll have to force yourself to put it down!

This is the first time I have ever made hummus....this is delicious!! I dont think I will ever buy store bought again. Easy recipe and very tasty. I used fresh lemon juice instead of bottled...which I think makes a difference. Served with toasted pita wedges and blue tortilla chips. I loved this recipe....thanks Rhoda for a tasty dip! Quick note...I did have a problem finding tahini, searched several food stores....and I found it in the peanut butter aisle of my grocery store.

Every person who tried this at a gathering loved it, and most of them hate garbanzo beans.  They were surprised to find out this fantastic stuff was made with them! I used more garlic than called for, but roasted the garlic first.  Instead of thinning it with the juice from the beans, I used yogurt, so it would come out a bit creamier.

I'm a hummus fanatic and this is one of the best I've found. It's now a regular around our kitchen. The only thing I do differently is to use roasted minced garlic from a jar and add 1/2 t. of cumin. Reserve the liquid from the garbanzo beans and add a little to the puree if it seems to be too thick. Pair this with Peppy's Pita Bread and you can't go wrong!

Hey Great recipe. A little hard to do in a blender though. Be sure to keep some of the liquid from the chick peas, because it gets a little thick. Also if you want the smell and taste of the hummus you eat at one of those restaraunts add about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cummin. and enjoy!!!

Excellent recipe!  I have been making this recipe for a while and haven't changed much.  I add a couple extra tablespoons of lemon and an extra clove or two of garlic.  I make my own tahini.  It is very simple:  Spread out 2 cups of raw sesame seeds on a baking pan.  Bake them at 350 for 8 to 10 min, or until golden brown, stirring after 4 min.  Then put in a food processor with 1/2 cup of olive oil for 2 minutes.  That's it, but the flavor difference is noticeable when you make the tahini yourself!  (You will have left over tahini, and it stores well in the fridge easily for a month.  Just stir it up before you use in recipes.)

Oh my gosh!  How excited am I to have found this recipe!?  This hummus is amazingly good!!  :)  A word of advice to those who are looking for a good hummus recipe:  I've tried the recipes that don't call for tahini (because I was too lazy to go buy some) but they don't even come CLOSE to tasting like hummus, and are actually quite nasty.  It's a must-have ingredient!!  Although I used more beans than called for (two CANS, rather than cups) I still only used 1/3 c tahini and 1 tsp salt, but added slightly more lemon than was called for (appx 2-3 T more).  I also added closer to 6 cloves of garlic, and may even use more than that next time.  The garlic and lemon are my favorite parts!!  (Lemon makes the hummus tangy - not sour or citrus-y).  I added 1/4 tsp each of cumin and red pepper, as suggested by others.  I just eye balled the olive oil, parsley, and paprika.  AMAZING!  I followed the suggestion of one reviewer by freezing individual-sized portions in a muffin tin (after frozen, dip the pan in warm water and wrap each individually).  I also buy a bunch of pitas and freeze those with a sheet of wax paper in between each (so they aren't frozen together and come apart easily for a quick snack).  When you need a snack, pop one of each in the microwave for a few seconds, and you've got a DELICIOUS, healthy snack - and the best part it, it keeps (virtually) forever!

You'll never buy hummus again after making this in your food processor.  I used fresh lemon juice and slightly more garlic than called for and it was perfect.  I garnished with cilantro rather than parsley.  A tip from a Syrian friend was to wash away the transparent hulls from the garbanzo beans to reduce the bitter taste and improve the texture.

excellent combination of ingredients but missing 2 important things:

cook the garbanzo beans with about 1/4 tsp of baking soda for about 30 minutes before processing.

The mixture will be smoother and creamier

This recipe is easy and absolutely delicious--you will flip!  After reading several reviews, here is what went into the food processor:  measure out the 2 cups of beans AFTER draining the cans; 3-4 tablespoons of tahini sauce (it came in a tall jar and poured), ¼ cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice, 3 freshly-minced garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 tablespoons plain yogurt, ¼-½ teaspoon EACH-->ground cumin, sea salt, paprika, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Reviews from my two daughters--one an experienced hummus-maker, and the other a hummus-lover--were enthusiastic and glowing.  For optimum flavor, be sure to make this the day before you plan to eat it.  Thank you to Rhoda for a marvelous recipe to work with!

Perfectly delicious.  The best hummus I've had outside of Israel.  Their street vendors have a perfect recipe that tastes essentially exactly like this one.  I made two modifications to Rhoda's recipe.  Doubled the garlic and for the paprika, I chose a hot variety to give it a nice kick.  Serve with toasted pita chips.  ADDENDUM:  This hummus is so healthy to eat.  For breakfast, I've taken to spreading some on toasted bread.  Just an idea on how to get more non animal protein into your diet!

My family loves this. My mother-in-law is from Egypt, so under her guidance I did adjust a little; 2-3 tablespoons tahini, 1/8 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2-3 tablespoons garbanzo bean juice, cumin & red pepper to taste. Perfect everytime, awesome!!!!

I have been meking this WONDERFUL recipe for years! Try heating the garbanzo beans with the liquid in a saucepan - it makes it smoother when you put it in the food processer. Also add a little of the juice. If you are like me and love lemon -add as much as you like. Great with fresh mint!!!!

Phenomonal! I added a teaspoon of sugar. And made my own tahini from husked sesame seeds. So easy to do! Just toasted them a little then added a little olive oil then blended them in food processor.

My husband and I eat hummus on a daily basis (and now I make hummus on a daily basis!), but we moved to an area where the only hummus available is the prepackaged stuff at the store (which is really not hummus, it's pretty gross).  So I decided to learn to make my own.  As always, I tried this recipe as written first.  We found the proportions to be a bit off (and a bit bland) compared to the hummus at our favorite Greek restaurant.  The changes I made are: increase tahini to 1 cup (the owner of said Greek restaurant told me you always want to have a 2:1 ratio of garbanzos to tahini), increase the paprika to at least 1-2 tsp and mix it into the hummus, not on top (same with the olive oil), decrease lemon juice to the juice of one half a medium sized lemon, left off the parsley because I don't usually have any in the house, kept the juice from the beans to thin out the hummus as needed (it shouldn't be a thick glob, it should be smooth and creamy), and the salt is optional, I usually don't put it in that way each person has the choice (that's standard practice for me as many of my relatives have dietary restrictions) I also purchased tahini and olive oil imported from Israel (on www.israeliproducts.com) because the taste is so much better. I also always process the garlic by itself first, otherwise, you'll have chucnks of garlic.  Make sure you let the whole thing process for at least a couple minutes, you can't really over mix it, so let it go.  Overall, this recipe is a good

It is amazing that something this good can be so nutritious! It also looks so beautiful and rich on the table. I cover it with foil and leave it to warm in the oven on the lowest heat possible while I cook dinner, then drizzle the olive oil before serving. I found that the lemon flavor was too strong for me, it overpowered the delicate flavor of the garbanzo beans. This was really good regardless. The second time I made it I adjusted it to my taste, I omitted the parsley, added 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, halfed the amount of lemon juice, and a bit of "bean juice" to thin it out a little (since my processor is cheap, it doesn't get the mixture as smooth as I'd like without the extra liquid), I also used 4 cloves of roasted garlic (roast with a bit of olive oil and salt, wrapped in foil in a 350° F (180° C) oven for about 20 mins) and it was absolutely perfect for me, smooth, rich and savory. Hubby and I had this with chicken pitas with lettuce, tomato, red onion and feta-stuffed olives with some plain yogurt on top. The hummus is also even better the next day. I like it best on a big cracker with cucumber thinly sliced lengthwise on top. Thank you very much for this awesome recipe! This will be a new healthy regular at our house.

First, I've never been a fan of hummus, but the lemon especially is so over powering in this recipe.  Maybe I just had an especially sour lemon, because that's all I tasted.  Also, a little too much tahini for my taste.  I started with the original recipe and then kept adding things until it was edible.  Added 1/4 tsp cumin, another clove garlic, and some roasted red peppers.  Next time I'll try the Spiced Sweet Roasted Red Pepper Hummus on here.

I am also an Arab we do Hummus all the time. I have few tips to add to this great basic recipe. 

1. I like to boil the beans first to soften them a bit. Hummus should have a smooth texture and if the beans are not boiled the texture will be more like Falafel and coarse.
2. Add a 1/2 tea spoon of cumin.
3. Tahina can be softened with some olive oil
4. More parsley and garlic. I normally used a full fresh bunch of parsley and few more cloves of garlic.

Good recipe. I am Lebanese and hummus has been a staple in our home since I can remember. I would suggest boiling the chick peas in their liquid for about 20 min. This makes them puree easier and eliminates taking the skin off (as one reader suggested). Use almost all the liquid to blend the chick peas.That will eliminate adding water. The Tahini is the one ingredient that makes hummus, hummus. I also use more lemon (we also like the tanginess). Traditional hummus is plain, only in recent years have people added sun dried tomatoes, or basil, or red pepper etc.

I have limited experience with hummus both with eating it and with making my own.  I’m not sure if there’s a particular way it’s SUPPOSED to taste.  What I do know, however, is that it contains just a few fundamental ingredients, but even something so simple can be ruined with too much or too little of this or that.  I added slightly less than a half teaspoon of cumin, some reserved liquid from the beans to thin it out some,  and a drizzle of olive oil (as well as an additional drizzle to finish).  For my palate, this was some pretty good hummus.

To make tahini:
2 c sesame seeds
1/3-1/2 c olive oil
Toast sesames at 350 about 10 mins.  Do not brown.
Put in food processor and blend 2 minutes. Should be thick but pourable.  Keeps in fridge for 3 months.

Have eaten hummus less than ten times in my life.  Has been store-bought in the 'fresh' section of specialty grocery stores.  Honestly, I've always considered it a bland food that was being eaten as filler.  I didn't want to make bland hummus, so I took this recipe, read reviews and then brainstormed on what would be a good blend of flavors.  What I came up with (imo) is off the scale insane good:  2 c canned garbanzo beans (50% less sodium), drained (reserve 1/2 c of liquid) 2 T tahini juice of 1 lemon 2-3 T minced roasted garlic 1 T EVOO 1/4 c sundried tomatoes 2-3 dashes balsamic vinegar 1/3 c walnuts 1/2 c garbanzo bean liquid 1/2 t salt  Put all ingredients except salt in food processor and process til smooth.  Add in salt and process.  Put in container, cover with layer of EVOO.   Even before the ingredients had the chance to get it on overnight this was utterly delicious.  Can't wait til tomorrow.

Excellant base recipe. I whipped up a huge batch in just a few minutes. I used two cans of garbanzo beans and added reserved bean juice and fat free plain yogurt to thin it out. I added ground red pepper and cumin for flavor and used about 5 large cloves of garlic. Next time I'll only use 3 of 4. I added the salt to taste and used concentrated lemon juice. I enjoyed it and shared it with a friend. As he ate, he kept saying "da*n" and "mmmmm" and making other unrecognizable sounds as he stuffed his face with bagel chips laden with hummus. I thought about giving him some alone time with the hummus. So, I take that to mean he enjoyed it very much! I will be making this often. I wonder what it tastes like with roased red pepper or sundried tomatoes?

This is sooo much better than store-bought hummus. You will want to hold onto the liquid from the beans and add it to the food processor to improve the texture. I would recommend cutting back on the tahini a little, but I've used the full amount before and I didn't think it was terribly overpowering; it's just better with less. I like to add a jalapeno or two when I'm processing it as well. I've forgotten the lemon juice before too, and it was fine - it's better with the lemon, but it's not a disaster if you don't have any on hand.

Good recipe!  I actually don't care much for tahini, so I left it out completely.  I roasted a head of garlic and added that.  FANTASTIC!  I even split and cut pita in triangles and sprayed them with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and baked them until crispy.  A really great snack for a concert on the lawn!

This is a great recipe, with a wonderful balance of flavors.  It can be modified to produce different effects:  more lemon for increased freshness, less tahini to save calories,  more garlic for more punch, and with a little bean juice to adjust the consistency.

This was yummy Rhoda.  I've never made hummus before and I took "THEPIANOMAN25's" advice and added cumin.  I did a taste test before and after the cumin and I definitley like it better with!  I did have to add some of the liquid from the beans because it was very thick but other than that, I followed the instructions.  In my opinion, this tastes better after it has sat a while.  The flavors come together better after about an hour (at room temp).  Thanks for sharing.

This is good stuff! I took the advice of others and added a bit of the beans' juice, and the consistency came out perfect. I ground sesame seeds in the food processor instead of tracking down tahini, and it came out delicious. I also added cumin and dill weed, so it tasted more like the "40 spices" hummus flavor sold at my local grocery.

Excellent! As good as that from a local restaurant where I usually buy it.  This will replace my old recipe.  Next time I will reduce the amount of tahini slightly and add a little bit of tabasco sauce. I did add another clove of garlic, a little more lemon juice and some juice from the beans. My family loves it!

This is the best hummus recipe I've found by far. It tastes the closest to a restaurant we frequent. I took some other reviewers's advice and used a tsp. of cumin and red pepper flakes. Also I used fresh lemon juice, tahini from a jar (not the can stuff), at least 5 cloves of garlic, and the juice from about 1 can of garbanzo beans. I topped it with olive oil and basil from my garden. The result was outstanding. And even better the next day! I brushed pitas with olive oil and shredded parmesan and baked them for about 5-8 minutes at 350 then cut them into triangles with cooking scissors. No leftovers!

I am a member of Cook's Illustrated, which has a similar recipe.  The key to smooth hummus according to them is the order in which you process the ingredients.  Grind the beans and seasonings in the food processor first, then add the lemon juice mixed with any (bean) water and process again, then add the tahini and olive oil.  I think this recipe needs the water to smooth it out.  I also added more garlic and 1/2 tsp. cumin and a dash of cayenne.

This basic hummus recipe was great. I modified it a little to better suit my taste. I used 1/4 cup tahini and 1 garlic clove instead of what the recipe calls for because it seemed like a lot of garlic and tahini for only 2 cups of hummus. I also used cayenne pepper instead of paprika because I wanted to make it a little spicy. Make sure you save the juice from the can of garbanzo beans to use later to get your hummus to the consistency that you want. I served this hummus with pita chips that I made and it was delicious. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like hummus thought it was good. I would definitely make this recipe again!

1) Tripled the garlic

3) Reserved the garbanzo bean liquid to thin it out.
4) Requested often by friends.

This is good!  I had to thin it a bit with the bean liquid (remember to reserve some or you can use water) - I also added extra parsley and maybe 3 T total of olive oil - I used smoky paprika, next time I will try a bit of cayenne too!  I used the full amount of tahini and lemon juice and it was to my tastes (some tahini's are more bitter than others, the jar I have is pretty mild and I like the flavor).  I've tried a few recipes and this is my favorite so far!  I'm coming back to edit....I believe I've been using to cans of garbanzo's instead of two cups :)  I just made a couple days ago, and for the life of  me can't remember!!  So - keep that in mind when making, you may like it better with 2 cans of beans and everything else the same :)  I've made this so much since finding this recipe - it really is good stuff!

I buy dried beans and boil them, put them in freezer and take them out when I need them.  I liked the fact that this called for 'cups' rather than 'can' because it was easy to measure.  Just threw everything in my food processor.  Used tunisian chili powder in lieu of paprika, and cilantro instead of parsley.  I did have to add more liquid and thought it was because of the dried beans until I read the reviews.  If using canned, one could use some of the liquid from the canned beans.  Served with olive oil drizzled over top with a few lemon wedges (Algerian style)  Used roasted garlic and fresh garlic for a layer of garlic flavor.  Bought some really soft pita from my favorite middle eastern store.  My Jordanian guest really gobbled this up!!!  Thanks for the super easy recipe with superb taste.

Just made!  Yum!  I tweeked it a bit.  We love garlic so I doubled the garlic.  I also put a small pinch of cayenne pepper in it and added a small splash of cold water as I was processing it.  You need to process it for awhile to get that smooth consistancy.

As far as the tahini I noticed lots of comments that the amount was too much.  I have made hummus before and the amount was too much.  This one I added 6 TBS of tahini and 6 TBS of lemon juice.  I do not know the ratio it would be for the amount called...but mine ended up good.  I also added a bit more of salt and used Celtic Sea Salt.  Can't get enough hummus!  Why buy store bought....it does not compare !!

I am Turkish and make hummus all the time. It is our classic side dish for bbq. I am very surprised to see a hummus recipe without cumin. One can leave out tahini but never the cumin. Please try it with cumin next time...I also add a little bit olive oil.  And using some of the can juice to dillute the chickpea paste is a very good idea. That is the way to make it creamy without making it to oily or lemony.

Excellent recipie. I'd tried another using  my blender and had great difficulty with its thickness. For all of you out there using a blender, mix all the ingrediants with only half of the beans and a few tablespoons of the leftover liquid from the beans. After blending those, gradually blend in the rest of the beans and it will turn out wonderfully!

I have been buying homus for the longest time and love it.  I also go to lebanese restaraunts often and love their homus, but could never find one in the stores that tasted the same.  This recipe was great and it tasted like the restaraunt's, but I thought that the consistancy was a little thick and dry.  I added some of the juice from the garbonzo bean can until I got the consistancy that I wanted.  Anyway, it costs like $3 to buy a tiny thing of homus in the store, so this is a great way to save some money because it makes a good amount.

I eat hummus almost every day, and that kind of intake can get expensive.  that was my main reason for finding a hummus recipe on this site.  I am blown away by this one!  Hummus is one of those things that is adaptable to different tastes, and this one is no different.  I love garlic so I doubled the amount, and I don't like too much tahini so I started with 2 Tbsp. and ended up going to 3 total.  I used about 1/8 cup lemon juice since I don't like my hummus too sour and I blended 1 Tbsp. olive oil before adding another tbsp. on top.  This is going to be a staple in my house; i can see myself adding so many different things!  Thank you so much for this recipe, I'm sending it to my friends and my mom right now!

Great basic recipe.  Definitely needs cumin, red pepper flakes and extra spices.  Add garbanzo bean juice to food processor to change the texture.  Next time I'll experiment with basil and sundried tomatoes!  :)

I make this recipe fairly often. I always make it with a bit less tahini than is called for... I don't think it needs that much, and it makes it a little less fat that way.  I also definitely add a fair amount of the bean liquid to make it a more creamy texture.

Awesome!  And some incredible pointers from everyone here :o)!!    I'm another one of those who increased the garlic and added some cumin.

The one poster named "Head" did a superb job of explaining why some people may be coming out with dry hummus.   

He said that the recipe calls for 2 total cups of garbonzo beans.   If you mistook that for 2 CANS.. you'd wind up with a total of 3 cups of beans, it would explain the texture being a bit dry.   (2 cans = 3 cups beans)

Great hummus and REALLY great suggestions from everyone here!!   Next time I make it, I may try adding a tiny bit of fresh cilantro to the garlic & cumin.     
  
Love that hummus ~  NUM!  
edited typo  ;o)

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  One of my friend's grandmothers was Lebonese and made us homemade hummus occasionally . . . and I have NEVER had any even close to as good until now!    This recipe is PERFECT!  I followed it exactly . . . well .. . except for adding more garlic, because we love it so much.  This is so much less expensive to make than to buy, and it tastes SO much better than store bought.  THANK YOU for this terrific recipe.  As a side note . . . this was terrific with the Syrian Bread recipe off this site, which was actually pretty easy to make.  YUM!

Perfect base-line recipe. Almost too much for my cuisinart mini-prep to handle, but it still gets the job done. I added dried chili peppers, cummin, and cayenne pepper to some for a fabulous spicy pizza-topper.

Excellent!!  If you are a Hummus fan, forget about buying it at your local market or deli, and make this recipe instead!  It's so easy and so good!  Tip:  Save the liquid when draining the beans.  You may need to add a little while pureeing if the consistency is too thick.

Great base recipe - I used a little less tahini and a little of the saved bean "juice". I also just added the olive oil and paprika to the mixture instead of drizzling on top. Delicious!

This is now my stand-by hummus recipe.  I add more garlic than is called for and cut back a hair on the lemon juice (I used bottled vs fresh - probably the difference.)  Cooked from dry garbanzos taste FAR better in this recipe and brings more to the palate and nutrient label.

As someone else said, don't drain the garbonzo beans if you use a blender.  The thick tahini plus bean paste was too much for the blender to mix properly.  I had to end up add more oil and water.  Also, only use 2-3 cloves of garlic, not 12 like me.  I am now looking at new apartments as my roommates have disowned me :(

My versiion was uneadible - straight down the drain. 1/3 cup tahini is overpowering. Will try again with a tahini substitute.

I've been making this recipe for about 3 years now and I love it. It's so easy to make and comes out every time. However, I make mine in a blender and it's always necessary to add about a cup of extra liquid (I use reserved liquid from the chickpeas.) Perhaps this wouldn't be the case if one were using a food processor. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 4 cloves of garlic, and I added 1 tsp. cumin and some crushed red pepper. I will never buy hummus again. This was so easy to make, and easily matched and surpassed any store bought hummus. Also, I searched all over my grocery store for tahini, and finally found it with the kosher foods.

I guess I am in the minority here.  I sure wish I had read the reviews more closely first, though.  I drained the beans and should have reserved some liquid; this was very thick & pasty and the lemon flavor was overwhelming to both my husband and I. Sorry...

I added 1 teaspoon cumin, a dash of cayenne, reduced the tahini to about 2 tablespoons and added enough olive oil until it reached a good consistency.  I also substituted 1/4 cup dill for the parsley.  It was wonderful right away but even better the next day!

This recipe produces a great, basic hummus that is easy to modify with other interesting ingredients.  Fresh ginger root is good (you only need a little bit!), as well as fresh mint, cilantro, onion, cayenne, shallots... in any combination.  But for basic hummus, I use this all the time.

This was very good. I reduced the recipe by 1/4 bc my can of been only supplied 1.5c of drained beans. I did save some of the juice from the beans so the hummus woundn'tbe so dry and I added 3/4 tsp of cummin. I only gave it four stars Bc hummus needs cumin.

Love this! It has become a weekly staple. 
Edit: Usually I use minced garlic from a jar but this time I used fresh and two cloves was a bit overwhelming. in future if I use fresh I will only use one clove.

Very good! I found a 15.5 oz can is about a cup and a half so by increasing the servings to 24 let's me use two whole cans of chickpeas. I also like having even more hummus! I used bottled lemon juice and it was a bit much next time I will reduce the quantity or use fresh.

Great! Good lemon and garlic flavor. I'd like to try other flavors, as well. Used the advice of reviewer SonjaL and blended it in my mini food processer. One can of chickpeas is about 1.5 cups. I stuck with just paprika and took this to a class party. We liked it and I enjoyed that it is healthy and tasty.

Just okay, used more garlic, boiled the garbanzos first (glad someone mentioned to do that), had to thin it out with the liquid from the can of beans.  Sorry but I like the other recipe from this site better, its called Real Hummus.

loved it!  I have always made my own hummus 'off the cuff' and with different types of beans as I didn't (think) I liked garbanzo beans.  Well this recipe sure proved me wrong!   I have made this for the Superbowl tomorrow but quite frankly, it tastes sooo good that i have a feeling I'll be making more tomorrow (before the guests arrive!)  The garlic and lemon are RIGHT ON and I admit, I thought, what can parsley add --- oh, it adds a heck of a lot!  MAKE THIS RECIPE!  :-)

IT was really good. One tip I would suggest is leaving about half of the liquid in the garbanzo beans and adding maybe a teaspoon of olive oil and oregano in the blender while blending.

As others have noted, great basic recipe. Tweak it as you like, I used three 15 oz cans garbanzo, two heaping teaspoons of Chinese chile paste, tahini, lemon, olive oil, omitted parsley.

Next time I will use canned chipotle peppers or canned jalapeno peppers as I like my hummus with kick. Cost co was selling hummus and it was so expensive. This cost about $2.00 for 3 cups.

I'm a minimalist when it comes to recipes, not to mention I like to use what I have in my kitchen at the time, so I looked up this recipe and it's fantastic. I only used 4 ingredients, plus S&P and it turned out fantastic. The 2 cans of garbanzo beans (completely drained and rinsed to remove junk and salt from cans), juice from 1 large lemon (might try lemon zest next time), lots of EVOO, 5 garlic cloves, S&P. Blend in Quisinart. Voila!!

Four and a half stars as is, five stars with my alterations!  I used a little bit (about 1/8 cup) of the chickpea juice to thicken it up a bit, and used more garlic and about 1/4 of a red pepper to add some color.  It was DELICIOUS!! My mom and I ate just about the entire batch by the end of the night.

This was super easy & tasted really good!  I did not have tahini so I just made it without & I did not miss it at all. Took less than 10 minutes to make & everyone loved it.  Great quick after-school snack!

Very yummy. I followed some suggestions by other reviewers- only 2 tbsp tahini, added a little cumin, and about 1/4 cup liquid from chickpeas. Great consistency!

Very good hummus.  I add the olive oil while blending it in the food processor for a nice creamy texture.  I also add a little of the bean water from the can for a smoother consistency, otherwise it's too stiff.

I would have loved to review this recipe based on its original posting but I made changes to it because everybody loves their hummus differently. Since it was my first time making hummus, I found myself following reviewers instructions and adding them slowly to the mixture to get the right consistency and taste I liked. I did not use canned beans but rather used 1 Cup of raw chickpeas (soaked them overnight and boiled the next day with salt) and found that it looked like about 2-2.5 Cups of cooked beans. Reading other reviews, I was careful to add the tahini a little at a time and by the end of it, added 4 tbsp. I left the lemon juice at 1/4 Cup and added plenty of cumin. I initially did 1/8 tsp at a time and by the end of it, I added about 1 tsp of cumin. I added 1 tbsp of paprika (I don't find it adds heat, just a nicer colour) and I added 1/8 tsp cayenne and about 4 cloves of garlic, if not 5. I forgot to buy parsley so I skipped that. I added the water (not all, just spoonfuls at a time until I got the consistency I liked) I used to boil the chickpeas into the mix and about 1.5 tbsp of olive oil into the mix to make it smooth.  But what is nice about the recipe is definitely use it as a base and work it to your liking. I even added purple onion (small piece) and it added a nice touch. You could basically add lots of great stuff to make it your own. Thanks for providing this recipe for hummus lovers like myself and one that is so flexible as this one.

Tastes just like the humus found in middle eastern restaurants.  This is a very addictive dip and one that I'll be making again and again.  Thank you for sharing such a good recipe.

Incredible! This is my first time making hummus, but I anticipate making it often now! I used dried, soaked, cooked chickpeas. Just a few minor adjustments: I used only 2 Tbsp. of tahini and 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil and added a little fresh red pepper. Everything else was the same. Super good!

This is a delicious hummus recipe and so easy to make it's almost sinful.  I did drain and keep the liquid from the beans, and I used ALL of it to get the texture I wanted.  The lemon juice really brightens up the flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.

The grocery store didn't have tahini, so I just ground up some lightly toasted sesame seeds. Seemed to hit the spot perfectly!!

Love this.  I roasted a bulb of garlic and added all the cloves.  Used salt and lemon juice to taste.  I tripled the batch and froze some.  My grandson was here over the weekend and devoured this.  Ate it with chips, veggies and even put it on his hamburger.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe, and as everyone has mentioned, you can jazz it up according to your own tastes.  I used the recipe as a loose guideline and ended up making something that tastes almost exactly the same as my favorite restaurant hummus, except that I think they use freshly boiled beans.  2 cans of beans with a bit of their liquid, 5 spoonfuls (which I'd estimate to be probably 4 or 5 tbsp.) of tahini, a good pinch of salt, 3 cloves of garlic, and the juice of one lemon was all it needed to be amazing.  I didn't bother with the paprika, olive oil or parsley because it's mostly just a garnish, and I've never felt that the extra oil on top added anything special to the dip.  I sliced up some mini peppers to serve this with and settled in for an amazing midnight snack.  Just a note for anyone who is concerned about their tahini when they open the can.  It's likely that it'll separate, just like real peanut butter tends to.  DO NOT throw out the oil - it'll just be a rock without it.  Take a spoon or a fork and slowly work the oil into the hard paste at the bottom of the can.  It can take several minutes to get it all incorporated, but once it's done, the texture will be just right, and you won't have a wasted can of expensive, rock-hard sesame paste on your hands.

I don't know much about hummus, but I know I've had some I liked and some I didn't like. I started eating it the day I made it and was very disappointed with it, so it sat in the fridge for a couple days. Not wanting to waste it I finally pulled it out again and was surprised at how much better it was. So now I am very pleased with this recipe, I just know that for my taste I need to let it refrigerate over night to mellow out before I'm going to like it.

This is a good, basic recipe and we loved it. I added about 1/8 cup of water to the food processor (maybe more) because we like ours thinner. I also used garlic powder instead of cloves. Definitely use nice extra-virgin olive oil in this- it really makes a huge difference.

SUPER easy and equally yummy! I love that you can control how much olive oil and salt goes into this recipe therefore making it way more healthy (but just as tasty if not better) than a restaurant's!

Wonderful recipe...very tasty!  One recommendation: If using a blender, do not drain the garbanzo beans...you will need the liquid.  I followed the recipe, but ended up needing to add water to get blender to process.

Hummus Heaven!  This is a great "base" recipe that accepts additions very well.
I have, in the past, added freshly roasted red peppers.  I tried a new twist today: I omitted the salt and olive oil and added one more clove of garlic and approximately 1/4 pound of pitted calamata olives.  I also threw in a few green stuffed olives.  Excellent! Before serving do try to let it blend flavors and "develop character" in the fridge overnight. So fast and easy. Good for me, too, right?  OH PLEASE LET THIS BE GOOD FOR ME!!!

I made this as a pita-chip dip for 15 of my husband's college buddies at their annual fantasy baseball draft.  I wanted them to have at least something that was healthier than pork rinds, but something a group of jocks would be OK eating. That was 5 years ago.  At least three of the 15 guys remind me every year to "make that bad- hummus again."  :)

ohmygoodness! So yummy! I couldn't find tahini, so I subbed about 1.5 tsp of sesame seeds. Also cut back on the lemon juice, and did need the reserved liquid from the beans... I just used one can of beans as it was almost 2 cups (not quite). Quite delicious.

If you only want to try 1 hummus recipe, it should be this one!  It's awesome!  Tastes just like what I order at the fancy cafe.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves, and added a couple tablespoons of olive oil to the mix, and a tad of water to get it blending (hint:  don't use the water from the canned beans, it has preservatives in it, so rinse and drain beans first).  I also used a blender, it probably would have been easier with a processor, but it got the job done.  It made a large quantity - it would be perfect for a large group or party.

Easy, inexpensive and convienient to keep all the ingredients on hand. And SO good! I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans, drained only 1 can, dumped the whole thing liquid and all with the other. Reduced the tahini to 2 heaping tbs. and left the oil off the top--no need for all the extra fat in such a tasty, healthy recipe. Make sure you stir your tahini well! I threw in an extra clove of garlic and upped the parsley to 2 tbs. I also threw the parsley in the food processor instead of using it as a topping. A tip for clean up and storage: hummus forms a hard crust pretty quickly, so rinse out your food processor right away. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the hummus before you refrigerate it to keep the crust from forming. I then cover it tightly with foil to keep the garlic from permeating the whole fridge.

The recipe as is was a little bland and needed a little spice for me.  I added a little cumin and a little cayenne pepper, which made it perfect.  It was great spread on whole wheat pitas.

Very easy, very basic, very good.  I tripled this recipe for a wedding reception that included vegetarian guests. They were very appreciative. I myself enjoyed it very much. It was served with pita bread wedges and crudites (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and radishes). A definite keeper, and one I know I'll use again.

I thought this was an excellent recipe, because I followed the advice of previous reviewers. I reserved the liquid from the beans and used almost 3 tablespoons of it to thin the hummus to the consistency I wanted. Also, I only used 2 tablespoons of tahini. I have taken this to two parties recently and I received compliments both times.

I also did some of the changes to fit my desired taste (added a roasted garlic head). But one thing I noticed on other reviews was it was thick to them. To help with this I saved some of the drained liquid from the beans and added this as needed. It worked great and did not affect the taste. Wonderful, and much much cheaper to make at home.

I have been making hummus for years and wishing I could match the authentic taste and texture of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants. This is the closest recipe so far. I added a bit of olive oil and liquid that I drained from the garbanzo beans during blending to reach the desired consistency. It seemed too thick and pasty without it. I garnished the dip with pitted kalamata olives. The two tastes together are fabulous!

This is the best hummus I've ever had.  The step that takes the longest time is stirring the tahini before you measure it.  Besides that, it's a snap.

This is a great 'basic' recipe.  It inspired me to really attempt the new "Med" food craze.  Try adding parsley, more olive oil, some reserved bean liquid.  Great with bagel chips!

This is very easy and delicious! I had to add a tiny bit of water to get it to puree better, but that's it.  I made it the day before our party and kept it in the fridge.  I think that helped the flavors blend better, because it was really tasty.  A keeper!

Great recipe. My only thoughts are that sometimes I would add another tablespoon of olive oil to make it a tad smoother. Other wise, this is a great recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I added roasted red peppers and the zest from my lemon before I juiced it. Really tasty and easy instructions. I ended up not using oil, I just added the juice from the bean until I got the consistency I wanted. 

Thanks for posting!

Really easy to make.  Will not buy store bought hummus again.  You can really add anything you like to liven it up a bit.  I add sundried tomatoes, green olives, garlic and some cayenne pepper.  Reading the reviews before making really helps to enhance this recipe.

Great recipe.  It works great if you follow it exactly or even if you're a little short on tahini.  I use powdered garlic 1/4 t instead of a clove of garlic.  packs better in my daughters' lunches.

Delicious! I used less lemon as suggested(about half a lemon), and I added extra garlic (2 more cloves) since that's a preference in this household. 3 TBSP tahini was the perfect amount. I also added 2 - 3 tsp of cumin. I omitted the salt, parsley, and paprika.. but I added cayenne pepper at the end for a little extra flavor.
It turned out very balanced.

I make this recipe when I have guests over all the time and I always here how great it is and the bowl is left clean!  I won't ever buy store brand.  Its inexpensive to make from home (only thing that is pricey is the Tahini, but one can lasts 5 hummus) so definitely worth it.

This is such a simple but tasty and healthy recipe. My kids (triplets!) especially love it. I buy the tahini (the kind I buy at the grocery store) and have to stir it quite a while to get the oil well mixed. It's easy to double. I also adjust the amount of juice and salt according to taste. Sometimes I'll add more seasoning for the one son who likes it spicier, as the original recipe is pretty tame. I'll ask jalapeno (seeded) along with a hot sauce.  It's easy and lasts only as long as the kids and I take to spread it on a variety of crackers.

Very good basic recipe which can be modified to suit your personal taste.  Proportions are very good, except for garlic which was stronger than "basic" hummus needs to be.  Gone in a flash in our house.

I gave this 4 stars for a fantastic base recipe for hummus. It was a little bit bland for my taste. I like a little more tang. I added twice the amount of lemon juice and twice the amount of garlic (love garlic, too). I didn't bother with the olive oil, paprika, or parsley. It was fine without it, and was also lower in calories without the olive oil. The paprika and parsley would be a better presentation if making it for a party. A great healthy snack served with pita chips or bread, or fresh, crisp raw veggies.

I have also made this with artichoke hearts and jalapeño chili. A great base recipe for trying various flavors. Thanks, RC2STEP for submitting this recipe.

Yum! I used 1 can of drained garbanzos, 4 cloves of garlic, the juice of a small lemon, 2T tahini, extra virgin olive, a little dried parsley, the paprika. Added 1/4 c roasted red pepper, a couple of dashes of cumin, a dash of cayenne, a small amount of the garbanzo bean liquid. Forgot about the salt and did NOT miss it.

This was super easy to make with a stick blender. I used a garlic press for the garlic as I wasn't sure how finely the stick blender would chop it.

The only thing is: Now I have garlic breath! :O

This is a great starter recipe for some awesome hummus!   I love garlic so I added a couple of extra freshly minced cloves.  Fresh lemon juice is a must, as well as about 1 tsp of ground cumin and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.   Like other reviewers, I used a bit less tahini and had to use some reserved juice from the garbanzo beans (about 4-6 TBLS) in order to get the right consistency.  No need to buy hummus when you can make it as awesome as this!

A great recipe.    I've made it many times and more recently with fava beans (which I grow as a winter crop) rather than garbanzo beans.   Other than the bean choice, I follow the recipe completely.

This was really good!  I made it for my mom's Greek birthday dinner.  Per other reviews I started out with a little bit of tahini and added more as I pulsed the mixture in my food processor, tasting it as I went.  Also I added a bit more garlic for more flavor.  Next time I'll try adding pesto, or sun dried tomatoes for a different flavor.  I will not be buying anymore store bought hummus.  This was really good and my mom LOVED it!  :)

Used two whole cans of garbanzo beans and saved a little water from one to thin things out. Up'd the garlic to 4 cloves (yum) and sort of eye-balled everything else to makes sure I had plenty of flavor for using two cans. Very good, super easy and fast. I didn't mince the parsley, just tossed it all into the food processor! So good! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great hummus recipe! I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and just a little less olive oil. Like some of the other reviews, I used the water from the beans... I added some fresh chives to the mix too! I will definitely make this again and again! The whole family loves it!

Delish!  I used dried chickpeas that I slow simmered for 2 hours with some big cloves of garlic.  that way the chickpeas had a really good flavor with out all the extra salt.  I also tossed in a large tablespoon of pickled jalapeño slices and a splash of their juice.  It gave the hummus more flavor without making it hot.  Oh, and I added the tablespoon of olive oil to the hummus while it was blending in the food processor instead of pouring it on top bc I think it gives the hummus a really nice creamy texture that way.  def a keeper!!!

Too much lemon, and too dry.  Needs olive oil added directly into the mixture to smooth it out.

Don't forget to add in some of the juice from the can and it is the perfect recipe. I make slight changes to suite different family members but I never have to change much. For example only 1/4 c. tahini  if my toddler will be eating it. Less garlic add roasted peppers for my husband, more garlic for  my mother... But that is nothing against the recipe. If I make it as is - with the juice- everyone likes it!

Made this recipe recently for a garden party. The taste was fine but the consistancy was very dry- much drier than at my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Any suggestions?

This was DELICIOUS! I used one 15 oz. can of beans and reserved some bean juice to add back in for consistency. I had enough to last for a week as veggie dip for snack that I took to work in small containers. One reviewer was right in saying that a blender could puree it too much. EDIT: the next time I used a wand mixer for more texture and the texture was better). Thanks for the healthy protein-packed dip! :o)

Why did I ever buy hummus from a store??  This recipe is fantastic and easy.  I went with a few other's suggestions in reducing the tahini, adding more garlic, using some of the garbanzo bean juice, and adding cumin and chili powder.  It is delicious!  Next time I will add some red pepper.

I gave this 4 stars because I had to tweek it a little bit.  I reduced the amount of tahini to 3 TBLS and my family gobbled it up.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe as is and there was too much tahini.  Very good.

excellent basic recipe - to TWO 15 oz. CANS of drained chick peas, i used this recipe but added 1 teaspoon ground white pepper, 1-2 additional cloves of garlic, and 2 generous tablespoons of toasted ground cumin along with the salt (i used kosher), lemon juice (i used bottled reallemon), tahini, and i incorporated 2-3 T olive oil right into the blend instead of drizzling it on top after dip was processed. OMG ~ it is the best we've ever had!

Very yummy. Next time I will follow the advice of another reviewer and add the chickpeas and tahini a bit at a time. I added a bit too much tahini for my taste. I put at least 8 cloves of garlic in this and it seemed just right. Sometime I'll try making it with roasted red pepper, which is my fave type of hummus.

I added water to thin the consistency down and bit and should have added more lemon juice instead. There was just something missing from the flavour. Very easy to make so I will definitely give it another shot.

This was pretty easy and turned out great!  I later made some changes which I prefer to the original: added most of the juice from the garbanzo beans to make the hummus creamier, added about 3/4 cup sun dried tomatoes and 1/3 cup of basil, increased the paprika and added just a pinch of dried chili flakes.  (I also omitted the garlic due to family allergies, but am sure it would be delicious).  I also cut back on the lemon - it was a little too overpowering - to about 1/8 cup.  Every one loved this hummus and it has become a go-to snack with veggie sticks or crackers.  thanks for getting me started!  I will probably try some other flavoring options next time!

After reading several reviews I decided to add some cumin, one extra garlic clove, and I used 2T of tahini.  It was perfect for me this way.  I did reserve the liquid from the garbanzo beans and used it to get the texture I wanted.  I thought it made quite a bit and appreciated the freezing tip another viewer posted.  Putting them in muffin pans is genious and helps with portion control!  I will be enjoying this recipe often!

Better than most restaurant hummus I've had.  I skipped the paprika and parlsey and used about a teaspoon of cumin instead.  Adding roasted red peppers to the mix is also delicious!

Love hummus, but never made my own...this is SO good, SO cheap & SO adaptable to any taste.  We like ours with with a kick, so added diced jalapenos w/some juice - yummy!  I did use some of the bean liquid per prior suggestions - a big help in blending.  This is going in my "go-to" recipe box - thank you!

What a wonderful recipe! I love the versatility. After putting this in my food processor and doing a taste test, I decided to add a little more lemon juice and garlic. I topped it of with a little sauted garlic in olive oil and paprika. I love how you can make this recipe your own. I love it!!!!

Made as is the first time and it was great! The second time, I made it to personal preference: used 16 oz can garbanzo beans (undrained), 2 Tbsp. tahini, 1/2 tsp. cumin, omitted salt, and added 1/4 cup jalapeno pepper slices, then blended...TERRIFIC :)

I've made hummus before, but this was my first time making it with tahini. I've eaten a homemade version with tahini before, and it was great. I did not care for this at all. Way too much tahini. I thought it tasted like peanut butter. I could not tasted any other flavors.  It was really hard to blend, too, and took a long time.

This needed spices. But after adding a large dose of cumin(I started with 1 TB and worked up), garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, and extra cayenne, it was the best hummus I'd ever had. Even people who usually don't like hummus, liked this.

My family didn't like this very much...I think this could be a good recipe, I'm afraid I just need to get used to making hummus and such.  The recipe itself was WAY too sour.  I think do less lemon juice, making up for the liquid with juice from the chick peas.  Maybe it will be better next time!

Very good! what another reviewer mentions is true -- if you take the skins off the garbanzo beans, this will come out smooth as silk for a fabulous texture. They are easy to remove if you submerge the beans in a bowl of water and peel them underwater.

Good! I just smashed up the beans instead of using the processor so it wasn't as creamy, but good flavor.

Good base recipe. I didn't have tahini so I made my own: 4 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, 1 tsp. sesame oil, 1/2 tsp. salt and 2 tbsp water blended to form a paste. I used all of that and 1-16 oz can garbanzo beans, 1 tbsp olive oil, smidgen cumin, smidgen paprika, a couple dashes black pepper, 1 large garlic clove, 1 tbsp lemon and 2 tbsp. garbanzo bean juice and blended it all up! Way better than store bought! And so much cheaper too!

This is the best hummus recipe I've tried so far.  I like my hummus runnier then this added back in some of the water from the garbanzo beans to make it smoother.  I also blended in the olive oil instead of drizzling on top.

As is, this is a thick, pasty hummus.  I think the tahini needs to be reduced, and the garlic roasted and increased.  Also, save some of the liquid from the canned beans to add so it can be thinned out to spreadable.  Also, add flavoring to suit your taste (ie; roasted peppers, chili, etc.)

A good jumping off point for hummus.  The lemon flavor was a bit pronounced but it was otherwise too bland for our tastes.  This was too thick to blend so reserve the liquid drained from the garbanzo beans to thin it out.

I usually hate reviews that aren't of the recipe exactly as written - but I didn't want to buy an $8 jar of Tahini, so I changed one thing - upped the olive oil to about 1/4 cup in place of the Tahini. I also added in some freshly roasted red peppers (broil, skin side up, for 10 minutes - plop in plastic bag to cool - peel skin off, super easy), and it is delicious! I'm so excited to share this with my hummus-lovin' friend. Thank you for the recipe! Even though I changed it! I'm a poor college student, I have no need for a jar of Tahini lol.

This was my first time making hummus and I'm surprised that this recipe is so popular.  I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was very dry.  I added water, but it was still not a pleasing texture.  Also the lemon, garlic, and tahini ratio needs improvement.  I am searching for a better recipe.

I made this as written with the exception of roasting the garlic first before adding it to the food processor. It's so easy and adds A TON more flavor. Also, I used cilantro in place of the parsley, but that's just a personal preference. I also found that when taste testing it, it may seem that there is enough salt, but unless you are dipping something already salted into it you will need to add more. I am not condoning over salting, just giving a tip. When finished I topped with toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds, and it was mmm mmm good :)

I've used this recipe about 6 times. I just got a text message requesting it for the Daytona race party tomorrow. I do not change a thing with the recipe. Always a huge hit!!! I serve it with Multigrain Tostitos. And i do reserve some of the garbonzo bean juice to add back to it to sofen it up a bit. I don't measure the beans...i just use 2 cans.

I'm Lebanese and this is almost identical in flavor to what my grandma used to make, right down to the paprika and olive oil drizzled on top.  The only difference is that she blended everything and then slowly drizzled olive oil (I added maybe a couple Tbsp. or so) into the mixture while the food processor was going.  When I did that, the flavor was right on.

I'll admit we tweaked a bit (I don't remember what all we did, just kept adding more of the ingredients until we liked it) but it ended up being delicious! We ate the whole bowl right there! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great receipe.  I'd add a little bean juice or olive oil, especially if using a blender...to make it run more smoothly.  I added a pinch of cayenne also as my husband loves spicy stuff.  He scarfed it down!

I just made this and it was great! I used 2 cans of garbanzos which was 3 cups so I altered the amounts a little. 
2 cans garbanzos (3cups)
1/2 cup tahini
1/3 cup lemon juice
3 cloves garlic
1 TBS salt
Awesome!!!

Great basic hummus recipe! I do think cumin is a must. Quantities are definately subjective to your own tastes. I think someone already mentioned, add little by little (esp lemon juice and tahini) because you can't take it away! The raw garlic gives it a kick my husband loves but me not so much. I love roasted garlic instead:
peel entire head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, and bake in oven at 300 for 20 min (or until soft).

Like others, I use a little less tahini for a more mild taste.  However, the MOST IMPORTANT HINT I can ever share about hummos is this:  REMOVE THE SKINS FROM THE CHICK PEAS before you use them.  The result--only the creamiest hummos you'll ever taste. Happy cooking!

A suggestion to thin this out a bit (a little too thick for me, but great taste).  Save the drained liquid from the garbonzo beans and add a bit at a time to thin out the recipe once it has been blended.  The taste stays the same, and it is a little thinner.

Leave overnight and this is a perfect hummus... The flavors blend beautifully. If using a blender to mix then do not give up hope when it just wont blend nice. Add a touch of oil/water and keep stopping stirring up the mix and blending. All will be good!

Best hummus ever. I will never buy it from the grocery store again. I always make half exactly like the recipe calls for and process the other half with sundried tomatoes. Fantastic.

Perfect hummus--as good as in any restaurant.  And who would have thought how fast and easy it is to make?!  Works well with pita pieces, pita chips (my Costco has yummy Stacy's pita chips), veggies or on sandwiches with meat and/or veggies.  Everyone I've made this for has loved it!  Caution--this makes a large amount.  Make it for company or be prepared to eat a lot!

Hooray!  A good, easy, healthy dish that my husband and I adore.  Just wonderful!  I do like it with a bit more garlic and a bit less tahini, though, but I think that is just a personal preference.

This is a great starting point for Hummus.  Following other's suggestions, I made a few changes/additions.  I used 4 tablespoons of tahini, doubled the garlic (I'm a fan), left out the salt and added some cayenne pepper, basil/tomato feta and a bit of the juice from the garbanzo beans to make it creamier.  I also mixed in the parsley & olive oil.  Delicious!

YOU GOT IT!!  This was wonderful.  I did what others suggested though and added about 4 tablespoons of the garbanzo/chick pea liquid.  Made it with cut up cucumbers, different color peppers and onions and of course pita bread.  YUM!

I love this recipe! Reserve the liquid from the garbanzos to add if its too thick. Be sure to NOT use Roasted tahini. I accidentally bought that the first time I made this and it was not good.

Great hummus recipe, except I had to revise a little, so I could not give it 5 stars.  I reduced tahini to 2 tbls, reduced garlic (because the garlic taste becomes stronger later), and mixed olive oil while processing everything together.  I made 80 servings for my cousin's bridal shower (which created a large platter) & served with warm pita bread.  It was such a hit!  
The key is to prepare a couple hours before serving and do not ever refrigerate.

This was really good.  I've made it several times.  Last time I really impressed my in-laws with this recipe.  My Father-in-law said that it was better than my Mother-in-law's recipe.  I added more garlic and more lemon juice.  We liked the fact that this recipe called for very little olive oil, we are all trying to cut down on the fat!  My Mother-in-law asked me for the recipe.  I will make this over and over again.

I followed the directions word for word, and it came out too pasty.  Then I added a touch of lemon juice and the olive oil to thin it out, and it was just plain disgusting.  :(  I just couldn't eat it.  I should have followed some of the other reviewers' advice on thinning it out a bit.  I think I'm just better off buying it in the store.  Thanks for the recipe anyway!

This recipe was good but had way too much tahini,  since I didn't read the reviews before preparing it, I had to try and fix it.  I added one more can of chick peas and one can of italian undrained white beans (it took away the chunkiness also).  I also added some dill weed spice. It ended up tasting great!  Thanks.

This was great!  Unfortunately neither my blender nor my food processor seemed to like the garbanzo beans that much. It would never come out silky smooth but chunky. The flavor however was great! Delicious with warm pita bread. Thanks!

I cannot believe that after trying about 10 hummus recipes I finally have found the perfect one!!!  I used 1 can chick peas (I think 2 cups would have been slightly more) and I just reduced everything else a litte bit.  Instead of putting the 1 tbsp olive oil over it at the end I put it into the mixer and added a tbsp water to make it a little thinner.   Also as someone else had suggested I used less tahini (2 tbsp.)  This came out so great!

Great recipe!  I added a finely minced habanero pepper for a little "pick me up" and everybody loved it.  Didn't have any pita bread so I just served it with Stoned Wheat Crackers.  Could have doubled the recipe and it still wouldn't have lasted long.  Thanks

I really like this recipe of hummus. I made a slight change to it. I also added fresh italian flat parsley to it, threw in about a 1/2 cup worth.. while it was mixing. The dip turned out good.

Might have been the brand of tahini that I used, but we thought that 1/3 cup was too much. It left a harsh undertaste to the hummus. To counter it, I processed in some  fresh cilantro and roasted red peppers - delicious!

This recipe produced an excellent basic hummus.  The only modification was that I slowly added about a 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil to the food processor during blending to make the hummus smoother.  For variations, add 4oz of Sundried Tomatoes (from a jar, marinated in olive oil, drained) to the food processor, or 4oz of Roasted Red Peppers (from a jar, marinated in garlic and olive oil, drained).

About 8 years ago, I made, what my family dubbed, "the best hummus ever!". I haven't been able to replicate that hummus...until now. The only thing I'd change would be 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of a teaspoon. I added a little jalapeño brine and pureed the hell out of it. It's silky smooth and creamy. Great recipe!

So, so, so, SO GOOD!! Took the tips from other reviews and used 2 tbsp tahini, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, doubled+ the garlic, 1/4 tsp cumin and incorporated bean juice. Rather than "2 cups" of canned beans, I just used a single 15 oz can of no salt added chickpeas drained and then re-incorporated as much of the drained juice as needed. I also used my own tahini using a cup of organic sesame seeds that I pan roasted and blended with 2-3 Tbsp each of oil olive & roasted sesame oil, so mine was super super toasty tasting. This recipe seems infinitely extensible. I'll definitely try batches made with some marinated artichokes thrown in or using smoked paprika. I'm super excited to start experimenting every other batch. Maybe every third ... It's really really good.

I've been using allrecipes.com for many years. First review ever. I've been trying to mimic a smooth, tasty hummus for years comparable to our favorite mediterranean restaurant. So thrilled that I happened across this little baby and gave it a try. By luck, yes luck, I only had Cannellini beans. No Garbanzo. Used the Cannelini beans instead and WOW!!! My husband and kids can't get enough!!!! I have to make huge batches every week for my family. Way healthier than ranch for dipping. Seriously, try Cannelini. It gives the hummus that lovely smooth texture and it's so delicious!! If you love hummus this is the mother of all hummus recipes!! Made no other changes-was perfect except used a softer bean and that was because it was all I had. Did I mention easy? throw it all in a blender and you're done! We LOVE this hummus!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the "T", but it was too bland.  I just kept adding tahini, lemon juice, and chickpea juice and pureed until I got the consistency I liked.  I also added more garlic, but was a bit reserved because the last time I made hummous on my own, I used TOO much garlic.  I let it sit overnight, and the hummous was delicious, but not garlicky enough.  So, like others have said, this is a fantastic base, and just fool around until you get it how you like it. Hopefully you have an amazing blender to give it the right consistency.  I will use this base all the time.

It was great! The thing that took the most time was stiring the Tahini! It was like working with concrete. I had to put a little water in the blender because it was so thick it didn't blend well but it was still thick in the end. not only is it better than already made but once you get all the ingredients initially you can make at least four batches if not more.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Way too much lemon. Way too much Tahini. Sabra is an excellent product and it's cheaper than making your own. My son in law is a chef and I was too embarrassed to even let him try it to attempt a fix.

I'm picky about hummus, but this is excellent.  I double the garlic and keep the juice from the garbanzo beans.  Use the juice to get the consistency desired.

I followed the advice in the reviews to customize it to my taste and it turned out great. Basically less tahini and lemon juice, and added the reserved chick pea juice to thin it. I didn't add any salt since there was salt in the reserved juice.

A little dry and thick for me. Added a bit of olive oil into the blender as well. Didn't de-shell the chickpeas but will next time.

I think if tweaked this is a great hummus recipe. So great to know exactly what's going in it. I listened to others and added a little cumin and cayenne for flavor/heat. I felt there was too much tahini so I had to add more lemon to balance it. Also, I was out of garbanzo and substituted canellini beans with no flavor/texture difference.

Will never buy hummus again! 1st - cook the beans in water and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for 30 minutes to 45 min. 2nd I cut the tahini in half, added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and sea salt, roasted the garlic.  Took out half the hummus then added roasted red pepper and crushed red pepper.   2 flavors, 1 recipe.   As I am typing this my daughter has polished off half the red pepper!!!!   TRIPLE THE RECIPE!

YUM! This was SO good!!! This New Years, my hubs and I decided to nosh on a couple snacks in lieu of making a special dinner as we usually do. I wanted something easy to prepare and this fit the bill perfectly! Following "The Head's" tips ensured an extra delicious end result. I found that 4 T of tahini, 3 large cloves of garlic, 1/2 t cumin / salt and a pinch of cayenne were spot on. I started with 1 oz. of fresh lemon juice as per "The Head's" suggestion and ended up squeezing the other half of my lemon into my hummus (I can't say exactly how much I used - prolly somewhere between the 1/4 c. called for and Head's suggested ounce worth). I also added 1 T of EVOO (garlic infused) to my hummus and drizzled another tablespoon on top. My only other change was to remove the outer hull from my garbanzos. I find that my hummus always has a creamier texture if I do this. NOTE: I too had to add a bit of liquid to achieve a dip-like consistency. I just kept adding reserved bean liquid until I reached the consistency I desired (approximately 1/4 - 1/2 c.). Garlic Parmesan pita chips and carrot sticks were perfect dunkers for this incredible dip! I absolutely love hummus and this didn't disappoint! Thanks for sharing your recipe, RC2STEP. :-)

Yum! We'll never buy this in the store again. This was the best--like restaurants serve. We added a green onion to the mix and put the parsley in the food processor as well. We also added a little water to make it creamier. Fantastic with pita bread that's  coated in olive oil, topped with a sprinkle of salt and Italian spices, and toasted in the oven for about 6 minutes on 400. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I roasted a few heads of garlic and added a bit more lemon juice and paprika.  I also added marinated artichoke hearts when I blended it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great base!  I changed it to our liking by using 2 cans garbanzo beans, 1/3 cup lemon juice, only 3/4 tsp. salt, an extra tsp. olive oil, 2 pinches of paprika, 1/4 tsp cumin and left out the parsley. I added a little liquid from the beans until it is the consistency we like.  I have made it with many things added to it too.  Our favorites are: Kalamata olives blended in or capers on top or topped with Sriracha hot sauce.

I followed the directions but mine came out so thick that the food processor couldn't even mix it.  I had to keep adding evoo to it to at least get it blended. I was not impressed.

Great recipe!  Quick and easy!  I made one batch as is and it but with extra garlic and it was excellent.  It is a great base to get creative with.  I made a second batch with fresh chopped jalapeños and cumin!

This was my first time making hummus and it turned out delicious! I took the advice of some of the others and used 2-15 oz cans of garbanzo beans, saved some of the bean juice to add while pureeing, added 1/2 tsp more salt, added 1 tsp red pepper, and used less than the 1/3 cup of tahini sauce. I also used 2 tsp minced garlic (not dried) as I did not have any fresh garlic on hand. All I can say is YUM!!

Have always enjoyed hummus but started making my own only a few years ago. I decided to make this recipe but found the hummus too thick for my taste.  So since I had already discarded the liquid leftover in the chick pea can, I gradually added a 50-50 mixture of water & sesame seed oil to reach my desired consistency.  Surprisingly, that tiny bit of sesame seed oil gave the hummus such a nice flavor that it created quite a stir at the buffet table that evening.  Almost everyone who tasted it wanted to know what I had done differently. I don't know if all my guests liked this variation but I observed a handful of them coming back for seconds and even thirds.  I had doubled the recipe and added 4 tbsp. water & 4 tbsp. sesame seed oil.  So for a single batch, I would make that 2 tbsp. each of water & sesame seed oil.  However, if you really like the thicker consistency you end up with, why not add the sesame seed oil only?

I will never buy hummus again!  This recipe is so easy to make and delicious.  I use about 5 cloves of garlic but everyone has their own taste!  I also usually add a jar of roasted red peppers, which i like for 3 reasons: 1- the flavor, 2- the beautiful orange color it gives the hummus, and 3- if you put the red peppers at the bottom of the blender, they sort of liquefy and make blending the chick peas easier (I don't have a food processor).  I also agree with other reviewers who said the recipe needs a little extra liquid; I add maybe a tablespoon or two from the peppers if I use them or from the chick peas if I don't.  Thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING.  Perfect hummus recipe.  As others mentioned, save the juice from the can of beans and use it to help with your consistency if it's too thick. I added extra garlic just because my family loves garlic, but I can imagine it would be great with any fun additions.  We plan to try sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and cilantro jalapeno in the future.  Also, to make it smooth and creamy, it is well worth it to take the time to remove the skin from the beans.  You will be glad you did!

Took me three sittings but I got it! Definitely use the chickpea water to thin, pasty otherwise. I used a pesto mix with basil, garlic scapes, sage, pine nuts and a bit of olive oil and mixed that into the hummus, and also added cumin and a little red pepper. This was awesome, but I didn't use measurements so I hope I can replicate!

I personally omit the paprika and parsley and right before serving drizzle a little evoo on top. I DO NOT recommend using a food processor, at least with mine...I still had small bits of the beans, the blender works out much better for me.

This was so great, fresh and delicious, makes you never want to buy hummus again after eating this. We did not have the tahini so we used sesame oil and it was good.

I've made this a couple of times now and liked it better the 2nd time since I used a different type of Tahini and took most of the shells off the garbanzos by rolling them between moistened paper towels.  I served this and the Red Pepper Hummus at a party and the Red Pepper Hummus was the more popular of the two. So, because of that and because it hasn't "WOWED" me yet, I'm giving it 4 stars. I will continue to make this, tweaking it to my liking.

The best hummus I have ever had (including in restaurants).  The secret is to process the ingredients until they are really smooth and silky.

I love love love this recipe. I make it on a weekly basis starting with garbanzo beans that I buy in the bulk section at my health food store and then soak overnight and then cook up the next day. It's much healthier more economical that way so I can buy the tahini brand I want. This recipe is very tweak friendly and I have enjoyed try different spices like cumin to give it a different flavor depending on what I'm craving. Next time I'm going to try a red bell pepper version. One thing I ALWAYS do is drizzle good olive oil in the food processor as it's blending and I also add plenty of my bean juice from cooking. You do need to add some form of liquid or it will be much to dry. Thanks for the recipe RC2STEP! It's GREAT!!!

This is a very good easy recipe.  The only thing I did different was I left out the tahini.  I didn't have any.  It was very good without it.  I am not sure how much olive oil I used, I just drizzled it in the blender while running until it was the consistancy I wanted.  Will make this often.  Better than store bought!

Def. agree with other reviews.  Use slightly less tahini, use 3/4 can of garbanzo bean liquid, and up the garlic.  Yummy!!!

Just got myself a blender to make dips and was excited to try my hand at making hummus. Thanks for the tips on the tahini. I thought it was strange to use so much. I'm going to try it with roasted garlic and roasted red peppers - yummy!

I made mine like this: I used two CANS of garbanzo beans, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 3 cloves garlic, dash of salt to taste, and approx. 1/3 cup sweet red peppers from a jar. I didn't have any parsley or paprika. I used approximately 2-2.5 Tbsp olive oil. I saved the liquid from the beans and added some back to get the consistency I wanted. I put it all in a blender until smooth and it came out so perfect. I served it with some Cuban bread slices and some baked cracker chips. It was really delicious. Even my boyfriend's brother, who doesn't like anything, tried it  and liked it so much he went out and bought more cracker chips so we wouldn't run out during the game.

This hummus recipe is absolutely amazing!! I made it and brought it to a tailgater and everyone scooped it up and raved about how great it tasted. I never knew that making hummus was so simple. I had some trouble finding Tahini at Safeway, but a trip to Whole Foods saved the day. Thanks for the recipe! I wouldn't change a thing about it, except for adding more garlic cloves or seasoning to suit your taste.

I used this recipe as a base.  I continued to play with the ingredients until it reminded me of a hummus I tried in NYC.  I bought traditional tahini from a middle eastern store so it was very strong in taste so i ended up adding more garbanzo beans to balance the flavor.

This is a great recipe.  The kids would inhale the small containers of Hummus bought at the store and I would be lucky to get a few chips worth.  I whipped this up tonight, added a bit too much garlic (whew!), but all in all it was great.  I had a bowl for myself, the kids had a bowl, and there is still some left but not for long since I see the kids heading into the kitchen for more.  It doesn't take much to put this together and you can count on it that I'll be making this more often.  Thanks for a great recipe.  The store bought has nothing on this homemade version plus there is plenty to go around.  Yeah!

So great.  Even my wife (who historically does not like hummus) loves this recipe.  You have to like garlic for enjoy this, but we’re garlic-fiends so it’s perfect for us.  We use it primarily as a dip with corn chips or carrot sticks.  Very easy to make.  Can be hard to find the tahini, we had to go to a grocery store that’s known for organic food to find it.

For my first hummus, this was EXCELLENT! I followed advice of many other reviewers and reserved the garbanzo bean juice for the end, which I ended up using about half of to get a smoother consistency, which is how my wife and I like our hummus. I'll experiment with additional ingredients next time, which will probably be in only a day or two because I know this won't last long! THANKS!

Very good recipe.  I had to add extra oil and a little water to get a looser consistency (it was too thick).  I added some cilantro, extra garlic, soy sour cream and extra lemon juice...EXCELLENT!!!

Like many others I will never buy store bought hummus again.  I tweaked this recipe to my families taste but the recipe alone was delicious.  I have made this now a couple of times.  The first time was for an appetizer for a dinner party.  One review said that a recommended shelling the beans.  While tedious I think it worked better for me because I was using my blender to process.  The next time I did not shell the beans and it took quite a bit longer to make.  Regardless this recipe is a keeper!

This recipe can't possibly be correct (I followed it exactly). If you use this much tahini it ends up making "hummus" that tastes like peanut butter with the consistency of wood putty. I would never follow this recipe again.

Nothing to add to the other reviews. I'd use less tahini and lemon juice at first, then add more to taste. Easier to add than to take away.

My first time making hummus.  I had no idea how easy it is.  I may just make home-made hummus exclusively from now on.  As for the recipe, with a bit of tweaking I think my next batch could be amazing.

I made this for a party. It tasted great but it was too dry so it didn't stick to the pretzel chips or pita chips we dipped in it. Next time I make this I think I'll try adding the liquid from one of the cans of garbanzos.

By far the BEST hummus recipe we've found. And sooo easy to make!  The only thing missing is the roasted red bell pepper. I mix in half a pepper with this recipe.  LOVE IT! We'll never buy hummus again!

I came back from Israel and had a craving for some hummus - this was just what I was looking for. I've made this a few times and everyone loves it!  The last time, I added some cumin and fresh cilantro - so good!  Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to do 1/2 of the recipe at a time becaue my food processor is not big enough, and I'm glad I did because I tasted it and thought it was salty enough....therefore I only put in 1/2 of the lemon juice, garlic, and salt that the recipe called for.  It was a hit with the entire family though!  I will definately make again!

Better than the store-bought stuff! I used 3Tbs of lemon, 3Tbs of tahini, and 1Tbs of cumin. You should adjust to your liking, but this is a great basic recipe to start with!

Good starter recipe. I made it as is and didn't like it (too much tahini) but I followed the other reviews and added three extra garlic cloves, lots of extra olive oil and lemon juice, cayenne and cumin. Thought it was excellent after the adjustments.

I made the recipe using the ingredients listed (making my own tahini equivalent and mixing the olive oil in completely rather than layering it on top).  I found it needed a little something more so I took a couple suggestions from other reviewers: added a roasted/peeled red pepper to add color, and I added a generous tsp chili peppers. Glad I reserved the liquid in the cans of beans because it definitely needed it - I probably added between 1/2  to 1/3 of the reserve to get a consistency I liked. I recommend letting Hummus sit a couple of hours at least to better develop and amalgamate the flavors.
Served with Peppy's Pita Bread - got raves all round.

Excellent recipe!  I added a bit more garlic, some smoked red peppers finely chopped, a bit more lemon juice and added some olive oil as I was blending.  GREAT flavor!  Thanks so much for the recipe RC2STEP!

This is the first time I've ever made hummus.  I did make a mistake, though.  I used two cans of drained garbanzos instead of two cups.  I didn't have a food processor, so I used my blender.  It came out perfectly.  Much cheaper to make yourself and way better tasting.

Not good. My best guess is that the recipe is intended to read "2 cans" instead of "2 cups canned", because 2 cups of beans makes this recipe into a lemon garlic bomb.

What's funny is all of the 5 star ratings that never even tried the recipe as written.  They all list the modifications they made.

Stay away from this recipe, or try 2 cans of beans instead of 2 cups.

Great recipe!  Per other reviews I used less tahini and added cumin.  No need to buy the store hummus anymore.

This was an excellent recipe for hummus but I found it a little bit too salty. Next time I would use 3/4 tsp salt. And make sure you blend it in the food processor long enough to make it extra creamy!

This is my first time making hummus and I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to buy tahini!  I will be making this regularly. As others suggested, I used only 2 tablespoons of tahini and a little less lemon juice to suit my taste. Can't wait to make some with roasted red peppers added!

At first taste I wasn't so sure about this, but then I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and it tasted great. My only complaint is that I didn't have any pita bread to go with it.
The recipe was really simple. My only alterations were adding a tiny bit of cumin, a bit more liquid, and using garbanzos that I cooked myself instead of canned.
It also made a great spread for falafel sandwiches the next day. Thank you for posting this :-)

My husband promptly declared, "I'd 5-star that!"  He also added, "This is the best hummus I've had in my life - and I've had a lot of hummus!"  'Nuff said.  :)  (Note:  I did need to add a little juice from the garbanzo beans, as it was difficult to blend, it was so thick.)

Good basic recipe. But I modified it to my taste, which is more lemon, garlic and olive oil.

Delicious!  I'd never made hummus before but we eat a LOT of it, so I decided to try this recipe.  I made it pretty much as is and it was so much better than store-bought hummus.  It's also MUCH cheaper (the tahini is costly, but a little goes a long way and you can make many batches with one jar).  The only thing I did differently is add a decent amount of the juice from the garbanzo beans and a little more lemon juice to make it smoother and not as dry.  What a great base - I plan to make it again and play around with it by adding different ingredients such as artichoke, spinach, roasted red peppers or olives.  What fun!

This is a great basic hummus recipe. I was glad I read the first review before preparing ....it calls for 2 cups of beans not two cans! This makes about 1 1/2 cups. I do not get the people who wish to make 1/2 a recipe, bc I eat that much by myself LOL! Once you buy the tahini paste (i found in the health food section and it keeps for a long time in the frig) it is such a quick and easy recipe to whip up time and time again.  I like that you can add extras to your liking...cumin, red pepper flakes, roasted red peppers.  I am looking forward to trying black olives too like the store bought. AND ITS A HEALTHY SNACK!

This was okay.  It tasted really good, but it was a little dry.  Not sure if I did something wrong, but I was sad about that.  The taste, though, really was worth putting this together.

I can't believe how easy, healthy, tasty, and inexpensive this is!  If you use dried garbanzo beans, soaked in water for a day, then simmered in a slow cooker over night... that cute the cost down to pennies a serving!

Awesome!! Use less tahini and add red pepper for better flavor. Tip: Where I live, nobody sells tahini, so I use 4 tbs 100% pure sesame oil and omit the olive oil. Also, if you're making it in a blender, it had better be an extremely powerful one if you want it to be kinda like a mayonaise consistency. Adding the liquid helps.

This is the first time I've made hummus and I was very happy.  I used dry beans (about 1 cup dry made 3 cups after cooking) and kept the tahini, lemon juice, and salt the same as the recipe calls for.  I added a bit extra garlic and about half of a roasted red pepper.  My husband and I used half of the recipe for lunch with fresh veggies and pita chips.  It was the best hummus I've ever had and it was so easy to make, even using the dried beans.

Usually when I make hummus, I don't use tahini, as it's pretty fatty, but I decided I wanted to try making a more traditional hummus this time. It was quite tasty and our company liked it. I didn't see enough difference with the tahini to make it worth the fat to me. It's fun to mix it up with the hummus sometimes and add cilantro, jalapeño, sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, cayenne, green chilis or any number of things that coordinate with the meal or whatever you're taste buds are asking for. :) Served it with sliced up veggies of carrots, red peppers and celery.

Being a fan of simple tastes without over-complexity (recipes lose something when too complex) I found this recipie absolutely divine. While others are saying to reserve the chickpea juice for adding later, I found that this only "waters down" the hummus; a perfectly good solution is simply adding more olive oil - just drizzle it in when the food processor is doing it's magic. Yes, it's a bit more rich but doesn't sacrifice flavor - good thing it's healthy. The obvious has already been states by others: make the recipie your own - all good chefs experiment and find what's suitable to their palate. Overall great recipie and brilliant taste! Well done.

This was very good - and it's very cheap to make. I will never buy the store brand again. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I will listen to other reviews and use some of the juices from the can to make it a little more moist. I will also add more garlic, because hey! I LOVE GARLIC!!  I like to put a few katamala olives on top before serving.

Delicious and easy! I just used 2 cans of garbanzo beans instead of meauring 2 cups. Be sure and add 1/2 tsp of cumin for a more authentic taste. I'm taking it to a pot luck tonight with a fresh veggie plate. Impressive but simple! Thanks!

Never had home made before, now I won't eat any other then home made, this recipe rocks! I fire roasted a bell pepper and added it, to mine, but other than that (Oh extra garlic), followed the recipe to the letter, thanks so much for a keeper recipe.

Two comments:  hummus is not ready to serve in 10 minutes.  It must be chilled for two hours for the flavors to blend.  I also add a tsp of Aleppo pepper for a little kick.

Five stars since this is a great foundational recipe with all the basic ingredients. I did reduce the tahini to 1/4 c, reduced lemon juice to 3 Tbsp, because I like it less bitter and less sour. From this basic recipe, you can make your own style. I cooked my own beans (soak overnight, rinse, boil in fresh water about 1.5 hours) added fresh cilantro, cumin, more garlic, more olive oil, and more salt since the beans were fresh and not canned where sodium is already added. I took it to a large party. Several hummus lovers felt it is one of the best ones they'd had (even better than their own recipes!) and several hummus haters were converted. I serve it with baby carrots.

Perfect. I was looking for a straightforward hummus recipe that included tahini, and the proportions for this recipe are just right. I made it with a "green goo" I found on another site - an oily, delicious puree of parsely, jalapeno, garlic, olive oil, and salt. Homemade hummus is SO much better than store bought!!

This is a superb recipe. I have made it several times, and suggest these changes: 1. 1 lb. dried beans (2-1/3 cup dry) = 6 cups soaked overnight = 4 cans (drained). Multiply ingredients accordingly to use more beans and yield more hummus. The changes below are for the original size of 1 can (2 cups) drained beans 2. If you use dried beans, soak them overnight (8 hrs.) or quick soak (boil for 2 min., then soak 1 hr. in the hot water). Then cook for 2-3 hours, until soft. 3. Add 1 tsp cumin. 4. For added flavor and heat (plus some color), add cayenne (1/3 tsp recommended, with no more than 1 tsp). 5. For thinner hummus, add 1/4 to 1/3 cup non-fat plain yogurt. 6. The garlic can be left out, if you prefer, with the dish still being very flavorful.

My first homemade hummus, and it got rave reviews.  I read somewhere that to make a creamier hummus, boil the chickpeas and remove as many of the little 'shells' as possible (or have patience for).  I did that, and used a bit of garlic powder instead of cloves.  A great recipe for hummus beginners- I'll be checking out the rest of the reviews to add upon it next time.

with a few minor tweaks I loved this hummus.  I added more lemon (cause we love the tanginess it adds) and some water to get it to the consistency I like (next time I'll keep the liquid the chick peas are in and use that instead of water - I forgot to keep it this time!).

Those of you from the Chicagoland area have probably heard of Pita Inn (the most popular mediterranean restaurant around.) They have the best hummus and this recipe has *almost* the exact same taste. My friend is the wife of the owner of Pita Inn and I asked her how they make their hummus so creamy/smooth instead of grainy/lumpy. She said the trick is to 1. use fresh chickpeas instead of canned -- soak them overnight in tons of warm water and a tsp of baking soda and salt, then boil them the next day until completely mushy. Reserve some liquid for the blending. And 2. use a good, heavy duty machine. The fresh chickpeas really did make a world of a difference. I also thought 2 cloves of garlic was too much, so I only used 1 the 2nd time. Much better. Also, if you're looking for an extra kick, paprika might not do it. Try a pinch of chili powder or roast and grind some fresh cumin seeds.

This is an awesome hummus recipe! I have made it about a dozen times now. Recently I tried soaking and using dried garbanzo beans instead of canned and it came even better. The text was really smooth and the color was better than with canned beans.  Make sure you have an good blender or mixer or else it may take awhile to get it all blended together.   As other reviewers have said, add the tahini and lemon juice a little at a time to taste. The first few times I made it the tahini was overpowering.

Made this for my husband and I who love Hummus--I used some minced garlic for the top with olive oil and also added some garlic powder--it was better than the store.  No need for me to buying store brand any longer....thank you!

The first time I made this recipe (several years ago) I used the full 1/3 cup of tahini, and I hadn't made it since because I thought it was pretty unremarkable. This time I reduced the tahini to 2 tablespoons like everyone suggested, and it was perfect! Now I'm definitely going to be making this more often!

I thought that this hummus was alright. It is a good basic hummus, but I thought that it lacked in flavor a bit. I added a lot more garlic. I would make it again, but next time I would throw some more spices in there.

This was really good.  The lemon was a little strong at first, but compared to other's I've eaten it was awesome.  I bought some hummus afterwards and realized I liked this one much better.

As many other reviewers had done, I played a bit with the recipe and followed other reviewers' suggestions: used 3 full tbsp tahini instead of 1/3 cup, added cumin, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and 1 tbsp olive oil in the mixture, used the bean juice to control the texture. I also ended up adding more garlic and lemon juice until I liked the taste.  The result was great!  I am never buying hummus again!  It is so easy to make and really easy to adjust the taste until it's perfect!

Hummus, like spaghetti sauce or chili, is something you make your own way to suit personal taste. There really isn't a "right" or "wrong" way. I used 2 cans chick peas drained (reserved juice to thin out hummus), 2 TBPS tahini, 2TBS lemon juice, 1 1/2 TBSP olive oil. Added ground cayenne pepper for heat, then tested & added more until it was the right level of spice. Added paprika, salt & black pepper to taste. Used approx 1/2 cup chick pea juice from can to thin out texture. This turned out nicely. Simple recipe. Good for Lent went we Catholics can't eat meat on Fridays!

Wow!  Seriously good.  I have the Summerfresh Foods hummus recipe, and this is WAY better (and way healthier!!!)  I only used 1 can of rinsed chick peas, water instead of their juice, roasted my garlic (5 cloves,) added (1/4ts)cumin and (1-2ts)red chili flakes, and the zest of the lemon along with the juice.  This is THE hummus (Megan.)

I wish I never made this...everywhere I go people are always requesting me to make this now!! If you are a garlic lover add another clove. It was great! I just added the olive oil while it was in the processor still. If you want it to be less thick then just add more olive oil.

This was my first time making hummus (but not eating it!), and I was very happy with the result.  I didn't have tahini available so I left it out, and I tweaked the amount of salt (half the amount), lemon juice (3/4 of the amount), and garlic (doubled).  I think this is a good base recipe that can be adjusted according to your personal preferences.  I also used cumin in place of paprika.  Very good with wheat crackers.

This recipe has way too much tahini and comes out thick and bland.  I read the reviews about the recipe that call for less tahini and I agree.  However, the recipe as written was not palatable to me.

The perfect "base hummus" recipe. The only thing I changed was add a pinch of extra salt. You can add jalapenos or dill or sundried tomatoes....anything, really.

This was really good.  I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it!  I garnished it with sundried tomatoes that I put through my food processor along with crumbled goat cheese on top and served it with pita chips, and various veggies.

This is the best hummus I've ever had! I made a couple of adjustments, though: I added 1/6 tsp of ground red pepper and used about 1/3 of the reserved liquid from the can of garbanzo beans. 

EDIT: Having made this at least half a dozen times, I've discovered some awesome add-ins: seasoned sun-dried tomatoes (the kind that come packed in oil), toasted walnut paste, cumin, and garam masala, though not necessarily all together at once. Just blend some in with the rest of the ingredients, and you get custom hummus. I make this all the time and take some to campus to eat with pita for lunch.

This is the first time I've made hummus, and I must say that it was simple and very flavorful. I found that it was FAR too salty, and the second time I made it, added no salt, and the salt from the garbanzo beans was plenty. I also saved some bean juice to add while blending, and also added a dollop of olive oil. Even better the next day or two, this has become a staple in our house!
EDIT: After making this for ages, I've discovered that if you add more bean juice while blending, it's a good idea to add a splash more lemon juice, since the bean juice kind of makes it not as potent. LOVE this hummus, it's become a staple in our house!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  This recipe is so easy and flavorful.  This hummus will definitely grace my appetizer table every time and I am going to keep some in the fridge for a healthy delicious snack.  I did add a bit of the garbanzo bean juice and about a teaspoon of olive oil to the food processor and I obtained such a nice smooth consistancy.  Absolutely wonderful!

I added some red pepper flakes and more garlic because I prefer more flavor. I also reserved some of the liquid and used a little over half of it because it was too thick. I prefer a really creamy texture and I still haven't found a recipe that is as good as some I have purchased. Thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making hummus and it was incredibly easy and absolutely wonderful! I was making it for a crowd, so I blended 2 (15.5 oz) cans of garbanzo beans (reserving the liquid of one can), into the recipe's amount of tahini, lemon juice, and other seasonings. I added a couple tablespoons of olive oil and extra garbanzo liquid until it blended properly, and it turned out so well! (For the record, it made nearly 3 1/2 cups of hummus, so it was perfect for a crowd!) Also, I thought I had paprika on my shelf, but didn't, so I just served it with olive oil and dried parsley on top. (I've also had hummus with feta cheese sprinkled over the top and it does taste great, but this recipe was so good on it's own, it didn't need any extra flavor!) Now that I'm a proud owner of a whole jar of tahini, I'll definitely make this more often! ;-)

just a thought, one of my friends, who is arabic, adds yogurt to thin hummus down a bit, as it tends to dry out if left in the fridge for a couple of days, while getting used up,i tend to do this as routine now.

This was horrible.  The overall consistency was way too thick and the tahini overpowered it.  We ended up scrapping it because no one cared for it.

I guess if you are used to store bought Hummus this recipe would appeal to you as it has similar flavors. I live near several authentic Middle Eastern Restaurants, and this doesn't taste very authentic. It has way too much Tahini and Lemon. It does taste a little better the next day, but I was expecting it to be much great based on past reviews. Does anyone know where I can find an more authentic recipe?

Yum - how easy!  There is a farmer's market here in Irvine, CA that has awesome hummus.  Their best selling is the Avocado & Cilantro! So, I thought why not?  First I made the base, then added 1 medium ripe hass avocado (chopped) and about 1/2 a cilantro bunch to the processor, let it sit for an hour and yum!  Even better than at the farmer's market!  

Next time, I'd add a tablespoon of water so it will be more creamy.

Too much salt.  Cut the salt in half.  I also added the oil, parsley, and paprika to it to moisten it.  Before I did that it was okay.  Afterwards it was much better.

Yum Yum!  This was so good and easy too.  I made it for my book club along with some fresh pita.  I doubled the garlic and just added lemon to taste.  It doesn't have the bitter taste like the ones in the supermarket.  Very tasty!  I also spent the time to remove the invisible husks around each bean. It made the hummus very smooth.  I will keep making this one!

Excellent and very easy. I used almond butter instead of the tahini and it was still great. If you have a lousy food processor, pre-chop your garlic THEN add the rest of your ingredients.

This is delicious hummus. I didn't have lemons so I used apple cidar vinegar. Definitely use a food processor, not a blender, as I tried this in both a Cuisinart blender and a Krups blender and finally gave up and hauled out the big Cuisinart food processor to process this recipe. Very delicious!

This was really good after I added more...such as: liquid from the beans, more lemon juice, LOTS more garlic, some cumin and ground red pepper for a bit of zing.  Had I not, this would have been a thick, thick blah dip.  I added the oil to the mixture instead of drizzling it on top as well.  I know everyone has their own tastes, but this needed more.  After all that....great dip!

I followed the recipe exactly when I made this dish and to be honest, I've had better store bought hummus. It needs more lemon juice and garlic and far LESS of the tahini. The tahini completely overpowered all other flavours. I made this about 3 hrs before I served it and the flavours still hadn't blended well. I won't make this again.

Yum!!!  This was awesome!  I'm addicted!  It was so easy.  I'm awful at cooking so if I can make this anyone can! I did find that you should add some of the liquid from the beans into the mix and also put in 1/2 tsp. of cumin and only 2 Tbsp. of Tahini instead of 1/3 cup.  I also threw in some cayenne red pepper for a kick.  Thanks

Made this last night.  Way too thick, way too bland.  Should have read other reviews.  I plan to thin it out today with chick pea juice or olive oil.  Also, since it was lacking in flavor, I will add cumin and ground red pepper as suggested in other reviews.  Hopefully this will make it taste better.  Thanks anyway.

Fast to make, and flavorful!  And so easy in a food processor.  I've made this a number of times, and the only change I've made is to add more olive oil during processing to thin the consistency slightly, so it's scoopable with pita slices.  It's definitely a denser texture than store bought, but much better flavor.

This recipe is great! Much like everyone else, I agree that it is a little thick and you need to use some reserved liquid from the beans.  I don't agree that it needs more lemon or garlic even.  I added an extra clove and it was too much. I did add cumin as someone else suggested which gave it more depth of flavour. If you are using a blender, try putting everything in a bowl and do it half at a time in the blender.  Much easier than fighting with the blender.

Wonderful!  I, too, reduced the tahini to 2 tablespoons, and it was perfect!  I added the olive oil to the mixture to make it smoother. Also, be sure and reserve the liquid from the beans - I add about 1/4 cup to the mixture while blending.  I reduced the lemon juice just a little after making this a few times because it was slightly overpowering.  I serve it with pita wedges, baby carrots, celery, small dill pickles, and cherry tomatoes.  I always get compliments on this dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although it was a bit of a chore to whip this up in my 10-speed blender, the end result proved delicious and was a real hit along with the recipe for pita chips from this site.

This is Great!! I made it with fresh lemon juice and served it on grilled Bagettees. My husband usually hates this kind of food and he raved about it. I will make this again for parties, freinds or just to snack on during the day.

This was a pretty tasty hummus recipe.  I added double the garlic (as usual) and used dried chickpeas that were rehydrated and boiled.  It had a slightly different texture, but it was still yummy.  Now all I need is a really good babaganoosh recipe!

This is the best hummus I've ever had!  As suggested in previous reviews, I reduced the tahini to about 2 Tbs; after tasting, I agree that more than that would have been too much.  I also added red chili flakes for some kick, and a bit of curry powder.  The only thing I will do differently next time will be to use fresh lemon juice rather than bottled.  Thanks for the recipe!

This hummus is soooo good.  I add a little salt to mine, and also add the oil when I'm blending it up.  Especially good with the pita triangles.  I ate so much I'm sick.

Great flavor.  I like hummus really smooth so I ended up adding a little more oil and lemon juice to get the consistancy to where I wanted it.  But really tasty!

YUM - YUM!!  This tasted almost identical to the one I buy from my favorite
resteraunt.  I also reduced the tahini (I used 2 Tablespoons) and used the juice of a 
of a real lemon.  It was EXCELLENT!!!!  I'm so glad I can make it whenever I 
have the craving.  Warmed pita bread is a MUST!!

Yummy! I was in a hurry, but couldn't find tahini anywhere, so I substituted unsalted/unsweetened cashew butter, which has a similar consistency. Still delicious! I also added bean juice for smoothness.

I didn't have lemon so used the juice of one lime instead and really liked the difference that made! I also added a couple pinches of cumin as others have recommended.

I come from a Lebanese family and there was always hummus around for snacks to eat with vegetables.
I think this a wonderful recipe.  I add a little olive oil to the mixture while I am making it.  This is as good as my Lebanese Aunt Sally makes.  Make as written and you won't be disappointed.

I've made this several times now, it's a huge hit. you'll never buy pre packaged again. With my changes it's close to Beirut Restaurant's in Detroit. (http://beirutrestaurant.net/index.html) The only three adjustments. 1. Don't discard your juices from your beans, adding some of it will give you the right consistency. 2. I suggest is to cut back on your Tahini by half to start. Add a little more to adjust to taste.  3. Always use fresh lemons for your juice, it makes a total difference !

I've made this a couple of times and haven't rated it so, it's time.  I'd never made hummus before, but I've had it many times.  I like this recipe and have made it with dried garbanzo beans (using the soaking method) and also using canned beans.  I did cook the canned beans this time with a bit of baking soda for approx. 20 min., rinsed and the hulls were removed.  I made my own tahini, used roasted garlic (extra, added cumin and used fresh lemon juice.  This was nice for the Super Bowl party this year...I served with raw carrots, celery and pita chips.  Liked by everyone.

First shot at making hummus on my own and it was a hit!  I added in 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and added half of a pan seared red pepper.  No complaints!

When I made this recipe, I only used a dash of salt & it tasted great.  Looking at the recipe, I thought 1 teaspoon was too much salt and not needed (I made this recipe to avoid the sodium that most store bought hummus contain). Other than cutting way back on the salt, this is a very good recipe.

I used to work at a Greek restaurant where I was introduced to hummus. I became a fan but I no longer work there and I moved far away so I haven't had hummus in a while. This recipe tastes very similar to the hummus they served at the restaurant. I am so happy this hummus actually tastes like restaurant quality food.

It was pretty tasty, but I added twice as much garlic and a good big splash more of lemon juice. I also thinned it down a bit with water. Tahini was strong so next time will knock that amount down a tad. Very close to my favorite store brand though. Yumm...

I think many will like it, but I thought it had too much tahini, it gave it a little too much bitterness- I thought it needed a bit more lemon, too.  But it was good, people will tweak it to their liking!  I also couldn't get it as smooth as I like, I may try peeling the skins off the chickpeas next time just to see if that helps.

Luv this recipe. I didn't have parsley, so I used dried basil. It was good. My family likes a lot of lemon and spice, so I used 1/2 a cup lemon and added 1-2 tsp of chile pepper.

This hummus was delicious!  I omitted salt to reduce sodium, and I added a little bean-cooking liquid to thin the hummus.  I would make no other changes.  The homemade tahini from this site was perfect for this recipe.  The hummus, tomato, and onion sandwiches I made were excellent.  Thanks, I'll be making this again!

Made this for my daughter to take to school for a Greek lesson. It was ok. I added more olive oil because is was so dry. Then my daughter wanted more of a garlic flavor so she added a few more cloves not sure how many but she loved it. Her classmates not so much. Have not decided if this is a keeper.

I make hummus quite often now that I found this recipe.  I should have posted a review earlier, since I've been using this as my base for several years now.  Like others, I reduce the amount of tahini (I use a heaped tablespoon) and I use whatever juice I get from half a fresh squeezed lemon plus extra liquid from the can of beans.  I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes and dill(!!) to the hummus.

I agree with 2 cans of beans, at least another clove of garlic, thinning this a bit, but I do love this recipe.  All changes obviously suit our individual tastes but for heavens sake, if you are making this wonderful dish you can easily make the tahini and save a ton of cash.  Tahini is nothing more than 3-4 C toasted sesame seeds and 1/4 to 1/2 C olive oil mixed in a VitaMix or your processor adjusted to your taste!  It'll last a month or so in your fridge.  It's worth the price of toasted seeds from MySpiceSage.com or from your favorite spice vendor.  If you want to toast them yourself, you can buy them raw and have a ball.  You can prep your tahini to the consistency of any nut butter or thinner as you wish.  Although I don't prep my own beans for this, I still like controlling the ingredients of this dish.  I try to avoid canned food so I expect I will also be prepping from dried beans soon and avoid the canned chemicals.  I can't say enough about this wonderful, easily prepared, dish.  You can start from scratch and make a whole lot more for a whole lot less!  I don't eat snacks but I will make an exception for this.  It's great with raw vegetables.

This recipe is very similar to my Greek mother’s recipe with some minor differences: my mom usually drains the beans but saves some liquid in case the dip turns out dry (which it almost always does). She also adds 2 teaspoons more of lemon juice and a little bit of olive oil directly to the food processor. The rest is exactly the same. I love this dip with pita chips and makes a perfect appetizer along with tabbouleh.

I doubled, and roasted, the garlic. Used soaked dry beans rather than canned. I also used 1/3 cup lemon juice (rather than 1/4 cup). I also threw in a 1/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes and topped it with chopped cilantro, rather than parsley (as it's what was in the fridge).

very good tasting and super easy to make. the only thing I did different is use garbanzo beans that I cooked from dry. oh, and I mixed the parsley and paprika right in instead of putting it on top.

I am so lucky I live in Brooklyn.  Atlantic Avenue is a haven for Middle Eastern Food.  There I found Tahini.  Fresh and amazingly made.  Made this exactly.  Added a tiny bit of cayenne pepper for added kick.  This is amazing.  And Healthy.  Thank you for this simple but amazing recipe

Delicious hummus recipe.  I made the following adjustments.  First, I used 2 cans of chickpeas, reserving the liquid.  I processed the chickpeas alone in the food processor for a few minutes until they were smooth.  Then I added 1/2 cup tahini, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1 tsp salt.  I processed it again for about 3-4 minutes until it was smooth and creamy.  So good!

I love plain hummus, without all the extra flair, and this was it! A traditional, basic hummus! I did go old school and soak dried chickpeas for a day in some salted water, drained, and then brought to a boil in more salted water and left to simmer for about 3 hours. I personally, after the first batch, would drop the tahini to 1/4c and the lemon juice to about 1/8c, would add in some of the juice the chickpeas boiled in and as always, I added more garlic. Absolutly wonderful!!!

like everyone, i adjusted this based on what I had on hand etc--I highly recommend using dried chickpeas and not canned. it takes longer but the flavor is MUCH better than canned.  I did as one person suggested and froze some in muffin tins-1 lb of dried chickpeas makes a LOT of hummus!

The salt can be halved and the oil eliminated.  Vegetables can also be added to improve nutritional value, but this is really good hummus just plain, or with extra lemon juice.

This is a good basic recipe.  I've been wanting to make hummus since my go to place makes it way to salty.  This would taste like theirs if they had it right.  I agree though that it is a basic recipe.  I followed another reviewer's advice, and added cumin...1t seemed to be right.  I also added cayenne for just a touch of heat.  I still feel like it's missing something.  I'll keep experimenting.  I know that adding a bit of olive oil to the hummus while blending will improve the consistency, but 1T as the reviewer suggested doesn't seem like it will do much, and adding water seems to work fine.  I can't wait to try the other alterations.

I agree with the other reviews that you can kind of alter the amounts to your liking which is nice, but it is good as is.  I'm only giving it four stars because while it's good, it didn't wow me.  I think I'll prefer a hummus with more/different flavor like roasted red pepper hummus.  It's next on my list.

This is a pretty good recipe however, in my opinion this is too much sesame tahini and too little lemon juice. Sesame Tahini can be a bit bitter if its over used. I also put a bit more olive oil in mine. This is a great starter recipe for someone who hasn't made hummus before.

I have never made hummus before so this was my first time trying it homemade.  It was outstanding!  I highly recommend this and will probably never go back to store bought.

I failed to read other reviews before I started on this one, so I have nobody to blame but myself for my so-so outcome!  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time), I will definitely add less tahini and probably a little extra garlic.  I added some roasted red peppers to mine (because I love the flavor) and I think that helped with the tahini overload!

I'm a starving college student and I love humus but tahini is just so expensive and I don't use it in anything else. So when I made this I put in two tablespoons of Greek yogurt (it was on sale) and two tablespoons of feta cheese (that I "borrowed" from my parents the last time I was home). I also followed others recommendations and added some of the left over chickpea juice. This recipe is delicious, even the cheap way!

Some reviewers have suggested using the liquid from the chickpeas to thin the hummus.  Read the ingredients on the can.  If it contains EDTA, it is best to rinse and discard.  The liquid also contains extra sodium.  Add extra lemon juice or plain water to thin.  Cumin is a nice addition to hummus.  I would add a tsp to this recipe.

This is seriously good. I did have a hard time finding the tahini - it was the grocery store for $10. I looked at the health foods store and found it for just under $8. I definitely think it made this hummus though. I will definitely make this again.

this humus is amazing! Only thing I did different was added more olive oil. No way the amount written is enough.  About 1/2 cup for 8 servings.

My husband and I love hummus, and we have never made it ourselves. We made this recipe and are head over heals in love with it. Simple and quick, and depending on the brand of beans, has a wonderful texture and taste.

Awesome and easy! I couldn't find "tahini" at the store but instead found "tahina." I'm quite sure it's the same thing (says 100% sesame paste) and it tasted awesome. Adjustments: Used 3 T of tahina, added 2 cloves of garlic, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a pinch or two of cumin, threw the parsley in with the the other ingredients instead of garnish, a pinch of lemon zest (don't add unless you love love LOVE lemons/sour). I used 1 can (15oz) of garbanzo beans and just eye-balled the liquid (add this slowly until you get the consistency you like). Awesome recipe!

Great recipe for a first-time hummus maker.  So easy to make!  Made the tahini (1/2 c. roasted sesame seeds & 1/4 c. olive oil, whirred until the consistency of chunky peanut butter) in the food processor first, and then followed the recipe as is.  Only negative is that the hummus is less smooth than store-bought -- but that is OK!

This comes out really thick, so I added 1/3-1/2 can of the retained garbanzo bean juice. Also, a few splashes of HOT sauce gives it a wonderful afterburn :)

This is the best hummus I've ever had! Though I did add cayenne pepper and cumin (lots of cumin). Definitely keep the juices from the beans to mix into your preferred consistancy!

This recipe worked very well for me, I took into consideration the advice and suggestions of fellow AllRecipe cooks and my first ever batch of Hummus turned out great, I made enough to fill a small casserole dish, about 4 cups worth. I sprinkled some fresh lemon, and olive oil over top and refrigerated for a few hours.

A big hit, will play around with this and make different versions like Roasted red pepper, or perhaps a chipoltle ?

I thought this tasted pretty good and was quick to make up. I made 1/2 recipe, with the calculate button, and I only needed to open up one can of garbanzo beans. The only thing I didn't care for was how thick it seemed, which is just personal preference I believe. It tasted great with some flavored baked pita chips.

This will be my go to recipe for hummus.Good proportions of all ingredients - then you can add roasted red pepper or olives as you like. Thanks for sharing! It could also be made substituting black beans or black eyed peas.

Don't make in a blender! What a mess. If you have a processor, go that route. Yummy! You NEED the tahini to give it the flavor boost!

Yummy!! This beats store-bought anyday! I added cumin like others suggested and went to 3 stores before I found tahini, which I finally found in the peanut butter aisle. This one is a keeper!

Excellent!! Better than any hummus I've ever tasted! I did add the roasted red peppers, just a few, and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes as suggested. Everyone at the party raved over it! I did think it could use less lemon juice, though, but still awesome recipe!

This was simply DELICIOUS! I did use a little of the reserved juice from the chickpeas because it was a bit too thick to blend... and I do mean WAS... I ate it all within 3 days... mmm ;)

I have made this a few times now and everytime it gets better and better. I did read over some of the reviews because I felt it need a little spice and some extra flavor so I added red pepper, and cumin. Also I put about half the lemon juice it asks for because I felt it was a little sour for my liking.

I like this hummus.  It was very flavorful.  Still looking for how to make it a bit less thick.  The ones we buy at the store are much more creamy and spreadable.  Still, an easy, good recipe.

It was a little bland, so I added more garlic, some cumin, chili powder, more paprika, and more salt. It also needed less lemon juice than the recipe called for...which I will remember for next time. But it is a great recipe and will make it again!

This was a very easy and good recipe for Hummus.  Even my Turkish husband thought it wasn't bad.  I did however need to add some water to smooth the puree out.  This would be best using fresh chickpeas soaked overnight in salty water and boiled in the pressure cooker.

Outstanding. I feel like a real chef. Never did I think I could whip up a batch of hummus. I did take the suggestions of some of the reviewers and added cumin.  I also added some cayenne pepper and extra garlic.  YUMMY!
Also be sure to take the advice of the others and reserve the bean juice.  You will need it.

I added some cumin, more paprika, roasted red peppers, a splash of cold water and held the tahini. Excellent hummus! I also added a dash of Cavender's Seasoning blend and a bit more lemon juice. Great stuff!!!

Love this hummus!!  I didn't add a teaspoon of salt just to taste and I added cilantro since that what I had.  I put it in my serious blender and it still took a while to blend it up, I had to add some water.  Yummy, yummy and lots of fiber :)

This was ok.  I thought it was much too thick so I just kept adding things until I liked the taste & consistency better.  I ended up adding sweet roasted red peppers, quite a bit of cayenne pepper and some fat free sour cream to thin it out a little.

great simple recipe! but FYI the hummus will taste a little bland the day of.  If you let it sit overnight the paprika and garlic flavors will come out better the next day.  Also I added a little roasted paprika, and lots of garlic (i loveeee garlic), chili powder, and a little of italian seasoning.  Everyone loved it!

I love hummus and this is a good recipe. I read some earlier reviews and I also used some of the garbanzo bean juice and added some red peppers and chili oil and it tasted great. Oh and only about a 1/4 of tahini. Otherwise a delicious recipe!

We eat so much hummus, I decided to go ahead and try making it myself.  This is truly a great recipe.  The taste is spot on with what we are familiar with.  My husband actually said he liked it more than what we typically buy.  I made this in a blender and it was way too thick to mix.  I wish I'd have read other reviews before attempting this and I'd have added some of the liquid from the can.  I finally used water and that was fine though.  I'm sure armed with this knowledge, I'll whip this up super fast next time.

I loved this Humus, albeit I didn't follow the recipe.  I completely left out the paprika and parsley, and when mixing in the blender I streamed in enough olive oil to get it to the consistancy I wanted (probably about 1/4 cup or so?).  Additionally, I minced up some pickled jalapeno, carrot, onion out of a jar and used it as a relish on top which was similar to something I've had from Central Market before.  It was really great and now we make this all the time for a healthy snack around the house.

This is an easy and really delicious  receipe.  I believe next time I will cut back on the amount of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of salt may be a bit much.  I am going to try rinsing the beans and use 1/2 teaspoon salt.  My husband did not like the strong "lemony" taste.  It is a tad on the thick side however I really like that as it clings to what you are dipping into it.  This one is a definite keeper.

this recipe is a great starter recipe for anyone to try hummus and customize.  i usually add more garlic (about 2-3 cloves per can of beans i use) and have changed it up by using different beans - black beans (my favorite so far!), kidney beans (nice shade of pink when blended!) - and by adding other ingredients.   i've tried adding one chipotle to the mix sometimes, or using sun dried tomatoes another time.  Whatever you want, you can do with this base recipe.  It's awesome! thanks for the recipe!

I’ve re-read the recipe and still can’t understand what went wrong.  I love hummus but this just didn’t work, it turned out like wet sand.  I was very disappointed because I thought I had done something wrong.  I’m thinking it must have been the addition of the tahini which I’ve never used in my hummus before.  None of my guests like it either.

Love it. I use two cans of beans instead of two cups, add a little extra lemon, eyeball the paprika and add cumin. Also freeze it in muffin cups which is genious so thanks who ever I copied that from.

I thought it was a pretty good recipe, I made a few changes, though. 1st I reduced the amount of tahini by 1/2. 2nd I added a touch of homemade hot sauce and a 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Lastly I added a bit of greek yogurt and olive oil for smoother consistency. Yum :)

Played with the amount of tahini (less) & olive oil (more) to get the consistency & flavor I like.  Great base recipe & easy to make.  I thinned it out with water & added lots more spices (cumin, more paprika, touch of chili powder).  Husband thought it tasted like store-bought hummus!

Awesome and so easy, made it according to the recipe, used fresh lemon juice.  Adding a few slices roasted red pepper to the food processor really brings in some more flavour.

Fresher than store bought yet so easy to make! I like a little more garlic so I used 2 cloves of garlic instead with a dash of cumin recommended by another reviewer. Saving the garbanzo beans' canned juice was needed to smooth it in the processor. Thank you so much.

Pretty good base recipe....easy to add or subtract ingredients to get exactly what you want.  Like others, mine was way too thick.  I cooked the garbanzo beans myself and had thrown away the "stock" so I added water to thin it down.  I also found the first batch way too lemony and too tahini, so I cut both of those back to 1/8 c lemon juice (fresh squeezed) and 2 tbsp tahini.  Also added cumin as others suggested.  I also added way more garlic but that is personal preference.  Next time I will roast my garlic first and add smoked red peppers.  I found my tahini at kroger in 2 places - the healthy/organic section and with the kosher items.

I eat a lot of store-bought hummus so I was thrilled at finding this recipe and the ease of making it! I did add extra garlic and cut the Tahini down to 3Tbl. Drizzled a little olive oil on top and I enjoyed this very much! I'm going to play around with this recipe a little more, perhaps add a little more lemon juice; I added a little over an ounce, but overall this was fabulous and I won't be buying hummus ever again!!! Thanks for sharing!

I agree that this is really good but too thick.  Next time (which will be very soon) I will reserve the liquid from the beans and cut back slightly on the tahini.  I actually thought the lemon and garlic amounts were perfect.  I left out the parsley because I didn't have any and will probably keep it out.  Very, very good.

Yum!  I used less tahini since I had never used it before.  It was great!  Once it was all mixed up in the blender, I took half out and set aside.  To the remaining hummus in the blender, I added about 10 pimento stuffed olives and give it a few pulses.  Put both in different containers and put it the fridge overnight.  They were both delicious....my daughter perfered the olive hummus, while I really liked the plain.

Delicious! I used 2 cans of beans, and reserved the bean liquid to thin out the hummus. It worked great! I used about 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp or so of tahini (the jar I had was super thick and strong) and 1-2 tbsp more lemon juice than called for. I also added approximately 1/2 tsp of cumin, and 1/8 tsp of cayenne. So good, I even converted my husband who swore he didn't like hummus. Oh yeah, I added several shakes of paprika while blending instead of sprinkling on top and forgot the parsley. I can't wait to make this again!

Amazing!  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and started low with the tahini (started w/3 TBS) and lemon juice (started w/1oz) and added to taste.  I also followed the suggestions of adding some cumin, red pepper flakes and a couple of roasted red peppers that I had on hand.  I reserved the juice from the beans and used about 1/4 of a cup to smooth it out.  I am NEVER buying pre-made hummus again.  Dude-party in my mouth!!!

Definitely better than store-bought hummus.  But, needs more oil & lemon juice, it is too thick if you stick to the recipe amounts.  Also, added a little more garlic to one batch, but it turned out to be too much, so the 2 garlic cloves is perfect!  Next time, I am going to roast the garlic first.

This was my first time making hummus, and I'm no expert on the subject, but this recipe worked out perfectly!!!  I roasted the garlic and added half a roasted red bell pepper and it was delicious!  The only bad thing -- I have a mini food processor and I knew it would be too small, so I used the blender which was kind of a pain (it worked, just required constantly mashing and mixing with a spatula to get everything down to the blade).  A full-sized food processor would make this recipe a piece of cake to make!

This is a great basic hummus recipe! Of course it has to be adjusted to fit your taste.  I followed others suggestions and decreased tahini because you can always add more if you like and I felt that it was perfect with 2 1/2 Tbsp.  I also added 6 cloves of roasted garlic and roasted red peppers to give it a sweet, smoky flavor.  If you like spicy, add cumin, chili powder, hot sauce, or cayenne!

Most excellent!  I've been wanting to try to make hummus for a long time and finally took the plunge with this recipe.  I added a roasted red pepper, several large cloves of roasted garlic, a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and a bit extra on the paprika, as we like our food on the spicy side.  It is perfect!

Excellent recipe, and the other reviews are all dead on - keep the chick pea juice to lighten the mixture a bit.    Another trick I use is to put 1 or 2 teaspoons of peanut butter in the mixture - this is a personal preference, but give it a try if you want something different!

Very yummy. I could not find the tahini at the grocery store so I did without and it seemed ok. I did peel all the garbanzo beans for a creamier texture and added more lemon and garlic. I added red pepper flakes too. This sat over night and I served the next day and it was spicy!

This is a good basic hummus! I thought it needed a little more salt and garlic though. I made mine in a blender and found that I had to add at least twice as much liquid (lemon juice and water) to get the mixture to actually blend, so keep that in mind! Otherwise, this was delicious!

I used half the amount of tahini and powdered garlic and it turned out well. Definitely be prepared to add some liquid to help the hummus get smooth (I added about 2 tablespoons of water and about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil). Don't forget the parsley! It is supposed to help with the garlic breath that may follow!

To me, this is the PERFECT hummus: garlicky, beanie, and oh so easy!  For the brands of tahini and beans I use, the ratios turn out perfect!    Try smoked paprika for a different, but subtle take on this one.    *I agree with other users that if you are new to, or do not like tahini, try adding just a bit at a time.*

Great recipe!  I followed some of the other suggestions and added cumin and roasted red pepper. I used 3 tbsp Tahini and about 3 tbsp Lemon Juice3 cloves garlic. It definitely needs some of the juice from the can i used about 1/2 cup. to 2 whole cans of beans.  This was a show stopper! i'll be making this from here on out!

This is a nice, simple recipe that comes out pretty yummy.  I had some dried garbanzo beans in the pantry that I've been wanting to use up, so I cooked them until they were very soft (softer than what you generally get in a can).  I had to add some extra garbanzo beans to dilute the mix since 1 tsp salt tasted too salty.  I used 2 tsp minced garlic and the full 1/4 c lemon juice.  I did have to add in a lot of water to the mix in my food processor to make it more like a dip instead of like a paste.  I didn't have any tahini, so I drizzled in some sesame oil instead and it gave the right flavor.  I did also add some of the olive oil into the hummus and will serve some on top with the paprika, too.  I really liked that it came out super smooth.

Very good.  I added half a cup of sundried tomatoes and some of the oil. Also added some crushed red pepper flakes (about a tsp). I'll probably experiment with other ingredients like roasted red peppers or some jalapeno peppers next time.

Amazing hummus! I never understood why people liked hummus before I tried this recipe. I made this version for some friends and now I make it all the time. The flavor is great (perfect amount of tahini) and it's so simple. One thing I changed was that I use some of the bean liquid to thin it out a bit and slightly reduced the lemon juice -personal preference. Other than that, great recipe! Thanks!

This gets a five for passing my Israeli boyfriend's hummus standards. I usually add a little more tahini than directed. Also, instead of the chickpea water, my boyfriend instructed me to use HOT water to aid in blending. Go easy on the lemon juice. And DEFINITELY let it sit overnight as the flavors blend and the consistency thickens. La briut!

This hummus tastes almost identical to the Mediterranian Deli version in my town.  I took some advice from the reviews: I drained the chickpeas (KEEP the water), then put them in a pot of boiling water to soften them for blending.  I used a food processor (I don't know how you could use a blender, unless it's an industrial one!).  I added everything to the processor, adding 1/4 cup of reserved chickpea water after blending because it seemed TOO thick.  I added 1/2tsp salt instead of a full tsp (the water has salt already, and I didnt want it too salty - I would have added the remaining 1/2tsp afterwards if I thought it needed it) and a few grinds of pepper.I also used two LARGE garlic cloves.  It was a great consistency, nice and thick and creamy.  Awesome.  I highly recommend trying this!

Very good recipe, but I shouldn't have added all the salt in at once because it was way too salty! Next time, I will add a little at a time, and I did not add the whole amount of garlic (that would've been too much for my family). At a lebanese restaurant that I go to, they drizzle EVOO with red pepper flakes and slices of fresh parmesan cheese on top of the hummus and that is how I always serve it. Really delicious!

My husband loves this hummus. I've made it a few times for him and he usually eats it in one to two sittings. I use a little less then 1/4 cup tahini, about 3 cloves garlic and the "juice" from the garbanzo beans to loosen it up a bit. I want to try it with some roasted red pepper next time.

YUM! After reading other reviews, I erred on the side of caution with some of the ingredients for the first time making it. So good and so easy. I'll never buy hummus again! Such a great base recipe to play with flavours!

Loved it. Great basic hummus recipe. I did mistakenly use 2 cans of chick peas but added some reserve water and it was fine. I'm going to experiment and make it with Chipotles and another with Kalamata olives.

I have been unable to convince 2 out of my 3 children to try hummus. After making this recipe and tasting it myself, I knew they would love it. I was right! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Next time I will double it since it went so fast.

I just made this and I am very pleased. This is THE traditional hummus and I thought the amounts of everything were perfect. It should be noted though, that chickpea brands vary considerably in softness, tangy-ness, saltiness, and maybe other features, so experiment with several brands to find the one you prefer. This is also great with other add-ins, red pepper or chipotle being my favorites. Also, the dry red pepper used by our Arabic friends is available at Middle-Eastern stores.

With a few modifications, this recipe is perfect! I use one can of garbanzo beans, and reserve the liquid. As one of the "most helpful" raters suggested, I shell all of the peas before blending -- this seems to make a HUGE difference in consistency. I can't NOT shell them now that I've tried it this way. I use 2 tablespoons of key lime juice, about 2 teaspoons of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of tahini, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and then blend until smooth (adding reserved bean liquid as needed). This version is a kid- and picky husband-pleaser. I make at least one batch a week to go with veggies, chips, crackers, etc. It gets better with time, too. It's almost imperative that you leave it in the fridge overnight before eating it to let the flavors meld. Mmm!

I have tried tons of different hummus recipes and this one is by far the best. Simple can certainly be better. I find that using organic chick peas works well. They tend to be softer and smaller and blend nicely. You can vary the consistency by saving a bit of the drained liquid and adding it as needed.

I love Hummus, and this one is great.  Reserve the liquid from the garbonzo beans to use to get the Hummus to the desired consistancy.  Taste to make sure it is salty enough.
Don't skimp on the cayenne.

Wow!  Once I found tahini, this was easy and just as good or better than what I've bought at grocery stores or restaurants.  Just be sure to keep in food processor long enough to be really smooth. I'll probably never buy hummus again!

Just a warning.. roasted garlic does give a sweet taste so it is not ideal for hummus as you'll be using loads of salt to compensate. Just use plane garlic  or 2 tbsps of crushed garlic

Excellent recipe--when I lived in Toledo, Ohio hummus was fresh and plentiful at every store.  Now that I'm in Minnesota, not so much.  This recipe is fantastic.  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions--added red pepper, cut back on tahini a bit, used fresh lemon juice, and pressure cooked dry chickpeas.  It is absolutely wonderful.

OMG! This was so much better than the expensive hummus I have bought at the grocery store. It's so cheap to make. Definetly worth the little effort to make this stuff yourself. The grocery store stuff is no comparison.

Delicious!  I use a lot of the juice from the garbanzo beans and I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin.  I make this recipe a lot and everyone loves it.

This tasted a bit bland per the instructions so I added some cumin, olive oil and cayenne pepper as to what other reviewers had posted.  Stick with one garlic at first and add more as desired.  I added four medium sized ones all at once hoping for the best and it was way too garlic-y. All in all though the end product tasted like the ones you eat at the restaurants.

I prefer the soft leaves of Italian parsley when making this spread.  As leftovers if you don't like eating food cold out of the fridge, try warming it in the microwave.  I think it tastes much better that way.

Oh this was delicious!  I don't like the brand that has been selling in the store and decided to try to make some myself.  I had read the reviews and found Head's to be really helpful and glad that I made with most of the changes that were noted.  I used a bit more garlic than mentioned (4 cloves and some minced from the jar) since I was trying to make it like the garlic hummus I used to eat, and I think that it may taste a litle better if the garlic were roasted first.  I'll try that next time.  But this reminds me of the stuff I used to love and not what I have to buy at the store.  Thanks for the recipe!

What I loved about this recipe is it's a great starting off point and you can tweak it to your liking.  I added extra garlic and lemon. We never need to buy the expensive pre-made humus from the store again!

I'm giving 4 stars because I made a few alterations. I added way more garlic, not sure how much because mine is minced in a jar, 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper, and slightly less tahini. Overall the dip was great. I'm new to eating as well as making humus so I think this was a great start. Thanks for the recipe

In order to get the smoothest creamiest Hummus - you have to PEAL your chick peas/garbonzo beans - this means putting them in a bowl and removing the outer skin from each one - if you put the pea between your thumb and pointer finger and squeez a little the shell will pop right off - disguard shell. This is a cumbersome process but makes a huge difference in the creaminess of your hummus.  Also like others stated save some of the juice from the can to add to the mixture to get the consistency you like.

It was great.  I did as one reviewer suggested and actually peeled all the garbanzo beans,  I also let it sit in the fridge for about 8 hours so that the flavors would meld.  I used fresh ingredients except for the canned garbanzo beans.  I will make this again, most probably with in the week :)

I just love this, it's a staple in my fridge. Perfect balance of peas, tahini, lemon. To combat too-thick texture, blend the oil right into it, plus some reserved chickpea liquid.
 
A great variation:  start processor running empty, add 1 garlic clove and 3-4 oil-packed sundried tomatoes and blend to rough paste. Then add all the ingredients of Hummus III recipe, plus 1 tsp. ground cumin.

I took the advice to add some cumin and red pepper flakes to this and it's wonderful!!  I used crushed garlic from a jar (1 tsp = 2 cloves) and ground sea salt.  I could literally eat it with a spoon.  Absolutely a keeper!

Good "base" recipe...  I found that instead of adding raw garlic it taste much better if you add about 4-5 cloves of roasted garlic... Another thing that is wonderful when added is a whole fried onion (medium size one) and hot sauce (to taste). If you use pita bread, brush with some oil or butter then sprinkle with some of your favorite seasoning (I do onion powder) and toast in the oven for a bit (becareful they burn fast if you're not paying attention!!)

Difficult as it was to find the tahini, it totally makes the dish. This was great for one, or for a crowd!! Although, it could have done without the parsley garnish...I'll omit that next time. Also upped the amount of chick peas (garbanzos) to make even more, and served with crudites and pita bread. I will definitely be making this again.

I thought it was too thick/dry...I added too much garlic (I always increase garlic in most recipes b/c I like it so much...but not a good idea this time).  No one ate much of this at my dinner party.

Taste was good, but the texture was way too thick and dry. I think some other reviewers also had this problem, and it was probably because of the type of tahini used. My friend and I made this together, and I bought tahini sauce while she bought tahini paste -- two very very different ingredients. We used the paste because we thought the recipe called for sesame seed paste, but I think if we had used the sauce, the hummus would have had a better consistency.

Fabulous.  A great mix as-is and the first hummus recipe I haven't needed to alter upon blending.  Seems like a great base as well.  I will try to flavor it for my next batch.

I get rave reviews each time I make this recipe.  I've made this using both a blender and a food processer.  Each works just as well but with a blender, add some liquid from canned beans so the blender will "go".  Even with the food processer, the recipe is a little thick.  I added a little olive oil before blendiing and it worked perfectly.

This hummus turned out OK. It was way too salty for my taste but the consistency and texture was perfect. Next time, I won't add so much salt and it should turn out more to my taste, I think.

This is areally great recipe.  It's easy and it's small enough that it can all fit into my rather tiny food processer. Both times I added things for different flavors, but it is excellent as a base and I am sure it would be great plain too.  The first time I roasted and peeled 1 red bell pepper and added 1 cerrano pepper chopped up and a teaspoon of cumin  powder.  The second time I made it I added half a cucumber and about 3 tsp of dried dill.  Both were very good.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very Good Hummus!!!! I took the advice of other reviewers and used only half the amount of tahini, added cumin, 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 the liquid in the chick peas. You won't be disappointed. Try this recipe. I served it with Pita Chips from this site. YUM!

Tres magnifique! Super easy - took about 5 minutes to prepare. Didn't change anything except doubled the garlic once which ended up being way too much, yet 2 wasn't enough. Next time I'll use 3 cloves! This came really close to the hummus served at our favorite little Greek place - except we like this recipe better! I make this about twice a month - keeps for about a week and a half in the 'fridge.

I loved this recipe!  Being a vegetarian, I have grown to love hummus, and I always look forward to having it when I go to a Middle-Eastern or Mediterranean restaurant, but now I can make it at home!  I thought this was the best hummus I have ever tasted!  The only thing I did differntly to this recipes was I added a little cayenne pepper, cumin, and 2 more cloves of garlic and decreased the amount of tahini.  I will no longer buy hummus at the store, this recipe is a hundred times better!

I'm changing my review of this. I've finally learned the trick that makes this work. Add a little of the bean liquid. It helps with the consistancy and it's awesome. Add other ingrediants to suit your taste! Put it on a pita with cucumber, sprouts, and chicken. I have this for lunch almost everyday:^) Thanks!

Delicious! Makes a nice, thick, spreadable hummus that is so so good.  Love to serve it as a spread on sandwiches.  Used less tahini and added some of the juice from the can of chickpeas to thin it out.

Absolutely delicious, this is much better than store bought hummus.  I use it as a dip, as well as a spread on toast or pitas.

I have never had hummus before, so I have no idea how this compares to what I would find in a store. I really liked it. I made 1/2 the recipe, in case I didn't like it. I will go ahead and make the full recipe next time.
I wasn't even too sure what to do with it once I made it, so I just put some inside a pita. Yummy. 
I did have to add a bit of water while processing because it was too thick to mix well.

Mostly very easy to make.  The most tedious part was taking the husks off the beans (as suggested in here).  They are not hard to take off but there are so may beans.  I took it too a party and every body was loving it.  I even had to give the recipe out.  Next time I will try adding more flavors to it. I did add cumin to taste as previously suggested and extra garlic.

This is excellent!  I cannot stomach the store bought hummus anymore after this recipe!  So simple but it pays to make it ahead at least a day, mabye two.  The flavors meld and you  can add whatever you want to this!

Very good! I add extra garlic and chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Always brings compliments. Much better than store bought humuus with preservatives.

Beyond delicious! I thought I needed to make a double batch....but it is so yummy and filling that you don't need to eat as much as you thought! Especially delicious with orange and red bellpepper slices...whole wheat pita...and I stored the rest in the refrigerator. When I wanted to eat some more i just added more EVOO and paprika!!!

This is an awsome hummus, very easy.  I used just one can of beans, which was about 1 3/4 cups, I just used a slight bit less of everything else.  This is even a bit better than the lebenese deli that I usually get hummus from, and costs about 75% less.  friends that I served it too who frequent middle eastern restaraunts, were amazed that I made this, and it was better than they were used to.  This is a winner, I think a good powerful food processor, is a must, to get a great texture.

I will never buy hummus from the grocery store again!  I made this for dinner guests as an appetizer (served with pita triangles, blue chips, and cucumber).  Everyone loved it, including my mother in law, who is famous for saying, "What IS this?"  Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

Definitely great, with a couple changes.  I doubled the garlic, used only 1/4 tsp of salt and will use only 1/4 cup of tahini next time, plus I used a full can (540ml) of chick peas with a bit of liquid reserved.  Mmmm, very very yummy.

This is a truly great hummus!  I'm a picky hummus eater, and this is a great recipe.  It's almost perfect.  My only complaint is that it's a tad salty -- so reduce the salt and you have a perfect hummus!

This is based suggestions other people left.  

put garbanzo beans and let sit in very hot water for a little while.  Makes it easy to blend in a blender and comes out warm, yum!
cut and add olives
Add 1/4 to 1/2 C roasted red peppers
I addin around 2 teaspoons of cumin for extra flavor.
reserve the liquid drained from the garbanzo beans
less salt
add red peppers (spicy) and sometimes one or two tablespoons of white truffle oil.
less lemon
added a little cumin and ceyanne pepper 
LOTS more garlic

This Hummus is very very good.  I had tried on a few other occasions to make hummus and it never turned out right.  I used the suggestion to reserve some of the liquid from the beans to get it to the right(or my preferred) consistancy.  I added the oil and spices right into the mix.  I will definately make again and it seems I've found a new use for the ten cans of chick peas in my pantry.

This is great hummus, better than another recipe I tried once. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think it needed extra liquid. I washed the garbanzo beans and drained them but didn't dry them. I added a bit of olive oil to the mix, but not much. I made the recipe as written, but it seemed way too lemony, so I added another can of beans and another 1/3 cup tahini. It turned out great. Perhaps, as another reviewer mentioned, the lemon flavor will diminish after today. Oh, I also added the paprika directly to the mix, as I won't be serving it to look nice and just wanted the flavor. Next time I'm going to try adding cumin. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Four instead of five only because I'm not sure about the lemon situation.

Thank-you Rhoda for making my first hummus-making experience a no-brainer.  I first tried hummus in university over 10 years ago, and have been thinking of making it ever since.  For all first-timers out there, don't change a thing...EXCEPT, reserve the liquid drained from the garbanzo beans.  A little bit will be needed during processing to make an ultra-smooth result.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing about this recipe.

Took other's suggestions and used two cans of garbanzo beans-- one drained, the other with liquid.  Doubled the garlic only because I think there's no such thing as too much.  Perfect.

We had company a couple nights later and made sandwiches on pita with lettuce, tomato, grilled chicken, sauteed red peppers and this hummus.  Awesome!!

I halved this recipe and substituted peanut butter and some whole roasted sesame seeds for the tahini (cannot find any in my area). I used fresh crushed garlic and left off the parsley as I did not have any. I also mixed the olive oil in. It was great! I had some with my falafel. Thanks Rhoda!

One can of garbanzo beans is just a little shy of 2 cups, so that's all I used.  Following the directions, it was still too thick but I took another reviewers suggestion and added some reserved bean liquid.  This is really excellent, cheap and easy. I will make this OFTEN!

I'm half Syrian and used to my grandmother's and great-aunt's recipe, but I have to admit that this is as authentic as it gets!  I add 2 T of the liquid from the beans before blending.  One other suggestion...let the hummus "mellow" by refrigerating for at least a few hours before serving so that the garlic and lemon won't overpower the other ingredients.  Tastes great as a spread on toasted French/Italian bread slices or with fresh peppers as dippers.

Was a lil thick and overpowering taste of tahini and lemon juice, i will add some syrup from the garbanzo can, lil more olive oil and reduce the tahini and lemon juice next time. But overall a very good recipe !!

Wonderful recipe!  You can also reduce the amount of olive oil and tahini and it will still have a wonderful flavor!

This was awesome.  I took some of the others advice and reserved 3 tablespoon of the chickpea liquid and added it to the mixture while processing it.  I also added the olive oil to the food processor instead of drizzling it on top.  The texture and consistancy were perfect and the taste was fantastic.  Served it with Toasted Pita Chips also on this site. Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend liked this, but I thought the tahini flavor was too much.  Next time I'll reduce it to 2 tablespoons and perhaps add a bit more lemon juice.  The consistency was a bit too thick as well.  I would use some reserved bean liquid to make it creamier.

I have a friend who craves hummus.  Last time, I made the black bean hummus dip from this site, and she loved it.  I thought I would make 'original' hummus for her, but she said that she now prefers the black bean version.  It wasn't that this was bad; she just now has a new favorite.  This is simple and has a good 'earthy' flavor.

This was an OK dip but it had way too much tahini in it for my/my guests' taste.  I think that had we cut it back to just 1-2 tbsp, it would probably have been great.

Fantastic!  Very simple to make, with excellent results.  I blended the olive oil and paprika into the hummus, and added a small amount of roasted red peppers for color and taste.  A+!

I made this for a party I recently hosted, and everyone loved it! I added 3 extra cloves of garlic to spice it up a bit. I also doubled the recipe which made the blending a little hard, but overall it was great. It freezes well, so I have some stored in my freezer. The hardest part was finding the tahini at the grocery store!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I found the tahini in my grocery store (large national chain).  The flavors are really wonderful and this really does taste so much better than store bought hummus.  Serve with blue corn chips and veggies for dipping. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I just received my copy of the AllRecipes Cookbook and saw this recipe - perfect timing!  I had been wanting to make my own hummus, so I figured if it was in the "all-star cookbook," it had to be good, and boy, is it ever!  I will never buy store-bought hummus again.

I came here first to read the reviews and made a few adjustments prior to making the hummus...I cut back (by 1 Tbsp.) on the lemon juice, added a 1/4 cup of olive oil to get the right consistency, and also crushed the garlic cloves with a garlic press.

If you love hummus and garlic, you'll love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Rhoda!  Now which is the Boston restaurant?  Would love to visit it in person!  :-)

By far the best receipe for hummus I have ever tried.  It needed a little bit of water added for the right texture, but it was delicious!!  Very much comparable or better than authentic Middle Eastern restaurant's hummus.  The trick is the smoothness, I used a food processer type machine called the Vita Mix it worked wonderfully.

I really enjoyed this. As others suggested, I added about a 1/4 cup of olive oil to improve the consistency. Next time, I may cut back on the lemon juice a little bit b/c it was a tiny bit too "lemony" for my taste. Definitely a keeper though.

If you like hummus, then you'll like this recipe!!!  I made this recipe twice.  The second time I added less salt and it was much better.  I also  added a little water to bring it to a good consistency.

I made it as written, and added 2 extra cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 2 tsp plain yogurt to make it creamier and substituted the parsley with cilantro. (we like spicy!) It was delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is always my GO-TO recipe for hummus. I love reading all the reviews. To me , you either love hummus or you don't. Hummus is very forgiving and flexible. I like to spice it up with extra garlic (double or triple the recommendation). Tahineh can be tricky and can go rancid if not properly stored and used. Some people also forget to mix it VERY well before using. If you have thick paste at the bottom keep stirring. I also fold in the tahineh at the end and give it as few spins in the food processor as possible. I heard it can cause mixture to "glutenize" if blended too long.

When we made this, my wife added a Jamaican touch by adding one large, ripe avocado, 1 cup of black beans, 6 drops of scotch bonnet sauce, 1/4 teaspoon curry powder. 2 tablespoons of coconut paste and some chopped red and yellow peppers. Puree the whole lot in food processor, place in food storage container and store in the fridge overnight to let everything blend together. Serve as usual. Hope you enjoy.

Surprised that more people haven't found the tahini overpowering. I prefer a mild hummus with a silky texture. Following the recipe as written resulted in a hummus that was dominated by the woody flavor and texture of sesame.

I cut the lemon juice in half and roasted my own sesame seeds instead of tahini.  It got rave reviews.  This is a great basic recipe .

This is a good go-to basic hummus. Basic as in there's lots of room to add other flavours as some of the other reviewers suggest (cayenne, olive, etc.). I doubled the garlic but roasted not raw.

This is the most amazing Hummus recipe I have ever made!! I think I'm in love with hummus because of this. I added only 1/4 tsp of salt instead of 1tsp because iI thought it was too salty but it's up to you!

Half all of the ingredients  with the exception of the garbanzo beans and tahini.   Make it as directed and then add ingredients  to taste.   Hints: Helps if you make your tahini fresh, use smoked paprika, use fresh garlic, add cumin to taste,  when using liquid from canned garbanzo  beans, add the salt last, the liquid is salted.

First time making hummus came out awesome! Gave some to neighbors, they loved it. One little thing to consider. End product was just a tiny bit too salty for my taste. May have been the salt(s) added to the canned progresso brand chickpeas. ** update, -25% salt, came out even better! **

This was so yummy! It was a little too thick for my taste at first, but just added water to the preferred consistency. Something seemed off with the taste at first, but then I realized it was missing cumin. Once I added that, the flavor was out of this world! I like how you can taste the lemon here. In most store bought brands, I can't taste it, and I want to be able to! I love lemon! Anyway, this is an awesome customizable recipe. I eat mine with carrot slices and sugar snap peas??

Excellent recipe! As per the other reviews I added water to thin out and added  only about  4 tbs of tahine because I didn't want it to be so heavy, I assume tahine must have a lot of calories. Also I put some ground cummin and pimenton, and 1 tbs of EVOO. Awesome results!

This was a very easy recipe & rather then use the garbanzo bean juice, I increased the olive oil to 1/4 cup & mixed everything first then turned on the food processor & slowly poured in the olive oil to allow it to mix in.  Perfect consistency & I added a little smoked paprika to the top.  Tasted great on both pita chips and jicama!

Wonderful recipe Everyone will change it a bit and  this recipe is actually foolproof.  HOWEVER if you rub the peas between your palms or in a towel, the outer skin will shed easily which gives you a much, much smoother finish. It's a time management thing, way worth it if you are willing.

This the best hummus ever!  Did not want to bother measuring the garbanzos thus wasting a partial can, so just used 2 cans.  We love garlic, so that was doubled.  Thinned to desired consistency by adding some water or bean juice.  Fabulous and nutritious too.  Better hummus than any store bought or restaurant I've tried.

This is my go-to recipe for hummus! Tho I usually add more garlic, more lemon and include the cumin and red pepper.  But many people don't realize that tahini is just toasted sesame seeds blended with olive oil and super easy to make yourself!  I get my sesame seeds in the bulk food section really cheap, and make the tahini myself.  Admittedly, I can be a lazy cook, so most the time I just toast my sesame seeds and throw them in the hummus as is and grind it up all together.  If you want to take the time, you can roast the sesame seeds then grind them up with a little olive oil using a mortar and pestle or your blender and then add it to your hummus.  Also, the more you toast your sesame seeds, the more bitter they become.  So I only lightly toast them.  And then I like to make what we call a Nagel Bagel!  Toast a bagel, swipe a good amount of hummus on it, and top it off with slices of tomato, cucumber, and onion!  My oh my, am I in seventh heaven with one of these!!!

Everyone loved this at my daughter's birthday party. Should have made a double batch!  I followed the directions precisely EXCEPT I just used two cans of chickpeas and reserved the liquid to add some back in as it blended in my vitamix. Used about half of one of the cans of liquid - the new can of tahini was s little runnier than usual. Next time I may throw in an extra garlic clove depending on how big the cloves are. Really really good!

This is awesome recipe. When I don't have tahini, I use peanut butter, and it works too. It becomes a bit of peanut butter flavor, but that doesn't mean less delicious.

Omg, why on earth didn't I make my own hummus sooner! This is healthier with more fiber and protein than store bought and I can tweak it. Cut the lemon down to an 1/8 cup, skip the paprika, cut the tahini to 1/4 cup and add a teaspoon of turmeric, 2 teaspoons of red pepper and triple the garlic (if you like garlic).

It's easier and cheaper to make your own tahini. Just buy sesame seeds and bake them for 10 min at 350 degrees, then blend them with olive oil (enough to moisten the seeds and make them into a paste).

I modified this slightly but loved it. I used 2 cans of garbanzos and 2TB of tahini and everything else was about the same. I used a little more lemon juice and some of the reserved bean water to thin the hummus out. The longer it rests, the better it tasted. By the 3rd day it was amazing. I put everything in my Vitamix which is a must have for something like this. Thanks.

I found this so easy. I used less tahini and liquid from the chick peas.

This is delicious! I added more cloves of garlic, onion powder, red pepper flakes, olive oil and a few tbsp of water and it was perfect!! This is now a staple in our house!

This is a very good recipe for hummus.  But I need suggestions with the texture. It came out somewhat grainy and I like it best smooth. I peeled each bean and heated the beans before doing the purée. The taste was great but I want to improve the texture.

Delicious! I followed the recommendations to reduce the tahini to 2 tbsp, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I will most definitely be making this again!

Disaster…I followed the recipe to a "T" but it was so thick the blender couldn't handle it so I ended up adding more lemon juice, water in an effort to make it lighter.

WOW! It looks so yummy! I will definitely try this one for thanksgiving! BTW - I found a great vegan wine at Whole Foods Market, it is called "Deccolio Prosecco" and it will be great aperitif to the holiday dinner.

My picky eater loves it! I made it exactly as stated except I did add 1 more lemon( I love sour) then added a little more water until my blender could handle pureeing it! My blender is old and cheap. Both my kiddos and I enjoyed dipping cucumber slices and home made pita chips in it. Thanks for a great basics Hummus! I will play with it eventually. But it is a keeper for my picky one for sure!

This recipe is simple and the best! I added extra garlic, because I am a garlic lover, and topped it with smoked paprika cause that's what I had on hand. The last little addition was a dash of cumin. Wow, packed with flavor!

Wow, this is a keeper! I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 3 tblps of tahini and it was great! I didn't need more than that really. I also used two large cloves of garlic and added half teaspoon cumin. It was delicious! I realized that good olive oil makes this dish as well, so that's important to keep in mind! Thanks for the recipe!!

So rich and creamy! As others said, the Garbanzo juice is essential in smoothing out (or water). Far better and cheaper than buying pre-made/restaurant versions.

We love this! I only drain 1/2 the water off the garbanzos, and only use about 1 Tbs. lemon juice. Wiz in my NutriBullet till smooth. Easy and perfect for our tastes!

Very easy basic recipe for hummus. Great for adapting to your own tastes. Tried halving the tahini at first, but then I found that it was too lemony, and the tahini cuts that perfectly. Still, used 3/4 of recommended amount. Added red bell pepper (1/2 a pepper minced) and tripled the garlic to get it where I wanted it. Will definitely do again.

This is my first shot at making hummus. I've never really liked hummus because my mom used to buy the premade stuff in a plastic container and it never tasted very good. Then the other day I went to an Iranian restaurant with a friend and she wanted hummus so we ordered it. It was delicious and I couldn't get enough of it, so I decided to try and make my own. 

This was pretty good, but very dry. I ended up adding a lot of water (a full cup and a half) to get it to the consistency I liked, and it tasted a bit too lemony, but I just need to fine-tune it. All in all this is fantastic. Even my husband and kids liked it, so it's a winner.

The taste is good.  Next time I would not add as much salt as is called for.  I don't use a lot of salt typically and the quantity specified in the recipe is a bit much for me.  I think I'l also add either more tahini or more lemon juice to make the consistency a bit smoother and not quite as thick.

Delicious. We used dry peas that we had soaked/boiled. They were dry even after preparing them so we had to add a bit of water since it was much too dry (canned chickpeas would have a much higher water content than our reconstituted dried had).

Tried this recipe based on the reviews and agree with most, excellent as written and a great base to change it up according to your tastes. I added a bit more garlic and more lemon juice. The flavors were intense at first but after letting it sit in the fridge overnight, the next day the flavors had mellowed out and were outstanding!

I loved this recipe. I think it's a great starter for any hummus (roasted garlic, artichoke, etc.) It looks like I followed suit with many others, in that I cut back on the tahini.

I didn't have lemons so I used limes and I didn't use the olive oil, but only because I thought the recipe was perfect without it.  Great flavor, texture, and just the right balance of garlicky pungency to savory, mild garbanzo/chickpea creaminess.

I personally love hummus. My hubby had thought hummus was just okay... UNTIL I made THIS RECIPE! The entire batch I made was consumed within 24 hours (mostly by him!)! I believe that says a lot. I doubled the garlic, added a bit of water (I found recipe to be too thick). Drizzling olive oil, parsley, and paprika on top? Well, that just makes for the perfect touch at serving. Thanks for sharing the recipe! Off I go to make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe. Like many other reviewers, I adjusted it to suit my taste. For me that meant less tahini, less lemon juice, less salt, more chickpea juice, and a (small) roasted red chili. The result was nice. I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and freeze most of it in single-serving packets.

Perfection!  I absolutely love the flavor of this simple hummus!  The only thing I changed was adding a bit of water so my older blender could manage everything.

This was very good. I made half using half the ingredients with the exception of garlic I stuck with 2 cloves of garlic. The family loved it. We had no left overs.

This is the perfect hummus recipe! Ensure to chill the hummus for a bit before serving. And if you have a food processor - it turns out way better than using your blender. :-)

I did follow the advice / reviews of others and used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and red pepper. Then I also added a 12 oz jar of roasted peppers. ( drained) I now have the best spicy roasted red pepper hummus !! With adding the roasted peppers I did not have to add any extra fluid. Definite keeper!!

Are you wondering why your hummus tasted sour? Why it doesn't taste like the dreamy smooth creamy deliciousness you had in Jerusalem? Yes, it has the tangy sourness of the store-bought stuff, but that's not what we're aiming at here. We are looking for the real deal. And this tastes different because you need to put in A LOT more tahina and olive oil. And, p.s. a little trick for fluffy creamy hummus is a bit of seltzer.

Great basic recipe. I encourage everyone to be creative and experiment with this one.  I used 1 cup of dried garbanzo beans, which I soaked and cooked till tender (you can easily Google to find directions of how to do this). I would much rather do this than used canned beans - the cans contain BPA.  I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I added 1 tsp of dried to the mix.  I did add some cumin - maybe a 1/2 - 1 tsp or so, and a good size hunk of roasted red pepper or 1 fresh red bell pepper, cored and cut into chunks.  I increased the garlic as well - about 2 to 6 cloves can be used depending on your taste. I also added a dash or two of smoked paprika to the mix. I used the juice of two lemons rather than the 1/4 cup called for in the recipe. Delicious and very satisfying.

First time making hummus. I did find the original recipe a bit bland but I like spicier foods. I added 4 crushed garlic cloves, 1 tbs red pepper flakes, 1 tbs olive oil, 1 C juice from drained garbanzo bean cans, used two of these, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tbs lemon juice, and 1 tsp ground cumin, and 3 tbs tahini paste. I love it. I think it will be better blending overnight, if there is any left that is.

Has too much lemon juice for my tastes, but the final product, after tweaking, is really very good. The secret to the texture is to process for several minutes in a food processor.

I doubled the recipe, added one extra clove of garlic and some garlic salt and natures seasoning and it is hands down the best hummus I've ever had. Use fresh squeezed lemons and it really improves the flavor in all things! Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

I never liked hummus, but I'd figure I'd try it because homemade food always tastes better.  I've made it several times now.  I've found that I like it better warm and with Stacy's Pita Chips.  I used only 2 Tbsp tahini and added an extra clove of garlic.  I also tried adding a little finely chopped red pepper and that was good too.

This is a decent recipe, but it came out a bit dry. I would added a bit of water while blending, and it still didn't help so much. Next time, I'll try with more lemon.

Just a beautiful recipe.  You can spice it up however you like.  I don't add any extra olive oil, just to cute down on fat.  But I can't stop eating it!  If you can find a good deal on Tahini (I ordered it from Amazon, much cheaper than the grocery store), than it is SO much cheaper than buying it, and much taster.  I am thrilled to have found an easy & delicious hummus recipe.

You definetly need a food processor for this recipe.  I added more garlic.  I will make again and experiment with roasted red peppers, jalepenos, etc.  Good starter recipe.

Instead of getting store-bought tahini, I toast 1 cup of sesame seeds in a dry frypan until they get a golden color (4-6 minutes), then add to a food processor with 1/3 cup olive oil and blend until smooth.  I then add all the other ingredients to process and for a little extra zing I pulse in 1/3 cup roasted red peppers at the end.  My recipe may not be culturally correct but it sure does taste good!

I've got the hummus!  I would recommend not going all in with everything.  Try less of the tahini and lemon to start.  For us, we used 2 CANS of garbonzos, and the 1/3c tahini and 1/4 lemon worked just fine.  Went with 4 large garlic cloves though.  Keep the garbanzo juice, and add a little at a time until smooth.  Add in about 1 tablespoon olive oil while mixing along with a good pinch of cayenne for spice.  To me, hummus needs roasted red pepper.  I threw in one nice sized piece from the jar, and it gave it the flavor it needed and a nice color.  The Texan in me craves hot, so I top with chopped jalapeno when serving.  YUM! EDIT TO ADD: Look for packaged, uncooked Chapati bread.  It takes about a minute to cook, and gives you fresh cooked flatbread to eat with this wonderful dish.

Wow! I've never made hummus before & found this recipe, thought I'd give it a try, and am glad I did. Used fresh lemon, fresh parsley, about 6-7 garlic cloves (inside ones so they are much smaller than outside of the head cloves), I don't know how much VOO, and garbanzo bean juice. I first went with the written recipe. It was too thick for my liking. So I started adding the garbanzo bean juice but then I lost flavor. So I added some cumin (a teaspoon to start), kosher salt, and cracked pepper. Still too thick but the taste was right on. So, I just keep adding the bean juice, cumin, salt, & pepper until I got it to almost the consistency I wanted. To get it to the super smooth consistency, I added more VOO. I used to go to this restaurant that made a fantastic hummus and this is right there. Sooo good. This recipe will get you on the path and it's up to you how you want it to taste. Everyone likes their hummus differently (that's why there are so many store flavors) but homemade is always the BEST!

Prepared as written, better than a different submission of baba ghanoush recipe I tried from all recipes but still too much tahini per recipe specs. I recommend cutting tahnini in half.

I used this recipe with a few modifications: I use roasted garlic instead of raw garlic (and about 5-10 cloves, as it's not as strongly flavored), and I also blend in roasted red peppers. Delicious and will always impress your guests.

Sorry but I did not like this at all. Too lemony and too much tahini.

This hummus turned out great!  I reduced the tahini to 1/4 cup and also roasted both a red bell  pepper and the garlic cloves in the oven at 450 for 30 minutes, turning once halfway through.  I put the pepper in a plastic ziplock while it cooled and then pulled the outer blackened skin off.   I then put about half the pepper and the garlic into the blender with the other ingredients.  The roasted garlic is much mellower this way than raw and the pepper adds a nice flavor.  I also reserved the liquid from the beans and used that to thin the hummus.

Excellent results for a selective hummus eater! I followed reviews and reduced tahini to 2 Tbsp. Also added tiny bit of cumin. I did peel beans because I had a hand electric beater only, to blend. Result was smooth..

I've made this hummus several times. Like others say, its a good basic recipe, or perfect for kids who might be a bit finicky. I give it 5 stars for being the simplest to make & to tweak.
NOTE: If you can't find tahini, you CAN substitute (yes, you really can) with ground sesame seeds (which you can buy in a jar in the spice  aisle & grind yourself)  & either Orchid or Dynasty Brand Pure Sesame Seed Oil. The seeds are toasted before being pressed so the oil has a deep, rich, almost smoky flavor that makes up for the lack of tahini. I've done this many times; it works great. I also use the bean juice, add extra lemon, 1tsp cumin, 1 tsp SMOKED paprika, & smoked sea salt. LIFE-changing!! You won't be able to stay out of it!

I followed recommendations of others and did less tahini.  I reserved chick pea liquid, which was needed for the right texture.  Instead of just adding olive oil, I warmed it with minced garlic until golden.  In another batch, I kicked up the heat by adding some jarred jalapeño slices to the food processor, plus cayenne, then infused the olive oil with some red Thai chilis.  Both were a big success.  This is a great base recipe to play with other flavors.

As many have said, a good starter recipe.  I used 2 Tbsp tahini, a little more olive oil, no paprika, dried parsley flakes mixed in (instead of fresh as a garnish, 1 tsp cumin, a dash of black pepper, and an unmeasured amount of onion powder.  Very yummy!  But I really think the onion powder is a must.

This wasn't the best hummus I've ever had. Too much garlic for me, I'm used to very little or no garlic in my hummus. Also I used less tahini than called for because I was concerned about the amount. I think if I made this again I would omit  garlic. Remember to keep the chickpea liquid because this is VERY thick if you don't add some back in (not sure why it doesn't mention that).

This was great! I made alterations (I think you're supposed to, right? It's hummus), including more than a dash of Mrs Dash- tomato basil garlic blend. Sooooo good.

The only downside, if you can call it that, was that the flavors were so powerful and awesome it made all other food tasteless and stupid. I had to brush 3 times to enjoy dessert later lol

Too much tahini for my taste, but the recipe as a whole is easily modified to taste.  Next time I will only use two tablespoons tahini per two cups chickpeas.

A good, easy recipe - but I double the garlic. Sometimes I roast half a red pepper and add it in, too. Very flexible. 

Makes a ton, so be prepared to freeze half of it unless you eat hummus at an insane rate!

This recipe was amazing. My only problem was that the garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and garlic didn't initially blend as smoothly as I would've liked. I don't know if this was due to my food processor (it's a good Cuisinart though), or the lack of oil. I added a little oil to the blend and it seemed to help. I also ended up splitting the hummus, and putting in a roasted red pepper-- that variety was so delicious. Adding the oil on top is a must to prevent it from drying and cracking.
After making this, my friends and I both felt like we will never buy hummus again.

This was my first attempt at Hummus and it was wonderful!  My whole family loved it!  I served it with pita chips and celery as an appetizer.  I don't have a food processor and resorted to using my blender - I don't recommend this method.  I'll be investing in a processor soon, because I had to do this in small batches in the blender and it took much longer than it should have.  But with that said, it was definately worth the time & effort and this recipe I will make again and again!

Followed advice of "The Head" with a few tweeks and it turned out great.  I think the lightening up on the lemon juice and tahini saved my hummus. Too tart would have been icky.  I used my own dried garbanzos and added 1ts. onion powder! Yummy! oh dried parsley worked just fine ;-)

great easy recipe! i did 'alter' the recipe a bit and that was only because i didnt read correctly. i added the chopped parsley and the paprika directly to it before i processed. i do agree that there is a little too much tahini, as it is slightly bitter, but nothing you can not fix. i did add 3 cloves of chopped garlic and it really was fantastic. a delicious, quick, healthy snack. i served with wheat pitas, that i just microwaved for about 10 seconds to warm them up.

I maded it and although I made a few mistakes it came out good! The first time I tried it was in a restaurant called Opa in Orlando. I fell in love with their hummus.  I'll keep trying though.

What I did do different is that instead of adding parsley, I added cilantro. I liked it a lot!

This is a good recipe however I start w/ dried chick peas, cook them obviously. Absolutely must save some of the water for thinning out. Real lemon juice and I also grind up some crushed red pepper.....As one reviewer wrote needs adjusting to individual tastes....but surely a winner

First time making hummus and it was a great recipe!  I did take the reviews into consideration, because I love my hummus with a lot of garlic (I added 3 cloves of garlic) and the warm heat of red pepper flakes.

I have made this recipe several times and really like it.  I have not found tahini in the stores I shop at. I make my own with roasted sesame seeds and olive oil since these items are available to me.  The Tahini paste does add a nice hint of nutty flavor.

The recipe asked for too much tahini in my opinion and was really dry. There wasn't enough liquid and it clumped up a lot. Just from my experience

Awesome.  Best I've made, maybe the best I've had.  Added only 2 T of Tahini.  Threw in a tsp of cumin and crush red pepper flakes.  Upped the amount of garlic to 5 cloves (4 would probably be better).  Used fresh lemon.  Didn't have parsley, so it was left out.  
RESULT: Sheer deliciousness.  Highly recommended recipe, will have your friends raving at the next pitch-in.

I recently used this recipe at a baby shower and it was a hit! It's a staple at my house and healthy snack. I also use a pinch of crushed red pepper and cumin when blending the mixture for a little more kick.

Great recipe. Would've given it 5 stars, but I made some slight adjustments to taste. A great base recipe for hummus.

This was my first time making hummus. I used to work in a Greek diner so i know what really could hummus tastes like. I personally thought there was WAY too much lemon in this. On the other hand i did not use any tahini so im guessing there was a flavor in that, that was definitely  lacking. next time i will add the tahini and hopefully be much happier!

Although I I love to come to allrecipes because they have so many of the recipes that I have been looking for, it is kind of frustrating when people just copy from another source.  This recipe is from goop recipes used for a cleanse.  It has no red pepper in it because that is not allowed on the cleanse diet.  Very good hummus though.  My absolute favorite!!

I agree with other reviewers-- less tahini. I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and 2 tablespoons of tahini and that was a little too much. I'm going to blend some more beans in tonight to mellow it a little. Otherwise, it's great and I can modify to suit my tastes. Husband also liked it.

Perfect recipe for hummus.  Save a little of the garbanzo juice and add to mix if you like it a little smoother.  I heartily recommend following this recipe to the "T" before diddling around with the ingredients.  Simple, un-pretentious, and good.  I'm adding this one to my repertiore.

The recipes is a bit too sour unless the hummus is refrigerated to mellow out. Cumin is definitely a necessity. I used freshly cooked garbanzo beans which probably didn't process as well as canned beans but tastes "fresher".

Texture and Taste is very good.  Much better than what you buy at the grocery.  I did have to add some water from the bean can and more garlic.  If you double or triple the recipe, be sure to blend the beans one can at a time as it taxes the blender or food processor!  When serving, pour EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) over the top to prevent it from drying out.  Enjoy!

Delicious. First time making hummus. I put it in a blender. I used 1 can chickpeas drained, 1 oz lemon juice, 2 tsp garlic, 1 tsp olive oil,3 tbs tahini. I saved some juice from the can to make it smoother and then added a little red pepper spice and a little bit of cumin. IT IS SO DANG GOOD! I will be making this often! I'm sure many people will want this recipe after knowing I can make this. Plus it is so freakin easy to make. Super easy recipe for a pot luck or just at home.

I think this is the best basic hummus I've ever made.  As written, however, the hummus was way to thick for my taste.  I added water to the food processor until it was the consistency I wanted.

The recipe was good. I myself added some margarine and parmesan cheese, which softened it up and added a little more flavor.

This recipe is very popular whenever I serve it. Simple to make, yet it exceeds the store bought hummus available around here in both quality and price. I often add a pinch of ground cumin and ground coriander seeds for a slightly different and "exotic" flavor.

This was pretty good. I added an extra small clove of garlic because I felt it needed a little more "something." I may try some red pepper next time. Also the 16 servings really make a lot. I think next time I may cut it in half, unless I am having a big party! There were 4 of us snacking and there was a lot leftover. But overall a tasty treat that I will save and make again!

I gave this 3 stars because I made a few changes.  1/4 C of lemon juice seemed like a lot to me, so I just did 1/8 C, and added in an additional 2T of olive oil.  It was still way too lemony for me. I wound up adding in another 2 C of garbanzo beans and it was still pretty strong for me.   Added in 1/8C of onion, but it wound up being a bit much, but that's my fault. I'd just do a T instead  I used smoked paprika (which I like better) instead of normal paprika.   I didn't have parsley, but I used dried Rosemary instead (just a pinch)  It came out alright, but I would definitely add a lot less lemon juice, maybe 1T if that, maybe 2t. Point being, I'd slowly add the lemon juice to avoid having a large batch of over-lemoned hummus.

Awesome!  Reserve the juice from the garbanzo beans and add to food processor to get the consistency you like.  Also added a drizzle of garlic olive oil and bumped up the garlic to 4 cloves.

this rocks! i made a double batch and took into consideration the edits that other people suggested. turned out fab! for the double batch i cut the tahini down to 4T and increased the garlic. i also added roasted red peppers (about 1/3 cup) and added cumin (1 teaspoon). it only sat in the fridge for about 30 minutes before i started digging into it. so good i can't stop eating it!

First hummus recipe i made from scratch, and it was okay. I thought there was too much tahini...next time I would double the garlic and lemon and half e tahini, which has a bitter taste and is the most expensive ingredient.

I use a good splash of olive oil and a full third of a cup of tahini. The secret to making it really creamy though is to pour a thin stream of water into the food processer as its whirring. Hard to go wrong with these ingrediants! serve with sweet potato tortilla chips!

This is really yummy and easy to make-- so much cheaper, too, than buying those tiny packages at the store.  I don't like tahini really well, so I cut it down to a 1/4 cup and added more olive oil.  It turned out great!

I thought it turned out great.  I didn't have any problems with it being too thick.  I didn't have any paprika so I used crushed red peppers instead.  Next time I'll add more peppers for a bit of a kick and try adding some olives to it.  It think it's a good recipe that can be played with.

I'm so EXCITED about this recipe!  It's so easy and healthy.  I did read the reviews and followed the suggestions to add small amounts first of tahini, lemon juice, and salt and add more as needed.  My family loved!

If this is your first time making hummus, I would suggest scaling down the lemon and tahini, and adding it bit by bit until you get the taste you prefer. It can also be thinned out very easily with water or olive oil. After home-made, you will never do store-bought again.

My mom makes two batches of hummus one without the tahini to cut down on calories and it turns out to be really good I actually prefer it that way.

I made my own tahini and left out the parsley, and this was some of the best hummus i've ever had. A food processor is crucial and extra lemon juice is key for citrus zest.

This was very easy and delicious.  Next time I make these, I will not add as much salt.  The canned chickpeas already had enough, so it ended up  being a little on the salty side.

Super easy and very good.  I used 2 cans of beans, 1tsp of cumin and 4tbsp of tahini and thinned with the juice from the beans.  Also used 4 cloves of garlic.  Intial taste test says, "fabulous" but can't wait to try it in a few hours after the flavors have melded together.  Oh, and I just blended the olive oil in at the end:)

i used black sesame instead of white sesame to make the tahini. the hummus itself is really tasty. BUT i had trouble mixing the ingredients. they were too dry when put together. I had to add some water when blending.  How to solve this problem. Using a smaller blender.

Excellent Base recipe! I used roasted garlic. Despite the recommendations of the reviewer below... I threw it all in the blender and blended until creamy... yup yup yup. This is a keep and the new popular recipe of the house! PS: Amazing on sandwiches, burgers, etc... GREAT protein source, very healthy!

Excellent.  Instead of canned garbanzo beans I bought a bag and made those fresh, then I made it just as directed in my blender and it came out great.  I just got home from a few weeks in the middle east and it tastes just like it did over there.  I do not like the store bought hummus at all.    I could see that this would be good with red pepper added in as well.  I'm so happy to finally find a good hummus dip!

This recipe is great... I did add 1/4 each of cumin and cayenne pepper as others suggested, and also used 2 whole cans of beans instead of just 2 cups.  It ended up being 3 cups of beans, but the finished product was still delicious!!  I will try roasting the garlic before adding it next time =)

I have been making this recipe for two years now.  The only adjustments needed is to add liquid for a smoother texture.  I prefer to add more garlic than what is called for.  Great Recipe.

This is the BEST hummus I have ever tried and it was my first time making some. My only adjustments were 1/2 tsp of red pepper and 1/2 tsp of cumin. Came out perfect and better than the stuff you buy in the stores.

This was great.  I used dried beans and should have used fresh lemon juice, but will next time.  I used about a cup of cooking liquid from the beans to thin this out and also used extra garlic. This is a great base recipe to play around with and customize to your own tastes.

This was very easy and tasty, however it was missing something to make it taste like restaurant or store bought. After reading the reviews, I realized it was the cumin. Upon adding that, it was fantastic! I'll be using this recipe again and again, instead of spending $5 on it at the grocery!

Excellent!  This is my first experience preparing hummus and it came out delicious.  It was rather dry, so I ended up drizzling in olive oil while it was processing until I got the right consistency for dipping.  I didn't read the reviews until after I made it and found out that you should put some of the bean liquid in the mix.  But the olive oil worked fine and it tasted great!  I served it with pita chips.

Just made it and really like it, I would suggest tracking  down the tahini(near olives @ my grocery store) and i increased the garlic for my own personal taste. Also think it will be even better after it blends together.

I'm not sure if this will replace my store bought hummus addiction, but it turned out pretty good overall. I agree with the suggestions to include some of the liquid from the chickpeas, but even then I found the recipe to be a little thick. I only used 2 tablespoons of tahini and added about 1/4 cup of milk at the end to thin it out-- that helped, but I think it could have used a bit more liquid even with the milk added. Also, since I'm a garlic lover I added an extra clove of garlic and about an 1/8 tsp. red pepper and ended up regretting it. The hummus ended up a little too bitey for me but it was pretty good in the end when I served it with Peppy's Pita Bread recipe. I'm definitely going to try this one again with less garlic and more liquid.

I loved this although i didn't have fresh parsley. Mine ended up a bit thick like cookie dough. i added more garlic than asked for and I used dried chick peas that I had soaked for 12 hours and then cooked for 45 minutes. Next time, I think I'll use some of the water from the cooked chick peas because it ended up too thick. i didn't want to add too much oil. Great taste though!

Awesome Recipe! Added an extra clove of garlic and some cumin. Only 2 Tbsp. of Tahini and just used the juice of one lemon. I used the reserved Chickpea juice to thin it out... I did this in my blender/food processer and it was a little difficult although I think it might be easier if I did small amounts at a time rather than trying to blend it in one big batch.  Great basic recipe! :)

This recipe has great flavor, but I only add one heaping tablespoon of tahini, and I reserved some of the garbanzo bean juice and added it to the blender to get a the entire mixture to blend completely.

Favorite hummus so far! Very versatile - you can add any number of extra ingredients to it. Roasted red pepper and basil is a good combination.

Best hummus I've ever had.  I boiled down my own beans instead of using canned, and along with some liquid from the beans, I added 1-2 tbsp of olive oil when I was blending to make the hummus more smooth and creamy.  Turned out great!

I've tried so many hummus recipes in the past year, and I had about given up when I came across this.  Boy am I glad I tried it! This is the best hummus I've ever had! Period!  I omitted the olive oil because I don't like greasy/oily foods and substituted cumin for the paprika.  With some toasted pita bread it can not be beat!

So good!!!  I usually buy the Sabra brand hummus and it's getting kind of expensive since I eat it so much.  This recipe tasted nearly the same and I think even better because it was homemade!  I did add extra garlic and I like roasted red pepper so I blended some of that up too.  I used a hand held mixer because it was way too thick for my blended.  It worked perfectly for me.  I can't wait for my husband to try this!

Peel or boil chickpeas for a very smooth texture.  Also I found that as the recipe, as written, it is a little to bland for my taste, I added ground cumin and extra garlic and this really pumped up the taste.  I also added some olive oil while I was mixing.

Yummy! As people's diets around us are more diverse, hummus wins for just about everyone! It's vegan, gluten free and sugar free! Serve it with vegetable sticks and it's a winner!  I peel my chickpeas, yes this is laborious, to make the hummus smoother. I personally add cumin to the mix.  Enjoy! We will be enjoying as our appetizer for Thanksgiving today.

This recipe is definitely the basic foundation for some good hummus. I added cinnamon (a dash or two to taste) and instead of using salt I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, which gave it a little kick and more diverse flavor. And whoa man, you do not need the full amount of tahini! Use half that amount and add more if you want after you've tasted it. Also, I used a little more olive oil than the recipe called for because it makes the texture fluffier. Yum yum!

With these slight modifications...it turned out fabulous: I added a few shakes of ground cumin..helps give it an extra flavor kick. I've also added roasted red peppers or a few olives to the party.  To make it creamier in consistency, slowly drizzle olive oil in through the top of the processor while its running.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe! I did not take the advice of other reviewers about reserving bean juice and definately will next time I make this. The taste however was fantastic! I love hummus and was not disappointed. My vegetarian son gobbled this up. Thanks so much for sharing. I have already had people asking for the recipe.

Definitely use a processor on this.  I thought the motor on my blender was going to burn out trying to blend this and it's practically new.  In summary repeating what folks said before: reserve chickpea water for consistency, start w/ 3T of tahini and go up from there, start w/ 1 clove garlic and go up from there.  Good stuff!

This was a very good basic recipe. I tripled the garlic, and added less tahini. I divided the finished hummus into 3 bowls and made a trio of hummus. The first was the basic recipe topped with paprika, the second was roasted red pepper, and the third was cilantro jalapeno hummus. I brought it to a party along with the baba ganoush recipe on here, and everyone loved it, especially the cilantro one.

First time making Hummus from scratch. Had no idea how simle it was to make. Added some olive tapinade and fennel seed. Served with homemade baked whole grain pita chips. This stuff will not last long around here. Yummy.

I agree with a previous reviewer...be careful with the Tahini.  I had never cooked with it before, and yowsa that is some sticky, bitter stuff.  The garlic (and I would consider myself a garlicaholic) was spicy and only slightly mellowed after several days - I'm going to keep looking.

the flavour of this hummus was pretty good---i added more lemon juice and more garlic to suit...the texture, however, was very dry, no matter how much i processed it; i should have saved some of the liquid from the chickpeas and used that---i'll know for next time

I think the trick here is to start w/the chickpeas, save liquid for possible use, one clove of garlic, half the tahini, half the lemon juice..then taste, adjust to your personal taste by adding a little bit of each and taste until you get the consistency and taste you desire.  I think this tends to work better b/c not all tahini is created equal, some garlic is stronger, etc. By doing it this way you are less likely to waste precious ingredients (my Tahini was almost $10!).  Mine came out perfect by doing it this way.  I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of cumin too.  I topped w/good EVOO, fresh parsley, and homegrown tomatoes...YUM!  I should also add that I didn't add salt since my beans were canned w/sodium.  My final version used a tad less tahini and a couple extra squeezes of lemon juice than the recipe called for, along w/ about 2TB of the liquid from the canned beans.  You won't go back to the store EVER to buy hummus, easy and healthy!

I think everyone' BEST hummus is different.  The ingredients in this recipe are definitely mandatory, but the amounts vary to taste.  I add in small increments till it tastes just right.  I also blend in the olive oil and parsley.  I couldn't find paprika, but crushed red pepper works.  Last time I added some jarred red peppers too.

This is really good and so easy.  What I really like is that it is so easy to add/subtract to make it to your taste.  My husband loves hummus and I can't wait for him to try it.  More garlic is for sure needed!

ADD WATER! Or bean liquid. Or something like that.  I put in ingredients as directed and just kept going in my food processor and it was chunks.  So I added more oil and it was still all chunks.  Then I added water and presto! It became a paste.  Very yummy, very authentic, after you have it blended you can tweak as you like (I like it kind of lemony).

This recipe is fantastic. I read a few reviews and decided to use about 1/5 cup of tahini (I'm not a huge fan) and a little extra paprika. However, I made the mistake of adding 3 fresh cloves of garlic and, although I LOOOOOOOOVE garlic, it was a little too much. I'm making falafel for dinner and I think, despite my overabundance of garlic, it should be a nice pairing. :)

First off this can not be done in a blender. Not the right consistancy. Recipe calls for way too much salt and tahini. I am glad I read reviews first. I made several times and have added roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes. Both very good. Good base recipe with modifications.

This recipe worked great with less than 1/2 tsp of salt. I suggest starting with that and adding more to taste. I also found I had to add some water to get the right consistency.

My first try at hummus and it was delicious. I took it to my son and daughter-in-law's baby shower and everyone loved and wanted left-over.  I added an extra clove of garlic and a 2-3 quick pours of olive oil while still in the food processor.

I made this as is for a large gathering of kids/adults for a Greek Theme night.  I kind of thought people would be a little shy of it but they tried it, loved it and came back for seconds and thirds.  It's a winner recipe and good for you.

Really good.  Added a little extra lemon juice and reduced the amount of salt by a third.  Next time will reduce the amount of tahini by a third and added back in if needed.

Yum! This hummus was very tasty, but the recipe does not call for enough liquid. I ended up having to add the oil to the hummus while it was processing because it was so thick. I also added several tablespoons of water to make it smoother. With these additions, the hummus turned out very smooth and creamy, and looked great with the paprika and parsley topping! Those in my family who like hummus really loved this! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a good recipe, but i would suggest taking down the lemon juice just a bit and adding water instead. it gets too sour with the lemon juice and is quite dry if you don't add water. turned out delicious otherwise!

Fantastic! Of course, hummus is all about what you want, but between this recipe, and all of the reviews, you have such a great base here to make a true hummus that you love. I used about 4 tsp tahini, 14 oz can chick peas (drained but ended uo adding about 1/2 the liquid back in to get good consistancy), 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 5 garlic gloves, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp olive oil in it. Then served with a little more olive oil drizzeled over and paprika and parsley on top. My next, and probably only change I will make next time is cut back on the salt just a little bit. Couldnt stop eatting this one!  Thanks!

The first time I made this I used raw garlic cloves--overwhelmed the hummus.  The second time I roasted the garlic cloves and then added.  Perfect.

Excellent recipe! I added a little bit more garlic, some cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, and the reserved liquid from the garbanzo beans. It was SO delicious, even though it smelled like garlic in the house the entire day! Yum yum yum!!

Tasty...I added the paprika into the mixture instead of sprinkled on top.  Also added some ground cumin.  Omitted the parsley since I did not have any.  Went heavy on the lemon juice.  Yummy.

I love this recipe as is.  However, most of the time I make these few changes: 1 clove garlic about 1 teaspoon CUMIN and... if I don't feel like paying 5 bucks for a jar of tahini; I buy sesame seeds in bulk, roast (a must) about 3 tablespoons in the oven, and replace the tahini with that. Because I prefer roasting the sesame seeds I try to roast them while I have something else in the oven to save energy! :]

Outstanding recipe that I have used for about a few years now. I do like my hummus lemony and garlicky so I usually add a little more. I use the roasted garlic in the olive section of the salad bar at the store. I also add a few pinches of ground cumin. HMMMM

I followed the recipe exactly and it was fine, but certainly not great as far as Hummus goes.  It was really thick and pasty, and could have used more zip (probably more garlic, perhaps more lemon).

I enjoyed it anyway, but will try other recipes and if I use this one again, will experiment with it.

This was SO easy to make.  And the ingredients can be varied in amount any which way.  And if you add too much of something, just add some more beans!  Got endless compliments at a dinner party.  Wonder if I'll ever buy pre-made hummus again!  Yum yum!

This is a fab recipe!  My husband is Egyptian and a bit of a hummus snob ;).  We also live in the Middle East, so we get good hummus all the time around here.  We both loved this!  I did make a few changes.  I used a bit more than 1/3 cup of tihana, and squeezed the juice of a whole lemon into the mix.  I also chopped garlic, sauted it and then browned ground beef with it and added it to the hummus.  We munched on this with toasted arabic flat bread (pita works just as well), and it was a real hit!

I live in Japan, where hummus is hard to come by, and was totally jonesing a plate of hummus with mountains of pita bread, when I found this recipe.  I had two 15-ounce cans of garbanzo beans, and eyeballed the rest, having semi-memorized this recipe.  I even splashed in some balsamic vinegar by mistake, and it still ended up AWESOME!!!  I'd say prep time was 2 minutes, not 10.  I used an Osterizer blender, and texture turned out fine without using any reserved liquid from the beans.

1. Save about 2/3 of a can of juice.
2. Boil garbanzo beans for 10 min on low to get a smooth finish, otherwise it turns out grainy.

Very tasty!  I cut back to 1/4 cup tahini, which was plenty.  I also cut down on the salt a little, but still keep it close to 1 tsp.  I have already made this several times to keep on hand during the week for a healthy snack.

Excellent!!! I used three cloves of garlic, added cumin, cayenne and reserved the bean juice for thinning out. Also, I only used two tablespoons of Tahini. Thank you!

First time I have ever written but felt I really needed to after trying this Hummus - WHAT A WINNER!!

I followed as per the recipe but doubled the ingredients and am going to try freezing some as per another suggestion. I used "fresh" chick peas and soaked and boiled. I also used unhulled tahini so it was not as bitter. I also added a little water because my blender could not get through it easily but was still very thick once pureed.

I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Better than the Summer Fresh store bought. I enjoy the thicker texture. I added a 1/4 cup water to mine and used 2tbsp of tahini. It was almost too much tahini, so I am glad I put just that in.

Oh how I was craving  hummus and it is hard to find here in Germany but not any more!  I thought this recipes was delicious!  I have to give it 4 stars because for my taste the Tahini had to be cut back a bit but that is why it is great to read other reviewers comments before trying it out yourself.  I really love allrecipes and glad that I have away from home!

This recipe was good, but I had to tweak it alot. I added more salt and lemon juice and more olive oil. Make sure to taste and adjust the ingredients before serving.

Was looking for a quick hummus recipe and I ended up using this one with great results.  As suggested by other reviewers, I saved the liquid from the garbanzo beans to make a smoother hummus.  I also didn't have tahini readily available, so I made one with a blender using a cup of roasted sesame seeds and adding olive oil (maybe about 2-3 Tbps.) until I ended up with a pourable liquid.    After reserving a portion of tahini, I just used the same blender in order to make my hummus - and I was able to omit the olive oil in the recipe that way.

This is so good! I can never find Tahini at the grocery store, so I just threw 1/4 cup of roasted sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp of Oil in. It really came out great. I would recommend blending everything with half of the chick peas before adding the rest. It will help make it smoother so there are no garlic chunks.

Good recipe, though I found I needed to add a little liquid to thin it out some.  Was really good after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Will use this recipe again!

Delicious! Reserve the liquid from the beans because you will probably have to add it to the hummus, because I think it's just too dry w/o it. I used about 1/4 of a cup of liquid. I used 3 cloves of garlic, a little less than 1/3 cup tahini. I served this at a bday party and it was a big hit, definitely a keeper...thanks for posting.

I did not care for this. I think that canned beans create a very chunky texture, it should be smooth. And it's about 1/2 cup shy on the tahini.

Definitely will make this again.

This was delicious.  I used dried chickpeas, which I soaked then cooked in a pressure cooker, and I think it made the taste so much better (I've made hummus many times from canned chickpeas.  I didn't measure the other ingredients, just to taste really, but my 2 year old daughter gobbled this up in a pita stuffed with hummus, cucumber, tomato and cheddar cheese.

I never really "got it" with hummus.   I wouldn't have missed it if I never ate it again in my life.  Hub's vegan daughter was coming over and he made up this recipe.  I'm a convert to it now.  It tasted!  The other stuff I've had really had no taste, just texture.  I couldn't stop eating this stuff.  I'll have to start building a whole meal off of this starter.  Thanks for sharing this!

Nice base - I think I'll tinker with it next time.  My only complaint is it was really thick (I even added some of the liquid from the drained beans) and became thicker after sitting overnight in the fridge.  Oh, I also agree thatn 1/3 c tahini is too much - it definitely makes the hummus bitter.  Also, I had a hard time getting this creamy - it has a grainy feel to it.  UPDATE:  I made this again and used a blender (not a Magic Bullet) and was able to get it creamy smooth. Yay!

Great recipe just as it is.  But also very flexible if you want to use it as a base to do your own thing.  Personally I like my hummus with a little less tahini and little more lemon and garlic.  Whatever you do be sure to drain the garbanzo beans unless you like your hummus *really* runny.

IMHO, everyone should read the 'most helpful' reviews. Since tahini is not available where I am, I had to attempt to make that from scratch (I used a recipe from about.com). My blender is a piece of _____ and since the tahini recipe ingredients barely reached the blade, I mostly had a mixture of mushed of sesame seeds and water. Because of all that water- I didn't need to thin mine with the bean juice. Overall, this was great- as long as you adjust to taste.

Yummy! Now I only give it 4 stars because I changed it and the base was kinda bland. I added an extra 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 cup of cilantro...I was trying to mimic the cilantro hummus from that famous bread place everyone loves to eat (pan er a).

3.5 stars--I tried hummus years ago and decided that I didn't really like it. The other day, a co-worker let me try some hummus she had made and I loved it, so I went home to try it myself. I tried the recipe as is and didn't like it, so I added chopped fresh jalapenos and a few sprinkles of cumin... I also messed with the other proportions. Sooo glad I didn't add the whole tahini amount, it was way overpowering and bitter. Normally I used store bought lemon juice while cooking, but with this recipe, it just doesn't taste the same, so I used 2.5 tiny lemons for the juice. I'm a little disappointed... hopefully it will taste better once it's chilled.

I thought the proportions were perfect.  Very delicious.  I added some crushed red pepper to one part of the batch.

This was so good.  I did add a tsp of red chilis and also a little cumin instead of paprika and thinned it out with 2 tbsp of the chickpea juice but it was delicious and got lots of compliments at work.

Great recipe.  Very simple.  I added extra garlic and loved it, but really there is enough garlic in the recipe to begin with and a little bit more goes a long way.

I made this exactly as written (that's my own rule for reviewing recipes- make it the way it was intended the first time!)  This has too much lemon and a little too much tahini for my and my husbands taste, but it is a very good starting point for tweaking it the way we like it.

I know this already has plenty of reviews, but I was SO impressed that I had to add one too. I usually hate most store bought hummus, they are too tangy and almost funky to me.  This was awesome!  It really can be customized. I added 5 cloves of garlic and used only 3T of lemon juice. It was fantastic. You can customize it anyway you want. Just think of the possibilities. Roasted red pepper,  or roast the garlic first, or add cumin and use pinto beans to slather on nachos or a tortilla. It is endless! Thanks for the great recipe.

This hummus was soooo good!  I used 2 cans of beans and then followed others suggestion and added cumin.  I'm not a huge  fan of adding olive oil over dishes when they are done, so omitted the oil on top.  I did use a little bit of the chick pea juice while blending.  I can't wait to dip into it tonight when I have guests over!

I used one can of garbanzos, 1/4 cup tahini, and added 3/4 cup cilantro. This was my first attempt at hummus and I was very pleased. I'll be making this agin. Very quick and easy!

This was really really good. I followed other suggestions and just used 3 T of tahini and that was perfect. 

I added a little ground chipotle too and WOW it's delicious.

Very good recipe!  Now I never have to buy hummus at the store and wonder if it's going to be a good one.  This was so easy.  I do recommend taking it easy on the tahini at first until you get it right, I only used 2 Tablespoons and it was just right for me.  I love lemon juice and this had a good zing.  You may also want to be careful with the garlic for a party.  I thought 2 cloves was perfect but some of my guests complained that it was too "spicy" with the raw garlic taste.  I didn't read the recipe all the way and blended in the oil and parsley, but it still turned out good.  I would highly recommend making this the night before if possible.  This tasted much better after blending in the fridge.  Thanks, this is a great one!

This was the first time I made Hummus and it turned out well and was very easy.  I just think it needed more spice/flavor to it.  However, I did get a lot of complements on it.

I've added 2 tbsp of oil to the recipe to make it more creamy, and doubled the dose of lemon juice.  I don't usually salt my recipes but in this one it really makes a difference, without it the hummus tastes more bitter

I think this is a good base, but I have made it three times and it always comes out too thick.  Not sure what I am doing wrong.  It is good with some of the bean liquid or extra olive oil added.  As written it is just too thick.

This is wonderful hummus!!  I did add a pinch of cumin to mine and I had to add extra oil and water to smooth it  out.  Otherwise, it would have been way too thick.  Next time I'll just use the liquid from the beans.  Other than that, it was fantastic.

this is a delicious and authentic recipe.  i also added cumin (1 tbsp i think) and a whole head of roasted garlic instead of the fresh garlic.  i used extra olive oil and water to thin it down.  lemon juice, tahini, roasted garlic, and cumin make the best flavor combination!

great hummus. I substituted an asian type of sesame paste for the tahini because that's what I had on hand. But I reduced it to 2 T because I thought the toasted sesame flavor could be stronger. A 15 oz can yields a little less than 2 cups of beans, so I just reduced everything by a little bit. And then I used reserved bean juice to get the right consistency. It definitely improved in flavor as it sat in the fridge for a couple hours. Perfect with Peppy's Pitas from this site!

Loved it!  Couldn't believe how much it tastes like the hummus you get in Middle Eastern restaurants.  And very easy to make, too.  The only change I made was to add an extra clove of garlic.

Everyone I made this for loved it! I didn't have any tahini, so I used peanut butter instead. I blended everything in the blender at the same time. I had to add more liquid because my blended was having trouble blending it up, but it was still a good consistency.

Fantastic!  Exactly as IMANKAY says.  The reason it tastes like a garbanzo bean dip, is because that's what it IS.  Lovely colour and texture.  Do keep the can's liquid--you will need some...  I used 3 - 4 T.  I had to be patient with the blender--I had to open it and stir often.  At first taste, it was like, whoa!, garlic!, but then after a few bites I thought could use up to 4 fresh cloves.  Toasted pita wedges and all kinds of veggies worked wonderfully here.  Best I've tasted.  Thank you!  mjjk

DELICIOUS! Just as good as many resturants that we have tried. My mom and sister-in-law even liked it and have tried hummus before and have not liked it. This recipe is awesome. I added cayenne pepper on top because I didn't have paprika. It gave it a good spice. This recipe is awesome!

The PERFECT base recipe!  Couldn't get any easier than this. Like other reviewers, I used more garlic (3 large cloves worked nicely) and 2 cans of beans including the liquid.  I also added some cumin and cayenne pepper and it's just how I like it.  Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious and very easy to make.  Next time I might add a little less tahini.

I have made this recipe several times as our family loves Lebanese food, especially hummus.  My husband gave great comments on this recipe as it's just as good as restaurant's humus.  The only change I made in this recipe is to use whole can of garbanzo beans with liquid so it would not be too thick.  Very easy and good recipe.

This was okay...I followed the recipe exactly, but I think it was missing something... needs more garlic for sure.  I think some coconut milk might help as well.

This is great. I experiment with the recipe every time that I make just so that I can always have something different.  Try using sundried tomato or other dried spices to "jazz" this up... it makes a great base recipe.

Simple and tasty! Great to have in the fridge as a healthy snack. I put only half a teaspoon of salt the second time I made it, found it a little too salty the with one teaspoon.

I am by no means a hummus expert, but this has the most wonderful flavor! As a garlic-aholic, I used a clove or two more than the recipe calls for. Other than that, I followed it precisely and got wonderful results. Thank you SO much for this fabulous recipe. I can't wait to test it on some friends who know their hummus.

This hummus was good, but I used only 3/4 of the tahini, as I thought the taste would come out too strong.  It was fine without all the tahini.  My friends complimented me on the wonderful appetizer.

This was very good.  I think we need to invest in a food processor, because the Tahini really struggled in our blender.

Wonderful!!  Added 1 tbsp cumin, and 1 tsp cayenne, less lemon juice and only about 1/4 cup tahini.  Also, added some of the liquid from the chic peas to smooth out texture.

I have made this hummus twice and I like the recipe. I think it needs a little more zest to it so I would recommend adding more lemon juice (which would help it blend better, as others mentioned.) This recipe goes very well with the Pita Chips recipe you can also find on this site.

Divine.  I used about half the tahini required and it came out great.  Served it to a party of about 20 people and it disappeared in minutes--everyone thought it was store bought!

This is the first time I tried hummus, and I thought it was really good!  I put 1/3 cup in a pita, with mozzarella, parsley and lettuce leaves.  Very yummy.  I think I added too much garlic, though, as it was a bit spicy.  But very good.

Loved this recipe and have made it twice so far.  My only modifications were a touch more lemon juice (personal preference and additional liquid was needed for the blender) and the use of roasted garlic versus the sharpness of raw garlic; once again, personal preference.  Never will I buy store bought hummus again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, although a little difficult to make using a blender.  I recommend making this recipe in two small batches if using a blender.  The flavour of the hummus was great, but I would probably add less tahini next time.

Great!! Will make again. I used a teaspoon and a half of sesame seeds, instead of the tahini, as one reviewer did. I also used half of the lemon juice and added a dash of cumin.

I love this recipe and make it often, it really is restaurant-quality hummus, or even better.  I make it exactly as the recipe says, but I cut down the salt and sometimes throw in half a jalapeno or some chili powder to make it spicy if we're in the mood.  Also, it definitely needs extra water added (probably 1/3 cup at least) to make it blend smooth.

This is the BEST Hummus recipe I've tried yet.  My husband can eat the entire portion in one sitting.  I serve it with strips of carrots and celery, as well as salt-free nacho chips and other good quality unflavored crackers.  For a twist, I will add a piece of roasted red pepper (about 2 inch square).  YUMMY!

Wow, the best hummus I've ever made!  I increased the garlic.  It was a little dry, I would add water to thin it to desired consistency.

This hummus is fantastic! I made it for dinner this week and my entire family loved it. I didn't alter the recipe at all and I don't think it could have gotten any better!

Pretty good...I dont think it needed that much tahini as it was a bit overpowering. I substituted w/ lemon juice the second time I made it. Thanks! very good :)

This is the best hummus I've ever had, which is a lot. I added some cumin for extra taste and also just blended the olive oil in directly . It was delicious and tasted just as good as the authentic restaurant down the street!

A great hummus recipe. You can really taste the lemon, some reviewers found it to be to much but I liked it. I also added a couple of teaspoons of cumin and 2 extra cloves of garlic. I also blended the parsley and paprika right in. Really good with veggies or you can take a pizza slicer and cut up you pita into triangles like a pizza, drizzle with olive oil and coarse salt and bake at 400 for about 5 min or until crisp, Yumm.

REally good recipe. I also agree with the others that it has too much lemon. I recommend adding it a little at a time until it tastes right to you.

This is definetly a KEEPER. I made the recipe as directed with a couple of minor changes...I added extra garlic, which we love and while it was processing in the food processor, I added the olive oil and paprika.  I also reserved some of the Garbanzo beans juice and added it while it was blending...just a few tablespoonfuls made it nice and smooth.  A great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  So easy to make - I'll never buy store-bought hummus again.  Served it up with the Tabbouleh III recipe found on this site, plus feta chunks, olives and the Naan bread, and made for an excellent Mediterranean feast.  Thanks!

Very good hummus recipe!  This is the best basic hummus I have made so far.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have a few suggestions just to change it up once in a while: I don't add the toppings and then I add red peppers (spicy) and sometimes one or two tablespoons of white truffle oil. YUM.  Try it!

Wow! I can't stop eating this. It is so yummy. I also did as suggested and added the drained liquid from the garbanzo beans to assist in the blending. I forgot to top with olive oil and other stuff but it's still good. Thanks!

I recently went on a trip to Houston and ate at a great little mediteranian place. They had all you could eat hummus and pitas. I have been craving it every since. My old Hummus recipe just didn't compare. This recipe was exactly what i was looking for. Fabulous!!! I now keep some on hand for emergency snacking. Hits the spot and healthy too! Thank you so much for this one.

This hummus is GREAT!!!  Only used probably 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and probably 2 tablespoons of homemade tahini.  Definitely will be fixing this alot!  Also added about 1/8 tsp. of ground chipotle powder.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!!

I halved the recipe (but kept the full amount of garlic!) and this came out excellent.  Tweaked somewhat with the addition of red pepper flakes, and left off the paprika and parsley garnish.  Also left off the olive oil on top, because, well, it seemed kind of weird and why add extra oil if you don't need it?  All in all it was an lovely consistency and tasted fantastic!

The tahihi and lemon were WAAAYYY too overpowering making it inedible after a few bites. Also, the amount of garlic the recipe calls for is inadequate.

I would have to say that this recipe comes really close. However- i did have to make a few alterations. As many others have said, this comes out very thick- so i thinned it down with quite a bit of the reserved liquid from the canned beans. Although i wont rate the recipe down for that- because Hummus really can be a thick dip to almost a sauce... Im hesatating between a 3 and a 4 stars, because the Tahini flavor in this was SO overpowering... I didnt have enough ingrediants to fix the ratios, but i will probably cut down the Tahini by half.. Its a necessary ingrediant obviously, but this much almost felt like it was burning my mouth. (anyone else get that with sesame things? like sesame oil?) 

Otherwise, good consistancy, and pretty much the right amounts of flavors... I didnt add the salt, and i also added maybe a teaspoon of baking soda. (It will break down some nutriants from the garbanzo beans, but i think really helps smooth out the dip) and a teaspoon or more of Cumin seed.

What a great, easy recipe.  Didn't make any changes.  The hardest thing was breaking them down in a blender, food processor would work much better.  Took me about 15 minutes digging out the thick paste at the bottom and pushing the still whole beans down to be pureed... I was happy to find Tahini at the grocery store in the Asian food isle, and rest of ingredients were simple.  Very tasty, would make this again!

I thought this was great. I had never attempted hummus before, but I can't imagine I will ever use another recipe. It was tough to get the nice, creamy texture in the blender; next time I'll try a food processor. I added a little bit of extra lemon juice and I might cut back just slighty on the tahini next time, but those are just personal preferences.

This was my first time trying hummus.  Not only is this SUPER TASTY and easy to make, it is healthy.  My picky step son loved it.  This will be used as our new sandwich spread in place of mayonaise.  

I have never bought garbanzo beans before, and had a hard time finding it.  I finally found them in the mexican food isle of our local supermarket.  I hope this will help anyone who may be in search of canned garbanzo beans.  :)

This recipe is super yummy!  I also implemented other reviewers suggestions including:  reserving liquid from beans to add to mixture and adding 1/2 tsp each of cumin and red pepper.  I added another clove of garlic - tasty, but the garlic stays with you for awhile.  Freezes well, too.  I have this served with the Pita Chips recipe and plain pita bread.

I had never made hummus til I tried this recipe, and I found one that I will stick with.  I make this all the time.  It's a healthy alternative to other dips.  I do find that it is a bit too dry to mix in the blender, and have had to add extra oil/lemon juice/oil.  I will try the suggestion to use the reserved water from the garbanzos.  Thanks for a winner!

I like this version of hummus because it doesn't go crazy on the garlic. I like to taste the rest of the ingredients along with the garlic! Great served with soft pita bread triangles for dipping.

The recipe comes out dry. 
I recommend adding water - no more than a quarter cup or until you receive a lighter consistency. Add this last to control the texture, then continue to blend and an extra clove of garlic if you really love garlic, but mince it fine. I always serve hummus on a plate drizzled with olive oil and  a light decorative dash of sumac (available at a lebanese or most middle eastern/indian market). 
I've posted a photo in a tupperware that I've set aside to give to a friend. Also great with fried pita bread. Cut the pita into triangles. Fry in hot oil (about 2 inches of oil) and flip regularly for even cooking.  Do not over brown, but make sure they're crispy. You can lightly season with salt but it's optional.

This is an excellent recipe for hummus... only change was to add more garlic...about 8 cloves, but we love garlic... goes great with the Kafta (Lebanese BBQ) recipe on this site...**addition** add garlic to taste and approx 1/8 tsp cumin! drizzle w/olive oil and sprinkle a little paprika on top before serving w/pita chips!!even better the next day-kids ate almost all of it themselves!

Absolutely delicious!  I cut garlic back to one clove, I love garlic but two cloves was a bit strong for most peoples taste.  I added fresh ground pepper,  2 tsp of paprika , 1 tbls of dijon mustard, and 1 tbls of honey to mixture.  Everytime I serve this everyone wants the recipe.  This is a great recipe to easily change flavors, try green onions, chives, red pepper, and dill for some alternatives. Try subing lime for lemon juice; cilantro for parsley; and throw some cumin in. Yum!

Fantastic. This recipe is very hard to screw up, and tastes great. I was able to use it in wraps and as a dip for veggies. For variety, I tried adding black olives to the blender, and that turned out quite well also. But just the hummus alone is simple and delicious.

This hummus is really good! Be sure to blend it to smooth to get the ultimate flavor. If you want it to look really authentic in presentation, do what the Israeli's do! Put some tahini in the middle of a plate and put the hummus around the tahini. Then drizzle olive oil in a thin stream around it and sprinkle peprika and olives all  I got this from my Israeli cousins. It looks awesome...and tastes awesome too!

Good but has way too much lemon, I´d scale it down to 1/8 cup. I also added more garlic and red pepper. I´ll definitely try it again, this time with a lot less lemon.

This is an excellent hummus recipe!  It is easy to make, easy to adjust, and tastes wonderful.  We followed the recipe exactly and decided that next time we will add only 1/3 c. fresh lemon juice as the 1/2 c. was a bit overwhelming.  Also, we will add one more garlic clove for a total of 3 because we love the stronger garlic taste.  The hummus tastes best when the consistency is not smooth..there should be some texture.  Also, the directions left out the part where you should mix the olive oil into the hummus after blending.  It said to just drizzle it on top. You want to make sure to blend it in well!

This is great hummus! Don't drain both cans, only one...use bean liquid to smooth it out. Red chili flakes give this recipe a kick as well as some nice colors. Thanks for this great recipe!

Okay, this hummus recipe rocks...I make it every week and keep it in the fridge for snacking.  I omit the olive oil and add double the garlic.  It's wonderful.  My husband has even been diving into my stash.  It's great with carrots, with pita bread or on a whole wheat wrapper and as an added bonus, it's pretty healthy.

This recipe was great after sitting for a few hours! Definitely let the flavors blend before you serve. I added 1/2 tsp. of cumin which made this dip perfect.

This was a good basic hummus.  It's quite thick.  I can see adding more garlic, more paprika, a bit of cayenne, cumin--lots of different flavors that you could bring to this.

Where is the 10 star rating for this one?? I've been looking for a good hummus recipe for a while.  I made it with two cans of garbanzo beans (3 cups) so I upped the other ingredients accordingly.  Delicious.  I can see what the others mean by it being a little too pasty but I'm okay with that.  I'm having it with Tostito Gold chips.. they're the really thick ones. YUM! :)   

Next time I'll add some more spices to it, cayenne comes to mind because it's a basic recipe.

This is only the second time I have eaten hummus, and I thought that this was okay after a few changes.  I went with the idea of only using 2 tbls. of tahini, and maybe I'm not used to the flavor, but I thought this was still too much for me.  Next time I'll use 1 tbl. instead.  I also used more garlic and lemon.  My boyfriend never said anything, but I don't think he was very fond of this.  I might make it again.

I start with dried beans and prepare them according to the package and then use them as described in this recipe.  That makes for VERY inexpensive hummus.  I also add a LOT more garlic (like 1/3 cup).  This recipe is fantastic....simple and just right.

I made this for a yoga retreat and everybody loved it!  I added sun-dried tomatoes and it was so good!  The only thing is if you add sun-dried tomatoes, stir it before you eat it to make it look a little more appetizing.  Easy, yummy recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I added more garlic though and next time I will probably reduce the tahini. Like many other reviewers, I reserved some of the bean juice to make it smoother.

I have made this twice so far, both times for parties; both times people raved. This is excellent--nicely lemony, creamy, and substantial. I like to eat this with celery and, I know it's unorthodox (!), but it's so good with bagel chips!

I have made,eaten and bought probably a hundred different kinds of hummus over the years and this was the first that I tasted and said,"Wow!This is good hummus!".Everyone that tasted it(and there were a lot)thought so too!The only change that I made was to add a little cayenne,because my husband likes things spicy.It still would have been just as good without though!

This recipe is fantastic!  It has totally turned me into a hummus fan.  I tried the dry mix a few years back and thought it was really gross.  This paired with "Peppy's Pita Bread" is so good!  I made it for a friend on Super Bowl Sunday and he raved about it.  Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent.  Will be making this a lot.  I have been buying a store brand of classic
hummus and this is much better.  Very easy to make.  It tasted better the next day after
sitting in fridge over night.  Flavors just seemed to come out more after sitting.  I don't
have a food processor, so I had to use my blender.  Worked great!  Took it to my 
grandparents who have never had hummus and they loved it.

I thought this Hummis was wonderful. I had a hard time finding the Tahini but finally found it at a health food store. I added more lemon because we love lemon in our family.  I also added a little olive oil and water to thin it out. This will be a holiday favorite in our home. The best I've ever had even better than the Hummis by cousin buys at a eastern resturant my daughter-in-law is even going to make it for her college class and she can't cook.

This was so easy and wonderful!!!! I only used the first five ingredients and I followed a couple of suggestions. I warmed the beans and used the bean juice to adjust the consistency. This is better than ANY hummus we have ever had!!!! Thanks!!

This recipe was generally good. Personally, I thought it was a little heavy on the tahini. I also prefer to roast the garlic first. it cuts down on the garlic "bite". It's all a matter of taste. I think a food processor would be better than a blender.

A lot of people are reluctant to try hummus, but let them taste this version once and they're hooked!  The tahini really makes the difference.  Serve with blue corn chips and you have a visually appealing appetizer too!

YUM!  Very impressive hummus!
I definitely had to add olive oil while blending, though, to keep the blender from "catching air".
Also, used cilantro instead of parsley.

I live in the Northwest where Hummus is an everyday item.  This was stated as "the best I've ever had"  by all of my friends.  I've made it on more than one occasion, and it is always loved.  I add a bit more juice and a tad bit water when blending the beans, just to make it easier. (I use my blender)  Thank you!

I followed other reviewers and added only 1 TBLS of toasted sesame seed oil as I didn’t have any tahini, I thought it worked well. I didn’t have any Meyer lemon so I added regular fresh lemon and thought the final result was a bit too lemony. Next time I’ll reduce the lemon juice to one cup. Also, I added 3 TBLS of extra virgin olive oil to help thin it out and while I thought that was the perfect amount my Greek husband thought I could add more. Overall, good solid recipe to start with!

My can of  garbanzo beans held 1.5 cups so I started with 1/4 cup think and 3 tbsp of lemon juice.  I should have saved the can juice but I didn't.  Reduced the salt but not the garlic.  I thinned it with half lemon juice and half water.  We'll see how it mellows in a few hours!  I may start  making this one a lot!  Loved the comment about freezing it in a cupcake pan, and the one about adding roasted red pepper.  I forsee  taste tests!

We made this tonight and liked the base recipe, we did make a few adjustments for our tastes. We added cumin for a little extra zing, and used the aqua faba to thin it a bit. Added a little garlic powder as well, and we loved it. Thanks for the base recipe.

I just made this & it is excellent. I only have a small blender so it was a bit more challenging to grind up the beans. I used 1 can of garbanzo beans & adjusted everything else accordingly. Fortunately I had all the ingredients on hand so no need to buy anything else. I would like to try it with some sun dried tomatoes some time.

Excellent recipe. I only altered the recipe in one way: I used cooked dried beans instead of canned. I saved some of the cooking water to thin the mixture and it's perfect! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This stuff is delicious! I halved the recipe as there are just two of us eating it, but wow....we used baby carrots and sweet red pepper for dippers. Thank you so much for this excellent recipe, it’s a keeper for sure. Fast and easy to make.

OK, kids. Tahini is just ground sesame seeds. You can make it in a coffee grinder or mortar & pestle. This is a good recipe because it lists all the essential ingredients for hummus, not necessarily because its ratios are perfect for everyone. My absolute favorite kind of hummus is one I invented and therefore can’t be found in stores: sweet & spicy chili basil! Add a couple tablespoons of garlic chili sauce (Asian market) and a handful or 2 of basil leaves (Thai is better but  Italian works in a pinch, but they MUST be fresh). Since there’s garlic in the chili sauce, I don’t add raw garlic to this kind of hummus. Instead, I use either roasted fresh garlic or a tablespoon of Better than Bullion Roasted Garlic Base. And I like half lemon half lime juice and a few drops of lemon extract, but that’s personal preference. Also, if your lemons aren’t ripe... don’t blame the recipe.

A couple issues for me: I made this first with canned beans and today with dry beans that I de-skinned; the latter is by far a better, smoother texture with a fresher taste, so if you have time, try it if you eat a lot of hummus. The recipe seemed a bit bland as written the first time I followed it, so the second time, I added 1 T EVOO and 1 T smoked paprika while blending, then topped with pine nuts and another sprinkle of the paprika. The additions livened the flavor, so that's preference.

If you don't like the gritty texture, here's a modification for super smooth hummus:  boil the canned beans for 20 minutes in water and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Rinse and drain the beans.  

Pay attention to the ingredients list.  I almost put in 2 CANS of beans.  It calls for 2 cups.  Measure them, one can equaled 1 1/2 cups, but another brand had a lot less beans in the can.
 
Put all the ingredients except the beans in first, blend them, then add the warm beans after you have rinsed off the baking soda water and drained them.

Alway remove the skin from the beans before putting it in the processor.  Yes it makes mincemeat of the skin, but the skin has a off taste.  In the Middle East the skin is always removed from the bean but they don’t normally use a food processor either. 
Otherwise the recipe is great. I always add Zatar and pine nuts on top

Agree this is a great foundational recipe. I started from dried chickpeas just because I had them on hand—and an Instant Pot, so 22 minutes under high pressure and then 20 minutes natural release. After cooling I used 2 3/4 cups of the chickpeas, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 cup lemon juice. I added 1/3 cup tahini because I like it more than most. I added 14 t

The recipe as written is pretty bland, but it's a good base. I cooked my own chickpeas so I knew exactly how they were prepared. After trying the recipe as written, I doubled the salt, lemon juice, and garlic and added 1tsp of toasted sesame oil and blended all together. I would use this recipe as a go-to starter, but it definitely needs some adjustments to give it flavor.

This is a very good hummus!  It tastes better than anything that I have bought in the store and super easy.  I made my own tahini by putting roasted sesame seeds in the food processor and slowly adding olive oil.  I will make this again.  Thank you for the base recipe.

Maybe a little bit olive oil need to be added, only tahini makes the mixture too heavy to process ... but the taste is OK.

I've been into hummus lately and I made this on a whim. It's so delicious! I can't quite pinpoint why, maybe it's the fresh lemon juice. I don't know if I will be buying hummus in the store anymore. My only suggestion is to keep the juice from the chickpeas to make the hummus more of it's traditional consistency, instead of a paste which is what I ended up with.

It was pretty great. I made it exactly like the recipe and received rave reviews from friends. However, next time I will adjust proportions to fit my small food processor. Two cups garbanzo beans is about a can (15 oz) and a half which pushed my appliance to the max. I'll adjust the recipe a bit to work for just a single 15 oz can of garbanzo beans.

Mr. Yum Yum will never buy hummus from the store again!  This was absolutely divine.  The ingredients blend into the most superb flavor and texture.  Next time, I might try adding some pesto and pine nuts, or sun-dried tomatoes.  This is a great base, and most excellent on it's own.  Mr. Yum Yum gives this 5 mashallas!

I made this tonight for my daughter. I thought I followed the recipe exactly, until I realized I used fresh cilantro, instead of parsley.  I have never tried hummus before and am not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but she really likes it, and can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors meld.

So easy...I always have  Pure Sesame  Oil on hand--I used this, but only used 2 Tablespoons--no overpowering of this taste at all.  I also didn't use the full 1/4 cup of lemon juice (really only about 2 1/2 Tablespoons.  I figured that if I needed more, then I could add it in--to take the place of salt (I have to watch my sodium intake).  In my opinion, it didn't need more than that.  I like roasted red pepper hummus, so I added about 3/4 cup of that to this recipe.  I'll definitely make this again!

Really good.  Added some roasted red bell peppers at the end & just pulsed until still in chunks, but well distributed.  Very good indeed.

Oh so yummy with a few tweaks.
Used 1 large raw garlic cloves and not 2 (2 tasted WAY to garlicy). Others suggest adding 3-4 roasted cloves - mellows it when roasted. (Will try that next time)
1/2 tsp Himalayan pink salt. I used canned chickpeas. If I made them myself I may have to adjust the salt again.
1/2 tsp ground red pepper. Next time will try with 1 tsp.
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1/2 cup chickpea water from the tin. Add as needed.
Once done and on plate: drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with paprika, add a few chickpeas and olives on top.

Next time:
Instead of chickpea water to thin, use yogurt to make it creamier.
Add 1/4-1/2 cup roasted red peppers

In my haste, I added the paprika and olive oil to the food processor and pureed everything together.  It was still fabulous!  I just drizzled a little more EVOO and sprinkled more paprika on top.  Also added a little kalamata olive tapenade  for variety.  This hummus is a great base for many variations.

Excellent base recipe and you can modify as needed with other add in ingredients. One can of chickpeas yield to oabout 1 1/2 cups so Adjust the tahini down a little. I blended the garlic (I used 4 cloves) tahini lemon juice and paprika then poured over chickpeas and mashed manually as I like my hummus chunkier.

I added 1/2 tsp cumin and used 3/4 tsp granulated garlic instead of fresh minced.  I also added 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1/2 tsp of splenda cuz wow that much lemon juice gave it some pucker power!!!  Turned out delicious though!!

I have made this a few times and love it every time, it is a great healthier snack.  The first few times I used my blender as I do not have a food processor but this last time I just mashed it with a potato masher and I am going make it that way from now on because I really like the chunky texture of it, it does take a wee bit of work but I think that it is worth it.

Really tasty. Make sure to save the liquid from the garbanzo beans. You'll want to use it to thin out the hummus if it's too thick once you blend everything together. Also, if you love garlic, throw in an extra clove or too.

I will definitely will make this recipe again.  I did not have tahini, so we substituted the same quantity of sesame seeds  for the tahini.  Other than that we did not make any changes.  Delicious.

I will definitely make this again but with a few minor changes. I will save the can liquid & thin the hummus a little. Since I didn't save it this time I used water which worked fine. I will also cut back on the tahini. If I were to make this for just me & not my kids I would add another garlic clove & sprinkle in some red pepper flakes. But it was pretty great as is.

I followed this recipe as a basic guide, but as suggested in some of the comments adjusted the lemon juice and other ingredients, and added some of the liquid from the canned beans to make the consistency come out right. I also added some cumin, but not enough I think; next time I'll add more. All in all a pretty good starter recipe.

This is a really solid recipe for hummus! I have made it several times now and find that it suits my palate best with an extra clove of garlic and about double the lemon.

Great recipe. Although I started out using other's advice on using smaller amounts of tahini, lemon juice etc, I ended up using the amounts in the recipe and it turned out well. I did think it was a bit too salty and will cut back on the salt next time. I did actually peel the chick peas and it makes a world of difference...and peeling took no time at all.

This was a solid hummus can’t say anything bad about it but it did not have the flavor of other people’s homemade hummus so  not sure if I made a mistake or I simply need to learn to tweak for my taste.

Awesome.  best tasting I've made
I doubled the recipe, and I didn't use canned.
I found it a little dry, so I slowly added water.  
Delish.  this is a keeper

Love this recipe. Made it twice already. Stuck to the recipe except I made my own tahini (toasted sesame seeds in oven then processed them with olive oil), and doubled the garlic. The olive oil at the end is key since it will make it creamy.  I will try fresh squeezed lemon juice next time instead of bottled. This is a keeper!

I made this with tahini paste made with roasted sesame seeds. It gave the hummus a strong, bitter peanut butter taste. If this is not what you want, I would suggest reading the tahini paste ingredients to be sure the seeds aren't roasted! Maybe this is common sense to some, but I didn't realize there were different methods for tahini paste that would affect the entire flavor. Five stars because I'm sure it would have been fine if I knew to make sure the sesame seeds weren't roasted.

I like to make recipes exactly as written and then write a review. Considering hummus is pretty basic, it's not fair to tweak it and then judge based on the amended recipe. I made this exactly as written with close measurements and there is WAY too much salt and lemon juice. It was awful. I had to add several more cups of beans to calm that down and while I got a ton of good hummus in the end, this recipe as it is will turn out terrible. Start with much less juice and salt and taste before adding. You'll also need to start smaller with the tahini and I would recommend some olive oil in it while blending. Use a food processor as well. There ya go!

The first time I made the recipe I didn't have tahini, and didn't want to spend the money on a jar just yet, so I used sesame seeds, which still gave it a bit of a crunch after processing.  I liked it just fine.  Made it with tahini the second time, and I'm finding it a just little bland compared to the first time.  Can be dressed up with any number of toppings--olives or roasted red peppers, for example.

This is amazing. *Highly* recommend removing the garbanzo skins prior by cooking briefly in baking soda and rinsing vigorously in cold water (lots of info online on how to do this). As others have suggested start with less ingredients/spices and add more to taste as you continue to blend. I like a mix of cumin, lemon, paprika, cayenne, red pepper, garlic and salt. So good it's hard to stop eating...

awesome hummus- you have to do the measurements pretty carefully - very easy to make it too lemony or too tahiniish or too garlicky - easy to make using dry means and instapot. Also better a day or two after first made the flavor seems to mature a bit.

i made this after cooking dried garbanzos in my Instant Pot.  I cooked up way more beans than I needed, so now have a bag in the freezer for another  batch.  As one review said, this is a very good basic recipe.  I have a Ninja blender and put the lemon juice, garlic, oil and tahini in first, blending until the garlic was well pureed into the mix, then added my home cooked beans one cup at a time until blended.  I added the paprika and parsley to the blend, but still have plenty to garnish.   After tasting the initial blend as per recipe, it was really good!  But I wanted a little different flavor and added some ground cumin.  It's tasty and will be a nice complement to the pita chips and crudites I want to serve for a "it's too hot to cook" meal of Gazpacho.

I know it's not fair to rate a recipe with your own changes so I give this 5 stars as is and here are my additions:  added about 1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, about 1/3 cup of roasted red peppers, a pinch of both cayenne and cilantro.  I add 1 or 2 green onions.  I also use less lemon juice, maybe 1 - 2 teaspoons.  I use way more garlic, maybe 8 - 10 cloves, and I stream in about 1/4 cup of evoo  while it's in the processor.  Thank you so much for the original post, it was a great place to start, I just read a lot of reviews and other recipes and tweaked it a bit. I never cared much for hummus, but I love this one, as have everyone who has tried it!
PS  For a tasty change of pace, try using black beans instead of garbanzos - DELISH!

I made this as written, but added some special toppings of chopped sun dried tomatoes packed in oil and additional EVOO drizzled on.  Served with cherry tomatoes, cucumber and pita chips. for dipping.  The main course was a Chicken Tikka Masala from this site.  Check out my reviews for that one.

This is a good starting point recipe but the addition of some bean liquid was required to gain the consistency I like. I added a touch of cumin and red pepper flakes, also lowered the tahini to my taste.

This was my first attempt at making hummus. The most difficult part was finding the tahini. I only used one can of beans. The recipe produced enough hummus for three of us to share. I noticed that it was getting a bit thick so I added some olive oil while it was blending. I think next time I will add some of the liquid from the can as well.  I received two thumbs up from the family! I guess we won't be buying store bought anymore!

This was good. It is a little to lemony on its own, but I made it with the 'hummus casserole' recipe from this site and it helped to cut that lemony taste. Thanks!

Taste was very good. As other reviewers suggested, use less of the ingredients like garlic and tahini and add to taste. Same with the salt for sure. I like the creamy texture of some of the hummus I have had at various restaurant and added plain fat free Greek yogurt to the food processor to achieve the creaminess. It really improved the recipe !

overall a good basic recipe for hummus. I used one more garlic clove and saved the chick pea liquid for thinning out. I find that necessary in all hummus recipes. Next time i will only use half the amount of tahini per that amount of chick peas..as i found it over powering.

Delicious!  Exotic! Better than any store bought hummus.  Made it per recipe but followed tip of adding reserved bean liquid to thin to desired consistency and added salt at the end to taste.  This will be my go-to hummus recipe.

I agree with the review by "The Head" who mentioned some key changes.  Follow their advice and use this as a great starting place to make homemade hummus. I added two large pieces of roasted red pepper (from a jar) and it turned out fantastics. Slowly added the chickpea "juice" until it was the consistency I liked. *Did not use all of it, so heed to that step of draining-->reserving-->adding little by little.  I also thought that 4 cloves of garlic was too strong for this smaller amount produced.  Finally, using our food processor left it too grainy, and switching to the blender got a smooth consistency like we have at restaurants/store bought.

Very authentic!  The only thing I did differently was add a little water and Olive oil to the chick pea mixture to soften the texture a bit more. It was delicious!

Used homemade tahini, so the tahini overpowered other flavors.  But it is a simple basic recipe. Perhaps lower tahini and add a little more garlic (probably needed fresher garlic cloves too).

Jury is still out on this one. I just made this. Didn't have tahini so used a substitute of sesame seeds/olive oil combination ground into a paste. Maybe that's the reason but, I have found this to be a bit salty. I'd cut the salt in half. Also, I had to add a lot more oil to make it "dip-able". Maybe once the flavors meld it will taste better. It WAS very easy to make. I'll give it a more accurate rating tomorrow when I taste it again.

I use one cup of raw garbanzo beans. Soak them overnight in 4 cups of water. Drain the water, add 4 cups of fresh water then boil/simmer for an hour. Fresh beans give this hummus a very fresh taste. I use 1/2 cup tahini, 1/3 cup of lemon juice, twice the garlic and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Then a teaspoon of parsley flakes, a couple pinches of cayenne and kosher salt to taste. This is so good it doesn't last long.

The is the best basic recipe I've come across. I followed it without changing like I usually do, and it was darn near perfect, from the garlic to the lesser olive oil. Very good.

Good basic recipe, easy to tweak. This reviewer added more garlic and mixed in dill weed, about 2 tsp worth I think, did it to taste.  I am leaving off the paprika parsley when I serve it, too.

I decide to make hummus since this is my boyfriend's favorite dip for chips and it is somewhat expensive to buy in store every week. Agree with The Head that this is a good basic recipe to start with. I add in the olive oil when I blend all the ingredients instead of drizzle it before serving, that makes the hummus smoother. Also I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to my boyfriend's liking. Though the video recommend the fresh squeeze lemon juice, I use the store bottle lemon juice and it seems fine. Totally recommend this for hummus lover!

When I made this it came out a little thick for me. I added a little liquid from the can of beans. That helped add flavor and create the right consistency. Thanks!

I thought the taste was good, but it was very stiff and dry. Needs much more olive oil.

Excellent!!! I used minced roasted garlic (lots--I love it!) and a little more lemon juice. Also drizzled olive oil and a little water to thin it a bit. Next time will try other's suggestion to add liquid from beans instead.  Mixed the parsley with all ingredients. Fantastic!!!

This was nice, but I did find it a little dry when blending it so added the oil into the hummus along with some of the chickpea liquid. This makes a pretty good base to which you could add a lot of different flavours.

I read a few of the reviews (about 3), and got a sense that this was a pretty forgiving recipe.  I made a double batch, so I used four 15 oz cans of no salt added chick peas, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 Tbsp olive oil (in the hummus), 2 1/4 tsp of salt (this is approximate, and since I have a salt grinder, after measuring 2 tsp and tasting I just added a little bit more) 4 cloves of garlic and 2/3 C of tahini.  For additional flavor, I picked 2 sprigs of fresh oregano and 4 sprigs of fresh thyme from my herb garden, finely chopped them and added those and a dash of cayenne pepper (maybe 1/4 tsp) for a little kick.  I saved and used the "chick pea water" to think out the hummus, as we like it creamy.  I added a little of the water at a time, maybe between 1/4 and 1/2 C total while the food processor was grinding everything.  I think it turned out very well, and my family loved it!

Fantastic basic hummus recipe.  The taste almost exactly matches what we get at a local, very authentic Mediterranean restaurant.  Even my incredibly picky 12 year old son loves this, and I tried three or four recipes prior.  Takes me less than 10 minutes to make this and is great with warm pita bread, pita chips, pea pods, carrots, or off a spoon.

My kids love it.  Keep in mind that a typical 16 oz can of Garbonzos doesn't have 2 cups of beans.  I adjust for 12 servings.  My older kids like it when I add roasted red peppers.

I made changes suggested in top-rated review. I increased the garlic to 4 cloves, added cumin, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. I didn't add any salt, as my chick peas seemed to contain enough salt. My guests raved about it!

This is wonderful, ancient food, that is pretty tough to screw-up.

I make it from dried beans that I cook in a pressure cooker (setting 2), for about 45 minutes (once pressure is attained).

This is a solid recipe that anyone can follow to success!

Great recipe! I followed the proportions in the recipe except for the tahini and garlic. I put less than one-third cup of tahini and increased the garlic to four pods. I lightly sautéed the crushed garlic before adding. I also added some cumin powder and red chili powder. I used fresh garbanzo beans instead of canned. That makes a huge difference. I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  My first time making Hummus. I put all ingredients in my small food processor and it struggled blending/whipping/crushing the canned chick peas (I used Progresso).  
I realized the mixture was too think so added a few tablespoons of the canned juice. Not thin enough, so added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of Olive oils.  The consistency was improving but taste was a little bland, so I added another garlic clove, a shake of sirracha, a shake of cayenne pepper (ground) a couple of shakes (1/4 tsp) of kosher salt.
Then refrigerated overnight for the flavors to blend.
Today I got the stamp of approval from all my friends when I served it with a selection of raw carrots, celery sticks, and corn chips.
I will make it again but ensure add extra lemon juice and spices.

This was my first time making this recipe and I agree with previous reviews; it's a good idea to hold back a little on the tahini, lemon, and salt in the beginning. These ingredients can be adjusted/added to taste once the initial mixture is blended. The tahini I used seems to be on the strong side. I will cut back next time. I will also cut back on the lemon juice. I love garlic and also wanted to help offset the tahini and lemon flavors, so I at least doubled the garlic and used large cloves.. Overall, this makes a satisfying hummus. I look forward to trying it again.

Made this for a healthy snack option.  I used only a 1/8 cup of lemon juice and added a little water to make a creamier texture.  It was delicious.

Good recipe. I added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp onion powder, dash of garlic salt, dash of salt,  a dash of lemon juice. I omited the tblsp of olive oil and just drizzled a little and added 1/4 cup water  to make it creamier. This made it just right for me! I do like salt... :)

I made this years ago and loved it. This time around I tasted the tahini a bit more, so I added more garlic and lime juice. Amazing recipe.

It tastes great!  This is my first time ever making hummus.  It ended up super thick, like peanut butter.  I'm not sure how to thin it out without adding a ton of oil.  I have a Blendtec and a Magic Bullet and neither one can blend it smooth, so it's quite chunky and thick.  But it's so good that I'm eating it with a spoon anyway.

I love this recipe. Of course, like most of the other reviewers, I tinkered a bit with it. I use 1 can (14.5oz) of Goya chick peas, juice from 1 whole lemon, I add about 1/2 tsp of cumin and I reserve the liquid from the beans to add as necessary. I'm not a big fan of tahini, so I use 1-2 tsp. I also use 2 large cloves of garlic.  I'm not at all a fan of store bought hummus, but this will be a staple in my house going forward.

It wasn't bad. I ended up making this with fresh garbanzos but that was the only change (it was a bit more chunky) . I do think that 2 tsp of salt was too much and ended up having to use water to dilute it. I think 1 tsp is more than enough. If you're not sure about how much salt to add, mix everything but the salt and add to your liking as you blend. I'll try to make it with the canned garbanzos next time to see the difference.

This recipe is great! My whole family loves it!  We made very few changes. We halved the amount of salt and lemon juice.  It took us one and a half cans of beans to make 2 cups. We added the juice as needed while blending to get the right consistency. Oh, and we used 4 small-medium sized garlic cloves.  We used 3 Tbsp. Tahini and it was perfect.  Adding this to our recipe box.

I used the advice mentioned and added all ingredients a little at a time. I did add some cumin and 1 roasted and peeled Serrano chile. It added a nice bite. I used limes instead of lemons because that is what I had. It turned out great and was a big hit!

I have used this recipe several times.  After reading several reviews, I add 1/2 t cumin and the juice of half a large lemon, I also add 1 t cayenne. I use only reserve the juice of one can.  I use an entire roasted garlic.

Easy recipe to double. Reserved some of the brine from the beans and added about 1/4 cup to the mixture to create a smoother consistency.  Even my picky kids loved it!  This is now a go-to dip!

This recipe is stellar. I'm a novice chef in the kitchen  and let me tell you this recipe impresses the masses. Make the following adjustments for 1can of beans an even better taste: roast around 5-6 cloves of garlic, add 1lemon and a small wedge of another one, 4-6 green chillis. I never used parsley and I don't intend to because it is just perfection this way. Hope you will give it a try.

The taste was sufficiently lemony, but the mixture was too thick to my taste. I would try to add more liquid, perhaps incorporate some oil rather than just drizzle it on top.

Very yummy.  This was my first try at making hummus.  I did not add as much tahini (which I made myself, too), figuring I could add more after tasting.  I stuck with just a couple of large teaspoons.  I added cumin, fresh basil and a small jar of marinated artichokes.  Next time, I'll try lime juice instead of lemon, just for a slight change.

This is a nice, basic way to start making humus. I make is a lot with my 4 year old. It's quick, a good base, and you can easily add more to this base. I make my own beans, which I feel makes it taste even better. Roasted garlic is also a nice touch.

This contains way too much tahini. I added an extra can of garbanzo beans, and that helped, but I had to seek out a different recipe for hummus so that my family would enjoy it.

Easy recipe with reliable results. I halved the recipe then once it was made, I split it into two batches and added a roasted red capsicum to one half and blended that in. Both were very yummy. I also added just a tad more lemon juice and it all went down a treat. Definitely keep the liquid from the can of chickpeas, you'll need it!

It didn't quite meet my expectations; was too tangy.  I think I'll leave this to the restaurants.

I've eaten way more than my fair share of hummus over the years.  I developed a taste for it while spending time in Israel.  This recipe is a good base for a wonderful dish.  To really create the authentic Middle Eastern flavor though add a handful of chopped fresh parsley and a 1/4 cup of olive oil to the blender when you mix this up.  It's then served spread out on a plate with a drizzle of olive oil and a little more fresh chopped parsley over the top.  Warm pita bread is always on the side to scoop up the heavenly bliss.

Great basic recipe! This works well as a base from which you can add other ingredients to create your own special hummus to suit your tastes.

This looks like a great, easy recipe.  I was wondering about hummus with tamari (light soy sauce).  Do you think Worcestershire sauce would work also?  I'm thinking of making it and wonder if anyone tried it.

The texture seems a bit dry. Next time I'll try to add some oil to it, hopefully it will make it more moist and not as thick.

Better late than never!
   I had never even tasted hummus before so I thought it was time to give this a shot and the thing I like most about this site are the reviews where you get intelligent feedback from other readers to help you tweak a recipe. 
  I knew I would prefer roasted garlic over fresh and after a preliminary tasting, I added some crushed red pepper flakes.  My beta hummus came out delicious. This will be my new default snack for a least a couple months. Next time I will add a smidgen of cumin and a modest sprinkling of roasted red pepper. 
  When I grill some fish or chicken I will add roasted pine nuts to my hummus and serve it in place of rice or potatoes. 
  Thanks for this great new addition to my culinary repertoire!

Very easy to make and tasty.  I followed other reviewers advice and added half of the chickpea juice to the mixture and cut down on the amount of Tahina.  Next time I'm going to try adding roasted red pepper.

I've been living in the Middle East for four years now, and I know what I like. I added more olive oil and lemon juice and it was still a little pasty. This is how they serve it at one Lebanese restaurant. Dip the tines of a fork in olive oil then Sweet Paprika. This is a good basic recipe.

This was very good and the perfect consistency. I would only improve it by adding a few hot red finger peppers (the pickled variety from the souk) from the start when I put it in the processor! Enjoyed heartily by guests!

Excellent recipe...my first attempt at making hummus. Followed other suggestions, and added cumin, paprika, cayenne, and olive oil, and some of the juice from the beans into the hummus while blending, in order to get the taste and consistency I was looking for. All additional spices were added to taste, so no measurements were given here. Thanks for sharing!!!!!

This is wonderful! I have been making it at least 3 times a week and just can't get enough! I could just sit down and eat the bowl with a spoon. Oh, and the gal at the health food store told me that it's good for me since it's PH balanced.....heh, always good to love something healthy! And I do use all organics.....

I just made this recipe and had a difficult time finding the tahini, so I found a recipe to make my own and was so easy and quick.  Whipped up this batch of hummus using my home made tahini and was delicious!  Would just add more garlic next time.  So simple!

First time making hummus and it was oh-so-easy! Flavorful, great basic recipe. Agree with others that this is a great base but you will probably need to tweak to suit personal taste. I added in a bit more garlic, red pepper flakes and a sliver of smoked pimiento. This is a keeper!

Make this regularly. Don't try it with dried garbanzos, though--texture becomes too rough. Using the canned liquid from only one of the cans actually helps. Like to add about 2T cumin to it, though. Also, instead of the expensive tahini from the store, we use about 1/4 cup of sesame seeds. Toast 'em if you like; makes for a nuttier flavour. Roasted red peppers also go well with this. We buzz it with a stick blender.  All in all, a great recipe and customizable to your spice preference. Most Middle Eastern families tweak their own hummus recipes, anyway. But this is a great starter recipe to see what you personally like.

This was simple and delicious-the best hummus we've made in a while! It was a bit dense, especially after being in the refrigerator, but that's nothing some olive oil can't cure ;)

SO delicious! This tastes so similar to a brand of hummus that we had been purchasing (and WAY overpaying for!) that my sons kept asking me "did you really MAKE this?!?"  I will never go back to store bought again.  Thanks!

I took this to someones house and everyone ate it like crazy and loved it.  The tahini, which I didn't use in previous recipes, really made it taste good.  I also decreased the tahini and lemon juice by half.  It was great.

Very easy and simple to make. Just follow the recipe! You can add your own ingredients to give it a special flair:  roasted red pepper, pesto, garlic, etc.  Some photos don't do this recipe justice. Make sure you save some of the canned juice to thin it out as you are blending.

This recipe is great, a little dry though.  Reserve some of the garbanzo bean water to loosen up the mixture.

This was good. Better than the store version. I roasted my garlic and added a little onion. Mine was really thick so I added just a little water to get it smooth. My non-veg husband really liked it.

This one is going into my recipe book! I only gave it 4 stars though, because there was just too much tahini for our taste. We double the recipe for our family of 7, and keep the tahini at a third cup. (This also allows me to make 4 double-batches from one jar of tahini.) I also add a little water when it's too thick. I am never buying hummus again!

this is a good basic recipe, but 1 teaspoon salt is WAY too much!

I would put only 1/8 teaspoon and also I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, as was advised.

Very good, but it seems to lack something compared to other hummus I've tasted.  After reading other reviews I think I'll add roasted red pepper and see if that's the missing ingredient.

I tried hummus for the first time only about 3 years ago; but crave it a lot ever since. This is my first time making homemade and this recipe was so quick and easy and deeeliscious. I agree with some of the reviews, you could add many different flavors to make this your own..... Yummy, I give it 5 stars +

Just made this and I love it! It tastes just like any hummus that i buy at the store. The only things that I did different were add another clove of garlic, and I used dried garbanzo beans that I had soaked and cooked. I blended the hummus together while the beans were still warm, and it came out so creamy and delicious! :)

This was ok, kinda bland.  I've had better, but I've never made it before so maybe I did something wrong.  I ate a little bit of it but then it kinda sat in the fridge and no one was interested.  I'll have to keep looking.

So easy to make, and so good. I don't really like the taste of tahini so I omit that, and it still turns out great. So cheap and easy to make. I will never buy hummus at the store again.

It was alright - it was great layered in my greek dip, but on its own it was just ok.  I will probably try something else next time.

The flavor is amazing!  Mine was really thick so I added olive oil while blending to thin it out a little bit.  Next time I will try yogurt as another person recommended.  I also added one jalapeno because everything can use a jalapeno!  Delicious!  Thank you!

So I read the reviews and got some tips- added cumin and red pepper- mixed the olive oil in instead of pouring on top- reserved some chickpea liquid and added it in to keep it from getting too dry- I also used 2 TBSP of creamy peanut butter instead of the tahini, because I'm cheap, and it turned out rather good-the kids chowed on it!

It's a good base recipe, but I like it garlicky, so I used 6 large cloves instead of 2. I also found myself adding more liquid as it was too thick for my mini cuisinart to handle at first. My advice is to start out with the recipe as written, then taste and add what you need as far as taste and texture go a little at a time. That's what I did, and 3 coworkers asked me for the recipe after trying it.

This was great!  I did use 2 - 16oz cans of chickpeas and about 1/2 cup tahini.  In addition I roasted about 4 cloves of garlic and added to the two raw cloves.  Yummy!

I tweaked the way most suggested....less tahini, more garlic, added canned roasted red peppers and it was amazing! Served with pita chips and it was a hit! It does make quite a bit, so if you aren't having a party or don't want to eat just hummus for a week take the suggestion of freezing in muffin cups for thawing later.

Used fresh chickpeas instead of canned, a bit more garlic, and slightly less tahini, and 1/4 c of bean water from the cooked chickpeas.  YUM.

Great recipe.  Added a little chili powder because I thought it needed a little more spice.  Served it on some lightly toasted Orowheat whole wheat sandwich thins- grabbed those by accident instead of pita.  But cool find- they are great for lite sandwiches too.

Super tasty! I followed the other reviews and used two 15.5 oz cans of chick peas, i started with 2T of the Tahini. i also saved the liquid in the cans of chick peas and needed to use almost half of it. with three cloves of garlic, it came out perfectly!

A really nice basic hummus recipe! I've made it several times in the past few weeks; sometimes it is a bit bland, though that could just be the difference between the size/potency of the garlic from time to time. If I'm going through the trouble of making my own hummus, I like to prepare the garbanzos myself as well! It's pretty easy and will cut down on any sodium/preservatives! I just rehydrate overnight and then cook a few hours in the slow cooker. Simple, healthy, and yummy!

Delicious!  Used 2 cans (not 2 cups) of chickpeas (drained and rinsed to cut down on the sodium), 1/3 c. tahini, 1/4 c. bottled lemon juice, almost 2 tsp salt, a few dashes of ground red pepper, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tbl olive oil, and 1 1/2 tbl roasted minced garlic.  Blended it all together in my food processor and added ~3/4 c. water to thin it out a bit.  Sprinkled the top generously with paprika for serving.  Not as creamy as what you'd get in the store (think my chickpeas were a bit crunchy...might be worth boiling them for a few minutes to soften them up, as suggested by another reviewer), but very tasty nonetheless!

Great recipe.  Get a really nice consistency when you place all but last three ingredients into food processor, pulse a few times, then slowly add 2tbsp olive oil and 1 or 2tsp Tabasco while processing.  No need to drizzle olive oil over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent! Didn't have any paprika on hand, so we just added a few (Only a few) dashes of hot sauce and the hummus was sooooo yummy! We plan using this recipe for all future pita and hummus appetizers.

It was my first time making hummus. I gave it 4 stars because I really think that it needs more garlic. Now I like garlic so I added 5 huge cloves also I had to add a bit of water and I added a bit of cumin and some cayenne pepper. Also I did not put in as much tahini as called for. As well I peeled all the chickpeas for a smother dip. It's a good recipe to start from and add your own twist.

Delicious hummus recipe!  The ONLY change I made was to add in some of the liquid for the can of chickpeas back to the food processor in order to give the hummus the right consistency.  My processor wasn't doing a great job with the hummus until I added the liquid back in -- so rather than add water I used the reserved liquid.  It disappeared quickly at our playoff gae party yesterday.  Great recipe!!

Made this for my boyfriend since he loves hummus.  I cut back on the lemon juice a bit and he still thought it was waaaay too lemony (I thought it tasted good but I've never had hummus before).  I made the recipe again...minus the lemon... mixed it in with the previous batch and he loved it.  Think I will add only a dash of lemon juice next time.  Thanks.

This is very delicious! My husband who normally doesn't like Hummus liked it too. I left out the olive oil and took some of the suggestions below on putting less tahini and more garlic. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I used two cans of garbanzo beans (with a little of the juice), about half a cup of fresh lemon juice, 1/3 cup of tahini, a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, a little salt, and cumin and crushed red pepper to taste.  Delicious!

this has a really good hummus taste that I am familiar with.  Instead of paprika and parsely, I topped mine with fried chickpeas and red pepper flakes.  I also left out the salt - didn't miss it at all!

'The Head' gave some really good advice. This was so yummy! I upped the garlic to 3 biggies, added 1 T to the mix, only used about 1/4 t. salt, and about 4 T tahini. So good.

this is really good!  i modified the recipe to use with one can of garbanzo beans rather than two cups.  one can equals about 1 1/2 cups of garbanzos.    i used 3 tbsp tahini and the juice of one lemon.  i also added 1/2 tsp of cumin as others suggested.  this was delish!

I am not sure what went wrong, but the overwhelming taste was bitter and of garlic (and I love garlic, but this was too much), and even in the middle of the night I woke up smelling of garlic. Maybe the problem was using raw garlic, or maybe my garlic was just off?

Very Yummy!!!!!  This is the best hummus I have ever eaten.  It is a very good combination.  I made it as stated and it would definitely be good to add different ingredients to it.  I did add the cumin to it as other reviewers suggested.  It really is delicious and easy to make.

Very good Hummus Base Recipe, I added more Garlic (5) Cloves like others suggested and used the juice from the beans to thin out Hummus. Also added a little Cayenne Pepper to give it some kick.

Great hummus recipe!  Insteas of using canned beans, I used 1/2 a pound of dried beans.  Just soak them in 3.75 cups of water overnight in the fridge, rinse, and simmer for 1.5 hours with 3.75 cups of water.  I used the juice from the beans to thin out the hummus to my liking.  I processed mine in a food processor instead of a blender - I think that's easier.

I read the reviews and did as they stated: only adding 4TBL of Tahini and 2TBL of Lemon, which worked better to my tastes. Added a 1/2 tsp of cumin and I also kept the drained water to add back to the mix to give it a consistency I liked.  However, it was entirely too salty.  I suggest decreasing the salt by 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.  Great starter recipe though.  All the others on the website didn't have the ingredients (or the reviews) this one did.

I followed the recipe, and I found it very difficult to make in the blender.  The mixture was so thick that only the bottom of the pitcher would blend.  I had to stop every five seconds and stir the big pieces down to the blades.  I think a food processor may be better, but I don't have one to try and find out.  The end product was too thick.  I see many reviews recommending adding water from the beans or more olive oil to thin out the hummus, and that is probably a very good idea.  I will definitely do that next time.  The flavor was okay.  Not as good as Trader Joe's, but good enough at a quarter the price for me to keep trying with variations.  I will add more liquid, and some peppers.

This is a pretty good recipe for hummus.  When I make mine, I add cumin, the juice from a whole lemon, and I add about 4-6 tablespoons of olive oil.  The olive oil gives the hummus a very nice consistency and flavor.  It helps the consistency if you add the olive oil while the mixture is blending in the blender.  I'll sometimes add a little cayenne pepper.  I'll usually chop up the garlic to make sure that it will get fully incorporated into the hummus.  I've made hummus on my own quite a few times now and I've found reserving the juice from the beans helps the flavor and consistency as well.  I never buy hummus from the store anymore, this is so much cheaper and better tasting.

This hummus was devoured! I did make minor changes - added a few more garlic cloves(we're garlic fans), and did end up adding a few tablespoons of the chickpea juice to get proper consistency. I also added red pepper flakes in the mix and processed it all in my food processor. Topped it with sesame seeds and paprika for color, it was soooooo good!

My husband loves hummus and used to buy the canned hummus where all you add is the lemon juice and spices.  I had tried before to do hummus using dried chickpeas but it was not what I was expecting.  I tried this recipe and both my husband and I love it!!!  It was super easy but most of all super delicious. This will definitely be added to our top recipes. I used 2 cans of chickpeas and only used 3 Tbsp of Tahini, I also added some cumin.

This was good and easy recipe.  I don't care for raw garlic so I roasted it in a few tablespoons of olive oil that I poured into the blender with the rest of the ingredients.  I had to add in quite a bit of reserved chickpea liquid from the can so my blender could process this.  I added in cumin just because I love that in my hummus.  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect as written. Try it with toasted-sesame tahini. It's phenomenal! I've also added roasted red peppers when the fancy struck me. The proportions are just right!

I agree with the other reviews that this is a basic recipe.and the taste will be different for every one as it depends on the quality of ur tahini. sometimes I add water if it came out thick. I like to add cumin and it is perfect with roasted red pepper, and I`m going to try it with roasted garlic .

A great recipe to get started with. I tamper with amounts of all the ingredients listed, and it's always great. The only other thing I add is a bit of cumin. I think it goes nicely with the other ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe!

I picked the recipe but my husband actually did the execution.  We added more garlic than necessary - we also added cumin and some roasted red pepper.  Cayanne pepper too.  It was really good.  Scaled back the recipe becuase my can of beans only held 1 and 1/2 cups.  The flavor and consistenty was both excellent.

I love hummus and have tried many recipes, but this one is by far the best! I did reserve some liquid to add because I like mine creamier, other than that I stuck to the recipe. This is delicious and much better and less expensive than store brands. Thank you for sharing!

this recipe is phenomenal! I added a touch of water at the end because it was a bit thick. I've made it a ton of times. Everyone just raves about it!

I made the recipe as written. It was so thick my food processor was bogging down. I added more olive oil and some vegetable broth before I got anywhere near something that resembled store bought hummus. Maybe that's the point? Anyway, the flavor is good, but for me, the ingredient proportions seem off.

MMM, hummus! I got sick of buying those tiny tubs for large prices. Home made is where it's at! So far, I have only used dried garbanzo beans, which take forever to soak and cook. The first time, I didn't cook them long enough and the hummus turned out grainy and chunky, yuck. The second time was perfect! I added roasted garlic, and had a huge batch of home cooked hummus for about...$2-$3? With baby carrots and pita bread, it was a delicious and healthy snack. I am trying it next time with canned beans to determine if the easier way tastes just as good. Either way, this recipe is the keeper for me!

This is, hands down, the best hummus around. My husband and I make this recipe at least once a month. I use the full amount of tahini in it, and I think it tastes fabulous just as it is!

I roasted the garlic before putting it in the food processor, which gave it great flavor. My only complaint is that the hummus was a bit dry. Next time I will add more of the liquid from the Garbanzo beans can.

The tahini flavor was a bit too overwhelming for me.  Maybe it was the brand of tahini I used.  I still enjoyed it and would make it again, only using less tahini.

Yummy! We liked it better than some restaurants' hummus.  I used some of the bean juice to thin it, only 1 oz of lemon juice and added 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Careful with the garlic.  I usually add 1.5 tsp packaged minced garlic which works fine.  When I added 4 cloves, it was too strong.  Topped with olive oil, paprika and feta.  Served with store-bought pita chips.  It's a keeper for sure!

This is very good! We love garlic so I have a tendency to add a few more cloves. I also put a bit of cumin in. If it is a little too thick I add some of the bean juice to thin it out. I serve with fresh veggies and baked pita chips. Great base for hummus.

I added cumin, extra garlic and roasted red peppers, all to taste and put the olive oil right in the food processor while I was making it.  The cumin gave it a nice southwest or mexican flavor.  Really good with some corn chip scoops!

I also had to thin mine. You could almost not drain the beans and it would be fine. I like the recipe for a good base, but added horseradish and wasabi for a spicy flair.

This recipe is fantastic. I've easily made this hummus 25-30 times with constant variation. It's more authentic than the corporate  at the grocery and way healthier (if you so choose *wink*). I enjoy boosting the garlic and adding some crushed red pepper or habenero for a little heat. Add more oil when blending for more smoothness, but I really enjoy the thickness and texture of some whole Garbanzos in there.

I love hummus and can eat a little tub from the grocery store in one day if no one is watching me, but most of this went to waste.  I made it just as written and it was bland, I fiddled with it and fiddled with it and never found anything to make it better.  I doubled the amount of lemon juice and it was still toothpaste thick and bland.  The only part of it we did eat was with some roasted garlic bread I got from the grocery but once that was gone the rest sat in the fridge.  Very disapointing and I will keep looking, hopefully my next attempt will not turn out so bad, otherwise I will keep buying it from the store.

Wonderful recipe! I found that it was easier to mix this in a food processor for me. The flavors mix together amazingly- I've used it now for pitas with vegatables in it and just for dipping-- so far it's a winner everytime!!:)

The taste was a little  bland for me  I added MORE garlic, 1 tsp of cumin, and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes to add some zing. The original recipe didn't have the right texture(too dry) so I added another tablespoon of olive oil with couple tablespoons of water to smooth it out. It came out great!

FINALLY!  This is the hummus I have been searching for.  Only change I made (and I always do this to hummus) is to add about 1/3 cup of water.  It makes it mice and fluffy.  Try it!!

I made this recipe pretty much as it was.I did add  1 tsp of cumin like some had suggested and 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2(I like a lot of garlic).It was awesome!It is some of the best hummus I have had in a long time.This is definitely going to be something that we make frequently.

Few changes:   1. Followed advice of fellow reviewer on order of processing: First beans & seasonings, next lemon juice & bean water, finally tahini & oil. I added a bit more water at the end to make it perfectly smooth, and also added another garlic clove, but I love garlic! Also added 1/2 tsp cumin & bit of cayenne. This is a great starter recipe, I'm going to add cilantro & jalapeno to another batch, and pesto to another, sun dried tomatoes to another...the possibilities are endless!!

The recipe as listed is good.  However, I think the tahini is a little too prominent.  Next time I'll reduce the tahini by half and double the garlic since I really prefer a heavier garlic flavor.

Pretty good.  I added some cumin to mine and much more garlic (since hummus taste better with loads of garlic).

My family really liked this. Little bit to thick if you follow the recipe exactly. I added alittle bit more Olive oil but next time I will add water and see if that helps. I decided to make a greek themed dinner and it was a big hit. I made everything from recipes I found from here.

Added some water and olive oil to the food processor to get a good consistency...also added more garlic than called for.  Very good! :-)

This was very good. Like others have noted, I had to add a little bit of water to the mix just to get the Hummus to the right consistency. Without the water, it was way too thick. Very tasty, and tasted very authentic!

I didn't really think this hummus turned out like it was supposed to.  This is my first time making hummus and also buying tahini, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was very pasty and dry and didn't blend well.  The tahini was very peanut buttery as well.  It tasted alright, but I should have read the other reviews before making.  Maybe then I would have known more what to expect.  I will try it again though.  I just don't see how this recipe has such great ratings.

What a great recipe, and awesome reviewer comments as well. To the food processor, I added the amount of chick peas called for, 3 tbsp. of tahini, 3 tbsp. of lemon juice, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 tbsp oil, 1/4+ cup bean liquid (until hummus consistency), the salt and 1/4 tsp. cumin. I finished it as indicated. Makes loads and went quickly!

I'm so thankful for this recipe!  I make it all the time now.  My kids and husband love it!  One time I realized that I was out of lemon juice and ended up squeezing a grapefruit for some citrus type juice, it came out fine!

When I first made this recipe I thought it was too thick, but I've since learned to save the liquid from the can of chick peas to add in.  I also like to add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and double the garlic for a more spicy hummus.  Sometime I'll add roasted red peppers to make it sweeter.  This is the best tasting and most versatile hummus recipe I've found and it's the one I keep coming back to.

I liked this, too bad 2/3 of my kids did not. Guess its not really a kid thing. I added extra garlic and a little cayenne. Its okay. I've had better. Not sure if it was worth the $7 on tahini, but I'll find another use for it. Thanks for the post!!

This is one recipe that will be altered by most ONLY because we all have different tastes. It's a great starter Hummus - not spicy - great for kids. I used artificial lemon juice(1/2 the recommended amount) and it is goood. I modify it slightly every now & again to suit our mood. It's worth a 5 because it's a great one to work with or eat as is. Thanks!

Yum! And easily adaptable to taste buds. I used 1 15 oz can of organic garbanzo beans, partially drained, a little less lemon juice, I thought the tahini amount was perfect, more garlic (3-4 cloves) and a few roasted red peppers. I used less olive oil (just eyeballed it, 1 tbsp seemed like a lot).

I followed the recipe exactly and although it tasted good, the consistency wasn't perfect.  I made this for the Super Bowl and someone happened to bring store bought hummus - the store bought was a bit better.

Like many reviewers I tasted first and made a few changes.  I did not think it needed more lemon but I did use about 3 times as much garlic, but we really like garlic.  I added 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper (will try chipotle Tabasco next time) for some "zip".  I did not have tahini so I used about 1/4 tsp. of sesame oil and I thought it was fine.  Quick and easy, I will definitely make again!

Excellent hummus.  I waited tables at a Syrian restaurant when I was in uni, so I love hummus.  I used two cups chick peas, 3 heaping tablespoons tahini, and two cloves garlic.  I added the reserved juice from the chick peas back in the processor until I reached my desired consistency.  Love this stuff.

Recipe was very easy to make. I actually used a blender to mix this. And because of that I added a few more tablespoons of olive oil. But it was excellent. i added a bit more garlic to make it more flavorful also. Very easy hummus recipe

This was my first time making hummus, used less than 2 cups of chickpeas and less of all other ingredients except garlic. Pretty much used halved amounts of ingredients, but garlic was way too spicy for me.  I will continue to experiment with adding other spices, veggies, etc., but did use the liquid drained from can to smooth out the hummus.  Served with Stacy's baked multigrain pita chips. Healthy recipe.

I am picky about my hummus, but this recipe is awesome. I took another reviewers advice on the tahini and started small. I even left some sans tahini for a healthier snack- it was delicious.

I LOVE hummus so this was great to try.  I did not have Tahini (good luck finding it here) but did everything else and even my children love to eat this.  So yummy and so healthy, an absolute favorite.  Great with Norweigen Flat Bread.  And filling too!

Very good. Definitly have to say its a personal taste thing. I made it exactly as the recipe states (except no salt), but had one of those ultra powerful cloves of garlic and it was burning my mouth. So I ended up adding all the ingredients again except the garlic. Was much better.

This is an excellent hummus recipe!  I only had one 16 oz. can of garbanzo beans, so I scaled the recipe back to 12 servings.  I used the entire 16 oz. can of beans, 2 Tbsp. of tahini, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, 2 garlic cloves, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper.  I also added about 1/2 can of the bean liquid as it was processing.  I didn't have any ground cumin, but I will get some and try that next time.  I'd also like to try roasting the garlic and adding more of it.  In addition, I will probably cut the salt back to a 1/2 tsp.  I skipped the olive oil, paprika, and parsley, since I'm just taking the hummus to work for snacks and I don't need the extra calories and fat from the olive oil.  I never need to buy store bought hummus again, and I can't wait to try different add-ins!

This is a pretty darn good hummus recipe, very close to the best I've ever had. I don't measure any of the ingredients and usually add a clove or two more of garlic. In response to all the comments on a bitter flavor--I've found that this is BEST for consumption 4-6 days after date of making. It's much less bitter and allows the flavors to truly meld.

Great base recip! I added 4 cloves garlic total. Also thinned hummus with the garbonzo bean liquid as I mixed it. Add the paprika to the oil befor pouring over. Top with feta cheese and kalamata olives and serve with pita wedges. It's exactly like the appetizer at Zea Grill here in Dallas!

Good flavor but mine turned out a bit thicker than I would've liked - i may use more lemon juice and a touch of olive oil in the blender next time.  Very quick and easy - I usually have all of the ingredients on hand so it's nice to be able to whip up a quick hummus since its such a great snack!

This is the BEST tasting hummus I have ever made-It makes store bought seem inedible!  Make sure you use really good quality beans because I have found that makes a big difference in the taste, and if it seems a little thick I sometimes add some of the liquid from the can of beans.  Wonderful with pita bread or pita chips for a healthy high fiber snack-and it is so healthy for you that you can eat all you want and not feel guilty!

WOW! Used two lemons, and it was just over 1/4 cup. Used 2 cans and 1/3 cup tahini. 1/4 of a roasted red pepper and 1/2 tsp cumin. Put 8 servings into a muffin tin to freeze (great suggestion!!) and the other serving for myself and my daughters. Put some olive oil and fresh parsley on top, served with pita chips sprinkled with parm cheese and olive oil. YUMMO! Thank you for the wonderful post! I can have this without any work 8 more times!

I didn't really like this. Maybe it was my area. There's not a lot of tahini and fresh garbanzo beans around here. I might try this again with fresher ingredients just to see what all the hype is about. The tahini I got was the only one on the shelf and it had separated into a large rock in oil. I'll give it a better rating if it works out...
New that I have tried this again I thought it was WONDERFUL. I've updated my rating to show it. Be sure not to buy your tahini out of a dented can from a mega store and you should be good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at hummus. I cooked the garabanzos myself; doubled the garlic, and added some cumin and red pepper. Otherwise I followed it exactly and it is delicious. I will never pay the high price for store-bought hummus again.

This was easy and had a great consistency and wonderful taste.  The hardest part was finding tahini in my rural town.  I finally found a graocery store that carried it in the dressing/condiment/pickle aisle.

This recipe was tasty, but I will definitely add some red pepper or cumin next time for some more flavour.  

Can't find Tahini anywhere?  My family's secret is to add peanut butter instead.  Use the peanut butter that is just crushed peanuts, not the kind with sugar and additives added.  Don't use quite as much as you would if you were using real tahini though.

I liked it because it was strong in taste, but the rest of the family didn't like it - for the exact same reason.  That makes three against one, so I guess I'm weird.  But this hummus was way too thick (I added some of the juice from the chickpeas, to make it more liquid)... and also there's just too much lemon juice in it, I would settle for half or two thirds of what the recipe calls for in lemon juice.  Apart from that, well it tasted like hummus.  And in my opinion it was a good, STRONG hummus, so if that's what you're looking for, well you might just like this recipe.

This came out very well, but I gave it four stars for the same reason that most people put.  I reserved the bean "juice" and had to add about a cup of it to get it creamier.  It has thickened up quite a bit since being refrigerated.  Other than that it's great!

A great basic hummus recipe that's ready to be snazzed up with your favorite seasonings. We like our hummus spicy, so I added more garlic, cayenne pepper, red chili pepper flakes, cinnamon, & lots of cumin. We also add Garam Masala which really brings it together. I didn't measure, just a dash of each until the flavor was right. Like others, I found it too dry so added some extra liquid to thin it out, and mixed the oil right in. I also found that if you let it sit overnight in the fridge, the flavors meld and it ends up a bit stronger than when it was fresh.

Perfect basic hummus recipe. I often enhance it a bit with an add-in or two. The most popular so far: about 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh salsa. Added great kick and flavor. You'll need to add back less of the liquid drained from the beans if you do this.

Loved this recipe!  Next time I would use a tad less salt.  I took 1/2 the mad hummus and blended it with a small can of sliced black olives and made a black olive hummus.  Then I put the original hummus in a bowl and shaped it like the white side of the yin yan sign and then filled in the rest with the black olive spread. Added a dot of the black to the original and a dot of orginal to the black and had a real treat for my guests!

Very good!  I made a batch for a friend to bring to a dinner party and the host (who happens to be a coworker of mine) said he'd had hummus before and wasn't a big enthusiast of it, but that mine was "exceptional".  I did add a pinch of cayenne to it as well for a bit of a kick.  Also, for those of y'all who haven't had tahini before, and are curious as to what it's like all alone, don't take a bite - it's stickier than peanut butter so you'll be spending about 15 minutes trying to lick it off the roof of your mouth.  :)

Great recipe. I tweaked things just a tad to suit my tastes.  And mean 'tweaked'...added a splash more lemon juice and some pepper.  It is paramount that you use tahini.  I can't tell you how many times I've tried to make Hummus without it, and tonight made it with the Tahini.  It makes the recipe.

I made this for a work party because the picture looked so great!  I, too, drizzled olive oil on top with paprika and fresh parsley.  Gorgeous!  Also added sundried tomatoes which I ended up fishing out of the hummus since they didn't blend in too well.  I served my hummus with fresh pita and carrots, kalamata olives, radishes, and feta cheese.  delish with feta, I might add..

i love hummus and i was tired of buying the little tubs.  this recipe was easy enough to follow and came out great!  i agree with those who said the this recipe is "tahini heavy" i had noooooo idea how bitter it is! (and it smells so yummy).  i found that adding more garlic,less lemon juice and a can of minced black olive makes it just right. next time i will try roasted red peppers instead of olives(the garlic is non negotiable, i love garlic so very much, i'd brush my teeth with roasted garlic if it didn't defeat the purpose) this recipe makes quite a bit so i'll be a hummus eatin' gurl for at least a week! a great appetizer for company also!

Just finished making this. This is the best hummus I have ever tried! I followed the recipe exactly as stated, no changes whatsoever. I'm eating it with crinkle cut carrots and an apple right now. But I will be serving this with a middle eastern themed dinner tonight.

This is a great and easy recipe.  It's a lot of garlic so cut back if you aren't a big garlic fan.  I added some of the liquid from the can of beans so that it came out more creamy.  It's easy to play around with this recipe and make it your own.

The recipe as is was not to my liking but if you follow the advice from other readers regarding the amount of lemon and tahini - it is very good.

Hmmm, maybe I did something wrong, but this was quite thick and lacked flavor.  I ended up adding more lemon juice, olive oil and some cumin.

Good recipe. I love garlic but this was overpowered with garlic. Next time I will save some of the Garbanzo bean juice to make the mixture less thick. I cut up some pita bread, spread a little olive oil on top, and put the bread in the oven until they were crispy…a nice way to have hummus.

Soooooooooooooo good. I put only 1/4 cup of the tahini and added some of the chickpea juice and about 1/2 tsp of olive oil.  Yummy.  I will never buy hummus from a store again!!

Love this one! It tastes a little funny right after it's prepared, but it's wonderful once it sits overnight in the fridge. The longer it sits, the better it tastes!

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. This is an excellent base recipe. Next time I make it I would add a bit more garlic and less lemon juice, but I'm a garlic lover. I also omitted the olive oil from the top...I like hummus just fine without it.

Overall very good.  I did decrease the tahini as suggested by several reviewers and used roasted garlic (4 cloves).  Next time I will add red pepper to give it a little more heat...but very authentic tasting as is.

Each time I have made this, I have had to add extra lemon juice. I also have used some of the liquid from the beans. However, the final product is very tasty! Love the garlic flavor! I am always asked for the recipe.

A good starter recipe - just play with the flavors to make it fit your tastes (i.e. I used more garlic and less tahini).

This was so thick!!! but i had thrown all the water from the can away, so.. next time i'll add some. I also had another problem (but that was my fault), i took other reviewer advice and roasted my garlic cloves, next time i'll use raw garlic better. i also added olive oil to the mixture, not just on top.

This hummus is sooo good!!  I did use some suggestions from other reviews.  I used about 1/2 cup of the juice from the beans to thin it and make it creamier, added some cumin and red pepper flakes, and used a little less tahini.  I didn't add the oil on top just to make it a little healthier.  I dipped cucumbers, carrots, and toasted pita triangles into it.  I can't believe how good it is and I will be making this often!!!

This is a good starter recipe but I would need to make additions if I make it again. Something is missing...I added about 4 cloves of garlic and cumin and paprika and that still didn't do the trick. I will try again with other ingredients so I can use up the tahini.

Good, fresh tasting hummus.  I added extra olive oil while blending to give it a smoother texture, otherwise it would have been quite thick.  All in all, I was quite pleased, and I'll probably make it again.

Like others, I cut back the tahini, upped the garlic, and added red pepper flake. I also used "bean juice" and some yogurt to smooth it out. Served with pita, couscous and schwarma.  Very pleased and we plan on sharing with friends.  A great basic recipe.

I've become a hummus addict since finding this recipe.  I buy dried chick peas instead of canned and cook them up myself to cut back on salt, but that's just my preference.  Fantastic recipe and thanks!

i accidently put two 15 oz cans of garbanzo beans instead of two cups but it still turned out great. actally i think if i had only used two cups the hummus would have had too much garlic and salt. i added a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of water to add more liqued to all those beans and it was perfect.

This is a family favorite.  My 3 1/2 year old helps me make it 2 or 3 times a week.  I usually use 1 can of chickpeas (rinsed and drained).  It's not a full 2 cups, but pretty close and I like the way the texture turns out.  I also usually blend in some (or all) of the olive oil if I know that we won't eat all of it immediately.  Thanks for the recipe!

A good basic hummus.  Next time I want to try adding some dill or spicy peppers to give it some kick.

This was very good, but was a little on the dry side for me. I added some more lemon juice (about 1 Tbls.) and kept adding the reserved juice from the garbanzo beans I set aside to get it to the right consistency. I added extra garlic too!

This is pretty good hummus! I was forced to make many changes, as I was short on ingredients, but lime juice in place of lemon juice adds a nice twist. Thanks! I enjoyed it!

I've never made hummus before, but this was delicious! I'm on the South Beach Diet, so this is a great snack, with some celery to dip. I doubled the garlic. Next time I will add less tahini. Thank you for this recipe! I love the consitency as well!

this was a bit salty, but will still give it a 5 star.  I will definitely make this again, but cut the salt down to probably 1/2 tsp.  I also thought 1/4 cup of lemon juice seemed too much, so I cut it down to just 2 tbs.

Great flavor!!! I would make this recipe again with a couple minor changes. (Hummus seemed a little dry. I increased the lemon juice a bit. I might add a dab of sour cream next time so it softens up some)

This was good. I used 1 can of beans which is a little less than 2C, so cut back on the other ingredients a bit and cut the Tahini almost in half. Added a little plain yogurt too.

I actually didn't think this hummus was as great as all the reviews. I was a little disappointed. It was quite bland. In the future I will add some more spices.

Enjoyed the recipe as the recipe stated, but might try some of the suggestions for the next time. It didn't seem too thick, altough I'm not a skilled hummus maker. great recipe for last minute company as it is so easy and tasty.

I cooked my own beans (we can't get canned beans here), upped the garlic and cut the tahini almost in half, as per other reviews.  This was great hummus!  And it was even better the next day.  It could be a base for other add-ins, but is great as it is.

This is a great recipes, however most cans of garbanzo beans come with just under two cups of beans. Therefore you probably want to roll back on the other ingredients just a bit.

Also, the suggestion about reserving the bean liquid to thin out the hummus is a great one. If you do not thin it out, it will be very thick and chunky.

I've made this a few times and love it a lot. Adding half a roasted red pepper and a bit extra garlic made a very nice twist. As will roasted egg plant!

This is pretty good.  I've never made hummus before; this took only a few minutes to whip up.  I cut the amount of tahini in half and doubled the garlic.  I cut back on the salt; garbonzo beans are packed in a salty liquid anyway, so unless you rinse them or buy the low-salt variety, you shouldn't need to add much.  I left off the olive oil.  My can of beans equaled slightly less than two cups, but I didn't want to open another can just for a few beans.  I didn't need to add any extra liquid while mixing.  This is very good with Trader Joe's pita chips.  I'm enjoying this recipe, but I think I will look for a more spiced-up recipe in the future.

I used seasame oil for a more authentic flavor. It was way too thick and i had to add more oil and water but the flavor is awesome. I won't be buying it from the store again. I'm already thinking of additives for this recipe

This was good, but not our favorite ever hummus.  It came out a little more thick than it should have been, next time I would thin it with a little extra liquid from the beans.

This was very good. I highly suggest peeling the peas and reserving the juice for later to thin it out a little. Also I almost trippled the garlic, but thats because I like to taste it. I actually had some hummus at a wedding, but it was traditional style and made by a Serbian chef...it was better than this, but you cant compare the two.

I didn't like this too much.  I think I may have added way too much garlic.  I love garlic but this was a kicker.  It was seeping through my pores!  May try again but not too sure.

Is hummus an acquired taste? I've never had it before, and I'm thinking it might be. I made this yesterday and it is growing on me.. definitely an interesting flavor, and great on crackers. I think the lemon flavor is a little overpowering, otherwise it is pretty tasty!

I used the basic ingredients in this recipe, but didn't measure everything out and it still turned out great.  I added much less lemon juice than the recipe called for, but I added the juice from one can plus quite a bit of water to get the right consistency.  I also added some cumin.  I'm taking it to a poker party tonight so I'm hoping it's a hit with everyone.

Very nice. So simple and so tasty. I will use a bit less salt next time.

I have been on the hunt for a wonderful, standard hummus recipe--I have tried making it numerous times before and was never fully satisfied with the result. I made this recipe following the directions exactly and it was wonderful! This is definitely my new staple.

This is great! I followed the suggestion of not completely draining the garbonzo beans, and was happy with the moisture level and consistency. I made this recipe then two days later went to my hometown of Dearborn, MI where there is a large middle-eastern population.  Comparing this to what I received in the restaurant, I'd say they were nearly the same.  The restuarant's was a bit saltier.

Good base recipe.  It tasted too lemony the first day, but then was perfect.  I added a can of asparagus and red pepper flakes for a "gourmet" flavor.  Yummy!

A good recipe, however, next time I make it, I will add some water or olive oil to the food processor - as written, it seemed a bit thick.

This is a very simple to prepare recipe, but definitely use a food processor over a blender for faster preparation.  As per the suggestions of others, I also added the parsely right into the mix an added less oil.  Stores well refrigerated and makes a GREAT tasting healthy snack!  Love it!

This is really good, easy, excellent texture and flavour.  My only reccomendation is that it be made ahead of time as it takes a while for the garlic flavour to really set in.  I also added a hint of cayenne to give it a little kick.  This is a great recipe.

I'll cut down on the lemon next time because it was a little too lemony for us.  Other than that it was fantastic and addictive!  Yummy!

Great recipe! It was a big hit even with the kids when I did it for my son's B'day party. The only thing I did differently was retain a little liquid,and add 1/2 a tsp of cumin pwd. Will surely do it in the future and recomend it to all hummus lovers!

Really delicious but a bit dry.  Don't completely drain the beans so you can add some liquid to the hummus.  Will make again!

Excellent! Classic hummus. The only change I made was to add more garlic. I also included some of the bean juice, since I was using a blender and not a food processor.

VERY good, if difficult to make.  Blending the chickpeas/garbanzo beans was difficult, since peas seem to dry out as soon as you try breaking them down.  The end result was phenomenally good, though - what I started making as a snack turned into a meal.

Pretty good.  Wish I had a food processor instead of a blender because I just couldn't get that creamy texture I love.  I added some olive oil to try and make up for it, and I only used about half the amount of lemon juice and that was perfect tartness.

This hummus is delicious!! To me, it tastes just like the stuff you buy at the health food store. I love the garlicky flavor! And best of all, my kids think it's great! They love it spread on a freshly baked warm whole wheat tortilla (Just don't tell them it's healthy!).

Personally, I found there to be too much tahini, and it was also a little dry. Next time I make this I will follow some of the tips from other reviewers and reduce the tahini and add some water. Thanks.

Great recipe! There was a bit too much garlic, perhaps because the garlic cloves I used were rather large. Next time I'll be sure to choose smaller garlic cloves to use, but otherwise it was great!

Excellent recipe.  I remember my dad making hummus when I was a child, way before it became trendy and I never thought I'd find a recipe that could match his, well this one is so close it's almost perfect.  The only thing I do differently when I want to fatten up the recipe a bit is pour pinenuts sauteed in butter (quite a bit of butter) over the top of hummus instead of the olive oil.  But for a wonderful healthy treat, the original recipe is superb.

This is very good but I would have one suggestion: Leave out the salt. I put in only half of what is suggested here and we still found it too salty. The garlic is seasoning enough.

good hummus.. .pretty basic... I added extra tahini because it was too dry w/ only 1/3 of cup
Also, I would recommend not draining all the liquid from the cans.

I make this up for camping events with the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) where we have a lot of Middle Eastern activities, I was told by someone from Jerusalem that this tastes just like a hummus they'd get in there!  I put TONS (probably 10-12 cloves) more garlic in it and I put in a tablespoon of basil.

I have to give this one a high rating on the basis that I make it once every 2-4 weeks! I do tweek it, though. I like garlic, so I add 2-3 extra cloves. I also add cumin, dill weed, and cayenne pepper to taste (about a 1/2 teaspoon of each, less on the pepper). Do reserve some of the liquid from the garbanzo beans to thin the mixture, though.

I saved the liquid drained from the beans and used it to thin out the hummus a little.  Delicious flavor.  Easy to make.

Awesome recipe! The first time I made it I followed directions exactly except I added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. chili powder. I found this hummus to have a great taste but a bit thick for me. So, the next time I made it I reserved the juice from 1 can of beans and added it slowly until I like the consistency. This was great! I drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with paprika once it's on my plate.

My hubby and I enjoyed this recipe, we love garlic so we added a bit more. We omitted the paprika and parsley.  I make this all the time and it is a very easy recipe to do at the last minute. YUMMY!

I didn't get to taste this.  I made it for my daughter to take to school when she presented her report on a middle eastern country.  Those 4th graders polished off every spec!  She served it with pita chips, also from allrecipes.  I'm making it again this weekend -- for adults this time.

Wonderful, easy, fast!! I'll never BUY hummus again. I find it a bit too much with raw garlic, though, so I'll try it with roasted garlic next time.

AMAAAAAZINGGGG!!! I got the same recipe from my jordanian friend and it has a little less tahini, and really comes out wonderful!!!! The best hummus anywhere.  My personal tip, the texture comes out smoother if u boil the beans in its water and a little extra for about 15-20 min.

I've never made or eaten hummus before but my husband has and said this was delicious. (He was very flattered that I had made it just for him. I didn't tell him how simple it was!) I added Cumin and hot sauce. The second day I chopped up a few Kalamata olives and sprinkled them over the top of the dip. YUM! Yes, put the olive oil in the hummus. I can see where this will be a very nice change from the usual cheese and salami snacks. We toasted low carb herb and garlic tortilla triangles and used that for chips. I have a Vita-Mix blender that worked wonderfully. The hummus was so smooth. certainly save the liquid from the can to thin the hummus. I made this a second time and added 3 slices jalapino pepper (jar). The spicy taste was wonderful! I gave the recipe to a friend who took it to her Yoga class and everyone loved it! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!  One of the best hummus recipes we've ever tried!  It's the only one we use now.  The only modification we made was with the salt.  The original recipe was a bit too salty for us, but after cutting the salt in half, it was wonderful.  Rather than using a blender, we use an Oscar/food processer because the consistency is so thick.

I thought the consistency was OK, but not like hummus you get in the grocery store.  Maybe if the tahini was cut back a bit it would be better.

I've been making this recipe for several months now.  It is very good.  The only thing I do differently, is add 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 cup tofu as I mix it in the food processor.  The tofu makes it very smooth without losing any flavor.
