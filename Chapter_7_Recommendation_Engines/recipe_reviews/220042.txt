Just made this dinner tonight for a 4, 3 and 1 year old... and nothing was left on the plate.  To make this even more simple, after cutting the chicken I put all the chicken pieces in a large bowl and dumped the honey mustard in to coat all at once.  Once coated, I dumped the stuffing in and coated that all at once.  I separated onto a cookie sheet like instructed and everything came out perfect!  Great for a 20 min quick, easy, delicious meal.

These were the hit of the party.  I'm going to use this recipe for chicken breast and make a dinner out of it.  Yum!

Marinate the chicken in the dressing and it'll be more flavorful.  I've made it twice, the first time with stuffing, the second with Panko, and I prefer the Panko.  A kid-friendly, easy weeknight meal... I may try it using ranch dressing at some point.

As a previous commenter suggested, I used panco instead of breadcrumbs. I am not an experienced cook but this came out perfectly; 15 min was just the right amount of time for juicy, fully cooked chicken. I used lemon pepper panco which gave a nice little kick to this recipe.

These tasted wonderful! I gave one less star because I did not crush the stuffing up so it didn't coat well but otherwise it's a good idea. The sauce is delish, don't be afraid of the odd combination of ingredients!

I've made this twice now, and how good it comes out truly depends on what brand of Honey Mustard you use.  First time I used Emeril's - was pretty good.  Second time I used O'Charleys, and it was MUCH better.  Its actually pretty easy to make Honey Mustard if you have the ingredients on hand, and I'm sure this would be the best route.  However I have to say that neither occasion could I taste the OJ very much in the dip.  Next time I may add another TBSP to make it a little more citrus-y. Overall, the family enjoyed it both times.

This indeed was an easy recipe to follow.  I didn't taste the honey mustard on the chicken unless I used the dip.  I think if I do make this again, I will use Panko breadcrumbs.  The stuffing/breadcrumbs where just to light a texture for my personal taste.  Seems like an incredibly healthy recipe though.

Very tasty. So easy to make and it had nice flavor.  I used butter crackers that I crumbled and did not make dipping sauce. It would have been good with sauce but we didn't mind not having it cuz flavor was so good.   Lisa

I loved this recipe! So easy and delicious!  My only complaint is that I marinated my chicken in the dressing for over an hour and still couldn't taste the dressing which I made from scratch.  I will marinade longer next time.

Have made this 3 times now, two of the 3 completely making my own honey mustard. I personally love it better that way. I've made it as bites, as strips, and it really does taste as good as it sounds! Even to a honey-mustard hater like myself!!

WOW! I never thought making chicken nuggets could be so fun, or that they would taste so delicious! I've made these numerous times since finding the recipe, my 2 teenage boys love them, as do I!
