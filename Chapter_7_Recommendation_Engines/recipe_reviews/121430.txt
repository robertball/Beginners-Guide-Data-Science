I cut this recipe back to 16 servings. I made two small changes. I used vegetable oil instead of butter and four ounces white chocolate chips instead of white baking chocolate only because that was all I had on hand. I made muffins out of this recipe, I was able to get 12 smallish muffins out of one batch. I baked them for exactly 20 minutes. The combination of ingredients is very nice--I loved the banana with the rum, white chocolate, coconut and pecans. I would definitely make this again but I would increase the rum extract to a full teaspoon and the coconut and pecans to 3/4 of a cup, but really, that's only because we like more "stuff" in our muffins. Five stars for flavor.

Yummy!  I LOVE coconut, so this was a great recipe for me. The only changes I made were I used coconut extract because I didn't have rum extract & I used white chocolate chips instead of chopping a block of chocolate.  This recipe made five small loaves, enough to share with the neighbors. I just had a warm piece & it was wonderful!

It was very good but a little sweet.  I cut the sugar down by about 1/4 cup give or take and upped the banana a bit (no point not using that extra 1/2 banana!).  Hubby thought it was just right but the addition of white chocolate pushed it over the edge for me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to eat it and enjoy it, but next time I'll either leave out the choc or replace it with bitter sweet

Very good bread (although i let it cook too long it was still very good!). 

I was looking for something that would add a different taste to a banana bread and this is a recipe that is good. If you don't like banana bread alone. Try this recipe out.

Gorgeous bread, can't believe it has so few reviews.  The loaf was light and moist, I really enjoyed the coconut and white chocolate.  Just that little bit more different than traditional Banana Bread.

Wow is this so good!  I made 8 mini loaves and gave them as a "lil something extra" gifts for Mother's Day. Delicious, moist and very flavorful...the only thing that I changed was to use coconut extract in place of the rum extract. This is a great banana bread recipe...will most definately be making again. Thanks!

Delish. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. And used regular chocolate (unsweetened squares). And creme de cacao, since i didnt have rum. SO GOOD. thanks.

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband loved it.  I added almonds to mine.  It was so moist and very easy to make.

I made this last night because I had bananas turning black, and it took almost all five of them for this recipe.  I had all the other ingredients on hand except white baking chocolate (in hindsight I should have bought the white chocolate chips to speed the preparation process rather than trying to chop the squares).  It's FANTASTIC.  My boyfriend keeps referring to it as "banana cake" because of its rich flavor, and everyone at the office is loving it today.  Still has a strong banana flavor (the coconut adds more texture than flavor) and I can't really taste the white chocolate personally.  Easy to put together though, and makes two good-sized loaves.  I'll keep this one!

I've made this several times and it is an all time favorite. I made it again tonight at the request of co-workers who asked if I could bring it to the office again.

I thought I was finished my Christmas baking, but this recipe caught my eye. And I'm glad it did!! This bread is AMAAAAAAAAAZING!!!!!!! I subbed 1/2c. brown sugar for part of the white sugar and 3/4c. whole wheat with AP flour. Upped the amounts of coconut and white chocolate to 1-1/2 c. each and increased the banana to about 3/4c. more. Got 5 mini loaves and had to freeze four of them so I wouldn't be tempted. Can't wait to share this one with my friends and family - thanks!!!!
