This was excellent.  I have been making pork and sauerkraut in one form or another for most of my life but this by far has been the best.  It will definitely be made time and again.  I used 3-27 oz. cans of sauerkraut which I did not rinse or drain (I like mine tangy) and that was perfect for my crockpot.  As for the person who gave this a bad rating because of Chinese New Year, last time I checked I lived in America and thus celebrated New Years the American way eating the dishes that I grew up on.  So please don't give a recipe a negative review because it doesn't fit in with your customs, just don't make it.

Thank you, we really enjoyed this! It had a great, rich flavor. Did add 1/2 cup of beer, onions and some brown sugar to suit our tastes, but this will be a definite repeat recipe. Pork came out very tender and the kielbasa was the best. The flavor of the meat and sauerkraut all just goes together so well. FYI for others, I used Claussen jarred sauerkraut and didn't drain or rinse it. But, you may want to drain and rinse the kraut if you're not a real sauerkraut fan.

I made this recipe because I was dying for some pork, sauerkraut, and mashed potatoes like we always have on New Year...even though it's coming up and presumably I could just make it then.  I used pork loin instead of roast because that's what we have at my house on New Year's and I got a decent deal at Sam's Club.  I drained the Sauerkraut but didn't rinse (had to run to work!)and added half a bottle of beer and some brown sugar.  I put it on high and the boyfriend got home 8 hours later it was burned  on the sides - I will definitely put it on low next time.  It was really good - the Kielbasa was a nice touch (I used turkey to cut down on the fat a tad)...and I ate it with apple sauce and mashed potatoes and just ate it all on the same fork.  New time I would add the whole bottle of beer, and maybe switch to corriander seeds (not sure about the thyme)...I defintely want to use the other half the package of pork loin and make this again.

What a coincidence...I made this last night!!  I add chopped apples, sliced onion and caraway seeds to the kraut and cook it all in a crock pot.  I serve with garlic smashed potatoes, green peas, and fresh apple pie.

In crock pot, I layered 1 1lb bag saurkraut + 1T caraway seeds + 3.5 boneless pork roast + 2 Granny Smiths, cored and thickly sliced + 1lb kielbasa cut into 2-3" pieces, put along each side of pork roast + 1 bag saurkraut + 1T caraway seeds.  Put it on low and let it go for 6 hours.  Simple!  Delish!  Mashed potatoes and black eyed peas = Happy and Healthy New Year, America!

WOW!  What a great way to prepare pork roast!!  I think it was the best pork roast I've ever eate.  My husband really loved it.  Said it reminded him of the way his mother used to fix pork roast 50 some years ago.  Will definitely make again.

My family is Pennsylvania Dutch and pork and sauerkraut is always served on New Year's Day for good luck.  This variation with the kielbasa was a tasty treat for us.  Thank you!

Sacrilege, but this is better than Grandmas....sorry Grandma.

The pork is impossibly tender, the kielbasa a great punctuator.

Now, I will say one of Grandmas alterations will be making it in next time...in the form of half sauerkraut, half fresh chopped cabbage. Like homemade yogurt using a regular yogurt to feed it bacteria or sourdough bread using a "starter", the commercial sauerkraut catalyzes fresh cabbage into something special - and far more delicious than "just" canned or bagged kraut....not to mention the textural differences of the larger cabbage pieces (I use a knife to cut 2" pyramid corners into the mix). 

Anyhow, this recipe earns it's five stars handily.

I really  like sauerkraut. Howerever, when I cook it nobody seems to like the sour taste or the aroma when it is cooking. So for anyone who feels the same as my family, I found out if you add a bay leaf or two(depending how much kraut you are cooking) to the kraut,it takes some of the sour taste and some of aroma away. Just remember to remove the bay leaf before serving.

This was really good. I made some adjustments and additions like others suggested and the whole family really enjoyed. I drained one 2lb bag of sauerkraut and than combined the drained and the un drained bag in the crock pot added about a teaspoon or so of caraway seeds and mixed together. Removed about half the sauerkraut to make room for the pork roast that I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder then seared off in cast iron pan with olive oil. Placed the roast in crock pot added back the rest of the sauerkraut along with Â¾ of a dark beer. Cooked for 6 hours and added a handful of baby carrots a small can of white potatoes and the kielbasa. Cooked for an additional 2 hours. Served with spicy brown mustard and a fresh loaf of rye bread.

Excellent recipe, but I think the cooking time is a little off for the Kielbasa.  You can add the kielbasa right at the end, maybe the last hour, just to heat through. There's no need to cook it the entire time if you get the precooked kind, and if you do it'll end up like mush.  I subed the roast for some pork chops just becase they don't need to cook as long and there were only 2 of us eating this. I seared them and then added them with the kielbasa near the end.  I also threw in a box of frozen perogies when there was about 30 mins left of cook time. Served the kielbasa and pork on sandwichs with sauerkraut and perogies on the side...YUM!

I made this today for our New Year's dinner. It says to cook it in a crockpot. However, mine won't fit  the roast and kielbasa. So I salt and peppered it on both sides and browned it on all sides in my Dutch oven and then removed it to a plate so I could brown the kielbasa. When I was finished I put a bed of sauerkraut on the bottom and added the pork roast and kielbasa. then top it with the rest of the sauerkraut and the and fresh thyme sprigs. I cooked it on 325 degree preheated oven for 3 hours. it turned out beautifully, moist and tender. I will never cook my roast any other way.If your slow cooker won't fit all of this don't worry use your Dutch oven you won't be sorry. Also I used a little bit of brown sugar to my sauerkraut.

This was awesome. I took suggestions from others and used brown sugar. I actually combined the brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon and put rubbed it into the pork. I also drained, but didn't rinse the sauerkraut. I used a bottle of beer instead. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe.

what a fantasic recipe!  I made this for New Year's Eve and ate the leftovers on New Year's Day for good luck.  I followed the recipe except that I also added a 1/2cup of Ginger ale and I also sprinkled caraway seeds on top of my sauerkraut.  I had a four lb roast, so I browned it for 10 min, then cooked it on low for an hour and then high for 6 hours.  It was still so juicy and tender the next day!  A definite keeper!

I followed the recipe, and added half a bottle of beer, as some others suggested. While the roast was indeed tender, we found the overall taste to be bland. The cooking method seemed to drain the kielbasa of taste too, and there was so much sauerkraut left over.

Perfect for a fall Sunday dinner. I rinsed and drained 4 can of kraut (2 regular, 2 sweet) added a large chopped onion and peeled chopped Gala apple, a few teasoons of caraway and 2 dark beer2. I left of the kielbasa until the last 2 hrs, and lightly browned it first.

My husband loved this dish, however, 6 hours on high is definitely too long.  I cooked it 6 hours on low, and the kielbasa was still just mush, as others here have reported. Remember, smoked sausage, kielbasa, etc. is already "fully cooked" anyway, especially the commercial packaged. Next time I will quickly sautÃ© kielbasa and add in the end of the cooking time.  I did add onion, diced granny smith apples and a little brown sugar.  We are a family of 4 and 4 lbs. of sauerkraut was just too much.  I just used 2 cans of sauerkraut.  I will make this again, but only cook maybe 4 hours on low.  Enjoy!!

Taste fabulous! However, next time I will reduce cooking to four hrs. on high or six on low.  It was difficult to cut, and shreaded.  Six hrs. was way too long.  I had a three lb roast, and would add more kielbasa and maybe less sauerkraut.  However, the beer was a plus.  Company loved it, and it is easy for a weeknight.

Very good.  Used a 5 lb pork roast, 4 lbs sauerkraut (2 bags), and one lb kielbasa.  I also added a bottle of beer and I'm glad I did ... it added much-needed liquidity and there was NO beer taste at the time of serving.  I might add even another bottle because the juice was to die for but there was not a whole lot of it.  My crock pot worked fine for about 2 hours and then stopped working for about an hour before I realized it, so I dumped it all in a large stock pot and simmered it all on the stove for a few hours.  Served w/homemade mashed potatoes and applesauce.  Really really good.  The kielbasa got pretty soft, so if I do it on the stove next time I'll add the kielbasa in halfway through the cooking time.

All you could taste was the sauerkraut. I like sauerkraut, but you couldn't taste anything but it, so it made it too over powering. The meat was dry. I didn't care for this at all :(

This dish is one of daughter's favorites.  Easy & tasty.  I did add some color with some purple cabbage kraut.  This can be done on the stove or a crock top either way your kitchen will smell wonderful.

don't get me wrong, it was good but not great.  made pork in slow cooker before but not with a boneless pork loin, so it was pretty dry because it was so lean.  also, the kielbasa took on a new texture after cooking for so long that you didn't want to eat it, I would cook and serve separately next time

Made this for New Years Day, since I live in PA and everyone I know was having Pork and Sauerkraut for dinner today, its supposed to bring good luck.  It turned out great, I followed the recipie pretty close, I had two pork loins, so I browned them in olive oil with salt, pepper and thyme.  I added a lil bit of brown sugar and some onions to the crock pot.  Turned out really good.  Will definately make again.  I am not a huge sauerkraut fan, but I actually like this.  Will make pork Ruebens with the left overs tomorrow.

This is the second time I made this for New Years. We love it. Make sure to use the juice from one of the sauerkraut containers and leave out the kielbasa until the last hour. Served with mashed potatoes.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used home-canned sauerkraut(which I should have rinsed, it was a little too salty),  and venison kielbasa with the pork loin.  I also added in some baby carrots and omitted the thyme.   I followed the directions to broil the pork loin before placing in the slow cookier and I'm glad I did.  My pork was moist and flavorful.  I will use this recipe again.

Put this in an oven bag instead and it won't dry out. I like to add pineapple with the brown sugar and beer.

Being from central Pennsylvania, I wanted to give this a try to see how it compared to what I'm used to having on New Years Day.  I browned the pork loin in a skillet rather than the oven (didn't feel like dragging out the roasting pan).  I used half the amount of sauerkraut called for (not a huge fan) and turkey kielbasa.  I couldn't taste the thyme and might just leave it out altogether.  The pork was very moist and tender, but the kielbasa was overcooked (would add maybe halfway through the cooking time).  I like to add a little brown sugar or a shredded apple to the sauerkraut to offset some of the tang.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was the best recipe I have tried yet. It was perfect. I always follow recipes exactly as written the first time and I wouldn't change a thing the next time. It was delicious. Reminded me of my mom's but just a little bit different.

A fantastic dish that we served a 2 weekends ago as one of the main courses for our son & daughter-in-law's wedding rehearsal dinner. Everyone raved about this dish; the pork was so moist and tender. We'll be holding on to this simple yet terrific recipe. Thanks!

My first inclination was to give this only 3 stars but after it sat overnight it did taste better the next day.  The only thing that really stood out about this was the Keilbasa, everythign else lacked flavor to me.

I made this with 4 center cut pork chops, beef kielbasa and homemade sauerkraut. It was delicious. Cooked on high for 3 hours and low 1 hour so if you're using pork chops instead of roast it might need less time so check sooner than 6 hours or consider cooking on low the entire time. I seasoned chops with ground thyme, black pepper and Lawry's seasoned salt, broiled both sides of chops and added about 1 Tbsp brown sugar (as other reviewers suggested) on top of final layer of sauerkraut.  Highly recommend for both the flavor and easy preparation. Thank you, Heather, for sharing this great recipe!

Simple ingredients, easy to put together and tender results.  I used an organic kraut without extra seasonings/salt so I added salt to mine, which it needed.  I also used smoked sausage instead of kielbasa. 
As some noted, the flavor was a little one-dimensional so I would treat this as a base recipe. Next time, I'll add apple juice/cider and caraway...and there will be a next time  :)
Also, if this turned out dry for you, either your crockpot doesn't have a tight lid, your kraut not enough juice or you're adding veggies that soak up liquid/salt.

I love sour kraut and kiebasa and tried this two years in a row for large gatherings. I tried many tricks recommended to give it pizazz and it again ended up dry and bland. Used the dry pork with some BBQ sauce a second day as guests preferred the spicy & sweet rub recipe found on this site. Pass this up for a crowd pleaser in fortunately. Everyone enjoyed huge sauer kraut and kiebasa though!

Our family makes this using pork ribs, caraway seeds, cut potatoes, some cut apple. I usually take some kraut and kielbasi out and put it on a thick bun, with yellow mustard. The rest goes on a plate. Maybe some apple juice if you don't like it so sour.

This was easy and good. Plenty of food for my family of 6 (with 2 tweens!). 2 of my kids won't eat saurekraut but ate the sausage and pork. It was so tender it fell apart! I served with mashed potatoes. Good!

This was really good.  Unfortunately, you cannot get Kielbasa in Scotland, and the smoked sausage is not even close.  Sigh.  But we still made this, and it was really, really good, even without proper sausage!

This recipe is FANTASTIC and so easy.  I swapped the Kielbasa with smoked bratwurst from Aldi - I followed the rest of the recipe exactly I let it cook all day - 10 hours in my slow cooker, I made some creamy mashed potatoes and fresh green beans!  This is one of my favorite meals ever!  I have been disappointed with my slow cooker meals and this one rocks!   My entire family loved it,  I highly recommend it!

Excellent!  I added some chopped onions and basil along with garlic and fresh ground peppercorns.  The whole family enjoyed this.. (even ones who hate kraut).. with garlic potatoes and sweet potatoes.. which my kids love.. and cornbread on the side.  This recipe will absolutely be made again!  Thanks...

AWESOME!  The pork was VERY moist and everyone loved this at my work and also at my wife's work. The kielbasa was pink inside but well cooked.

I added caraway seeds on top and a large potato cut in 1 in cubes with a little onion between the layers of sauerkraut.

For prepping the pork, I generously spread extra virgin olive oil over the top and sides of the roast. I used more than two sprigs of thyme . . . I actually did a light dusting of thyme. 

A very tasty and easy meal to prepare.  Thanks!

We fix this every New Year's Day.  My mother adds a bottle of cola so that the carbonation sends the flavors through the meat.  It is impossible to cook this too long.  I put everything in the slow cooker at 10pm the night before & then we eat it the following day for lunch.  The meat does not dry out if you use plenty of sauerkrauf & the soda.  Leftovers of this meal are so yummy.  Homeade dumplings cooking in the juices from the slow cooker make an awesome side.

UPDATED REVIEW, 1-5-09: Second time making this.  I still drained my kraut, only added one can beer (a pilsner), and this time I browned my kielbasa before adding to crock.  That kept it in tact.  So, there you have it!

FIRST TIME REVIEW, January 2008:

I drained my kraut and added 2 cans of beer.  I wish I had a dark beer to use instead.  The pork was so tender, no cutting necessary!  The kielbasa had split open at the end for me as well.  I wonder if browning it a bit before adding it would correct that?  We had this for dinner 2 nights later (hmmmm, someone ate all the kielbasa when I went to reheat it), and it was even better.  Honestly, however, pork and sauerkraut is pork and saurkraut, and that is the reason I gave just 3 stars.

I made this 1/1/08. I did some tweaking, 1/2 can lager, coating brown sugar, whole large sweet onion chopped, Macintosh apple quartered, drained and rinsed the kraut, I used one other reviewers suggestion about putting the kielbasi in later and that worked great, the house smelled GREAT, the pork roast was so tender you could cut it with the side of a silicone spatula and it just fell apart. overall, rave reviews and delicious!

The pork was so moist.  I rinsed and drained the kraut. Then added some caraway seeds, brown sugar and 1 1/2 Granny Smith apples to it.  For the kielbasa, I had to use garlic sausage, it was all I had.  I also had to use dried thyme on the pork.  This is the way I'll be making my pork for New Year's from now on.

I am not a huge fan of sauerkraut but I decided to be brave and make it since my husband likes sauerkraut and I was up for something new. I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! Holy  have I been missing out. The roast was tender, and the sauerkraut and kielbasa went fabulously with the pork. Thank you Heather for this wonderful recipe.

I accidentally made this with a 4 pound roast instead of a 2 pound:) I cooked it on high for maybe an hour longer and the family raved! It fell apart and had great flavor....good recipe.

Tasty but definetly for sauerkraut lovers. Because my kielbasa was precooked I followed the suggestions of others and left it out until the final hour. It was perfect.

The meat was so juicy and tender!  I cut the kraut down to 2 pounds cause there's only the 2 of us.  Didn't drain or rinse it.  Added a can of beer to all.  My husband said he'd never had kielbasa so tender before (and he's true Polish with a LOT of kielbasa in the past).  It made the house smell so good, too.  This will be our New Year's meal from now on for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!

Was this delicious! I seared the pork loin in a pan first, with a coarsely chopped onion. Then I assembled it in the slow cooker, using rinsed sauerkraut.My DH took one bite of the pork loin and yelped "WOW!!" Thank you so much, Heather

Yes, maybe this is a traditional New Year dish, but not this year. This is a pig's year, and there should not be pork products on the table.  Pig doesn't eat herself :)

This was great! We spent all weekend eating it. I followed recipe with the exception of adding about 3/4 cup of lager (Harp was what I had on hand) as recommended by other users. Not sure if it made any difference but I couldn't taste lager and I was nervous about there not being enough liquid. I cooked on high for 2 hours then on low the rest and the meat was nice and tender. Had no issues with kielbasa turning to mush, but where I come from we take our kielbasa seriously and it's available at all stores so maybe the quality makes a difference?? Not sure, but it held together nicely. I made sure to get one with no additives so perhaps that made the difference. Definitely will make this again. And as other users have said...if you don't like sauerkraut - do not make this!

Skipped first step, did not put under broiler to brown.
Scott & I used venison bratwurst instead of kielbasas.  It was delicious!

Made this twice now and it's great. I just moved to the heart of PA Dutch country and the locals I know here seem to really like it. The second time, I did add some brown sugar (no more than 1/4c) and 1 chopped apple. Is an awful lot of sauerkraut (I did cut it down by 1lb second time) but I use the leftover for topping on hotdogs. Yummy. Thanks for letting me know how easy this is. :)

Amazing. This will become my New Year's Day tradition as well. I made it exactly as it was written and my family loved it - even my 5 year old (although she did pick around the sauerkraut). My husband calls it a 5-star meal!

My family loves this recipe. The first time I made it I used half the kraut, & was ok. The next time I used all of the kraut & it was much better! The kielbasa just melts in your mouth. I cook this anytime I have 10 or more to cook for. I do now use 2 instead of 1 kielbasa, as there is never any leftovers of it so people can have more than one serving of it & I use the leftover roast for BBQ sandwiches later in the week.

I love pork and sauerkraut and this is awesome! Followed suggestions and used caraway seeds, brown sugar, apples, garlic powder, and onion. Yum!

6 hours is much too long to cook kielbasa!  I browned the pork on the stovetop.  Next time, I would saute garlic and onion to add to the kielbasa.  I would cook for a total of 4 hours adding the kielbasa the last hour.

Excellent recipe.  My husband is very picky about trying new recipes, but he LOVED this!  I added extra keilbasa, but followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out wonderful!

While it is the upcoming Year of the Pig, Chinese New Year doesn't begin until February, and ends next February.  According to the dates of the Chinese New Year, we're still in last year...which means it's fine to eat the piggie.  :-) Next year?  Whole different story, I think. LOL

I've made this recipe many a time, and it's terrific.  The kielbasa really gives it an extra kick.

This was amazing and easy. I made it for my pickiest friends and they loved it. To add a drop more flavor I added fresh onions. Do yourself a favor and buy high quality kielbasa. Served with fresh rolls, roasted garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. My husband was a little put off by the "tang" of the sauerkraut so next time I will drain and rinse the sauerkraut as suggested by another user.

I've been making variations of this recipe for the past 20+ years on New Year's Day. Latest option uses 1" thick boneless pork chops instead of roast, and has the following modifications. Cut 3 small apples with skins on into wedges and mix with 1 pound of drained rinsed sauerkraut. Put kraut/Apple mixture in crockpot. Then slice 1 medium onion, season with salt and pepper, sautÃ© in 1 tbsp olive oil until carmelized and distribute over kraut. Add 1 tbsp butter to pan used to sautÃ© onions, and brown pork chops (seasoned with salt, pepper and thyme) on both sides. Remove chops from pan and put on top of onions/ kraut, along with kielbasa that is cut into pieces. Top with 1 lb drained rinsed sauerkraut. Deglaze onion/pork chop pan with 1/2 bottle of stout beer and pour over kraut. Cook on high for 4.5 hours and serve with peroghis, green beans and baked apples. Yummy!

Very juicy. Very delicious. After my first time making it, I decided to start throwing a can of no-salt corn in there. Great stuff.

I thought this was ok... I followed the recipe exactly but the pork was dry and kind of bland. I wasn't really a fan of the thyme flavor either. Just a personal preference though. The best part was the kielbasa and sauerkraut.

The pork was dry,  the kielbasa was mushy and the sauerkraut was overpowering. The pork was so dry that it fell apart in the crock pot when I tried to pick it up.

I had never made nor eaten this before, but it appealed to me as I read the recipe so I gave it a try. Oh my goodness how delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the half bottle of Guinness I put in), and it was heaven on my tongue. My husband loved it, and my 3 young kids loved the meats (they didn't like the kraut, but what kid would?). The flavors and textures of kielbasa, pork loin and sour kraut just work so nicely together! I will be making this often!

This was a very tasty recipe! I added the beer, as suggested, but I also used a "Williams Sonoma Roasted Chicken Rub" instead of the other seasonings (as it was easier...). Tasted terrific! And was moist and tender.

This recipe is outstanding! So easy and delicious, and even better the next day. It's my boyfriend's favorite meal that I make for him. I wanted to tweak it a bit by adding onions, apples, and beer, but he said "please don't mess with greatness!" :)

Outstanding!  My one important caution is that 6 hours on high seems like it could be a bad idea.  I set my slow cooker to low before I left for work, and about 9 hours later my 2.5-lb pork roast was fall-apart perfect!!  I added couple of tbsp of brown sugar and a dash of caraway seeds to the sauerkraut.  Next time I look forward to trying some of the other suggestions on here, such as throwing in some beer or apple cider.

Similar version to what I grew up with except I had it with pork ribs,
and boiled potatoes. I make it all the time now. Awesome 
I will try it next with the pork roast...can't wait.

Read the reviews and was sure my polish husband would love it but was not a hit at our house- found the kielbasa changed consistency and became almost soggy.

I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut and there was a funky unfamiliar smell in my house when I arrived home for lunch,
at which point I got worried. But man, this is great!!! I did rinse and reduce the amount of sauerkraut. It's a keeper for me!

This recipe was so delicious! Pork was extremely tender. Since we were feeding a large crowd, I used 3 lbs of kielbasa, over 3 lb roast, and extra sauerkraut. It was popular on a cool October night!

Delicious! My roast turned out dry but I will just cook it less next time.  Should have followed the reviews.  But I didn't think the Kielbasa turned out too mushy...that was our fave part!  Really good recipe.  Oh...and I used half a bottle of beer as well.

Wow what a great meal.  It cooked a lot faster than expected but everything turned out great.  One thing I did was add a 1/2 a can of coke and one Fuji apple so that the sauerkraut was not too bitter. It made the meat moist and tender. I will definately make it again.

I made this for our New Year's Day dinner and the roast was great along with the sauerkraut.  After cooking the kielbasa according to the receipe directions, I have to agree with another post to not put the sausage in for the whole time because mine was very over done.  Other than it, I will definately make again.

Great Meal!!!! I also added onion and garlic, the pork was so tender and the sausage tasted great.. I have a very large family and they left no left overs.. Worried that I cooked on high for only 5 hours the meal was still a topper.  I too served with mashed potato and greens.. Apple pie sure tops it off....

Great taste.  I added caroway seeds, onion and beer - great flavor.  I also used Claussen Kraut and did not rinse it, but hey, we are true Kraut fans up here.  Easy and tasty.  Can't beat that!

I always add quartered, cored apples and brown sugar to my pork and sauerkraut.  I also do sausage, but do it seperately w/ cut up peppers and onions and add a sauce of brown sugar, catsup and soy sauce and bake.  YUM!!!!

Great recipe!  Will definitly make this again.  Although, I only used 3 lbs of Sauerkraut, because my slow cooker isn't that big.  But great eatin'!

Very juicy and tender, full of great flavor. I added 1 bottle brown ale & 1 1/2 T brown sugar. I think would be even better with some caraway seeds. I did not drain the sauerkraut but may next time as there was a lot of liquid when done cooking. I mixed the brown sugar into the sauerkraut. I used a boneless pork tenderloin that I rubbed with salt and pepper. Broiled 10 minutes before putting on top of kraut in crock pot. The kielbasa I cut into 3 inch long pieces and laid around and along side the pork loin. The beer I poured over all. The kielbasa did come out very very soft but I actually liked it that way. The pork came out so tender and juicy it fell apart. YUM!

This is a top shelf recipe. I have made this a total of five times now. First two times followed the recipe exactly. Did some slight tweaking from there. Are use one fresh head of cabbage diced. I fry six strips of bacon diced. Add 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. And then one premade bag of sauerkraut on top. Kind resembles a friendship bread recipe.

Super delicious and super easy. Tossed everything in the crockpot at eleven a.m. And had a tender and moist main dish by six p.m. I'll be making this again for sure.

Pork and Kraut are always good together. I would recommend adding the Kielbasa toward the end of cooking time. Adding it at the beginning as  recipe is written, resulted in odd textured sausage. Mushy to be exact.

This was absolutely perfect made as recipe stated EXCEPT omitting thyme because family doesn't like the herb. The Roast was sooooo tender and everything was so flavorful. Don't change a thing--it's PERFECTION! I made home made mashed potatoes and home made cranberry sauce to go with it. Everyone LOVED IT! Great recipe!

This recipe is excellent, either as it is or with some tiny additions if you want the other flavors.  I followed some of the review tips and added a little beer, brown sugar, and diced onions and apple that I stir-fried for a few minutes.  I also like the idea of adding the kielbasa later, since it had a crumbly texture after cooking so long.  I had never heard of such a dish or combination when I made it for the first time last New Year's, and I can't wait to make it again.  Thank you so much for the recipe, and for all the extremely helpful comments.  You all play a large part in why many of my friends love my cooking!

This may be the most delicious slow cooker recipe there is. Plus it's as easy as can be. I seared the pork roast on cast iron, then followed the recipe with the following notes. I used dried thyme, and it came out just fine. Definitely add a half a bottle of dark beer (I used Red Hook Winterhook, because 'tis the season).

5 stars!!! Don't add the sausage until an hour before the meal is done if you are using precooked sausage. It just looks better when served. This recipe was even tastier as left overs!!!

This was good, and I will likely make it again, but not  like "OMG 5 stars!"  Cooking the Kielbasa for 6 hours was overkill.  Next time I make this I will add it either half-way through or toward the end.  The overall flavor was good, but I feel it was still lacking a little sumpin' sumpin'.  Next time I will try adding beer, as other suggested, and some chopped up roasted Pueblo green chiles because, like bacon, they make everything better :)  The pork became a little dry the following night after reheating for leftovers so I heated up some chicken broth to pour over it and that seemed to do the trick.  Garlic mashed potatoes and peas went well as side dishes.

Delicious. My family has made this for years on New Year's Day, but never in the crockpot. It was fabulous and beautiful too. I did add a can of Budweiser thanks to someone else's tip and then served it over homemade mashed potatoes. It's a keeper.

The best sauerkraut we have had in a long time.  I made some  changes but would not have even tried without this recipe.  Used country ribs instead of loin roast, seasoned as directed and browned.  Also browned a large onion and deglazed the pan with 12oz dark beer.  Stirred in the apple and sauerkraut, nestled the ribs into the sauerkraut, covered and baked 2hrs.  I then added chunks of Yukon Gold potatoes and the sausage and baked until all was tender, about 1 hr.  We will enjoy this again soon.

I added a bunch of spices to my own taste and it was AWESOME. Hubs is the cook in this house, but has dislocated his knee. after 10-12 hours at work I just didn't have the energy to cook, so looked for some good recipes that I could pre-prep, freeze, and toss in the Dutch oven as needed. I cooked at 190 for 12 hours, and the pork fell apart. Everything was delicious and tender. Will definitely be doing this one again!

Had not had sauerkraut since I lived with my parents (25yrs ago). Glad I decided to make it!  After reading other reviews, I am glad I drained and rinsed the sauerkraut before adding it to crock pot.  Would have been VERY pungent.  Halved and thinly shaved one onion and added.  I also added the kielbasa cut in 2 inch chunks for just the last hour of cooking.  It would have been complete mush if I had cooked for 6 hours.  Made a lot.  Had the leftovers over hot dogs.

My family gave extensive complements on this dish.  We used 1/2 the sauerkraut, and cooked it on high for 6 hours and low for a 7th hour.  We had to extend the time a bit to keep it warm until dinner time. The pork and kielbasa came out incredibly juicy and tender.  What a delicious meal!

Very Good and certainly hit the spot.  The pork roasts were too big for just me and loins too expensive so I went with 3 thick cut pork loin chops and put them one on top of the other in the center.  Also cooked everything on the stove in a dutch oven over very low heat for 4 hours.  Worked out well.

I used a 4# roast for my family of 5. Cooked it on high 4-5 hours. During the last 3 hours, I cut up potatoes and layered them on top of the pork. My family loved this recipe. Asked if it could be a weekly dish

this is a good dish ,we use to do in the oven and have mash potatoes with it.
   Had heard germans always rinse the sauerkraut because it is a brine. so i rinse it briefly to capture some of but not all of the sour taste.
and i added baby red potatoes on top in the crock pot. yummy .

Really just fair. Pork loin turned out kind of dry. The meat simmered in too much juice in the crockpot even though I drained the sauerkraut. Next time I'll use 1 can of kraut instead of 2. Turkey kielbasa rather mushy. It all tasted better the second day though.

Very good, but my family did not care for how soft the kielbasa turned out.  I will cook it separately or shorter next time.  Also, 6 hours on high in my slow cooker was too long.  My two pound roast reached temperature by 4 1/2 hours.

This was soooo good and easy. Eliminated the tyme(do not like) and sauted the onions in bacon and then added the kraut.
Will make again and again

Excellent recipe.  The pork was so tender and delicious with the sauerkraut and kielbasa. I definitely think I will add the kielbasa in later next time as it was almost too soft, but still good.

This has been a New Year's tradition forever in our family (for luck, ya know).  After draining sauerkraut, we sprinkle brown sugar over it and place roast on top.  The brown sugar cuts the tartness of the kraut and makes it more enjoyable especially for those who really don't like kraut.  Enjoy.

This couldn't have been easier! Based on other reviews I drained & rinsed the sauerkraut, as well as added some beer and brown sugar. Next time I will reduce the amount of sauerkraut since 4 lbs made quite a lot.

This was really great. I made it for my first ever New Years Dinner. I added chopped green apples, sliced onions and a bottle of Beck's beer. I rinsed the sour kraut and I'm glad I did. My boyfriend who "hates" sour kraut cleared his plate. I would add more kilbosa next time and less kraut.
