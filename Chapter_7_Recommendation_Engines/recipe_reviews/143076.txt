This was delicious.

And I sort of made it by mistake.

I know very little about beef.  And I wanted to marinate something.  So I picked up a brisket at the store, not knowing what kind of meat to buy.

I went home and started marinating it.

Then I called my mom and she said "No, no... you don't marinate a brisket.  Take it out of your marinade and throw it in a crock pot."

But I was determined.

So I searched for "marinated brisket" and this was the only recipe that came up.

It's a good thing it did... because it saved my brisket.  And it came out beautifully.  Tender, juicy, and delicious.

If I can make this one, anyone can.

Totally easy, and totally good.

Thank you!

This was very easy and had a great taste.  I used A-1 Bold & Spicy steak sauce.  After cooking for 6 hrs it didn't need to be cooked further.  I've already had people ask for the recipe.

This was good, though I think it could have been better.  The steak sauce I chose probably contributed to that, therefore I don't recommend using Vidalia Onion Steak Sauce.  I also thought it needed more salt, which surpised me because the recipe calls for 1 Tbsp.  The brisket was nice and tender.  Also, I loved being able to fix it early to cook all day.  It smelled wonderful.  After one bite, my family smothered it all in BBQ sauce, so next time I might use that in the marinade instead of steak sauce.

I bought a marinade at the store not realizing marinades are not typical for bbq brisket.  The marinade was similar to this recipe but I have added ketchup and steak sauce after reading this.  After letting the brisket marinade overnight I seared it on the grill.  While it was searing I cut up potatoes into large chunks and put them at the bottom of a large pot.  I then placed the seared brisket on top of this.  I poured in the marinade on top of the brisket and then  added beef broth till it covered the potatoes.  I allowed it to cook until tender; about 5 hours.  I think it would have been even better if I had let it cook a couple more hours but we were hungry.  I thought that the potatoes were not going to be very good this way but my husband thought they were good when he stole a bite out of the pot.

This was okay. I prefer brisket grilled but it was nice for something different.

I've used this recipe twice now. The first time, I fed my husband's crew Thanksgiving dinner. A year later, they're still asking me to make it again. I followed the recipe exactly, although I had to adjust quantities for the huge brisket I bought. The guys ate so much of it that they all got in trouble for not wanting to eat dinner with their families. 

 I think it turned out better the second time though. I cut back the liquid smoke a bit so it wasn't quite so strong. I will be making it again for the holidays this year.
