This recipe was so easy to prepare and didn't require a long list of ingredients.  I used 2 cups of cheese (since I prefer a cheesier mac & cheese) but left all of the other ingredients the same as in the original recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm usually more a fan of creamy mac and cheese, but every now and then I get a hankering for the firm, slightly dry, baked-custard variety. This fit the bill perfectly - it was enough to satisfy my craving (over two meals) without having a whole lot left over. I took another reviewer's advice and sprinkled a little extra cheddar on top (omitting the butter), which I recommend. I also added a pinch of onion powder and a pinch of ground mustard.

This was my first time doing Thanksgiving, and I needed a recipe like Mom used to make (before she got sick) because mac and cheese casserole is required at every celebration in my extended family.  This was hit - what a relief!  I tripled it and cooked it in a 9 x 11 pan.  Next time, I may add a little more milk and egg for added fluff, and do a smaller pan or larger recipe because it wasn't as deep as we prefer it.

I quadrupled this recipe and used whole wheat rotini in a 9x13 dish for a dinner party.  Turned out great!  Oh, I also sprinkled some paprika on top for some color.  What I love about this recipe is it uses items I always have on hand.  It's a keeper!  Thanks!

This is my Mom's recipe minus the cayenne and black pepper mixed in with the egg and milk.....brought back memories.  If you top with more cheese or bread crumbs it may stop the noodles on top from getting hard and yucky.

This recipe was super easy and quick to prepare. Although not as creamy as I generally like mac-n-cheese, it was still very tasty. I will definitely make again.

Enjoyed the recipe! I did follow some of the other reviews suggestions. I omitted the butter, and then added an extra 1/2 C of cheese on top. Next time I think I will add some bread crumbs on top too.

I found this recipe by entering in ingredients I had on hand.  Great, simple, classic mac and cheese recipe.  I added more cheese and milk.  Boyfriend loved it.

Easiest, quickest mac and cheese I've ever made.  Very yummy.  I made it for my 12 month old son and I for lunch.  He gobbled it all up!

This recipe was weird.  It wasn't like a traditional mac and cheese (which is what I was looking for).  It was good though - I had to make some changes to the recipe because I was lacking in some ingredients (I used marble instead of cheddar, and added a 1tbs of cream cheese to the milk/egg mixture and beat it until smooth), and I added some chives and a sprinkle of garlic powder, and some black pepper.  It tastes delicious, but wasn't what I was expecting.

Really good and easy!  It was a little bit like a macaroni and cheese quiche because of the egg, but I liked it!

I doubled the recipe and used shell macaroni.  1 1/2 C. dry shells made about 2 1/3 C. cooked, so I'll use a few more next time.  

Also, I got kind of uneven cheese distribution following the directions.  Next time, I'm going to layer the noodles and cheese in the pan, then pour the milk/egg/salt mixture over the top and see how that goes.

Very good!  I add extra cheese on top and sometimes use only 3/4 of the egg if its large.  I often use this recipe  for the two of us.  Thanks so much for posting.

This is super easy, but I find it a bit quiche like when made as stated.  I doubled the recipe and not the egg, and it turned out better.

I followed a few of the suggestions and added 1/2 tsp. of ground thyme, a little onion salt and a dash or two of worcestersire sauce.  Instead of dotting with butter I melted the butter and mixed it with some Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs for the topping.  It was delicious!!

I have been menu planning recently and I let my boyfriend choose the meal once during the week (only once cuz he usually picks  not on my diet) and last week he chose mac and cheese. I wasn't terribly excited, but this is one of the healthier recipes I found... I added more cheese than this recipe called for (my boyfriend love cheese) and this came out great!! Very impressed.

Good recipe!  I had to triple the recipe and it just wasn't cheesy enough.  I also think that it needs regular cheddar or a milder cheese to accompany the sharp cheddar.

Nice amount of macaroni and cheese to not have a ton of leftovers.  My husband and I had this as a side dish and had a small amount left for lunch the next day.  This is a good recipe - but only if you are not looking for a creamy version.  This is a drier version, but with lots of taste.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add some diced onions.

I used shells instead of elbows and half and half instead of milk.  Had a cheese blend of mozzarella and cheddar so I used that. I sprinkled it with breadcrumbs also. I only had a 2 qt dish instead of 1 qt - don't know if that made a difference or not.  Sorry, will keep looking for another mac and cheese recipe.

I wanted just a basic mac and cheese recipe and have used this one ever since I found it.  I usually double it though, so it's thicker in the pan.

Overall this is a fantastic and simple mac and cheese recipe. Loved it.

The only thing I changed was that I omitted the butter entirely, and personally, I'm not keen on the way cheddar separates, so next time I make this, I will make with Clearfield American Cheese (New Yorker is a similar brand) to replace the cheddar. 

Definitely sharing this with my other mac and cheese loving family members!

This is a great and easy mac and cheese recipe.  I made a couple of modifications (and am rating based on how mine turned out) - I used both sharp cheddar and gruyere cheese for a little more flavor.  I also threw in a few dashes of nutmeg and little garlic salt.  Once it was baked I put a little more gruyere on top and put it under the broiler so that the top got a bit crunchy.  Yum!

This was pretty good. It was really rich and salty, so next time I will cut down on the salt and add some garlic powder.

I tried out this recipe tonight for my boyfriend and I and we thought it was delicious.  But it needed more cheese, almost another 1/2 cup.  But all in all it was really good!  And so easy to make, I had all the ingredients in my house.

Basic but very easy to make. My ten month old loves it. I add bread crumbs to the top along with melted butter. I also have added leftover turkeyloaf to it and that was very good.
