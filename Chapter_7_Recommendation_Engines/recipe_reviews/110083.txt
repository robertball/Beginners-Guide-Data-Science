This salsa is very delicious and refreshing. The contrast of the sweet blueberries with the heat of the hot peppers and the savory onions is perfect. Though I was skeptical about not adding lime juice to a salsa the choice of vinaeger to marry the bright and well chosen flavors in this salsa was well suited for this recipe. Along with the obvious health benefits of this salsa it is delicious, incredebly versatile 
and is well suited as a condiment for a myriad of dishes. It is the best fruit salsa I have ever had.

Excellent Salsa. I love the blueberry addition. I was surprized how it went very well with the slight heat of the salsa.  I would only add a bit more salt.

Great marriage of flavors. I will definitely make blueberry salsa again. Loved the colors. When I made it(with wild ME blueberries) it didn't look anything like the picture.

Great refreshing salsa served with chips on a hot day.  I did not bother boiling the tomatoes to remove the skin.  I just chopped and seeded them and mixed with the other ingredients.

Refreshing dish makes great side.  Kept it simple and used chopped cherry tomatoes and passed on all the work of removing seeds.  Used purple onion and subbed lime for rice vinegar and serrano for jalapeno pepper.  Enjoyed this dish, blueberries complemented other ingredients nicely.  I served with crumb coated chicken thighs from this site.

Just perfect!  I did use a bit more Walla Walla sweet onion and blueberry than was called for due to personal taste.  Do not shy away from this one because of the blueberries.  It's really wonderful.

I added extra blueberries when I was done and realized I wanted more.  I didn't use as much onion.  Call me lazy, but I didn't cook and peel the tomatoes, I just diced them.  I seeded them only a little bit (I don't mind the seeds as that's where there's the most flavor in that little pocket of gel around the seed), I didn't have the Hungarian Hot Pepper so I just used extra jalapeno -- but I still felt it needed to be spicier to counterbalance the sweet.  I also just used (lots of) cilantro (have a major overabundance in the garden right now) and not parsley. It's great with chips but I bet it would be super tasty on top of some grilled salmon!

Who would've ever known that salsa and blueberries would work so well together? I like others just chopped up some juicy tomatoes...didn't cook or seed them. The blueberries were fresh from NC, not wild Maine...but nice and tart.

I made this as written except I bought the smallest haberno I could find and used the whole thing. This was like a party in my mouth and everyone loved, even those who do not like blueberries. I used NJ blueberries and they were very sweet!!

This is so summery & the flavor combo is vibrant.  I did add  a splash of lime & served as a side to the Key West Chicken from this site.

This is my new favorite salsa recipe. I served it with a summer steak salad and it was delicious! The only thing I changed was to add one Tablespoon of sugar. Delicious!

This is a fabulous use of the heirloom tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers from the garden.   My heirloom tomatoes were very watery, so I put them in a colander while I chopped the remaining ingredients.  Despite some draining, it was still watery, so I just used a slotted spoon to scoop the salsa from the mixing bowl into the serving bowl.  I didnâ€™t have the Hungarian hot pepper, but it still was very tasty.

OMG! This recipe is so delicious and I don't even like blueberries! I have made this recipe twice since finding it not long ago. I didn't have jalapenos, cilantro, Italian parsley, or Hungarian chilli peppers. Instead I used regular parsley, half a scotch bonnet pepper. It was amazinggggg!

I made the Blueberry Salsa but I didn't have any jalapeÃ±o peppers so I substitute with Ground Cayenne Red Pepper.  It is so good and I did add some sugar as suggested in the reviews it needed it and a touch of lime.  Of course I made a margarita and I am cooking Fajitas to go with this.

It was THE best! A definite repeat. Alterations made were: omitted hot pepper, parsley, salt & pepper. Did use a large jalapeÃ±o pepper. I used the 'real' Maine native blueberries, & added 1 cup frozen (& thawed) crushed Wyman berries.

Love this salsa. The blueberry is an absolutely delightful touch. So fresh and flavorful.
