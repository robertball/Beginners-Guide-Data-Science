For those who want something traditional but don't really like gingerbread.  These are a little, well, more chocolately. Only a hint of ginger. (And as we all know chocolate makes everything better.) I found these simple and to make and they look really nice too!

I've been making this recipe for my own kids for a few years now. Most kids don't really go for gingerbread of anykind, but this recipe is fantastic! I made these for my daughter's Kindergarten Christmas party this week and everyone flipped for them! Instead of molasses, I use brown sugar and just add some extra water until the dough is smooth. I've found that you can freeze unbaked cut-out dough in freezer wrap and just pop the cookies in the oven for a quick treat.  I use royal icing on these, and they're always a hit!

I made these with 'Buttercream Icing ' from here on allrecipes, what a great cookie!  Kids and adults alike loved them!  A nice change from 'boring old gingerbread'.

After refrigerating this dough until firm, it was dry and difficult to work with.  I ended up having to add some water to make it rollable.  Once I did that, it was workable, but, alas they don't taste very good!  Stick to straight gingerbread!!!!  You will be happier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, they were fun to make, but really....chocolate and gingerbread? I love those two tastes separately, but together they were awful. The recipe was quick and it was very easy for my 4 yr old to roll the dough and cut out gingerbread cookie shapes. The dough was soft and pliable, didn't fall apart or crack when rolled, and the shapes stayed together when we moved them to the cookie sheet. Cooking time was fast and the texture of the cookie was pleasantly soft and moist. With quite a bit of vanilla frosting (also found on Allrecipes.com) to cover up the taste, they were edible. I think I'll stick to regular gingerbread cookies next time.

these were great, I almost didn't make them because of the bad reviews but my daughter begged me to make them so I did. I'm so glad I made them because they were wonderful and everybody loved them.

These cookies are OKAY. They are great for cutting into different shapes, but they don't taste...well, that good. I'd only be able to eat them if they were covered in frosting.

I made the recipe just as suggested.  No problems with the dough and the gingerbread shapes turned out great.  The problem was the taste of the cookie itself.  I like gingerbread, but did not like this combination.  Didn't taste like chocolate or gingerbread...almost like dirt!  I took the cookies to my kids' preschool and they did seem to like them, although the frosting might have contributed to this!  Will not try this recipe again.

I love this recipe!  The dough might be grainy and you might wonder how you'll ever get it rolled out...not to worry - it rolls out beautifully after a minute or so of gentle kneading.  These were a big hit on Christmas Eve...both gingerbread lovers and haters liked them.  Those who love gingerbread liked the chocolate addition and those who normally dislike gingerbread enjoyed the mild spice flavor.  I'll be making these again, for sure!

Easy and tastes great!  Guessed on the amount of chocolate as only had squares and it still turned out good.  Instead of piping chocolate to decorate, simply added food dye to store bought icing and spread on then decorated.  Even chilled it in the freezer for about 20 min as I was short for time and it still rolled out and cooked well.  A delicious change from regular gingersnaps!  Great for the kids!  Try it!
