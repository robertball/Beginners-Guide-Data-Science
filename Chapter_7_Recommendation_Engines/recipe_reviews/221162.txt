I made this for dinner last night for my husband, and Mom and Dad who live next door. My husband wasn't too happy about me making it as he likes his steaks BBQ'd, but when we sat down for dinner he ate every bit of his and liked it really well. I have a hard time chewing steak, but this was very tender and was able to cut with a butter knife or even sometimes my fork. Dad isn't a steak eater at all so I cooked a chicken breast for him along with the steaks. On the video the chef said that by now we should be thinking of 17 different ways to change this sauce up and he was right. I decided to use a teriyaki sauce instead of BBQ sauce. It was an easy meal to make. Mom made twice baked potatos and a veggie and cantalope to go along with it. When we were all done there was one piece of steak and half the chicken breast left so I left it with my mom and it soaked in that wonderful sauce all night and day. She said tonight it was even better than last night. Dad said it was the best piece of chicken he's ever had! So I think next time I'm going to marinate the meat in the sauce for a few hours or up to overnight... or possibly sear off the meat and make the sauce in the afternoon and put it in my crockpot on low for a couple hours to soak in that wonderful sauce flavor.
Great recipe Chef John!! It's a keeper!

I have made this three times. Each time I used a different sauce, A1, teriyaki, and Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue. I liked the barbecue the best. My cut of meat was called chuck tender steak and it worked perfectly. This a new favorite because everyone loved it. 5+ stars and by the way we do 2 minutes per side, anything less was too rare for our tastes.

I did this recipe w/ Ribeye & Angus Sirloin I really did the beating of the meat with meat tenderizer. I change the marinade used steak sauce instead of barbecue.. I also omitted the hot pepper sauce didn't want it spicy.. But overall the steaks came out great this was my first time cooking steak in a frying pan on top of the stove. The gravy came out     perfect my brother-in-law thought it was steak sauce till he tasted it .

I used petite sirloin steaks for this recipe. I seasoned the steaks with Montreal steak seasoning after tenderizing it. I didn't have beef stock so I use a chicken and doubled the sauce recipe. Omitted the oil but used everything else. I did add some corn starch to thicken the sauce. I doubled the sauce since it was nice to use it for dipping. My son doesn't like steaks since he has a hard time chewing it so I sliced his thin. Amazingly, he ate it all! Therefore a 5 stars was given, along as it was pretty tasty too. Thanks!

Didn't really care for the barbecue butter sauce. I guess it depends what specific ingredients you use, but I didn't like mine. The method for cooking the steak worked well. (I had some teriyaki sauce left over in the fridge, and I heated it and used it as a dipping sauce for the steak. That was great! Check out Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce by Celeste on this site. I used it for chicken originally, and now steak, but you can probably use it for shrimp as well.)

We really enjoyed this.  Easy and fast!  I used a bit of worcestershire sauce with the gravy recipe and it was perfect.  I'd make this again in a minute, literally :)  Thanks for another winner Chef John.

Watching the video first is a must.  This is a fast and simple recipe that my whole family liked.  One thing is I will thicken the broth mixture to a sauce.  I will add this one to my recipe box.

This is the first recipe that we used from Chef John many years ago and ever since we have been big fans of this talented Chef.  This is truly an easy recipe that will make you look like a rock star in the kitchen, if you follow the recipe.

This was fantastic, and I don't usually like pan frying steaks, but following the instructions and particularly combined with the sauce, it's great.  I used sirloin tip steaks, and next time I will double the sauce, mostly because I had leftovers and would have liked more sauce to have with leftovers.  I used the leftover for steak and eggs and that was also fantastic!

Very tasty very quick. I did end up thickening up my sauce a bit so I could serve it over mashed potatoes but other than that left it original this go round. I can see lots of different variations with this one!

I had to cook my steaks a little bit longer than a minute on each side and they were still pretty rare.  I like them rare/med rare so it was okay.  I also added some Worcestershire sauce and a little bit of A-1 steak sauce to the sauce part and omitted the hot pepper sauce because my toddlers & I are not big on spicy food.  I thought it was delicious.  (Oh, and I also seasoned the steaks with tenderizer, seasoned salt, pepper, & garlic powder).

It tasted wonderful...my kids all went for seconds (even the daughter that doesn't really like red meat)  I thought the sauce was a little runny, so I added a some flour to thicken it up a bit.

I really REALLY love this recipe and have made it at least 6 times so far experimenting with different cuts of meat. It is so fast and easy and really delicious with the sauce. I also made this with boneless thin cut pork chops and even that was a hit. I usually serve with some kind of potato and make extra sauce to for dipping.

As a kid I ate my minute steak salted with butter on the side. I love them to this day. Great sauce, John :). Thanks so much for sharing this.

Very simple and delicious.  I didn't use the hot pepper sauce as we don't like spicy things.  We ate every bit of it and liked it very well!

This recipe was easy and yummy! I used elk round steak because it's what I had, but next time will use a better cut of meat. I doubled the sauce and put 1 1/2 tbs. each of steak sauce and barbecue sauce. Also thickened it with flour and served it with Parmesan-butter baked red potatoes and vegetables. My husband enjoyed it also. Thank you Chef John!

I had several thin sirloins and this was a great recipe and method for cooking.  My biggest regret is that the sauce was very thin.  It was still delicious.

I pretty much doubled this, and seasoned with McCormick's Nature's Seasoning which is my go to.  I have to say this is one we raved about. I seer my steaks with a little bit extra butter in the pan, but I think that just heightened the flavor of the sauce, which is thin and begged to be sopped up in crusty bread or poured over some cubed potatoes.

I served over brown rice with asparagus. I made as is, but had to leave on simmer in the sauce til the fam got home - about 30 mins - and did not get too tough. Minute steak is not meant to be the most tender steak, it’s about the flavor. Chopped over rice with the sauce my boyfriend said it was delicious, and he is a steak snob. Great budget and simple dinner with staple ingredients usually on hand. I like to keep beef bullion on hand incase I’m out of beef broth. Thanks Chef John!

I made the recipe as written. I was surprised how good it was. The steak was tender and tasty. I bought a small sirloin about 1.7lbs and cut it in 3 pieces. This way I had 3 thick pieces. So pounding them to 1/4" really breaks the meat down so that it's nice and tender .

This sauce is perfect...just a light barbeque flavor. I cooked the sauce a little longer and reduced it. I also used the Steak Using the Fast-Flip Method recipe for cooking my top sirloin steak before adding this sauce. It was melt in your mouth delicious!

This was really good. I love how easy it is to prepare. I had 6 small steaks so I doubled the sauce. It was ‘t really necessary as I had extra sauce left over. The only thing I did differently was after the steaks were cooked and the sauce was reduced I put the steaks into the sauce to heat up a bit more. Thanks for the recipe.

Family loved it! I read other reviews and doubled the sauce and left out the hot sauce because my 5 year-old had dental surgery and cannot have spicy foods for a few days. I used petite sirloins and cooked longer per side because it was too rare for my liking.

This was interesting.  Good enough to eat but probably not a do over.  The trick is DO NOT over cook your beef.  Mine came out perfect and it's probably what saved the dish. The sauce was just interesting.  I'm sure there are other beef sauces that would do better of the steak.  Maybe a low vinegar BBQ sauce?

Make sure to pound these thin--I didn't and it took longer to cook. I don't cut teaspoons for butter so I used an entire tablespoon. I left off the hot sauce. T loved it, A&E not so much.

I loved how quick and easy this was, and chances are you will have most of the ingredients on hand.  I floured the minute steaks before sautéing them.  Not sure if it made a huge difference but my husband really enjoyed the meal and thought the flouring "added something."

I tripled the batch and wound up with leftover sauce, so poured the sauce over the steaks and left them in the fridge for a couple of days. Even better after it's sat in the sauce for a couple of days. Awesome recipe and super easy!

I cooked this exactly according to recipe except I omitted the hot pepper sauce.  It was flavorful and my teenage son kept raving about the sauce.  IMO, although the sauce was good, it was pitufully thin and I wish it would have thickened a little bit but I could not get that to happen.  Served with mashed potatoes and oven roasted asparagus and it was a hit.

Delicious, and so easy! I don't have much experience cooking steak, so this recipe was very helpful. I didn't have hot sauce, and I forgot that the butter was supposed to be chilled and not mixed in, but it still came out scrumptious. I will definitely be making this again.

The steaks were tender and the sauce delicious. I really loved the favors! The sauce I made was a little thin. Maybe I would leave it on the stove a little longer or try it in the crockpot as another reviewer suggested.

I had cube steaks so just used those because I was so eager to try the sauce! I doubled the sauce, and used Penzey's CA Seasoned Pepper instead of black pepper. Delicious! Made mashed potatoes with them, and my son said he could have eaten a plate full of taters with the sauce poured over them!

Simply excellent.   Talk about quick!  This can be done as fast as it took my microwave potatoes to cook.

I used this with some sirloin patties.  No beef broth so I used beef soup base in water. This was yummy, but even better when I added a splash of gourmet quality balsamic vinegar! Out of this world!

WOW  I made this recipe last night with some prime rib eye. I added some A1, worcestirshire, and a little cornstarch slurry for thickness and served with boiled potatoes and spinach. I fried the steak in a cast iron pan for 70 seconds. Maybe 90 seconds per side would be better with rib eye, but it was delicious anyway and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Thanks, Chef John.

this was super easy and tasty, but i would change just one thing. As I like my steak on the medium rare to medium side, I would not have pounded the steak so thin. I felt like it didnt have time to create the ever so important "bits" on the bottom of the pan for the gravy before overcooking (for me) the meat.I used a habanero sauce from the farmers market cuz I like the heat, YUMMY!
