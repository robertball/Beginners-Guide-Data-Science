SUPER easy to make - even easier to devour. The baking/broiling of the graham crackers made them extra crispy. I used mini marshmallows instead or large ones and enjoyed the way it turned out - the outsides were crackly just like over a campfire, but the insides were nice and gooey and hot. So simple to throw together for a last-minute dessert, and even my 11-year-old niece helped make it with me (I just put the pan in the oven, but she did all the prep work by herself).
