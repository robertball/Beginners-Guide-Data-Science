Not your Momma's Mac 'N Cheese. This sauce is a little more "tomato-y"... and the heavy cream makes it rich and smooth. It's really good. Be sure to use Fontina for the top, because it melts beautifully! Another great Barilla recipe!

This is another recipe that I adapted for use at our soup kitchen.  We had a nice package of grated mozzarella, so I sprung for a few jars of the Tuscan Herb Sauce (which I really like!) and I used half and half in place of the heavy cream.  It was a huge success!  Once again Barilla made me look like a star!

We really enjoyed this dish.  It was rich and creamy and yummy.  The Tuscan Herb sauce is delicious, and the cheesy goodness just adds to it.  The picture I took is before we dug into it just to show the wonderful cheese on top.  So easy!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I thought the sauce was incredibly rich but after it baked, it was really nice. I thought it was more like an Italian casserole than mac & cheese. A helpful tip in grating Fontina cheese is to put it in the freezer for 15 minutes before grating, that helps firm up the soft, smooth texture to make it easier to grate. I added ground sirloin and next time would add some sweet sausage. I also used Farfalle instead of macaroni.

Very good, simple recipe.  I used monterey jack instead of fontina because that's what I could find, and I added fresh basil and extra garlic.  I also served with Italian sausage. Came together very quickly.

I would have given this 4 stars because i thought it was good but not amazing. My kids on the other hand, they loved it! Even my picky little eater ate all she could. So this is a 5 star recipe says my kids.

What a wonderful way to incorporate the Barilla sauce with a classic favorite. The fontina cheese is a must for this recipe. The flavor combination with the cream, cheese, and tomato sauce is delectable to the last bite. I'd highly suggest giving this recipe a try. It's quick, tasty, a twist on a classic, and I think your whole family would thank you.

We really liked this! I make mac and cheese fairly often from scratch and this was a nice twist! The kids liked it but did tell me to go back to my old way - I would definitely make this for a group!

this one won my family over! I almost did a goof and didn't add the heavy whipping cream until after I mixed things together and caught my mistake. Thankfully I put it back on the stove, mixed it right in and then completed the recipe by putting it in the oven and put that nice fresh creamy shredded Fontina cheese on the top. Mad was it really good. Can see making this one again. LOVE Fontina cheese!! This was excellent.

Excellent! I was exhausted from work and needed something I could put together in a flash. This fit the bill! Fontina is a favorite cheese and the Tuscan sauce was fresh and delicious. Thanks, Barilla!

think it needs a little more than just some garlic & cheese but it still worked for us.

Delicious! My kids loved it. Tasted just like the inside of a hot pocket without the pepperoni. But next time id definitly add meat. Sausage sounds like a great idea.

Super easy recipe, made it quickly before work one morning and it was a big hit.  Few ingredients and little prep, I love that.  The taste was awesome.  I would use as a side dish, not a main meal. I only gave this four starts simply because my family would have loved it more if it had meat in it.  Next time I will add Italian sausage or ground beef.

Great easy to make recipe. Would be okay to substitute other cheeses if you do not have fontina on hand. Was awesome to heat up after too.

Though we thought it was good, there were a few things I had to add to the recipe to give it the additional flavor it lacked as written.  The Tuscan Herb Sauce is delicious when cream is added, and incorporates well with the pasta.  I found that additional garlic was needed, in addition to an Italian herb blend to give this dish a boost.  Fresh chopped basil gave it a nice aroma and added flavor.  I think a ground beef or sausage would make it more like a meal.  I'll probably try the sauce with larger noodles and some added veggies next time.

We truly enjoyed this recipe.  It has a unique, tasty flavor.  We particularly enjoyed the mixes of the freshly shredded cheese fontina cheese, grated parmesan cheese and the creamy Tuscan sauce.  Unlike other reviewers of this recipe, I did not have a problem with the cheese melting.  It is important to note that the pasta and sauce must still be hot when mixed with the cheese.  It would probably even help to add a bit extra parmesan cheese.  Can’t wait to make this again!

This was less a mac and cheese and more a goulash.  Parmigiano isn't exactly a super-melty cheese, and it is the only cheese that is actually mixed in with the pasta.  That being said, it's a terrible mac and cheese but a pretty decent goulash after adding browned ground Johnsonville Italian Sausage!  Are there better recipes for goulash out there?  Yep, but this one is quick and easy and one that my kids loved!  So glad I read the previous review, because the Johnsonville ground Italian sausage totally saved this dish!

I made the recipe as written and it needed more flavor, so I added Italian Breadcrumbs on top and garnished with some fresh basil. That helped with the flavor a great deal. I'd like to try it again adding seasoned ground beef to the recipe.

This was really tasty! Everyone loved it! Everyone went back for seconds. We loved all the flavors of the Tuscan Herb Sauce and the Fontina cheese on top was AMAZING! I didn't care for the grated cheese though because of the feel but it was tasty. I'm thinking next time I'll mix fontina cheese in the entire dish inside and top because it was so tasty!

I liked this. I made it exactly as written. My kids really loved it, so I will probably make it again, but I thought it was missing something that I couldn't put my finger on. It is something different from your usual Mac and cheese.

This was good but needed some help.  I used shell pasta (because that's my favorite!) and added some bread crumbs, basil, and parsley.  I also added some mushrooms because I was trying for a main dish and I needed to use them before they went bad.  What's great about this recipe is that you can totally add veggies to your liking!  I used a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheese simply because that's what I had, also.  I'll probably make this again, especially since the husband really liked it!
