This was a delicious addition to a small brunch!
I used 2 frozen Marie Calendars pie shells (to save time) and reduced the amount of cheese by half, and it was GREAT!

What a nice treat! It is time consuming like an old-fashioned recipe - before the days of throw a can of soup in with something and ta-da it's done --but, it's worth the effort! I made it for a Father's Day brunch; it was well received. I used 9-in pie plates and I think next time I will reduce the amount of cream as it was just a tad soft. Like someone else mentioned try a longer baking time, it didn't seem done so I turned down the heat and gave it another 30 minutes. Try it with different meats and cheeses, it's probably very versatile. Reminded me of a bed-and-breakfast style dish -with the fresh herbs and touch of nutmeg and almonds.

You were right when you said this is some work...but the crust was excellent. Great taste, I added a few things; shallots, broccoli,swiss cheese instead of cheddar. My husband thougth it was great, actually had two helpings.

This recipe is GREAT!  I have made this two years running for a senior citizen luncheon and it is now requested! I found it takes longer to bake, so I reduced the temp a little at the end and it turned out wonderful.  A lot of prep work, but well worth it.  Make it, you won't be sorry.

Fabulous!  I halved the recipe to make only one tart.  I used a store bought pastry shell instead of making my own, and used colby-jack cheese.  It's a great combination of flavors but the almonds on top set it apart from any other breakfast tart you've ever had.  Highly recommend this recipe.  It would be very easy to adjust to individual taste.  I will try some more veggies next time--bell peppers, zucchini would both be tasty additions.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Great! And while I'm here, I have a suggestion for those who have trouble cutting cinnamon rolls: Don't use a knife! Break off a 15" piece of white cotton thread, slip it horizontally under the roll  to be cut and pull the thread ends to cross. The dough will be cut easily and neatly.  Just move the thread down the roll to cut the next one.

This is a great recipe.  The dough for the crust was a little wet, but working in a little extra flour made it easy to work with and it was delicious.  Will definitely be making this one again!

OMG, this is the best quiche I've ever had (and I've had a few).  The combination of cream cheese, thyme and nutmeg send it over the top.  I omitted the green onions and almonds because I don't like them.  I also made it crustless to save on carbs and it came out perfect!

YUM!  I used a store bought crust to save time.  I substituted 1 cup condensed milk for the heavy cream, and 1 t. dried Herbes de Provence (always in my pantry) in place of the fresh basil and thyme, and replaced the monterey jack with emmental cheese (aged variety of swiss).  Everyone at my mom's coffee morning wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing; it's much better than the basic quiche recipe I usually make!

This breakfast tart was not difficult to make, and it was an elegant and sophisticated change from the usual breakfast egg dishes. The cream cheese added richness and the fresh herbs and almonds were the perfect finishing touches. I used more ham since I omitted the bacon - I was serving candied bacon as a side. I will increase the amount of nutmeg next time - maybe doubling it, since I couldn't detect the nutmeg flavor in the end. I made this for a brunch and the adults and even an 11 year old boy loved it.  I am adding this to my "one day when I have a B and B" list!

I made this for mothers day brunch and WOW, I wish I had found this recipe sooner! I added a bit more bacon and ham and a deep 9 inch pie plate since I did not have a 10. I  sauteed the green onion with the regular onion for the filling (though that was by sheer accident so I sprinkled a lot less green onion on top). I also reduced the cream by 1/4 cup per quiche based on a review. I did find this need to cook and extra 15 minutes. The fresh thyme and basil just send this over the top!

Made this this morning for church. Read the reviews first, so I knew it would take a little longer than 40 minutes to cook. Except for the crust, I followed the directions exactly. It got nothing but raves. It IS a lot of work, but it is worth it. It is very rich so, if you like you can use fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Another reviewer ;halved the cheese, and still another made it crustless. There are ways to cut the calories. Read your reviews. I love basil. Wonderful, wonderful dish. Thank you bettina.

This was maybe the best quiche ever!  Baked it in two deep dish pie plates rather than tart pans.  Then I used 10 eggs and 2% milk, light cream cheese (6 oz) & 2% milk rather than the cream /  DELICIOUS!!

I made this and brought it to work, everyone loved it.It does take alittle prep time though, but worth it.I didn't have a 10 inch pan, so I used my 9inch deep dish, it just took alittle longer, approx 15 more minutes to cook.All the flavors blend really nice, not to bland or spicy...I'll make this again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  It did take a while (letting the dough for the crust chill 30 min, pre-baking the crust which took forever for some reason, and finally baking it.  But it is DELICIOUS!!!  I made it for dinner & my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I divided it by 4 to fit into a 7" pie pan and it was a little too much filling but everything else worked great.  I will definitely make this again on an evening when I have a little more time to prepare dinner.  Delish!

This was fabulous.
It's better than our favorite quiche!
I did have to cook it an extra 15 minutes or so before it wasn't liquid in the center still.  Fancy too!  Make it as a show off dish!

Alot of work, though I opted to make a Bisquick pie crust instead. It was good, but we prefer a more simple quiche-type pie.

I love this recipe and it never fails to wow company!  One day I hope to try the pie crust recipe but ’ve been using frozen pie crust very successfully.  I’ve made this without bacon and green onions, with different hard cheeses, milk instead of cream and it’s still great, although I will try to include the green onions in the future. I’ve halved the recipe very successfully but making two tarts and freezing one for later is my preference!

This was an amazing dish that was well worth the effort. Many have said that it is a lot of work, but if you love to cook, it doesn't seem that bad at all. I, like others only had a 9 inch pan to use. This required an extra 15 min of bake time in the end, but turned out fantastic. I will definitely be making this dish again in the near future.
