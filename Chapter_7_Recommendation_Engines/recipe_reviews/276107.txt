I made this twice, once as instructed and the second time with changes. I disagree with the water and ice cubes being used as they dilute the flavor. I also did not like the stevia (One packet) as it caused this to be cloyingly sweet, and when combined with the Torani pumpkin syrup, too sweet.
Changes I made the second time around:
Removed the water, swapped in more almond milk. Froze some pumpkin to use instead of ice cubes.
Omitted the stevia and used the same amount of Torani pumpkin syrup as originally called for. I found this to be much improved over the original version, and worthy of five stars after the changes.
