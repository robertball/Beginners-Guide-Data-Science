This recipe was very good and really a snap to put together.  I did make a number of changes since I was scaling this down to just two servings.  I used one large boneless skinless chicken breast, pounded slightly and cut in half.  I used more carrot, peppers (red and yellow) and mushrooms than called for and a large clove of garlic.  I used one can of diced tomatoes already flavored with oregano, garlic and basil, so I cut the Italian seasoning to 1 teaspoon.  I first browned the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil and placed it in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I then deglazed the skillet with the tomatoes and their juice.  I combined all the other ingredients (except the pasta) with the tomatoes and poured everything on top of the chicken in the slow cooker.  My chicken was done in just four hours.  The only problem was the carrots weren’t quite as tender as I’d have liked, so next time I will substitute orange bell peppers and leave the carrots out all together.  I did thicken this up a bit with a corn starch/water slurry.  Rather than pasta, I served this over rice.  I will do this one again.  Hubs will be happy, because he loved it.

Made this exactly as directed and it was fantastic!  I cooked it for 6 hours and the chicken was done to perfection.  I used Bell and Evans brand boneless, skinless, chicken thighs, which are available in my area.  The chicken was not dry or overcooked.  Perfect for a snowy winter night!  I'll defininitely be making this again.

I read the other reviews and made a few changes. I thickened the sauce by adding tomato paste to the crushed tomatoes, we like a thicker sauce, it turned out perfectly. I doubled the amount of garlic which gave it a rich Italian flavor. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acid in the tomatoes. I checked the chicken temperature at the 5 hour mark , the chicken was done so I turned off the crock pot and the chicken was perfectly moist. I served it over spaghetti squash for a low carb meal. I will definitely make this again!

Easy enough to prepare.  Cooked for 7 hours.  Only problem was,the chicken fell apart, so what I ended up with was tomato sauce with strings of chicken over pene.  
A little crushed red pepper and/or ground fennel would have kicked it up a bit.  Something seemed to be missing.

I am rating this recipe 3 stars because I think it's got a good foundation however needs some work. I've made this in a skillet and in a crockpot and the skillet version is WAY better. Browning the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper (and breading the chicken would be good too) and adding more seasoning along the way in the skillet adds more flavor compared to the instructions in the current recipe. The recipe was bland for me in the crockpot. I'm not a fan of using a lot of salt in my dishes however this needed it to intensify the flavor. The vegetables and canned tomatoes paired well with the chicken. In my opinion, this recipe could be 5 stars if it's cooked in a skillet for a shorter length of time (~ simmering for 30 min) and more seasoning was added throughout the cook time (e.g. garlic powder, oregano, paprika to the chicken before browning).

I was very pleased with the original recipe the first time I made it. But, I thought it could use a little more spice. The second time I made it I added a teaspoon of salt-free Mrs. Dash to it and it gave it just the right amount of spice.

So yummy! Made as directed except I took out the mushrooms and added some onion. Served with fettuccine alfredo pasta instead of plain penne pasta. So delicious!

This is the first recipe that I’ve made from AllRecipes that I sis not like! I definitely will not be making this again. So, so bland. My husband tried to dress it up to no avail, and he’s a rockstar in the kitchen. The chicken shredded and was bland as well. So not worth the money way I spent on the ingredients.

I added half of a  large onion diced, used a whole head of garlic plus a teaspoon of garlic powder, 3 tbs of Italian seasoning.  I thought that the carrots sounded out of place but they actually added good texture.  I cooked it for 5.5 hours on low and the thighs were perfect.  I will make it again.

I made this exactly except I forgot to buy a red pepper so I subbed an onion that I had.  It was ok but the sauce was pretty bland. I had to add a lot of salt before and after just to pull out some flavors which I do not like to do.  It was very inexpensive to make so I might try again with my own twists to the sauce.
