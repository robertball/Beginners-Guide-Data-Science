This recipe is so similar to what my Mom used to make that I tried it but had to substitute the bread crumbs to 16 saltines,crushed, only used 2 lbs of pork, and one tsp of salt. cook meat in water w/onion until meat is well done then add spices & crackers. Try my version, it's very popular in my house.

I'm a big fan of the English pork pie. I always expect a recipe for "pork pie" to use hot water pastry, like the Hot Water Pie Crust recipe on this site.
