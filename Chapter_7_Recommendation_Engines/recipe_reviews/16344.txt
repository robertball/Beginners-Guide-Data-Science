Wonderful recipe!  My grandmother passed away and I never got her recipe and my family swears this is it to a tee.  They ask me to make it for any family gathering.  I use the canned "tiny" smoked oysters and they work just fine.

This delicious recipe is exactly how my grandmother made this dish during my childhood.  I used to make it and never needed a recipe but then started second guessing myself on measurements after not making it for a few years.  I sprinkle some paprika on top and throw a bit of parsley on top to fancy it up for the holidays.  Hopefully someone puts up a more appetizing photo.  It bakes up golden brown for us.
