Didn't have guinness, so I used Molson Golden. It was amazing! Best ham we ever had!

Made this for my Easter ham. It was delicious. Used Guinness and the ham was very tender and juicy. Thanks for sharing this glaze.

I wanted ham for Sunday dinner, but with a different glaze made with beer. I'm not a beer drinker, but wanted to experiment. This recipe is easy, few ingredients,  and own its own delicious (I mean stand-at-the-counter-and-eat-from-the-bowl delicious.) But once I personalized it with minced garlic, onion powder, and cayenne, it was knock your socks off wow! I simmered it too over low flame and it  got even better. Must try this on bbq ribs and chicken.

We had a chocolate cherry beer on hand a few years ago when we tried this for my family's Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit! Now we make it this way every year. And ohhh, the gravy!!!
