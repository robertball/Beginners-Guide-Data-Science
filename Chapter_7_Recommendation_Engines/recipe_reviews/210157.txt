These meatballs are the best~!  I have added basil and oregano about a teaspoon.  I cook them in the oven in a 13x9 baking dish sprayed with Pam so they don't stick and the clean up is easy.  I cook them at 350 for 15 minutes then turn them and cook for another 15 minutes.  It makes the meatballs a little firmer then I add them to the sauce, I believe truly the best~!

A classic, crowd pleasing meatball- just what I was looking for. My fussiest child loved them! It is a bit of a pain to skim the fat off of the top of the sauce, though. I also added a bit of extra garlic & onion salt to give it a flavor boost.

I have tried many times to make a simple spaghetti & meatball recipe that my picky family would at least like and this one was finally it!  They loved it!  My hubby, (who's like a big kid) said, "This is a keeper, and that's a pretty  good meatball!"  That's what we want to hear, right? LOl  And my kids finished their plates.  Thank you for a yummy and easy recipe!

This recipe was amazing.  It was really easy and very good.  My husband loved it and he is a big meatball critic.  I did bake the meatballs like everyone said 350 for 15 minutes on each side, spraying the pan with pam.  I also added fresh mozzerella cubes and added it on top of the spaghetti and meatballs and it melted in slightly.   This was the first time I cooked meatballs and now I don't have to find another recipe---this is the one.

This is our absolute favorite Spaghetti and Meatballs. Made this many times now, however, I use Prego for the sauce. And for all of you who insist on baking or frying your meatballs first, that step is unnecessary. They cook to perfection every time in the sauce! Holding their shape perfectly and cooking completely!!!

I thought this was excellent, then again I've never made meatballs.  The recipe is basic, and super easy to make.  I did modify it somewhat: we gave up red meat for Lent, so I used ground turkey.  I was skeptical at first, too, but it worked well.  I was also a little leary of dropping raw meat into the sauce, so while it was cooking, I baked the meatballs (30 min. @ 350, turning once).  They may have been even better pan fried in a little olive oil.

This was incredibly easy and delicious! I heeded everyone's advice and baked the meatballs in the oven prior to putting them into the sauce, and they came out amazing. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good, came out great and will make it again! I'd recommend adding some hot sauce like Louisiana for some zest since I love spicy as well.

The meatballs were awesome. My friend said it tasted like Spaghetti Warehouse. I baked the meatballs because to assure myself I cooked them enough.

Fantastic recipe. Even my 3 year old ate 2 plates. Simple to make. I was a little concerned that the meatballs wouldn't be cooked through so I simmered for 25 minutes to be sure.

I tried this recipe for the first night my husband and i spent at home! We just got married on saturday so i wanted to make something he would love and brag about! He absolutely LOVED it! He said it was the best spaghetti he has ever had! I added basil and oregano to the meatballs but other than that! They are wonderful!!

This has been our go-to recipe for meatballs for over a year, and I agree with Shelly - the baking step is completely unnecessary.  The meatballs hold together nicely, and I haven't noticed any fat on the top.  I use lean ground beef, though.  I also use two jars of sauce instead of just one to give the meatballs more room to cook and to make enough for leftovers.  The meatballs are definitely better the next day after they've been in the sauce a while.

this was pretty bland for my liking. Next time I will add some other spices. Fast though and a nice way to use up extra beef!

Yummy!  I fully pan cooked the meatballs in olive oil and drained the fat before adding them to the sauce to simmer for 20 minutes.  They came out very good and very tender.
