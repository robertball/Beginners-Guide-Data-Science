Tasted great and my husband loved it. Was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. The only thing I did differently was to saute the garlic and onions in with the beef which made things easier.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was just ok for me. It is not something that I would typically make but I wanted something easy to throw together for dinner. It was quick and easy. The taste was a bit bland for me definitely season it more.

This recipe was very easy to make. It was a great time saver on a weeknight when we have many things going on! My family all enjoyed it! The only thing I would say is, in the recipe it doesn't tell you when to put the onions and garlic back in. I did it while everything with simmering. I definitely would make this again!

We were pleasantly surprised with this recipe. Growing up on a farm, we rarely ever use canned veggies. These weren't bad at all. Everyone loved the potatoes. The only changes I made to this recipe were I cut the peas, carrots and tomatoes in half. If I'd have put in the full can we wouldn't have been able to taste the meat or potatoes at all (personal preference.) It needed a little more seasoning for our tastes but even my picky seven year old (who hates most vegetables) cleaned his bowl.
