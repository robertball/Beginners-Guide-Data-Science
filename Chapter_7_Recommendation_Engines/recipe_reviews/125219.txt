I have a fabulous rice cooker (everyone should invest in one) so when I saw this recipe I was too excited to make it! Yes, of course I made only a couple of changes, and that is that I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, and I used vegetable broth. Added carrot shreds, used celery seed instead of celery, omitted the butter. 
Perfect rice! Extremely tasty, makes the best side dish for fish and chicken. I definitely will do this again in the rice cooker. Only takes 20 minutes! Thanks!

I rated it three, because I liked it. However, the wife and kids were so-so on it. 

HOWEVER, then I made it again, but changed it a bit. In addition to the celery, I added the same amount of chopped green bell pepper. And instead of chicken broth, I used 1 14.5 oz can of beef broth, 2 tbsp water, and 1 beef cube. I mixed those together, with the soy, the Worcestershire, the oregeno and the thyme, under heat until the cube dissolved. Then I poured over the rice and baked. This variation my wife and kids both raved over, and I would have rated 4 or 5 stars.

With just a little tinkering this is a 5-star recipe and given that this is "just" rice, that's high praise.  My concern wasn't as much with flavor as it was with presentation - I wanted something that would add a little more visual impact since I was serving this with leftover roast chicken and asparagus.  So I did add some garlic, as well as chopped yellow bell pepper and minced jalapeno pepper (mostly because I found it hiding in the corner of the vegetable crisper).  While I did saute the rice with the vegetables,  I didn't bother baking this - it didn't seem necessary. Just before serving I tossed in some fresh minced parsley which added another dimension of color.  We really enjoyed this simple but elegant pilaf and cleaned up every last grain.

It was very easy to make, and very good! We made this as a side to Wahoo fish marinated in Lemon Pepper and it complimented the fish very well.  The mild flavor of the rice did not compete with the more bold flavor of the fish at all.  We would definitely make this again.

I had to change some things to suit my husbands taste (he can be picky).  So instead of chopped celery I used a can of Cream of Celery soup and used a full stick 1/2 cup of real butter (sorry margarine does not cut it)!  I also increased the spices a tad bit and used onion powder instead of chopped onion since my hubby can't stand real onion bits in foods.  I also cooked it on the stove top, eliminating the need to use the oven.  Brought rice to a boil, turned down to simmer (low heat) covered pan and cooking time was approx. 25-20 minutes.  I got the biggest raves from hubby and it had such a nice subtle butter flavor.

This is a nice alternative to the rice dishes I've previously made. I added some minved garlic while browning the rice. Added a nice flavor.

I was looking for something lightly seasoned, not heavy but would go well with the salmon and shrimp I was serving tonight. I added a little bit of chopped red, yellow and green bell peppers to which I sauteed with the rice in the butter. I also added one piece of garlic and some celery seeds. I used 1/2 tsp. of worchestershire sauce and soy sauce for flavoring. I combined this with fresh thyme and italian oregano, salt and black pepper to taste. I did not use the baking method called for in the recipe. Instead I cooked the rice on top of the stove. When the rice was done and fluffed up, I added a handful of minced fresh parsley for color and flavor. We all enjoyed the fresh flavors of the herbs and peppers. The pilaf is seasoned perfectly. The mild flavors in this dish did not compete with the bold flavors of the salmon and shrimp at all. I served this along with, "Tomato Basil Salmon," "Lemon Ginger Shrimp," "Fast and Easy Spinach with Shallots," all from this website.

It seems the only recipes that I rate are the ones I consider 5 stars...this was great...mild in flavor, but very good.  I served this with salmon cooked on the grill and it turned out great..all of the kids ate it also, and since most of their meals has to be goopy with gravy or cheese, this recipe was a hit with them!

An excellent side dish. I like to make it as is but with cornish hens. I put the rice in to four individual roasting pans and nestled a cornish hen rubbed with fresh herbs and butter into each. The hens give the rice an even better flavor as the rice absorbs the juices from the birds as they roast together.

I cut this recipe in half for the four of us. I added in some fresh minced garlic, a little chopped red pepper and some fresh chopped parsley. This was a simple side that was easily thrown together with on hand ingredients in very little time.

Very good!  I made some changes.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and reduced the broth to 3 cups. Used enough olive oil to cover bottom of pan before adding 2 stocks celery and one small onion along with chopped garlic with the rice. Followed directions till time to put into casserole dish.  Did not grease 2 qt.casserole dish.Covered. Microwaved for 5 minutes on high setting. Stirred with fork to fluff rice and cooked for 7 minutes on high. Served with roasted chicken. Yummy!

This was very good, but yet subtle in flavor. I did make it in the rice cooker just because I can never get rice to turn out otherwise, but I used all of the same ingredients except for the butter. I made this rice to go along with a chicken curry, and the subtleness was perfect for the bigger, bolder flavors of the curry. This rice would go along with pretty much any kind of entree, or if you wanted a light main dish, just add some chopped chicken to it. Thank you for the recipe, Norma!

Really Great!  I let it sit for about ten minutes with the cover on before serving it so more juices would get soaked up by the rice.  I will definately make it again!

Had to change it as well. Sauted hamburger, large garlic and onion. Added 2 TBS of Italian seasoning instead of the herbs and 4 tsp of beef boulion with 1 cup chicken broth and 3 cup water. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce either.

I read the reviews and made a few changes and it turned out so yummy.  My husband is not a big rice fan but he really loved this.  First of all, it was just the two of us so I cut the recipe in half.  I used half the amount of celery and added matchstick carrots. I added garlic with the onions, celery, carrots and rice.  Since I was serving it with the Pineapple Pork Chops, I used beef broth rather than chicken broth. I also increased the oregano and thyme by one half.  Finally I cooked it in the saucepan I browned the rice and vegetables for 20 minutes.  (Of course, without removing the lid during the cooking time.)  Then let it sit for 10 minutes.

We really enjoy this recipe. The only change I made was to use brown rice instead of white rice. This has significant changes to the cooking. The first time I made this recipe I used brown rice and baked it. It took almost 2 hours to bake. This last time I followed the recipe until the step to bake. Instead of baking I simmered the rice as directed on the package. Simmering the brown rice usually takes 45-50 minutes so there was plenty of time for all of the flavors to meld! Wonderful!

Fluffy, slightly buttery, combined with a balanced herb taste. Great stand alone eating rice. Everyone enjoyed it, and we will happily make it again.

This dish had a great, simple, comforting flavor, but it wasn't very exciting. It is definitely comfort food. The rice is tender and fluffy, with a chicken broth flavor that makes it yummy. It did lack pizazz, though...I thought maybe some buttered almonds would make it a bit better. Altogether, it is a good, comforting recipe...but I've had better, so I probably won't make it again. Thanks for sharing, though!!!

Got rave reviews from the in-laws and my husband said it was the best side dish ever.  Changes: added 2 large cloves of minced garlic to the skillet with celery and 2-1/2 T. of minced dried onion since I ran out of fresh onions.  Increased herbs to 1-1/2t. Used 1-1/2 T. of soup base for 4c. of hot water rather than chicken broth for a stronger flavor.  Fabulous!

We liked this rice!  Tonight we had it with shrimp scampi.  I use basmati rice because I prefer that kind.  A few tips...it's also tasty with chopped carrot bits in it and you can cook it on the stovetop!  (just cook it per rice directions).

This was so flavorful!  Next time, I might try cooking it in a rice cooker (instead of baking in oven) after the sauteing the rice and veggies.  Three young men, a young lady, and my husband thought this was great and all was gone by the end of the meal!

I did not have chicken broth in the house, so I used 4 packets of chicken bouillion with 4 cups of water.

This is my favorite rice recipe, hands down.  I've recently lost all my skills at stove top rice, for some reason. I'm not sure what happened. LOL.  Anyway, this baked rice has saved the day for me.  It can be baked simply with only rice and broth and it's comes out beatifully as well.

My first homemade pilaf, and very nice.  The way I made it was a 5, but required modifications.  Used margarine instead of butter to lower fat.  Added lots of crushed garlic to the simmered veggies just before baking.  Made veggie stock with cubes.  Next time I might add a few more veggies.  Mine was ready to eat in about 40 mins baked at 325, but the broth was warm when I poured over the rice.

Love this recipe.  The only change I made was substituted red bell pepper for the celery.  Rice has tons of flavor and came out perfect.

Waaaaay too much celery. Completely overpowering. Next time, a pinch of celery salt or 1 tsp of celery leaves will do you....or none. I will never make this again with celery (and I like celery).

It's great to have a rice dish to just put in the oven and forget about till it's serving time. The rice was done to perfection with the cooking time and temperature given. This rice should be paired with a highly flavoured dish as it is pretty bland on its own - not a bad thing necessarily. Made with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (perhaps that made it more bland) and veggie worcestershire to adapt to our mixed vegetarian/nonvegetarian household. Thanks!

It was my first attempt to make rice not from out of a box haha. Mine turned out creamy and very flavorful. I did add garlic. It did take longer than 50 minutes though probably about an hour and 15 minutes

I liked this rice once I finally got done.  I cooked it in the oven, per the recipe, for 50 min. and nothing happened.  I ended up cooking it in the microwave.  I'll try it again, but not in the oven.

I did not put celery in it and added red peppers.  I made a couple other changes but it was okay.  I think it need a little more flavor.  But i did not have some of the items so that is way i made some changes but next time i will see if it is better the way the recipe says!

Very good.  I did this on the stove instead of the oven, turned out great, I used 2 cups chicken stock and two cups of water with "better than bouillion" seasoning added to that, turned out very flavorful did not need to add anything else to it .  Even my 4 and 6 year olds loved it.

This dish did not have enough flavor for me.  However, after reading the reviews, I used Bemused 1 suggestion and used the beef broth and beef boulin cube instead of the chicken broth. I also added a package of frozen peas and I used whole grain brown rice. This way it's a keeper!

This rice pilaf was really nice and surprising easy to make.  I made a variation of it and my husband really liked it, and he's not much for rice.

I didn't have worchestershire sauce, but I did add soya sauce.  First I very finely diced sweet onion, celery, red pepper and mushrooms.  I sauteeds the first three with some butter and the rice, then added everything else as instructed.  I did my in a covered sautee pan on the stove for 20 minutes and it worked out great.  I only used half the butter called for and I found that I could probably halve that again.  I used low-sodium chicken broth and added a bit more salt to taste at the end, as well as some pepper.

I think this pilaf is a great way to use of left over veggies and maybe even chicken that you have a hand.  Just throw everything together!

This was outstanding!  Instead of 2 cups of white rice, I used 1 cup of parboiled converted rice (the kind we eat), 3/4 cup of brown whole wheat rice, and 1/4 cup of wild rice (I love wild rice!).  I had to cook it for twice as long, but it was amazing!  Made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I'll make it again and again!

This is delicious.  I made it several times.  I have even done it on the stove top by just sauteing the onion in the oil.  Then adding the rice to brown it.  Then I added the broth and covered.  It comes out very nicely.

This is an excellent side dish.  Very tasty.  I used a wild/brown rice mixture instead of white rice (healthier), threw in some sliced mushrooms and cooked on top of stove instead of in oven, but the results were great!  The next time I make it I'll add some dried cranberries to compliment the nuttiness of the wild rice.

Really good! Would give it 5 stars with my modifications: 1 tsp fresh thyme, 1 tsp fresh oregano, reduced the dried herbs to 1/2 tsp each. Reduced the soy sauce and worchestire sauce to 1/2 tsp each. Used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicked broth. I thought the recipe looked to salty, we loved it as described above.

This was very good.  I added a chopped cooked chicken breast and some frozen peas for a little more color.  Sprinkled Parmasan cheese over it at the end.  I really like the mix of flavors and will probably take this for lunch tomorrow with a side salad.  Not bad.
