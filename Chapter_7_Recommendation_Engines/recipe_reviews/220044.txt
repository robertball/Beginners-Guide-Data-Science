These were okay. Not great, not gross. You definitely need more cheese in it though because when you cook it the cheese seems to go away. They were also REALLY greasy so I'd recommend to put the meat on a paper towel after you cook it so it can catch a bit of the grease before you put it on puff pastry. Oh and don't use an actual egg, use an egg wash. Also don't dip it in ketchup unless you love meatloaf because for some reason that's what it tastes like with the addition of ketchup.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. The last few years, I find that I tend to rate a recipe based on whether or not my grandsons will eat it. I have four of them, all in single digits and they are the toughest audience on the planet. This recipe earned 5 stars!
