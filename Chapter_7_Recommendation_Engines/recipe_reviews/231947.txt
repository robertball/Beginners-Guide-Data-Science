I made this recipe as written (including fresh lemon juice and real maple syrup).  First off, the beef in the recipe turned out super tender, which is wonderful.  This stew was was my first time trying turnips and I would describe the taste to be like tangy potatoes.  This dish was interesting.  The mix of flavors is different than what I have had before.  While it is not my favorite dish, I liked it fine and my husband commented that he enjoyed it.  I think for me personally, I found the maple syrup to be slightly off putting.  So if I were to make this again, I would leave the syrup out.

I really liked this recipe. My 2 year old didn't :( but I was anticipating that. My man really loved it, he had 2 very large portions. I will be making this again. :) 

I didn't add the maple syrup, I thought that was weird and I'm Canadian! Instead I added an additional tbsp of sugar. Turnips were not in my grocery store, I don't think they were quite in season yet but I used 5 locally grown parsnips which are quite a bit alike.

Check out how mine turned out I posted a pic ;) I served mine with Great Grandma's Cucumber Salad (it's a family recipe of mine, I will share the recipe), and streamed carrots.

This stew is delicious.  It's very much along the lines of comfort food.  If you like turnip, you'll love this stew.
