I skipped the 3rd step entirely!  I used one box of thawed Birdseye's frozen raspberries, and they mashed quite simply during the heating / stirring process.  I found the consistency was just right, so there was no need to use a blender to puree & no need to do any straining through a sieve. (If  you don't have corn starch on hand, note that the same amount of potato starch worked just fine.) As a raspberry lover I will be making this sauce over and over again--it's yummy!

I've made this both ways, with and without the third step, and I found that the puree/strain results in a better sauce. It's not bad the other way, but it's better when the recipe is followed!

I also used frozen raspberries, skipped 3rd step and added a little more sugar to our taste. Thank You so much for posting this EASY and Delicious recipe. I wanted to bake a very special birthday cake and I used this raspberry sauce as a filling for a doulble layer chocolate cake, frosted with a butter cream cheese frosting, topped with a few whole raspberries and chocolate shavings. :)

I used frozen raspberries in this recipe and Truvia sweetener (six packets of Truvia is equal to 1/4 cup granulated sugar). I didn't bother to puree this sauce as I wanted a chunkier sauce to spoon over homemade waffles. Everything about this sauce was perfect. Not too sweet with a touch of tartness--it went perfectly with the waffles I made. Excellent!

A good, but rather ordinary raspberry sauce  I had hoped would be a little different with the addition of the orange juice.  It was not nearly sweet enough which is easy to fix, but the real disappointment was that the orange juice wasn't even noticeable. Still, it's a good, basic sauce.

Delish! I used frozen raspberries. I took the Philadelphia Ready-to-Eat cheesecake filling, stirred in Amaretto to taste, poured that in individual graham cracker shells, then put this sauce on top by putting it in a baggie, cutting the corner off and squeezing stripes on the cheesecake. VERY tasty!!!

Great recipe. I omitted the oj and added 1/3 of a cup of sugar instead of a 1/4 as I used fresh berries and they were a bit more tart. At first I was nervous when the sauce looked cloudy due to the starch, but I let it cook down, blended it and then strained it and it looked perfect. I even added 3 tablespoons of this to the "Best Lemonade Ever" recipe for berry lemonade and drizzled some over the white chocolate cheesecake recipe.

Frozen raspberries worked well in this. Thaw, strain the juice, and use it as part of the water it calls for. It came out beautifully. The tartness was the perfect complement to my cheesecake. It got raves!!

I didn't do the last instructions, because I liked the texture it was.  I used frozen (thawed) berries--worked great.  I might add a little more sugar next time, but it depends on your sweet tooth.

Wonderful sauce!  Just what I expected.  I pureed the sauce in a blender, but I did not strain it afterward.  Most of the seeds were chopped up in the blending process and the ones that remained were tiny enough.  Plus they gave the sauce an authentic look!  Not too sour as others mentioned.  Perfect to complement a sweet dessert.  I will be serving it with key lime pie. Thanks!  

UPDATE: Don't try to freeze this sauce. It will congeal and turn to mush when defrosted.

10/7/13----This recipe was the perfect complement to my cheesecake.  Rave reviews by all who ate it.  No cornstarch taste.  Rich & silky.  First time ever making it.  You only get one chance at a 1st impression so you must...PUREE & STRAIN THE SEEDS OUT!!  This is how I made it.

12oz frozen berries (Welch's no sugar added.) 
1/3 c sugar
3T Grand Marnier liqueur.  Most cooks off, but liquor is important to give it a longer shelf life in refrigerator.

2 tsp cornstarch mixed in just about 3/4 cup water.  This is all it takes to do the trick of thickening without turning it white.  1T-2T cornstarch is overkill for 12oz berries.  

MIx all together in pot.  Bring to boil, then simmer 5-8 min to desired consistency. 
Run through food processor.
STRAIN THROUGH A SIEVE!!!  STRAIN 2X.   I STRAINED OUT A GOOD 1/4 CUP OF RASPBERRY SEEDS!!  
Makes 1.25 to 1.5 cups.  
Divine.

Thank you Tattooed Chef!!

I made with a 12 oz. pkg of frozen raspberries that were sweetened, used 1/3 c. of sugar, 2 T. corn starch, 2 T. orange juice and only 1/2 c. water and cooked until thick.  I then used the regular strainer and strained out some of the seeds....not all just so it wasn't so seedy.  Served over cheesecake.  PERFECT!!

I was looking for a sauce to puddle under a slice of cheesecake, so I didn't want a thick sauce,I eliminated the cornstarch, used Grand Marnier instead of OJ, 1/4 c white karo in addition to the sugar, and only 1/2 c water. Cooked over med low heat, stirring , for 10 minutes.. I strained the seeds out , it came out exactly the consistency I needed without that gloppy, cornstarchy consistency..

This worked beautifully! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was the perfect topping for "Flourless Chocolate Cake I" from this site. I actually liked that it wasn't too sweet, the tartness balanced out the sweet richness of the cake.

Delicious, and fast and easy! I served this with 'Fudge Truffle Cheesecake' (from this site) for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I made a larger batch and had to use frozen raspberries, 2-12 oz. bags, and although I try to use a minimum of sugar they were quite tart so I had to add more to taste. Since I usually use frozen raspberries I may try using OJ concentrate next time to see if that sweetens it up some, but I think it's just the nature of raspberries, sometimes they're all sweet and sometimes they're more tart. I also skipped step 3 as other reviewers mentioned as I like the crunch of the berry seeds, even though I know it's not as classy. And, since it was all adults I added some Grand Mariner once it was cooled. Will be making this again.  Thanks!

I made about 1/3 of this recipe, because that’s all the berries I had.  I used my emersion blender which makes this very easy.  Forcing this through a fine sieve takes a little time, but produces a smooth sauce free of those pesky seeds!!  I thought the orange juice in this wasn’t even detectable in the finished sauce, so I’m not sure it’s necessary.  My berries may have been a little on the tart side, so I increased the amount of sugar to taste.  Once refrigerated, this sauce thickens and becomes gelatinous so I had to thin it with water to achieve a good sauce consistency.

Excellent base for a raspberry sauce. I found I only had a handful of raspberries on hand so I modified it a bit: (1) cup of red raspberries preserves, 1/4 cup of raspberries, 1 teaspoon of orange juice, 1/8 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of water. I ended up with a delicious...quick raspberry sauce that went well with a pound cake.

Easy recipe. I skipped third part, it worked, I did not want to wash too many dishes... After reading reviews I decided to put 2 tsp starch instead of 2 tbsp, it was enough. Some reviewers complained there wasn't enough OJ, and they couldn't taste any oranges, well I made cranberry sauce with OJ from this web it called for 1 cup of OJ, and people were complaining there was too much OJ and they didn't like orange flavor :o) you can not make everyone happy.... but I liked orange flavor in my cranberry sauce so in this recipe  I used 3/4 c OJ and 1/4 c water. I also added 1 tsp balsamic vinegar, don't need vanilla-shmanilla, just add vinegar,  it's yummy. And depending on your sugar preferences you may want to taste sauce while heating it, and add more sugar any time, no problem here. If you are making this for sweet cheesecake, 1/4-1/3 cup sugar will be just fine.

Needed a raspberry sauce for a vanilla cheesecake.  This one looked good.  I used a 12 oz bag of frozen raspberries instead of fresh & had apple juice instead of orange but it is great.  Made plenty for the cheesecake & some ice cream topping.  Thanks for sharing.  This one's a keeper.

I agree with the poster re: what does the orange juice add.  I also believe the amount of cornstarch is overkill.  Drop it to 1 tbls.

This was good, but it wasn't my favorite.  I made this when the first raspberries hit the stores, so maybe they weren't very flavorful raspberries.  I might try it again some other time.

Great consistency.  Not quite sweet enough for me, but I'm sure you have to vary the sugar with each batch based on how sweet your raspberries are.

This is a great, no fail recipe for a basic raspberry sauce.  It's a simple method, but fancy enough to make even novice cooks shine.  I've made the recipe as is with good results, but  if you've a little more experience, it's easily tweaked.  I substitute brown sugar and a bit of corn syrup to thicken it so I don't have to use so much corn starch.  As another reviewer stated, the cornstarch will mute the raspberry flavor a bit.  I also added about a quarter teaspoon of almond extract which really helps to pop the raspberry flavor.  To top it off, I add about 2 teaspoons of brandy at the end, which makes it nice and rich.  Great sauce for a chocolate torte!

I used frozen raspberries, used lemon juice rather than orange juice, and added a splash or kirsch. Yum!

It was okay...but I found it to be lacking in a bit of zip.  I ended up adding some dry white wine which helped but I don't think I'll make it again.

Maybe I didn't use enough raspberries but mine came out like jelly. It was really thick and the taste was very starchy. Definitely not my fave.

Sorry, didn't care for this one.  Just wasn't sweet enough for us.  I served it over cheesecake, but even with the sweetness of the cheesecake, the sauce was just too tart.

Tried it the first time and it was very good so gave 5 stars...second time I made it, I amped it up a bit...used a full pint of fresh raspberries, the zest and juice of 1/2 a fresh orange only a sprinkle of white sugar and a generous tbsp. of Grand Marnier ... let it simmer for 5 min on the stove and didn't bother with the cornstarch. The pectin in the raspberries was enough to thicken it to our liking.  Didn't bother whizzing or straining, either.  Wonderful base recipe!

I just tried this recipe to put over angel food cake.  It was very tasty.  I did not strain it because I didn't want to go to the trouble but no seeds would have been better.  I also wish I would have chilled the sauce before serving but for some recipes warm or room temp would have been good.  I have saved this recipe for future use.

I was expecting a rich raspberry flavor which this sauce did not provide. I even cooked it down until the volume was reduced by half. I think the cornstarch mutes the flavors. I suppose it's not bad if you want a quick thick sauce but next time, I'll do it the old fashioned way and just reduce it over time.

I looked for a real raspberry sauce recipe ... I am not a fan of frozen berries so this was perfect.  It was easy to make - I used lemon juice instead of orange ... (what I had on hand) and it worked out perfectly!  I plan to use the sauce with another terrific All Recipes recipe ... Aebleskivers.  Wish me luck! Pic coming soon! ;)

Used slightly less sugar, maybe 1.5 tbs cornstarch, and 2 tbs whisky (at end of cooking) in place of the orange juice.  Followed the rest of the directions and ended up with a LOVELY slightly tart raspberry-whisky sauce (whisky was very mild) that was the perfect compliment to the Flourless Chocolate Cake recipe.

This was good, but not as sweet as I was expecting. Maybe I am too used to raspberry jam or something. For what I was using it for, the recipe was too tart. If I had put it on something really rich, like cheesecake, it would have been fine as is, but I had to add more sugar.

I used 1/3 cup sugar and added a touch of orange oil to enhance the raspberries.  Using fresh is totally different than using frozen because of the water content of the latter.  This came out wonderfully and isn't too sweet.  Great Recipe.

I layered this sauce with chocolate cake and chocolate mousse, and it added just the amount of berry sweetness I wanted. The sauce does thicken a lot when it cools, so I won't simmer it quite as long the next tiem I make it.

I used two pints of berries instead of one, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Two tablespoons of cornstarch was a lot (given the small amount of liquid in the recipe) and even with the additional berries gave the sauce a slightly whitish tone. 

However, flavor was excellent and I'll use it again with a drop of red food coloring.

Classic, simple. I love adding a bit of orange rind with the juice, but this is just my preference. This is a really nice sauce on Pavlova with some whipped cream.

I loved this sauce!  I drizzled this over a cheesecake that I made.  It was the perfect finishing touch.

Yummy! I had blueberries, raspberries and blackberries that were at the end of their life. I doubled the recipe and got two more weeks out of my berries. The triple berry sauce on my mom's cream cheese pound cake was amazing. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I too used frozen raspberries so maybe that why the color was so suprising....very bright red/orange.  Made at a friends house who did not own a sieve so I strained through cheese cloth...was the perfect addition to the flourless chocolate cake

Very good.  I used frozen berries and skipped step 3 like others commented.  I didn't have oj so I used water and a tsp of orange extract.  I also cut back on the cornstarch because I wanted a thinner sauce.

I loved how tangy this was; sweet, but not too sweet. Drizzled it over vanilla bean creme brulee with delicious results. Instead of pureeing, though, I simply strained the sauce through a sieve and didn't encounter a single seed. Just perfect. Will totally make again.

When using fresh raspberries adjust the sweetness after straining, if necessary.  Mine was a bit too tart, but it was easy to fix with a bit of confectioner's sugar.  Great served over white chocolate cheesecake from this site.  Yummy!

Good flavor.  Used this as an under drizzle for a very rich, chocolate cake. Maybe too thick and the cornstarch made it too light in color. A little tweaking and it will be perfect!!!

Perfect!  Took out a little of the sugar because I wanted it a little more sour. (Used only about 2-3 tbl. total) and just eyeballed the OJ but this turned out amazing!!  I wanted it to have more tang than sweet because I served it with Chocolate Decadence Cake II, also from this site!  WHAT AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION!!  Thank you so much for posting, it was EXACTLY what I was looking for!

After reading the reviews I used 1/3 cup of sugar and a few more raspberries than called for.  I let mine lightly boil for 15 minutes or so to let it thicken nicely.  No need to blend!  I strained through my mesh sieve and it has set up nicely.  It will fill layers of a lemon cake tomorrow.  Still tart, but not bitter, as can happen with raspberries.

I used frozen raspberries and just cut the water amount almost in half (I didn't thaw the raspberries). Served it over vanilla cake and everyone loved it. Not too sweet, just perfect.

Excellent and easy!!! Skipped the orange juice as hubby not a fan of it and increased the sugar a bit to about 1/2 cup. Excellent! Great consistency, did not strain or need to use blender of any kind :)

First time making this, and it was so easy! I used a veggie chopper for the raspberries, and it almost puraed them.Which made it easy to cook. After iI added the corn starch, it turned a light red and iI thought I messed up... But I didn't. It gets darker as it cooks. After it was done and cooled, I tasted it, and it was amazing! I left the berries chunky, and it was really good.
This is for sure my go to and only raspberry sauce recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!!! I love it.

It was cloudy, gloopy, and not at all appetizing.  I ended up serving it anyway because I had no more raspberries.

We made it with and without pureeing the sauce.  It was better without puree.  We should've though strained the seeds.  Otherwise great recipe.  Easy to use for a novice like me.

I made a few changes based on ingredients I had at the time. First off I did half and half fresh raspberries and blackberries, and I changed the orange juice for fresh lime juice as I had limes that needed to be used. Used approximately 1 lime to get the amount needed. and lastly I added a few leaves of fresh mint from my garden as lots of people were saying this was a little plain and it was the main part to my dessert so I wanted it to stand out. Needed to add extra sugar due to the lime juice and fresh berries. I did step 3 as I had to get rid of pits and mint slivers. I put it over vanilla ice-cream with some fresh raspberries and blackberries. My husband and I loved it :) will definitely make again

I used this as a filling for crepes and it was great.  I didn't bother to strain the berries and the seeds didn't bother a bit.   I just topped the crepe with a spot of whipped cream and then two fresh raspberries.

I like this recipe the way it is published, but prefer it replacing half of the liquid with OJ, increasing the sugar a bit and skipping the 3rd step as others did (we like the texture).  I will definitely use it again.

I think it needs more sugar- not quite sweet enough for my taste.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen berries. The blending and straining steps are really worth it!

I modified it to include chocolate - my favorite with raspberries.  I used 1 cup raspberry preserves, 3-4 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp Sour Puss Raspberry Liqueur, 1 tbsp corn starch & 1 cup water.  As this was heating up, I decided to make it more decadent, and added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, which melted into the mixture.  I brought it to a low boil, turned it down, then added 1 tbsp Amaretto (almond liqueur).  WOW.  I plan to serve this sauce over a lemon chiffon cake for Easter, and over ice-cream.  NOTE:  Dark chocolate hides the cloudiness of the corn starch; you could use white chocolate instead and this would still be fantastic.

delicious and easy to make. I skipped the 3rd step as others have done and it was very tasty. I used frozen raspberries and only added 1/4 c of sugar.  The raspberries were from our garden so maybe that's why it was extra yummy?! ;-)  will definitely make again.

I used frozen raspberries.  Although I didn't use the boat motor, I found I didn't need to because the raspberries broke down well since the frozen berries went in as-is.  I did strain to remove the seeds.  Thank you for this recipe, very tasty for my chocolate cheescake.

Sorry, I did not like this recipe. It was fine day 1 but thickened up to jam consistancy.

Not a bad sauce and it went over well with those that had it on the Mexican Flan I made from this site.  Personally didn't care for an aftertaste that I could taste. I'm wondering if it is from the seeds that went through the blender? If I use this sauce again, I don't think I'll put it through the blender.

I made this to serve with Flourless Chocolate Cake from this site.  Next time I would strain the sauce, since I didn't like the texture of the seeds.  Flavor was good though.

This turned out amazingly ! I used frozen berries, apple juice(all I had on hand), 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup sugar. I also strained this and the color is beautiful ! I made to drizzle on top of a lemon cake

Delicious!  Always read others' reviews to get the most out of these recipes.  I added a little extra sugar (1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup) and used lime juice instead of orange juice, since I didn't have any orange juice in the house.  I did the 3rd step, and it is a nice, smooth sauce.  If you don't mind the seeds, it's fine without the 3rd step, but I think it's better if you do it.  Served it with chocolate molten lava cakes for Valentine's Day.  I will definitely make this again!

Doesn't get much better (or easier) than this... 
My modification was that I was out of oj so I used some grape juice, I think any acidic juice would work and I threw in 1/4 cup of organic strawberry jam.  I put it on a cheese cake, they family gobbled it up!

Excellent, simple sauce!  As written, the sauce turns out a bit on the tart side.  This works well for me as I am usually serving it with something ultra sweet.  Sometimes I add a bit more orange juice or include some orange zest for extra flavor.  Stick with fresh berries for sure!

Very tasty! I used the juice from 1 large navel orange. I skipped step 3 because I enjoy the seeds. I used this sauce as an accent to a flourless chocolate cake. Chocolate and raspberries are a fantastic combination. This sauce does really thicken up quite a bit. I did have to microwave it a little bit to thin it out when I was ready to use it.   I also used a spoonful of the raspberry sauce with a serving of vanilla yogurt. It was yummy!

This is one of the best sauces I have ever made. Warm, it is a beautiful consistency for ice cream or drizzling over a dessert and cold, it is the most fantastic filling for a chocolate layer cake that you could ever imagine. I have made it with both raspberries alone, and combined raspberries and blackberries. While some skip the third step, it really is worth the time, and yields a velvety smooth sauce that is just perfection. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Absolutely fabulous!!! I've done this with both lemon and orange juice and it's delicious both ways, it just depends on what I have on hand when making it (I tend to ALWAYS have lemon juice on hand, but there have been times the kids drink up the last of the OJ before I get to it). Thanks for sharing this!!!

I had a pint of fresh black raspberries. I followed the recipe, except omitted the orange juice (didn't have any). In it's place I used 1 tbsp of peach schnapps.  Yum, yum, yum!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Perfect Raspberry Sauce. I couldn't taste the orange at all but also didn't miss it. Served this with Raspberry Angel Cake (from this site) and it was an excellent dessert. I will use this one a lot this summer. Thanks for sharing!

I skipped the 3rd step too, but I didnt need to puree, as it broke down just fine while cooking, but did run it through sieve. I also added 1/3 cup of sugar.  I didnt have any orange juice on hand this time, and used Grapefruit juice which added a great contrast to the Raspberries... it was perfect served over the darkest chocolate cake I make.  YUMMY!

I cut this recipe in half and I was so busy reading the reviews that I added a half a cup of sugar, plus a little before realizing I had lost my mind and added way more than the called for 2 tbsp. Luckily the reviews said that it wasn't sweet enough, but I cut that extra sugar with Chambord and lemon juice to taste. Great recipe! And very forgiving. ;)

This recipe was very easy to follow and the sauce was nice.  I was looking for a little more raspberry flavor, so next time I will add more of them.  The consistency was exactly what I wanted.

This was very good.  I also didn't puree or strain.  I also added more fresh raspberries after it was cooled.  I served it over cheesecake.  YUM!

It's really yummy sauce.  Especially on ice cream and cheesecake.  I made a few adjustments though.  I used frozen raspberries.  I cut the cornstarch in half, which was fine, but next time I'll leave it out altogether.  It was a little thick, and I swear I can taste it.  I also used pure lime juice instead of orange juice, which was AMAZING!  I did add a little more sugar to cut the sour of the lime juice, though.  I ended up just eating the sauce off my cheesecake, because I loved it so much! Everybody loved it.

I had to add about an extra 1/4 cup of sugar because it was too sour.  I skipped the puree step as we like some texture.  We'll serve it over Chantal's NewYork Cheesecake (also on this site).

So delicious and easy to make except for the process of straining the seeds :)  Impressive and an absolutely perfect quick dessert served over frozen yogurt and garnished with a sprig of fresh mint.

This was so good! I was out of oranges and substituted two teaspoons of Orange extract. That added a delicious dimension. I was out of corn starch so substituted corn syrup (about 1\2 cup and 1\2 cup less water. I still added the sugar to make it sweet enough for our taste. I served this without straining because my red raspberries had no seeds. This was lovely over vanilla gelato. Thanks for this keeper recipe!

I used frozen black raspberries from my yard. I reduced the sugar because I like it a little more on the tart side. Instead of water I used Triple Sec and pink grapefruit juice because I didn’t have OJ. A little thick after cooking, so I thinned it with a couple of Tbls of Triple Sec. Plan on serving this over black raspberry ice cream.

No orange juice so used 1 tbsp lemon juice - great taste. Did not blend sauce. Garnished with fresh raspberries. Topped my diabetic crustless cheesecake (Mr Food’s diabetic cookbook). Beautiful presentation !

My daughter made a cheesecake and I used this recipe for the sauce. BIG HIT!! In fact, when we were finished our slices of cheesecake, my daughters made me get them bowls of this sauce to eat on its own. The orange juice adds just enough tart. I would suggest not using quite as much cornstarch. It gets really thick once it cools. Taste is phenomenal.

Have made several times.  So easy and quick.  Makes quite a bit.  I don't use the entire amount of sugar that recipe calls for.  I think sugar can (and should) absolutely be done to taste.  You can always add more, but can't take it out if too sweet.  Just sayin' :-)  Goes fantastic with dark chocolate (as in a "mousse" cake)

This is an excellent recipe though instead of using orange juice use fresh squeezed lemon juice instead!  Rose Levy Beranbaum, the author of The Cake Bible, observed that raspberry loves lemon.  I doubled the recipe and added about 1/2 cup of frozen wild blueberries as well -- this gives the flavor a bit of depth and intensifies the color.  It's a fantastic sauce and I served it with lemon buttermilk pound cake.  Got rave reviews from my friends!

It tasted ok, but the cornstarch made the sauce too thick and gave it a weird cloudy pink color.  Not  what I was imagining.  I pureed it in the blender, but it was so thick, it wouldn't go through my strainer!  So, I gave up and just left the seeds in.  If I tried this again, I would leave out the cornstarch and maybe reduce the sugar.

Wow this is good!  I used 1/3 cup of sugar and 3 TB orange juice.  You do need to strain for best results.  Served over Flourless Chocolate Cake 1 and everyone raved.

This was perfect, easy to make, fresh tasting.  I halved the recipe because I only had a 1/2 pint of raspberries.  I didn't blend as this was not necessary, I strained it, then added about 1/2 tsp of orange zest.

Ok, so I made this sauce to go with NY style cheesecake, but I pureed canned peaches and then blended that, and the sauce together, and then strained it.  Its silky smooth and so fresh tasting!

Add amaretto after it's done for an insanely good variation (not my idea but I can vouch for it)! Holy GOD! This is perfect. I'm going to make a cheesecake with this swirled in.

I absolutely cheated on this recipe and I'm glad I did. Since I didn't have an entire pint of fresh raspberries, I made up the difference with raspberry preserves. This gave the sauce the exact kick of sweetness it needed. It's perfect for drizzling over cheesecake or ice cream or adding it to smoothies.

This was the first time I make raspberry sauce, and I was pleased with it.  Was delicious over my sweet cream/strawberries crepes! I used fresh squized orange juice,  and all purpose flour instead of cornstarch since I didn't have any.

I added more sugar plus a little salt to improve sweetness.  I used 3/4 as much water as given in recipe so it would be thicker.

I made it just the way it was described here, and love it! My husband adores it on vanilla ice cream. I'm waiting to adorn some dark chocolate mousse with it. 

Some may prefer it a bit sweeter, but we love it a little tart.

I made it but with cranberry juice and slightly less sugar. I like it more tart than sweet since it will be on top of something else that is already sweet.  Everyone loves it.

This was very good. I covered a slice of cake in it. I agree with others that you couldn't really taste the orange juice, and I think make a splash of lemon juice would've been a nice addition. Still it was excellent I would recommend this. I used fresh raspberries and did keep the third step.

1.  I used a 12oz bag of frozen sweetened raspberries (couldn't  find unsweetened and store was out of fresh)

2.  Although my raspberries were pre-sweetened, I did end up using the full 1/4 cup of sugar called for in the recipe.  I still could taste a hue of tartness in the berries, which I prefer so it's not too sweet.

3.  Increased orange juice to 1/4 cup
4.  Decreased the cornstarch to 1 Tablespoon
5.  Decreased the water to 1/2 cup

Additional notes...
*  As the recipe states, the sauce really does thicken as it cools.  Don't be surprised if the sauce still appears fairly thin when it's finished cooking.
**  I didn't have a fine sieve to strain out the seeds.  Use of an immersion blender did help.  Perhaps next time I'll try in my Vitamix blender.

I made this to go on top of the vanilla bean cheesecake (also from this site) and it was perfect. Just tart enough to off the sweetness of the cheesecake.  It got rave reviews.

I didn't have orange juice, so used a touch of orange extract. I used an immersion blender to smooth it out, I didn't want to push it through a sieve. This was delicious! Used as a coulee to fill cupcakes ??

I used apple cider because my family polished off our  OJ.  I used an entire bag of frozen raspberries, 3 Tsp. of corn starch,  and.... I'm not sure if I added the water or not.  If I did, it was only 1 cup.  I did not blend it since it was for pancakes.  Amazing!

I had a 6 oz container of fresh berries. I used 1/4 c because some reviewers were concerned about the sweetness. It still had a  kick of tart, I also didn't have any orange juice on hand, so I used lemon. But this recipe is a great base for the raspberry sauce. It didn't take long at all to get to the boiling point on 5 (electric oven), used a small stainless steel pot. They berries broke up very easily during the stirring process. there was really no need for the blender (the next time I won't blend. It really just made it frothy)...I did have to strain mine, because even though I put in a blender (BELLA) the  seeds weren't small enough to be ignored. It will be used as a raspberry filling for dual flavored cupcakes (1/2 choc 1/2 white). I haven't figured out my frosting yet, but I'm thinking either salted biscoff buttercream or vanilla buttercream, or a lemon buttercream. SO many flavors to choose from!

Lovely sauce. Used a bag of frozen rasp instead and didn't have to blend at the end. Also, oranges were too high priced so I used 2 tbsp of jarred orange peel in water to add orange aroma. Will be drizzling over a brownie cake. So yummy and not too sweet. If your strainer is too little like mine it will take an hour to strain and FYI don't wear white. :p /noob

Really good basic recipe. I used raspberries from my garden, and started with 1/4 cup of sugar. Tasted partway through, and added an additional 1/4 cup, so a total of 1/2 cup. I also added a half teaspoon both grated orange and lemon peel.  I took the extra bit of time to strain the seeds, as I wanted a smooth product. Very tasty over ice cream.

I followed advice of several reviewers and skipped step 3 - since I used frozen berries I think this worked really well.  Also used Sarah Jo's idea of substituting 6 packets of Truvia for the sugar. This sauce is a great compliment to a flourless chocolate cake I make - it's upper rich and needs something a little tart as a contrast.

I used 6oz FRESH raspberries, 2 tbsp. Trop 50 OJ, 1/4 cup sugar along with 1 tbsp. corn starch whisked into water. Absolutely delicious. Here I have it served on a slice of Fresh Raspberry Cream Cheese pie. YUM!

Substituted frozen 3-berry blend (raspberry, blueberry, blackberry) and omitted oj because I did not have any at home, increased sugar to 1/3 cup, and skipped third step. Delicious!

I think this is a great recipe. I used lemon juice instead of orange juice and it worked pretty good! Considering the cornstarch, it's not as thick as I expected, but that's ok. Altogether, it tasted good, though, and that's all that matters.

More like 4.5 stars. Served over angel food cake. I used fresh raspberries from the farmer's market and skipped step 3. While it had a lot of seeds, it didn't bother me. I used 4T of flour to thicken mine. That was probably a little too much flour. Will try less next time.

We didn't even neet to blend it… just strained out the seeds for a beautiful pink sauce… I don't even really like raspberries and thought this was great...

I strained the raspberries after washing. I found that shaking the strainer works well for working the juice through and leaving the seeds. I used no OJ, more sugar for fresh raspberries, and less water. The raspberry glaze is wonderful on raspberry swirl cheesecake!

This was great! I used frozen strawberries and lemon juice rather than fresh raspberries and orange juice. I didn't blend it up, just chopped at the strawberries a bit while they were simmering. I poured over my pancakes, it was quick, easy and delish!

I first started making this sauce last berry season.  I just LOVE it !  Totally skipped the final step just because it was sooo good just the way it was !  I did add just a tad more cornstarch the second time around making - 1/2 tsp., and it was just awesome for toast !  Great recipe and will continue to use !  Going to experiment with this and try with my rhubarb soon !

I made this, didn't think it was anything special but it will pass. Maybe the orange juice flavor will come out after it has married for awhile. I did strain mine as I don't like the seeds in the sauce. Eating fresh raspberries are fine with the seeds but don't like them in my sauce. Very pretty and it will enhance my pound cake.

Easy, fast...and very good.  That hits 5 stars for me!  Make sure you strain it. I didn't, and I wish I had.  It would have been restaurant quality had I done so.

I just got done making this sauce and it is wonderful! I used fresh raspberries and did not need to blend it but I did pour it through a mesh strainer while still warm. It  couldn't have been easier. I'm going to serve it with Chantal's New York cheesecake from this site. Thanks for the great recipe!

I substituted fresh squeezed lime juice for the orange, as I wanted the sharpness and acidity, to pair with a rich, dark chocolate. When I blended it, I added a leaf of mint for a little bit of elevation. Turned out amazing, and was the best pair with the dark chocolate pave I had made.

I tried this recipe, only I used white wine instead of orange juice. I also skipped pureeing it. I didn't even strain it. It was amazing! I made it with crepes and spread it on arabic bread and cream cheese. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!

I boil the berries and juice first, strain the seeds out and then return to the pot to boil with the sugar. (I use coconut palm sugar), then add the cornstarch step.

I "eyeballed" all measurements and adjusted to my taste. I also strained the sauce before I thickened it. Cant wait to put it on the cheesecake I just made!

Update... I made it again last night to serve with key lime pie.  Once again, it turned out great.  I would not skip the straining or you will end up with a lot of raspberry seeds!

Simple to make and very good. I used frozen raspberries but didn't add the orange juice. Could have used a little more sugar (berries were pretty tart), but I was going to serve it as a topping for a lemon pudding cake and thought the tartness of the sauce would go well with the cake. It did. I'm saving this one to my recipe box and will use again. Thanks!

I liked that this was pretty simple to make. I ended up adding slightly more sugar than the recipe called for, probably closer to 1/3 cup than a 1/4 cup, and I also skipped step 3 entirely (as another reviewer had mentioned). Ended up with a light sauce with a nice balance of sweet and tart. I made individual size soft center dark chocolate cakes and used this sauce on top of them with fresh raspberries on the side. Will use this one again!

Great sauce.  I did strain it through, but I did not blend it.  I also didn't have oj, so I used Grand Marnier.  Don't know if it added anything, but it sounds good.  ; )

Good flavor. Next time I will try it with less cornstarch and less water for a richer flavor.

Very easy and delicious!  I served this with spiced poached pears and garnished with a mint leaf for a beautiful finish to an elegant Christmas dinner.  The extra sauce was great on vanilla ice cream!

This was pretty good. I had to add more sugar tho. wasn't sweet enough. But that could have been my raspberries.

This was really delicious! I added quite a bit more sugar because my raspberries were really tart.  I used this on a layered chocolate cake and it got rave reviews from the family.  My mother-in-law said when the cake was gone she was just going to drink the rest of the raspberry sauce! I pureed my sauce but did not strain it and it turned out very nice.

Very nice!  I used this over cheesecake, and it was lovely.  I also used the frozen raspberries, and simply garnished the cheesecake slices with fresh ones.  I would actually make less of it next time -- it was about 2x as much as you'd need for a cheesecake, and I have no idea what to do with the rest!  I do agree it is not very sweet, but the cheesecake took care of that, so the balance was nice.  Will definitely make it again though -- thanks for sharing!
