This recipe was amazing! I was a little nervous about making mussels as I'd never made them before, but this recipe was so easy. I bought live mussels that were already debearded. My boyfriend is from Cape Breton NS and had lots of good advice for making mussels. Soak them in fresh water for a half hour and they'll filter out most of the sand. Throw out any mussels that don't close up tight after being soaked, and after steaming, throw out any that don't open. This made a great romantic Valentine's Day meal with a few glasses of wine and some French bread!

This recipe was quick and easy to make but it was missing just one thing.  Flavour.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe, for us, is absolutely awesome, since we eat lots of seafood and shellfish. I have prepared it just once, but have wanted it every day since.  It is very simple to prepare, and it tastes like you labored for hours in the kitchen.  It's so good that I'm going to show our friend, a restaurant owner, how to prepare this recipe.  He might even put it on the menu.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Great recipe -- very easy and incredibly flavorful. This will become part of our rotation.

I doubled the garlic and substituted 1/2 cup of chicken broth for some of the wine. I used Pino Grigio.  I sauteed the onion and garlic until soft, then added the other ingredients and simmered on low to medium heat for about ten minutes before adding the mussels.

One other tip. We buy mussels by weight, not volume. We find that 3/4 pound per person is a generous portion.

Bon appetit!

Really good. I, as well, was afraid the wine might over-power the mussels so I used half wine, half broth (hot water and chicken bullion). Also, I didn't have thyme, but I did add some lemon juice, extra onion and garlic, and Emeril's Italian Essence. Also, SHRIMP! My husband and I thought this recipe was very flavorful. Served over whole wheat fettuccine. Would definitely make again.

This is such a great recipe that it still tasted really good after I overcooked it!  The wine, thyme and onions made a fantastic combination.  I definatly suggest not multi-tasking while making this dish - it cooks fast.  Enjoy, we did!

My fresh parsley had gone bad so I subbed dried (not preferred in this dish but it was all I had) but that was the only change I made to start with. It was good but I felt it needed something so I sprinkled some grated parmesan over it, sliced up a few cherry tomatoes, and lastly squeezed fresh lemon over the top. As written I give it 4 stars, my additions bumped it to 5 stars. Thanks for sharing Christine!

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed was instead of onion, I used shallots. My son and I ate the lot, and mopped out the pan with crusty bread. This one is a definite make again!

Yum Yum Yum!  I just finished eating this and I feel compelled to review it immediately!  This was delicious!  I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand:  I added 8 oz. of mushrooms because they really needed to be used up and cooked them with the onion.  I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used 1 Tablespoon of dried.  I also used half chicken broth and half white wine because I was afraid of the wine being a little overpowering, I may try it with only wine next time though because it didn't overpower the flavor at all this time around!  Oh, I also added about 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit.

very good, I will change just a bit next time and add more garlic and cook the wine/garlic for at least 45 minutes so there is more flavor.

Added salt, white pepper, fresh parmesan, and a dash of cayenne before i poured on the mussels (or it would have been pretty bland). That made it perfect!

This recipe was very clear to follow and was delicious. I added mushrooms and used fresh thyme.
This was the first time I cooked mussels.

The recipe says to steam for 4 minutes and warns against overcooking.  It actually took more like ten minutes, and we had to stir the mussels around so that ones on top got cooked, too.  Otherwise, a very simple and tasty recipe.

Decent recipe.  However, the amount of wine can be reduced to one cup and I would add two teaspoons of salt.  The recipe can be improved by grating fresh parmesan cheese over each serving.

Only one of my children likes mussels, and even I am not crazy about them, but I made it for dinner at my son request anyway.  They were gone in minutes, and the next time I had to double up.  Still no leftovers.  This is now one of our favorite meals

Pretty good. My first attempt with Mussels. Because of my location I was using frozen ones, that I cooked up and added at the last minute so I had to adjust the cooking somewhat. I also added red pepper and mushrooms to the recipe. I found it to loose, would prefer a thicker sauce, but the taste was still very good!

Great recipe. I made this without the pasta and served as an appetizer. It's even easier to use the mussels on the half shell and just bake for 10 minutes with the sauce on top. Delicious!

This was AWESOME! I didn't have white wine but I did have lobster broth so I used that. I could've drank the broth after the mussels were gone.

eh, first time. bugger. sorry bout that previous box.  Okay the review, just made it and using live kinkawooka musssels.  Quality stuff.  The mussels released too much seawater (being live after all) which made the broth too salty,  Also, I did not strain the solids, i mean, they apart from the  mussels both flavour the mussels and absorb the flavour of the other herbs and the mussels so after the mussels and my hand made bronzed pasta, they were divine - the crunch of fragrant onion, divine.  So a great recipe but maybe i might try using unsalted butter next time or less mussels (used a Kg i mean what is a quart ? So i probably also used way too many mussels which i suppose made the sauce way too salty (back tracking here but there must be a reason it was too salty and i suppose that make the most sense, but the mussels were sooo yuummmyyy).

Excellent recipe that was full of flavor and super easy to put together. A great weeknight dinner especially paired with a salad. I added a bit more garlic because we all love garlic! I used a shallot instead of the onion because that's what I had. I added one can of chopped roma tomatoes with juice and used less wine. The whole family loved it and I will certainly make it again.

I love this recipe!  I've been making this for about 20 years. I use olive oil instead of butter for a bit different flavor. I've also used small clams which is great also.

Was really tasty and surprisingly easy. Great flavor for the sauce. One thing, the directions say 4 quarts of oysters. The meat department thought I was crazy. Apparently that's a lot of oysters for four people. 1 1/2 pounds was enough for four. I even had to cook that in two batches. Did not have a big enough pan!

The recipe lacks salt.  With a few tweaks it can be improved:
1. Salt the broth to taste before you add the mussels
2. Reduce the broth after straining it out by at least 1/3

I'm never sure what to add to frozen mussels and pasta but this is a good start.  Was short on the white wine but next time will use the full amount, plus I think the suggestions to include sundried tomatoes and lemon juice sounds good.

I liked this recipe.  I made a smaller portion, used whole wheat spaghetti, dried parsley, and thawed frozen New Zealand mussels as they were all I had on hand, and it still turned out decent.  Not quite as good the mussel dishes I have eaten in restaurants, but it still s decent!

This was an amazing and easy recipe!  We are talking dinner party food, on a gentle budget, with Food Network results.  I didn't change a thing.  Yum!

Very tasty broth and mussels were perfectly cooked when directions were followed. Will make again.
