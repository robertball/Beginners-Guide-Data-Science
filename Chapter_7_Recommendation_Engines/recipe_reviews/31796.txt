Good plain food!  Only change I made was in technique.  I sauteed the thinly sliced kielbasa in a little oil til it was nicely browned.  Then taking a slotted spoon I removed to a warm platter while I prepared rest of meal.  Returned sausage to main pan for last ten minutes of cooking.  This way the potatoes and onion soaked up the flavor from the sausage oil.  And I was able to limit oil use to a little over 2 tablespoons.  Will prepare this again and again during the cold winter months.  Very economical too!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was good and easy to make too. Definitely don't need anywhere NEAR 1/4 cup of cooking oil though....I used a couple tablespoons and it was still very greasy.  It would help to brown the kielbasa in a separate skillet & then drain on paper towels.  I used red potatoes and left the skins on which gave it a good flavor. Next time I'll definitely use fresh garlic as opposed to garlic powder.

VERY GOOD! I made this for lunch today...easy but filling meal! First, I cooked the cubed potatoes in the microwave for apprx 8 min to speed up the process and then I took MC_MA's advice...cut that oil down to 2 TBLS.  I also added 1 cup chopped broccoli (I bought one of those 3 lbs bags of pre-chopped broccoli and now I'm trying to use it up in almost every recipe I deem tasty) as well as 1/2c chopped celery. Also, I used the polska kielbasa...HMMMMM.  The flavors from the kielbasa really hype up the meal.  I'm the only one in my family that melted some sharp cheddar cheese over my bowl but EVERYONE agreed this was an excellent tasting meal.  I could only do what Christopher's Grandma said: "EAT MORE!"  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We love this recipe, but I did alter it a little.  I parboiled the potatoes, used red bell peppers, cut down on the oil.  I coarsely chopped and steamed 1/2 head of cabbage until it was just slightly crunchy and tossed it with the other ingredients at the end.

Sooooo easy.  I actually peaked the kids' interest with this one, because it smelled soooo good.  BUT, there was entirely way to much oil.  My suggestion is to start out with a tbsp. or two, and add everything to the pan at the same time, that way the sausage will add it's share of fat (even the light sausage had plenty).  I did it as the recipe stated & my potatoes started to get mushy by the time I added the sausage, and then it kinda got greasy.  My husband suggested the addition of sauerkraut next time.  Good dish, (the kids even ate it), thanks Christopher!

YIKES!!! The fat, cholesterol & sodium content was way to high!! Substituted the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil to sunflower oil, and only used 1/3 cup measurement! Kielbasa is not the best healthy choice so I picked chicken instead :) You can get just as much protein from chicken!

Delicious!! This is a good, quick and hearty meal made in just one pan. Left overs (if you have any) can be used the next morning in an omelet.  We liked that, too :)

This recipe was ok....I love polish sausage and I love potatoes...but this just didn't do it for me. Extreemly toooooooo greasy! Would cut down the oil but then the potatoes would stick more than they already did. Maybe cook the sausage first then the potatoes.

I don't like peppers so I left this alone, but my it's one of my husband's new favorites!  We used some red and some green peppers to make it more colorful, yellow onion, and red potatoes.  We also tried to make it more healthy by using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and reduced-fat brats instead of kielbasa (sliced thin so it still looks like you have lots of meat).  We also left it uncovered and only cooked for about 15 minutes total to maintain some crispness to the veggies.  Even with all our minor changes, the basic recipe is still the same, and it's a winner!

Yum!  I would cut the salt in half next time. The sausage has enough salt on it's own.  Potatoes are fantastic!

I made this for dinner last night and it brought back to me memories of my days as young Chef on the prowl around Europe where this and Polish Bigos were culinary attractions in the kitchens of the Victoria Hotel in Warsaw and in Pope John's favourite restaurant of the square in Krakow, where I learned that his favourite kielbasa was made by a Polish butcher in Hamilton, Ontario of all places. I enjoyed the recipe although I admit that I studded the sausage with garlic cloves and Polish style left the poatoes in their jackets.Even better when served with dollops of sauerkraut.

So delicious. I sliced my potatoes about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick and leave the red skins on.  I used an electric frying pan and used 1 teaspoon canola oil and about 1/2 cup water. I put the lid on and let it cook til Ican just stick a fork through.  Then I added bell pepper and onion.  Put the lid on and let cooked just a few minutes.  THEN I threw the sausage on top.  For seasoning I used cajun seasoning and a bit of soy sauce.  We like for it to have some browned places on the potatoes so the last few minutes I take the lid off.  Usually have some type crusty bread and green beans.  Oh...and don't forget to put a little wine in it when you start the potatoes.  Seasoned black pepper is good too.  I sometimes use green onions.

I've noticed that several reviews have commented that 1/4 cup of oil is way too much.I agree.The kielbasa will also produce some fat/oil.I would use any kind of potatoes that I have at the time and I would wash them and leave them unpeeled.I would also put the peppers in at the same time as the onions and potatoes so they will soften a little.However,I do like my peppers and onions with a little crunch to them.I  would possibly also add some cut up cabbage to this dish,not sauerkraut just raw cabbage.Of course dishes like this can have other items added such as diced carrots,one cup of whole kernel corn,as well as other items.I have made a variation of this by using sauerkraut instead of potatoes and leaving out the carrots and corn but keeping in the peppers and onions.This is a great dish,thanks for posting.

This turned out great! I substituted 8 red potatoes for the 4 regular potatoes and otherwise followed the directions.  The only things I would do differently next time are brown the sausage first so I could cook the potatoes and onions in the sausage grease instead of using so much oil and cut the onions a little larger because they melted away to almost nothing

I use same ingredients, but add sliced carrots. I toss everything in a bowl add a little olive oil and sprinkle Italian seasonings over all and toss together. I put all in foillined pan, and close foil on top. Roast at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Turn up the oven to 425 degrees, open foil and roast another 15 minutes.

For the people who thought it was unhealthy, just substitute turkey kielbasa (tastes exactly the same), and use 2 Tablespoons of canola oil. And if you're worried about salt, leave it out. Mine was definitely not greasy. It was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe, Chris!! I'll be making this frequently!

This recipe gets 5 stars from me because it was delicious and quick and easy.  I followed a few suggestions from others and of course cut down on the oil and used olive oil instead.  I browned the kielbasa first, took it out and started cooking the potatoes.  Then added the onions and peppers.  I used paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I didnt have onion powder so I just left it out.  My 10 year old ate the whole thing and loved it and so did my husband!  I could definitely see this recipe being used for breakfast or brunch to, just throw a fried egg on top and it would be fabulous.  This is a keeper.

This was really tasty.  I pan fried the Turkey Kielbasa in a tbls bacon fat and a little olive oil, removed kielbasa from pan, added a bit more olive oil and tossed in the onions, potatoes and green peppers.  Cooked med-low for approx 15 mins then deglazed pan with a 1/2 c. dark ale covered and simmered another 10 mins.  Quick & easy, very hearty and filling on a rainy fall evening.  Mr.had a 2nd serving, will make again.  Thanks for another keeper.

Very tasty!  I browned the sausage first and then used the oils from that to cook everything else.  Next time I will cut my taters smaller so it all cooks a bit faster.  But quite filling and everyone enjoyed!

I thought this would be bland, but it was actually pretty good. I used 3 Tablespoons of olive oil, and frozen french-style green beans instead of the bell pepper. The husband thought this would be really good as a breakfast dish, with melted cheese and a fried egg on top.

After learning the first time around, we elected to pan fry the meat separately from the rest of the meal.  Then add once the potatoes are ready.  This will avoid over cooking the potatoes with the lid on which will soften the potatoes too much.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I enjoyed it very much! Fast and easy one pot meal.  The flavors were great.  Used a little olive oil instead of vegtable oil.  Wonderful recipe and will make again!!!

i've made a fry-up like this for decades but never thought to season beyond salt and pepper.  i use less potato, uually leftover baked potatoes.  i don't usually use that much fat and i use butter.  when it is just done i break in 4 eggs or so and scramble it up.  i think i've used almost every kind of sausage excep italian.  really like the turkey smoked sausage.

Very Good.I'll make them again, but next time, i'll put LESS oil. I had to drain oil after cooking the vegies and even patted with papertowl over those vegis, trying to get more oil from them. Then I added Kielbasa and i got more oil. So next time, i'll cut the amount in half, and see what happens. Otherwise, simple, easy& good:-)

I have made this for years and it is delicious. I use fresh onion and garlice rather than powdered. Also, after it is cooked, I sprinkle on some grated parmasean cheese before serving. It is still hot so the cheese easily melts....and tastes amazing!

I love this combination.  I make it even easier.  I just put everything into a steamer and cook it that way.  I add anything I have in the refrigerator from cabbage, carrots, broccoli.  Much healthier not using the oil.  Yum, Yum!

I have actually been doing a version of this for years, but it's a bit different. I put just a touch of olive oil (barely a tablespoon) and toss the potatoes in to get some good color on them. (Sometimes I will add 1 tbs. of butter just to thicken it up at this stage but it's definitely optional) Then I add the rest of the veggies and I use fresh garlic and diced onions and no garlic powder or onion powder. Then I add vegetable or chicken stock (whichever I have on hand) and let it cook low and slow until they absorb the broth. It gives it a different taste and is MUCH healthier than all that oil. I brown the kielbasa in a separate pan and then add it at the end. I also use red peppers in addition to green, and I use turkey kielbasa, which tastes just as good but is MUCH healthier!

This was REALLY good! My kids loved this.. I did not use all the oil. I did what another reviewer did, I first cooked the cut up polish sausage, then took it from the pan, I them put a small amount of EVOO in the pan and cooked the potatoes, onions and peppers. I also used lawry's season saly in place of the spices, and fresh ground black pepper. I added the sausage back in for the last 10 min of cooking. Very tasty!

Really good and so easy. I used Smoked Sausage. Go easy on the oil as some is rendered from the sausage. I like to give the potatoes a head start by microwaving them a minute or so before adding to the saute pan.
We love this with creamed corn on the side just because that's how grandma served fried potatoes! I add a crispy lettuce salad and buttered Rye bread is good with it.

Really good, quick, easy and not expensive to make!! Followed the recipe pretty much as it was, but used only 2 tbs of olive oil, and added a cup of chicken stock. Had a leftover 1/2 red pepper so I added that to the 2 green ones. Left the skin on the red and yellow baby potatoes and used fresh garlic. Served sauerkraut on the side. Hubby and 2 teenage boys inhaled it!

Turned out great the first time, kinda soggy the second time. I may try cooking the kielbasa separately as I cook the onions and potatoes rather than cooking them together for another full 15 minutes. Still, glad I found this recipe - quick, easy, hearty meal.

Good rustic food!  We added a small amount of fresh hungarian wax peppers as in our area, hot peppers seem to be in everything like this.  Liked the blend of colors and flavors.  Also used low fat kielbassa, parboiled potatoes, and just a splash of olive oil as a substitute.  Probably still a lot of saturated fat, but that should help balance it out.

This has been one of my main dishes for years, but, instead of any oil I use a can of chicken or beef broth. I have also added sweet potatoes on occasion and multi colored bell pepers. GREAT meal. tom

Changed my stars!  I made it again and just cooked the potatoes for about 5 minutes before adding onions, then about 10 minutes after added the rest.  I also added lawry's season salt and that seemed to be what it was missing the first time.

Made this last night, and my husband loved it! I also cut oil down to 2 Tbs, used turkey sausage, and omitted the salt. I work with moms and kids and I'm anxious to offer this recipe. (Kids would appreciate green beans--maybe Italian--in place of the peppers.)

Great dish, really enjoyed it. Did as several other reviewers recommended and cut down on the oil. Cooked the meat first, set it aside and cooked the vegetables in the juices left over from the meat.

Very yummy, will likely be making this dish again.

This has been a favorite of my family's for years!! We also enjoy this on the grill... Just put your ingredents in tin foil with lots of butter. Roll the tin foil till closed up tight and let it heat on the grill or in the oven for about 30 mins, till potatos are tender. Yummy!

To cut the fat, I use Turkey Keilbasa sausage cut in one inch pieces. When you mix it with the potatoes, onions etc., you can't taste the difference and it is  a lot healthier. Good easy dish to make. I covered the pan for about 5 minutes to cook the potatoes a little faster, and then uncovered the remaining five minutes.

Very good, very easy. We like to layer it all together in a one-use foil pan, dot with some butter, seal with foil and grill for 45-60 minutes on medium heat.

Yummy quick and easy weeknight dinner. I parboiled my potatoes, because I wasn't quite sure what I was going to make for dinner until I found this recipe. Left out the onion powder since there were sliced onions. I used red potatoes!!

This was a good recipe.  I used yellow below peppers since I didn't have green bell peppers.  The bf liked it.  It was a solid, hearty meal.  I didn't serve it with a side and it filled us up.

Big hit with the whole family. I cooked the potatoes and onions first with all the seasonings until the potatoes were about 1/2 way done.  Then I added the green pepper and sausage.  Definitely used alot less oil.  I've found generally that if sausage seems too greasy or fatty, boiling it first will reduce that.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wonderful aroma and delicious taste. I took others suggestion and cut oil back to 2 tblsp which was plenty. I also used yellow onion, red and green bell pepper as suggested. I cooked the meat, onion, and potatoes all the same time. Added the peppers within the last 5 minutes to keep them nice and firm. I also added some crushed red pepper and just a hint of cayenne pepper. To complete this meal we served it with fresh grated cheddar cheese and sour cream for wonderful complimentary toppings. I also served warm tortillas. What a wonderful quick one-dish meal. Really satisfying. Thanks!

I liked this the first day--but cut down the oil.  I reheated the next day and it was just too greasy so I wouldn't eat it as a leftover but liked it the first time around with about 2T oil.

After reading many reviews, I too cooked the sausage before the potatoes. I diced red potatoes and used 2 tbsp EVOO, seasoned salt, and a little garlic powder. My DD inhaled two bowls, and my hubby had seconds. I think my son would've had more but the had to leave for a meeting. I saved the 1/2 cup of leftovers in a ziplock for son's lunch quesadilla tomorrow, and he loves the idea. Personally, I'll use a different brand of kielbasa next time, and this wasn't my favorite dish, but I think it will earn a "keeper" in my rotation.

This was great stick to your ribs food and oh so easy to prepare.  The only thing I did differently was add some crushed red pepper and some Lulu's Crazy Creola seasoning to kick it up a notch.  Next time I will brown the Kielbasa first also.

This recipe is definitely a keeper, and the leftovers make a good scramble for breakfast, too. The only thing I would change is not putting the onions in until you put the bell peppers in because by the time everything was finished, my onions were burnt. Other than that it was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I made this dish over this past weekend and it was delicious.  I did adjust a few things did not use vegetable oil used olive oil instead along with Butterball Turkey Sausage, fresh garlic & mushrooms.  Made a double batch since we had company and there were no leftovers.  I will be making this again

This is simple and excellent. For heart healthy, I used turkey kielbasa. It tasted great. I always use olive oil and did not have to change anything. I threw a little paprika to spin things and used 3 tbsp of oil. Agree that was snuff. Enjoy!

this is great just as the recipe describes it. i put a little different spin on it the second time i made it. i browned the potatoes, poured off about half the oil and did the kielbasa, (i'm in china so it wasn't really kielbasa but it wasn't  a bad sausage) then when i put the rest of the vegetables in (i added mushrooms) i poured on a sweet and sour sauce ... just sugar (i like brown sugar rather than white) and white vinegar. chinese friends loved it.

Would give this one more than 5 stars if I could!  We did start by browning the kielbasa, then adding the potatoes, etc.  We also added some shredded cheddar cheese at the end, and let it melt.  This was a fantastic meal!  Thanks!

Very tasty and a good way to use up leftovers! I used italian sausage and some andouille, because we had it on hand. Also, I used leftover mashed potatoes, which made it a little more stew-like. And threw in some zucchini. Enjoy this simple supper!

Perfect- I browned thin slices of the Polska Kielbasa in a cast iron dutch oven (on the stove top) with very little canola oil.  Set it aside to rejoin potatoes later.  Little oil was necessary to cook potatoes and onions, and the drippings from browning the meat added depth and flavor.  Warms up beautifully.

My husband was Polish so I learned alot from his mom. I have done this for years, and now I'm craving it again. I do cut up the Kielbasa and cook everything like a stirfry and I use alot less oil. Sometimes I omit the potatoes and I make everything and toss it into pasta, that it awesome. This dish is very versatile, thanks for reminding me of it:)

Tasty meal, fairly quick and definitely easy.   Good flavor.  It's not going to knock your socks off and make you swoon, but it's good enough to be a dinner about once a month.

My husband loves this combination. Did not have enough Kielbasa, so I cut up a package of National Hebrew Beef Hot Dogs. Served with fresh cut tomatoes from the garden on the top.

Anytime "Polish" is in the recipe name, it's not going to be lowfat and/or healthy.  Not something you'd make every week, but sure is good on a cold night after shoveling your way into the house!  Comfort food is not known as "healthy" food.
Good Polish Girl!

Classic dish of sausage and peppers.  Try this for something similar, but better:  Par-cook potatoes in microwave 'til slightly tender.  Then, add everything to a large piece of heavy-duty foil.  Instead of oil, dot with several pieces of healthy margarine (i.e. Promise or Smart Balance).  Add 1 large fresh tomato, chopped and pour over all of this a cooking liquid of: low-sodium chicken broth mixed 50/50 with vermouth. (About 1/2 cup of liquid for 3 or 4 servings.)  Seal up the foil pouch and place on outdoor grill on medium-high heat for about 20 minutes.  Add 1/2# (for 3-4 svgs.) of frozen, cleaned, shell and tails-on large shrimp.  Re-seal foil and cook about 7 minutes 'til shrimp are pink and cooked through and veggies are tender.  Serve in bowls with liquid and sop up with some crusty french bread.  Yummy...

This dish would be great if only real Polish Kielbasa was used instead of pre packaged Kielbasa sausage.

Very good, basic supper. I used smoked turkey sausage, red potatoes and red peppers.   I used just a tablespoon or so of evoo.  Also added some cajun seasoning. I really enjoyed the peppers, would add cabbage or sauerkraut next time.

Made this for something different, uncomplicated, and a break from the low fat food...  Loved it!  The husband really loved it too.  I like that it's all inclusive - no need for side dishes - it's all in there!  I did as others suggested - used less oil, cut the sausage into smaller slices (1/4 inch or less) and fried up the sausage first.  I had some problems with the onions sticking to the bottom of my pan, so I could have used a little more oil (only used 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil at first) - or it could be that the non-stick coating on my saute pan is shot.  Probably a combination of both.  But it still rocked!  Was way more tasty than I expected, and will be a nice addition to my rotation.

Would definitely make it again... but made the sausage first then cooked the potatoes in the grease from that, adding a little olive oil as I go.

Tasted great!

This was very good. We loved how the potatoes and onions carmalized and the flavor. This one definetly made it to the hardcover recipe binder!  I also cut down on the oil as other mentioned and I cooked the potatoes as directed in the recipe and they were more then done. Might have cut them smaller?

This is a wonderful recipe. Easy to make and tastes great.  My husband loved it.  I cut the oil down to 2 tablespoons and still thought it was greasy.  I will make this again but cook my sausage first and use only the grease from it to cook the potatoes, maybe it will cut back on the greasy texture.

I've cooked Kielbasa at least three different ways from recipes on this site and I will stick with all of them and leave this behind.  I had to make too many changes to get things to work to our taste - but that is the fun of this site.  We all have different tastes.  Thanks submitter.

This was an excellent way to use the 1/2# polish sausage I found in the freezer.  Scaled the receipe to serve 2 but cut the oil as another review had suggested.  Only had frozen green peppers, and it softened the potatoes a little. It was still good and tasty.  My husband ate everything that was left and loved it.  Will be making again, but will use fresh green peppers.  Thanks Chris.

I only had a can of diced potatoes so I threw that in.  I didn’t have green pepper but had a red and orange one that I cut up and used.  And I threw in a can of corn just because.  Didn’t need that much oil as it called for.  Turned out delicious.  No leftovers either.

I precooked the  potatoes in the microwave like someone suggested but then they turned out a bit too mushy. Next time I won’t precook the potatoes and I will probably brown the keibasa first for that extra flavor. The dish still turned out tasty and was an easy meal. The husband liked it so I will make it again. Thank you.

I utilized some tips from other comments. I cooked the kielbasa first and set it aside and I also used less salt and less oil since I cooked the potato’s and onions in the drippings from the kielbasa. This recipe was really flavorful and will definitely make it again.

I did cut down the oil, to about 2 tbls.  then saute'd the kielbasa first.  Par cooked the potato in the microwave for about 4 min. Once the kielbasa was browned, I removed it and threw in the potatoes with the onion, some chopped garlic.  Never had to add more oil.  Came out like my mom used to make it.   Some hearty bread, and a great quick meal.   I am polish, so kielbasa, although not great for you is part of a balanced diet.  You can;t eat this everyday, but it is a great quick meal in the rotation.

This turned out fantastic.  It was thick, meaty and filling.  I did not change a thing and will definitely make again.

Very good recipe and so simple to make! We used kielbasa (not the prepackaged ones, but from a Polish deli. Great flavors, but would omit adding salt, especially if you are using the typical brands found in stores (more salt in those compared to what I bought and I would still remove the salt). I think some herbs would be good in the recipe, such as a little marjoram or thyme. Overall, a very tasty recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us!

Super easy and tasty.  My daughter who is 11 made this with a little help from me.  She was able to prep all the ingredients and do most of the cooking.  And everyone enjoyed it (besides the one that doesn't care for meat, lol).  Thanks for the recipe.

I took the advice of reviewers and cooked the kielbasa first, set it aside and cut way back on the oil... I also used healthy refined coconut oil instead of unhealthy vegetable oil. (Refined coconut oil doesn't taste like coconut.) 

I found that the potatoes stuck to the pan quite a bit so I might have to use more coconut oil next time to prevent that.

Entirely too greasy if you follow the recipe, which unfortunately I did.  If I made this again I would cook the kielbasa separately and add at the end.

I was looking for a recipe that would cook up exactly this, kielbasa, onions, peppers and potatoes.  I usually make it without the potatoes but wanted to add them and still ensure everything cooked properly (I have a history of raw or mushy potaotes). This was PERFECT. Exactly what I was looking for. I did reduce oil to 3T, browned the sausage first and set aside, and I used extra potaotes, because I had them to use up.  YUM  Thank you @chris523

My husband and I liked this dish a lot. But the salt content was way too high. I'd make it again, but I wouldn't use the salt and I'd use much less oil.

I followed a few reviewers and baked this in a 375 oven for an hour. I put the sausage on the bottom and sliced potato on top. I had a mixture of onion green pepper and olive oil with the spices and put it on the potatoes. Baked uncovered for 45 minutes then stirred it all together and baked for another 15 minutes. It was good.

I have made this recipe several times and my husband and I really like it.  I do use less oil and we like smoked chicken sausage for the meat.  I made it for potluck once and there were no leftovers!  This is definitely on the "make again" list.

Really liked this!! Did cut down on the amount of oil and the potatoes did stick a bit. Added a small amount of beer to deglaze the pan before I added the sausage, and it did the trick. I also, used a venison/pork sausage that I browned first, and red and green bell peppers for color. Will definitely be making this again. Good, hearty, easy on the purse meal.

Cooked this dinner for my husband and myself.  It had a great flavor but was very heavy.  I might try to cut back on the vegetable oil or try it with turkey sausage for a healthier option.  The peppers that were in it were really unnoticed and not overpowering.  Overall, everything tasted great and I would make it again.

My whole family loves this easy to make tasty dish.  So good I shared it with a friend who says it is now a fave of theirs.  I have a love of red bell peppers so I used one green and one red. Yummy.  I was worried it would be dry but it was not. Definatley a new staple in the recipe box.

Very good recipe.  I agree with others who suggested cutting down on the oil.  Adding a little zesty italian salad dressing while cooking adds a nice flavor.  I used red skinned potatoes that I boiled a few minutes to soften then add which was also very good.

Don't all grandmothers say "EAT MORE!" LOL this is a family favorite also my dad a good ol German cook would make this at least 2-3 times a month. THE FAT, CHOLESTEROL AND GREASE are what make this taste so sinfully delicious! YUM YUM! MAKING TONIGHT! if I could I would give this 10 stars!

Very yummy!  I added baby carrots and next time I will use much less oil.  The kielbasa sausage will have plenty of grease when it starts cooking down.

This is similar to a recipe I love. Mine is baked at 450 and instead of garlic powder, use about 10-20 whole cloves of garlic and olive oil and no onion powder. This is a better way to make it in the summer without heating up the house. Delicious!!

My husband and I loved this.  I used low-fat turkey kielbasa and cooked it first as suggested by other reviewers, so that it's flavor could spread to the veg and I could decrease the oil.  At the end of the day, however, I have no idea how much oil I used because I didn't actually have much grease left from the low-fat kielbasa.  So when cooking the potatoes, I ended up adding oil as needed, and I added more than I think I usually would to a recipe - it may have gotten close to 1/4 of a cup.  So I wouldn't call it a particularly healthy recipe, though the potatoes soaked it all up so it didn't come across as a greasy mess either.  It tasted amazingly nice and made us feel really good.  It's good home happy food.  As in, it is literally impossible to be sad when eating this meal.  I will definitely be making it again - maybe not often since I like to eat healthy meals, but it will make a semi-regular appearance on my table, especially during those depressing winter months.

This is great "comfort" food.  My entire family loved it and request it often.  I did cut back on the oil and I also added saurkraut the last time that I made it - wonderful addition.

This was WONDERFUL! I did not change a thing. I couldn't believe that I made something this good, haha! My husband thought A COUPLE of potatoes were too firm, so, I would just cook it a little longer. However, many of the pieces were so soft that they were beginning to get mushy. You just have to be careful and make sure the potatoes cook evenly. Will definitely make again!

Easy and hearty meal. You definitely don't need nearly 1/4 cup of oil; use just a couple tablespoons in the bottom of the pan. We used turkey kielbasa to reduce the fat, and it was very tasty.

Very good meal!!! I was surprised at how quickly the potatoes cooked through. The only thing I would change for next time is add more potatoes, they were delicious.

Easy and delicious recipe! I took the advice of some of the other reviewer's, and cooked the sausage first for about 10 minutes, added the other ingredients, using one fresh garlic clove on top of the powder and it was fabulous. My husband says it's a keeper!

Was looking for an easy "comfort food" recipe.  This one hit the spot.  It took a little longer to cook than I expected, but I think I just used a pan that was too small.  Will be making this again, and again, and again...

I really liked this dish!  It's such great comfort food.  I didn't cook everything for as long as the recipe stated.  I just made sure the potatoes were tender, and the kielbasa was heated through.

I combined both of Christopher's recipes (this + Mimi's Slumgullion), then added my own flair (2t chopped garlic instead of powder, and lite kielbasa).  I microwaved the cubed potatoes for 5min, then added everything to the pan after cooking the onions slightly.  I sprayed the pan, no need for that much oil!  We ate every drop!

We loved this! I did a little of alteration. Instead of 2 green peppers, I used half of a green, half of red and half of a yellow!! Looked wonderful and tasted wonderful. We also used beef sausage instead of a keilbasa since that was what we had in the fridge. Definitley a keeper to make again!

Loved this!  I did not add the green pepper - we are not big fans!  My husband loves to eat his kielbasa with bbq sauce so I served it on the side as a dipping sauce.  Goes great with cheddar biscuits!  Thanks Christopher - awesome comfort food!  And it reheats well the next day (or 2)!

Very good!
The potatoes got very mushy on teh outside, so the entire dish got potato-slop all over it...  not necessarily a bad thing, but maybe I'd recommend keeping stirring to a minimum to prevent that.  My onions never carmelized...  I dont know why.  Oil was actually right amount - any less and the food would have burnt even more on teh bottom of the pan.  (the reviews that claim to use less oil say things liek "used a couple tablespoons for a half recipe"...  well, 2 tbsp X 2 = 1/4 cup....)

I tried this last night and it was so easy and soooo good.  Even my husband, who hates onions and green peppers (he of course didn't eat those), thought it was great. The only changes I made were to use fresh garlic & a diced jalapeno.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!
