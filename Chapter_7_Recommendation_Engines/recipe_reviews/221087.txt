I had just reviewed this when it was an unpublished recipe.  I also submitted a photo!  Great salad!  I used a red tomato and a brown (Mexican) one.  Next time, I might add some herbs, but this recipe is good the way it is written.

Great pasta salad, I used a yellow bell and cherry tomatoes, and added some black olives. This salad was a hit with my family and my youngest son who usually doesn't like pasta salad fought me over the leftovers, which were even better. Thanks Janet, love the tomato sauce addition in the dressing.

A pasta salad that just keeps better and better with time.  I made this using fresh veggies from our garden with the exception of the purple onion.  The dressing is a wonderful blend of ingredients.  We liked the salad the first day, but thought the taste just improved with time.  A real plus factor with this salad is that it keeps very well in the fridge for 4-5 days without it getting mushy.  Janet, thanks for sharing this recipe.  My DH and I enjoyed it for our lunches last week.

Made this for a family party and except for leaving out the onion because I didn't have one I followed the recipe exactly.  This is the best tasting pasta salad I have ever made, mine usually come out dry.  Thanks for sharing and this will be a summertime recipe in my house from now on.

Definately a repeat. Great way to use cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers from the garden. I used a yellow bell pepper and tri-color rotini for even more color.

I would make this again! Instead of cucumber I used snap peas and I thought the dressing was a bit overpowered by the red wine vinegar, so I just added some more tomato sauce to balance it out. This was tasty!

A really good pasta salad!  I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hrs before eating.   Every one loved it.

This is a keeper,the dressing is spot on and like the others say the tomato sauce is pulls the flavors together for a great fresh tasting salad.I like a little meat in this one so I cooked up some chicken brats sliced them up and it made a nice addition to the salad with out a lot of calories.This one is going in the recipe box.

I liked the addition of the tomato sauce here, great way to change up the flavor on my typical pasta salad with vinegar dressing recipe.  With what I had on hand, I used Red, Yellow, Orange & Green Bell peppers, Red onion, tomatoes with the dressing recipe as written but less salt and added dried cilantro.  Also, I didn't want open up a can of tomato sauce to use such a little bit so I used v-8 that I had on hand instead, flavorful!

I really liked this salad but my husband isn't a fan of cucumbers. I'm going to try it again without the cucumbers & hopefully he will like it as much as I do. the tomato sauce was a great addition

There was nothing glaringly wrong with this recipe. The dressing was decent and had a nice, light zip to it. But I just wanted something with a little bit more flavor.
