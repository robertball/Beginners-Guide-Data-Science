Excellent! A little spicy.....but that's the way I like it. I added some fresh cilantro too. This is the best turkey soup I've ever had and my husband agrees.

I can't believe this recipe only has 11 reviews!  It's delicious!  Are you looking to make soup with turkey leftovers but hate all that bland stuff that's out there? Me too.  Thankfully, this is a great recipe that does not disappoint.  Zippy is a great word for it--enough spice that it's 'kicked up' without being hot.  After adding two cans of stewed tomatoes, I ended up adding an additional can of diced while the soup was simmering.  I think next time I'll just opt for diced tomatoes as the stewed chunks seem too big in the soup.  Instead of rice,  I used 1/2 cup of Orzo that I had on-hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe over the course of two days.  I made the broth the evening we had the turkey, refrigerated it overnight, skimmed the fat that separated, and then added all additional ingredients the next day.  I already printed this and have added it to my trusty recipe binder in my  kitchen.  Thanks for the great soup M Vidito

This soup was amazing!   I substituted pearl barley for the rice and followed the recipe otherwise.   It's very spicy but not too spicy.   Great blend of flavors.

We really enjoyed this! It is a recipe that is very adjustable to your taste. I started with 3 quarts of stock I had already prepared, the recipe didn't really call for a specific amount of liquid so I eyeballed the rest. I only used one can of stewed tomatoes and half the rice, which was perfect for our taste, it didn't absorb all of the liquid leaving it more like soup than stew. Didn't add the corn. We liked the hearty nature of this turkey soup and would make this again! Thank you!

I'm giving this four stars instead of five because I made some changes, but It turned out great.  As per previous reviewers, I added only one can of tomatoes and omitted the corn.  I had broccoli on hand but no green beans, so in went the broccoli.  And maybe most importantly, I omitted the ginger and added 2 tsp. smoked Spanish paprika, which gave the soup a wonderful smoky flavor.  This will be our go-to turkey soup recipe from now on.

Excellent turkey rice soup! We loved the mix of herbs and spices, and added a little extra fresh thyme. The only other change was to use one 14.5 oz. can of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Don't really need a second can. Yum!

This is a really great soup.  I made up the broth, strained it and put it in the refrigerator to separate the fat and make it easy to skim off.  We like spicy so I added about 1/2 tsp of chili flakes as well.  Very tasty and healthy too.

I made a few adjustments (left out the spices I don’t like,)still turned out delicious. FYI: I steamed /cooked the rice first, I feel it’s easier to judge how much rice to add ( I didn’t want it like gumbo). I also only used 1 can of the tomatoes & a little dried basil. This is a very good recipe & easy to tweak to your liking. I’m definitely adding this recipe to my collection. Sooo good!

The spices in this recipe create such an amazing flavor...I didn't have a carcass, but just put all of our leftover turkey in a pot with the bay leaves, onions, and celery leaves and simmered for an hour. Then followed the rest of it. Oh and I used wild rice instead of long grain rice. You should try it! So so good!!!

Wow! I used smoked turkey and this was really fantastic! I reluctantly followed the recipe to the tea and was extremely grateful I did, all of the spices blended together perfectly and my family  couldn't stop eating it! Awesome!!

Spectacular - quite possibly the best turkey soup I've ever had. Spicy but not *too* spicy, just warm and deeply flavourful. I followed the recipe to the letter but left out the bouillon cubes; I didn't miss them at all.

I did not add corn or green beans since I did not have them.  I used Rotel diced tomatoes with chili and it was really good.  I will keep this recipe using the Rotel.

I’d definitely make this again!  I did not have any chicken bouillon so I subbed poultry seasoning. Added smoked paprika for some smokey depth.

What a nice way to use the left over turkey and enjoy another meal that was delicious. I did not use the carcass only the left over turkey pieces and followed the recipe as written. Nice taste, needed a little more salt and the cayenne pepper was just enough to heat things up. Add water if the rice gets too thick while cooking.

This was unbelievably good!!  I made it exactly as written (subbing fresh herbs for dried) and using only half the cayenne (because I was worried about the heat.) It had just enough kick for my sensitive palette, but my husband thought it could have been spicier with no problem.  Will definitely make this again!

Its tasty,  but you would probably be alright with only one sprig of Rosemary.   I cooked down the carcass from a 16 pound bird,  (so I made a lot of stock)  and with two sprigs.....  It was pretty potent.

To lazy to boil a carcass.  Used 3 cups broth (mixed chicken and vegetable broths I had left over).  Melted butter, sauteed  1/2 an onion, carrot, 2 stalks celery. Added everything but corn.  Simmered an hour, til rice done.  Added corn just before serving.  Has a kick!

Made this soup this morning,had all the ingredients from Thanksgiving.  Very tasty and a great use of homemade stock. The spices and tomatoes were a nice change of pace from all the other leftover turkey dinner food flavors.

I made this with the leftover Thanksgiving turkey and it was delicious! I somewhat improvised with the spices (I didn't have any bouillons and used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute instead of marjoram and thyme) and it turned out as more of a stew than a soup. I also made a vegetarian portion with veggie stock in a separate pan and that turned out nicely too, a really great recipe and actually quite easy! I'll be making this again soon!

Very good quick and tasty soup.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half but it was still too spicy for my partner.  I also found that it needed more stock to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Otherwise, it was very good.

I loved it! Different from my typical Chinese turkey and rice soup (juk). I used one can of diced tomatoes and a can of red kidney beans with the liquid. I took someone's advice and used 1/2 c barley but then it wasn't enough so I added 1/2cup of elbows. It was delicious!

Truly EXCELLENT! Used wild rice in place of white rice.

Awesome! The whole family "gobbled" it up! Husband declared this is the best turkey soup he's ever eaten! Thanks for sharing!
