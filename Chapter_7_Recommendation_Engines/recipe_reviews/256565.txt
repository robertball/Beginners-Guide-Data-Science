I have made these twice. First time followed the recipe, which I always do if I am going to review a recipe.  Meh, ok, but because of the protein worth experimenting with. Second time I swapped the seeds for some chopped pecans and a little coconut. Much better.  Both times kind of dry. I would say watch them carefully as they bake. They may not “look” done, check carefully. I found about 9 1/2 minutes is about right for my oven. Also, I used a small scoop, got 13 cookies. I have a similar recipe for oatmeal cupcakes, am thinking I might swap the coconut for a little oatmeal and see how it is. If you are on a special diet, these are definitely worth trying. Ok, so yesterday when I made these I kind of doubled the recipe. Used three small bananas (because they needed to be used up), no seeds, about two cups of old fashioned oats, 3/4 cup of pecans, added a tablespoon of vanilla,  two scoops of vanilla protein and two of chocolate (because I only had two of the vanilla left) and then the chocolate chips. With these changes I could raise this to four stars for a special recipe cookie. If you want a real, decadent cookie,  heck out Bobbie’s Oatmeal cookies on this site. Unfortunately, due to diabetes, Bobbie’s is now only for my husband

I added a little almond milk because it was very powdery and would stick together;  turned out good

These are great!  Even if you don't like the protein powder in a drink.  Mine were vegetarian as I used protein powder with milk in it.
