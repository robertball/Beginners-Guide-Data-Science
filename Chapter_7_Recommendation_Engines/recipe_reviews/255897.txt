Easy and full of flavor. I used Borden Provolone cheese, and a mixed ground meat combo. Those are the only changes I made. There are many possibilities with this recipe, my mind was spinning with ideas as I put this recipe together. Try it as is first you will be glad you did.

These were really good! Makes a great snack. Next time I will try making as a casserole for a nice dinner. Will definitely make again. Cheesy and tasty!

These tasty bits are perfect for game day snacking, get-togethers with friends, and way weeknight dinners!
I used half ground turkey and half ground beef, and I did switch to broil for the last couple of minutes (okay, I did over-do the broiling just a touch). 
These were very tasty, and definitely lend themselves to switching up ingredients.
