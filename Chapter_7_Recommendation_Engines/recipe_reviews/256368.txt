I use egg noodles in place of the rice! It's a hit with my 18 year old who loves buffalo chicken!

I didnâ€™t happen to have any rice or corn chips on hand, so used elbow macaroni and left off the corn chips. Since we like it spicy, I doubled the buffalo hot sauce and reduced the shredded cheese a bit - boy, was it cheesy! It was just what I was looking for. Yum!!! I look forward to trying it with the crunch of the corn chips next time.
