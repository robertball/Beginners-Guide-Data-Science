This was good but I might use less shortening next time.   I have never seen a recipe with 1/8 cup of baking powder before and I used only 1/8 tsp.  It seemed to work.
I also wonder if the 'cup' referred to for the flour is a proper dry measure cup or a liquid measure cup like a Pyrex one.  It makes a difference and may be why the 1 1/4 cup shortening seemed like too much.

By proportions of other crusts I have made, the flour should total 3 cups.

The dough was a snap to bring together but I feel the amounts were off.  I think it needs approx. 1/2 cup extra flour to keep it from sticking to everything in sight.  I also used only 1 cup shortening.

Delicious results, however!  Used it to make Shelly Hospitality's Blueberry Handpies.
