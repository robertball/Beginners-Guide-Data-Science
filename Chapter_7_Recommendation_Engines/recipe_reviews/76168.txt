I was looking for a new and different way to get rid of Thanksgiving leftovers when this caught my eye.  Thought it was a bit strange but I figured why not give it a try.  Surprisingly good!  I even tried a variation of using leftover stuffing in place of the turkey.  My only suggestion is I baked mine for 15-20 instead of frying them after tasting the first few fried ones and though they were greasy.  Also try using the cranberry sauce as a dipping sauce or even gravy.

These were actually better than I thought they would be. I added 5 oz. of cream cheese just because we are so used to making crab wonton that way. When I tasted the filling before they were cooked, I wasn't sure if people would like them. However, after they were fried they were really good. I have tried baking and frying wonton and the taste is so much better if you take the time to fry. It's a big difference. The easiest way is to put about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet and let them fry for a minute on each side.

Very good, and totally weird, which is the kinda thing my friends like.  I served it with extra  cranberry sauce to dip in.  I also had some goat cheese out and people seemed to like to pair the two.

These sounded strange, but were actually really good. I made a second batch different however. I mixed shredded turkey, cream cheese, mayo, homemade cranberry sauce, and a pinch of salt,  pepper and fresh garlic together and they were even better then the original. Either way they are a must try for something unique.

We made these last year for a party we had with friends the Friday after Thanksgiving. It was SO easy to make and we did not stray from the recipe. We used leftover turkey to make Turkey Wontons and we used the Cranberry Salsa recipe found on this site (the one with Grand Marnier) as the dipping sauce. We ran out of both and ended up going to the store to make more! Everyone left with the recipe... Best Friday Thanksgiving ever!

This is a great way to get rid of Thanksgiving leftovers. I thought it was kinda strange but it was very good! I did change a little, I used turkey, stuffing and dipped into cranberry sauce. My only suggestion is to bake them. After frying them my house smelt funny and they were a little greasy.  But I will use this the day after every Thanksgiving.  Maybe I will dip in gravy.

I LOVE this recipe! I have brought it to the past 4 family Thanksgiving get togethers and everyone raves over them! I usually make a dipping sauce out of mae ploy (sweet chili sauce) and soy sauce. SO good!

We didn't really care for these, but I don't think it was the recipe's fault. I think it was just too big a deviation from our normal way of eating turkey. I'd be willing to try again with cream cheese because we LOVE cream cheese/cranberry together, it was just my rotisserie turkey meat that threw me off, I think. I had fun making them though! Thanks for the recipe :)

A little light on flavor.  Needed something to dip them in to be a lot more flavorful.  Not bad, overall, but I would have to modify this recipe before ever making it again.

I dont know why everyone has leftovers after thanksgiving. I always cook at least a 20 lb bird and with 10-15 adults and at least 5 kids all of it is gone by the end of the night. So i tried this with some leftover chicken breast from last night and added dried cranberries, cream cheese, and chopped walnuts. It was delicious. No leftovers there either :)

Yes I've tried it, I didn't care for the cranberries in it, on tjhe side yes, but inside was a bit to much sweetness in a wonton.

These were OK.  Folding wontons is a labor of love.  For us, these were not really that outstanding to make a repeat performance.  I used cranberry sauce for dipping and it made a big difference, especially for cranberry lovers.

I made these according the directions and they were dry inside.  I made more with cream cheese inside and they were better but not great.  This is a good idea that needs a little tweaking. I think they would be good paired with goat cheese as another reviewer suggested.
