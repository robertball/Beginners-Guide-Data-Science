These were so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  They were very moist and did not dry out after a day or two.  My husband took them with him on a fishing trip and didn't even get one because everybody else ate them up.

These were tasty, especially with the orange zest. I added 1/4 c. more flour for high altitude. The only thing I didn't like was the wet, sticky dough-hard to form into perfect balls, which I like to do with my cookies. The kids and a neighbor really enjoyed them!

Excellent cookie recipe! The only adjustments I made was leaving out the ground cloves, uped cinnamon to 1 tsp and I chopped the raisins.  I baked on parchment paper instead of greasing the baking sheet.  They did not spread much so on my second batch I put only about 1 inch apart (Hint: I was able to use my one sheet of parchement for all batches after wiping crumbs off) . My batch yielded 4 dozen +1 cookie.  They are moist and yummy.  Dough appears a little moist before baking, but does NOT need adjusting. These were the most perfect cookies I've ever made! Definitely a keeper! Thanks Mili!

I just made these cookies and yes the dough was very gooey and moist. The first two cookie sheets I left as the recipe was and I had the flatest cookies possible. Almost impossible to remove from the cookie sheets. I added more flour and added baking soda. The cookies still were very flat but some better. This is not a recipe I would use again. I also added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. I drained the shreded zucchini yesterday and refrigerated it overnight to make sure as much moisture was removed as possible.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a good, chewy moist cookie.  however!  the batter is very very wet, and it took much longer to cook than the recipe states.  I started by cooking them 14 minutes and they were very soft - so soft that they would fall apart when  you picked them up.  I switched to a smaller spoon and ended up cooking them for 18 minutes and that seemed to do the trick.  I think I might omit the milk next time - the zucchini is so moist I don't know that you need it.  I also used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  overall they tasted good - I think I'll increase the spices next time as well.

These are SOOOO good!! I came across this recipe by accident in searching for soft cookies, and thought I would give it a try. They are SOOO good. My kids are devouring them! I made some of them in mini-muffins trays as well, since they are to go into Christmas gift baskets, made them look so cute. I omitted the ground cloves and upped the cinnamon as another user did. I did not have any raisins or nuts, but they still came out great! Definitely going to be making them again Can't wait to have people try them from their goodies baskets!

A friend gave me a giant zucchini so I made some bread, muffins, these cookies and froze the rest. My husband loved these. I just wanted to eat the dough and he didn't want to wait for them to cool. They're wonderful!

I was really discouraged by how flat these came out.  Even after adding almost another 1/3 cup of flour, they were still pretty flat.  The taste was good but they were nearly impossible to even pick up.

Very good cookie. Very moist. I don't know if I shredded my zucchini wrong but it seemed very runny at first so I added more flour until it looked like I could make a dolup out of it. Worked out great. Made lots of tasty cookies.  Will make again to use up all the Zuchhini we have from our garden.

Nice recipe - these are great and all 3 of my children enjoy them.  Mine did not come out looking like the picture (mine were really flat) BUT, it's all about the taste, right?.  I did add more zucchini, maybe that's why.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll be making these again!!

Unfortunately, these cookies just didn't turn out. They were as flat as paper, the tops never cooked, and if you left them in long enough for the tops to be cooked, the bottom's burnt. Also, they had absolutely zero flavor. I even added more of the sugar and spices and they were still flavorless. I wish that I could give a much better reveiw of these cookies as I had been very excited about them.

Excellent!  I will certainly make this again!  I used craisins instead of raisins.  I also used extra cinnamon instead of the ground cloves....

Good!  Hubby says too soft.  6 year old can't get enough of them.  Used all whole wheat flour and added ground flax seed.

We made thse last fall.  We had an overabundance of zucchini, so we made various dishes to use it all up.  These cookies were one of the best.  We will definitely be making them again this year!

I didn't add the milk, just mixed zucchini alternating with flour. I also added 1 cup granola to flour instead of nuts (inspired by another recipe here). And I made them SMALL: 1 flat tablespoon so they cooked 14 min
