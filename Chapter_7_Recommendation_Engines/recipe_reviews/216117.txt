Delicious! A really moist tastey cake. Careful not to bake too long as outside gets a bit of a crust.

I had some sour cream that need to be used up and came across this recipe. Very moist and easy my husband loved it no icing needed. The only reason its not getting 5 star is because he didn't sneak off and eat the whole thing!!!

Being from the south I adore pound cake.   My husband, also from the south, could care less about it.  This recipe does both.  Satisfies my pound cake craving and he loved it.  My kids and their families devoured this cake. so hubby and company requested that I make it again.  Yeah!, for taste and ease.  This is my new go to pound cake when I need something quick.  Followed directions exactly.  Thanks for ending the cake war between my husband and me! Topping is great, wouldn't change a thing, except maybe make 2!

My sisters and I have been looking for a coffee cake recipe that tastes like our grandmother's recipe for YEARS!  This tastes almost exactly like it!  I was soo excited when I found this!  Thank you very much for posting this!  The only way it could have tasted better would be if my grandmother made it!  I can see this becoming a favorite at our house VERY fast!

This is the same recipe as Moist Sour Cream Coffee Cake by Breakstone & Knudsen Family of Products (Also on this SITE). Check out my review there for more details. But in short, this is deliciously YUMMM! =)

Yummy - easy coffee cake to make and I already had all the ingredients in my pantry.  I might add a bit more brown sugar, cinnamon and pecans next time.  My family loved it.

AMAZING! i had all the ingredients on hand one Saturday morning and whipped this up.  absolutely delicious!  I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze on top.  this was great by itself or with coffee.
