A very refreshing blender drink.  Served at our annual beach party and was a big hit!

I am not sure Why this drink doesn't have like a BAZZILION 5 star reviews and just as many photos!! OMGOSHHHHHH this drink is DA BOMB! Looks stunning, lol at least I Hope this is what it's supposed to look like. BUT, BEWARE, fruity flavored and you can't taste the rum. Although you could add more I suppose.;) Over all very good for hot days ANY time of the year!!
