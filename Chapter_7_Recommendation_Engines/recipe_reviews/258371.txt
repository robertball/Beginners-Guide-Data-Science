Delicious!!! We didn’t have the silicone tin so we made boils. We  sprayed oil then pored 1-1/2 tablespoons of the batter in a cupcake platter. We then sprayed oil on the bottom of another cupcake platter and put it on the top. They are a little small but definitely great ??

My foods class made Chef John’s recipe and used a waffle cone iron and they turned out amazingly! My class had the best time and the recipe was so easy to make. The results were picture perfect. Not bad for High school and Junior high kids. The only alteration we did was add more vanilla extract. I alway double my vanilla because I am crazy about the flavor. Give this a try, you really can’t go wrong especially if you make the investment of a waffle cone iron for about $30 on Amazon. I don’t feel its a wasted investment as you will use it time and again and can use it for crepes as well. Something we do a lot in our multicultural home. If you are looking for a good cone recipe, you’ve found it!

Taste is great but not as easy to make as I thought. Burnt my fingers a few times trying to shape it. Some ended up chewy on some parts and crisp and almost burnt on some. Will probably invest on a waffle cone maker but use this delicious recipe.

yea i’ll def make this again they tasted really really good and we’re really easy and simple to make with little mess. some people complained about it burning their fingers but i didn’t have an issue with it. my only note is to make sure that you bake it all the way or else it will be a little soft and bendable on the inside and i did have of the recipe and it made four.
