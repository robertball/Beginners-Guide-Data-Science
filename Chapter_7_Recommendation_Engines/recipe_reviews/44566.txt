This turned out very well!  Having never made summer sausage, I was a little concerned.  The flavor is perfect and it was a huge hit with my husband and his hunter buddies!

I had to find a recipe to use up some elk meat from last hunting season, and came across this summer sausage recipe.  The only thing I did different is bake the sausage at about 250 degrees for about 3 hours.  It came out pretty tasty, and was a good way to use up some of that meat!

I adjusted this recipe to make breakfast sausage.  I only had ground pork sausage so I just used less of all the ingredients.  Didn't have onion salt so I added my own salt in the form of kosher salt and added Italian seasoning and fennel (my favorite part of sausage, hands down), then fried up for breakfast.  I didn't let it sit for 4 days since I determined I wanted sausage this morning so I'll try that next time, but this was good and very easy.  Thanks for the recipe!
