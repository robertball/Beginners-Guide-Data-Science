This is a very light and refreshing meal in itself!!I altered the serving size to five since it was just for me and it made enough for two good lunches. I did not have fresh sage leaves so I just sprinkled a little rubbed sage in there.  As far as the quantity of beans, I used 1.5 cans which was the perfect ratio for this serving size.  Just love the burst of lemon in every bite with a little bit of crunch here and there! For appearance sake, its best to serve the day it was made though!!

This is so easy to make with the results of a 5 star recipe. A keeper that can be used as a side dish or as a stand alone salad.

Love the different textures and flavors of this dish. I followed the recipe as much as I could with what I had but I only had dried parsley and rubbed sage. My husband (whoâ€™s not a lemon fan) loved it. Only thing he asked for was more garlic, but we are garlic fiends. Will definitely be making again!

Easy to make and was tasty!  Not heavily seasoned, however the lemon zest and sage were very refreshing.  Would be great for lunch or as a side dish.
