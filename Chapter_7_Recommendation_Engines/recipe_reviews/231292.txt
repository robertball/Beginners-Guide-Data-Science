I’ve been looking forever to find a comforting chicken casserole like my mom used to make in the 70’s & 80’s, but haven’t had much luck. This recipe comes close, with a few additions. I think this recipe as written makes a great solid base, but the flavor is too bland. I sub chicken stock for the chicken broth (a subtle difference, just my preference), and leave out the mushrooms (since my kids don’t like them), but leave everything else. Then I add the following: 1 diced onion, 1 cup chopped celery, cracked black pepper (to taste), and 1 cup slivered (not sliced) almonds. I add all of that to the sauce when adding the cooked chicken, green pepper, and pimientos. Mix well & cook til the chicken is heated through. After incorporating the rice, I also add 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese and mix well. Very thick and spreads easily into a buttered, 2 1/2 qt. casserole dish. This is a favorite at our house and provides plenty of leftovers.

My 5 children ages 5-16 loved it (and one hard to please hubby too)!  I am grateful for a recipe that does not contain mystery ingredient cream of soups! I added sauteed onion to the mixture, but didn't alter the recipe outside of that addition. Definitely a keeper.

Thought this was pretty good. A very nice subtle rosemary flavored cream sauce. I made it because I happen to have most of the ingredients and didn't have to use cream of chicken soup! 

 Changes:  used orzo (because I didn't have rice)...I thought the orzo was good with it.  Used  fresh mushrooms (didn't have canned).  Doubled the amount of green pepper and cut in strips.  Added more rosemary (I'm sure fresh rosemary would be wonderful!).  Was tempted to add onion, but, thought it might fight with the subtle rosemary flavor....so, left it out.

Pretty good!  Didn't alter the recipe much, except for adding sauteed onion instead of bell pepper, but overall great dish.

Fantastic!!! It didn't have a can of cream of some kind of soup in it! Easily adaptable with what you might have on hand. I didn't have half and half so I used a combination of milk and heavy cream.  I also substituted about half a cup of the water with white wine. Mmmmmm

This was a nice change from the mundane recipes in my head.  I deviated from the recipe a bit.  I sautéed the vegetables and spices with the chicken I also added minced onion and garlic with the chicken. Further, I added a can of corn and tossed in shredded asiago cheese after all the ingredients are tossed together.  Hint: my kids won't eat things that have mushrooms or peppers so I conveniently put them in my mini chopper and mince them so they don't know it's there.  Remarkably, they loved this recipe!

Easy and tasty; used up so leftover rice and added frozen peas and carrots. Will definitely add to my rotation of casseroles. Scaled down for just my husband and self: we both loved it.

If I make it again I'd use less rice. Wasn't creamy enough.

Maybe a good base recipe,  but I thought there needed to be more sauce or less rice. With some modification I possibly would enjoy it better.

I have actually made this dish several times.  I have not made it the exact same way yet ... it is a good base dish.  It is great for using up leftovers.  The most recent version was turkey and sausage blended together ... and it was very good as usual.

I added corn, carrots, & onion but omitted the pimento as I didn't have any on hand. I made the white sauce with 2% milk as I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2. None of these changes were the problem however, the casserole was just very bland. Since I used long grain & wild rice without the seasoning packet I corrected the blandness by adding the packet after mixing all & tasting it. I also added cheese to the top before cooking. It was better than the original recipe but it is unlikely I would make this again. This is the first recipe from this website that was disappointing.

Fun recipe to make, and economical, too. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the half & half. Great casserole dish, very comfort-foody and rustic. The only change I made was to use a rosemary/garlic spice blend and to add onion powder, plus I grated about 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack cheese that I melted into the sauce, and I garnished it with dry parsley. I'll make this again.

Was wonder full,  substituted mushrooms with sweet peas. Could this be made ahead and frozen ?
