Wow! These are spicy!  I didn't know if the recipe called for fresh or canned jalapenos.  I used canned (jarred)  my goodness these were hot.  I would use a LOT less jalapenos next time.  The recipe does say "To taste"  lesson learned.  You can always add more but you can't take them out once they are in there.

I did not add the sour cream, sadly. I ran out. But, YES! I love this recipe, I will definitely make this again! Thank you Ms. Reuteler!
