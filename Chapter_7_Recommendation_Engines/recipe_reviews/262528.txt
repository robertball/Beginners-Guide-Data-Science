I made this for a small party with only 2 changes to the recipe... I used smoked turkey sausage and 8 oz of velveeta queso blanco instead of shredded cheese. I ground up and fried the sausage in 1 Tbsp of butter; then I melted the cheese loaf with just a splash of milk before I added all ingredients to the slow cooker. Everybody LOVED it!! Will definitely make this again.

I made it.  I couldn't find the jalapeno sausage at my grocer, so substituted Johnsonville Chorizo sausages.  I got tons of raves about my dish and what was not polished off was saved and eaten a day later.
