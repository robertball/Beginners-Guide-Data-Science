The name of this dessert is pretty deceiving.  It is really a delicious blonde brownie and it taste nothing like cornbread.  I am a brownie edge person and this dessert didn't disappoint.  It is chewy on the edges and soft in the middle.  The self-rising flour ( I used 'Self-Rising Flour' from AR) worked great and the batter rose beautifully and held it shape once the pan was removed from the oven.  I cut the pan with a plastic knife so that it would cut nice clean pieces.  Next time, I'm going to toast the pecans before adding them to the batter.  Patti'sPantry, thank you for sharing your recipe.  It is a winner in our house.

This is a great recipe . Loved it with a cup of coffee and that it did not have icing.

I am so excited to try this recipe! I'm from a small town in Georgia and every weekend at our local farmers market this little old lady would make these and sell them. You had to get there early otherwise she would be sold out. As I got older we saw her less and less... then not at all. She had passed away. It broke my heart. This is a little piece of my childhood. I'm hoping they will be as good as hers. But sometimes you cant recreate memories. Wish me luck!

This is a great nut cake. I've never taken it anywhere that I wasn't asked for the recipe.  Tonight I converted it to mini loaves, and I wanted to share the formula.  I used the 2-cup  aluminum mini loaf pans, and one cake recipe made 6 loaves.   I filled the tins a little less than 1/2 way, and cooked them all at once... 300 degrees for 50 minutes and they turned out lovely.  Happy holidays, all!

The name of this cake is decieving,  but it is oh so delicious! A friend decided to  make it one night while we were hanging out at my house for a friend's bday celebration as a bday cake. When I tell you that was the best decision made that night,  we ate the whole cake in one night and it was only 5 of us.. The next day I craved it so bad I looked up the receipe and made it again the next day! I'm not a baking type person but this is so easy to make,  it's not my go to when I want something sweet or when I want to bake for friends and they love it!  This receipe is a must keep for your baking needs.

Delicious! I did add the Valdosta Pecans mix that you can get at Kroger, crushed almonds and brown sugar on top. Not too overly sweet, and makes a great light dessert. If you add some French Vanilla ice cream/or coconut milk ice cream on top, then it's perfect! Will be making this often. :-)

Cornbread cake was one of the desserts served at a ladies church group I attended. I’m allergic to dairy and was thrilled to know this cake is dairy free. This recipe is so good. My husband had two pieces after it was done! I can’t wait to have it in the morning with a cup of coffee. I followed the recipe as written, but did have to cook it almost 10 minutes longer. A piece of foil placed over the top about halfway through kept it from over browning.

Very good flavor.  I love butter so I did substitute 1/2 cup of melted butter for 1/2 cup of the oil.  Not the texture of the old blond brownies but I will make them again!!  Mine took 47 minutes to bake but my pan was glass and just a slight bit smaller than a 9 x 13 pan.  But what an odd name!?!?

This is sinfully delicious.   Taste like pecan pie in the form of a cake bar. Baked for 35 minutes and was still a little under done.  Will bake longer next time.

A coworker made this and share it.  It was so delicious. I made some today for church. My next personal batch will be made with half the amount of sugar. I used pecan meal instead of chopped pecans.
