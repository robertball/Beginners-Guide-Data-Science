This was easy and delicious!  I substituted grated cheddar cheese for the processed cheese.

This recipe calls for 6 boneless/skinless chicken breasts. The ones I had were ENORMOUS, so I sliced 3 in half. They barely fit into the casserole dish (overlapping). I used olive oil to brown the chicken and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. My chicken was done in about an hour.

This was awesome. I was worried after adding the Worcestershire, but I shouldn't have worried at all. The flavor was amazing. I doubled the recipe (including the sauce), but really didn't need to double the sauce itself.  I didn't have two cans of cream of mushroom, so I used chicken and mushroom, and I was short sour cream, but I added a little more cheese. Yum! Even my picky (and I mean extremely picky) husband ate two servings! Thank you for sharing.

This was really delicious...I can only imagine how good it would have been if I'd read the recipe correctly! lol I ended up missing the entire part about browning it first, then I missed the part about uncovering and cooking 30 minutes longer. So, for those who are shorter on time...just put the raw chicken into the dish, cover with the sauce (I used shredded cheddar/jack, btw), cover, and bake 45 minutes. Quick(er) and easy(er)!

This was totally awesome. Even my 2 year old ate it and he is so finicky about his chicken. I did only have 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts and forgot to cut the sauce down to accommodate for that and had WAY too much so I had to throw it out cause I had no idea what to do with the leftover sauce. lol

This is a fantastic comfort food. Will be making again as my children loved it. We served it with stuffing. I would give this 5 stars but I made a few minor changes. I substituted grated cheddar cheese for the Velveeta as we don't care for processed cheese. I had to omit onion and the mushrooms due to being the day before the weekly grocery run. I did add onion powder and garlic to taste. This is a really nice recipe to fix on a chilly day. Thank you for sharing as it provided a nice change from chili or stew on this dreary day.

This was delicious and a nice recipe to have on hand for chicken breasts. I added some mayo and shredded cheese to the mixture baked for about 40 min and the chicken was perfectly tender! Served over egg noodles.This will be a cold weather recipe for sure!

This was so easy! I did cut up the chicken in chunks used the larger can of Cream of Mushroom real mixed cheeses and a full cup of milk. I served it on linguine as I knew there would be enough sauce and was able to keep leftovers that everyone fought over the next day lol.

We really enjoyed this! It's simple and uses things I usually have available. I made it exactly as written except I didn't add the sour cream until it was already dished up because I forgot about it! Still delicious, and even better, of course, as leftovers!

I had some chicken breasts that had spent too much time in the freezer and were looking a bit dry so instead of pan frying them for this recipe I poached them in chicken broth and wine. The poaching made them moist and juicy. Then I followed the reminder of the recipe. It was a good chicken and gravy comfort food.

I made this recipe excluding the minced onion and paprika. The sauce was good and easy to make. My family enjoyed it. I kept it in the oven covered for 30 minutes and 20 minutes uncovered. It is not needed to be kept in the oven longer than that.

Was very good! I altered it due to certain items that the kids and husband just won't eat but it turned out fine. The reason I give it a 5 star rating is this: it's a perfect recipe for the beginner cook. I'd have given anything for this recipe when I was just starting out!! Best of all as your skills improve you can take this recipe and add or substract or substitute to make it your special dish making it as casual or fancy as you like. My family enjoyed this very much and i will make it again. I will likely even try adding something different next time just to see what happens!

This recipe is not only delicious (exactly as is -- no modifications other than a smidge less Worcestershire) -- it resolved a major dinner dilemma for me. Our house is half vegetarians and half carnivores and this recipe happens to be one that is still absolutely perfect when you substitute Quorn chikn breasts. So I make a batch of each and everyone is happy. The veg version is one of my daughter's favorite meals.

I used pork tenderloin in place of the chicken. Then I put all the sauce ingredients except the sour cream in the pot and braise the whole thing. I also added some dill.

Delicious and fairly simple dinner for the family. Because I'm on diet I used light versions of the butter cheese and sour cream. Also used 1% milk and low-sodium soup which in all shaved close to 90 cal. Omitted onions simply because I don't like them. Also added a garlic and herb seasoning to the soup mixture. Everyone loved it with rice and green beans to complete the meal.

Incredible dinner dish! I've never done a review here this dish is very easy and not at all complex. I used shredded cheese part mozzarella and part chedder and used the leftover sauce to put on steamed veggies.

Hmmm - I didn't know it was going to taste this way. It tasted like beef stroganoff. That being said - my husband loved it as well as my daughter. I am a beginner cook - but the cooking time seemed WAY too long - and sure enough I thought the chicken was dry. It was edible but I expect all the near 5 star recipes to be out of this world good! Probably won't make again.

This was my second time making this recipe. The first time I followed it to a T and it was delicious! Even my picky daughter enjoyed it. This time I'm just making the sauce part to use in a ham and scalloped potato dish. I added and extra third cup of milk poured it over the julienned potatoes and cubed leftover cubed ham. Then I topped it with a little shredded sharp cheddar with a little bit of bread crumbs mixed in. This sauce is good on anything!

This was really yummy but I did make some adjustments. I didn't add cheese to make it healthier. I also used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup & reduced fat sour cream. Because I left out the cheese I only used 1.5 T of worsh. Finally I cooked it in the oven for 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered and it was still a little dry. Not too bad but enough that I'll probably only cook it for 30-35 minutes next time. Having said the adjustments it was still really good and I'm very pleased with the low fat version of this!! I couldn't find any reviews that had opted out of the cheese altogether so I was nervous. That's why I wanted to write a review. I had family over and everyone went back for seconds! By the way I made this with the Creamy Mushroom Spaghetti Squash found on this site and they paired perfectly together!

It was amazing! I actually added more sour cream but that is a personal preference. I didn t like the sauce at first but after it cooked with the chicken it was AMAZING! The sauce is really good on the noodles. I saved the extra sauce just to use on noodles later. The chicken was super juicy also!

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and a good thing because my husband almost cleaned up the whole thing. I have lots of sauce left over & will use to bake with lasagna noodles. My husband suggested using Cheeze Whiz to speed up the sauce and save his Velveeta for crackers! I will use this for company no doubt about it.

I used 3 chicken breasts (red bird farms) used 1/2 cup of yogurt instead of the sour cream added 1 cup of table cream (left over from another recipe) browned fresh mushrooms added 1 T. of Worcestershire 1 T. of bouquet garni and the pan dripping from the browned chicken. Baked it in a glass cake pan with foil. Served with sides of wild rice/white rice and steamed broccoli carrots and cauliflower. Still rich and everyone ate it up.

Excellent!! Doubled the sauce except the 'Wosh' sauce and served over some noodles that I just seasoned with garlic and red pepper flakes.

Really tasty! Only difference from recipe as written is the length of time in the convection oven. Only thirty minutes covered by foil in oven. Then foil removed and roasted for another 15 minutes. Cooked perfectly and still juicy. The family loved the dish.

Absolutely delicious only change I made was using cream of chicken soup inplace of the cream of mushroom. Served over jasmine rice and it was really really good everyone drooled when they smelled it cooking and wiped their plates clean.

This was very quick and easy to make and turned out delicious moist and tasty. Everyone in the family loved it. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans and made sure there was extra gravy so added a very large can of the cream of mushroom soup. Will definitely make this again for sure.

I thought this recipe was just okay. Followed it as written. I served it over rice. Husband liked the sauce but it thought it was okay. I won't save this but wanted to review it. Advice definitely add salt and pepper to the sauce. I can't really put my finger on what would make this better.

This is really good and so easy. Looks impressive too. I followed the recipe except that I use whatever cheese I happen to have. I think any good cheese would give you the same results. Like the picture on top of egg noodles is really good. I like extra sauce on the noodles so I made the regular recipe with less chicken. I followed the recipe and did put the seasonings on the chicken before I browned it. Looked beautiful golden brown. Final result was just a little too salty so beware about salting the chicken.

This recipe was delicious. My husband loved it and he is not a huge chicken fan. I made it according to the recipe except I used a 1 can of Campbell s chicken and mushroom soup. I served it with egg noodles and it made a great sauce to pour over the chicken and the noodles. I will definitely make it again.

Used low fat cream of mushroom soup and 4 skinless boneless breast halves. Made plenty of sauce which was very good. DH loved it. Enough for leftovers for the 2 of us. Might make noodles with leftovers to use up the sauce.

This was good not blue ribbon great. I followed the recipe exactly except used shredded cheddar because I didn t have velveta on hand. Other reviewers made this change without hurting the results. My husband liked it but doesn t want it on the regular menu rotation. I put the chicken and sauce on penne and maybe that was part of the problem. I would recommend a different noodle.

At home social isolating - missing my family dinner with adult kids and grandchildren. So, lots of substitutions because I couldn’t just run to the store. I love Allrecipes because reviews share success (or not) of substitutions. Substituted: broccoli for mushrooms; cream cheese for velveeta; cream of chicken soup for mushroom soup; added grated cheddar/jack blend. (Also adjusted # of servings.) Put take out dinners on porch for pickups. All three families called or texted to RAVE about the dish. One said they were fighting for the gravy. They all want me to make it again!

This is great! I did use a few variations, based on what I had in my kitchen. I think it's ok to vary a recipe, especially if you have to and it's great to read reviews about them, so you are more confident in your own ability to do so. I don't ever have canned mushrooms in the house, so after browning the chicken, I put that in the casserole and then sauteed 8 oz. of fresh baby bellas until they cooked down pretty well. Instead of 1/3 C. of milk, I used an entire soup can, based on wanting some extra sauce, and I used whole yogurt instead of sour cream, which I prefer. I might add some fresh crushed garlic to the mushroom saute next time. Everyone loved it. It really was delicious and we will make this again. I was looking for something to stretch 14 oz. of chicken for a family of four and this worked well! Thank you!

I think that this would be a much better recipe if there was a different type of cheese instead of the processed cheese. I found its taste off-putting. The chicken was tender and cooked well, though.

I made modifications for what I had on hand and being lactose intollerant. I used cream ofchicken soup buttermilk instead of sour cream and I used a little Pinot Grigio wine and then shreaded cheddar cheese. It tasted awesome. I served it over tiny shell pasta and on the side-sauted peppers onions and celery seasoned with badil oregano and balsamic vinegar.

Great recipe. I sautéed fresh mushrooms and onion in the juices from the chicken browning. And used shredded cheddar and mozzarella I only baked it for an hour but it turned out perfect. Poured over rice and asparagus it was awesome cream sauce for everything.

This was delicious! Husband said it s definitely a keeper. I used 2 lbs of chicken breast tenderloins cut into bite size pieces. I ve found we prefer this with any meat dish made with a cream sauce. Do not buy Velveeta so I used 1 cup of shredded colby jack cheese. Kept everything else the same.

Very good! I didn't change anything. I think I'm going to cut back a little on the Worcestershire sauce next time though. It was a little too much.

Ok when I first saw this recipe I thought oh boy another recipe using canned soup but I was tired and wanted something easy so decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did! This is delicious and you can bet I'll be making it again and again. I love the ease of preparation and the fact that it takes so few ingredients of which I almost always keep on hand. I served ours on a bed of cooked egg noodles and it was prefect. I will however double the sauce recipe next time if using a whole bag of egg noodles like I did this time. The only changes I made to the recipe was I used a whole small diced onion in the sauce and I sliced our boneless chicken breasts in half lengthwise so they were thinner. Mine baked 15 to 20 minutes quicker done this way and the meat was moist and juicy. The flavor of the sauce is wonderful I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you so much for sharing this very tasty recipe with the rest of us. I liked this so much that I've sent the recipe to a dear friend of mine in New York to try.

This was very easy to make and I didn't need to go to the store for ANY of the ingredients! (That's what keeps me from doing more than just saving the recipe for "future use". ) I took the advice of several people and used real cheese however next time I make this I'll select a milder variety because the flavor of the sauce turned out little too "cheesy" for me--MY bad! This one is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I'm sorry I didn't take a picture but I didn't want to review something I hadn't tried. It was yummy! I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic added an extra cream of chicken with herbs and did add rosemary to the chicken. Served with fresh steamed baby carrots and garlic mashed potatoes and I loved it. Now I'm sitting here to full to do the dishes. lol

I made this tonight & it was fabulous. I made just a few minor changes. I only used 4 chicken breasts. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used minced garlic instead of minced onion & I left out the sliced mushrooms because I am not a fan. The sauce is VERY rich & the next time I make this I might use just a little less Worcestershire sauce. I served the chicken with pasta- which paired amazingly with the sauce.

I've made this quite a bit. It's a recipe similar to one I used in the 70's. I have made with mushrooms and without when I didn't have any I've also used cream of chicken when I didn't have cream of mushroom. It's all good. Gotta use the sauce as gravy for potatoes or over rice or noodles. Easy peasy and good enough for company

Made a few changes because I simply did not have the Velveeta on hand so I used shredded italian blended cheeses sautéed real onion with the mushrooms and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup. Made with rice since there was plenty of sauce. I would definitely make this again! Did not need to bake for so long but this is an easy delicious meal to serve with rice or noodles.

This was OK. The cheese and sour cream made it a little richer but really this was just a dolled up rice with cream soup deal. Don't get me wrong I LOVE cream of chicken soup with rice but I really don't think of it as very special. Great for a quick deal when you're looking for fast and easy.

I made this last night.  The sauce was really good and I followed the recipe exactly.  My breasts were on the thicker side and the cooking time in the directions was way too long.  Something to consider when cooking them.  I should have reduced the time at least 10-15 minutes shorter.

I made this looking for something different to do w chicken breasts. It was delicious. I used cream of chicken soup, left out the mushrooms, garlic instead of onions, and I seasoned my chicken w salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. my son was licking his bowl clean. I used rice as a bed for the chicken and sauce. Definitely will make it again!

I doubled the recipe and substituted the onion with about 1-1/2 TBSP of minced garlic and used shredded cheddar cheese.  I had three large chicken breasts that were quite thick but they still turned out a bit dry.  Next time I will use a thermometer.  The sauce was EXCELLENT!

This was delicious. I thought the Worcestershire sauce would be too much but it mellowed out in the baking.  I split 4 very large boneless chicken breasts so there were 8 6-oz servings. I would double the sauce amount the next time because there wasn't too much left for the leftover chicken. I served it with egg noodles but there wasn't enough sauce left to serve with sauced noodles again, I'll just make buttered noodles for a side. I don't use canned mushrooms and I was too lazy to slice what I had so I didn't add them. This would make a great sauce for beef too. I also wouldn't cook for so long as the chicken was nearly cooked in the browning stage. I would bake for 1/2 hr covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

Amazing! We did not need 6 breasts as it is only two of us. We used 3 breasts and doubled the sauce. (We made a pot of rice for the side and the extra sauce made an excellent "gravy") We used real cheese instead of processed and it was splendid! We also added Broccoli when we added the sour cream and that was just awesome! Due to the smaller amount of chicken we reduced the cooking time and the first round with foil went for 30 minutes and then when the foil was removed it was done and at temperature in another 25 minutes.

Excellent weeknight meal. Prep time/cook time is not 2 hrs like it says above if you skip pan frying the chicken breasts. I added real onion & used healthy request cream of mushroom soup to cut back on the salt. I was a little weary about 2 whole T of Worcestershire but it melded with the other ingredients while cooking & would have been bland without it. Used fresh mushrooms & sauteed the onions with some garlic in the pan before I added the soup & cheese. My chicken breast halves were already tenderized so no need to cook for an extra 1/2 hour - 45 minutes was plenty. Overall great meal that we all enjoyed & will put this in my monthly rotation. Thanks for submitting.

Really good! I had on hand just two chicken breasts instead of 3 but didn't lower the quantity of the sauce which was the perfect amount for serving it with noodles. I'm glad I added the Worcester sauce as it gave it just the right amount of flavor. I didn't have sour cream so I added 1/2 cup of cream cheese with a squirt of lemon juice. I don't think I needed to brown the chicken first especially as I cut the breasts into small pieces for the kids. I probably could've put the chicken pieces with sauce directly into the oven and make it more quickly. I'll do that next time. Really good with spaghetti noodles but penne pasta or brown rice would also work well.

I think this would have probably been good without any tweaks but I have some habits that are hard to break and I couldn't help myself. I caramelized sliced onions in the same pan I used to brown the chicken. Why use two pans when one will do? After removing the onions from the pan and layering them on top of the chicken I discarded the excess fat and deglazed the pan with a bit of dry vermouth. I then followed the rest of the recipe as written except I chopped some fresh thyme and rosemary and added that to the soup mixture. My chicken breasts were a bit smaller than usual so I didn't cook it as long. I'd suggest you start checking for doneness at 30-35 minutes.

My kids liked this. I didn't have mushrooms so I just left them out and I used 1c medium cheddar don't have processed cheese in the house. Otherwise I followed recipe as written. I ended up with very dry chicken so I would recommend cutting cooking time drastically. Served over spaghetti- pretty good sauce. I will make this again.

I only used 2 chicken breast. Otherwise made according to recipe. I like sauce so it was good. I served over rice with lots of sauce!

I know it’s subjective, but too salty for me. Maybe I seasoned the chicken too much in the beginning. Beyond that, good flavor and timing was perfect for moist, tender chicken.

I loved the sauce. I used American cheese and it worked out very well. The family gave it 5 stars.

Instead of browning the chicken I melted some butter in the casserole dish and then added the chicken turning to coat. Used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed before adding the other ingredients for the sauce. Didn't have sour cream so used extra milk & cheese. Hubby really liked it!

This dish was amazing! There were a few items that I had to substitute but it turned out absolutely delicious! Instead of processed cheese, I used Monterey Jack with Jalapeno. Instead of Worcestershire sauce, I used a Aurora Beef Bouillon Cube and ended up having to substitute the butter for olive oil. My girlfriend and I were quite impressed with how it turned out! Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

I just tried this and it was good. The flavor was good and to tenderize the chicken I pounded it down a little thinner. All in all a good recipe.

Made this tonight. It was easy enough but I wasn't impressed (sorry). I seem to be one of the few but I thought it was bland at best. My husband said it was okay not great. Then again he's used to my highly seasoned cooking as well I guess. I wish I could be more descriptive in why but I just didn't like the flavor of the sauce. I followed the recipe as written no changes. Thanks for recipe though.:)

We loved this recipe but I was out of cream of mushroom so I sub cream of celery. Browned chicken tenders so it cut the baking time in half. We will make this again.

Anyone will love this dish unless they don't like gravy. It is delicious and very easy to make. I only used 2 very large breast and only 3 slices of processed cheese. I will be making this often.

This was yum even picky husband liked it. I did change it a bit. Instead of velveta I used garlic cheese roll that I had and some extra sharp cheddar cheese shreds left out the paprika and mushrooms used onion flakes instead of the real thing (picky husband or I would have added all that). will make again!

I did make a few changes to the preparation and ingredients of this recipe. First I halved the ingredients since I was only feeding two people versus six. Second I changed preparation technique to make the dish on top of the stove versus baking. I cut two chicken breasts into three pieces each so they were larger than bite-size but small enough to cook quickly in the butter. I took the chicken breasts out of the pan after cooking and then added the onion one clove of garlic and fresh mushrooms to sauté before adding the soup milk Worcestershire sauce cheese (1 slice of American and scant 1/4 cup cheddar) and sour cream. I also added 1/8 tsp of Poultry Seasoning. Returned the chicken breasts to the pan to cook in the sauce on low heat for about 20 minutes before serving. I served over whole wheat egg noodles. The end result was good but tasted more like chicken stroganoff to me. DH and I thought it was good dish but I think I may use with beef or vegetarian (Quorn) products vs. chicken in the future.

Absolutely delicious. Accidentally left out the sour cream but didn't miss it. Will try it as written next time. But this time... To use what I had on hand I substituted minced onion for chopped and substituted velveta for fresh shredded cheese. To cut down on cooking time I sliced the breasts to be thin. Pan seared as directed but then baked covered at 400 for about 10 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes. Served over a bed of penne pasta. Was not as much extra sauce as if hoped but that could be because of changes I made. Will make extra sauce for pasta next time because NO LEFTOVERS. This dish got gobbled up quickly. Thanks for the recipe. Love finding recipes that include things I regularly have on hand

My family thought this was amazing. I had some chicken tenders instead of breast so I used those. Other then that I followed the recipe. I have been bugged for three weeks to make it again so I will be using chicken breast this time. And I am making a double batch so this time I have left overs for work. I am sure it will be as good as the first batch.

I cut up the chicken breasts, added artichoke hearts and white asparagus.  I used fettuccini noodles and since I don't like using "processed cheese product" which isn't really cheese, I used shredded cheddar cheese.  I loved the way the sauce came out and will use it again and again!  I may add sour cream and/or Miracle Whip to it as well!!!

This was a great recipe base, but I changed a few things. These are chicken breasts, so they shouldn't need to be baked that long to cook thoroughly. I will reduce the baking time next time. I used fresh mushrooms and real cheese. I precooked the onions and mushrooms and added some garlic then added the soup and the rest of the ingredients...yum! The sauce is delish. I made noodles to accompany the chicken...the family loved it!
