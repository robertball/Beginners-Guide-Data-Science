Anytime I go out for a drink, I order Bahama Mamas. I am also a bartender. Coffee-flavored liqueur IS NOT in any Bahama Mama I've ever had. Try using light rum (or 151), coconut rum, banana liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine.

I tried this recipe and it wasn't at all like
the drink I always get out at restaurants.  It
has a very odd flavor with coffee liqueur.

This is great. I have coffee liqueur in my bar and it's nice to find drink recipes that include it.

This was ok but it didn't taste like the bahama mama I'm used to. What I'm used to: 1/2 oz each: 151, coconut rum, dark rum, coffee liqueur, 4 oz pineapple juice, juice of 1/2 fresh lemon.

The coffee liquor gave it an odd, "Off taste." I've never seen them made this way, but I had some Kaluha and decided to try it. I wish I'd not. I could not even finish it. Skip the coffee flavor for a more authentic taste.
