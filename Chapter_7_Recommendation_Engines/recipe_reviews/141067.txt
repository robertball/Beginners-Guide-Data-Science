we didn't have fresh anything, so I used botled spices, the potatoes were really nice, but for the rabbit, I'd been slow cooking it in water all morning when I looked for a recipe so I tossed it in the spice and tomato paste after I'd shredded it from the bones. Good recipe, will make it according to the recipe next time. I'll be prepared! thanks for sharing :)

This was pretty good but the searing cooked the onions and the olives to fast they ended up burning so I had to omit them from the final dish. Some lemon juice would have been perfect for a little tang. Will use this recipie again.

This was fabulous! I had 2 pans going, 1 with the rabbit and another with 4 chicken thighs. I used about 1/2 cup of chopped green olives as 1 Tbls didn't seem near enough to me. There really wasn't anything to simmer the rabbit & thighs in, so I added some sherry to each of the pans, and it added a lovely flavor. Definitely needs some type of liquid here. I also used a can of artichoke hearts in place of fresh baby artichokes. The potatoes were great as well. We thoroughly enjoyed this dinner, and will make it again.

This is absolutely delicious! Our rabbit did not produce enough juice to simmer for as long as the recipe recommends (our rabbit was very lean) so I added a little bit of water to it. Everything else followed to the letter. Very good, my husband loved it, and so did my one year old. Will definitely be making this again!

It was great. My boyfriend and I aren't a huge fan of olives and artichoke so we changed it up a bit. We used blue potatoes, purple onions, like the recipe calls for, but didn't add olives and used tomatoes instead of artichokes. We didn't have the same amount of rabbit, but cut what we had and I simmered the bones in with the meat to get everything off. It had a great taste!

tasty!  I too used bottled spices, came out really nice.  I added a dash of lemon which did add a nice tang at the end.  Highly recommend this dish if you want something that's not rabbit stew!
