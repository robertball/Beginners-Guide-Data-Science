Holy cow... First off if you haven't tried this soup, go fix you some for lunch. Best canned soup ever. I'm no "food snob"(there's enough of those in the world, don't you think?) so I have no trouble using good ol' Campbell's.  You know the ones... they turn up their aristocratic noses up at canned soup?  Ya, those. Look, these enchiladas are to die for.  I used flour tortillas, since I always have those. You must try this!  Tonight!  LOL!

this was very good the poblano sauce is sooo good!!! I only rated it though 4 stars because i think next time I am going to reduce the temp to 375 deg as my corn tortillas were too crisp on the bottom also the sauce you pour over the enchiladas literally soaked in so it was a bit on the dry side - so I will double the sauce next time..... other than those 2 things it still was very tasty and will do again - also want to try other recipes w/that poblano sauce!

Love this recipe! Have tried it twice and loved it each time. The second time I added more cheese than the recipe called for (I'm a cheese lover).

I've made this multiple times and it's always a hit.  It's a forgiving and versatile recipe.  I typically use Nacho Cheese soup because I've checked 4 different stores and no one is carrying the Creamy Poblano and Queso.  I add cooked rice and Rotel to mine, and that will increase the servings - Yay for leftovers!  I have also omitted the cilantro and green onion when I didn't have them on hand and it tasted great either way.  I've made this vegetarian by using chicken flavored veggie crumbles in place of the chicken and it turned out awesome.

Biggest problem here is that my grocery store did not have the Creamy Poblano soup sooo...my review is based on the substitution of Chicken Chili Black Bean I had to use.  Not sure why the store did not have as I live in a major metropolitan area?  I made sure they knew.  All that being said, it was still pretty darn good...hubby loved. I added black olives and served with sour cream.  Very satisfying.

Great base recipie to work with! I cooked my chicken in 1 can of chicken broth and 1 package of taco seasoning, then proceeded with this recipie. You can also add fresh poblanos and adjust the heat index of the recipie.

This is an outstanding dish that impressed our company, but yet, it is so darn easy to make. If you'd like a richer toping, substitute sour cream for the milk. It's delicious. You can put any type of toppings on it that you like after it's finished baking. I just put out a bunch of toppings and let everyone put on what they liked - diced tomatoes, diced green onions, sliced olives, avocado slices, extra cheese, and sour cream.

DELICIOUSS! I couldn't find the type of soup in the recipe, so I used Tostitos Queso Blanco dip. I also added the toppings after being baked, which added a delicious freshness to it. Would DEFINITELY make this again. Perhaps to make it less processed, I would make my own salsa next time. Either way, I absolutely loved this recipe.

Sooo sooo yummy. Although I have to admit that I had to switch it up a bit because I couldn’t find the Campbell’s poblano soup. And I was pretty bummed after reading the reviews and hearing how good it was. Instead of the Poblano cheese soup, I used 3 cans of the Campbells Cheddar cheese soup and 2 cans of green chili’s. My take on what the Poblano soup would have tastes like. And it worked FANTASTIC! I followed the rest of the recipe all the way down to the tomato and green onions as toppings. Everyone loves these and they were so easy to make.

I used fiesta nacho cheese soup and it was good. Next time I will use the poblano queso soup. I have used it before and it’s great in recipes, but sometimes it’s hard to find. Garnish with tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, sour cream etc.!

Delicious, but please clarify if you are using corn or flour tortillas. Your recipe states "corn", but your photos indicate "flour".  I am guessing you use flour tortillas because if you are only using 6, there would be a lot of mixture left over. I have my own recipe for enchiladas using this soup and I use 10 corn tortillas and they are creamy and delicious. Thank you so much for yours though, great variation on using this yummy soup.  I bought a case of it because finding it isn't easy and I have no idea if I'll ever find it again!

These were the BEST! The poblano cheese sauce was amazing! Even my picky eater wanted seconds, and he usually doesn't eat enchiladas. Made it exactly as stated, except I added shredded cheese to the top and for the chicken I used left over slow cooker cilantro lime chicken from this site. Soooo good! This will definitely be on my rotation.
