The original recipe is probably fairly mediocre but I followed the additional instructions of another reviewer and it turned out great, one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I will paste the other instructions below.  MAKE SURE TO ADD THE EXTRA INGREDIENTS AND FOLLOW THE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS!!!

I cooked about double the amount of shrimp like scampi in butter/olive oil mixed, using 4 cloves fresh garlic, the lemon zest and red pepper flake. Just as it finished cooking, I added 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and some chopped flat leaf parsley, salt and pepper. I then stirred in 1 cup of homemade pesto (from this site) and after that blended, tossed in the linguini pasta.

This recipe was alright, but it didn't bowl me over.  It called for far too much pesto (I doubled the shrimp and only used 3/4 the recommended amount, and it was still too much).  Beyond the pesto, I couldn't really taste any other flavors (despite my using a previous reviewer's suggestion and adding lemon juice and red pepper flakes).  I don't know if it was good enough to make again.

Awesome recipe! I even used whole grain spaghetti pasta. My 6 year asked for seconds. A delicious and attractive meal.
