I have been living in germany the past 17 years...a "schnitzel" is not cut up in pieces... it is 1 whole piece of meat ... mostly pork. you can also use a cicken breast... you pound the meat so its thin. you bread it with flour, egg, breadcrumbs
fry it in the pan... and the mushroom sauce is right... it comes on top of the "schnitzel" and you serve mashed potatoes and veggies with it. this here is also a german dish tho.... you call it "geschnetzeltes" which means something like "chopped up" and they serve it with rice instead of noodles. its still a good recipie.... just for somone who really wants to have the "german feeling" will get a wrong impression.....

For those that are confused cube does not mean cutting it into cube pieces.  "In the culinary arts, the term Cube Steak is used to refer to a cut of meat that has been run through a mechanical tenderizer. The resulting steak is called a cube steak because of the cube-shaped indentations made by the tenderizer. Cube steak can also be made by pounding the steak with a tenderizing mallet to produce the cube-shaped indentations."

I've made something very similar, but I do it slightly different.  I take the boneless pork and flatten it out with a kitchen mallet.  (Or whatever those are called:) I use the same method for the breading.   Instead of the dry mushroom mix, I use golden mushroom soup and add some Riesling to it.   I also prefer to use Spaetzle rather than egg noddles, but I have used Egg noddles before and it is still good.

A good, basic, reliable recipe for schnitzel (pound chops to about 1/4" thickness), but I preferred to make my own creamy mushroom sauce to accompany it.  (Sauté some minced onion and mushrooms in butter, deglaze pan with white wine, add beef broth and simmer a few minutes, add slurry of cornstarch and half-and half to thicken) I served this with spaetzle and Uli’s Apple Red Cabbage, recipe also from this site.

I currently live in Germany and schnitzel is big here. It is better when it's in slices then pounded (like most said), then breaded. Thats the way they make it here and it's always more tender. As long as you season it well, the sauce will turn out well.

Simple German home cooking. My husband has been wanting this since the 70's.  Helene's recipe brought out lots of memories.  Easy to play with (veal, pork, beef). We never make it the same way twice. Always comforting and delicious. THANKS!

I currently live in Germany and used this as my guide as I have eaten Schnitzel many times.  Schnitzel is made of whole pieces of meat and I used turkey breast.  Instead of bread crumbs I used whole wheat flour and it was amazing.  Made the gravy per the instructions and it tastes just like the Germans make it.  Will try again with pork and chicken!

Made a great Father's Day dinner, super quick and easy. Used olive oil, salt & peppered the meat before frying.  Used 1 pork + 2 mushroom gravy mix and sauteed sliced mushrooms before adding to gravy.  Used a wonderful hearty Gigli Toscani noodle.

Thanks so much for the post.  We had such wonderful schnitzel in Germany a few years ago.  This was very good.  I did dredge the chops in seasoned flour after flattening to about 1/4", then dipped in egg and then in panko crumbs.  I used a combination of a llittle oil and butter to brownj and the results were delicious.  Since I didn't have the gravy mix, substituted au jus mix, added alittle cornstarch and a drained can of mushrooms.  Using the gravy mix would have been better as even adding a little cornstarch to the au jus did not thicken as much as I would have liked.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks.

I lived in Germany for six years and schnitzel and boiled potatoes was my favorite dish!  I used turkey cutlets (whole) instead and did not deep fry, but cooked in a German gravy (Jager Sahne Schnitzel) after searing on both sides and put in chopped up mushrooms and just cooked it for 15 minutes altogether and it was fabulous!

I think a homemade mushroom gravey would be better. It really tasted nothing like real German schitzel. But it wasn't a bad flavor.

Very tasty!  I used pork loin cut in half and pounded out.  I also added a bit of heavy cream to the mushroom gravy.  Not exactly like what you find in Germany, but still yummy!

I left the pork whole and when done, addded a little butter and white wine and sauteed the mushrooms before adding the gravy mix.  I will not use as much water as the gravy recipe called for next time to thicken it up just a bit.  Wine is key to making this five star!  Used Pinot Grigio.

Very Good. I had my first taste of Schnitzel at a local restaurant and really liked it, so I decided to try it. This recipe was good and easy. I did make the following changes. I used only 2 packs of mushroom gravy mix, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. I seasoned my gravy mixture with parsley, garlic powder, and salt. I sauted some onions and added to the gravy mixture. Additionally, I seasoned the pork cutlets with salt and pepper before dipping them in the egg batter.

I wasn't real impressed with this recipe.  First off, the meat shouldn't be cubed - schnitzel is cooked as a whole cutlet of meat, either chicken, veal, or pork.  Even making that change, though, I found the dish uninspiring and rather bland.  I think the addition of seasonings to the gravy would improve it dramatically.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  He ate it while he was stationed in Germany.  The taste was awesome. The only alteration to the recipe was I salt and peppered the cubed pork before dredging it in the egg mixture.  Will make this again!

Best served fresh and hot. I added mushrooms to my gravy to make a better gravy, I recommend adding some salt and pepper to the pork for better flavor.

My husband spent 7 years in Germany on two different tours, when I told him I wanted to try this, he said "fine but I Am not going to eat it" as he hated it when he lived in Germany. So the verdict is in and he can't wait for me to make it again..... A+ 5 star in our household, to include our 5 picky children...

Very good, but agree the meat should be boneless chops or tenderloin, sprinkled with garlic powder and pounded.  I used Panko bread crumbs. Then after browning meat I simmered in a combo of mushroom gravy mix and cream of mushroom soup for extra tenderness.  Turned out great!

This recipe was a little tough for me to do, but it was worth it in the end.  My meat loving family thought it was great!  I ended up sneaking some whole wheat pasta to give them a little fiber in the meal.  Overall a very good experience.  Thank you for sharing.  :-)

I really enjoyed the recipe.  I even took the mushroom sauce recipe from the back of the envelope of gravy mix, and added red wine and garlic powder to the recipe.  It tastes so good.

I made 2 changes. I made it gluten free using gluten free bread crumbs. I used my food processor to pulverize the bread then toasted it in the oven on 350 until dry. I then gave it a second spin in the food processor to make it more fine. I also added almond flour to it.  Secondly I gave them a light coating of gluten free flour before dipping them in egg.

I followed the instructions pretty much exactly.  turned out great.  I served it over pasta, which was a perfect fit.   the sauce for the schnitzel would have been a good standalone sauce for pasta.

Be careful not to overcook the pork!  mine came out a little tough

This wasn't bad.  I am not a huge fan of pork, but this turned out to be pretty good.  If I was going to make it again, I would marinate the meat for at least 24 hours to give it more flavor and I would add spices to the bread crumbs or else add spices to the egg mixture, as it was rather bland.  But it cooked up ok and we made a gravy that had lots of onions and mushrooms that added greatly to the taste.  Overall, most everyone loved it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  It was easy and quick to make, which is rare for me, haha.  My only complaint is that it could be a bit more clear in how much oil is needed for frying.  I wasn't sure if it was a small amount for a quick pan-fry, or if I needed a larger amount to almost deep-fry it in the pan.  I did enough canola oil to where it came up about half-way on my pork, and that seemed to work well enough.  For the cubed confusion, I would suggest changing the ingredient name to "pork cube steak" or some variation like that.  Again, excellent meal and my husband cleaned his plate very quickly.  We will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is very good and easy. I made a gravy type of sauce, since I did not have the mix. I used Chef John's recipe for Smothered Pork Chops. He makes a buttermilk based gravy for those chops, so I used it and it was just perfect. His sauce yields a thick sauce like the one you make with the packed mix except that it is made from scratch without additives. Next time, I will try to get Spatzle instead of egg noodles.

We loved it!  I did add a pinch of salt and some seasoned pepper to the panko bread crumbs, but everything else to the letter! I don't know why it says 2 hours to cook, it only took about 8 minutes and that was for the noodles. We definitely make again!

Not egg noodles--it's more authentic with Spaetzle as the photo seems to show.

It was ok. The family (kids mostly) liked it. I actually added garlic salt and some pepper while the pork was cooking. I also wanted to try something other than noodles so I made potato dumplings (no one liked those). Soon, I'm going to doctor it up next time and either do the noodles or some other starch. The gravy was fine.

Do NOT chop up the pork or chicken.  Pound it thin, then run it through the egg mixture, flour, breadcrumbs, etc. A little salt and pepper, garlic, and/or Lawry's would be good.  Learn to make your own mushroom gravy, it's easy. Its just Butter, Flour, Beef Stock, sautéed onions and mushrooms added, flavor with a little garlic, salt and pepper, and a bay leaf, and you'll feel like a real chef.  Serve with mashed potatoes. Get the recipe for Houston's braised red cabbage and it'll be about as German as you can get.

Turned out well, made the gravy with half water, and half cream according to the package directions.  Cooked mushrooms with some garlic until they released their juice then made the sauce.   Seasoned the bread crumbs prior to coating the pork.  Also hammered the schnitzel pretty thin to ensure I could fry them golden brown and still cook through the pork.

Turned out great, and everyone enjoyed it.  I would suggest making it with french fries if you want it to be homemade authentic, that or real spaetzel, which is similar to wide egg noodles.

As others stated, I chose not to cube my meat, but otherwise it was exactly as I had expected.  I did add a little seasoning to my breading (garlic, onion, salt, pepper) because that's just what I do. Used flour and egg to coat it, pan fried in my skillet, served with mushroom gravy over egg noodles.  Kept my mushrooms on the chunkier side because we like some mushrooms up in here!

This is a very easy dish to make and it tastes wonderful. I was confused about the cubed part at first because I was thinking it meant cut up into cubes but then I realized it meant cubed pork as in the way it is tenderized. Works great with pork chops or cubed pork.
