This was so good!! I made this last night. Simple recipe that can be thrown together in a matter of minutes. My whole family loved it. The only change I made was using the Italian Cheese and Herb cooking creme from Philadelphia instead of the chive and onion cream cheese.

Definitely a hit with my fairly picky man. It's hard to go wrong with a robust red sauce, bacon, and cheese stuffed tortellini. Delicious and satisfying.

This is very tasty and is a wonderful, quick one-pot meal!  I added a whole chopped onion and let that sweat out with the garlic.  I topped it with some grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese.  You could also top it with some chopped fresh basil.

Very good. I doubled the amount of bacon, and used regular cream cheese, just sliced up green onions, and added them at the same time.

VERY YUMMY!  I didn't have the seasoned tomato sauce, seasoned diced tomatoes, or chives in my cream cheese, so I just used regular sauce, tomatoes and cream cheese and ADDED the spices.  I really liked this recipe.

great and very easy - I ended up just adding the spices to plain canned tomatoes and tomato sauce, and chives and dried onions to the cream cheese, since it was what I had on hand.

Very easy to make, but the flavor was much too sweet for my family's taste.  I've not cooked with cream cheese before and not sure what to substitute for next time.  Maybe I'll try it again and just omit the cream cheese/cheese aspect entirely.  Loved how easy to make though!!

This recipe was amazing not only was it fast and easy to make but it's absolutely delicious!!!! While my tortellini was cooking I cokked the bacon although the recipe said to take bacon out I left it in the pan and went ahead and added my garlic at the same time so that could cook as well. Aside from that I followed the recipe to a T and everything was fabulous!! Definitely a keeper!!

What a fantastic easy dinner. My husband and son both love it as well and always ask me to make a double batch so there is left overs for lunches. The only thing I do is add shredded cheese at the end mmmmmmm will make this over and over again!!

I liked this dish, but something about the onion and chive cream cheese just didn't taste quite right.  Next Time I make this, I might just use plain cream cheese or some heavy cream.

I gave it a three. I admit, I used regular cream cheese and tortellini that you boil instead of frozen. I probably won't try it again, but it was good and I'll eat the leftovers for lunch.

Excellent! I honestly think does not need anything else! I actually increased the servings to have a remnant of sauce to freeze for later. The minute I tried it, the cheesy flavor brought some childhood memories of my mom making white spaghetti for me! None of the flavors are overpowering it is just a perfect recipe!

So-so.  Okay...I don't generally use canned tomatoes, processed cream cheese, pasta that is not homemade or frozen any vegetable, so I had to actually purchase the ingredients to make this dish.  I did so thinking it would be a great go-to-very busy night kind of thing...and we are VERY busy! Yes, it is quick but really... kind of not good.  Reminded me of my Hamburger Helper college days.  Maybe my kids and husband are spoiled, half finished plates and "what's for desert" means I won't be making this again.
