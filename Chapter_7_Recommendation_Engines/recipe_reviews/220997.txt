This pie is absolutely delicious!!  Just a note about it being too watery:  If you aren't doing a lattice top crust, it will definitely be too watery, because not enough liquid can steam out.  I don't recommend doing a crust die, either, unless it's one that cuts out about half of the crust, because it will otherwise not release enough steam.  Additionally, you should allow the caramel sauce to cool quite a bit before adding it to the pie, to the point where it's like a  thick syrup.  The added cooling allows for more water to evorate from there as well.  Also, don't cut your apples too small, or they will release even more liquid as they begin to break down; I suggest no more than six slices per apple.  This helps keep it from turning into an applesauce filling as well.  Finally, the pie MUST cool completely before you cut it.  This will allow the apples to take up some of the liquid they released before, allow even more liquid to evaporate, as well as allow the sugars to congeal.  That's it!  Enjoy this delicious pie!!

I have tried several apple pie recipes (including Grandma Ople's) only to be disappointed...until this one! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and did a thing or two from my own experience. First, Cut the apples into 8 pieces each. I use 5 large or 6 small/medium Pink Lady or Cripps Pink apples. Second, make sure the sugar mixture is cooled off. I prepare the mixture first, and cut up my apples while it is cooling. Then simply toss the apples in the mixture before pouring them into the crust. Once the lattice top is on, brush the crust with 1 beaten egg, and then evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon white sugar over the crust. This is finally a go to apple pie recipe for me!

I made this apple pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, but I made a few changes. One of the reviews  suggested to make the caramel sauce thicker by adding 3 Tbsp of flour to the melted butter before adding the water and sugars. I also used around 6 apples that were cut pretty thin. When the caramel sauce is cool, layer the apples and caramel sauce. I put a layer of apples, then I drizzled a layer of caramel sauce amd then another layer of apples then caramel sauce and so on which I used probably half of the mixture, the rest I poured on the top of the pie on the lattice strips... I also used a different pie crust that is flaky called the best ever pie crust on this website. My picture is the one posted on November 28, 2013. People couldn't believe that I made it being only 14. :)

To make the caramel sauce thicker, add 3 Tbsp of flour to the melted butter(roux) before adding the water and then sugars.  The apple selection is critical when making a good apple pie.  If your pie turned to soup or mush or collapsed it was the fault of your apples NOT this recipe.  Granny Smith might be too tart and firm for some. Try Winesap, Braeburn, Pink Lady, Gala in season.  Firm, sweet, spicy.  Not soft.  I know many people that swear by golden delicious but I have never had them make a good pie.  July apples make for a great pie during the summer months.

Quite an easy pie! I used the Pillsbury crust, and it tasted really great in this receipe.  Do the lattice he shows in the video.  Easy and pretty!  My son loved this pie.  I added 2 extra apples and extra cinnamon (about a tbsp).  My only complaint was that the pie was very runny.  I cut a few pieces and then drained off about 1/2 at least of liquid from the pie plate before I retuned it to the fridge.  Perhaps I did not boil the caramel sauce long enough.  I think the pie was fully cooled.  I would make this again, but I think I might add a couple of tbsp of flour in with the apples to thicken things up a bit.

It's important to use BAKING apples in this pie. Repeat after me: "Granny Smith". Be sure to let the caramel sauce cool before pouring onto the lattice crust and bake the pie on the lowest rack in your oven.
Fantastic recipe!

I followed the recipe just as it was.  After reading the reviews, I was concerned about the filling being watery. I have had that problem with pies in the past. I did cook the sauce as per the recipe and let it come to a rolling boil.  Then let it cool.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples and cut them into 8 slices per half. Using the boxed pie crust that just unrolls, was so easy! Did the lattice top. I debated if I should use the cornstarch or flour and decided not to.  I did just as Chef John said and poured the sauce over the top of the pie...lattice and all.  Put the pie on cookie sheet and baked as directed for the first 15 minutes. Then put a pie ring around the edge and finished baking at 350 degrees.  I let it cool on the cookie sheet. I was pleasantly surprised that my pie came out like it the recipe!!  Loved the simple flavor of the buttery, cinnamon sauce with the tart apples! I am sure there are many variations that can be added, but if you want a pretty, delicious, homemade pie...this is one to try!  I'm making one to take to Thanksgiving Dinner. That is saying a lot because there is a lot of pressure to make something that everybody is going to like!  Thanks Chef John for another successful recipe!

I followed the directions exactly. I even lightly floured the apples to try to ensure it would set up and I got soup. Yummy soup, but soup. Not really sure how to fix this. Won't be making this one again.

The carmel sauce is amazing. I always add a palm full of tapioca granuals to my apple pies and I never have a runny pie. (They absorb the extra liquid and can't be seen in the pie.) My Grandma's secret!

i would give this 10 stars if i could. This recipe is a no brainer. i have made it sooo many times, and it only failed me once when i forgot the caramel sauce on the stove. it burned (duh), but the apple pie STILL didnt taste so bad. i have left the pie in the oven too long a few times, but its kind a hard to burn. i have made it for so many different occasions, and have been asked for the recipe almost every time. in a girl scouts baking competition once, it got 11/10 and we won, and blv it or not, the judge didnt like Apple pie. i REALLY recommend this to any and every one (who has the patience to cut and peel apples) who likes apple pie. my whole family used to like apple pie and we used to get it sometimes from the local grocery store, but since i made this (when i was 12-that was the first time) other apple pies taste pretty bland. MAKE THIS> YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!

Overall i really liked this recipe! There are wild apple trees near my house, so I picked those and used them in the pie instead of buying from the store. I am not sure what kind they are, but they are firm, and a good balance of sweet/tart. I like a more complex spice flavor, so when I made the sauce I added a bit more cinnamon, a couple sprinkles of pumpkin pie spice mix (allspice, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon), one whole clove crushed, and a splash of pure vanilla extract. The resulting flavor was AMAZING! After cutting the apples, I tossed them in a few tablespoons of flour to coat them to help absorb some of the liquid, as many reviewers mentioned they had a lot of excess juice. This did help the final product, though there was still a little more juice than I like. Next time i will add a bit more flour to coat the apples, and I will also cook the caramel sauce a minute or two longer to try to get it a bit thicker. I did a lattice top pie and used Chef John's recipe for Easy Homemade Pie Crust which came out beautifully. I would not do a "closed" top pie with this recipe because i fear there would be a lot more juice trapped in there. The lattice top helps with the evaporation of the juice. Will definitely be making again with the next batch of apples I pick!

I made this pie for 4th of July & my family went nuts for it! Simple & easy to make. If you use an apple peeler/corer/slicer to cut up your apples, you may wanna add another apple or two to the recipe to fill the pie a bit more.

This recipe was very easy and it did taste really good but it seemed to shrink down too much for me. The recipe called for 5 apples and I think i will double that amount the next time I make it and double the caramel sauce too. But it really is good.

I used this recipe after looking at several others yet i was still skeptical as to whether it would be great or come out like soup. i needed to make this for my catering exam in school and it was amazing. These were important GCSE'S for me and it couldnt have gone better. i had the highest marks in class, 37/40 and my teacher and other teachers (who had good food knowledge of tastes etc.) said "it was the best i have ever had" and they were not joking. It was not like soup at all. the pastry was perfect too (i used chef johns homemade pie crust). If i were to give any tips it would be make sure your slices are a good thickness nobody wants thin and soggy apple slices. And to help you weave your pastry just dust them in flour again. The first time i did them they were slightly sticky and very hard to weave, by flouring them they stuck together better and were easier to handle. so if you see the negative comments, ignore them and go for this recipe they just havent done it right.

I tried this as an experiment at Thanksgiving -- we had several other pies and desserts, so I figured that if it was a flop there were plenty of other choices. It turned out to be excellent and a very popular choice on our dessert table. It was given a solid thumbs up by everyone who tried it. It will now join the usual choices (pumpkin, pecan, blackberry-blueberry one crust pie, pumpkin roll). It was such an easy way to make a freshly-baked apple pie on Thanksgiving morning before the turkey goes into the oven.

I tossed the very thinly sliced, but unpeeled Gala apples with 2 tablespoons of AP flour, as Chef John suggested as an option. I also used the maximum amount of apples. This was the sum total of the tinkering I did with the recipe. My daughter and I share the Thanksgiving cooking, and she very carefully tucked away the caramel-sauce splattered recipe print out for next year. It's a real keeper!

Fabulous!  I used this recipe for the first time yesterday.  I made two pies.  I used 5 granny smiths for each pie.  

I used a Better Homes pie crust recipe (2 cups flour, 2/3 cup shorting (I used butter flavored)), 1 tsp salt and 6 tbs ice water.  I put the balls of pastry dough in the freezer for 30 minutes.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did let the caramel sauce cool while I rolled out the crust and sliced the apples.  I sliced each apple into 6 slices.  I brushed the bottom crust with egg white.  I did pour all of the sauce through the lattice and then brushed the entire lattice to make sure it got covered with sauce.  I let the pie completely cool before cutting it.

There was a very small amount of liquid when I cut the pie later in the day.  The next day, there was none.  So, cooking a day ahead looks best from what I saw.

My family loved this apple pie.  It is definitely the best apple pie I have made.  I got some very high complements from my friend and his family.  So, they liked it too.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I won't use it again, sorry. I love all Chef John's recipes and had high expectations. This was kind of a let down.  It tasted delicious but completely soaked through my pie crust and make more of a soggy apple soup instead of a pie.  I followed the recipe exactly. I guess I could go through the recipe more carefully and find ways to make it less watery, but with so many other amazing pie recipes out there, it's not worth the trouble.

We really liked the flavor but I didn't care for how watery the filling was. I served it with vanilla ice cream and poured some of the filling over the ice cream. I've read through the reviews and next time I will add less water to the caramel sauce; cook the caramel sauce a few minutes for evaporation of liquids; completely cool the caramel sauce and toss the apple wedges in 3 tablespoons of corn starch or flour. Hopefully it will then be a 5 star pie.

Not as hard as I thought. With some patience and dexterity, all your friends and family will want to try it. I'd also recommend using making own pastry dough.

This is really sweet!....as I figured it would be with a cup of sugar, but wanted to make it to recipe.  Not that it is a bad thing as it tasted good, but just too rich for our taste.  It was an easy pie to throw together and help celebrate the coming in of fall!  Thanks Chef John!

I add about 1.4 cup of flour to this, and it makes it perfect! Just enough to thicken the caramel sauce! Yummy! I also back this on a deep cookie sheet, with parchment paper underneath it, as this has a tendency to bubble over and being on the cookie sheet with the paper cuts the clean up time in half! This is one of my go-to recipes for potlucks and holidays, and everyone loves it!

The apple filling ended up being watery. I suggest add flour.  The crust on the other hand was amazing with the caramel topping.

Very good recipe but a little runny, add less water to caramel sauce and flour to the apples.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  My pie is the consistency of water.  I'm a good baker usually and tried something new and super bummed it didn't turn out.  Tastes pretty good but I have cinnamon /sugar apple juice with cooked apples and a crust.

Absolutely delicious!!!! I boiled the sugar and butter per the recipe, cooled it, then added the apples and warmed it up again. Let them marinate for about an hour before putting the apples in my pie. Resulted in sweet-tart, melt-in-your-mouth fruit once the pie came out of the oven. Incredible!

Tossed the apple slices with a little lemon juice and a few tablespoons of sugar - refrigerated and then made pie later.  Also, used a store brand pre-made pie crust.  Tasted great and was easy to make.  Just be sure to cover the crust edge with tin foil while baking - uncover about 10 minutes before done baking pie to brown the crust.  Otherwise, crust edges get way too brown.  Will definitely make again!  Will make crust from scratch if I have a little more time.

So tasty.  My only problem was the pie crust just under the rim of pie was really stuck to the pan.  Curious if anyone knows why that might have happened?  Didn't crimp tight enoughmaybe? I still gave 5 stars because of its delicious flavor.  In my experience it isn't a pie that is going to cut and plate like something from a magazine but the flavor is so good no one is going to care!  Before cutting it was beautiful.  I didn't have gala apples, used a michigan variety and I did toss apples in two tablespoons of flour like Chef John mentioned.  Yum.  Thanks Chef John.

Wow. The Best apple pie I have Ever made! I followed the directions Exactly and ended up with a beautiful pie that earned rave reviews! Definately a 5 star keeper. The best reviewer advice, was to completely let the syrup cool, before adding. Thanks, Chef John!

I tried this for 2, we ate the entire pie in a matter of days; so I then made 2 more. Same thing. Then I made a couple for our entire family get-together at Christmas, 2013. This is THE BEST apple pie recipe on so many levels but mainly delicious & easy. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. If this is any indication of the quality of Chef John's recipes, I'm definitely going to look at his other offerings. This recipe is superb!

This pie was the best apple pie I have ever had.  I made sure to cool the caramel sauce before pouring it over a very open lattice top, to make sure that there was space for evaporation.  I used it with the "French Pastry Pie Crust" from this website.  I cut each apple into 8-10 slices to keep them pretty big.  Near the end of the cooking time, I noticed that the crust was getting overdone but the sauce wasn't super bubbly yet, so I lowered the rack in the oven, and checked on it frequently.  I think I left it in about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  But it was divine.

Wow, this is good!  Even with the caramel sauce, this pie is not over sweet.

For me, next time, I will add about 1 Tablespoon of flour to the sauce, because it is a little runny...tastes wonderful, but I prefer it a bit thicker.

The caramel sauce was AMAZING!! I've tried to make caramel apple pie before with pre-made Kraft caramels, and this just made my life sooooo much easier and tastier! It was definitely a soupy pie and the juices would go SO WELL with vanilla bean ice cream, but if you like your apple pie a little dryer, add some corn starch to the apples. Other than that, this pie was slap-yer-momma good!

My two teenage sons made this pie (their first ever) for Thanksgiving to bring to our friends' house...YES, we took a big risk, but boy, did it pay off!  It was so delicious, and out of the five pies there, it was the first to go :) The only change they made was adding one tablespoon of flour to the caramel sauce (since they forgot to toss it w/ the apples).  PERFECTION!  Thanks Chef John...we're making another one tomorrow.  Definitely our go-to apple pie recipe!

This is one of the best tasting pies I've ever eaten. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star rating for me is the fact that it was so full of liquid when I was done. I read the other reviews before making the pie and prepared for this by flouring up my apples and putting a layer of flour on the bottom crust and it still didn't help. I think I'll cut the amount of butter and water in the caramel sauce next time.

I went apple picking and came back with a bushel of apples.  I was stressing on what to do with all these apples.    I googled easy apple pie recipe and this one came up    It’s so easy that I’m making so many pies and I’m giving them away.   The most wonderful thing is that people are telling me this is the best apple pie them ever had.  Easy and delicious......way to go John!!!!!

Easy to make. Used my own pie crust recipe. Spooned the cooked sugar mixture over apples and reserved some to brush on pie crust instead as I only cut 8 slits in lieu of making lattice. A wonderful taste and texture and will definitely make again. Thank you for this recipe!

Best apple pie I've ever eaten!  Followed the recipe exactly, using Granny Smith and Pink Lady apples.  So delicious!  Not runny if you wait until pie is completely cool.  I will never make any other apple pie recipe!

THIS pie is fantastic! Historically, apple pie was always good,  but not  necessarily a preference for me.  However, this particular pie is a list topper now; not only because it is in big demand by all my family and friends, (so I make it often), but also because it is now a personal favorite for me, as well!!!

Chef John..you did the  thing with this recipe!! My only variation was I parcooked my apples a bit because I make fried apples as a breakfast dish. I used the Pillsbury crust and put a tbsp of caramel sauce in my apples while cooking. My caramel sauce cooled a little and was thicker than yours but the end result was fabulous. Not bad for a first timer who usually does Marie Callendar/Mrs. Smith lol. I may blind bake my bottom crust next time but this is a winner for sure!! Thanks again!!

I used 1/8 cup of water after reading reviews and baked for 1 hr 20 mins at 350. The results were a crispy apple pie that the family said was better than grandmas. No soup for me!

I made it following the instructions completely. The pie was very disappointing. After taking it from the oven and letting it sit for a few hours, it was still runny. I put it in the refrigerator hoping it would thicken. It did not thicken at all. It had little flavor, and I was especially disappointed it had no caramel flavor. I have previously made my own caramel for other recipes, and I think it is the short time for the cooking that is the problem, along with not enough spices.  I would not recommend this recipe. It was a waste of Granny Smith apples.

I followed the directions and got the same watery result. I have a feeling that when you make the caramel sauce you need to actually make caramel, not just bring it to a boil but simmer until it thickens. It would be nice if there was a suggestion as to what type of apple should be used.

*update* I tried it again,  simmering until the sugar mixture  thickened and it still came out watery. I suggest using a traditional thickener like flour or cornstarch  :(

I had read all the comments before I made this so I knew it was going to be watery. I thought that not adding the water that the recipe called for would help, but it didn't. I even tried both types of crust tops. Great taste, but too watery. The only other thing I can think of it to use dehydrated apples.

I have been baking and cooking for 10 years, and never in my life have I made a concoction called apple pie soup! Oh, you say its named caramel apple pie??? No its not, it's apple pie soup! Normally I listen to overall reviews when following a recipe, but I did the opposite this time, and like everyone says in the comments. This is soup! Don't waist your time with this recipe.

I added lemon to the apples and then coated them with flour for a thicker sauce.

I second what everyone keeps writing about the pie being too runny. It happened to me, and I did add the additional flour.  But my worst complain is that the caramel mix tastes great but it gets way too diluted when cooked with the apples.  I just think that this apple pie recipe is off. (sorry do not mean to be critical, it is my honest opinion).

I have made pie using this recipe so many times people just expect it to be on the table whenever they come over. I cook the sauce down quite a bit now because the first time I made this it leaked in my oven and made a biiiig mess. This is a great and simple recipe and we really enjoy it. Thank you!

I followed the directions to the tea. The sauce turned watery during cooking ruining the bottom crust. Needed more cinnamon. I would toss the apples in flour and boil the sauce longer if I tried it again.

Followed all directions on the sauce, crust, and apples, and still pulled a VERY watery pie out of the oven.  After completely cooling and refrigerating, some of the liquid was reabsorbed, but left the crust a little mushy.  Would not make this pie again.  I did really like the recommended pie crust recipe.

Great flavor, but more of a cobbler consistency (excess liquid).  This needs a binder.  I did use the lattice top, so there was plenty of time for excess moisture to escape, but still too runny.  I think next time I will add just a little cornstarch to the sauce.

This recipe is basically no fail! I've tried so many Apple pie recipes even from some top rated pie shops and I must say everytime I've made this it comes out fantastic! I do a couple of things different and I've even done this with a crumble topping DELICIOUS!

Just popped in the oven, and forgot to read reviews.  So far it's baking like a charm.  The syrup was a little warm, so I hope that's going to remedy itself.  I did add at least 2 tsp. of cinnamon as hubby always asks for more cinnamon.  So far, I think this is going to be my go-to apple pie.  Next time I'll brush top crust with egg and sugar per one's advise.

I used yellow delicious apples from my FIL's tree and ended up doubling the recipe. After reading the reviews, I omitted the water out of it. Used 3/4 cup of each sugars. Instead of using 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, I used 2 tablespoons of apple pie spice. Instead of pouring all of the butter/spices on top of the lattice crust, I took 1/2 of it and tossed it with the peeled/diced apples. The other 1/2, I poured on top of the lattice crust. Even though I left out the water out, the butter/spice mix got thick as it cooled. Baked as directed. Took it to Thanksgiving dinner and my FIL said that it was the best apple pie he's eaten and was honored that the apples came from his tree. My husband loved how the bottom crust soaked in the juices. We ate the pie cold and it wasn't soggy at all. It maybe a different story if the pie was warm. This will be a must make when my FIL's apple tree is ready for picking. Thanks.

I've made this recipe three times now, and all have yielded amazing results. Twice I doubled the recipe and made two pies to share with my Mom. I love the look of the golden lattice, and the sauce is delicious!

Absolutely delicious!!!  No need to make adjustments(except I prefer more cinnamon!!).  I think this is my new favorite apple pie.  It tasted even better the next day after flavors melded~ savored every bite!  Really easy to make.  I used a larger pie plate, so I increased the apples and the butter-sugar mixture.  Make sure you follow the directions and pour the mixture over the lattice crust and cook until bubbles in the middle.  Mine bubbled over, so you might want to put foil underneath.  You won't be disappointed!

This is superb-but the directions are rather vague.  I did however, cheat by using a deep-dish 9" pastry shell.  The sauce is a bit too much-I leftover sauce.  I used organic small red delicious apples-great for this pie.  I used my crunch recipe for topping-I got great raves from everyone-best pie ever made.  BTW, this is my first time ever making a fruit pie!  I will use this recipe again!! But directions needs to be more detailed..

Wonderful! My husband never eats apple pie, but said this one was the bomb! I followed the useful tips. Lightly floured the apples, cut the apples slightly bigger and allowed it to cool completely. The crust was amazing and the filling was light but sweet. This recipes stays in my recipe box! Thanks Chef John, I appreciate the videos so much.

I made this apple pie for Thanksgiving and my family ate the whole pie and asked me to make another one on the spot, lol.  They said it was the best apple pie they had ever tasted.  I will be making four of these pies for Christmas.  So, so delicious and so easy to make!  Thank you Chef John for another wonderful recipe!

First apple pie I've ever made that wasn't poored out of a can.  My husband isn't an apple pie fan per say, but it really looked yumy, so I made it a rainy day project for my 4 year old daughter and I.  I have a Pampered Chef peel/core/slicer which made this much less of a project, and more of a fun thing to do for her.  It was not only easy, but it was one of the BEST apple pie recipe's I've tasted.  My Husband Loved it!  Thank you Chef John

I made this pie for my office Thanksgiving potluck today. The flavor was delicious. The caramel is a lovely counterpoint to the tart Granny Smith apples. I used smaller organic apples, so I had to use an extra one to fill the cruist. Since several reviews mentioned the pie was too watery, I added three tablespoons of flour to the caramel mixture, and let it boil down for a little while. This combination produced caramel that was too thick when it cooled. Next time, I will add the flour only. I made the pie with the French Pastry Pie Crust from AllRecipes, which I would recommend.

OMG.. And I never say OMG!  This recipe is really, really good. I know from reading other reviews that the water measurement was in question. All I did was use a spray bottle and spray the top of the mixture to get the sauce going and the moisture level in the pie was perfect. Without a doubt, this is a five star recipe.

I made this today and it tasted very good. It comes out of the oven very pretty with the lattice top and nicely browned.  As suggested I did flower the apples but it was very runny. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I did follow it to the letter. I would consider it more of a cobbler than a pie, because no matter how long you cool it, it cannot be sliced and must be scooped.  I will  make it again because it tastes great, but will serve in bowls with ice cream.

Love it! This pie turned out amazing. I did toss the apples in a bit of flour because I like a thicker filling. The glaze on the top makes this a wonderful pie.

This pie came out AMAZING. First off, it doesn’t matter what apples you use. I only had MacIntosh apples, and yes they’re soft...but worked out. I made only 2 changes to the recipe. First make sure your apples aren’t cut to small, especially with a softer apple like I had. I added about a tablespoon

I made this pie this week, and it was my first attempt ever at an apple pie.  The flavor was wonderful; however, my pie was very soupy, as others have posted.  I would like to know the secret to a non-soupy version of this.  I had leftover apples, so I am going to attempt to make tartlets today, using this recipe but modifying it a bit.  We will see how it goes.  My hubby and daughter loved this pie, soupy and all!

First time baking an Apple Pie and this was delicious! After reading the reviews, I followed the instructions exactly. I will wait even longer next time for the caramel to cool down a lot more than I did. My husband could barley contain himself, he cut into a hour out of the oven and loved it.

My family loved it! This was my first time making an apple pie and it was so easy and delicious! Chef John makes such easy to follow recipes. My caramel was a little watery, I think I need to let it simmer and thicken longer next time. I will be making this again.

Loved this recipe.  It was simple and so delicious!! The only thing I did  different was to sprinkle dry wassail mix over the top of the pie before baking to give it a little extra oomph. My hubby said it was definitely a keeper.

I haven't made this yet. I just noticed that the apples were put directly on the bottom crust. I always mix some flour and sugar just enough to coat the  bottom crust before putting the apples in. No soggy crust and the flour helps to thicken the filling I will give it a 5 because it sounds delicious.

I used this recipe with my granddaughters helping. Instead of Fuji apples we used fresh apples that we picked at their other grandmother's house (next door).   We then took the apple pie as dessert for a family dinner and it was a huge hit with everyone.  Love the memories we made.

My husband loves apple pie, and when he was eating it, he stopped, tapped me on my shoulder and said, "Honey, this pie is really good, I mean, really good!" He has never said that about any other pies I have made, so that is saying a lot! Definitely a keeper, the recipe, and the husband :)

I loved it, turned out perfect. Wasn’t watery at all. I however didn’t count the number of apples since the size can vary so much. I just made sure to fill my pie crusts completely full of apples.

The recipe by itself was outstanding. I did dredge the apples in flour and oatmeal which sort of made it a carmel apple crisp pie. My wife and daughter who are not apple pie fans both loved it as well.

The pie did turn out with quite a bit liquid as mentioned, I cooled the sauce before pouring and made a lattice top, still juicy. Taste is fantastic, it's not soupy but I would still try to thicken it further and add more apples as it flattened out. Foil to protect the crust edge. 
*I used gala apples this time

It's good tasting but after reading the reviews about it being too watery, we got nervous and coated the apples with some flour and also we cooked the caramel sauce longer so it was thicker and it still turned out a soupy mess, we did do a lattice crust. Super disappointed.

Made the recipe as it was written. I was not happy with the boxed crust I used, but the  filling and sauce was delicious. It was a very nice pie, and I will make it again with a different crust next time.

This is virtually the exact same pie my Grandmother Hattie made!  I completely and totally love it!  

Yes, my addition/modification is I substitute the water with JACK DANIELS or JIM BEAM.  Other than that, its letter perfect and consistently perfect every time its made!

Such an easy recipe. I actually just used a store bought pre made pie crust and cut one of the crusts into strips and made the pie as outlined and it was delicious...even made the store bought crust taste good. I just used a teensy bit less water then the recipe called for so that it was a thicker Caramel syrup to pour over the pie.

The caramel sauce was too much and made the bottom crust soggy.  The taste, however, was perfect, especially when it was warmed and topped with vanilla ice cream!

I am giving this 5 stars based on my second attempt.  The first was delicious, but as so many others noted, it would be easier if eaten through a straw.  It tasted so good, I had to try again and the second time I tossed the apples with 1/4 cup of cornstarch.  It thickened nicely and could actually be sliced.  It is still very juicy which to me is a good thing.

I've made this as pie as written and it is really good, but I also adapted the filling recipe to serve as a topping/sauce for cheesecake, dutchbabies, etc. and I think it really shines that way.

This pie tastes wonderful even though I screwed around with the recipe. I like a big pie so I used  extra apples, which made it terribly runny even though I added 2 TB of cornstarch--not enough!  I salvaged it by cutting it (when cool), draining the juices and using this to make thickened caramel on the stove by adding cream and extra brown sugar, then drizzling it back on the pie. The caramel had a very apple-y flavor that was delish!  If you add extra apples, be sure to add thickener accordingly!! Also, I used Granny Smiths, which cut the sweetness nicely. Otherwise this pie was a winner.  I am a tough critic on my own baked goods but everyone will eat this pie, runny or not, especially with vanilla ice cream.

I  intended to make this recipe as written but ended up having to add some rice flour to the sauce for the apples to help thicken it up. I baked per directions but in the future I would bake it little longer to soften the apples a bit and let the pie caramelize a bit . I used a combo of honey crisp and gala apples because that is what I had on hand.

Would it even be possible to call this the best apple pie ever??? Probably not, but wow! I dashed in a little flour with the apples as suggested in the video otherwise stuck to the script for a magnificent outcome.

Wonderful recipe. This makes for an easy pie. I only changed this by adding a sprinkle of xanthum gum over the cut apples to help "gel" the mixture. Wonderful flavor. I used 100% macintosh apples.

Of the three pies I made for Thanksgovong, this was my favorite.  And one of the others was pecan!  I used Pillsbury pie crust which was delicious, and I  forget to add the water to the caramel sauce, which I realized when pouring the sauce over the pie - well, tried to pour!  It was pretty thick and I worried that it would not soak through to the apples.  But it did and it was fantastic, the perfect blend of tart and sweet apples and caramel.  This one os going tomthe top of my list!  Thank you for a perfect pie recipe!

I'm not certain if I did something wrong but this pie came out terrible. There was so much juice on the bottom the crust was soggy. I do not recommend baking this.

I wanted to try this recipe as written before i made changes.  That way it is a true review.  Otherwise what's the point?  It wasn't to runny but the bottom crust was soggy.  I baked the pie on the lower shelf in the oven because i like the crust browned on the bottom as well.  I was disappointed.  Just so you know, I bake for a living

I made this following the directions. Added 2 tablespoons of flour. It was a hit with the family and will make it again.  I did substitute Splenda and Splenda brown sugar. Also used Granny Smith apples.

I tend to research and try several recipes until I find a perfect recipe for that particular food then I add it to my favorite recipe book.
This Apple pie recipe is perfect,  I admit my lattice work still needs work but people in my family who dont usually like apple pie gobbled this pie up. Even made a gluten free crust and it's very flavorful and moist.
I even took a brush and made sure to cover the crust with some of the caramel sauce and it turned out so pretty!
The reviews were very helpful, glad I took the time to do the lattice work.
Note: also tried golden delicious and granny Smith's apples and I highly recommend the granny Smith's apples the tart in the apple balances the sweet sauce and they dont seem to have the higher water content that the golden delicious do. This is important if your worried about to much moisture.

I have to admit, I am not much of a pie baker.  But I REALLY wanted to try the caramel sauce in this recipe, so I cheated -- I bought a lattice top apple pie from the freezer section at WalMart, cooked the caramel sauce and poured it warm  over the frozen pie before baking.  I also scattered a nice handful of pecan halves on top, then baked "my pie" according to the package directions.  HOLY COW.  This lowly, store-bought frozen pie was suddenly a religious experience.  The pecans toasted up beautifully, and the caramel sauce... sigh.   Long story short, I'm adding it into the Thanksgiving dessert rotation this year.   Great recipe, and a nice little "cheat" to make an ordinary store-bought pie spectacular.

I made it again what I noticed was exactly what Jason said about water my first pie no problem I used red apples, the second pie I used Honey crisp with the weaved basket design pie crust. When I make for the third time making for friends barbecue I have to use the othe four Honey crisp apples but this time pie crust right on top not doing the weave design.
Thank you everyone for your reviews they are very helpful. Enjoy like John always says. Lol

It should be pretty obvious from the ingredients and preparation, but this isn't really "caramel". It is a pretty decent apple pie recipe though. Pouring the butter/sugar mixture over the pie does result in excellent crust.

When I first saw this recipe, I couldn't believe it could be so easy and so good.  Boy!  was  I surprised.  I have since made it a number of times and each time to rave reviews.  I have tried it with different  type apples, and one time tried two different kinds (because that is what I had).  That time it came out a bit too juicy.  No matter what apples I use it is always delicious.  Chef John is aces again!

followed the recipe exactly.  Made two pies that were not deep dish.  Not runny.  Made the lattice crust using the recipe for Basic Pie crust from this site.  It was gone in 5 min.  My two teenagers devoured it.

No changes needed.  I was a while preparing the pie and lattice top and by the time I poured the caramel sauce over top it was very thick.  I didn't think it would flow down well but it did and the family raved about it!

I love this recipe, I use it anytime I need to make an apple pie.  It's so simple and delicious.  I generally like my pie to be a bit more stiff, so I add flour and cinnamon to the apples before putting them into the pie crust.  And I make sure it's cooled before cutting into, otherwise it becomes a bit of a sloppy mess.

This has become a family favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My brothers actually request it. I do add some corn starch to the apples to help thicken the sauce.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. I used Granny Smith Apples, and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the caramel sauce after removing from the heat.  I also allowed the caramel sauce to cool thoroughly before adding to the pie.  It looks amazing, but I can't give it a taste test yet as it is a gift. I will definitely make this again.

My whole family loved this apple pie. I've made it a few times now without changing any of the recipe proportions. I read all the reviews about it being too runny. Mine was not, the trick to avoid that is to let your caramel sauce cool completely. It thickens as it sits and the pie will not be too soupy. Great recipe for a crisp clean tasting apple pie. Forgot to say, please peel the apples first. That is one change I made.

I’m afraid I am on the side of those who do not care for this. I used a recommended apple, followed the directions exactly, but the apples are undercooked and the juice is “soupy”. I am going to microwave it for a few minutes to see if the apples will soften up.

This time I used a combination of Golden Delicious, Braeburn, and Honey Crisp apples. I also tossed the apples in about 2 tablespoons of flour before placing them in the crust, and allowed the sauce to cool and thicken before using it, for a thicker filling. Wonderful, wonderful pie!

Oh, and one more thing: don't be afraid to really pile those apples in there. Every time I've made this pie, I've managed to forget how much the apples cook down in the oven, so I end up stopping after no more than 4 small apples. Take my advice, and trust that the pie can accommodate at least 6 apples without any trouble.

We had 6 apples that needed to be used immediately, so we tried this pie.  It was easy enough to make and the taste was great, but the pie was too watery (it was made with the lattice top) and some of the apples were somewhat crunchy.  The crust was browned and lots of the sauce had bubbled over onto the foil under the pie place.   Not sure if the problem was too many apples or what.   The next day, I put the cold pie in the oven set at 350 and cooked it for another 20 minutes (used the small top oven which preheats quickly).  That did it!  The pie had a perfect consistency, no extra liquid, and we loved the caramel topped pie crust.  Will never go back to making a traditional apple pie.  This is so much easier and better!

Soup - I followed the recipe exactly.  Caramel on top of lattice set but this recipe does not account for the apple juice that bakes out.  Wish I had read all the reviews first and would have tried another.  What a waste of an afternoon.  And I don't have much open time to bake.

I have made this pie numerous times and it is truly delicious.  It is always the first dessert to be finished.  This year, I prepared the pie and froze it for the first time.  I will bake it on Thanksgiving Day.  I am hoping it will be as wonderful as it usually is. I will update this review after the holiday. Fingers crossed

I love Chef John Caramel Apple Pie. It was very easy to make and l like the Gala Apples too. Very sweet taste. I won’t be buying store brought pies anymore they don’t taste the same as homemade. I made the pie the exact recipe and on Chef John video. I used only 4 apples instead of 5 because I like a lot of crust too. I also left the peeling on the apples the way I saw on Chef John Video and the taste still was great. I didn’t use pillsbury crust I used store brought crust I brought from Smart and Final store called Immaculate Ready to bake pie crust and crust was flaky delicious.   Thank you Chef John for this incredible recipe. ?? Priscilla

This was my very first apple pie. I used 7 small Fuji apples, which was what I had in hand at the time. I skipped the white sugar and floured the apples, following some popular reviews, also added some other spices.
For the crust, I used the suggested recipe.
The results:
-crust was excellent, flaky, crispy and buttery. Will be making again.
-apples were tender and well cooked, but lacked a little bit of moisture, sweetness and spices, for my taste.
-the amount of filling could be easily doubled for me. I believe the apples I used were too small compared to the ones americans usually 
Conclusions:
-the alterations I made to chef Jhon's recipe didn't pay off, next time I'll follow it more strictly, except for the extra spicing, that I would definitely recommend.

This is a very good recipe. I did not read the reviews first, and mine came out very soupy, and the apples weren't cooked enough to my liking. They were still kind of crunchy. I followed the cooking time to a T. Anyway, not all is lost. After I had a slice, all of the juice settled into the slice I removed. I removed some of the juice, put it in a bowl and stirred in a couple of tablespoons of flour. I then poured it all over the pie, and put in back in the oven at 375 degrees for 25 minutes!! It came out perfect!! I hope this tip helps for those of you who have a soupy pie.

This is the best apple pie I have ever eaten. I put 3 heaping tablespoons of flour tossed in my apples, but it could have used more. Note to self: put pie to bake on a baking sheet!! I used a store bought pie dough but will make my own crust next time. I didn’t wait until it was cool when I cut it, but will let it cool down next time. The best apple pie! Thank you, Chef John!

I made a few changes to give it more depth.  Increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp,  replaced the 1/4 c water to 1/4 dark rum, and added 2 Tbsp of APF into the cooled caramel.  The rum gives it an "ooomph" to the taste and the Alll Purpose flour keeps it from being runny;  although when I made the first time.  It wasnt that runny  - because I put a lattice topper, as suggested.    I love apple pie and with my change - i renamed this a "Caramel rum apple pie!"  ENJOY!

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I watched the video and followed the recipe to a T.  I used Pink Lady apples.  I cooked my caramel a little extra just to make sure it was far enough along in it's candy stage.  I cooled it thoroughly so it was nice and thick.  And I used a lattice top crust.  And when the pie came out the apples on the top were still crispy and not even in the juice.  And all I had was watery liquid.  Someone else said they had soup....I would have loved soup!  It sounds thicker than what I had which was watery brown sugar, cinnamon liquid with crispy apples.  Very bummed this didn't turn out.  But luckily it was only one of our Thanksgiving pies.  For what it's worth my pumpkin pie was also a Chef John recipe and I would give it five stars.  It was very good.

I followed the recipe but the outcome was not as good as expected.  The apples & the crust were not as tasty with caramel flavor as Chef John led me to believe.  
   I will try this again perhaps with a tweek to the caramel mix & the cook time.

My family truly enjoyed this pie.  The only thing I would do different the next time is I would use a 10 inch pie crust.  I used 5 large Gala apples and a 9 1/2 pie plate.  My crust was not large enough to seal as needed.  The filling poured over in the bottom of the pie plate.  However, it was great and Easy to make.

Like most of the reviews here I made it and it was soupy! Even though I did lattice it it was all water, but it tasted great! 
I decided to make it again so I did a few things differently

First I took the apples, sugars and cinnamon and mixed them together and let that sit for about 45 minutes, then I drained it and used the liquid with the butter (did not add water) to make the caramel sauce and let it reduce by a bit. I added a little bit of flour to the apples and proceeded with the recipe

It was perfect! moist yet not soupy and so flavorful! My bf- who isn't a fan of apple pie, proceeded to nearly eating the entire thing

I wish I could rate it 4.5 stars because I would just like to tweak it just a little bit. I made it exactly as stated  with a lattice top, larger slices of apples and let it cool completely and it was still a bit watery.  However! I just spooned the liquid right over the pie after I cut it because the sauce was delicious!

The only thing I can imagine could have made the difference is that I had to use a couple more apples than stated because mine were smaller (Granny Smith). 

I would definitely make it again but maybe try to make it just a bit less watery.

I make this pie regularly and it is the family favorite. I have found it needs to be made with exactly  9 Granny Smith apples. Yes, that is a 3 lb. bag. It sounds like a lot but it does cook down.   Bake until apples are tender. If you overbake  it you will get applesauce! I also add a pinch of nutmeg.

I’ve made this multiple times for holidays and other people, no one has complained yet.  It is the closest I can find to how my grandma made her apple pie every thanksgiving growing up.  The caramel sauce can be somewhat sweet if you want to slightly lower your white sugar content.  I also use a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and sliced my apples  into eighths. I spread some of the caramel sauce on the bottom pie crust then put in the apples, poured on more caramel, topped with the lattice and poured on the rest of the sauce. After the allotted baking time, I pulled the pie out and the apples were still very hard. I put it back in and tented it with some foil and let it go another 30 minutes and still not done, not bubbling, nothing. I used Granny Smiths and Fujis and I've never had a fruit pie not cook. So, next time, and there will be a next time, I'll slice the apples thin and see what happens.

The only thing I did different from the video (but the same as the ingredients list in the recipe) was use Granny Smith apples; the tart was a great complement to the sweet of the caramel. I cut and served a little too soon, so it fell apart a bit. The next time I make it (Christmas this weekend), I'll let it cool longer and set up fully before digging in. Otherwise, great recipe! Very easy and the flavor was amazing.

I used Honey Crisp apples. I used a little less of the sugar mixture as many other reviewers commented on how sweet the pie was. I increased the dough mix as another reviewer said the ratio was not balanced. It was a big hit!

I had made a caramel apple pie before but this one of Chef John's had more of that caramel flavor I was looking for.  The overall taste of this pie was delicious.  I made it exactly as written and I would strongly suggest you bake on a cookie sheet as it will bubble over into your oven.

I made this recipe as written for Thanksgiving. Last year I made a different recipe which called for store bought caramels which didn't fully melt into the baked pie. I chose this recipe because it's made with a homemade caramel sauce instead of yucky store bought caramels. While the pie looks and smells fabulous, I was disappointed it came out watery.  Luckily it was just for us so I poured the excess liquid out. I'm not sure if I would make this again after seeing how much liquid came out of the finished pie.

I've made this for every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last few years and it's always awesome. I have struggled with some watery-ness, so I add cornstarch to the apples. I also doctor the apples with extra brown sugar! It's great!

The first time I made this, I followed exactly from the recipe, and the liquid mixture did not firm up and stay in the pie. Since, I have tweaked it where I add 2 tbsp of corn starch to the mixture and it makes the pie not run everywhere when you cut it. Tastes better too. Everyone has loved this pie every time I make it!!

Very good! I did toss my apples in a little cinnamon, sugar and flour mix. Glad I did!
I think I will precook the apples next time as the Granny Smiths  were not as tender as I like. My filling consisted of Honey Crisp, MacIntosh and the Granny Smiths . Love the flavor of that  combination. Chef John has never failed me. I'll be making this again for Thanksgiving!

I've made this many times in the past and I've followed the recipe to a T and loved it. I made some today and finally made a few tweaks. Instead of using the pillsbury pie crust, I used thawed puff pastry.  I made made muffin-sized versions of these and wanted to make sure that the caramel was not too thin so I tossed the apples in a couple spoons of flour. As for baking time, I baked it at 425 til the crust was golden brown, about 13 minutes and then  turn it down to 350 til the caramel was bubbling, which was about another 3 minutes... They turned out perfect! The sauce was thickened... the puff pastry was thick enough to keep everything together so you can just pick it up and eat it without making a huge mess. I also used a silicon muffin tray so  it was easy to pop them out.  I love this recipe simply because it's delicious and this was one of the first things I made when I was learning to bake.

My husband said this was the best apple pie he ever ate. It was absolutely delicious. I sprinkled the apple slices with flour as I finished peeling them and while there was a little juice in the bottom of the pan, it was not off-putting. I used another reviewer's crust recipe (two cups flour, 2/3 cup shortening, 1 tsp. salt, six Tbs. ice water) and it was just a little skimpy for my deep dish pie plate, which made it difficult to make a pretty edge. The texture and taste was so good however, I'll try again and add a tiny bit more of everything to stretch it out. I used five large Granny Smith apples, which left a little tartness to the filling, which is how we prefer it. No more searching for the perfect apple pie recipe....found it. By the way, although the instructions called for peeled apples, did you notice that Chef John didn't peel his?

I tried it but I followed others advice to thicken the mixture by adding flour to the melted butter and the premixing  it  with the apple  and poured some over the latice openings. Also tried brushing the egg white  on the lattice. It turned out excellent .

But the apples were the key, I tried Honey Crisp and Golden Delicious, it turned too sweet for my taste.. I tried Fuji, I loved it, and next I  will try HoneCrisp and Fuji .

I've made it 3 times. Loved it with a few minor adjustments. I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup packed brown sugar (just a little less sugar)). I also added 1/8 tsp nutmeg..... When dissolved I reserved 2 tbsps of the syrup. Then I mixed into the syrup 2 tbsps instant tapioca waited 15 min and then added the apples. Mixed it all together well  and poured it into the crust. After applying the lattice top crust I brushed the crust with the reserved syrup.  I sprinkled the top with a tsp of white sugar and convection baked it at 325 for an hour. WOW! Thank you Chef John for such a simple yet great tasting apple pie.

I made this and served it at a get together and everyone loved the fact that it wasn't too sweet like some Carmel pies can be you could actually taste the apples!  I did peel the apples and used 6 as I like move apples than crust.

This was super good! It was defiantly very runny but after adding a few tbsp of flour it was perfect. Added some other spices too; nutmeg etc and it turned out great.

I made this for 4th of July last year.  It was my first attempt at an apple pie and it turned out perfectly!  I followed one of the other reviewer's suggestions and lightly floured the apples so it wouldn't be watery.  My family loved it! There were no leftovers to take home.

I followed the recipe to a "T" but unfortunately after baking for an hour, the crust was done but there was soup on the bottom of the pie which I pored out and continued cooking until most of it was boiled off. The problem I think is that the caramel mixture is missing a key ingredient : three tablespoons of flour which will thicken the apple fruit mixture  I tried making this again using a similar recipe on this site and it came out perfect.

I made this using Chef John's crust recipe.  The pie turned out absolutely beautiful and the crust was phenomenal.  The problem was that the filling was way too soupy.  And I felt like the amount of juice muted the flavor quite a bit.  If I hadn't used such a great crust recipe, it would probably have been a total disaster.  I wonder if there are some kinds of apples that shouldn't be used for this recipe.  I will try it again with different apples (I used organic Granny Smith and Gala) and maybe some flour or starch.  BTW this was the first pie I ever made and I baked it in a toaster oven.  So I was pleased it turned out as good as it did. :)

I went right by the directions and it turned out with a soggy crust. It boiled over and the sauce did not carmalize at all. I think the sauce should have been boiled more but it did not say for how long to boil. I will not make this again.

This was very easy to make.  And I would recommend the recipe, though I prefer a more pure apple flavor.  The caramel  sauce was thick and sweet and I did add 3 Tbsp. of corn starch.  Outstanding flavor with the Pink Lady's I used.  Serving it for Thanksgiving dessert tonight.  I am counting on rave reviews.

This pie is the best pie ever !!!! easy and fast to make. The only thing I changed was that I added two tablespoons of flour to make the pie filling thicker.

Take the guess work out of perfect pie! The juicy nature of this pie screams home made and just goes really well with vanilla ice cream.

I make this pie now and let it cool off 25 min before cutting and it's like a soup! Very watery, we ate by spoon. Also too much sugar.
I read rewie before to make this pie and tried to follow, next time I put only  half of sugar and half of water

I wish I would have read reviews before making this. I followed all the instructions on the recipe, but the sauce turned out runny and ruined the bottom crust.

I followed tips from other readers, such as let sauce cool, and mine still came out too runny.  I'll add 2 TBSP flour to sauce next time and not pour it all over apples.  Taste was very good.

Made as is. Delicious!  Make sure you lattice crust leaves about 50% of the surface open and make sure your caramel sauce is completely thickened and cool when you pour it on... I love the crunchy parts of the crust.  Between the 3 of us, it was gone in 2 days.

This was a very good apple pie but I just didn't get the caramel taste that I was hoping for.  I too had the excess liquid problem so I tipped the pie and let the juices run out into a saucepan where I boiled them down to a thicker consistency.  I spooned it back into the pie through the spaces in the lattice and that did solve the too wet pie problem but still didn't give me caramel.  I did change something based on another reviewer's advice and tossed the apple slices with the sugar mixture instead of pouring it over the top of the lattice, so I wonder if that could be the problem.

I followed the recipe exactly, I used 3 Granny Smiths and 2 Galas, it was a runny mess, it was so soupy that the bottom layer of crust was obliterated. The taste was really nice but the consistency and presentation is not what I expect from a pie. I may try it again but will definitely add a lot of flour to the apples next time.

Only giving 4 stars due to the fact that I made this twice, first time it was perfect, second which was of COURSE for company, it ended up super watery :( Im not sure exactly why, had i made it only the one time I would have given 5 stars.  Im just gonna look up some tips to avoid that watery finished product but I will try to make again.

Fantastic apple pie! Be careful to pour the glaze slowly so that it doesn't spill over the sides of the pan.  Also, be sure to cover all of the lattice crust with glaze.  Thanks Chef John!

This is the first pie I have ever made and it turned out really well! Even the little boy who announced that he "did NOT like pies" said "but I LIKE this pie". And I enjoyed the experience so much that I am trying more pies. Thank you to chef John for making my first experience with pies a good one!

This was such a hit…it disappeared quicker than the pumpkin pies I made :)  Very easy, I followed the directions as written only adding a few extra spices and some vanilla to the caramel sauce.  I chose granny smiths because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  We loved this pie and I will be using it from now on!  Thank you for another great recipe, Chef John!

This apple pie is great! I added 3 TBS of minute tapioca to help with the runniness some people warned about. 450 made my crust a little over done so next time I will probably just bake it at 350 for an hour. Great taste, it was a hit at Thanksgiving!

I made the pie exactly-ish as written.  Yes, when I served it 2 hours after taking it out of the oven, the filling was very watery.  But by the next day, the extra moisture had reabsorbed.  It was very delicious.  Changes for next time: might substitute one part Crisco for a stick of butter.  Will definitely let it rest longer before serving.  A+

Tip: I used a silicone covered rolling pin and mat and had no problems rolling out the dough.

After reading all the reviews, I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 3 T cornstarch to the apples to try to prevent it from being too watery.  The pie was totally cool before I cut it, but it was filled with water anyways.  After draining off the liquid, the pie cut very nicely and presented beautifully.  I think perhaps I used the wrong variety of apple (MacIntosh)and will try the recipe again with Gala or Granny Smith.  It was VERY tasty.

Thanks Chef John, best apple pie I've EVER made, and I've made quite a few.  Only thing I changed was to toss apples with 3Tbls. flour before putting into crust; makes a thick, bubbly delicious filling, and added 1tsp. cinnamon to sauce, simply because I love cinnamon, plus a few grates of fresh nutmeg. Used my own crust recipe.  This is the BOMB! Granny

This pie is perfect. Don't change anything. I made a pie for 3 people... There was nothing left five minutes later. Simple and delicious. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

This was amazing!!!!!  I took the suggestion from others and added 3 tablespoons of flour to the butter before adding sugar.  Mine was not runny at all.  I will for sure make this again!

Enjoyed it. It was not too sweet; just a good balance. It seems like when you let it sit overnight; it taste sweeter but still not super sweet.

This pie is easy to make and extremely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour to the butter and sugar mixture. As long as the pie is allowed to cool completely, it will not be watery when cut.

By far the best apple pie filling I've ever made! This is now my go to recipe. I have my own pie crust recipe and I like to add chopped pecans to this filling. It turns out great every time.

This was a great recipe.  Followed some of the suggestions and cut the apples in large chunks.  Also, I added Craisins, which added some tartness, and variety to the texture.

The pie is simple and tasty. You get a really crunchy, buttery crust that's delicious! I did follow reviewer's suggestion of adding 3 tbsp. of cornstarch to the apples and generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice. I used almost the whole lemon. I also used 2 galas and 2 Granny Smiths. Next time I will add cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the apples. 4 stars because it is really good but cornstarch does need to added or you'll have a runny pie. Recommend!!

This is incredibly yummy.  I only departed from the original recipe in sprinkling cinnamon sugar over the apples prior to adding the lattice, given that I was using some rather mealy-tasting mcintosh apples.  Turned out fantastic.  Thank you!

Best pie ever!!!  It was ridiculously good; everyone loved it.  It was beautiful to look at and tasted great.  Followed the recipe exact except I used less water in the caramel, floured the apples,  and put egg white on the crust so it would brown.  I used gala and pink lady's.  it was not watery, it was oozing caramel, which was awesome!!!

I used red delicious apples, margarine in place of butter (all I had), and made my own brown sugar with a mixture of 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 tablespoon molasses (I was out of brown sugar too!). I only had 4 apples, but it was enough, and I cut the apple slices on the thin side and simmered them in the caramel sauce on the stove for about 5 or 6 minutes, covered, before pouring them in the pie crust, to avoid them being under done. I also mixed 3 tablespoons flour in with the butter as another reviewer suggested to thicken the sauce some. I was a little nervous because this was my first apple pie, but it came out great. Even my picky husband who doesn't like apple pie at all really liked this. Thanks again, Chef John for another great recipe!

The first time I made this pie I used 4 granny smith apples and threw in some dried cranberries.  I loved it and the pie was not runny at all. My husband thought it was too tart. The second time I used 5 gala and it was much sweeter but also very juicy. Think I will go back to granny smith and add a bit more cinnamon sugar to the apples. I love the caramelized crust! Yum!

In the past, my go-to apple pie recipe was Grandma Oples.  I still love that recipe but we loved this recipe too because of the addition of the caramel flavor.  I used Trader Joe's pie crust (never bother making my own any more - TJ's are better by far and so convenient) and added cornstarch to the caramel like others suggested.  The pie was amazing and did not last long!

This was the second apple pie I have ever made in my life and it was probably the best tasting apple pie I have ever tasted too. This is High praise because I am not a baker nor a big dessert fan. Love the fact that I could watch a visual demo beforehand too. Everything this guy makes looks awesome. Hint: the kind of apple you choose can make a huge difference.

I made this last night and it turned out wonderful! This was my first pie,I was nervous after reading the reviews that this would turn out to be runny but it was perfect, I let it cool overnight which may have had something to do with it. I will for sure be making this again and again, thank you for sharing!!

my family loved this.  I agree with the others though that it was liquidy, even after flouring the apples, flouring the bottom of the crust and slighty lessoning both the butter and water and making larger apple slices... maybe i will try it again and completely omit the water.  The apples I used were 2 honeycrisp, 1 1/2 golden delicious and 2 gala.

It was my first apple pie and i wish i had time to read the comments before making it. It was watery. Amazingly delicious but presentation wise- not so good. I will definitely make it again, but this time with lattice top crust (dont forget to use yolk or milk, mine was a bit whitish) and will add flour to apples. Cinnamon can be added as well +1 tsp, gives a nice kick. I didnt have time to cool it down enough, so that could be another reason for sliding out of cake apples. Overal - for 1st timer i got great comments despite presentation and empty dish at the end of party! :)
