For me this was too sweet. The sweetness of the mango and the sweetness of the butternut needed some heat or some savoriness to offset it. I think the issue is the description on "one butternut squash" The butternut squash I had , after paring was close to 2 1/2 pounds of squash.. the description shows this to feed 2 people so I cannot imagine anyone being able to eat a pound and 1/4 of butternut. I didn't even put the full amount of squash in as it seemed like way too much for the amount of bacon.

So I will make this again, but adjust the squash amount or add more bacon or sausage and some heat

I ran out of frozen mango, but I had some roasted squash, bacon and kale in the fridge so thought I'd try that combo. It's delicious! I think the slight bite of the greens might balance the sweetness of the squash better, anyway -- it was plenty sweet for me without the fruit. I julienned the kale and added it along with some minced garlic after crisping the bacon (and draining all but 2 tbls. of the fat), then added the squash and a dash of white balsamic vinegar. Fantastic side or main dish!

This was delicious! I didn't have thyme or mango but bacon & squash is a great combo. I covered the pan and added a dash of water to help steam the squash during the first half of the cooking. Once it started to soften I took the lid off and let the water evaporate. Squash browned nicely. I paired it with the Simple Slow Roast Chicken recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-slow-roast-chicken/).

I'm always pressed for time, so I picked up some butternut squash that was already peeled and cubed. I used bacon and thyme, but I toasted pecans and added those, as well as some spinach instead of the mango because the squash is sweet enough. The pecans added crunch, and another layer of nutty flavor. I served this with a drizzle of good olive oil. Yum!

Peeling and cubing the squash was a pain, but the recipe was very good. I did add some chopped onions for additional flavor. Definitely will make it again!

Pretty good, Me being a bacon lover would do a couple more strips of bacon and maybe add some chopped onion as well, otherwise I'm sure I'll be doing this again.

Not sure how a family full of picky eaters would like this but all of them said they loved it!!  I loved how easy it was to make.  The only thing I did different was fill the bottom of the pan with bacon (six or seven slices).  Great addition to breakfast for dinner meals!

Very tasty. The cubed squash is not previously cooked. I did add about 1/2 cup water to the pan along with the squash and steamed for 5 min then uncovered to brown. It does cook quickly. I added 1 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper. I added 2 tbsp maple syrup insted of mangoes because of previous comments of the mango being too sweet. Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and wouldn't change a thing. I really didn't expect to like this, it just sounded unique so I tried it. I served it with pork chops and applesauce and the flavors blended beautifully I will make this again

The recipe needs seasoning help. Other reviewers talk about its sweetness, so I added onion, like others. It needed more. Depending on your taste and size of squash, it needs 1/3 cup of sautéed onion or more. I also added a salt-pepper-paprika mix instead of thyme, but it needed more. Curry powder was THE answer.  In the end, it’s just a bit too much squash taste. If I do this again, I would do 4 slices of bacon or some honey ham, ~1/2 cup of diced onion, and add 1/2 to 1 Tblsp of curry powder along with some salt.

This was delicious. Very unexpected, but good combination of flavors. I added water twice to steam the butternut squash as others suggested and also added 3 small pinches of cayenne pepper.  I cooked with 2 mangos and 6 pieces of bacon.  It was quite a satisfying scramble. Cheers!

Didn't have mango, so I used a fresh peach instead. Kept heat high for sweet potato chunks  to get a crunchy texture. I kept heat at "6" on my electric range. I used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of plain salt/pepper because I like the cayenne/paprika taste. This turned out fantastic, and I will make again.

The thyme didn't seem to fit well.  Next time I will try some other herbs.
I tried what other reviewers suggested and added some water to soften the squash.  It ended up getting mushy, and never crisped up.  Maybe giving it a quick zap in the microwave instead would help?
This isn't a good meal for making leftovers.

I used an apple instead of mango, because that's what I had.  I also toasted some walnuts and put that in with the apple.  Very good.

As I am one of those people who hardly ever follows a recipe, and sees them as a place to start, this recipe was a great place to start. I added onion, substituted apple for the mango, red pepper flakes, parsley, and butter. I used the famous Benton's bacon from Tennessee, and that really kicked up the flavor.  I am thinking of blending up the leftovers and adding either half and half or coconut milk in my Vitamix to make a creamy butternut squash soup. It's a great recipe!

This is very good!  Mods:  4 slices of bacon (vs. 3).  4 cups of chopped butternut squash (vs. using the whole squash, which produced 12 cups!).  I also used 1 TBL fresh Thyme.  I forgot the salt & pepper so next time this dish will be even more delicious.  The single mango produced about a 1.5 cups.   Time saving hints: cut the bacon with sharp scissors vs. trying to chop with a knife, and peel and chop the squash before hand.  Any squash not used in the recipe can be seal-a-mealed and frozen.  We ate this as our main (and only) dish, but it would also be a fantastic side at your Thanksgiving meal.   Highly recommend!

Actually made this twice, since the entire squash was too much for a family of three adults.  I also doubled the bacon and cut back on the thyme, but eveyone loved it.  Will definitely do again.  The mango was good, but I will also try with pineapple.

Made per recipe as we do everytime we try on Allrecipes.com recipe. Gotta tell you, this recipe sounded real tasty. However, the flavor was really lacking when we ate it. The mango didn't really add anything to the dish. The  butternut squash was yummy. But this dish needs a lot more to create a lasting flavor. Might make it again, but add onion, garlic and omit the mango. Perhaps serve over rice or noodles to give the dish more body.

Delicious recipe and perfect for fall. I didn’t have fresh thyme and ended up using 2 cloves of minced garlic instead. I also used more bacon to balance out the proportions of the butternut squash.

I added  1/2 an onion, garlic , still blan.
I’m going to try it again adding some acid to try and bring out some flavor, lemon or apple cider vinegar.
I hope it gets better I have a lot of squash ??

I made it exactly as written and served it on the side with some baked chicken.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes.  I think this dish would make more sense as a breakfast side dish served with eggs.

I was disappointed with this. I love bacon, I love mangoes, and I love butternut squash, but together they just aren't impressive, sadly.

I thought this was too sweet with eggs, but a perfect replacement for the dried fruit stuffing I normally pair my goose with at Christmas. I also added a bit of onion as suggested by a few others.

I pureed 1.5 c squash with half a bag of bacon bits and a small mango.  It was okay, but a little bland.

Made this tonight for dinner but put it in a whole wheat tortilla to make burritos... used thick cut bacon and added an extra slice (It still could use more). It is really good! I think like one other person said, it is sweet and could never imagine eating it by itself but it is good as a burrito and the savory bacon helps offset it.
