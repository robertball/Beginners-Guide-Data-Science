I only had boneless chicken thighs so the chicken wasn't as tender. I used Better Than Bouillon instead of chicken broth.I didn't have the Parmesan rice so I used jasmine rice and added parmesan. Perhaps this was the reason I wasn't crazy about the recipe. The rice was quite gummy but it may have been my substitution. The recipe just seemed to need something more.

The first reviewer changed the type of chicken, changed the type of rice, which was very specific, and then rated it low. Absurd review.

I followed the recipe to the word except I didn’t have infused rice so used jasmine and added in Parmesan and extra butter. Everything was great until the final steam step to cook the broccoli, I got the burn message and rice burnt to the bottom. I’d make again but steam the broccoli separately while the chicken/rice are cooking.
