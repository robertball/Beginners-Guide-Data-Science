That's so funny that you call it this, because my family has this same recipe which we call "Chicken with slop on top".  We usually serve it on rice and season with New Orleans Creole Seasoning by Tony Chachere.  I'd give it five stars because it reminds me of childhood and is a comfort food, but my boyfriend thinks the results are aesthetically unappealing and doesn't like the dish as much.

My very picky 7 year old absolutely loved this!  It was great over mashed potatoes.  He's already bugging me to make it again!

This was a great, quick recipe! My husband had seconds!  I changed a few things....1 can of cream chix and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of mixed veggies, a little garlic powder, crumbled a few butter crackers on top, and 1/2 the salt!  It was great with the added goodies! I served it over rice.  Very yummy!!!

This is the definition of comfort food. I used 2 cans of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cheddar cheese. I also added an onion, a can of black beans, and frozen corn. Very good, will definitely make this again.

REALLY liked this recipe!!  I served it over rice and it was wonderful!  The only thing is that next time I will NOT add the salt.  It was too much for my taste.  I'll probably add extra black pepper.  And I also put crushed butter crackers on top.  YUM!

My husband LOVES this over biscuits!  I've tried it over mashed potatoes and rice, both of which are great.  After reading other reviews, I look forward to trying it over pasta.

Was a little too salty. Wish I would have read the reviews before cooking.  Will make again but I will cut down the salt.

This was a great 'wipe out the pantry' recipe (I found it by looking up ingredients I had on hand!) We added some tortilla chips to the top, served it with egg noodles and added in some parsley as well. Loved it!

This was ok. I think it would have been better with sour cream instead of milk.

This recipe was perfect for my boyfriend, whose food preferences are strictly no frills, all American. I half the recipe for just the two of us. The chicken turns out juicy and flavorful and the extra sauce mixes well with plain white rice or angel hair pasta. The recipe couldn't be more simple, or more tasty!

This was a pretty bad combination of ingredients that I usually like.  No real way to fix it other than to not cook it again.

Made this a couple of nights ago and my husband and son loved it. I did too. I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom.  Added a can of HOT Ro-tel for flavor and served over rice.  Sooooo good and sooooo easy!!!!!!

I served this over rice, and it is soooo good.  I used reduced fat cream of chicken, and it didn't seem to matter.  Some things I would change for next time: OMIT butter and salt...the recipe can stand on its own without these.  The cheese and soup have enough salt already.  Also, it could use some veggies like peas and carrots.

This is a good comfort food and easy to out together. Still would not give it 5 stars. Have had better meals, but of course with more work. This is good .
