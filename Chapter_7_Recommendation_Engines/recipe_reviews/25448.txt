Three stars as written. I'm lucky enough to enjoy real Memphis rub (in Memphis!) about 3-4 times a year and, looking over the ingredients, I knew instantly this needed some tweaking. It just didn't seem to have the zest or the complexity of Memphis rubs I've become familiar with and love. First, if you've got a good blend of spices to begin with, the MSG isn't necessary - so I left it out. I also reduced the cayenne by half and used a sweet paprika. The ingredients listed were fine, it's just that it was clear there were also some seasonings glaringly missing.  I don't profess to be a Memphis rub expert, but after I added (for a half recipe) 1-1/2 T. of chili powder, 1 tsp, cumin, and 1 tsp. each of dried oregano and thyme, this rub came alive. Hubby grilled our ribs with it, low and slow, then served them with BBQ sauce on the side. Delicious.  Wish I would have made the full recipe!

WOW!  I am so glad I tried this recipe.  Typically when BBQing, I use a sauce but find that the sauce burns easily.  I saw a program on Food Network that talked about using rubs on meat when BBQing...so I decided to try one.  I had all the ingredients needed for this recipe along with a nice slab of pork ribs.

I mariniated the ribs for about 3 hours before grilling.  I grilled the ribs approximately 1 1/2 hours.  They were perfect.  The meat fell off the bone and my family pratically licked the platter clean.  The only change I made to the recipe is to NOT use MSG.

I am from Memphis and I see many recipes claiming to be a "Memphis Rub".  This is the real deal.  Perfection!

I guess since I just made my second batch yesterday it's time for a review! This rub is fantastic. So far I've used it on grilled chicken breast, beef tenderloin, hamburgers, pork tenderloin, and salmon. I don't doubt that it's fabulous on ribs too. Like others, I omitted the MSG and used meat tenderizer instead. And you can always make it a bit peppier by increasing the cayenne and/or dry mustard. However, I have to disagree with one reviewer who said it was like the rub used by the Rendezvous restaurant in Memphis. If you like Rendezvous ribs then add a bunch of cumin and it'll be close. Thanks for a great recipe that also saves me a ton of money!

What a awesome rub! You're right it's great on a roasting chicken. I rub it on in the AM and cook it for dinner. The flavors sink into the meat and it always comes out juicy :o)

Excellente!  If you live in a town where specialty rubs are not plentiful, try this...even if you do have rub availability.  I rubbed my pork and wrapped it in wax paper, ziplocked it and kept it in the frig overnite then smoked it the next day.  Perfect!

I was just going to search for "rib rub" or similar, until my husband mentioned the best ribs he ever had were in Memphis, so I searched for "Memphis Rub" instead. I'm so glad only one recipe came up since I didn't have time to check out a bunch, read reviews, etc. This rub was fantastic! I didn't have the MSG & I'm not sure what it could have added to the flavor. I can't wait to try it on other meats! So all I can say is, "Thank you, thank you very much!" for a little taste of Memphis.

Being a Memphis girl- I have to say this is almost as good as my Dad's secret rub! Or Charlie Vergo's Rendezvous' seasoning (http://www.hogsfly.com/) for that matter!! Love this as it reminds me of home from 2000 miles away... :o)I just wish I could give this more than 5 stars. Thanks from Southern california Chef C. Beard for taking me back to my roots

Fantastic.  I use this as the dry rub for my slow cooker pulled pork sandwiches recipe.  Just rub it on the pork, wrap in plastic wrap and chill until the next day.  Comes out perfect everytime.

This is one great rub.  Delicous and flavorful on baby back ribs.  I used smoked paprika, but other than that followed to a "T", minus the MSG.  Thanks for sharing this with us, will use many times.

INCREDIBLE, but I made a few changes.  I cut the paprika drastically and replaced the msg with tenderizer and omitted a lot of the salt.  I also omitted the onion powder and garlic powder for fresh onion and garlic.  I minced the garlic and onion and smeared it on our racks of a ribs and let it sit all day in the fridge.  About 30 minutes before cooking i smeared on our rub and then they were slow cooked on the grill.  We were very impressed by the uniqueness of it.  We had never tasted anything like it.  It was sweet, but not overpoweringly,  and it carmalized nicely with the fresh onion.  I was a little heavy handed with the rub, so i'll cut back on that in the future ,but i'm definatly saving this one for future use.Thank you ALIKAT695

Recently used a version of this for a professional competition and won.  Have made a few tweaks, but this is a competition quality formula.

Used no msg, and used sea salt. Very good on BLSL chicken breasts. Quite flavorful. Little overwhelming with all the paprika. Next time, I might cut it back a bit.

I've been using this recipe for 3 years now, and it's the one everybody wants me to do for any holiday or get together. I omit the MSG, salt and cayenne pepper. I use 1 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp of onion salt instead of the salt and use 1 tsp of chili powder instead of cayenne pepper. Everything else remains the same. I do this recipe for beer can chickens on the grill at 300 degrees, and they come out so juicy everytime. Great recipe for burgers and pork too... Thank you Memphis for such a wonderful dry rub.

I used the rub today, seeing that it is winter here in Michigan right now I put them in the oven instead of grilling them. I put the rub on the day before and when I was ready to cook them I cut my slab of ribs in three sections and made a aluminal foil packet with each of them, I added some liquid smoke to each of them and wrapped tightley. I put them on a sheet pan and baked them slowley for a couple hours then after they were done I took out packages and basted them with some Rays bbq sauce( didn't feel like making my own) and baked them for 10 more minutes. These ribs fell off the bones the rub is wonderful and being from Michigan we don't get this taste this way and I love it! I will aways use this. I did omit the MSG I can't have that in my diet next time I will add some ginger just because I love the taste. Thank you for the recipe.

I have NEVER liked ribs ..... until this recipe. shockingly, I can almost eat as much of these as my rib-loving husband! I used Adolph's meat tenderizer instead of the MSG (it was what I could get) and let them marinate 24hrs in the fridge. Then covered about and hour and a half in a moderate oven. Heaven! Everybody I serve these to ask for the recipe, and nobody walks away unhappy. Thank you for changing my life-long opinion on pork ribs!

I have mixed rubs for years and this is a good, not great, rub. I think the mix has too much paprika and would recommend that one add more brown sugar to the mix.

I'm from Memphis born and raised didn't move away until I was 25. Some people prefer to sprinkle it on and others like to rub it in. Be careful because the sugar does burn fast. I'd recommend wrapping ribs and such in foil to keep the moist and the sugar from burning.
Of course some hickory chips and a grill will complete the real deal :)

I used this rub on a Pork Blade roast. It was very good. I used smoked paprika because that is what I had on hand. I left out the msg but did add 2 tsp of cumin. Thanks for the recipe

I reduced the paprika to 1 TBsp. and added 1 tsp. each of ground orange peel, ground lemon peel (a review mentioned it may need something citrus-y so I went for it), instant espresso & unsweetened cocoa powder (inspirations from other rubs- seemed liked they would do well in this). I omitted the MSG, replacing it with some sea salt. We haven't tasted it yet, but it's been rubbed on "Drunk Chicken" from AR and is in the oven. Will update once we try it! EDIT: Taste is amazing! Will definitely keep this recipe on file for BBQ season.

Excellent rub!  One star off due to the MSG.  Not really necessary.  I've done a couple pork shoulders with this rub and they've been great.

I bought some ribs and was looking for a rub that I could use that accompanies my BBQ sauce. This rub holds its own solo and my boyfriend loved it!

I wasn't crazy over this spice rub. It did not have enough flavor for me. Also, make sure you use very high quality spices (especially the paprika) or the dish will taste cheap. And I skipped the MSG.

I love this rub! I didn't have celery salt, but I used a bit of Old Bay instead. I normally add red paper flakes to make it hotter, but the sugar balances it out nicely.  I have used this twice on chicken then baked it in the oven, my family loves it!

I love this rub on rotisserie chicken. Not spicy, just flavor-full!   Tonight we are doing it on ribs.  I just started making a double batch in a sealed container to keep on hand.

My husband grew up in Memphis and loves this recipe. We put it on chicken wings and then bake them in the oven for 30 min. at 500 degrees. We like this recipe so much that we have been eating it almost once a week ever since we found this recipe a year ago!

Excellent. This is the rub I use the most. No MSG for me, so I added an extra tsp of salt instead.  Does anyone actually still use MSG?  Sprinkle on your ribs, don't be stingy, wrap em up and refrigerate overnight.  You won't be sorry.

This is very good. I am a big "BBQ" guy. When people want good Q they come ask me for some :) (Well it is the truth). I think this will compliment well one of my basting sauces and will be fantastic on it's own. Thanks.

Tried the rub yesterday on some beef steaks. I did add cumin, oregano, thyme and chili powder like suggested in another review. I didn't have onion powder so I used 3 teaspoons of onion salt and omitted the salt. I also used a spicy paprika and omitted the cayenne pepper and I omitted the MSG. I will definitely use this rub more often!

Really liked this rub. It is SPICEY! left out the MSG. I used it on a pork tenerloin for Christmas.  I cut the pork loin lengthwise in a coil, rolled out the pork and put the rub inside and out then rolled up the tenerlong and cooked it in the oven.  I really liked it.

i was expecting a better flavor than I got using this rub. The flavor added by the celery salt was probually the problem. I tried it on chicken and would not recommend it.

Really great rub! I used this on a whole chicken then cooked it on the grill beer can style (with chicken broth and whatever rub was left) in the can. I was hoping for a Popeye's chicken spicy flavor, and this was good, but the next time I will inject it beneath the skin as the majority of the flavor stayed on the skin and really didn't penetrate the meat much. We all liked this and definitely I will use this recipe again.

Used this on a 12# brined, smoke cooked turkey and made a baste of butter and more rub. We all liked the flavor, but I may try a different rub next time and use the rest of this one on pork or cut up chicken.

I visited Memphis for the first time this summer and had ribs at the same restaurant three nights in a row, they were so good.  Since the trip I've tried a few times to replicate them, but have been unsuccessful until this recipe.  It's perfect!  I followed it exactly and my husband (who missed out on the Memphis trip) cannot stop talking about them.  Very authentic.  Thanks!

Just tried it with FriedChicken! It's delicious! I let it marinate 2 1/2 hours on three BLSL chicken breasts. Then I added some of the rub to the flour before coating the chicken in it. Lastly I fried the breast and they look great and taste even better. I will say it's a bit sweeter I when fried to me. When I used it for baked ribs, I tasted the spices more. Now that it's been fried, I taste sweetness with a hint of spice. Still a great balance between the two.

I gave this only a 4 star because I made adjustments to it for our taste.  I didn't use any white sugar, no msg, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. cayene pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, 2 tsp. garlic powder and 2 tsp. onion powder.  I make a big batch and store it.  To marinade I add a little olive oil to make it stick.  Everyone in my family loves this rub.  Will use for many years.

A good starter rub. The 2nd time I used it I added more cumin, chili pepper, a little basil and oregano. A little extra dry mustard also helps to spice things up.
My go to for quick rub.

This rub had a sweet/spicy taste, but the paprika really overwhelmed the other spices. In the future, I'd use less paprika and maybe a smoky variety. It was missing something... maybe something citrus-y. I think with a little tweaking for personal tastes, this could be just what I need for my beer can chicken. Thanks!

I used this as a thick rub all over a whole fryer chicken and roasted it in the oven for 45 minutes. It was tender and the rub added just the right amount of spice. Certainly is a keeper.

I am from Memphis. This was nice to find. Living up north they don't have many good BBQ places to eat. So, I have to do it myself.

This was awesome on the ribs I made this weekend.  I made only a small change.  I left out the MSG and I added a teaspon of chipotle pepper to give it some extra kick since we love spicy in my house.  Family loved it! We usually have left overs but with this rub none were left.  I will definitely use this again.

We omitted the MSG, cut the salt to 1tsp. & increased the garlic & onion powder (each by 1tsp.)  We used the rub on ribs but will try it on chicken & fish, as well. Overall, a very good mix of spices.

10.1.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25448/memphis-rub/ ...  Clearly I am at a disadvantage never having had Memphis dry rub before.   I exactly halved this recipe & it was the perfect amount for two pounds of boneless chicken.  While not sweet, I think less sugar would improve things.  It isn't spicy or barbecue-y to me.  'Needs some attention.

I followed this exactly except I left out the MSG.  It was really good and was awesome on chicken.  My kids raved about it.  My wife said it was a keeper.  I will say that it isn't sweet enough for pork and from my experience a true Memphis rub uses chili powder and cumin.

Made up two batches so far. The fans loved it at Mothers Day and Cub Scout Cross Over Dinner.
I made ribs the 3,2,1 method. 3 hours in a Bradley Smoker at 225 degrees, in oven with some home made Apple Ginger BbQ covered at 300 degree's, uncover and jam them back in one more hour at most for the last bit of caramelizing at the end. Remember, soak your ribs in cider overnight first.  Then a couple hours of rub, but dont go overboard with the rub. Thats why they call it rub! Just rub it into the meat until well colored and walk away. Awesome!

This is a super rub for smoked chicken. The recipe amount is enough to rub 4 chickens. I smoke my rubbed chicken over hickory or apple wood at 275 degrees for three to four hours depending on size of the chicken. Never fails

I used this rub as written; I smoked my ribs for six hours at 275ish. I believe the sugars made them too dark. BUT here is the rub. I was told it was my best rib ever (and I am good) so I will repeat this rub and likely cook at a lower temp to prevent premature carmealization  (sic) I may cut the cayenne a bit as I do not like heat obstructing the experience of slow smoked ribs, at the same time I cook so I can hear others tell me how great it is! :)

I didn't have any celery salt so I skipped it and I didn't have MSG so I subbed in salt(next I'll use only 1tsp of salt). I also added 1Tbsp Oregano to get it closer to a Rendezvous rub. It was good and I'll use again. I will buy the missing ingredients for next time.

I used slightly less cayenne pepper due to personal taste and did not use MSG. This rub is FANTASTIC on chicken and I'm sure it will be great on other meats as well. Will use many times in the future. I'm thinking of packaging some up to give as small gifts. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! Made it for two cups, tastes great, had extra ribs and meats. Microwaved, still has the taste and flavor.

This is one of the best rubs I've made.  I've made it 2x now.  The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly ... it was very tasty, but a bit too spicy for my husband.  The 2nd time, I cut the amount of cayenne in half (1/2 tsp), and added 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and increased the brown sugar to 1 1/2 Tbsp.  It was exactly what we were looking for.

i use this on just about anything--pork, chicken, beef.  i made chili last night-- threw a few tablespoons of rub in a bowl with beef stew meat and let it sit overnight.  then i browned the meat and added the rest of the ingredients.  mmmmmm.

Fine mix of flavors. Not too spicy, but enough kick to liven up the taste buds.  I really like this one.

I am from MN, maybe that is my problem.  I thought it was okay.  I did leave out the MSG due to the bad rap it has.  I will try it one more time, maybe I did something wrong.

I thought this was rather bland, not zesty at all.  Maybe a good recipe to tweek more to our liking.  Thanks!

Okay, just figured out that I forgot to put in the Cayenne Pepper.  I will try this recipe again!
