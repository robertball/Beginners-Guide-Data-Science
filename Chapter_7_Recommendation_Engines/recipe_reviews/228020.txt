If you make these expecting the fudgey sweet decadence of traditional brownies, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a relatively palatable, somewhat healthy portable breakfast with a touch of sweetness, then you might enjoy these. I found some great ideas in the reviews but to be fair, wanted to rate the original recipe. I hate when folks change every ingredient then give a recipe 5 stars...you're rating your own recipe, or 1 star because it didn't turn out...not the recipe's fault when you change everything! SO I made 2 batches of these babies, 1 as written and 1 to play with. Either way, they were just ok. As written, we thought they were a little dry and the banana was not my favorite...might like pumpkin better? Not sure. For the other batch, I did as others suggested and added 1/2c cocoa powder. Also used 1/2c unsweetened applesauce instead of the banana, 1/2c nonfat buttermilk instead of the 1/4c rice milk, 2 eggs instead of 1, and 2 tablespoons of white sugar in addition to the brown. I baked both batches in 8x8 glass Pyrex dishes. The result was 2 pans of thick and chewy 'brownies'. The chocolate batch was less dry but still just ok. I probably won't make these again but they were fun to try.

My kids and I love these on busy mornings!  They get a quick, portable breakfast that is healthy. Even with chocolate chips and regular milk they beat a Pop-Tart. We like them so much that I just put all the dry ingredients into Mason jars and made them Christmas presents for the health conscience. Thank you for sharing!

Kids said they were too dry and refused to eat them; hubbie thought the oats were too "hard"!  He and I enjoyed the flavor; I did add the 1/2 cup cocoa for a chocolate touch.  Might try again, but will probably cook or soak oats to soften them and double egg & milk for a moister brownie, I hope!  If I do make them again, will report back.  ;)

I added the extra ingredients (1/2 c cocoa, 1/2 c chocolate chips and 1/4 c oil) and it came out great.  It's very hearty, moist and not overly sweet.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and regular milk.  As with regular brownies, it goes great with milk.

I really love this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but added chocolate chips and cooked it in an 8 x 8 pan since I didn't have an 8 x 10. Probably will cook it in a smaller pan all the time since it made the brownies thicker which was perfect. Was good for me and tasted good. My 20 month old liked it as well!

This is a solid recipe that can easily be altered to suit anyone's taste. I'll sub out the brown sugar next time, and my husband suggested adding strawberries to compliment the banana. My favorite thing about this recipe is that the result is very kid-friendly. A great and moderately healthy finger food!

Can something be called a brownie without chocolate or carob? I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened dark chocolate powder and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips. I used regular all-purpose flour and cow's milk. It was a very good snack and breakfast on-the-run. I may even try it without the chocolate next time. Thanks for the base recipe, Darien1!

Great result....I used soy milk and splenda brown sugar as well as regular flour. I did add 1/3 cup oil and they were moist and chewy. I also added 1/3 c cocoa and melted a few chocolate chips on top.

This recipe was a good start, but i made a number if changes. I didn't use any flax seed and added 1/2 cup cocoa powder and a handful of chocolate chips. I didn't adjust the liquid at all and it turned out great. I really enjoyed them and will make it again. My boyfriend hates them though. He said they were nothing like brownies.

I make these by swapping out the flour with chocolate protein powder, adding 1/4 cup cocoa powder (I use special dark), swapping out the banana with apple sauce and add about a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. I bake them in mini muffin tins and they make a great protein packed treat.

Iadd 1/2 cup unsweetened ocoa, left out the cinnamon, added a handful chocolate chips, and added 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Cooked in a 9x9 pan for 20 minutes. Came out amazingly moist! I am in love with these!!

I didn't have any flax so I added 1/2 cup wheat bran and 1/4 cup fresh coconut; and took other reader's advise and added the 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.  The addition of the ingredients made the mixture too dry so I added more milk (I used almond milk) by 3 tbsps.  It all worked :)

Not bad.  I used skim milk and regular flour and it worked fine.  This does taste "healthy" with a nutty, somewhat grainy and bran sort of feel, so if you've got people used to white bread and sweets, not sure it will pass, but most of my coworkers liked this.  A few loved it and ate several pieces.  It's pretty hearty and tastes a little nutty--probably due to the flax seeds--even without any nuts.  This is a really quick thing to bake up.  Good thing, since I decided at the last minute to make this for work.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe, but made several changes to get my desired result of a chocolatey brownie fairly healthy for you! I blended the oats for a smoother consistency. Subbed the Flour for chocolate protein powder, and added 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, And 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also omitted the banana and added an extra egg. Instead of milk I added a 1/2 cup of hot coffee, and I added 1/4 cup of coconut oil. And last instead of brown sugar I used 1/2 cup maple syrup and 2 Tablespoons of sugar. Even though it's a lot of substitutions, the end result was fantastic!!! Beautiful protein packed brownies!

For gluten free, these are good.  I've made them a couple of times and changed it up according to what I have on hand.  Applesauce or berries instead of bananas - or both.  Also good with a few added chocolate chips and nuts.

Liked these pretty well. They turned out much more cake-like than brownie-like. After reading the reviews, I decided to add the 1/2 c cocoa powder for flavor. Many said it was dry or dried out quickly. So I also cut the flax meal (which is quite absorbent) to 1/2 c and added another egg and additional almond milk until the consistency was more batter-like. I am gluten-free so used a gluten-free flour. They came out quite moist and have stayed that way in an air-tight container for 3 days so far, though there's not much left. Will make again, but definitely still needs something. They are really good with almond butter spread on top. I may try adding it to the batter next time. Maybe another banana, maybe some chopped nuts, maybe coconut. Since it's for breakfast, and I'd like it to be relatively healthy, I don't want to go the chocolate chip route as others have.

I tried this recipe but did not have gluten free flour or flax seed mix so I used regular flour and Old Wessex Ltd all-natural 100% whole grain 5 grain cereal (it had flax in it and was the closest I could find). It turned out fine and am looking to take it with me this Sunday as a breakfast dish. However, I do have one dilemma: my grandmother is allergic to bananas. Has anyone found a substitution for bananas that I could use? I really like this recipe.

I have made this several times and sometimes used applesauce in place of banana 1/3 cup.  Also added at different times choc chips, nuts, raisins, and soy instead of rice milk.  I love them husband is just so so,  however he has them one a day at least.   Thanks

These were tasty but very dry. Next time I make them I will try doubling the banana and see if that helps. Other suggestions would be welcomed! Thanks!!

These have become a staple in my house.  I usually make 3 batches and personalize them for people.  I take out the oats and use crushed bran flakes for my youngest because she hates oats. Perfect for my oldest who's a T1D kid.

Changes: a handful of cocoa powder instead of flax seed meal, lactose-free 2% milk instead of rice milk, added a handful of peanut butter powder, and used another egg instead of the banana. 

With those changes, I like it! It's a bit spongy though so if I make it again, I think I'll try to make it a little more chewy.

It was very good but as with many recipes with flax it gets dry.
The flavor was very good but make sure to cover the pan with a towel as instructed to help keep the moisture in.

It's a good idea if you are tired of bran muffins. Not bad.

It turned out pretty good, I added cocoa powder, did not have any flax seed powder, so I did replace the amount with regular flour and added vanilla I also used two bananas. It turned out good, thank for the post.

I liked these. A quick breakfast for when you are running out the door. The only thing that was weird to me was that they call them brownies but there is no chocolate in them. You just can't do that, so I added coco powder and a hand full of dark chocolate chips. I would make it again.

These aren't exactly brownies - more like a homemade soft granola bar. I didn't have flax seed so just sub'd it with 1/2 cup cocoa powder. No rice milk on hand so I used flax milk (non-dairy). I also used regular old fashioned oats instead of the specifically 'instant' kind because I didn't have instant (probably a bad idea).  These aren't very sweet, and I think the cocoa helped make them a little more interesting. Rice milk is sweet, but I don't think it would have added enough sweetness to satisfy most peoples' palates which expect a sweeter kick.  The response I got from my boyfriend, who was excited about them, was 'dry' (maybe because the oats weren't instant and didn't so soak up the moisture well) and 'they need chocolate chunks'. The cocoa helped with the flavor, but I think also adding fruit to the batter would make these nice - fresh strawberries or dried cherries. Also, I need to find a way to get them to be not so dry. Add oil? Peanut butter? Will using instant oats fix the problem?  I'll experiment further.

These are delicious if you enjoy a healthier- oatier flavour. I taste the banana and really like the flavour. I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder for chocolatey taste. It was a tad dry in the mixture so I also added some yogurt to moisten it up (it was all i had!)

I didn't have rice milk so I used almond milk and it worked. Loved the moisture and taste.

These are easy to make. My 11 yr old daughter made them. We followed the recipe exactly, except used coconut palm sugar instead (1 for 1 substitute). I love them as is, however, I'm going to play around for variety and try some of the other suggestions like cocoa powder, more spices, shredded coconut or maybe chocolate chips. I used King Arthur gluten free all purpose flour for my gf flour. I think I'll try low fat soy or almond milk next time, they have fewer calories than the rice milk.

I tried adding the extra ingredients, the coco powder and chocolate chips and it didn't turn out well.  I found it to be very dry and it had too much chocolate.

Wanted something new for breakfast, was not disappointed with these. Also added a few dairy/nut/soy free mini chips, but they are pretty tasty even without the chocolates. Good stuff!

Coming back to update my original review....these are wonderful right after being baked but after a day or so they are very dry and not very good. I cut them into serving size pieces and froze some but they didn't fare any better when not warm and fresh.
