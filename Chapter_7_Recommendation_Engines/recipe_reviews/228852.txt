This recipe needs changes to come out good. The chicken was done before the potatoes. I had to set the chicken aside for 20 minutes while the veggies finished cooking. Also there was too much liquid. I loved the seasonings on the veggies but the chicken was plain. If I were to try again I might just cook the vegetable portion with less liquid and do chicken in a skillet with more seasoning.

We really enjoyed the mix of vegetables in this and the flavor was wonderful. Hubby went back for seconds on the vegetables which he rarely does. This smells so good cooking. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and next time I will season them with more than salt and pepper. I didn't even have a chance to take  a picture of this as it had our mouths watering. LOL!

We altered this recipe quite a bit, but were pleased with the results. We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, organic chicken broth instead of apple cider, no pumpkin pie spice, and a lot more seasoning on the chicken. The chicken cooked in about 55 minutes, without taking the time to try to brown the chicken (no skin). The veggies were delicious, though the potatoes were undercooked at 55 minutes when the chicken breasts were done. Everything else was tasty! Overall, a good recipe to get an idea--just run with it yourself, especially when seasoning the chicken.

This smelled amazing cooking but tasted very bland.  After reading other reviews I used less liquid and seasoned the chicken, but it just wasn't enough to fit our tastes.

Very disappointed. Even having read the comments and made adjustments it was rather tasteless and the sauce was runny.

This was ok. The only thing I changed was that I used sweet potatoes instead of carrots. I don't really like cooked carrots. The ligquid did not become syrupy like the description says and I had to turn on the broiler for an extra 10 minutes because the skin still was not brown after I cook it for 20 min without the foil. The flavor was ok. Could have been better.

It was a disaster. When I checked it at 45 minutes it was still raw. I ended up cooking it for about 2 hours so of course the veggies were overcooked. I was really disappointed because this would've been a healthy meal. Sorry.

This is a nice comfort food dish that's pretty easy to make.  Since previous reviews mentioned the veggies not cooking as fast as the chicken, I cut them into small pieces.  I don't use shallots as I am allergic, but substituted lots of extra garlic.  I also used boneless breasts instead of legs.  I would cut down on the apple cider - too much liquid.  I would also add spices like Jane's Crazy Salt, or a similar blend.  I had left overs which were better than the first serving.

Too Acidic with the vinegar.  I used breasts, not leg quarters.  The carrots were not cooked.  I will not make this again, not even with changes.

I'm only giving three stars as the recipe is written. I will try this recipe again however the biggest change for me was needing to roast the vegetables first and then adding the chicken on after. I will try to roast the vegetables for 20 minutes first and then adding the chicken and sticking to the recipe the rest of the way. I did also need to broil the dish once I took the foil off in order to get the chicken to brown.
