Tasty!  I used black beans,  white beans and kidney beans.   followed recipe otherwise.   I thought the dressing had too much vinegar so I offset that with more honey!   I also used more fajita mix and mixed the chili powder.  4 Stars!

I used two cloves fresh garlic instead of the powder and grilled the corn first to give it a nuttier flavor. The fresh lime juice and the cilantro give this salad an awesome southwest flavor. Perfect for a BBQ. It was delicious! I'll definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday, and it's even BETTER today. The only thing I did differently was use taco seasoning instead of fajita seasoning. And I used a huge bunch of cilantro. Turned out great!

I made it for a church picnic and it was very well received.  I did add more fajita spice (I misread the recipe) so I left off some of the other spices.  But I think it is the honey that really made the difference.  
My one complaint is the nutritional information is based on dividing the recipe into 16 servings.  Really?  Please use something more standardized like a cup or half cup.  I have no idea what a 16th of the total is without dividing it into 16 equal parts.  Clearly that is not useful.

Big hit with my dad even though I didn't have any honey. Mom didn't like it but she's just picky lol. Other than that was surprisingly a good way to clear out those old cans in the back of the pantry that I've been wanting to give rid of :) 10/10 would make again

Very popular with very little left over.   This may have even motivated a couple of people to sign up to this site.

OMG, what a beautiful, nutritious and delicious salad this is.  Not only that, but, if you choose, you can add (or subtract) just about anything you'd like.  Cilantro is a particular love for me, but for those of you who don't care for it, substitute fresh parsley.  I have a similar recipe but this one is just as good (maybe better:)! Why haven't more of you folks tried it?  It lasts and when needing a little something, this is a great satisfier!!  Thanks for sharing!
