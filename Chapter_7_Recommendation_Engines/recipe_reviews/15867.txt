im only 13 and i could make this all by my self so it was really easy. i made some revisions to the recipe though such as, i changed the soup to creme of chicken and i also added another can of it to make 3. i also added a can of chicken broth instead of the 3 cups of water but then it was very chickeney so i added 1/2 a can of water. but for the briskets i added a lot more than lot called for and rolled them into balls before dropping them in. i dont know if you will like my changes but my parents said it was really good:)

-molly...if you like the revisions maybe you could add a review because i want to be a cook one day....thanks

GREAT basic recipe! I modified it a bit (like everyone else) as follows: Sauteed 1/8 c chopped onion and 1 lg. garlic clove (chopped) in 1 TBL butter before adding chicken.  I used chicken tenderloin and covered it with 2 cans chicken broth.  Did not drain any broth when chicken was done.  Added 1 c cream of chicken, 1 c cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/2 box frozen peas and carrots.  I used two cans of Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits and after sprinkling about 1 TBL of Wondra (very fine) flour on a paper plate, cut them into a tic-tac-toe pattern.  I dusted the dumplings with the flour on the plate and put 1/2 of them in the pot to cook (when it was boiling).  They took about 15 minutes.  After we had eaten all of the dumplings in the pot, I turned the heat back on, let it come to a boil again and cooked the remaining dumplings for the leftovers.  Without the dumplings crowding into each other, they plumped nicely, didn't stick together and there were plenty for the leftovers.

This is the first time that I have made chicken and dumplings because I never wanted to go to the trouble. This is a great recipe and the previous listed suggestions that I used were: using 1 cup of broth and 2 cups water to cover chicken, adding sliced carrots, chopped celery and onion, 2 smashed garlic cloves (which I later removed). I used Chardonnay wine (had some in the frig). I used one can of non-grand, non-flaky refrigerator biscuits - tearing off thumb sized pieces and flattening them slightly between my thumb and forefinger as I threw them into the pot.
My husband loved it and for me it was a one dish meal with compliments - and no left overs. Can't get better than that!

My husband asked me to make his favorite dish, chicken & dumplings...which in 17 years I had never made, I'm a yankee, and the whole idea of raw dough boiled in soup didn't appeal to me, but being a cool rainy day today, I decided to treat him...Thanks to this EXCELLENT recipe, I am now a total convert! :)
I read more than half the reviews, and made these changes, used one can cream of chicken soup and one of cream of celery, used 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts, used 5 cups of water with 5 cubes low-sodium chicken bouillion, added a teaspoon of tarragon and used the bisquick dumplings too...it was SO GOOD!!! My husband and 2 1/2 year old daughter both had 2 big bowls apiece!
Thank you Melissa for a great recipe!

Yum!  By the time I served this, the recipe listed here was a mere spec of what I ended up with, but it is a perfect foundation to do with whatever you want!  Here's what I did, some of it per other reviews, and some of it on my own.  I simmered the chicken in chicken broth mixed with water and chicken bullion cubes.  To the broth I added parsley, cracked peppercorn, minced onion, four or five bay leaves and a pinch of garlic powder.  I used a can of cream of celery soup and a can of cream of chicken soup.  I added diced canned potatoes, fresh carrots and celery, fresh minced garlic, frozen peas a little more onion and more pepper.  I made my own biscuits using biscuit mix and milk.  To the dough I added basil, parsley and a pinch of pepper.  IT WAS SO YUMMY that my 11-year old announced that she could eat it every day for the rest of her life!!!  Hubby and other daughter loved it too!  Definitely cook the biscuits longer...I cooked mine for 10 minutes with the lid and 10 minutes without the lid!  You can't screw this up!  Give it a try...I bet your gang will love it too!

I made this recipe for my daughter and she loved it so much that it has become a staple in her house.  She makes it at least once a week.

I use 4 to 6 very large chicken thighs (skinless & boneless, simmered them in 1 waxed carton of chicken broth.

I cut up carrots, celery & onion and a touch of garlic, then sprinked in pepper.  When the carrots were almost done I added a can of cream of celery and cream of chicken soup and stirred it well to blend.  

Then I added the refrigerator biscuits.  I tore them in half but my daughter simply put them on whole without tearing them into pieces.  Then I put a lid on it and simmered it for at least a half hour.

It was sooooooooooo good.  Simple & easy. A winning recipe, thank you for sharing.  We have this dish often because it's tasty and quick and easy.

Followed a lot of the suggested modifications and a few of my own. I'm sure it's good as the recipe is written, and definitely easy....but a few quick changes made it incredible to me! Instead of cooking the chicken in plain water, I added chicken broth, carrots, onions, celery, 2 cloves crushed garlic, and white wine. It smelled heavenly while it was cooking! I pulled out the crushed garlic, but used most of this cooking liquid, veggies and all--delicious!

A great recipe!! i've been trying to duplicate the chicken and dumplings that my mother used to make when i was little. i know this is not the recipe, but it's MUCH, MUCH easier than doing it all from scratch, and it's just as good!! i followed some of the reviews and cooked the chicken in chicken broth not water with onions and some garilc. i also didn't have cream of celery soup so i used cream of chicken and mushroom and made dumplings according to the Bisquick box beacuse i didn't have and biscuit dough...it all worked GREAT. my husband even had leftovers the same night i made this.

I made this and it came out great.  I DIDN'T change it one bit, because if I did I wouldn't be rating it, I'd be rating mine!  Pet peeve of this site is people rating a posted recipe then listing the changes they made to it...

Quick, easy and yummy.  It was also very simple.  I tweaked the recipe a little and added a couple dashes of minced onions and used 3 good-sized chicken breasts instead of the called for thighs.  Turned out great!  Good job Melissa.

I've tried this recipe at least three times.  I found the best result was when I used a plain canned biscuit (no layers, no buttery flavored ones, not the big ones either).  I actually found the very best result was a can of the smaller generic brand.  I cut them in half and added them to the 'broth'.  What also worked best was to leave all the chicken pieces out and bring the liquid to almost boiling and dropping the biscuit pieces in (one at a time).  Let the biscuits cook at a low rolling boil for your recommended 8 minutes then add the chicken back in and lower the heat for another 10 minutes.  That was how I got the biscuits to cook best.  Just make certain you use PLAIN biscuits.

My husband has been pleading with me to make chicken and dumplings for him. Since he and I are the only ones left to cook for, I felt it wasn't worth doing since there would be so much left over and probably not eaten after several days. This recipe was the one I've been looking for. It wasn't a lot of prep. work and it was enough for two meals for us. I did put in the carrots, celery, onion and 1 can each of cream of celery and cream of chicken soup. I made the dumplings from the Bisquick pkg directions, and they came out perfect. I also used the chicken broth as opposed to using plain water to cook everything in. My husband was very happy with the results, and so was I. Thanks so much for this recipe, it's perfect for smaller families with less time. As for the people who say this isn't "chicken and dumplings" you must have always had the "slippery dumplings" which I don't call dumplings, I call noodles. I'm used to these kind of dumplings and am vey happy to have found this recipe.

was hoping for a more from-scratch recipe. not a fan of the creaminess and dumplings tasted too chemically. for a more homemade version, use a roasted chicken ($4 at the local grocer), remove all meat and set aside. cover the carcas and skins with water and simmer an hour for good brother. remove bones and skin and add more water or brother, garlic, onion and desired spices and veggies. when the veggies become almost tender, drop in your dough (2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup shortening blended with pastry cutter, add 1/2 cup milk and bring together) by spoonfuls into gently boiling soup. cover and let cook 8-10 minutes. OH YUM and worth every minute extra!

Though I was skeptical that biscuit dough could possibly taste like anything other than mush in this recipe, a long-time desire to easily copycat my grandmother's fantastic chicken and dumplings forced me to try this....and it is fantastic! I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery, and cooked three boneless chicken breasts in half chicken broth and half water.  I also added 1/2 package frozen sweet peas, which really perked it up.  Thanks, Melissa...this is a new family favorite!

This was such an easy base recipe.  I did change it little.  I used both skinless boneless breasts and thighs plus I made the dumplings from Bisquik.  The whole family loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I used 1 can of chicken broth and 2 cups of water as well as some chopped carrots and celery and boiled it with the chicken.  I also used 1 can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken.  Grands biscuits worked great! Delicious for a cold, rainy day! Thanks! Ally

This recipe is WONDERFUL.  Easy and Good!  I have never attempted to make this dish before for fear it would be too dificult or it would flop.  This didn't it was very good - with NO leftovers!!  I used some other suggestions listed and used 1 can of broth and 1 can of water (to cover chicken) and added 1 sliced carrot, celery, and onion.  All chopped into very tiny pcs.  This gave it excellent color and flavor!  I Highly Recommend this recipe for something different that would look like you cooked all day!!

Delicious. The only change I made was to use 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken. I think the "make or break" part of this recipe is what kind of biscuit dough you use. I tried one of the canned varies the first time I made this, and it was not very tasty. The second time (and subsequent times) I used frozen Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits. I use six of them (because the dumplings are the best part, in my opinion) and let them get to room temerature. Then I use kitchen shears to cut them into bite size pieces. I cover the dish after adding the dough, which helps the biscuits cook faster. They cook through in about 10 minutes on medium low heat. YUM.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I was only cooking for two and wanted minimal leftovers so this is what I did.  Took three boneless skinless chicken breasts and boiled them in one can of chicken broth and water to cover for 15 minutes.  Took them out of the pot to cook and removed about 1/2c-3/4c of the liquid.  While it was cooling I added 1 more can of chicken broth, 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken, frozen peas, 4 carrots and a package of frozen egg noodles since I didn't have anything for dumplings.  I tore up the chicken after it cooled, added it to the pot and let it all simmer for about 5 minutes.  Some salt and pepper and I was in heaven!  Hope this modification helps some !  Thank you for this inspiring recipe!

This was even better than I had expected.  I used some of the other reviewers' suggestions.  I used 2½ cups of low sodium chicken broth, ½ cup of white wine, sliced carrots, garlic and onions.  Next time I might add sliced mushrooms and diced potatoes.  My family just loved this!  It was very filling, and I plan on making this on several cold, winter nights this year.  Wonderful recipe!

I don't even like chicken and dumplings, and this was fantastic.  I made it like this:  1 can veggie broth, 1 can of chicken broth w/ three chicken breasts (I don't like dark meat).  I used one can of cream of celery, and one of cream of chicken.  I also added about a cup of frozen peas and carrots.  I used JP's Big Daddy Biscuits recipe from this site for the dough and used about half of it (I made biscuits out of the other half).  I cooked it about 5 minutes longer than called for once the biscuits were in because I didn't feel they were cooked enough at 8 minutes.  A fabulous, quick and filling meal.  I brought it to my husband's work for him and a co-worker, and the co-worker said it was the best home-cooked meal he'd had in a long while.  *ear to ear grin*

This dish is AWESOME!!  Everyone in the house loved it, including my picky 3 year old.  Per advice of the reviews, I cooked the chicken in broth, then added about 1/2 cup of white wine.  I also added garlic, carrots, celery and a good sized onion.  I was very impressed by this, and can't wait to make it again. Thanks!

OH MY GOODNESS..... I JUST FINISHED TRYING THIS RECIPE, IT IS OFF THE SCALES,RATING CHARTS, CHAIN, WHATEVER.  THIS RECIPE DESERVES 7 STARS.  UMMMMMPH !!  I DID MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS AS SOME REVIEWERS ADVISED.  IT CAME OUT JUST PERFECT. (I MADE ENOUGH FOR 10 SERVINGS) I USED 2 BAY LEAF FOR SOME ADDED FLAVOR.  I USED 2 CANS OF CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP AND ONE CAN OF CREAM OF CELERY. I PUT IN A HALF POD OF CHOPPED CAYENNE PEPPER- TO GIVE IT A LITTLE KICK. INSTEAD OF PLAIN WATER TO BOIL THE CHICKEN IN I USED CHICKEN BROTH AND ADDED 2 CHICKEN BOULLION CUBES ALSO. IF THERE IS ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A GREAT CHICKEN AND DUMPLING RECIPE THIS IS THE ONE.

This was a great starter recipe.  I followed a lot of the suggestions from other posters.  I used two cans of chicken broth and one and a half cans of water for the base.  I added to that four cans of chicken meat, one carrot, two ribs of celery, an onion, and two cloves of garlic, all chopped.  I also put in 2 tsp of paprika, a handful of parsley, and two leeks.  I let it simmer for a bit and then added one each of cream of celery and cream of chicken. I brought that up to a boil and then added dumplings I made using the Bisquick recipe and to the dough I added 1 tsp each of dried parsley and basil.  When it was done, I removed the leeks.  This is definately going to be a staple in this house!

I was skeptical, but this was so easy and tasty!  I used a bay leaf while boiling the chicken and use Healthy Request soups (1 mushroom and 1 celery).  I also added a tablespoon of tarragon, and like others, didn't add salt but added baby carrots and chopped celery.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to bring the liquid to a boil and add dumplings before the chicken and let cook for 8 minutes.  Then I added the shredded chicken and let it simmer genlty for about  20 minutes.  The dumplings turned out great and my boyfriend ate 3 helpings!

WONDERFUL!  I have gone through several chicken and dumplings recipes in search of the best one and this is it!  I made the following changes: added 2 cans of chicken broth when boiling chicken, used 8 chicken thighs, and used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery.  My husband (whose favorite meal is chicken and dumplings) LOVED this.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!  I have been making it once a week since I found it 3 weeks ago and even my 3 year old daughter loves it!!!

This was pretty good & easy. I used 1 can cream of celery, 2 cans cream of chicken, a can of mixed vegies, chicken broth, basil, parsley, garlic powder & pepper. I also added parsley & basil to the dumplings (Bisquick). My only concern w/ this is the high sodium content. Next time I'm going to use low sodium soups. Thanks for sharing - this was perfect on a cold, rainy Nebraska night.

My first time..Yeahh!! 
This was very easy and tasty... Of course dumpling isn't dumpling unless you add carrots and peas.. I added those and sliced up a rotisserie chicken instead.. There was a comment to roll the dough which I did but I didn't like it because it takes the dough to long to cook... Great recipe

Wonderful but I made some changes.  I had leftovers from a store-bought roasted chicken so I cut that up for the chicken.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth, two cans of low fat Cream of Chicken soup and one can of low fat Cream of Celery soup.  I added a teaspoon of Herbs d' Provence to that.  Added the chicken, 1 medium onion and frozen peas & carrots.  I used a can of the large refrigerated biscuits and cut them into quarters.  Cooked all of this for around 8 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!!!  We loved it.

My family loved this, and it was super, super easy.  I served ours over rice cause I had leftover in the fridge.  I think this could be made in a huge batch then frozen, then you can use it for the dumplings, or over rice or noodles.  I also used 1 can celery and 1 can mushroom.

This was tasty. I completely changed the recipe to suit my tastes, but I'll tell you how I did it in case you're wondering. =) I sliced three medium sized boneless/skinless chicken breasts into about three pieces each and put them in a big pot with enough water to cover them about an inch. I threw in three chicken boullion cubes, two spoons of diced garlic, a few shakes of parsley, oregano, pepper, and garlic salt. I brought it to a boil and let it cook about 7 minutes. While it was cooking, I took premade dough (I think I used albertsons buttermilk brand) and cut each biscuit in half, and folded it over with dried parsley rolled into it. (I just used the flat end of the knife to press some parsley in and folded them over.) Then I took the chicken out and let it cool, added the two celery soup to the water mix (I didn't drain any at all) and used a whisk to break it up, keeping it on medium heat: just almost boiling / near boiling. After cutting up all the chicken into bite sized pieces, I put it back in, let it boil for a min or two to finish cooking the chicken (pieces were almost done, just a bit of pink left) and then added the biscuits, tearing them in half as I went. I let it cook, stirring it now and again, for about ten minutes maybe, while I did clean up. ... The boys had never had chicken and dumplings before, and they LOVED this. I think it had good flavor and was very easy / low cost, since I'll use the chicken for another meal too. Thank you so much for sharing!

I give this recipe 5 stars for not only how it tastes, but for how easy it is to make.  I did add some frozen peas when I added the soup.  I also used others' suggestions and used chicken broth for the poaching liquid.  I used the new Pillsbury Perfect Portions buttermilk biscuits (total of six biscuits for this recipe).  Great stick-to-your-ribs comfort food!!

This was great.  Simple, Quick, and tastes excellent.  I have a small family so there was leftovers, but everything will be eaten.  I used 3 frozen chicken breasts (frozen from the bag) cubed into 1" squares and boiled them in chicken broth with some carrots, celery, and potaotes.  I used cream of celery, mushroom, and chicken for my sauce and bisquick for the dumplings.  Throw in some bacon and everyone will be going back for seconds.   Thanks Melissa  ;)

I really enjoyed this... reminded me of the dumplings I beg my grandmother for. I also used chicken broth instead of water and used a can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of celery.  I used crescent dough instead of biscuit dough- that worked better for me.

I was shocked at how good this recipe was!  It took no time at all to make and I took the advice of another review and served it over mashed potatoes.  Last night was cold and rainy and this warm meal was just perfect!  I did use one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom (both low fat/low sodium) -- I don't like celery and I used some chicken broth to cook the chicken.  It was fantastic!!  My boyfrined said its a new favorite, I will make it again!

This is a great base recipe. The recipe seemed like it would turn out fairly bland, so I changed it a little bit. When I boiled the chicken, I added a few peppercorns, a smashed garlic clove, and one boullon cube. I cooked an onion, celery, and carrots in a little bit of oil before I added the soup to the skillet. I would really recommend rolling out the biscuits and cutting them into smaller pieces before adding them to the skillet because they puff up quite a bit.

Delicious and easy.  I made the following changes after reading other reviews - added 2 stalks chopped celery and 2 chopped carrots with the chicken, used 3 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water and left it all in the pot after the chicken was cooked, only used 1 can of soup. Also, I made real dumplings from scratch while the chicken was cooking to avoid all the additives in canned biscuit dough and plus it's so easy - (mix 2 cups flour, 3 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt. Cut in 4 Tbsp shortening, and add 3/4 cup milk, mix with fork. Add additional 1/4 cup milk and mix until the dough holds together).  Add the dumplings by spoonfuls to the simmering pot, it's ok if they crowd together they will still be separate when cooked - cover and let steam without removing lid for 20 minutes.  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe.  This is the first time I made chicken and dumplings.  I read and used suggestions from other reviews.  First, I fried 1 cup chopped onions 1/2 cup celery and 1/2 cup carrots.  Then I added 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery, 2 cups chicken broth.  I purchased a pre-made chicken and added that along with bisquick dumplings and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of Vermouth.  Excellent!!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  Even though it's super-easy, it still tastes wonderful!  Like many others I boil my chicken in 2 cups of chicken broth (plus extra water to cover).  I save all of the liquid that I end up with because my boyfriend likes the end result to be just-this-side of soupy.  I also use breasts instead of thighs because he's not a fan of dark meat.  Delicious, simple, and very comforting!

My husband has always talked about how good his mother's chicken and dumplings were when he was younger.  So, I decided to try this recipe to see if it could compete.  Well, he loved it and so did I.  It was the first time I had ever had chicken and dumpling.  I decide to make a few changes like some of the other. I used cream of chicken instead and Flour tortillas because I didn't have bisquick.. It turned out GREAT! My husband didn't even know until I told him what it did.  For all you chicken dumplings lover.  Try the
flour tortillas it's easy and quick you may like it.

This was fabulous!  However, I did change it as others had done.  I cooked 1 lb of chicken breast in with 6 cups of 98%FF Chicken Broth, 1 cup of white wine, a heaping tablespoon of galic, and 2 carrots cut into quarters and sliced.  I added cooked peas to the simmer and used small biscuit dough pulled in half.  My husband, 9 year old and my 18 month old loved it.

My boyfriend and I loved this!  I followed many of the suggestions and boiled the chicken in 1 can chicken broth, 1/2 cup white wine, water, 2 bay leaves, and 1 tbsp minced onion.  I used 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of celery.  I omitted the salt, added 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 3/4 tsp pepper to the soup mixture.  I used one can of Grands buttermilk biscuits, torn off and flattened before added to soup.  It all turned out wonderfully tasty and easy!

What a great and easy recipe.  Following the advice from other reviews, I covered four skinless, boneless chicken thighs with one cup broth, two cups water, 1/2 of dry Chardonnay, three chopped carrots, two chopped celery stalks, 1/2 chopped onion and two smashed garlic cloves (which I later removed).  It was creamy and flavorful.  I highly recommend.  And you only dirty one pot!

I used chicken breast also. I substituted a can of cream of celery for a cream of chicken. Next time I will save 4 cans of broth from the boiled chicken, so that it will be a little more soupy and not so thick. This was very good. I can't wait to make it again.

Very good! I took others' recommendations:
1) 2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup of water, some garlic and a couple dashes of minced onions to boil the chicken.

2) 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.

3) Used Bisquik to make dumplings per instrustions on package.

So quick and easy!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and chicken bouillon cubes.  I then used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery (both the 98% fat free kind) and this was delicious!  It tasted just as good as the ones I used to make that took forever!!

This is really good especially for a chill winter evening. Very easy to make but the taste just as good as when you make it from scratch. I used 2 chicken broth and 1 cup of water to boil the chicken, add 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom, I also added 2 cubes of chicken buillon. No need to added onions and garlic anymore. It tastes very good already. Thanks Melissa.

Great recipe, very very easy.  I took the advise of other reviewers and used 1 can cream of chicken, and 1 can cream of mushroom.  In addition I cooked the chicken in chicken broth.  A delightful meal for a winter evening.

This was delicious!!! So easy to make after working all day! I didn't add any carrots or celery but I should have and will next time. My husband isn't normally a fan of soup and salad night, but he was the night I made this!

First cool day of the year, and was in the mood for something warm and filling.  This was it for sure.  I added four cloves of garlic, pressed, and a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I used chicken broth to cook the thighs and used 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken.  I also threw in some dried herbs like sage, thyme and oregano.  It is salty, so don't add salt!  Make sure to have some bread to dip in the delicious broth.

Soooooo good and easy!  I followed other reviewers in replacing one cup of water with chicken broth, and used one can of cream of celery, one can of cream of potato, and added a can of corn and a can of peas.  I also used white pepper instead of black - it was delicious and really filling!  Will definitely be making this again.

I use a can of cream of celery, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. I boil the chicken thighs in chicken broth and I also add a bag of mixed veggies. I typically buy two packages of biscuit dough. I add one the first time making it and the second for leftovers. YUMMMM

It had a good texture & it was good but kind of boring. As others have suggested, we boiled chkn in 3 cans chicken broth & added onion, celery & peas, & garlic. Will be looking for more spices to add.

This was a good recipe, but only because I changed it according to one of the other ratings. I added peas and carrots, used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery, rolled the biscuits in flour before dropping the pieces in, added sauteed onions, and used more chicken than the recipe called for. If I had not done these things, I believe the recipe would have been rather bland. I was not a huge fan, but my husband absolutly loved it! Next time, I will do homemade dumplings using Bisquick or Pioneer and just throw it on top of the mix and let it cook. This way, it will be fluffy instead of thick and doughy, like it turned out using canned biscuits.

Used one chicken breast cooked in 2 cups water and one can of chicken broth.  Substituted one can of cream of celery for a can of cream of chicken.  One can of dough was NOT enough - use 2 - this is yummy - everyone is going to want more!  Use a BIG pot so you can cook all the dumplings at once and they are not crowded.  A keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor and the sauce base was wonderful. My only issue is that the refrigerated biscuts were kind of heavy and slimey. I took them out and made the old stand by of the bisquick ones and that was so much better! Nice and Light and fluffy!

We love this recipe.  Like most users, I changed it a bit.  I make a large pot to get 2 nights worth of dinners out of it.  I use 3 cans of cream of celery soup, 6 cans of chicken broth, 4 cans of biscuits (we like alot of dumplings), and a bag of frozen soup veggies.  I cook the chicken in the crock pot while I am at work and put this all together when I get home.  My family just loves it.  Thanks for a great starter recipe!!

I used chicken breast instead of the thighs and two cans cream of chicken soup, since I had it on hand.  My boyfriend took 1 bite and said it was the best Chicken and Dumplings he had ever eaten.  I almost felt guilty accepting the compliment because it was SO easy.

I accidentally bought two cans of cream of chicken soup and it was still great! I added 1/3c each of onion, celery, carrot and sauteed it; then I added 3 cups of canned chicken broth; the two cans of chicken soup and then I added the shredded chicken breast from a store bought rotis. chicken. I brought ingredients to a boil, put in on simmer and added the biscuits/dumplings on top. Voila!

Tasted very, very strongly of celery.  I would suggest using Cream of Chicken or Mushroom in the place of one or both of the cans of Cream of Celery if you don't like a strong celery flavor.

I changed a few things with this recipe.  I used 3 boneless/skinless chickn breasts and 6 breast tenderloins in place of the thighs since our grocery store does not carry thighs.  I used 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken, and 1 can cream of mushroom.  I also used 3 cans of chicken broth plus 3 cans of water.  When making the sauce I used 5 1/2 cups of the broth/water mixture.  Also included celery.

The sauce was fantastic but the dumplings were a little slimy for my taste.  I flattened the dough before putting them in the pot but they still took quite a while to cook.  At least a half hour.

My husband loved it so I'll be making it again, but I think next time I'll boil the dumplings in broth with the celery then add the sauce and chicken.

My thighs wern't boneless & I took the skin off first to cut down on the fat. I  used low sodium chicken broth (w/ about  a cup  of pinot grigio...maybe less) to cook the chicken & I added chopped celery, a couple of cloves of roasted garlic, frozen peas, pepper, thyme, oregano & a little basil...as well as a little onion powder. I also used Healthy Choice cream soups to lessen the sodium. I tore my biscuits up into little pieces & tossed them in...giving them one stir, put the lid on a left them alone for 15 minutes. The grands loved it...thanks!

5 star with some small changes- covered skinless boneless chix breasts with broth rather then water.  Boiled about 20 minutes with carrots, celery and peas, then shredded chix and put back in pot with the cr of celery soup and dropped homemade BISQUICK dumplings and simmered for about 15 minutes.  incredible!  will be making often- SO EASY!  Husband loooooved this- even for lunch the next day..

Wow!  Amazing!  I made some changes, too.  I used 1/2 water and 1/2 low sodium chicken stock, doubled the recipe (we have a big family) and used two cans of cream of chicken, two cream of celery.  Added one diced onion, fresh baby carrots, bay leaves, garlic powder, parsely and cracked peppercorn.  Then I decided it was a little too salty and added about 1/2 c. milk!  Yum!  Oh, and I used my grandmothers favorite, bone and skin on thighs (makes tender juicy chicken and broth that is to die for!).  Then I made bisquick dumplings (wayyyy better than canned if you have the time).  I served this with peach pound cake for dessert and it was all gobbled up!  Even took some to my son's elderly sunday school teacher and it was so good it brought tears to her eyes!  Just like her mom used to make her when she was little!  You gotta try this one...with or without the modifications you will loveee it!

I can't believe how tasty this was!  I did try the canned biscuits and was not impressed so I fished them out and made real dumplings that I dropped on top.  For anyone thinking that this recipe would just taste like condensed soup - TRY IT.

Makes a good winter dish.  I didn't use refrigerated biscuits, but I made my dumplings with Bisquick (2 c. bisquick and 2/3 c. milk).  I added one can of drained corn and one chopped onion.  Other than that, I followed the basics of the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Great and EASY!  I used 3 chicken breasts (the frozen kind that come in a bag)...I defrost them in the microwave until only the center is slightly frozen and then boil them until cooked through.  I use one can of low sodium cream of celery and one can low sodium cream of mushroom.  I also add a few dashes of celery salt and tons of fresh ground pepper.  I find that the Pilsbury 1869 Biscuits work the best for this recipe.  It's so wonderful!  My husband LOVES it!

What an easy and good soup! If using chicken with a bone, cook a little longer. I used 5-6 cups water and 3 chicken bouillon cubes tnen kept the extra stock when reserving the 3-4 cups in the pot. It was so easy to make on a cold Michigan day and I didn't have to leave the house to buy any ingredients.

I used leftover turkey breast and cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken since that is what I had in the pantry.  My family loved it and thought the dumplings were homemade!  Great!

Excellent!  So simple and soooo good!  I took the advice in the other reviewers and cooked the chicken in broth instead of water, and substituted a can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom for the cream of celery (I'm not a big celery fan...).  Made the dumplings from scratch using the super easy recipe submitted by Carol.  Unbelievable results!  Definitely a new staple in our house :)

This tasted sooo good.  I couldn't get my "dumplings" to cook all the way though.  I ended up putting the chicken on a cheddar/herb biscuit & it was outstanding.  Definately a winner in our house.  Cooked the thighs in broth, also added onion, mushroom, celery & carrots.  Seasoned w/ Montreal Chicken seasoning, lemon pepper, garlic & paprika.  Next time we will try it with phesant.  Great recipe Melissa!

Really good.  Used reduced-fat soups, Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken instead.

I used 1 cream of celery and 1 cream of chicken soup. I added a dash of poultry seasoning, diced some fresh carrots and onions, also frozen peas. I added about another cup or so of low-sodium chicken broth as my husband doesn't like it too thick. As per other reviewer, I did get a non-grand, non-flaky biscuit dough (Pillsbury - white packaging). Squeezed each piece in between my thumb and forefinger before dropping it in the pot. They came out just like real dumplings, instead of cakey/bready texture. This recipe is truly a keeper. It can't get any easier than this.

I didnt care for this recipe and nobody in my family really did either.  i used pillsbury grands homestyle biscuits and they seemed rubbery and not fluffy.  Also, I couldnt get past the cream of celery smell - not for me.  i added cooked carrots and celery and i think without them it would have been really boring.
2nd time made: boiled whole chicken in water seasoned with pepper/garlic seasoning, garlic salt, minced onion, and parsley.  used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. added pre-cooked carrots. made dumplings with Bisquick mix and added parsley and basil to them.  Took about 25 minutes til it was done.  Much, much better!!  Next time I will just add a little salt to the chicken/soup mixture.

A few changes I made were using 2-3 chicken breasts as I prefer white meat. I also cooked the chicken breasts in 2 cans of vegetable broth along with carrots, celery, corn and fresh chopped garlic. I also used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of mushroom. I used bisquick. Rather than dropping biscuits into pan on stovetop I put everything in a casserole dish, drop biscuits on top and bake for 10-15 minutes. I prefer the crisper baked texture over the slightly soggy texture you get with traditional dumplings.

Delicious... addictive... amazing.   I had never made chicken and dumplings before... but, man, was this recipe easy!  The only thing I changed was that I shredded chicken breasts instead because it was just what I had on hand.  Great Recipe!

This was RIDICULOUSLY awesome and easy! Used a little over 2 cups of chicken broth and about 1 cup of water to boil 5 chicken breasts. Added some frozen peas and carrots and 3 bay leaves.  Used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery. Used 1 can (~12 oz) of Grands reduced fat buttermilk biscuits. My family devoured it! Can't wait to make it again.

I cooked a chopped onion and 3 garlic cloves in olive oil, then added 8 bone-in chicken thighs with chicken broth to cover and boiled for one hour. I also added carrots, celery and a bay leaf. I let the chicken cool in the broth before cleaning and shredding, pureed the carrot and celery, and added it all back to the broth after I skimmed off the fat.  I added a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of mushroom, then brought to a boil. I also 1/2 cup of frozen peas. I used canned biscuit dough for the dumplings, cutting them into pieces, then flattening them before adding them to the broth.  They took 25 minutes: 15 minutes without the lid, additional 10 minutes with the lid on. This was the best, and so easy! Next time I'll boil a whole chicken to shred, just because it was 'just enough' for my family, and I'd like some leftovers.

I got a lot of great ideas from the other reviews and did a mix of a few suggestions. I used 2 cans of Swanson's chicken broth and added some minced garlic (about 6 cloves), minced onion (half an onion), parsley, basil, a few bay leaves, black pepper and garlic salt (I was pretty generous with this as it seemed to really bring the flavor to it's best....maybe about 2-3 TBS) and boiled the chicken in that for about 20 min. After I took out the chicken I added a can of: cream of celery, cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, one can of water and one can of sweet peas (drained; I like them better than frozen) to the pot and simmered that while I cut up the chicken. Then added the chicken & biscuits from a can. This was soooooo tasty and delicious. My whole family loves it! :)

A new family favorite! I made this for the first time before the holidays and my husband still requests it. I made a few revisions with what I had. I used chicken breast instead of thighs. I added I can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery and used bisquick mix mixed with milk instead of bisquits. Also added chopped carrots and celery. Turned out great.

My husband claims to hate Chicken and Dumplings, thanks to his mom.  He loved this.  The kids too.  Even the leftovers disappeared.  I did modify, using the chicken broth and keeping it...and sauted the oniion and garlic.  Delicious.

Excellent! Almost as good as my homemade but with a lot less time and effort. I used boneless skinless breasts in lieu of thighs and added 2 stalks finely diced celery and 1/2 large finely diced onion. Cooked together in chicken broth along with garlic powder and 1 can cr. celery and 1 can cr. chicken soup. Added dumplings that I rolled into tiny balls and flour. 8 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered. Added chicken and thickened a bit with flour water and parsley flakes. I'll have to double the recipe as never have any leftovers and tastes even better the next day. For the cooks who say it tastes too much like celery, substitute 1 or both cans with cr. of chicken. Comfort food at it's best. Adding frozen peas at end gives it a vibrant and appealing contrast.

This gets 5 stars from me based on its simplicity combined with great taste. I have an extremely picky crew. It's hard to please everyone, but this recipe does the job! I usually fix a very similar recipe in a slow cooker, but was low on time and not prepared. This was so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I did use chicken breasts because I keep them in my freezer. I used cream of chicken soup because my 15 year old daughter would be simply mortified at the thought of vegetables in her favorite dish. This will be a recipe that will be used over and over in this household, and I see it in my daughters' future as part of theirs! Thanks of posting!

I'm sorry, but this just did not taste like real chicken and dumplings.  I felt like I was eating a can of cream of celery soup that just happened to have pieces of dough and chicken in it.  My family didn't like it either.  Sorry, but I will not be making this again.

This was an excellent base and I tweaked it a bit.  First, I sauteed a large chopped onion, 3 chopped carrots and 3 cloves of garlic in about 1 1/2 T. of butter.  I let that cook down, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes and then added a can of chicken broth, a can of veg broth and 1/2 can of water, along with about 1 t. each of basil, thyme and rosemary.  When that boiled, I added 8 strips of chicken breast and let that cook for 15 minutes. I removed the chicken breasts and put them in the fridge to cool while I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and one of cream of chicken.  I let that come back to a boil and added the chicken (after chopping it) and about 1 t. of pepper.  On the advice of another reviewer, I cut into quarters a package of Grands Buttermilk biscuits and added them one by one when the whole mix came back to a boil.  I let the dough simmer in the soup for about 12 minutes before serving.  I don't eat meat, but I made this for a sick friend who won't eat chicken noodle and he said it's one of the best chicken and dumplings soups he's ever had.  Added bonus: it was terribly easy and pretty cheap.  I might even replace the chicken broth and cream of chicken soup with veggie alternatives and try the mix myself!  Enjoy!

Can you say comfort food? This another dish that I make for myself or my boyfriend when we are sick, paired with some ginger ale, and usually everything's better the next day, despite the dairy products in here. As a poor college student, this is well within my budget, and very easy to assemble! Makes a hearty lunch or light dinner well, I also usually experiment and throw a different kind of vegetable in there every time. Carrot, celery, and potato have gotten the best reviews so far.

I have made this for many years using lots of the revisions already mentioned, except to avoid that canned biscuit letdown as dumplings, I use flour tortillas cut into strips.  They cook much faster and they really taste more like dumplings (and not at all like tortillas).  Good recipe!

I love this recipe!!  It is so easy and takes hardly any effort to make.  Perfect for a cold Sunday.  I add extra "dumplings" so there is virtually no liquid and it is still fantastic.

This was easy and good. I took the advice from others and used Bisquick to make the biscuits. I also used 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom.

So So So good.  I used boneless chicken breast and boiled it in water, salt, garlic and wine seasoning and a splash of white wine.  I added 10 baby carrots and a half of onion and used one can cream of celery and one can cream of chicken and made dumplings out of Bisquick.  Absolutely delicious

So yummy! I followed other reviewers and added chicken stock to the water when poaching, used one can of cream of chicken soup in place of one can of cream of celery, and added frozen diced onions to the soup (about 1 cup). I used Bisquik and added onion powder and garlic powder to the dough for the dumplings. My dumplings really puffed up in the soup so next time I will make them smaller.My whole family loved it!

This was so good!  I made a few changes after reading some reviews.  I added about 2 cups of chopped onion, celery, carrots and garlic.  I also reduced the chicken to just 2 thighs, I prefer less meat in soups and stews. I also cooked the dumplings for 8 minutes covered and then 10 uncovered. I will be making this again!

Excellent recipe!  This is so easy to make.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup, and I added a pack of Ramen Noodle chicken flavored seasoning to the water when I boiled the chicken.  (I didn't have any boullion cubes.)  I used Grands Biscuits and I agree that the definitely need to be cooked longer than 8 minutes.  As suggested by other users, I tore the biscuits into 6 pieces each and cooked them for 8 minutes uncovered and then 8-10 minutes covered.  I thought they turned out great.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I love it!  How could you NOT call this Chicken and Dumplings????

this recipe makes a nice dinner. i knew it would be good but wanted a complete meal so i added sauteed onion & carrots. i also used 3 chicken breasts (what i had on hand), 1 can cream of celery soup + 1 can cream of chicken soup (as suggested by several reviewers). to those who are afraid that the dumplings won't cook through....make the stew on your stovetop, pour it into a buttered casserole, place quartered biscuits on top then sprinkle on a little cayenne pepper. bake at 350 degrees until golden brown. thanks melissa!

Delicious and so easy! I also added veggies (carrots, peas, diced potato and onion). Another change I made was to use breast meat instead of thighs. Next time around I'll use 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery... just a personal preference. Kids and hubby loved this one, it's real comfort food!

If you thought this recipe was to doughy, try a different brand of biscuits. The first time I had this I used a "Southern Style" biscuit and it was wonderful. Second time I used what was on hand at home and it was very doughy. I also add some chopped baby carrots, yummy!

This is very simple, which earns lots of points from me, but the taste isn't fabulous. It just the basic chicken dumpling soup. I split the recipe in 1/2: one with chicken and the other half with veggies only. I used veggie broth, carrots, and cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic (in place of the second cream of celery) in the veggie version. i did the same, but used the chicken water in the chicken batch. I'll make this again, but next time I'll add a bag of mixed veggies.

Very quick and easy, and my husband and the boys loved it.  Made with boneless, skinless breasts instead of thighs, just because we like white meat better.  Used less chicken and added peas and carrots.  Great for when you are short of time but want a comfort food.

My husband and 13 year old son did not like this at all and they are not picky eaters!
Followed other suggestions, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, cook in chicken broth & wine, used boneless chicken breasts, used bisquick recipe for dumplings,added carrots... but it wasn't good. Will not make again.  I was shocked because it got such great reviews.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, i decided to try it last night when i was stressed to find something quick and easy for dinner. this turned out wonderful with the 1 can cream of chick and 1 can cream of mushroom modifications! i also added canned diced potatoes (the largest can) and a small can of carrots for some color. i used butter croissant rolls make to make the dumplings and they turned out great. thanks for the new family favorite!

Great soup.  I used pilsburry biscuts and found them to taste too sweet.  I am going to use the bisquick recipe for dumplings next time.

I followed a lot of the suggestions and cooked my chicken in broth. I also used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken. I added some sliced onion and my own blend of spices. It was really great and even better a couple of days later. I served it with fresh garlic bread and it was a great combo.

I used chicken breasts because I don't like dark meat.  I thought this sounded a little bland, but my family loved it!  I was quite impressed myself.  I had some left over Campbell's chicken noodle ABC soup from lunch so I added water to that and boiled my chicken with it and it was fabulous!!!  My boys didn't even notice the few letters that were mixed in.  I will make this again.  Thanks!
I am updating this review.  We have made this a whole bunch of times.  I now add the dumplings to the water and boil for a few minutes while I cut up the chicken.  Then I add the soups and chicken.  This way the dumplings are fluffier and not as dense as when I added them with the soup.

A nice creamy taste to the soup.  I used 1/2 cream of celery and 1/2 cream of chicken.  I added asparagus and celery because i was in serious need of getting rid of them.  I had to make the dumplings from scratch because I didn't have the store bought kind.  My fiance loved it with stuffing to sop up the juice.  I enjoyed it with a cup of jasmine rice in the soup.

This recipe was really, really good. I changed a few things. I used chicken broth instead of water which gave it a real rich flavor and used 1 can cream of chicken instead of celery b/c my husband doesn't care much for the celery flavor. I also added 1 1/2 cups milk to make creamy. I cooked a little longer and it was wonderful!

This is a delicious and easy recipe.  In fact, it has become one of my husband's "comfort" foods.  I have made it with cream of celery soup and I have also made it (based on other reviews) with cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  Both tasted very good.  I didn't use dark meat, although I bet that adds even more flavor.  I usually only have frozen chicken tenders on hand so I thawed some of those, cut them up, cooked them, and then added them to the mix.  It really tasted great!

I have to admit I was skeptical that something so easy could come out so good, but this recipe proved me wrong.  I did make a few adjustments, as I can never seem to follow a recipe completely.  I added onion, celery, poultry seasoning and bay leaves to the chicken while it boiled and used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken (as has been suggested before).  You really do need to make "tiny balls" as one reviewer pointed out.  I made mine a little larger than a marble and found that even that was too big.  This is hands down the best chicken and dumplings I've ever made, even my husband said so!

My family loves this when I make it!  I love the simplicity of it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My husband particularly likes the flavor of the biscuits - gives just a touch of buttery sweetness.

GREAT MEAL! I am a relatively new cook, and this recipe was fast and easy. I only made one change: instead of packaged biscuit dough, I used the recipe on a box of Bisquick I had. It was still wonderful!

Great base.  I add peas and carrots like many others have said.  I made dumplings from scratch one time and noone in my fam liked it as much as using the canned bisquits!  I agree to I prefer the bisquits.  Super easy yet homemade tasting.

This is a delicious recipe for chicken and dumplins* It's a lil different from my grandmothers, she never used carrots or celery, but you can't beat this recipe.  A lovely dish* I've made it 3 times  now!

Very easy to make. I had a lot of Bisquick to use up so I made the biscuits instead. I just dropped spoonfuls into the gravy to cook.  I make this every couple of months and left overs are still very good.

Tried this for the first time today and I must say the whole bunch loved it! Even my 11 year old had 2 bowls and she doesn't do vegetables. I did tweak it a bit... I did not drain it and added 1 can of cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and sauted onions and garlic in butter and added to the chicken stock. It was delish!

So good! I used one can of cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken. I sauteed onion, garlic and mushrooms before adding to the soup. This was a huge hit! Thanks for the keeper.

I gave this 3 stars because it is far too plain. A great basic recipe though. I used 3 cans cream of chicken and also a can of chicken broth. Added spices: adobo, sazon, oregano, lil tiny bit of minced garlic and lil bit of powdered onion (don't like the onion but like the flavor), also used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and sliced the pillsbury homestyle buttery flavor rolls into about 15 squares each roll. I used my hands to press it into a flat pancake and used a pizza cutter to save time cutting. I also added carrots and celery to my batch. Hubby and kids jump for joy when I make it. We also serve it over white rice sometimes....

This is good for a "quick and dirty" version of chicken and dumplings.  My variation includes breasts instead of thighs, one can cream of celery, one can cream of chicken, diced onion, celery, and carrots, salt and a couple dashes of white pepper.  The family LOVES it.

This was a good base recipe, but I did more than a little tweaking.  First, I sauteed about a cup and a half of finely diced celery and onion.  I added sliced mushrooms halfway thru the sauteeing.  Meanwhile, I boiled 4 large chicken breasts in 2 cans of chicken broth and a can of water (adjust to cover chicken).  Once the veggies were completey sauteed, I added them to the chicken and broth continuing to boil.  Then I diced some carrots and added them.  Once the chicken was cooked thru I removed from pot, shredded and returned to pot.  Then I added 2 cans of condensed cream of celery and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Seasoned with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  Lastly, I added the biscuit dough bits and cooked on med-low heat until the dough sank.  Hearty and delicious!

I made some changes, like others did...I sauted one diced onion in some olive oil, added four sliced carrots and three stalks of celery. I used three sliced chicken breasts, boiled all in chicken broth (1 box), added one can of cream of celery and two cans of cream of chicken soup, one can of water and a clove of garlic.  Pinched off pieces of bisquets and let cook for about twenty minutes and peppered to taste.  Delicious!!! Will definitely make again!

Really great. I followed a lot of the reccomendations and used a cup of chicken broth to replace one of the 3 cups of chicken boiling water.  I also used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery instead of two of the celery. I like my chicken and dumplings to be more like pot pie filling so I threw in a bag of mixed carrots and peas for added substance. Fantastic!

As my husband said, "EXCELLENT!"  

What is really nice about this basic receipe, is that it can be modified to anyone's taste as so noted in the reviews with different soups, different vegtables, etc.

I'm sure the next time I make this receipe it will not be the same as the first time.   Basic, easy, and delicious, that's what every working busy mom/father likes.

Delicious and incredibly easy.  I am by no means a cook and even I was able to use the basic recipe and suggestions and come up with a meal my 5 year old and 20 month old and my husband all ate.  I used one can of cream of potato and one of cream of celery, added sauteed onions and one diced yellow potato plus some thinly sliced carrots and a cup of whole milk to make it more creamy. Some garlic to top it off because everything is better with a little garlic!  Left-overs were thicker and almost like a loaded baked potato. Yum!

Excellent!  Like others I added carrots, celery, some garlic (while the chicken was boiling), and used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery, but prepared the rest the same.  Second time and my Southern grown husband loves it.  Thanks, Melissa.

This was a last minute thing for me my son came home sick and wanted chicken and dumplings so we raided the pantry to see if we could make this. I didn't have everything but with some adjustments we worked it out. I made some adjustments after reading the other reviews. I put 1C carrots thick sliced and 1C celery thick chopped and 1 onion chopped and sauteed them in butter and added them to the soup. I didn't have 2 cream of celery soups so I used 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of celery and 1 chicken stock. I also used 2 12.5 oz cans of chunk chicken instead of the thighs. Turned out great though.

I was a little skeptical when I came across this "simple" recipe while searching for something to do with the chicken thighs sitting in the fridge.  I decided to try it even though we had never had chicken and dumplings before.  My kids loved it!  All four asked for seconds and some thirds.  We ran out.  The only changes I made was adding some sauteed onion and celery, boiling in chicken stock and using one can of cream on chicken and one of cream of celery.  We will definitely be doing this one again.

Very yummy for a basic Chicken & Dumplings recipe.  My hubby doesn't love veggies, so he was happy to see those left out.  I, however, missed them.  Will probably add a bag of mixed veggies next time. Or at least some carrots.

This is the quick recipe taught to me by my German grandmother with a few slight differences. We used a whole chicken boiled with bay leaves.  Remove chicken and bay leaves and allow chicken to cool a little.  While it is cooling, I put two cans of dumplings, each biscuit cut into halves, into the pot and cook without stirring, just push the dumplings back under water occasionally until they are plump and cooked.  Add back shredded chicken, salt and pepper to taste.  Be sure and buy cheap canned biscuits because they hold up better in the water.

Wonderful comfort food!  Of course I modified it to fit my families taste, but I always do.  My family won't eat anything but white meet, so I used breasts, but I also cooked them in chicken broth to make sure we weren't missing out on flavor.  Added chopped onion, carrots, and celery.  Sauteed them first to make sure they were cooked through. Used cream of mushroom, and added celery salt, garlic, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  SO yummy!! Thank you for the recipe!

(revised review) I just made again using regular Pillsbury dough not the Simply and hmmm too mushy.  So disappointed. And this time I made exactly as recipe called except white meat both times. (1st review)Mmmmm.  Delicious!  So quick and easy.  I hate it when people tweak the recipes, but I didn't want it thick so only used 1 can c o c soup and more broth.  I also wanted some chunkiness so added celery and onions. The new Pillsbury Simply biscuits worked wonderfully.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this quite salty. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I have never had Chicken and Dumplings, I think you may need to have grown up with them, 'cause I found the dumplings weird...kept thinking they weren't cooked...I won't be making this again...

Haven't made this for 20 years probably, when I use to make it when my kids were little.  Kind of neat to rediscover it and make it for the next generation of little ones  :-)  Like many others, this was my base.  I had already started cooking the chicken with onion, roasted garlic, basil, celery seed, salt, pepper, a shot of baslamic, as my chicken was frozen and I wanted it to start cooking while I decided what to do with it.   Decided on the biscuit dumpling but also added some frozen veggies, and about a half cup of sour cream with chives, and then as the biscuits cooked I shredded a marble cheese on top.  Oh, and I meant to add COCelery soup, but accidentally opened the COBrocolli instead.  It was all very good, very tasty.  Quick and easy one pot meal.

This was incredibly easy to make--love it!! The whole family enjoyed this, even the 6-yr-old who tried to say the dumplings were "soggy" but he still ate them all!

I am a first time C&D maker.  I will have to say that I was a little surprised by this.  It was quite good... though a few elements surprised me.  Instead of boiling my chicken, I shredded a rotisserie chicken and used all chicken broth for a base.  I used 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of celery.  I added a can of drained peas/carrots as well.  The only element that really surprised me were the dumplings.  I didn't care for them too much though I guess not knowing what to expect -- when you put the biscuits in the soup mixture they puff up... and then they shrink down to almost nothing.  I used 1.5 cans of biscuits (since I had smaller cans--I think they were 7 or 8 oz containers) and it still didn't seem like much after they shrank down.  Next time I'll definitely leave the biscuits in larger chunks.  It was surprisingly good, however.  I will make it again.

A superbly delicious soup that was perfect for the 20 degree we were having here in Maryland.  The boyfriend said it was one of the best meals ever made, so 5 stars is really less than what we would have rated it.  Thanks to all the tips and suggestions of the fellow users, I had a perfect soup!

Awesome base for a recipe, but I made changes per various reviews.  Use one can cream chicken and one can cream celery soup.  Use a carton of chicken broth to cover chicken when simmering.  Also added a chopped onion, two celery stalks sliced, two carrots sliced, clove garlic minced and about a tablespoon poultry seasoning.  Turned out awesome!  Definitely a new favorite in our house.

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I used abotu 5 cans of chicken broth and boilded the chicken in it along with 2 cloves of garlic and a quartered onion.  Used bisquick for the dumplings, 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery.  Added a can of carrots and peas and some poultry seasoning.  It smelled heavenly and was to die for.  I served over rice.  Yum, thanks Melissa for sharing.

This was so easy and tasty. There wasn't anything left. I did modify it a bit, but I am sue if made exactly as recipe...it would be equally delish! I did add some celery and carrots, and used celery soup, with chicken soup. YUM!

My family loved this dish. I used chicken stock instead of water and added onions, celery and carrots for added flavor. Chicken was tender and delicious. Make sure you don't get the biscuits that have butter in them, it will make the dish greasy!

A very awesome and easy recipe.  I did have to modify it.  I used a leftover roasted chicked so I just added 3cups of broth instead of the first step.  Then I had one can celery soup and one mushroom cream of muchroom soup and added garlic and onion powder.

Amazing! I had actually never even tasted chicken and dumplings when I made this. My friend and I were sitting around my house one day and we wanted to cook and she mentioned chicken and dumplings, so I got on here and found this recipe. Wow...really good! I even went to Cracker Barrel and ordered chicken and dumplings and they were disgusting! I used thigh meat instead of breasts just because I don't really like white meat all that much and I also used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. I also added some cajun seasoning to spice it up just because we love spicy!!!

This was very good! I have tried several recipes for chicken and dumplings, finally giving up. But tonight I proved that I can make chicken and dumplings.  I was disappointed to see that I was out of cream of celery, and substituted one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken. I also replaced one cup of water with chicken broth and a tbls. of chicken bouillon, per the advice of other reviewers. And, as most meals in our home are not complete without it, I added one tsp. hot-sauce. I found that smaller dumplings are better, so I flattened the biscuits and cut small pieces with meat scissors. Turned out the perfect size. Each biscuits equaled about 20 dumplings. Thank you for sharing an awesome recipe. I can not wait to try it again with cream of celery. I believe it will make an awesome meal even better!

This is the first time I have ever made Chicken and Dumplings. It turned out so good!! I used 1 can cream of celery, 1 can of cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chicken. I added 1 can of peas, and I used all chicken breast. I took plain biscuits, and cut each one into fours when all the chicken broth, and soups were boiling for 15 min. then I added my already cooked shreaded chicken breast to that. I used a lot of black pepper, and a little salt. OMG it is so goooood!!! I think it tastes just like my grandma's did when I was growing up!!

I tweaked, and it was wonderful! First time to make for kids, 10 and 8, they loved it. I boiled 3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts in water, then added an onion (chunked), 2 stalks celery sliced; 16 ozs crinkle cut carrots, 1 cup frozen corn, and 1/2 cup frozen peas. Also added homemade balsamic/Italian vinegar dressing which gave the broth a rich, deep flavor. After boiling 20 mins, I shredded the meat, then returned to the broth. Added 1 can cr. mushroom soup and 1 can cr. chicken soup, whisked to combine, then took another's tip about using regular biscuits and pinching off thumb-sized bits. I added enough to cover the top of the broth/veggie/chicken mixture and simmered on med-hi for almost 20 mins. Next time if I don't have balsamic dressing, I'll add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar to the broth as chicken boils for a wonderful flavor. I got this idea while making ribs, and one recipe called for adding 1/2 cup teriyaki to the water. Same idea, different acid, worked great and I'll do it again. Thanks for the post; kids can't wait to have leftovers for dinner tomorrow night! (me neither: cook once, eat twice!)

This is a good quick meal to make. Not as good as "real" chicken & dumplings of course, but definitely very tasty, especially compared to the ease of preparation. I did boil my chicken in chicken broth with poultry seasoning, a little terragon, garlic, celery, and onion and I used one can of cream of chicken & one can of cream of celery, but I think even as stated, the dish would be quite delicious. I will definitely keep this recipe for quick comfort food meals.

Yum, just yum. I threw in some carrots, celery, and zucchini for veggie health. Spice wise, I added garlic, thyme and a bay leaf. Turned out wonderful. Took another reviewers advice and cooked up 1/2 of the dumplings first and then the second half for left overs. Be careful not to crowd your pot otherwise the dumplings get icky. Four stars because I added spices and garlic

Ok so I changed this all around, but it turned out delish!  I made chicken stock from the bones and skin of 2 roasted whole chicken breasts I had on hand.  Used 3 cups of water, carrots, celery, one chicken boullion cube and spices in the stock.  Strained the stock of the chicken pieces then added one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery along with the breast meat and biscuits.  Absolutely great comfort food and will definitely make exactly this way many times to come!

Great recipe. I made the following modifications to make it a bit healthier without sacrifing any flavor. I tend to use a lot of organic ingredients so you will see those call outs in my reviews.

1. Sauteed in the pot: 1/2 cup of organic sweet walla walla onion & celery (4 stalks) both finely chopped, 1/4 cup chopped celery leaves (from the stalks), and two fresh garlic cloves (thru a garlic press) - in 1 Tbsp of Non-Hydrogenated Earth Balance Buttery Spread (comes in tub). 
2. Placed 4 Free Range / Organic boneless skinless chicken breasts on top of sauteed mixture in pot and poured in about 20oz of Free Range organic Chicken Broth (Pacific Natural Foods brand).
3. Covered pot and boiled on Med/Hi for 15 minutes. Removed chicken to a plate to cool.
4. Stirred into broth (1) can Healthy Request Cream of Celery Soup, and (2) cans of Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup. 
5. Pulled apart chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and placed back into pot.
6. Added a half bag of organic peas & carrots.
7. Added All natural Sea Salt and Organic Veggie Pepper & Parsley. 

For the dumplings I used 3/4 of the Pillsbury Grand Buttermilk Biscuit (refrigerated) dough. (Generally I would use Gluten Free boxed biscuit mix, but didn't have any on hand). Cut them into bite size pieces and rolled into balls. Added those into the pot and cooked on medium for about 10 minutes, then reduced heat to Med/Low and simmered for about 15 minutes. Baked the unused biscuits in the oven for breakfast san

I altered this a little by omitting the soup and just using about 5 cups of broth (water & bouillion).  Next time I will have to increase the broth because my family of five at it all up!  I took a couple of tips from others and started by cooking some diced onion & garlic in a little butter before adding the chicken & broth.  I also added celery and carrots, a bay leaf, parsley, salt & pepper.  It was VERY flavorful.  And the refrigerated biscuits could not be easier!  This was a big hit with my family.  Even my pickiest eater was pleased.  Thanks for the post.

We kept back 3 cups of water and the soup is a little runny for our taste, so we just thickened it up with some flour and it was pretty darn good. It will be a repeat in our house for sure! Other than thickening it was good JUST AS IT WAS!

I made a few changes.  I boiled a whole chicken and when I pulled the chicken out of the pot, to cool, I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cream of celery soup, celery flakes (I didn't have any celery), salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  I then dropped the biscuit dumplings in and let cook, then I pulled the chicken apart and added it back to the stock and dumplings.  I spooned into a bowl, salt and peppered again and topped with some celery flakes.  They were a delicious!!

Great and easy recipe!  I made this for my boyfriend and me for dinner.  It was delicious!  We're having leftovers for lunch today.  I used 4 chicken breasts instead of the 6 thighs.  I also used 1 can  cream of celery soup and 2 cans cream of chicken soup.  I added some steamed baby carrots.  I used Hungry Jack biscuits for the dumplings and cooked about 10 minutes instead of 7 to 8.  Will definitely cooked this again.

This is a great basic recipe that adapts to changes well.  You can pretty much use any kind of cream soup, whatever is to your liking.  I suggest reserving ALL of the broth liquid and heating up the cream soups alone.  Then pour in the reserved liquid until you get the desired thickness/consistency of how you like it. I added a little pepper and about 1/2 bag of frozen mixed veggies.  For he "dumplings" I used the standard Pillsbury Buttermilk biscuits. They didn't taste quite right the 1st day, but were much better the 2nd day!  All in all, a great recipe for a cold winter night, and so simple!!

I was very happy with this recipe. I altered it a bit by sauteeing celery, carrots, onion, and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Then, I added the chicken ( boneless breasts cut into bite-size pieces, which I had browned first) along with the soups. I used reduced sodium cream of celery and regular cream of chicken ( I could not find reduced sodium cream of chicken in my grocery store). I then thinned the mixture a bit with reduced sodium chicken broth, allowed to begin to simmer and floated Pillbury frozen biscuits on top until they were hot. It came out so yummy. We have had it several times since I discovered the recipe. Definitely try it!

Can you say E-A-S-Y?!?!?  I used 4 bone-in thighs and boiled them in a broth of (1 tsp. chicken boullion and 1 c. water) along with about 2-3 cups of water.  Also included 1/2 chopped onion, 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks (thinly sliced).  Cooked until the chicken was done.  Pulled the chicken out and removed the skin and bones, chopped it up and added it back to the soup mixture.  I then added 2 cans of the cream of celery soup.  I did a taste test and it was perfect.  I'll be serving it tonight (reheating to a boil) and then following another reviews suggestion of lightly dredging bites of the refridgerated biscuit dough in wondra and then adding to the soup - just enough to cover the top.  I know it will be fantastic.  NOTE: This is a perfect dish to prepare ahead of time for tomorrow nights supper!

This was awesome!  I used chix breast instead.  Took some others advice and used chix broth and water, added carrots, celery, onion and 2garlic cloves (later removed). Only had cr of chix or cr of mush. I used one of each, didn't add the dumplings (hubby nto very fond), so I used extra wide no yolk noodles instead.  I thought it was a little thin for chix and noodles, so I added another can of cr of mush and a can of sliced potatoes undrained (for the starch)!

This was fantastic.....whole family says I can make this again!

Alright, as the recipe is stated I would give it 4 stars, however with a few changes this recipe is DELICIOUS!! I would give it 6 stars if I could. First I used chicken breast instead of thighs. Second and I think most importantly I replaced the cream of celery soup with cream of chicken soup. I also added one can (17oz.) of peas and carrots mixture. I added 1/2 tablespoon of onion powder and it added wonderful flavor. I also used bisquick instead of refrigerated biscuit dough. With these changes it was delicious and was fairly quick to prepare, I will make this over and over again!!

I change this recipe up a bit by using chicken breast and a bit of margarine, 1 can cr. of chicken and 1 cr. of celery and homemade buttermilk biscuit dough, I've also added carrots a couple times, which adds a nice bit of color. great recipe to work with.

This is a great meal to make on a busy day.  I added bouillon cubes and garlic to the broth for flavor.  I substituted one Cream of Chicken soup and added peas.  Because we aren't big fans of "doughy" dumplings, I put it in the oven to brown the top of the biscuits.  This was very good.

Made this at my husband's request for a cold New Year's Day meal, and he loved it! My picky kids even ate some. I used a can each of cream of chicken and celery and chicken broth, and I made this is my crock pot, as per an earlier post. It came out thick and rich and hearty. The broth makes it salty, but like my husband said, to him this dish was always on the salty side and that makes it good. Thanks for the great, quick recipe!

This was my first time ever making or even taking chicken and dumplings but my mother in law made a request for me to try it since it is one of her favorites.  I tweaked the recipe a bit by using boneless skinless breasts and thighs.  I used a can of condensed cream of chicken, cream of celery, and cream of mushroom.  I boiled the chicken with two cans of chicken broth and a couple of cans of water.  I also added a couple carrots, a quartered onion, some minced garlic, and a few stalks of celery which I cooked with the chicken and left in the pot while I cut the chicken up.  I had to let the biscuit dough cook a little longer than stated, probably about 25-30 minutes.  I got huge rave reviews though and everyone loved it.  Will definitely try again.

This recipe is great! My 9yr old who claims he does'nt like chicken and dumplings asked for seconds! I used chicken broth to boil my chicken, and 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery. I had to cook my biscuits (pillsbury in red can) about 8 min longer than recipe states for them to be done all the way. This will now become a family staple!

Wow, I can't believe it.  I just heard my 12 year old say "Thanks Mom- this is delicious!" Coming from my picky eater- this was wonderful to hear.
I did add potato, onion, celery and carrots- and I used bisquick because of the comments I read on here- but this dish is so good!
Next time I will add low sodium broth instead of the regualr because it is a bit salty.  Other than that- this is a winner!

I used the really cheap kind of packaged biscuts, the ones that come 10 in a can. Before dropping them in the pot I coat them in flour with seasonings so they don't stick together and it also gives them a nice texture.

very good.  I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and used a whole rotisserie chicken picked off of the bone instead of boiling my own to save even more time.  Then added that to 3 cups of store bought broth, added a can of baby carrots, a can of sliced potatoes, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, salt & pepper.  Then I tore apart a can of biscuits and cooked in a pan on the stove for 10minutes with top on and 10 minutes with top off.  Yummy, delicious - my whole family loved it!

Tasted good. Was quick and easy. I used leftover chicken with chicken broth and 1 can cream of chicken with 1 can cream of celery. I also tossed in carrots, celery and canned peas (drained). Only 1 daycare kid wouldn't eat it the rest of the kids loved it. Thanks

Fast, good and easy. Add carrots or something else to liven it up. Also, don't use dough with butter flakes.

Very easy and yummy.  I also added a can of mixed peas and carrots and added a few slices of onion to the chicken boil.  Also, if you cut the dough too big they do tend to taste a little doughy.  Cut them smallish.

I thought this was very easy, I used a whole 3.5lb chicken, boiled in water with crushed bouillion cubes, 3 bay leaves, salt and pepper.  I left 4 cups of stock from the pot instead of 3.  It turned out pretty good.  I thought it needed a little something extra, so I added some canned peas and carrots.  Simple taste, easy to make, will try again.  Thanks

Easy and delicious!  I use less meat and add peas and carrots.  I made the mistake of using white meat (instead of dark meat as in the recipe) and I thought it was too tough.  This is a great way to use the leftover chicken.

Great recipe. I use 3 (boned) chicken breast instead of thighs and a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken. To make sure the dumplings were cooked, I placed biscuits in (souped) broth and cooked for 7-8 minutes before adding chicken pieces and frozen peas/carrots. Cooked for additional 8-10 minutes. It turned out great.

I have been looking for a delicious and easy to prepare chicken and dumplings recipe and this one fits the bill!  As suggested by others I boiled the chicken in broth and added some carrots, celery, onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I used cream of chicken with herbs soup and added some basil for flavor and some Tony Chachere's to spice it up a bit.  I cut my canned biscuits into fourths and sprinkled a little bit of the cajun seasoning on them before putting them in the soup.  My husband raved about this and even my picky kids seemed to enjoy this.

This was a great base recipe!  I added fresh onions, carrots and celery while the chicken was cooking.  I also (as a lot of users suggested) replaced some of the water with chicken broth. I used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken. This is definitely a recipe that won't be made the same twice!  You can really get creative and add what every you want (i.e. veggies, spices, cream soups) and it will still turn out great. Also very easy to make.

Classic recipe.  I'm pretty new to cooking in general (my girlfriend can't cook), so I gave this a shot.  Never cooked chicken in my life (I'm 33).  I think I left a little too much water in the pot, so I would recommend following the recipe to the tee.  I used one can of creamed celery and one can of creamed chicken, one cude of chicken buillion, diced onions and chopped celery.  I also tore the dumpling dough into tiny little pieces but they balloon during cooking.  I would recommend cooking these as long as possible and tasting to ensure they're done.  Even after tearing them into tiny little balls, they were still too big.  I used a LOT of salt and pepper.  Soup came out great...YUUUMMM!  My girlfriend (who has never had chicken & dumpling soup) licked the bowl clean :)

This recipe is so easy and tastes so good!  I did make some changes such as using cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery.  I also did what many people suggested which is to put the dumplings in before the chicken goes back in and let them boil for about 8 minutes and then I added the rest of the ingredients.  My husband and I really enjoyed this meal and my mom loved the leftovers, she and I both agree that we have always loved homemade chicken and dumplings, but neither of us could ever make them, now we can!  Thanks for the recipe!

I started using this recipie a more than a year ago, and never reviewed it.  Its a great easy way to make a Chicken and Dumplings base and then add whatever your favorite additions are.

I like to add some sliced carrots, peas, celery or other choice vegetables to it as well.   If you do plan on adding vegetables, make sure you add them earlie enough before finishing so they can cook.  (You could also cook them separately but then their flavor wouldn't be in the rest of the 'soup' as stronly.)

Again, Great Recipe, Thanks.

This was great. I used the chicken broth instead of water idea and the celery soup/cream of chicken soup idea. I also made bisquick dumplings. Had some great broth left over for other things. I will make this agian in a heart beat.

I rate this four stars to average my husband and my opinion. My husband says 5, I say 3. It was easy to make. I added minced garlic, and a couple pinches of sage and poultry seasoning, one can cream of celery, and one can cream of chicken soup. It tasted to me, like glorified canned cream of chicken soup. I am used to how my mother made it, from scratch and I guess I had that taste on my mind and this recipe didn't jive with it.

Simple!,Simple!,Simple!  I loved this recipe, the easiest and fastest dinner I ever made, and very delicious.  I did follow other suggestions like using the half cup of white wine and using chicken broth to boil chicken in, and since I don't like cream of celery, I used cream of chicken and mushroom.  Absolutley faboulous!

Fantastic!  I used more chicken than called for to stretch the recipe, and next time I will double the recipe so we have a lot of leftovers.  Who knew chicken and dumplings could be so easy?

perfect.....inexpensive, easy to prepare, and the kids love it.  I too used one can cream of chicken plus one can cream of celery.  I also threw a handful of parsley, bay leaf, 3 whole cloves, one celery stalk with leaf, an onion peel, 2 crushed cloves garlic, 1 carrot, salt/pepper into chicken cooking water to make a more flavorful broth.  I let chicken cool in broth, strained, returned to heat and reduced to three cups liquid while I was busy tearing the chicken into bite size bits.  I think this added flavor overall.  This recipe is a big keeper for winter nights.  Thank you!

YUM!  I added a 29oz can of homestyle chunky cut VegAll, a can of peas w/ onions, and  a whole chopped onion.   And based on other reviews, I cooked the chicken (3 breasts) in half broth.  This was wonderful, a definite keeper!

Amazingly simple and tastey!  I added a can of chicken broth to the mix, as suggested. I also used one can of cream of chicken, and one can of cream of celery.  It took a wee bit longer for my biscuit dough to cook through, but this may be because my pieces were slightly larger.  I would suggest checking your dumplings periodically before stopping the cooking process, to ensure doneness.

This was excellent and really easy.  I did use chicken broth with the water as suggested by previous posters.  I also cooked the chicken longer than recommended.  The dumplings also need additional cooking time, otherwise they will be doughy.  Great recipe, thanks.

This is very good though I did doctor it a little. I used whole chicken cut up and 3 cups water and three cups broth. I added garlic and a little Sherry to the broth before cooking. Subbed one can crm of chicken and one can crm of mushroom. Used 1/2 of broth mixture and cooked chicken and I then freeze the other 1/2 so I have a shortcut next time. Have now made this several times and this method works well

Good and very simple to make.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the chicken in 1 can  low-salt chicken broth, topped off with water.  Then used 1 can cr. of celery and 1 can cr. of mushroom soups.  I cut out the additional salt altogether since there is plenty in the soup and nearly doubled the cooking time after putting the dough in to make sure it was cooked through.  Be sure the dough is in small pieces since it is so chewy.

This was an easy recipe; however, I found that it was too salty for our liking. I did use chicken broth in lieu of the water; this could've contributed to the saltiness. I don't think that I'll give it another try though.

This was delicious!  Living near Lancaster County, I am very critical of recipes that remind me of the PA Dutch.  I added some chopped carrots and a can of cream of mushroom soup and used bisquick for the dumplings.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish and it was simple to make.

I was looking for an old fashioned style recipe for this dish when I found this one.  I had all of the 4 ingredients on hand so I gave it a try.  I used the cream of mushroom and chicken soups as many others before me had suggested and the combination was amazing.  It was just what I remembered chicken and dumplings tasting like.  My 4 and 7 year old even loved it. I added fresh onion and one chicken breast which is preferred in our family.  It turned out great.  If you are looking for a great recipe for chicken and dumplings, forget all those complicated ones.  This one is simple yet totally satisfying. It will be made in our home from now on.

My brother loves chicken and dumplings and I was wary when he asked me to make it.  I found this recipe to be easy and taste very good, and have made it several times.  I followed some of the previous reviewers suggestions and used cream of chicken and mushroom instead of celery and added some frozen mixed vegetables.  I would also suggest tearing the biscuits in very small pieces instead of rolling them into balls.

This was great and so easy!! I have never made Chicken and Dumplings before now.. I had it once as a teenager when my best friends mom spent an entire day making it for us.. and as far as I can remember this was just as good if not better.

I used chicken breast halves on the bone.. boiled them in the water with a generous amount of garlic salt, salt, pepper, two chicken bouillon cubes, and an onion. Strained the broth, deboned the chicken and placed it back in the broth. I used less chicken so I used a little less broth,(Don't throw away leftover broth freeze it for a future recipe.) used only one can of cream of celery soup and 3/4 the amount of dumpling. It turned out great!! 5 stars!!

This was very delicious!!  I had some left over chicken breasts and veggies that I had roasted.  Nobody wanted to eat them, so I decided to try to make soup out of the chicken.  They ate it all up and asked for more!  This is most definitely a "make it again" recipe!  I did change it a little…  I didn't have cream of celery soup, so I used cream of chicken soup.  I wanted to add a little veggies, so I dumped a small amount of frozen peas and carrots into the soup.  

Thanks for the great recipe!  =)

A great recipe!  It was so quick to put together and the refrigerated  bisquits was such a great time saver.  The only thing I substituted was cream of chicken soup since none of my family cares for the taste of celery soup.  Thanks for such and quick and easy recipe for a cold day.

This recipe made my first attempt at chicken and dumplings less daunting. I used 2 cans of chicken broth simmered the chicken until shreddable and then added carrots, celery, and a clove of garlic. I stuck with the cream of celery but included about a 1/8 tsp of thyme which really makes it extra savory. Tearing the store bought biscuits couldn't be easier and it was a huge success! Will make this again and again! Thank you!

I hate to be one of those people who rate a recipe and in actuality did not stick to the recipe- sorry. I ALWAYS read the reviews, and so based on those, used chicken breast boiled in chicken broth, along with some minced onion. As I doubled the recipe, I used three can of soup- two cream of chicken, one cream of celery, and one can of chicken gravy. I also added a small package of frozen mixed vegetables, and a can ( drained) of potatoes- which I chopped. It was fast and easy and tasty.

Great.  Added some peas, a pinch of cayenne and black pepper, plus a shake of italian seasoning.  Oh, and a pat of butter and about a tablespoon of cream cheese to make the broth more creamy and rich.  This is comfort food at its finest!

Thanks for a great recipe Melissa!  I sautéed onion in a garlic olive oil and added it to the 1.5 lbs of chicken breast boiling in 2 cups water, 2 cans broth then added the soups.  I seasoned with cracked pepper and a tsp of terragon.  I didn't have biscuits so looked up a dumpling recipe on this site. Simmered the dumplings in the soup for 20 minutes. This was a great dinner for a cold evening!  Will definitely make again.

My husband and I really loved this! I made a number of revisions; I used a pound of chicken breast (could have used more) because there were no chicken thighs at my grocery store when I went, I used one can of cream of celery, one can of cream of chicken, and added 6oz of frozen veggies to the pot before I added the biscuit dough. I used the Pillsberry homestyle refrigerated biscuits and it turned out great! Next time I will keep more water in the pot after the chicken has cooked so the sauce will be less thick. Great dinner!

Hands down easiest chicken and dumplings recipe I've ever done. It's also very tasty! It is now my husbands favorite dish I make. He asks for it multiple times through out the cold and even summer months. It is also a quick recipe.

Wow, it's been a loooong time since I've found a 5-star recipe.  Usually, the first time I make a recipe, I make it exactly as written but this time I immediately identified ways to make the dish even more convenient to prepare - here are my changes: Brown 750g chicken (I used thighs) in large saucepan for a few minutes, add carrots, celery, and onion for a few more.  Remove some of the fat if necessary, then add soup, broth, and milk, 1/2 tsp celery seed and pepper.  Simmer for 35 min. Add dumpling batter and simmer for 12 more. 
This is definitely a 5-star one-dish meal!

I'm going to make this today. I have used the dumpling biscuit method before and will again. But, I have never used the cans of soup. I will this time. I will as well as everyone else tweak this. Just a little. I will update this after we're finished with it. So excited.

I've made this recipe with my granddaughter and she loved making it.  It was so easy. The only thing we changed was substituting 1 can of cream of celery soup with 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Everyone loved it & I've gotten a lot of requests for this recipe.

Really liked this!  Easy to make but very tasty.   My few tweaks were,  2 large breasts, just enough water to cover them, 1 tsp chicken broth powder, can of chicken condensed soup,  4 pieces garlic shredded,  1/8 onion,  2 mushrooms,  2 carrots and 3 celery sticks cut up.

I used a rotisserie chicken, added ~2c. of chicken broth (plus some water) to cover the chicken, adding some more broth at the end to ensure the biscuits would cook.  I also substituted one of the two cans with cream of chicken, and added some onion, carrots, celery and garlic.  I did tear off small pieces of the biscuits.

This dish went over well with the family.  I used 1 can celery coup and 1 can of cream chicken soup.  Also used chicken broth to cook chicken in.  I threw in a handful of frozen peas, some chopped onion and a little chopped celery.

This recipe is great and flexible, you can add in any kind of veggies that you want, and it'll still turn out perfect. The only thing I changed is instead of using cream of celery, I used cream of chicken, and put actual pieces of celery in. I just don't really like the taste of cream of celery soup.

So good!! To be fair I did use suggestions from other reviews.  I seasoned  the chicken with a little poultry seasoning, salt and pepper then browned in a little oil and butter with an onion before adding 2 cups of chicken broth.  After the chicken was cooked I pulled it apart and added it back to the broth with 1 can each cream of celery, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  I seasoned a bit of parsley and a bay leaf and let it all simmer for about 15 more minutes before adding the biscuits.  Very tasty!!

Like other reviewers, I would suggest some modifications. I boiled boneless chicken tenderloins in water w/broth. Then I sauteed onion/garlic in oil and white wine. Add 1 cup of broth and spices (oregano, parsley, salt, pepper) and let simmer. Threw bite sized pieces of chicken, baby carrots & frozen peas into soup and added 3 cans of cream of chicken/celery/mushroom soup. Let simmer while I made my own Bisquick batter biscuits instead of premade. Great flavor & really comfort food :)

We loved this recipe. I added carrots and peas, ( my family hates peas) but other than that the recipe stood. The only thing i would do differently is to divide the stew... so that i could put it in 2 pots and have twice as many dumplings!!!! I did cut every biscuit into about 8 peices.

I used pulled chicken breast that had cooked in the crock-pot for several hours.  Since it also had some rib meat to help flavor it, I just used water to cook it, then added fresh thyme and rosemary for flavoring.  As many others did, I added fresh veggies (carrots, peas, onions, garlic, & corn) to the sauce.  I only had cream of chicken soup but that worked wonderfully.  Instead of refrigerator biscuits, I just made a batch of biscuit dough with Bisquick and dropped it on top in little pieces.  Cook 10 minutes with lid on, then 10 with lid off and VOILA! an easy-peasy, fairly nutritious dinner!

Simple to prepare, this was a hit with my family. I tweaked the recipe a little; I used a little cayenne pepper to give little kick. It turn out great, I will add this to my winter time meals.

Made this today and took it to a church potluck tonight.  Got rave reviews from the oldest couple (60s?) to the youngest (8).  I did not drain any of my water, but kept adding condensed soup until my consistency was good.  It was very soupy, but that was okay!  Also added sauteed onion and celery.  Flavor was OUT OF SIGHT!!!!  Church potluck dinners are definitely a good test and this recipe passed with flying colors!  Thanks, Melissa!

These are delicious! I am not a fan of canned soups but this tastes like it was made from scratch. It is quick and easy to keep the ingredients on hand to throw together for a new neighbor, sick friend, new mom, etc. Each time I am asked for this recipe and jaws drop when I give it to them. Thank you, Melissa, for sharing this recipe and making it so easy for me to provide comfort food to friends on a whim.

Hubby & kids LOVED IT!!! I had never made or even tasted Chicken & Dumplings before this meal & I will say this is a definite keeper!! I did add mixed veggies & instead of 2 cream of celery I did 1 cream of celery & 1 cream of chicken. It was absolutely perfect for a beginner like myself! Thanks!

I made this last night.  It was delicious.  It is salty, I will use the Cream of Celery low sodium next time.  But I am a beginning cook and my husband loved it.  It was very easy to make.  The dough was hard to find so I used Pillsbury biscuits, but needed to add 10 minute more time to cook dough thoroughly.

Very good simple recipe. I changed chicken thigh to 3 chicken breast because we like white chicken meat. Also, used cream of chicken soup like others. Very good recipe. We wolfed it down.

Thank you so much for this great recipe! It's very versatile. Just like my Mom used to make:)
I used Bisquick for the dumplings and 1 can cream of asparagus and 1 can cream of chicken (cuz that's what I had on hand). I'll definitely be making this meal many times over.

this was very good and easy to do.  My husband stirred the pot while I added the biscuits then we covered.  We thought 2 cans would be too much but it cooked down well and was just right.  Much easier than making homemade biscuits and taste just as good.  I did Sautee' onion, garlic, celery, and carrots before adding soup and i used chicken broth also with basil leaves.  Was Awsome!!!  Thanks

This was my first time making chicken and dumplings, and it worked out well (al hamdulillah).  The recipe is versatile, and a more experienced cook will find it easy to make personalized adjustments. The kids ate it, so it gets a five.

I thought this was very good. I added a few chopped potatoes, carrots, celery and onion and a few herbs. I used cream of mushroom and chicken since that was I had on hand. I wil try the cream of celery next time and see which I prefer. I did use the Grands Biscuits and had really good results. I didnt flatten then. I just cut them into square and dropped them into the pot. TAfter about 4 minutes they puffed up really big and were so good. Everyone kept grabbing them as I was pulling them out of the pot. The hubby insists this go into our rotation.

I had only ever eaten Sweet Sue's canned dumplings before this. For some reason, I thought chicken and dumplings would be hard to prepare. Wrong! This was so quick and easy. I used cream of chicken instead of celery because no one here likes that. Otherwise made just as directed.

Excellent and so easy. I added some poultry seasoning and some thyme and a scoop of butter as well as a 1/2 can of chicken broth. We had a friend over who hadn't had chicken and dumplings and he thought it was great.

Not his momma's dumplings is all he said to me, but at least he at three bowls... I did not have 2 cans of cream of celery so I put one can of cream of celery and another of cream of potato. It turned out good in my opinion, and I guess we all just can't beat momma's cooking.

My 5 yr old made this dinner with my supervision.  He is so proud of it and ate it all, that he wants it every week now.  I precut 2 or 3 chicken breast into cubes (depends on how many I am feeding). Then when I drained most of the water, I just left the chicken in the pot, added one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of potato soup (will add a third can of cream of chicken if I am feeding more mouths).  I don't add salt and pepper because the condensed soups are loaded with sodium.  I added a small bag of peas and carrots at the same time as the soups.  You can add them frozen or precooked.  I used Bisquick to do the dumplings (follow recipe on box) allowing for 20 minutes for the dumplings to cook.

I substituted the canned soups with a recipe from this site called Home-Made Cream of Chicken Soup.  I sort of combined the two recipes and it turned out fantastic.  My husband, who is leery of my cooking, thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The family did not care for this recipe very much. I did follow it to the tee. Maybe with a few adjustments it would be better. Thank you for the recipe.

Fantabulous!  I have never tried biscuits for dumplings before, as I've always used bisquick. This was much better!  I boiled the chicken in broth instead of water, and used cream of chicken soup.  I also added carrots and peas.  I would recommend using low sodium broth as it came out pretty salty with the broth and soup together.  Got lots of compliments.

The biscuit dough tasted very processed, and left a bad after taste. Might have turned out better, if the dumplings had been made from scratch!

This surprisingly turned out really well! I'm crashing at a couple guy friends house and decided to make dinner for them - I chose this recipe because I'd have to purchase very little (bachelors have no cooking supplies on hand!). Though I'd eaten it as a child, I'd never made chicken and dumplings before.  I cooked the chicken in half water/half broth and added onions, garlic, and carrots. No salt, pepper, or other spices. I mostly just followed the directions.  It was delicious! One guy who previously had and disliked chicken and dumplings even got seconds! I was kind of proud of myself. :)

Excellent, very flavorful recipe.  I added onions to the broth mixture along with some chicken bouillon and a touch of garlic powder for flavoring.  Would make this again and again.

I modified this recipe. instead of cream of celery, I added two cans of cream of chicken and a can of cream of Mushroom ( a big pot). I used chicken hind quarters with bone (to add natural flavor to the broth, then shredded the chicken. I also added 2-3 cans of chicken broth mixed with some water to boil my chicken in. Tossed in some potatoes, carrots, and peas and egg noodles, then added my dumplings at the end....boy it ws good and thick!

I love this meal, it is soo easy you just can't mess it up. It tastes wonderful and has lots of flavor. It's amazing to me that it's only 5 ingredients! I ususally serve it with peas on the side for the kids, in the bowl for my and my hubby.

Did saute carrots, celery, and onion then added the thighs which I doubled.  Cooked a good 45 minutes then added soup and pea.  Brought to boil and added biscuit dough.  Cooked another 15 minutes to get dumplings done

So easy!  I used chicken breast and minced garlic, boiled in 1 can chicken broth and one can water. I removed the chicken and cubed it, then returned it to the broth. I added 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, half can of milk, parsley flakes and McCormick's Montreal Chicken seasoning. I used a small can of Grands biscuits, rolled flat and cut into pieces. Mixed it all together- cooked about 9 minutes on medium heat. Family loved it!

GREAT recipe, so easy, so good.  I used 8 chicken thighs with skin removed, added some sliced carrots and celery to the chicken while it was simmering and used two cans of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery called for in the original recipe.  My family loved it!!!  This will definitely make it into our regular recipe lineup.  A WINNER!

This was really good! The only thing I did different was use chicken breast instead of thighs and added 3 table spoons of butter. I made it during the day and just put it in the crock pot on low until I was ready to serve it. It turned out perfect!

I didn't really follow the recipe given.  I took everyone else's suggestions.  My husband said that the meal was restaurant quality, and he knows his southern foods!  My changes were as follows: 2 cans chicken broth, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, package of 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1/8 of an onion, minced, 1 Tblsp. butter, 1.5 cans Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits.  Combine soups in a crock pot and turn on high heat.  Melt the butter in a frying pan and sautee the onions.  Add chicken to onions and butter.  Cook all the way through.  Cut chicken in small pieces and add to crock pot.  Start pinching off and flouring thumb-sized pieces of biscuits.  The flour keeps them from sticking together and also thickens the broth.  Add big can of biscuits first.  Wait 20 minutes, then flour and add the can of five biscuits, making sure the dough is small.  As the dumplings cook, they will plump.  Too big of pieces leads to a doughy, uncooked center.  Let cook on high for about an hour to an hour and a half.  Turn on low for another 15 minutes, then serve!  I did not add peas and carrots to mine.  That is optional.

Meh- this was okay but didn't impress anyone. It filled our stomachs but I wouldn't make it again without a lot of additions. We thought it needed a lot more flavor. Thanks anyway, it is a good base to start with.

Delish! Simple. I'm giving it a 5! Seems so many people made modifications, I just took several ideas from the top 4 reviews. Boil chicken in broth...do not drain...cut and set aside. Used only cream of chicken soup and doubled amount since I added plenty of fresh organic carrots, onions and celery. Also added 1/2 cup of white wine. Add spices you like such as salt, pepper and garlic powder and a dab of butter. Cook your veggies 45 min then throw in chicken the last 10 minutes when you're doing your buscuits. prevents chicken from drying out. This is so good I'm half tempted to eat another bowl. Yum yum...this is a keep and I'm thrilled to have found it! Thank you so much for submitting this.

I thought this recipe was a great starter, but really boring as is. Excellent idea with the biscuit dough! Came out amazing! I used one can of cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom, wound up adding lots of veggies and some extra spices to this to pump up the flavor and make it more interesting.

This recipe was a hit. My 5 yr. old daughter Loves chicken and dumplings from resturants. I took a chance with this recipe and it went over so well she wanted the left overs the next day. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and first cooked the chicken in chicken broth, then used 2 cans of cream of chiken soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup. I will effently make this again. THANKS so much for a great recipe.

This was a great, quick dinner. I scaled it down and used 2 chicken breasts and 1 can cream of celery. I added green pepper and onion. I cooked the breasts in chicken stock. I also added some cornstarch and flour to thicken the sauce. Thanks for this recipe, I will definetly be making it again!

Biscuits did not make it.....so I ended up with a thick chicken soup of sorts.  Still delicious in taste.  Added the Bisquick recipe and it's perfect.  Not bad for my first time.  Great cold weather meal.

This was absolutely great! I added parsley, thyme and parmesean to the dumplings (store bought biscuits and cut each one in half and pinched) before dropping them in the soup.  I also added garlic, green peppers, onion powder, parsley and a bay leaf to chicken broth and boiled my chicken thighs in it. Two thumbs up!

Great and easy recipe!!   Of course I made some changes to please my husband. My husband likes big pieces of meat and not shredded or chopped.  So I cooked several small to medium whole chicken thighs on the bone in about 3 to 4 cups of water and one box of chicken broth.  Then added one bag of frozen peas and one bag of frozen carrots.  Also added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup.  I made the dumplings with bisquick baking mix and dropped by teaspoon full into boiling soup.   My husband LOVED it!!  Very exciting!

Because I like to use my george foreman grill to cook chicken, I substituted chicken broth for water and added the cooked, chopped chicken to the mix. Perhaps this step saved some time. As other reviewers did, I followed the "Dumpling" recipe available on allrecipes and made my own instead of going store bought. This was a fabulous decision as the meal was cozy, delicious, and an instant favorite.

This was ok.  I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs and cooked them in low sodium chicken stock and enough water to cover them.  I added salt, bay leaf, garlic sea salt, pepper to that.  Maybe needs more pepper.  I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery.  Added frozen peas & carrots just before dropping the dumplings in.    Definitely will make again.

This is so easy and delicious.  I sauteed some onion, carrots and celery and added that.  I cooked the chicken in low sodium chicken broth.  I also ladeled out some of the broth and added a tablespoon of flour to make a roux, it thickened the broth just a little.  I also added some veggies I had in the fridge, green beans, peas.  Everyone really liked it.

OK - this could almost be homemade!!  I used three cans of soup (two cream of celery, one cream of chicken) and used Mary B's frozen dumplings.  I also added a pinch or two of sage.

A great recipe, thanks!!

I really like this chicken and dumplings recipe but with some additions. I did the the cream of chicken & cream of celery per reviews. Also...you HAVE TO add onion, celery and carrots. This soup is not the same without the veggies!!!!
Good base, with additions very good.
Thanks

After adding some personal touches and feeding this to my brother, he demanded to know how to make it! Definately, a nice comfort food on those cold fall/winter days. *note* this would even be good without the dumplings and just add some rice for some chicken and rice soup!

This is excellent.  My changes--I use 2 skinless bone-in brests and three thighs.  Place them in water plus two cubes chicken bullion, plus mirepoix, garlic, parsley and a little dill.  I strain out the veggies and herbs and remove the bones after simmering for 30 min-1 hr. I skim off the foam as it comes to a boil.  Since I use 16 oz of Grands, I reserve 3 3/4 to 4 cups of stock and add a little thyme, salt, and pepper.  Excellent.

I have been making this for ages. Plain and simple chicken and dumplings with no fillers. The only change is that i do add a couple of tsps of chicken bouillon to the broth and a tsp thyme. After the soup is added and i only use cream of celery, i add about a cup of heavy cream which gives it the richness that a creamy soup should have. This is the best chicken and dumpling recipe!

Modified the recipe a bit since I was nervous to have the base be all condensed soup.  I was thinking it might come out a bit too thick and bland.  I followed a lot of the other reviewers and boiled my chicken in 6 cups chicken broth (dont bother with low sodium because I added quite of bit of salt at the end) and 2 cups water.  Chopped up about 4 stalks of celery (medium to fine) along with the leaves, 3 carrots coursely chopped and 1/2 of a white onion finely chopped and added to the chicken and broth.  Added a bunch of seasonings also: rosemary, thyme, sage, bay leaf, pepper, seasoned salt, sea salt and garlic powder.  Cook covered so the broth wouldnt reduce too much.  After cutting up the cooked chicken I added the soups (1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery).  Used the refrigerator biscuits and pulled apart into tiny pieces (dime to nickel sized) and cooked 8 min uncovered and 15 min covered.  Came out very tasty and the dumplings had the consistency in between fluffy and "slicks".  Nice change, but not really all that much easier with the chopping of the veggies and cutting/pulling apart of the refrigerator biscuits.  Only regret is that I had too much broth.  Would have liked it a little thicker.  Next time I will only use 4 cups of broth and a touch of Wondra flour if needed.

I've made this easy recipe 3 times in the last month.  It is easy to substitute ingredients. Any creamed soup will work, and you can make Bisquick dumplings instead of using canned biscuits.

Loved the taste of this recipe.  It ended up being a little more watery than I think it was supposed to be.  I would say that I ended up making chicken and dumpling soup.  It was very tasty and would probably use a different biscuit to drop in.  I only had crescent rolls.  My fiance and I have never had chicken and dumplings so we weren't sure of the  consistency was right or not.  But the taste was definitely very good.  Definitely making this again!

I made this as part of a soup bar for an event and had several people ask for the recipe. It is a winner. I did modify it a bit- I used chicken breast meat,one can each of Cream of Chicken, Cream of Mushroom, and Cream of Celery. I also add in a can of broth and some water to thin it out. Added in celery, carrots, and onion. (All chopped and cooked beforehand.) I also like to add some seasonings- garlic and/or garlic salt, parsley, and dill. 
So easy with the canned biscuits and soups!

Really really good, and easy.  I cooked the chicken in one cup of broth (that's all I had!) and two cups water, with celery and potatoes.  I added onion flakes and some garlic to the water, and a bit of pepper.  I used cream of chicken and cream of celery, and added some lima beans to the mix when I put the chicken back in, just to try to get some more veggies in there.  It was delish!!

I made my own basic chicken soup using this as a guide and was so surprised how EASY this was!  I couldn't stop eating it because it is such a home-made comfort food.  I found if I boiled the chicken on really low for a longer time it turned out really tender and juicy, then I used that chicken broth for the soup base.  The Pillsbury Southern Biscuit was so easy and worked perfect.  As much as I love to bake and cook, it doesn't make sense to make my own dough when this works and is so incredibly delicious.  You gotta try it!

Easy recipe and the kids loved it! This chicken and dumplings reminds me of the way my Mom prepared it for us when I was a child. She just used the canned cream of chicken soup though. I like it better with the chicken added. This is definately a keeper in the recipe box.

Really good and really easy.  I added fresh carrots, celery and onions (chopped them up and micorwaved them for about 5 min, then added them to the mixture.)   
Two days later I put the added peas to the leftovers and put them into a ready made pie crust and had a delcious chicken pot pie!

For years I made the easy bisquick version but this is easier and wayyyy better! We dont like cream of celery so I subbed 2 cans of cream of chicken instead and hubby and kids loved it! Not a drop left over!

I'm rating this recipe because of the cream of celery soup.  I've made my chicken and dumplings from scratch for many years (this year I used frozen dumplings...I'm getting lazy.) Adding the cream of celery soup put my dish over the top.  Thanks!!!

This stuff is AWESOME and very easy to make!  A very filling meal on a cold winter's night!  Hardly any leftover. Only messy part is pulling the skin off the chicken and the chicken off of the bone, so if you're not used to that, be prepared - but that's what soap and water's for, right??  Cook it first, as the recipe states.  Also, I used Bisquick for dumplings since we didn't have refrig. biscuits (just follow their directions on the box for preparing dumplings), and used one can crm of chicken soup and one can crm of celery because we didn't have two cans crm of celery. Definitely a keeper!!

Really good!  Changed this recipe a bit...used leftover Thanksgiving turkey meat, mostly dark, so instead of boiling the chicken in water for broth, I used three cups of chicken broth .  One was actually made with chicken bouillon!  Then added a can of cream of chicken soup and one of cream of chicken with herbs soup.  Used Pillsbury Grands biscuits, but didn't use all of them (all but 3) since they are bigger than most.  SO EASY!  I will definitely make this again!

This was a great fix on a cold night! Comfort food  at it's best....quick, easy, and very affordable....the only concern i had was the amount of salt that was added due to the soup...will use reduced sodium next time.

Very easy and customizable recipe.  I've been making this for a couple of years, and this recipe works great when you're on a tight budget, or if you have a large amount of company over for dinner.  We like to pop in some frozen veggies right after returning the stock and chicken to the pot, before the cream of soups go in.  Also, this recipe works great for any cream soups you may have on hand.  Very tasty and filling...warms you to the bone!

This is a very tasty dish and perfect recipe for this time of year! I did have to use 1 can of cream of celery and 2 cans of cream of chicken (both reduced fat) because I didn't take out enough stock and didn't want it watery!  I also added celery, onions, carrots AND lots of seasoning which added a lot of bulk to the soup and made it hearty!  I would reccomend using VERY small drops for the dumplings.  I tore my biscuits in 1/4's and it was still a bit doughy after simmering for 30 minutes!!!  yUMMY :-)

I have finally found a way of making chicken and dumplings that my husband likes and is easy. The only thing that I did differently was I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I really wanted to give this a 5 and I would if it included these changes: 2 carrots, chopped; 2 stalks celery, chopped;  teaspoon whole peppercorn; 1 bay leaf. I also used 2 large chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs becuase that's all I had. Also, I only used 1 can cream of celery soup b/c that's all I had. I have never had chicken and dumplings, but this is awesome! I will definitely make again and again, esp when I have some left over chicken. Definitely a keeper!

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  As with pretty much everyone else, I modified by adding some vegetables and seasoning and making the dumplings with bisquick, but this is such a great basic recipe.  I tell everyone about this recipe and they always come back to me and say how fantastic it was.  This recipe is so easy that even I couldn't mess it up!

The Original Recipe given was a great Base recipe. As I do with most recipes I like to tweak them to my liking. First of I sauteed 1 small onion 2 cloves of garlic, a small carrot and 1 rib of celery chopped in a bit of olive oil. Once Softened I put in the 6 thighs with a 900 mL container of Campbells ready to use Chicken Stock in place of the water. I also added about 1 tsp of thyme. I let it simmer the time directed and then followed the rest of the recipe to a T. However I did not get rid of any of the simmering liquid I saved it all which was 4 cups and used that.
My family loved it. My youngest daughter said, "Why can't we have this for breakfast". I honestly can't say I haven't had reviews from my kids over most recipes I make. But this was a sure fire hit with the three kids and my husband!

After cooking the chicken, and removing skin/bones, I measured back (strained), 4 cups of broth, added 1 can mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, one (lrg) chicken bouillon cube, 2 stalks celery (chopped), & 2 carrots (chopped), some garlic powder, salt & pepper, and the chicken back in the pot, oh, 1 sm can of mushroom (stems & pieces), & cooked until veggies were al dente; then did the dumplings, covered & simmered for about 15 minutes. Delicious. My hubby likes to put a dash of hot sauce on his, but, I prefer 'traditional' for this dish!!!

Absolute comfort in a bowl. This is the exact recipe I grew up on, and this is the one my kids will grow up on.  The only thing I changed was instead of adding salt and pepper, I threw in a chicken bouillion cube.  Out of this world recipe.

I made this tonight using boneless, skinless chicken thighs, a waxed carton of chicken broth, carrots, celery, onion and a can of cream of mushroom soup (as that's all I had).

I cut the chicken thighs into just larger than bite sized pieces and let them simmer in the broth with the veggies.  Then I mixed in the mushroom soup, then cut the biscuits in half, pepper and garlic (the kind in the jar) for taste and let it simmer for close to 40 minutes because the biscuits weren't cooked at 30 minutes ... probably because they werelarge pieces (half a biscuit).

OMG ... this was totally YUM!

Loved it! I made just a couple additions. I used chicken breasts and I boiled my chicken in the water suggested, but then instead of saving the broth, I used a can of broth.  That made sure no extra fat come off in the final dish. I also cut the biscuits with scissors into fourths and balled them up.  I sprinkled them with a mix of one chicken bullion cube, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 tsp onion salt for added flavor. I used 1 cream of celery and one cream of mushroom since that's what I had! I also, added chopped celery and a few left over canned mushrooms.  Very tasty!

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I made it right after Thanksgiving and my family loved it. It made for a few lunches too! I modified it by using bisquick instead of the rolls. I also chopped the chicken in a small chopper, which made the stew creamier. I am going to make this again this week and try stir fry chicken (for ease) and add in chopped vegetables!

Instead of chicken breast, I took a whole rotissere chicken from the supermarket and stripped the meat for the stew.  Meat was very tender and the flavor was great.  The dumplings on the other hand were not so great.  Next time I may make the dumplings as another user suggested instead of the pre-packaged biscuit tube.

I saved all of the broth and water that I cooked the chicken in, just in case. I ended up using that to cook the dumplings. I tried making dumplings that looked about like dimes (small and flat), but they wouldn't cook. Then, I made them about like marbles and put them in a pot with the broth and water at a rolling boil. They would sit at the bottom of the pot and after a minute or so they would pop to the top. I let them cook there for a minute and put them in the pot with my soup. Because the broth was somewhat greasy, the dumplings did not stick together. I used regular (Wal-Mart brand) refrigerated biscuit dough from a can. Next time I'll use Pillsbury because these biscuits looked & felt like they had little clumps of shortening or something in them. These turned out fine though.

My husband loves chicken and dumplings and this looked like a nice easy way to make them for him.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery because it's what I had and I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe states so the biscuits weren't doughy. I'd say 20-25 minutes after adding the biscuits with quite a bit of stirring.  He absolutely loved them!  Thanks for a nice easy recipe, I have a feeling I will be making it very often by request.

Mmmmm!  Very tasty! This is what I did to the recipe...1 can crm of celery, 1 can crm of chicken, for the 3 cups liquid...I used 2c.chkn broth(reduced sodium)& 1c.water, added 2c. froz.peas & carrots, and I used the bisquick biscuits, and last but not least...I used 4 cans of chicken. I thought I wouldn't really like the chkn from the can for this, but I was short on time and didn't have time to wait for the chicken to cook, cool, & chop! :) It actually was really good!  I'd do it again!  I've never made or let alone, eaten chkn & dumplings (or dumplin's, as my boyfriend insists it should be said, LOL!) But, I wanted to make it for my BF, who loves it and lo & behold, I realllly liked this!

This was awesome and quick dinner!! I also used bisquick and substituted the to cans of celery soup for cream of mushrooms, and it came out very creamy!! Even better the next day because the dough absorbed the soup!

This was soo yummy!  My boyfriend loves chicken and dumplings and I thought I'd surprise him by making this for dinner last night.  I didn't have any cream of celery, so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Based on some of the other reviews, I boiled the chicken thighs in 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth.  I also added baby bella mushrooms, celery, baby carrots, chopped onions, and garlic powder to the mix.  The stew was a little runny (probably from the water in the onions, mushrooms, & celery) so I added some cornstarch to my preferred consistency.  I also used bisquick mix for the dumplings rather than the refrigerated biscuit dough.  This turned out so good that my boyfriend at 3 bowls.  He was so full, yet kept eating because he thought it was extremely delicious!  Thank you so much...this is definitely a keeper!

Very good! I use chicken breast tenderloins, boiled, then shredded to bite size pieces. I also cook chicken in half water/half chicken stock.

I loved this soup... so simple and yummy. I changed a few things to suit my tastes, as I prefer some veggies in my soups. I did as some others suggested and used a precooked chicken. I sauteed some diced onion, minced fresh garlic and thinly sliced celery in some of the chicken juices, white wine, seasonings and butter. I boiled some carrots and diced them then added to the mix. As some others suggested, I used the 1 can cream of chicken 1 cream of celery and loved it! My husband raved and gobbled up the leftovers in no time.

This was a good recipe but the dumplings were like dough balls, it pretty much ruined the whole thing.  I will stick to Biscuit in a box.

I haven't had this dish since I was a little girl.  This was very easy to make and came out perfectly.  My only regret is that I used a generic cream of celery.  Don't do that!

This is wonderful!  I followed the other posters and cooked it for 8 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered so the dumplings would firm up.  Definitely a good idea.  

Also, I only used 4 chicken thighs and added one cup each of celery and onions.  

Will make again!!

My kids gobbled this up!  This was a great starting point for my version.  I used chicken breasts and I threw additional veggies and a couple cubed potatoes and let it cook slowly for a couple hours before adding the biscuits.

A great, quick meal and easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. Boiled carrot, diced onion, celery in chicken broth & water and I used leftover chicken and Bisquick dumplings.  Boyfriend loved it. Thanks for the good recipe and all the great suggestions.

Such an easy recipe!  I also added some onion, celery and peas to the sauce and let the dough (small pieces, non-buttered) cook for an extra 10 min or so.  The best thing you can add is about a tablespoon of tarragon.  Gives it a wonderful flavor - add it when you put in the dumplings!

I made this last night and it turned out great. I did add some carrots, celery and potatoes and about a tablespoon of chicken base so it was more stew like. The premade biscuit dough made this an easy mid-week meal that tasted like it had simmered for hours. Thanks!

This was pretty good for how easy it was.  The dumplings, though, just weren't very tasty.  Both of my kids asked if they had to eat them; my husband left quite a bit on his plate.  It's too bad, because this really is very easy!

This is very easy to prepare, takes almost no time at all. The outcome is pretty close to homemade chicken and dumplings. My boyfriend and his kids loved it. They thought it was the real thing. I also used 1 of cream of celery and 1 of cream of chicken. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good, I took some of the other reviewers' advice and put the dumplings in earlier so they would finish and that worked out great. I also used the Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken soup and used one can of chicken stock and the rest water to boil the chicken in and I think that gave it the right flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe. I gave it my own twist. I used chicken noodle soup smashed up and and extra can of water with a chicken broth cube. I also added baby carrot and chopped celery. A dash of garlic powder too. I turned the crock pot to simmer at the end and the quartered biscuits cooked quite nicely. I will be making this one again!!!

I finally made this last night. I'm glad I read reviews before I try a new recipe. I definitely knew to watch out for those doughy dumplings, and sure enough, I could not get them to cook. I must have cooked them for 30 minutes, and they were still doughy. I used Pillsbury Dinner Rolls. Luckily, I kept checking them, and when I knew they were gonna be horrible, I took them all out and made my regular Bisquick dumplings. I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery, added onion, potatoes, and carrots. I also added some water in the end because it was so thick. It turned out delicious!

I used a can of cream of chicken soup in my normal Chicken and Dumplings recipe and it added great flavor and texture to the broth.  I love C/D anyway, so I'm biased, but I thought it was a great addition to the soup.  Thanks!

So Great!  I used the ideas of other reviewers and came out with a great meal.  I used a can each of cream of celery and cream of chicken.  I added some fresh carrots, celery, and onion to the broth as I cooked the chicken.  I also cooked the biscuit dumplings for about 8 minutes in the liquid before adding the chicken back in.  I never had much luck with making "homemade" dumplings, but now I can cheat my way to a great meal!

This has quickly become a favorite in our household.  It's so simple and tastes like homemade!  I use 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken.  I also add a bag of frozen mixed veggies to make it a "complete" meal.  For added flavor, I throw in a pinch of poultry seasoning. Yummy!  Thank you for sharing!

I am so thrilled to have this great recipe.  The consistency is great.  I followed previous suggestions about using plain generic biscuits, and letting the biscuits cook before adding the extra ingredients.  Next time I will use 1 can crm of chkn and 1 can cream of celery.  I think that will make the perfect balance.  This is a keeper.

Yum!  Husband, 3 year old daughter and I loved this.  I boiled about a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts in 3 cans of roasted garlic chicken broth and added a bay leaf.  Cooked the biscuits for about 10 mins before adding the chicken again, used white pepper instead of black pepper, and no extra salt.  Really good!

The gravey is excellent but the refrigerated biscuit dough is weird.  We just make our own from the recipe on the baking powder container.

Very Good.  I started this recipe with boned chicken I already had in the freezer.  So, I created the broth with chicken bouillon cubes.  I only had 1 can of cream of celery so I added 1 cream of chicken to it.  At this point it was way too salty so I added another cup of water and no additional salt or pepper.  Dumplings came out great with Pillsbury's Golden Homestyle Buttermilk buscuits.  Most chicken and dumplings I have had before have a thin clear broth.  This recipe produces a thicker cream style broth, but the taste is still great!

Great comfort food.  I added sliced carrots and celery, and simmered in the broth first.  I added 1/4 C flour into the cream soup - to make it thicker.  

The biscuits (just plain cheapies from aldi) were a great substitute for homeade dumplings.

We'll have this again!

This was my first attempt at Chicken & Dumplings and boy, it was so easy and the final product was very delicious.  This is going to become a regular in our household since my husband requests this once a week.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the celery since my husband can't stand the taste of celery and I also added carrots & a couple cut-up potatoes.  I too, had to let it cook a few minutes longer to ensure the biscuits were done but it was worth the wait.  Absolutely wonderful!!  I used a good quality biscuit (but definitely NOT the flaky kind as I know that wouldn't hold up) instead of the cheap kind based upon another recommendation & they turned out great.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This was awesome.  My borfriend and I loved it!  It fills you up fast and it is extremely easy to make.  The Dumplings took a little longer than the recipe said.  Make sure to let the finish product sit for a few minutes before eating to let it thicken up.  Great Recipe!!!

Husband loved those things in it(the dumplings).I liked it because it was easy to prepare,fairly high calorie and even higher if served over rice,easy to chew and swallow plus tasted good.Husband has cancer so I am always looking for higher calorie,easy to chew and swallow but tasty dishes.I used broth instead of water and 2 cans cream of chicken soup and added pearl onions and peas.Used Pillsbury golden homestyle dough.

I like this recipe b/c it's easy and the end result is delicious.  I used cream of celery the first time I made it and it was great.  The second time I tried cream of chicken and boiled the chicken in chicken broth as one person mentioned in their review.  Very good!  I also added some milk for a more "soupy" broth.  Great recipe in my book!

I have tried this a few times and find that the dumplings don't cook properly. They remain "doughy". The kids scrunch their noses at it. So I tried the same thing only cooking the biscuit dough in the oven first and topping it after they are cooked. Much better results.

Easy and delicious. I found it to be a bit salty though (even though I did not add extra salt to the recipe). I changed the recipe by cooking the chicken in chicken broth instead of water. Next time I'll just cook it in water to reduce the sodium. I also listened to the others' reviews and broke the dough into TINY pieces so it wouldn't taste too doughy.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I boiled chicken breast in chicken broth as others had done.  I used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  After I added the biscuits, I threw in a drained can of Veg-All.  Turned out great.

This recipe tasted very good.  I used one can of cream of celery soup and one can of cream of chicken soup.  While it was cooking, I threw in carrots and some frozen peas.  I only had the Grands refrigerated biscuit dough.  I tried to keep the pieces small but my husband still complained a little about the doughy taste in the dumplings.  Next time I will use something else for the dumplings, but this recipe had a great taste to it and it does taste awesome served over some mashed potatoes.

Hubby is a huge chicken and dumpling fan so I thought I would try this 'short cut' way instead of my usual all day deal with lots of different seasoning and homemade dumplings.  He asked that I please don't make this again because it is nowhere near being chicken and dumplings.

We loved this!!  I tweeked it of course.  I used 4 large chicken breasts cut into pieces and boiled them in 2 cans of chicken broth.  I added carrots, onion, celery and potatoes to cook with the chicken.  I then added a cup of water and a cup of white wine.  After 15 minutes I added 1 can of 99% fat free cream of chicken and 1 can of 99% fat free cream of celery.  I used store brand biscuit torn into tiny bits for the dumplings.  Covered it and let it cook for 15 minutes.  It was absolutely heavenly!!!! Will make over and over.

This recipe is a fantastic starting point. I tried what others recommended and boiled the chicken with wine, broth, and carrots. When I added the soup, I also threw in garlic, onion powder, and some poultry seasoning. I used Grands biscuits for the dumplings the first time, but the second time I ran out of them, so I dumped in half a bag of wide egg noodles, and I turned out better than before. Now I eat it that way everytime.

This recipe got mixed reviews at our house.  Me and my husband thought it was okay and it scored points for being cheap and easy.  My 18 month old daughter (the pickiest one in the family) loved it and kept saying yummy.  And my brother said it just tasted like cream of chicken soup.  I will cut the recipe in half and make it for my daughter for lunch in the future.

Simple to make and very good. I let mine simmer for quite a bit longer than suggested, but I think that just made the flavor better.

This was delicious! A friend and I went on a hunt for a really good chicken and dumpling recipe. We tried recipes that required us to cook a whole chicken with veggies and then make the dough from scratch and roll it out.... None of those even compare to this one. So simple to make. And very yummy. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth and added onions, carrots, celery, peas and parsley. My husband loved it.

Very good,  Very quick, very easy.  Used the Creme of Chicken instead of water.  Served it with noodles.  Absolutely delicious.  Family loved it too.

UNBELIEVABLE!!! I was a little Nervous in making this dish, since I have never tried before but this is one dish you just have to try!!! I did make adjustments and added some stuff that was suggested by other people... I used chicken breast instead of thighs. I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water, I also added chopped carrotts to the water. Towards the end when everything was cooking I added some canned sweet peas that I had. Oh, and when I added the soup and everything together, I also added some fresh chopped up mushrooms. Everything came together Wonderfully!!! My husband LOVED it!!! Maybe a little too much :)

This is a good recipe. I only had cream of chicken soup so I used that. I cooked it for about 30 minutes after I added the biscuits because I wanted to make sure it wasn't too doughy.

My family enjoyed this dish.  I had bone-in chicken thighs, so I used those instead & just removed the skin & bones after they were cooked. Next time I make this, I will add some peas & carrots to make it a meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This was TERRIFIC!!!!!  So easy and so good too.  Even my kids loved it.  I did use 1cn Cream of Chicken and 1cn Cream of Celery instead.  I served with cornbread (Jiffy) for a side.  This was too good and great for a stormy day.  Will make again for sure.

I've made this recipe 3 times and used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery soup.  I always boil our left over rotisserie chicken carcass and meat.  Debone it and add the soup.  It is quick, easy and tasty. I've found it is just as quick to make my MIL's recipe for dumplings as it is to pinch off pieces of biscuit.  It tastes better too!  Thanks for delicious chicken soup idea.  The whole family loves it!

I didn't have cream of celery soup so I changed to cream of mushroom and I actually wanted it more complex so I added corn, peas, & celery.  I didn't have biscuit dough so I used Biquick's dumpling recipe.  My husband and son loved it.  My son is usually very picky so that was great.  I also added more pepper than I would've liked but they liked it cuz they like spicy food.  :)

This took me back to my childhood!  It came out perfectly and was easy and cheap.  Good rainy day dinner and my husband loved it.  I added a boullion cube to the water so I could cut down on the salt but lots of pepper.

Extremely tasty! Very easy and virtually failure proof. I added extra garlic, and mixed the celery and chicken soup. Also followed another reviewers advice and  cooked the chicken in wine and broth. The only change I would make is add more chicken. Six thighs was not enough after deboning and  skinning. Great recipe, I will make again.

I was looking for something fast and easy, and I found it! I actually made the bisquits from scratch, and used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom because that's all I had on hand. It turned out delicious! Even my picky 3 year old ate it!

If we could, we would rate this higher than 5 stars. I omitted the salt. I needed to cook the biscuits a bit longer than 8 mins. but it was worth the wait.

This was a great, tastes-like-it-took-all-day meal.  I added a cup of frozen mixed veggies and used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.  I also cooked the chicken in broth as suggested.  It was a bit salty for my taste, so I think next time I'll use half broth and half water.  EASY, EASY, EASY to put together.  A great meal-saver for the weekdays.

This was very tastey and very easy.  I used chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand.  This is exactly the type of dumpling I was looking for by using the refrigerator biscuit dough.  Delicious!

My family and I liked this recipe very much. I did change some things. I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, some frozen pea,frozen corn and I peeled and cubed 2 potatoes up and added it to the soup. I also used chicken thighs with the bone in. When the chicken was done cooking, I just removed the bone and skin and tore the meat up into bite size pieces.

I FOLLOWED SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.  MY HUSBAND HAS ASKED FOR IT EVERY WEEK SINCE I FIRST MADE IT.  GREAT WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

My family LOVED this.  I, of course, tweaked the recipe because I always do.  Added some white wine, chicken broth, celery, onions and garlic to the poaching liquid.  Instead of reserving 3 cups of that liquid, I strained it and then reduced it to 3 cups.  Added peas and extra seasoning (pepper, chicken broth granules, bay leaf, marjoram) to the dish after I added the canned soup (1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken - both reduced fat).  Delicious!!!

This was such an easy dinner to make. I thought really good chicken and dumplings came with alot of time and effort. I WAS WRONG! This is the only recipe I will use from now on. I followed the recipe to a "T". It is excellent just the way it is.

I will use the recipe again and again - The entire family enjoyed it - I mixed a little milk and flour and added it at the end to thicken it a little bit - I also sauteed some onion and added it - Next time I will sautee the onion and some celery as well - Thanks for a great comfort food recipe

This recipe was great!  I used boneless skinless chicked breasts instead of thighs, so to up the chicken flavor I boiled the breasts in one can of broth and enough water to make 3 cups when it was time to add the dunplings.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery soup, and it was great!  I tried cutting Grands biscuits into 4, but the dumplings came out too big - next time I will use regular size biscuits cut into fourths.  Overall though, great recipe!  My picky husband loved it!  -Allison

I was skeptical about the refridgerator biscuts but it turned out great!  The dumplings were just like grandma makes (only amazingly easy!)  My family loves this recipe.  Great comfort food for a cold night.

This came out good, but I think would have been much better if I just followed the recipe.  I added vegetables like suggested and it tasted more like a chicken pot pie. Around the vegetables, the broth and dumplings tasted real good!

This recipe is AWESOME! And after the first time fixing it, I didn't even need the recipe in front of me anymore. My husband LOVED it. It went over so well, we had it two nights in a row! I also used two cans of cream of chicken and added some frozen mixed veggies. Good, good easy comfort food my family loves.

Made this recipe for dinner last night. We
all loved it. I put in a can of cream of celery
and a can of cream of chicken.I also added about
a tablespoon of chicken bouillon to the water
while cooking the chicken. Don't add salt til after you taste if you add bouillon.

Taste Great, Very Fast to make and the taste is close to the dumplings I make from scrach.  I used cream of chicken in stead of celery, but I may use cream of celery or mushroom next time just to see witch one taste better.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

The whole family loved this, even my picky 3 year old ate it.  I didn't have the celery soup so I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken and added a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I never knew it could be so easy to make dumplings. This is a keeper.

Good recipe.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup and chicken breasts.  I seasoned the chicken with Nature's seasoning and added butter to the pot when cooking the chicken.  I pinched pieces of the biscuit and dropped into the broth instead of rolling them into balls.  I also cooked it longer after adding the dumplings.  I got a rave review for dinner.  Will be cooking this again......waiting for winter.

This was sooo easy and delicious! I made a couple changes...I used chicken breast tenderloins and cooked them in two cans of Swanson's chicken broth. I added diced potato to the broth. Separately I sauteed diced onion in some butter and then added a tablespoon of minced garlic. Then added this to the broth with the chicken. I also added baby carrots and minced celery and a bay leaf. Later I added 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery soup and poured in 1/4 cup of heavy cream...I simmered until the potato and carrots were tender..added sea salt and freshly ground pepper, tossed in some frozen peas, and topped with the biscuit dough. Cooked as the recipe said and served. My guest loved it and so did I! Total comfort food!!

2-3 cans of broth and rotisserie chicken juices to simmer, 1 cream of chicken, 1 cream of celery plus frozen carrots/ peas to boil- add small balled up biscuit mix (half the can) cover for 10 mins.
Added shredded chicken, 10-15 mins.
It was pretty delightful. And quick

A good home made chicken stock is essential to producing great results !  I use a whole chicken.  I use enough water to cover the chicken and then add the following.   2 bay leaves, 1 whole onion chopped, 3 stalks of celery and a couple/few chopped carrots.  Fresh herbs are best but store bought will do. I use Italian seasoning (approx 3 tsp.), Rosemary, thyme, and smashed garlic.  Some salt and pepper to taste.  When the chicken is finished cooking then strain the stock well to remove any small bones, remove the bay leaves,  and return it to the pot.  I use 1 can of cream of chicken soup with herbs.  Whisked in well with the stock and then add about a 1/2 cup of whole milk or 1/2 & 1/2 (what ever you have is fine)....Bring the whole thing up to a gentle boil, and start dropping in the torn or cut biscuits.  I quarter mine and then add them slowly. Put the lid on it and let the dumplings cook (they puff up) while watching carefully not to burn the pot.   Adjust the herbs/seasoning to taste.  I realize I've made a lot of changes here but the extra time to make your own stock will make all the difference in the world. Wishes to you all for happy cooking.

This is a wonderful base recipe and thank all of you for your reviews and additions. I plucked a couple of your suggestions, the holy trinity of onion, celery, and carrot, the three soup combo of creams of celery, chicken, and mushroom, then added 2 small cans of mushroom pieces, rosemary, turmeric, curry, and thyme.
Uh oh, I only had a can of flaky biscuits, and since someone said they don't work as well, I opted for a can of pizza dough. I cut it into strips, then tore off pieces that I rolled into marble-sized balls. I rolled those in flour as someone suggested, which gave me the classic, thick broth. Thanks for that one!
The result was a savory, hearty, stick to your insides dish that we devoured! And the best part? Leftovers! It'll be even better, tomorrow! Thanks y'all??

Yummy! But I prefer to cook the chicken in seasonings, with onions, garlic and not drain, then add 1 can cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken! Mmmmmm.

My spouse and I enjoyed this recipe. It was really easy to make. I did make a few changes though. I used cream of chicken instead of the cream of celery. Also, I added a can of mixed vegetables to the dish. I diced some onion and added that as well. This dish was a pleaser and I will definitely be making it again soon!

This is a good basic recipe but where are the veges in the picture??  I  added fresh green beans and some peas and carrots from the freezer. Used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery but added some celery seeds.

this is been a good recipe but I made an alteration that made it incredible. instead of two cans of celery soup I used one cream of chicken and one celery. I also boiled chicken thighs and chicken broth to bring out more flavor. once fully assembled I included a bay leaf to add more flavor. and I always use honey butter biscuit dough which makes it incredible

So tasty! The only thing that I changed was I sauteed some celery and carrots in butter to create a bit of a stock base. This was so easy, and so yummy!

Easy and inexpensive. This is a great go-to for a potluck or a group meal where you need to make a lot but don't want to spend a fortune. It tastes great and is quick to make.

I made this using the modifications of sautéed onions and adding carrots, celery, and chicken broth. Next time, I think I will also add cream of chicken soup. It was a little heavy on the celery flavor. I will also take out more water so it's creamier. My family loved it.

I understand the popularity of this recipe is likely it's minimal ingredients where it's so easy to make, but it's bland on its own. Admittedly chicken and dumplings usually has no veggies, but it needs it to liven up an otherwise dull recipe. Suggesting salt as a flavor is wrong given how much salt is in cream of ___soups. Herbs yes, salt no!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, cream of chicken soup and chicken broth rather than water. I also added some veggies, just to give the dish some color. Very good and easy.

Easy and tasty! I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it worked out well.

Edited to add: the next time I made this I tried one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery, and adding some carrots, celery, onion and crushed garlic to the chicken/water mixture when boiling. A very delicious upgrade!

Simple comfort food!  I added in a bag of mixed veggies just to round out the meal a bit more. Also, I cut the biscuits a bit smaller so it would be easier for the girls to eat w/o us having to cut them up. The family enjoyed this...I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is good as is, though I made a few changes to it as per other reviewers suggestions. I used chicken breast and substituted one of the cans of cream of celery with a can of cream of chicken. I also used a box of chicken broth along with the water and added some carrots, celery, and onion. It turned out to be delicious and really easy to make as well! I will certainly be making this again!

This was a good base recipe, but required more seasoning for my taste.  I added to the broth, a can of chicken broth + water (just to cover chicken), tarragon, basil, garlic salt, pepper, 3 bay leaves, minced onion, & celery stalk tops.  After removing & shredding the chicken, I added fresh carrots & celery and let cook until vegies were soft, then returned the chicken, added 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of celery, brought to a boil and added biscuit dumplings and cooked accordingly...was so flavorful!

With my own personal touch of seasoning and frozen mixed veggies of corn green beans and peas it came out Riley delicious. Don't be shy of seasoning it really completed the recipe. Also I used pre frozen biscuits and pre cooked them in the oven as directed and the second the formed and had a light crust I pulled them and it crated the doughness I was looking for. Awesome!

I made it with chicken broth from a box and cream of chicken soup.  I also used those little frozen vegetables.  I liked it.  Austin liked it and Kaja liked it.  Others didn't complain.  May try cream of celery next time and some onions and garlic.

Just finished making this recipe. it turned out great. I gave 4 stars just because the directions were a little vague about adding what vegetables desired.  I enjoyed using the premade dough caise i had my toddler on one arm while making this. Itwas very simple and I will use it again.

I love Chicken and dumplings.  My Mom made it for our family and it was always delicious but when I made for my family I could never get the dumplings quite right.  this recipe was right on time.  My dumplings came out perfect, thank you!  I will make again.

This was a quick and simple recipe. And my roommate and I definitely enjoyed it. I don't cook often, so I was glad it was something I could handle. I did it just as written, it was quick, it was tasty, and now it's gone. ??

I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had.  Also, I used a can of chicken stock in place of some of the water and added a bag of frozen peas and carrots.

I was very skeptical at first cause it sounded to easy, but no follow these exact instructions and bam there you have it! The only substitutions that I made was using chicken broth instead of the soup it suggested and added carrots and celery!

It was so good even my chef friend loved it!! I made it organic so made some changes. I used condensed cream of chicken soup instead as couldn't find organic celery soup. And I added 2 stalks of celery. It was delicious and had it over organic frozen broccoli. I'd make it again and I've shared the recipe with friends. Yummy

I made it quickly and easily and it's as good as my Grandma used to make.  I did substitute 1 can of Cream of Chicken plus the Celery one, and for dumplings I used a piecrust I had on hand, cut into strips (like Grandma's).  It's a Keeper.

Not sure what i did wrong but the "dumplings" were still raw after 30 mins of simmering.  the chicken mixture was good but salty.   the instructions could be better.  The picture shows carrots in the dish, but there is no mention of adding vegetables in the recipe.  There is no mention of whether this should be cooked covered or uncovered.  Perhaps that is why mine flopped?   i make my own chicken and dumplings in the crockpot and it always turns out great.  I am sticking to my recipe and skipping this short-cut recipe

Thank you for the recipe base!  I had never made  chicken and dumplings before your recipe showed up on my email and I thought I'd give it a try. I read through about 50 comments and took a lot of those into making my own recipe  I want to give you five stars for your basic super easy recipe I never imagined using biscuit dough for the dumplings but it turned out great!    I  used pillsbury grands biscuits and cut each with a ticTac toe pattern as one reviewer  suggested   I sautéed  my chicken thighs in olive oil garlic, onions and  S& P cut the chicken into chunks and poured the juices in the pot I did not use water, i used  2 C organic chicken broth, 1 can each of cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup   1 white onion, Baby carrots and 2 stalks of celery, salt and pepper to taste

I chose to make this because it had few ingredients and I never heard of using rolls of refrigerated biscuits for dumplings. This recipe is more like a  thick soup. The "dumplings" were like chewing gum. The dish was unappealing  in appearance and tasted just okay. Very rich and filling. I tossed the leftover and will not make this again.

I was very hesitant to make this, but with all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I made many changes based on the reviews -- used breast meat in place of thighs and bumped the number of cans of soup up to 3, with one of them being cream of chicken soup.  I also added diced onion, celery and carrot to the mix plus salt and pepper to taste (I probably had a little more than three cups of broth in my pan).  I was very surprised at how good this was with those changes.  That being said, it wasn't much easier than my regular chicken and dumpling recipe, but my husband loved the soup, while I loved how easy and mess-free it was to make the dumplings.  Next time I'll probably try a hybrid with this soup recipe and my own dumplings.  All in all, very tasty.

Super quick and easy. i had to modify it to what i had on hand. I used gnocchi instead of biscuit dumplings, cream of chicken in stead of cream of celery,  and added a bit of milk for a creamier flavor. I also added green beans. all in all, i'd make it again.

Used 1 box chicken broth, 1 can Cream of Mushroom soup and 1 can Cream of Chicken soup. Added 1 medium onion, 2 cloves garlic, 3 bay leaves and 2 large carrots. A bit salty, may do reduced sodium next time.

This recipe was awesome! Only changes I made was one can cream of broccoli soup and one can of cream of celery soup, then I added greenbeans, mushrooms, carrots and tomatoes  and it came out perfect. My father-in-law got 3rds and that is how I know this recipe is great because he is a picky eater at his age.Next time I make this recipe I am going to add small diced potatoes.

1,, 3, ingredients, I don't care.  opening up somebody's can of soup, who cares.  so its far from a gourmet meal but today's hectic schedule many times calls for one.  if you want veggies, add 'em.  many times simple is enough.

I did not make this recipe, but it is so close to one that I do make, I wanted to share. All you need is chicken broth or stock (two 32 oz. boxes), chicken (pulled from a rotisserie chicken or boiled pieces) and one package of flour tortillas. Just bring the stock or broth to a boil, add the cooked chicken and then cut the tortillas into about 1.5” squares and add them one at a time to the boiling broth.  Boil this for about 45 minutes or so and then you have close to homemade chicken and dumplings. This is the style chicken and dumplings with a more noodle like dumpling, which is more of a southern style, not the biscuit type dumpling, which is more of a northern type dumpling. The flour in the tortillas thickens the stock up to a perfect consistency. Also, add salt and pepper to taste (more pepper then salt, as the stock is already pretty salty). I will try this recipe too, as I have wanted to have the biscuit type dumpling for a while now and this looks as simple as the one that I make. I just hope my born and raised southern family will go for it.

Some of you people crack me up. If you use this recipe but make "modifications" then it is now a NEW recipe. You should post your NEW recipe for others and leave the original for the person who posted it.

I made this tonight and my family loved it. Everyone had seconds. The only change I made was I seasoned the water I used to boil the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I did not have any canned biscuits, so I thawed some frozen biscuits, cut them, and added them to the soup. I will definitely make this again.

I agree that this recipe is a good base recipe. I boiled my chicken in a pot filled over half full f water. Seasoned water with garlic powder onion powder basil thyme pepper and a little salt. I saved all the water, After cutting up chicken I added it back to the remaining water and then added the biscuit dough let it come back to a boil turned down to low and added 2 cans of mixed veggies and let simmer for 15 mins. I did not add the creamed soup because the biscuit dough thickens the stock nicely.

Wow! This is easy and great!  So delicious!  Never thought chicken and dumplings could be easy! :) I did sautée garlic and onion in butter before adding chicken. I added carrots and celery while chicken was cooking.  I removed the chicken before dropping the biscuits in. I used the generic biscuits that cost .50 and cut them in quarters with a pizza cutter.  I added the  chicken back in and a handful of canned peas since my little one wanted peas. Amazing!!!!  Thank you!!!!

Followed the recipe and added a package of frozen peas and carrots to give it a little more.  Let it simmer for a bit after I put the dough in and I tried to give it ample time to cook, but even after 15 minutes, it still tasted raw with a nasty texture.  In some cases it was starting to melt out so it was this slimy, runny, dough. The soup base with chicken is awesome, but I think I will go the route of potatoes to add then store bought biscuit dough.

I just made it using one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery and used broth instead of water.  I also used chicken thighs and added garlic, onion flakes and a bay leaf to the boiling chicken.  The result was good - but it was very salty!  I'm guessing it was my chicken broth?  I'm about to add some mixed veggies to it to see if that helps the saltiness.  Good recipe, though!

Excellent recipe!  I boiled 6 chicken breasts in 8 cups of water with 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  I left 4 cups of that water so I could mix it with the canned soups (I used 1 cream of chicken low fat & 1 cream of celery).  I sauteed a small diced onion & 3 teaspoons of minced garlic in some of the reserved water (2 tablespoons) in a separate pan.  My husband loves pepper so I put a lot of it in there.  I chose to add 1 small can of peas & carrots.  In the end, I did have to add cornstarch to thicken it up a little bit.  Overall, this recipe is a keeper that I'll add to my rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Perfect for a cold winter day. I sautéed half an onion, 2 celery stalks, 2 carrots and garlic in olive oil before adding the chicken. Boiled in 2 c chicken broth and 1 c water. I used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken. Comfort food at its best.

I made a few modifications and this came out excellent! I boiled the chicken with several cloves of garlic and onions and used chicken broth instead of water. I also used one chicken bouillon cube. and added 1/2c of white wine vinegar. I used two cans of condensed cream of celery and on can of condensed cream of chicken. Yum!

I've made this several times, with a few  revisions.  I reserved 4 cups of the broth, instead of 3. Add 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and 1lb bag of frozen mixed  vegetables.(already boiled and strained). If I don't have Cream of ck  soup, sour cream works. !Delicious!! My family wants it all the time!

I think this is a great base recipe, but I would definitely recommend a few changes.  First, add two cans of chicken broth to the water while boiling the chicken.  Replace one can of cream of celery with one can cream of chicken.  Instead of pulling apart the biscuits, first flatten them in a cutting board with your hands and then cut into thirds.  Finally, add a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (corn, carrots, and green beans.). With those changes it is for sure a 5 star recipe.  Love the base recipe, it just needs a few tweaks and it is amazing!

I added peas and carrots , celery (winged the measurements) , sage, garlic powder, any type of chicken seasoning I had.  Used a rotisserie chicken ( with skin and a drum stick on bone for added flavor) but cut the chicken into chunks. Put it a slow cooker  , once the cooker got really hot I added the pre made biscuits. DONE!

I've made this at least a dozen times and I usually double or triple it. It's a great freezer meal if you add the dumplings just before serving. I add veggies, celery, carrots, potatoes, maybe a bay leaf if I have it. My current strategy is to double it and freeze half before adding the dumplings.

Just as I remembered from my childhood!  I did follow some of the other suggestions.  I browned the chicken 1st.  I boiled the chicken in 1 box of chicken broth.  I left all the liquid and used 2 cans of biscuits.  Perfection!

I made it mostly as directed, except I put a package of frozen peas & carrots in it.  Delicious.  And easy.  I had it on the table in under an hour.  My kids and husband all enjoyed it.  It's a simple meal that is warm and filling.  Pure comfort food!

Super easy to make, my first time making this, but with a few modifications of my own based on other's reviews.  I added onions, celery and sliced carrots and made my own dumplings instead of using a refrigerated can of biscuits, and my family LOVED it.  Pot was almost gone by the end of the evening.  Glad I doubled the recipe.

I used 3 12.5 oz cans of chuck chicken breast and 3 cups of chicken stock instead of 6 chicken thighs boiled with 3 cups of remaining water.  This recipe was a good start for me but I made it easier for my busy life style.

This was my first time EVER making chicken and dumplings. I used this recipe as the base and used a few suggestions from others. It turned out amazing! The only chicken I had were boneless chicken breast strips, so I boiled 5 of them in a little more than 3 cups of water for about 20 minutes. After I took them out to let them cool, I opened a can of Veg-All and poured it in the water I had just taken the chicken out of. I let that cook for about 10 minutes while I broke the chicken up into pieces then put the chicken back in. Then I added one can of condensed cream of celery soup and one can of condensed cream of chicken soup. I used 4 of the 8 giant butter biscuits I had breaking them into small pieces, flattening them and dropping them in. They cooked for about 5 minutes on medium, then I turned the burner to low and put a lid on the pot letting it simmer for about 30 minutes. Overall, it was really good. Next time I make this, I will use a different kind of biscuit, because my dumplings were pretty thick and could have used a little more cooking time.

My first attempt at making chicken & dumplings and it was a home run.  My daughter even wanted to take leftovers in her thermos for lunch at school.  I didn't have canned biscuit dough so I just made it from scratch and I added some frozen veggies and this is a new family favorite at our house.  Thanks so much for posting!

This was delicious, however, I made some changes. I made my own cream of chicken, used 3 c homemade chicken broth and used leftover baked chicken (rather than boiling the chicken). I added about 1/2 c finely chopped celery, 1 c chopped carrots and 1 c peas. My dumplings turned out a little too mushy so next time around I'm going to make homemade dumplings and boil them in salted water prior to adding them.

Very good basic recipe! I used turkey leftovers in it and took some advice from another reviewer by sauteing garlic and onions with some poultry seasonings, then adding turkey and cooking in a 2 cups of broth before adding 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, frozen corn and peas.  I cut up the biscuits and mixed them in.  I kept it covered for a bit before taking the cover off.  Awesome.

This was a quick and easy recipe but I could not just add salt and pepper to chicken and dumplings along with two cans of soup??? No way, that would be a disaster dish in my household. I added some curry powder, marjoram, ground turmeric, and Bay Seasoning. Instead of adding regular salt I added seasoning salt. I also used chicken breast instead of chicken thighs. The kids went back for seconds so that is a score of 5 in our household! Thanks for the quick recipe

savory flavor and a quick easy dish for a cool autumn or cold winter night.   I too, used chicken stock and added in a few of my favorite seasonings.  Just a pinch of rosemary, thyme, cilantro and a bay leaf.  Yummy!!!!!

I used the advice from Reviewed on Feb. 9, 2004 by STELLAR7:Sauteed 1/8 c chopped onion and 1 lg. garlic clove (chopped) in 1 TBL butter before adding chicken. I used chicken tenderloin and covered it with 2 cans chicken broth. Did not drain any broth when chicken was done. Added 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/2 box frozen peas and carrots. Plus 2 canned chipotle peppers chopped. My entire family RAVED about this and I have 2 picky eaters. It was gone before I could make some for my husband's lunch :-) This was very tasty.

This was a good recipe, I just changed a few things. Since it was just my husband and I, I just did 2 chicken breast, 1 can of cream of chicken, 3/4 can chicken broth, 1/4 cup of water, pinch of black pepper and basel.  For the dumplings I used 4 frozen biscuits from a bag, let thaw and added to the pot when it was time. Cooked for about 8 minutes.  Ta da!!

Really tasty! My family loved it. The only thing is I didn't drain any water. I just added a couple pieces of chicken bullion. I also cut a few carrots into tiny pieces so they would cook faster. Turned out great! Tasted even better the next day. Will make again.

I used this recipe as a base and ended up with an absolutely fabulous soup! I'd describe my end result as chicken pot pie in soup form (which is how I sold it to my English husband who initially turned his nose up at the idea of raw dough boiling in soup!). I covered 2 chicken breasts (about 1 lb) with 5 cups of water and 4 chicken bouillons. I boiled the chicken breasts for about 10 minutes so that they were JUST cooked, shredded them, and put them back in the pot with a half a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I added 2 cans cream of chicken soup, about 1 - 1.5 tsp. onion powder and garlic powder, black pepper, and half of the biscuits torn into bite size pieces. I boiled that for 5 minutes and then scooped out two bowls and the remaining dumplings for leftovers, then boiled the remaining dumplings.

My husband (British) and I (Northerner with a Southern paternal family) absolutely loved it! I felt like the 5 cups of water was perfect because it produced more of a broth, but if you're looking for a creamy, thick texture, the 3 cups in the recipe is probably perfect.

This recipe was my first attempt at making Chicken and Dumplings and my husband said I knocked it out of the park! 

I sauteed have an onion and 4 cloves of garlic (both chopped). Used boneless breast and thighs.  Substituted chicken broth for water, added cream of chicken and cream of potato soup and made dumplings following the Biquick box!  I will definitely make this again and again!
Thank you to whomever posted this recipe!

Was a hit with my mom and the kids.  It was easy and a fast recipe. We couldn't stay out the pot. It was cheap to buy as well. Under $20.00 for 6 servings.

This recipe is the BOMB!  I have 4 boys- 3teens and a 2nd grader PLUS my hubby.  I followed the recipe but had to quadruple the recipe.  I cooked boneless breasts in broth, and added cut carrots (plus 2 shredded- I have to get veggies in them any way I can).  I thought I would have left overs- BUT everyone ate 'till they almost burst.  Quick, Easy and Tasty- Who can ask for more...

Great easy recipe. I would skip simmering the chicken and just use a store bought roasted chicken and simmer the shredded chicken in 3cups chicken stock for 30mins. I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and 2cans cream of celery and one can cream of chicken. It turned out great. I cant wait to make it again.

I tried this recipe for my family and I must say everyone loved it. I never made chicken and dumplings before so I was worried about the outcome because it seemed too simple, but it turned out perfectly. I pretty much followed the directions, however I did take the advice of other raters and I boiled the thighs in chicken broth and added veggies. Even my 1 year old son enjoyed it and he can be a very picky eater at times. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe:)

This is almost 5 star worthy.  We just thought it needed a healthier cut of chicken.  I made a 3 serving version with 1 can of soup, 1.5 cups of water & 6 ounces of biscuits.  I also added 1 carrot and 1 stalk of celery that I boiled for 17 mins seperately.  VERY good!

Yowzers, this is good. And so easy. Some of the best cold weather comfort food ever. So glad I happened across this recipe. So easy to "own" this one, too. And following others' advice and tweaking is very worthwhile. We love one pot Dutch oven cooking. This is a keeper -- we've made it 3 times already since the beginning of the year!

I loved this, I diced 1/2 a medium sized white onion and 2 garlic cloves, cooked in oil until transparent then added sliced carrots, the chicken breasts (all I had-3 of them) and water to simmer for 15 minutes. I used the cream of celery just like it called for and could have made the dumplings bigger, I'd split each into about 6 pieces, but I think quarters would have worked better.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe. I followed most of the reviewers suggestions. I sauteed the chicken with garlic and onion, then let it simmer for 30 minutes or until easily shredded.  And I also used cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of the celery. Super easy and delicious weeknight meal.

Growing up I was never a big fan of chicken & dumplings for some reason, but my boyfriend wanted me to make some so I did. I love it now!!! I modified the recipe a little, adding chicken broth, some sauv blanc, garlic, and a sweet onion to the water the chicken was boiled in; and added frozen peas & carrots (they didn't get mushy or anything, but were cooked perfectly when added w/ the chicken). I also used 1 can cream of chicken instead of 2 cream of celery. Threw in some oregeno too. It was amazing! It does taste more like a chicken pot pie in some ways than my mom's ever did, but I loved it. Ate the leftovers two days straight til it was gone which is perfect because me and my boyfriend are both recovering from colds. Awesome!

I tried this recipe a couple of nights ago and liked it so much that eating the leftovers last night was something to look forward to.  I slightly modified it, like most reviewers, by adding fresh peas and carrots and lots of spices.  I also used chicken breasts instead of the thighs.  Lastly, I added a milk/cornstarch mixture to thicken it up a bit.  I found that rolling the biscuits in flour really helped eliminate the sticky dumpling problem.  I was sure not to crowd the pot with dumplings because they do indeed swell up.  I saved the extras for left overs.  The leftovers were better then the first serving.  This was a fantastic meal that I will certainly make again.

this recipe was GREAT!!  this was my first time ever making chicken and dumplings and this was a great recipe to use for it.  some changes i added was carrots, onions, parsley, minced garlic, and sazon goya (spanish seasoning), garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder with the chicken while it's cooking. I dont have a huge pot so i put the chicken and vegetables in my crock pot while i cooked the biscuits.  I used all the water from the chicken. when the biscuits were almost finished i put it all in the crock pot to cook for a little while. came out great!

Very good, I changed it some. I used Bisquik instead of canned biscuits. I also celery soup and cream of chicken & added some bouillon cubes. Everyone loved it.

This was delightfully simple for a college guy like me. I made plenty in order to have easy-to-reheat leftovers for later, and it reheats great, providing many tasty meals. I used one can cream of celery, one can cream of chicken. Like Mom used to make.

I loved this recipe. I have made similar recipes but always ended up with mushy dumplings( bisquik) that overwhelmed the soup. I did add frozen petite peas, half of cup and half cup mixed veggies of corn,breen beans, carrots, and added about a tbsp of knorr bouilloin to my broth. Cracked pepper on top after serving and it was delicious. Keeper for sure. Thanks

I changed this a little, I added a can of cream of chicken/cream of mushroom and 2 small cans of chicken broth.  I added celery seed and celery salt and some poultry seasoning - about 3 shakes.  It turned out wonderful and everyone loved it!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I did however, make some changes based on some other reviews.  I used one 10 oz can of chicken broth and covered the rest in water. I also used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken. The flavor was really good, my husband enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing:)

I used others ideas and plus I did my own thang. I used the fluffy whole wheat biscuit recipe from this site and I added shredded mozz. cheese to it. I set that in the refrigerator for an hour. I didn't roll it out and cut it, instead I just dropped  teaspoons of dough into the chicken mixature. Let it cook for 15 minutes and then simmer on low until it was time to eat. This tasted really good. It smells like my grandmother's C&D. That's a really good thing. Thank you

this was a good basic recipe.  My father -in-law liked alot which says  something.  He isn't into very spicy food and this fit the bill.  change I made was putting the pot of food into the overn for a few mins. to brown/firm the biscuits.  If I make this for me & my husband, would add more seasonings.  NOT complaining...just our taste.   Glad to find this recipe !

Really good and very easy.  I cooked the chicken with some onion and garlic.  I added a bay leaf once everything was combined and let it simmer for a while.  I also added carrots and peas to make it a one dish meal.  My six year old and two year old absolutely loved it!  I did, too!

Very good! I added some chopped onion, frozen peas and carrots, and some thyme. The dumplings took 15 minutes, and still were a little bit doughy. Probably Bisquick dumplings would be better (but also more work). Suggest reduced salt soups. For easy and delicious chicken and dumplings, this is the one.

Loved this recipe for the short prep and cook time.  My husband and 4-year-old daughter loved this recipe and there were leftovers for days.  I made some of the same changes that other reviewers made.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts boiled in water with chicken bouillon.  I used a can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery and I added carrots and celery. Very good and pretty quick - winning combination!

This was a good simple and basic recipe.  I did a few minor things differently.  I boiled a whole chicken with 2 cans of chicken broth and the rest water.  Once cooled, I took the skin off and pulled the meat off into pieces.  I then return the meat and water/broth to boil.  I used 1 can of biscuts and let boil for 12-15 minutes.  While the mixture was boiling, I cooked some mixed veggies (corn, peas and carrots).  Once everthing was done, I spooned the veggies over my portion of chicken and dumplings.

This was fantastic!  As others mentioned I made a few modifications...I used 3 large chicken breasts and one box of chicken broth and additional water to cover the chicken.   I also added a few cups each of carrots and celery, 1/2 large diced onion, 3 large garlic cloves and a bay leaf and simmered for about 20-30 minutes.   I then added one can each of cream of chicken and cream of celery soup.  This has made it into the rotation for sure!  We added Tabasco at the table to spice it up.  Fast and easy dinner!

Great and easy recipe.  I modified just a bit based on the previous recommendations and my taste.  Used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery.  I also rolled the biscuit dough in a little flower.  All and all, great recipe.

This was very easy and delicious!  I used chicken breast, but next time might use both breasts and thighs.  I also used chicken broth instead of water to boil the chicken.  I substituted one cream of chicken soup for the cream of celery and added frozen carrots.  I cut each biscuit into four before tossing them in the soup and they cooked nicely.

Overall, this was a quick and delicious recipe.  Couldn't give it 5 stars because the dumplings weren't quite right.  Will definitely make it again though I will make homemade dumplings next time.

This is a good basic recipe. and yes. I altered it too!  I used chicken breasts, boiled the chicken in 1 can (box) of chicken broth and water depending on how many I'm serving.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery.  Also used the canned biscuits, didn't add any veggies - just a personal preference.  It came out great.  My sis-in-law has a similar recipe but she adds a dash of tobasco and some Tony Chachere's which adds a tiny kick, but not too noticeable!  Enjoy!

I loved this recipe because it was so simple, but I did have to add some flour and milk mixture to it to make it thicker. I prefer a thicker sauce... Thanks for this easy recipe!

Very good recipe, will make again.  Family loved it and fought over the leftovers.   Even my husband who said He did like that, after tasting it ate 2 servings.  I did a few modification; used a rotisserie chicken.  Boiled covering it with water.  When falling apart take it out of the broth deboned after cooled enough.  So ended up using at least double the water called for and it was actually broth.  I also used 2 cans of buttermilk biscuits.  I did uses the 2 cans of cream of celery soup.  As i said the meal was a pleaser with my family.

This was much better than expected! I used 3 pieces of boneless breast chicken, and I put two chicken bullion cubes in with the water. I only had two cans cream of chicken which looked odd at first but ended up being creamy thick and delicious.  I added in black pepper, salt, and all seasoning and next time I will leave out the salt. I had mixed vegetables on the side, but mixing them in would really add a little something.  The biscuits I used were Pillsbury Grands and I didn't have room in the pot to put in all of them. Overall, I will definitely make this again! The boyfriend absolutely loved it!

This is excellent for a quick chicken and dumplings.  I prefer homemade dumplings, of course, but this recipe is 99% perfect and takes less than half as long to make.  It is a staple at our house- we have it at least once a month.  Thanks for sharing!!

I did not care for this recipe.  I'm used to true homemade chicken and dumplings.  This tasted like canned soup and the biscuits were gummy.  I know it cooked long enough but still gummy.  Very disappointed in all the positive reviews.

Very good winter comfort food. I followed STELLARS formula. 2 cans chicken broth, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can cream of mushroom, and frozen peas and carrots. Excellent.

Really really  good! I tweaked it like everyone else- I sauteed some onions and garlic, and carrots in a ton of butter, and then added chicken broth instead of water. I used one can of cream of chicken and one of cream and celery, and I added fresh chives and thyme to my bisquick drop dumplings. The boyfriend loves this dish in general and claimed this recipe was really good. Next time I may add some diced potato and celery, and experiment with more herbs- maybe add chives, thyme, and rosemary to the broth, or maybe some dill. Very very good the way it is though!!!

On it's own, it's not bad at all if you're a beginner, the this meal is lacking in the health & flavor department. Only a few teensy additions could help this meal and still keep it super easy:  1. Use half broth & half water to cover the chicken 2. Use lower sodium cream of celery soup 3. Add about a teaspoon of thyme in step 1 4. Add a small bag of frozen peas & carrots (or whatever veggie) during step 2

This is a very simple and tasty recipe that lends itself well to whatever modifications you might like. It's simplicity is part of what makes it so great, but I thought it was even better with a few modifications. I cooked the chicken in 4 cups of water that was mixed with 2 cans of low-sodium chicken broth, and I substituted the original 2 cans of cream of celery with 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 of cream of celery; the additional liquid helped with flavor but it also kept the soup from getting too thick at my high elevation. I also added 1 cup chopped carrots, 1 cup chopped celery, 1/4 cup chopped onions and a tablespoon of minced garlic that I sauteed lightly. I used a slightly larger can of biscuit dough than is recommended, and I took the pot off the heat and covered it for a few minutes to let the biscuits firm up without reducing the liquid further. All in all, a very good basic recipe that can be made even better with some very simple changes. It's my husband's new favorite. :)

Good starter recipe. I sauteed the chicken and some onion in a little olive oil before adding the water. When the "dumplings" were about halfway cooked, I added a bag of mixed vegetables.Turned out fantastic!

This is a great recipe!  I added a few ingredients sauteed 1 garlic clove, 2 fresh carrots, used 2 cans of crm of chkn soup and 1 capful of yellow food coloring for beauty.  Instead of using biscuits I purchased a bag of Skinner Dumplings (on the pasta isle) and added at the end.  I prepared a pan of Golden Sweet Cornbread and Barbara's Golden Pound Cake from this site to go with it!  Wow!!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe - but nothing special.    I elected to cook my biscuits separately in the oven.    I used the layered style biscuits.   I broke up the layers and spread them out on the plate and poured the sauce over them.    If you take this approach you need to reduce the liquid in the sauce.   I cut the water in half.

I modified, like many others. I added some cans of mixed veggies and instead of using Cream of Celery, I used Cream of Chicken. I also boiled the chicken with some chicken broth.

Good comfort food. My 3-yr-old said, "Mmm, I like this!" which is a first for him! I followed the suggestions of using chicken broth and 3 types of soup, which was good but made it extremely salty.

Maybe okay for a quick meal, but nothing like good old southern chicken and dumplings. I'm sorry, but this is just nothing special at all.

Very good. I made the dumplings in a seperate pot of boiling water then added them to the soup.  This allowed them to really fluff up.  I also added frozen peas, carrots, and corn.

This was really great.  I like my chicken and dumplings thicker, so I added an additional can of cream of potato soup to try to thicken it.  The end result was still a bit thinner than I would have liked, more like a soup than a stew.  I also added broccoli, green beans, and corn (leftovers in the fridge!) and had only an 8oz can of biscuits to use. And I used 2 chicken breasts instead of thighs and I think it was a good proportion of meat.  Overall I think this was excellent and if I made it again the only change I would make it to thicken it up with some cornstarch.

I have made a lot of things but never chicken and dumplings...but my daughter requested them for her birthday dinner so I made them.  Oh, what a hit they were!  I did not have time to read through 500+ reviews but I did add a bag of frozen soup veggies to give this dish some nutritional value and also used chicken breasts, otherwise I made it as written.  I will be making this again, it was not too hard and didn't take too long.

I usually make most things from scratch but decided to give this a try after reading the positive reviews.  Everything was okay tasting but had a store-bought, came-from-a-can quality about it (due to the condensed soup and packaged biscuits?).  Or maybe it's because I can't do anything the easy way :)  Good luck for everyone else though!

This was SO easy to make. I have a 6 month old and it was quick and tasted fabulous--It reminded me of the dumplings at Cracker Barrell! Highly reccommend it---Also, I used 6 boneless chicken breasts to have more chicken and it worked GREAT!

This was delicious. Did make a few changes: added purple onions, fresh parsley, fresh garlic, chicken bouillon, and carrots.  Yummy.

Started with this recipe and added from other chicken stew recipes from this site. For 4 servings I used 6 skinless boneless chicken thighs, 1 can condensed cream of celery soup, one can condensed cream of chicken soup, about 1 cup chopped carrots and 2 cups diced white skin potatoes (skin left on). I started with boiling the water (enough that covers the chicken in  a large stewing pot) then I put the thighs in the water. I added on large diced shallot (I have an onion allergy) with the chicken thighs and let them boil together for about 25 minutes. Then I took the chicken out, let cool for about 10 minutes, then dice them and leave aside. Add the soups, and bring to a boil again then return chicken to pot. Lower heat and let simmer for about an hour. Check liquid level, don't let it dry out or burn on the bottom, keep a good amount of liquid in the pot. About an hour before serving time add carrots and potatoes, and still simmer. For the dumplings I used the tube dinner rolls from Pilsbury, half of the tube (5 or 6) placed on top of the stew and then cover again for about 10 minutes, then serve. Everyone ate seconds and there was a little left over for my lunch the next day.

Oh this was sooo good. I am so made that i didnt make more! i dont usually post a review but i just had to. I used 2 cans of cream soup (cream of chix & celery), cooked my chix in chicken broth, but i seasoned my chix first and seasoned the water. I added 1/2 bag of frozen peas and carrots, and diced onions. I wasnt sure about the biscuits, and really wanted to make the bisquick ones but didnt have the time. The refridgerated one was delish. I cut each biscuit into 4 and flated and rolled em a lil. Dh says this is definelty a keeper. I plan on making this tomorrow for my FIL that comes out of the hospital tommorrow. 
~Thanks

Super easy!! Great as is or as a 'starter' recipe! I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, only 3 large chicken breasts & 1-1.5 cups of water. DELICIOUS! Used the extra 'soup' as a gravy for homemade mashed potatoes YUM!! :)

This was so yummy! I used the leftovers from the spicy rapid roast chicken recipe. I made stock out of the carcass with onion and spices. Used 3 cups of the stock with a can of cream of chicken with herbs and one plain cream of chicken. Put it in the slow cooker with the chicken pieces, frozen veggies and a T. of tapioca. 30 minutes before serving I mixed Bisquick dumplings (on back of the box) and dropped on the top. My whole family gobbled them up!

This came out awesome! I added carrots, onions, garlic & seasonings to the water before I added the chicken to boil. I added the cream of celery soup, cream of onion soup & cream of chicken soup. My family loved it! This is a keeper! =)

I used drumetts for the chicken and cut up flour tortilla strips for the dough. Also you get a good flavor if you use chicken broth instead of water.  Season with garlic salt and pepper.  Kids cleaned the pot. :)

I had to change this some.  I used chicken breast instaed of thighs. I used boullion instead of the water from the chicken. I didn't have cream of celery and instead used cream of chicken and mushroom.  I added a bag of veggies and made my own biscuits as I had fridge biscuits.  I cooked it on medium for 13 minutes with the top on.  It's came out great!

My daughter made this for dinner tonight. She apparently read some of the reviews and did some changes. The result was more of a chicken stew rather than chicken and dumplings. I was ok but definatly NOT chicken and dumplings. Somewhere in all of the revisions, too much of "something" was used and nearly ruined it.

After reading a number of reviews, I altered the recipe by using one can of cream of celery and one cream of chicken. If I'm making a bigger batch, I'll add a can of cream of mushroom soup as well. I use chicken broth to cook the chicken, and I've used canned chicken as well with great results! I chop up the biscuits into little pieces as well since they swell up. I serve this all on top of mixed veggies with a little salt and pepper. A great recipe, pretty foolproof and will definitely use again!

A very good basic recipe.  I followed prior recommendations and used 1 can of chicken broth in the boiling of the chicken.  I also let the dumplings cook for about 13 minutes.  The rest of the recipe was followed exactly.

Num! I added plenty of seasoning to the water, some fresh carrots and celery, and let the dumplings cook for 8 minutes uncovered and then 10 minutes covered. My kids really liked it, even the picky one.

This recipe was sooo disappointing!!  My husband has been BEGGING for me to make chicken and dumplings without vegetables - so I decided to try this recipe.  I couldn't eat more than three bites.  The cream of celery soup was so strong - we both ended up feeling sick.  I love chicken and dumplings - but this didn't make the cut!!

Very tasty and very little effort.  I sort of liked one of the previous raters addition of white wine to the soup.  Made it a little more special.

This was really good and really easy to make.  Even my picky eater raved about it..."It's not just good, it's super good" according to him.  I used chicken breast instead of the thighs and added some onions and carrots, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

I have made several kinds of chicken and dumplings... and while this is not the best tasting chicken and dumplings I have made, the simplicity of it gives it five stars. Don't get me wrong- it tasted really good! Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe!

It was pretty good- my hubby hates chicken & dumplings and liked this. I wasn't crazy about the texture, and I'd use a bit less salt, but very good other than that.

We love this recipe.  Though, we use split chicken breasts for ours, since we don't like dark meat that much.  Highly recommend!

We made broth by boiling a Rotisserie Chicken we had already eaten part of. Then made a much larger pot than the recipes, kept the cream soups to 2 (1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken). Chopped and boiled carrots and celery added to chicken pot when soft. Used some of the vegetable broth and added green onion, Italian seasoning, 3 crushed garlic cloves, bay leaves, and a little bit of chili powder--It was AWESOME. I used two mini cans of plain biscuits, I played around with how thick to leave the dough because my boyfriend prefers a thicker dumpling, worked well with a range of thicknesses. Gave it only a 4 stars because I made so many changes I  read in the reviews.

Family loved it.  Very easy to make.  Did some modifications though as other reviewers had done: used 1 cup chicken broth plus 2 cups of water, used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery, also added chopped celery/onion/carrots and had to cook about 15 minutes instead of 7-8 mins  because I didn't tear the biscuits into small enough chunks.  Loved the fact it was so easy and so tasty!

This was a wonderful base recipe for me to add a few things to! I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, and 1 can of chicken broth.  I added a few spices. I added carrots and celery.  I used jiffy baking mix to make the dumplings. My hubby said this was the BEST chicken and dumplings I has ever had!!!!  YUMMMMMMMMM

this recipe was simple and easy. I needed to find one like my mothers, since i couldnt get a hold of her today, and this is it.  i was skeptical when it said to add teh canned soups but it taste perfectly homemade. Also, boiled bone in chicken with carrots, quarted onion and a bayleaf in 1/2 chicken stock 1/2 water. used busquick to make the dumplings!!! Wouldnt make any other way!!!

Great recipe! I had leftover turkey in the freezer, so I cooked it with broth made of water, chicken boullion, basil, pepper and garlic powder. I added sauteed onion and carrots. I also made homemade dumplings. Oh yeah, I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken soup. My family raved and raved! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I've made this several times and love it!  It's soo easy.  I use chicken breast instead of thighs and add more water.  I put the chicken in the crock pot till done, then it pulls apart so easily and I have the broth from the chicken too.  Then I add the rest for an hour or so.  It is super simple.  Thanks for this one!!

This was easy and tasted great.  Based on what others said, here's what I did: Cooked chicken in broth, tore off thumb-sized pieces of biscuit dough, added some carrots and celery.  I would not add any extra salt as this was pretty salty anyhow with the biscuits and condensed soups - next time I'll used reduced sodium soups.

We did not like this recipe. I made it with only small alterations--added some garlic powder and used chicken broth instead of part of the water. It just tasted too much like soup from a can. The biscuits turned out well in the crock pot. Might try using that somewhere else.

i have never made, or even had chicken and dumplings before. it sounded so good, so i decided to try it. it was okay. it was very easy. the flavor didnt knock my socks off. something about the texture of the dumplings kind of weirds me out. probably won't make again....  **UPDATE**
this is much better the second day. now i like it! and its a good thing, cause i have alot of it!!

I only gave this 4 stars because I did change a few things.  First, I sauted carrots, onion, and celery in butter.  Then I added the chicken, covering it with water AND chicken broth (50/50).  Once the chicken was cooked, I took it out and cut it up into smaller pieces.  I did leave about 3-4 cups of liquid in the pot, put the chicken back in, added two cream of chicken soups, and the cut up biscuit dough.  I did have to thicken it slightly with flour, but it came out wonderfully!

Never made anything like this before. Turned out amazing! I added onion and carrots to the water. Instead of dough, I used bisquix mix and formed let balls.

This Was Awesome - my finace has been bugging me for years to make chicken and dumplings.  While this was far from homemade - he loved it.  I used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken.  Added one cup of water (should have added about three - it was too rich)  and garlic, onions, carrots, and peas.  Used three chicken breast cooked in chicken stock.

This is a nice and tasty dish. I love the simplicity of it. I tried this quite a while ago and I plan on making it for tonight's dinner. If you find you don't have cream of celery soup, cream of chicken will do. I've also tried using chicken breasts instead of thighs and it's still good. Keep in mind though, the five star rating is for the ORIGINAL recipe, not for the substitutions I have made.

I thought this recipe was bland.  I have been testing chicken and dumpling recipes for quite some time, and I have found the chicken has much more flavor if it is cooked in chicken broth with a few added boullion cubes.

I love this recipe, and it's so quick and easy.  I did change a few things like other people suggested.  I used 3-4 whole chicken breasts, and 1 can cream of celery/1 can cream of chicken.  I also boiled the chicken in half water/half chicken broth, and i used the bisquick recipe for dumplings.  My entire family loves this!

Fantastic meal. I took recommendations and added some onion, carrots & celery. My husband couldn't stop eating it. This is an inexpensive tasty meal that we'll be eating often.

This was pretty good, I really like it better made in the oven so the biscuits get a little more done.  Next time, I will just bake them in then oven, since it doesn't take long to do it that way either.

This recipe was helpful as a basic to make chicken and dumplings. I also tweaked the recipe by adding a can of chicken broth, a 16oz bag of mixed vegetables, and egg noodles.  I have never cooked chicken and dumplings before, but this made my first attempt a very successful one.  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.

This is the best recipe I have gotten off this site. I make the following changes. I boil the chicken thighs(and I don't use boneless) in 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water. Also I add baby carrots at this point. When I add the cream of celery I also add canned peas. My boyfriends friends BEG me to make this for them!!!

This is such an easy and tasty recipe that has so many variations.  I have changed to cream of mushroom or chicken.  I have added carrots and celery and peppers.  I just feel there is no way to really get this wrong.  I even tried it with some tomatoes, italian seasonings and sundried tomato biscuits and it was good (not as good as the original, but still tasty).

This isn't quite what I am used to but it was still pretty good and easy.  I took some of the suggestions listed such as cream of chicken soup for one of the cream of celery.  I also used butter flavored biscuits.  Very easy probably will make again.

My kids liked this, but I will stick to my "old fashioned" recipe which really isn't that much more work.  I don't really like "condensed soup" meals & I probably would have liked this more had I purchased a variety with less sodium.

My fiance had been asking me for awhile to make chicken and dumplings for him. I had only had chicken and dumplings out of a can before making this, and didn't really have an opinion about it. But after making this recipe...I am a big fan. It is a perfect meal for a cold night and it is really filling. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I was nervous to make this because it just seemed too simple, but it really is good.  I use cheap biscuit dough, and just cut it into bite sized pieces with my kitchen shears right over the pot.  The only thing I do differently is add garlic powder.  I cannot praise this recipe enough--it's fast and easy and great to have on a chilly night.  Thanks!

This was great! I cooked it a little different though. I mixed in cream of mushroom and cream of chix, then added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and water. Used the chickent thighs and put it all in the crockpot and let it cook for several hours. Then added the biscuit dough and turned it on high for about an hour. It was perfect!

My reason 4 making this recipie is because i usually don't like "dumplings".I followed the advice of others on adding veggies and stock or broth for more flavor.. I think the flavor of the soup is very good.The dumplings were 2 mushy 4 me,but my husband and others aid they were alright.my 2 yr old ate the whole thing while my 7 yr old didn't like much about it.

The flavour wasn't too bad, but the dumplings made from regular pillsbury refrigerated dough still tasted like dough after cooking 30 minutes! We had to take them out. Might try again, but with a homemade biscuit recipe. Coating them in flour and making very small does not work, at least not for me!

I also made this with 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery. I used chicken broth as most of the base cooking stock and Bisquick for the dumplings. Turned out great!

My family loves this EASY and delicious meal and fell in love with it the first time I used it. That was a long time ago but I still get requests for it from my family. So easy you might even feel a little guilty. Fast food meets home cooking. For health reasons I would not normally use canned biscuits but this is great when you're too darn tired or pressed for time. It really is scrumptious!!!!

This was just ok.  Not bad, but not great.  Didn't care too much for the biscuits.  I like to make homemade and they don't take much time.  Its great for a quick meal though.

I avoided making chicken and dumplings after watching my mother make it all by scratch. I saw how quick and easy this was and thought why not. Needless to say we will be using this recipe again. Exellent. I added a cup of frozen mixed veggies and Texas Toast buttered biscuits.

This is the easiest chicken and dumplings recipe I have ever made, and there is no compromise on the flavor.  I followed the suggestions of a previous reviewer and covered the pot for the last few minutes to steam the biscuits. I also added in some potatos, carrots, and celery. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. Great flavor. The only thing was that I had to actually simmer the dumplings for about 13-14 minutes where the recipe calls for 7-8 minutes.

I grew up eating this too!  Only I use the cream of chicken recipe.  Sometimes I use refridgerated biscuits, sometimes bisquick, depends on whats on hand, either way this is a 2 thumbs up easy dinner the whole family loves!

I tried this recipe using the "refrigerated" biscuit dough.  That was definitely a mistake. The biscuit flavor was very commercialized was way too strong for the soup. I would strongly recommend using something besides refrigerated dough.

This was a great base recipe! I like many others, used one can of cream of chicken in place of a can of cream of celery. I also used bisquick. Even using the 98% fat free soups and the heart smart bisquick, this tasted awsome. Definetly a keeper!

My new favorite meal.  My friends weren't happy with the doughy biscuits, but I loved them.  I suppose if you want a less chewy version you could cook the biscuits beforehand, but as long as I'm the one making it, I'll stick to the current method.  Thanks!

It turned out great.  I used a slow cooker for the last part of it because I wanted to make it before company arrived.  I added some more seasoning than the recipe called for- some oregano and a garlic spice blend.

Well, surprise me!  It is much better than I thought. Someone else was looking for a dumpling recipe without eggs and we found this one.  I decided to try it too. It is quite good for what it is, but Granny's homemade chicken and dumplings can't be beat.

I loved this! My 2 year couldn't get enough of this. I used some broth with the water and used the bisquick dumpling recipe(didn't have any canned biscuits). It turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I made it vegetarian style.  I added mock "chicken" (Quorn tenders-which taste a lot like real chicken).  I also added one stalk of celery, carrots, onions and potatoes.  One can of cream of celery is enough.  This was delicious!  I will definitely make again.

I used bone-in, skin-on thighs and got rid of the skin and bones after I boiled them, when I pulled the chicken apart.  Then when I added the celery soups to the broth (it isn't water anymore at this point) I also added a can of sliced new potatos and a can of sliced carrots, both drained.  This tastes just like my mom always made!

This is a great recipe. My husband and 4 year old really liked it!  I did use one can cream of celery and one can cream of chicken with chicken breasts I shredded half way through.  Thanks for the recipe and I will definitely use again!

This was a great recipe.  I also used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery.  I boiled the chicken with Vegeta seasoning.  I cooked the dumplings 8 mins uncovered and another 8 mins covered.  This was so easy and tasty.

I was very impressed with this recipe since it was so good and so easy to make.  Since I don't like celery too much, I used one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery.  Next time I make it, I'm going to be putting some carrots in it too.

I have been making something very close to this for YEARS (I'm getting OLD)except I used "Pillsbury Cresent Rolls" unroll them and cut into bite size pieces. Worked perfect for me. I also did not use canned soup I used Roux and chicken broth or stock with flour. Very quick great idea.

YUMMO!  Not only was this recipe easy, but my kids and husband loved it!  I seasoned my chicken when I boiled it with s & p, onions, celery and thyme.  I also added 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  Very easy and even better than my Mom's!  I'll definately make this one again and again!

I was unimpressed with this as was the entire family.  It lacked any flavor.  I did follow the reccomendation to boil biscuits longer, they were good.  We will not be eating this again.

Being a Southerner, I absolutely loved this recipe.  However, make sure to get a biscuit that you like, because the cheap one I used didn't taste that great.  I'll prolly use the Bisquick next time to make the dumplings.  Definately make sure to put the biscuits in at the beginning an let boil for about 10 minutes before adding anything else to ensure they get done.  I also used cream of potato and poured in a can of mixed veggies at the end.. yummy, yummy!!

I was always taught to simmer dumplings for 10 minutes uncovered, then to simmer 10 minutes covered- without lifting the lid.  Even the buscuit dumplings turn out fine this way.  If you still find them doughy then cut them smaller.

This recipe for chicken and dumplings is fabulous! It was so easy to prepare, but tasted like it was slaved over for hours. I also dropped in the dumplings before the chicken and pieces and let those simmer for about 8 minutes first, the dumplings came out perfect and not doughy. I also added a can of mix vegetables (potatoes, carrots and celery) and that added the extra touch. Thanks for a great recipe, this is a keeper!

Excellent base recipe!  I made the broth and chopped the chicken up, then boiled the chopped biscuits for 10 min in the broth.  I then transferred all ingredients to the crock pot, and we ate it several hours later.

This was great! I also substituted one of the cans of cream of celery with cream of chicken. Very tasty!! The biscuits I used were "butter added", and the "butter" melted into the sauce, which made it richer. I wouldn't suggest that all the time, but it was tasty!! Even my picky 12 year old ate it....and liked it!!

Just like my momma used to make!  I used Cream of Chicken instead of the Celery and added a couple of boullion cubes to the boiling chicken and it came out great!  This is a great recipe as you can add a bunch of vegetables to it, or keep it plain...either way, it tastes great...Thanx again!

Instead of cream of celery soup I used cream of mushroom. I have tried many allrecipes.com recipes and I think this is by far the best dinner recipe I have ever tried!!! It is so easy to make yet tastes like it took hours in the kitchen to cook.  Can you tell I loved this recipe?

Great recipe!  I planned to make this for my husband and I for dinner and we happened to have a friend show up so we invited him to join us.  They both loved it and seemed to have no idea how easy it was to make.  I'd been craving chicken & dumplings for quite a while but wasn't interested in trying to make the dumplings from scratch.  This hit the spot.  Added 1 can crm of chix and 1 can crm of celery, plus veggies as others suggested.  Yum!  The dumplings were still a bit on the gummy side in places so I'll probably cook them even longer before adding the chicken back in next time.

Great recipe!!  The whole family liked it.  I did add mixed veggies.  I used buttermilk bisquits, would not use the same ones again.  I did however put them in before the chicken again.  Overall, definately a keeper!  Thanks

My whole family loved this. I had to substitute butter biscuts because that is all we had at the time. It seemed to make the soup a bit richer. Yum. This is definately a keeper in my home. (I took the advise of other reviewers and let biscuts cook a bit before adding chicken. That worked great. Chicken didn't get stringy and limp and the biscuts cooked perfectly.)

Very tasty.I made this recipe with three large chicken breasts and added some baby carrots (suggestion from previous reviewer). I salted the broth which made the end meal a little salty. Will try next time with little or no salt.

This is a popular request from my cold hungry friends. I have yet to have any complaints only frowns when the pot runs dry.  I give it a four because there is always room for improvement, but it's a five star dish.

I made this recipe twice, the first time it turned out to be a disester, but the second time around it was awesome.  My hubby loved it.  I added corn, peas and green beans to it.  Great basic recipe for chicken and dumplings!

I tried this recipe and it was delicious and easy to make.  I always use my mom's recipe for this but decided to branch out-and I am VERY glad I did!  This recipe is a must try for any mom on the go!

This is a quick, delicious recipe.  I add about a 1/2 lb baby carrots in the last half of the chicken cooking time so there are some veggies in the recipe.  Overall, this is a good dish that is easy to prepare.

got really nasty!  Had to run out to subway.  The dough just wouldn't cook, I used the layerd flaky type..so it was thin flat pieces...didn't work. I ended up cooking it so long that most of the chicken stuck and burnt to the pan! So it all tasted burnt up and was doughy! YUCK!

I added mixed vegetables and used bisquick to make the dumplings.  The dumplings were fabulous.  I used and ice cream scope or melon baller depending on how big I wanted the dumplings to be. I used alot more seasoning bay leaf (to boil the chicken) garlic powder, seasoned salt and black pepper.  You loose alot of the salt by only reserving enough broth to cover the chicken.  You could also just boil the chicken with all of the seasoning and then use plain or low sodium broth to finish the dish.

I substituted 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom and added some onion powder for flavor.  I also rolled the biscuit dough out flat before adding them.  The recipe was fantastic.  My husband loved it.

Wow, this is some good stuff! I've been wanting some chicken and dumplings for a long time, but I don't know how to cook, so I thought I was out of luck... that is, until I found this recipe! This recipe is idiot-proof: it's so easy, even a guy like me can make it! And it comes out really, really good!

I love this recipe except for the canned biscuits.  They make the soup too greasy and add salt.  It came out better when I made my own dumplings for the soup.  I made them out of all-purpose flour and water.

What an easy and yummy dish. I added some peas, carrots, and celery.  I served it with some sweet corn bread-it was a success.  I will be using this recipe more often for the cold winter days ahead of us.

Yay, thank you for posting this recipe that is so simple even I can't mess it up. My husband is a big fan of his mother's version of this dish and I watched as he went back for seconds and thirds. He even gave me a compliment. I did add a little bit of sage and onion powder to this dish and it was perfect. Thanks again.

I also used breasts and boiled them in chicken broth and I threw in a can of vegetable broth that I found in the back of the cupboard.  I also used cream of chicken, mushroom and celery soups.  This was really good and so easy.  Kids were actually fighting over the little bit that was left the next day.  Thanks for this recipe Melissa.

I made this using 4 chicken breasts. Boiled using 1 can chicken broth and water. I used cream of chicken instead of celery. It was on the salty side, but everyone loved it.

This is a hearty, quick and easy meal.  I cook the chicken with fresh garlic, sliced onions and sliced fresh carrots and then put them back in with the soup mixture. It really gives the meal a great flavor  I always pass it on to friends who don't like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  THANKS!

The BEST!!! And very easy. I tore off little pieces of the biscuits and threw them in the broth/soup. It was so awesome! My son was like, "Ma, where's the chicken and dumplings from last night?" I told him, "In your belly, it's gone, honey." Will make double next time!  Thanks!   Erin

This was SO easy and DELICIOUS.  I used half cream of chicken and half cream of mushroom as per previous suggestion, and the soup came out great.  This was so easy that my non-cooking boyfriend is already dreaming up all the lunches he can make for himself using the inventive dumpling idea!!!!!

What an easy recipe.  I too used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups and it tasted good.  I would also suggest cutting the bisquits into small pieces prior to cooking.  It was a big hit for my picky husband.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy and wonderful.  I have never made this before but always wanted to and found this recipe. Like some recommended, I used one cream of mushroom, and one chicken.  I added chopped carrots, celery, and potatoes.  Added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to chicken when boiling and also used two chicken breasts.  Husband raved, it was excellent, must have for comfort food.

Wonderfully easy...I used chicken AND turkey that had been pre-cooked and frozen.  I boiled the meat, then added a can of chicken broth, and proceeded with the instructions in the recipe.  Will use this from now on.

This was great!  Based on the other reviews,I did make my own dumplings.  I'm not sure how a bread based dumpling would taste??

My family loved this soup.  However, the next time I make it I will substitute cream of chicken or mushroom soup for the second can of cream of celery.

I added some chopped frozen veges and the chicken mixture was quite tasty.  I found the texture of the biscuits in the mixture quite repulsive...if I were to do this again, I'd completely cook the chicken and veges and then add the biscuits on top and bake until they were done.

This recipe was good.  I had to substitute cr. mushroom soup for one of the celery soups.  Next time I will follow the recipe to see the difference.  I also made my own dumplings.

I tried this for the first time and it was both easy and delicious. A great introduction to Chicken and Dumplings and my husband loved it.
Thanks for the great recipe, I will make it again.

I can't believe how good this is!  It tastes like you cooked all day to make it.  It is great for a "sunday" meal during the week.  My whole family loved it and I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!
