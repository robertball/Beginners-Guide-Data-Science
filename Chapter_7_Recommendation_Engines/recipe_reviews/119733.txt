Used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and it made a fantastic difference.  Took the dressing from plain to wonderful.

I made this as written, omitting only the celery & using cashews in place of peanuts. This was a terrific salad & we very much enjoyed the dressing. I look forward to trying this again, but using sesame oil as all the other reviewers did. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  Thanks for sharing!!  I used sesame oil also.  I am looking for low cal meals.  Even though I love peanuts I think I will omit them next time as I didn't think they added enough flavor in comparison to the calories they added.  Hec I may even try substituting Splenda for the sugar :o) ***ETA:  The 2nd time, I made the dressing substituting 1/4 cup Splenda for the sugar & it was very good.  I'm not a big Splenda fan but I really could not tell the difference & it saves mega calories.  I also added one teaspoon of soy sauce to the dressing.***
