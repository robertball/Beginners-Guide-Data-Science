I think this is a really good base recipe. First, I doubled the recipe and instead of celery, I used carrot and onion. And because I really wanted some great flavor (we don't like anything bland around here), I substituted one cup of chicken bouillion for one of the cups of milk. I didn't have any canned corn, but I thawed some frozen corn which was perfect. Then I just salt and peppered to taste. I'll make this again.

I agree it is a good basic recipe, quick and easy for a week night meal. I substituted 2 cups broth for 2 of the cups of the milk. I had fresh corn so I used it. Used a little less celery and a little more carrot, just personal preference. A little pepper and it was very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

Quite good.  I didn't have celery or carrots, so I used some ground celery seed (about 1/2-1 tsp).  I used half broth and half milk bc I didn't have enough milk, even for a half batch of the soup.  Turned out very well.  I served in rye bread bowls, which was good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This chowder was amazing. I substituted 2 cups of chicken broth for 2 cups of milk, I also added onion and used celery seed (since I didn't have any celery on hand) garlic-salt and pepper. My family loved it, licked the bowls clean. MMMM MMM GOOD.

I loved this.  Also, added a can or cream corn.  I did what others suggested and went with half milk, half broth.  Also, added a little spice (parsley and thyme) and Johnny's seasoning.  Yum!

Not bad at all, very hearty, but even with s&p it's missing a little something flavor-wise.  The next day it's a little more flavorful (i.e. you can taste the bacon more) but even then, needs something extra.  The only changes I made were to add an onion and an extra carrot instead of the celery, and use cornstarch instead of flour.  Note: it is a potato chowder, not a corn chowder with potatoes in it.

Wonderful, much like I make it, but I don't add the extra veggies.  The canned corn, potatoes and bacon, plus the flour, butter and of course milk.  A little seasoning of salt and pepper, sometimes a pat of butter and all set!  So simple, so comforting, so delicious!!

I found that this barely served 6 adults as a main course and that was adding 3 extra cups (2 cups of chicken broth) of liquid, 1 onion and 2 potatoes.  But the family raved about it.  It was delicous and we all licked the bowls and the pot clean.

Delicious! I felt kind of dumb, because I read the reviews that said "I didn't have any celery," and I thought, "Who doesn't have celery?" Then I went to my fridge, and I didn't have celery. Anyway, I used green bell pepper, and it was good, although I'm sure the taste was different. I also replaced half the milk with chicken broth. This definitely wouldn't feed 8. It fed my husband, one-year old, 3 year old and me with no leftovers. It was delicious, though!

I made this recipe as written.  I was a little disappointed.  It was fine, but not great.  I did feel it needed more salt.

This one's a keeper! Based on previous reviews, I subbed a yellow onion for the celery because that's my preferred flavor. I also made this a one pot dish by frying the bacon in my soup pot and then draining off all but 2 tbsp of the bacon grease. I then sweated the onion and carrots in the grease and added the flour once the onions were translucent. Stir and scrape the bottom for a few minutes then slowly incorporate the liquid: I used half milk and half chicken broth. Came out great and I've only got one pot to wash.

Good basic recipe.  I don't add carrots, I use frozen white corn, more potatoes and  a cup of sour cream and it will be outstanding.

This was so good.  Replaced some milk with broth and deglazed the veggie pan and added it to the chowder so I wouldn't waste all those good juices.  Thanks for sharing!

To describe the fabulosity of this recipe, I  must explain that I'm fully aware that fabulosity is not a word, but it is just so good that it needs its own word invented for it. Seriously, this could be the mother recipe for so many others, it is wonderful! I always try my best to make a recipe exactly as written the first time in order to give it a true test, and even then, few move me to actually write a review. The smoky, thick-cut bacon is perfect, and cooking carrots and celery in the grease with the bay leaf is simply genius, it adds layers of flavor and complexity that would not happen otherwise--a little sweet, a little earthy. The can of corn adds just enough texture and crunch without overdoing it. It really is the perfect combination of flavors and textures, and even better, it's super easy! Simple ingredients combined in a masterful way, this recipe is definitely guest-worthy, and is going to the top of my recipe box. Thanks Kim R. for sharing your magic!

Crowd pleaser; perfect for the onset of autumn!
Changes: I added equal parts celery and carrot, with doubled the amount of chopped sweet onion. Added in 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, splash of liquid smoke and 1 can beef consume.  Rather than whole milk I opted for 2%. I did not use bacon in the soup, but did sauté veggies in bacon grease for flavor while controlling fat/salt content.  I also used one large bag of frozen corn in this double batch. The whole pot was eaten by 7 hungry adults!

I've made this several times, now.  It's a hit every time.  The bacony flavors with the hearty corn and potato- it's just a great combination.  I'd probably make it even more often, because I really enjoy eating it, but it's a lot of work!  All that chopping and peeling and frying and draining before you even get the ingredients in the cooking pot.  Give yourself a lot of prep time and use your biggest pots, because it bubbles up really high.  Twice I've made it for a big party, doubling and tripling the recipe.  It tends to work out best if I make it the day before, store it in tupperware in the fridge overnight, then heat it up in a crock pot in the morning, and leave it on 'keep warm' during the party.   It's thick and satisfying and disappears quickly.

This soup turned out awesome! I did tweak it of course like many others ??. I halved the amount for celery, used two cups chicken broth plus 2 cups milk. I added minced garlic, onion and added pepper. Yum! I did add a little more milk after 10 min of soup simmering as it was getting quite thick.

I used frozen corn from the summer, and made it during the cold winter. I also garnished with cracked pepper, and added onions to the carrot and celery mix. Did the first few steps with the bacon, and veggies, then dumped everything into the crock pot to cook on low all day. It was wonderful served with hand made rolls and a salad. I will do it again.

I used frozen corn (fresh wasn't available and I don't buy cans). My first thought was "WAY too much milk". Wrong. You'll have to judge for yourself, but keep another cup or so handy, especially for day 2. Going to play with the spices more next time, smoked paprika will be a definite plus.

I loved this recipe!  I made a double batch and substituted 1/2 of the milk for chicken stock.  We used fresh from the husk corn and added 4 cups for the double batch.  I also added onion and garlic and sauteed them with the carrots and celery.  My family loved it!  Will be making it again.

I (like others mentioned here) used two cups of chicken broth and two cups of milk rather than four cups of milk. Was a good meal for a snowy night. I'll keep this one.

This was really good. I made a couple of changes.  Instead of 4 cups of milk I added 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of milk.  I used 2 stalks of celery 4 would have been too much and I had one extra potato which I added.  The extra potato was a bit much so I added more liquid (1/2 cup stock, 1/2 milk cup milk).  It was perfect, my family loved it.  This recipe was really easy to make and a total keeper.

There's nothing like a good corn chowder! This went FAST in my house! I served mine with lots of Old Bay and shredded cheddar on top (it's a southern thing i believe) Thanks for the recipe!!

Most recipes will be made as printed the first time, then changed to suit my personal taste when made again. This chowder however, needs no changes or alterations. It is fantastic as printed. The perfect meal on a cold day; or any day for that matter!

Great chowder.  I did add bit of old bay seasoning and left out the carrots.  Recommend to precook the potato and cut into small pieces.  Mine were to bit and I had to pull, microwave a bit and add back..  Great served with a bit of tabasco sauce.

This is a great base recipe and I'm really glad I found it! Ive made this a few times now and have tweaked it to suit my family. I used half the recommended celery and twice the carrots. A little extra bacon is a good idea too. Additionally, I made sure to use whole milk for creamier soup and added 1 wheel of smoked gouda cheese (grated), which makes it ultra thick and creamy with a soft smoked flavor. It definitely needs salt and pepper, but that's to taste. I've also made sure to dice all of the veggies very small, especially the potatoes which take a long time to soften if too large. Something else I do is once everything is in the pot together, I dump it all in a crock and let it finish up on low heat for 2 hours or so. This saves me lots of stirring at the stove.

This was a hit with my family! I made some changes because we have a severe dairy allergy in our house. I added a half of a medium onion, substituted 2.5 cups my own chicken stock for the milk, omitted the butter & flour (there's plenty of bacon fat already, and with no milk I wasn't trying to make a roux) and used 2 cans of creamed corn instead of 1 can whole kernel corn. I also added a little more bacon. Delicious!

Yummy, yummy chowder! Like others, I changed it up because I was way overdue for a trip to the grocery store. No milk, celery or chicken broth to be found in my kitchen. I used canned evaporated milk, a can of cream of chicken soup, skipped any celery flavor at all and added frozen corn which I sauteed in olive oil. I also added garlic and a whole diced sweet onion which I sauteed in that delicious bacon fat.  The end result was a bit sweet, so I added some cayenne, Sriracha and a splash of lemon juice. It was abdolutely delicious and I had only a small bowl for leftovers which broke my heart!!

Didn't have bacon and forgot to add the corn; substituted chicken broth for part of milk. Added a splash of cream on serving. Great for a cold rainy night.

I made it as is except I doubled it.  This is a great way to use up a lot of milk (which is what I was going for).  It needs a lot of salt, and I think that I would use less celery next time.  I didn't try the suggestion to use half milk and half broth but I bet that would add a lot of missing flavor.  It was very hearty.

I reduced the bacon grease to half.
Added a diced yellow onion to the celery, carrots and potatoes, cooking them in the bacon grease all at once.
Once I got the butter/flour/milk cooked I added
1 tablespoon of chicken flavored Better than Bouillon
to it and stirred till blended in.
I  used 3 russet potatoes  cause that's what I had.  I think they cooked faster than red would have cause I didn't really need to simmer long at all. If you do use russets I'd say to check the potatoes so it doesn't over cook.

Simple and delicious... I changed things around just a little bit. I sautéed the carrots and celery in the butter, added a little onion, and then I stirred in the flour and milk. I used two cups of milk and one cup chicken broth and I used frozen corn and a can of creamed corn. I forgot the bay leaf but it was fine with just some salt and pepper. Endless possibilities with this recipe.

So good! I am surprised this doesn't have more reviews. I stuck to the recipe almost completely. We don't like celery so I substituted it with onion and added better than bullion paste to the water. I love this so much that we have made it probably 10 times in the last few months. Play around with the bacon flavors. We used jalapeno bacon and it was really good and added a little spicy kick.  Have also used turkey bacon (just add olive oil when cooking veggies if there intensify grease). Thanks for this awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  We both loved it.  It was chunky with all the great fresh vegetables, and the creaminess of it was right on mark.  All I did differently was to add a chopped onion.  This is going to be great during fall and winter in this house!  Thanks for an easy and great soup recipe.

Yummm. I only use 2 cups of milk and used water. It came out very good. I don't think I will use the full 4 cups b/c it is creamy enough to suit me. Used fresh corn instead since it was on sale and sliced in some baby bellos. I read some reviewers found the recipe was missing some flavor...throw in some green onions, shredded cheese or croutons! I love it with green onions!

Very hearty recipe!  I added onions and decided to saute the potatoes in the bacon grease for a few minutes to absorb some of the bacon goodness.  I used about 6 cups of milk (feeding many, including 2 big guys!) and doubled up the corn for taste.  I used salt, pepper and garlic in saute which was wonderful.  French Baguette to sop up the goodness! Mahalo.

This is a great basic recipe. I changed it a bit to suit my taste a bit more. I omitted the carrot, added half a large yellow onion, diced, and substituted some ham stock for one cup of the milk and added about half a tsp of tarragon. I also added about 3 slices of breakfast ham, diced. Very good.

Not very exciting. Kinda bland. None one in our family really cared for it.

We thought this soup was delicious!  The flavors of the sweet corn and smoky bacon really complement each other well.  I initially used four cups of milk but, when I added sauteed onions and mushrooms, it became more of a stew than a soup.  I added chicken stock until it was the right consistency.  I will absolutely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!
