My husband and I LOVE chicken wings so I knew this had our names written all over it! Plus it was quick and easy to put together for dinner - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I used "No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing" from this site to mix with the bleu cheese. For the sauce I used Frank's Red Hot, butter, and a mix of seasonings for our homemade hot wing sauce vs. salad seasoning mix. I used bagged salad mix and added some cherry tomatoes and croutons for a bit of crunch. Another awesome recipe, Thanks Celeste!

Fast and easy supper!  Everyone enjoyed this, even the kids...it's not too spicy.  Since we're not fans of blue cheese in our house, I substituted ranch and parmesan cheese for the blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  Turned out great.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I absolutely LOVE anything buffalo chicken flavor (Frank's RedHot), and at first I thought I was going to have to create my own Buffalo Chicken Salad recipe, then I saw this one.  In the interest of making this a healthier alternative (it's a salad, after all!), I seasoned three chicken breasts with salt & pepper, then grilled them (I would broil or bake in the winter).  I didn't use any oil or butter.  Then I sliced/shredded it into bite sized pieces.  I wasn't sure if 1/4 c. of Frank's RedHot would be enough to cover the three chicken breasts, but it was the perfect amount - I mixed the Frank's RedHotand the McCormick's seasoning in a large bowl, then added the cut-up cooked chicken and tossed it around.  I had two large salad bowls (2 servings) layered with romaine, chopped tomatoes, celery, and shredded parmesan.  I divided the chicken mixture between the two bowls, then my husband topped his with lite blue cheese dressing, and I used lite ranch.  We both really loved this, and I'll be making it again, and again, and again, and again......

Celeste, this is a keeper!  When my DH says we need to have it again soon, I know!  I had to make my own ranch dressing (Ranch-Style Salad Dressing from this site) because I ran out, and that worked out.  The chicken was so great.  Thank you!

Easy and delicious!  I just used regular bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch mixed with fresh bleu cheese. I also used an "Italian dressing and recipe mix" packet for the seasoning.  The first night we had this my husband and I made wraps with large tortillas, the chicken, ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, and buffalo sauce.  The second night I made a salad with pretty much the same ingredients.  This recipe is definitely one I'll try again and my husband loved it!

Added slivered celery and lots of shredded carrots to my salad blend of red leaf, romaine, and spinach. In the future I will drizzle a little more wing sauce over salad for more spice.  All blue and no ranch.

Excellent salad, this truly deserves more than 5 stars in our book! We had this for dinner last night and couldn't stop eating it. I made as written, but added a few grape tomatoes that I had to use up, and some sliced hard boiled egg. The dressing is great, as I'm not a big fan of blue cheese, but mixed with the ranch it's just wonderful. My boyfriend doesn't like salads much at all, and he went back for seconds. He said if he were to get this in a restaurant he would be pleased. I knew right then that this is a keepper. I could eat this at least once a week and not get tired of it. Thanks Celeste, this one is a real winner. We will definitley make this often :)

This was a PERFECT SALAD.  I used Franks Red Hot Sauce, as that was what I had on hand, ad for the "salad seasoning mix" I used parsley, garlic powder, ad onion powder.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you Celeste!

LOVED THIS! We are blue cheese lovers so we usually just make our own blue cheese dressing. This time we followed the recipe (adding tomatos, colby cheese, crutons, and grilling the chicken) and it was AMAZING. The mixture of the ranch with the blue cheese is perfect with the wing sauce. YUMMMMMMMMMMY! I am going to start doing that every time I make hot wings:-)

We loved this.  I used a bagged lettuce mix from the grocery store instead of chopping the lettuce.  I also didn't have any bleu cheese so I just mixed 1/2 ranch dressing and 1/2 bleu cheese dressing for the salad dressing. This was sooooo easy to make and was on the table in about 15 minutes flat.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

This is an amazingly good salad!  We like it with diced celery and grape tomato halves added.  We used Frank's Red Hot for the hot sauce (our favorite brand) and it was  perfect.  Mixing the blue cheese in with the ranch dressing was genious, so much better than using bottled blue cheese dressing which can sometimes be too strong.  Hubby said this was "awesome", so I will be making this often.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Celeste!!!

Not a bad recipe, but the blue cheese was a little strong for us. Also, I'd put it in a wrap next time.  Just our preference.

Best salad I've ever eaten.  I can't stop making this.  The second time I made it I added some steamed green beans and hard boiled egg slices and some Santa Fe flavored tortilla strips and it came out even  better.  Everyone I serve it too eats seconds and wants the recipe.  Since the chicken is warm this is even great on a snowy winter evening here in the Sierra Nevada.  Thanks for sharing this one Celeste!

If you don't have ranch dressing mix, the recipe for Ranch Dressing and Dip Mix on this website can be used for starters.  I used it to create my own blend for ranch dressing mix, including using dry buttermilk powder to add to it.

This was quite tasty. I actually had a bit of a mishap when I was cooking the chicken. I got the oil too hot and when I put the chicken in it, there was a huge column of FLAMES coming out of the pan!!! I survived it and nothing caught on fire, thankfully! So, I started over. Instead I used some nonstick cooking spray, and a lower heat setting. I added some grated carrots and chopped celery to the salad (because you can't have buffalo wings without carrots and celery) I loved the technique of the chicken, and the dressing was delicious! What a tasty dinner!

this was an awesome salad so fast spicy and delicious ...no need to salt the chicken before cooking between the blue cheese and hot sauce it's salty enough.

Great, we love all the ingredients suggested. When it calls for hot sauce, the only one for us is Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, aka rooster sauce.  It really does make a difference.  You can get at Walmart.  Have used nothing else the last 9 years, when I switched from Texas Pete Hot Sauce.

I really loved the idea of this recipe, but I felt the chicken shouldn't have been cooked in the hot sauce and butter.  I think that just tossing it with the sauce after it cooked might have coated it better.  I also added a hard boiled egg and cherry tomatoes.

Simply to die for.  If you like buffalo chicken wings, this is the salad for you.  I use Frank's for my buffalo sauce.

AWESOME! I had some pre-cooked chicken, so I just shredded it and proceeded with the recipe. Also, sadly, I had to omit the blue cheese, which I love, due to pregnancy, but I can't wait to be able to include it! Hubby, who is a major fan of buffalo chicken wings, but NOT a fan of salad for dinner LOVED this and said he'd gladly eat it again. I also added some shredded cheddar, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. This will definatley be made again and again! Thanks, Celeste, for such an awesome recipe! :)

I used the recipe to make buffalo chicken sandwiches and added provolone cheese and we all loved them and wanted more.  I added a bit of franks hot sauce and let the chicken marinate a bit in it and the chicken was really delicious.  I would recommend  this recipe.

great recipe!!!!! I did alter it a bit though. I cooked the chicken in extra virgin olive oil cause I was out of vegetable oil. I also did not use the salad seasoning mix or bleu cheese. I cooked the chicken in the oil and then threw in most of the hot sauce and butter mixture, I reserved a lil of the mixture to let the chicken soak in after it was cooked while I built my salad. I used hearts of romaine, 1 cut up tomato, about a handful of sliced black olives, mozzerella cheese, and ranch dressing. I made sure my chicken was coated  and used a slotted spoon to scoop out my chicken and put it on my salad... very tasty!!!

Yummy!!  The first thing my husband said, "This is a keeper!"  Didn't have the salad supreme seasoning so I dumped in what I did have (1/2 tbsp ea of montreal steak seasoning/Johnny's garlic spread seasoning)  Will be making this for our upcoming Superbowl party.

We thought we would give this recipe a try, since it came as the ecipe for the day to my email and it looked good. I am glad we did because it was delicious. It was quick and easy to fix, too. We don't do bleu cheese in this house, but ranch did the trick for us. We ate and ate and never said a word, but "mmm, this is good, isn't it?!" Give it a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed. :D

This is a keeper! I made this for my husband and me one night for dinner and he loved it! He likes to try variations on his favorite food (buffalo wings) and this was a very creative idea. We will be adding this to our meal rotation. Thanks for sharing!

We turned these into wraps and my boyfriend loved them. He said I could sell them and to rate them a 5. The reason I am giving them a 4 is because in order for them to be spicy enough for us I needed to coat the chicken pieces with extra hot sauce when they were done cooking. I also added some cayenne pepper (we love heat). I cooked the chicken in some Franks hot buffalo wing sauce instead of the butter and Louisiana hot sauce because I love Franks and the wing sauce already has the added fat. Boyfriend said they are a winner and will definitely want them again. Even said to make them for his kids next weekend during the Super Bowl.

Well, I hate to give this 3 stars, because I made a fatal error in preparing it.  I only used one head of romaine and forgot to half the dressing.  So it turned out with a little too much dressing for my tastes. But that was my fault.  However, despite the mistake on my part, the chicken as prepared according to the recipe was NOT hot and spicy, in fact, I missed the buffalo flavor all around.  1/4 cup hot sauce would not be enough for three chicken breasts.  The entire recipe has potential, but needs tweaking to be a standout.  I also thing some sliced celery and crumbled bacon would be excellent additions.

Buffalo chicken salad had me sold from the get go, but I was really surprised how much difference the salad seasoning mix made. That was incredible! Definitely a keeper.

Delicious. My husband usually orders Buffalo Chicken Salad when we eat out, but is usually disappointed.  Most salads are over-breaded chicken pieces covered in wing sauce on a bed of greens covered in ranch. This is the salad he's been looking for !!!  Don't add extra dressing or spice/sauce and don't cut the amount of romaine.  The flavor was perfect and the romaine really shrinks when you add the warm chicken.  YUM!!

Excellent !!!!!  I'm already planning to make this again… Such an easy and tasty meal that everyone loved.  Winning combination.  I used Frank's RedHot sauce which is my Hubby's favourite addition to just about everything and I grilled the chicken… Thank you Celeste for sharing a great dish.

This was a winner. I even bought the salad seasoning for this dish. (normally I make it on the fly)   Glad I did. Kiddos and husband really liked this one. I added a red bell pepper because I had one on hand. Great addition.

Wonderful salad, we made this while on our camping trip and even cooked the chicken in a cast iron pan on the grill. I did have to make my own ranch dressing up since had none on hand, but love the ranch and blue cheese together.  Really was a quick and easy meal.

This was very good. I did make some changes based on what we had on hand. I didn't have any salad seasoning, so I just liberally seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and omitted the butter. We had Frank's Red Hot, so that's what we used. Also, we didn't have any blue cheese, so I omitted it, but will make sure I have it next time. To up the protein, I added a chopped hard boiled egg. Served with some grape tomatoes on the side. Delicious- will definitely become a summer staple for us. Thanks for sharing!

I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, except I added tomatoes to the lettuce mixture.  This was good but it wasn't anything to write home and tell mom about, in my opinion.  Instead of making salads I did buffalo chicken wraps.

Very good, but I can't get my chicken to look like the chicken in the picture! Very frustrating.

This was surprisingly good - seemed to simple to be this good.  Only change I would make would be to add some tomato, croutons, etc... to the salad.

You know those dinners that just hit the spot?  Right place, right time, easy to come together - the kitchen was transformed into making a nice dinner where my husband would've heated a frozen pizza...  We really enjoyed it!  I made my own blue cheese dressing so I didn't need the ranch style dressing as the recipe indicates.  Served with some sliced bread.  Oh, and added sliced tomatoes to the salad

I cheated and made with frozen chicken nuggets -but the rest was as written- very very good. I made it for a family get together for all ages and laid out the ingredients in "salad bar" style and let the guest's assemble as desired. I will make again.

This was really easy and tasty!  My newly wed husband couldn't get enough of it and kept saying, "You are such a good cook!".  Often chicken breast can get dry and chewy, but these stayed moist.  I didn't add the salad seasoning and I did add some cayenne pepper for some kick...I will definitely make this again!

This was so good! I added croutons and grape tomatoes. I also used buffalo wing sauce in place of the butter and hot sauce. I had some to use up. Yum!!

Love this recipe. I did not have any salad seasoning so I improvised with a pinch of salt, pinch of pepper, pinch of sugar, pinch of paprika, pinch of garlic powder, pinch of onion powder, pinch of parsley flakes, and pinch of all spice. It seems likes a lot but the outcome of all those flavors was incredible.

This was FANTASTIC. Even my kids, who are fairly picky eaters, at it. I skipped the ranch dressing altogether, finding the hot sauce/butter mix was excellent as is. I also didn't have the seasoning so I used a half packet of dry Italian dressing and garlic powder. Awesome. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great salad.  For the hot sauce, I use Frank's original.  I only use 1 tbsp of butter and it still tastes awesome!  I add tomatoes and croutons for some extra color and crunch.

Mmm, Tasty! Followed the recipe but didn't add the bleu cheese (we're not fans of it). Served with warm red pepper biscuts from this site. Thanks for the recipe:)

Heavenly! This was so good, but spicy! (And I can handle heat). My lips were burning for a bit after eating this, but it was worth it! I'll be making this many more times, I'm sure. Thanks, Celeste!

It was Ok.. I've had better.  It needs to have a coating before cooking to make the sauce hold onto the chicken better.

Loved it! Made a few changes for fat/calorie reasons.  Marinated chicken in a little olive oil, sea salt,  cracked pepper,  and the salad seasoning.  I grilled thus outdoors,  cut the chicken into chunks and tossed in the hot sauce. No butter! Topped on a romaine salad with fresh tomatoes and cukes. Used reduced fat blue cheese and reduced fat ranch. Topped mine with red hot pepper flakes to kick the heat up even more. So delicious!  Thanks Celeste! !!

Loved it!  Didn't realize I didn't have any ranch dressing, so I ended up just using the bleu cheese crumbles which was surprisingly enough!  Also used green leaf instead of romaine and added some cucumbers for more crunchiness.

My husband and son both said they would eat this in a restaurant and want more.  Made it with the Louisiana Hot Sauce recipe found for buffalo wings on this site.  Added diced red and green peppers, corn kernels, garbanzo beans and crushed tortilla chips.  Tried to mimic a restaurant salad.  Also added a little hot sauce to the ranch/bleu cheese dressing.  It was an amazing meal and will be added to our rotation!

This is a great salad.  I made a couple of revisions and this was a huge hit....Once mixed all together, I didn't think that it had the orange buffalo look to it so I added Paprika.  I also added some tabasco  (just a few dashes) and I used Red Hot instead of the Louisina.  Definately a keeper..We didn't serve over lettuce, put into a wrap instead.  Huge hit with our customers!

I used crumbled Feta in place of bleu cheese because my kids don't like it.  It turned out great.  Also, increased the amount of hot sauce to give it a little more kick.  A keeper.  Will make again.

This recipe is SO good and easy! It is great to eat as a salad, but also delicious in wraps, pita bread, and my newest discovery- it makes an amazing pizza topping (minus the lettuce). I use the dressing as the pizza sauce. Top it with the chicken cooked exactly as stated, then add some mozzarella (and more blue cheese if you want), and voila! This has become our absolute favorite pizza.  *note: I use the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site.

Awesome! My fiance loves anything that involves hot sauce, so this was definitely up his alley. We aren't huge blue cheese fans, so I used a blend of shredded Italian cheeses instead. This is a definite "make again". Thanks Celeste! :)

Very good. My family and I enjoyed this salad very much. We don't care for blue cheese so I combined fresh grated parmesan cheese with the ranch dressing and it turned out well. Thanks Celeste, good job.

Delicious!  I didn't have any ranch dressing in the house, so I made 'No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing' from AR.  I added the bleu cheese crumbles to mine and Feta cheese crumbles to my DH.  Both of us really enjoyed this salad and the heat the buffalo sauce provided.  I used Frank's® RedHot Original for the hot sauce.  I did add some sliced cucumbers and tomatoes to the salad and served it with bruschetta.  A great salad, Celeste. I know we will be having this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

I love buffalo wings. I knew I had to try this salad. I love it. Who knew healthy could taste so good. I added cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and celery to it. One time I even added Santa Fe seasoned tortilla strips. Each time that I've had this, I've enjoyed it every time. Don't be afraid to add your own twist to it!

I used this as a base recipe, mostly to figure out the right proportion of blue cheese to ranch dressing, which I thought worked well here. We fried the chicken in our deep fryer (obviously not going for "healthy" in this case) but I am sure the original method would work as well.

i mostly used this recipe as a guide for how to make the chicken. we used diced celery and carrots, blue cheese crumbles, and regular blue cheese dressing over chopped romaine hearts. great, filling salad! we served it with whole wheat rolls, but i like the idea of serving it in a wrap too. that's next time! i think i will add tomatoes as well.

Delicious, filling lunch during the work week. I cooked the chicken ahead of time so it would be ready to go during the week. It was easy to throw the rest of the salad together each morning and get out the door. I added chopped onion and tomato and left out the ranch dressing and butter. I thought it still had plenty of flavor that way. Word to the wise - you can buy bottled wing sauce at BW3's (Buffalo Wild Wings) if you have one near your house. The medium sauce is perfect for this recipe.

I loved this! I have gestational diabetes and this was a great way for me to get that buffalo flavor I crave without all the carbs. I cooked the chicken in butter and used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and parsley instead of the seasoning packet. I used a mixed green salad and added fresh veggies including celery and shredded cheese. I topped it with ranch dressing and it was a hit!

Yummy salad. I made this for my lunch. I used already cooked chicken, so in a microwave safe bowl I melted butter then added the hot sauce and the chicken, put the lid on and shook it up until all the chicken was coated in the hot sauce. I dropped the chicken over my greens and ranch. ( I didn't have any blue cheese, but that's ok it was still very good! )

This is so simple and delicious.  I did not have any crumbled blue cheese on hand, so just used bottled blue cheese dressing.  I also added celery and grape tomatoes to the salad.  Was so simple and the leftovers were great the next day for lunch.

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband, an avid buffalo wing eater, loved it. I didn't really enjoy it, but that's not saying much because I don't like them as much as he does. :) Next time I'll probably try a different brand of hot sauce (like Franks). Thank you for a recipe that my husband really enjoyed!

This is definitely a favorite of both my husband and I. We have had it several times and still love it like we did the first time. The only thing we did different was had it as Buffalo Chicken Salad Wraps and they were amazing! We also have had it as just the salad and love it just as much.

Absolutely great!  The only ingredients I added was tomatoes and cucumbers to the salad since we like lots of veggies in our salad.  The chicken was delicious and cooked exactly as recipe directed.  I am not a fan of blue cheese, so I substituted grated parmesan cheese instead for my salad.  My husband had the blue cheese crumbles on his salad and thought it was great.

This turned out great!  The only thing that I changed was to omit the ranch dressing.  We love blue cheese, so we just topped our individual salads with crumbled blue cheese and blue cheese dressing.  Very good, quick recipe.

Loved it! I made it as a cold chicken salad to use up some shredded chicken and it was just what I wanted for a nice light dinner. I'm looking forward to trying it again as a main meal salad not on a sandwich too. Thanks Celeste!

Very good for quick, easy dinner.  I didn't have 'McCormick" but looked up the ingredients for it and had most on hand (paprika, salt, pepper, poppy seeds, garlic powder).  The chicken was delicious!

This was easy to make and how can you go wrong with chicken and hot sauce. I did add some broccoli, red onion, roasted pepper, and Parmesan cheese. The ranch and blue cheese were ideal for this recipe.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. I made this last night. but cut back a little on the chicken because there were only 2 people, but not on anything else. WOW! excellent.

Super easy, super yummy; what's not to love? The only change I made was using blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.

I LOVE buffalo chicken and was super excited about this recipe, but found it rather bland.

I am a big fan of buffalo sauce so this was a big hit with me. My husband loved it but the kids not so much. For me the blue cheese was a bit over powering. Next time I will try a different cheese.

Very good! I'd give the dressing a 5 overall, but the salad only gets 4 because it didn't really remind me of chicken wings which is what I was really craving. I wish I could give it 4.5. :)

Pretty good, we don't care for really hot foods, so I used a mild hot sauce, and omitted the blue cheese. But this was still good, we enjoyed it.

Great salad. My husband is a very picky eater. He loved this salad (& I added extra bleu cheese). I like that the chicken isn't breaded & fried.

This was excellent - it is a little spicy, but I like that. I thought my husband would be unhappy with a salad for dinner, but he really enjoyed this also. Used Ranch Style Dressing from this site per another reviewer's recommendation and it was great.

Very good and easy recipe! Didn't have any blue cheese on hand so just made it without and it was still great. Next time I will definately try it with. Thanks!

This was great! My personal tastes lean toward Frank's Red Hot, so I used it, but this was a seriously good meal. I also added some grape tomatoes and hard cooked eggs. Thanks for the recipe - it's now my go-to chicken salad.
