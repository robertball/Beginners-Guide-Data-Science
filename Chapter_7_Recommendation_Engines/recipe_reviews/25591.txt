This was great. it was so easy to make, and i made it lower fat by adding half the oil, and using applesauce for the other half, and only egg whites. and it still came out great!

This is tasty, and easy to make, but keep an eye on it as it bakes.  The first time I tried it, I baked it at 350 for 37 minutes, and it was overdone along the edges and the bottom.  I tried it again at 340 for 33 minutes, and it was very good.  I topped it with a simple confectioner's sugar/orange juice glaze.

Loved this recipe.  I thought the full one cup of honey AND one cup of sugar would make it too sweet for even me, but the finished product was not too sweet at all.  To me this is textured more like a snack cake or coffee cake (maybe next time add a little steusel topping?!?).  It really needs a cup of coffee with it or a big frosty glass of milk.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar just to make it pretty.  Excellent.

I made cupcakes and they were really good.  They took about 22 minutes and they turned out perfectly. The only thing I did different was that I didn't have any zest.

Such rave reviews on this cake! I did make a bunch of changes though - I halved the recipe, then found out that I didn't have orange juice or oranges. In place of 1 cup of orange juice, I used 1/2 cup of warm instant coffee. In place of the orange zest, I used lemon zest. I'll make this one again and again!

Addendum: I made this according to the directions, and still absolutely wonderful and MOIST.

Moist, good texture, easy to make, but the flavors don't stand out.  It's just okay.  If you decide to try it, make sure you watch the time closely.  I used 9x13 glass baking dish and it was done in 35 minutes at 350.

I am not a big fan of honey cake but for some reason I was craving some but I wanted to keep it a healhty as possible. I found this recipe and modified it a bit and found it to be incredibly moist and delicious.  I halved the recipe because I didn't want too much and put it in my loaf pan.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 stevia and I didn' have any orange zest.  I also used organic raw honey and organic orange juice.  Everything else was the same.  This was easy and fast and very delicious. I can't wait to have some with a cup of tea tonight.  Perfect for afternoon guests too.

Very tasty cake! It turned out great, pretty moist too. I didn't add the orange zest as I didn't have any. Also, I forgot about the oil, and just remembered to add it in the last minute, just before baking (it was corn oil btw)--still turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some orange juice and found this one! Great tasting cake for a luncheon or to drink with tea. It was easy and all the ingredients were in the cupboard!

Changes I made: 1 heaping tsp. of orange marmalade with zest; 1/4 cup oil + 1/4 cup cranberry applesauce, and added an additional 1/4 cup of flour to mix. This worked well. I made another small 6x6 cake along with 9x13" pan with the amount of batter I ended up with, was affraid it would boil over in oven. This was fairly moist. Stayed together well, and iced without crumbling on top. Tip: I think a few dried or fresh rasins would be a good compliment to this cake. Thank you for the recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as given and it worked perfectly! This is a yummy cake that, in texture, is sort of a cross between a coffee cake and a tea bread. The edges get a little chewy like brownies. Mmmmm...

This cake was lovely. Very moist with a lovely flavour. I halve the recipe and cooked in a 8" x 8" pan for 35 mins and the results were fantastic!

This cake is delicious! :) It just came out of the over and my bf and I ate 1/3 of it, without even waiting for it to cool. The honey adds the edges some crunch and makes the middle more chewy - a delightful combination.   Changes I made:  1) only used 1/3 of the sugar, but all the honey 2) only used 2 cups of flour and appropriately reduced the amount of orange juice 3) didn't have oil, so tried using butter, but it was rather hard to incorporate in the liquid part of the recipe, so I only used a minimal amount (maybe 2-3 spoons) 4) increased the amount of orange zest considerably and would increase it even more next time 5) added nuts (pecans) to half  Oh, and mine was done in 40 min. Absolutely delicious and will definitely be making again. :)

Loved this little cake. Plain, simple and great flavor. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8" pan, and sprinkled lightly when finished with cinnamon/sugar.

Just pulled it out of the oven.....had to sneak a piece to try, burning myself in the process.  Very nice orange flavor,with a texture similar to a spice cake (if that makes sense).  I made an orange glaze and dumped it right on fresh out of the oven.  I agree with some of the other reviews I read-this would be a great coffee or tea time cake.  I will probably make this again in the future.

I followed the recipe, but the cake is   bland. I know this is a "simple" cake, but it needs something to jazz it up. Perhaps, an orange or a cream cheese frosting...something. Very disappointing - I will not be making this one again.

This cake is good, but not great. It is VERY sweet and a little plain. My boyfriend and I both thought it would go well with a fruit compote if the cake itself was less sweet. One nice thing about the cake is that the texture actually improved the next day.

This is a good recipe to make with children. I made this with preschoolers and it was easy, delicious and moist. I didn't sift it, just mixed it together. I made muffins instead of cake. It took about 25 min. until a toothpick came out clean.  At first it seemed too moist but it came out fine when cooked long enough.I put extra cinn. in and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon van. I didn't measure the van. Everyone love it. I made it for the Jewish New Year.

Better than expected. I made it for three portions on Ramekins and used fresh OJ. maybe a little too sweet says my wife, and maybe she's right. Other than that, It's worth giving it a try.

Fantastic!! Thank you for sharing! I used a little more honey than the recipe called for and not quite as much sugar, also used brown sugar instead of white, but this was FABULOUS!! My husband and 18mo old son ate it up! Will make again and again! A great breakfast cake for sure! I made some orange glaze to put on top! :D I think this would also go well with frosting, depending on your taste and how sweet you want it! lol! Also, I did not have to bake this quite as long as needed either, only about 30min, otherwise the bottom would have toasted! Highly recommend trying! ENJOY!!

I followed the recipe as directed except I omitted the orange zest (I had no fresh orange on hand). The cake collapsed in the middle during baking (I baked for 40 minutes at 350 but had to cover the top the last ten minutes so it wouldn't get too brown). The cake was moist and definitely not too sweet. You can taste the honey, but it's not overpowering. I do think the orange zest is an important component, since the cake lacked taste without it; it was just a tad too bland for my taste, but it was very easy and quick to make.

I made this for my class of 18 5-7 year old, with leftover cranberry-apple zinger tea instead of orange juice, and it was great!  Made it with half whole wheat and half whole spelt flour, as well as olive oil instead of butter, and all honey because we were out of sugar.  My lead teacher was quite impressed with it!

This turned out great and I could get rid of some old honey out of the closet!  I decided to try using lemon zest instead of orange and it worked out well.  Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe with exception of the zest(didn't have any) and the flour(I used 1cup AP flour, 1cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup coconut flour) and it turned out pretty good. The only problem is I used store bought orange juice so it made the cake a little too sweet for me. (I still ate it though) Next time I will just replace the OJ with milk. This is probably the first time I've baked a cake and it came out good. I will bake this again.

My only alteration was a juiced orange rather than orange juice as I didn't have any on hand. 

The cake came out great, easy to make, and smells and tastes delicious. 

Made two nice size loaves

This recipe is wonderful everytime I make it. The last time I used lemon juice instead and it was truly delicious! The texture isn't as refined as one would like, but it is still incredibly moist and sweet.

Decided to make my first cake from scratch today and thought I'd try this recipe. It was super easy and came out very good! Very moist and flavorful. Though it is missing a little something like nutmeg or perhaps almond extract. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

This cake turned out great for me.  I made it exactly as directed and baked it for 40 minutes.  It was very light and fluffy. I will definitely make this again.  Try it with vanilla frosting..yum.

This cake was a disappointment. While it did have good orange flavor, it was very dense and almost a chewy consistency. It got worse by the second day. I'm guessing it's the honey in it.

This was a hit for our Rosh Hoshanna dinner. The only think I changed was the omitting the oil and substituting applesauce for it. It is a family favorite now. My mother in law hadn't had it since her mother last made it many, many years ago and this brought back all those yummy memories. Thank you for sharing!

I made this for a birthday cake during a vacation bible school that was based in Jesus time.  The kids loved it - both the authenticity (somewhat) and the taste.  We were so excited that the kids got to try something new and different!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

I use this recipe annually for about 6 years now for Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). As such, I make it in a loaf pan and it works perfectly. I've made it in mini loaf pans, individual ones as well, silicone, etc. and all turned out great. 

My changes include using melted butter instead of vegetable oil, I've used tangerine juice, lemon juice, combos of those or cran-apple juice, etc. I also use both lemon and vanilla extracts. I usually skip the zest and use the lemon extract instead (laziness, but I'm sure lemon zest will be better and will do that this year). Basically, anything but orange juice because I'm not a fan and don't keep it around, so I use what I have around. 

Excellent recipe! And I generally don't even like honey cake made commercially because they are always dry and the flavor leaves something to be desired, so that says something. I will voluntarily eat this cake, though! My mom, who loves honey cake, stopped buying it once I started making this recipe, so there's another compliment to the recipe, along with it not lasting very long in the house! Thank you for sharing it with us!

Yes, I use 1/4 cup granny smith applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil (in place of 1/2 cup oil) and 6 ounces orange juice and 2 ounces of double strength coffee (I make a 6 oz cup of coffee and use 2 level teaspoons of instant coffee to make it) in place of the 8 oz of orange juice. Also, since there is so much sodium in the recipe already, I reduce the salt to 1/8 teaspoon instead of 1/2 teaspoon.

I added 1/2 tsp of Fiori Di Sicillia, a citrus vanilla flavor, omitted the cinnamon.
I also used fresh squeezed oranges for juice and rind.
After 20 minutes at 350F it was evenly browned and risen.
I reduced heat to 325F. covered with foil and baked another 20 minutes.
Should have tented foil more carefully as top of cake a wee bit  was removed.
I let cake mellow for 24 hours.
Delightfully moist and yet definitely honey flavorful.
One can make a honey glaze or whipped cream and berries to really make a special dessert.
A keeper for sure

I subbed the orange juice for about 3/4 cup of warm instant coffe and the orange zest for lemon zest like another user and it turned out marvelous. I melted some honey and raspberry jam together for a topping. This is a new favorite of mine!

The first thing I ever baked, was this cake.
I was hanging out at my friends and we made this cake, its was delicious!
We each made a pan, one for my family and one for my friend's.
Ever since I made this cake, I've been on a Baking-Binge!
The cinnamon is just right, and the flavor will make you speechless!

Wonderful taste. Because of the review temperature concerns I just watched it like a hawk and it was wonderful. I baked one 7" round and a 10" round out of one recipe. I took the small one out after 45 minutes at 340 degrees. I used fresh orange juice and zest.

Loved it! Simple and easy to make, although I would recommend cutting the amount of sugar in half and adding a teaspoon of powdered cloves.

I made this for Rosh Hashana and everyone loved it so much I made another one! I had to make a couple changes because I'm in a foreign country and can't always find the ingredients I need: I used self-rising flour and no baking powder.  I also replaced half the honey with sugar because I didn't have enough, and used fresh Irish butter instead of vegetable oil.

I would use just 1/2 cup white sugar next time as it is very sweet. I would also use just 1 teaspoon of orange zest to make it more subtle. Otherwise it's a very moist recipe. I made a dulce de leche whipped cream filling for it.

We had an abundance of oranges that needed to be used, so I came looking for a recipe to use a couple of them.  We didn't want a huge amount of cake, so I cut the recipe in half and used a 8" square pan.  I used fresh-squeezed OJ after getting the zest from one orange, and I added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans because that sounded good.  It turned out well, about 35 minutes of baking time.  Unfortunately, I got impatient so the middle fell a bit.  I put an orange glaze on top (2 tbsp butter, 1/3 c sugar, 2 tbsp OJ) and when I put it on the plates, it disappeared like no other.  My wife was very happy with it, she likes things which use honey as a sweetener, and my boys were very complimentary.  It definitely is a bit more of a coffee cake kind of cake, but it has a good moistness and fluffiness to it.

I followed some other people's recommendations by adding a bit more orange zest.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I think it would have been lacking without it.  As it was, it was good but not great.

Tried to be all slick and make it in smaller loaf pans- use three. Herd my warning. Otherwise you will spend the rest of the evening scraping burnt cake off the floor of your oven instead of eating this delicious cake.

I love the recipe,but added too much cranberry and a whole layer of chocolate and the cake this time got messed up or else this recipe is excellent.
Made this recipe again today as my daughters first birthday is coming up so wanted to gift a few of them to friends.
Please check the cake after 32 minutes,as it browns so quickly after that,mine turned out pretty brown after 39 minutes.the recipe is delicious and definitely a keeper.will be making again and again, the only change I made was use butter instead of oil.

I made this for my best friend's birthday tea, and it was perfect! I made it in a bundt pan, and because I was afraid it might collapse as a bundt, I made a second batch in the form of cupcakes. Everything (bundt and cupcakes) turned out great!

The cake was delicious, not overpoweringly sweet (as you might expect from all that sugar), with a light citrusy taste. What a wonderful recipe!

Make sure you use a big enough pan! My 15" round overflowed (it was like a school science project, very baking-soda-lava-like, fun to watch through the oven window). It also didn't turn out of the well-buttered and floured pan so if presentation is crucial you ought to line the bottom with a circle of parchment. All that said, it was still a huge hit and not a sticky yummy crumb was left. The OJ and powdered sugar glaze that another reviewer recommended was spot on. I absolutely plan on giving this another go.
*************update*****************
Made it again (using a much bigger pan), glazed again with OJ and powdered sugar, to rave reviews. It took close to an hour to bake but the color was fine. Lined the bottom with paper and no problems with removal. Served cold with some honey sweetened yogurt and it was a nice touch. Thanks for such a beautiful recipe.

This gets five stars for flavor. However, for some reason, my cake didn't rise properly and came out as gooey bars - it's happened to me before so it's probably my oven and not the recipe, but I can't rate the texture. I was out of orange juice so I used tropical nectar, it was a great twist.

This recipe was easy to make and I found it works well served with coffee and a drizzle of honey on top. The cinnamon and orange flavors are very nice.

I hate to give low ratings, but something happened with this cake that I'm still trying to figure out.  First, like others have stated, the given cook time is way too long.  I had my cake in for 32 minutes and it was burnt on the edges and some of the top.  Also, the cake came out totally deformed, sunk and shriveled in the middle, and puffed along parts of the sides.  It could have been something I've done, and although the cake itself didn't taste bad, it just didn't suit our tastes.  It did smell lovely while baking though.  Thanks anyway!
