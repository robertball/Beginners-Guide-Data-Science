These little weenies were tasty! It's a nice change from all the other little weenie recipes out there. I was able to assemble these ahead of time for a party. Everyone really liked them and there were none leftover!

It was different from the 'run of the mill' weenie sauces out there. It wasn't bad. If you like orange chicken sesame chicken sweet and sour anything or general tso kinds of Americanized "Chinese" food then this will likely be up your alley. I doubled the recipe and made it for a group of 20 on Super Bowl Sunday and there were lots of leftovers. So its safe to say it just wasn't a favorite of ours. While I probably won't make it again if it were being served somewhere wouldn't pass it up either. Thanks Kari for the interesting addition!
