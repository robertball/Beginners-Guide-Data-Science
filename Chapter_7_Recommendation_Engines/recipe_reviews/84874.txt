This was pretty tangy and a little bit sweet. I used a whole can of olives (20 was about half a can), and instead of dumping 1/2 cup of cheese into the salad, I grated a small amount over each serving (more would have been too rich for me). Because I didn't use as much cheese, I added more salt. I think this would probably be best tossed with greens--especially arugula. Next time, I'll add a few more capers. I'll probably use the dressing for other salads, as well. UPDATE: I made this again and increased the capers, used only 1 lime, omitted the cheese, and tossed it with arugula. Even better! I think the biggest difference was reducing the lime juice--much less puckering, and the salad didn't seem as sweet.

Really easy.  A little tangy but still very good.  Replace the capers with artichokes for a different flavor.

This is a very simple but tasy recipe. I don't like capers, so these were omitted. Instead I used canned artichoke hearts, drained and sliced in half. Delicious!

I had to adjust this recipe becuase I did not have everything on hand, used white wine vinegar and a little lemon juice with the oil added garlic powder and red onion and salt and pepper, skipped the parmesan. It was really good, after it was in the fridge for a day and the avocados were really soft I used it as a sandwich spread, mushed it on a hard kaiser roll with Black Forest Ham, it was excellent. Even my skeptical hubby said it was good.

My mother and I tried this recipe out and, like others I see here, found it to be delicious but intense. As it turns out, neither of us are a big fan of capers so next time we substituted them for 8oz of cheese-filled tortellini to balance the dish. This makes a perfect flavorful side or, add more pasta or chopped chicken and you've got a quick dinner.

We really liked this, however, I used a green olive tampanade from the jar instead of the black. Delicious and thanks!

This makes a great side dish, but I don't think anyone would want to eat more than a small serving because it is very strong.  But it is super tasty.

Just came back to get the recipe again, this  was delicious! Last time I used the California black olives, this time I will try the kalamata olives.

This was a nice, different way to enjoy avocado! I used a mix of kalamata and green olives, in place of regular black olives, which gave this a nice tang. I had to omit the capers b/c I didn't have any, but the olives made up for the lost flavor. I also used white basalmic vinegar in place of regular. I would def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good stuff!  I've made this as is and I've used it as a base for other ideas.
