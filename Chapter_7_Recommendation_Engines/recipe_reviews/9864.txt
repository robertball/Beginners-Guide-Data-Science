THESE ARE SO AWESOME! This is like the best drop sugar cookie recipe! I'm serious, and I know what I am talking about,too...I have this quest for the best ever drop sugar cookie recipe-like Pillsbury, or Betty Crocker, or the already made kind you can buy in just about any grocery store, or Subway cookie-and this may just be the winner! These are awesomeI made these cookies yesterday and they turned out beautifully! And today they are still soft and moist and just as yummy as yesterday! It's not the cakey soft cookie, it's a tasty, chewy, soft, kinda thick sugar cookie (and they look pretty, with a cracked top appearance)! And in my book, thats about as good as you can get! I think that these would work well frosting, too, as long as the frosting is not too sweet, because the cookie is already pretty sweet. No one will believe that you made these yourself! Oh, and don't flatten them before you bake them, just listen to the recipe and they will flatten by themselves, if you don't bake them too long, and if you let them sit for a little bit on the cookie pan. I have no idea why these are not rated at 5 stars right now; I give them ********** ten stars! I encourage any one looking for a scrumptious sugar cookie to definetly try this recipe! I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes, and none compare to this one, they all get hard after cooling down, but these stay soft and moist. These are magnificent cookies, exactly what I was looking for!!!!! Thank you so much, Pam!

This is the recipe I've been looking for! The cookies turned out great- nice and soft! (I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I substituted 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda called for in the recipe.) I also rolled some of them in sugar before baking. I liked it both ways. I will probably try rolling some of them in cinnamon and sugar next time. Also, I may try adding some lemon zest sometime, too. It's such a great recipe to either leave alone, or to work your own variations with. 5 STARS!

They say that if the dough tastes good, so will the cookie!  Took a taste and yep, I knew I'd end up with a good cookie.  These are buttery, light and tender with the characteristic crispiness cream of tartar provides.  I loved 'em.  It's a beautiful and easy dough to work with and does exactly what the recipe says it will.  Delicious just as is, but for Christmas I dipped one half in chocolate ganache and then decorated them with Christmas sprinkles.

These sugar cookies are awesome! The dough is stiff at first, but this recipe is much easier to make with a heavy duty stand mixer. I sifted all the dry ingredients together before adding to the butter/sugar/egg yolk/vanilla mixture. I added the dry ingredients slowly and let the mixer run for quite a while, scraping down the sides of the bowl. I got a nice firm but pliable dough that was easily rolled into little balls. With the cream of tartar, these remind me of my favorite snickerdoodle recipe. The result out of the oven were uniform, beautiful round cookies that were just slighly golden underneath. When they cooled, the edges were delicately crispy and the centers were soft and chewy. I think in order to get these results, it's a good idea to measure the flour by spooning it into the measuring cup and leveling off with the flat back of a knife. Digging the measuring cup into the bag of flour can compact it too densely resulting in a dry dough that is hard to work with.  These cookies looked gorgeous out of the oven and tasted fantastic!

I just made these and they turned out great. I live in Norway and had to make a few substitutions. First off, I've only seen vanilla flavoring, which is blech. So I used a vanilla bean instead. Of course it gives the cookies the little black flecks, but the taste is so much better. I also have never seen cream of tartar here. I know you can use lemon juice or vinegar as a substitute, but I didn't either. I did, however, have a lime in the fridge. I feel like lemons are slightly more acidic, so I used 2 teaspoons of lime juice in place of the cream of tartar. I don't have any kind of electric mixer. So I made these entirely by hand. And when I say hand, I mean hand! The dough is kind of hard to work with using just a spoon. So I literally went hands-in to mix it, as if it was bread dough. But like I said, they turned out great. They were very easy to form into balls for baking.

Wow!  There aren't enough stars on here for this cookie.  This has to be the most perfect sugar cookie I have ever come across.  I followed the recipe exactly and got excellent results.  They come out picture perfect, almost too good looking to eat but absolutely irresistable. I don't think any bakery could compare.

A really good sugar cookie.  The dough was easy to handle & roll.  This reminded me of the sugar cookie dough you can buy pre-made in the refrig. section (only better!).  I think the dough would work well for desserts that call for a sugar cookie base.  I had all the ingred. on hand so a quick & easy cookie to make.

These are amazing. I have never been good at cookies, and these are full proof you can't mess them up. The dough is very easy to handle unlike other sugar cookie doughs. You can bake them right away, and I even make my own date stuffing to put in the center of the cookie. I also rolled them in a cinnamon, sugar coating on the outside, they were fantastic. My husband who never asks for anything twice, is always requesting these. YOU MUST TRY IT......

These were exactly what I wanted.  However, for me, I found that they did need to be flattened, and also they needed to be baked for a few minutes longer than what the recipe stated (and they still came out nice, soft, and chewy).  could just me my oven though.  
i will be using this recipe from now on when I want to make sugar cookies.

I also went over them with a vanilla glaze..in red, white, and blue for 4th of July.
very yummy!

Perfect, delicious and outstanding cookie right here! Seriously, this is one of the best sugar cookies I have ever made or tasted. I chose this recipe because I usually make rolled sugar cookies for the holidays, but I was running out of time, so I needed something quick that I didn't have to frost/decorate. I rolled these into 1 inch balls and rolled in assorted colored sugars & jimmies/sprinkles. They turned out beautiful and were absolutely delicious! These did not last long, and every person that received one of my cookie trays asked me about this recipe. I will use this recipe very often, and I'm already looking forward to making these for Valentines Day. Thank You for sharing!:)

I have made these a few times now. I do add a 1/4 tsp salt to the flour mixture just because I use unsalted butter. I LoVe the texture of these cookies. Even more - I love that they are SO much less time consuming than sugar cookies - no rolling & no tempermental dough. Super easy recipe! If you eat them warm right out of the oven they sort of melt in your mouth. If you let them cool they are like a soft almost chewy sugar cookie. I actually think they are best the 2nd day (even softer). I like them unfrosted. Freeze well. They would make awesome ice cream sandwiches. If your dough is soft after mixing & you bake it that way then they will be a little more flat & crisp, if you like them soft/chewy then pop your dough in the fridge or freezer for a few mins before baking. If dough is cold bake for 11 mins - don't let the edges brown unless you like them crisp.

Delicious! I didn't have cream of tartar on hand, so I followed the advice of another reviewer and subbed 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder for the cream of tartar and the baking soda in the recipe. Worked out perfectly.

If you love Subway sugar cookies, you'll love these! They are SO good! I followed the recipe exactly and did not flatten the cookies. They spread on their own in the oven and I watched carefully for them to "crack." As soon as they did, I took them out and let them cool on the cookie sheets for just a few minutes before transferring to the wire racks to cool. This is truly a delicious sugar cookie. I'm very happy to have found it! :)

These turned out WONDERFUL. WAY better than Publix bakery's sugar cookies -and those are really good! I sprinkled red and blue colored sugar on them for Fourth of July and they not only looked awesome but they tasted great. Perfect texture and right amount of softness. I followed the recipe exactly as is. If you are looking to make killer sugar cookies - this is it! It's now my go-to recipe.

Ok so I made this recipe and wasn't thinking clearly when I read the egg yolk part, and put egg WHITES instead. LOL. Whoops. Thankfully they still turned out great! They are crispy around the edges and soft in the middle!

I made these to donate to a cookie drive for single military members who can't make it home for Christmas.  While the flavor was fantastic (almost like a butter shortbread cookie) and the appearance was beautiful, I was a little disappointed in the dough and the yield.  The dough was rather dry and crumbly, making it difficult to roll into balls.  Next time I think I'll use two yolks and one whole egg instead of just three yolks.  Also, even though I sized these according to the directions, I only got 2-1/2 dozen out of the recipe.  I would have had to make them extremely small to get the 4 dozen the recipe states it should make.

I made these today for hubby and the kids while we decorate the tree. I did modify it just a tad. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. They came out fantastic. The dough was very crumbly which made it difficult but the taste was so tremendous that it was worth the difficulty of working with crumbly dough, lol!

These are really good.  And very simple.  I've made them twice.  I do bake for a little bit less time, or they get crispier than I would like.  Great flavor!  Will make again and again!

These cookies are heavenly. They have a buttery flavor like a softer version of short bread. I have made them plain and with a hint of lemon zest. For those of you who dont have Cream of Tarter: take out the tarter AND the Baking soda and use 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder in their place.

This was a pretty fair recipe.  The cookies turned out nice and soft.  I exchanged 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the same amount of white sugar.  I did think they could have used a little something.  Next batch I will add some cinnamon or maybe some cloves.  Over all these cookies were pretty good!

Mine no more look like the picture on this recipe.  They are only about 1/8 inch high.  I followed the recipe exaclty, letting the butter come to room temperature.  Fresh baking soda and cream of tarter and they flattened out so bad that I'm not going to take them to the work.  Boo hooo.. a waste of 2 cubes of butter :(  Oh well.. we'll eat them but they sure don't look like that beatiful picture.

The best sugar cookie recipe!! The dough was very easy to work with and did not need any "tweeking" and when baked on parchment paper they bake up at bakery quality. Buttery and soft inside with a beautiful cracked top. Perfect. I rolled in raw sugar which wasn't needed but I wanted a sugar coating outside to make them fancier. I won't do again because it made them just a bit too sweet. When I made them again I divided the dough into 4 sections and in each section I added two drops of food coloring and smooshed it into the dough but not kneading it completely so it had a swirled pattern, very pretty. You won't be disappointed in ease, taste and quality of these cookies.

These cookies are amazing! The perfect sugar cookie.  I did though have a little trouble with my dough being too crumbly - I couldn't even form a ball.  I am sure that it was something that I did like too much flour, etc.  I noticed some other people have had this same problem.  I solved it by adding a tablespoon of half & half, a little at a time, til the dough was perfect.  You can also add milk.  Just make sure you add a little at a time!

These cookies deserve 10****stars!  They are that good.  I have made plenty of sugar cookies and these are by far my new favorite.  I did dip my balls in colored sugar for better presentation and let me tell you..I ate 10 in a row!  I cannot wait to dip some in cinnamon/sugar for a snickerdoodle.  Great drop cookie.  Will use over and over and over again.  Oh I did only use 1 cup sugar since I was dipping in sugar.  Didn't want them too sweet.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! Some reviewers said that you need to flatten them but you really SHOULD NOT flatten them.  Just follow the recipe and if you leave them on the pan for awhile after they are out of the oven, they will get flat.  I was a little worried about the dough at first because it was awfully crumbily but the cookies tasted awesome. The crumbily dough is what makes the cookies cracked.  Thank you so much, I wouldn't change a thing!

The overall taste of this sugar cookie was good but not to sweet. Everyone on the reviews recommends you not flatten your cookie. THIS WILL MAKE A RAW CENTER COOKIE. Flatten the cookie!! Also I lke crisp and soft cookies so I let mine bake for 14-15 minutes. To make it sweeter I do recommend rolling your cookies in cinnamon and sugar.

I'm a little disappointed in mine bc they didn't crack.  :o(  I LOVE crackle top cookies, but I guess this batch just wasn't meant to be.  I'm sure it's my issue, though.  I did two things differently than directed:  used margarine (I can't eat butter) and refrigerated the dough because I didn't have time to bake the dough immediately after mixing it.  I think my problem was the refrigeration, so next time I'll start these when I have the time to make from start to finish.  Taste wise, though, these are a nice, soft, chewy sugar cookie--just as advertised!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. I just baked these sugar cookies and am totally blown away! Slightly crunchy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside... They taste way better than the boxed sugar cookie mixes and I am proud to have made these cookies from scratch. I can not wait to share it with my family and friends. It was so easy to make and I will definitely this again!

Well...I live in El Paso, the desert, and my cookies turned out great!  I think the "crumbly" problem with the others is that the batter has to be mixed thoroughly.  I only say that because when I make my pie crust I have the same problem with the "crumbly" stage.....It seems I have to over mix it to get the dough form properly.  I wouldn't add or take away from the recipe.  Oh, I also bake until the cookie cracks...11-12 minutes for me.  Hope that helps!  Happy baking!

Just made these cookies and they are awesome!  I made them exactly as the recipe says and they turned out perfect!  I would not change a thing about this recipe aside from baking the cookies for 12 minutes rather than the 10-11, but everyone's oven is different!  At the 11 minute mark, the cookies were still pale, but at the 12 minute mark they just started to turn golden on top. They are not too sweet, but just sweet enough! I will be making these again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

YUM! I followed another reviews suggestion since I was out of cream of tartar.. I used 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp baking soda.. These cookies are really good. Chewy, Soft and they don't go flat! I hate it when cookies go flat so that they fall apart when you pick them up.. They are firm, yet chewy and soft.. SOO good.. this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious and very soft sugar cookies! The dough was delicious and the cookies were too. My husband loved these cookies! I dipped them halfway in melted chocolate for a cookie exchange and they went over really well.

I have to give these 5 stars for their beautiful appearance, texture(slightly crisp edges, and very tender inside), as well as the ease of the dough to work with.  As far as flavor, as written, where is the salt?  this cookie cannot stand by itself without 3 things: a good vanilla, good quality butter, and 1/2 tsp salt. salt enhances flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp since I use unsalted butter.  This is a very versatile recipe with options of extracts and extras. would like to do these with lemon and vanilla extract, or a bit of grated citrus zests. This made 26 cookies using the large size pampered chef cookie scoop.

Coming from the world's worst baker, these turned out fantastic for me! I did not have cream of tartar so I followed another user's review and used 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp baking soda. Rolled in cinnamon sugar before baking, baked for 12 mins in my oven. I also got 36 perfect cookies instead of 24. THANK YOU PAM for the wonderful recipe!!

Easy and delicious! I don't think I'll ever use another recipe for drop sugar cookies. Even with substituting baking powder and soda for the cream of tartar they were fantastic. I admit I was a little nervous when the dough came together so crumbly (think pie crust) but they turned out perfectly and disappeared quickly.

I love this recipe!  It was so easy and so simple to do.  I followed it exactly and it made such a nice simple cookie that my kids and I both loved.  Even though it appears to be "plain", give it a try.  It really hit the mark for when you're craving a cookie to go with that tall glass of milk!

I was so happy today after baking these because I finally found the sugar recipe I was looking for!  This is exactly the cookie we wanted: little chewy on the outside, soft in the middle and just right on sweetness, not too much that makes you cringe or so little that it begs for frosting.  My husband nodded in approval.  He said all it needs is sprinkled sugar on top next time.  I do suggest you examine your cookies after baking because mine needed a total of about 12 minutes to finish baking.  They were super pale still at 10 minutes.  I also am going to use a tablespoon or something next time to measure because the cookies were slightly off in size from one another.  It's just minor details so no worries really.  The important part is my memory of biting into it not expecting all that much after having made so many other sugar recipes, stopping and saying "omg, this is it!"  Thanks so much Pam!

I just made these cookies. They are delicious buttery, soft and sweet. Almost exactly what I was looking for - and very rare flavoring! This is definitely a recipe worth trying at home, unless you prefer you cookies not to be so sweet. I made the 2 dozens and in the 1st one i left out the baking soda and cream of tartar on accident. It still turned out good though! MAybe even better than with them in. This would be a good way to try it if you rolled out the dough and cut shapes, etc. because it didn't flatten very much during the baking of it. For me this was great...still searching for a cookie exactly like pillsbury ready-to-bake though....suggestions anyone?

The recipe is great as-is, but if you roll the balls of dough in cinnamon and sugar before baking it makes awesome snickerdoodle cookies.  Gotta love a recipe that's versatile.  Oh, and I substituted 1 whole egg for the 3 egg yolks and it worked just .

Super yummy!  We rolled the balls in colored sugar, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  The dough was easy to work with.  We made 1" balls and got 5 dozen cookies.

These cookies were easy and so very good!  In my opinion they need nothing else.  I tried rolling the second half of the batch in sugar or cinnamon sugar and felt it was better without.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

I made these before dinner and my family couldn't stop eating them.  I microwaved some vanilla frosting to make it more like icing and lightly drizzled it over the top as they came out of the oven. Delish!

These cookies are delicious!  My family said they were the best cookies I have ever made. I added vanilla frosting to the top and red sugar crystals for very festive Christmas cookies. They were a big hit. I will make these cookies often! So yummy!!!!

AMAZING! these cookies are wonderful, soft sugar cookies. they are one of the best cookies I have had in a long time. The only thing I would say is that you can omit the cream of tartar if you don't want it to be cracked, and maybe add a little less flour (I had to add an extra egg). Awesome!

These were not soft at all.  The baking soda taste was very overwhelming.  I would cut back on it if you decide to make these ones.  I make very good cookies usually but these were not to my liking.

The batter is delicious but beware of making the dough balls too big! I made this mistake- and had pancake cookies! The dough spreads a LOT so make the balls kind of small. Great tasting just mine are kind of ugly. I will use this recipe in the future.

I doubled this recipe, which worked out fine. My kids love these cookies... buttery and sugary... simple. I'd make them again for them. They are a bit boring for me, but I'm more of a chocolate chip cookie girl myself!

These were very good and easy.  I rolled the dough in colored sugar like one of the other reviewers and was very very pleased.  All 3 kids of varying ages and a picky husband enjoyed these as well.  Will definitley make again.

These were good but a bit too cakelike for our taste.  They just didn't remind me of the "traditional" sugar cookie.  I don't think I will make these again because my family didn't seem to like them very well.

I tried this recipe for the first time to make tea-plate size cookies for a bake sale and they turned out fantastic! For the large cookies, use about 1/4 cup dough per cookie, roll in a ball, do not flatten, and bake 25-30 minutes. Easy to make and The Best!!!

Awesomesauce!!  These are my all time favorite sugar cookies.  At Christmas, we use colored sugar on them.  I love how they stay chewy.  I also won a blue ribbon at our local fair with these.

very simple recipe and they're really good!  the texture of these is 4.5 star...the flavor is a little plain, hence my 4 star rating, but i think some extra vanilla could change that.  i also think next time i'll roll them in sugar before baking to add the "something extra" that these are missing.  thanks!

Delicious cookies!  I made 12 cookies with 1/4 cup of dough each rather than rolling into balls to make oversize cookies and they turned out beautifully.  Delicous, attractive, and the perfect consistency for a sugar cookie.  I think next time I might add some almond extract.

They are soft and they look great.  Sugar cookies are my all-time favorite cookie, but these just lacked flavor to me.  I thought they were much better once I added cinnamon and sugar to the outside.  The cookies flattened out perfectly on their own.  This makes sense since the batter is very heavy on the butter.  Don't overbake.

I made these exactly as written except that I used margarine instead of butter. (It's what I had on hand.) I like my sugar cookies chewy rather than crispy and these turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing, Pam!

Better than store bought cookies!!

I have made some tweaks to the formula.  I have added one extra yolk for added chewiness (I am not normally a yolk fan).  I doubled the vanilla for more flavor.  I did not have cream of tartar so I added an extra half teaspoon for baking soda.  The cookies are great rolled in sugar before baking for a sugar coat.  My husband did not eat any because my son and I ate them all!

Thanks for sharing the formula.

WOW! These are delicious! I am 6 months pregnant and at 10:30pm I had a craving for sugar cookies. Hubby was sleeping so I decided to look for an easy recipe that used ingredients I had on hand. Boy did I hit the jackpot with this one! The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp almond extract in addition to the vanilla. The cookies were in the oven in no time, and took about 12 min to cook. They smelled so yummy and looked so perfect I could hardly wait for them to cool before devouring a few. My dough did look a little crumbly but the cookies were nice and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside - just like from a bakery. You've definitely got to try this recipe!

Excellent ....made as written and refrigerated until I needed it. Used a couple days later as a base for a cookie bar recipe from Giada DeLaurentis. It was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe. I had all ingredients on hand and sure beats buying a roll of sugar cookie dough (as her recipe called for) for almost $4.

These were really simple and REALLY good! I didn't have cream of tartar, so I used a bit more baking soda and some baking powder. My cookies spread a LOT, but they turned out almost like the big sugar cookies you can buy in delis and such.  I especially liked the ones that I rolled in cinnamon-sugar!

These were ok, but didn't wow me like I thought they would based on the reviews. Mine came out flat and tasted very buttery.

NG. Not sweet enough. Also, the cookies didn't look anything like the picture. They stayed in balls.

I've never left a review before.  These are the best sugar cookies ever!  We decorated them to look like Santa.  I will probably never try another sugar cookie recipe again...this is it!

These are AMAZING!!! If you are looking for a SOFT and BUTTERY tasting cookie, look no farther! Thanks for a great recipe! These will be a staple at the Holidays and anytime I need a treat!  * I chilled the dough for 2 days and rolled them cold- no problems. I would be willing to bet this dough could be frozen with much success! Half of the batch I made as directed, 2nd half I dipped half of each ball in colored sugar (dip the top in sugar and lay them on their side to bake)! Excellent!

This is a wonderful recipe!!!  I've never made cookies from scratch and even without the cream of tartar (i'm not in US and it was hard to find/expensive) these turned out amazing!!!  Maybe just because I'm beginner, but after in the oven for 10 minutes i was worried that they were too soft or doughy but after the sit for a few minutes to cool they are perfect!  Don't cook for more than 11 minutes it takes the softness out of them.  These are so good and addicting!

My absolute favorite sugar cookie!  The recipe lends itself to so many variations as well.  Add a bit of cocoa and make them chocolate sugar cookies - fantastic!  Roll the dough in sprinkles for a more festive holiday cookie.  Top with frosting and sprinkles for fun.  These are so so so so good!

Fantastic Cookies!!  This is a nice recipe to have kids help with making the cookies. :-D   It is fun to see the change from balls of dough into beautiful cracked cookies.  They looked and tasted great!!  Thanks for this recipe.

What a delicious cookie.  Rolled in a little cinnamon and sugar before baking and they came out great.  Outside of that, I didn't change a thing.  It was probably my older oven, but I had to keep the cookies in for almost 15 minutes.  I like them a little brown around the edges.  Thanks for the recipe.

Flattened just slightly and rolled in sugar sprinkles.  Delicious!  They did spread out like crazy, though.  Don't put too many on a sheet!

These cookies were super easy and fast to make and tasted great! But.... I used the #2 size scoop from Williams Sonoma and it only made 20 cookies. And I just dropped the first batch, cooked in 10.5 minutes, they came out puffy and delicious (my Hubby's fav) The 2nd batch I rolled by hand then rolled in sugar, cooked in 10.5 minutes, I think they came out a little better. I liked the 2nd batch better, they were sweeter.

Hubby's favorite is plain sugar cookies and requested them today. He loves these cookies! Everyone loves these cookies! Super fast, super easy and absolutely perfect in every way. I can't think of any reason to need another sugar cookie recipe here. We will enjoy these often. Thanks for sharing!!

Very yummy, and quick and easy to make! I made the cookies with whole grain flour and left out the cream of tartar, and they came out great. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the center. My family loves them!
Update:
I have made this recipe countless times, and I would like to provide some adjustments to all of you people who wish or have to substitute some ingredients.
If you don't have baking soda at hand, you may use baking powder. However, the cookies will be a little harder (not so deliciously "crumbly") and won't get the nice "cracked" pattern. Don't overbake waiting for the cracks to develop, they won't show.
I have always used real butter, and the cookies come out great with that. If you use margarine (I used "I Cant' Believe..."), the dough may become very soft, so you may add up to even 1 cup more flour, but use just enough to achieve a soft dough that can be rolled into balls, don't use too much. Let the dough sit for 15 minutes, then make the cookies as usual. They will come out just fine.
Whole grain flour works very well, you may substitute the whole amount.
If you reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, the recipe will still work fine, just be not quite as sweet.
Putting sprinkles on top by dipping the top of the balls into them before baking (in a little bowl or on a plate) makes the cookies look very appealing to kids!
Adding spices, like cinnamon, ginger, or anise, gives a seasonal touch. You can also add 1/2 cup cocoa, the recipe will still work fine.

These are quite good.  For high altitude adjustment, I added an additional 3 T flour and baked an extra 2 minutes (13 minutes total).  They came out perfect.

These cookies came out great! Granted I did have to use a few substitutions. I used 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to replace the 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar and I had to use 1 tsp of baking powder instead of soda. But they came out great anyway! Love these cookies!

Followed recipe exactly except that I rolled the balls in granulated sugar before placing on the cookie sheet. This is a classic sugar cookie recipe with good flavor and texture.

These are exceptionally good!  Fantastic!  I did not have any cream of tartar, so I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1 t baking powder and 3/4 t baking soda instead of the cream of tarter and baking soda called for.  They came out beautifully cracked on top and wonderfully crunchy on the outside with a chewy interior.  As they cool on my counter, I think I'll go eat a few more.

I was really excited about this recipe after reading the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were tasteless.  I realize that I used unsalted butter, maybe this is why.  I feel like the dough needed more moisture and they just lacked something.  They came out oddly shaped also.

These are excellent!  They taste just like a sugar cookie should taste:  light and buttery and sweet!  Love them!  Made per the recipe, thought I opted NOT to flatten w/a knife.  This yielded 38 smallish cookies for me.  I made half *plain* and half I rolled in colored sugar.  The dough was super easy to work with, but I'm def glad I used my KA mixer; this would be a bit of a work out to mix by hand.  TY for a great sugar cookie recipe; I WILL make these again!

I just had to re-edit this because these are so great I wanted to say again.. they are yummy and fool proof.. skip the cream of tartor if you dont have it!!!!!The best sugar cookie recipe ever!  It DOES taste like Subway's cookies.  They are soft, chewy and yummy.  They cook well, and strangely it's hard to over cook them.  I omit the cream of tartar because I didn't have it.. no big deal, just don't flatten them.  These are not "cakey or cumbley".. try this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

OMG!~These are super delish! Just finished them and I couldn't wait til they cooled off to eat one. Very soft and chewy. I don't use butter much. I used Fleishmans Olive oil spread. I never have a problem baking cookies with it. Edit time...I forgot to add that I didn't have cream of tartar so I used a tsp. of lemon juice...fabulous cookie! 2nd edit...As if this cookie couldn't get any better...I managed to do so. I chopped up a handful of M & M's and put them in half of the dough. OMG!! Fantastic and even more moist than before.

This sugar cookie recipe is by far the best one I came across! I followed the directions of the recipe, but made a few slight changes: I didnt have real butter, so I used margarine.(I followed the advice, from another reviewer on here who used it: chilled the cookie dough for 30 mins in the fridge, before baking them. I added more vanilla extract, than what was called for (2 tbs), for more flavor. I mixed it in with the egg yolks. I mixed the dry ingredients well with a spoon once, and then sifted all the dry ingredients once, before adding it to the wet. This made the dough soft & managable, to shape. It also made the cookies turn out tender-soft, and slighty chewy. I rolled the dough in walnut size balls & coated them in white sugar first, before flatting them slightly (with the bottom of a glass cup) on slightly greased, cookie sheets. IF you like your sugar cookies topped with sprinkled sugar, and/or for them to be more flat shaped, than poofy...then do this, before baking them. They were still soft & tender in center, and delicious! I baked them, until the edges were barely slightly golden. They turned out PERFECT! My husband is picky about how his sugar cookies are made, said these were VERY good. He and his buddies, ate them all up! I thought they were the best home-made sugar cookies I made, and I am not even a sugar cookie lover. This recipe is a keeper! (Next time, I think I am going to try lemon extact, in this recipe.)

These sugar cookies are great!  I love them.  I made these with my children this afternoon.  They loved making and eating them.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour, and added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  I found this recipe when I was looking for ways to use up some egg yolks in the fridge.  Glad I found it!

These were the best sugar cookies that I have tasted. I couldn't stop eating them. My father and husband thought that they were great too. I rolled the cookies in pink sugar before baking, and they turned out so pretty. I think that this is the cookie recipe that I will use for my cookie swap this Christmas.

One word of advice: work quickly, because the dough tends to dry out. Maybe try covering dough with wax paper or a damp paper towel in between trays.

This cookie is undeniably GOOD...just not my idea of a traditional sugar cookie. Too cake-like for me. Reminds me of the Pepperige Farm Sugar cookies out the package. I dont like the texture, as in reference to my personal desirable taste for a sugar cookie. Still a good cookie without a doubt, just not the "sugar cookie" taste I was going for. 
Also, make sure to blend well. Does get a bit sticky when trying to form balls, I just put a little flour on my hands and they roll perfectly. Dip in sugar before baking.

This cookie was too greasy and too bland.  If I made it again, I'd add salt and maybe nutmeg, but I think there are better recipes to try.  It was, however, easy to make and bake, and certainly wasn't inedible; the texture is nice.

This is the BEST sugar cookie recipe I've ever found-I wanted to submit it myself but found it was already here!  Instead of using 1 cup of butter I usually use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup butter flavor vegetable shortening.  It makes them so soft and chewy!

Made these cookies yesterday and they were delicious!! I usually like to cut back on the sugar when following a recipe, so I only used 1 cup of sugar. A helpful tip is to NOT bake these on parchment paper. I used the same batch of cookie dough, baked half of it on parchment and the other half on a cookie sheet. You will only get the cracked effect on the cookie sheet. Parchment paper makes a more cakey cookie, and not so chewy. Other than that, my family loved these!! :)

Perfect exactly as written, and have zero suggestions.  

FYI these would have to be very small cookies to yield 4 dozen.  I got just over 2 dozen normal sized cookies.

I don't have cream of tarter - this recipe works fine with the basic substitution of baking powder.  I used 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp soda in place of the soda & cream of tarter called for.

Perfect!!!

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was not only easy but they tasted great. They are the perfectly balanced sugar cookie. I dipped a few in sprinkles and a few in cinnamon sugar and left a few plain and they were all great. My husband and my 3 year old loved them. My favorite thing was that they were soft and they stayed soft but had a little crispiness at the bottom. This recipe is a winner!

While I was skeptical at first, the dough tasted delicious, and the cookies were absolutely fantastic! The cooking time was spot on for me, and while the dough was crumbly, after several seconds of rolling between my hands, it looked perfect. While they were in the oven, it seemed to me like the cookies weren't going to flatten, (even though there was a ton of butter in the recipe), but when they were out cooling for a few minutes, they were the most perfect looking sugar cookies I have ever made. Thank you for this marvelous recipe!

Ok, these cookies are great! I did not have cream of tartar on hand, so this is how you substitute it out of the recipe... Baking powder is merely 2/3 cream of tartar and 1/3 baking soda. SO, if you do not have cream of tartar on hand to make this recipe, use 3/4 tsp baking powder (which gives you 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and 1/4 tsp baking soda), and use 3/4 tsp baking soda (which, added with the 1/4 tsp derived from the baking powder above, gives you the entire 1 tsp of baking soda called for in the recipe). The substitution works great! These cookies are wonderful... buttery, crispy along the edges and chewy and moist in the middle. Delish! Thanks original poster!

These are very good cookies. I agree with the reviews that say the dough balls need to be somewhat flattened. And the dough is very dry and difficult to stir. Sticking my hands in to mix in the flour worked well. Not the best sugar cookies ever. They need some icing or sugar sprinkles to make them sweet enough for my idea of a sugar cookie. I will make them again.

These are my new favorite cookies! I have made these several times now and they turn out great every time. The last time I made them I used margarine instead of butter and I used a heaping tsp of baking powder rather than the soda/cream of tartar combination and they were good as ever! The only thing is the recipe usually only yields about 3 dozen for me rather than 4.

Made it last night. Rolled in cinnamon and sugar mixture. I ended up with 3 dozen instead of 4, but maybe mine were larger. I had to bake them for 15 minutes but they came out perfect! Best cookie recipe I've had yet. #quicklydisappearing!

yummy, yummy and yummy.  I love the simplicity of these cookies.  My cream of tartar was long expired and I wasn't able to find any at the grocery store, so I used the substitution someone else mentioned of 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp baking soda.  These cookies have a slightly crispy exterior but overall are soft and chewy.  Just make sure not to over bake them.  As long as the family likes these as much as I do, I will be adding them to my list of Christmas must-haves.

These are absolutely delicious.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  I am not sure why some folks are finding their cookies to be raw in the middle.  I wouldn't flatten.  It's not necessary if you follow the recipe correctly.  I did allow my eggs to come to room temperature.  Make sure your butter is not too soft.  It should just give a little bit when touched with your finger.  If it's mushy, it will make your cookies flat.  Also, if you over beat the dough it will make for a flat cookie.  Once you've added the flour mixture, just mix until blended.  I did not allow the cookie to sit on the cookie sheet.  I moved them to a cooling rack right away and they look great.  I like rolling them in colored sanding sugar or sprinkles.  So beautiful.  Thank you!!

Beautiful, tasty cookie everytime. My husband loves sugar cookies and these are his favorite. Sometimes for variety I brown half of the butter, (then cool it) for a nice rich taste. Another favorite is to add 1/2 Tsp of Princess Cookie Emulsion... gives it a lovely unique flavor.

Wow!  All the rave reviews on this sugar cookie recipe are 100% accurate.  I am wondering if using only egg yolks makes them so delicious.  Don't know and doesn't really matter.  It's funny, because some people that tried my cookies (that I half-way dipped in melted semi sweet chocolate when cooled) thought I baked a store-bought, refrigerator roll of cookie dough, then added the chocolate to make them appear home made.  When I told them these cookies WERE home made, they were amazed.  Everyone loved them, including me (who now has probably gained weight from eating so many!).  :)

Excellent recipe. Followed it exactly. For me it made 36 perfectly sized cookies. There was a slight bitter aftertaste from the cream of tartar but not enough to take away from the yumminess.

These cookies taste good - however I would put in a little salt, maybe 1/4 teaspoon next time I make them - it might bring out the flavor a little more.  Also, the baking time needs to be about 15 minutes, I made 4 dozen, so they weren't too big, but they did need a little more time in the oven.    I would recommend these.

Great cookie! so flavorful! I have to add that these cookies are ok to flatten and put sugar on top if you desire. the cookies only flatten a bit. I also reccomend using shortening instead of butter (this helps them rise!) other wise GREAT GREAT GREAT cookie!

Love these cookies I did change 2 things though I changed the eggs to 2 egg yokes and 1 whole egg and the vanilla to 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Adding the 1 egg white makes it so that the dough isn't crumbly but the cookies turn out the same. The almond extract gives more flavoring,

YUMMMMY sugar cookies!!!!!! I was initially looking for a "Lofthouse" type thick dense cookie.  Tried a couple recipes then I stumbled on this one.  Mine didn't come out as thick as the photo (I live in high altitude?) but I think I'll be making these every year.  I prefer soft chewy cookies as these are and they stay that way without falling apart.  I didn't change anything with the recipe.

I just made for the second time. Needed 15 minutes at 350, cooked on lightly greased Parchment paper and heavy cooking sheet. Made as directed with ONE exception. I replace cream of tartar with Baking powder.
Perfect, Excellent ... grandkids have helped both time I made these. They love them. *

This recipe was a little eggy tasting, and probably should be cooked about 8min instead of 10min. If you scant the flour (or spoon it instead of scoop it) you can cut the 3 egg yolks to 1 whole egg.

I just made this 20 mins ago and they were amazing. They were soft and moist and delicious! Like others said, the recipe is fail-proof. This is my first time making a recipe from the site and first time baking something (16 yrs old) and they were still good. I had to sub vinegar for the cream of tarter and cake flour for all purpose but everything was fine.

Perfect.  These are the perfect sugar cookie.  I love the buttery richness of this cookie and that itâ€™s not overly sweet.  No need to tweak this recipe.    They are absolutely wonderful.

Delicious, fast and easy.  We added just under 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  A nice addition!  Sprinkled the second pan with cinnamon sugar.  Haven't tried those yet.

Even though I used too much flour and ended up adding icewater (15T) to make the dough cling, they turned out great.  I liked them sweeter, so I dusted them with powdered sugar.  The roofing crew at my house ate them up!

These Sugar Cookies were easy to make, and taste wonderful. After I rolled them into balls, I dropped them in sugar, and that was a pretty good idea. ^^

These are the best sugar cookies.  I've been looking for a sugar cookie recipe that tastes like something you would get from the bakery.  I formed my balls bigger than 'walnut size' and then rolled them in regular sugar.  I may add a little lemon zest next time to give them a slight lemon falvor that some sugar cookies have.

I followed the recipe exactly, but scaled it down to only make 1/3 of the original. These did not flatten down very much at all, and I was left with small poofed up sugar cookies. Maybe that has something to do with scaling the measurements down, next time I will try making a full batch. Still, 4 stars because they taste DELICIOUS! Bottom line: while I did not care for how they looked, I loved how they tasted (and really isn't that what matters)!

An excellent cookie -- slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I needed to bake mine about 1 minute longer than the recipe instructed.  I rolled the dough in colored sugar before baking -- turned out great.

I needed a quick sugar cookie recipe and this is the one I chose. It is very easy and has an excellant taste. I made exactly as directed, except I used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (both pure). I also scooped the dough on to parchment paper lined sheet pans using a #50 scoop. A perfect size cookie and I got 36. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was awesome.  I doubled the ingredients and actually rolled out the dough without any flour (between waxed paper).  I sandwiched the cookies together with butter icing.  I had rave reviews.  Thank you - I have shared this with a few friends and will be making these cookies many times in the future.

I just made these cookies and they are very soft. I like them because they are not too sweet. I didn't have cream of tartar, but the taste was still great. I will try them w/tartar next time to see the difference in the flavor.

Awesome cookies. I tried another recipe before this and it tasted awful. So happy this batch came out so good. I didn't have cream of tartar so replaced it with 3 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.  Perfect Sugar cookie recipe. THANKS

These cookies were delicious! I followed recipe as written. I loved the look and texture of the cook as well. The cookies were soft in the middle but when left over night they became hard. Next time I will try to cook for a shorter time to see if that helps keep them soft.

Great cookies - better than other sugar cookies.  Suggestion: Wet your hands to make the cookies easier.  The dough formed balls easily.

Because others said their dough was too dry/crumbly, I scooped the flour into the measuring cup and leveled with a knife.  My cookies didn't crack, and my dough was way too sticky - I added another 1/8 cup of flour, and still could not roll them.  They are soft, which is what I wanted - but the flavor isn't very rich.  I really don't think they're the best out there - but they are solid.  I'm going to try them again using another reviewer's suggestion of using the dough for snickerdoodles - that may give me the flavor I'm looking for.

Love, love, love these!!!  Very versatile!  I don't think you need to change a thing!  That being said, my friends and family like almond extract in sugar cookies, so I added an additional 1 tsp of almond extract for them.  I also now use this for my snickerdoodle cookies, add 1 TBS of cinnamon to the resipe and roll in cinnamon and sugar before baking (I add Cinnamon chips for some great flavor) and you have a super easy snickerdoole!

I made these for my daughter's dessert in her lunch this week. This recipe was "OK" but not amazing. These are not rich in taste, so if you're looking for that rich sugar cookie taste, look somewhere else.

This is the sugar cookie recipe I've been looking for! I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was not crumbly, and it was easy to form into balls. They turned out crispy and crackled on the outside, and chewy and tender on the inside. We love them. Kudos to Pam for a great recipe.

Great cookies.  Very easy and uses stuff I had on hand.  Made them with the 3 year old, and it wasn't as painful as I had been prepared for!  I rolled some of them in sugar, but I think that they tasted better without.

These are amazing AND simple to make!  I was a bit worried about mixing everything by hand so I do not have a mixer (yet) but they were still great.  While I was adding the dry ingredients, I thought the dough might end up dry but I just kept stirring everything together and it was a perfect consistency.  I even added some food coloring to the wet ingredients make them more festive!    [I did end up with 28 cookies and had to bake each batch for 12-13 minutes so I'm not sure if it was my oven or my lack of knowing how a big walnut is...]

The recipe was great its self, but I wanted to use it for cookie cutters so I played with it a little. I used 1 Cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of icing sugar. I also did not use the tar tar, but supplemented it with an additional 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I then rolled them out (flour your work surface and rolling pin). I also baked them at 350 but only for 7 min.

I liked this recipe!  Quick and easy and made from pantry staples!  This produces a nice, light, crispy cookie.  I decorated some with colored sugar and others with sprinkles.  My batch yielded about 34 cookies.  If I need a sugar cookie, Iâ€™ll make this one again!

So, I just picked myself up off of the floor after making and trying these cookies, and I thought I would join the masses in stating the obvious (to those that have done as I have, and made these angelic morsels of baked good bliss): Best. Sugar. Cookie. Ever. Seriously. Just stop looking. THIS is the recipe you want, and WILL save above all others. My initial attempt at this recipe DID have the following alterations. I found that after adding the sifted (which I recommend, even though its not stated) ingredients in about three batches, the dough was a bit crumbly, so I added aprox. 4 tablespoons of half and half (first dairy I grabbed from my fridge) and it came together gorgeously. I also chose to add 1c. of butterscotch morsels. HEAVENLY. This being said, I think if I had added the dry ingredients a bit more patiently, and let the Kitchen-aid help the flour hydrate, I would not have needed the extra dairy. I shall report back with my findings next time I make these, which I promise you - will be VERY, very VERY soon! And do try them normally, but venture into the world of Butterscotch....they add something magical, I am quite sure if it. ^_^

These are really beautiful looking and delicious, soft cookies. I roll them in granulated sugar to make them extra pretty.  I make them often and follow the recipe exactly.

Excellent sugar cookie! Soft, non-cakey; just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, if you roll it in sugar. These do not need frosting!

The search is finally over...these are by far the best, most flavorful sugar cookie out there.  I added 1/2 t salt because I use unsalted butter and they are amazing.

I've been searching high and low for the perfect recipe for these cookies, and it looks like I've found it!  I flattened the cookie slightly after rolling into balls and put a small amount of sparkling sugar on top.  AMAZING!

These were easily the best sugar cookies I have tried, and they were very simple.  I didnt have butter but I had I cant believe INB. I was worried at first because the dough was crumbly but it did press into balls and make a beautiful cookie.  I would compare these to a pilbsury or the cookies found in the mall.  Something makes these different in a good way than other sugar cookies, very good A+

These are my go to sugar cookie.  I always have the ingredients on hand.  Simple and buttery.  I take them out just before I think I should to make sure they are soft.  They contine to cook for a minute on the cookie sheet. I roll them in colored sugar before baking  (try school or team colors) for bake sales to dress them up for the kiddos.   Always a hit.  Thank You!

Oh my goodness are these amazing... I had to cook mine a couple minutes longer - about 13 total since I did both sheets at the same time. They came out with lightly browned bottoms, gently cracked tops and thick DELICIOUSLY soft centers. Perfect sugar cookie. My hubby is a HUGE sugar cookie fan and he gives a big 'ol thumbs up to this one. I also loved that this recipe is VERY simple, didn't take a whole lot of ingredients and didn't make a big mess compared to a lot of cookie recipes I've made! (And when hubby wants cookies, he wants them NOW so that these didn't have to be refrigerated prior to baking was a huge plus too!) :)

Yummmo!! Reduced the sugar to a scant 1 cup. Also increased the flour by a 1/4 cup.  Did not grease the cookie sheets....No need. I used a cookie scoop and they rose up nicely with a cracked appearance just like the photo. My sons and husband thought they were GREAT!

An excellent sugar cookie recipe! They taste like those delicious cookies they give for samples at your local food stores bakery! I substituted 1 tsp baking power and 3/4 tsp baking soda (and omit the other called for.) I made some plain and rolled some of the cookies dough balls in cinnamon sugar! DELICOUS both ways!!

Hands down the best sugar cookie recipe I have found. The only thing I added is that I rolled the dough balls in sugar before baking. Perfect sweetness and texture. I am finally done looking for a sugar cookie recipe that isn't intended to be iced. Thanks, Pam, for sharing!

These were great.  A simple, easy to make little cookie that disappears quickly whenever I take them somewhere.  I rolled them in red and green colored sugar crystals before baking and they were my to to cookie at Christmas.  For Easter I added a little lemon extract and some lemon zest and rolled them in yellow sugar, and I'm going to use red, white and blue sugar and take them for the  4th of July.

Everyone tries to get this recipe from me and I try to hide it because I don't want the secret to get out. The only change I make is not making round balls. I just grab the dough in golf ball sized "clumps." These are delicious and soft.

Very good! And the best part....very easy! I rolled the dough in green colored sugar (I just put sugar in a zip-lock baggy and put a few drops of green food coloring until it was the perfect green and worked it around until it was well blended) for St. Paddys' day! Looked very nice!

These were amazing!!!! A few hours after the cookies came out of the oven, my family finished them off! The cookies didn't actually crack (with the first tray I waited for them to and they came out burnt) but they were yummy all the same!!!  I got many compliments and pats on the back =)

These sugar cookies were OK, but definitely not the best.  Maybe if I had followed other reviewers's careful instructions, they would have turned out better.  I just threw all the ingredients together in a hurry and the cookies came out dry on the outside and did not have the best flavor.

these were simply wonderful

take them out a little early because if you let them set all the way and brown in the oven they'll harden up.

This recipe looked simple and all the reviews looked positive. So I was so surprised when the cookies turned out to be such a disaster! They looked heavenly when they came out, and I hoped they tasted heavenly also. The texture looked alright but it was actually thin and fluffy. Not a good combination. The bottom tasted like sugar and the rest tasted like pure butter. In short, the cookies were fluffy butter. I actually did not finish cooking the batter, not even my siblings could eat them. I am immensely disappointed and I donâ€™t plan on using another sugar cookie recipe on this site again.

So yummy and easy! I made these with my three year old and he had a great time putting sprinkles on, both before and after baking. They are very tasty and came out just as close to perfect as we could have hoped.

These are delicious and I'm always looking  to use my frozen egg yolks. Check them after the suggested bake time, they look wet but they are probably done.

Wow, these cookies are amazing. My boyfriend already snatched two off the cooling rack :) I didn't have cream of tartar either so I used the substitution a previous review used (from her review: I substituted 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda called for in the recipe.) It worked like magic. Also, for all of you non-bakers out there (like me) 1 cup of butter = 2 sticks. My adjustments: I sprinkled sugar on the top of the cookies before baking (and some I sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon). I also cooked for 12 minutes (the tops looked better and cracked a bit more).

My first time making sugar cookies and they received rave reviews!  My Grandma especially loved them and couldn't stop talking about them, and she's an excellent baker so that means a lot to me.  Next time I think I will roll the balls a tad smaller though.

Very tasty!! Finally, a sugar cookie that is soft and chewy and very easy to make as well. I am pretty new to baking and decided I should maybe learn how -- this was a success for me and I'm excited to share them with my family and friends. Thank you!

This recipe is fab!! I adore these cookies. Easy & delicious. What's not to love? I did however substitute 1 teaspoon of baking powder & 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda. I rolled my dough balls in cinnamon sugar to create a snickerdoodleish cookie. =)

These were delicoius cookies, however the dough was not easy to work with. For whatever reason the dough was crumbly, but if I pinched it and mushed it together they made perfectly acceptable balls. They cooked up beautifully and were really tasty. My husband really liked them. For one batch I rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar before baking...voila: snicker-doodles! I'll make the recipe again but take one of the reviewers advice and add 2 Tbsp of applesauce.

Mmmm! So good! These cookies needed to be cooked for about 15 minutes, but that probably had more to do with my oven than the recipe. Super moist, slightly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! Buttery and flaky makes it the perfect sugar cookie! Don't miss out on such an awesome dessert! Roll the cookie right before cooking in sugar sprinkles and sugar to match the holiday or occasion!

This recipe is great I agree! The only reason the dough would be dry is because you did not continue to mix it! It take awhile to firm up and come together but once it does it is great!  These cookies are really yummie I will be making them often!

This recipe is very easy and has a good taste.  They turn out to be a little crunchy, I think,  unless you eat them all right away.  To make them look pretty and taste yummy, I dipped half of each cookie in melted white chocolate.  They were a hit at my Christmas party!

I love these cookies in fact my whole family does I made 2 batches already and I just got this recipe on the 13 of September 05. I'm a tweeker but this needed nothing added extra except,  maybe changing the extract from time to time you know like lemon, almond,orange etc.

I was in the mood for sugar cookies and this recipe seemed perfect.  I had a lot of fun making it (first time I made cookies from scratch).  I think there was a little too much flour, but that could've been my error.  Otherwise, it's a terrific recipe and I had to stop myself from eating them all.

These turned out soft and just sweet enough. I rolled into balls and then used my cookie stamps on them to fancy them up a little. I used my convection oven at 350, but reduced the time to 8 minutes and they are perfect.

Loved these cookies! I was looking for a different type of sugar cookie ...I love the Sugar Cookie Drops from Lois on this site, they are a total melt-in-your-mouth-type sugar cookie; I love a soft cakey-type sugar cookie with buttercream frosting; but I was looking for a sugar cookie that was lightly crispy on the edges yet somewhat chewy in the center. Bingo! And FAST?! I had this cookie dough completed in the Kitchenaid even before the oven heated to temperature! I tweaked the formula a tiny bit, I added a few drops of almond extract along with the vanilla, and a smidge more salt to my taste ( I am a salt fiend) and I admit I used one stick of unsalted butter and one stick of Imperial margarine..but the results were delicious. I used my ratcheting cookie scoop to portion, and realized after the first tray, I want to make them a wee bit smaller. Did so on the second tray and loved them even more :) Watch your baking time carefully! Just set along the edges (right about the 10 minute mark) remove, let sit on cookie sheet just a couple minutes, then remove to cooling rack. I am looking forward to trying these with lemon extract and maybe a tangy lemon glaze. Thank you for a GREAT recipe!!!

Very sweet, and labor intensive. Don't forget to leave the butter out at room temperature. You only need about 1 3/4 cups of flour, maybe a bit less sugar. Otherwise, a nice basic cookie. I cooked mine for around 19 minutes.

This passed summer I was practicing cooking with my grandma. While looking for recipes, I stumbled upon this. The only thing we added is to roll the dough in sugar before putting it in the oven. They were gone in less than a day! I will definitely be using this again.  It is quick and easy to make! I love them so much! 5 stars from me!

Best soft sugar cookies I've ever made, and so simple! I substituted 2 tsp lemon juice for the cream of tartar, and put the mixture into the dough, then added the flour. It worked beautifully. These cookies lasted a day in our home. And was a small enough batch that I didn't feel I had to half everything and hope it came out right.

Use it for a large fruit pizza crust and it was great. Cooked it for about 13-14 min until it turned light golden and removed it. Let it cool and decorated it. The edges had a slight crunch and the middle was cooked but super soft. My new go to!

Best sugar cookies ever! Excellent recipe as is, I like to add lemon or orange zest I give them a little extra something occasionally. I freeze the dough into balls and almost always have it on hand.

Great sugar cookie! Frosted with vanilla buttercream. If you let the frosting sit overnight on the cookie, they taste like those soft frosted cookies from the store.

I thought these were great! I substituted gf flour due to my daughter's gluten allergy and they were probably the best gf cookies I've had yet. Because the gf flour is s but drier, I did use an extra egg yolk to make the mixture a little bit more moist which I thought turned out really well.

I made 2 batches today. Made them for my diabetic husband and used 1/2  cup +1 TBSP Splenda blend  and zest of one orange (my grandmother always did this to her sugar cookies ;-) ). They turned out wonderful except the first batch I left the cookies in the ball form and they didn't settle down quite like I wanted them, so the next batch I pressed slightly with a fork. Must have been the difference in the sugars. Both batches were wonderful, it was strictly a visual thing. I used a 1/8 cup ice cream type scoop and had 26 cookies in each batch. Carbs came in around 11 per cookie.

YUMMY! I've made a lot of cookies over the years and I can say this is a dang good sugar cookie!  I wanted to sprinkle some sugar on them before baking because this is what I'm used to doing with a sugar cookie but I decided to stick with the recipe as it was my first time trying it. I hate it when reviewers criticize a recipe  and then go on to admit they changed it around! Glad I resisted altering because it did not need it. The flavor is good and if you don't flatten the balls the cookies will not turn out flat. Easy and excellent!

Loved them. I made some bomb cookies with this recipe, and they are so easy I can make them half asleep and get it done :-)))))

I've made these like 3-4 times and they are great every time!!

Best sugar cookie recipe ever.  If you follow the recipe as written, you will get great results.  Like all cookies, these are best within a day.  They lose some of their crisp crust if stored too long, but they will still be better than anything you can get at the store.

This recipe is PERFECT! I used room temperature butter and made sure to beat it with the sugar until it was very light and fluffy (helps with texture). Refrigerated the dough overnight (a couple hours would be sufficient), used a tablespoon scoop, rolled them in a little sugar, baked 11 minutes exactly, let them cool for 5 minutes on the sheet before moving to a rack. Have had to make another batch since I needed them for an event and my family gobbled them up. This is one that is already a favorite.

Wow, Amazing! My previous sugar cookie attempts have been disastrous. Quite possibly because I never have the time or patience to wait for the dough to chill. These were absolutely incredible!! I followed recipe exactly as written (it's only fair when writing a review after all). They were perfect, great flavor, great texture. The second time I substituted brown sugar for the white, since I love brown sugar cookies! Yum!! The texture was a little different (to be expected), and the cracks were not as pronounced but flavor was delicious. I will probably use the original recipe the majority of the time, but the brown sugar makes for a nice change now and then. My family LOVES them either way, and we never have any leftover. Thanks for my new go-to cookie recipe!!

I made this recipe because the first commenter said it was the best sugar drop cookie, and I've got to agree with that individual. 

I substituted 4 tsp of baking powder in place of the baking soda and cream of tartar because I had no cream of tartar. Worked very well!

I think I must have done something wrong- maybe too small of eggs- my dough came out very crumbly, like pie crust that needed more water added to it. I still was able to make balls out of it, but it was work. They still came out fine and taste good. I guess I'm more of a snickerdoodle gal; I missed having the cinnamon and sugar crust! Still, it's a good recipe that I may use again, if I can figure out what I did wrong...

Best sugar cookies I've ever ate! They were a little crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. I'd be interested to see what they taste like with almond extract instead of vanilla?

The flavor was good but the next day they were hard as rocks and had to be dunked in coffee or hot chocolate, not that it was a problem, they were still good. I will make it again down the road. They did end up a bit flat, and they weren't as cracked or as pretty as the picture but they were good.

I needed two tries with this recipe.  The first time, I used chilled butter and tried to combine it with the sugar by hand.  I must have warmed the butter in my hands too much because when I made the first batch, the whole thing melted together.  I tried to refrigerate what was left of the dough, but then used a warm cookie tray.  Big mistake.  I've since learned that I should only use cooled cookie trays, and leave these cookies shaped in a ball.  Don't flatten them or they won't have the fluffy consistency inside.  My second go was much better.  Combined slightly softened butter into the sugar with only my fingertips to avoid warming it too much.  Then I mixed in the egg yolks and vanilla with a silicone spatula/spoon.  Worked like a charm.  Then I also worked in the dry goods a bit at a time until a nice dough ball formed.  It was a bit crumbly in places, but as I worked them into balls, they held together well.  After baking for 11 minutes, the tops were cracked, the bottoms slightly browned and chewy, chewy, chewy on the inside!  I adore this recipe.  I rolled the last batch in cinnamon sugar, and those were yummy too!  
After my 2 batch learning curve, I definitely will be making them again.  By the way...three batches of cookies and I will be lucky to have ten left by tomorrow. My husband and kids are devouring these and calling them the best cookies ever!  Thanks so much for an amazing recipe, and happy holidays to all!

Awesome, great recipe and easy to follow. Cookies turned out perfect! I left one batch in a tad bit longer and got a nice crisp edge. I also added a half more teaspoon of vanilla,  because I love vanilla! Highly recommended recipe!!!

Excellent recipe!  For variety, we added a teaspoon of almond extract, and pressed a whole almond on the top of some of the cookies.  Tasted great like that too.  Those who are Dutch might find adding almond flavoring makes this into a "boeterkoek" cookie.  Similar taste and texture.

My husband's favorite kind of cookie is assist cookies.  On top of that he is extremely picky about the texture and consistency.  These Sugar cookies are amazing. He loves then so much,  I always have the ingredients on hand!

Amazing soft/chewy sugar cookies! They remind me of a smaller version of the ones available at Subway. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I refrigerated the finished dough for about twenty minutes before rolling the dough into balls. It helped them be less sticky, and they still rose and flattened beautifully.

These are fantastic!! Crispy on the outside-soft and chewy on the inside! I was running low on margarine, so I used half margarine and half Crisco. added the flour a little at a time and measured it carefully-and came out with a very soft, not at all dry, dough. I also rolled the balls (which I measured in 1 and 2 TBSP) in sugar before putting on the pan. Take these out of the oven immediately when they are all crackled on top-cool in pan for a few minutes, then move to rack to cool. Best sugar cookie I've ever made!!!

These are awsome. My mom use to make these back in the 60's for my brothers and myself. She would divide the dough and put food color in them. Blue ones was my older brothers, green was my little brothers and red was mine. I made them a couple of weeks ago for the guys at my local coffee shop and they keep asking for more. 

Thanks for the recipe that I had lost over the years, it's great to have it back. 0(* @ *)0

These cookies are awesome!! I took them to work and everybody went crazy over them. I also took this recipe, added a little cinnamon, rolled them in cinnamon/sugar mixture and they made an awesome snickerdoodle everybody loved also. For a quick icing, I took a tub of already made white frosting, popped it in the microwave for about 20 -30 seconds, depending on the consistency you want, and iced them. You can color the icing and/or add sprinkles if you want.

I have been searching for this recipe for years!!! I am a sucker for those soft chewy sugar cookies from the mall, but no matter how many recipes I tried, none could measure up - until now! These were fantastic. Only change I made was in the sugar. I used 1 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I like the rich flavor the brown sugar brought to them. And, as usual I let my vanilla over-run the tsp just a bit. The flavor was to die for. And even two days later these cookies were still just as soft and chewy! Thank you sooo much for the recipe!

I followed the recipe to a T and they came out nicely! I made some of them covered in sugar and others with just sugar on the top (both put on before baking.) I would definitley reccomend rolling them in sugar before baking! I used red sugar for Valentine's Day and they came out so pretty and yummy. You will need to bake it a little longer though. 11-12 minutes probably. You really have to get the timing just right for them to be perfect though. My third tray was perfect ;)

These were so yummy! It was all I could do not to eat them all in one sitting! The dough was VERY sticky, but we managed with lots of flour. My 4 & 6 yr olds helped. I might add just a titch more flour next time and/or refrigerate.

This recipe didn't work.  It was dry and the cookies were like clods.  I had to add milk to the batter and after I did that they were totally amazing, perfect, and chewy.  2 stars for the recipe as written, 10 stars after the milk was added.

I was looking for a go to sugar cookie recipe for my s'more cookies. This hit the nail on the head. They were easy to make...my 11, 5, and 2 year-old helped me so we had a lot of fun in the kitchen. I added a marshmellow stacker baked for additional minute took out and placed a hershey square on it. They were GREAT. Cookies also stayed very fresh in an airtight container. Will be making these time and time again. Thanks so much for sharing.

I just made these cookies and they are amazing.  I will definately make them again.  And so easy! The dough is a little dry so it worked best to mix it together with my fingers at the end.  I also added a little almond extract to it as I think everything tastes better with almond.  I did experiment and flattened some a little and others none and in the end there was no difference so no need to flatten.  I just rolled mine in balls, rolled in sugar and baked.  So simple and so good!

These are really good. The only thing I'm going to change next time is slightly decrease the amount of sugar- they are just a hint too sweet for my taste.

I just made these awesome cookies. I had made another recipe and had 4 leftover egg yolks. I didn't want to throw them out so I looked for recipes using egg yolks. I came across this one and made it since I had all the ingredients on hand. My kids said it was one of the best cookies I've ever made. I used all 4 yolks in it but left everything else exactly as listed on the original recipe. I used an ice cream scoop to make all the cookies uniform in size.  It made 24 cookies about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

I was looking forward to making these as my husband loves sugar cookies, but these are just way too sweet! Not to mention the butter was too overwhelming so the combination was just like baked sugar butter.

I second the opinions of so many before me.  These sugar cookies are awesome.  They're delicate without being crumbly or cakey.  I did not spray my pan as there is enough butter in them that they will not stick.  I was afraid that if I sprayed the pan, that combined with the butter, would make them run.  I rolled them in sugar so that they would have that traditional sugar coating but be sparing as they are very sweet.  I also pressed them down slightly with a glass.  Perhaps next time I will just sprinkle a little sugar on top rather than rolling the entire cookie.  Definitely a keeper!

My 11 yr old grandaughter is learning to bake and wanted to make sugar cookies. I chose this recipe because it was simple and I had the ingredients on hand. They were perfect! Simple and delicious. Buttery tasting, crispy around the edges and soft and chewy in the center. A great recipe! We rolled some in colored sugar and left some plain, both were great. They could also be rolled in sugar and cinnamon or iced. A good sugar cookie without having to chill the dough or roll and cut them out. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My dough was almost like sand and it was crumbling in my hand. Part of the reason was that I softened the butter a little bit. Make sure it's cold. Also, I added cinnamon sugar which makes it ten times better. These tasted good though.

YUM, YUM, YUM! My daughter wanted to make sugar cookies, and our usual recipe calls for shortening, which, of course, we didn't have on hand.  So, we came across these.  Wow...I have always loved my go to recipe (which are rolled sugar cookies), but these will have a new place in our collection. Everyone in the family loved them. Thanks!

This recipe is so much simpler than the rolled version. I did roll the dough balls in colored sugar (see poor-quality photo taken with my phone). The dough scoop I used was big because I only got 25 cookies. They looked beautiful and my boyfriend's friends ate them up. I was looking for something sweeter, so my fault, becuase one reviewer stated that these are not too sweet.

I added lemon zest and rolled in sugar before baking.  My grandma made THE BEST sugar cookie, but never kept a recipe :( I have been trying recipe after recipe and with the lemon, these come very close to my gram's.  Very yummy.

These turned out good! I tried adding small green crystalized sprinkles to make them festive for christmas gifts, and the sugar didnt stick as well as I hoped.. I added them at varies times, like before putting in oven , half way through baking, and then at the endn once they had cracked. I found at the end, immeadiately after they are finished the sugar sits on them best as they will sit in the cracks of the cookie where it is still slightly gooey for the sprinkles to stick! I will use this again, great recipe!

These are great.  So perfect.  They are just soft and chewy enough.  Just what I was looking for.  Only thing I didn't follow exactly was adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla cause well I'm a vanilla girl.

These are PERFECT.  Not sure how anyone could go wrong with these.  One piece of advice - follow the recipe... do not cheap out on the cream of tartar.  Do not use whole eggs instead of just the yolks.  Do not bake them longer than suggested if you want a soft cookie.  

Only change was I added nutmeg and cinnamon to these, and doubled the vanilla, and they are melt in your mouth good!!

I used 1 tsp lemon juice instead of the cream of tartar since I didn't have it.  I followed everything else exactly.  My dough seemed a little crumbly, but that may have been due to the butter (I had to thaw it by letting it sit out and it was still quite firm). The cookies turned out great and were soooo delicious! These are definately worth a try!  My 4 yr old daughter helped me bake these for her class.  We rolled them in different colored sugars. They looked great and tasted great. Thanks for the great recipe.

i made these last night and they were pretty darn good.  Shaped mine like large marshmallows and dipped one end in red sugar sprinkles. Baked for 11 minutes they were perfect Christmas cookies for sharing! And as stated by many others, no need to flatten them.

I made these just as written and they were AWESOME!!! Soft and chewy and delicious. I did roll them in sugar before baking but you don't have to for them to be good. Next time I am going to try them with almond extract as well as the vanilla.

This is a soft yummy sugar cookie!!  I made them by the recipe and they looked cracked just like the picture.  The second batch I sprinkled some sugar on top of dough before baking and it gives it a nice look.  Also tried sprinkling cinnamon just after baking and it tastes great.  I wanted to make these for my sister who is diabetic, so I made a batch substituting the white sugar with Splenda sugar and added a tsp. cinnamon to batter, and some finely chopped walnuts.  She loved them, although I must say they do not look like the ones in the picture though because the Splenda makes the dough not spread the same and it looks more like a small round ball of a cookie.  Taste reminds me of a mexican polverones or hojarascas.  They melt in your mouth!.....  :)

Not sure what I did wrong? I followed the directions exactly... let my butter soften completely before creaming it with the sugar. My dough seemed really crumbly and hard to form the balls. And the cookies spread out way too much to result in a giant super cookie. It still tasted good, but I'm not sure what I did wrong!

I realized I was out of vanilla, so decided to try adding 3 tablespoons of non-dairyfrench vanilla coffee creamer. It worked like a charm! Not a heavy cookie either, which means you can eat more. :) Family showed up, and the cookies seem to disappear as they left to go home. Luckily there was plenty to go around.

This was not the best sugar cookies I had. When I prepared the dough, it came out great, but after baking cookies it was too breadlike for me. Good combination of ingredients, but I did not like taste and texture afterwards.

By far the best sugar cookies ever! I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies came out so beautifully they looked ready for a photo shoot. Everyone loved them, I gave them out to neighbors and friends for holiday gifts. Sprinkle them while hot with a little colored sugar if you want it to stick! Love this recipe, thank you for sharing!

These were so good! The dough tastes as good as the cookies...The only thing I did different was substitute half the ap flour for freshly ground white wheat.  Can't wait to try them with whole wheat pastry flour!

Really great recipe. Although i like my sugar cookies less buttery and more sweet. (my sister said the opposite- and that they were a little sweet for her, so i guess its just a matter of taste! all in all i will use this recipe again!

My kids adore these cookies. I didnt have butter so I used margerine sticks and I let them and the eggs sit out all night to become room temp. They came out light and fluffy almost like tea cakes it lost a star becuase I taste the baking soda in it It could just be me though!!

This cookies are good. I think i over baked them because they did not have a soft center. They tasted like chocolate chip cookies whithout the chocolate, which is good. They did crack which made them look really nice. Thanks for the recipe! The dough to this recipe is amazing! It is the best cookie dough I've ever tasted! Personally, i think the cookie dough is better than the cookie... Definitely double the batch, especially if you like cookie dough!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):):):):):):)

AMAZING sugar cookies. I cooked them for 9 minutes (I like them really soft and slightly under-baked) and they came out perfectly. They tasted amazing and were delicious.

These did not turn out well for me. I followed the recipe perfectly, but they came out WAY too dense and hard. Kind of an odd flavor, too. Not pleasant in the slightest. Massive disappointment.

These just came out of the oven and I just had to try them.  These are very delicious and super quick to put together. I was a little nervous when making the dough because it was extremely crumbly but once I worked it around in my hands it became like most cookie doughs.  This is definitely a keeper!

Awesome.  Since I did not have any cream of tartar, I took a tip from Susiehomeaker and used 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda.  These cookies are firm on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, and perfect!

I agree that the cookies were good but a little bland.  Next time I will add salt as well to make the flavor pop.

These are great! I am new to baking desserts so i was really really nervous. Normally i would buy the package and just add eggs and water. These are really quick and easy to make and they taste great.

I made some changes to this fab recipe. First I used just under a cup of veggie shortening instead of butter, peeled and pureed and apple instead of the egg yolks and added a couple tbs of water. This is a delicious vegan option for these sugar cookies or even if you're just looking to cut out the cholesterol. The baking time may need to be increase a minute or two. Enjoy!

These cookies are perfect! (I did add 1/4 tsp almond extract, just because we love the taste.)  

I tried them three different ways based on the reviews I read. One cookie sheet just like the recipe, rolled and not dipped in anything.  The second sheet with them rolled in sugar and pressed down more flat.  The third sheet with them rolled in sugar and *not* pressed down.  The cookies baked identically whether they were pressed down flat or not-meaning they had the same chewy consistency, and took the same (14 minutes) to cook.  However, the cookies that weren't pressed down flat first had more of the crackling on top, when they were done cooking.  I don't think rolling them in sugar is really necessary either.  They were just as good without it.  Bottom line- I think the recipe is good as is. :-)

Followed the recipe & dough was not crumbly.  I dipped cookie dough ball into crystal sugar before putting on cookie sheet, didn't flatten them before baking and they turned out perfect. Am not sure that cookie sheets need to be greased, tried it both ways and they turned out about the same. My only issue is what to do with all these egg whites....  angel food cake maybe?

This cookies turned out great!  I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I used another reviewer's recommendation and substituted 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda called for in the recipe.  That turned out fine!  I also only had 1/2 cup of butter, so I substituted 1/2 cup vegetable oil for the other stick of butter.  Still worked great!  I added in green food coloring for St. Patrick's Day, and the cookies turned out a delightful shade of green.  Definitely going to make these again!

I was afraid at first about these cookies. My dough was really brittle, and I'm sure it was because I did not use any cream of tartar (didn't have any). Even without it, they are soooooooo good. Thank you so much. Usually my sugar cookies come out like biscuits!

These cookies were tasty, though I didn't think they were anything out of the ordinary. Mine got a bit hard and dry, but I think that's because I didn't roll them big enough (I never know how big walnut-sized is) so I'm going to try them again a bit larger before deciding for sure if this is a keeper. If nothing else, I'm definitely going to try them rolled in cinnamon sugar like some reviewers have suggested! I was curious about how some people wound up with sticky dough and others wound up with crumbly. I made a point of gently spooning the flour into the measuring cup and leveling WITHOUT packing it down. Using this method, I actually had to add a little extra to make the dough less sticky. Be careful that you're not just dipping the measuring cup in the flour and leveling off, because you'll get too much flour that way.

Great cookies!  I didn't have cream of tartar, so I just used 2 tsp of baking powder and no baking soda.  They turned out perfect!

These were great! Nice and chewy. I made some that were small, and some that were really large, and it didn't matter the size of the cookie, they all turned out delicious! The only substitution I made was I used white vinegar instead of cream of tartar.

Disappointing. Tasted more like flour cookies than sugar cookies. The reviews were so good I wrote it right into a recipe card for my box before trying it...glad I wrote it in pencil. I'll keep looking.

I scaled the recipe down to 16 servings so that it used 2 egg yolks, and the cookies came out great!  Three days later and the cookies still are pretty good (but super good when they are right out of the oven).  I followed the recipe and the cookies came out just like in the photo.  The one interesting thing was that I'm not sure if it's just my oven, but to get the cookies to slightly brown, I actually had to leave them in the oven for 5-7 minutes longer than what is stated in the recipe.

Excellent!  My son calls then addicting and he's very picky.  Wonderfully chewy with a slightly crisp outer layer.  We "experimented" with half the batch and dipped the top in sprinkles before cooking - still yummy.

These came out perferfectly! Mine flattened quite a bit and I had to cook about 2-3 minutes longer than the instructions, but I used light colored no-stick cookie sheets so that's probably why. I might chill the dough next time, because I like my sugar cookies to stay fluffy like the picture! But that's all the technique... the taste was spot on! The dough was also delicious. ;) Thanks!

Easy and yummy! Baked perfect, even in my unreliable oven.  These cookies are chewy, buttery and delicious!  Follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great!  I made them big and medium sized and both good with only a minute difference in time.

I'm kind of surprised that this recipe has gotten such high reviews.  I can see that it could be quite good with modifications, but as written it has some serious problems.  I live in Kansas, so I'm not super high or super dry.  That said, I doubled this recipe and even leaving out one cup of flour, it produced a VERY dry and crumbly dough.  It was nearly impossible to press the dough into balls, but I did what I could and baked a sheet.  They tasted decent, but were definitely too dry.  With the remaining dough, I slowly mixed in enough milk to create a workable dough and tried again with much better results.  In the future I'll try using whole eggs, cutting back on flour and will add 1/4 tsp. of salt.  Also, just because of personal preference, I'll likely halve the cream of tartar.  I think it adds a good flavor, but is just too strong as written (to my taste anyway).

This recipe was so simple and easy!  I read a review about substituting baking soda and powder for the cream of tartar (since I didn't have any) and they turned out wonderfully, although they didn't make a real good dough so I couldn't roll into balls. But I dropped it by the spoonful and they were perfect looking and tasting!  Sprinkled some sugar on top before I popped them in the oven and bingo...great recipe!!!

These cookies are really good!  They taste like I bought them from a bakery.  They are soft and chewy, and my husband and five kids love them.  The only thing I did differently was add one teaspoon of lemon extract along with the vanilla extract.

Outstanding recipe!  I even made the mistake of putting 1 teaspoon instead of 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar and they still turned out perfect. I als recommend not to flatten the cookie, they will flatten on their own.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing recipe! I enjoyed it more than the one I grew up on (which I didn't think would happen). I mainly used this recipe solely because I had the right amount of egg yolks remaining from a different recipe I made that day.

I did the recipe exactly.  For whatever reason, they were turning out kind of puffy and not cracking.  I added more sugar and flattened  them a bit, then they came out PERFECT.  I keep thinking that maybe I didn't measure right since there are so many 5 star reviews.   11 minutes was perfect for them.

This was a great, easy and fast recipe.  I always use cane juice crystals for the sugar and whole spelt flour to make them a bit healthier.  They turned out great!  My husband actually had 3 and wanted more!  My 6 year old sprinkled sugar on the top when they were hot and they looked great.  I think I will try to roll them out next time and cut into shapes.  Will let you know how that turns out!

These taste good, no complaints there. But the dough was very crumbly, and had to be packed into balls. Once on the sheet, they didn't spread at all; I put two pans in and cooked one for 13 minutes and the other for 16...they still didn't spread out, and look just like they went in. Not sure where I went wrong; I added a little extra vanilla, and used 3/4 c of Splenda and 3/4 c sugar...maybe that was it?

I just finished making these cookies.  First ...very easy recipe.  The only thing I had to buy was the cream of tarter.  Before putting the cookies in the oven I actually let the dough sit in the fridge for a few minutes.  The cookies came out pretty looking .....unfortunately they were not sweet enough.  After I cooked the second batch I sprinkled some sugar on top to help with the sweetness.  Next time I will add additional sugar and maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Other than that ...this is a great recipe.

This recipe was really easy (considering I am only a beginner), and I made them with my friend, and our families loved them and wanted to know the recipe!! I will definitely use this recipe again! I didn't change a thing, but I only put them on 340 degrees F because the oven we used goes up in increments of 20. Thanks! :)

I have made a lot of versions of sugar cookies, but my first time making cracked sugar cookies - it's unanimous!  Everyone in my family agrees these are by far the best sugar cookie ever!   And so easy to make.

This is a great,easy sugar cookie made just as the recipe is. I made the original recipe and baked a dozen this way, then I rolled some in ground pecans;the next in sugar/ cinnamon;mixed the cin/sugar and pecans - rolled a few of the balls in this and mixed the last of the pecan mix into the last of the dough and WOW these were the best! Thanks for a great recipe I'll use again and again!

It's true.  These things are freakishly delicious.  I know you're supposed to use unsalted butter in baking, but I never do and I didn't this time either.  If you don't like the salty/sweet combo, I'd recommend unsalted because you can really taste the salt.  I love them with salted butter, though, and wouldn't change a single thing about the recipe!  SO good it's ridiculous!

What a fun cookie for kids to make (and their parents to scarf down!).  Both my 10 and 8 year old boys have made this recipe by themselves with instruction from me.  Turns out the same every time - delicious, which leads me to believe you can't really mess this one up.  This is one for my recipe box.  :D

I added about a half cup of sliced almonds to this recipe.. I am a known exaggerator, that is no secret. As such many things which do not truly fall into the "best in the world category" seem to land there when I describe them. But if there ever was a difference between my best ever and the REAL best ever categories, these cookies would fall into the latter. They are seriously heavenly. I put a plate down in front of my men and they couldn't stop eating them..

Excellent!  Not too sweet but not too plain either.  Followed the recipe to the letter and mixed M&Ms in at the end.  The dough seemed dry at first but it worked out great.  The cookies were still pretty white when I took them out but they were definitely not raw in the middle.  Perfectly crispy and soft!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are fantastic cookies.  I received some ground vanilla beans as a present, from Germany. So, I decided to toss about 1T into the flour.  The taste of vanilla extract and the beans is unbeatable. They bake up beautifully and the texture is crispy chewy on the outside and soft chewy on the inside.  Everyone loves these and they are gone in no time.

These are what cookie dreams are made of!  I made these to freeze for Christmas and my family ate nearly all of them!  I will have to make more and hide them to make it to Christmas cookie tins.

This was a very good recipe. Everyone loved these cookies! The batter was a little dry so I had to pack the dough to make the walnut sizeds balls to bake. I also rolled the cookies in sugar before baking, which turned out well. I will be making these again for Christmas time!

I'm not sure what happened, but this really didn't work out with us. The cookies puffed up so much that they all melded together, and after they cooled they were really crispy and falling apart. We tried making the next round with smaller balls of dough, but to no avail. Overall, the taste is good, but it made very few, large, crispy cookies.

This recipe was great, probably the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever made. It was so simple. Except I got a little plate of sugar and flattened the balls of dough ever so slightly, and dipped them in the sugar so it was like pixie dust... haha but even without the pixie dust it would be really good.

I thought these were not soft at all, and although I used a mat that keeps from burning, mine were brown on the bottom, and I never burn cookies!  Maybe I cooked them a tad too long, so if you make them, be careful!

I love that these are a yummy sugar cookie that you dont have to chill, roll, cut, and decorate. They ended up tasting a lot like the slice and bake cookies. My husband couldn't get enough of them. Thanks for a great EASY recipe.

These are very simple, yet delicious cookies, that can be made in a hurry. When we made them, we didn't have flour or white sugar, so you can use brown sugar, and we used cake flour, which works very well.

I have tried different recipes trying to find a sugar cook that doesn't get hard within a day of cooking and these were perfect they stayed soft where needed and tasted good even the day after making. I see myself making these cookies often.

My 13 year old son found this recipe and made them himself.  He did not cream together the sugar and butter first, but they still turned out perfectly.  Soft and delicious.  They melt in your mouth!

Great recipe and will be my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on. I didn't have cream of tartar so I followed another review and used half baking powder and half baking soda. I made these for Easter so I rolled in pastel colored  sugar for a little decoration and they came out great! Cracked on the top and moist and chewy on the inside.

Yummy!  I didn't have cream of tartar so I used 4 tspns. of baking powder and eliminated the baking soda as a substitute.  Worked great.  Delicious!

I used unsalted butter, which may have been a mistake. The cookies were alright, but were lacking that full balanced flavor. Definitely needed some salt. I made one batch and froze the rest of the dough. I will try adding salt to see if it helps.

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever tried to make.  They are great with the addition of frosting and sprinkles.  I took them into work and they have now become one of my signature items.  One of my coworkers suggested I could have my own bakery with these cookies!

I rolled most of the balls in sugar/cinnamon mixture which was really yummy.  But did keep a few plain in order to rate the cookie as written.  Very good, basic sugar cookie recipe and easy to adapt to personal likes.  Very quick to whip up.

These cookies are my families favorite cookies ever! They come out perfect if you follow the directions. I usually put them in for 10 minutes, and take them out before they brown. They come out soft and chewy with a little bit of a crispy outside. If I want them browned, I only let the edges brown a tiny bit or else they cook too long. Will bake these over and over again.

This recipe is impossible to screw up. I made them by hand, halved the recipe, used powder instead of tartar (even put a little too much in!), made pretty large dough balls and added a little lemon extract and some lavender flowers. You would think that they would come out a total failure, but low and behold, 10 minutes in the oven at 350 and they taste like lemony, lavendery sugar cookies with chewy centers and cracked tops. Incredible.

It's hard to find a really good sugar cookie recipe. I like my sugar cookies, soft & chewy, without it it tasting like too much sugar or too much butter. I have several recipes here that have had 4-5 stars with a large number of reviewers. This is probably the best recipe I have tried ! I have used my small cookie dough scooper, and they came out great, and then I made some a bit bigger, the size of a candy machine bubble gum piece. That size was better as it created a perfect solid cookie and texture. Kudos to Pam ! You have a keeper !

Love these! These are so yummy and soft! I made these as Christmas coutout cookies and everyone I gave them to had rave reviews. My mom was actually mad that I didn't give her more! haha. I changed a couple of things though. I didn't have any cream of tarter so I left that out and I also added a 1/2 tsp more of vanilla. I topped them off with a powdered sugar/milk frosting.

Very rich and buttery. I made this recipe exactly according to recipe. I did stick the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes to get it to firm up just a bit but it really didn't need it. The cooking time and temperature was exact. VERY good. This would make a great Snickerdoodle, too! This one's a keeper. NOTE: I came back to change my review a couple days later only because these dried out so fast. The flavor was still good, but these were just......dry.

*I* don't care for sugar cookies, but my husband does, so I made these for him last night.  As I was working with it, I thought it seemed more like pie crust dough than cookie dough (dry and crumbly).  My husband liked the cookies, but noted that there was a slight "flour" taste to them.  After reading lots of other reviews, I think I will try this recipe again, and either reduce the flour a bit, or add a couple tablespoons of applesauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

these are super easy and really good.  Someone mentioned they taste a bit like raw dough - I assume they undercooked them a little.  Or maybe ate them fresh from the oven.  I made them for a cookie exchange and they were a hit!

SIMPLY THE BEST!!!  I followed the recipe to a T and they were awesome!  Still soft and chewy a few days later. The key to getting a chewy, cracked cookie is 1) do not overbake, the edges should just be slightly brown and 2) all ingredients should be at room temperature for maximum spreading. My husband thought they were store bought they were so good.  Will definitely make this again any time I am hankering for a real sugar cookie!

Best chewy sugar cookies recipe in the world :) and with a few ingredients.  I don't see how any one wouldn't like these cookies.  They are crispy on the outside and slightly chewy in the middle.  They are not too sweet and so buttery.  I don't eat sweet that much but I love these.  My family devoured them as soon as they came out of the oven.  By the way,   I tested  half a batch flattened and half I didn't flattened.  Dont lose faith because they do flatten out the last 5 minutes into beautiful cracked round cookies before your eyes...So  it is  not neccessary to flatten them.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Ok.. I have never had to officially ban cookies from my house before.. but I guess there is a first for everything.  I baked these cookies -exactly- as written in the recipe, I rolled them in colored sugars before baking.. I cooked them.. I let them cool till they were just warm, ate -4-! Promptly put them in a box and ran them over to my neighbors house.. let THEM eat them all.. good heavens, these cookies are AMAZINGLY good.  These are just not something I can trust myself with around the house.. wow is all I can say.  They cracked beautifully by the way, they're as pretty as they are good.

Great cookie!  We were looking for a moist and chewy sugar cookie recipe and found it here!  Easy to make, my 17 year old son baked some on a cold fall day and they turned out so well, that now he wants his own Food Network show!  Thank you Pam!!

Wow! I made a batch of these cookies this afternoon, and can't keep my kids and hubby out of them! They baked perfectly, and I only topped with colored sprinkles before baking. I love this recipe! I ended up just dropping tablespoons of the dough on the cookie sheet, yet the cookies still ended up about the same size, and pretty round. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T". Will keep this on hand for all of those school parties this year! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good! My family ate them up. I didn't have cream of tartar so I used white vinegar instead. But still came out good.

I thought this recipe was FANTASTIC. At first I thought the dough seemed a little greasy, but when they came out of the oven they smelled great and tasted even better. I'll be making this recipe again.

Delicious! I used whole wheat flour & substituted w/ soy margarine since my daughter has a milk allergy. They are wonderful. The whole family enjoys these!

I followed this recipe to a T and the cookies came out masterfully! I love the texture and the taste. I didn't have the stiffness probably at all nor did I sift my dry ingredients together. For variety I rolled some in cinnamon sugar and the colored sugar beads. Thanks so much not just for me but also for my mother who lives in a nursing home because she is stricken with Alzheimer's and also for my young friend battling stage 4 lymphoma cancer because I am sending them both care packages with these homemade cookies inside.

These cookies were YUMMY!! I was a little hesitant to make cookies since I very rarely make them, but these cookies were easy to make and tasted awesome. Family was eating them almost as fast as I was making them! The only problem I had was that I left them in the oven a little longer than the recipe called for since they were lookin' a little pale, so they turned out a little harder than I would've prefered. Still delicious, though. Thanks for a great recipe!!  :)

AWESOME! As some other users said, the dough was dry and crumbly, but all worked well. This is a great recipe. PS I added nutmeg, allspice, cloves and cinnamon bcz I'm a spice freak. It was good!

I make cookies very often and I had trouble with this recipe.  I couldn't seem to get the cookies done in the middle--I had to put them back in the oven two or three times to get them right.  They were ok when they were warm, but were bland and not very good when they cooled.  I would not make these again.

THIS IS THE ONE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!!! Tried alot of sugar cookie recipes but they just weren't right...I didn't want to ice them, just wanted a plain, sweet, crunchy on outside, chewy in the middle...this is it!!! I baked one cookie at a time until I got it where I wanted it, as I had baked so many others that didn't rank. I ended up adding 1/2 cup sugar, and, OMG!!! Buttery, sweet, chewy, crunchy heaven!! We ate waaay tooo many when they came out of the oven!!

I really loved this recipe. I kicked it up a bit by adding the juice of like half a lemon maybe more. It was great. My family and friends really liked them too. I dipped the balls into sugar before baking and man, they were nice and the lemon really set it off. I plan on making these again and again.

(10 year old daughter reviewing) They are really good cookies.  I baked them myself.  The recipe was easy to follow.  Mom said to mix the dry ingredients together first to make sure the baking soda is blended well.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever made. I would recommend following the directions for adding the dry ingredients after putting all of the moist ingredients together. My third time making this I was in a hurry and threw all of the ingredients in, and my dough felt like sand. >.

I love this recipe. My 9 year old daughter helped me bake them for her class Christmas party. She suggested that we crush candy canes to powder and roll the dough balls in the candy cane before baking. Well I always knew she was brilliant! The cookies look and taste like the perfect Christmas treat.

So soft and perfect. My b/f likes snickerdoodles, rolled some of these in cinnamon sugar and got the same effect as snickerdoodles. We could not stop eating these and in a tupperware bowl they stayed fresh and soft for almost a week now. :-)

This is a very tasty cookie and very easy to make.  I did not, however, like the texture of the dough or the cookie.  It was very dry and hard to roll into balls.  Not only that but putting in the oven just until the cookie started to crack yielded a cookie that would fall apart if handled normally.

My husband rates cookies by their 'dunkability' in milk - this cookie failed miserably as it fell apart just holding it above the cup!

Very good!  That about says it all.  I mixed plain sugar with multi colored sugar and then rolled the dough in that before baking.  My 5 year old told me "Daddy these are the best sugar cookies you have ever made."

These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted.  I did use about 1 1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla extract rather than the 1 tsp. in the recipe.  I also rolled each ball of cookie dough in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  Additionally I used salted butter since salt was not in the recipe.  I kept the baking time to exactly 10 minutes and they have the perfect amount of chewiness to them.  Overall these are amazing cookies!

Fantastic cookies.  I did double the vanilla in this recipe and also rolled them in sugar.  I suggest doubling the recipe right away.  They don't last long!

Very good sugar cookie! Did't taste to sweet nor to tasteless, just right in between. Kind of flat. Add 1 cup of extra flour to fix that then bake about 9 minutes.

Excellent, like shortbread!  I cut the sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet.  I also did not have enough white flour so substituted in 1 cup whole wheat flour -- amazingly, it is delicious and has a nice texture to it from the whole wheat -- deliciously melt-in-your mouth soft and crumbly, and just slightly chewy.

I made these 2 days ago and they are now gone! (I'm actually going to make some more tomorrow to take on a road trip.) I took the advice of others and rolled 1/2 of them in some cinn./sugar but even the ones I left plain were delicious! I know it's tough but resist the urge to flatten them, they do it on their own and it's amazing! Great "cracked" look and wonderful flavor. I will use this recipe from now on-I'm thinking of decreasing the sugar and adding mini choc. chips next time! Thanks :-D

This was a great recipe. I am in grade 11 and in a class where we had a cookie bake off and this was definately the best one. Thanks for such a great cookie. PS we gave some to the secreatarys and now they want the recipe. ( gave it a four becuase the next day they were not as good)

These were definetely better the second day, but I do think that the dough needs to be chilled first-- mine spread out far too much. Also, I rolled in cinnamon & sugar and they were far better than the plain ones.

I tried this recipe with the baking powder/baking soda substitution for the cream of tartar suggested by another member, and I used margarine instead of butter since that's all I had on hand.  The first batch was flat, flimsy pancakes.  There's no way I could have "shaped" them into balls.  I realized the texture was wrong, so I refrigerated the remaining dough while the first batch was baking.  The second batch still couldn't be shaped into balls and didn't "crack" like they are supposed to, but they came out tasting great.  They were soft and fluffy inside and the edges were delightfully crunchy.  

I recommend to anyone else using margarine to refrigerate the batter for about 30 minutes before baking.  You still can't shape the dough, but placing them on the baking sheet in spoonfuls will get good results.  Great recipe!

I followed everything exactly, except used 2 whole eggs instead of 3 yolks and these were a great disappointment.  They weren't chewy at all, but airy and a bit crumbly.  And, they weren't sweet enough for my husband and I.  Bummer!

Great tasting cookies. I also used 2 whole eggs and increased the sugar by 1/4 cup. Turned out soft and perfect. I made some into snickerdoodles and some with sugar and cocoa. Can't go wrong with these cookies.

These are great! Last time I made them, after I rolled them into balls, I created a litte "cavern" in them and filled them with raspberry preserves. They baked up very pretty and tasted even better.

Just made these tonight. I have never made sugar cookies before and I'm glad I chose this recipe for my first time. These cookies turned out wonderful! They are soooooo delicious! Crispy on the outside, very chewy on the inside. I don't think 5 stars do this cookie justice! I'll be making these again and it will be the only sugar cookie recipe I use! 
A little hint: I also add about a tsp of lemon extract to these to have just little hint of lemon flavor to it (you can just add to taste) and they are still soooo moist and delicious! These cookies are also fantastic for Snickerdoodles!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!! And I didn't have to go to the supermarket. All of these items I had in my pantry and the cookies turned out to be delicious. They baked up cracked and golden brown and they were soft and chewy in the inside. I had mine with three scoops of Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream and I was in heaven! Great recipe!!!

These cookies were so good! I loved them once I finished my second batch. Everyone wanted more. The only problem I had which I fixed on the second batch was that they were very dry. I added some more vanilla and some milk and they were great after that!

Just tried this recipe tonight, on Christmas Eve. Have to say I coudln't be happier that I found it! I am 9 mos pregnant, due Jan 15 and I have a 3 yr old daughter. Needless to say, with all of the running around buying gifts, getting ready for the new baby etc., the last thing I thought about was baking cookies for Santa, until my daughter reminded me at 7pm tonight. Most stores are closed and we had limited ingredients here at home. This recipe was so easy and to my amazement I had ALL of the ingredients right here! (except the cream of tartar, but I substituted with the baking powder/baking soda as other reviewers did). These cookies were sooo good and I just can't believe that such a simple recipe could produce such a great result! Thank you so much Pam for this recipe and for making my daughter's 3rd Christmas one to remember!

I used butter, 2 full eggs instead of the yokes, extra vanilla, and sprinkled colored sugar sprinkles on top. These are excellent, soft sugar cookies. Perfect for Christmas.

I have made these a few times in the past month and they are fabulous every time. I pressed them down once with a fork and they came out flat and reminded me of the ones you get at Subway (which I love). They melt in your mouth. The crisp edges and gooey middle is delightful.

I thought these were good, but a tad too sweet.  I would cut out 1/4 of the sugar if you don't like things overly sweet.  I also added finely shredded lemon rind for subtle flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good sugar cookies if you don't like a super sweet cookie.  The only reason that I deducted a star was because I followed the instructions exactly and they didn't really crack they way they were supposed to.  Nonetheless, the flavor is good, and I think a person who enjoys a sweeter cookie would like these if they frosted them, or rolled in sugar as per other users suggestions.  Also, this recipe would really work best with an electric mixer - the dough is pretty thick and difficult to mix by hand the way i had to!

This cookie had a nice soft, chewy center, but I didn't really like this cookie by itself. It tasted like flour, and not sweet at all. But the way we decorated it (with candy corn and royal icing) it was sweet enough.

Delicious! Kind of like a snickerdoodle. In fact, I rolled some in cinnamon sugar, and they tasted great. Rolled others in sugar sprinkles. I also added about 1/4 tsp almond extract.

Mmm these cookies are delicious! Mine are flatter than the ones in the picture but still tasty. I'd say they are more like snickerdoodles than sugar cookies in flavor but the slightly crunchy outside and soft middle is yummy. I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar for more flavor. They are quite buttery but easy to make. For my health I probably shouldn't make these again soon. But they're good. You should make them.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some egg yolks. I came upon this recipe and was very pleased with the results, for sugar cookies these are quite tasty, and my family ate them right away!

I made these last night for a last minute sleepover crew and they were the best sugar cookies I've made yet. Resist the urge to flatten, they spread just perfectly on their own. Oh, definately roll in sugar or sprinkles before baking for an added touch.

These were very tasty,but alittle dry. I used shortening instead of butter so maybe that was my problem. Thanks for the recipe!

I am sorry but I didn't care for this at all. It was first to liquidy but I thought that was how it was supposed to be. But once it was cooked it I really didn't like it. I would have gave it 1 star but my mother thought that it was like bread.

Beautiful! I did substitute shortening for the butter and 1/2 tsp. baking powder for the cream of tartar and they came out great. I also just put a smidge more vanilla in. This recipe is expecially great because it is so easy and quick, it isn't messy and it does what it says it will! Thanks Pam! Wonderful recipe!

Great recipe. I added about 2 TBS of apple sauce to my second batch and I think it gave them a little bit better consistency. They are great even if you follow the recipe exactly.

My daughter asked me to make these after seeing the picture. I didn't have any problems with the mixture being too dry or not coming together, although it does take a bit of time if doing it by hand. Mine did take a bit longer to cook about 15 minutes. They were just what my girls like in a cookie, crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. Thanks.

Theses cookies are very good. They are extrememly easy. Anyone could make them. They are very soft in the middle and taste very good when they are warm. Before I put them in the oven, I rolled the balls in white sugar. They turned out very well.

Excellent flavor and texture.  Very easy to make.  The dough does appear dry when you first begin to mix it, but just keep mixing.  It turns out just right.

This is a great recipe to do with kids.  It is easy and fun.  We rolled ours in colored sugar, and since I omited the baking soda we flattened the cookies slightly.  They turned out great!

These cookies are great. I don't even know how to cook and if I can follow this recipe and the cookies come out right, any anti-chef can do it. They are moist, sweet but not too sweet, and melt in your mouth. I am thinkin about going pro with makin these cookies....or not but they are still a great recipe. Thanks Pam!

These are pretty good and have a good texture, chewy/crisp edges. Used this recipe cause I had 3 egg yolks left over from making a white cake. So, may make again but would probably roll the balls in sugar first. Thanks

Delicious. These aren't your average sugar cookie, which is the best thing about them. They have a melt in your mouth quality and a beautiful appearance. Everyone loved them and I will certainly be making them again!

I thought I'd try this recipe because I had exactly three egg yolks left over from a meringue cookie I previously made.  This cookie reminded me of the "tube" cookies from the dairy case.  Not a bad sugar cookie, but not your typical sugar cookie either.

I know that I already rated this recipe, but...I just had to say again :)...these cookies are AWESOME! Try this recipe!! Just like the ones you get at the bakery!!! YuM, yum, yum, yum, YUM! Oh, and just so you know, this doesn't make anywhere near 4 doz, but then again, maybe I just made my cookies too big! 
I have tried so many sugar cookies, and this is definetly better than any of the others, even though some of them were pretty good. Thanks again Pam~SareKate

So easy and yummy. Glad I read the review that mentioned making sure butter was super soft. That was the secret. I made them before and they were okay. Using the super soft butter made them exceptional!

I added 1 1/2 cups of blanched walnuts and 1 cup of raisins simmered in Sherry.  Really good, but CRUMBLEY. Have to figure out how to  make them less crumbley.  Bill says "add flour and an egg".

FANTASTIC recipe!  The only thing I do different is to roll the balls in sugar after forming them... I love sugar :)

They didnâ€™t last a full day, everyone loved them. They werenâ€™t too sweet & looked great. Very easy recipe to follow. We will be making these again.

Soft and pillowy cookies, needed to bake a couple minutes extra but can't really complain.  Dough was a little dry, but held form when smooshed into balls.

This is a REALLY good cookie.. Boyfriend ate them all up! my only substitution was replacing the cream of tartar for lemon juice. This cookie came out perfect in shape, melts in your mouth and super light and fluffy. Thanks for sharing! :)

Very good quick and easy sugar cookie recipe....I sprinkled red, green and blue bakers decorating sugar on them with about 1-2 minutes left to bake ....wait for the cookies to crack across the tops to add sugar....donâ€™t over bake.

Fabulous last minute decision to make these.  Easy, peasy.  We added some chopped chocolate from a bar for fun and they turned out wonderful.  Did have to cook them twice as long as stated in recipe, but that might have been because I made them too large - didn't matter.  They were crisp and buttery.  A winner!

I didnâ€™t have any vanilla extract, so I used almond extract instead, and it still tasted delicious for Christmas! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe. Iâ€™ll definitely use it again.

These were insanely tasty! Mine came out flat- but Iâ€™m guessing I just needed to chill the dough or something. Any suggestions on combatting spreading/thinning? Either way- the flavor is so good I donâ€™t care what they look like lol!

Best sugar cookie recipe ever. First time making them last minute for a cookie party and they came out perfect. Baked them for 14-15 minutes and added food coloring in different sections. Rolled the dough ball in course sugar before placing them on the baking tray. Will be making every Christmas!

When I was in elementary school, my mom would pick me up and we would occasionally stop by Mcdonaldâ€™s for a treat. We would only get their sugar cookies (not sure if they still have them). They were perfect and chewy and sweet and had a delightful crunch from the sugar crystal topping. 

Fast forward many years later, I found myself searching for a sugar cookie recipe to replicate that nostalgic Mcdonaldâ€™s sugar cookie flavor and texture. I made these cookies and they turned out perfectly chewy and sweet. I did not have cream of tartar on hand, so i searched for substitutes and did have lemon juice. They still turned out perfectly. I canâ€™t wait to make these again.

Very easy and delicious. These are light and airy with good buttery flavor. They tend to be a bit delicate but are really flavorful. Quick to make with stuff you usually already have so they make good last minute cookies. I use parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets. My only advice is to let them cool a minute or two before removing to cooling rack.

Amazingly simplistic ingredients, easy to make, and absolutely scrumptious cookies! I used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, and believe it made them even more tasty. Iâ€™m so impressed.

These are so good! In didn't have cream of tartar so I did take the advice of another review and used baking powder and soda along with the amount of soda in the recipe and they turned out great. I also mixed white sugar and red sugar and sprinkled the cookies before I put them in the oven. Will make these again. Thank you for a great cookie. :)

I've tried this recipe twice, once with the regular sugar and once with a regular sugar/brown sugar mix and a lemon glaze on top (just simple powdered sugar and lemon juice) and both times they were phenomenal.  Chewy in the middle, crispy on the outside.  They weren't quite as pretty as in the picture but they sure tasted great.  I used room temperature salted butter and noticed that the batter was quite dry and crumbly, however it was really easy to form the cookies that way.  I did choose to flatten mine, and I'm glad I did because otherwise they would have been way too puffy.  I flattened them a little before cooking, and gentle pressed on them when they came out of the oven to flatten them a little more.  Very happy with this recipe.

I would try to not make them super round, I would flatten out a little bit. Mine didn't flatten out at all and they are shaped kind of weird being so round, but they still taste really good.

Iâ€™m not a huge fan of sugar cookies but these were easy and delicious. I didnâ€™t have cream of tartar so i used apple cider vinegar (a standard type of substitution). Worked very well. I may have made these a little large so my cooking needed more time but thatâ€™s on me :)

The only thing I did differently was I used an ice cream scoop to make uniform cookies. They were obviously bigger than the recipe called to make so I just baked them around 18 minutes at 350 and they turned out perfectly! I got 14 cookies instead of the 24.

This is the best Sugar Cookie recipe I have come across.  My family loves them and I had the best sugar cookie in class out of 15 of us and our best Sugar cookie recipe. Its got to be the the absence of egg whites. It will crack on the top and look a little underdone but as soon as you start to see any brown around the edges, pull them out. I mixed up 2 recipes and rolled them in sugar but it turned out to be a tasty mistake. I scrapped my old recipe, this is my new go to.

These cookies couldnâ€™t be any better! Wow! This will be my go-to recipe for sugar cookies. Holds its shape yet still soft with the perfect amount of crispiness. Nicely sweet. Thank you! I rolled mine flat and used large cookie cutters. Donâ€™t overcrowd on the pan like I did as they spread a bit in the oven.

My goodness these cookies are simply delightful! I didnâ€™t have any baking soda on hand.  An equal substitution is three times the amount using baking powder. These turned out beautifully buttery and delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I found that adding a little but of extra butter, and sprinkling the cookies with sugar before baking really enhanced the experience.  Also be careful not to overcook, it takes less than a minute to go from moist and delicious to crunchy.

Good cookie. Although I'm GF and didn't get to taste it. Gave it out to some people in my church that were having a rough couple of days. Easy enough to make. Surpised at how much sugar was in it. Though I guess it is called sugar cookies. Made 36. The baby and dog snagged a couple. Made mine small. Thanks!

When we knead these or overmix after adding color (to make them tie dyed or otherwise), they do not flatten out and stay chewy.  I'm not sure why.  When I do them regularly, they're my favorite cookie of all time!!!!  I'm terribly picky and they're perfect!

My 1st sheet was baked as directed and but I needed to add 2 minutes to them and they turned out good.   But after that one, I turned my convention oven up to 375 and baked for 10 minutes.  Very good!  Maybe just my oven, but with the change they turned out fully baked and yet very soft.  Everyone that sampled them as they cooled thought they needed 5 stars.

The flavor was amazing but the texture was bad! They were dry and had the consistency of bread. Iâ€™ve tried this recipe multiple times and it hasnâ€™t worked out well even with thorough instruction following.

Made them for my dtr-in -law who doesnâ€™t eat a lot of sweets, but like sugar cookies, only used a cup of sugar, sprinkled a bit of confectioners sugar on them after they were done. Very tasty and simple

I made these EXACTLY as the recipe stated.  They just didn't have any flavor. I don't like frosting on a cookie so in order for me to eat them plain it needed more vanilla or some almond extract or some lemon extract... I don't know just something more. It was just too bland. Now, if you like frosting on a sugar cookie this would be a good recipe because the texture was spot on.

WE give it five stars, because they were very simple to make but came out very good. We suggest if you have time to add sprinkles and/ or frosting because without it the cookies are a little dry.

I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is that is a bit too thin and crumbly for my preference. I might try 1 1/2 cups flour next time. Flavor is delicious though

9 months pregnant for Christmas this year meant no energy to roll out cookies!  These were an awesome substitute!  I added a little nutmeg, used half the vanilla extract and replaced it with almond extract.  We also rolled them in colored sugar to make them a little more festive since we weren't decorating them this year.  So so yummy!

DELICIOUS and SOFT!!! Love this recipe. I only had 3/4 cup of butter. So, I added 1/4 cup of coconut oil. The only thing missing from the instructions is to chill the dough (and the cookie sheet, or rinse it with cold water between batches if you only have one). The balls just form better that way, and you get more uniform cookies.

Perfect recipe as it!  I doubled recipe and made half as is and the other half I added green food coloring and peppermint extract for green cookies for St. Patrick's day!  Both are awesome!
Watch in oven carefully for first one as there is a happy medium between then getting a full cracked look and starting to brown on top.  I pulled mine out at 9 1/2 min

These are THE perfect sugar cookies. Taste just like you would get at a deli.  They remain nice and soft for days.  I did half the batch rolled in sugar and half without and I prefer the pillowy look and taste of the ones rolled in sugar. Yum!

This recipe is super easy. I threw all the ingredients into a bowl together and hand kneaded it. I added some crushed soft peppermint candies to the dough, then rolled it out and used a water glass to cut it into circles. They came out on the bigger side, only got 19 out of one recipe, but they are HEAVENLY. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Most delicious recipe ever!!! I didn't have parchment paper so i lined my pan with foil for easy removal.  These cookies were nice and chewy.  Only substitutes I made was for the cream of tartar (I didn't have any) so instead of 1/2 teaspoon of tartar I used 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  Also the batter is great to refrigerate and use at another date.  I simply stored leftover batter in freezer bad and rolled it in a ball.  Be sure to make small balls with these because they expand nicely...so walnut sizes as stated.

This recipe is so great! I made it for my family at our Christmas party and everyone loved them! The kids and older family members all came back for seconds and bought some home. They are not too sweet and are better than any store brought cookie Iâ€™ve ever had!

I followed the directions exactly, with the exception that the batter was a bit dry so I added a Tbs. of buttermilk. For a few of the cookies, we rolled them in a bit of sugar and cinnamon, but the rest were as-is. My cookie balls were too small, so they're kind of small for sugar cookies, but maybe that way, we'll save some calories! Excellent recipe!

Came out perfect despite not having cream of tartar on hand. I just followed what another reviewer suggested and subbed with 1 tsp baking powder and dropped the baking soda down to 3/4 tsp. Other than this substitution, I kept true to the recipe. The flavor and texture of the cookies were fantastic; the only problem I have is that they're a little too sweet for my and my family's personal taste as is. This recipe ends up perfect for us by simply cutting back to 1c or even 3/4c sugar.

Excellent texture. Crispy on edges, soft inside. Nice and light and not too sweet (my preference). Will definitely make again.

For a twist, I added: 2 tsp vanilla extract (instead of 1), 1 tsp lemon extract, 1 tsp orange extract, and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Also brushed the tops with some egg white and then added a couple of almond slivers before baking. (Have a photo of final product. Will try to attach it.)

I'm a beginner at making cookie dough so when I tried this I was skeptical.  But it came out beautifully. The Dough was soft and yummy.  I even had extra dough left over!  I would definitely make this dough again.

This recipe is great. Iâ€™ve also found that if you substitute the vanilla extract for 1tbsp and 1/2 tsp of maple extract it creates a unique, festive flavor.

Excellent recipe!  The only downside was that they didn't really flatten out at all when cooking, so the next few batches I pressed it down to make it flatter.

I added just a pinch of sugar on top and cookie icing to help with the flavor, but the downside was is that the cookies still didn't taste as good as I hoped they would be.

Love these! Itâ€™s hard to find a good sugar cookie recipe. I like to roll them in colored sugars for the different holidays before cooking, super cute. My favorite thing to roll these in was crushed up candy cane for Christmas. They were much less fluffy, but totally worth the peppermint delight that they became.

Buttery and eggy, soft and chewy for days when kept in airtight jar. Going to try adding a bit of citrus zest for next time. Recommend tightly packing crumbly dough into cookie scooper to help shape the cookies - they came out very consistent.

I think this is awesome just the way it is! I use cinnamon sugar if doing snicker doodles. I also substitute the vanilla for either lemon or orange extract and they come out amazing. (I use orange or yellow colored sugar if changing the extract.) I have tried using margarine instead of butter... not the same. Pay the extra and use real butter, it makes a huge difference.

These are perrrrrrrfect as-is, but for the holidays I added candy cane kisses for fun. Just push them in when the cookies are warm right out of the oven.

This is a fantastic recipe!! It is the perfect base dough for any flavored cookie. I added 2 tsp of almond extract for the perfect almond cookie. I did ice cream scoop sized balls and rolled the cookies in white sugar garnished with toasted almonds before baking.

Excellent cookies! My sou chef (my doggies) enjoyed it just as much as I did. It was not as sticky as I would like, however that did not take away from the taste! They are just as good as any store bought cookies and yielded a grand harvest of 59 tiny cookies!

dough tastes good but mine did not turn out at all. it was so crumbly that I had a hard time even getting the balls to stay together but stuck with it and baked them. now that they're out of the oven and cooled they are just cookie powder. I don't know of my cream of tartar is too old or what but it just didn't work for me. I checked and double checked the recipe but I don't know where I went wrong.

This is my go to sugar cookie recipe now! I do use two eggs instead of three egg yolks, and I roll them in colored sugar before baking to make them more festive, if itâ€™s not a special occasion I just roll them in granulated white sugar.

It was delicious. I added 3/4 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups of sugar, and it tasted great. I donâ€™t really have much else to say! We did, though, add a few of those ball sprinkles; donâ€™t do that. It created craters inside the cookies. Other than that they were fantastic!

An amazing sugar cookie recipe. I followed it exactly, and they turned out perfectly. I rolled them by hand and took them out a little earlier than the video shows so they were taller and softer. You can adjust the cook time for exactly how you like your sugar cookie texture.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these exactly as written except rolled top half in orange sugar as they were for a Halloween festival.  Cooked for 11-12 minutes and let cool on cookie sheet for 10 minutes.   I literally have to give these away or I will eat them all!  Can't wait to make these again!  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, and this made exactly 36 cookies using a cookie scoop.

I made them exactly as shown, and they came out extremely flat.  Did the recipe really mean half a cup of butter?  I've seen that mistake made before.  These did not crackle at all, and I've made crackle cookies many times before using cream of tartar.

We are vegan, but these cookies were a favourite of ours from our pre vegan days. We still enjoy them, and making them vegan is simple.  For a fall themed sugar cookie we sub 1/4 to 1/3 canned pumpkin in place of the egg yolks and add some cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Delicious! 

**If the dough is too dry, add a couple tbsp water

This recipe deserves more than just 5 stars! It is excellent. However, I do think in terms of sugar, you can probably use less. I used 1 cup and found them still pretty sweet. I think it could still be good with just 3/4 cup sugar. Now, I didn't have cream of tartar. Figured that too late so I found that I could substitute it for 1tsp of white vinegar. The outcome was perfect. If you let them rest on the pan a bit be watchful that they might flatten too much. They are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect for the holiday season or as a gift! UPDATE: I made this recipe again and made 39 cookies at about 1" balls. I made a batch that I rolled on cinnamon sugar, another in sugar, and one final batch plain. It was excellent! This time I did have cream of tartar and the cookies came out just as good as they did when I substituted the cream of tartar for 1 tsp of white vinegar. Also, I used ultra fine sugar and the outcome was excellent not too sugary and used barely a bit over 1 cup of it! Definitely, chill them for easy handling. I can see this recipe being a Holiday go to!

These were very tasty. I liked the flavor and the texture. I did mine in little mini muffin tins so I could use them as a tart crust. Worked perfectly.

soft and chewy- so good and buttery!
my kids like nuts (pecan, walnut)- so we added some to half batch.  really cant go wrong with dough, remember to soften butter first.

Loved them! The recipe on its own comes out very tasty, especially if you use only the best ingredients like farm fresh eggs and my personal favorite, amish butter (itâ€™s amazing!). I went ahead and tweaked the recipe slightly by pushing a small square of dark chocolate into the center. It was a winner. Next time Iâ€™ll take another commenterâ€™s suggestion and add some lemon zest. The possibilities are endless for this recipe, thanks for sharing!

I added a cinnamon sugar sprinkle to the top of the warm cookies. This was served at my family reunion and was a big hit. Several members asked for the recipe and I gave them this like. I highly recommend this cookie.

Great recipe I used this same recipe to make lemon cookies with about 1/2 a cup of lemon zest and I lined the pan with sifted flour and it came out amazing with about 10 minutes in the oven!

Amazing!! I do put my own twist on these like others tend too. I buy a small bag of coconut flakes and mix them in the batter to make coconut sugar cookies!! Also I don't put in the cream of tartar suggested and they're great!!

I have made these 4 times now. They're so good. This time I happened to run out of cream of tartar so I used a teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 tsp of baking soda. This batch came out the best out of all for some reason. I even dyed them tricolored. They were perfectly cracked, cooked perfectly, just perfect. Only lasted about a day and a half with my family.

I don't even like sugar cookies, but I love these! They're crinkle-y  on the outside, but still nice and chewy. I love that there is no shortening and no need to refrigerate the dough. 

I ran out of all purpose flour, so I used 1/2 cup of wheat flour  and didn't notice a difference at all - I might play with that ratio in the future. 

I baked mine for 12 minutes and they were perfect!

replaced the cream if tartar with 1 tsp of lemon juice as I couldn't find any... Cookies turned out amazing. Perfect amount if soft and chewy. I made icing to go on top. A good combo of the softness you'd find with Pillsbury ones and traditional sugar cookies ... Will definitely be making them again.

My favorite sugar cookies: easy & great tasting. But I agree with many baking experts (Stella Parks, ATK, Epicurious & others) that much of the nuances in vanilla extract are lost & undetectable in baked goods.  So my only changes were to use 2 teaspoons of  good imitation vanilla & 1/2 t of salt. Incidentally, the cookies in the video are definitely overbaked!

These are great!!  I followed all of the ingredients and directions except for the vanilla (didn't have any).  Awesome!  We left some exactly as is and my family demolished them, then we rolled some in cinnamon sugar and some in regular sugar.  This is definitely added to my favorites!!  Thanks!

I just made these cookies right now. Sweet mother of God these are good! I canâ€™t even begin to explain how deliciously buttery, chewy heaven this is. These cookies are exactly like those cookies you buy from the store only home made and better. I didnâ€™t have any cream of tartar because Iâ€™m not fancy lol So I googled a substitute and found you can use 1tsp of lemon juice. If you love sugar cookies this is the perfect recipe! NO need to steer off the recipe. Just follow it and you will be blessed with the best darn cookies youâ€™ve ever made. Trust me.

I make these all the time!  The only thing I will say is that I only use 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar.  I also roll the balls of dough in sugar before putting them on the baking sheet then I press them down to flatten them out.  I have made a variation of this with some cinnamon and allspice and clove and it makes a wonderful spice cookie too!

These cookies are perfect! I did add a tsp of lemon extract. Mixed all the ingredients, kneaded the dough and then rolled it out.  They are tasty, not too sweet, easy to make and would be great iced.

Made these tonight to take to co-workers. While baking, like several other reviewers it seems that my dough cake out very dry and crumbly for some reason. And strangely as with every cookie i ever make in all different ovens i had to increase time to about 13 minutes because they were not Browning at all around the edges. As such some turned out to be but harder and others softer. They had suck great taste, I definitely recommend. The only change I might make next time is the addition of 1\2 two almond extract because I always think it compliments vanilla well. Thanks for sharing!

Cookie recipe is great. I made a batch this morning, added my own ingredients also and they came out beautifully! They were a bit more rounded and fluffy compared to the recipe's photo but they were great. Nice and soft in the middle and not too sweet! Great Recipe. Will definitely try again. :)

Too 'doughy' tasting to me.  Hard to describe.  Almost like there was too much flour, crumbly texture to dough itself so hard to form balls.  I double-checked to see if I measured wrong or left out an ingredient, but no.  Hmmm...still, guess it could be something I did wrong.  Too bad as I'm left with cookies I don't like and don't want to share.  :(

Update:  I just entered this into my work's Christmas cookie competition today, and it won first place!!!  Yay!!!  

This is an AMAZING sugar cookie recipe and now my go-to.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I sifted the flour well before adding it to the wet ingredients.  The one thing I prefer to do when baking sugar cookies is substitute the vanilla extract for Princess Cake and Cookie bakery emulsion because it makes the cookie taste just like the sugar cookies from the Cookie Company's you find in the mall...SO GOOD!  I don't know if you can get the emulsion in a regular grocery, but I order mine off of Amazon.  Great recipe!!!!

Yummy! super easy to make,  easy limited ingredients , taste awesome, turned out perfect. I used mini cookie scoop and cooked on top shelf to not over do it, and pulled out when they said to and they turned out great. I also dipped the tops in christmas sprinkles before baking .

Overall it's a pretty good recipe but I personally found one flaw in the baking process.  I followed all the steps carefully yet when I pulled them out after ten minutes they had not flattened all the way.  I tried my second batch a little different and this time I gave each little dough walnut a little pat.  I didn't squish it; just lovingly tapped it like one might pat a small child/cat.  This batch turned out better shape-wise.  Thank you for the recipe!

I make these cookies every year for the Christmas season. Everyone loves them and asks me throughout the year to make them again. I have maybe one minor change to the recipe opting to leave out the cream of tartar. My most asked for cookie at out family gatherings.

I loved this recipe! At first I was a little concerned they were undercooked after the 11 minutes, but they were starting to crack so I took them out and let them cool on the pan and they were perfect! I didn't have cream of tartar so I used tsp of lemon juice but I'll definitely use tartar next time if I have it. Perfect recipe!!

This recipe is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried a ton! Some of the reviews say to flatten the cookies, but I'd suggest against this. Instead, measure the flour correctly, too much flour makes them more puffy and not as spread out. That was the problem I had,so I had to cook them for an extra 2-3 minutes. But they definitely turned out crackly and they tasted AMAZING. I added sprinkles to mine and they turned out gr8

I made them and they turned out GREAT! Instead of cream of tartar I used baking powder, and I did just as the recipe says. The most important tip is DO NOT leave the cookies more than 10-11 minutes in the oven. They do not change color so don't wait for any color change, just get them out the oven after 11 minutes and let them cool.

I would roll the sugar balls in white sugar and then I would pre- flatten out the cookie balls with a fork (as you would with a peanut butter cookie). Also I would not cook the cookies longer then 8 or 9 min at the absolute most. Then leave them to cook more on pan while cooling.  The difference being a super soft cookie to a crispy one. I promise you wont be disappointed.

I'm a beginner at baking and my cookies turned out looking and feeling more like mini pancakes and they didn't crack. The only thing that I did differently from the recipe was some egg whites got into the mix. To me, the taste was okay but not great. However, I made these for my roommate's birthday and she loved them.

Tasted great but turned out really crunchy. I only baked for 10 minutes. Probably was my oven since sometimes the temp isn't right. Tasted really good with chocolate ice cream and strawberry sauce!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed it exactly as written, with the exception of substituting 1 teaspoon of baking powder plus 3/4 teaspoon baking soda in place of the the cream of tartar and baking soda amounts (thank you for a past review with that advice!).  Make sure you pull them out of the oven as soon as they are all cracked and JUST changing colour... and DEFINITELY leave to cool a bit on the pan before you take them off.  Made for super yummy, chewy cookies!  Thank you!

These were the best sugar cookies I've ever made. My son came home and asked "where'd you get these?" He still didn't believe me when I told him I made them. I had to show him the mixing bowl and the other batch in the oven.

These are so simple to make, and add different flavorings to mix it up. I made them exactly as written for my first time, and the dough was perfect. I made them plain and rolled half in cinnamon/sugar to make snickerdoodles. Next time I will try a little lemon zest in the dough for a light lemon cookie. So versatile.

Great recipe, simple and quick with basic ingredients. Flavor & texture are fantastic! I only made 1 dozen & though the dough was crumbly due to only using 1 egg yolk (instead of 1.5), it still came together nicely & the cookies came out amazing!

Made these twice now. So quick to make! I have to bake them for 13 minutes to get a crisp edge but still very chewy centre. Love em. I even added some fun colours in the dough and swirled them to make cute blue and red tie dye cookies.

Really great cookies! I made these with a little boy I babysit and they were a hit. Even though we forgot to add the baking soda (such an amateur move) they were still delightful! Able to be made without a mess and they bake well at high altitude.

I think this recipe is better than the chance I gave it. Lost my teaspoon and eyeballed the vanilla, baking powder, and salt...which I believe resulted in not enough of the former and too much of the latter 2 ingredients. Still a very soft cookie, turned out lumpier than I had imagined, but perhaps due to aforementioned measurement issues. Would like to try it again with proper tools.

I've made these cookies a few times, great flavorful sugar cookie. I have searched over the years for a good sugar cookie recipe and found nothing until now. they are awesome! follow the recipe to the t and they will be great . Dont change the suggested butter I made that mistake once because I forgot what I used when picking up the ingredients one time and they did not come out the same. most other sugar cookie recipes  come out to hard or go hard after a day, these will not do that.

I used Blue Bonnet instead of regular butter because I always do. I also used Splenda instead of Sugar because I made them for a friend who is not able to have regular sugar. I made a few with chocolate chips and a few with pecan pieces. They all taste good. Only "problem" is that they did not flatten on their own. They have the cookie dropper shape. My kids say that they are fine like that. They love them and don't even care or notice that they were make with Splenda. I tried to flatten some with a spatula while they were already baking and that didn't work. My daughter says that I should have left them alone. "They are cute" the way they came out. Lol

I made a dessert pizza using this recipe. I used just under half of it in a pie pan and cooked it for about 15 min. it turned out perfect! Baked the rest of the dough into regular cookies and they could not have turned out better. Thank you for sharing.

These cookies are amazing. They're crisp on the outside, with very soft centers. I didn't have cream of tartar, (but I was dying to make them!) so I substituted 1 tsp baking powder and they came out fine.

I LOVE THIS COOKIE!!!! This cookie is amazing! It is so soft and moist! Unlike most cookies, these don't get hard or stale when they cool down. If you want THE PERFECT sugar cookie recipe, use this one! I would have given this recipe 10 stars if we had the option!

I would definitely make them again.  Perfect sugar cookie.  Not too sweet, but sweet enough.  I used 1tsp of lemon juice in lieu of the cream of tartar.  Couldn't taste the lemon juice.  I always double the amount of vanilla in my cookies.  I'll take these to my weekly "cookie day" for Saturday morning cookies & coffee with my Dad.  I forgot to mention that it seems the cooking time will vary with the size of the balls you make.  The first batch took about 13 minutes, but the next batch were larger and took about 16 minutes.  They do spread quite a bit so be careful to space them at LEAST 2 inches apart.

Okaty- so i know these are called sugar cookies... but they were very sweet in my opinion.. they did however bake beautifully. For my taste and those in my house will cut down on the amount of sugar.

These cookies are great! The only problem I had was that they didn't get the nice crinkle on top that I was looking for. Don't know if that was because I flattened them first? Flavor was great though!

I will make it again. Also I changed the flour I used. I used all purpose self rising flour. I think it made the cookies more fluffly.

Great cookies!   Had to bake for about 15 minutes per batch.  I did the baking powder/soda substitution that others mentioned, as I did not have cream of tartar.  We also rolled the dough balls in sugar before baking.   I would definitely make these again.

I made these just as the recipe calls for but baked slightly longer so the edges were crisp but center softer , excellent sugar cookie! This will be my go to recipe from now on. Love the texture and flavor, rolled some in sugar and some in cinnamon sugar, both were great!

They were very good, but I didn't think they were as amazing as some people said.I thought they had too much of a flour-y taste. Also, mine turned out real flat. Any suggestions?

This recipe is really good. I did 1/2 of the batch with Watkins coconut extract (just a bit otherwise it tastes like sunscreen). I added a some lime zest as well. The coconut lime cookies were a huge hit too. Tips for all cookies...add pieces of bread to the bag or Tupperware. It keeps the cookies soft.

Great taste but I attempted to modify using a low carb flour and  Swerve sweetener .  The dough was drier than anticipated and didn't spread when baked.   I will need to possibly add milk or  water the next time I attempt this recipe.

Really good cookie! Delicious! I made a small change. Instead of the tsp of vanilla extract, I did 1/2 vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp coconut extract, & 1/2 almond extract. Tastes amazing. Works great as a gift.

Good but I used coconut oil instead of butter. I used a 1:1 ratio and it's a bit too much. I should have used less. It's a bit soft and leaves my hands shiny lol. And the powder I didn't have so I used white vinegar to match the acidity.

Me and a friend made this recipe and they were AMAZING and we are only 12 yrs old! We tried making them multicolor but it didn't work too well, but they still taste the same. We highly recommend this recipe and great job to the creator of these! ??

They looked good. Even smelled good, but there was a weird after taste to it. Also there is not enough sugar in it.

Great flavor and looked like the picture, but after cooling the cookie was very hard and brittle. Maybe I just baked them too long.

I followed the recipe and these were really good fresh out of the oven. I let them cool and stored them in an air tight container and by the next morning, they were hard all the way through. They still had a great flavor but I was hoping for a soft cookie for at least a couple days. I'll keep looking for a good sugar cookie recipe. I won't be using this one again.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! I wanted a recipe that tasted like pilsbury sugar cookies! Well this is it even better! Soft centers chewy crispy edges! I cut the bake time down to 8 minutes my oven cooks fast. I also put red good coloring made them festive for Christmas with green sprinkles!

Amazing!

We made these for a school assessment, and they were so easy and FUN to make! We managed to make around 4o cookies (somehow), and they were gone in a jiffy! Amazing recipe, 5/5 stars!

The only thing I changed was the baking time. With my oven I bake   the cookies for about 8.5 . Nice and chewy, just the way we like them. Will use this recipe again in a few days. First batch was given as a gift.

Super delicious cookies! Just follow the recipe and they come out great. Some people said they didn't roll well, read the recipe......its' not a rolled dough cookie. It's a drop cookie.  Just FYI the dough is crumbly but once you squish it then roll into a ball it stays together.

These are hands down the best drop sugar cookies I have ever come across! I did not have cream of tarter on hand, so I used a substitution I found in another review. I otherwise followed this recipe, and my cookies came out fantastic! Try this recipe, you will not regret it!

I often make the rolled sugar cookie recipe from this site which is outstanding but wanted a simple sugar cookie recipe. This is definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly except I slightly flattened the cookies so the red and green sprinkles I used would stay on top. They are delicious and I will add this to my cookie recipe collection.

I didn't have cream of tarter so I dropped the baking soda too and replaced both with baking powder. Only change I made. They were delicious!

I tasted these when they were warm and I didn't think they were all that great.  But later when they cooled down they were delicious!  They stayed really tasty for 2-3 days unlike most cookies that taste really old within 2 days.  They are especially good with frosting.

I did the first pan with the dough at room temperature. They were a bit flat. The next pan I threw in the freezer for a few minutes. They held their form a lot better and are more moist.  So yummy!

These are great cookies, and a nice way to use up extra egg yolks.  The only change I made was to add almond extract, in addition to the vanilla extract.  Delicious!

Awesome sugar cookie. Recipe works perfectly. I got 40 cookies and baked for 14 minutes. The cracking only happens at the end of the baking time. No cracks.......bake a few more minutes. I rolled the balls in white sugar for extra sparkle. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I was so tired of tough sugar cookie recipes, I had given up on them but my husband ask me to make them and I was so happy with this recipe.  It would probably not be very good for decorating because it is so soft but the taste can't be beat.

Flavour was great, exactly what I was looking for. Next time I will try adding two yolks and one whole egg, as the dough was a bit dry. I will also flatten just a tiny bit prior to putting in oven.

These are amazing! I made them on a whim at 8PM in the evening since I was craving sugar cookies and WOW! So soft and a wonderful melt-in-your-mouth texture. I didn't have cream of tarter on hand, so I did substitute for baking powder/soda combo like others have suggested. I also decided to roll the small dough balls in a sugar sprinkle mix for a little crunch before popping in the oven. (Will try cinnamon/sugar combo and update on the flavor.) The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the overwhelming butter flavor they have as soon as they come out of the oven. Maybe once they're totally cooled off it will be less prominent.

Excellent cookies. Followed the instructions exactly, other than how I formed the cookies. I used a cookie scoop to make them, then I dipped the tops in decorating sugar before baking (the kind that looks like tiny crystals). Baked them for a little over 12 minutes, then I let them sit on the sheet for another 12 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack. Absolutely perfect, taste and texture. Will definitely make again.

I used a tbsp of vanilla extract and a an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. For one week they stayed soft (if you put bread in the container you store the cookies in) and the first day they were made, they were TO DIE FOR.

Had to cook them a little longer than the directions indicated, but the instruction to watch for the tops to crack and for them to start changing color helped me know when to take them out of the oven. Which is great, because I never know with cookies! They are PERFECTION. Delish. Will make again, next time I have the munchies.

I've had sugar cookies before but this is the best recipes I have tried.  It's easy!  I did however probably make ours a bit bigger drop size which required a bit more time in the oven.  They come out firm on the outside and fluffy (bigger and taller the drop, the thicker they come out) and chewy on the inside.

Delicious! I rolled them in sugar before baking and had to bake them a few minutes longer than the 11 minutes on the recipe. They turned out perfect!

Mixed with a stand mixer. I used margarine country crock and I spoon in my  flour
Into the measing cup (as opposed to dipping in bag of flour)
my dough came our like pancake batter... 
So I  Added almost a whole additional cup a tbs at a time to get it to barely pull  together. I tasted the dough and  it seemed over floury. Baked and wasn't. Impressed with The results..... ok like store bought not the quality I normally get from homemade.

Y.E.S. I loooove sugar cookies, but I hate all the work in rolling out, cutting out, etc. These sugar cookies have a perfect flavor and texture, and they're so easy! (And the dough is delicious! :-)) I will make these over and over.

Made exactly as written. Pretty good, but seemed to miss the "Mmmm these are good" factor from my husband & kids. I will try these again, but will put sugar granuals or icing on top.

Very good cookies. I just had a hard time getting the cooking time right. It was probably bc I had to use a convection oven. My family loved them! Great for my first try at cookies!

That was my first time making sugar cookies. And thanks to this recipe it turned out to be a great success! I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, as I didn't have cream of tartar though. They looked great and were absolutely delicious.

Really great cookie, tender and moist. I used 1 tsp baking powder + 3/4 tsp baking soda instead of the cream of tartar/baking soda called for in the recipe. I also rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar before baking. Turned out great!

These are so yummy! The recipe is easy to follow and the result is awesome! I used two eggs instead of 3 yolks and a drop of lime juice because I didn't have cream of tarter. They turned out fine but didn't crack (probably because I didn't use cream of tarter). I poked holes in the middles with my finger before they cooled and put rainbow sprinkles in the holes. I will definitely bake these again!

I made this in a half batch and it wasn't at all how the other reviews hyped iy out to be. it wasn't bad but the cookies were puffy on my first batch so I had to flatten them on my seconds batch (I hate puffy cookies) I've tried other recipes better than this but it was ok.

YUMMY!!!!! So easy. Within an hour I had about 4 dozen cookies. Never mind that a dozen of them disappeared almost immediately!! I have a 1/2 TBS scoop which quickly made perfect little balls on the sheet and resulted in 2.5 inch perfect round cookies. I tried with a couple dozen to add Wilton's sparkling sugar before baking but it didn't adhere well and didn't really add anything. My advice is to love it for what it is: a lovely, easy, yummy cookie to get you to sugar cookie happiness super fast!! Love it.

Amazing super easy cookies!  Used 1/2 cup less sugar so that I could use mini m&ms for the kids; huge hit!  Also used 2 eggs instead of 3 egg yolks( hate throwing away food). Actually liked the cookies plain best.  Used small ice cream scoop.  Cookies needed 12 minutes in oven for plain cookies, and at least 14 minutes for M&m cookies. Makes  63 apricot sized cookies

This is now my holy grail of sugar cookie recipes. I used the original recipe and they came out perfect. Because the  recipe did not say if the butter should be softened or not, I did  soften it in the microwave. I am an experienced Baker, and baking company owner, and this recipe  tops the sugar cookie recipe I've been using.  The one small addition I made was to gently press the tops of the doughballs into sanding sugars to give the cookies extra sparkle for clients. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I wanted to rate these higher but I can't. :(  These just didn't turn out like what I'm seeing in photos and read in the reviews. I don't know where I went wrong since I followed the recipe to the letter, no substitutions in any way.

THESE COOKIES AHHHHH!!!!!! This recipe is probably my favorite sugar cookie recipe EVER :) I will definitely make these again. But, I don't know if I did something wrong but before I rolled these together into balls to get in the oven, the mixture looked very dry and was not compact at all. I followed  the recipe step-by-step so yeah. But I fixed it by compacting them together and they still taste phenomenal!!!

I made these and for some reason, the batter was very runny.  I did everything it said, but the dough came out really runny, almost like pudding.  I put it in the fridge as well like it said, but after about an hr. it was still like pudding.  I don't know what I did wrong.

These sugar cookies got burnt on the tops and was still raw on the inside. I thought that it might be just that batch so I made it again and this time they were just round balls. I will not be making this recipe again.

These were good soft and chewy cookies. I used a small cookie scooper and rolled them in cinnamon sugar before baking. I over baked one batch and the last batch was just right. I took it out after 10-11 mins even though it didn't seem fully cooked and let it cool a few minutes before taking them off the pan. These were small cookies and next time maybe I'll use the medium cookie scooper to make them a bit larger.

Holy moly! These were even better than expected! Light and pillowy. Previous reviewers were spot on with recommendations of small cookies and baking powder and baking soda substitutions for cream of tartar.

These sugar cookies are perfect!  Keep the dough  balls about one inch in diameter, then press them lightly with a fork before baking. I doubled the recipe and got almost 6  dozen delicious cookies.

I absolutely love these cookies!!! I take them to get togethers and people are always excited to see them! They are soft with just the right amount of sweetness. The only thing is that sometimes i have to use only 2 yolks or the dough bevomes too gooey. Other than that love ,love ,love!

Wow! These were really good. The batch on the top rack cracked, but the one on the bottom rack just turned brown on the edges. That doesn't really matter to me, though. Overall, the flavor was great and it was very chewy, just how I like it.  I'd recommend trying it out! But if you put two batches in, I'd put the bottom rack in for less than 14 minutes.

Delicious, soft cookies and very easy to make. I worked the dough with my hands for a minute after using a hand mixer to make a more solid dough as it was crumbly, similar to making a pie crust. I rolled them in some extra sugar before baking, but followed all other directions. I made these as a treat for my boyfriend because sugar cookies are his favorite and he said they are "fantastic" and "probably the best sugar cookies I've ever had." They were definitely a big hit and I will be making these again and sharing this recipe.

These cookies are so good!! I made them for a friend and I'm going to have a hard time protecting them from my family!  :) I added a bit of almond extract to the dough in addition to the vanilla because, to me, a sugar cookie just isn't a sugar cookie without it. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe as-is is great.  I followed the recipe as written, used a cookie scoop for the form, and then rolled the top of the cookie in a bit of sugar.  I had to end up baking around 13 minutes to get a bit of crisp on the edges (the way I like it).  Middle was still deliciously soft.  Yield ended up being about 27 cookies.  ***perfect cookie hints***. Cream COLD butter with sugar in a Kitchenaid mixer; the mixer will make quick work of cold butter.  Also, make sure your pans are COLD in between uses and refrigerate your batter in-between scooping.  Perfect cookies = cold batter and cold pans.   Your cookies flatten because of warm or runny butter.  May add a bit of lemon next time for a change!  Also may use a more coarse sugar for dipping.  And could reduce sugar in batter by 1/4 because I ended up using about 1/4 cup total for dipping.

Recipe is excellent, they got a bit hard after they cooled completely though and getting the baking time down was a bit tricky but after the first tray or two they came out well.

I have tried several sugar cookie recipes on the allrecipe website and this is the best one.  My cookies came out almost as pretty as the photo, but most importantly, they tasted delicious!  A little chewy on the outside and so soft on the inside.  I also rolled the cookies in sugar before baking.  My family is already requesting that I make more.

These are great cookies, soft and delicious.  I followed the recipe just as written and we all loved the delicate buttery flavor.  These would be perfect with a hot cup of tea.  I made these with my 5 year old grandson and he enjoyed the dough,too, when he thought I wouldn't notice.

So I don't know what I did wrong, but I did everything word for word in the recipe. First off, the dough was sticky feeling. I couldn't really roll them into balls. So I tried to with my hands but they flattened. I got annoyed so I just put them in the oven. Second off, they got so big in the oven due to them being flat. But I just don't understand any of this. I don't understand where I went wrong.

I made these as part of my mother's Christmas cookie gift package to her coworkers. They all LOVED them. And honestly, so did I! I don't usually like sugar cookies because they are always so hard. But, just like the recipe says, these are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. So, they were delicious. I didn't change anything about the recipe. But, I did roll the dough balls in red and green sprinkles before baking to make them more festive.

I  have been following this same recipe for the past few years and every time I've made them, it has been a real success! These cookies are now a tradition in my household. 
Sometimes I'll roll them in cinnamon sugar, or add maple flavoring. 
This recipe is so easy to follow and also easy to add your own flare to it. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made these delicious cookies to the recipe - I just added some coloured sprinkles after I took them out of the oven as I wanted some Christmas looking cookies.  Easily blended all ingredients in my food processor. Makes a perfect 2 dozen good sized cookies.

These were great!  I made the recipe exactly, and used an actual tablespoon to measure out my balls.  I rolled them tightly, and I actually came out with about 32 cookies.  Half of them I stuck a few small holiday colored M&M's in half way through baking, just for something different.  I would definitely make again -- they were thin and flavorful and super easy.  Great recipe!!

I recommend after making dough before balling up to stick in freezer for 10-15 minutes to help form dough. It's hard to ball up because it keeps sticking to your finger. After I let it sit in the freezer for awhile it made it a lot easier! Super good cookies (didn't have tartar and still tasty)!!

Excellent recipe, and so easy to make. I didn't change a thing. Left 1 dozen "as-is" and dipped the other dozen in red sugar. Family loves them both, however, imho, "as-is" is practically perfect, and although the red sugar is pretty, it made it almost too sweet. Thanks for sharing this simply wonderful recipe. I plan to double it for my family gathering Christmas Eve (along with my other cookies and desserts).

This recipe provides a good foundation for sugar cookies that you can jazz up to make them more interesting and delicious. Here are the substitutions I made: I used only 2 cups of sugar because we prefer our cookiessweet. I also used brown sugar, not white sugar. I use two egg yolks and one full egg. And I used

I added an additional egg and used all the whites as well once I got to the last step and the dough was way  too dry. 
They turned out okay, but I think there is a little too much flour in the recipe. I'd love to try it again  with the only change being less flour.

This is the second time I baked these cookies. The first time I followed the recipe and the cookies were amazing. The did flatten out, but tasted really good. I sprinkled mine with sugar before going into the oven. The second time I made these I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I omitted it and the baking soda and just used baking powder. The cookies weren't as pretty, but didn't flatten out either. They still tasted pretty good. I will use this recipe for my sugar cookies from now on.

So easy and tasty, just add cinnamon sugar on top after baking to transform into a snicker doodle

Delicious sugar cookies! I baked for 9 minutes and they were perfectly soft in the middle with the slightest chewiness on the edges. Only thing that wasn't exactly as the recipe stated was that I used organic cane sugar (didn't have any standard white) so my cookies definitely had the crunch of the larger sugar crystals in them. Standard white sugar may not produce the same texture between your teeth.

This is THE sugar cookie recipe!  I have been searching for a sugar cookie that is soft and buttery but not sickly sweet; this is it!  We like these best when the top of the dough ball is dipped in granulated sugar before baking; just gives it that tiny boost that sets it over the top. My MIL said "these are perfect!" and immediately asked for the recipe. That alone makes these a winner. ;-)  I will be making these often.

Not that these need one more 5-star review, but they are that great, I had to review them! We've been making them for over a year now and they've come out awesome every single time. Followed recipe exactly, no changes needed. But if you want to make them more fun, we've added sprinkles and gave them away in nice tin boxes for Christmas. You can also dip half the cookie in chocolate and sprinkle nuts. But as I said, they taste great as is and we will keep making them.

This was fantastic! I've had bad experiences with making sugar cookies, they usually come out very crumbly and burnt but this was so easy! I didn't have any butter so I used vegetable oil and I added a 1/2 teaspoon extra vanilla and it is heavenly. I recommend baking for only 8 minutes.

Amazing and simple. I made a number of changes but this is a great base to start from: I took 1/4 cup of the white sugar and subbed in packed brown sugar instead, added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and cooked it on parchment paper. Turned out marvelous.

I used coconut oil instead of butter, and didn't separate the white from the egg - both done purely for laziness. Still ended up with a pretty good cookie. I haven't prepared it as written so I can't compare, I can only say I'll probably use my subsitutions again and maybe swap out the vanilla for lemon next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter turned out dry. I even had to put water in the finished batter and put it in the fridge for a hour. They didn't form balls when I tried to roll them so I had to squish them between my fingers. Ugly, and didn't taste good!Oh well, maybe I'll try this recipe another time, hopefully with better results!

Everyone loves these! They are my go to birthday treat for the kids at school.  We decorate them differently every time and the kids gobble them up.  For adults, they are lovely plain.  Elegantly simple with a fantastic vanilla sweetness, alone or with coffee. I get 36 m-l cookies out of one batch.

Pretty good overall. I made mine a little bigger because of the cookie scoop I Have baked and for 14 minutes. Consistancy is a crumbly soft cookie,which does flatten out a bit as stated. Tips:The less you handle the dough the more tender your cookies will be, and keep dough moderatly cool.not refridgerated, just cool enough that the butter doesn't get melty.

I woulds recommend using all of the egg, as they cookies will stay moist for a lot longer. Last time I made these with the full eggs they stayed moist for a whole week and didn't fall apart when you bit in to them.

I love these cookies. I've made them just as the recipes recommends and I've also made them with a bit of almond extract, and they're stellar either way. My boyfriend, who hates sugar cookies, loves these because they're more sugary and less bready than some other recipes.

Works out great everytime. They look puffy in the oven but I take them out just as the edges begin to turn golden and leave them to cool and they start to flatten and crack. I did adjust to 36servings and substituted 4 egg yolks with 1whole egg, I also used 3 tsp of the vanilla extract. Came out with an amazing flavour crispy edge soft chewy centre! Love these

Best Sugar Cookie. Very easy to use with a cookie scoop. I think when some reviews say they had a problem with the dough being dry, their packing the flour in the measuring cup adding too much flour to the dough. I used room temp butter and eggs, that helps also.

These sugar cookies were SO good!  I was a little worried when the dough seemed kind of dry, but they turned out perfect - soft and chewy.  The recipe made 3 dozen smaller-sized cookies for me, not 4 dozen.  This is my new favorite sugar cookie recipe.  They're easy to make, too!

lol....first time I made these I inadvertently put BAKING POWDER in instead of baking soda.  I thought they were a bit different but they were still very good.  I ought to know.....I ate the entire batch myself.   So today I made batch number 2 but this time with baking SODA.   Now they looked like the picture and if my husband doesn't walk in the door soon, I'm going to eat them all again!!!

This is a nice, basic cookie - I think I would call it more of a tea-cake - it does not have the flavor or consistency of a sugar cookie, per se.  I will probably make these again - they were a nice cookie to serve with hot chocolate.  Next time, I may add a little orange or lemon rind or perhaps some almond extract - they are pretty plain - delicious, but plain.

This is the best sugar cookies!!! They came out so beautifully. I had my convection oven on at 350 and only baked them for 7-8 minutes. They came out soft but settled after 5 minutes. I give this recipes to all my friends!!!

MUCH TOO SWEET!  I  substituted 1 teaspoon baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon baking soda in place of cream of tartar which i can't find here. i made half the batch with lemon zest and rosemary and the flavor was great! but i'll definitely reduce the sugar next time!!!

This is a lovely cookie!  I followed the recipe exactly, watching the cookies closely the last couple of minutes of baking. They are exactly as described and pictured. In my oven, 12 minutes was perfect. One note:  I didn't grease the pans - it's not necessary with the amount of butter in the dough.  This is my new sugar cookie recipe.  Thanks!

This is, by far, the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried.  Thanks to other reviewers, because I use unsalted butter, I did add 1/2 tsp of salt and when the batter appeared too crumbly once all ingredients were incorporated I did add about 1 tbsp of milk just to make it easier to work with.  I had to bake for 12min. These are the first sugar cookies I have ever made which have not flattened out once removed from the oven.  These maintained their height in the oven and out; definitely recommend.

This cookie was almost perfect- it had a nice vanilla flavor, baked extremely well with a beautiful cracked top, and had a soft chewy center.  However, there was a sort of floury, rough taste/texture when bitten into. I would suggest being conservative with the flour, mixing 4 cups into the prepared dough and then slowly adding the fifth as needed. A tad more vanilla and maybe some lemon zest could really liven up the flavor. My brother gave it a 7.5 so not too shabby! Overall a good cookie- still very happy with the way it came out of the oven!

Dough was too wet and sticky to roll into balls.
Tasted very plain.
They puffed up and didn't lay flat.
I had to frost them to give them flavor.

Excellent recipe!! The hubs is a auger cookie fanatic. He says these are better than what he can get at the bakery. 

I was a bit concerned because my dough was fairly crumbly. I thought maybe I added too much sugar or flour but I paid close attention to my measurements. I went ahead and baked a batch because although it looked crumbly, it formed wonderfully. 

This is now my go-to cookie recipe.

Super easy to make. Make sure you scrape the bowl as you're mixing to ensure all the wet and dry ingredients are fully incorporated-it will make the dough easier to handle. Also, next time I make these I will err on the side of under baking them as they over bake very easily (watch for the cracking, not the golden color). A great cookie-with or without frosting!

These are excellent. If you are looking to replicate the pillsbury refrigerator holiday cookies that you can get in the grocery store, this is it!! Nice chewy center with slightly crispy edges.I prepared according to recipe for my first batch and had to swap 1 1/2 cups whole wheat the second time. Both batches came out delicious.

These turned out great. I followed the recipe as is, but rolled them in red and green sugar for Christmas. I did take one reviewer's advice and spooned the flour into the measuring cup. The dough was perfect and easy to work with. I used a cookie scoop to make rolling them easier. Will be making these again, I'm sure!

A not-as-sweet alternative to the classic, icing-covered Christmas cookies of my youth. Very delicious. Yummy and chewy. Maybe next time I'll roll them in sugar to make them a tad bit sweeter, as I like my sugar cookies a bit more decadent. (;

Wonderful recipe!! I followed the instructions, except I added 1/4 tsp of salt and I rolled them in sugar before I baked them. They turned out soft and delicious!! This will be my favorite Christmas cookie from now on...thanks!

These were a hit with all of my family, even my husband who doesn't really like cookies or desserts. I found they baked up best when I put cold butter in the microwave for 1 minute before creaming it with the sugar, instead of just using softened butter. 5 stars for sure!

Made these just as written and they are wonderful! These cookies were the perfectly sweet, buttery, crisp-edged, tender little delights my eight-year-old has been begging for! I will be making these again.

These are perfection!  Dough is super easy to work with, cookies come out perfectly shaped and excellent flavor and texture.  They store very well, too.  Used a really good vanilla extract and I'm loving the vanilla flavor in these! Great recipe to make with kids!

Fantastic sugar cookie recipe! I used these as a base for my mint chocolate chip cookies (add peppermint extract, green food coloring, and chips to dough). They turned out great!!

These cookies are ok.  They are very bland, I expected a more rich flavor and even used some Penzy's vanilla sugar for part of the sugar ingredient.  They just didn't impress us, unfortunately.

Sooo darn good. And when it says don't flatten. DO NOT FLATTEN. I made that mistake. I flattened them and they came out hard. So I tried another batch, didn't flatten and they turned out amazing. 
FOLLOW THE RECIPE TO THE VERY END. 
Best cookies ever if you do.

I am old and a man, so I loved the dough, but I made the balls too big.  Cooked em for about 4 minutes longer and that did the trick. The second batch I got right Also since I cant follow instructions properly, I only netted a little over 2 dozen. But, they are great!!!

This recipe is wonderful and very forgiving, lol.  I have substituted a whole egg for the three yolks, lemon juice for the Cream of Tarter, and always come out great.  DO NOT OVERCOOK as mentioned in the recipe, one thing they are not forgiving of.
I bake with my young grandchildren at least once a week.  This is our go to cookie recipe.  Not only is it delicious by just following the recipe but allows you to be creative.
One grandchild stuck chocolate chips in theirs.  Another rolled theirs in cotton candy sugar.  Both were delicious!

Great recipe that produces yummy, nostalgic sugar cookies, and I love that you don't have to chill the dough before you bake. I made the recipe exactly as written and found it to be a little dry, so I just added about 2 tsp. of milk and it was perfect. This is a keeper and will be a go-to for Christmas baking.

They taste VERY VERY buttery like a shortbread but have a soft sugar cookie texture. They are close enough to what I was looking for so I will try the recipe again but with much less butter.

Best sugar cookie I ever made.  It is so easy and they come out perfect. Not too flat and greasy like some sugar cookies I have made.  To those who say that they didn't flatten, you didn't leave them in long enough.  Even though the recipe says to leave in for 10 minutes, you still have to watch them and adjust the time accordingly, because we do not make them all the same exact size and oven temperatures vary. I had to leave mine in for about 14 minutes, because mine were just a little bigger and the pan I used also requires a little more cook time.

My favorite tasting sugar cookies are the Pillsbury sugar cookies that are in the refrigerated section and are pre-cut, they usually have little holiday art in the middle of them. I have been on the search for a sugar cookie recipe that tastes similar to the Pillsbury ones, and have just found it! These are so easy and taste just like the sugar cookies I love. If I could rate these higher, I would. I'm very pleased. I softened two sticks of butter under hot water and then used my hands to mix all the ingredients in together, (my grandmother never had an electric mixer so she would always use her clean hands to knead everything together). I kneaded all the ingredients together by hand and followed the directions to a 'T' and they came out perfect.

Amazing, absolutely amazing!! When making this recipe I did not have any cream of tartar so as suggested I used  1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda and theses came out fabulous. I also added extra vanilla! My second batch i stored the dough in the fridge for a couple hours and the were smaller but also chewier, which I didn't think was possible!! Next time I am going to try to add chocolate chips and see how that works out!!

So good.  Rolled in sugar and didn't have tartar so did substitute with the baking soda and powder as other reviewer suggested. Came out perfect.

I love sugar cookies!  When you don't want a cookie that's heavy with additions, like chocolate chips, nuts, etc., there's nothing like a sugar cookie!  To ensure good flavor, I did add a pinch of salt, a pinch of cinnamon and about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice (only because I didn't have a lemon to zest).  I like my sugar cookies to have that fresh taste that a bit of lemon can offer.  To end it well, I sprinkled on some coarse sugar...for that ultimate sugar cookie appearance.  These were very true to their promise, a crackled appearance, with a soft center...and very tasty too!  I also liked the fact that I didn't have to chill the dough as with other cookie recipes.  They were not flat, but average in height and a good texture overall.

Loved it! They looked/tasted exactly like what I was after, and the recipe was so simple. The only thing I changed was that I cooked them for 13 minutes instead of 10 to 11, but I have an old oven, so that's probably why.

I made this recipe exactly as described, however, I skipped greasing the cookie sheets in favor of parchment paper, and I baked them for precisely 9 minutes. Don't be afraid of a stiff dough that doesn't want to stay together, and don't squeeze the dough balls; let them stay "light" as you gently roll them. Quite honestly the BEST sugar cookie I have ever had. I immediately made a second batch :D

Heavenly, and so easy to make too! The trick to get them nice and crinkly is to not be fussy when rolling the dough. You don't want to make them nice, perfectly round and smooth. Lightly form and leave looking a little lumpy - pieced and patched together with an overall round shape. I chilled my dough before rolling it so they didn't spread much in the oven and I was able to bake them 12 to a sheet. This recipe made three dozen. They came out a little thin, flatter than I prefer so next time Iâ€™ll be adding some extra flour. However this would be a really good thickness for using to make ice cream cookie sandwiches if baked a bit on the firmer side.

These are so good! I used baking soda and baking powder, used less sugar, and they are delicious! I also tried using coconut sugar and it makes a nice dark brown color, almost like brown sugar cookies with a coconut structure,

Delicious! My daughter loves soft sugar cookies, and these are perfect! They're buttery with a slightly crisp exterior, and then a soft, slightly chewy interior - if that makes sense. So easy to throw together too! Saved to my recipe box! Thanks!

Delious! I don't like the store pre-made dough for sugar cookies. These were the best sugar cookies I had!

These cookies are delicious. My kids love them, my wife loves them, I love them!

The recipe says to bake them for 10 or 11 minutes. Maybe there's something wrong with my oven, but I have to bake them for 16 minutes, but the end result is a batch of totally delicious cookies.

The dough was very crumbly and only held together if pressed. I expected them to flatten out more in the oven, but they remained ugly ball shaped. Double checked the recipe and nothing was amiss. Tasted ok. Won't make them again

Tastes just like the ones from Harris Teeter deli.  The perfect combination of sweet and buttery.  Followed recipe exactly and mine came out perfect, soft and chewy. The balls crack as they bake and then flatten as they cool. Eleven minutes in my oven was just right.  There is hardly any visible browning until you look at the bottom.  This a keeper!

The only change I made was to add extra 1/4 of butter. When I made it before, my dough balls were too big and the cookies dried out. Cook them for 15 minutes, then let them sit in the oven for another 10. Turned out nice and soft so far, but i needy o wait for them to cool down before I make a judgement.

These were very easy to make and not overly sweet.  I did have to add a bit of the unused egg white as my dough was not moist enough.  They turned out perfectly!

I left out the cream of tartar and used whole eggs.  After I rolled out the balls and set them on the cookie sheet I added one candied cherry to the middle of each and baked.  Added a Christmas-y colour and the kids just devoured them.

These cookies were great, even though I messed up a few times XD I didn't read the directions clearly and I put the whole eggs instead if just the yolks. Also I put too much butter, even though that what the recipe called for. So I would put a little less butter next time:) these r fantastic cookies that seem you can't mess up!!!

Definitely a "cookie" cookie, not cakey like a lot of sugar cookie recipes.  Excellent texture and flavor.  I did what another reviewer suggested and spooned the flour into the measuring cup to keep it from getting too dense.  Santa's gonna love 'em!

Ohhh, MMmmmmmmm!!! Just helped myself to 2 of these cookies warm from the oven. They are PERFECTION!! I must say at first I was skeptical of this recipe as I started mixing all the ingredients because it seemed crumbly, I had trouble at the end getting them all blended and I panicked and added a little bit of milk, & VOILA!!!! I followed the directions 100% and I must say I'm thinking of skipping supper and just eating all these buttery, yummy sugar cookies!! Thanks for the perfect recipe, I will be using this one EVERYTIME I get a sweet tooth!!

These are perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out absolutely perfect. The only little thing I added was I rolled the balls of dough in sugar before I put them on the pan, but that's just something my mother always did and doesn't really affect the taste, just makes them sparkle. :) If you want a little color, try rolling them in colored sugar! An amazing cookie! I will most definitely be making these again and again!

It wasn't great. I followed the recipe, but the cookies came out tasting pretty strong of baking soda and flour. They weren't terribly sweet and had a greasy after taste. They were crispy on the bottom and soft on the inside, but weren't fluffy like I'd hoped. I'll keep looking I think.

This is my go-to website for recipes, but I rarely write a review. I had to with these cookies. I loved them. Super easy, super good.  Split the extract between vanilla/almond and embellished with sprinkles. I like a frosted sugar cookie as much as the next girl, but very much appreciate a recipe that doesn't need icing.  Tis the season.  Make them!

Excellent sugar cookie. My husband wanted a cookie like his grandmother used to make. He was very impressed.

Delicious!  I put this together exactly has listed. The dough was really crumbly but I could form it into balls.  I was concerned about the dough but the cookies came out beautifully.

These sugar cookies are amazing. I didn't change one thing. My husband loves sugar cookies!  He has given these a high five.  The dough is just as wonderful! I cannot for some reason make the rolled out ones to save my life, they always end up as brick Santa Claus's & Stars...etc. Thank you so much.

Perfect sugar cookie! My only issue was that I didn't get the cracks... not sure why. I did substitute 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, for extra richness. Perhaps I didn't beat the sugar mixture long enough... not sure. Either way, this is an excellent buttery, sugary cookie... and so easy to make! I will be making these again! Thank you for sharing your recipe with us, Pam!

My family enjoyed these!  I already have a favorite sugar cookie from this site but I'm also going to keep this in my folder.  These had a little chewiness and my other fave recipe is a softer sugar cookie.  Will make these again when I have egg yolks leftover.

Easiest type of cookies I have ever made. Best tasting too. I started to make them 15 min before dinner and finished them 10 min after dinner which is about 45 min. Simple, tasty, and easy which is the best if you forgot to make something for a family event.

Just like the recipe said! It is a nice, soft center cookie. I didn't have access to cream of tartar so i left it out, and the cookies still cracked and tasted great!

Wow.  This sure helped my sugar cookie fix.  I was craving sugar cookies and didn't want to take the time to roll out dough.  This recipe was awesome.  I didn't have cream of tartar but I wanted cookies now.  The dough was crumbly so I added approximately 1 egg white to the mix.  It was perfect.  Cookies spread well and tasted delicious.  Thanks!!!!  Second batch, I rolled in sugar.  Yum!!!

Perfect drop sugar cookie!! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough balls flatten in the oven as stated. My dough was crumbly at first but I kept mixing until the dough came together. I also dipped the balls in sugar before baking for extra sweetness. For the salt that some reviewers thought was missing, I used one stick of salted butter along with one stick of unsalted, because that's what I had on hand...worked fine!! My husband loved these!!!

Thank you for a fantastic recipe!! I made a half batch, and added a little bit of lemon zest to the dough. I also flattened them with a sugar dipped fork. They came out really nice, ...slightly crisp... perfect!! I'm going to get myself another one (or two) right now! :)

We love these cookies. My husband only likes SOFT cookies and these fit the bill. The only thing I did different was roll the balls in sugar before putting them on the baking sheet. In reading some of the reviews that got different results... I have made these using butter that really wasn't soft enough and the cookies hardly flattened at all and stayed round. And then I've used butter that was almost melted because I left the sticks sitting on the stove and they got really flat. So i believe your butter makes the different. However, they were devoured in my house either way! I would like to use some cinnamon one of these times and make Snickerdoodles out of them.

AMAZING!! I was very skeptical about these cookies, but they turned out amazing! It was hard to make the balls but if you try to minimize the contact surface is actually easier and faster.

I had three egg yolks to use, so decided to give these a try. Mine didn't crack as much as I would have liked, but that's likely due to my adjustment. I added 2 tsp. vanilla and used extra large eggs. Perhaps that liquid made the difference? Nevertheless, delicious. I made snickerdoodles out of these by rolling in cinnamon and sugar - my hubby's favorite. Thanks for a great recipe!

The recipe was very good but my cookies turned out flat. I think it may be because the dough was too runny when I put them on the tray. My advice would be to cool the dough 30mins-1hour or until it settles and then bake them. My cookies didn't even "crack" they just flattened. Other than them being flat, the recipe is very good and quite tasteful!

These cookies were very good, although they did not turn out like they look in the pictures people posted. They did not crack. They were a bit bland (which I actually prefer), and were not as sweet as most other sugar cookies that I have had. However, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and the kids loved them! They were still very tasty and very moist. They were not perfect, but still incredibly delicious and light. This is a great dessert or after school snack for kids.:)

This cookie recipe has gotten me so many compliments, however I shorten the baking time to 8 minutes at 350 degrees. They will appear a little doughy in the center but if you just take them out that way and let them cool, they have the most amazing texture ever. roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and then roll them in cinnamon sugar. the result is truly amazing snickerdoodles. or, i roll them in rainbow sprinkles (those small round ones), those are my man's favorite cookies!

These are absolutely the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted! For anyone who has had problems with flat cookies it might be the brand of flour you're using. I made this recipe the first time using Safeway brand flour and the cookies turned out delicious. I made them again about a month later using Pillsbury's Gold  flour and they came out flat even though they still tasted the same. So its just a suggestion if your cookies have turned out flat!

Next week I'll be 9 months pregnant, so I was feeling too lazy to make cut-out cookies and frost them for my son's kindergarten party tomorrow. I opted for these because the recipe was simplistic. I used a stand mixer and made exactly as directed and didn't have any of the dough issues that some of the other reviewers had. These baked up beautifully and taste wonderful. Nice and soft in the middle with just the right amount of crispness around the edge. The only change I made was to throw in about a 1/2 cup of red & green sprinkles to make them festive. Excellent recipe.

These were PERFECT!  This recipe was exactly what I was hoping for.  I don't prefer the rolled out ones that are crunchy or with icing.  I like the cracked ones, soft centers with the course sugar crystals on top and these couldn't have turned out any better.  SO YUMMY!!  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest.  PERFECT!  Thank you!

These were good, but I would have liked them a little more chewy.  I took the first batch out as they were just turning golden - to late, already crunchy.  Consecutive batches came out much earlier and were chewier, but crisped up by the following day.  Probably would have enjoyed a bit more flavor as well - lemon zest, more vanilla flavor or almond.

I made these today and they came out perfectly. Cooked them for 11 minutes and the bottoms were a light golden color. They have a slight crisp on the outside, a chewy bottom and a soft, yet chewy center that is what sets it apart from other cookies. I can't stand a powdery sugar cookie that has no real texture. I do have to say I really give this recipe about 4.5 stars as is. I want a tad bit more of something flavorwise in this recipe. I am not quite sure what that something is, but I will enjoy experimenting with this cookie. It is one of the best I have had. *Note: These do taste best with some sort of an icing... in my opinion.

I liked these cookies after I sprinkled sugar on top before baking them. Also I DID flatten them a little because if I didn't, they turned out a ballish shape. They taste great but look like hard cracked biscuits, losing them a star for me. Also by the time I got to the last batch, the dough was drying up. Also I used walnut-sized doughballs but did not get 4 dozen. I got just over 2 and a half dozen.

I've made this recipe numerous times for church events, bake sales, etc.  After rolling dough into a ball, I roll the balls in sprinkles for a splash of color for the season or holiday.  Loved by all (especially kids)!

I made these tonight--very easy! I followed the recipe exactly. They're soft in the center and crispy on the outside. The taste isn't very exciting but they're still very good. I might try rolling them in sugar next time. I actually made them tonight into cookie pops and will invite others to ice/decorate them for Halloween. That will probably add the needed kick of excitement. Overall they were really easy and turned out to look very nice and taste yummy. Would recommend to a friend!

These are great! I just made them and i just love the buttery, sugary, yummy flavor and texture. Texture is a big part of cookies and it's perfect! Though one thing is obvious, don't eat these on a diet! LOL

These turned out great! The first batch was a little burned on the bottom, but once I got used to what they're supposed to look like (take them out right when they're starting to crack on the top and change color), they were delicious! 

I didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted both the cream of tartar and baking soda with baking powder. I'm not sure if they would've been better with the cream of tartar, but I really like how they turned out anyway!

Really good. Not super sweet like some sugar cookies. 
11 minutes was just right. Crispy outside, tender inside. I really messed up-only put one stick of butter and had to incorporate another after blending everything together. Cookies were still great.

I also tweaked the recipe a little bit and added half and orange of squeezed juice, as well as about 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract, both of which added some great flavor!

I have never been a big fan of sugar cookies. But they sure were easy to make. I made them at the request of some folks at work. While I found them a little bland, everyone else seemed to love them so they still get 5 stars!

Yes, these cookies are as good as the other reviewers have said. I took them to a cookout and every last one of them got eaten. Definitely my new go-to sugar cookie recipe.

The finest sugar cookies I've found, and likely will not look for any other. I baked on a good cookie sheet with parchment liner to preserve the authentic flavor. 11 minutes 1st batch, the rest at 10 minutes each, never peek, bake and pull out, cool on sheet on rack, then move to cooled rack. Decorate or eat as is, perfect perfect perfect cookies !

Very nice though the dough is a little sticky. So easy to make a 12 year old could do it! My kids love them and they taste great.

I thought the cookies would maintain the shape I put the cookies in. The cookie dough tasted 5 star worthy. The cookies look GREAT! They taste not very good because they are too buttery. I put chocolate on the cookies. Might be making this again,but will reduce butter.

Absolutely delicious and simple to make too. My ten-year-old, who loves to bake, was able to handle it on her own. Decorated with sprinkles and delectable!

These cookies were by far the best sugar cookies I have ever made. The reason i give them  four stars is because they became crunchy over night( in a tupperwear container). maybe i should have left them out.I'm not saying they weren't good when they turned crunchy though, they still had great flavor. they were nice and chewy when they were first made. these are a good serve right out of the oven cookie.

I've tried many different sugar cookie recipes and this is the one! These cookies are to die for ! I didn't have any cream of tarter so i took another person's advice and used baking power and baking soda. It turned out just as good. Thanks Pam!

Made these yesterday. They were great! Definitely let them sit (in an air-tight container) for a few hours & rest... they taste 100x better! My boyfriend recommended adding white-chocolate chips next time. Great, simple recipe :)

These disappeared fast and everyone enjoyed them. I didn't realize that I was almost out of white flour when I made them, so ended up using half white and half wheat flour. They looked a little bit like peanut butter cookies, but turned out fantastic. From start to finish, we whipped these up in less than 30 minutes. Easy for the kids to help, too.

These are great cookies, no doubt about it.  HOWEVER, I feel they could benefit greatly from a little bit of salt.  Texture-wise and appearance-wise, they're perfect, but they are a tad bland.  This recipe is going into my permanent recipe file, but next time I make them, I'll definitely add some salt.

Growing up, my mother had a cook book that had almost exactly the same recipe. With the exceptions of 2 eggs instead of 3 egg yolk, and the cookies were rolled in sugar. I recently lost the recipe. I added a pinch of ground nutmeg, and they are fantastic. Thank you for posting.

These turned out really great. I put some buttercream icing on top of most of them to jazz them up a bit too.  I also rolled some extra colored sugar sprinkles into them before I put them on the baking sheet. It added a little extra flavor to the ones I didn't ice.

The first batch of these didn't turn out so well.  I had to substitute the butter for margarine, and the dough turned out way too loose.  when they came out of the oven, they covered the whole pan and resembled a cookie cake.  I have to say though, the flavor was awesome.  I also substituted the vanilla flavor for an equal amount of chocolate pudding mix.  I tried again, this time with about a cup of extra flour, and they molded much more easily into those little balls, however, when they came out of the oven this time they were really thick, and hard for the kids to get their mouth around. I think next time if I add the extra cup of flour and flatten the balls a little they might turn out better.  They did crack beautifully though, and the flavor was amazing.

Awesome cookie with the exact texture I was craving. Lost one star because I did want something a tad sweeter so next time I'm going to roll in sugar before I bake. Also, I didnt have any cream of tartar but the cookies still came out really good. Finally a sugar cookie recipe that is soft and delish.

These turned out great - the dough was very crumbly, almost like short bread dough.  But I packed it in my cookie dough scoop and they turned out fine.  Mine didn't turn out as puffy as the picture looks - when they cooled, they flattened out a bit.  And I had to bake it for 12-13 minutes.  Also, I had to be careful because they didn't want to stay in one piece!  I will cut the sugar down to 1C next time, it was a little too sweet for our taste.  Other than that, they remind me of Subway cookies and are very good!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I followed exactly as directed, and they are so moist and chewy with just that little bit of crisp on the edge. I didn't have the cream of tartar, and so used a suggested alternative with 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda. Turned out great!
Also, my dough wasn't quite as workable as the other reviewers, a bit sticky. So I just simply dusted a bit of flour on my hands as I was rolling them and putting onto the cookie sheet. I found that it worked really well.
Great recipe, it's now a part of my collection!

I like the recipe, I gave it 4 stars because they didnt brown on the top or a crack as well, the bottom on some cookies got a little more browned than I thought but overall, great recipe, it would've gone over better if I hadn't have greased the pan too much. Word of advice: Grease it lightly as said on the directions.

This recipe is a tad over hyped IMO. Yes the texture and overall quality of the cookie physically is 5 stars. But the taste leaves something to the imagination...something is just not right. I don't know if it may be too much flour or not enough vanilla but the flavor of the cookie was definitely lacking.

I made them last night (1st time) for the Holiday. Followed the recipe just as is and they came out PERFECT and YUMMY! I rolled them in colored sugar so they looked festive for Christmas :o) I baked them a little longer and the end result was a crisp cookie. For us we prefer a crisp cookie over soft! Thanks for the recipe.

First time I made this recipe, I forgot to separate the eggs and it came out quite runny but still good. On the second batch, I followed the instructions to the T and these came out perfect and looked very professional. I've made these cookies three other times since and they are always a hit. I love snicker doodles, so I roll the dough in a sugar/cinnamon mix before putting them on the cookie sheet. YUMMY!

cookies are so delicious! They did harden quite a bit when they cooled but just pop in the microwave for a few minutes and they are back to fresh-out-of-the-oven soft and chewy! Also, I suggest you flatten the cookie a bit if you don't want lumps of deliciousness :)

I'm somewhat of a health freak, so please consider this when reading my review.    I followed the presented recipe exactly and found that there is far more butter than I care for and that the cookie, though scrumptious lacked either some texture or fullness.  It may be due to the fact that I used a baking soda/powder combo instead of using the creme of tartar (I used 1.75 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder).    In my second batch, I decided to put 3/4 cup of butter instead of 1 cup, and I added some macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips.  THESE COOKIES WERE PERFECT: just crispy enough, more cracked, yet soft, and with texture and richness!    In my second batch, I made

I love these sugar cookies, I don't think i have ever had or made better sugar cookies that weren't store bought with tons of random ingredients, chemicals, preservatives and things you have never heard of haha. They are simple and so good. You should totally make these.

Good. I definitely think they need to be rolled in sugar before baking. I made my first pan without doing this, and they weren't very pretty.

If you're looking for a good, easy, bakery-quality sugar cookie recipe, this is it! I've made lots of sugar cookie recipes in the past, and they have usually turned out either not sweet enough, or too bland, or too crunchy, or too flat, or like a biscuit not a cookie...the list goes on. But these, WOW! It'll be awhile before I try a different sugar cookie recipe. These were perfect...thick, but not "biscuit-y," chewy, but not gooey, and sweet with plenty of flavor. They are great as is--but you could add a little more vanilla or lemon flavoring if you want a little extra zing. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The dough came together very easily and was easy to work with.  I rolled into balls and dipped the tops in different sprinkles for my kids.  They spread perfectly and baked up pretty and round.  They have a nice crispy edge and a chewy center.  The whole family really enjoys these cookies.

These cookies were very easy to make, but I had a little trouble with them. The dough was a bit sticky and hard to mold into balls, and the cookies spread out ALOT more than I thought in the oven, and I only had one pan with sides on it, so I used that pan and a sideless cookie tray. The cookies dripped over the edges of the sideless cookie tray and onto the bottom of my oven and started to burn, and I had to scrape them off with a spatula. The cookies are cooling as I type this, but I snuck one off the tray and they turned out pretty good. I'll definitely have to try this recipe again with a little more flour and make sure I use trays with sides!

These are a flavorful chewy texture cookie. They were a little greasy, but to be expected I guess.  Very enjoyable for how simple they are.

These are great Sugar cookies.  Usually sugar cookies make me sick after a couple of bites.  This one is more like a short bread.  It has nice easy ingredients and the kids loved them.  Husband who hates sugar cookies said these were the best he'd ever had.

Well, I subbed butter flavored shortening for butter since that is all I had, and these were really good. They were harder than I would have liked but I was wondering if that was due to the shortening. Very pretty, cracked, dense cookie.

wow these are an amazing cookie! I did run into an issue with my dough being to crumbly...I added 2 tablespoons of water to my dough and it worked perfect! Also I did have to flatten my cookies with a fork...Other than that these cookies are really yummy and I will be making these forever! Thank you for this great recipe!

These are good. The main suggestion I have is to slightly under cook them near the top of the oven. Once they've cooled, it helps to leave them on the pan for 5 minutes to let them flatten out a bit and finish cooking a bit.

I will make this recipe again.  It was very good and easy to make.  Be sure to add the right amound of flour to make it the right consistency.  At first I didn't add enough flour, and the dough was sticky.  The cookies were still yummy, but they were flat and did not have the "cracked" appearance.  So I added more flour until it had a consistency that I could roll out the dough into balls.  That did the trick, and those cookies turned out thicker and softer.  I think next time I will try rolling it in sugar as my husband suggested it.

this was a very good cookie.  For some reason, it started to burn a little before being fully cooked, but maybe it's just my oven?  Didn't matter, everyone loved eating them slightly underdone inside.  i refridgerated mine for a few hours before baking, maybe that affected the way it baked.  Regardless, the balance of butter & sugar was yummy, and I'll gladly make this one again.  Oh, and i forgot, i added extra vanilla (doubled the vanilla) for extra taste.

Yummy and soft But these are the kind that have that bitter taste in them because of the cream of tartar.  I have to be in the right mood for that kind.  Over all, great cookie, though

I followed this recipe exactly and although these cookies turned out good, I thought they had too much of a buttery than sugar taste. Next time I will try scaling back on the butter and see how they turn out.

Great sugar cookies! Thank you. I sprinkled some sugar on top before I baked and, while it might not have done anything for the taste, it certainly made them pretty.

This cookie was pretty good and I'll give it 4 stars even though I messed them up a little:) So I want to know why my cookies NEVER turn out perfect???? If anybody can help me I would love them so much:) I used coconut flour for the first time today but that's not why they didn't turn out perfect because I used to use regular flour and still the bottoms of every cookie I've ever made turn out too dark and hard while the inside could be not done. Why does this happen???? I turned down the oven temp today to about 325 and still!!!I suck and making cookies!!!!:( I really want to do it right, can anyone help me? Is it my oven??

My cookies spread, which was surprising since so many reviews said that they spread very little.  However, they tasted great.  I rolled them in colored sugar prior to baking and they were festive on cookie trays.

I tried this recipe for the first time, and it came out very dry. Too dry to make into anything. So I added a splash of milk, and the cookies came out like "tea cakes" sweet little cakes that you can eat with your coffee. they were still tasty but didnt quite spread into my heart shaped cookie sheet. So it was ok but not like I expected.

This was a very good sugar cookie recipe! Some of the best I've ever had!  I couldn't find any cream of tartar at the store so I just left it out, and I was a little worried it wouldn't work out... but they were fine! They didn't really crack that much on top but I thought that might have been because I didn't use the cream of tartar.  Just make sure you don't overbake them!

Based on how easy these cookies were to make and how delicious they turned out, I have to give this recipe 5 stars!  I didn't change the basic recipe but I did make 2 different versions of this cookie.  I rolled some in colored sugar before baking and that gave then a nice texture.  I also added dried cherries and chopped pecans to some of the batter and baked these just a bit longer and these had a wonderful flavor!  I would definitely recommend this recipe and feel like there is a million ways to change it to make a variety of cookies.  Have fun with it!

Any recipe that is fool proof when I make it gets five stars!  This was really easy and they turned out not only yummy but pretty!  I've never baked anything that has turned out so good!  I spooned them out on the baking sheets and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar and mmm, mmm good!  Too bad they are for a bake sale.  :(  I guess I'll just have to make another batch!

Best sugar cookie recipe I've ever had!  These cookies turn out similar to Mrs. Field's or Otis Spunkmeyer that you would buy at the mall.  I  would not use these for cutout cookies, but for a round sugar cookie, I will never try another recipe again.

I thought these cookies turned out pretty well overall.  Surprisingly, 11 mins was a good time, 12 mins might even work for these.  I rolled some of the balls in a cinnamin sugar mix to be like snickerdoodles and I ended up liking these the best.  Some I rolled in regular sugar and others I just left as they were, both seemed the same.  I liked them as much as I might like sugar cookies from a grocery store, but they weren't to die for in my opinion...

These may be the best tasting drop sugar cookie recipe that I have come across.  They are very quick and easy to make, and taste just like a bakery cookie.  I sprinkled mine with lavender sugar before baking for a little extra something, and they turned out really well.  I would definitely recommend these and will be making them again.

I prefer the soft rolled sugar cookies but thought I'd try something different this year.  This cookie was ok, some people seemed to really like them as they were quick to disappear.  I thought they tasted store bought, and I usually prefer the "from scatch" flavor of anything baked.  I did not over bake them and I followed the recipe as stated.  They had a slight softness to them.  I just didn't care for them as much as other people did.  I will probably make them again just because others seemed to enjoy them.  Although I only gave it 3 stars, it is a recipe worth trying.  It was very simple to make, which is why I chose to make it.

***Update***I have increased my rating from 3* to 5* because I found just rolling the balls in sugar before baking increases the flavor tramendously!  Enjoy!  I've made this recipe 3x's now and people enjoy them!**another update**fyi, key to the crackled look is to use cold cookie dough.  Room temp will make flat cookies.  This was the 1st time I used a "cookie" size scoop.  I usually make cookies using the smallest scoop, the one that makes scoop sizes for mini muffin pans.  Ended up with flattened, non crackled cookies but that was ok, using cookies to make individual fruit pizzas for dessert for company tomorrow.

I made these exactly as stated in the recipe, and they were so delicious! The vanilla flavor was perfect, and the cookie was absolutely incredible! So, so good! I did roll the balls of dough in sugar before baking them, just because I wanted to and I really liked how they looked and tasted because of it. This recipe is so fantastic, it's going straight to my box of "keepers". Thank you for sharing this!

these are the best suger cookies. I cooked mine longer, I when by the color. they are perfect, I also used 2 eggs other than that I followed the recipe everyone loved them. If you're looking for a good sugar cookie this is the recipe. They are not doughy cook them all the way. If you don't like them you don't like sugar cookies. Easy recipe, thank you so much for sharing.

A very simple recipe! I did not have any cream of tartar, so I used 1/2 tsp of lemon juice...if you don't have lemon juice you can use white vinegar (I used lemon juice because it was for cookies)

soooo goood.   I used colored sugars to help make these cookies more suitable for the Christmas season.  However, you could use any colored sugar to make them suit what your family celebrates!   Merry Christmas!

These are EXCELLENT sugar cookies!  Taste just like bakery cookies.  Even better the next day.  The only change I would suggest is baking a bit less than the recipe states...I'd like mine a bit more soft.  Sooooo good though!

OH EMM GEE!! I don't even like sugar cookies and I could eat an entire batch in one sitting. I didn't have any cream of tartar and instead used 3/4tsp baking soda to go with the 1tsp baking powder. Other than that, I did not change a thing. I will make these cookies again and again and again!!!!

These cookies were fantastic! I couldn't find cream of tartar at the store so I took another reviewer's suggestion, and used 3/4 tsp baking soda instead. I also rolled these in cinnamon/sugar before baking but that's the only difference! My husband said they might be the best cookies he's ever tasted.

LET ME TELL YOU HOW GOOD THEY ARE AS I AM SITTING AT THE COMPUTER EATING MY 4TH ONE!!!!!!! I have been searching for a sugar cookie recipe like this one for who knows how long. I've tried a lot of them out there and this one is by far 2nd to NONE!!!!! I give this recipe 5 stars for the dough alone! and (5)***** more for the turnout! My 2 year old stole mine while I went to get some milk! A side note that I want to add is that I let my  butter(margarine)sit on top of the stove while the oven preheated to help it soften. I didn't have any problem with crumbling at all. Also, I didn't have any vanilla extract so I did substitute it with 1 tspn regular kitchen syrup... yes the kind that you use for pancakes :-) It worked excellent! Ok so for skeptics, please stop browsing and try this one, I just registered today just to give this recipe a 5 * review!

These are really good, made from scratch but easy to make cookies!  I bake a lot of cookies, and these did not disappoint!  I rolled some in sugar, some in sugar/cinnamon/dash nutmeg.  (I used margarine - what I had on hand) The options are endless!  Thanks for the great recipe, Pam.  A keeper.

I liked these cookies a lot. My kids didn't care for them. My son said they were not that sweet. They were very easy to make. I softened the butter a little and I didn't have any problem with them being crumbly as others stated. Mine were actually chewy. This is one of the better sugar recipes that I have tried.

Great cookies...even if you misread the recipe and use egg whites instead of yolks..Ha.Ha.  I did add some additional flour to make them easier to roll/drop since the yolks made the dough a bit sticky.  They were still eaten up without any problem.  I did make a batch the correct way after figuring out my mistake.  They were wonderful.

What a FANTASTIC, easy-to-make, simply wonderful cookie recipe!!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! I changed nothing with the recipe/directions and never will (unless rolling them out for cutters). This will be the only sugar cookie recipe I use from here on out. THANKS PAM!!!!  (now if I can only keep enough around so my husband can try them when he gets home...)

This cookies were simple and delicious.  My kids said they are the best sugar cookies they have ever had.  I thought they tasted great.  They do crumble real easily and that is why I rated a 4.  I put a slice of bread in container to keep them moist.  Will definitely make again.

First off - these cookies are awesome!  Crispy outside, chewy inside!  BUT...I would recommend softening the butter.  I also used salted butter because the recipe didn't have salt in it.  I am not sure what Cream of Tartar actually is, or if has salt in it but either way the cookies turned out great!

These taste very good! My only problem is that the day after they were quite hard. I'm still eating them, they taste good. I just wish they were as "chewy" as others say they are. Perhaps I did something wrong? I'd like to know, so that I can make them again. :)

these were delicious. My dough was very crunmbly when done, but I could press it into balls, so that's what I did. My cookies took 15 minutes in the oven to even begin to brown, so maybe I made mine bigger, but I thought I knew what size a walnut was. Oh well, the end result was delicious. Thanks!

Sugar cookies are my favorite. This recipe is awesome. My only complaint (haha) is that the dough is so good, I kept nibbling at it, resulting in less cookies. Took 13 mins in my oven. No need for icing!

Did it all as written, though like another reviewer, when I was mixing it I just dug in with my hands and kneaded it like bread dough.  I dipped the tops of the balls into a Halloween sprinkle mix and they turned out kind of cute.  Took them to a rehearsal with me and they were highly praised and gone in minutes.

I only gave this recipe 4/5 stars because the cookies were a bit plain. To spice them up a bit, I rolled them in cinnamon sugar like snikerdoodles before baking them. They tasted delicious after that. Also, right after I removed the cookies from the oven I pressed chocolate chips and candy corn in them. The candycorn was very fun and great for Halloween. The recipe said do not flatten the cookies at all before you bake them, leave them in balls but I found that they turned out better if I flattened them just a tiny bit before I put them in the oven. A good cookie, prefect for rolling in cinnamon sugar and making snikerdoodles. Worth making!

Awesome cookies!!!  We love to make cookies, but have never found a good sugar cookie recipe, until now.  We have tried numerous recipes, but they were never spectacular.  We have just bought the tube cookies when we wanted to have sugar cookies.  No more, this will be our "go to" recipe from now on.  The cookies are even better when rolled in colored sugar or cinnamon and sugar.  There really is no need to spray the cookie sheets.  I tried it both ways and had no problems getting the cookies off the sheet.  These will be our Christmas cookies from now on.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

These are fantastic!  No need to grease the pan (there's a cup of butter in there!!), and can drop on sheet with spoons (no need to roll).

This is the BEST sugar cookie recipe I've found.  I add 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract for flavor, and I roll the balls in some raw sugar before baking.  PERFECT!

12 years as professional chef and these kick butt over anything else I tried. Kids scoff them up as soon as they are out of the oven!

Exactly what I was craving in a sugar cookie.  I was up at 1am making these cookies to satisfy my sweet tooth.  They were very easy to make and very tasty!

This is an EXCELLENT drop sugar cookie. Cookies flatten out into nice half-dollar size (or just a bit larger). I hate hate hate rolling out sugar cookie dough, so this recipe is definitely a keeper for great sugar cookies. I agree with other posters-- this doesn't really need frosting, the cookie is sweet enough on its own.

I used this recipe versus the "Chewy Sugar Cookies" recipe in a sugar cookie challenge. The consensus was that "Chewy Sugar Cookie" won. However, this still tasted really good. This was a more stout thick cookie. It's also not that sweet... if I make these again, I'd just up the sugar another 1/4 cup.

By far these are the best sugar cookies I've ever had! I had to give some to the neighbors so I would stop eating them. I rolled them in sugar before baking and flattened slightly.  Oh so good!

Good basic cookie.  I didn't have vanilla extract on hand, so I threw in a bit of clover honey for flavor (now I wish I had added more it was good!).  I only used 2 C of flour, because mine would have been dried out with all of it.

I've made these cookies twice so far and I love them! I used cookie cutters and decorated some for halloween. I thought I made too many but everyone loved them so much and the leftovers lasted for over a week and they were still delicious! I just made one big cookie for the crust of my fruit pizza and it turned out great too! I just doubled the batch, spread it on a cookie sheet and cooked for 15-16min, just until slightly browned on top. Perfect!!

very good.  followed the recipe exactly, although I didn't roll the dough balls, just dropped them onto the sheet.  at 350 in my oven, the cookies needed to bake for almost 15 minutes and the recipe yielded about 3 dozen cookies.  these are nice change of pace from my cake-ier rolled sugar cookie recipe, which is a classic in my family.  I think the recipe would also be great with almond or lemon extract.  I made a powdered sugar glaze with milk and a little bit of butter and dipped the tops in it.  thanks for sharing!

Awesome!!  I didn't have cream of tartar so I used 1tsp baking powder and 3/4tsp of baking soda as another reviewer suggested.  I just balled up the dough in my tbsp and it made exactly 3doz of the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  Will definitely make it over and over.  Thank you!!!

It's amazing how different bakers get such different results in dough and cookie texture!  -So many variables I guess.  We were really happy with the simple easy recipe and yummy result.  Our cookies came out more crispy though; maybe because I used a lower shelf in the oven?  Also, I would definately use salted butter next time; I realized after the cookies were done that they didn't have any salt in them; they need a tad of salt.  We'll keep the recipe to make again!

Awesome recipe. Very easy to follow for anyone with no cooking experience. These taste crisp on the outside and soft inside. Just what I was looking for in a sugar cookie. Try them and these will be the only sugar cookies you'll want to make. Trust me I made a batch and took them to work and everyone loved them. Now I'm making a second batch because of all the request for more. So I wasnt the only one who enjoyed them. A++++ cookies

Buttery loveliness. I did notice that I had to let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before removing them to a wire rack, otherwise they sometimes broke into pieces. Definite 5 star.

These cookies are amazing!!  They are simple and fast to make. My husband said they were his most favorite cookie EVER!!  They are somewhat crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside--perfect!  I rolled mine in sprinkle sugar before I baked them to add an extra pzazz.  By far the best sugar cookie I have ever made and so nice not to have to refrigerate the dough or roll it out.  I had to keep mine in the oven for 13 minutes and they were perfect.  When you take them out the cookies will be very soft.  I left them on the baking stone for a few minutes and then transferred them very carefully to a wire rack to cool.  Simply wonderful cookies!

I LOVE Subway's sugar cookies and for years have been looking for a sugar cookie recipe that can compare....These are the best sugar cookies i've had yet.....very chewy, not cakey.  The only thing i did while making them is use two eggs and the third egg i only used the yolk cause the mixture seemed like it was on the dry side.....I would recommend these to everybody!!!!!!

I must have done something wrong. Because these cookies halfway through (when I looked through the oven) they spread out a lot and looked really mushy.. I did everything according to recipe (besides the tartar.. I looked at another reviewers and substituted as she commented) but yeah.. I don't know if you need to do this recipe quick so it doesn't melt or something.. :(

I like that these came out crispy and chewy, but they are a little too greasy with two sticks of butter.  When you bite into these chewy cookies, all the greasy butter comes out.  It seems a lot of cookies need this amount of butter though.  I think I'll go back to regular butter cookies since I like the texture of those better if I have to use all that butter.

Delish! I'm eating one this moment, and are they ever good! I only had some trouble (maybe not ?) getting the dough right, it ended up with a dippin dot sort of texture, so I needed to really squish the dough together. But in the long run, it was very good!

sadly, i had less of the ingredients than i thought, so i substituted unsalted butter with 1/2 tsp salt for regular butter and 1 tbsp vinegar for one of the egg yolks.  fortunantely, though, they came out amazing and i would definitely do this recipe again, perhaps without the substitutions.

These were great! This is a VERY easy to follow recipe. The cookies produced were crispy on the outside yet chewy and soft on the inside. Just be careful to not leave these in the oven for too long or they become too hard, and you're good to go...yum! :))

awesome cookie! i added 3 tbl of milk to keep the dough from being so crumbly, but it was still difficult to work with. however, it was worth the trouble of crumbly dough!! perfect moist, buttery sugar cookies. i rolled the dough balls in green and red sugar spinkles before cooking, yum!  i have to make another batch because i ate too many with my coffee and dont have enough for my gift bags now. hahaha :)  these are very versatile, i think my next batch may be rolled in cinnamon sugar..mmmm.

I thought these cookies were great, I frosted 1/2 the batch with a butter cream frosting and used sugar on the other 1/2. I liked the frosted ones the best.

Thank goodness I found this recipe!  My son needed cookies for school and I didnt have anymore packaged sugar cookies that he loves.  I made these and they are just amazing.  I will definitely be making these again and again.  Its 12:30 am and I have eaten about 4 cookies so far.  I can't stop eating them. YUM!

We just made two batches of these cookies, and they are simply delicious!  For the first batch, I followed the recipe, but we rolled them in red sugar(holidays).  They were beautiful, moist and delicious.  For the second batch, I ground a whole nutmeg in with the sugar (I wanted a cookie to complement the egg nog).  Delicious!

These are by far the best homemade sugar cookies I have ever tasted. The next time I will try lemon extract instead of vanilla to give it a lemony flavor.  *update*  I had a sweet tooth and came across this recipe in my recipe box. I forgot how good these cookies are. They taste just like a brand named refridgerated sugar cookie dough.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe that I've found so far...and believe me I've made many batches of sugar cookies. I only made one adjustment which I think gives this cookie a 5 star rating. In addition to the vanilla extract I add Princess cake and cookie flavoring that you can get from KINGARTHURFLOUR online. Once you try this flavoring you will never use anything else. It gives the cookies that fresh bakery taste which is nutty and gives it awonderful citrus flavor. Try it! I bet you'll love it! My daughter and I also rolled them in red and green sprinkles. I think they definately need to be rolled in some type of sugar either granulated or colored sprinkles. Enjoy!

This is seriously the BEST sugar cookie recipe in the world!!!  Not only are the super easy to make...but they are perfect in every way!  Tip:  Use a leveled out tbsp to achieve exactly 48 cookies!  I made half as is and rolled the other half in cinnamon sugar...yum to both!  It's a hit with kids and makes for the perfect Christmas cookie made days in advance!

VERY good...but double the recipe!  They don't go far!  Very easy to make.  We (my 4 year old and I) rolled them (sprinkling doesn't work as well) in red & green sugar sprinkles and some white sugar...festive and excellent.

Yummmm!!! These are delicious. My second batch is getting ready to come out of the oven, I ate most of the the first batch. I have only one suggestion though if you decide to make these, make a double batch!! They are that good.

I LOVED this cookie!  I followed this recipe to a tee and the cookies came out perfect!  Just as many other described, the chewy middle was the best part!  I also used "Sugar Cookie Frosting" from this site and had a blast decorating the cookies with a holiday theme.  Will pass this recipe on and I will definitely use it again!  Thanks!

Fantastic! I have made these a couple times now and they always come out great. I don't have cream of tarter so I took Melanies advise and substituted 1 teaspoon of baking powder & 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda.

This recipe was wonderful!  I followed the directions exactly and came out with perfect cookies!  They were just the correct consistency, nice and chewy, and had a great buttery taste.

This was a good recipe, the flavor was excellent, though I added a little more nutmeg. I think the dough was too moist and the cookies settle too much while baking, so these aren't think cookies but they are delicious.

Mmmm.. These were so good.
I had a little bit of trouble with the dough being all crumbly though, so it took me longer than I thought it would to roll them into little balls.
But besides that, they tasted great and they're the right texture and everything :)

This recipe was good.  I actually like my sugar cookies sweeter but I liked the consistancy of the dough in this recipe.  BF liked them!  I'll will make these again.  :)

These cookies were great.  They came out just like the picture shows...cracked.  The dough was perfect to roll into the balls and mine baked up in 13 minutes.  It all depends on your oven.  I'm already planning on making these for Christmas.  Yummy!!

Nice sugar cookie.  I will make them again.  I may reduce the amount of sugar next time.  I found the cookie to be very sweet.  I also found that a slightly longer baking time produced a better cookie.  It may just have been my oven.

I absolutely love these cookies!! I have not had a problem ever making them and they always turn out great. Gave a few to a co worker and started trouble. Now everyone wants some. Too bad, I have to save them all for myself!

I have searched high and low for the perfect sugar cookie and this is by far the best! My sons love these cookies, very soft center, full of flavor! I roll them in sugar or a cinnamom sugar mixture before baking. Just a wonderful recipe thank you!!!!! And, they don't get stale before you're done eating them!

Used this recipe to go with Fruit Pizza 2 recipe from this site, as I could not find refrigerated sugar cookie dough for the crust.  This worked wonderful.  Try the fruit pizza and use this as your crust.  You won't be disappointed!

Perfect quick sugar cookie.  I rolled them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before I dropped them on the cookie sheet and it made the original cookie even better, give it a try!

Delicious! These taste like the Pillsbury sugar cookies! I'm not sure if I added too much flour, but the dough was very crumbly. cookies were still nice and moist and tasted great, though! Thanks!

Easy, great tasting and texture-wise incredibly good! Try this tip I got from a friend to keep cookies from going stale in a few days (if there are any left!): put a slice a bread on top of the cookies when you store them. It keeps them from getting rock hard.

Very very good!  It's a little on the thick side and soft in the middle. 

I refrigerated my dough for about an hour before baking, and this made it easy to roll into balls.  Some I rolled in white sugar, some I rolled in cinnamon and sugar.  Both were very tasty. Quick and easy, a recipe you'll reach for time and again.

Delish, delish, delish!!! Have made this at least 3 times, will make again and again.  Love it that you don't have to roll them.  Cracked like they were supposed to and were slightly chewy but soft.  Thanks, Pam!

I don't know how anyone managed to get gooey dough or over-spreading with these. Mine were *stiff*, I barely managed to stir in all the flour, and they didn't flatten enough. A bit fragile when they come out of the oven. Otherwise very nice. I didn't have enough plain flour left, but self-raising (omitting baking soda & cream of tartar) worked fine.

Incredibly easy to make.  I made the six layer coconut cake from this site earlier today and had the yolks left over from that, so I went looking for a way to use them up.  My son requested sugar cookies as well as the cake for his birthday so VOILA!  I doubled the recipe and added some grated lime zest.  They came out great, and my two kids (the official 'taste testers') gave them two thumbs up!

I'm probably not the best person to rate this...I'm a chocolate chip kind of girl.  But...these were good for sugar cookies.  There weren't dry at all and cracked like they were supposed to.  My kids loved them!

These are by far the BEST sugar cookies I've ever made or had for that matter!  I followed the recipe but also rolled them in sugar before baking.  Next time I will try a little cinnamon as well.  Thanks!

Wonderful!!!!   I was skeptic, because I didn't have any vanilla, but they still came out great.  I just love how soft they are.

These cookies are really easy to make and have the perfect level of sweetness. They take about 5 minutes to make and taste amazing. The dough was a bit dry and did not stick together well. Also they take longer then  10 minutes bake and I have a convection oven. Otherwise they taste really well.

My friends and I made this for a X-Mas party but didn't have tartar sauce--IT DIDN'T MATTER!  The cookies were AMAZING!  By far the best sugar cookies I've ever had.  They didn't last 10 minutes!

YUMMY!  These soft little cookies are so good.  They are just as soft on the second and third day as they are on the first.  That's how I like my sugar cookies!  I'm not the only one who adores them.  I have had many requests for this simple recipe.

These cookies were easy to make and delicious.  Perfect for when you want a sugar cookie, but don't feel like rolling out the dough and using cookie cutters.  I didn't have cream of tartar and I used Susiehomemaker's substitution and it was great.  Thanks!

These are the first cookies to be made in
my new Gemini oven, had 3 batches whipped
up and done in less than 30 minutes...they are just
delicious! My husband rolled them in sugar as I made them because he said all sugar cookies have to have sugar on them.
This will be one of our faves! Thanks!

REVISED:  I ate some of these cookies for breakfast and they were awesome.  I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that review last night.  The cookies are soft in the middle, crispy around the edges.  They aren't too sugary and they have a hint of vanilla.  YES, I'll be making these again.

I made these for a second time and added the ingredients at the wrong time and they did not crackle on top, but they were still very good.  The best cookie recipe if you want a great sugar cookie with a buttery flavor.  I baked them at 300 degrees for 8-10 minutes because I like them just lightly browned on the bottoms.  An easy cookie to make and everyone ate them all soon after they came out of the oven !  My daughter said this is her favorite sugar cookie recipe.

VERY good recipe! If my oven weren't so hot the first batch would have been awesome...but after adjusting the temp and making the ball-size a little bigger they turned out awesome.  Also, I should have read the "most helpfuls" before beginning - I would have taken out the first batch at 10 min even though they didn't look quite done.  They are EXCELLENT just a little dough-y!!!

Well, I have taken my first batch out of the oven and they are cooling, and have another batch in right now. They are chew and soft, and I need to leave them in about a minute longer. I had to add extra flour, about another cup. I used butter spread (country crock) and it is working great. I also don't have baking soda but doubled the amount of baking powder and there seems to be no problem.

Pretty good recipe. I used this recipe to make decorated cut out Christmas cookies. They tasted great with some Duncan Hines icing. I did not have cream of tarter so I used the suggestion of baking power and baking soda on a previous review.

Excellent cookie! Quick and easy to make. Very soft and light. I rolled these cookies in colored sugar while forming, and they are very enjoyable. 
I am new to baking, and I found this recipe to be very easy to understand and follow.I'll definitely make these again!

These are absolutely the BEST sugar cookies I've ever made!!  I chose the recipe because I didn't have to chill the dough, so it was less time consuming.  I made no changes, baked them for 10 minutes, and they came out PERFECT!!  My search for the best sugar cookie recipe is finally over!

The batter for these cookies was fantastic tasting.  Although, after baking my cookies tasted like eggs.  I tried to add a little more sugar and flour for the next batch but still had the same problem.

They were not the best cookies. Cream of Tarter? What were you thinking! Joking. I loved them.

This recipe was wonderful!  The cookies turned out great and so soft.  The best part is not having to roll out the dough.  It was so easy making these with my 5 year old daughter who loves to help in the kitchen.  I did have to sub baking powder for the cream of tartar & baking soda, but they still turned out perfect!!

The PERFECT sugar cookie. And after they bake they are just too pretty to even *think* about putting icing onto! The only revision I made was rolling the dough in sugar before putting them onto the pan.. Just for apperance purposes.. Although, they would be just as pretty without the twinkle of the added sugar. Fantastic recipe. Very simple. Very quick. PERFECT results.

plz do not pass these cookies up! My daughter kept going on and on about these.  The only alteration was using stick butter instead of shortening. FABULOUS!

This is an amazing sugar cookie recipe! It has just the right amount of flavor and a wonderful texture and soft center. It's wonderful! I've made these 3 or 4 times now and I just love them! Try making bite sized ones--they're perfect little snacks!

I needed a recipe to use the 12 egg yolks left over from Chocolate Angel Food Cake II.  Sugar cookies are my favorite!  These turned out great.  They are soft and chewy.  I was a little surprised as the consistency of the dough, but they baked very nicely.  Just a few ingredients - all of which I had in the cupboard.  I actually made a quadruple batch to use all the yolks and froze the extra in little portions.  I can't wait to have another one with my lunch!  Thanks for posting such a quick easy recipe!

By far the best sugar cookie I have ever made.  I roll them in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet to make them look more like a true sugar cookie.

The best sugar cookie recipe I have found!  I did use 2 whole eggs instead of 3 egg yolks and they turned out perfectly.  I'm keeping this one... been looking for a while for a good recipe with just the right flavor.  (I didn't roll them out- I used the drop method)

Although I was looking for a different kind of recipe, this is one that I will save.  To me, this cookie taste exactly like the Keeble Pecan Sandie cookie, without a doubt.  My husband said the same thing.  So, if your looking for the Keebler Sandie cookie, this recipe is it.  I give this recipe 5 stars because someone may want the Keebler cookie recipe and this would be it.

This recipe is wonderful! The texture was perfect. I actually used it to make lemon cookies by replacing the vanilla extract with lemon extract and then topping them off with a lemon frosting. Tasted great! My boyfriend liked them so much he kept burning his mouth because he didn't want to wait for them to cool!

Easy, yummy cookies.  I gave the kids a shallow bowl for them to shake a variety of colored sugars/ sprinkles into.  Then they rolled the balls in sprinkles before we put them on the cookie sheets.  Definitely made it more fun for them and the cookies turned out pretty!

What did I do wrong? This looks and sounds exactly what I'm looking for. I  doubled the recipe and they came out a mushy flat mess. They spread out too much and had burnt edges.

Just what I was looking for. Easy & delicious! No chilling, easy rolling. I use a small scoop, then roll by hand. We frosted and added non-pareils.

I mostly think sugar cookies are too hard and too bland but these were pretty good.  I used 3 t of baking powder because apparently my husband chunked my baking soda but they were still good.

These are THE perfect sugar cookie. They beat out any other rolled or drop sugar cookie out there. Not only do they LOOK perfect but they taste it, too. Buttery, chewy and just a hint of vanilla. I made half of these plain and mixed in about 1/4 or 1/3 cup of crushed candy canes to half of the dough and made them into pretty peppermint cookies. They were delicious both ways, and they look awesome. I thought I'd found good sugar cookie recipes in the past, but this one is the real keeper.

A bit too eggy, but pretty good.  Make sure to add extra sugar on top when they're fresh out of the oven.
