These are very good and a great alternative when you're tired of making the ol' standby chocolate chip cookies.  I tried these to take to a cookie exchange and was very happy with the results.  I made them for the second time today and added 1/4 tsp. more baking soda and chocolate chips.  The extra baking soda made them stand up better and they didn't flatten out, as my first batch had turned out rather flat, although still soft and chewy. The chocolate chips made this batch top notch!

I used one whole egg instead of two whites, it was just easier. These are luscious little cookies. I'll have to hide them in the freezer if I want any left to give away. NOTE: I find that using three of the full-sized bars is plenty. I think I like butter in these cookies better than the margerine and Sunny is right. Let these cool for a couple minutes before pulling them of the sheet. Also, do not use a natural or really cheap peanut butter. Try to stick with Jif or Skippy if you can. Otherwise, the cookies will be awful.

Used Halloween candy miniatures--three miniature bars to equal one regular bar.

I thought these would taste like garden variety peanut butter cookies, but they really do taste like Butterfingers.

We enjoyed the chewy texture of the unaltered recipe.

These are amazing!!  Use only one egg. Dont be wasteful. They taste great. And I used a heaping 1/2 tsp of baking soda.(prob about 3/4 tbs) I've made them twice this week and they only last about a day. I didn't have as many butterfingers as I thought. So I added resses and white chocolate chips. Then the second time I used only peanut butter cups, mini m+m's and white chocolate chips. They were sooo good. Its a great base peanut butter cookie and add what ever you want. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Great Cookie idea!  I used 5th Avenue bars added an extra 1/4 t of baking soda, refrigerated overnight, and baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  Then I let them cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before moving to the cooling rack.  Made about 36 soft and chewy cookies.  Next time I might add one of the egg yolks as my dough was pretty crumbly.  Very delicious!

I made these and had no problems. I got a lot of compliments on them.  I also found this recipe with the purpose of getting rid of Halloween candy.  

I think chilling the dough is very important.

Turned out great! I used 1 c creamy peanut butter (all I had left) and 16 fun sized Butterfingers.   I'm also at high altitude, so I increased the oven temp to 375 and they turned out soft and chewy and not too flat.

Pretty good! Just want to reiterate what several other reviews have said: DON'T LEAVE THEM IN THE OVEN FOR MORE THAN 10-12 MIN!! They won't look done after that amount of time, but take them out anyway. They'll firm up as they cool. Learned that the hard way with my first horribly burnt batch...

Once I got the cook time down, the non-burned finished product was quite tasty-- though, honestly, I think the raw dough tasted better than the cookies themselves.

Really great.... I think that 5 butterfingers would be way too many though.  I used about 3.  Delicious.

Sorry but these were such a weird consistancy that I would never make these again. They were totally flat even after adding more baking soda. The butterfinger pieces gave these a weird chewy consistence and not good chewy. :(

If you like peanut butter cookies, you will LOVE these! I took others suggestion and added 1/4 tsp baking soda and chill the dough for stand-up cookies. The only reason I didn't rate this recipe higher is because when you cook the butterfingers, they become tacky and the cookies lose their "softness". Great base pb cookie! I will just add a different candy next time.

Awesome cookies!!! I've made these twice already and my whole family LOVED them. The only thing was that I had to add alot of extra flour because even if you use just the egg whites, it doesn't get that cookie dough texture that it needs, it was more like a batter. So take my word for it, you're gonna need alot of extra flour. And don't use the whole egg. Other than that they were delish. Me and my dad's favorite cookies!!! : )

Okay recipe....not great, but not bad, just okay.  I made the recipe as stated, the cookies were chewy in the inside and oily.  I was expecting great things with the Butterfingers Candy Bars but was disappointed.

very easy to make and a great way to use up Halloween candy.   they are a great peanut butter cookie.   You can make these without the butterfingers candy bars.   

I made the recipe exactly as written and they were great.

WOW.... so chewy and soft and delicious... and so so incredibly unhealthy wow... but they do taste really good... I added the extra baking soda like other suggested... I did not add chocolate chips though but I am sure that would be good... I used creamy peanut butter because that is what I had and they still turned out wonderful.... better than the sugar cookie based ones I made before...

Followed recipe and the cookies came out perfectly.  I used three regular size Butterfingers (the kind you find in the checkout isle)and crushed them in the food processor ... also added a half cup of chocolate chips.  Delicious.

Sweet with lots of peanut butter flavor. Didn't have chunky peanut butter on hand. Used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1/4 of a cup of peanut M&Ms. Floured the cookie scoop often as the dough was super sticky. My cookies came out flatter than other cookies I make. My family enjoyed these.

VERYsweet, but tasty.  I doubled because I started it like a choc chip cookie with 2 sticks of butter...before reading through.took about 14 m ins at 350 but they were big...9/pan and not crowded.

I followed the directions exactly and they were delicious.  But I made exactly 48 cookies.  Using chunky peanut butter gives it a great texture.

Instead of making cookies I doubled the recipe and put them into two 9 X 9 square pans and made bars. I baked them for about 25-30min and although they looked quite doughy when I took them out, they set up very nicely and were delicious! I also added some chocolate chips to them. Will be making these again! Everyone loved them!

Wonderfully delicious cookies!! I meant to follow the recipe exactly except for using one whole egg instead of two egg whites but I also accidentally changed the sugars by mixing up my measuring cups. I ended up using 1 cup (1/3 x 3) of white sugar and 1/2 cup (1/4 x 2) of brown sugar. The result was nice, thick, chewy cookies. Love them, thanks for a nice new addition to my recipe box.

This were pretty good.  The butterfingers are a little chewy in the cookie and they didn't flatten out when cooked so I used a fork to make a criss-cross pattern in them after they had baked for 5 min.  Not to die for cookies but pretty good.

I made with creamy peanut butter (didn't have crunchy on hand) and these were really good and peanut-buttery!  Too sweet for DH, though.

Wow!  These are really good!  I think I just found my new favorite peanut butter cookie.  They are not dry and crumbly like most but kind of crispy-chewy with a nice rich flavor.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky since that is what we like.

These cookies are a hit!! My daughter made them and entered them in the county fair and won first place. We made them again doubling the recipe, except we used 7 butterfinger bars and added a bag of butterscotch chips, my daughters idea, and they were terrific. They were a hit at the family reunion. Highly recommend for any butterfinger fans!!

I started out by halving everything (except I used one whole egg; white and yolk) for this recipe.  I still yielded 24 decently sized cookies (approx. 3 and 1/2" diameter).  I did as other reviewers suggested and added additional baking powder--1  and 1/4 tsp.  I also added another 1/4 cup of flour, as the batter was a little too "soft".  I used a smooth, reduced fat Kraft peanut butter - not sure if this made a difference.  These cookies spread a bit and are on the thin side, but chewy and delicious.  They're plenty sweet, so I may cut down on the amount of sugar next time.  Baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.   I know I'll be making these again soon...so yummy!

These were fantastic cookies, I made them for the guys at work and they just loved them.  I used an organic peanut butter but did use baby ruth bars in place of the butterfinger (picked up the wrong bars at the store).  The recipe certainly is a keeper!

Definitely needs 1/2 tsp. more of baking soda. Other than that, they are great :) Even our flat ones were soft and chewy. Thanks!

Yum!!!! I made with creamy peanut butter. Really nice and rich! Definately don't keep in for any longer than 10-12 min. though, even if they don't look done. I made that mistake on my first batch and burned the bottoms :(

I also used creamy pb in this instead of chunky, and took about a cup of honey-roasted peanuts and chopped them up and tossed them in.  Also used self-rising flour, thus omitting the need to add baking soda.  Left the salt out, too, as the peanuts and peanut butter contained quite enough.  These are fantastic.  : )

These were pretty good.  The taste was pretty much the same as a peanut butter cookie just a little saltier.  I did not have a problem with mine flattening out, in fact my problem was just the opposite.  Mine wouldn't get flat at all!  No need for the extra baking soda here, and next time I will cut back on the flour as well.  I will be making these again and I agree these would make a great base for PB cookies, also I do not care for peanuts in my cookies so I will be using smooth PB next time.  All in all, pretty good recipe.

Unbelievable.  My husband is a butterfinger junkie, and he adored these.  I also brought some to work and they disappeared.  I do think next time I'll try it with the additional 1/4 tsp baking soda to see if it gives them any height (they are very flat).  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were pretty good. I had to hide them from my daughter who is allergic to peanut butter (I made her some Chewy Coconut Cookies). The only problem I had was with the center of the Butterfinger bars. They melt to form a hard/chewy  candy layer on the outside of some of the cookies. I picked it off, and the rest of the cookie was great.

The recipe only uses 1 cup of flour to all the other ingredients that turn to liquid.  The bottoms of the cookies were gooey even after adding 2 min. to the maximum cooking time.  I had to toss two dozen away and managed to save one dozen by raising the oven temp. to cook the bottom.  And, yes, my oven temp is correct and I have a thermometer hanging in there to prove it.  The good thing is I got rid of the leftover butterfinger bars from Halloween.

There are a couple of good tricks for these cookies. 1. Cover the dough and put it in the fridge to firm up before rolling into balls. 2. They must be completely cool before you eat them. A lot of people like fresh chocolate chip cookies hot from the oven. This is not that kind of cookie and I've found that most people do not like the taste of these when they are still warm. Completely cooled, these are awsome!

Excellent! Don't change a thing!! Baking time closer to 10 minutes will keep the cookies soft when they cool, closer to 12 minutes will give you a crunchy cookie when cooled. These cookies are flat, like the kind you buy at the food court @ the mall.

I thought these cookies were good.  I made them because they reminded me of my Dad, who loved Butterfinger candy bars.  I will keep the recipe on hand and probably make them again sometime in the future when I want something a little different than more common cookies.

These were the best cookies I have ever tasted!  My husband took the batch to work and several there said the same thing.  This is my new 5* recipe to take to pot-lucks!

I made these for a week-end away with friends and they were a big hit. I used 1 egg instead of the two egg whites, and three chocolate bars (that's all I had, but the flavour was excellent). I followed the method as written. The recipe made 4 1/2 dozen.

These were fun to make with my sister she loved them better than chocolate chip cookies.
