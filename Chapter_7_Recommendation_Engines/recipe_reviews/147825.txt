I really liked these cookies, but I think they would be better described as a biscuit rather than a cookie.  I did change a few things though.  The first time I made them I used ground flaxseed (1 tbls of flax plus 3 tbls of water for each whole egg) and they turned out great.  Also, I'm not a fan of using margarine or butter, therefore I substituted applesauce for the butter.  Because the applesauce was already sweet, I needed only half the sugar.
