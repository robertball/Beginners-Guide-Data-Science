The cooking times caused my $12 roast beef to overcook. I would suggest lowering the temp and cooking at that same temp.

On it's own, this recipe wasn't that great.  However, I mixed an equal amount of Crystal Light lemonade with the italian dressing and it was great!!  I think the lemonade really made the dish, because it had a whole different flavor than the last time I made it without lemonade.

Yummy, I followed your recipe for marinating but put my meat on my rotiserie (?).  My family and I enjoyed the outcome very much.  Thanks Kathleen for sharing a very tasty recipe.

The smell was encouraging, but I did not care for this recipe.

Smells good cooking, but it has an awful taste. The italian dressing overwhelms the whole dish. It's all you can taste, will never make this again- waste of time and money.

Not bad! I used a homemade version of Italian dressing, which had lots of fresh basil, oregano, hot peppers, lemon juice, and an onion.  I cooked it as instructed in a tagine. I went to cut it and it literally fell apart when touched by a fork. I never even used a knife. It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Thank you for the recipe.
