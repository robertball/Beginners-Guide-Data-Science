was so good....forgot to buy heavy cream but milk and butter did the job. Definitely will add more shrimp and was just as good reheated. used linguini.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have heavy cream I used fat free half and half and added a package of light cream cheese to help thicken the sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe. I served it (untried before) to company and they raved. I know I probably shouldn't rate when I made the changes but I have to say it was very good. Thank you for the recipe. Debbie

Fantastic substitutions due to availability including half and half canned drained diced tomatoes by Rotel more shrimp cause we like it! This is ideal as a sauce for other seafood!

this is really a great recipe. very little was left. all I did different was some additional shrimp added bay scallops and imitation crab meat chunks. needed 2 tsp. of flower to thicken it up. definately a hit.

Used diced tomatoes out of my garden. Only change I made was to add bay scallops as well as shrimp. The sherry makes it! Making it again tonight with frozen diced cooked tomatoes from my garden last summer. We love it!

15 minutes was too long for the delicate shrimp.
