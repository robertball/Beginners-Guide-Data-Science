This recipe is REALLY good!  So easy to make and is superb on a chilly day!  Wait.  Chili Day.  :-) I added a LOT more chili powder than what the recipe called for.

This was simple and tasty.  I used it in a simple chili cook-off and received great reviews.  Added a few extras on top to make it more my own, but the core recipe made for a great building block.

I really like quick recipes and this is definitely a keeper. I am not a chili fan at all but I saw this recipe and decided to try it, I did the recipe exactly as it stated, I even used the shredded cheese and served with rice. It was very tasty and I loved it. My son who is 4 also liked it and said the house smelled good while I was cooking....only change I will make on the next time is a little more chili powder but its definitely an easy, quick, and good way of getting a whole meal in one pan.

Pretty good chilli... I made this for my family and we all thought it was great. It's quick and easy. Perfoct for a last minute meal. The only changes I made were using onion powder instead of a chopped onion (I don't like biting into onions), I also added a small can of diced tomatos (to add a little texture and hearty-ness), and i added a little dash of sugar.. : ) YUM YUM!!

This is a very easy recipe. That said, it is a very bland recipe. Because it uses spaghetti sauce it sort of tastes like spaghetti sauce with beans in it. You'd be better off using canned tomatoes and tomato sauce then adding some cumin and salt or whatever your taste buds think chili should taste like.
