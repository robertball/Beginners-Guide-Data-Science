Made the exact recipe. The dish was bland. My thinly sliced potatoes required an additional 15min in the oven for all to be cooked through. DH did not eat seconds.

Potatoes are cut thick and not thin otherwise you will have muchy potatoes. Bake the potatoes for an additional 20 minutes. I love the taste!!

Not bad but I added shredded cheddar bacon bits thawed frozen broccoli a package of ranch seasoning and some diced onion. Might also be good with some cayenne or hot sauce. Still relatively easy and MUCH more flavorful. Hardly worth waiting over an hour for the recipe as written no offense.

I followed the recipe and added dry onion soup pack plus a handful of bacon bits. I made my potatoes slices thick so it had to be cooked an extra 15 minutes. Will definitely make it again.

I made it as instructed (cut the potatoes thin and I liked them that way) except for sprinkled with onion powder salt and pepper. It wasn't bad but could use more seasoing the next time. Very easy!

So easy. So delicious. The whole family loved it. No changes needed for this recipe. It can be made a couple days ahead of time. It seemed to get better with each day.
