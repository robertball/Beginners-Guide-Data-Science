The recipe should have been "1 small onion" also using red onion makes for nicer presentation however if you use a red onion they tend to be very large so I would suggest half the onion...

Very yummy!  I would suggest cutting back on the onion a little, but other than that, the salad was wonderful!

This was a great seafood salad. I used tuna instead of crab or the old bay seasoning but it still turned out wonderful and im looking forward to making this again! Using red onion was a good choice with this recipe along with lemon pepper.

This was great. I used 1 small onion, and 1/2 a medium sized green pepper. I also added in 1/4 cup of Old Bay seafood seasoning, along with ground black pepper, parsley, and a pinch of lemon-pepper seasoning.  It was great. I served it with butter lettuc. I will most surely frequent allrecipes.com for more tasty recipes such as this one.  I think that the key is, if you have been cooking long enough, then you can kinda tweak any recipe to your own liking.  The addition of the Old Bay gave it the taste I was going for!

I have mixed feelings about this.... I was expecting more flavor. All I could taste was celery and onion (I omitted the bell pepper called for). Couldn't taste the shrimp, crab, mayo, dill or Old Bay seasoning (I added a dash for flavor). I think  something was missing... a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, more dill or sweet imitation crabmeat would have done the trick, I'm sure. Another reason for my low rating was due to texture - mine seemed kinda soupy (not really soupy, but enough to make me not care for this). Served on a croissant with a side of potato chips, this made a quick weeknight meal. I don't think I'll be bringing leftovers with me to work this week though. I should have tried Crab Salad by Christine as it seems to better suit my taste (and seems more like the deli stuff I like at my local grocer). Thanks anyways!

This is so good. The flavors mixed well. I used a whole small onion. I thought it was perfect. We ate it on pita bread and crackers. It would even be great on a tossed salad. I will be taking this to our Easter gathering.

This was good-but not amazing. It does taste very similar to the typical seafood salad you can buy at the meat counter of your local grocery store. If this is what you are looking for then this recipe is for you!

This wasn't quite the seafood salad I was hoping for, but it was still quite pleasant, especially when heaped atop a Ritz cracker and served with pickled items.  The green bell pepper and onion was a bit overwhelming; my recommendation would be to use half of each.  If you're craving more of a deli-style seafood salad, use imitation crab in place of the fresh crab meat, or mix in a bit of baker's sugar with the Worchestshire sauce prior to adding to the dressing.

This shrimp salad is simply the best! Just to kick it up a notch, I added a little chopped bacon & a pinch of Penseys Parisien Bonnes Herbes. I made sure to finely chop the celery after peeling off the stalk "strings" and I used 3 eggs, not 2.  I also used sweet onion (I've done this with green onions; they work great too).  I just love this recipe!  It's so simple and easy!!!  Perfect!!!

This is exactly what I was looking for. It is excellent. I used 3 green onions instead of a white or red onion, including as much of the green stem as was good, and crab/pollock sticks (from the deli) instead of pure crab meat. Very good. This will be a lunch staple for me.

Excellent recipe EXCEPT for the onion. I love onion and using only half of a Vidalia was still heavy on flavor. I eased off on the green bell pepper too, probably using only half. We had plenty of shrimp in the freezer, but no crab, so I used Orange Roughy instead. (If you're unfamiliar with this fish, it has a similar texture and flavor to crab/lobster.) Once all the mayo, onion, pepper, celery and seasonings were mixed in, it blended in beautifully. I added some Old Bay too. Good stuff for a cool, summertime lunch! Will definitely make again.

Not bad. After sitting in the refrigerator and having the flavors 'marry' this was a pretty good salad. Way too many onions but I don't like them anyway

I did not have dill or crabmeat on hand but I improvised for a quick girls luncheon choice and it was great.  I am sure it would have been better with all the ingredients !

The basic recipe is great.  I personally would put the dill down the insinkerator and use any other Herb.  I used basil ...good
Cilantro....better yet.

The recipe, followed closely, resulted in a very tasty dish, but a bit on the bland side. I liberally applied Tobasco Habanero to left-overs, with, to me, pleasing results.

Not the most awesome thing ever, but it's doable and has lots of potential for tweeking.  I didn't change much; I had a red (purple) onion already on hand so I used about  third of it, taking the advice of a few people that onion was a bit overwhelming. I also completely forgot to buy a bell pepper but did have small colorful sweet peppers on hand so I used three little ones. I used the exact amount of crab and shrimp the recipe calls for but I think it certainly wouldn't hurt to add a couple more ounces of each just so  you can taste the shellfish. I liked that someone else put old bay seasoning in but I'll do that next time because I wanted to see how everyone else liked it before making major changes.

I cut back a bit on the onion and it was absolutely delicious! My teenage daughter isn't big on "seafood salad" type things, but she LOVED this and so did I. We had it with crackers  and it was fantabulous!! Thanks for the recipe!
