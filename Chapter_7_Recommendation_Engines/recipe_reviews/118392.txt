This was a real disappointment for both hubs and me. Another reviewer said it perfectly when she wrote that the flavors "didn't mesh well." That's it in a nutshell. Not only was it it an ill-matched combination of onions, almonds and Parmesan cheese, but it seems even in unison none of these ingredients is a good complement to fish let alone all three. And as for the Parmesan, it lent an unpleasant, almost sour taste to the mild flavored fish. We found this just barely edible and neither of us even finished our serving.

This one is really good, specially with fish-picky people.  The flavours melt right in to create a really classy dish that you do not want to miss.  I have tried it also with different herbs if dill is not your choise.  A must is to substitute the mayo with souer cream, the difference in the quality is outstanding and way more welcome...add it to your recipe box!!! yo-om

This was so good- we really enjoyed it.  I only had low-fat mayo so I used that. I added some old bay.  I also used tilapia because it's one of the only available fishies in my po-dunk area.  This had such great flavor and was simple to make.  I loved the onions- they were cooked to a perfect tenderness too.  I toasted the almonds in the oven for 2 minutes while the butter was melting.  We had this with Garlic Parmesan Orzo from this site, and broccoli.  I mixed some of the onions up with my orzo.  It was all so good!  My 5 year old loved it too.

This dish was excellent!  I'm not much of a fish eater, but my husband is so I am always looking for a good fish dish that isn't too 'fishy'.  We both enjoyed it.  The only addition I made was to add a crushed garlic clove to the mayo/cheese mixture.  To toast the almonds, melt about a tablespoon of butter in a skillet, drop the almonds in, and stir until they are golden brown.  Turn the heat off and stir in a a little bit of lemon juice.  Top off the fish with the almonds and enjoy it!  YUMMY!

This was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. My husband couldn't get enough. We used cod and it was so moist. We followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully. Looks like a restaraunt dish.

This is the best parmesan-crusted fish i have ever had. My boyfriend agrees. I added some dried basil and garlic powder to it.

What a great recipe! I used (lots) of fresh dill, subbed sour cream for the mayo, and topped with lots of sliced almonds that I'd browned. Oh, and omitted the parsley. Whole family (DH & girls ages 8 & 9) agreed it was great. Can't wait to make this again! We used cod.

I agree, there are a lot of cheese/mayo baked fish recipes out there, but the dill and almonds in this one really makes it stand apart. It turned out a little salty but I think I may have been a little too enthusiastic with the Cavender's seasoning salt. Nice recipe - quick, easy, and lots of flavor. Thanks!

WOW!  This is the best!  I used tilapia, my favorite fish. My husband is in complete agreement!  I also put down a bed of frozen spinach, thawed and slightly squeezed dry, then the onions, then fish and followed the directions. It was wonderful!  Enjoy!

This can be adjusted with less/more of lemon, parm cheese, dill. These are the "standout" flavors.  The best fish entree I've made.

This was fabulous!! My very finicky daughter asked for seconds. I did not measure anything, but I did use Penzey's 4S seasoned salt.  This will be a healthy regular at our house!

This was very tasty...and I used Whiting - so whatever can get this cheap fish to taste great is a winner in my book. I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and added oregano. Great recipe - thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The fish was so buttery and creamy and just melted in my mouth. I actually forgot to add the almonds...I dont even think they are necessary but then I guess it wouldnt be called Almond Topped Fish

I used Dover Sole for this but I think it would be best with a meatier fish since sole is a bit delicate.  It was, however, very tasty and quite easy to prepare.

If I owned my own restaurant I would serve this dish.  It is fantastic!  I want to try it next time with sour cream instead of mayo to see if it still tastes as good with less calories.  I know some people skipped the onions and I think the onions are a must have with this dish.  Delish!

Not bad, but I thought it had too much mayo, and I didn't use the full amount.   I don't have onions (and they'd be wasted in this house anyway--neither of us are huge fans), so I thought I'd use onion powder instead . . .but I completely forgot.  I used old bay instead of the seasoned salt and mixed everything together with the mayo, then slathered it on the fish.  I just eyeballed everything.  Bf really liked the fish; I thought it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! We are not big fish eaters and I'm trying to get the family to eat more of it...that isn't deep fried in a ton of batter. This recipe is easy and delicious. A bit hit in our house!

I thought this was very yummy. We used fresh cod. I did not use parmesan or parsley. I did add a little garlic and used reduced mayo.

This fish recipe is so easy to make, yet tastes like you slaved in the kitchen.  Restaurant-quality - - very rich.  I used a vidalia onion and the sweetness from it gave the dish great flavor.  The cheese/mayo/almond combination is super yummy.  Heidi, this is a fantastic recipe!

This is restaurant quality for sure!  Absolutely delicious.  I used fresh Wild True Cod from Costco and cut the amount of mayonnaise by half & added a little olive oil to the mixture.  I used Old Bay Seasoning instead of season salt, sprinkled a little garlic powder, and kept everything else the same.  I baked the onions a little longer before adding the fish.  Just watch the fish to make sure you don't overcook & it will turn out divine!  Served with Emerill's Herbed Rice and Sauteed green beans with mushrooms.  Yummmmm

We liked this a lot. I broiled mine for a few minutes at the end, to crisp and blacken the edges of the almonds.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I was a bit skeptical due to some of the negative comments I read, but realizing that everyone's tastes are different, I decided to give it a try and am glad I did. This is a keeper! I cut the sauce recipe in half, as I used only 2 fillets. I was too lazy to toast the almonds (I used slivered rather than sliced), so I sprinkled them onto the fish for the last 2 minutes of baking and they toasted up nicely. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Can't wait to share it with my co-workers tomorrow!

This recipe was great.  I used tilapia and substituted sour cream for mayo as I can't stand the stuff.  I used Old Bay instead of regular season salt and didn't use as much as called for since many reviews said it was a bit salty. It turned out perfect.  Even my boyfriend complimented the dish and he is hard to please!

Our favorite fish recipe--even family members who don't enjoy fish like this. I made it tonight with fresh tilapia, following exact directions (used Mrs. Dash as seasoned salt). Delicious with jasmine rice and fresh green beans as sides.

This is great! A really simple fish dish that even the teenagers loved! I have always been scared of cooking fish but this takes so little time and the ingredients are in the cupboard...I didn't have one thing - the almonds - so I used cashews instead...YUM!

Moist...easy to prepare...flavorful...devoured by my family. I did use full fat mayo, however. Can't ask for much more of a recipe! Thanks for a great option in fish prep!

This is getting 4 stars only because of how much i love the broiled tilapia parmesan from this site, and for the fact that i will always compare to that dish. (Though in saying that - this dish is much lighter an healthier!) Family is currently on a low carb diet and this was perfect for that with a yummy fresh salad on the side. I didn't change anything except for add some spring onions sliced finely over the top of the cheese mix as it was cooking and then sprinkled all the almonds over the top. It was a great meal.. Thanks!

This fish was amazing!  We enjoyed it so much, the gang wants it once a week from now on.  The only thing I did differently was to use Tilapia, as that was the only fish I had on hand.  A little mushroom rice and a salad and you've got the perfect, quick meal.

Holy Moly!!! I used Swai for the fillets, Cavender's greek seasoning and plain salt instead of seasoned salt, took other reviewer's recommendation of subbing sour cream for the mayo, and I forgot the Almonds, but WOW!!!! Incredible flavor. Easy to prepare, and everyone LOVED it! We just had a greek salad on the side to go with it. Thanks for an incredible recipe!

Delicious. I omitted the almonds but followed the rest of the recipe. Anytime I can get my husband and 12 year old meat eaters to finish a fish entree, it is an overwhelming success.

I was looking for a cod recipe, as I picked up some fresh cod yesterday and needed to cook it.  This is FABULOUS.  turned out perfect.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used fresh thyme.  It was absolutely delicious.  Highly recommend it!

This dish is fantastic with cod!  However, I used the "Old Bay" recipe variation, which has 1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning instead of salt, and I made these changes (which I think eliminated the problem one reviewer found with the flavors being off):
- I used a large sweet (Vidalia type) onion that I sautéed for 10 mins to pre-cook and caramelize before spreading in pan
- I omitted the parmesan cheese
- I omitted the almonds and served it with almond rice pilaf
- I used reduced-fat mayo instead of fat-free
- I used cod (it may not be as good with haddock)

I've made this twice and my husband and neighbors loved it.  This is a great meal when having company over because all prep can be done  in advance, and it is delicious.  My husband has already asked me when we're having it again... which is going to be very soon!

very good. i used haddock, omitted the onions, added garlic powder to the butter, used regular mayo, and melted some cheese over the top just before taking out of the oven. It was very tasty!

Excellent flavor!  Loved the topping!  This is a great way to bake fish.  Cod have a very mild flavor, so the topping stole the show.  I did not use the butter or the onions, since I used onions in a side dish.  Next time, if my side doesn't have onions, I will follow the entire recipe, although we thought the fish to be fabulous without them.  I used reduced fat mayo, and I sprinkled the almonds on before baking, so they got toasty.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this and it was awesome!  The only thing I did differently was I added the almonds to the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  This tasted like fish you'd get at a restaurant.  So easy and so rich tasting.  This is the best fish I've ever made!

We enjoyed this very much!  I used Old Bay in place of the seasoned salt and just sprinkled on a bunch of pepper.  It had a nice kick.  I completely forgot to add the almond at the end, but I don't think you need it.  Very nice!

Delicious! And so quick to make. I'm not a big fan of codfish but this soaked up the onion and creamy parmesan flavors and really disguised any fish flavor for my not so fish fan family!

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use sour cream instead of mayo and I used tilapia.  I was hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but don't let that deter you...everyone has different tastes.  My boyfriend made me promise to make this again, and he's picky when it comes to eating fish.

I thought it was delicious! My boyfriend is a picky eater and it wasn't his favorite. I will definitely make it again, but for anyone who doesn't like a lot of different flavors I wouldn't recommend it. It is a flavorful, rich dish that makes the fish anything but boring. Also, I didn't have measuring spoons so I just guessed on the measurements and it worked fine.

Awesome recipe!! I made it with flounder, only used about a fourth of onion (it's all I had on hand), seasoned it with adobo, paprika, garlic powder and dill and then used olive oil mayo. Absolutely fantastic flavor, beautiful browning and wonderful presentation. Do not hesitate to try this recipe!!

This is a restauarant quality dish!  The more onions, the better.  Great over rice.  I used double the parmesan cheese.  Don't make a strong flavor with your side dish because this has a very rich flavor.  Steamed asparagus or green beans is perfect.

I really did not like this dish. It was to salty and the flavours did not mesh well for me. I am however giving it three stars as my boyfriend did enjoy it. I will not make this again.

An outstanding meal. The almonds are perfect in here, it would probably taste good even if you omitted them but they really set the dish apart. I used full-fat mayo and didn't find it too heavy. Thanks so much for sharing.

Quality of a five star restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly as written using Cod. The fish was flaky and moist with a lightly sweet flavor. The almonds were a perfect topping. Even my 3 Midwest raised children who approach any fish dinner with extreme caution loved this dish.

This was nice, a bit salty for my hubby. I did use garlic butter instead and heated in the microwave instead of the oven. I also used 3 shallots instead of a small onion and fresh dill. Very easy and quick to make.

This was really good! I was a little concerned that the dill and onions might overpower a mild fish. Wrong. I used swai which is a very mild fish. I followed the recipe exactly except I used dried parsley since I didn't have fresh.

I made just a couple substitutions: used tilapia, as that is the only white fish available at my supermarket in Houston, and used lite mayo instead of fat free. The fish was moist, flavorful, and not fishy at all! So quick and easy, will be a cinch to make during the busy work week! A hit with me and my husband, will definitely make again!

Delish!  I didn't have lemon or parsley, but a thin layer of romano cheese mixed with low-fat mayo over the seasoned fish was fabulous.  I and my hub personally thought the combination of flavors (onion, dill, mayo/grated romano, etc.) blended wonderfully.  Sooooo good!

I've made this several times and it's turned out great each time. The last time I used catfish fillets, marinaded them in vodka with a little olive oil and cajun spice mix for about 9 hours. I also sprinkled the cajun mix on the bottom of the dish and mixed it into the sauce. The flavor didn't come through as strong as I had hopped, but still very good. Thanks for the recipe!

What a great receipe! While cooking it I realized I had no mayo so had to use sour cream and only had a few green onions so I chopped them up with some spinach and laid that under the fish. And no harm done...it was absolutely delicious! Not often that one can make a restaurant quality dish so quickly! Thank you so much for sharing.

I thought this dish was delicious!  I almost never take seconds, but this made me want thirds!  I used cod.  It was moist and flakey.  The only reason I could see why someone would not care for this dish is if you prefer your fish firmer (like Grouper) and dry (many people overcook fish).  I use the thicker part of the cod for this recipe and save the thinner piece for pan-frying.  Thank you for posting, Heidi!

Outstanding - I used cod. I had fresh basil instead of parsley and it was delicious. The onions cooked to perfection under the fillets. I made the recipe with three half-pound fillets. Next time I will double sauce; it is delicious. Be sure to use the toasted sliced almonds. The added texture is perfect.

We just had this fish for dinner, we all really enjoyed it. Everyone had seconds.  It's another great option for baking fish.  I may just try less mayo next time only because one of my daughters thought it she could really taste the mayo.  Besides that, it tasted really good.

Family LOVED it and they are not fish lovers normally...  I didn't have dill so I used a tsp of italian seasoning.  Plus fresh lemon juice squeezed into the mayo, then thinly sliced the lemon and placed the slices ontop of the mayo mixture before baking...  It turned out delicious!

This is an excellent fish recipe.  I am not much for fish, but this is easy and has the ingredients I enjoy in other foods.  I did not expect my husband to like it - not pan fried.  But he gave it 5 stars as well.

I thought I read through all of the ingredients before I started this but somehow I didn't see the mayo.  Halfway through, I felt like I had already committed to the recipe so I finished it despite my usual preference to avoid those calories.  It was SUPER rich...and pretty tasty, too.  I think that if I make this again, I will use the fat free sour cream at some other people's suggestions.  My two year old did not care for it (he doesn't like mayo so I wasn't surprised) but the rest of us did enjoy it.  If we do this again it will be one of our weekend treats and not a weekday meal.  The onions were incredible and I will now be making many other dishes with some thin onions underneath.

Heard around the table
"this is SOOOOOO good"
"I'm never making haddock any other way again"
"I can't believe there's none left"

Incredibly easy and really delicious.  This deserves a weekly spot on our table!!

Very easy and delicious. Had all the ingredients on hand which is a plus. The only thing I would do differently is cut down the amount of seasoned salt. The Parmesan cheese is a little salty tasting, so no need to add another t. of salt. Its a beautiful looking dish too. Who would guess it was so low in calories?

I was going to give it three starts until I realized I forgot to put the almonds on at the end - that probably would've given it a nice touch of crunch and flavor.  I wasn't a huge fan of the mayo, I might cut down on that next time.  It did have good flavor though and I used fresh haddock, which was good and not terribly expensive.  The onions were not cooked and added nothing to the dish, I will definitely skip those next time.

Rave reviews from my guests!  Used sliced almonds, toasted first in a skillet and freshly caught sea bass.  Yum! It needed at bit more lemon at the end, but that made for an even more beautiful presentation.

the fish i used was salmon. I would say this is the best baked salmon i've ever had! Tastes like the ones they serve at a fancy restaurant, you know!  Awesome flavor, salmon was cooked to perfection, i didn't have dill weed on hand, i just used dried parsley. the rest of the ingredients were kept the same.

I thought this was excellent. My husband said to use a little less Parmesan. I also used a little olive oil, garlic, thyme, tarragon, cilantro and fish seasoning like the other reviews. Great flavor. I will make this again. This was very yummy.

This was excellent.  I prepared it without the fresh parsley because I didn't have it. My husband loved it and he doesn't even like parmesan. I thought the flavors worked well together. I wonder if some of the negative reviews were due to the strength of the parmesan and the onions - mine were mild. I will definitely make this again, it was a nice change from my usual butter and ritz topped cod.

I didn't have the fresh parsley or the 100% Parmesan cheese so I used dried parsley and a shredded mix of mozzarella, Asiago, Parmesan, and Romano cheese, and it's still great! Although I can see there is a risk of flavor weirdness if you add more mayo than cheese in the topping mixture... Good thing I didn't!

This is a great recipe.  If your tempted to use a mayonnaise other than the fat free, I can tell you the fat free is actually better when mixed with the other ingredients than the regular mayo.  I tried them both and the fat free made a better sauce for the fish.

this recipe is a family fave at our house (my mother even loves this dish, and she HATES fish)! I usually use frozen tilapia filets (straight from the freezer) and bake it for ~35 mins. in summer this recipe transitions very nicely to foil packets for grilling: use heavy-duty foil; spread a bit of olive oil on the foil; layer the onions, fish, sauce, and almonds; fold top and ends of foil over, leaving room for heat circulation; grill on rack over ~325F heat for ~18 mins (for frozen filets; ~12 mins for fresh or thawed). I thought my DH was going to lick the foil!! {G}

This turned out pretty well, but I can't justify giving it 4/5 stars since my husband made several modifications to the original recipe. The modifications that others suggested were using sour cream, instead of mayo and adding garlic. However, he mistakenly used cilantro from our herb garden instead of parsley. It definitely had a different flavor, but it was still pretty good. We had no problem eating almost a full 1lb. cod fillet with our son. We will probably try this recipe again sometime.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times, and it never disappoints! I LOVE it. Takes no time at all to make, but tastes very impressive. I've never failed to get numerous compliments whenever I make it. The only changes I've made is to use fresh red snapper, and after melting the butter in the dish, I add the onions and put it back in the oven for a bit before putting the fish on top. Simply a matter of taste-I don't like onions even slightly raw.

I liked the crunch of the toasted almonds on top and the flavors in my dish were complimentary.  Possibly the choice of seasoned salt could have given the other reviewer an off flavor. I used 1/4 of a large yellow onion & sliced the onion very thin.  The onion caramalized where it wasn't covered by the fish. I used Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb in place of the seasoned salt and just salted the fish before I added the sauce.  I like a little bite so I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the sauce.  I used 1/4 c lite sour cream and 1/4 c regular mayonaise and a sqeeze of fresh lemon juice, topping the sauce with minced parsley with no other substitutions.   This was so easy and suitable for company.  I looked great coming out of the oven and tasted wonderful.  I used Basa Filets.  A great recipe in about 30 minutes from start to finish!

Used cod from Costco.  Very good tasting sauce.  The almonds make it delicious.

Reading the other reviews convinced me to make this.  I was pleased with the results.  Excellent flavour.  It's going into the recipe box.

This was a real restaurant quality meal.  I used barramundi fish and sour cream instead of mayo which made it really creamy, next time I will use a red onion.

WOW!  Wish I made more so I could have seconds.  Only gets 4 stars because the Husband felt so-so about it.  Said it was too salty.  That could be easily adjusted for personal tastes, but it was just right for me.

This is fantastic. I used plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise and red onion in place of yellow the second time I made this and I liked it even better. I also used tilapia fillets for the fish.

I thought this was really good as is but hubby didn't like the almonds on his.  That was easy enough to fix!  I used light mayo instead of fat-free because that's what I had on hand and I used freshly grated parmesan.  This was really good on cod.

Even my 3-year-old liked this!  It was so easy.  I used pollock instead of cod, and it was great.  I think I might use sweet onions next time, as regular onions were a little strong.  The adults liked them, the kids not so much.

I love this fish.  This would be a great dish to serve for picky anti-fish people as the taste is wonderful and non-fishy.  I doubled the mayo mixture because I felt the original amount was too little and it turned out perfect.  Cooking on top of onion was brilliant - added such an awesome flavor.  Thanks for a great family dish.

This was wonderful. Very flavorful and the ingredients all blended perfectly together. The only thing I changed was using fat free Miracle Whip rather than mayo, and it was still delicious.

Freaking fantastic! The flavors didnt overpower the fish at all and the toasted almonds were a perfect touch. I used more parsely than it called for, but that was the only change. Definitely a keeper.

I made it according to the recipe with Cod filets (instead of the Haddock) and left off the almonds cause I didn't have them and it still got rave reviews from the folks I had over.  I served it over angel hair with a bit of olive oil and garlic.  I'll make it again and again.

Excellent! It's very kid-friendly if you don't let them see the onions. I have made it so many times that I have now modified it slightly to exactly suit our tastes. First, I often use frozen chopped onions but if not I use sweet vidalia onions, and I ALWAYS put them back in the oven for a few minutes til transparent and stir before I put the fish on them. Then, after I squeeze the lemon juice I rub the fish with the spent lemon and sprinkle the fillets with dill weed before adding the topping. We don't do fat free mayo, so use regular or lowfat. I also double the sauce but not the lemon juice, and use a little extra high quality parmesan. I never use "seasoned salt", imho the mayo, parm and lemon have enough salt in them. I have made it with and without the nuts which I love, but the kids, not so much. I toast my almonds on the stovetop in a little butter and serve them on the side. The bed of onions seems to absorb any "fishiness" that may accompany less expensive fillets, and keeps the fish moist on the bottom. The topping keeps it moist on the other end, so it's creamy & lush in your mouth (kid/elder friendly, like mac n cheese.) I use frozen thawed Basa or Swai most of the time because they're inexpensive but don't have the muddy, earthy flavor that I hate in Tilapia and commercially or pond-grown trout. I've also tried this with salmon, removed the skin of course, and Dover sole and flounder. (With very thin fish I don't double the sauce.) It's always a yum!

i was surprised about this dish. although it just sounded like the typical fish and mayo bake ( there are tons on here) the almonds and the dill really make this dish. the only thing i did differently was i added a pinch of brown sugar to the almonds. i served this over a side of garlic herbed rice. wonderful!

I actually despise fish, but know I need to eat more of it for health reasons.  Hate fish no more! Try this recipe!  Not only is it super easy and fast to prepare, it tastes like restaurant quality.  I even had to sub Miracle Whip instead of Mayo and it still tasted amazing.  I plan to make this weekly now.  DELISH!  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best recipes I have found.  It is great on chicken too.  I mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl ( except the butter and onions) then spooned it on top.  Great flavor !!!  I recently used it on fresh bass...wonderful!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made.  I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any and used lime (fresh) instead of lemon for the same reason.  The other thing I did was mis the salt, pepper and dill with the mayo and cheese just for the ease.

This was really tasty.  I didn't have fresh onion so, I used a tablespoon of onion powder and added it to the mayo mixture.  The fish came out being very flavorful and my picky bf loved it!

My family loved this one! I was skeptic of using cheese on my fish, but by using real parmesan and the correct amount listed here, the flavour came out delicious! I will be making this again.

Best fish dish I've ever tasted. Made with cod and followed the recipe with no changes. Tasted like it was from a restaurant. AMAZING and quick & easy.  I have never reviewed anything before, but this was that good.

Used Cod and instead of the dill weed I used rosemary.  Used bottled parsley instead of fresh. I omitted the almonds. Broiled for a minute at the end to crispen up the coating.  My family loved this.

Very good, husband loved it and said it was something that could be served in a restaraunt. although he doesn't like almonds he loved the texture.
I made it exactly to the receipe for 17 minutes and I think it could have been 20 minutes it wasn't piping hot. very good though.

Very good! I left out the onions and the almonds (DH doesn't like either), and it was still quite yummy. I cooked these on the stovetop, so made a couple changes: Equal olive oil and butter in pan until very hot, put fillets in and sprinkled with dill, seas salt and pepper, then covered the pan. When the fish was opaque, I turned them, spread the parm-mayo-lem mixture on and continued cooking until flaky. Nice flavor and texture.

This recipe is a very odd combination of flavours. The fish tasted very oniony. The topping was just a soggy paste. Will not make it again.

Wow, this was great!  Even someone who doesn't much care for fish would probably eat this dish.  I did not make any changes except I used a local type of white flaky fish (cod nor haddock were available here).  I think it would be good with any type of flaky fish.  I served it with sauteed swiss chard and carrot rice, and it was wonderful.  This will be going into our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Ok, this was seriously yummy.  My entire family loved it.  

I liked how easy it was to make, and it really enhanced the bland taste of cod.  I really didn't want to do the frying thing and this totally fit the bill.  Thanks for posting this one.

Will be doing this one again.  :)

Great tasting dish. I added and extra tablespoon of lemon juice and I put the whole thing under the broiler for a few minutes to get some better color out of it.  All my fish eaters were fans, but it still retained enough fish taste to turn off my non fisher lovers.

Maybe it was the quality of fish, as we live in the prairies, but also found the flavors didn't seem to mesh well.

Delicious! I didn't have dill so I subbed some dried tarragon and thyme, and used more than the recipe called for. I was also out of fat free mayo so subbed light ranch dressing. Yummy, and the whole family loved it! An elegant dish, like you would get at a great seafood restaurant!

This was so good! I used a dill jalapeno tartar sauce instead of mayonnaise to add more flavor. Also cooked the fish for about 10 minutes and then added the almonds before putting back in the oven to toast them a bit.the onion add great flavor and texture, I will definitely make this again!

Very delicious! I'm making it for the second week in a row tonight. I did add a little bit (1 tsp.-1 tbsp.) cooking wine to help the fish soak in the different flavors and it seemed to do great.

Edible, but not very yummy. I agree with other reviews that the flavors did not mesh well. I ended up scraping off the stuff on top in order to tolerate the fish underneath. I wanted to like this, but no such luck.

Loved it!  I've not tried too many fish recipes and this was my first one.   I didn't have any real onion on hand, so I had to used dried minced onion, but it was still great.  I also halved the butter and used a little olive oil instead.  I've eaten out and ordered fish, but I thought this was the best I've had.

Mixed feelings in our house.  Hubby didn't care for this much.  He said there was too much dill.  I, on the other hand, LOVED it!  Will definitely make it again (only I will eat it though) ;)

Excellent.  Used tilapia, and only used salt and pepper on top.  Only had cheddar, so grated a little on top, and then sprinkled toasted slivered almonds on top and baked at 475 for 10 min.  Delicious!  Don't need the extra fat from the mayo at all!

I used sour cream instead of mayo and used less of it.  Onion with parmesan taste did not seem to go well for us.  Very strong flavor - would suggest steamed veggies and brown rice.

This was so good and really easy.  I left out the seasoned salt, almonds and parsley and in the sauce I added about a teaspoon of horseradish.  I also used half cod and half salmon together in the same dish and it was perfect for two people.

OMG this is the best fish recipe ever.  I used a 2lb bag of tilapia  filets that I had and layed them out in a roaster pan then doubled the topping sauce. I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any, sure didn't miss them anyway.  It only took 7 min. for this to be cooked and done.  They were so juicy and flavorful I couldn't believe how good they were.

I added chickpea to the dish and a pinch of paprika- the nuttiness of the beans go well with the almonds. My father loved it.

I loved this recipe. I made only small alterations. I used red onion as suggested, oregano instead of dill weed, half sour cream and half mayo(I added a little milk to thin it out) a little ceyanne pepper for kick and I did not toast my almonds I just put them over the top I also used fish seasoning instead of salt and pepper. It was not salty and baked it.  This was very good thank you!

Heidi, your wonderful recipe inspired me to take it further a few steps.  I have an abundance of yellow squash right now, so I added sliced squash and mushrooms to the onions, used almond meal per a previous reviewer, sprinkled it with Ms. Dash and served it over couscous, using cod.  Very good!  My husband, who usually  says little while he eats, actually said it was good about 5 times!!  Thank you for sharing!

I followed the recipe to the letter except I used oregano in place of dill, and the mayo I used wasn't fat free. Great flavors, but the almonds made the dish for me.

I loved this!  May try to switch the butter for Olive Oil.  And I used Olive Oil mayo and cut it in half.  Always looking for new fish recipes.  This one is a keeper.

I love this fish recipe...and all of the family and friends I have made it for agree with me. I usually change around a couple of smaller things (just a matter of preference)...I use sour cream instead of mayo, I use flounder since it's a bit thicker then other white fish, before I put the fish on the onions I sprinkle both side with seasonings such as old bay and pepper and italian seasoning, and I don't use dill weed. The fish comes out so moist from being cooked on the onions and I think the flavor is excellent

My teenage daughter made this for dinner and it was fabulous!  She omitted the almonds as we didn't have any.  Used talapia since that's what we had.  This will definitely be made again in our household!
UPDATE:  3/15/19   Well, 11 years later this is still our go to recipe for white fish.  My teenager is grown and out of the house now, but I am so thankful she found this and gave it a try.  Not sure why it doesn't have more positive reviews.

I don't eat fish, but made this for my husband & our daughters. They said it was really good & they would love to have it again. 
I made it without dill, as my family doesn't like dill. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. 
I also used fresh shredded parm cheese, as opposed to the stuff in a can.

I'm only giving this two stars because my husband said it was "ok".  But I didn't like it at all.  I guess for my taste buds mayo and fish just don't go together.  Plus, it was such an odd texture to have on top of the fish, it was kind of like creamy cottage cheese.  I will not make this again.

I made this dish with Tilapia for dinner tonight, here are the changes I made:  I didn't have seasoned salt so I lightly sprinkled the fish with salt and chili powder.  I used dried parsley and pecans instead of almonds.  
This was very tastey and I would make it for company.

I love this recipe even though my fiance didn't. I probably won't make it again unless he's away sometimes.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it's definitely restaurant quality! Very flavorful. My husband loved it and so did my very picky teenage daughter.

yummy recipe. I really liked the flavor of the topping with the crunch of the almonds. My boyfriend was not crazy about it because the combo of the mayo & parmesean cheese reminded him of the texture of scrambles eggs, & he hates eggs. I thought it resembled something more along the lines of ricotta cheese.

The sauce on this fish was really yummy.  The only problem that I had was that the fish seemed to come out a little under cooked. I will try again and bake a little longer.

I had everything on hand, but the dill was fresh and the parsley dry.  I switched the two and added garlic to the onion.  WOW!  My new fave for fresh caught fish!

What a great way to eat white fish! I used frozen pollock that's thawed just because that's all I had in my hand. It tastes as delicious as using any other white fish. Do not skip to add toasted almond on top. The fish were so tender and soft, crunch almond balanced it out. Overall, I'll make this dish over and over for my family.

Delicious! Took the other reviewers advice and added crushed garlic to the spread. I learned that this manner of fish is widespread in Central America. Fish+mayonaise+lemon. I do wonder what the addition of capers would do to it, and possibly curried sweet potatoes as a side dish? mmmm.

My Husband and 2 out of 3 kids loved this fish, which is pretty good odds in my house!  We used cod and crushed cashews since I didn't have almonds.  Very good flavor, quick and easy to make!

This dish is delicious!  The only adjustment I made was to increase the amount of topping since I was preparing 6 fish filets.  I used 1/3 cup each of light mayo and parmesan cheese.  I would never have dreamed of onions with fish but it was great.  I'm looking forward to fixing this dish again since it was so easy.

I chose this because I was looking for a quick and easy fish recipe.  I had everything on hand, so I whipped this up, and it was really delicious!  I only made two fillets, so I just made a little less of the marinade/sauce to put on top.

This fish was really good.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the mayo mixture and to make things a little easier I put all the topping ingredients in the food processor.  I will be making this again soon.

This turned out nicely and was easy to make.  I definitely overcooked the fish by leaving it in the oven 20 minutes, so for more delicate fish 18 minutes or less is probably plenty.

Phenominal. My husband hates fish but loved this.  He recommended I cook it for company. Elegant flavor.  I added a little fresh garlic and italian seasonings.  Will make this next time the family gets together.

This was awesome!  Just finished eating it and decided it deserved a rave review.  Keep an eye on it though.  Mine only took about 15 minutes (haddock) and some of the sauce started to char, but it was still REALLY GOOD.

This is fantastic! We used Cod. The fish would have been great with or without the almonds. We sauted the almonds in butter and then put them on top of the fish during the last 10 minutes of cooking. MmMmMm! We will definitely make this again, but next time I'm going to try it with salmon and no almonds. The sauce alone is to die for! We served it with cous cous and lima beans. Thanks!

I used tilapia and a dill-lemon seasoning. I also seasoned fish on both sides and browned almonds in a little butter before topping fish. very nice. son and hubby thought it was good.

This was a great receipe for Haddock, I wish I'd doubled it though.  I didn't have flaked almonds but added ground almonds 5 minutes before end of cooking time. Served with baked potatoes and salad.

I doubled this recipe and it tasted  awesome!!! Has great flavor.  It is an excellent alternative to frying.  Here in Hawaii we constantly get fish from our friends who like to go fishing and I was getting tired of having it until this recipe came along.  Thanks so much!!
