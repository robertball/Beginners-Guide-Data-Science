I only had half of a pound of ground meat to use. To make this stretch a little farther to make up for the missing meat, I added one can of drained, rinsed black beans. I also used one can of petite diced tomatoes as to not have to bother with chopping up whole canned tomatoes. The boys did ask for more cheese. Great quick "boys night" dinner. I was able to cook this before work and leave it in the crockpot on warm until my family got home.

The recipe is great if your looking for a easy quick meal.  I would suggest adding a few more seasonings, but other than that it is good, and I will be making this again

Decent recipe. 5 stars for ease of preparation and handy ingredients, 3 stars for taste. Will make it again if I'm in a rush and have the ingredients on hand.

I liked how quick and easy it was and also I have these ingredients on hand all the time. I did spice mine up a bit more as it was a bit bland. I added more salsa, some green chili's, 1 can tomato sauce and extra cheese

My friends and family loved this when I made it. I used penne pasta since that is what I had available. I also used a can of stewed tomatoes, and added in some taco seasoning to the ground beef. I will definitely be making this again. And maybe a little extra so there are more leftovers!

So good! This has become a family favorite and one of my go to dinners when I don't have much time.  I usually have all ingredients on hand as well, and its so simple to put together. Left overs are just as good if not better for lunch the next day (I usually end up making a double batch)

This is a super easy to make recipe and flavorfull. I used Penne Pasta since that's all I had and I also used Taco seasoning while cooking the beef. Because I didn't have Picante sauce I made my own version. A mix of chopped tomato, green pepper, & onion. 
I cooked the pasta first (I never have good luck with trying to cook pasta in the skillet), added the shredded cheese and then combined it with the hamburger.

Hubbie said this was a keeper but needed a bit more of a "kick" so I will experiment with some of the following next time: maybe some lime, cayenne pepper, chili powder, cilantro.
