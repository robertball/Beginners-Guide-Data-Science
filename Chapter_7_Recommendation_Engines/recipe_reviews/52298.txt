Nice way to perk up egg beaters for breakfast and add a little spice to your morning! Plus it was a nice change from the usual wrap sandwich. I used a fresh homemade salsa and "Taco Seasoning II" from this site that I always keep on hand in a little tupperware container for the Mexican-style seasoning blend. I topped this with chopped green onion vs. red and some light shredded Cheddar cheese - YUM!

Instead of egg substitute I used real eggs. I assume by "mexican style seasoning blend" they mean taco seasoning so I used my homemade taco seasoning. I didn't have four corn tortillas just two small ones which worked out anyway seeing as I'm watching my carb intake. Right before serving I sprinkled on a quarter cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The corn tortillas used in this recipe were interesting the kids thought it was great. Four and a half stars really. It's no different than making breakfast wraps the "wrap" is just chopped up and tossed instead.

These aren't too bad. I like to experiment with different types of eggs--I love eggs for breakfast--so I thought I'd give this a shot. I like the spiciness the salsa lends to the egg beaters. I use egg beaters all the time especially in baking to cut down on the cholesterol but they really don't have much flavor in regular cooking. You are better off jacking up the seasoning or using real eggs instead but the salsa in this takes care of that. For those of you who don't use egg subs 1/4 c egg sub=1 egg. I can't say I like the tortillas added to this and I just put the eggs and salsa together in the pan so both were cooked at the same time. Bf wasn't too impressed--not so sold on the idea of eggs and salsa. So something I could make again for myself but apparently not for the bf! I used a black bean and corn salsa for mine. thanks for the recipe.

This has great potential but the texture was awful. There's way too much salsa so the tortillas and eggs are very soft and mushy. Next time I'll double the amount of tortillas and eggs and leave everything else the same. We thought the onion and cilantro was overpowering.
