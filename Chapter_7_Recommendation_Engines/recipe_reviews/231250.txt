I loved this recipe. They were fast and easy and used a lot of the abundant eggs that our lovely hens produce making them economical for our family as well. I used coconut oil instead of olive for fear of a funny taste. We eat these while night skiing and they are great to stick in pockets and take on the lift.

The recipe was so oily that a rim of bubbling oil formed around the pan.  I know it's olive oil, but it's hard to say this recipe is "healthy" with so many fat calories. The texture is a bit odd too.  Not crispy like you might expect bars to be, and the oatmeal stays firm inside an otherwise soft/eggy dough. Also, it was a lot of chocolate.  I'd suggest using half the amount of chocolate and putting in some dried fruit to up the nutrition and cut the fat/calories/sweetness.

I was expecting the bars to be crisper, and even increasing the baking time it still give me the texture I was hoping for.  I did add some coconut so that may have made a difference.

This is a really good recipe!  I'm not a big walnut fan, so I added an extra half cup oats and an extra half cup chocolate chips to make up for it.  Also, I substituted sugar free applesauce for the oil, my husband actually likes the taste better that way!  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I bake it for a full 40 minutes though.  Very simple and good recipe.  Thank you!  I've made it probably 4 times now.

These are very good, and easy to make, but,  Baking instructions are screwy.  If I put this in my oven cold, it would be broiled.  When My old oven is turned on, the top element comes on until it reaches preset temp.  after that just the  bottom element works. be careful about starting with a cold oven.

These energy bars are quick and easy to make and much better than the store bars.  You can vary the ingredients to get different flavors.

Certainly more nutritious than sugar and butter needed for cookies, but the bars didn't bind very well for me, ends up more in little clusters. Perhaps 1/2c olive, 1/2c coconut oil would improve that, or melting the chocolate chips into the mixture, or blending the walnuts and part of the oats into a flour.

These would have been better if the texture was crisp and not soft, but they were easy to make and relatively healthy.  We liked them better refrigerated.  I combined what others said and used half oil/half applesauce (olive oil is fine - you can't taste it), half the chips, cashews instead of walnuts, and dried cranberries.  I baked them for 45 mins, not 25.  My kids liked them ok.  It's a nice grab and go energy snack - high on protein, carbs, and healthier fats.

This is an easy recipe for a nice homem made energy bar. You can use the base recipe and mix it up with your favorite dried fruits and nuts. My family loves these, they smell like chocolate chip cookies cooki
