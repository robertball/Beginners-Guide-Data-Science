I make this with angel hair, and often remove the green herbs & replace with large amounts of spinach that I wilt with a tiny bit of the water I boiled the pasta in. I have found that using butter instead of oil imparts a rich flavor that we enjoy as well. You can modify this recipe any number of ways. It really needs little other than cheese, garlic, noodles, black pepper, & butter, but it's delicious to experiment :-) This is far tastier than any of the boxed side dishes that are similar, and just as easy to make!

Excellent side dish to go with any type of fish or meat entree.  It's excellent with grilled halibut or salmon.  Another alternative is to sautee a 3-5 fillets of anchovies (good quality type that's in olive oil) along with the garlic.  Add the anchovies to the oil first on medium heat until fillets have almost dissolved, then add the garlic and the rest of the ingredients.  The anchovies will dissolve completely in the heat and the finished product will not taste fishy at all - trust me.  It will add a wonderful salty flavor to the pasta.  An Italian lady taught me this.  Try it!

I substituted the 1/4 cup olive oil with unsalted butter but added extra virgin olive oil in at the end (around 2 tsp).  I skipped the parmesan since I didn't have any and it still was very good!

YUM! This had awesome flavor, it was the perfect side dish for our meal tonight. I did add a small pat of butter right before serving. I can see why some people complained of it being dry, as it was a bit gummy, but the flavor made up for it. Thank you, I will make this often.

I don't know what the fuss is all about with this recipe.  It is just tossed spaghetti noodles in an oily garlic sauce.  Nothing special.

Being of Italian decent, this recipe was a staple and served at least twice a month. One interesting variation that we all loved as children was the addition of a few tablespoons of ketchup! What a unique flavor combination that will surprise you.

I make this all the time! But I always just use leftover spaghetti and saute it in butter or oil with the garlic.  (Sorta like making fried rice with leftover rice) You don't even need the herbs. If you don't have them it's just as good.  Or try adding a pinch of dried red peppers flakes. It'll give it a good kick!

This was pretty good.  My husband liked it which is saying something cause he is picky.  I thought it needed something.  I am going to use this again but add tomatoes and black olives to it.  I did add more cheese then this called for which added a lot more flavor.  Thanks for sharing

It is very good!  I did follow a reviewer suggestion and added a couple of anchovies fillets to the oil and cooked until almost dissolved, then I added the garlic.  This recipe is already part of our menu.

If you love garlic, this is a must do recipe.  I used garlic infused grapeseed oil (wildtree) to saute garlic and chopped onion.  Used herbs de provence instead of just oregano and parsley and skipped salt and pepper.  For those who wanted additional flavor of butter, wildtree also has butter flavored grapeseed oil.  Same health benefits (if not more) as olive oil, higher burn point.

Update:  took another reviewers suggestion and sauteed a can of anchovies in the olive oil they came in and added the garlic.  Anchovies almost completely melt, add seasonings and toss with pasta and cheese

5 stars as modified:  I cut the recipe in half.  Added an extra clove of garlic and omitted the oregano.  I also doubled the cheese.  These changes made this recipe absolutely to die for delicious!

Capers!  I added about 7 or 8 chopped up capers and it was super good!  I love this recipe.  Yes, it's glorified garlic, buttered spaghetti but it's worth it.  I added a few tsps of butter to the mix too.  When I first looked at it before I put it on the angel hair pasta I was worried that there was way too much spices but no, not at all.  Super good!  I had it with a side to a chicken breast dipped in melted garlic butter and coated in italian bread crumbs, scored in the fry pan for a few mins and then baked.  Yum!

What a fantastic recipe! I made this for a early dinner one day because it seemed very quick and easy. It was! It smells so good when I was mixing the garlic and spaghetti together. I used extra virgin olive oil to cook with the garlic and omitted the parsley. I served it with some baked chicken seasoned with basil. My family loved it!

This is a simple great tasting dish.  I've been making a version of this for years.  For an interesting and classic variation, try adding a few anchovies and sauteing them with the garlic and olive oil. They will melt into the olive oil and garlic.   I also usually add a little bit of cayenne pepper flakes to the olive oil garlic mixture for a little added spice. It adds a whole new dimension.

Easy to make and very tasty. I threw in a half cup of mixed bell peppers(red/green) just to add a little color. I will make this again.

For good flavor use a high quality olive oil, not vegetable oil.  Also increase olive oil to 1/2 cup. Place olive oil in pan, then add garlic & spices. Just warm the mixture so garlic retains its tang. If garlic is browned it becomes too sweet and not at all like the "garlic & oil" spaghetti served in Italian restaurants.

My Husband really enjoyed this. I did mix about 2 Tbsp of butter with the oil before cooking the garlic just to give it a little more flavor. I left out the oregano. I used gluten free angel hair. It was a bit dry but overall good.

This spaghetti was very good. I was looking for a meatless main dish, and this fit perfectly. The flavors of the spices was wonderful and the parmesan cheese gave it a nice finishing touch. I added a little more olive oil after I mixed the pasta with the sauce because I thought it looked a little dry, but didn't change anything else. My whole family liked it so I will make this again sometime. Perfect for an extremely quick meal, can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thank you for the recipe, Jackie!

We really did not care for this dish. I admit I changed it up, so not really fair. Rather than a side dish, I decided to make it a main dish and added chicken breast. I also added spinach. Seems like both of these ingredients would have worked well. What I ended up with was incredibly bland for our taste. Had to add lots of salt and pepper. I also had to add some butter, which helped. I even added a spoonful of basil pesto for some extra flavor. I started to not even serve this to my family. It seemed to get better after a few bites and we ate it, at least my husband and I did. My 20 year old son, said sorry mom, but no thanks. What to do with all the leftovers; I hate wasting food. In all fairness, I will try this again exactly as written and serve as a side dish. I will review again after that.

This was a hit in my family!  Even my 6 yr old, who prefers his noodles totally plain, ate it up!  I don't think you can mess up this recipe.  I ended up making this recipe a second time before writing this review.  The second time, I added chicken (cut into strips).  It turned out really good!  This will be made on a regular basis in my house!

I've always thought something was missing everytime I made this dish by my own recipe. I tried this version for today's dinner and it was SOOOOOO good!!!! The only difference was the oregano and it added a wonderful touch to this simple dish.

This was so easy and very tasty.  Such a great weeknight supper when you're in the mood for something fast.  Sadly my 5 year old didn't like it, I think the sharp garlic taste was just a little too strong for her taste.  I'll keep trying though!  Thanks!

This was good but not great.  I didn't care for the oregano.   I think fresh basil would have been better.

I made this dish exactly as posted with the exception of using olive oil in place of the veggie oil. It was FANTASTIC! I made nirvana meatballs (on this site) topped with spaghetti sauce along withe it - YUMMY!
Thank You!

absolutely delicious! my 2 1/2 year old PICKY eater loved this and after each bite she'd say "mmmmmm!" I added 1/8 cup of butter to the olive oil and i sauteed 1/2 cup minced red onion before adding the garlic. I shouldnt have used 1 tea of salt so next time i'll probably only use 1/4 tea. i also added 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs too for a little texture. absolutely divine!

i have been making garlic spaghetti for 20 years!  I do 2 variations from this recipe, 1 - I add bread crumbs.  This gives it a little substance.  Expereiment with original or Italian bread crumbs 2 - i saute shrimp in the olive oil after the garlic.  I always saute the garlic gloves so they are crunchy.  Either way, it's a meal for my family, and my sister and her husband beg me to make this!

Our family  loves this.  My husband created a version years ago that is almost identical except it uses a can of V-8 juice simmered down.  Incredibly delicious and our kids always request when they come home with their kids!!

Really delicious if you add a pinch of red pepper flakes when cooking the garlic and 1-2 C course chopped Kale which is allowed to gently wilt then add the parsley.  We also changed the cheese from Parmi to Pecorino.  Yumm!!!!

I've been making this for years, just slightly different.  I brown butter then add a Tb or 2 of EVOO.  Take off the heat and toss in the garlic for a minute or two, then pour over the pasta.  Lately, I've been adding a couple handfuls of baby spinach to the mix once I take it off the heat.  Once it's wilted, I toss with the pasta.  I've gotten my 3 VERY finicky (sp?) kids to eat it .. but not with the spinach.  I'm working on it though :)

i make this - but one change that adds a lot of flavor! drain the noodles and while you are cooking the garlic, add some low sodium chicken (i use chicken, i have used veggie) broth in the pot w the pasta on low heat. the broth will absorb into the noodles PLUS keep them warm w/o drying up until it is ready to serve!

Very good dish for a "quick meal" night. I added a little butter to the oil. Once I drained the pasta, added it directly to oil pan and heated it through on low heat. Pasta really absorbs the flavors this way.

We always add sauteed cauliflower, chopped, to this dish.   WONDERFUL  Just chop and saute with olive oil and garlic and then add that to the cooked spaghetti.  This was a regular dish in our Italian Family growing up and everyone has always loved it.

This made a really great budget main dish. The herbs were a little gritty or grassy I guess I would describe it, they were a bit crunchy I guess? I am used to having them cooked into a sauce but this was good.

Wow!  Excellent.  Maybe I messed it up, but I "browned" the garlic to the point of crunchiness and the nutty flavor and zing of crunch really made this dish awesome.

This was good.  I added one tsp of basil in place of oregano. It was a bit dry and I even added about 2/3 C pasta water.  It needs a drizzle of oil once plated. Also added 1/4 tsp,of crushed red pepper.

first of all this should be classified as a 15 minute meal, not 30. It's so quick and easy!! Wow...there is so much flavor. I would, however,  have added a little more cheese, just my personal taste. Oh, and I used penne since I didn't have any spaghetti in the house.

An Italian neighbor shared this recipe with my mom when I was a kid, and I've loved it ever since.  I love garlic, so I'd add more than 10 cloves. Don't brown the garlic or it will get bitter. I've made this recipe several times without the benefit of parsley, and it is still wonderful.
