Suddenly decided I wanted to try to make a soufflé this morning. This was the best-looking recipe I could find. Never having made soufflé before, I wasn't expecting much, but they turned out great! I didn't have enough cheddar cheese, so I added some cream cheese & pepper jack, plus some chopped ham & dill. They looked lovely & tasted great!! Will probably make again.

With a pinch of dry mustard, garlic powder, and cayenne added the dish was improved. Also, I made it twice and the first time it didn't brown. The next time I preheated to 400 and when putting in I lowered the temp to 375. That did the trick for my oven to get a lovely golden color on them.

Needs seasoning!  Came together nicely as a soufflé, but my husband asked that I never make this again. Too drab, little flavor. So if you opt to try this out, you may want to pop in your favorite spices. It needs it.

No flavor, didn't poof much or brown (though that might have been user error). Too salty. The cheese has enough salt.

This is very bland and there is way too much flour in this recipe.
