Very good! Had to substitute a few of the flours, but I worked out great!

Tasty. I didn't have arrowroot starch, but used potato starch as I think they should be similar. My bananas were extremely ripe, so I did not add any sugar at all. It was sweet enough for me. As a preference I just sprinkled a bit of coconut on top instead of measuring it out.  I made this in silicone muffin cups, but might try making this again with banana leaves.

I prepared it for my family and they all gave it a thumbs up! This cake has a dense texture that is commonly found in southeast asian cakes, which I found to be quite nice. You can taste the banana and coconut with every bite you take! Thumbs up for the creator of this dish, will make again.
