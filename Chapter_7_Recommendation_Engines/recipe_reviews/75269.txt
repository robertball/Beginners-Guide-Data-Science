Was asked to bring an appetizer to a pre-St Patrick's dinner,browsed Allrecipes and found this. Never heard of Manzanilla Olives, but had a can of chopped black olives in my pantry. Drained it well, and added one green onion, finely chopped. Rave reviews! I will look for the Manzanilla in my markets...Thank you Lindsay for the inspiration!!

I test drove this recipe since I will be making them for my family at Thanksgiving.  Although good, its just a pretty basic recipe.  I will add caynne or chili powder for more kick.  The filling doesn't really adequately fill all the eggs.  I'm thinking about adding chilled chopped shrimp when I make them for the family.  Paprika is a must for presentation, and I prefer a slice of olive on top of that.  Makes it very pretty.

Very good. The olives add  a bit more zing to otherwise drab eggs. I make egg salad sandwiches and add chopped green olives to it also.
