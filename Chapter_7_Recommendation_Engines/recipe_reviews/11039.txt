This recipe is awesome.  My children loved them.  I use a 1 1/2 inch ice cream scoop and it made 8 dozen cookies.  I baked them for 14 minutes and they were perfect!

Excellent recipe.  I made these one night with my kids and all the stirring and handling of little hands did not hurt this recipe at all.  Very easy and very good.

Everybody raved about the taste of this cookie, but looks-wise, it was too flat for my taste.  Tasted great, though!  Thanks, Kristil!

I made a half batch of this delicious cookie to take part of them on a “girl’s weekend” trip and to leave some home for my family.  Everyone loved the simple taste of this recipe.  I used white chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet chips because I simply like the taste of white better.  The cookie held up nicely and baked up crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I used the small cookie scoop and 12 minutes worked perfect.  I got 64 cookies from a half batch.  They were a hit, and I will be using this recipe again.

I've been looking for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe.  My boyfriend is in a frat and most my baked goods end up going to him and his brothers, so I decided to give this recipe simply because the name was too perfect for this situation.  This is now my go to chocolate chip recipe.  The texter is light and fluffy without being crumbly or too chewy.  LOVE!

Delicious, and simple.  A great recipe for when you need a lot of chocolate chip cookies quickly.  I usually add 1 Tablespoon of vanilla.

I can't tell you if the cookies were any good but the dough was FABULOUS!  (just kidding - the cookies - the few that we did cook - were great too)... this is not an ordinary chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Made these for a Football Team dinner. Best cookies ever!!!!  I used both white and milk chocolate chips and they were a huge hit. This recipe is a big keeper.

These are delicious, easy to make, and addicting! I made them with whole wheat flour and only baked for 12 minutes and they turned out wonderful!
