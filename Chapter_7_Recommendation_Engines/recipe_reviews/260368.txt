I made this for my husband's work lunch.  I did not use the tuna with olive oil or the olive oil mayo.  I did put in a tablespoon of olive oil in the mix.  I also replaced the red onion with green onion.  I added a half boiled egg on top with paprika for garnish, like my mother always did.  This was delicious and light.  We love it

I halved the recipe, used Dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard, and used regular mayo instead of light. Tastier than I expected! Bonus I generally have all ingredients in hand. Frozen, finely diced red onion added straight from the freezer since this is for tomorrow's lunch. Bet it's even tastier tomorrow! 5 stars for simplicity while being surprisingly yummy.

I made it and added for vegetables, chopped green and yellow peppers.  It was excellent and the family loved it, and will not eat it any other way.  Great way to included more veggies.

I added a few things though.
I like spicy so I added a little bit of cayenne pepper along with a chopped jalapeno pepper.  I also added 1 chopped boiled egg.  Very delicious, thanks.

Didn't need to make any changes to this recipe.   The best tuna we ever had and its low carb.

I have never been a tuna fan. If I had known it could taste like this, I would’ve eaten it sooner! Delicious! I used Dijon mustard instead of regular and added paprika.

This will become a regular. I added sliced almonds. It was a hit at a potluck.

I decided to try this Keto Tuna Salad, and this stuff is perfect! The flavors  just come together wonderfully. I was afraid to try this tuna recipe because my tuna salad is simply tuna and mayo mixed, but this stuff is delicious!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I added diced boiled eggs, used a little celery salt since I didn't have celery available, and added a few tablespoons of my keto friendly sugar alternative  and it was DELICIOUS!!!! I usually eat tuna with crackers, but since I'm doing Keto, I used plain pork rinds as a dipper. Easy, quick, and delicious!

I skipped the lime juice and added raw spinach and a small amount of green bell peppers.  Delicious!

Quick fast and tasty. A difficult meal to mess up, as the needed quantity of ingredients aren't so specific that it will diminish or excel the dish that drastically. If you can remember the needed ingredients, you can almost always make a delish tuna salad by just throwing it in together. I was surprised at how the lime juice livened up the dish quite a bit.

Really good but just a little tangy. I'm used to adding sugar but being keto no sugar allowed. will make again.
