This recipe is great. I have made it several times, with or without the mustard (sometimes I forget it!) Would agree with others that pure maple syrup is better than pancake syrup. I usually put onions in the bottom, ribs salt and fresh ground pepper and some garlic, then cover with the sauce mixture. Cook and serve with mashed potaotes! Yum...

I just joined all recipes and was going to submit this recipe myself.  It's so easy to make and every time I cook these ribs I get rave reviews.  The first time I made the ribs, I used regular pancake syrup, but every time since I have used 100% maple syrup which made the ribs much more flavorful.

Even our little "vegetarian to be" gobbled down these ribs. I rubbed the ribs the night before with paprika, garlic salt, sea salt, brown sugar, and a little black pepper and cayenne pepper. I also recommend making the sauce the night before too. Thanks for an awesome recipe that is so easy to convert into your own.

Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue.  Loved the combination of honey barbecue, real maple syrup, and spicy brown mustard.  Rubbed a little bit of brown sugar, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, and black pepper into the ribs before cooking.  Used 5 pounds of bone-in country style ribs.  Turned out great!

I used picnic size pork ribs, bone in for this recipe and they turned out great.  I did brown them a little prior to putting them in the crock, during the browning I seasoned them well.  The sause was original bbq and I added a little honey and yellow mustard, cooked on low 8 hrs. so easy.

I didn't really care for these because of the fat buildup in the crock pot when cooking them. I enjoyed the flavors of the BBQ Sauce and then I rubbed brown sugar, cayenne pepper & garlic powder on the ribs. But, due to the tons of grease that the ribs swim in by the end I think I'll stick to grilling.

Delicious recipe, sweet and savory as the title says and sauce stays flavorful and thick unlike some other slow cooker recipes.  Will share this one with friends!

This was delicious! I used country style ribs, and the meat was falling off the bone by the time it was done.  Before putting the frozen ribs in the crock pot though, I rubbed them in some olive oil, minced garlic and the salt and pepper. Then I seared the edges, put it into the crock pot and poured the sauce on top. I will definitely be making this again.

I made these ribs over the weekend, and they were perfect!  Tender and delicious, and the recipe couldn't have been easier.  I used real maple syrup, and Jack Daniels Smokehouse Honey BBQ sauce.  Love these!

BIG BIG BIG hit in our family!  I made these for some cousins and dropped them off in a crockpot at their home one night, they raved about them the next day.  I also made them for the superbowl and my husband's family raved about them.  This is a rib recipe I'll definitely keep!

Easy, tasty, a family favorite.  I used bone in baby bcak ribs and a large yellow (sweet onion).  I think more brown mustard would be good too.   This one is a crowd pleaser at my house.

Used 4+ lbs of bone-in country ribs, still had plenty of sauce for them.  Followed the recipe with the exception of being out of regular onions (how did that happen?!) so I used pearl onions.  I also used pure maple syrup.  I goofed and didn't get them on in time for the recommended 8-9 hours, so I browned them first, put them in the slow cooker on High for 4 hours, then turned down to low for 2+, came out fine.  Served with roasted potatoes which were great with a little sauce drizzled over them.  The sauce did end up thin, but that didn't matter, it's not meant to be gravy.  Plenty of flavor when these are done.  Very much enjoyed, will make again.  Thanks!

This was pretty good- I did find that the sauce thinned out quite a bit, so it didn't really cling to the ribs- and they didn't fall apart like I had hoped. But it did have good flavor and it is definitely an easy and yummy dinner- and perfect since we don't have a grill. Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding recipe! I did boil my ribs first (20 minutes or so) to cut the fat, but I am sure they would still be great if you didn't. We are having the leftovers tomorrow/ pulled pork sammies. So tasty! I'll be making these often.

I seasoned the ribs with some season salt, chili powder, garlic, and pepper.  Used Roasted Garlic honey BBQ sauce, and mixed 2 kinds of mustard. WOW!!!
