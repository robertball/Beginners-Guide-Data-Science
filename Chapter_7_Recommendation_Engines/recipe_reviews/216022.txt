I love apple crisp and its so easy but this was fun!  I cut the sugar in half and used whole wheat flour. I cooked it a little slower, as suggested, and it turned out fine. Thanks for this recipe, it is a keeper!

Perfect mix!  I suggest cooking at a lower temp however.  I think I'll try 375 next time.  Def a keeper.

Rolling out the dough was not a necessary step.  I just poured the "crumbles" out from the mixing bowl into the pie pan and then pressed it into the bottom and up the sides, like I would a graham cracker crust.  Quick and easy.

This Is Probably The Best Pie I've Ever Had. It Is So Crisp And Chewy. The Only Problem With It Is The Topping. That Was Much Too Sweet.

Made everything and realized I was missing cinnamon. Ended up using Quaker quick oats with Apple Cinnamon as a substitute and it surprisingly worked perfectly.

My favorite new pie that I have come across.  I wish I had taken my own picture because it came out beautiful and delicious.  The crust is very different and melts in your mouth.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!

Not a fan of this. Very bland and not much flavor. Way too much butter and flour and spices just didn't make to through the floury taste. Didn't like the cream cheese in the crust either. So sorry, I'm sure you worked very hard to perfect your recipe. I will not be making this again.

I doubled the topping, used a regular crust, and baked about 50 mins.  I also used Mcintosh apples.  It turned out delicous!!
