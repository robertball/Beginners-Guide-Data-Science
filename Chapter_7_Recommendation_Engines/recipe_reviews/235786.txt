I used almonds instead of peanuts, coconut milk instead of milk.  It was good enough!

I liked it with a change. I'm wasn't so sure about peanuts in my smoothie...almonds or walnuts maybe but not peanuts. I added an organic packet of chai oatmeal which contains oats, quinoa, chai spices in place of the peanuts. I left out the strawberries since they are out of season right now. Overall it was good and I would make this again.

I used agave syrup instead of maple syrup and I did not put nuts in (as I am allergic). I also used rice milk. It was very good and I will be making it again!

Tastes great! I love the different ideas to tweak it. Having this once a day is an easy way to get most of your servings of fruits and veggies in!

Used a full banana, peanut butter (instead of peanuts), (stevia instead of syrup) and coconut milk but i really like the taste of this smoothie. the taste of the kale blends right in with the strawberry banana flavor. also added some ice
