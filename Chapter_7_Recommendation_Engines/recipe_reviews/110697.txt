This is a great cheesecake.  I do recommend using a 8in graham cracker pie crust.  It took about 1 hour to cook in the 6in.

This was wonderful!  My husband is diabetic, so I used regular cream cheese, but used no-sugar-added apple pie filling (Great Value brand from WalMart) and Smucker's Sugar Free Caramel Topping (both use Splenda), which probably reduced the carbs further.  It is delicious, and doesn't taste at all like a low-cal product.

The flavor was a little on the bland side.  Also it did not store well.
