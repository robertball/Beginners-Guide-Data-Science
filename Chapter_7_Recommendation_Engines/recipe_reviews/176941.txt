I think this foood was very scrumptious and healthy. I made this every night for last two weeks and i feel like a million bucks. It might also have to do with the steroids i took.....

Very refreshing and a nice twist on green tea!  I used fresh berries that I froze and added some lemon slices.  Great idea!

This is good. I'm not sure I can taste the berries, but it's pretty & I can't wait to eat them at the end!

Strange and awkwardly delicious.  I like it.  I brewed my herbal green/ginger tea and then added the frozen fruit to chill it.  This would make for a good July 4th party drink because of the colors.  Just throw it into a huge punch bowl.

I never would have thought of mixing berries with green tea. This is a refreshing and pretty drink and was a hit at the baby shower I hosted.  Thanks for sharing, I will make this again.

As a tea lover, I did not enjoy this recipe.  The fruit made it difficult to swallow the tea and the color of the tea made the drink visually unappealing.

Pretty good, but a little watered down. Next time I will try fresh fruit instead of frozen.

I used a raspberry white green tea that I brewed, then cooled. Thank you for the idea. I think I might blend them together next time, see if that's easier to drink.

This is a nice change from the regular green tea. Very refreshing and tasted great. I think that would go well with other frozen fruits like peaches or mangos.

Has anyone tried pureeing the berries before mixing them in the tea to release more flavor?  I did today with strawberries and blueberries and tho the texture was weird, I like it a lot.
