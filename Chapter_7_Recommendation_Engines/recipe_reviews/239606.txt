These were amazing! My first attempt at gluten free waffles.  Used combination of buckwheat, rice and coconut flours and used buttermilk, olive oil and coconut sugar. My family liked these even better than my usual wheat flour waffles.  Now that we are eating gluten free this will be my new basic waffle recipe. Looking forward to experimenting with different gluten free flours.  Thanks stairguy for this awesome recipe!

I never thought I would be able to enjoy pancakes again after learning I was sensitive to wheat and gluten. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I am also sensitive to eggs and dairy so I used almond milk and egg replacer. I used applesauce instead of the oil like the author said you could. I don't make waffles any more because I am on a low fat diet so I used an ungreased electric skillet and made pancakes. All I can say is that these were amazing! They taste so close to regular pancakes that I thought I was in heaven while eating them. Thank you for this recipe. :)

Very versatile and infinitely forgiving recipe.  The description is right on, the waffles do get a great crispy outer shell even if you change up the ingredients, they are definitely for people who like buckwheat and the half creamer and half milk does make notable changes in the outcome.  I made two and a half batches of these.  Batch 1: I used cream and milk along with "dark" buckwheat flour.  This version came out almost cake-like and somewhat dense, still good though.  I couldn't get them out of the waffle iron and thought it may be my machine so I made pancakes out of the rest of the batter and they came out nicely.  Batch 1.5:  I used "dark" flour, half kefir and half milk and they were rich and dense and had a noticeable nutty flavour and crunch-a bit heavy though. Batch 2: I made with "light" flour and milk.  These came out light and tender, not fluffy or cake-like.  Batch two was more what I consider a "regular" waffle: crispy outside and airy inside.  The taste of buckwheat was evident in the batch 2, but not as powerful as with the dark flour.  All versions are very good.  In the end, this recipe allows you to play around and experiment; but the original recipe-the way it is given-turns out a delicious waffle and stands up to its claims.  Thanks stairguy for the treat!

I have been cooking gluten free for decades and I like buckwheat. I substituted coconut milk for the milk and erythritol for the sugar to comply with my food intolerances. These were very good and my husband did not whine a bit. The leftover waffles were good too and came out of the toaster crispy.

I have always made buckwheat waffles for my dad (92!) but we are GF at home and I needed a good recipe for scratch waffles....these are amazing!  I used a bit more regular milk (all I had on hand), brown rice flour instead of almond flour (again, on hand), 2 tablespoons of sugar and the rest the same.  YAYYYYYYY thanks for the recipe!!!

I made these with olive oil substitution for a more savory taste and texture, and they came out delicious. Kept longer on the waffle iron for added crispness, this will probably become a staple in my diet.

These were fantastic! I could not tell they were gluten free.  BUT, I used presidents choice gluten free flour for both of the flours mentioned in the recipe.

Finally a good gluten free waffle recipe!! I liked that it didnâ€™t have too strong of a buckwheat flavor,and they were moist. Since I have to eat dairy free,I substituted almond milk and they still got great.

Very good.  I used Acadian light buckwheat flour, so the flavor was very mild.  I substituted stevia for the sugar and it worked fine, but perhaps the sugar would have made them a bit crispier.  When I cooked them a bit longer they crisped up more. I used almond milk soured with t. vinegar and it was fine.  My only criticism is that they were too salty for me.  I will use 1/2 t. salt next time.  Very easy, great recipe--Thanks!!!

I replaced buckwheat with all purpose gluten free flour.  These turned out great!  I had to add a little more milk to thin out the batter but the whole family loved them.

I'm staying at an Airbnb, and my host had buckwheat flour and a waffle iron, so I looked up this recipe and adjusted it both to my needs and what I had available. First of all, I QUARTERED the recipe, since I was just making enough for my own breakfast, so keep that in mind! I didn't have almond flour available, so I used 1/4 c buckwheat flour and 1/4 c coconut flour instead. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil,can't used about 2 1/2 tbsp (since coconut flour is heavier than almond flour and needs more moisture). I also used a whole egg (since it's hard to halve an egg). Finally, since I didn't have any alternative milks (I can't do lactose), I subbed in water for the milk (at first, I used about a third of a cup, but again, since the coconut flour was heavy, the batter was still too thick, so I kept adding more water until it was the right consistency - at least half a cup, in the end). I then ate the waffles with strawberry preserves and maple syrup. This was quite tasty, if a little dry (I would use more oil maybe?), and ends up having a pleasant slight coconut aftertaste.

Yes, the result is very nice, but definitely needs more sugar
I added 1/4 cup maple syrup.
Yes I'll make it again.
