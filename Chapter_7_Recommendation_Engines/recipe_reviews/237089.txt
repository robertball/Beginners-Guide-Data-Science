I found that the "batter" would not stick at all. I added an egg and increased the flour to 1/3 of a cup, then they would form patties.

recipe delivers a solid red lentil sandwich. Easy and satisfying. I will enjoy them again. Found 1/3 cup of mixture per patty was plenty big enough. While eating them, and cutting the finished sandwich in half, they squish in the bun somewhat.

I loved this recipe. Even my picky teenage son ate one! Stored easily for lunches at work for the week too.

Very flavourful! Baked them in the oven at 350 for about 12-15 minutes per side.

Shocked.  Very recent vegetarian again.  I've never had a 'meatless' burger before.  I didn't expect it to be bad, but I did not expect to like it as much as I do.  Great texture and good taste. Love the garlic!

My 11 year old omnivore son ate the whole thing and enjoyed it.  

I varied a little from the recipe as I have an abnormal physical and neurological response to Corn, Soy and Wheat.
I was out of white onions, so I used 4 green onions.
Due to my issues, I can't have over-the-counter mustard, so I added mustard powder and apple cider vinegar.
I also added a tablespoon of Chili Powder, because I like Chili powder.
Right at the end, I added some coconut oil to the pan and the top of the burgers to give it some sizzle and buttery goodness.

I used Arrowroot starch and Cassava flour in equal portions instead of 'baking flour'.  The starch really helped to make definite patties, this gets you a thicker texture, and not a 'loose burger' like you might get with just flour.  Like another review mentioned, I used about 3x more of the flour/starch than the recipe called for.

The texture held up great on a bun, and it was chewy enough to make you feel like you were eating a hamburger.  My goal was not to reproduce the Hamburger taste, but to have a reliable protein that is portable and easy to eat.

Next day, it reheated well.  I just ate it for lunch with some home-made mayo and tomato slice.

It is difficult to make a veggie burger, this burger was not a good one.
