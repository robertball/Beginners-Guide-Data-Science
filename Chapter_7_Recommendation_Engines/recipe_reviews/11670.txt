I was disappointed with this one, it seemed rather bland, i did not care for the crunchy vegetables. if i were to make it again i would saute the vegetables and spice it up.

I had to really spice this one up because my family likes spicy. Used basil, oregano, garlic salt, and romano cheese. Also grilled and marinated my chicken for more flavor! Next time I would use Italian tomatoes instead.

Well, I only followed the ingredients, but not the quantity as I cooked according to my fridge's content :P. I used more vegetable and less chicken, added red bell pepper instead of carrots and also used fresh tomato and a can of tomato paste. Added seasoning to my taste - sugar, oregano, basil, lemon - used 4grains spaghetti, and I really think this dish was delicious!! A very good base to work with!!

This was great and fairly easy.  Used Italian diced tomatoes.  Filling for low-calories, too!

i was worried about the crunchiness of some of the veggies like carrots so i simmered them with the onions. I also didnt have any summer squash so i doubled the zucchini. And used others suggestions of adding a little extar garlic and some red pepper flakes for a kick. I also didnt measure veggie quantity the more the merrier. WOW WAS THIS GOOD mmmmm tasty and healthy I ate leftovers daily for days.

This was very good. It smelled delicious. I added some portabella mushrooms, extra garlic, and red pepper flakes that were suggested in another review. Next time I will add my carrots when I am sauteing the onions to make sure they are bot so crisp. Thanks much!

This recipe is definately a keeper!  I made a few minor changes and it was delicious!  Even the kids liked it and they often turn up their noses to vegetables!  The only changes I made were to use Italian Style Tomatoes and I added a bit of Tastefully Simple Seasoned Salt to the mix.  The best "healthy" dinner I have ever had!

We basically followed the recipe, but working out of the Garden. We spiced with Salt Pepper Garlic. Fresh Sweet Basil, Fresh Oregano. Only Zuchinis and Bell Peppers and Onions on hand,  and of course parmsan Cheese. My wife asked for a contingency.... But we didn't need it It was delicious and simple. The 5 yrold liked it, The 7 yr old Liked it, Mom Liked it, and me I thought it was wonderful. Served over spaghetti

This was really good. I used fresh tomatoes and left out the zucchini and squash. I topped it with fresh basil before serving.
