This drink keeps for a long time; just like other milk based liqueurs (ie. Baileys, Kahlua).  I prefer to keep mine in the freezer or the fridge just out of preference

I had creamy limoncello at an Italian restaurant, and was told it was a secret family recipe.  I decided I MUST find the recipe!  Here it was!  Thank you!  It turned out just like the restaurant version!
I made a batch before Christmas, as gifts, and for us.  We finished ours in late February (kept in fridge) and it was just as good as it was in December.  
Do be sure to buy organic lemons, so you won't have pesticides on the zest.

Not my first time making this, but I did venture out a bit.  YES, you can use whipped cream vodka, if you dare.  YES, a teaspoon of vanilla into cooled milk mixture enhances the flavor.  Definitely use Meyers lemons if you can get them.  They are so much more smooth, less bitey, than regualr lemons. Cheers!

This is great.  Very easy to make but it does make alot and since it's largely milk, you need to be sure to have some drinkers around!

I love cream Limoncello

I have not made this one but I noticed that two people had problems with it "curdled" @FLAMINGO6719 @jkoziol

Dairy can curdle for several reasons this might help.  

High heat can cause curdle; and with the addition of an acid the probability is higher with this. Low and slow.

There might not be enough fat in the milf; skim milk will curdle much more easily than other fattier dairy products.

Dairy will curdle with the addition of acid and why combining the lemon zest and vodka in an airtight container should help reduce the acid and why it needs to sit in a cool, dark space, shaking the container to redistribute the lemon zest.

You can temper the milk by whisking a bit of the lemon vodka ingredients into the dairy, then slowly whisking that mixture back into the pan.

Maybe that will help.

Call me a bit of a daredevil, but i used 1 quart heavy cream ,  used everclear instead of vodka, and upped the the alcohol level  a bit as well . Stronger than others I've had, but thats just how I roll.  :0)

This is delicious and so easy.  Much cheaper than buying creamy limoncello too.  All the adults at my party enjoyed this drink.  Thanks for the posting.  Don't know how long it will last in the refrigerator, but if you freeze it, you will have it for a good long time.

This was good and I definitely would make again. The lemons I used were really large so I used 6 instead of 8. It was still too bitter so I added about a cup of half and half because that's all I had. That  did the trick.  Next time I definitely would use smaller lemons and add whole milk or half and half for some of the milk.

This recipe is as good as the limoncello my mother in law brought back from Italy!!! It’s worth the wait. I have made half recipes so I can taste test it. I’ve made it 3 times and I have used 1%, 2% and whole milk. I prefer it to be more creamy so, I personally like it best with whole milk. I recommend this to anyone that likes lemon. It has a big liquor taste and is quite strong and very good!

Pretty good. Needed a bit more sugar. A bit of vanilla would have probably been good. It was a bit stronger than I would have thought

I marked this recipe as a flat out FAIL in my collection. I followed the directions, exactly, and when I combined the lemon mixture and the milk mixture, all I had was a curdled mess.  Totally lost all my ingredients and had to throw it all away. I was so disappointed!

There is a restaurant in Pittsburgh that we would go to just for their limoncello at the end of the dinner.   reading this recipe,  I realized that it had to at least get close.   I did everything according to the recipe and used all of the milk called for except for a pint that I made up for with half and half.   it is wonderful.  it's creamy with just the right lemony flavor. a definite favorite!

I made this to go along with our Italian-themed Christmas dinner and it came out great!  We bought a fancy bottle for this, and filled it as well as a medium-sized pitcher, so be sure to have more than just a bottle on hand to pour this delicious mix into.  Also, with the amount of milk in this recipe, this WILL freeze if you leave it in the freezer too long (I speak from experience).  If that happens, it's ok, just leave it out for an hour or two and it melts pretty quickly.

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make. I followed what one other user did, and used 1 cup of half and half, as well as added some vanilla extract once it was cooled. It is strong, but I couldn't put my glass down! Definitely keeping this n my files, for future use!  

note** I did go past the 2 day mark, as I was working and forgot to take out the vodka mixture. I'm not sure if it would be even better after just the 5 day wait period....but even at 7 days, it was incredible to me! ?

My friends all make Lemonchello, but now I'm the first one to make creamy style. Very good! Maybe next time I'll add some food coloring.
