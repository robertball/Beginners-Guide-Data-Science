Step 3: The egg is also supposed to go in the blender with the other ingredients.

I went and pick fresh blueberry from my local blueberry farm, so I needed a recipe and boy I'm glad I picked this one. I had a hard time finding a blueberry pie recipe with flax. I am not a fan of graham crack crust, but the blend of the almond and flax gave it a nutty sophisticated flavor that is so easy to make! I am not a pie crust making person. I always mess up and have to start over since I do not make pies often, but this one is so simple a elementary school kid could make it! The 4 cups of blueberries is the most I've ever seen in a blueberry pie recipe, but man you really know you're eating blueberry pie when you bite into this one. I added more butter to the crust recipe (1/2 cup total) which made it easier to apply to the 9inch pie dish as well as making it more buttery. I made extra crumble for the top because I don't know about everyone else, but I never seem to have enough pie crust. I cooked this pie for 30 minutes, the top seemed to start browning too much, when cooled it had the consistency of pudding, is this what it's supposed to be like? Or should it be firmer like a cheese cake? Anyway try it! You won't be disappointed!

I made this recipe as-is, which is rare for me! Only change was two use fruit-flavoured yogurt cups to make up for the amount of plain non-fat yogurt. The pie wasn't the least bit sweet, blueberries at their purest! I do think after discussing it with my tasters that the filling could be improved by adding some lemon or other citrus zest to give it that kick needed to make this five-star. I love the nutty taste of the crust and crumble- I had enough to completely cover the top of the pie so I did, and evenly spread it out. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

I tried this pie while it was still slightly warm and thought it was just ok. When I tried it the next day after the pie had chilled completely it was fantastic! What a delicious, healthy dessert! Also, I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I had a good bit of the topping left over. I saved it to mix in with greek yogurt for breakfast the next morning. Delicious! Oh, I also used frozen blueberries, but may try thawing them next time.

Excellent!  Iove the flavor and texture and the fact that this dessert is healthy!  

l improved slightly as follows:  replaced the egg with flax to lower the cholesterol, used all nonfat greek yogurt - some plain, some blueberry instead of sour cream; and replaced the sugar with blue agave nectar (low-glycemic sweetener) for my diabetic husband.  Also, I used almost all blackberries + some blueberries.

The blueberries flavour was lost. Possibly too much pastry.
I would not make it again

Gooood!  I didn't feel guilty about eating this dessert. I used all nonfat greek yogurt , 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and half butter half coconut oil. Definately something we will make again! Thanks Hungry yet? for sharing your recipe with us!
