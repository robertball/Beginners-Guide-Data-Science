I've made this recipe quite a few times, and I've started adding about 3/4 of a can of chopped green chilis to the recipe.  It adds a little bit of color and texture, and a little more 'kick' to the cheeseball!

I, as did several other "taste testers" did not think this was hot at all.  I even used a cheese called Fiery Fiesta (has habenero peppers in it!) and all we could taste was worcestershire sauce and I even backed off on it!  I only used 1/2 t. of the worcestershire sauce.  If I tried it again I think I'd eliminate the worcestershire sauce, use hot sauce instead and use 3c pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and ex-sharp cheddar.

An excellent cheese ball.  And I don't normally get excited over cheese balls.  Don't let the name scare you.  It won't set you on fire.  Just great flavor.  I always get requests for the recipe.  I toast almonds, and chop them fine for the outer layer.  Another alternative is toasted sesame seeds on the outside.  I always do for a Thanksgiving app.  Travels well and can do the day b4.

This cheese ball rocks! I made it for my husband's Christmas party and it was the first thing to go. I cut the Worchestshire sauce in half and added 1 tsp. horseradish. Excellent!

The title is very misleading, as this is not a "Hot" cheese ball. I highly recommend using a mixer to mix everything and then add items to your taste. Per the other reviews, I reduced the Worcestershire to 1/2 Tbsp. I was out of garlic powder, so I added 1 tsp minced garlic.  After many testings I ended up adding 1 tsp horseradish, 1/2 tsp Gator Hammock hot sauce, and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. For easier shaping, I shaped the cheese ball in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge so when it came out it was ready to go. It turned out great!

Made this for my parents Christmas party and it was the first thing gone!!  I used a pepper jack that used habanero pepper so after sitting the cheeseball does have a little more kick.  It was great.

Very fast and easy to put together.  Has a nice flavor but I wouldn't call it a hot pepper cheese ball as it has a very mellow flavor and I followed the recipe exactly.  That being said I would make it again.  Also be sure you take it out of the fridge about an hour before serving so it spreads easily and for better flavor.

This is a very tasty cheese spread.  Don't let the name fool you-the pepper jack cheese gives the spread just enough kick to make it interesting, but not hot.  I made this recipes for New Year's Eve and my husband and I both really enjoyed it.  I will be making this again!

I made this for a girls get together and it was perfect.  I will not use sharp cheddar next time, will substitute more pepper jack cheese.  Everyone loved it and we all split the leftovers.  I will use this recipe again.

Very easy to do ahead of time and really tasty!  I added pickled jalapenos and used Dijon mustard instead of mayo and it is perfectly tangy for my family's taste.  Great on toast as a sandwich too!

This was a great recipe. Although I did make a few changes as most viewers do to make it their own. I will be posting this as a new recipe. It will be named "Jacks Balls". This was a GREAT starter recipe. :-) Thank you!

I have made this cheese ball several time just since Christmas! I follow the directions almost exactly, but have found that a can of deviled ham makes it even more flavorful! It also, makes for a larger cheese ball or makes two medium balls. I love this recipe!

Pretty good.  I added a 4 oz. can of chopped jalapenos for a little heat.  It was much, much hotter the next day, so be careful when adding jalepenos!  I didn't have the Worcestershire, but I didn't worry about it as several reviewers thought it was overpowering or cut it back a little.  I think I'll pop it in the oven next time with the pecans on top.

YUMMY! All I done different was chopped a whole green chili pepper and added a little more pepper jack cheese, really good, not too hot.

This was OK, others liked it but I wasn't a fan & I usually really enjoy cheese balls :)  Won't make it again, but it was fun to try it out.

I used two cups pepper jack cheese and one of the cheddar so it would be a bit spicier. The flavor was much better after a day than when first made. I rolled in pecans and fresh bacon bits. Not as creamy as I'd like it, I had to add in a bit more mayo to make it creamier, but everybody loved it at our dinner party.

Wonderful cheese ball!  Not spicy at all, very smooth and satisfying.  I made this ball for a Christmas function and forgot to take it!  When I got home, I stuck it in the freezer and took it to a party 2 weeks later.  It was still great!  I used the option of adding the chopped green chilies too.  Try!

I followed the recipe, including the full amount of Worcestershire sauce, and this was the best cheese ball I have ever tasted!  The only minor changes I made were to divide them into 2 cheese balls (and they were still pretty big at that) and I coated them in chopped almonds since I don't like pecans.  I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was an absolute hit!  Not only did all of it get devoured, but I had several requests for the recipe.  As others have noted, though, this is not a HOT cheese ball, but that is how we all liked it.  If you want it hotter, I would suggest adding in some hot sauce to suit your taste when mixing it up.  If all you've ever had is a cheese ball you've bought from the store, then you are missing out - you NEED to make this recipe, you will not be sorry!  UPDATE 4/29/16 - these freeze SO WELL!  I doubled the recipe, divided it into 5 cheese balls, wrapped them in plastic wrap and then put them in a large freezer bag.  To defrost, I just place one in the fridge a day or two before I need it and it's perfect.  I made them 6 months ago and I just used the last one this week - it still tasted awesome and freezing does not hurt the texture.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck.  It was my first time making a cheeseball and I thought that it was very good. I got a lot of compliments on it.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo and I think I will only use 1 tbls next time instead of 2.  I also rolled it in crunched up almonds instead of pecans.  I think the pepperjack cheese gave it the perfect amount of kick.  I will be making this again.  
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I am giving this 5 starts because I think it is just an error that the small can of green chiles is missing.  The green chiles are a must.  Otherwise you don't have a hot pepper cheese ball.  Even with the chiles it is very mild and a family favorite

even after adding green chilis, really didn't have much zip or flavor that left me wanting more ... felt apologetic to the host of the party we went to.  Very little got eaten, and I am not known for making bombs :s  May back up an punt if I attempt another

This recipe turned out perfect exactly as written.  Make sure you let it chill for a couple of hours after you make it to let all of the flavors blend together nicely.  It will not taste good as soon as it's mixed, letting it rest makes it amazing!  Thanks for the recipe!  I had tons of compliments and multiple requests for the recipe.

I made this exactly as written and it was just okay.   It didn't have much flavor to suit our liking. I'll make again and add additional items to give it more kick.

A good cheese ball, and certainly not hot and spicy. Even children can eat it. My family doesn't care for pecans on a cheese ball, so I omitted them.
