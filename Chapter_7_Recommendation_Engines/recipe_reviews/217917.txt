Anything BUT standard.  Rich, delicious and decadent - just looking at them tells you so.  I baked half a recipe in an 8x8 foil-lined pan, 23 minutes.  No bakiing powder ensures these are NOT cakey.  As for the frosting, it turns out exactly as the instructions say it will, right down to the stiff peaks.  Fluffy and almost mousse-like.  This is no run-of-the-mill brownie.

OMG!!! The best brownies I have ever had. I agree that this recipe is a bit time consuming however, I also agree it is worth every single second of your time. The topping of whipped chocolate ganache frosting would be a great topping to "frost" any cake as well.

These brownies are to die for. Soooo good! And the frosting, its fantastic like a whipped ganache almost. The only thing I did differently was the cooking time. I reduced it to 20 minutes and they came out perfectly.

Chocolatey amazingness. These are my go-to "time of the month brownies". They will be dry at 35-min, 25-minutes is PERFECT. The frosting is WELL WORTH the effort - it's what sets these brownies apart from all the other brownie recipes! Just FYI, 12oz = 1.5 cups. I serve mine with a scoop of vanilla ice cream... It is dessert perfection!!

The frosting is amazing!  ...and I don't typically like frosting haha.  The brownies turned out with an almost pungent bitter-sweet taste though; next time I'll try milk chocolate chips in the mix.  thanks for sharing!

I had Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chips and semi-sweet Tollhouse chips on hand -- so for the batter, I did a 50-50 mix and then made the error of melting all 24 oz of the chips for the batter than just 1/2 melted and remaining 1/2 stirred in whole....sigh...but I carried on, followed the recipe minus whole eggs (I use EggBeaters) and reduced white sugar by 1/4 c. [I first tried reducing sugar by 1/2 c but batter was too bland]. I would say that the changes did not sacrifice the outcome one bit. The frosting -- sheer decadence. The brownies -- so chocolaty and rich. I would say this makes a brownie that is neither too fudgy nor too cakey -- but bang-on in texture and flavor and THE PERFECT BROWNIE recipe to have if you are going thru the trouble of making from scratch.

This is the best dessert I have made on this site! so rich and creamy! I will be making this every time Chocolate chips and Whipping cream are in my house at the same time! (good with variations too: try with grated orange zest , or peppermint crushed in. or peanut butter layer! sinful!)

I did step 4 first so the mix for the frosting could chill while the brownies baked.  I've also used this frosting on the "ultimate brownie"  recipe made 1 and a half recipe batch of that for a 9x13 size pan its a "cakier recipe" that worked well with this frosting.  I would use this frosting on a cake too.  It's delicious!

My.husband.loved.these! He really liked the different texture of the frosting & brownie. I gave some of it away to my kids and they also loved it! I made them EXACTLY as the recipe stated and didn't change a thing. I had to freeze some, and it freezes well also. He said they are very rich, and could only eat a small piece. Thank you for a great recipe - it's a keeper!

Excellent! Hands down the BEST brownies I've ever tasted.  So rich and decadent. My only "complaint" the small portion you can eat in one sitting due to their richness.  Helpful hint: have lots of milk ready.

The whipped ganashe is next level good! I melted the chocolate and butter and cream in my Kitchen Aid bowl over a double boiler pot of water instead of heating it in a pot on the stove to reduce dishes.

The base is very dense due to so much chocolate, both melted and folded in. The frosting is almost a ganache, but the addition of butter makes the "ganache" too firm and crumbly in texture. I was expecting the frosting to be soft and creamy, but it become very stiff after chilling on the brownies, so that it lifted right off in a layer or chunks as I cut the pieces.

Wow, what a wonderful recipe! These are so rich that having one half the size of your average brownie feels like having three! I followed the recipe as stated. The frosting changes greatly in color when you whip it after it chills - Mine changed from very, very dark brown to pale brown. The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is that it didn't cut well - Some of the pieces were like eating brownie mush (but delicious mush, without a doubt). Perhaps they'll slice better when they're completely cooled, but I love a brownie that's a little warm. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I was very proud of this frosting. I don't eat sugar anymore, so substitute everything with Splenda. it was big and creamy and fluffy. I cheated and bought a sugar free cake.

I thought the brownies were quite dry. The frosting was okay. Because of the time required to make these, I doubt I'll be giving it another try.

Was a bit dry for my liking, would prefer a more of a fudgy moist texture;next time I'd substitute butter for vegetable oil to get the texture I like. Waaaay too much chocolate in the brownie mix. I'd highly recommend cooking this recipe for 25 minutes otherwise you'll end up with a burnt edges. Frosting was delicious I'd recommend mixing it for 1 minute (instead of 3-5min) unless you want chocolate soup.
