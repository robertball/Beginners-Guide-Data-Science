Simple and chic, people will be wondering where you bought it.  I might suggest using Chili sauce in place of ketsup...This is a quick one you'll love.

I made this for a wine tasting party. My guests loved it, but it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked for it to be. It was kind of grainy, and the flavors were almost too understated. If I make it again, I'll probably add a lot of Tabasco or other spicy sauce or dill pickles to give it more character.

A really easy, lovely recipe that looks wonderful on the plate.  I lined a terrine mold with plastic wrap (one sheet of cling wrap draped over the three longest sides, and then smoothed down) so the terrine came easily out of the mold - just try & keep the plastic smooth so you don't get huge creases in your terrine!  Overall, this was tasty, but  the texture of mine was super smooth.  I think next time I'd try blending it a little less or adding finely diced green onions after the processing step, to create a little texture.

Always love to find dips that have a wow factor and this one looked great.  Used a glass bowl for the mould and spent ages trying to get the mousse out without ruining it.  Guest enjoyed it, but it certainly wasn't the hit I was expecting.

was looking for a selection of Spanish appetizers - this one is very similar to a tuna pate' recipe that my mom makes, but the terrine treatment was unique -- delicious!
