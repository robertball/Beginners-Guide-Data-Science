The acidity of the tomatoes prevented the potatoes from becoming tender in only 30 minutes.  I cooked the mixture over an hour and a half, checking the potatoes every 15 minutes after the initial 30 minutes to ensure they were softened. I tasted for seasoning and added two teaspoons of Emeril's Cajun spice mixture (recipe for spice mixture at FoodNetwork.com) and tripled the hot sauce before adding the catfish. I have never eaten fish in a stew or soup, but since I'm trying to incorporate more fish into my diet, I wanted to give this recipe a try. The texture of the fish was strange to me, at first.  I have to say it smelled wonderful while cooking.  I almost used olive oil and left  the bacon out to save calories and make it healthier. I decided to go ahead and stay as close as possible to the recipe as written.  I love bacon in anything, but I was surprised the scrumptious undertone the bacon gave to this recipe. I'm sure that accounts for the hike in calories. Oh well, I'll try olive oil next time. I think chicken or pork could be substituted for catfish in this recipe with very good results.

This recipe is excellent as-is.  I made a double batch as the recipe stated it was for 4 servings, but that is the only thing wrong with it.  As written, this recipe will feed 12.. easily.  I made cornbread to go with it.  My family gobbled it up.

Very Good!  Hot and spicy.  We pre-cooked the catfish in lemon and pepper, and then simmered for about an hour on the stove until potatoes where done.  We ate the whole thing up.

This Stew was alright. It tasted like more of a tomato soup. Very ordinary, I might make it again, but tweek it by adding broth instead of so many tomatos/tomato sauce. Also, other reviewers suggested upping the time for the potatos, which I did. It ended up simmering for 1 hr. 20 mins.

Excellent dish. I cooked the sauce with the potatoes for over an hour so they became soft. Then I added the catfish and let it cook for another hour on Med-Low heat covered. I also added Tony Chachere's and crushed red pepper along with the Tabasco. I like spicy foods, so add or subtract spices to meet your tastes.

This was my first attempt at catfish stew. I grew up eating it but no one ever had an actual recipe to give me. My sons and husband loved it. I'm not a big fish person but they said it was great. The only change I made was adding some beef broth to it because of how thick it was.
