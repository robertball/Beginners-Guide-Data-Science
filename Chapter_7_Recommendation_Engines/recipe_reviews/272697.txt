Best keto pancakes I've tried so far.  I'm not into the flavor of pork rinds in my pancakes so this one is perfect with almond flour and ricotta.  Much more substantial breakfast.

Didn’t cook correct and wouldn’t hold together. Not fluffy more like a crepe.

These were delish but I made some changes so I'll give it 4 for now.   I am not on a special diet so sweetened w/ splenda.  Then used unsweetened applesauce w/ a drop of monk fruit maple syrup as topping.  I was happy.  The texture is light and I enjoy the flax chew.

I substituted coconut flour but the batter was very thick so I added coconut milk.  Great taste

We didn’t care for these pancakes. They have very little flavor and the texture is custard-like, not very pleasant. Adding fruit and toasted almonds didn’t help much.
