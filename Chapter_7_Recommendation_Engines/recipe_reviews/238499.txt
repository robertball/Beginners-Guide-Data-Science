Simple and delicious plus it's easy clean up - not bad for a quick meal! The marinade was really good and didn't take long at all - basically the time it took to prep the veggies, make the foil packets and whip up some homemade guacamole! I cooked the steak on the grill vs. a foil packet simply because I couldn't bring myself to "steam" a good piece of meat. I put the foil packets for the veggies and tortillas on the grill as well. I did poke a few holes in the veggie packets to allow some of the steam to get out so they weren't soggy. Overall, very good especially with all the fixen's - cheese, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream!

The seasoning & marinade portion of this recipe is spot on. The foil packages make short work of clean up for sure.  I decided to make this with chicken instead of beef, as I thought it would lend itself a bit better to being cooked in the foil packets.  I missed the 'char' flavor that I love so much about fajitas but for a fast, delicious no fuss dinner this was very good.

Very good flavor, and will definitely use this recipe in the future. My issue is that I'd rather grill the steak and saut√© the veggies and not waste foil on something like this. I use foil a lot but it seems unnecessary in this recipe.

I think the biggest , yet simplest to fix, problem is the WAY the foil is used. Simple leave a large opening ,  not just holes in the foil to allow ALL steam to escape. I personally would do this on flat open foil,  for an " oven fried" taste, then draw foil up loosely around the food to keep warm. The marinate is very good, but I add cumin, garlic powder, and Mexican oregano ( regular oregano works well too) to the chilli powder. I like a blend of EQUAL PARTS (1t. each) of  cumin, garlic powder, oregano, and chilli powder.  That does give  much more of a taco flavor ( b/c of the cumin) but can be adjusted by adding less cumin and slightly more chilli powder. If that is your taste. In fact, I make up that blend of equal parts of those spices  in a 1 to 2 cup jar in my spice  cabinet and use it to make many Mexican foods including tacos. It is cheaper and healthier ( b/c
No over load of salt) than the envelopes that charge $1.00 or so for a single serving.  Overall a quick easy anytime meal that balances some veggies, meat and starch,  in a a convient way. BTW that spice blend makes a great tex mex rub. Hope this gives even more ideas for using  quick easy foil meals. Oh yeah, try theses ideas on a larger scale on a foil cooked pot roast. Just roast L O N G ( a few hrs)and low temp(275)  any weekend. Then serve fejitas  or quesadillas w/ the left overs.

I loved the ease of clean up  and the marinade was very flavorful but I thought the steak was steamed.  I prefer it grilled or broiled.  Perhaps if I had slit the packets and allowed the steam to escape as they cooked it would have worked better for us.  It is a good idea and I can think of other applications.  Thanks for something new.

I followed this recipe and found it easy to make and even easier to clean up!  I've used Reynolds foil to cook many things on my outdoor grill, and this is just another example of making things easy for a busy cook!  Thanks for a great dinner!

I added a few slices of orange bell to the mix for extra color but other than than I made as written. This recipe is super easy and one that would be perfect for a weeknight meal. I marinated the meat for the full hour and was surprised at how well the flavor took. You could taste all of the ingredients in every bite. My only complaint is that 30 minutes cook time on the meat was too long by the time you let it rest. The next time I make this I will only cook it for 20 minutes and then let it rest for a bit. With that being said, this recipe is super easy and sure to please.

Loved the ease of cooking this in the foil packet in the oven. I threw the veggies on top of the steak and cooked it together. It turned out great this way. I think the meat could have used a bit more flavor, but they were still good and easy!

Easy to prepare and easy to clean up! What I love about this recipe is the marinade. I marinated the flank steak for 45 minutes, and the meat was so flavorful! A great choice for Mexican night!

I took the advice of another reviewer and used foil only to line the baking sheet.  I cooked the vegetables to tender crisp in a skillet and served with salsa and corn tortillas.  Yum!

This was good, but my flank steak was very rare after the recommended cooking time. I rewrapped it and stuck it back in for an additional 10 minutes. I like this for an easy weekday meal.

Very easy to prepare with a quick cleanup! I love Reynolds wrap and I had never thought of cooking fajita meat this way! What a great idea, the flavors melded together and made for a delicious meal that even the kids loved! I will make this again.

I missed the CHAR on the meat and veggies that I get when I make them on the grill but the meat marinade gave them good flavor.

Super easy meal and my husband and his football buddies loved it. The Reynolds foil made this very easy to clean up and I even had the guys use foil sheets on their plates, so no dishes to wash. The seasoning was great, all we added was a dash of Tobasco sauce when serving. Will make these again.

This marinade is fantastic! I decided to quickly sear the steak on a cast iron then baked in the oven on a sheet pan. Absolutely delicious! I may season the vegetables next time, but that is the only thing I would change!

I marinated the steak overnight. The meat was flavorful enough for us. I cooked the meat for 30 minutes. And let it rest for 10 however the meat turned out overly well down.  We still made fajitas and the meat wasn‚Äôt dried out, but next time I will only cook it 20 minutes in the oven and rest the meat 10 minutes.  It is super convenient especially if you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt have a grill.  I will try this recipe again.

This is even better then the restaurant steak fajitas. I keep a jar of the marinated in the fridge. So when I'm in the mood for steak fajitas quesadillas I can easily make.

I have made this a few times, and have always enjoyed the flavor and ease of preparation.   Tonight I used a store-bought marinade packet to marinate the steak, but followed all the other steps in the recipe, and it couldn't have been easier!

This is a great recipe. I cooked the meat in a cast iron skillet for a few minutes, then poured the veggies from their foil on top in the skillet and broiled it all for 5 min or so to get that nice char. I also thinly sliced the meat before marinading. Everything else I did as the recipe described. Quick and simple! If you have a Mexican grocery store close you can get the perfect steak for this and it costs very little.

The reviews were spot on except the veggies could have been cooked longer, but we doubled the recipe. Very good with guacamole, Greek yogurt & salsa. Family loved it!

It was good, not wow awesome, but it was still good.   Veggies seemed a bit soggy, but the flavor was decent.  Would probably add more pepper next time to the veggies and maybe some salted butter.  Also, this might be easier to prep if you cut up the steak before cooking or better yet, buy the pre-cut fajita steak strips from the butcher.    Be sure to serve with shredded cheese, guac, and sour cream on the side.  While my family was waiting I made them some fresh guacamole, salsa, and chips with leftover ingredients.  For the guacamole all I did was throw the following into a food processor: just put two avocadoes (pitted), about 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 to 1/2 cup diced tomato,  1 clove garlic minced, a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, 1/4 cup lemon juice and then pulse together until it looks chunky and mixed together.  The trick is to not blend it too much.

My family really likes this dish and it is really good. I have made it a couple of times now and will continue to make it. The one thing I will do next time, as others suggested, is cook the meat on a grill. Having that little extra crispiness and char would send it over the top.

We really liked this recipe.  I used yellow and red bell peppers because it's what I had on hand and I did tweak the spices just a bit for our taste.  I took the advice of the reviewer to cut the time down a bit as I only had 3/4 of a pound of meat and mine was not cooked through once I took it out and let it rest.  I cut from both ends to get enough meat to make us each a fajita, then put the rest bck in the oven for a few more minutes.   We like our steak medium rare, closer to rare, but this was a bit more rare than we like hence the longer bake time on this one.   Nice recipe!   I know now that I can prep everything in the morning in their packets and just throw them in the oven when I get home from work.  PERFECT!   This gives me the time to visit with my husband and have a glass of wine while we wait for it to bake.  After dinner, cleanup is a breeze!   Thanks Reynolds Wrap for this great recipe!
