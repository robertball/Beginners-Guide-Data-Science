This is an unusual salad, no doubt about it.  The sauce is great, but it's anything but healthy.  If I were making this again, I would blanch the cauliflower first, and grill the zuchini with olive oil and some light herbs (a little rosemary).  This way, the salad nice and warm along with the sauce.  I enjoyed eating this salad, but kept thinking "This cauliflower needs to be tender, not crunchy", hence the blanching.  The sauce would be great over some grilled pork chops, tho, which is what I plan on doing with the rest of the yummy camembert I bought!

I loved loved loved this salad.
 The warm dressing is what pulled it altogether. I did not have any zucchini but it still tasted great.

I'm sorry to say this dish just fell completely flat for me. Nothing about it was appetizing enough to try it again.
