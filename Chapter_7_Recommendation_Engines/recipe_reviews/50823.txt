This is amazing!!!  I love it and it's beautiful to boot!  I didn't follow this exactly - I used 7 c. of fruit total - probably 5 c. strawberry/2 c. cranberry, 7 c. of sugar, one packet of pectin, the juice of two tangerines and one lemon and the zest of the tangerines.  The flavor is outstanding.  Mine is just coming to cool now (I did a water bath), so I don't know how set it will be with the extra acidic juice, but we use jam a lot in plain yogurt or on pancakes so we don't mind if it's a bit thin.  Really, really outstanding!!! Added the next day: the jam is cooled and is definitely set like a jam - not thin at all.  And really, really delicious!

This jam is delicious.  It's also convenient because it makes a large amount for many Christmas gifts.  I used frozen strawberries and it turned out perfect!

I LOVED this jam for Christmas gifts! Used 8oz pointsettia jars and it was beautiful. Used 2 lbs of strawberries and 8 cups of sugar, also added 1/2 cup of lemon juice which makes it tarter and redder as well. I got 18 8oz jars out of this recipe.

I made this recipe in 4 oz jars and gave them away for Christmas with a loaf of bread.  I could not believe the compliments-- everyone loved it.  I used frozen strawberies instead of fresh.  Just as good!

Delicious!  Even sweet enough for those who don't like cranberries.  I used about 1/2 the recommended sugar and it was plenty sweet.  In addition, I cooked the whole thing for about 30 minutes to make sure the cranberries were adequately soft for spreading.  I gave it as gifts for the holidays and I've had requests for the recipe.

I made this jam for craft fairs and it was by far the best seller. Excellent for christmas giving. Tastes more like Strawberry than Cranberry.

YUM!  This is the BEST jam recipe I have ever used.  I made it for a craft show, sold out, and got tons of compliments.  I have to make another batch today for Christmas baskets.  I followed the recipe exactly and got perfect results.

I did not have the best of luck with this recipe - it turned out too grainy.  I changed it to 5 cups of strawberries mashed, about a cup of cranberries run through the food processor, 7 cups of sugar and one packet of pectin, oh and a dash of lemon juice, and it came out much better.  Had more of a fruity taste, not so sugary.  I just don't think I broke down the sugar long enough on the orignal batch.

I am so proud of myself (first time making jam). This turned out perfectly for me. I used 10 cups of frozen strawberries, which I thawed a little and chopped up in the processor. I used one bag of fresh cranberries which I also chopped up. I used about 2 cups less than a 5 lb bag of sugar and tried to put the right amount of pectin in - one full packet of 1.75oz and little more of another. This recipe will fill more than 12 8oz jars!! I had only prepared 12 and we have a good sized container's worth left over. The jars turned out great!!

Been making this jam for the past 4 years now. Every Christmas my friends and family get a jar and they always love it! I just add a little orange zest and juice of one orange. I find it really brightens the flavor. Other than that, it's a perfect recipe! And the little bit thats left over always goes on pancakes the next morning. YUM!

Yum! I like chunkier jam, so I think I'll skip chopping the strawberries next time, but otherwise, a great recipe!

Very, very attractive and YUMMY!  I am using as Christmas gifts and I just know that all of my recipients are going to love them.  I didn't understand the title "Sparkling" but because of the strawberry seeds, the jam does look like it is sparkling!  I also used the "Cranana" jam on this website and was very happy with those results as well.  If you try this recipe you will LOVE the results!

I am guilty of modifying the recipe a fair deal because I didn't think it was quite festive enough as is.  I used two 12oz bags of fresh cranberries and 2lbs of frozen whole strawberries.  I also added the zest and juice of one lemon and several healthy dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  I only added about 5-6 cups of sugar and it turned out tart and delicious.  Also, don't waste your time chopping anything, the heat will break down all the fruit and it will be nice and chunky and rustic looking.  Enjoy!

I cut this recipe in half and used this summer's organic strawberries that I froze mid-summer,  though I did use fresh cranberries. I wanted to do a trial run to see if this would be a great jam to add to my holiday gift baskets this year. I did not chop the strawberries, I left them whole and just mashed them slightly with a potato masher a bit after they'd thawed a little. Instead of margerine, I used butter and I just added a teaspoon for the whole half batch. I was able to get four one-pint jars out of a half batch. Very pretty jam and quite good, never mind simple. I'd like to try this with Splenda and see if I get the same result, as I have friends that are diabetic or watching their weight and cannot have sugar.

Fantastic and easy recipe.  I made it today with my 9 year old.  Used 10 cups frozen strawberries, a bag or cranberries,a little orange peel 2 packs of pectin and all but 2-3 cups of sugar.   I made 14.5 eight ounce jars.  Kids loved it and and it will make nice additions to Christmas gift baskets.

I wasn't sure about this jam, but decided to giving it a whirl. Between my mom and I we have entered in the county fair just about every combination of rhubarb, strawberries, and raspberries, so finding recipes we haven't made is a bit difficult. I was stunned to see today that not only did it win 1st place, it won best soft spread! Thank you do much for this DELICIOUS Jam!

Not bad at all -- I halved the recipe as this makes just too much.  Next time I'll up the ratio of cranberries to strawberries as I'd like it a bit more tart.  Also, an immersion blender saved lots of time by avoiding having to chop up the berries in advance.

My girlfriend and I made this for Christmas gifts....It looks beautiful in quilted jars and tastes sweet but tart. Make sure you skim off the foam which will make the jam cloudy. Try one tsp of margerine/butter in pot as your boiling jam.This will help decrease foam.

This is excellent!  My first time making jam and it could not have been easier or come out better.  Very festive looking!  My pkgs of pectin were only 1 and 3/4 oz each so I cut strawberries (I used frozen) down to 8 cups.  I added juice of half a large orange (I read the acid helps jam to jell).  I only added 2 and 3/4 lbs sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Everyone in my family loves it.  Will definitely make again.

I really enjoy this jam, but it's my husband who LOVES it.  He always warns me when we start running low so that I can make some more.  I cut the sugar by about a cup and skip the butter, and it still turns out fine.

Made 12 jars of this today for Christmas gifts!  It tastes wonderful!  I used 3 bags of frozen strawberries and 1 bag of fresh cranberries.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  We had a little leftover so we tried it with dinner and my husband and kids LOVED it.  I ordered custom made labels from a label company to put on the top of the jar to say "Berry Christmas!"  I will make this every year!

This recipe I printed off for my mother, who is a jam maker from way back. She made the first batch, loved it so much she went out and got the ingredients to make a second batch. It's wonderful, not only tastes great but is so beautiful in the jars. I took some to work with me at a resturant and people loved it! My mother will be giving it as Christmas gifts.

I have made this recipe for many years after being given it by a friend Suzanne. This jam is a favorite of mine and those that I give it to. Last July I went to a festival in a small town in Michigan and gave the recipe to a couple of nice ladies who had booths selling jams and jellies. I know it as "Christmas Jam"  It is delicious and what a wonderful sight it is with its rich red color! So appropriate for the Christmas/Holiday season. Betty Bryant

I added more cranberries and only half of sugar for a sweet tart jam that was really great warm or cold. I also used my stick blender to smooth it out.

I made this exactly as wrote. It has great flavor, but mine jelled some, but not quite to jelly stage. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough.....but my family loves it. We call it strawberry surprise topping(since it didn't jell all the way) and put it on ice cream, pancakes and whatever we can. YUMMY...just 4 stars only because of lack of jelling

very yummy... i used about 3/4 of the bag of sugar instead of the whole bag just because i wanted a bit more tartness. This was my first time ever canning and it turned out perfectly, the jam is so tasty. Thank you for posting this recipe :)

I made jam today using this recipe as inspiration.  First time I've done any canning in at least 15 years and I'm happy to say it's like riding a bicycle.  I had no problem remembering the process of making preserves!  I used 4 cups for crushed strawberries, 6 oz cranberries, 1 pkg Sure-Jell, 2 tsp lime juice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 7 cups sugar.  Smells heavenly and tastes divine!

This stuff is wonderful - and it really does sparkle! Made a batch this morn in about an hour - so easy.  Used frozen strawberries (full bag: 40 oz) and fresh cranberries.  Had about 3/4 cup of seedless puree of raspberries and added that too. Also added about 1/4 c lemon juice and 2 cups short of the full 5# of sugar. Great texture.

this is a great recipe--I made it for a craft year and it was a sell out.  It makes a full 12 jars which is great.  I cut the sugar down slightly to about 2.5 lbs so you dont lose the tart from the cranberry.  Thanks

Just finished making a batch and it is seriously SO tasty!  I only wish I had made the homemade bread first so I could spread some jam on it right now!  I ended up using a little less sugar (8.5 cups) because I wanted a hint of tartness to the jam.  It is wonderful!  I'm so excited to give it away as part of a Christmas Basket this year!

OMG good!!  This was loved by all.  I used 7 cups of the chopped strawberries (no cranberries on hand), 7 cups of sugar, 1 package (1.75 oz) of powdered pectin, and juice of a lemon.  I followed the cooking directions exactly and put the jars in a water bath for 5-10 minutes.  This made 8 half pint jars of preserves.

This recipe gets five stars because the combination of flavours is so delicious. The actual recipe was standard for jam making and so was no more special than most jam recipes, but this made it easy.

This was really thin when I put it in the jars & I was afraid it wouldn't set, but it turned out great.  I used some glass jars & some plastic.  I boiled the glass ones full of jam like the recipe says, but didn't boil the plastic & they still turned out fine.  Added orange zest & juice of one orange.  This is by far one of the best jams I've had!  Not too sweet, but plenty of flavor & texture.  I made toast at 9 pm last night just to try it out!

I made this recipe twice this week and followed the recipe as is using frozen strawberries & cranberries.  Could not get it to jell up.  The second time I even used another box of fruit pectin for a total of three boxes with no luck.  I don't believe I will try again. Very disappointed because I wanted to give away at the holidays.

INCREDIBLE TASTE!!!!!! This was a very easy recipe to follow.  I've made two batches of this so far and plan to give them away as gifts for Christmas this year.  The first batch have already been distributed amongst staff and they gave rave reviews.  The second batch, I added mandarin liquer which I believe enhances the taste.  I was able to make between 10-12 pint size jars with this recipe. A definite keeper recipe which I plan to continue to make this each year as my traditional Christmas Gift along with a loaf of homemade bread. Many thanks for this posting!!!!!!

This might have been the EASIEST recipe for jelly/jam I have ever made - and the colors make it so appropriate for this time of year - very festive, very fruity too.  I used frozen strawberries as well - and this recipe made (16) 8 oz. jars - perfect Christmas gifts!  Thanks for sharing!

I scaled this back to a single jar (12 oz) and made it in my bread machine.  I couldn't wait for it to cool and gel, so I dipped fresh bread into it and was in heaven.  This is a keeper and will be made full-size this year for Christmas gifts!

Delicious.  Easy to make and great for gifts.  We got 15 half-pint jars out of this one recipe.  Update:  Used 1 bag of cranberries, 1 40-ounce bag of frozen strawberries, 8 cups sugar, 2 pouches pectin.  This time we got 11 half-pint jars plus a little left over.  I'm wondering if one pouch of pectin would have been enough.

This came out amazing! I have failed at so many jams and this recipe gave me my "jam" confidence back...thank you! I had forgotten to chop the cranberries so mid way through cooking I threw the whole thing in the blender then tossed it back on the stove. I was a bit worried this would ruin it but it gave it a smooth consistency and its not chunky at all. This will surely become a tradition. Thank you so much for sharing.

The recipe was great. I made a half batch at first to make sure I liked it, made it again the next morning.

The only alteration I did was cutting out a cup of sugar.

Even though it is nowhere near the holidays (unless you count Indipendence Day!),  I just finished making this with fresh strawberries.  I used a little less sugar (about 4 pounds plus 1 cup), but even before it cooled we spread some on bread with butter, and it was set up very nicely.  We are looking foreward to it cooling and eating more!

This recipe made perfect strawberry/pomegranite jam.  I gave it as gifts this Christmas and already have "orders" for more come next fall.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  I split the fruits 3/4 pomegranite and 1/4 strawberry.  A very very good blend.

Very easy recipe to follow and I hadn't made any kind of jelly/jam since I was in Home Economics class in high school so I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I did use frozen strawberries in place of the fresh and used fresh cranberries.  I gave jars away to family and girls in the office at Christmas.

WOW! what a phenomenal recipe! It was my first time canning anything, and it was very easy to follow. We used fresh strawberries from the farm, and frozen cranberries. Once chopped, we didn't have quite exact measurements of the strawberries, and it turned out that I only had 1 bag of sugar (2 kg, about 4.4 pounds) but it still turned out wonderfully. So it's definitely a hardy recipe - not touchy and likely to fail if you breathe incorrectly around it. Wanna know a secret? I actually don't like jam, but this particular jam I'll be eating and NOT giving away. :) The taste is perfect - not too sweet, OR too tart. I have to make another batch - my husband won't give the jars up for the function I was prepping them for!

WOW!!!!  I can honestly say that this was some of the best jam I have ever had!  This was also the first time I ever made jam- it was really that easy a recipe to follow- thanks so much for sharing!  The only addition I made was to add 1/4 of a container of Dole frozen juice concentrate (Pineapple Orange) and a bit more pectin to balance out this addition- the result was absolutely amazing!  I am so confident of my jam making skills (thanks to this easy and delicious recipe!) that I made a batch of blueberry jam as well-yummy!  I actually got 9 12oz bottles from thed original recipe and I plan to give them as christmas presents with cranberry pistachio biscotti (drizzled with white chocolate I might add!).  Thanks again.

Made this recipe exactly with strawberries I picked locally this summer and froze. It is delicious except for the fact I cant taste any cranberry flavor like I had hoped. I will make again except I will add less strawberries and more cranberries.

Instead of pectin, I used 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  That is the natural way. I used dried cranberries because there were no fresh ones around.  This recipe came out great!!!!!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time. Yesterday I used frozen pomegranate instead of cranberries and I think that is my favorite variation to date. The color is a deeper red and has just the right amount of tartness that it needs to balance the sweetness. I also use an immersion blender after I add the sugar so that there are no sugar clumps and reduces the "graininess" texture that the sugar can cause in any jam recipe

I made this jam today. I used about 10 cups of strawberries and 1 1/2 cups of cranberries (which i believe is what it calls for. I googled it to convert it to cups). I used only half the amount of sugar and still found it far too sweet. I will only use about 1-2 cups of sugar next time. It does taste nice, but it was sweeter than I would have liked. I will try it again tomorrow will far less sugar and update.

This is a delicious recipe! I did make a couple of changes, based mostly on reviews that I had already read:

1. I used 2 1/2 quarts of mashed berries
2. I added another couple of ounces of cranberries
3. I only used 3 pounds white sugar (I had very sweet berries)
4. I added the juice and chopped zest of one orange

These changes gave me 17 half-pint jars of jam, and it's delicious. I like the addition of the orange - it brightens it a little bit, I think. The amount of sugar I used was plenty sweet enough, though again - I had very sweet berries on hand. 

Overall, I think I would add more cranberries and a smidge less sugar next time to get a bit more of the cranberry flavor. Right now, it's primarily strawberry with a hint of the orange flavor and the tart of the cranberries. However, it's an excellent jam, and will definitely join my regular rotation of jamming recipes!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it made a very delicious jam!  I thawed out some frozen cranberries and strawberries, and then chopped them coarsely in a blender.  This recipe yielded about 12 half-pint jars.  I can't wait to share this jam as Christmas gifts!

First confession, I have made this now twice, double batched.  Changed things around greatly, so it's hard to say I made this specific recipe I guess.  BUT, it gave me ideas, which I love.  By doing my changes, and making the larger batches, I was covering the holiday gift giving as well.  My husband being the guinea pig, and true jam connoisseur in this household.  He loved love loved my jam!  But I think he says that about just almost every example I push towards him.  I do not do sugar myself so I do not eat this.  But, by several reviews of others, this is a HUGE hit.  Hence the great holiday season jam to make.  Tis cranberry time here in Washington, and we always have bananas.  I used one chopped braeburn apple and fresh squeezed one small lemon for the juice and tiny slices of lemon rind as well as cinnamon and pie spices, also a splash of bourbon vanilla at the end of cooking.   Note, I also used 2 packs of the pink box pectin, I did not have liquid pectin.  
I will write down my steps because it is a keeper indeed.   Most unique and satisfying to the discerning pallet.  (or so I'm told)

I made a half batch of this lovely jam at the very last moment on Christmas Eve. I had to use liquid pectin since I was out of powdered. I used 4 1/2 C strawberries, 7 1/2oz fresh cranberries, juice of 1 lemon, juice and zest of 1 orange, and about 2# 5oz sugar with 1 3oz packet of liquid Certo pectin. Once it cooled down it set perfectly and has a delightful bright candy red hue that is especially nice in quilted jars. It does taste a bit more like strawberry than cranberry, so next time I will increase the cranberries and most likely only use 2# of sugar so it is more tart. I know my family will love it as is and am really glad I tried it out. Thank you for sharing this gem! To help ensure even fruit suspension in your finished product, I recommend letting your jam set about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, before ladling into your jars so the fruit pieces won't float to the top at all.

I make this recipe every year for Christmas and give it out as a gift. I purchase the supplies from costco to save money: large thing of sugar, strawberries in the frozen section, and cranberries from the produce section (pectin is purchased from my local grocery, as well as the jars). It is completely affordable and everybody loves it! I always make an extra batch so that we can use it through the year as well. It's perfect.

I still get rave reviews on this!  I used some frozen and some fresh strawberries.  It didn't seem to affect the outcome either way.

Most recently, I made this with 3 lbs frozen strawberries, 12 oz fresh cranberries, 2 pkgs pf fruit pectin, 1 Tbsp butter and 4 lb sugar.  Looks beautiful and tastes great!!!

Fantastic!  Made with 8 cups of sugar; you still have a little tart from cranberries.  Also I added the juice from a lemon.  The jam really sparkles in the jars.

It was much easier than I thought it would be.  I gave it out for the holidays and I got raves from everyone.  Some people are even saving their jars in case I make it again!

I made this with several modifications since I had some persimmons I wanted to use up.  I halved the recipe, used 1/2 cup of persimmon pulp to replace part of the cranberries, and added tangerine and lemon juice.  Made 5 eight ounce jars.  It's delicous!  Next time I'll probably follow the recipe more closely since I won't have any more persimmons.  A great recipe base for jam in general.
