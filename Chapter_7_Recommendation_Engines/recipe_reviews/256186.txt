These were very original and quite the delicious treat. Would definitely make again for a gathering with drinks.

I think I would like these better rolled thinner so they would be crispier.

Very nice. I used chipotle powder in place of cayenne to increase the smoky note and it was good. I only used one fourth of a teaspoon and I think it could hold up to twice that amount, depending on your tolerance for heat. Also, they are a tad salty for my taste, so if I make them again I will cut back 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon on the salt and see how they turn out.  Very nice with a glass of wine.

I made this recipe for a wine tasting to pair with Chilean wines.  It was a very interesting appetizer that was well received by all.  I would definitely make Smoky, Cheesy Cookies again.

These are perfectly flaky and buttery with a nice smoky finish!
