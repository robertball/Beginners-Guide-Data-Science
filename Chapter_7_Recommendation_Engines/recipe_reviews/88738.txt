This recipe is the bomb!  I have to say that I changed it a bit though.  I absolutely despise Green Bell Peppers.  So I use all red peppers.  I love the fact that I don't have to cut up any hot peppers.  I can also easily adjust the heat of each batch.  I make 2 to 3 batches a year as this is an expected gift for most family and friends.  I also have a local caterer who buys several jars and uses them on crackers with cream cheese piped around the outside.  Very festive.  We also use a milder version as dip for chicken fingers and pork.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.  I was sick of wearing gloves and cutting hot peppers up!

A great pepper jelly.  One of my neighbors puts it on everything and can go through a jar in less than a week!  To drain the peppers well, we put them in a fine mesh strainer and then press with a folded cheesecloth.  Works great.

I made this recipe and it was awesome and so easy!! I love that I didn't have to cut up hot peppers. Tutfruti is right, thoroughly draining the peppers is key to the jelly setting up well. It pours out onto the cream cheese just right and I got so many compliments from family and friends that I have served it to.

This is the same recipe that comes with the Certo brand pectin, except that it calls for APPLE CIDER VINEGAR!  This is the key. 
Also, instead of food processor, draining, cheese cloth, etc., just hand chop the peppers. They won't be watery at all!
I have also added toasted, chopped pecans to my jelly jars as I pour in the hot jelly. It makes a great Christmas gift. (Add red or green food color when cooking jelly)

I reccomend using more lemon juice than the vinegar.  Also, aple cider vinegar is preferable to the white as it is more palatable.  I used lemon zest instead of chile flakes, and I added a half cup of sugar more to combat the pungency of the vinegar.  Too bad it was already too late.  The jelly is not bad, but not as great as I have had in the past.  Still on the lookout for the perfect bell pepper recipe!  I think the lemon juice will do it, though.

I've just made this for the second time and It is so yummy! Besides putting in ontop of creamcheese and serving with crackers, I dont know what else to do with it, but its a nice quick snack if you have guests, or a classy appitizer to bring to get togethers..I just need to find a way to make it diet friendly.

This is one of my favorite recipes now!!  I've already made it twice...in a week!  I did my own little twist though.  Instead of the red pepper flakes I used hot lemon peppers that my wife grew in the garden.  The bright yellow collor adds to the look of this jelly.  I only made a quarter of what the original called for, but next time I'm making one big batch...love it!!!

I used a collage of peppers (every kind imaginable)the recipe was very easy,however I decided to get creative and make it my own by following the same instructions using plums then I combined the two products and came up with a jelly that even my Grandmother (god rest her soul) would have had to bow to.

Great taste, but I made it EXACTLY like the instructions say, and it has yet to jell.  I read somewhere that pepper jellies can take up to a week, but I'm not sure if it is true with this recipe.  Hopefully, because it's been over 24hrs, and my 12 jars look thinner than a syrup.  Again, though, I love the taste!

this is just like my recipe, so many of my friends have me make them lots of jars of it, i also use hot pepper jelly for sandwiches and a base over roast, and if you get created with it try making hot pepper jelly with fruit in it

This is delicious, but mine still has yet to gel, and I followed the recipe exactly, even squeezing the peppers in cheesecloth to make sure they were extra dry. Right now it's like a thick syrup, so it will actually be perfect for pouring over a block of cream cheese. I also used cider vinegar, as others have suggested. This really does have great flavor, and could not be easier...will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love this recipe.  I use it as a base for my Ghost Pepper Jelly in which i add 1 ghost pepper which raises the heat a little and slightly changes the flavor to that of those red hot candies of my childhood.

Really liked this recipe! It's hard to adjust the heat with jalapenos because the heat of hot peppers varies from one crop of jalapenos to the next. Any gardener will tell you that.  Bu using hot pepper flakes I have more control over the flavor.  I also would like to add that ALL jelly recipes by certo are the same in that they all have to have the same ratio of sugar/fruit/pectin, in order to gel. comparing one pepper jelly recipe to the next isn't going to show differences where those basic ingredients are concerned.  It's the subtle differences in extras. Like pepper flakes, nuts, etc. that make a recipe like this unique.

I tweaked it a bit... ok quite a bit because that is just what I do. I used 2 jalapenos and a variety of red, green orange and yellow peppers. I kept the juice from the peppers and added 1 extra cup of sugar and 1 extra pkg of pectin. I did a mix of cider vinegar and white vinegar and it turned out amazing!!!!
