My entire family LOVES THESE just as written. The only thing I do differently is put all ingredients in my food processor and pulse until blended, scoop out and press flat in a glass dish which I then freeze. We can then cut them into bars! takes out a ton of the work from rolling into balls and mixing by hand!

Made as is but used 1/4 cup chia seeds and doubled recipe . Made 30 larger balls and I freeze them for the week. They are about 180 cal per larger ball and I use two as a morning snack if I plan a run. Husband loves them too and we both find them to be extremely filling and will hold you for quite a few hours between meals and perfect for a pre run fuel. Found dough to be a bit sticky and tough to form balls unless you chill it first for a bit or alternatively roll each ball in frys unsweetened cocoa. As forming. Adds a bit to calories but also to taste!

I made these exactly as directed, including the optional chia seeds, and I really like them! This was my first time making  "no bake" energy balls or bars, and it was so easy! I used my 1" cookie scoop to portion the dough, and I ended up with exactly 25 balls. I was wondering how to store these, but then I read the submitter's comments and noticed to store them in an airtight container in the fridge. Hoping the kids will like these for a quick breakfast . . . if not, more for me!

Made these delicious snacks 10 times so far, typically double the recipe and press into a parchment lined baking pan, press hard and they stick together, then score them into small squares, freeze and they break apart easily.  They are delicious!  I have added peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, unsweetened coconut as well as mini chips, depending on what I have on hand, and the added nuts add a lot of crunch and texture. You will need to adjust the honey, skimp on the honey and they will not hold together. Thank you for the recipe!

These were so good!! I used chunky peanut butter and replaced the chips with raisins and pressed mixture down into a wax paper lined pan. I may sprinkle a little cinnamon or grated orange  peel  into  the dough next time for more dimension.

Make these all the time now. I double it and half the honey with maple syrup, add chopped dates, coconut  and cinnamon. Everyone enjoys them and so easy to grab on the run.

I will definitely make this again.  Since my son is allergic to peanuts (peanut butter), I substituted soy nut butter (peanut free) instead of peanut  butter).  They are a great snack for kids on the go.

I have these in my house at all times since about two months ago when I found this recipe. I have not made them the same twice, sometimes adding ingredients like ground quinoa and sunflower seeds but never straying from the outline. My toddler loves them as a snack and they have become my actual breakfast most days! Love them.

I live overseas so I can't find mini chocolate chips, so I usually just put everything in a food processor. We also make our own homemade peanut butter and use half flax and half chia seeds.  I ask my kids if they want balls, bars, or some other shape.  Tons of different ways to do make this recipe, but what I like is how easy it is and the right combination of the ingredients make the perfect taste.

Those were very good! Had a little trouble with them falling apart too easily, but that may be due to me adding chopped nuts and dried cranberries. I will definitely make this again and maybe add more honey to help hold them together better.

These are genius! I added cinnamon, chopped almonds and toasted coconut. Next time I may add a little coffee.. The taste was amazing! I'll take these over chocolate chip cookies any day!

I made this today with a few variations. I used half raisins and half cranberries instead of the chocolate. I used pine nuts  and also sugar free honey. It tasted ok. It might have been better with quick oats instead of old fashioned. I used ground flax seed. It's an ok recipe but nothing superb   I might try it again but not in the near future

I didn't use the Chai seeds, but did the rest. I love these when it's it's a busy morning and I need to walk out the door with no time for breakfast.  My kids like them also...and even though they are called 'energy balls' it doesn't do anything to their hyper level...lol. I use my cookie scoop to make the balls...super easy and mess free.

Great recipe. I doubled it and instead of honey used black strap molasses and Agave syrup, I then added  dried cranberries and whole flax seeds as well as ground flax seeds.
Delicious and nutritious!

Pretty good! I used creamy peanut butter and added pistachios because that’s what I had on hand. Would definitely like to try adding crunchy peanut butter for more crunch.

I sometimes add coconut, or roll them in coconut.
This is a favourite to make with my 4 year old granddaughter.
I substitute sunbutter for the peanut butter so that it is school friendly.

I made this recipe as is and with the chia seeds. I love the flavor and perfect amount of sweetness for me. My husband is not a fan of oats so he didnt particularly like the texture, but I love these! I may try it with coffee beans too just to add a bit more energy!

I added vanilla protein powder, didn’t make much difference in taste, they were still delicious. 
I doubled the batch but only got 34 bites out of it, and they weren’t too big either.

We love these! I follow directions exactly. I do need to start doubling the recipe because people keep asking for them. I prefer to roll them in ground flax seed after forming them into balls. I store them in the freezer for two reasons: 1. They are firmer and easier to transport in my lunch bag. 2. My hubby tends to forget about them in the freezer which leaves more for me. (Yes I’m a bit stingy with them)

Delicious, but I did make some changes. Thought I bought old fashioned oats but picked up quick cooking, oops. I used those.  I ground my flax seeds in my Bullet (about 2 seconds).  Also, I added 2 tabl. chopped slivered almonds. Next time I’ll use the old fashioned oats and see if I can find smaller chips. The ones I had were 60% cocao but were larger than regular chips. It’s hard to keep from just one at a time??

The only change I made was swapping the optional chia seeds for 2 TBS of chopped walnuts, this recipe was easy and the result satisfying! I brought them to work for my coffee break with extra to share...everyone loved them.
I will definitely be using this recipe again and will experiment with additions, flaked coconut? cocoa powder? nuts...yum!

I work nights and wanted to try something that would help fuel my work.  These bites are a satisfying combination of flavours, easily portable and have a few textures that play nicely off one another!
Mission accomplished!

I haven't made these yet but offering a suggestion after reading the reviews about them being sticky. Before rolling in balls spray your hands with Pam.  Works wonders!

Great snack for kids and adults! I warmed the peanut butter in the microwave before stirring everything together. It blended very easily and evenly! I doubled the chia seeds. I substituted half the honey with some cane sugar syrup so it wasn’t too honey flavored. We are already making our second batch!! Store in freezer for longer life.

I made this but didn’t love it. It tastes like squirrel food. It was mostly filling but difficult to chew. I would add more flavours next time

I made this and doubled the recipe but reduced the honey to 1/2 cup and added 2TBS Glutamine powder, 2TBS coconut oil and 2 scoops Arbonne chocolate protein powder. They are AMAZING!!! All the ingredients I used are organic. A healthy treat never tasted so good!!'

Didn't have flax seed so I substituted some items.  Didn't add chocolate chips or vanilla.  Added beetroot powder,  fiber powder, dried cherries and a mix nut comb.  So dang good.  Thanks for this base recipe to which now I can add different ingredients and make it taylor made for my family.  These bites are for snacks and after work outs.  It was fast, simple, and a winner for us.

Amazing! I put in half the honey, added some shredded coconut, and put in some shopped peanuts and pistachios. I think the extra nuts were needed. Will be making this again.

Loved it with a few changes. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe but with a little less honey (1/4 c.) because of the reviews that said they were too sweet. It was still "knock my socks off sweet" for me. The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe but only doubled the oats, peanut butter, and chocolate chips. It was perfect!

These are fantastic, healthy, and delicious snack. I've made them several times now and have found that a few extra ingredients really puts these balls over the top.
I add cinnamon, cocoa powder, double the chia seeds, and semisweet chocolate chips. Along with that, I've been switching out peanut butter for the extravagant Nutzo (cashew, peanut, brazil nut, etc) butter and agave nectar for honey.
Forming the dough into a baking sheet definitely expedites the process and makes for uniform servings. However, the ball form is extremely fun to eat!
I also recommend after mixing the dough, put it through the food processor for a few pulses. With various whole ingredients reduced to smaller pieces, they will be easier to eat.
I make double this recipe once a week. It's a winner. I can't stop. Thank you.

Super simple and easy to make. I replaced peanut butter with almond butter. Looking forward to having something chewy to mosh on between breakfast and lunch! 

Bit of advice: Leaving it in the fridge for a while helps with forming them SO MUCH. If you're struggling to form the balls or if the mixture just falls apart in your hands, slap it in the fridge for another 20 minutes or so.

If I would make it again, I would probably add less of the honey and chocolate chips, Just because it was a little too sweet for me, but everything else was great about the recipe

These are sooooo yummy!!! Super easy. I was out of flax seed so I combined unsweetened flaked coconut, hemp seeds, and almond flour to replace the 1/2c flax. I also added a dash of salt. I could sit and eat the mix with a spoon it's so good!!!

These tasted great, but it was way too much sugar for me. I was thinking that these were healthy but with the honey and chocolate it was more like a cookie for me. I don't think I'll be making these again. Instead, I'll look for a healthier options.

My husband and I loved them! The only thing that i found was the balls were  still sticky even after being in the refrigerator for an hour. I remedied this by tossing half in powered cocoa and the other half in shredded coconut.  I will definitely make this again!

Tastes really good. The chocolate chips are a great addition, essentially adding crunch since I'm keeping these refrigerated. First time buying flaxseed. Ended up in the pharmacy dietary supplements section to find it in ground form.

This was all right. I made the mixture as stated and decided to add some sliced almonds (half cup) and also tried part of the batch with some dried coconut, which was pretty good too.

I found that I needed to add more peanut butter to make it into a workable "dough" I also had to add some salt, which made the mixture WAY better. I feel like a teaspoon of salt for the whole mixture should be in the recipe.

Have super active kids. Swimmers and dancers. These are great to make in large batches and put in fridge. Kids go though them like crazy. Sometimes I sub in Mikes hot honey for half the honey called for. Kids love that too. You can’t go wrong with this as something laying around for a quick grab.

Loved. Super easy. Next time I will omit the chocolate chips to make a more "breakfast-like" appeal for me.

I’ve made this recipe probably over 10 times now. Thank you so much for sharing. 
I just made a little tweak, which was easier for me. After mixing ingredients I placed it between two sheets of wax paper that fit a sheet pan. Then rolled the mix flat. Next chill. Cut in to squares and store with wax paper in between. Worked well because it’s delicious but sticky! :)

My 4 year old son loves these!! Thank you!! I used a food processor to ground up the oats and choc chips; cut the choc chips in half and used Kirkland organic peanut butter.

Delicious! We doubled the recipe, and used half honey, half pure maple syrup. My kids love them for a quick on the go breakfast. Great fiber source as well.

I definitely recommend this recipe! Easy to make if you don't have time to bake as well as good for altering to your tastes. I stuck with peanut butter, but may use another nut butter in the future. Also may add almonds, pecans, or walnuts for more texture.

I did make these, and took them in to work.  Everybody seemed to love them.  I wasn't happy with, of all things, my choice of honey.  I used orange blossom honey, and it has a smoky hint in it, and that threw me off, but other than that, everybody else liked them.  So yes, giving them a 5 star rating.
Also, I would like to freeze them maybe to harden them a little, but don't know how that would turn out ,so I just followed the recipe as is.

Followed the directions exactly. The only thing I did different is use a mixed bag of white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate pieces. Can’t get enough of them, they’re delicious! I will be making them again very soon.

I like these but felt that they would be better without the chocolate chips. Kind of defeats the ‘healthy’ component. I’m going through make them again and use dates or raisins instead and probably more oats. They were a little sticky.

I have added or substituted several different ways: sunflower seeds, white chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, peanuts, and dried berries.   I also add some granola in the morning and a banana and this will hold me over until lunch.  Love it!!

BOMB, made these and throw in 2 with a sliced up apple for a quick snack. Followed recipe and scooped out with cookie scoop-- they are STICKY but if you oil your hands it doesn't get super messy. Going to try with almond butter but these are wonderful as is! Thanks!

Absolutely amazing!! This is one of my favourite recipes for a snack on the run!! I used a PC Blue Menu seed blend (flax, sunflower, pumpkin, hemp, chia) instead of just flax, and it tasted just as amazing.  Delicious!

I used pure coconut milk as I couldn’t get pure extract of coconut. Also used cocoa beans instead of coffee beans and cocoa nibs instead of chocolate chips. They are delicious.

Made as directed, and they turned out delicious. A local cafe sells these with a tiny bit of melted chocolate on top. I will try that next time when I have more time!

Love these! Easy to make and a great healthy snack alternative - or eat a couple for a small meal.  I used almond butter instead of peanut butter and used chopped dates instead of chocolate chips.  They were a bit sticky (I think because of the dates) but thought about rolling them in something ground up like coconut chips.  Can’t wait to keep experimenting!

I made these for a quick snack or breakfast on the go for my kids. Super quick and easy recipe. The only change I made was I added hemp seeds in place of the suggested chia seeds. Everyone loved them including my husband. My niece requested I make her some as well! I guess that's what I'll be doing tonight.

A  quick, easy and healthy snack. I have made it several times with and without some of the variation suggested, i.e. chopped almonds, or coconut, not a bad batch yet.

Made these today (without the chia seeds).  Did everything else to a tee and came out with 22 energy balls.  Love these!  Healthy and easy -- what could be better.

I thought it was easy to make and tasted delicious. I wouldn't change a thing as far as the ingredients go. I would recommend refrigerating the mix for longer than 30 minutes before making the balls if you double the recipe. Otherwise, the mix gets too sticky to easily form the ball.

I did not put any vanilla in it but it is still very good.
