This recipe is excellent. I used very ripe Fuyu persimmons. I didn't have buttermilk, so I looked up the substitution, and it is yogurt in the same amount. This doesn't give the pan size, and it should be a large pie dish

i made it exactly as directed. Was very good.  Very much a bread pudding consistency in that it looks like cake from the top but is very moist in the middle.  Whole family enjoyed it and the kids had never tasted persimmons before.  As Carol C suggested this was made in a deep dish pie plate

The recipe also yields 2 pies  ( 9" inch regular).  I baked it for 50 minutes.  I plan to eat one now and freeze the other.

Made it as is except I accidentally added 1/2 TBS of Cinnamon and it was still very yummy.  Everyone loved it!

My son gathers and purées the persimmons in the fall when they start to drop.  Puts up many quarts in the freezer.  He uses this recipe, and man, it doesn’t last long....   Who knew an “overly mature” fruit from trees in our woods would make such a tasty dish!  I recommend using this recipe for your wild persimmons.

This dessert is SO Good!! I followed recipe except I used 1-1/2 cups of flour because it’s the consistency we are used to here in Indiana. I had lost my original recipe and this one is close. I did add a ‘dash’ of nutmeg also. Thanks for posting!

I reduced the sugar a bit. It was fantastic!
