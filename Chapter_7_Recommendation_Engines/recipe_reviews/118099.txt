This recipe was great!  As I am a vegetarian, I substituted 2 8 oz. boxes of Morningstar sausage patties crumbled up for the 2 lbs. of pork sausage and it still came out wonderful. I made this for a church brunch and everyone said it was wonderful!  The flavor is a bit reminiscent of sausage stuffing.  Very yummy and makes a lot!  It is very dense, but really great! Makes a hearty breakfast/brunch main course.

Love all the veggies but cut back sausage to 1# and still received compliments and requests for the recipe. Next time will try baking uncovered for less time, was slightly overcooked with 40 min.

This was a very good recipe! I made it for a Mother's Day brunch and the whole family enjoyed it. No complaints at all! Very easy to make for beginners or those who don't like to cook.

Delicious! But I intentionally cut the sausage in half, and inadvertently forgot the spinach. Got rave reviews, though

Made this recipe for a girlfriend who just had a baby and the new mom and family really enjoy this meal. Used turkey sausage and it gave it a healthy flavorful twist... Received lots of compliments on the dish.

I have made this several times now and always get raving reviews. It is easy to change it up with whatever veggies you have in the fridge. Wonderful.

Wonderful Breakfast/Brunch!!!  I used 1lb of Italian sausage (which was plenty enough) half & half instead of milk and texas toast for the bread (cubing with crusts still on...)  I divided this into two smaller aluminum pans 9x9x2 (so I could give one away and there was still plenty for my family of 5) and the cooking directions were still perfect!!! Will certainly be making this AGAIN!!!!

Excellent recipe! I halved the recipe and added a little jalapeno and red pepper.  Be careful with the Coleman's mustard (or other brand dry mustard). We like hot food and this was a pleasant 'hot' but might overwhelm others.

Very, very good. I like to add some chopped asparagus and mushrooms in addition to the other veggies. I also have noticed that it turns out better if I cut down on the amount of milk somewhat (by about a half cup).
