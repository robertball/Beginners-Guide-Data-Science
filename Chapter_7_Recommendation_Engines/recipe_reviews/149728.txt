YUM!  I don't usually have caramel topping, so I just leave it out and these are still great.  Might try adding a little sweetened condensed milk in place of caramel, haven't decided if it needs it or not.  I also dice the apples and cook them a little in a saute pan prior to adding to cream cheese filling.

I think the recipe calls for too much cinnamon inside the cream cheese filling. Plus, I might cook the apples a little bit in a pan before adding, so they'd be softer.  My husband loved these, however, we both agreed they taste better cooled off! :)  We will re-use this recipe, with a few switch-ups! Thanks!

Please tell me how something so sinfully delicious be so incredably easy to make. My oldest sons buddies were over, and one of them doesn't like cream cheese at all, another buddy told him he had to try it. Of course, he loved it so much he said he wanted the recipe for his mom. LOVE THIS RECIPE...just wonderful!

Made this last night. We all thought it was fabulous! I cooked the apples just a little as a review suggested. That was a good idea. I had some homemade buttermilk syrup on hand so I substituted that for the ice cream topping. Yum!!!!

These turned out so good.  We also used different toppings to roll them in.  Nuts, chocolate etc.  Yummy!!!  Thanks for the post.
