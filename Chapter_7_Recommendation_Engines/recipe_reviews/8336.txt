I was really scared b/c the batter was REALLY liquidy...so I added a little more flour, but I shouldn't have, the cake was excellent!  It really tastes unique and is very moist. Just to reiterate: the best chocolate cake I've ever had, my favorite recipe on this site.  Definitely try making this.  Also, whoever said this cake was dense and rich did something very wrong, it's really pretty airy, but it still satisfies chocolate fixes :)

first time making from scratch. added 1 extra Tablespoon cocoa powder to recipe & used Mocha expresso. Whiskey did give it a hint of flavor but didn't taste like alcohol. Fantastic! Served with whipped cream and raspberries over the top of the frosting. Will definately make again!!!

I made this cake last Valentine's Day with hopes of pleasing my chocolaholic boyfriend and also pleasing my best friend's mom (her birthday is on the same day).  But instead of doubling the recipe I multiplied it times 5 and had pans all over my kitchen.  But the end result was worth it many times over.  EVERYONE I GAVE A PAN TO SCRAPED EVERY CRUMB!!!  I even got a call from someone's ex-boyfriend (I gave them one of the cakes) this Valentine's Day to ask if I can make the cake for him again this year!!!

Not at all what I expected. Moist? Yes, but so moist the cake is completely unstable. You can't take the cake out of the pan without it turning to mud. Though the taste is alright this cake was too much effort for a very unprofessional result. Don't use this cake for formal events such as baby showers. Stick to super bowls and birthdays. Again, the taste was good though the sounds it made while being cut were a little nauseating. My brothers who love the cake have affectionately called it 'cram' after their favorite game Fallout 3.

I made this cake for my dad's 50th Birthday.  This was the first "from scratch" cake I ever made. I had to omit the alcohol because of my 5 year old sister but it was still pretty good. It wasn't quite as chocolatey as I would like but then again I've never thought something was too rich.  The icing can be decieving because I thought it was terrible by itself. But with the cake it improves.  I thought this recipe was ok. Very easy to make but not sweet enough for my taste.

The reviews were right on!  The longer the frosting soaks in, the better.  I refrigerated it overnight and the cake tasted fabulous!  Everyone in my office raved about it.  It was well worth all of my time and effort.

My Daughter and I made this cake for my birthday exactly as the recipe calls for. However we did not have self-rising flour so we used one teaspoon baking powder and one half teaspoon salt for each cup of flour and we also doubled the recipe. As rich as this cake is it still was not very sweet. The cake was more like a brownie texture but it was very dense and very moist. The flavor was just not that great. I think if I was to make this cake again I would omit the water and add more sugar and it would be sweeter and more like cake than brownie and I think it would still be moist as well.

After all the great reviews this recipe received, I was very excited to make it for a friend's birthday.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed by the results.  It was not sweet enoough or chocolatey enough for our tastes. It really tasted kind of bland to me, and the presentation needs a lot of work as well, because it doesn't look very appetizing straight out of the pan.  I did let it set overnight as others had suggested.  And this cake was a LOT of work for such a result.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend this recipe.

omigod omigod omigod this cake is AMAZING. my valentine and i (on valentine's day) baked this cake (we are not avid bakers) and could not believe it actually came from our hands! it is soooo delicious... we added a little more sugar and flour before putting it in the baking pan because the batter was a little runny. you must make this cake (and next time we'll double the recipe. it was really that good!)

The first one I maid I used Knob Creek, witch is a burben and I dont know if that maid it not to my liking (i do drink it) or if it's the batter, but the icing I LOVED! I'm gona remake it again and leave out the wiskey, if it's to my liking i'll experament more. I gave it 5 stars due to the cake was VERRY! moist witch i LOVE moist cakes and the fact that if i liked the tastes better it would have been perfect. Also fallow the recipe EXACTLY, i was hesitant about the batter being so thin. But since i red the one review i fallowed it exactly and to my serprise it was looking like a hard cake at 10min left, after 25min it was set up quicker than ANY other cake i've main, expecally for it being so thin at start. Love the idea of this cake!

I'm going to take my chances, Dawn M., and make this cake due to everyone else's comments.  I must say, however, that I've never heard of a "Sex Cake" - chocolate or otherwise!!  Possibly it's supposed to be "...Better than Sex Chocolate Cake"?!  That I cannot imagine...but I'll give it a try!!

A disappointment.  After reading many of the reviews, I was excited to try this recipe.  I made it according to the recipe, and a day in advance so it would have time to sit.  I was a bit concerned about the strong whiskey aroma when I pulled it from the oven, but by the next day the aroma was gone.  That was deceptive though.  Although the aroma was gone, the cake still had a very strong whiskey flavor.  Of the four people who tried the cake, only one liked it.      The cake was moist ... loved that about it.  Our saving grace was a batch of sugared raspberries I had in the refrigerator - a big spoonful over the top masked the whiskey flavor and made the cake taste pretty good.

Don't know what happened. I followed the recipie exact and I cooked it 10 min. longer then suggested and it came out more like a undercooked brownie texture. I don't think it lived up to it's name. Taste was okay not great.

Made this as a Special treat for my Upline (home party biz) since she was promoted. Made a trial one first and it was VERY moist but not chocolatly enough...added 1 TB more chocolate to the batter and I also let bake an extra 10 minutes (25 was not quite enough IMO)...the cake is REALLY made when you add the icing, that is the kicker to it all! YUM!

Easy and moist , I followed the recipe to the T (with the exception of NO ALCOHOL) and I have to say its just amazing!!! Didn't use the frosting though as we don't like things that are too sweet. Just powdered sugar on top and believe me this is the dessert for all chocolate lovers!!!

I made this cake for my mother's Birthday and I did not like it at all. I followed the recipe and do lots of baking. But the cake just didn't turn out well. I wasn't crazy about the flavor or the texture and the frosting was not good. I would leave out the whiskey if I made it again, but I probably won't. The chocolate taste was similar to a dark bitter chocolate which I usually like in small amounts. Just not for a cake. I didn't serve it, instead made the "Chocolate Oil Cake" and it was perfect. More of a good milk chocolate flavor.

I just got done pouring the frosting on it and had to taste it warm. WOW!! It is awesome! I can't imagine how good it will taste if it gets better the longer it sits. Not sure it will last that long to ever find out!! Yummy

Delicious, deep and rich with a delightful hint of bourbon to satisfy a more sophisticated chocoholic palate. Reserve this one for an after 6 event.

I added 80g of melted dark sweet chocolate to the frosting, it tasted better. My cake base tasted good,but I must have done something wrong because it wasn't fluffy enough to be a cake, haha!!! I have a cake recipe that is better, but I'm gonna try this again... I might get it right next time :D

Okay.  This is really really good.  When it was fresh and warm, it wasn't quite as good, but when it sat in the refrig overnight, it totally tasted amazing.    
It is really rich and dense.  
I did not have any burbon, so instead I used Starbucks Cream Liqour instead. 
 Good stuff!

The only substitution I made was using all butter instead of part shortening in the batter.  Everyone enjoyed the cake and wants me to make it again.  The bourbon flavor definitely came though.

WOW this is one strong whiskey tasting cake, if you eat it the first day it is made.  I made this as written, and knew the batter was going to be runny from the previous reviewers.  But rest assured, it bakes up just fine as written.  My family felt this cake was much better the longer it sat.  Eating it on the day it was baked was not enjoyable as the whiskey flavor dominated every bite.  The second day, it was soooo much better and the flavors blended nicely.  It is a very moist cake and remains so even after day 3.  We actually thought the cake was best on the third day.  I frosted half the cake without nuts and used chopped walnuts on the other half.

This cake was OMG good!! But the 2nd time making it I used vanilla spice eggnog in place of buttermilk for the cake and frosting. Then the whiskey I used was blackberry whiskey. Let's just say it went from good to OMG what a night. Try it!!! Remember the key is to let it sit a long time, more like all night!!

Definitely the most moist cake I've ever had!  I didn't have buttermilk in, so I had to "create" my own (with about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice per 1/2 cup whole milk).  It wasn't as rich as I expected, but certainly satisifies those chocolate cravings!

First time at baking and I'll say it wasn't bad. I'd used more espresso than was needed which gave it a taste many of my friend enjoyed. It was not as moist as I'd have liked, but I'm sure to make it again regardless. Even my mother who harassed me about not knowing what I was doing was impressed by this one.

This was a huge hit at our picnic.  I personally thought the whiskey gave it too much of a "taste" but everyone else absolutely loved it.  I didn't read the reviews first and was skeptical about how liquid the batter was, but it baked up just fine.
