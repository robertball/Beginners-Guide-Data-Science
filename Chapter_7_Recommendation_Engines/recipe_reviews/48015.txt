This is a very good wrap.  I made it for a picnic so I left out the tomatoes and did not add the guacamole as I didn't want them to get soggy.  It was still good and next time I will add the other two ingredients.

This was very good.  I used leftover grilled chicken from the night before.  Next time I'll use larger wraps.  Mine turned out more like cobb tacos.

This was excellent. Such a nice summer meal, and my 8 year old loved it. YUM! Can't wait to make it again.

Absolutely fantastic.  Sorry,Tyson Foods, but I had only fresh chicken in the fridge, so I cooked that, unbreaded; substituted ranch dressing for blue cheese dressing, added hard boiled egg and eliminated the guacamole.  Basically following another cobb salad recipe.  A wonderful wrap lunch
