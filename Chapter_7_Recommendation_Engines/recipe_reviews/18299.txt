This is the way I make my taco salad, except I prefer to add the taco seasoning to the meat(as if for tacos), and I don't add the beans. You definitely need to let the meat cool a bit before putting it with the lettuce and cheese. I use taco or nacho flavored Doritos for the tortilla chips.  We love this and I make it often.

Liked the recipe a lot and the dressing was delicious.  I would suggest putting the nacho chips individually on the servings and not mixed with the salad at the end.  They were soggy then in the other-wise good leftovers.

I also add tomatoes and black olives. We add the cheese and the tacos individually so we do not ruin the leftovers. Our dressing is half Italian and half Catalina and can be added at the last minute so it does not become too soggy. My family has loved this dish for years!

I made this for our superbowl party and it was great. I used ranch dressing and doritos instead and it worked wonderfully.

This was good. I didn't need 8 servings, so I kinda halved it (no precise measurements). I could not for the life of me find ranch-style beans (perhaps one of the many products we don't get in Canada) and couldn't really find anything close either. I ended up using BBQ beans and rinsing most of the BBQ sauce off of them. That ended up being alright, but there was a bit of a BBQ-y taste with the dressing (not necessarily a bad thing - we still ate it). I think next time (and there will have to be a next time because my dad loved this.. even took leftovers for lunch the next day which he NEVER does, not even when it's something he cooks) I would just use plain beans and try to jazz up the dressing in a different way. A lot of reviewers mentioned using ranch dressing - I liked the Thousand Island, but I wonder how it'd be with a little of each?

I added canned corn and and diced tomatoes and skipped the beans only because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used Ranch dressing and Fritos.  We took it to a picnic on a hot day.  The only thing I would make sure of is that this salad stays pretty cold.  Otherwise the lettuce will wilt.  This was pretty good but messy.  I bet it would taste good with Catalina or French dressing too.  Mix the dressing in at the very last minute so the chips and lettuce are nice and crisp.

I did make a few changes. Instead of 
Thousand Island dressing, I used 16 oz of sour cream. I mixed the taco seasoning and a little salsa with it. I already had these ingredients on hand. The family loved it!

I don't know what to say other than this was very odd.  The meat mixture was terrible and the lettuce wilted.  Sorry.

I made this years ago only in smaller proportions. It is so good. I'm not sure what ranch beans are, but I use a can of pinto beans. I didn't use hamburger or taco mix, but add tomatoes and ripe olives and use catalina dressing. Crushed up my favorite Dorito's to mix in, yum. You can be very creative with this, just add what you like. Everyone likes it! Thanks Veronika!

i had to doctor this up a lil after doing this it was awesome:

i wouldn't do the thousand island unless you like it sweet and just plain yuck... i used another viewers comment and did ranch dressing mixed with taco seasoning for the dressing. also when browning your meat use a lil bit of salsa but the mild kind to it with a lil bit of cumin, chilli seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder to taste then add a can of drained and rinsed kidney beans. add meat mixture onto of crushed tortilla chips, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes, then add mixture of ranch dressing with taco seasoning mixed in the dressing to it and yummier :) and boyfriend went for 2nd's after this lil bit of tweaking.

YUMMM. I was looking for one like my mom used to make for our family when we were kids. I also add the tomatoes and the olives. LOVE this. The 1000 island really makes this recipe. Its kinda the equivalent of the "secret sauce" on a big mac! Thanks for this recipe!

A great way to use up leftover Carne Adovada from the night before and a half empty bag of tortilla chips. We didn't use thousand island, I just made a quick "dressing" out of homemade salsa and reduced fat sour cream.

Good, although I only used about half the dressing, and thought it was too much.  I used 3/4 the cheese, and half the chips, as well, and thought they were fine.  However, I didn't use meat.  Next time, I'll probably try it with the Catalina dressing, or find out what my mom uses.
