I have become addicted to hibiscus tea this Summer after finding it in bulk at the local Hispanic market.  I used brewed from dried flowers tea and Best Lemonade Ever. If you happen to spill some vodka in this you'll be glad you did.

Nice nonalcoholic drink, but I was unable to replicate the presentation shown in the recipe photo. Perhaps that is because I used a low cal lemonade drink mix instead of "real" lemonade. Seems a shame to waste all those calories on a beverage.

If you don't have much time I suggest using the instant powder at your local mexican market my favorite brand is klass just add sugar and water plus lemonade and you're done!

Very good recipe! couldn't get the lemonade and tea to separate but it was very good. I used crystal lite packets and it tasted very good
