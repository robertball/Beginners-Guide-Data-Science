My mother in law makes something similar to these, so I adjusted and sort of "combined" the recipes.  I used a can of SPAM, cut into very small cubes.  I did not use the butter, instead using about 1/2-1 cup of mayo.  I also added shredded cheddar cheese.  I topped english muffins with the mixture and baked in 400 degree oven till gooey and hot.  Delish and easy main dish!

Left off the mushrooms as I don't like them.  It didn't say what size French loaf, but one of those very long skinny ones from the deli worked out well.  I liked this pretty well, but not quite as well as I expected.  I think it would be better with the ham increased as I like that flavor a lot.

I was very skeptical about trying this recipe but was surprised to the taste. I only made 1 sandwich using regular sandwich bread, deviled ham, cream cheese, and dill weed. It was surprisingly good and sated my deviled ham craving.

I didn't expect this to be so good! If you're not a fan of deviled ham I wouldn't recommend it - but I liked it alot. Be careful with that salt, though! A teaspoon was WAY too much.
