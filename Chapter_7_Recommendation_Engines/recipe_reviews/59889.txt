This is definitely a 5-star hit, if you add in gorgonzola cheese with the ricotta...otherwise, it's a bit bland, as another person noted.  even feta would be a nice addition...however, i prefer gorgonzola for it's hearty flavor.  I served this at a dinner party...everyone wanted the recipe!

I used this recipe this weekend for a party. It was one of many and was the only one that I was a little hesitant about because the prosciutto is a little salty. I love salty but most don't. It turned out that everyone loved it. 12 guests asked for the recipe. I changed the recipe slightly - here's what I did - I stuffed the cups with a piece of blue cheese, then covered it with the ricotta mixed with parmesan, nutmeg, pepper & salt then baked them. I then topped them with fig sauce. The fig sauce (for the Canadians it's PC Memories of Tuscany sauce)really made it. Gave it a little sweet/tangy taste to offset some of the salt from the prosciutto. Frankie, just want say thanks for the recipe. I don't think I'd have ever thought to use prosciutto as a cup!

Made two ways. Half as written and half using pepperoni slices.  The pepperoni version was completely gone while a few of the prosciutto were left. Just a bit to salty. If I were to make again I think I would try a bit of seasoning.

This was great to me because I took some other reviewer's advice and added different cheeses to the filling.  I bought expensive Boar's Head Prosciutto sliced sandwich style and made 24 mini-muffin cups full and had PLENTY of prosciutto left.  So I may only get about a half pound next time.  The cups were a little difficult to make, but if the meat starts falling apart, just shove it in there.  It seems to hold its shape well after baking.  I mixed 1/2 cup of ricotta w/ 1/2 cup of feta a bit of parmesan.  I used all 10oz of a frozen spinach package so mine was REALLY spinachy.  I would recommend mixing the garlic in with the ricotta to get an even mix.  The garlic kind of stuck in one corner after mixing and left some bites a bit TOO garlicky (if that is possible :))  the end product was good.  It was a nice low carb addition to the gathering.  It went really well with red wine.  It also was very good cooled down or hot.  It reheated well the next morning in the microwave for breakfast too.

I made this recipe according to the ingredients listed but I also added some parmesan cheese, fresh ground pepper and a pinch of salt.  All of my guests and husband just loved them!!  This recipe has become one of my favorite appetizers.

Using proscioutto as "cups" was fast, easy and flavorful but the filling was pretty bland. I'd try it again, mabye with chive-flavored cream cheese or by added parmesan cheese to the ricotta.

This was made for a good-bye party and was a huge hit.  For anyone who thinks the recipe was a bit bland, make sure you have good prosciutto.  Defiantly a keeper and will make again

I made these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and the whole family loved them.  I took the advice of other reviewers' and added black pepper, parmesan cheese, and nutmeg to the ricotta/spinach filling.  We loved how the proscuitto cups held the filling.  You could be really creative in what you used to fill these cups: for example, mushrooms sauteed with balsamic vinegar and mozzarella cheese, etc. A beautiful appetizer!

I thought this was very bland.  The filling needs more seasoning.  I'll try it once more and add fresh cracked pepper, lemon zest and some chopped fresh herbs.

Fantastic! Very easy to make. I read thru all the other comments and incorporated all the suggestions from everyone else & it was a masterpiece. In addition to the original recipe, I added feta, parmesan, chive & onion flavored cream cheese, salt, cracked pepper & nutmeg. I had trouble finding fig sauce on short notice, but substituted drizzling honey on the tops & it was a hit! The baked prosciutto salty & sweet honey was absolutely divine. My mind races with all the different combinations I can try. Can't wait for another opportunity to make it again!

Loved the concept of the prosciutto cups....I often use wonton wrappers as cups, but one of our dinner guests was allergic to gluten, so this was an ideal solution!  I used an alternative filling of low-fat mayo, chopped artichoke hearts, a tad of minced garlic + some feta.  Rather than parmesan (which would only make it saltier), I stirred in some shredded mozzarrela. These were a hit!  Next time, I'll add some diced sun-dried tomatoes & italian seasoning.  Be sure cool sufficiently prior to serving.  Thanks for this versatile & creative recipe!

I want to rate this as 4 and a half stars. losing a half star for the filling.  I have too many family members who will not eat Gorgonzola so I added Parmigiana Reggiano, nutmeg and cracked pepper to kick it up.  Still a little bland, but a good offset to the Prosciutto.  I used low fat ricotta, but then it seemed to dry so I added one egg yolk. Will make again and maybe try a cheese/mushroom stuffing.

Instead of mincing the garlic, try grating it. It mixes into the cheese much better. Also, I like the idea of adding Parmesan cheese salt and pepper. I would also mix in a good Gorgonzola cheese as well. It would give it that nice little tang it needs. An easy go to appetizer.

Very easy.  I made these in 5 minutes and just let bake.  We tried them for breakfast and I made them in regular muffin pans--I had prosciutto to use up, but it's very long and wide and 2x the size of normal prosciutto (that's Costco for you) so I would've have to slice it and didn't want to deal with it.  So I made about 6 of these cups and put in cheese and egg in the remaining prosciutto cups, then baked at 350 for a half hour.  Really good!  This was a nice breakfast, and the eggs worked perfectly too.  Now I have breakfast for the rest of the week, always a bonus!  I did add some bacon and some seasoned salt to the prosciutto cups--tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

I could not get my head around the way the prosciutto was to lay in cup.  I ended up using ham also because the prosciutto was to salty and still no taste to recipe cheese mixture. Sauted spinach and garlic to help flavor appetizer  Added flavored goat cheese, etc.  Changed recipe 3 times but the end product was not to my liking.  Guests were not impressed either.

Very good. For those of you who think it is too 'bland', try adding blue cheese instead of ricotta. Makes a world of difference!

Using ideas from other reviews, I added some cracked black pepper and a bit of parm to enhance the flavor. I even plan to use the leftover cheese/spinach mix in lasagna roll-ups this weekend. Yum!

I made these for Easter Dinner with my family.  As the least experienced and least adventurous cook, I earned an elevated cook status from my mother and sisters.  They loved the Prosciutto Cups and how elegant they looked.  I found them quite simple to make and was surprised how easily they can out of the muffin pan.  I might experiment by adding something to the top it with...something with a punch.

I really had high expectations for this and it turned out okay. I love prosciutto but this was salty. I think I should have used another type of prosciutto-I would ask salt content.  And make sure that it is cut really thin or else this  recipe is overpowered by the salty prosciutto. I used recommendations and doctored up the filling with lemon zest, gorganzola cheese, and a little nutmeg-it tasted good and could probably be used as a filling in shells or for manicotti.

These are easy and festive.  I was very excited to bring them to a holiday dinner party, but the prosciutto I used was very, very salty.  Maybe there's a low sodium kind that would work better.

Guests loved these! Thankfully I read some of the reviews and added other cheese to the ricotta mixture, along with some salt and pepper, and flash cooked fresh spinach in bacon fat. Otherwise, it would have been very bland.. But great size and easy to make!

Used half feta and half ricotta and a bit of parm. as cheese mix and a bit of salt and pepper. Add the garlic to the ricotta to blend easier. Used less spinach than called for and only need about 1/2 lb prosciutto for 24 cups. They were amazing!!

I like others found the filling bland and the proscuitto too salty after it was cooked. I was convinced it would balance each other out, but the taste just wasn't there for me.  I added fresh grated parm and lemon zest to the ricotta.  Overall disappointed.

I made this recipe without any changes for a holiday party and everyone gave rave reviews. I thought the filling could use a little boost, so next time I will mix in a little cream cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Too much garlic. I blended all ingredients with small food chopper. Maybe better with about half the garlic but I won’t make again.

Favorable and a great taste, but a little overwhelming on the salty side.  It was a little watery (grease from the Prosciutto and Ricotta?) as well.  I cooked it longer, but the Prosciutto remained a little limp.  I may try it cold in a tortilla wrap with something to spice up the flavor.

I thought I'll try the recipe as is to see how it tasted.   Prosciutto by itself is way too salty so no need to add more salt as some of the comments below suggest.   Really mince the garlic.   Definitely ricotta by itself with spinach is just way too bland.   I think I need to try again with some mods including adding feta, black pepper and perhaps even using pepperoni instead of prosciutto - so basically a whole new recipe :)

Made this for a New Year's Eve party. Delish! Of course it's salty - prosciutto turns salty was naked, fried, whatever. In fact it's always salty. That's what makes it delish. That's why you don't add salt to the cheese !

These were a hit for our Christmas dinner as an app. I added parm to the cheese mix and they tasted so good. They took a lot longer in the oven to crisp up. Might of been putting two trays in the same oven. Might invest in silicone cups to make it easier.

We only had 1/4 pound of prosciutto, but we still were able to make 16, other ingredients were exactly as listed (we used fat free ricotta). It was absolutely delicious! The filling balances out the saltiness of the prosciutto.
