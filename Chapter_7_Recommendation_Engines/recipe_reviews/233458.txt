Followed the recipe as written.  There is a lot of egg, so the bites were like little omelets to me.  The onion flavor was really strong; the swiss and parm flavors were very subtle.  Pepper jack might be a good fit for this recipe.  Overall, these were just OK to me.

Made these with mozzarella instead of swiss and fresh basil because I already had it on hand.  Got great reviews at the gathering I took them to! Might try it with almond or coconut flour instead of breadcrumbs next time to make it grain free.

I halved this recipe and ended up with 12 "bites".  I had some swiss cheese to use up and several zucchini thanks to a generous neighbor.  I had to use regular French onion soup mix and I'm not sure if that made a difference in the taste but these tasted "off" to me.  It was something different to use zucchini in but I'm not sure I'd make them again.
