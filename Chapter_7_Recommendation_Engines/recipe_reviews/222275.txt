Love your choice of flavorings for the Turtle Burgers! I won a contest two years ago for them but mine included no seasoning ideas so my hats off to you! Have added a photo so everyone can see what they look like cooked :-)

Great use, and fun idea for burgers. Please take this advice....do not put on the grill...BIG mistake, the cheese lite my grill on fire! But putting them in the oven after they got to flaming was a better way to go! My family really enjoyed the burgers, but they were huge! I didn't hear any complaints at all. TY

these were great.  I made just a few changes.  these are too big as described in the recipe.  I used cocktail size hot dogs and made the burger smaller.  Also I added the cheese into the middle of the burger.  I also prefer raw onion on  my burger and my kids do not like them at all so I left them off.  I  have made these several times and they are always a hit.

Next time I will use Lil' Smokies and make them smaller. Not only were they huge but it took much longer to get them cooked inside than the directions called for leaving the hot dogs overdone.
 The idea is fantastic and the kids thought they were fun.

Great and creative idea! The only thing I did different was to use the slices from cutting the tail to a point to make flippers and turn them into sea turtles.
