DELICIOUS! I substituted sesame oil for the chile oil and used Sriracha hot chile sauce to finish for heat. The amount of sauce for the udon noodles was a little short. Next time I will make 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce.

This is really good and super easy for a weeknight dinner! I followed the recipe as written, except I doubled the recipe, used the juice from the rotisserie chicken in place of 1/2 the broth, and added a little sesame oil. Not too spicy - heat lovers may want to add crushed red pepper like my guys did, but I ate it as is and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Made a few changes: subbed fried tofu for chicken, fresh udon instead of dried, no peanuts or cilantro, and added a bit more peanut butter to the sauce. It was very tasty and rich.

Absolutley delicious!  My local co-op has a deli item like this that I wanted to recreate at home.  I loved being able to add lots of veggies.  I sauteed red pepper, pea pods and green onion in a little sesame oil to crisp-tender before adding at the end.  Also, chunky pb did the trick and I didn't need additional peanuts.   I think I will reduce the ginger to 1 TBSP next time.  I didn't use chicken...marinated tofu would be great in this, though.

I received rave reviews from family and friends and it's so quick and easy to make!  I use a nice big pan and mix everything (except toppings) into the sauce in the pan.  Add a little extra stock if it's too dry.  To save time, I doubled the peanut butter (crunchy, natural peanut butter from the health shop) and left out the peanuts at the end, as recommended by some reviewers.  2 handfuls of snow peas, rinsed in boiling water and cut into strips, make a delicious addition.  If you don't have a roast chicken, use 4 chicken breasts - fry in the pan before making the sauce, remove, slice and add at the end.

What can I say except that I LOVED this dish!!!  We only have one grocery store and, unfortunately, I couldn't find chili oil so didn't add it.  I also didn't add the chicken but, I imagine this would be fantastic with prawns too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe as we will definitely be doing it again!

This was actually pretty good. I did not have fresh ginger, so I substituted powdered ginger instead. I also used minced garlic (out of a jar) for a quicker recipe. This was quick, yummy, and delicious. The only thing I will do different next time is use less soy sauce. It came out kind of salty. Only my opinion though. Thanks! :)

I first want to say that I didn't have all the ingredients so that could be part of why I only gave it 4 stars. 
I used chicken breast. I boiled the breast than shredded... taste great. I do not like honey so I left that out. I didn't have red peppers which I think if I did this recipe might have been 5 stars. I added carrots which turned out good. If I make this again I will add carrots along with the red bell pepper. I only had dried cilantro which I couldn't even taste so next time I will make sure to have fresh cilantro. I had hot chili oil which gave it a nice kick. I saw a similar recipe that added a splash of lime just before serving.

This is very good. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it could use a little more sauce. It is super easy to make and instead of chicken, I used prawns in this recipe and added some snow peas. The shrimp really made it a nice meal. It was almost a little better the next day reheated. It is very good, but could use a little bit more sauce. I will make this again for sure.

For my first udon noodle recipe this was pretty tasty. I increased the number of noodles by a few ounces because that was the package size they had. The sauce turned out very good. However, the red bell pepper should probably just be chopped; I told my helping fiance 'thinly sliced' and though they were thin, the resulting pieces were a little awkward to eat with noodles. I didn't have fresh cilantro so I had to use dried. Also, I used chunky PB instead of add peanuts, but if you already have some peanuts on hand they'd probably make for better texture variety. I will make this again but probably not for a while. I used 3 chicken breasts (shredded) instead of a rotisserie but still ended up with so much leftover. Next time I will try to stick more closely to the 9oz of noodles.

This recipe was very tasty as written.  While the rotissere chicken is very convenient, I may try this recipe with chicken breasts next time.

I agree it requires a little more stock.  I added orange bell pepper just because I like color and had it on hand.  I also drizzled a little sesame oil on the noodles before tossing them with the sauce.   It was really delicious and I'll make it again. My husband loved it.

I substituted pre-prepared teriyaki fried tofu (President's Choice) for the chicken, fresh udon instead of dried, and used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth. We loved this dinner and it is so easy to make.

A touch salty for our palette so next time I'm going to use water instead of chicken stock, and will probably up the peanut butter a little.  I didn't have low sodium soy - that usually helps a lot.  I used tofu instead of chicken and pan fried it first, added red peppers just at the end for a minute, then added noodles and sauce.  (Stupid supermarket didn't have udon, so I used whole grain fettucine.) Delish!!

I made a variation of this as a side dish, which included just the noodles and sauce topped with green onions and sesame sticks--no chicken or peppers.  It was really good and the perfect side dish to "Sesame Crusted Mahi Mahi with Ginger Butter Sauce". It was almost too spicy for me; I know it would've been too hot for others.  I'll make it again, I'll just use slightly less chili oil.

This was really very good and quick to make. I added the thinly sliced carrots that someone else suggested and thinly sliced zucchini (because I was craving it and needed to use it up) and sauted the veggies a bit before adding the garlic and ginger. I only added a dash of soy sauce because I don't like things too salty. It turned out great and my husband loved it.

So easy yet so delicious.  I added a bit more garlic, ginger and peanut butter than called for just for my own taste.  Also diced up a carrot and added it to the mix.  Made enough to take leftovers in for lunch.  Coworkers will be jealous.  So good!  Will definitely make again.

This was really delicious, but just a tad too spicy. I made as written, but omitted the chicken. Next time I will cut the chili oil to a tsp and it should be perfect!

This dish was delicious and my picky eater said I could actually sell this at a restaurant:) I crumbled extra firm tofu into the sauce because I am vegetarian. The tofu was great in this. Yum yum!

Made this with leftover beef/beef broth, carrots instead of red bell pepper.  We reserved some of the beef broth for family members who prefer the soupy version.  This is comfort food.

oh wow - 5 stars for taste and ease. I made 1.5x more sauce, though, and sauteed the red pepper in some oil and lots of extra garlic before adding it to the noodles. Instead of the chili oil I just used canola. I also used 1/4 tsp ground ginger. And instead of the udon I had spaghetti noodles so I just made those, although next time I will try to look for udon in an ethnic grocery store. I did not use peanuts or cilantro and I tossed the green onions in the noodles after everything else was mixed. This was soooooo delicious and easy.

This was very good. The amount of sauce was the right amount! I skipped the oil and used sriracha instead. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.

Even after paring this recipe down because I wasn't up for cooking chicken/tofu at the time, this was flavorful and unique as a light snack. I used a few squirts of sriracha in place of the chile oil and dispensed with the pepper, scallion and peanuts, and that barebones take on it still came out quite nice. Will definitely make again this in some form or another.

Love this recipe.  Sauce is wonderful. I wanted a little more sauce.  Made a slurry with a cornstarch and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. No leftovers so, I will have to make another batch.

My family really liked these Noodles.  They are really good at room temperature and make great leftovers.

EXCELLENT recipe! I have made this twice now, both times with boneless, skinless chicken breasts sauteed in sesame oil in lieu of rotisserie chicken. I also added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes to give it that extra little zing! (We like it spicy in our house) Easy, easy recipe with fantastic flavor. Two thumbs up!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I was able to whip this up super fast with what I had in my kitchen and it is really delish!  I cut the servings down to 2 because it was just my daughter and me, but we actually got a 3rd meal out of it for her friend who stayed.  They both loved it.  Thanks Mojito Mama- cute name!

Loved this! We used thin spaghetti (the Udon noodles were really expensive at our grocery store) and subbed sesame oil and chile paste instead of chile oil.  I also boiled & diced one boneless chicken breast instead of getting a rotisserie chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent...I took out the chicken and chili oil (small kids) and served as a side dish with Asian style turkey burgers.  Very good.

I made this for a meatless meal, so I didn't include the chicken and added in a fresh vegetable mix that included snow peas and broccoli.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My whole family loved it.  I could eat the peanut sauce plain, it's so good!

Delicious even without the red pepper which I didn't have on hand. Sauce is perfect. And I used chicken tenders that I sauted first. Thanks for this tasty gem.

Excellent. No need to change anything really, unless you like spicy than maybe add a little something spicy to it. I will be making this again.

Yummy! I really dont like peanut butter but enjoyed this did make a few changes because didnt have all ingredients. With the sauce I used 2 veggie bullion with 1/2 cup water and sweet red chili sauce instead of the listed ingredients. and instead of chicken I used mushrooms and slightly sauteed them and the red bell .pepper. It wasa little to salty for my taste but that could be due tot he veg boullion. Verynice surprise!!

Wonderful recipe. I doubled the quantity of sauce and because I ran out of chili oil, I used half toasted sesame oil.

This was okay, maybe I just didnt like the overwhelming amount of peanutbutter in it.  I tasted the sauce before I put it on the noodles and it was way too nutty for my taste, but it tasted a LOT better with the chicken and the noodles.

Just made this for dinner.  This would have been really good without all the additions I made.  If you make this the sauce is not enough.  You should do at least 1 1/2 times of the sauce.  We like veggies so I made 4 times the amount of sauce and added a Tablespoon of sesame oil.  I pan fried 2 chicken breasts and diced those up and I sautéed 1 sm onion, 2 peeled sliced carrots, 2 stalks of celery sliced, 2 sliced zucchinis and 1 1/2 c of chopped broccoli.  All of those were tossed with the noodles and sauce then topped with green onions, cilantro and chopped peanuts.  It was creamy and delicious.  I will be making this again.

This dish is fantastic and has been a go-to for me for awhile now. I have only made it with tofu rather than chicken and it still tastes like it comes from a fancy restaurant. I have found that squeezing lime on at the end really takes it to another level. Also, I wonder if people are complaining about the sweetness and/or saltiness being too much because they aren't using all natural peanut butter. When using  peanut butter that only contains peanuts in its ingredients, this dish is perfect. Also, I double the sauce because I love it. As well, using sesame oil also adds to the nutty taste and oh, I just love this dish!

One of our favorite warm weather dinners. I have made this often. I also add carrot matchsticks which I "cook" by putting in the colander and then draining the cooked pasta on top of them.

Love this recipe! I made a few adjustments, added a hot pepper, and used powdered PB instead. Added some more vegetables, so I bought a bag of coleslaw and tossed it in! Easy and delicious!

I made the sauce, substituting sesame oil for the chili oil, and adding some chilli garlic sauce.  I only used half of a rotisserie chicken and half of the package of noodles.  I did not add the cilantro.  The dish was good, but even better warmed up the next day.  Next time I would add a lot more vegetables.

My teenage daughter made this for dinner and it was delicious! I asked her to find something to do with the rotisserie chicken I brought home and she decided on this recipe. I suggested that she triple the sauce ingredients since we all like a lot of sauce, and it was perfect for us. She did add some shredded carrots and maybe a few other veggies that needed to be used up. Very, very yummy!

You don't need a whole rotisserie chicken and the stipulation only inflates the difficulty. Any chicken will do as long as it's in bite sized pieces.

This dish is simple and really tasty.  My picky 10 year old finished dinner before any of us, which is a real testament in my books!  I doubled the sauce to make sure we had lots and it was worth it.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.

We LOVED it!!!  I used freshly sautéed chicken and added a package of "broccoli slaw" after cooking the chicken.  Then made as per recipe/instructions.

I followed the recipe except I used packaged already-cooked udon noodles I had on hand and used chicken breast that I cooked in my pressure cooker and the broth from that. I thought it was good, but my husband didn't care for the sauce so we won't have it again.

I used the mai fun (rice) noodles because I prefer a lighter noodle.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce as others suggested but I wouldn't do that again, especially with the lighter noodles.  Next time I'll add just a spoonful of peanut butter since I thought it overpowered the dish even though I didn't double that ingredient.  I used sesame oil and added a fresh chili pepper rather than buy an ingredient I wouldn't use much for other meals.  Also added juliened carrots and broccoli because I like that in  my stir fry.

This is a great recipe! Simple to put together and really flavorful. I added black sesame seeds and chili flakes instead of the oil. Used the toppings suggested. Loved it!

Two minor substitutions:  Didn't have Udon noodles so I used fettucine.  Didn't have chili oil so used 2 tsps. sweet Thai Chili sauce and 1 tsp. vegetable oil.
This was so delicious!  Three teens in the house and they loved it.  I will make this again.  Inexpensive and easy!

This recipe is awesome for when you don't want to spend a lot of time on dinner- but still really delicious!  I've made this so many times with lots of different variations (added different veggies, made the chicken myself, used zucchini noodles instead), and it always tastes wonderful.  The sauce is the best part, but udon noodles are always tasty too.

Everyone really enjoyed this, great flavors! Definitely need to make extra since everyone will want seconds! I used 2 x 7.2oz packages of UDON noodles, "Japanese flavor" omitting the seasoning packet that came with it and combined with double the sauce. It was good to have extra sauce. I used a cheese grater to mince the ginger root and then a strainer to remove solid pieces of garlic and ginger before adding sauce to noodles. To reduce the heat I used 1 T sesame oil +1t hot chili oil instead of 1T +1t chili oil.

Delicious!  I omitted the green onions, cilantro & red pepper because I didn't have them, but I would add if I had them (And maybe some bean sprouts!).  I also substituted the udon noodles with rice noodles & shrimp for the chicken.  I  added 1/2 cup carrots & 6 scrambled eggs.  The lime, ginger & chili oil is a must to give a slight spicy & fresh kick!  I also doubled the sauce, did 2/3 of the soy sauce & quadrupled the peanut butter- because I love the extra peanut butter flavor!  I'm not sure if you'd need to double or not with Udon Noodles.

This dish was excellent, even though I had to substitute a few things. Had canned chicken, tomatoes, and spinach as stand ins but it still turned out delicious. It's the sauce that does it!

Very good!  The sauce is a bit heavy, so the nice thing is a little goes a long way and fills you up.  I added a bit more garlic, sriracha, ginger, soy sauce, and honey as the peanut flavor of the peanut butter was a bit overwhelming.

Everyone but the 6 year old liked it.  Good peanut flavor; doubled the sauce...probably should have only increased by 1.5.  Added 1/2 a zucchini, sliced mushrooms, 16 oz. fresh udon and 1/2 c. orange bell pepper, chopped.  Quick and tasty one pot meal.

Totally amazing and delicious recipie. My whole family is addicted to it and they make me cook it every time I come visit. I changed a few parts to make it easier to cook though. Instead of chopping up peanuts I just use extra crunchy peanut butter (already has chopped peanuts in it!) Also I get pre-cooked udon noodles that are packaged from costco and they work perfect!

We love this recipe with a few changes to accommodate our preferences and a vegetarian diet. We make it with tofu instead of chicken, use 1 cup of water with one vegetable bouillion cube (instead of the chicken broth), and use 2tsps each of sesame oil and sriracha instead of the chili oil. A real staple in our home.

Love this recipe. Like others I have been "noodling" around with it.  We are lucky to have an awesome Asia market in our neighborhood. Tonight we are serving it with fresh udon noodles. and Thai peanut sauce.  Can't wait to see the smiles on our guests faces!!

This was delicious! I made a few changes though: I used ground ginger instead of fresh, 2 tsp sesame oil instead of chile oil and 1/4 tsp of chile-garlic sauce. I topped it off with a squirt of sriracha hot sauce too. So good!

So delicious!  I doubled the sauce and thickened it a little (with cornstarch/water).  We loved it!

This was great, but after reading other reviews, I deecided to double the sauce recipe.  I'm so glad that I did, because there would not have been enough sauce.  I couldn't find chile oil, so used sesame oil and added some sriracha for heat. I will make this again!

Go easy on the peanut butter, it seems to gum up and get a bit thick and sticky.

So good! I double the sauce, and use 1 box of Dreamfield's spaghetti since I can't have regular noodles. I also throw in about 1 TBS of sriracha sauce since my husband I like really spicy food.
