Great!  Wouldn't change a thing! Saute mushrooms after removing from marinade just before serving until lightly brown. Reserve wonderful marinade, great for dipping bread and pouring over steak at the table. Rave reviews from family!

This recipe was easy and tasty, but much too salty for me.  I'll make it again, but cut way down on the salt.

The lemon juice overwhelmed all of the other flavors. If I made it again I would completely take out the lemon juice.

I hate mushroom, but my husband likes them...so I made this recipe to take to a dinner at a friends house and everyone loved it!! I only had time to marinate them for 5 hours, but I think I will make it again and marinate it for the full 24hrs and I bet they'll be fabulous. I even ate some :)

Yum! I made these last night so that I had some healthy-ish snacks in the refrigerator.... now I have to go to the grocery store and buy more mushrooms. 

Even my boyfriend who won't eat mushrooms tried one and said it tastes "okay." (And that's high praise for a mushroom from him)

Very tasty.   I made a double batch for a work party and there were almost none left. I added the zest of one of the lemons to the marinade, but I love lemon.  I think that next time I will use the amount of parsley called for but will use fresh parsley instead of dried... I think that is what is missing.... maybe use fresh thyme too...  will definitely make again

These were wonderful, but had way too much parsley. I marinated them overnight, then made a new batch of marinate, leaving out the parsley and lightly rinsed the mushrooms to get rid of some of the parsley. Family loved them. Would make again but with just a sprinkling of parsley.

This was certainly easy to make and very zesty, but I would have to agree that it has too much salt--and I even pared it down a little!  If I could, I'd give it 4½ stars because I think the salt was the only drawback.  Next time I will try ½ t rather than one whole teaspoon.  After all, the other marinade ingredients are quite flavorful on their own.

This recipe was a hit served as hors d'oeuvres for a party.  Everyone loved it and was so impressed.  But the room did smell very strongly of garlic, so I'd suggest cutting down the garlic to about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.  Some of my guests also suggested a little less lemon.  But for anyone who loves a citrus-y taste, this is really tasty!

This was fairly good. It didn't wow me, but this was probably the first time I've ever eaten marinated mushrooms (I used to hate mushrooms, and even afterwards avoided this "weird" kind of dish). I made it exactly as written - though I didn't have freshly-squeezed lemon juice, but used the bottled kind. I'd also never stemmed mushrooms before - I just leveled them off instead of cutting into the mushroom caps. Perhaps there was too much parsley - not that I minded the taste, but it was more of an appearance/texture thing. But I don't agree with some previous reviewers' complaints about too much salt or lemon juice. I might not make this recipe again, but it was a nice introduction to this kind of dish, and since I like mushrooms a lot now, I'll probably eat, if not prepare, marinated mushrooms again.

these were ok.  there was too much parsley for my taste - it totally filled the inside of each mushroom where the stems had been removed.  i tried one after they had marinated for 24 hrs in the mixture and wasn't really impressed, so the next day i cooked them in a frying pan with some sliced onions and ate them over steak for dinner - they were better this way.  the rest of the marinade was awesome as a dipping sauce though.  i'll probably try this again with less parsley, but for the time being i'm going to stick to the marinated mushrooms II recipe.

Good but not fabulous...  I cut back on the parsley and omitted the salt but I still think the parsley was overwhelming.  I liked the taste of thyme but I will keep looking for the right recipe.

Yum.  Outstanding. I added more spices as I like them pretty flavorful. I double the batches and kept them in a bowl all week. I ate them raw and I also sautéed them in their own marinade and paired them with a steak. Yum. I will use this recipe again. I am the only one that likes mushrooms in my family so I don’t eat them very often. Plus I don’t want them to go bad. I also threw in some Swiss cheese chunks and ate those with them. Very tasty. Thanks!

This recipe was ok.  I made it according to the directions, except that I added a tablespoon or two of fresh chopped chives.  The marinade smelled delicious and led me to believe that the flavor would be something like marinated mushrooms I've had at restaurants, but after 24 hours of marinating the mushrooms had picked up very little flavor, and even when I sampled the marinade itself I was surprised by how bland it was.  The mushrooms still tasted pretty much like mushrooms--not worth the added calories of the marinade, in my opinion.
