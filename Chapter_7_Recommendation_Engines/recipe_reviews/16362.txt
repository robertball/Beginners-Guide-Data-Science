This recipe is great, and making it is about as easy as falling off a log. You need to know some things though, so yours will turn out wonderfully, like mine does every time i make this recipe. 
First of all, the pork should be relatively pink when it is done. This is due to the fact that it was swimming in Burgundy Red Wine. Be sure to use a meat thermometer and bring the temp to 160, and if any of your guests complains that they think they are going to get trichanosis, politely ask them to leave and go to applebees where they process and overcook everything. 
Next, I am not sure how this recipe was called Burgundy Pork Tenderloin and it calls for red wine. Be sure to use BURGUNDY red wine, as the title suggests. The fun thing about burgundy is that there is no such thing as an expensive burgundy wine. It is usuall near the mogen david and other cheap wines. Don't bother changing the Bbrown gravy amount. Also, the first time I made this I thought I would be smart and braise the roast first to make it more tender. The next time I made it I just threw all the ingredient into the pan as the recipe suggests and it came out way better. It takes about five minutes to construct this recipe and it is the best I have ever found. 
Have fun!

This is my all time favorite recipe.  I've been making it for the past two years now and figured it's about time that I finally rate it.  I've learned to omit the onions and the celery as they really don't improve the taste beyond the seasonings.  Also, this means that I don't have to strain out the onion and celery from the wine before making the gravy, I can just take the loin out to rest on a cutting board and put the pan right on top of the stove with the wine still in it to make the gravy. I use two packages of gravy mix as I serve this with quartered red potatoes tossed with butter and parsley and baked alongside the pork (which the gravy goes well with) and with the PAN-FRIED ASPARAGUS (Recipe on the site).  It's wonderful.  You must try if you haven't already.

This was EXCEPTIONAL, make no mistake - it's great. But make sure to use fresh (not previously frozen) tenderloin. I had 4 tenderloins (3lbs) which I marinated for 1 hour in a ¼ cup of olive oil and ½ cup of white wine, combined with one small bunch of chopped green onions, and 2 small peeled anneheim peppers (chopped), 5 cloves of crushed garlic, and a fair bit of fresh ground pepper (approx. 3tbs). 

After tranfering the meat and marinade to the roasting dish, I covered everything with 2 cups of freshly sliced small brown mushrooms, 2 cups of red wine (Valpolicella), and one cup of beef broth.

I turned the meat after 25 minutes and stuck a thermometer into one of the larger pieces and waited until the temp got to 155°F. I removed them immediately (the real issue with this is, don't over cook). I covered the meat with foil and let sit while I transfered everything that was remaining into a sauce pan and made the gravy. I used a little flour and some beef soup mix. When the gravy was done, I sliced the tenderloins into ½ inch thick slices and served with fresh garden beans and mashed red potatoes (skin left on and seasoned to taste). 

The gravy and the tenderloin were to die for. Enjoy!

Just one more thing. Make sure to serve on warm plates so that you can take your time to enjoy this fabulous dish.

OUCH, way to much wine....  Reduced the wine by 1 cup and subbed low sodium beef broth the second time around.  Used fresh minced garlic vs powder and seared the pork prior to baking as it makes a much better presentation when finished.  Added baby brown bella mushrooms to the pork while baking and used 2 packages of pork gravy mix.  One tip I'd like to share:  Smaller tenderloins are easier to cook and monitor to prevent dryness ~ some pink in the middle of pork is fine unlike the old wives tales we have all heard for years....   Very tasty dish!

I am only 13 and am an aspiring chef, so I try to cook for my parents and sister (they are kind of like my recipe guinea pigs) my sister is also an EXTREMELY picky eater, and even she loved it, so far I haven’t found one person who didn’t like it. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

P.S. make more red wine mix than advised and make with mashed potatoes, the gravy wine mixture is great with mashed potatoes.

WOW!!!!!!!! I hesitated on this recipe because it sounded WAY TOO EASY to be that wonderful, but I was wrong. This is a definite keeper, I added portebella mushrooms and I seared the meat in a TB of olive oil and butter to give it a nice color, I found it was perfectly cooked in 45 min be sure to use a meat thermoter and do not over cook!! when it reaches 165 degrees take out and wrap in foil while making the gravy I used 2 cups of Merlot wine and got nervous it might be to much wine taste and added 1/2 CUP WATER so I did use 2 pkgs of Mccormick brown gravy and it was PERFECT a great recipe to impress guests or make for a large crowd, even my husband who really doesn't like pork thought it was FABULOUS my brother in law kept telling me what an awsome dinner rates 10 stars thank you for sharing!!!! I also used 2 1 lb tenderloins that is probably where some of you have had issues with evaporation because larger ones would take longer to cook, try using several small ones

I read all of the reviews before making this and never having made a pork tenderloin before was ready and willing to make any and all changes that other reviewers had suggested.  We like meat braised in wine and I did not change that at all.  You don't need an "expensive" red wine - I used a "2 Buck Chuck" Merlot from Trader Joes that is fine enough to drink as well.   I did sear the pork first because I was fearful of a pale white piece of meat and I was glad I did ( the meat is not red if you sear it first by the way) - the meat was so tender - don't be afraid of a quick hot sear on both sides after seasoning - maybe 2 minutes top each side.  I sauteed some onions ( thinly sliced ) just because this recipe was so fast and I had time so I threw them in the pan with the pork for a little extra zip --  if I had mushrooms in the house I would have done that too -- next time I will.  I doubled the gravy mix because we are gravy people too.  This was OUT OF THIS WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Stock up the freezer when these babies are on sale - it's a no brainer - the quickest after work dinner I have made in a year  !!!!!!!!!!  Thank you Kathleen - this is a keeper in this house !

My guests loved this recipe.  It really helps to read the reviews before cooking. I seared the meat first, used 1c burgundy wine and 1c beef broth, deleted the celery, added mushrooms, chopped the onions,added 2pks of pork gravy mix to the wine sauce and put the sauce in a pan and brought it to a boil. It thickened beautifully.

This is very good,  one thing I ALWAYS do with any cut of  meat I intend to roast in the oven is to brown it first on the stove, otherwise the meat has a very light and unappealing color.  Add salt, pepper, garlic salt to the pork, brown all sides in oil or butter, or both.  Transfer to the baking pan with the wine/broth mixture. I do agree that you must cut the wine down and add beef broth.  I can see why some people said it tasted to strongly of wine, this will help that problem.  For an added touch,  saute mushrooms in the pan you browned the pork in then pour over the finished dish.  Very tasty.

I made a double recipe of this for a family dinner for my parents' anniversary.  We added mushrooms to the veggies and it was WONDERFUL!!  
I cooked it at 375 to go along with the potato side dish I was cooking.  It took about 1 1/2 hours to cook, but was WELL worth the wait.

Definitely the best pork dish I have ever tasted, even from restaurants.  The meat was so tender and juicy.

This is such a simple recipe-  very easy to make- and such a crowd pleaser that I'm sure we will be making this often for when company comes over.

Easy & Delicious. Took advice from others: salt & peppered then seared the tenderloin in a little oil, then placed  in the baking dish.(I was able to purchased just under a pound of the tenderloin). To the frying pan I added 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic, sliced onion and chopped celery and mushrooms. I sauted for a few minutes, then added a little of the wine/broth mixture to the pan, heated for a few minutes then added all over the tenderloin. Covered with foil and cooked just under 35 min. Turned the meat over half way through cooking time as suggested. Inside temp. of meat registered 170F. Let it set for awhile and it was absolutely moist and delicious. Took advice and use 1/2 c. Pinot Noir wine and 1/2 c. broth. I did not make gravy as the small amount of liquid and the juices from the meat was all that was needed. Thanks for all the reviews and especially to Browndog for the recipe. This is a keeper. Going to have my students make it in class next week. Those of you that are saying it is too salty, DOUBLE CHECK to be sure you are using Garlic Powder and NOT Garlic SALT and check the sodium content on the pkg. of gravy. This is the only way it can be too salty! The amount of salt in the recipe is not much for 2 pounds of pork tenderloin and don't add extra salt at the table.

OMG - this is the best pork recipe I've ever made (or eaten)!  I used the advice of some and used 1 cup wine and 1 cup water, instead of 2 cups wine.  I also eliminated the veggies and used 2 packs of gravy mix instead of 1.  Great results!  My husband LOVED it and even my finicky 4 yr old ate the meat.  It's SO easy to prepare and to clean up!  Highly recommended!

I read the reviews thoroughly before making this recipe. I too decided to use less wine, some beef broth and water. I'm not quite sure of the proportions, other than the fact that I used a little less than a cup of wine all in all. Then probably a half of water, and a half of broth. I must stress that you need to make the gravy according to the package! If it calls for 1 cup water, use 1 cup of the wine/meat juice mixture to keep the proportions correct so it actually turns out like gravy. You may want to double the gravy recipe so there is enough. I also added 8 red potatoes rubbed in olive oil and sea salt to the dish. I covered the pan with foil before baking, and it was done perfectly in 45 minutes. This meal turned out amazing, celery and all. I didn't use Burgundy wine either, I used Cabernet Sauvignon because that's all I had...a pretty strong/dry wine. Next time I will try the burgundy and see if there's really a taste difference.

I'm sorry to leave such a poor review when the recipe got so many raves.  The taste, however, wasn't very good, and it looked extremely unappealing.  After cooking in burgundy wine, the pork took on an unappetizing grayish purple color.  The sauce turned a dark blackish purple when I added the brown gravy mix.  The "purple" meat with "black sauce" reminded me of orc carnage from Lord of the Rings.

Just had this for dinner tonight and all I can say is "Wow-Wee-Ka-Zow-Wee!" One of the best recipes I've tried from this site, and I have literally tried hundreds! I served it with egg noodles and it was superb. This one deserves more than 5 stars... It was quick to put together and came out tasting like I had been slaving in the kitchen for hours. Even my husband raved about it and he's not one to give up compliments very easily! Thank you for submitting this one; we LOVED it!

I loved this!  I put it in the slow cooker this morning and just added 2 cups of beef broth with it to make sure it was covered.  9 hours later, it was absolutely perfect.

Very good! BF says it's the 2nd best thing I've made!!! The gravy has a WONDERFUL taste - not your run of the mill "tenderloin with brown gravy". Certainly guest-worthy. Here's what I did to suit my / our palates: a) omitted celery, b) seasoned tenderloin (mine was approx. 1.5 lb. for 2 ppl. - w/ leftovers) w/ fresh cracked black pepper & celery salt to taste, c) cut slits in meat & filled with fresh minced garlic (~ 2 cloves), d) seared in 1 T EVOO (2 min. per side on med-high heat), e) sauteed onion in remaining oil until soft, f) topped with onions, a couple rosemary sprigs & a drizzle of EVOO & g) poured mixture of 1 c. Pinot Noir & 1 c. low-sodium beef broth over all. Covered w/ aluminum foil & baked at 350 degrees (in a greased 9x13 in. dish) for 45 min. (as suggested - add'l. time not needed) to an internal temp. of 160 degrees. My tenderloin was nicely browned (not purple from the wine as some have warned), even tho I did not turn it 1/2 way thru. Marinating beforehand is NOT necessary (I can see how it might "stain" the meat). For the gravy, I poured wine / broth mixture (w/ cooking juices) into a sm. saucepan, added packet of brown gravy called for & brought to a boil. Reduced heat, stirring constantly until thickened (it thickened nicely). Not too wine-y : ) Served wtih mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus & the remaining wine, of course! Thx!

Based on other reviews, I did the following: I used 1 1/4 lbs for 2 people. First I sliced small pockets into the meat and stuffed them w/minced garlic. Then I rubbed it w/Montreal Steak seasoning. I browned it and then baked it for approx 1 hr @ 400 degrees or until internal temp was 160 degrees. For the sauce I used 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth, 1/2 package mushroom gravy mix and 1/4 sliced onion. I did have to use corn starch to thicken the sauce. Absolutely no leftovers!!!

My boyfriend is also not a huge fan of pork, and he said he could eat this once a week.  I also added mushrooms,used half red wine and half beef stock, and served with mashed potatoes.  Agree with previous review about the unappealing gray color.  Will definitely brown the pork on stove before baking next time.

This was great!! Looked at many reviews and took some advice from others to brown the pork a bit on the skillet to give it color and used fresh onions & fresh garlic instead. Did not use celery and did use 2 packets of gravy mix but make sure you really mix it in well or else it gets lumpy and very thick the gravy...Add a little water to mix it better if wish

I generally prefer my pork tenderloin smoked with some chutney on the side.  I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe--it didn't seem like the combination of ingredients would be that good, but it turned out wonderfully!  I would rate this 10 stars just for how easy it was to make.  On top of that, the flavor was savory and delectable.  Both my fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed it...will definitely make again.  Served w/ mashed potatoes & green beans w/ almonds.  Used a Cabernet Sauvignon since that's what we had on hand, and did not use the celery or onions...just rubbed the meat w/ Greek Spices, poured the wine over, and baked...tasty and easy--gotta love that!

This will be a repeat recipe.  The flavor was very good.  As stated by other reviewers, be sure to sear the meat to seal in the juices.  I'm sure it would be dry otherwise.  I suggest you double all ingredients relating to the gravy because a lot of it evaporates while cooking.  I hardly had enough gravy for one person left after cooking.  I also used 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth.  I don't like a heavy wine taste and this was perfect.  This recipe is easy and flavorful so I highly recommend trying it.

Great recipe.  I've made my tenderloin like this for several years with two exceptions. First I marinate the meat overnight and sear it in a hot pan with a little oil before putting it in the oven.  This helps keeps all the juices in the meat.  Second, I add beef broth as other reviews have suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  The suggestion to serve with mashed potatoes was a great one- the gravy is very good with it.  I seared the tenderloin before adding the vegetables and wine- it didn't really end up with a "purple" color that way.  Since I seared it, I also cut down the oven time to 35 minutes.  We will be making this often!

Thank-you Kathleen! I made this pork tenderloin last evening (following the exact recipe) and I must agree with 99% of the other reviwers, it is delicious!!! I certainly can't see where the other 1% found fault. Using a 'good' red wine might help those who thought it was too winey. The only thing I would change next time is using brown gravy mix. It was my first experience with brown gravy mix and my last. I was able to doctor up the sauce to make it edible but maybe using something like Knorr's Bernaise Sauce might be better. Or as another reviewer mentioned just thickening the wine and pan juices with cornstarch. Since I had opened a nice Cabernet for the cooking (and had the rest with dinner), the basis of the sauce was quite yummy and I probably should have went with a thickener. Five Stars for sure on the pork.
Has anyone ever tried making this with port? Maybe that will be my next attempt, as I do LOVE port!

4 stars for taste but I did make some changes. I used crushed garlic which I stuffed into cuts in the meat. Also omitted the celery and added mushrooms because that's what I had in the fridge. Used red onion. This did take way longer to cook than indicated and I did separate my pork tenderloin into 2 pieces. Sauce was yummy.

I love this recipe. Now, some common sense is required. Would I use any recipe with package gravy mix for Easter Dinner? No! It's a good everyday meal for your family. I've read that people think it's too winey...you have to taste your food people...before you serve it. I tasted it when the pork was done, decided it was a little too winey for my kids. So, I poured it into a saucepan, boiled it down a bit and then added the gravy mix. This is all done while the tenderloin is resting...so don't slice it until the sauce is ready to pour on top. My kids loved it and didn't mention any "funny" taste. 
I omit the celery and use celery salt instead of salt. I also make sure to slice the onions super thin...you can also saute them a bit first if you like. In a pinch, I have used onion powder...works just fine. 
Also, before baking, pour the wine on first, then add the salt, etc. Common sense tells you that the wine will just wash it all off the pork. 
One last thing...I can't believe all the complaints about the cooking time. Use a meat thermometer! pork needs to be 150 degrees F, when it comes out of the oven. It needs to rest 10 minutes - to lock in the juices. The temperature will continue to rise 5-10 degrees as it sits.
Now, enjoy!

Spectacular!  This is a meal I'd be proud to serve to company.  I added button mushrooms and baby carrots to the sliced onion and wine before cooking.  I baked at 350 degrees for one hour to ensure doneness.  The pork tenderloin was melt in your mouth delicious.  And the veggies really soaked up the wine flavor.  I also added two packets of brown gravy mix to the sauce, and thickened with flour.  It was wonderful served over mashed potatoes!  I can't say enough about this wonderful recipe.

This is my first review after trying dozens of recipes, some good, some, well..not so good.  This was excellent.  Hubby and I are picky and normally have pork tenderloin maybe 2-3 times a year, but this will definitely get a place in the normal rotation of favorites.  I did sear the tenderloin in a bit of olive oil (once seasoned per recipe) for one minute per side, (about 3 turns for my 1.5 pounder).  Then, I cooked it for 35 mins, which per oven, could vary, so I'd suggest as per the previous reviews to check the temp.  I didn't have brown gravy mix, so I added an undiluted can of campbells french onion soup and thickened the entire mixture with a tiny bit of cornstarch diluted in cool water (about a tbsp cornstarch and 1/4 cup water), bring to a boil and yummmm.   No pork left over, but took the remaining sauce and onions and put it with the rice for lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was FANTASTIC. After reading a number of reviews stating that the meat did not have a very good color, I made the following modification:  I sprinkled 2 TBSP of minced garlic over the onions and celery.  I then baked the tenderloin, covered in foil for 20 minutes on 350.  I then removed the foil and increased the temperature to 500 and continued to roast for 10 minutes; I turned over and roasted an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven when the meat registers an internal temp of 160 degrees.  Move meat to a platter and cover with foil, allowing it to rest while making the gravy.  This roast was moist, flavorful and oh-so-tender.  The gravy was wonderful served over mashed potatoes.

This sounded easy and delicious, and it was.  I modified it slightly, but it is such a good base recipe you can play with it a little.  I omitted the celery, added sliced cremini mushrooms to the onion & fresh garlic, and browned the meat before roasting.  I also subbed a cup of chicken broth for half of the wine.  It took 2 packets of brown gravy mix to thicken the amount of sauce I had, and the sauce is sooo delicious.  One pan, easy peasy, everyone LOVED it.  I would absolutely make this for company.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for dinner tonight. AMAZING!!!!! The only thing I changed was I used jarred garlic and spread it all over the meat. About a tablespoon or so. My son made Sliders with it and added the gravy atop the meat. The rest of us served it like the photo. 
Really, this recipe was flawless. And I'm considered a great cook.

This recipe was amazing!  I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and sauteed the onion and celery before adding them to the meat.  I also used 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of chicken broth (I just used a Merlot we had on hand).  I also used 2 packets of gravy at the end.  My kids liked it so much they asked for seconds!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was THE BEST TENDERLOIN EVER I have made!! And I have made tons of pork tenderloin recipes. I think this was the most tender, most flavorful one I have ever made. Everyone LOVED it. I did dredge the tenderloin in flour, and browned it in olive oil. Then I put it into the 13 x 8 pan with 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup of cabernet. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic powder, cooked till 155, took it out to rest. I poured the sauce into a saucepan and whisked in 1 pack of McCormick brown gravy, brought to simmer for a minute, then let it sit to thicken. I reheated it when the meat was sliced. You MUST try this, you will love it.

Found this recipe yesterday, made it last night, giving it 5 stars today. A very easy and good recipe!  Followed some reviewers advice -- browned well-seasoned pork before baking, left out celery & onion (not necessary but I may use next time), used (old) Burgundy & beef broth mix -- and it turned out great.  The gravy was yummy -- don't forget to bring to boil then simmer the gravy for a few minutes after you add the dry mix to get it to thicken.  Cooking time's about right for my 1.5lb piece of meat.  So nice to have a non-teriyaki pork recipe for a change!  And it's SOOOO easy, did I mention that already?

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  It was absolutely delicious-the whole family devoured it and my husband literally licked the gravy pan clean.  I used half red wine and half beef broth to pour over the tenderloin and no celery or onions.  The meat was moist and tender and the gravy was better than any flavor I've ever had in a restaurant.  I did flip the tenderloin over about halfway through to even out the wine coverage.  (It helps with moistness of meat).  This recipe will definitely make it into my collection!  Thank you, thank you!

Stated by my family, this was a wonderful recipe. Although I'm not a big meat fan, I did taste and thought it was tender and flavorful. I took the advice of many reviewers and seared the meat first, but not before rubbing the pork with garlic and onion powder and some black pepper. I did use the two cups of wine and added a small can of chicken broth. (again, more seasonings) In the end there was a considerable abount of evaporation, so I added another can of broth. Once off the stove, I poured the gravy into a sauce pan, added my gravy mix and thickened with cornstarch. Happy family Kathleen and thanks!

What a wonderful recipe!  I replaced the celery with 3 cups of mushrooms (we LOVE mushrooms), used fresh garlic instead of powder and I used Marsala wine insted of the red.  I made it last week when we had my Dad (who is hard to please) and his new wife over.  Everyone loved it!!  I served it with a salad and mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so exciting because there's so much to play around with. The celery onions and/or peppers in my opinion should be seared with the pork tenderloins. I used all herbs such as roasted garlic herbs, garlic powder, green onions, onion powder and table blend to enhance the flavor of the pork. I used zesty shaghetti powder mixed with water and red cooking wine to enhance the flavor even more. I placed the tenderloins in a large cooking bag added celery flakes potatoes and carrots along with this flavorful juice I created. After 45 minutes I pulled this delicious meat out of the oven and IT WAS PHENOMENAL!!!!! My hubby and kids cleaned their plates and the pots, thanks so much allrecipes.com

We won't be making this again.  Perhaps I should have covered it while cooking.  The onions were dried out and couldn't be eaten.  The sauce was way to strong of wine, and I had reduced its amount and added beef stock in as well.  Also, very salty.  Probably from the gravy packet mix.  Sorry.  Did not care for this.

So simple and easy yet soooooo tasty!  I would rate this a 10 if I could!  The gravy, oh the gravy...I could drink it up it's soooooo good.  Perfect for an easy, yet sophisticated dinner party.  Absolutely a keeper!

I read the reviews first (thanks to those that took the time) and made a few adjustments for our tastes.  This recipe was a HUGE success.  I picked a mid-range Merlot (hard to do as not a wine drinker), and cut it with 1C broth, and instead of garlic powder and celery - I used 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I did need to thicken the gravy in a skillet (heat was dissipating too quickly in the baking dish), but 1 packet of gravy mix (I used pork gravy) was plenty.

Very easy recipe to do, and I highly suggest it.  Sauteed mushrooms (with a bit of garlic and merlot) balance it nicely on the plate with some mashed potatoes and green beans.

Very yummy. I added mushrooms--they come out looking a little, well, purple from the wine, but are still good.  Not so good as leftovers--the mushrooms turned to sludge and the meat was just okay--so don't make extra.

Wonderful recipe. It's so easy I've been making it once a week! I turn the tenderloin over 1/2 way through cooking time so I don't have a problem with the color.  I've also browned the tenderloin in olive oil first.
Have served with garlic mashed potatoes, whipped mashed potatoes, asparagus parmesan and buttery ccoked carrots from this site.

I thought it was just okay. I used a red wine for cooking only and I should have used "real wine" I think it would have come out better.

This recipe is both simple and delicious.  I am amazed at how easy it is and how good it tastes.  I used carrots in place of celery and it came out great.  I also used fresh garlic, just because I like the taste better.  A "crowd pleaser" at my house.

Our family are not big pork fans but we love this recipe. However, because I suffer from migraines and I never have red wine in the house I took a chance and made it the first time with white moscato. I've made it at least 6 or 8 times since then with various whites and can't find one we don't love. I do add 2 packets of brown gravy and it makes the perfect consistency for gravy for the mashed potatoes. Other than that I don't measure anything, I just eyeball as I cook. I do strain out most of the onions just because that's my personal preference but I leave the celery, again personal preference. I don't change anything else. Anytime I have made this for guests they think I've slaved in the kitchen for hours. Shhhh, our little secret. Give it a try. Really, you won't be sorry. After all, all these glowing reviews can't be wrong.

One of the best meals we have had in ages! Instead of the tenderloin, as some of the other reviewers suggested, I use a fresh pork roast, so increased the cook time, keeping a close eye on the meat thermometer. It was so unbelievably easy! Some reviews said it was too much wine, but I honestly think that comes down to your own flavor preference, because I actually used more, basting the roast three or four times by pouring a little more over the top while it cooked. And the only thing I would change is to use even more because serving 3 big guys that loved this gravy made it not go very far! I inserted 3 cloves of garlic inside the roast and that just complemented the whole flavor. Once that meat thermometer hit 160 I took it out and it was absolutely the most tender juiciest roast I've ever had.  I did sear it in oil and some garlic powder before cooking so it would be browned. Loved this so much and my guys are asking when I'm going to make it again. Thank you so much for sharing!

This pork was FABULOUS !!! After a few modifications such as: I seasoned the tenderloin with cracked pepper and garlic salt (had no garlic powder), then seared it in a smidge of hot olive oil. Then I poured one cup of Merlot red wine (Sutter Home), and one cup of low salt, fat free beef bouillon into the roasting dish (my baking dish is smaller than 9X13 and the roast that I made was slightly over 1 pound). Placed the roast in the pan, sliced 1 rib of celery into thirds - placed them on top of the roast, and thickly sliced 1/2 of a Vidalia onion - placed the slices on top and around the roast. Baked at 350' for 45 mins. Then to make the gravy - I used 1 packet of "Better Than Gravy" brand beef gravy, 1 cup of the pan juices (which was all there was incidentally), and 1/4 c water. I simmered this concoction in a small saucepan until thickened, added the onions from the roast pan (discarded the celery - I figured they were only for flavor anyhow), and served the roast sliced with the gravy over it. This was the BEST pork medallion that I have ever had !!! Even my finicky 10 y/o son ate it (with no gravy, but he still ate it !) This recipe was the BOMB and def. a keeper !!!  TY BROWNDOG ;-)

First time making a pork tenderloin and I'm glad this recipe displayed how easy it was. Upon reading a few of the previous reviews, I did sear the tenderloin prior and left out the onions and celery, only because I didn't have it on hand. I only had Chianti to use and since I know nothing about red wine or cooking with it, I figured I'd give it a try. I failed to see reviews of cutting the wine amount, but for future reference I'd definitely cut it in half. I had to use two gravy packets to counter the strong wine taste, although it didn't do much. I also added a tsp of cornstarch to thicken the gravy. The pork came out so tender, so I know I'll certainly enjoy it the next time with more seasoning and less wine. Thank you for posting and relieving my fear of difficulty w/ cooking pork!

I was disappointed.  Whilst the meat was very tender, the gravy was not good.   Too much wine taste for me.  I will try again, but will use only 3/4 of a cup or red wine.

This was ok.  First, it was VERY unattractive when prepared as written.  I'm sorry, but meat that has been braised without being browned first is just ugly.  I would highly recommend browning first, both for presentation and to give the meat that tasty crust.  The meat was tasty enough and stayed moist, but the flavor of the sauce overwhelmed everything else, so you really can't detect the flavor of the meat.  My biggest issue with this recipe was the sauce.  The directions for gravy mix tell you to add it to cold liquid then boil so the powder can blend without turning to lumps.  Since the liquid was very hot, almost boiling when I added the gravy mix, I got terrible lumps.  One packet of mix didn't even make a dent in the consistency, I needed 2 to thicken appropriately.  I tried to use a stick blender to eliminate the lumps (thus losing my nice onion chunks), but even that didn't work and I ended up having to strain the sauce to get the lumps out.  The sauce had good flavor but was pretty much just gussied up fake gravy.  This is great for a shortcut and for a meal on the quick, but if you are preparing for company, I would skip the gravy mix and add beef broth and just a regular flour/water paste to make your sauce.  My instructions to improve:  Brown tenderloin, brown onions, pour over 1 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth.  Bake until internal temperature reaches 160 - 165 for well done.  Remove tenderloin and set aside.  Thicken broth/wine with a flour & water paste.

This recipe was just not that great. As a professional chef, I rarely follow the recipes exactly but I did this time, with the exception of adding fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. First off, the meat really needs to be seared in olive oil if only for the eye appeal. Otherwise, it looks like a big purple glob of meat. Second, the gravy mix must be brought to a boil or it will not thicken. You can't just dump in the mix and stir.  Finally, I have to believe the brand of gravy mix used makes a big difference since so many people like this dish. I used a brand called Simply Organic.. bad aftertaste. I would try this dish again making the sauce with the wine/pan juices, chicken stock and a little demi (you can buy jars of it at Sur La Table...adds a lot of depth to sauces.)  Bottom line..this is easy to make and it tastes that way. It has potential though...

This is my first recipe review on this site and this was pretty good- but I did follow the other reviews and only used 1C red wine and 1C beef broth. For some reason I could still taste the powdery garlic powder so next time I'm just going to use regular garlic. I did need to use a bit of corn starch to get the sauce to thicken a bit since we are more gravy people than sauce people.

Wonderful taste and presentation - easy too. 
 
After removing the silver skin from the meat I brined the pork for one hour, covering meat with water mixed with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/8 cup of kosher salt. Brining assures the meat will be moist.
 
Based on reviews, I sauteed the loins, which I had lightly floured, in veg. oil.  Half-way through browning added the onions to the pan.(didn't use celery)  Deglazed the pan with a bit of wine. Saved onions and pan drippings, to put over meat before cooking, in separate bowl and refrigerated all until later that night. Also pre-quartered 2 cups of mushrooms.

Cooked meat on a handled rack which sat on the bottom of the pan to make for easy removal.  Like others, used half beef broth and half red wine.  Also used 2 packages of brown gravy mix.

Company loved it, gravy, with large pieces of mushroom, was dark brown, tasted wonderful over meat and was enough to pour over buttered herb noodles.  Everyone thought it was veal and were surprised when I told them in was much less expensive pork.

AWESOME!!! My husband loved it!  I mixed the seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder) before sprinkling on both sides of meat.   Instead of two cups of wine, I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 cup of red wine (not red wine vinegar). I omitted celery, but added the sliced onions on top.  Turned pork periodically during cooking.  Liquid cooked down, but didn't burn or run out.  Pork was VERY tender.  45 minutes was not enough time to cook pork.  I used a meat thermometer.  It baked for 1 hr and 20 minutes. I removed the pork, added the gravy package to the juice.  I sliced the pork and added it back to the gravy and let it marinate in the oven while I finished preparing other dinner sides.

I admit, I was a little skeptical of how tender this could be and if a  recipe under "healthy living" could be that great. Skeptics be assured! It is FANTASTIC! Great flavor, extremely tender. I added sliced mushrooms to the mix (really adds to the gravy) and rubbed crushed garlic to the top (I don't like powder). The gravy packet has a lot of sodium so I didn't add any salt, which is good because it would have been salty if I did. I also love the fact that there is no butter or oil added! This is definately going in the permenant collection!

This tenderloin was AWESOME!  I cut the wine by one cup and added beef broth.  I also browned the meat first in shallots and garlic.  It was excellent and freezes really well.

Save the Burgundy for BEEF!
This didn't taste bad just "different".
--Seaoning on the meat=excellant
--Per other reviews used 1 c. Burgundy 1 c. Beef broth final result tasted to "beefy" next time would use ALL wine
--Omited celery used mushrooms instead...onion added no flavor and mushrooms were rubbery if used again would saute slightly first and make sure they were covered with wine when baking.
--Brown gravy/wine sauce was actually very tasty itself.

I think this is the first 5 star recipe that has disappointed me.  I followed the suggestions of others and used half beef broth and I used merlot wine.  I think one of the things I didn't care for was the packet of pork gravy.  I've NEVER used packaged or bottled gravy in my life and it definately had a "different" taste.  You could smell the difference!  Smelled like cheap diner food.  Other than that, there was really nothing wrong with this recipe, I just can't see what all the excitement is about.  Pork tenderloin is always tender no matter what you do to it. It's the cut of meat.  I'll stick with my old way and stuff cloves of garlic with romano cheese and sweet basil into the pork.  Nothing easier or better than that and nothing has the aroma or makes better gravy!!!

I tried this with bone-in country style pork ribs.  As usual I'm trying to make dinner with what I have on hand.  I had these country ribs and wine.  So I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and browned them well in olive oil.  I mixed only about 1 cup of wine with 1/2 cup of water with fresh minced garlic and dried minced onion and poured that over the top.  After I got all this going in the oven I realized I didn't have any brown gravy mix.  So I sauteed some mushrooms in butter, added flour and beef boullion and when the pork was done added the wine and drippings to that with some water and cornstarch because it was really strong.  Turned out great.  The meat was so tender and really didn't taste like wine; neither did the gravy.  I don't like recipes that use "mushroom soup" so this was excellent.

This recipe is awesome!  I also added mushrooms and used 2 packages of gravy mix.  The gravy is thin, but delicious!  If you think you'd like it thicker, corn starch should do the trick.  Thanks for this great recipe!   I can't wait to impress someone with it.  :)

Burgundy Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "No need to brown first. Tender, great the way it is. (Added some mushrooms.)" I would normally consider searing a pork tenderloin b4 putting in the oven, but went w/ the recipe as written, except adding mushrooms, along w/ halving the wine and subbing beef broth. This couldn't have been easier to put together, and came out tasting so wonderfully elegant! The wine/gravy/vegg mix from on top of the pork tasted outstanding spooned over mashed potatoes. Can't wait to make this again!

This tasted good. Maybe it was just me but the color of the gravy was a little off putting but it was delicious.

I never knew dried gravy mix could be so good.  When it combines with the wine and the juice from the meat, it just WORKS.  I used a merlot and had a glass with it.  It turned out very good.  Will be making this again.

This was my first time making a pork tenderloin. I used 1 cup of wine and one cup water. I added canned mushrooms and did everything else as followed. The gravy wouldn't thicken so I added another packet and it still didn't. I will try again next time. It still taste great! My kids loved it and so did my picky husband. The house also smelled really nice while it was cooking. We really LOVED it!

I really wanted to give this one 5 stars but we loved the Kalamata Pork Tenderloin recipe even more.  This is a simple, quick, tasty recipe.  I did have to cook it for about 10 minutes longer than called for - might be my oven.  I found the onions baked up a bit crunchy, being on top of the pork tenderloin, so next time I would just lay them beside the meat and this way they would soak up some of the liquid.  I only used one pound so halved everything, including using half a package of gravy mix.  Would work well for company.

Wow! Keeper! I did follow the recommendations and skipped the onion and celery; I used onion powder and celery salt instead. I did buy 2 packets of sauce and used 1½ to thicken the sauce. Cooked the pork to 140 and let it rest 10 minutes. Delish!

This was a wonderful recipe. Very flavorful. I really don't like the purple outer coating that the wine gives to the meat, however.The pork was a tad on the dry side, although I covered with foil for the last 10 minutes. In spite of my concerns over color, this is a very good recipe. Probably could have used two envelopes of brown gravy as others suggested, but I didn't have a second one available.Thanks Kathleen.

The wine flavor was a little strong, But overall the meat was tender and tasty, so next time I'll use half wine, half beef broth.

Where did I go wrong? I made this dish a week ago and the dish is still soaking, don't use glass. The wine dried out fast and burned, and I had no drippings, do you have drippings with tenderloin? It took a lot longer to cook than recommended as should pork. However the meat was good. Could be my fault.

I've fixed this recipe before - absolutely wonderful. Today I fixed it in the crockpot - I wouldn't recommend doing that-although it smelled fantastic, the meat turned out drier and not nearly as flavorful. Fix it the way it was meant to be!

We eat a lot of Pork Tenderloin and have a tough time locating new recipes. This one was just wonderful! In fact I'm making it for dinner tonight! I would suggest replacing the brown gravy powder with either flour or starch. The gravy powder took away from the great taste of the onions, red wine and pork juices.

The recipe directions are different than if you watch the video. The video directions make more sense as the gravy will actually thicken. I also browned the tenderloin before placing it in the oven to help seal in the flavor. Overall, very good.

This recipe was fabulous without any changes.  Unlike what some other reviewers had indicated, I didn't find the gravy to be overly wine tasting, in fact, I thought the gravy was incredible as is.  I used a Cabernet Sauvignon in the dish and with the brown gravy mix it was incredible.  I even saved the leftover gravy for dipping bread the next day.  Highly recommended.

You cannot find a more delicious, "idiot proof" recipe on this entire site. Have made many times and there are rarely any leftovers. Great with mashed potatoes, rice, and risotto. Usually have either string beans, broccoli or asparagus with this. Awesome recipe!

Omg I LOVED this meal!  Absolutely loved it!  I cooked a 4 pound pork loin versus the 2 pound, so it lasted several meals.  I also didn't add the onion or celery (because I didn't feel like going to the store lol) so I simply added a little onion powder to the meat while seasoning it.

I also did a cup of beef broth instead of a gravy packet, then added a bit of corn starch mixed with water to it to thicken it a bit.  Turned out great!  Served with mashed potatoes, the sauce went wonderfully with it!

I doused my meat and mashed potatoes with the juices and it was soooo good - my husband, on the other hand, hates any kind of gravy or broth, so he didn't add any of the juices to his plate after he got his meat out, but he loved it as well  It's my new favorite recipe!

Very good.  I omitted the onion and celery and added mushrooms instead.  I used Valpolicella as my red wine.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I want to try using just 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of beef broth since so many people have recommended that change and it will also leave me with more wine to serve with dinner :)  It was fine with 1 package of gravy but I think 2 would put this recipe over the top.  I served this with "Garlic Mashed Secret Recipe" and "Pan-Fried Asparagus" from allrecipes.  What an easy and delicious dinner!

Very good and easy. A good way to get rid of that cheap Trader Joe red wine that we've accumulated too much of. Perfect dish to cook while I'm at the gym (use the timer to turn on the oven and come home to a finished dinner).

I thought it was okay but my husband LOVED it.  I just wasn't thrilled with the wine taste.  Tasted a little dryer than I enjoy but turned out good.  If you like red wines, give it a try.

I followed the recipe, except that I added mushrooms, and I didn't make gravy at the end because a) I didn't have gravy mix and b) my husband and I enjoy "jus," so I decided to leave it as is. I found it very simple to do and tasted pretty good. Next time I will add more herbs - I think sprigs of fresh rosemary or thyme would be delicious with this, especially with the red wine, which I'll also reduce the amount of since there was so much at the end. I'll definitely be making this again - thanks for a good, simple, and quick dinner recipe!

So, so good! I will be making this once a week. Definitely pick up a cheap jug of burgundy to use. The resulting sauce/gravy is delicious! I did marinate the tenderloins in some EVOO with a ton of minced garlic before cooking, but other than that stuck to the recipe as written. Super easy dinner -- pair with some kind of potatoes and a green vegetable. Phenomenal!!!

Definately 5 stars. This recipe is so easy and tastes great.  I have looked for a recipe that would give pork tenderloin a better flavor and this is it!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe!! So easy to prepare. It only takes about 10 mins to get ready and put in the oven. 
I just want to mention if you like your meat cooked all the way through, 45 mins is not long enough. I cooked my pork covered for 2 hours and the meat just fell appart it was so tender! My husband is not a huge fan of wine either so if you don't like the wine taste just cut it in half and sub the other cup with beef broth. The gravy turns out delicious! My hubby loves it!

The sauce was nice and easy (use Lawry's brown gravy mix if you can find it), but the pork was WAY overdone.  I have another pork tender recipe that I frequently cook in the oven for 18 minutes @ 450 degrees F to an internal temperature of 155F, and it's always cooked perfectly.  This is a good recipe, but I have others that suit our tastes better, so I'm not sure I'll make this again.

I actually combined two recipes from this site - this along with 'roasted pork loin'.  I used a pork loin roast, made a paste of crushed garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper and made slits throughout the roast for the paste.  I rubbed it with some olive oil and then followed this recipe with onion and the burgundy wine.  I had to add some water to the leftover wine in the pan to make the gravy.  It was superb~  served with roasted potatoes/sweet potatoes.

I'm in the camp that found the wine taste WAY too overpowering.....and I enjoy cooking with wine.  My kids didn't care for it either but my husband raved.  I will probably try it again but substitute half the wine with beef or chicken broth and try another reviewer's suggestion of using Knorr pork gravy mix.  I have to say the meat was gloriously tender and juicy, so worth another try with modifications.

I've made this a number of times (exactly as directed) and my family loves it! The pork is always tender and cooked perfectly, and the gravy is delicious. We love it with mashed potatoes, but it would probably also go great with buttered noodles.

Wine flavor too strong, and I love wine.  When it comes to gravy packets, the Knorr 1.3 oz pork gravy worked great and thickened just fine.

Have made this several times since finding the recipe and it is AMAZING!  For the packet of gravy mix, I use the Knorr Hunter gravy.  Have made for us, and for company and all love it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I seared the meat with olive oil and then placed in a crockpot on low for 4 hours with portabello mushrooms instead of onion and celery. I also used 1/2 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth.  It was excellent!  Very tender.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We don't care for the taste of red wine, so i used 2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine vinegar.  Excellent recipe!  I can't wait to try it again.

What an easy elegant dish!  I made a few alterations and it turned out fabulous! I omitted the onion and celery and substituted mushrooms.  I also used two packets of gravy instead of one (one brown gravy mix and one mushroom gravy mix). It's one of the best dishes I ever made! Everyone asked for the recipe!

I'd give this 5 stars, but we are not particularly fond of packaged mixes.  Here is our rendition. We browned the pork before putting in the oven.  We put a couple of sprigs of rosemary in with the wine while it cooked.  This was fantastic and made the house smell heavenly.  We added a can of beef broth (instead of brown gravy mix) and simmered until reduced by about 1/2.  We served it over buttered egg noodles.  Fantastic!  Thanks.

This was really good, but I will be making some changes next time.  I will saute the pork in some EVOO before baking.  I think I will also omit the onions and celery...it didn't do anything for the flavor and I had to strain the "gravy" before thickening.  The wine flavor was too overpowering so I did end up adding about 3/4 c. of water.  I will add some mushrooms next time too.  I think it will go well.  Thanks for the post.

Very good! I think the type of wine you use can really make a difference. A nice Pinot Noir from the west coast will work, or a cheaper bottle of french wine for those who didn't know the difference between burgandy and others. It needs more than just any "red wine". I also prefer it with the mushrooms that everyone else suggested. Guests rave!

This recipe is AWESOME. Instead of adding the onions during the baking of the pork, I slice my onions and simmer them on a skillet separately.  I then place the caramelized onions on top of the loan. Also, I substituted 1 cup of wine with 1 cup of beef broth. Perfect. This recipe is so simple yet so complex tasting!

MOIST, MOIST, MOIST!!!! We love pork of any kind, make it often hence I thought I had it down to a science of my roasts being moist.  HELLO!!  While we were eating this and I was hearing the raves of it flavor and moistness - hardly needed a knife I kept thinking "Is it this recipe or did I just buy the greatest piece of pork in the world???"  I am going to make it again next week to find out.  The reason I only gave it four stars was because of the gravy - it had a wine/beef flavor that was good - but when I'm eating pork I really don't want to taste beef in my gravy.  I am going to use packaged pork gravy mix next week.  Everyone enjoyed it though and that is the ONLY thing I will change in the recipe.  I did end up cooking the roast at 400 degrees for 20 min. first to let it brown a bit, especially on the bottom so the scrapings would mix into the gravy - then reduced it to recommend temp. and then poured the wine in - don't omit the onions!!!!  Pretty presentation and I thank you Kathleen for sharing - I've raked up a lot of recipes from this site, but at this moment it goes into my #1 rating for moistness in pork!!!

DELICIOUS!!! My husband said he could eat this at least 3 nights a week. I used Holland House red cooking wine and I used (2) packets of McCormick pork gravy mix.  I served this with "green beans with bread crumbs"(another allrecipes favorite of mine)and mashed potatoes.

Wow!  Meat came out so moist and tender!  I too seared the meat and used 1/2 wine 1/2 chicken broth.  The gravy is a little salty though, I would thin it out more with water...you definitely need the gravy though, it gives the meat a different flavor.  Thanks for submitting.

This is delicious!  I followed a couple of suggestions from previous posters - used 1 c of burgundy and 1 c of beef broth.  I also seared the meat in olive oil prior to baking.  Sauce is great on mashed potatoes.  Was quick and easy enough to prepare for a weekday meal.

Excellent recipe. Mix brown gravy powder with water before adding to wine/veg. mixture.  I used carrots and onions and just spooned the whole thing over top of the tenderloin. Next time I will add mushrooms.  It was wonderful.  Definitely a keeper; and would be great to serve to company.

This is the best recipe I've tried from this website so far.  I only used one loin which weighed about 1 lb and used 1 1/4 c. red wine for the sauce. The wine reduced and I only had to use 1 package of gravy mix.  The gravy was rich and tasty. I cooked the loin using a meat thermometer for an internal temp of 170 which took about 1 hour.  This recipe is good enough to serve for a special occasion.  Thanks!!

This was an excellent recipe.  There was a drawback though---the extra wine.  I used 1 1/4 cups of white wine, 1/2 cup water, 2 tbl of cornstarch & a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I had to use some water to cut some of the "winey" taste. i omitted the pkg of brown gravy mix.  I WENT TO WORK & BRAGGED ON THIS MEAL!!! PLEASE TRY!!.

The recipe says it should be cooked for 45 minutes at 350, but when I went to take it out of the oven it wasn't cooked through!  So, I upped the temp to about 400 and cooked for another 25 minutes.  Wow... it was soooo good.  (It was even better as leftovers a day later!)  My little brother who is 16 happen to be visiting and he loved it as well.  
I would say this is a great dish to try... especially if you don't typically eat pork.  It is so tender and so flavorful. Simply perfect.

Super easy and fast!  Juicy and awesome as leftovers.  Added a couple sprigs of rosemary and thyme to the wine. Skipped the celery.  45 minutes cook time was perfect, even for 2.5 lbs pork.

My husband and I liked it, my two young children did not. I used one cup of red wine and one cup of broth as well. I do agree that it would be yummier to use two packets of gravy and will try that the next time I make it.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly (otherwise I'd give it 5!). I hate reviewing recipes that I don't actually follow, but I didn't have enough wine so I improvised a bit :) I put in one cup of wine (petite shiraz...again, improv) and 1 cup of beef broth from a bouillon cube. I didn't have onion or celery, so I put in some dried minced onion (though I don't think it made a difference) and 2 packets of gravy.
This was delicious!  And I'm such a beginner at this stuff and I hate making pork because it's always dry and something always goes awry. But this was the best pork I've ever made. Thank you!

I subbed in beef broth for 1 cup of the wine.  It still had a heavy wine taste.  The gravy mix just clumped when added to the liquid, so it didn't really add any flavor. I seared the meat before cooking it, and it definitely stayed moist.  I think I'd make this again, but reduce the wine even more and just season and thicken it myself, rather than use the gravy mix.  It was just ok as is.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, I'm reading through the reviews now to see how great this really is. And its hard to get any knowledge of true results, when so many reviewers have CHANGED almost EVERYTHING about THIS recipe!!!!! Sure, I understand you want to share what you did, and your results of cooking time is super helpful, BUT if you change the seasonings/ the gravy/ basically everything, YOU ARE NOT BEING A HELPFUL REVIEWER!!!! All you are doing is confusing everyone, ifyou think your changes are so great (and you've changed everything) then go make it a brand NEW RECIPE!! You are making it hard for US to know if THIS recipe worked!!!!!! Thank you :-)

AMAZING!!!! I just used celery salt and onion seasoning as per the other reviews. I seasoned it befored I pan seared it to lock in the flavors and again lightly seasoned before baking.  I had to use two packets of brown gravy for the sauce to thicken enough.  I also had to cook it for an hour.  Other than that it was fabulous and sooooo easy I will definitely be making it again!!!!!!

This recipe is great!  I've made it twice now for two different groups of people and it has come out juicy and flavorful for both. There are 3 deviations from the recipe I do 1.  I sear the seasoned roast in butter/oil before I but it in the oven.  2. I use half wine half chicken/beef broth so it cuts down on the wine taste and makes it more palatable to people that don't like red wine and 3. instead of adding the gravy packets to the remaining liquid, I just take a cup of the juice and add it to the gravy packet in a sauce pan (2 cups if I'm doubling the recipe).  It seems to thicken better this way. 

It's fun to play with different veggies for this recipe too! I've thrown in potatoes, carrots etc and they all come out delicious!

Love this recipe as is. I made no changes and it comes out so flavorful and tender. However, if someone doesn't like red wine they aren't going to like this dish as the wine is noticeable, and in my opinion is what makes it so tasty.

Amazing. So simple, and so delicious. We all loved it, especially my 10yo and 3yo. They devoured it. I used a thermometer and took it out at 140 degress (it rose another 5 or so while it rested). This made the pork very moist and just the slightest bit pinkish (hardly noticeable to my kids) Made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy and we were in heaven. I used a pinot noir instead of Burgundy since I couldn't find it at the grocery store, for some reason.

Disappointing. It was tender, but that's why it's called tenderloin, and it was not too dry... but it tasted like "buffet" food. I'm giving it an extra star because my husband liked it.

This was great and easy and fast!  I did sear the meat and added pearl onions.  I also half cooked carrots and added to meat & wine/broth mixture.  Yummy! with mashed potatoes.  Excellent meal.  Will definitely do again!  Thank you for the tips.

Quite good! will make again but when I stirred in the gravy mix into the hot wine and drippings it did not thicken. Put a little more mix in, still not thick... Poured into a small pan and boiled, it then thickened. The extra gravy mix made it more salty though, still very good.

This recipe came out perfectly! The burgundy really brings out the flavors of the pork. I wasn't able to salvage the leftover liquid for a sauce though, the wine I used was just too bitter for our tastes. Best served, as others have suggested, with skin-on mashed potatoes and a veggie side.

It was okay.  Neither my husband or I are big pork fans, so that may be part of the reason we didn't enjoy it that much.  However, I just didn't find this to be flavorful.  The pork was very tender and juicy, but it just didn't have enough flavor.

This was a really easy recipe to follow. I added some sauteed mushrooms to the mix of celery and onion too. My husband thought that the dish tasted too strongly of wine though, so at first I was disappointed. But then we found that the sauce reheated very well the next day as leftovers, somehow lost its sour bite, and soaked in much nicer into the meat. I will do this again, but next time may try toning down the wine sauce with a little bit of chicken broth.

Not sure where I went wrong, but it really wasn't that great.  And I didn't get a gravy out of it!  I used a 2lb tenderloin (too much for 3 of us), 2c. leftover pinot noir (others have recommended burgundy wine and only 1c.), and 1 packet of gravy mix.  It never thickened to make gravy.  So although the pork was very tender, it didn't have much flavor since there was nothing to pour over it.  Maybe I'll try it again with less wine...

Very tasty and so simple.  I left out the celery just because I didn't have any; and after reading many reviews did 1.5 c red wine (couldn't find burgundy?) and .5 c beef broth.  Also used a pork dry gravy mix at the end.  Yum.

Kinda bland in my opinion.  Followed as written except I seared the meat before hand and added  sauteed mushrooms to the gravy.  Didn't do anything for me. Sorry folks.

This was great.  I used one cup burgandy and 1 cup beef stock as per others' suggestions.  the pork was perfectly done in 45 minutes.  Instead of the brown gravy mix I just poured off the cooking liquid (about 1+ cup) and stirred in a tbsp. of corm starch mixed with a little water and microwaved until gravy-like consistency.

Excellent recipe. I used half the wine and it was plenty rich! I used boneless pork, not the loin, and it was very tender and tastey. I will keep this one handy!

I thought this was a great weeknight recipe - it was quick and easy! I followed it almost exactly, except I took a hint from another reviewer and cut back the wine (I used Pinot Noir) to 1-1/2c and added 1/2c beef broth. Then I cooked down the juices at bit more on the stovetop after adding the gravy. My husband loved it so it's definitely a recipe I'll keep!

Fabulous! I added a bit more seasoning to the meat, but used all the same ingredients. I also took the advice of some the reviews and doubled the gravy. This turned out delicious! Will definitely make again!

I used organic gluten free golden gravy packet and thickened with about 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. Gluten free never tasted so good!

I followed the recipe exactly and just didn't think it was anything special.  Very simple to make but the flavor was just ok for us.  Probably won't make it again.

Probably the MOST TENDER AND EASIEST Tenderloin we've had.  You could seriously cut it with a fork.  Used fresh garlic and the powder too (love that stuff in any form!); Skipped the celery, but added mushrooms; Used 1 can beef broth and just a cup of a nice deep burgandy -- but could've used more.  Used 2 gravy packets and because of the added broth, gravy was still pretty thin.  Only thing I'll try different next time is marinating the meat for an hour or 2 in the wine/broth and seasonings before roasting.  Nice presentation, even with the unbrowned meat.  Yummy.

THis was great.  Nice flavours.  Thanks everyone for the great recommendations - did 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth, mushrooms at the end and thickened on the stove with only 1/2 gracy packet to ensure it didn't get too salty.  These changes made it taste fantastic.  Might even try a dash of rosemary and brandy in the gravy at the very end. Yumm - tender meat and nice flavour. Goes great with the rosemary roasted potatoes someone suggested.

Oh my - this was the single most delicious thing my husband has ever cooked for me (I passed along the recipe to him since I was working late.)  He said it was just "pretty good", but I'm going to disavow his review since he's obviously brain-damaged for not recognizing this as the most scrumptious piece of pork to ever grace a dinner table. Ok - so maybe I'm prone to hyperbole, but it was  good.  He made it exactly as directed, but it needed to cook a bit longer.  We had it with mashed potatoes, and the gravy was EXCELLENT on them.   Yum, yum, yum.  And yum.

This recipe will now be in the dinner rotation! Possibly the best pork I have ever made. The ONLY thing I did different was use thick loin chops, because I it was what I had on hand. My son, who really doesn't like meat, ate it in less than 5 minutes

The sauce was excellent.  As other reviews suggested, it would be good to add another packet of gravy.  The celery is completely unneccessary, and adds nothing to the dish.  I suggest bell peppers and mushrooms, but you can sautee that separately and add it at the end.  My veggies didn't look right when all was said and done with.

I liked this recipe although I gave it a 4 because I think there was too much wine for the gravy. I put in a packet like instructed and mixed it up hoping for it to thicken but it didn't. I told my bf oh well, its not exactly a gravy but he was like thats ok its like an au jus lol. I don't really like pork very much either but I think this dressed it up a bit. It also reminds me a little of Beef Bourignon without the beef lol. I think my pork days are over but still it was pretty tasty despite the the gravy.

I enjoyed this.  The problem isn't with the pork but with the gravy.  One packet of brown gravy hardly did anything.  Definitely needed 2.  The flavor was excellent and it took the pork an additional 10 minutes to get to 165 degrees.  Added portabella mushrooms to the veggies and I thought it was delicious.  Also, browned the pork first as other reviewers suggested.  Would make again...just with one more packet of brown gravy.

Tender, juicy, tasty...exceptionally good.  My children loved it, my husband loved it, I loved it. I used celery seed since I had no celery and minced garlic since I had no garlic salt.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  I'm making it for 12 people tomorrow night, as it is the perfect "show off" entree to serve.  We're having baby red potatoes and garlic roasted string beans on the side.  Thanks so much for this delightful dish, Browndog!

This recipe is full proof. Every time I make it, I get rave reviews. I feel a little guilty because it is so simple. I follow the recipe to a T and it turns out perfectly every single time. The whole house smells fabulous while this is cooking. It can be glammed up with some decadent sides or simply served with mashed potatoes.

Got to invite someone over for dinner soon, because this is definitely company fare -- not that it isn't fine for just the wife and me (although that requires cutting it in half, and still leaves leftovers.    When I served it, my wife said, "Oh, that looks so good." When she tasted it, she said, "Tastes good, too; really good. This is a keeper."     So easy, too.    Browned tenderloin in skillet before putting in oven, and added mushrooms, as another reviewer suggested, and it wasn't nearly done after 45 minutes; needed about 15 minutes more.

I cooked as suggested but added 3/4 cup sliced mushrooms.  Also, I used Lambrusco since that was the only red wine I had and wouldn't use that wine again.  I wish I had known about the burgandy wine before I made this.  I'm sure using the right wine must make a huge difference.  It was still a very quick and easy recipe I would make again.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  It's foolproof, and so so delicious.  I left out the onion & celery since I didn't really see how they would add much to the gravy, and included some onion powder to season the pork.  Absolutely wonderful and easy enough to make on a weeknight.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I thought this came out really well, but I made a beginner's mistake. I decided to double the gravy recipe. The pork ended up almost entirely submerged in the wine. It ended up taking MUCH longer to cook, like an extra hour. I liked having extra gravy, so if I make this again, I will just plan on cooking it a lot longer than the recipe says. I also added some sliced fresh mushrooms to the liquid with the onions and celery, and they were delicious. I served with mashed potatoes and a side of maple-glazed carrots (from this Web site).

the whole family loved this.  it was super easy to make, too.  i used an extra lean loin, but it was still pretty tender.  i didn't use the celery because i don't like it, but i added a bay leaf.  as others suggested, i seared the loins on both sides before putting them in the baking dish, and i used half beef broth and half red cooking wine, since that's what i had on hand.  i wished i had added a little more broth after i added the gravy mix, because it was so thick it wouldn't pour nicely.  the gravy had a good flavor, but even using low sodium gravy mix, i felt it was too salty.  next time i'll use low sodium beef broth as well.  overall, very yummy!

Fantastic! Here are my modifications. I'm making this many times over, I'm sure. Used about half merlot and half burgundy b/c that's what I had was open. Left out the garlic powder and instead used 3 cloves crushed garlic. Also put on about a half bulb of crushed fennel. I'm not a big fan of gravy from a mix, so I put about 1/2 cup water, about 2 Tbsp flour, about 1 Tbsp chicken bullion, about 1 Tbsp beef bullion in a pot, heated and stirred to thicken. Then added 1 box sliced baby bella mushrooms, covered to cook for about 8 minutes. Strained the drippings / wine from the meat into the pot, heated, and served. Super recipe, thanks!

Excellent flavor. I used a few tblsp of cornstarch with cold water in place of the gravy mix.  Also, took others' suggestions and used 1/2 wine, 1/2 beef broth.  The absolute ease of prep makes this a 5 star!

I was going to give this 2 stars - but I'm sorry... it's not that good. I don't get all of the rave reviews. I followed the recipe. The cooking time is WAY off. 45 minutes is not long enough. The pork not that flavorful. The sauce was ridiculously salty. I guess people are far too generous with the stars on this site. This is not a 5 star meal by any means. Hubby said it was 'ok'. I said PASS.

This was really really good! Our gravy came out more like a dark broth, not thick like the picture, but we loved it anyway! The only thing I'll change is that next time, we will leave out the celery, because it just didn't add much and I had to buy a whole bag just to get one stalk!

This recipe not only gets 5 stars for the fantastic taste, but also for the ease of it. I will be sharing this recipe with everyone! Thank you for my favorite new pork tenderloin recipe! For people who like more gravy - double the wine/gravy mixture. I served it over mashed potatoes with the main dish. The only change I made was that I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. My family loved it!

I rarely throw anything away, but this sauce went in the trash!  The wine taste was too overpowering even though I used a good Cabernet.  Will not make this again!

Great recipe. Used other reviewer's suggestions: seasoned & seared a 1 1/4 lb tenderloin, and used half wine, half beef broth. Omitted celery. Used my PC meat thermometer & meat hit 160 degrees right about 45 mins. Using a good quality gravy mix makes a difference - I like the Knorr brand. My final touch to temper the somewhat sharp taste of the sauce was to whisk a lg tbsp. of lite sour cream into the gravy just before serving. The kids and husband loved it, even the onion-hating son (as long as he didn't have to eat chunks!) Tasty, easy recipe good enough for company.

Very yummy.  I used this recipe for a beef roast (cooked in the crock pot on low for 6 hours).  I omitted the celery...added potatoes/carrots and used three brown gravies.  My kids loved it (even my picky 6 year old)...:)

WOW! With a few alternate steps this is worthy of 5 stars for 2 reasons. One - it is quick and secondly it tastes delicious. I did dredge the pork loin in flour and pan sear it while I used fresh ground pepper and garlic powder. I skipped the salt since there is enough salt in the gravy mix and beef stock. Having said that I used a nice pinot noir wine and a 1/2 cup of beef stock (I prepared this for 2 people using a 1.4lb tenderloin). I put this in the oven for 1 hour then removed from the baking dish and added a 1/2 packet of gravy mix. I added some corn starch to thicken. That's it! A terrific sauce and a very tender tenderloin!!

This was Great! I rubbed the crushed pepper and sea salt on the tenderloin.  Pan-seared the loins until they were brown.  I transfered them to the baking dish and pourd the rest of the ingredients over them.  YUM! Also, I used fresh garlic.

Absolutely delicious, this sauce was the closest I've ever gotten to one tasting like it was from a restaurant.  My dinner guests were very impressesd.  Only thing was it took 1.5 hrs to cook (not 45 min), and that was after turning the temp up to 375 then 400 for most of the time.

This was the first time I made pork tenderloins and I thought this recipe was very easy to make and it looked great.  The only thing I would do different is use less wine.  The pork had too much of a wine taste.  Also, just as others had recommended, I used sliced mushrooms rather than the celery.

This is a great pork tenderloin recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars since I did deviate at the suggestion of others.  Using 1 c. of red wine and 1 c. of beef broth made the dish flavorful, but highlighted the meat instead of the wine.  I enjoy cooking with wine, but really feel like 2 c. would overwhelm the pork.  Overall an outstanding recipe that I will definately make again and again!

This was nothing special.  The pork was tender, but none of us liked the gravy. Will not waste another pork tenderloin. It is just not for us, I guess.

I thought that the red wine/gravy combo with pork sounded odd, but decided to try it based on the reviews.  Should have went with my instinct. I did not enjoy this at all.

This has turned out very tasty each time I've made it. I cook it in a smaller casserole dish, to keep the onions from drying out. I also reserve the liquid and add corn starch to thicken it as an as jus. Goes REALLY well with roasted garlic mashed red potates and roasted asparagus. YUM!

I am a very inexperienced cook, but this recipe was extremely easy. It doesn't take a particularly stocked kitchen or any fancy utensils, so I highly recommend it for any young, poor college students ( ;) ) looking to make an impressive meal.

A truly delicious dish! I took the advice of others and omitted the celery, used 1 cup wine (1/4 c red, 3/4 c white) and 1 cup beef broth, and added sliced mushrooms along with the onion. I increased the gravy mix to 2 packages, but I think 1 package would have been fine - it was a little too "processed" tasting with 2. I left out the added salt, since the packaged gravy mix had plenty. The pork was tender and delicious, and the wine flavor of the gravy was still quite strong (quite delicious!). The mushrooms were a perfect compliment to the pork. A very sophisticated tasting dish, it's definitely going to have a high profile in my recipe box!

After reading all the posts, I tried this recipe with a little hesitancy but I'm here to say it was wonderful! I took the suggestions to use half beef boullion, to rub the meat with the seasonings (no salt) and then to marinate in the wine mix for an hour before sauteing and then baking. Our piece wasn't really large so I baked it in a 9x9 pan and was surprised to find that much of the liquid evaporated during the cooking. Had to add water to the liquid to make the gravy. The meat turned out moist and very tasty.

My husband and I recently had a discussion about how we just aren't pork fans. But I keep looking for a great recipe to change that. And this one fits the bill. I used 1 cup of chianti and one cup of beef broth. I also rubbed the tenderloin with Montreal Steak Season. I also left out the celery and put slivers of garlic in the meat. This was so tender and juicy. I always seem to find bland, dry recipes. This I will definitly make again. Thanks so much for a quick and delicious recipe.

I felt there were several things wrong with this dish:  1.  Unless you sautee your onion/celery first - they will be quite crunchy, 2.  The wine taste is overwhelming - and doesn't mix well with the celery, in my opinion.  3.  No matter what you add to make the gravy - it will probably clash with the wine.     So - -    Perhaps I will use this general idea - by putting some red onions & mushrooms that have been sauteed in 3/4 cup SWEET white wine (and salted butter & seasonings) in a baking dish with the pork (NO celery!!) - perhaps that would achieve what this recipe tried, but failed to deliver.  Thanks anyway.

Wow!  Great recipe.  I had two pork tenderloin roasts which weighted about 1.2 pounds each.  Folded ends under on both small ends of the tenderloin so that they wouldn't dry out while cooking, then layered the two roasts to make one large roast.  Worked perfectly.  45 minutes gave me a medium rare roast.  Perfect.  I didn't have brown gravy mix packet so used a packet of chicken gravy mix instead.  Worked great!  The only thing that I would do differently next time, would be to NOT add the half teaspoon of salt.  The packaged mixes are quite salty already and you don't need the extra salt you get when you rub the spices into the roast.  This recipe was both quick and easy.  What more could you ask for?

We enjoyed this dish and will make it again.  My husband said this is a keeper.  The pork was fork tender and very tasty.  The only thing I did different was I added 1/2 cup of water to the gravy mix. For two people this recipes makes a lot (we froze half of it)!  I will try halving the recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my father-in-law's birthday dinner and everybody loved it! My husband is STILL talking about it.  I found the one packet of gravy mix to not be enough to thicken the juices into a gravy, so I used 1 1/2.  Would definitely make again!

Like others, I found that the cooking time needed to be a lot longer.  My pork loin was just barely over 2 lbs & it took 1 hr & 20 min to reach 160 degrees.  By that time almost all of the wine had evaporated.  The roast was tender and had good flavor & I will definitely try this again, but next time I will keep adding water & or wine as needed.

This is really good, but I did mine in the crockpot rather than the oven.  I cut an onion in thin rings & pressed three cloves of garlic & put the onions & garlic in a fry pan with about a tablespoon of olive oil.  I salted & peppered the pork, then browned it on all sides.  Once the pork was browned, I put everything into the crock pot & poured the two cups of wine over it.  I cooked it on high for a couple hours, then on low for two more hours.  Once the pork was done, I removed it & dumped the wine broth & onions into a medium saucepan & added a packet of pork gravy & a packet of brown gravy.  (You really need to use two packets of gravy to get the gravy to thicken b/c there is a lot of liquid left when you do it in the crock pot.)  I boiled it until it thickned, stirring constantly.  The pork was not very flavorful, but very juicy, which is okay b/c the gravy is fabulous & there is plenty to pour on both the pork & mashed potatoes.  I will probably try this recipe with a beef roast, too.  It's very easy & the gravy tastes like something you'd have in a good French restaurant.

Turned out very good. I used no veggies - just sprinkled mixed herb seasoning over roast. Used 
1 1/2 c red burgundy wine and 1 c water but would skip water next time and use only 2 c wine. After roast was done, I finished the gravy by adding 2 jars Heinz pork gravy and added a bit more wine to intensify the gravy flavor. After carving the roast, I kept it hot in the crockpot and poured some of the gravy over it to keep it moist. Definitely a keeper!

Didn't like it at all. The onions don't even cook the right way. Also I didn't think the celery goes with it.

I made this for Christmas dinner and what a delicious meal!  Everyone raved over the flavor, and how tender the meat was--you could cut it with a fork!  I used cornstarch to thicken the gravy and did not use the brown gravy mix. The gravy was the best.  Someone else reviewed this and suggested flour or cornstarch instead.  Great tip! I served it with Green Beans with bread crumbs (an allrecipe.com recipe), baked potatoes and a caesar salad.  Just delicious.  Had to cook it for 1 1/2 hours- I cooked 5 lbs. worth of meat.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks,Kathleen,for sharing ;-)

Wow!  My husband who doesn't like pork or wine really liked this recipie.  Thank you so much for a wonderful meal.  We also added mushrooms.  It did require an hour to cook and we'll probably use a little less wine next time.  He was impressed.

Great recipe. I made this recipe with just one cup wine and one cup water because I wasn't sure if my kids would like it, but it came out great! Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.

Super easy recipe. For my version, I used 1 1/2 cups of a Malbec since it was on hand- and a 1/2 cup of beef broth. I added mushrooms to the onions. My tenderloin was much larger so I cut it in half and ended up having to double the cooking time to get it cooked perfectly to 155 degrees. I did flip the tenderloins every 25 minutes.  I let it rest while I made the sauce and I added two packets of gravy to the sauce mix in the pan since I had about 4.5 to 5 cups of broth.  I served it with mashed potatoes. It was a hit with my family!

We liked this recipe very much.  I did what one of the reviews suggested and used 1cup of wine and 1 cup of sodium reduced beef broth (not concentrated).  The only other change I made was to cut into the pork in 4 areas and insert small garlic cloves.  It was delicious.  I will try it again maybe just follow the original recipe or try other suggestions.

I have been coming to this site for recipe ideas for years. Never made a dish that made me actually sign up for the site to review. This was fantastic! Picky wife loved it. Picky kids loved it. I usually get annoyed when people talk about what they did to the recipe....but I made some changes as many have. 1 cup of wine/1 cup of beef broth. Used 2 one pound loins. Browned them in olive oil and butter before baking. Used Cabernet because I had it and I like it. Used sliced mushrooms and onions for the sauce. Meat didn't turn purple or pink. Sauce was not black. This is a MUST MAKE for everyone. Simple and delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the easiest and most gourmet tasting dish I've ever made.  I replaced the celery with sliced fresh button mushrooms, added 1/2 cup of water to the wine while making the gravy with an additional gravy packet, as another review had suggested.  

The flavor is out of this world!!!!  Watch out Bobby Flay!  Hubby and friends gave it 5 stars all around.  This is definitely a meal to impress!

My first review here because this was great!  We loved it, the pork took longer than 45 min. I like my pork more well done, I baked it for an hour and 10 min. I also added sautéed fresh mushrooms. It's a keeper!

I'm slowly learning the ropes in cooking full meals as an adult and this was a great first recipe cooking pork. Minimal prep with amazing results. Yum yum. I struggled with the gravy at the end not ever thickening up so I think I'd try to do something different with that next time, but still using what came of it for additional flavor on top of the meat worked well. I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Good meal!

This is one of the top 5 worst recipes on this site. I'm disgusted right now. This was a giant pile of salty, winey garbage. I would give this negative stars if I could. , I followed this recipe exactly.

Holy Moly! Something that is so easy to make and tastes so good and that can be served at a formal dinner, deserves nothing but the highest rating! Like other reviewers, I was very skeptical, but since there were so many high reviews, I decided to try it.

I've made tenderloins so many ways trying to find something that is good, but even the most "fancy" and difficult recipes end up so-so. For this, I used a smaller tenderloin, it was 1.44lbs (only feeding 2 adults and a kid). I seasoned it per the recipe, and then seared in a hot pan, to avoid the off grey color it would have. I used 1.5c of inexpensive (but not dirt cheap) burgundy wine and a half cup of beef broth. Cooked until the meat red just under 160, took it out and prepared the sauce. Sliced and covered with the sauce. HOLY MOLY. This has to be the most tender and flavorful tenderloin ever. It was amazing. I served with mashed potatoes and covered them with the sauce :)

I don't understand what the rave is about this recipe.  I followed it exactly except for using 1 cup wine, 1 cup broth, and added mushrooms.  I wished I would have seared the pork before hand and sauteed the vegetables.  I think that would have gave it more flavor.  Over baking will result in the pork being overly dry.  I removed it at 155 degrees and wish I took it out at 150 (we like our meat a little more pink).

3.5 stars. It's hard to rate this one precisely because I believed I overcooked it slightly, but overall the flavors were good. Celery was a nice touch. The gravy did not thicken as much as I would have liked.

I made this last night with a bottle of $5.00 wine and a 1.5 lb. tenderloin and it was amazing.  My husband couldn't get enough.  And it will be perfect for the two of us again tonight and tomorrow on sandwiches!  Delicious!

Very tasty. The pork was incredibly tender. We followed the recipe almost exactly, only adding some sliced baby Bella mushrooms bc we thougt they'd be a nice addition and an additional packet of gravy so the sauce would thicken, as suggested by others. The wine sauce (used a burgundy) was a bit strong for us, so next time we'll sub some water or broth for one cup of wine. The mushrooms soaked up the wine and became just too bitter and overall the wine taste was a bit too present. Next time we'll also sautée our onions first as we like them pretty soft and ours stayed quite crunchy. Not sure if this was a quirk of our oven or what. Pork was perfection at 350 for 50min and 5-7 minutes of rest. Served with baked potatoes and sautéed broccoli and cauliflower. It wasn't perfect but It was tender and easy and we will definitely make it again with a few small changes.

Fantastic!  I rubbed the pork with olive oil and Italian herbs, salt and pepper.  I also added a little cornstarch to the gravy/wine mixture.  Served with red mashed potatoes and greenbeans topped with almond slivers.  Amazing-  thanks!!

Very good tenderloin.  I did only use 1 cup wine with 1 cup beef broth and am glad I did.  I seared the mean with olive oil and butter before putting the meat into the dish.  Other than that, I followed the rest of recipe.

We don't usually eat pork, but we got a nice cut from our butchers and tried out this recipe. For how simple it is, it complements a good cut of pork really well. Keep it as is.

Delicious!  My husband and I aren't even big fans of pork, but we both loved this.  I didn't make any changes--just served it with fresh green beans and potatoes.  Will definitely make this again!

Made this dish last night - excellent  - so tender - the only thing I did differently was adjust the wine to 1 cup and used one cup of beef broth instead - will add mushrooms next time - a simple delicious dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe. But just like the others that have mentioned, I had decreased the wine to 1cup and a little more broth. But other than that, I stuck to the recipe as is. Very simple and very tasty.

This was amazing. I wanted to try something new. I am an extremely picky eater and usually hate pork but my boyfriend can only stand so much chicken. We both loved it and he hates wine and usually doesn't like pork. I added fresh garlic as well as the powdered garlic that it called for. I also seared the meat before baking it. It came so tender it was like a roast. I paired it with asparagus and baked baby reds that were seasoned with garlic and rosemary. This is a meal I will use when trying to impress, its simply that good. And super simple to make.

I'm not sure what went wrong but 1 packet of brown gravy mixed with 2 cups of wine and juice do not equal "thickened" - at least not in my kitchen, regardless how long I stirred in.  So I ended up with wine-soaked pork in a lot of juice.  However, hubby said the flavor was "good" - just an odd consistency.

I only had a tenderloin that was just over one pound, so I used one cup of wine. I omitted the celery and used sliced portabella mushrooms. Once the meat was up to temp, I poured the remaining wine, onions, and mushrooms into a saucepan. Then I added the gravy mix and heated on the stove top. Oh, and I used a low sodium gravy mix. It was fabulous and SOOO easy (but looks fancy)! This will definitely be on the dinner rotation!!

I really wanted to love this after reading all of the reviews!  But, alas, I did not.  I think the trick, as mentioned in a previous review, is to use BURGUNDY wine - we just used a good red wine.  I wish we would have saved the wine for drinking ;)

This was very good, I gave it 4 stars because I changed it from all wine to half wine and half chicken broth.  I also used a gluten free packet of dry gravy!  It was a super easy but very good Sunday night dinner!

Quick, easy, and oh so tasty!  Gotta love that in a recipe!  I added mushrooms just because I love them and used a cabernet since that's what I had on hand.  Served with roasted potatoes but may use mashed next time since there's so much gravy.  I will consider reducing the wine to one cup cuz there was so much.  Next time I will thicken the gravy some too; it was pretty thin.  All in all, a great recipe as written, thanks!

I made this last week, the only I  thing I changed was I used 1 1/4 cup red wine and one cup AJUS ( beef broth )YOu could still taste the wine well enough! I also browned the meat first with flour and olive oil and sprinkled italian seasonings on top with pepper. This was so tender it you could break it apart with your fork. Made mashed potatos and used the leftover sauce for the gravy! THE BEST!

This was so, so good!  And this recipe literally cannot be any easier.  It seemed so fancy for A Tuesday night dinner!  It cooked perfectly in the 45 minutes.  Like the previous reviewers, I omitted the celery and onion (used onion powder) and used 1 c. wine/1 c. beef broth.  I also dumped the pan juices into a saucepan with the gravy mix to bring to a boil to thicken the gravy.  My son gobbled down 2 helpings and my husband loved it.   Thanks!

Five stars because the boys loved it. I did use 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup red wine. I seasoned the tenderloin and browned it, sprinkled mushrooms over the top and then baked it. I used 2 pkgs of gravy mix. Very good.

I made this tonight and was the best tenderloin ever! My husband couldn't get enough of it, who would have thought red wine and gravy mix together would make a such a scrumptious sauce?  Delicious and I will always make it this way from now on!

Wonderful!  I absolutely loved it!  My kids thought the wine was a bit strong so I will decrease the wine next time but what I did do was instead of celery and onions I just added onion powder with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder then about ten minutes before it was done I threw in sliced mushrooms and the gravy was to die for!  I know my late mother in law would have loved this recipe and I wish I could have shared it with her.

I used a Merlot and LOVED the flavor it gave the pork. And it made it sooo tender. I did use the onions and celery. At the end I put the au jus in a sauce pan and reduced with 3 packets of gravy and beef broth. I cooked 4lbs of pork loin with the 2 cups of wine for company and we had a nice hint of the wine in the sauce. But packet gravy does have to be brought to a boil to thicken properly. I have also made this and instead of the gravy packet make a rue with butter and flour and then add the au jus from the pan with beef broth and that is yummy to and is not as salty. All in all a keeper.

Enjoyed the ease of prep. Was in the oven in no time. Took a little more than an hour to reach 158 degrees. Like others have stated, the gravy did not thicken up at all. I poured it into a sauce pan and reduced it adding a pad of butter at the end and it thickened nicely. Low maintence, decent flavor meal.

This was so simple to prepare and it looked beautiful in the oven.  It tasted great too and I will make it again.  The one odd thing about it is that the wine does give it a pale pink color which could freak people out giving them the impression that the pork isn't cooked through.  I wanted a little more flavor for all of the wine as well.  In the future I'll cook it as the recipe states but I'll add the wine and vegetable mixture to a sauce pan and  reduce the sauce (some roasted shallots might be yummy too.) I think this will intensify the flavor and also the thicker sauce might mask the pink pork a bit.  I'm excited to try it again!

I made this last night..........and I'm not sure why it turned out this way but I followed the recipe exactly how it was written. 1. The cook time was way off   2. The taste of the meat was VERY bland   3. The gravy was not good at all.

absolutely love this recipe!! i do omit the onions and celery, as per other comments. i use 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. i also use two packets of the brown gravy mix, and add 1 cup of beef broth. i cook red potatoes tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, and rosemary right in the dish with the tenderloin. my hubby said this is a keeper and a dish to serve when we have company!!

Awesome. This is one of those dishes that you taste and think, "I can't believe *I* really made this!"  The grocery store didn't have pre-packaged pork tenderloin this week, so I just grabbed a 1.7 lb pork loin, and it turned out tender and delicious. I am not a wine aficionado by any means, so I was sort of lost looking for a "Burgandy" wine at my (huge) local liquor store. The clerk I talked to said that when recipes call for a "burgandy" wine, it's alright to use any medium bodied red wine. He recommended a $10 Chilean pinot noir, and it worked just fine. Two things did go sort of awry with this recipe: 1) it took a little over an hour to cook (this could have been because of my cut of meat), and 2) the "gravy" was extremely watery even after a ton of stirring. Next time I will reduce it further on the stove top. I may also try just using flour/ cornstarch and a little salt/pepper instead of the gravy mix next time as this gravy was just slightly too salty for my taste.

This was ok.  I didn't like the celery and the sauce didn't thicken up after adding the gravy mix.  I should have read the reviews and browned the pork on the stove top first and cut down on the salt and pepper rub.  When I served the leftovers, I simmered the sauce and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up - much better.  The first night we had this, the red wine was pooling on our plates.  Probably won't make this again, but it was nice to try.

This recipe was fabulous! The tenderloin came out so tender and flavorful! Besides omitting celery (because I had none) and using fresh garlic, I followed the recipe exactly.  However, my gravy didn't thicken but I know it was because the wine hadn't come to a high enough temperature to stir in the gravy mix.  Next time, I plan to bring the wine to a low boil after roasting before adding the gravy mix.  This was a very easy recipe and I would recommend it for anyone to try.

Love this recipe but did make a few changes. I used half wine and half beef broth instead of all wine and I used about 1.5 cups of each. Because I upped the liquid I used 2 packets of brown and or pork gravy. This gave me more yummy gravy to serve with the pork. Great with mashed potatoes! I did not have any celery on hand so I used celery seed to get the flavour without the actual celery.  I also seared the pork before reserving and making the gravy in the same pan. I then added the pork back to the gravy and popped the whole pan in the oven to finish. The browned bits from the pork added more goodness to the gravy as I deglazed with the wine. Yum.

Everyone loved it. Took other ratings and made sure I didn't over cook it. Used Burgandy wine, and green onions and mushrooms on top. Easy to make, will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe. This would be a very elegant meal to serve to company. Garlic mashed potatoes compliment the gravy and is the perfect side. This dish is so easy to make there is no reason not to try it at least once and you will be glad you did. I do not know of any other meat that cooks in less than an hour yet is so tender. this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious. Quick, painless - almost out of wine, so 1 cup wine, 1 cup veg broth - soooo yummy!  Next tim I might throw some sliced garlic in with the onions and celery but really, perfect just the way it's given! Thanks for this keeper!

`Yep, great recipe. Simple, minimal ingredients and prep time was fast.    I prepared the recipe exactly as described.It was delicious. For what it's worth, My kids didn't like it. Then again we'd eat chicken nuggets every night if I made meals around their whims.

This is an okay recipe for pork tenderloin, but had to make changes.  I seasoned as directed, should have rubbed with minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I seared the pork in 1T butter and 1T EVOO to get the nice color.  I then sauteed the onions and portabello mushrooms (replaced the celery) with a bit of wine before adding to the pan. The portabello mushrooms added a lot of flavor tol the dish.  Thje gravy was just awful.  It was way too salty and took away the wine flavor of the sauce.  Next time I will leave it out and use cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.

It was really good. The only problem was it took a lot longer than 45 minutes to cook for me. I ended up turning the temp up when all my side dishes were getting cold because I planned around it being ready in 45 minutes. I think it took almost 1 and 1/2 hours, so be prepared. The brown gravy mix worked really well with the drippings and the wine gave it a nice extra flavour. I made it with mashed potatoes (really nice with the brown sauce) and green beans. I liked it a lot with a bit of dijon mustard on the side too. The recipe makes a lot so I had a bunch of left overs and I made some sandwiches in nice buns the next day. It was really good!

Loved the recipe.  I left out the onions (just don't care for them) and I followed some advice to use 1/2 wine & 1/2 beef broth, and that was the only mistake I think.  It tasted too much like brown gravy with a hint of wine rather than a burgandy sauce.  Next time I will follow recipe fully and I expect it will be perfect!!

Very easy and very good.  Loved the "gravy".  I used the leafy tops from the celery, left them all in one piece and laid them across the tops of the pork ternderloins along with sliced onion.  Made it easy to remove before make the gravy, but still added flavor.

I made this last night and it was sooo delicious. I seared the pork for a couple minutes on each side then plopped it in a pan.  I put one cup of red wine and one cup of water, thinly sliced onions and mushrooms. I mixed it with poutine gravy as that is all I had. It was awesome!

This was really good.  I added a thyme and rosemary to the pork in addition to the other ingredients, and pan seared.  When the meat was done I poured the wine and pan drippings in to the searing pan to make the gravy.  Next time I'll use fresh garlic.

Wow what a terrific and simple meal. I read a few reviews first which proved valuable. I also added brown mushrooms, using not only onion but also shallots. For cloves of crushed garlic topped it off. I alos marinated the entire dish for appox. two hours prior to cooking. The gravy turned out fantastic. Taking some hints from other reviews we used the gravy on the potatoes as well as the meat. I also served fresh yellow beans cooked in two cans of Italian style tomatoes. YUM YUM YUM this will be a regular dish for us now.

OMG!!! This was delicious.  I have needed a recipe for a pork roast, since I make them frequently (to get away from too much red meat) but I find them boring and lacking flavor, even when I season them well.  This was wonderful. I also love that this is the type of recipe you can make for guests and know that everyone is going to love it, without a doubt!

This was very tasty and so simple to make! It took longer than the recipe called for -- about an hour to get to 160 degrees. I would definitely make again. The wine gravy is wonderful.

I really wanted to love this recipe because it's so easy and how bad can wine and gravy mix be?  I was disappointed in the flavor of the sauce as well as the consistency; I had to boil it for a few minutes to get it to a decent consistency after I removed from the oven.  The color of the meat from the red wine was also unappealing.   Thank you for sharing, but I won't be making this again.

I had such high hopes for this recipe based on all of the 5 stars that many reviewers gave it.  The wine was way too overpowering and the sauce was too salty.  I would probably have given it 2 stars, but my 3 kids ages 12.,16 and 17 hated it and they wouldn't eat it.  They LOVE pork tenderloin usually.  I would HIGHLY recommend the EASY AND ELEGANT PORK TENDERLOIN listed on this site instead.  In addition to that recipe I rub whole grain mustard on the tenderloins and add lots of rosemary to the bread crumb mixture.  EVERYONE loves that dish.

This recipe was good.  I did make some adjustments after reading the reviews.  I did sear the tenderloins in the pan before putting into the oven.  I topped with onions only, and I used 1-1/2 c. beef broth, and 1/2 c. red wine.  Everything turned out really good. I liked the sauce, the pork itself was very tender it could have used a touch more flavor.  The sauce, which could have been a gravy (I should have thickened it) was delicious over the meat, and mashed potatoes.

Once cooked, I shredded it and served it over pasta along with the juices. It tasted a little sweet, maybe because I used a Porto. Not a favourite though.

I made the recipe as written and the wine flavor was too overwhelming for us and we love cooking with wine and beer.  The problem could have been that the wine was of low quality.

Fantastic. My husband did only use 1 cup red wine and subbed 1 cup of vegetable broth because we were afraid it would be to much wine for the little ones. The gravy was awesome, I used 1 and 1/2 packets brown gravy mix. Served with mashed potatoes and peas.

Not just eyoo,...but yyeeeoooo!! Yuk!:-(   Followed recipe exactly, and knew when I saw the yuk brown color when I grabbed it from the oven that it would be yuk! The taste was "gamey," like I was eating Elk or something. This will be the l-a-s-t time I make tenderloin without something sweet. Try the "Special POrk Tenderloin" with applesauce and applejuice! YUMMY!

Good & Easy. I found it a bit bland, but will DEFINATELY try it again (making a few changes) and will (I'm sure) increase the stars as I tweak the recipie.

We made this and served it with mashed potatoes.  However, we didn't use a package of gravy mix.  

Instead, simply add a small amount of cornstarch (or flour if you prefer) to the juices and pour into a small pot.  Heat while stirring until it thickens.  You can season if you'd like too.

This was wonderful! I took some advise and used 2 packets of the gravy mix, however, next time I will make more because we ran out of gravy before we did meat. (my tenderloin was 2.75lbs) I also strained the onion and celery out of the gravy. It doesn't say to do that but I assumed that is what you were supposed to do and I liked it that way. It was excellent and perfect for family or company.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I used one cup red wine and one cup chicken stock, from reading other reviews, and it turned out great!  I also added some slices of an apple in with the onions and celery.

Amazing recipe!!!  I omitted the celery and onion because to be quite honest when I got home from work , I didn't feel like chopping them up, haha, and it still came out amazing!! I used 2 gravy packets and a little extra red wine to the pan while cooking.  I got rave reviews!! thanks for the amazing recipe!! SO easy!!

This was an interesting one... I will not say that it was not good, but we were not big fans of it...  It was a bit too much of a wine taste for us..  May be good with a peach or an apple infused wine...  Meat was very very tender and it smelled very good while cooking...

I was really disappointed with this recipe. We found the wine flavor to be way too overpowering. We're huge gravy fans and were so excited about the yummy sauce everyone was raving about. Turns out we didn't care for it much at all. We ate it, but certainly didn't save the leftovers (and there were a lot).

I thought this recipe turned out really nice.  My husband loved the sauce but thought the meat iteself was a little bland.  Definitely worth trying this recipe.  I cut wine in half, used beef broth for other half, and cut out onions and celery altogether.  Still yummy, hubby's just too picky.

Well, I made this 2 nights ago and had the left overs tonight.  The meat was just as good the second time!  I made the meat exactly as directed.  The only change I made was with the gravy: I used pork gravy mix instead of brown.  I wonder if that accounted for the very strong, rather bitter taste the gravy had.  I will make this again because the meat was so flavorful and tender, but I will have to change things up a bit on the gravy....maybe I will use part chicken broth as others have suggested.  I do think that the onion and celery are important for flavor...I read on review that said to leave them out; I wouldn't.
As I mentioned, the meat was wonderful, very flavorful and tender.  Certainly good enough for company.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Very good for being so incredibly easy!  I used mushrooms instead of celery, and a good pinot noir.  (The cook gets the rest!)  THe only thing I would do differently is to maybe brown the tenderloin in a pan first to make a nice crust before going in the oven.  I will definitely make this again.  Love those easy recipes that look like you slaved all day.

This is one of my favorite recipes for pork tenderloin. The only thing I do different is use celery salt instead of celery & regular salt. I also cook it in the slow cooker. It is awesome!

I was a bit unsure whether I would like this recipe, but with all the votes I figured it had to be good - It was!!  I followed the recipe, but like others suggested, I added two small cans of mushrooms (we like mushrooms), substituted one cup of the wine with chicken broth, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end.  I added the sour cream because I thought it was a little salty.  This was really good and my husband and I both agree this is a recipe we will make several times again.  Thank you for such a good recipe and so easy to make!!

This is a wonderful recipe to have a Sunday style dinner during the week.  It is very easy and fast.  I came home from picking up my kids at 5 PM.  Had everything ready to go and Boom! in the oven in 10 minutes.  By the time I changed and got the boys settled dinner is done.  I served with rice, but potatoes would be wonderful with this (oven roasted, baked, mashed).  I would use two seasoning gravy packets as others suggested, since the wine flavor is a bit strong, especially for children.  I suggest a wine that's a bit lighter like a pinot noir or beaujolais.

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend with mashed potatoes and pan-fried asparagus, and he gave me the best compliment. He actually picked up his plate and licked up what was left of the gravy because "it was so good".

I found this recipe in one of my AllRecipe cookbooks and didn't get on the computer to look for any helpful hints from the reviews.  I had a 2.36 lb whole tenderloin, which I had to tie together to roast, and I did not sear first.  Just seasoned with pepper, garlic powder and salt, sliced onions on top (didn't have any celery) and 2 cups of the burgundy cooking wine found in grocery stores.  I was worried about this because you're supposed to cook with wine you would drink - well neither of us can stand red wine, but love foods flavored with red wine, so that's how I compromised.  For those who thought the wine taste was too heavy, it might be an idea for you, becase neither of us thought the wine taste was overpowering; it was light.  I started check the temp at one hour - upped oven temp to 375 and cooked for another 1/2 hour to achieve temp.  (It smelled great while cooking.) Removed roast and onions to a platter and dumped the gravy mix in the pan juices.  This is the only thing I would not do again - I didn't care for the gravy, even though my husband thought it was allright.  It was too salty and I like my salt, so that says something. Next time, I'll thicken another way.  However, the onions that fell off the roast and into the "wine" were GREAT on top of the tenderloin pieces.  I served with Mashed Sweet Potatoes and peas and carrots.  Very good meal and we're looking forward to the leftovers.

Fabulous!  I used a 2 1/2 lb tenderloin and it took about 1 1/2 hours to bake.  VERY juicy.  I used other reviewers suggestions and only used 1 cup wine and 1 cup chicken broth.  It's a good thing I did because 2 cups would have been overwhelming.  I also used 2 packets of the gravy mix.  It was EXCELLENT with the meat.  The flavor was delicious.  This will be the main dish I make when we have guests.

This recipe is easy to follow and sooo good. Everyone in my house loved it. Great for making when having someone over for dinner. Lots of flavor and tender. I used a red wine cooking wine. Can also use Chuck Roast if not into pork.

I doubled the recipe for a larger dinner party and it turned out great!  I used half beef broth and half wine instead of all red wine, and I threw in mushrooms and carrots.  The pork was tender and the gravy added great flavor.  I'll definately make this again!

This is the most delicious pork roast I have ever made. My boyfriend said it tasted like it came from a restaurant. I've made it 5 times since, and I won't cook a pork roast any other way! (I use the cooking red wine in the grocery store and it is GREAT!) Thank you for the recipe!

I had similiar complications as previous reviewers mentioned.  Will use a meat thermometer next time because my pork was not done in 45 min (even letting it rest while making the sauce), and I also had too much wine to thicken the sauce with just one gravy packet.  Will probably try searing it first and using 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth as suggested.  Will make again because the pork was very tender and the sauce was great!

This was so easy, flavorful, & hearty.  It's presentation and flavor are good enough for a dinner party, but it's quick & easy enough for a weeknight meal.  My thoughts: the celery isn't necessary, add minced garlic, serve with a fresh green salad & French bread (to soak up that awesome sauce), & MAKE SURE YOU USE A GOOD RED WINE (one that you'd drink).

My husband and I loved this tenderloin. We didn't think the wine was overpowering at all. I did add a little bit of beef broth with the wine and I added milk and cornstarch to the sauce instead of gravy mix. It was perfect. I will definately make this again

I made this for friends and they loved it, it was very flavorful and moist.  I used sliced center cut tenderloin and it still worked great.  I omitted the celery and onions like others had done.  The color was amazing.  I will definitely make this again!

Very tender meat, it melts in your mouth. I used Merlot but it was a bit strong tasting. I may try 1/2 wine and 1/2 beef broth next time.

Wow, a simple & impressive lowfat entree! I used a cabernet for the wine and found I had to cook longer than stated. I'm sure roasting time depends on thickeness of roast. Use a thermometer & just make sure it's 160 degrees and you're good to go. The smell while it was cooking was incredible, could hardly wait for it to come out of the oven. I also added some mushrooms, which are fabulous with the cab & onions.

I made this for my husband and another couple.  We have dinner together one night every 2 months and try to make something different everytime.  We loved this recipe.  I even saved some and brought to my 87 year old mother in law.  She loved it too.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's hard to find good recipes for pork tha t look and taste time gourmet w/o all the time and work!

This was very good.The next time I will not use the pkg. gravy mix since it gives it a artificial flavor ( I think)
I will make my own gravy with the wine and maybe some mushroom and thicken with a little flour or cornstarch.

Next time I will marinade the pork in the sauce in order to saturate the meat with the flavor.  Otherwise, the meat lacked flavor.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I took the tips of others and omitted the salt and celery, added mushrooms and cut the wine in half and added 1 cup of beef broth.  Then I cooked it for an hour and served with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Gravy much too salty!!!
I marinated the tenderloin in all ingredients, except the gravy mix and salt. Cooked as directed. Added the gravy mix and it was too salty to use. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and it was better.
 I will eliminate the gravy mix, next time, and add the cream of mushroom soup. Easy and very tasty!

First time I've tried a pork tenderloin recipe.  This one turned out really well,  not to mention that it was really simple to make.  I was a bit skeptical, with just salt, pepper and garlic powder, but it does a good job flavoring the meat along with the onions and celery basically acting as an insulator for the juices.  
I used a convection oven to cook my tenderloin, and it took about 33-35 minutes or so to cook it all the way through.  
Note: for the gravy, one pack of the gravy mix didn't make the gravy quite thick enough, so I thickened it with a roux.

This recipe was excellent, with a few modifications. I marinated the tenderloin in wine, Montreal steak spice and garlic powder for about an hour before. I used 1.5 packages of gravy mix and added baby portabella mushrooms. Delicious!

This recipe is so easy to prepare!  I've made it twice and had no leftovers! I used 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth instead of 2 cups wine. In place of the celery, I added fresh quartered mushrooms.  It's a keeper!  Thanks Kathleen.

I thought this was great.  I altered the recipe a bit and I'm gonna go for it again for the BIG GAME (super bowl) tomorrow.  I'm gonna tweak it a bit again and hope it works as well as it did before.

Excellent!  I made this for my bookclub dinner last year and they requested it again.  I'm going to try the 1 cup merlot to 1 cup low sodium beef broth and 2 pkgs. pork gravy mix.  Also adding mushrooms and browning the meat first.

Once again, a recipe that gets high ratings manages to disappoint us. The tenderloin inself was good and very tender if you could get past the ugliness of the onions and celery laying on top. That aside, the sauce is nothing but brown gravy. I doctored it with every means possible including adding more wine, water and some butter at the end. At this point, I thought it was better. My husband disagreed and said: "What is this brown stuff." I said, "brown gravy." He then stated: "I hate brown gravy."

There was just too much wine taste for us.  I ended up patting the roast with paper towels and making my own gravy discarding the wine gravy.

I fixed this for dinner last night and it was delicious, a definite keeper. Unfortunately, I over cooked the meat so it was a little dry, but that was my fault. This sauce is really good, I used an inexpensive Merlot and it worked great. I used 2 packets of gravy mix and simmered it quite awhile to thicken. I am thinking of trying this recipe with beef and adding a carton of sliced fresh mushrooms next time.

This recipe was a definite hit (even with kids). I would add some button mushrooms to the celery and onion next time to enhance the presentation.

This recipe was excellent. The pork was tender and juicy, and the sauce was incredibly tasty, thought not thick. I served it with a side of twice-baked potatos. Next time I am going to try laying some smoked bacon on top of the tenderloin, I think it will give it a nice, subtle, smoky flavor. The leftovers were unbelievable!

i didn't read the suggestions before i tried this recipe and am sorry that i didn't. while the meat was very tender and tasty, had i followed the suggestions of others i would have had better success. my gravy was definitely thin (i should have used two packets instead of one and i added flour on my own and cooked it on the stove on my own) all in all a very good recipe. just needed to make the few suggested changes. I will definitely be trying this again as my kids and my hubby really liked it!

This was nice and easy. My boyfriend was crazy about it. I loved the gravy (I made it with flour and stock rather than powdered gravy), but I thought the meat itself didn't have much flavour.. Next time I might try putting a bit more spicing on it, but it was delicous.

This tasted great...  I would give it 5 stars, but the gravy was too thin.  Next time I will take the advise of others who reviewed, and add another gravy packet.

This was really good.  I think I may try it with beef roast next.  Taking hints from other reviewers, I used 2 gravy packets also and used cornstarch/water to thicken it up a bit. I also added some mushrooms.  The smell in the house was amazing..there's something about cooking with red wine!  I served with garlic mashed. Very,very,very tasty! Thanks.

I forgot to add the brown gravy mix - but it was awesome.  The onions totally make the dish...along with mashed potatoes.  My fiance said this meal was one of his favorites...and he's a critic.

Forget five stars, this is a ten for porkloin.  The gravy is the best I've ever had.  It may be a thin sauce, but the flavour is to die for!
I also added mushrooms, and of course served with potatoes to soak up the heavenly gravy.  And so easy!

This was okay. It tasted pretty good but the pork turned very purple from the wine and it just didn't look that appealing. Not sure I would make it again.

My husband is also not fond of pork, but LOVED this one.  I browned the pork first in olive oil and fresh garlic.  Then sauted the veggies and deglazed with the wine.  Poured all over seared roast and baked.  I also used two packets of brown gravy mix and cut the salt with two teaspoons of margerine.  Absolutely fantastic!!  Even my kids loved this.

This was a very good recipe. Very easy and loved by my whole family. I strained the sauce (my kids aren't great lovers of onions). Had plenty of sauce for the gravy.

I am not a big pork fan, but this recipie won me over!  It was deliciously tender.  Instead of 2 cups of red wine I used one cup of wine (all I had) and one cup of beef broth.  Tasted great and was so easy.

This recipe is absolutely the best.  Turns out perfect everytime and everyone raves about it.  I used 1 1/2 cups wine and 1/2 cup water.  Added fresh sliced mushrooms to the wine while cooking and used 1 1/2 pkgs of gravy mix.  My family can't get enough of this recipe.  I have passed it on to EVERYONE.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This recipe is very good.  I omitted the veggies but I did use 2 cups of red wine as suggested.  Next time I will probably use a little less wine and make up the difference with water.  Only fault I have with this recipe is that 2 lb of tenderloin for 4 people is rather excessive as pork is a lean meat and as there is no waste it goes a long way.  I am having a dinner party for 6 in a couple of weeks and I will probably use this recipe still using 2 lb of tenderloin.

This was  the most wonderful pork dish that I have ever eaten..and I can't believe it came from my kitchen.  I served it with sweet potatoes, white corn and crescent rolls.  There is plenty side dish leftovers, but no pork. My family loved it!!!!  This is definately a keeper.  Thanks Kathleen and thanks AllRecipes.com

Very good.   Only used 1-1/2 cups red wine (zinfindel) and 1/2 water.    Everyone liked it and asked for the recipe.   The pork is good but the gravy is what makes this dish.   My friend though the gravy would taste great on beef too.    Only thing I will do different next time is to put the gravy on the pork bfore serving rather than serving on the side..

i do cooking demonstrations for an appliance company, and i am always looking for easy yet somewhat sophisticated recipes that will impress without taking all day. 
this really filled the bill. i chose this recipe based on the other reviews, and found them to be accurate, including ones that said "succulent", "easy", and "suprisingly delicious!". it was as if i had slaved all day. 
the only thing i added was parsnips and i used two envelopes of gravy mix. also, i seared the tenderloin before adding to the dish. the sauce came out rich and delicious, and everyone raved. i never tried the recipe exactly as written, though i wonder if i really helped it with my extra work.... good luck!

This was great! The whole family really liked it! I liked how easy it was to prepare! I added mushrooms in addition to the celery and onion. I also poured the gravy into a sauce pan to thicken it at the end. I will make it next time I have guests! Mashed Potatoes are a must with this one!

Wow!  My husband actually raved about this and he rarely comments on my attempts with new recipes.  My kitchen smelled incredible from the moment this went into the oven.  The combinations of garlic, onion & red wine are incredible.  The preparation was so simple.  I did need to increase the cooking time from 45 min. to about one hour.  When adding the gravy mix to the pan drippings, I got a thin, wonderfully flavored sauce (not thick like a gravy).  My children enjoyed their servings without the sauce.  Thank you so much for this incredible recipe.  I can't wait to make it again for guests.

This did make the house smell absolutely delicious and the sauce/gravy was very tasty but the pork was nothing very special.  Certainly not better than other ways I've cooked it.  I probably won't make this again.  I wish I could get the gravy without preparing the pork!

This was very impressive to serve company. It was quick to prepare, didn't take long to cook and tasted great.I did not have burgundy wine so I used purple grape juice. I also halved mushrooms and put on top of roast half way through cooking.I rate this "Excellent"

This is a very good recipe.  My husband thought it was fantastic.  Made it for Christmas dinner and it is so easy.  The only thing is the cooking time of 45 mins was way too short for my oven (I have a one year old GE).  Ended up cooking for over an hour and it came out perfectly moist and tender.  The flavor was subtle but tasty.  I would definitely make it again.  p.s.  It will make your house smell wonderful!!!

The red wine and the pork combination kind of scared me but the end result was
just plain old rich and yummy, strained the gravy and served over mashed
Yukon Golds with side of blanced and sauted fresh green beans.

I have never written a review for all recipes before but felt this recipe warranted one.  I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this simple meal turned out, and I am a self-proclaimed foodie:)  Like others, I did change the recipe a bit, based on my own tastes.  After seasoning the pork with salt, pepper and minced garlic, I browned both sides.  I then placed the meat in a baking dish, covered with some precut veggies I bought at Kroger - squash, onions, zucchini and carrots, mixed 1 cup of merlot with 1 cup beef consumme (Campbells), and poured that on top.  I cooked the meat for 45 min but probably would decrease to 40 min next time.  I then poured the wine-consumme mixture into a pan, mixed in some corn starch blended with water, and brought to a boil.  I then simmered for a few minutes to desired thickness and served over the meat and precut veggies.  Some fresh thyme might be a nice touch next time too.  Excellent restaurant-quality meal. I would highly recommend!

This is a family staple at our house.  The only change I make is to omit the salt because the gravy mix is salty enough in itself.

I read the reviews on this recipe and decided to incorporate a couple into my preparation. Someone marinated the pork overnight in a mixture of white wine/olive oil and cut the red wine with half beef broth. Either way the key is not to over cook the pork. When it was done cooking I used the juices from the pork to make two gravies, one with mushrooms and the other without. Thirty people loved the dinner and would do this similar recipe again.

The timing on the meat and the ratio of liquid to meat was spot on so the meat came  out tender and juicy. However, the red wine turned the surface an unappetizing purple. Likewise, the predominance of red wine in the gravy made it harsh, even though I used a good bottle.  After removing the  cooked meat, I gave the gravy a more meaty and complex taste (and a thicker texture) by adding 2 tbsps of butter, a pinch of dried thyme, 2 pinches of sugar, a teaspoon of corn starch, and  a beef bouillon cube (Knorrs). I then cut the meat in thick slices and let it sit in the  warm, thickened gravy before serving.  In the future I would sear the meat  before putting it in the cooking liquid, omit the  gravy mix and change the 2 cups of cooking liquid to 75% broth and 25% wine. I would also add some  bay leaf or thyme to the cooking liquid in order to impart a little herbal taste.

Like many others, seared the pork.  Also left out the veggies and added sauteed mushrooms after searing the meat and added them to the gravy.  Used one cup burgundy wine, one cup beef broth.  Served with seared asparagus and roasted red potatoes.  Will frequent this one.

This was exceptional,  unbelievably easy with great results.  Made this exactly as written the first time and whole family loved it. The second time around made a couple of changes based on our family preference...used fresh minced garlic, didn't add any salt (wasn't needed), used granulated onion powder in place of sliced onion and added a bay leaf to wine, covered with foil and baked 50 min. Delicious! Thank you for sharing.

I have been making this recipe for quite a while now. My family loves it. The only thing that I changed was I omitted the celery, I changed the wine to 1 Cup, and replaced the other cup of wine with beef broth. When the tenderloin was done I added sauteed fresh mushrooms to the gravy.  I have never had a dissatisfied customer with this dish

This was super easy and lives up to all the great reviews it gets.  Very good, moist, tender.....I replaced celery with mushrooms.  Used fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Also marinated first for about an hour (olive oil, pepper, sliced onions, garlic).  As good is this is....I couldn't help but wonder why it would call for brown gravy.  I will make this again, but opt for the pork gravy mix next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

My first review EVER - honestly, I just had to because I've been making pork tenderloin for years and this is by far the best recipe I've ever tried!  I added mushrooms and half/half on the broth and wine but otherwise, I followed it exactly and it was scrumptious!!!

Absolutely delicious!  The recipe is superb as is. I've made this for years and have had no complaints. The only changes I've made is to add mushrooms and cover the dish with foil and bake 2 hours at 325. When done, allow to rest at least 8 minutes, then purée half of the sauce and add it to 16oz of pork gravy.   Combine this with the remaining wine & vegetables and pour over the tenderloin(s) before serving.

So good. Tender, flavorful and so easy. I used a small loin roast and put in slivers of garlic.  It took about 90 minutes to cook.  I paired it with roasted garlic new potatoes and sugar snap peas. So easy. I prepared the roast , put it in the refrigerator adding the wine just before baking. My husband said, "make it anytime".

Such an easy dinner and so good. Just add a packet of brown gravy mix to the cooked wine for great gravy to go over the meat and mashed potatoes.

I don't usually like pork, but this recipe was amazing!!! Did it exactly the way suggested. Everything was perfect but the sauce didn't thicken. Still, the flavors were great and the meat was like butter. Had it for 45 minutes at 350 then, wrapped it with foil until the rest was ready. Thank you very much for sharing :)
Will definitely do it again...

This was a very easy recipe to make.  It sounds so elegant but so simple!  I decided to tie the tenderloin with thread to keep in together so it still looked like a log which was not such a good idea, because after cooking I couldn't find the thread, I think it's better to use thin string.  Also, after I was done cooking the meat there was no juices left to add to the gravy mix it had dried up, but it was fine I just made the gravy as directed on the package.  This recipe was very good the meat was so tender!

I browned it before baking but other than that I followed the recipe. I used Franzia Merlot instead of a burgundy (yeah, I'm fancy).  I thought it turned out nicely.  I like the taste of red wine in my food but I can see how you might not like it if you don't like wine...

This was delicious, super moist and easy. followed the recipe to the T except I used a whole pork loin which as nearly 5# and we grilled it in the BGE. Normally we do a dry rub and use a V rack, but following the directions, I set the loin in the pan, lined with grilling foil and added about 2# of small potatoes, a dozen baby bella mushrooms and the onion/celery combo. Topped it with the 2cups of wine (despite the fact my pork loin was more than twice the size of the recipe, I stuck with the recipe's measurements, grilled it for almost 2hours at 325-350. Took it out, pulled the loin out of the pan, added the gravy sauce, and voila, 3 minutes later, we had an amazing dinner. I did let it set 10-20minutes before we got around to slicing it. Served with broccoli and snap peas. This recipe was better than our usual prep method because it was less mess, even more tender and juicy than normal and our kids loved the outside as much as we did. I used super cheap merlot.

This simple recipe got me rave reviews from my boyfriend. He went on and on about how delicious it was the whole time he was eating it and said he'd be happy to eat it as often as I felt like making it. I served this with the pan-fried asparagus with onions from this site and he raved about that as well. 
I read the reviews for the pork and decided to sear the tenderloins first for more appealing color, use 1 c. burgundy and 1 c. beef broth, and I added baby bella mushrooms. Since my grocery store only had 1 lb. tenderloins, I used two of those and they were done in 35 minutes which left my celery slightly crunchy, so next time I'll do a smaller dice on the celery. Wonderful recipe!!!

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now and it is my go-to for special occasions. It is super easy to make, takes probably 5 min to prep and an hour in the oven to be completely cooked. The only thing I did differently is basically up everything for a larger meal for a family of 4 with some leftovers (if ANY is left over): I buy one pork tenderloin from Walmart and use both the pieces in the package (about 3 lbs) and stick them in a large 9x13 glass baking dish. I use 1 teaspoon of the salt, black pepper and the garlic powder instead of a half. I slice up a full small onion, omit the celery, use 2 packages of the brown gravy mix and pour a WHOLE bottle of Manischewitz Concord Grape Wine over everything! It's sweet and smells great when it's cooking! I cook it for an hour on the nose, remove it and put it in a separate dish. I pour the wine and onions into a sauce pan with the dry gravy and bring it to a boil, then serve it on top of the pork. MMMMM... so good!!!

Very nice!  The pork was cooked perfectly, and the flavor of the gravy was delicious.  We would have this again.

Very, very good! I did it in the slow cooker and it came out just great! It is a little salty with the brown gravy mix, so I would suggest editing out some of the salt that gets rubbed on the tenderloin.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I didn't have celery (decreased regular salt and threw in some celery salt instead).  I used a cabernet, since that was all I had on hand.  I cooked it about 55 minutes, and that was probably about 5 minutes too long.  (It was only at about 135 degrees after 45 minutes.)  I did flip the tenderloins over when I put it back in for that last 10 minutes.  I transferred the wine/drippings to a small saucepan to boil off a bit more of the alcohol (just in case) while adding the gravy mix.  Other reviewers have said the sauce didn't thicken up enough, but mine was fine this way, perfect gravy thickness with just one gravy packet.  The pork was maybe a bit on the bland side, but it was probably the most tender & moist pork I've ever made.

I made this tonight for the first time and my family raved about it.  I followed it pretty much as written except I used red Sangria as my red wine because that is all I had.  I also added one packet onion gravy mix along with the packet of brown gravy mix.  It was wonderful and so easy to make.  I did find that my onions were still a bit crispy so you may want to cook them a bit before baking with the meat.  I made with  two other recipes from this site Honey Roasted Red Potatoes and Pan fried asparagus.  Made a nice meal.

I modded this a bit, i mixed it all up and marinated for 1-2 hours before cooking. Then cooked for 45 mins at 350, followed by 1 hour, at 150, basting it occasionally. Strained off onions etc with a colander, made the gravy, re added the onions etc..  It came out AMAZING!!

It was just okay.  Per other reviews, I cut the wine in half and subbed beef broth for the other half and the wine taste was still plenty strong.  I can't imagine using the full wine amount.  I also browned the meat first.

I loved this. It was so simple to make and delicious. I ommitted the celery because my husband doesnt like and next time I think I will try to add mushrooms. The gravy was thin more like the consistancy of au jus so next time I will try two packets. Thank you!

Yum!  This was so good, I almost couldn't stop myself from eating all of it!  I admit that I added carrot to create a mirepoix and "accidentally" used more than 2-cups of wine (Merlot).  Since there was more liquid, I needed to add about half of a second package of brown gravy mix to make the sauce rich and tasty.

Nice and easy and definitely on my favorites list.

I tried this recipe the other night when I was looking for something uncomplicated and tasty.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and no celery, since I had none on hand.  I also threw in some mushrooms.

I served it with smashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  My family loved it.  Will definitely be making it again!

this was delicious!  I made it as stated except I left off the celery (didn't have any) and I did sear the pork before baking.  My kids loved it and the gravy was fabulous!  I served it with baked potatoes, biscuits, and broccoli for an excellent dinner.

Smelled sooo good while cooking, extremely easy to make as well. 9 yr old hated it, said it had no flavor whatsoever. Hubby scarfed it down, but said no to leftovers, I said thought it was ok but not worth making again.

I was so upset with this. I was looking forward to it but maybe I went wrong somewhere. The cooking time didn't seem long enough to cook off the wine and we felt a little "funny" after eating it. Good thing the kids took one bite and said "nope" don't want to eat that. Although I realize it could have been a mistake somewhere on my part I sure won't attempt it again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I omitted the celery and baked it a little bit longer.  The pork was so tender and very flavorful.  Thanks for this amazing dish!  I can't wait to make it again!

This is the best pork tenderloin recipe ever!  This has now became a staple in our household.  I used one cup red wine and one cup beef broth and it came out fabulously!! Thanks Browndog for such a delicious and easy recipe, I am grateful!!!!

Wow. This was fantastic. I didn't change anything and I used Llano Estacado Sweet Red American Table Wine - $6.99 a bottle. The meat is so tender and juicy. It's a very light taste and the wine is pretty good.

First off, I am NOT a fan of pork... but this was actually REALLY good! The pork was tender & moist, and the gravy was heavenly! I would've given it 5 stars, but it was a touch too salty.  Next time I'll see if there is a lower sodium gravy mix. Definitely use burgundy wine as the title suggests!

This was delicious! I prepared with the suggestions i saw in the reviews using half the wine 2 packages brown gravy and beef broth and the tenderloin was moist and flavorful. Next time i make this i will omit the celery which really offers nothing to the dish and add mushrooms as others have suggested. I also will try with burgundy wine.

Incredibly easy to make. Followed the suggestions of fellow reviewers and used 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup burgundy/pinot noir wine and it came out perfectly. Might have eliminated a couple of lumps if I mixed the dry brown gravy mix separately with less broth first though, I had a few clumps in the sauce.

I needed a quick, easy recipe, and this fit the bill!  I used a mandolin for super thin onion slices and doubled the gravy mix for a thicker sauce - lovely!

My BF really liked this, which totally surprised me because he typically does not care for wine sauces.  Go figure.  I thought it was ok-good, actual pork loin was a little blah for me, but he likes things that way.  I did follow the recipe and used a red wine (merlot, as per others reviews) but I think next time I will try it with a burgundy as the title suggests.  BF gave it 5 stars, I gave it 3.... hence 4.

This was very good!! I didn't have celery, but it was still delicious. I also used 2 cloves fresh garlic rather than powder and added a little italian seasoning and olive oil to coat the pork better.

I cooked this for my family and everybody loved it!  However, I did follow the advice from previous reviews.  I had a 4 lb roast so I knew the cooking time would be longer.  First I seasoned my roast with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and fresh ground black pepper.  Then I browned the roast in a little olive oil for about 2-3 mins per side.  I omitted the onion and celery.  I used 1 1/2 cups burgundy wine with 1 cup beef broth.  My total cooking time ended up being around 1 1/2 hours and I only ended up with about 1 cup of juices.  This wouldn't have made enough gravy for potatoes as it was just enough for the meat.  I used 1 gravy packet plus added some wonder flour to help thicken the gravy.  The gravy was too salty for my taste so next time I'll season it myself instead of using the gravy packet.  Overall, turned out very good though!

I browned it first after rubbing with Lawry's and garlic salt.  Browned the onions with the meat.  Forgot to add the celery, used some leftover Cabernet Sav. and no gravy mix.  It makes a great au jus .  Husband absolutely loved it so I know I can make it again.  This being the week after Thanksgiving, we were all turkeyed out.

I've made this twice and I don't know what I did wrong, but I followed the directions completely and it didn't turn out either time. Gravy was very bitter. Think I may give up making this since I've wasted two good bottles of wine. :(

Simple to fix, tender, and incredibly flavorful! This recipe is sensational and presents well on the plate. I omitted celery and used honeycrisp apple slices instead.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach.

I've been making this for over a year and I love this recipe and so does everyone I've made it for! I follow the recipe almost exact. The only thing I do differently is no onion or celery. For the wine I usually use which ever merlot is cheapest (cab is good too) and let the meat marinate in it for a half hour before cooking. Never substitute water for the wine in the gravy! Thats what makes it so delicious! And it tastes great over mashed potatoes! Like the other reviewers said...use a meat thermometer cause the meat will still appear pinkish/purple when its done. Enjoy!!

REALLY yummy & REALLY easy!!! Followed recipe with exception of adding the celery - as I didnt have on hand. My two tenderloins weighed a little over the two pounds, and I cooked for 45 minutes at 350 and they were not 160 degrees yet, so turned up the heat to 375 and cooked for another 15 minutes and they were perfect! Extrememly tender - got rave reviews!! Will definitely make this again and again!

Excellent recipe, the kids (picky eaters) were using their fingers to get all the gravy off their plates. I made a minor modification - our pork roast was 5lbs, we have a large family, so all the amounts were increased (and the cooking time increased to 2 hrs at 325) also instead of 2 1/4 packets of brown gravy - I used two and then used a 1/4 of french onion soup and 1  cup water. We'll definitely make this again, thank you!

This IS as easy and delicious as everyone says.  My fiance and I loved it and the presentation is great.  I served with mashed potatos and prepared as the recipe instructs.  I do not think it needs to be braised first and I absolutely do think that the celery and onions add to the recipe. Also, any red wine will do.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I fixed this for my husband and me.  We both thought it was fantastic.  I served it to guests and it was a tremendous hit.  They felt I served them a gourmet dinner!  I served it with brown rice and had added mushrooms and carrot sticks to the onions and wine to bake so the sauce was a bit more substantial with the added veggies.  It was wonderful.  I'm serving it to guests again tonight.  It is now our "go to" meat for company.  A real keeper of a recipe.

I have been making this recipe for several years and often serve it to company.  I omit the celery and add lots of baby portabella mushrooms.  I cut the wine down to one cup and add a can of beef broth. Due to the additional liquid, I add a little cornstarch to thicken.  This makes a little more gravy to go with the mashed potatoes I serve with it.  Wonderful!

This is my first time making Pork Tenderloin, and I was a bit concerned, since I had a guest coming for dinner. But this came out fabulous.  The only change I made was that I marinated the pork overnight in the first couple of ingredients (salt, pepper, garlic powder, and red wine).  This came out so good, I will be passing it on to others and making it again.

The pork was very tender and perfectly cooked and the presentation was nice. However, while it was good and we enjoyed it, the sauce was a little heavy and the overall end-product seemed a bit generic. I am glad I tried the recipe. It was well-received in general, but it lacked that extra something that would persuade me to cook it again.

This was amazing.  Think I might of cooked it a little too long, but still good.  I need a new meat thermometer, once that is purchased I will def. make this again.

This was pretty good.  The sauce was really good but the roast was not very tender and did not have a lot of flavor, but that may have been the roast or technique, and not the recipe.  We will definitely try this again

This recipe was so super simple and fantastic!  It totally beats getting any of those pork tenderloins that are already "seasoned".  Get a nice quality tenderloin and you'll be all set with this simple and very delicious recipe.  I did not use the celery or garlic salt because I didn't have any.  I did add a couple cloves of minced garlic to the wine and onions though.  Try this recipe!

Followed directions pretty much. no 9x13 pan available so I used an 8x8. Pork came out tender, but did have to cook it an additional 7 mins or so. DH wasn't a fan of the wine sauce. thanks for the recipe though! It was super easy!

Delicious!  My husband really enjoyed this tenderloin.  I didn't have any Burgundy wine, so I used marsala cooking wine.  It was yummy!  I also added mushrooms and omitted onion and celery because I didn't have them on hand.

I only used 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth.  Then when making the gravy we used cornstarch and water to thicken and my husband added salt and sugar to taste.  Everyone loved this.  I am so happy to find a pork recipe that is still juicy at the end of cooking.  Delicious.

After reading all of the suggestions I just went ahead and followed the original recipe (although I made sure to slice the celery and onions thinly). I've made this twice now and both my husband and I think it's fabulous! I also tried adding mushrooms in with the celery and onions - delicious! Oh, and I didn't bother straining out the veggies when I made the gravy, I just put the meat aside and made the chunky gravy right in the roasting pan on the stovetop. Thanks for the excellent recipe! :)

Loved it!  I wanted enough for lots of leftovers, so I used a 4.25 lb. boneless pork loin roast.  I doubled the amount of pepper and garlic powder, but left the salt at 1/2 a tsp.  I put the meat (cut in 2 pieces to fit)on a trivet in the crockpot and topped with 1/2 and onion and 2 stalks chopped celery and 1 pkg of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I mixed the packet of brown gravy mix and the 2 cups of burgundy wine together and poured it over everything.  I cooked it on High for 5 hours (160 on the meat thermometer).  Just before serving, I ladled the sauce into a pan and thickened on the stovetop using Wondra flour (about 1 TBSP?) to make gravy.  I served it over mashed potatoes and with green beans.  It was wonderful!  Next time, I may also put baby carrots on the bottom of the crock pot under the trivet.  You know the meals a hit when the kids are asking if they can eat the leftovers for breakfast!

This is fantastic! I made it with Pinot Noir wine as that is what I had in the house and it turned out great!  I couldn't use onions as my father in law doesn't like them so I secretly sprinkled some onion powder on instead and added 8 oz baby portabello mushrooms which I sauted before added to the meat.  I did sear the pork too and I am glad I did as it looked wonderful.  I served with roasted potatoes, cauliflower and carrots and there was none left of anything!

I had been baking the pork tenderloin (1.75 lb) for 45 min. at 350F and yet it was still raw when I cut into it.  I had all my sides ready to be served and then I had to cook it longer.  Would really suggest re-thinking the cooking time on this dish!

This was good but not overly flavorful.  Given the simplicity though, I rate it high.  I have other more flavorful pork tenderloin recipes but they take more time and effort.

YUM!  I added fresh mushrooms with a little onion powder.  This did take longer to get done than listed, but that was not a problem.  I tossed in the  extra packet of gravy mix that many suggested & then made a  thickening with butter & flour. I sliced  the meat into medallions and let it simmer in the gravy for a few minutes.  Excellent served with roasted potatoes.

This was excellent!!  All four kids loved it!  Not to mention that it was so easy to make!  The only thing I would change was the cooking time.  The directions said to cook it 45 minutes, but I had to put it in for another 15-20 minutes.  Other than that I will definitely be making it again!

I made this hoping for a really amazing dish, but was disappointed.  The sauce was INCREDIBLY salty, so much so that I had to nearly a cup of cream to make it edible.  I know I didn't mix up the salt amounts either.  The pork was pretty juicy, but the sauce was nothing to write home about.

This was good though a tad salty. I will blame that on using Cooking wine instead of real red wine. They always add salt to that stuff. I should have omitted the salt recipe called for . Otherwise it was quite easy and very tender.

this recipe is fantastic! i used boneless pork chops instead of the ternderloin because it was leaner, and used celery seed instead of chopped celery, but this was still excellent. the results kind of smell and look like salsbury steak because of the gravy mixture, but it is excellent. will definately be making this again! thanks for the great recipe!

My entire family loved this!  I don't care for pork myself and I found it quite tasty.  I did cut back on the wine and used half beef broth, because my kids tend to fuss about too much wine flavor.  If it were just me and the hubby, I would have used what it called for.  It would have been perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very nice!  We liked this one a lot!  I prepared this in stages, rubbing the pork with salt, pepper and garlic, topped it with onion, let it rest for a couple of hours, added the red wine about an hour prior to putting it into the oven, turning it once.  I'm also no stranger to a red wine gravy.  My derivation of this is to one packet of dry, brown gravy mix, add 1/2 cup of red wine (in this case the wine drippings from the cooked tenderloin), 1/2 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of prepared horseradish, heat, stir until thick.  This adds a really nice kick!

Great for entertaining since you can make it ahead of time. Served it with store bought mashed potatoes, green vegetable and salad and had plenty of time to enjoy my guests. Very impressive and easy.

This was an excellent tenderloin that I will definitely make again. I made some changes to the recipe, however. On the advice of others, I used 1 cup wine (cabernet) and 1 cup low sodium beef broth. I also added 1/2 tsp rosemary and 1/2 tsp thyme. Instead of garlic powder, I chopped up 4 cloves of garlic. I omitted the celery, and sauteed some mushrooms and onion which I added in the pan before putting the tenderloin in the oven. While I did use the 1/2 tsp salt, I will omit it next time because the recipe did not need it, between the sodium in the broth and in the gravy mix (which was too salty). To make the gravy, I added some extra water to the wine/beef broth after the tenderloin was cooked since there wasn't enough liquid and then only added 1/2 packet of the brown gravy mix because it was way too salty. It didn't thicken up as much as I wanted so I used some corn starch to do the trick. I had 2lbs of tenderloin and it took about 45 min to cook. It was wonderful, even without the gravy.

It was so juicy... i didnt use any salt because the meat was already salted and I was able to find low sodium brown gravy mix! It was so yummy!

This recipe is ok, nothing special. I made some changes after reading reviews: before baking, I seared the pork until browned on all sides. I replaced 1 cup of the wine with 1 cup of beef broth, and added a bay leaf. The gravy was WAY too salty, maybe there is a low sodium packet out there. I will try making it again, this time I will sear the meat a bit longer, cook it for a shorter amount of time (the meat turned out dry and slightly tough) and will NOT ADD SALT. I will do anything to decrease the saltiness of that gravy. All in all, a decent recipe that needs to be tweaked to work.

This recipe is wonderful. The only thing that I changed was putting everything into the crock pot, and left out the celery. (I'm not a celery fan) I thickened it "from scratch" since it's easy -- having bought a book on sauces, salsa, etc. that was on sale. In a later meal, I fixed some burgundy pork rice pilaf. There are so many variations for different meals that you can do with this recipe -- stir fry, baked veggies with pork, sandwiches, loaded pork-n-beans. I put some in the freezer for later use. We will definitely use this recipe for pork again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely fabulous.  Made exactly as stated and what a treat.  I served with mashed potatoes, whole green beans and a salad.  Wonderfully delicious and very easy.  I will make again for sure.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because of the ease of preparation.  The recipe calls for 45 minutes of cooking time. This I found was way off of the mark. We like our pork on the pink side, but at 45 minutes, the pork was still raw.  Before I think to try this again, (and I would only do so because of the ease of it), I will have to go over it again, and figure out what changes I will make. Instead of a burgundy, I might go with a Shiraz or a Pinot Noir. We found the Burgundy to be on the strong side, and the flavour over powered the pork way too much.

The instructions didn't indicate whether to cover or not cover.  I compromised and covered for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered for the last 15. I turned the pork over too, so the whole tenderloin would be purple :) The amount of liquid (2 cups) was too much for what my gravy packet needed (1 cup), so I needed to thicken after I strained off the celery & onions. I added kitchen bouquet to make it look a bit more brown ("Why is the gravy purple, Mom?" was still asked since I made sure to use Burgundy)I made mashed potatoes to share the gravy. Fruity aroma and strong wine taste, which is good.  I'd make this again.

Ya, i can see how some people would say that it is a bit salty.  However, we had it the second day and the herb flavors really came out.  I added a couple of sprigs of rosemary to it which really made a difference.  Also, I changed out the garlic salt for fresh garlic.

This was a hit with my 16 month old and my husband!!  I steamed the veggies I had in the fridge and made the scalloped potato recipe (from this site) and it was gone in 5 minutes.  Changes I made were to add two cups of beef broth as suggested (no wine at all).  I also sauted the onion and mushrooms and seared the meat on both sides.  VERY tender.  Will most definitely make again!

I made this last night for dinner. I used 1 cup Red wine/1 cup beef broth. I used some sliced shallots and No celery. I did buy one packet of gravy mix, and I had to dig through my cabinets to find another, which it needed to thicken up for a decent gravy. Yes, you could of used some flour. All in all, the pork came out pretty good. Would I make it again, like this? Not so sure. It was only Ok, in my eyes.

The only thing I didn't have was the celery, but I don't think having it would have saved this dish. Maybe it was the cheap Merlot I used, but I found the spices heavy, the sauce thin, and the peculiar odor/slight taste of "liver" unappetizing. We won't be making this again.

This tasted really good and was easy to prepare.  The gravy did not thicken well.  I will try adding an extra packet or cooking it on the stovetop for a few minutes next time to thicknen it up.

This was yummy! However, when I added the gravy mix to the "wine sauce" mixture after taking the tenderloin out to rest, the gravy never turned into a thick consistency. So it turned out to be a great pork tenderloin, with an unidentified gravy sauce on it. Next time, I will either nix the gravy portion, or take it out of the baking dish and fix the gravy in a saucepan over heat to help it thicken.

This was great!  Even my 2 year old had 4 helpings!  I left out onions and celery (don't like them) and used 1 cup burgundy cooking wine and 1 cup beef broth in place of 2 c red wine.

This recipe turned out great!  The tenderloin was so moist!  I added a few carrots to the red wine before baking and I used a recipe for brown gravy mix I already had:  1/4 cup cornstarch, 3 beef bouillon cubes, 1/4 teaspoon instant coffee crystals, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper and a pinch of paprika.  VERY, VERY YUMMY!!!  I served this with another recipe on allrecipes.com:  garlic red potatoes.  The whole family loved it!!!

Good, but not great!  Pork is very tender, but the sauce could be improved.  Lacking in flavor and never thickened up.

This recipe was great!  I served it for company last night and got rave reviews!  It was moist and very flavorful.  Since I didn't have any red wine on hand so I used beef broth instead.  There was plenty of meat juices to make a flavorful homemade gravy too!  Definitely a keeper!

I've been wanting to try this recipe for awhile and finally made it last night.  It was great!!!  I pretty much followed the directions, but I did add mushrooms (I think next time I'll saute them before adding and add later in the cooking process).  I ended up not making the gravy with it, but I definitely think that I'll do that next time although it was still quite flavorful without it.  I cooked almost exactly 45 minutes and served it with baked potatoes and broccoli.  We really liked this recipe and I'll definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years... and every single time it's just as good as the last! It's quite impressive for being so simple, too! I don't always have celery on hand, but it comes out just as good without it. Sometimes I'll sprinkle on just a little celery seed for the flavor instead of using fresh celery.   This is one of the most reliably fantastic pork tenderloin recipes I have. It always comes out tender and juicy and absolutely delicious!

This is a very good recipe.  I used 1/2 wine, 1/2 beef broth, like other suggested and I used fresh garlic instead of powdered.  I also cut up mushrooms and put them on top the loins while they were cooking.  After they finished cooking, I poured everything into a saucepan, added 2 packets of gravy mix and brought it to a boil.  It simmered for a couple minutes to thicken, and then I served it up with the pork, buttered noodles and spinach.  Very yummy!

This was really good.  I only left out the celery (personal preference) and made it in the crockpot instead of the oven.  It practically melted in your mouth.  I'll definitely make it again.

Good flavor, but it wasn't very pretty.  For a side I made mashed potatoes with rosemary. Eatting them together I thought the meat could have used some rosemary too.

I loved this recipe! I did modify it, because I'm pregnant and have no alcohol in the house. I used 2 cups of beef broth with a capful of red wine vinager and then 1/2 cup of cranberry/raspberry juice. I also added a pinch of rosemary and used fresh garlic. Husband declared that it tasted like "restaurant food" which was a compliment! I used the leftover gravy the next day over beef tips and carrots in my slow cooker and that was awesome. I highly recommend this one.

This was incredible and very easy. Next time I might use a little less wine though. I also will not cook the potatos along side the roast, they just soaked up the wine and were not too tasty! I did not think the gravy mixed thickened the sauce enough so I added a couple of table spoons for powdered "demi glaze"...I'll definitely make this again.

Used 1/2 wine and 1 cup chicken stock.  Added onions and mushroom.  Very jucy and tender.

This is a great easy recipe. I did not have any brown gravy mix so I just used the liquid from the pan and thickened it with the old cornstarch method, I can't wait to try it the correct way. I give this 5 stars without trying the brown gravy so I wish there were 6 stars for when I do it right.

Given all the wonderful reviews, I was really disappointed in this dish. The gravy was absolutely fabulous but the pork was NOT tender. Maybe the dish needed to be covered... the recipe didn't say one way or the other.

This recipe was pretty darn good, especially for how easy it was to make.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I omitted the onion and celery.  Next time I think I might try some beef broth in with the wine while cooking.

This was very easy and really a hit. I also sprinked my pork with s&p and some thyme, then browned it lightly in a skillet first.  To the skillet I added minced shallots, 1 c. red wine, garlic, and because I had it handy, the juice from a can of Campbells French Onion soup. I did not have a packet of gravy on hand, so I thickened it in a saucepan with cornstarch/water.  My husband loved the gravy and could tell it was something different (and better). I will definately make this again and again!

Having made this, I can understand why some suggested braising it in a pan first. I think it would be more aesthetically pleasing with a nice crisp exterior.

However, the taste, without braising, was delicious!!! Tender juicy and flavorful!

Since kids were going to be eating this too and I thought that the wine taste might be a little strong for them, I took anothers suggestion and used 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth. I diced shallots instead of slicing onions and I added sliced mushrooms.

I think that next time I'll forgo the celery as it just didn't really seem to fit.

With it I served au gratin potatoes (hubby's fave, and this was for his b-day), fresh green beans sauteed in diced bacon and shallots, apple sauce and beer bread and got rave reviews! :)

Outstanding!!!  The pork came out very tender and the gravy was out of this world. This was such any easy recipe and the end result was fantastic.  This is great for a dinner party when you want to wow guests with minimal effort.  Thank you for posting it!!

The hubby loved this one!

Some notes -

* I used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  I cut slits in the pork loin and put the garlic in the slits
* The gravy wasn't thickening up the way the recipe said it would, so I put the pork juice/wine in a small sauce pan with the gravy mix and brought it to a boil.
*Follow the temp and time directions exactly - it comes out at about medium and is very tender

New to real cooking my kids are so picky, they both loved it oh my gosh the gravy was the bomb, I had no idea that it was easy to cook in such a short time and have such a result. Served with green beans and a sour dough bread and long grain rice recipe. Meal cost less than $15 WOW thanks

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving in addition to a turkey.  I did as others suggested and added mushrooms and omitted the celery.  I bought a pork tenderloin that I thought was 2 lbs but was actually 2- 1 lb pieces.  So I cut the cooking time.  the tenderloin was moist and tender, but the "gravy" was not good at all.  The pork was bland and didn't have a lot of flavor.  I would NOT make this again at all.

Very very good. Have made this a few times. Don't go el-cheapo on the wine. Make sure it's one you would drink. Makes a big difference.

Flavorful and tender pork!  I used 1c wine (Pinot Noir, I think any light red would work, however I think Cabernet Sauvignon might be too "winey") mixed with 1 cup water for the gravy.  The brown gravy packets have a lot of salt in them already which may be why others who substituted with beef broth may have thought it was too salty?  It really is a matter of personal taste I guess!  Cooking time needed was a bit longer (1 1/2 hrs as opposed to 45 min), otherwise very easy and really delicious.

I just married the pickiest eater in the world! Needless to say... impressing my husband is a very hard task. HOWEVER, this dish totally did the job! This is so easy to make and the flavor is awesome. 

Thanks for sharing, we will definitely be making this in the near future!

This is a great pork tenderloin dish and has become my husband's favorite.  I normally only like my tenderloin grilled and this changed it for me.  I didn't add the celery, but added fresh mushroom that I quartered instead. I also browned the meat before baking it. Although I am not sure if it made a difference.  One review said it would avoid the meat turning pink and it didn't.  Can't wait to make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting 1 cup of wine with 1 cup of chicken broth and it was excellent! I think 2 cups of wine would have been to "winey" for our tastes. I also seared the meat on a hot skillet before baking. The meat was so tender, def making it again!

This was a VERY good recipe!  I didn't use the celery or onion (after reading some of the other reviews).  What I did use in place of the celery was the portobello mushrooms.  In place of the salt, I substituted it with Accent.  Finally, I cut the wine in 1/2 and used chicken broth for the other 1/2 of the wine portion that the recipe called for.

The family simply loved it!

Really, really good!

Thanks again....

Pork was tender and moist.  Wasn't cooked after 45" at 350, so added 15" at 400 degrees.  Topped with chopped garlic, coarse salt, ground pepper, sliced onion, and burgundy wine.  Didn't bother to make the gravy... the drippings were adequate for a light sauce.  Served with roasted red potato, and baby carrots sauteed in butter and brown sugar; the sweetness was a nice compliment to the tenderloin.

Very good, but the pork itself was missing flavor.  I think next time i will marinade the pork first in garlic & other seasonings for a few hours before cooking.  The sauce was EXCELLENT though!!

This was the best and easiest recipe I have tried yet!  My husband and 9 yr. old son LOVED it!  The only thing I didn't add was the celery and I did use a little cornstarch to help thicken the sauce.  I made some red potatoes and asparagus and served the wine gravy over the pork and the potatoes.  I left the onions in the wine when I made the gravy-it didn't make a difference.  The dish looked and tasted like something you would order at a 5 star restaurant!  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought the flavor was good but my "sauce" turned out very thin.  I think two packages of brown gravy would be better than 1, and also maybe some cornstarch or flour.

This was super tasty!  I let the tenderloin, onions and two cans of mushrooms sit in the wine and spices for a couple of hours before cooking it.  When I put it in the baking dish to cook, I sprinkled a little extra garlic powder and pepper on top of the meat since the wine had washed it off.  The mushrooms soaked up the wine and were so delicious!  I also used two packs of brown gravy mix as others had suggested.  It tasted great and went very well with the mashed potatoes I also cooked.  I will definitely be making this again!  Dee-lish-us!!!

This recipe is amazing! The pork was so moist and tender that it could have passed for roast beef. I think when I make it again in the future however I  will use mushrooms instead of celery. I'm not sure what purpose the celery served but everyone that I made this for ended up pushing it aside.

This is pretty good, but I don't think the gravy part is necessary.  The wine seems to do a good enough job.  VERY tender and delicious.

The pork was so tender! I made a number of substitutions using what I had on hand. I used (two) packaged pepper garlic marinated tenderloins (18 oz ea.), skipped seasoning. Next time I'll chop the onions. Only had white wine and chicken broth and a pkg of beef boullion mixed with approx. 3 Tbls. corn starch. Wrapped pork in foil and left in 170 degree oven while I brought the liquid to a boil. Added small can sliced mushrooms (rinsed) and 3 large fresh mushrooms sliced. Thanks for a new easy way to cook pork.

Very good!  I've made this several times now, because my husband requests it a lot.  The first time I made as written.  The next time I omitted the celery and onion as another reviewer suggested, and it's true -- it doesn't affect the flavor all that much and eliminates straining the vegetables out.  Very good, great easy meal.

5 stars for ease of preparation and a really good taste!  I seared the meat first and then used 2c port (gotta use port!) and 2c beef broth.  I also threw in 2 small cans of mushrooms (fresh would be delightful!)  In 40 minutes it was moist and flavorful and you could cut the meat with a butter knife.  We'll definitely make this again (and again, and again, and again)

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous- the gravy was amazing. The pork turned purple from the wine so I just covered it up with the gravy. Who cares though, everyone raved about it! Very tender!

I was very pleased with this easy recipe.  I always ask my husband to provide the rating and he says this one is a 5 star!  I used 2 garlic cloves instead of the powder and added a diced carrot to the mix.  I did not have a package of gravy mix so I simply made a roux with butter and flour to thicken the gravy.  I served this with roasted red potatoes with olive oil and fresh rosemary.

Just fixed this tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit. My 9 year old who hates meat, ate all of hers WITH the gravy, which is also something she normally never will touch. I did use the onion and celery and just strained it out when I fixed the gravy. I didn't have any red wine so I used about a cup of cooking Sherry and added water. Worked great!

AMAZING! Everyone raved about this dish. It turned out so well and it was beyond simple to put together. I left out the onion and celery and ended up using two gravy packages. Definitely a keeper.

Very good, however I made several changes: as per other reviewers, I omitted salt, used half chicken broth, and cooked longer. Also, I seared tenderloin before baking and while preparing sauce, I covered meat with tented foil. To thicken sauce, I poured it into a saucepan and boiled a few min. I also liked the suggestion of adding a tablespoon of sour cream to make it creamier. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

Good recipe. I made some of the changes that others did. I elimnated the salt, rubbed the tenderloin w/garlic powder and pepper then pan seared it. I actually minced the celery, but didn't notice that they really enhanced the recipe. I also used one cup of chicken broth and one cup of wine as I felt the wine might be too much. The tenderloin had to back for almost an hour, but it was so tender. I added two packets of gravy to the mix. My only problem was eliminating the salt (my own choice after reading reviews), and it needed it. Not enough flavor if you take out the salt. Overall, pretty good. I have a better recipe that I'll add to this site.

My first review! We really loved this recipe – though there were some changes.
I seared the meat in a sauce pan before going into the 9 x 13 dish.  I thought 2 cups wine was a lot so I went with others and did 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth but I didn’t have any broth in the house…I had an opened package of  Lipton’s French Onion Soup though (the recipe maker!) and it turned out great! Used that with one cup water and 1 cup (cheap) Merlot. I scattered the celery and the thinly sliced onion over top but they did not tenderize very nicely at all. They will be ‘sweated’ next time I make this dish. We really enjoyed this dish with mashed potatoes and peas. I definitely think I can serve this to company!

This recipe was wonderful!  It only takes minutes to put it together and it's ready for the oven.  I did substitute one cup beef broth for one cup wine and that worked out well.  I may try adding mushrooms to the gravy next time.  My husband simply loved this dish even though he does not like pork.  I will make this again and again!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I typically try recipes that have many good ratings as this one did. There was a very bad taste to this recipe.  I think it was ruined by the packaged gravy.

This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it once, so far, and am making it again for a dinner party. Definitely use more brown gravy mix to make extra for mashed potatoes (it's sooo good on them). The only thing I'm going to do differently this time is pan sear the meat a bit, before puttting in oven, for presentation only. The pork looks a little pale, otherwise. This is a great easy main dish that looks and tastes very elegant!

I made this for my family when they were in town for Thanksgiving. The only change I made was that I made a package of the gravy according to the directions on it and added that to the pan of wine/gravy. It was perfect and I was glad I did that as the wine would have been overpowering otherwise. Everyone loved it and my mom took several copies of the recipe.

Wow!  This was so good.  Mine was smaller but took a bit longer to cook so I would advise using a meat thermometer.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, which I think is a good idea in all situations.  Amazing flavor will make over and over again!!

I made the recipe exactly as written and did not like it at all. It was way too salty and we all hated the sauce. Very upset that we ruined good pork tenderloin for this.

Very easy and great taste. Used 1 c. red wine and 1 c. beef broth; no onions or celery.  Did add crushed dried rosemary.  Nice flavor.

I made this for dinner tonite and it was delicious! I will say I was aliitle nervous when it started to cook because it didn't smell very good, but it did not mean a thing!! The only thing I did different was followed anothers advice about using 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of beef broth. It  was really good. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a dinner part my DH and I held last night and it was a hit!  The dish was so quick and easy to put together and the end result was a very moist flavourful tenderloin.  I did change the recipe based on other reviews though; I used 1 cup of red wine and 1 cup of beef broth.  The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is because the package of brown gravy mix wasn't nearly enough so I ended up having to make a slurry of flour and water to thicken the sauce at the last minute.  Next time I make this (and there likely will be a next time), I will not make quite so much sauce as there was way too much of it for the pork.

I did what reviews said and cut back on the wine, wasn't to fussy with the way it smelled when cooking. In the end it worked out great, sauce was very good and I should have doubled it. Thanks

I've never used gravy mix before and I don't think I will again.  It's far too salty for my taste even though I omitted the 1/2 tsp. salt.  I used 1 cup cabernet and 1 cup low sodium beef broth, seared the tenderloin and then poured wine/broth over as directed.  Even though I replaced half the wine with beef broth, the pork took on a red tinge that was a little odd looking.  It was okay though once sliced.  I tasted the gravy (luckily) before serving and it was WAY too salty due to the gravy mix so I added another cup of broth to dilute it.  It was okay then, but as written I think this recipe calls for too much wine and is much too salty.

I was suprised at good this actually was.  When I got it out of the oven, it did not look very appetizing, but looked much better when it was sliced.  The gravy also did not look very appetizing because of the color, but once again, tasted quite good.  I scaled the recipe down because my tenderloin was 1 1/2 lbs, but still used the whole gravy mix.

This recipe wasn't bad, particularly if you're new to pork tenderloin, but it certainly wasn't the tastiest version of it I've ever had. I did minced garlic rather than powder, Montreal Steak Seasoning rather than S&P, and 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth. I also added a can of mushrooms and a sliced onion, as suggested. I then made a roux to make the gravy. It was OK, but I'll probably stick to marinating my pork in a balsamic-based vinaigrette and grilling in the future.

Like another reviewer, I browned the tenderloin first, then put it in the crockpot for several hours on low.  I also added plenty of fresh mushrooms.  The sauce was wonderful and next time, I will double it.  Thanks for the easy, but great recipe.

This has to be the best pork recipe I've tasted...and so easy.  You really do get to "sit back and accept the compliments".  It's being added to our Christmas Eve celebration this year because so many people have loved it.

This was fabulous! Based on other reviews, I used 1 c. red wine and 1 c. beef broth, and added sliced mushrooms w/ the celery & onions.  I served the mushrooms on the side (could have also returned them to the finished gravy.) Also used meat thermometer as suggested by other reviewers. Definite keeper, will also be making this for company at some point. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Oh, YUM!  
The only changes I made were I browned the meat first, cooked it at 350, covered, for 20 minutes, then at 500 degrees for 10 minutes on each side.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

this is definately an easy recipe that doesn't take a whole lot of preparation, but overall we weren't impressed.  the seasoning seemed too light, and the final result came out dry (though it could have been the meat we used).  We weren't entirely disappointed, but I doubt we'll be doing this one again.

I changed this one around a little.  I used white wine instead of red and mushrooms instead of onions and celery.  I poured the wine and seasonings on top of the meat and then put the mushrooms in the wine around the pork and let marinate for a few hours.  The mushrooms were awesome and the meat was so juicy!

This is one of our favorite ways to prepare pork tenderloin.  I usually add sliced mushrooms along with the celery and onions as well.  There is a strong wine flavor to the sauce.  I think I might try the suggestion of other reviewers to use part beef broth and part wine.  I also think the idea of trying chardonnay instead of a red wine is a good one.  One of the main reasons I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the red wine turns the meat a purplish color.  It just seems strange to eat purple pork.  Overall though, this is a tasty, easy recipe.

This made the tenderloin very very tender and it had a nice flavor, but it didn't look very appetizing and the wine taste was very strong.  I think I'll add mushrooms next time.

While I enjoy drinking red wine, I'm not much of a fan of cooking with it.....this recipe is very good if you try using a mixture of one cup of Chardonnay and one cup of beef broth...it makes the color more appetizing and you still get the mild, but not overpowering, taste of wine...this also works well with a beef tenderloin.

Very nice, very simple, great sauce! I used garlice salt instead of powder (and skipped the regular salt, celery, and onion). My meat was probably a little thicker than the recipe was intended for because my cook time was longer. I used a glass baking dish, and when I mixed in the gravy to the red wine, it wasn't hot enough to thicken it. I couldn't heat that dish on the stove, so just poured the mixture into a small saucepan and brought it to a quick boil, and that did the trick.

To describe this recipe in one word....AWESOME!!  Talk about a "fix it and forget it" meal and then just whisk in a packet of brown gravy mix when the tenderloin is resting before carving....GEEEEZZ -- can't get any simplier than this one!  I baked homemade scalloped potatoes along with the roast and added at mealtime some sugar snap peas....Viola!  An elegant dinner is served!  Just a quick note:  My tenderloin was 3.5 pounds and I roasted it approximately 20 minutes to the pound and it turned out perfect (i.e. plenty of gravy)!

I believe if I had homemade brown gravey this recipe would be much better. We didn't care for this.

After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe a little and it was tasty and super moist! My husband absolutely loved it! I did brown the meat a couple minutes on the stove before putting in the pan. I left out the celery, and use 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup red wine.  I just used regular old red cooking wine which is probably why it was a bit salty after adding two packes of pork gravy. But I spooned in a little sugar and it worked great! Hubby says I definitely need to keep this recipe in regular rotation!

After reading some of the reviews of this recipe I really had high hopes for it.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Like one of the recent reviewers, our sauce did taste just like wine straight from the bottle ~ and my pork after over an hour was still slightly pink and tough.  I'll stick to other ways to prepare pork tenderloin.  Thanks anyway!

I made this last night. I used many suggestions that others had recommended and had good results, but I ended up with much less liquid for gravy than I expected from reading the reviews. I added one package of gravy mix (Knorr Roasted Pork) and had to add quite a bit of water to get a decent amount of sauce at the right consistency for three people. My husband and non-pork eating daughter liked it very much.

I had high hopes for this one.  But unfortunately, this recipe was bad.  The red wine sauce was just that.  Red wine.  The brown gravey mix did nothing to enhance the flavor.  It tasted as if it came straight from the wine bottle.  The meat was somewhat tender, though not "fall apart" as some reviewers mentioned.  In fact, the bottom half of the tenderloin (which was sitting in the wine while cooking) was the only part that was tender, though still chewy.  The top half was very dry.  I also doubled the cooking time (to a total of 1 hour and a half or so).  At 45 minutes, the cooking time stated in the recipe, the pork was still tough and pink inside.  I used a 1.5 pound tenderolin, smaller than the one called for, so I thought the cooking time would be perfect...not so.  My husband ate his portion, but said he wouldn't want this again.  The prep and clean up was easy, and pork tenderloin is a fairly inexpensive cut of meat, but bottom line, this recipe was not worth it.

Fantastic and easy to make. I browned the meat in some olive oil and fresh garlic, and seasoned with roasted garlic & red pepper seasonong. Did what others mentioned and cut the wine in half and added beef stock. I eliminated the celery, chopped the onion and added both Shitake and button mushrooms. Not a packaged gravy guy, I did add "hunters gravy' in a package and was pleasantly suprised. Definitely a keeper. I raved about it so much my neighbor is trying it tonite.

This recipe was outstanding!  I had a 3.25lb center cut loin so I added 1/3 of everything, plus the mushrooms as some reviewers suggested.  I found the taste delicious, my kids ate up the meat, too (they're not too crazy about sauces).  I will add the recommended 2 cups of wine next time rather than three for a thicker sauce.  Looking forward to sharing with company!

I've made this recipe several times and enjoyed it. Last time I made a french mirepoix which is finely diced veggies. I used onions,celery and carrots and sauteed them in a little oil til well well done but not browned. Bake tenderloin w/mirepoix poured in and continue as directed. You'll think you are eating in a fine french bistro!

I made this a month or so ago for my husband and me, using 2 long and thin pork loins--the kind you use for Chinese BBQ Pork.  It was fantastic!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Because of the particular cut of meat I used, it had absolutely zero fat.  I highly recommend using that cut.  Thanks for sharing, Kathleen.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fabulous!  My husband said it was great and he would like to have it again.  The next time I think I will add some mushrooms for something a little different.  Also, I needed to use 2 packages of gravy mix since I still had 2 cups of wine left after cooking the tenderloin.  Each package will do 1 cup of liquid.

I think how this dish turns out has a lot to do with the wine that you select.  We must've selected the wrong wine, and I didn't do the things other reviewers did to improve/fix this dish.  It turned out awful.

I have never rated a recipe on here before, but just had to this time. This recipe was awesome, I fixed it for my inlaws and they loved it. I took the suggestions of others and used 1/2 wine and 1/2 beef broth. I also added carrots and mushrooms. I did have to add some cornstarch to make it a bit thicker. I will make this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

What an easy way to make a burgundy sauce, with a packet of brown gravy mix! I love it and will never do it the old way again. Thank you, Kathleen!

I've always loved to dress up pork loin chops with a burgundy sauce. (I like the strong wine flavor of this myself, but yeah, you could make half of it beef boullion broth instead of red wine.)

To make this for loin chops, I just saute the onions, add sliced mushrooms after 10 mins or so and saute for another 5, then add the wine and simmer that down, add the gravy packet and thicken a bit, then pour over the cooked loin chops and simmer some more. Some good bread on the side is a must for sopping up that extra sauce. :)

Delicious!!! I took others' advice and used two packets of gravy, and also added mushrooms. The pork was so tender, and the gravy absolutely wonderful. I bought a good bottle of red wine for the gravy - it really does make all the difference.

Excellent!  I marinated the meat in 2 cups of Burgandy wine and 1 can of Beef broth for 5 hours, then removed the meat, but saved the marinade for the baking part of the recipe.  I then rubbed it with garlic salt, minced onion and some pepper.  I rubbed it with a bit of flour and seared the meat over medium high heat. After the 45 minutes were up I took a package of gravy, added 1/2 cup of the marinade, and 1/2 cup of water and used it as a side. My family loved this!

This had good flavor but too salty, I think a different cut of pork would suit the recipe better. I think loin is more suited to quick cooking to retain the moisture. I will try it with a roast that has more fat to baste the meat with so it comes out more tender. I used all broth and no wine, I've never liked wine and the flavor was great.

Almost 4 stars but I thought the onions and celery were too crunchy. Of course I also had a strong celery stalk so that may have contributed to the problem. I think next time I will saute the celery and onions along with mushrooms (which I did this time) for about ten minutes before adding to the baking dish. As others suggested, I used 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth. I also used a packet of pork gravy mix along with the brown gravy mix and I still could have had the sauce a bit thicker but it was very tasty served over white rice with a side of broccoli. My boyfriend loved it and we have enjoyed the leftovers almost as much as the freshly cooked. I sliced it up and let it sit in the gravy for super moist leftovers. Thanks for a different taste!

Wonder taste, quick to prepare, great presentation - what more could you want?  I will be using this as my "new" favorite tenderloin recipe.  Thanks Kathleen!

This was wonderful, but next time i would tak et eadvice of several other people and brown it first. The color was a little bit of a turn-off at first but once you slice it and put sauce on the pork, the color is completely forgotten.

The pork tenderloin was so tender, moist and very tasty.  I didn't add quite the entire envelope of brown gravy because it was too salty for my taste.  I had fresh asparagus and a baked potato with it and my husband loved it!

I used my Dutch quart oven to cook this while running errands.  This was some of the most tender meat I've ever eaten.  Because my husband is counting carbs, I left out the wine, but used the veggies and added ginger. It still was very tender and flavorful.

WOW! While my parents and my MIL were visiting over the Christmas Holidays, I made this dish for them. Now cooking for my parents can be a little unerving as they are both excellent cooks. My youngest son (I have 3 boys), age 10 does not eat "meat" as he does not like the texture, unless it is burger or chicken.  Well, this meal was a hit!  My little "Vegan" ate 3 helpings, as did my parents, MIL, husband and other 2 sons (they will eat anything though).  I will be making this many times again.

This really is delicious and very easy. I didn't use gravy mix, I just made the gravy with the liquid left over and addition liquid from the cooked potato & veggies and thickened it. Also, substituted the celery for mushrooms. Definitely will make again.

This was very tasty and very tender.  The gravy was not a big hit with my husband and step son, but the meat itself was great.  It also smelled wonderful when it was cooking.  A keeper.

I love this.  It is really stress free and tastes like you did a lot of work!  I use duplin county red wine (kinda sweet) and it is delicious.  My kids normally don't like pork and they love this!

Absolutely fabulous!  Remarkably easy and the final product is delectable.  My husband and 16 and 12 year old sons were arguing over who got the last pieces of beef!  It's definitely a keeper!

Wow! I served this for a dinner party the other night and my husband was FLOORED! He LOVED it and it was soooooo easy to prepare...He will actually work on his "honey do list" if I tell him I'm making it for dinner...Our guests were very impressed as well and they all think I'm some gourmet chef! This would be a $20.00 plate in an upscale restaurant - DELICIOUS!

Pork Tenderloin is my favorite but this did nothing for us.  Kids wouldn't touch the gravy but the pork was OK.

Too good of a cut of meat to waste on packaged gravy mix.

This was wonderful.  I substituted a bottle of unfriendly chardonay in place of the burgundy wine.  This was a hit at the dinner table served with mashed potatoes and creamed corn and a green salad.  My 95 year old Mother-in-law who is a very pickey eater enjoyed the dinner.

I didn't have wine on hand, so I used cream of celery and it was great!  Just another idea on what you can use.  I made the roasted red potatoes with this one.

My daughter didn't like this at all because of the "wine-y" taste.  Not surprising.  I would recommend cooking it covered for the first 20-25 minutes to prevent the wine from evaporating completely as it did when I cooked it.  Hubby and I liked it.

Awesome dish, very easy.  You're really going to want to salt and pepper well before baking.  I used sea salt and coarse ground pepper and of course, the garlic powder.  I took the advice of a previous review and used two cups of wine and that was perfect.  Also, you'll want to double the gravy mix otherwise you'll be left with more of a sauce which is great, just not a gravy.

Only had two tenderloin but it still turned out great. I had no celery so I added crushed fresh shallots and two small clove of fresh garlic crushed. The gravy rates as one of the best I've made. Will make this again possibly for eight people.

This was the first time I ever made pork tenderloin and my boyfriend and I loved it! The red wine made it so tender and succulent that we didn't even need the gravy (which didn't thicken, by the way). I served the pork with oven roasted red potatoes and asparagus with a parmesan crust--these flavors worked well together. This was a very tasty dish--I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

Thanks Kathleen for the wonderful recipe. I thought this dish came from a 5 star resturant. Everyone raved how delicous and moist this was. Great gravy on the mashed potato's too. Yum Yum Yum....still craving this one. The only thing I added was mushrooms to the dish.

This was a lovely recipe that pleased everyone !   I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The gravy was sooo good ! It took quite a bit longer than what the recipe calls for.....so be sure to equate more time into the preparation - it's well worth it though !

This was fantastic pork!  I used shallot instead of onion and added about a cup of sliced mushrooms.  My husband loved it and was very impressed.

This was easy to make, and the pork was tender, but the flavor wasn't very good, and I don't plan to make it again.

Simple and tasty. I've always had trouble finding a nice way to prepare pork (mine is usually dry and bland). The sauce is key to this recipe and my husband liked it alot. I used Wondra Quick-Mixing Flour for sauces and gravy to thicken in addition to the brown gravy dry mix.

Loved this recipe!  First time I made it, I used too much wine and the gravy 
never thickened.  I used a little less wine the last time and it was fabulous.  I save
this to impress company when we have dinner parties.  I serve it with polenta and 
fresh green beans.  Very impressive and very easy.

This was a great recipe. I recently got married so I am always looking for new recipes to try. My husband LOVED this. I cut the gravy with a little water as it seemed pretty strong/salty but the next time I think I may add a little flour to thicken it up a bit. I will prepare this recipe again and again!

Great recipie!  I cooked it at 400 instead of 350, it was done in 40 minutes and was tender and juicy.  I recommend using real garlic (pressed) instead of garlic powder. Mushrooms also make a great addition. This will be a regular from now on.

This was an awesome meal!  The meat comes out moist and tender.  I loved the sauce, but my kids were not crazy about it.  They did, however, love the meat without the sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious!  I will definitely make again, especially since it was so easy.  My only change will be to use less pepper (I loved it as is, but 2 out of 3 kids felt it was too spicy).

Absolutely fabulous!  I served this at a dinner party for about 12 people (using the recipe converter)
and everyone loved it!  It was so easy and came out perfect.
We'll be adding this to our family list of regulars!

I used 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth.  Also strained the juices before adding the brown gravy mix to thicken.  Very good.

I was worried about it tasting too "alcohol-y" from the wine, but that wasn't the case at all.  The gravy I made in the end was perfect.  This will be a regular.

My husband and I throughly enjoyed this meal!  The flavor of the meat was delicious!!!  I still need to work on the perfect thickening agent for the sauce.  I used corn starch rather than the gravy mix and I'm still not quite satisfied.  I think next time I'll try the gravy mix instead!

Mine came out a bit salty and strong tasting, but the package of gravy mix I used was a bit bigger than what the recipe called for and I also used a smaller pan.  The alcohol in the wine may not have had enough surface area to fully evaporate.  I will try this one again, though.

I change it up a little. I've made this twice, once with pork tenderloin and once with pork loin, still super easy and tender and moist. I don't use celery. I do saute mushrooms and diced garlic in Irish butter and Worcestershire sauce then add to roast and pour on the wine. It gives a better flavor than putting mushrooms raw in the wine because they absorb less of the wine.  This comes out like food fit for royalty but it is so easy!

I made this for my family's Christmas eve dinner using a 10 pound tenderloin. I followed the recipe but allowed for 25 minutes cooking time per pound and it was amazing. This got rave reviews from all of my guests. We will definitely make this again.

I couldn't believe how great it was for being so easy to pull together. I  used salt, pepper, garlic powder to season my meat, then in EVOO I seared/browned my pork in a cast iron pan for about 12 minutes all around. (we like the taste and appearance of browned carmelized meat) Used 1 cup of pinot noir (nothing fancy) and 1 cup beef broth. I'm a big wine lover but felt 2 cups of wine would be too strong a wine flavor to the gravy. Put the same pan into the oven. I used one packet of McCormick Brown Gravy mix. I did not use the sliced onion or celery as I didn't think they'd really contribute much to the flavor. The whole family loved it. Definite keeper.

It was tolerable at first, but I should have doubled the salt, pepper, & garlic powder rub for more flavor. Had to add 15 minutes bake time for meat to be done, with celery still crunchy. Next day, the leftovers had worsened in flavor even though I had used my family's regular red wine.

I made no changes to this amazing recipe as it was absolutely delicious! I poured the liquid in a 2 cup glass measure  after I removed the meat to a cutting board. I whisked the dry brown gravy mix into the liquid and microwaved it on high for 2 min. It thickened just enough , and I poured it over the platter of sliced meat and passed the remaining to top the delicious baked potatoes.

Followed the recipe to a T & found it to be outstanding. But you don't have to cook pork to 165, 145 is the new temp. I cook all my pork at that temp & have never had a problem.

I used pork shoulder for this recipe. First, I seared it on the stove on medium-high heat. Second, after removing the pork, I put 2 cups of vegetable broth in (since I can't find Burgundy wine) with the brown gravy mix and turned up the heat to high until it boiled. Third, I added minced garlic, minced shallot and black pepper (I skipped the celery). Finally, I poured the gravy over the pork shoulder and baked for 45 minutes. It was a little under-cooked, so I baked for 15 more minutes. The gravy was excellent (especially on homemade mashed potatoes), but the pork shoulder was underwhelming. That could be because it was a large cut so I should have doubled the gravy; or because I didn't season it thinking it would be too salty. Next time, I'll season a smaller cut of pork and make this a 5-star recipe.

I have been making this for years exactly by the recipe except without the celery, everyone I have served it to loves it!  It turns out great every time and it tastes like something from a gourmet restaurant.  The only important step I have found is that Pioneer Brown gravy mix seems to thicken more than any other type I have tried.

Simply outstanding! Pretty much followed the recipe, with the exception of adding celery because I forgot to buy it. I made this with roasted brussel sprouts & bacon, roasted garlic broccoli & lemon and rosemary red bliss potatoes.

I made a few changes (added carrots). It’s amazing!  I don’t even like pork. I purposefully undercooked the pork slightly and then poured the hot gravy over the sliced pieces.

I made this for Christmas Eve last night. It was delicious! I did brown my tenderloins in butter, olive oil and fresh garlic; used a whole onion. Other than that followed the recipe. Awesome rich gravy! Next time I will take out of oven at 35 minutes because of browning it first. Served with roasted potatoes and peppers with rosemary and Asiago cheese. YUM! Easy and very impressive looking! Definitely making this again!

It was ok. I added more red wine and an extra pack of gravy bc it didn’t thicken as much as i wanted it. Also, if I make this again, I would stuff my roast with onions and garlic like I normally do. It would have been more flavorful.

I did it just like one of the reviews said.  I added mushrooms  plus 1 cup of beef stock along with the wine.  I also used two packs of gravy mix.  I was so sceptical after 30 minutes and the temperature was 160 but took it out of oven and covered with foil.   I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus .  My guests loved it.  It was so easy I’ll definately be making this again.  Sorry I didn’t take a picture.

Very good!  A lot of flavor.  Let marinate in the wine for about an hour or so before placing in oven.  Made the meat more tender.  I highly recommend.

Despite using All Recipes for many years this is the first time I’ve written a review. Because this recipe is so darn good. Let me admit that I’m a vegetarian and haven’t actually tried it. But my kids (ages 6 and 8) give this a 5/5. They are the pickiest eaters but this with some rice and broccoli (both via microwaveable packages) is the easiest and apparently tastiest meal I make. Thank you thank you thank you. Oh - and I do it exactly as called except no onions or celery. Just salt, pepper and garlic salt, red wine (I flip the meat around a bit to get all of the wine because even if I don’t like meat I like wine so it must make it better - and the alcohol burns off for the kids?) make the gravy at the end and voila. Easy excellent meal.

Wow! I didn’t have any red wine handy, so I substituted one cup reduced sodium beef broth and one cup water. (I didn’t use all beef broth for the liquid because I didn’t want the gravy to be too salty.) I also chose a reduced sodium brown gravy mix. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe even though cooking meat in liquid has sometimes been a negative experience for me. I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome. The meat was juicy and tender. Be sure to let the meat rest five or ten minutes before cutting or the juices will run out. Since we love veggies, I didn’t strain the broth before making the gravy, and everyone was pleased with the meat and the sauce.

Very nice.  A different flavor for the tenderloin, but really good. We'll do this one again.  After you "slice" your onion quarter the slices for better setting in the gravy.

This was good! I made it for my parents and they both said it was very good - a keeper. The only thing I changed was to add mushrooms to the pan as well. I think they were a nice addition.

I found this to be bland.  I followed the recipe exactly. Too many other pork tenderloin recipes out there to keep this one.

Too long baking time. Most loins at 2 pounds or less take 15=20 and are slightly pink, which is delicious.  It looks juicy I guess, if you don't want pink in your pork, but since the worm that used to cause disease no longer exists in pork at all due to strenuous rules and checking, its fine to cook it medium rare....Helen S.

I only had a small amount of chianti left that someone had given me as a gift . The recipe turned out fabulous in spite of the change. I seldom have anything in the house that comes from a liquor store, so I will do some experimenting with this recipe in the future, but it will stay among my favorites.

Excellent. The first time I made it ,I made it for guests.I wanted plenty of gravy so I added 1 cup of beef broth to go with two cups of wine.I then added 3 packets of pork gravy mix. The only changes I made is I used mushrooms instead of celery. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I received rave reviews and had to print  the recipe for them and friends I told about it

I made this as the recipe stated.. was so easy and delicious! Paired with garlic roasted new potatoes, green beans and salad.  Easy weeknight meal. Only thing that I would add to this review  is that I used regular red cooking wine as I am not a big wine person

Left out the veggies, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I only made a one-pound tenderloin, so cut most ingredients in half. Still didn't need a full cup of wine. I added beef broth and half a packet of (mushroom) gravy mix. Seared the meat first, then baked for 25-30 mins. It was very good. The fam loved it.

Followed recipe exactly.  My teens, husband and I did not like the sauce.  The wine flavor was too intense for our tastes. It was quick and easy and if you enjoy the overwhelming wine flavor this may be a hit at your home.

Family wasn't overjoyed about this recipe.  Tasted too much like wine soaked meat.  I think it needed more seasonings.  I see where they are going with the gravy packet but again it just tasted like brown gravy added to pork.  Don't think I will make this again.

I love cooking with wine, however my family does not enjoy the flavor. Knowing that, I used 1c of wine and 1of beef broth. It was delicious. The pork was tender and juicy. We had no leftovers. We served it with mashed potatoes and carrots.

Excellent recipe. Full of flavor. Added a little bit more of the dried gravy packet to the sauce as well as heating & thickening in a saucepan and using fresh mushrooms. Delish! Going into regular rotation.

We loved this recipe.  I seared the pork tenderloin  before roasting, gave it a nice caramel color.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth and a half cup of burgundy wine for the sauce.  I like having the onions and celery in the sauce.  I think next time I will double the sauce.  I had to cook my tenderloins about 10 minutes longer than called for because the were a little larger.  We had plenty of leftovers so I chopped it up and added it to cooked egg noodles to make a pork noodle dish.  That's why I would double the sauce next time.  This is going in my permanent recipe collection.

Only thing I did different was to add some chopped mushrooms. Wonderful. Cooked it to 145 degrees as that is now the recommended temperature. Took a little longer than expected but overall was very good. I did not strain the onions and mushrooms from the gravy as one person mentioned. They're a good add to the gravy.

Too much wine and tenderloin should be seasoned and browned first.  Remember, with meat, no color, no flavor. Otherwise meat was tender. The wine overwhelmed the gravy and added an unappealing color to everything.

The pork was delicious, took about 1.5 hrs for my 2 1/2 lb roast. The gravy wasn’t good at all. Couldn’t find burgundy so used Merlot, maybe that was the issue. Very salty, so I get what other reviewres said. If I make it again I will take other reviewers suggestions and sub beef broth.

I have made this a couple of times now and it’s awesome!  I didn’t change anything as I had all the ingredients. If you’re short on time and want something special this is a go to recipe. My husband kept commenting on how awesome it was. Mashed potatoes and steamed veggies are great accompaniments to it although just boiled potatoes are great too seeing as there is lots of gravy. Great the next day too!!! Will definitely be making this more often because it’s so easy!!

I see some people left out the celery and onions.  I just cut them up in to bigger chunks.  My family loves vegetables.  This was really good!  Thank you so much.

It was okay for me I wasn't crazy about the wine taste and I only used a cup.  I think you need wine to cook longer than 45 min at 350.   I will not make again.

Very good, very easy.  I omitted the onion and celery as I saw no need for it.  Meat was very tender and flavorful.  I doubled the gravy by using 2 packages of gravy mix and 1 cup of water.  Served the gravy over buttered, parsleyed red potatoes also.

My husband and I liked it, but we were hoping to love it. Wish I could have figured out how to change it to make it five stars, because it is an easy-to-make recipe.

The pork was so tender and the gravy was so delicious. The only dry gravy mix I had on hand was Turkey gravy mix. I doubled the gravy, diluted the red wine with beef bouillon and water and added some cornstarch to thicken a little. Note to self: have some warm crusty bread to soak up the gravy...YUM.

Will definitely make again!  So good.

Wonderful! I did not use gravy mix and made gravy from pan drippings! So good! The red wine added a nice flavor to the mix! My 92 yr. Old neighbor raved about it! It's a keeper!!

Soo easy, I also seared it in the dutch oven with butter and olive oil.  While it was cooking I made sweet potato, carrot & apple bisque.  It pairs well with the pork and it is a big autumn soup for me.  For a vegetable I made steamed broccoli.

This is the most lackluster recipe I have tried on this site. I followed the recipe exactly and, relying on all the rave reviews, expected something magical to happen with all that wine. What a disappointment! Total lack of flavor and a waste of ingredients. Being from the South, where  we expect a lot more flavor from our pork , I am amazed that so many thought it was good. A nice dry rub might have saved it, but......not willing to waste the wine to find out. Sorry.

It was very bland. I used Bolla Merlot, so I don't think the wine was the problem.  The next day when I reheated some for lunch it had a little more flavor, but I wouldn't make it again. A waste of good wine. :-(

The meat was very tender, but it should be tender since it is a tenderloin. Onions and celery were a waste of time. I even doubled the celery because one stalk didn't seem like it would do anything. Well, two stalks did nothing, as well.

It wasn't the worst recipe I've ever tried, but I just don't see how some people are giving it 5 stars unless they doctor it up so much that it doesn't resemble the original recipe!

I've made this dozens of times and it's always PERFECT. Follow recipe as stated. Btw, to those of you giving it one star because it tastes too much like wine... I hate to break it to you but it's called BURGUNDY pork. And the tenderloin swims in WINE. Please use some sense :-)

I made this for my "Girlie Poker Group" and it was a hit! I did make one substitute: instead of the gravy mix, I used some Onion Soup Mix for the gravy, but then needed to thicken it up with cornstarch. But the meat was SO tender, and it was so easy, I'll definitely make it again!

We loved this recipe. It was so flavourful and tender. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut the wine to 1 cup. I  browned the meat before putting it in the oven, and also browned a few sliced mushrooms in the same pan as I had browned the meat in. I added them to the gravy just before serving. We had this with mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots, and it was yummy. I shall make this again.

Used one cup of wine and one cup of beef broth as suggested and also seared meat before cooking.    Gravy is delicious!   Served with pan roasted carrots, celery and onions with red skin mashed potatoes.

First off, there is definitely NOT too much wine in the recipe.  If you don't like wine, you should probably consider making something else.  This turned out really well.  My only minor qualm is the cooking time listed is a bit long, but if you use a thermometer, you'll be fine. Otherwise, I recommend cutting the bake time down by 5-7 minutes.

Fabulous recipe!  I browned some mushrooms in butter & olive oil.  As I let the pork rest, I put the wine & onion sauce, gravy mix and mushrooms in a saucepan to keep warm. ( I omitted the celery; not a big fan!) I could eat that sauce out of a bowl!

The gravy was gorgeous! My boyfriend had the genius observation that this would make a perfect Christmas sauce. Maybe nice with wild meat such as deer or even just with a good steak. Next time I'll braise the meat first, though, as it has a tastier crispy outer layer when braised. Top marks for the sauce!

Easy and delicious.    Used previously frozen tenderloin and there was NO problem. Left out the celery. Used Merlot. Forgot to sear it but that also was not a problem. It looked fine.  I had to cook it a little longer to bring it up to 160, but not too long. I used only one smaller piece out of a four pack that I get at Sam's Club.  This was served to my friends and I was scared it was not going to be as good as all of the reviews. It was all that and more. Be brave, it was fabulous.

I made this tonight for my family, son who is 10 and loves any kind of meat and daughter, who is 13 and is very picky about meat, and everyone loved it!!!  My husband was amazed at how flavorful it was!  I didn't use wine, instead poured a small amount of chicken broth over it.  Very flavorful.  Everyone loved!  Finally something the whole family will eat!  Great recipe.

This came out incredibly tender and very delicious! I seared the meat before baking, and it turned out beautifully. Definitely the best pork dish I've ever made, personally.

I made this just like the recipe and it was fabulous!!  So easy!  I will definitely make this for company. Next time I think I will add some fresh mushrooms. Once out of the oven, I poured the cooking liquid into a saucepan to then add the gravy mix and whisk well.

This is an excellent recipe- so easy to prepare and tastes like a fancy Sunday dinner! I used a little less red wine (1 3/4 cups) and after I strained the wine mix from the pan mixed it with a mushroom gravy mix and served with mashed potatoes. Delicious!

I have made this 3 times. It's my wife's favorite tenderloin recipe. The only changes I made were I used a little roux rather than the gravy packet (which I don't keep in my pantry). My wife loves mushrooms in everything, so with about 20 minutes to go, I added 10~12 oz of fresh, sliced mushrooms around the side of the pork. Also, I used merlot the first time and cabernet sauvignon the second time and we were in agreement that the cabernet gave the gravy a little more depth. This is so easy and looks like you spent a lot of time on it! Thanks-

Very good, but I didn't use the gravy mix, I just served it with the juices from the pork and the wine, which had good flavor from the meat, onion, celery & wine together.

My fiancé and I made this together on Valentine's Day. It was delicious. The only changes we made based on reviews was to sub one cup beef broth for one cup of wine, and I left the celery out because I didn't have it. Other than that, followed exactly. Would definitely make again.

Oh my gosh. Soooooo good. Tender. Lots of flavour.
I only used 1 cup of wine but would consider using 2 cups next time just so I had more gravy/sauce because it was so yummy. I used mushrooms as suggested by a couple other people.

The pork was delicious and tender. But the sauce was rather thin and not as tasty as I'd hoped.

Edit: The sauce was better the second night! So I made the dish again and cooked the sauce a bit longer after the pork was finished cooking. It worked well.

This pork was amazing.  I normally dry the heck out of pork tenderloins, but this was incredibly tender and moist.  I committed what is probably a great sin in the culinary world and had to use the wine I had on hand- which was not only NOT Burgundy, but it was a mixture of cheap red and white wine.  It still tasted delicious!  I also had no celery, so I subbed carrots which I boiled a little first to get tender.  Wonderful, wonderful meal.  My new method of making pork.

Tasty, will make again, but . . .

I  omitted celery which could have been a mistake since I lost that vegetable's moisture content in the cooking process. I used McCormick's Brown Gravy and was surprised it never really thickened. Sauce tasted great but I would have liked it a bit thicker. Also, the hubby couldn't find burgundy at the store so I used an inexpensive Cabernet. I added canned mushrooms to the gravy step at the end, because, why not? I love mushrooms in gravy. I think it was a good add.

Served with rice and pork was very tender.  Will make again but may use a mixture of beef broth and wine along with cornstarch to make gravy thicken.

This was marginally better than okay, but not as good as it could be. If I do this again, I'll use white wine instead of red and cut the cooking time to 30 minutes.

The red sauce is good, but more suitable for beef... way too heavy for pork and I ended up cutting it with chicken broth. Also, the resulting color was a little unappetizing.

Followed the recipe exactly as stated... my family and I did not like it. Maybe with some alterations like - less wine! It would be better. The onions and celery were still crunchy even after cooking for an additional 10 minutes. What a waste of an expensive cut of meat and a waste of a good bottle of wine, if I wanted wine for dinner I would have just drank the bottle.

It was extremely bland in my opinion. In all fairness, I didn't use celery, as we are not big celery fans. I used two packets of gravy mix as some had suggested. It was fine, but pork tenderloin is so good with just salt and pepper, I don't think this recipe is an improvement over this.

I thought it had too much wine flavor, so I added some flour to the sauce and some chicken broth.  Bravo.

Followed recipe but skipped the gravy at the end to make it low carb.   It came out fine, very tender but just not very exciting.  The onions on top were good but I didn't find the celery to add anything to taste and would probably skip celery next time.  Also I found 2 C of wine (I used Pinot Noir) was too much if you're not making gravy.I would use just 1 C wine.

As other reviewers I changed the recipe a bit, well....a lot.  I browned all sides of the tenderloin.  Sprinkled rosemary, garlic, salt/pepper and added fresh mushrooms.  Used 1 cup of merlot and 1 cup of beef broth.  Once finished and resting, I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce for gravy.  It was delicious!!!!  Will cook again!!!!

Pretty good. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes to cook to 160. When I checked it at 45 minutes it was only at 115. I left off the celery and added some sprigs of rosemary, which gave it a nice flavor.

I've made this recipe several times now. We absolutely love it. The only thing I do different is add more veggies (mushrooms and carrots), make more gravy and serve it with creamed potatoes. Don't overcook the pork...if you're unsure, just use a meat thermometer. And get a real burgundy. It makes a difference.

After 45 minutes the majority of the meat was raw. I would think you are suppose to cover it. The sauce tasted like it came straight from the wine bottle.

This recipe is outstanding!  Reading other reviews I did reduce the wine by half & replaced the half with beef stock.  The gravy was PERFECT.  I didn't have burgundy on hand, so just used a cab.  Added mushrooms and served with mashed potatoes...OMG, hubby said this is a keeper!

Wasn't a fan at all.The pork turns out very tender, but that is easy to achieve no matter what sauce/rub you use; tenderloin is easy to cook. The appearance and flavor were not good. It's a very unattractive light pink and blackish color, and the sauce is very salty, even with reduced-sodium  gravy mix. I also followed other reviewers' advice and did half wine and half stock, and it still tasted far too much like wine. I used good wine on this and felt like I wasted it. I will stick to my other pork tenderloin recipes in the future.

This was okay.  One thing that I would change would be to flip the pork midway through.  I wasn't crazy about this dish.  The packaged gravy gave it a processed taste.

While I really liked the gravy A LOT, the pork turned out pretty flavorless. This really needs to be marinated first. Also, I wound up having to bake for 55 minutes. But the pork did wind up being moist and juicy.

This was just ok.  It was easy, I thought the meat had a good texture and was somewhat tender.  It took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook!  And most of all, I have to agree with Leogirl, I couldn't get passed the "gamey" taste.  My husband liked it but said it still was not good enough to belong to our "rotation" of recipes.

Wonderful easy recipe, seared it first in the dutch oven, used inexpensive merlot and popped it in the oven.  Made it without the onion & celery (husband not a fan) and it was terrific!  I did have to heat the wine & gravy mix to boiling to get it to thicken, but after that - AWESOME!

Definitely a KEEPER!  Followed other suggestions and floured/browned first and did not add any SALT.  Used a 1 1/2 pound tenderloin and adjusted wine amount.  Also used a MERLOT and it was just great.  Did not add the celery.  Served w/ mashed red pototoes (skin on) as per another reviewer and delicious!!!

Don't know what happen....I followed the recipe exactly, the wine and brown gravy mix was way to bitter. I tried to adjust it with some water and other things but it jsut never got any better. Won't be trying this again.

I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of the burgundy wine with the pork.  I tried it a second time with white wine instead and I liked it much more, but it got a little dry.

This recipe was a great starting point for me and imagine that if I followed the directions, the dish would have turned out fantastic. I didn't have any celery so I used fennel instead which worked out great. I also used a fruity homemade wine I had, as I was feeling in a light mood, which I thought the burgundy wine would make kinda deep.  I served it on a bed of roasted smashed potatoes that I added to fried bacon and added fresh rosemary and finished in the oven.  Just my two cents.

I followed this recipe exactly but I'm sorry to say it wasn't very good. We ate it but as my husband said, "what a waste of a good pork tenderloin!" Won't be making this Purple recipe again.

I followed this recipe exactly and did not alter a thing (excpet I had to cook for an additional half hour).  I thought this was simply okay.  I love pork and typically love any dish with red wine so I figured this would be a homerun; however, I was disapointed.  I should have made some adjustments based on other reviews.  I am sorry to say that I won;t make it again.

Very Delicious recipe I thought the burgundy wine flavor was gonna be over powering but it i not at all it was perfect. But the right temp for Pork Tenderloin and most Pork meat temp, is 155-160 degrees.

What can I say. I used the derivative of prep time over (ingredients x difficulty)^2 and came up with 4 stars. Only bad thing is now I have a jug of $5 wine left over and can't throw it out.

The BF loves this recipe, I find it too salty and to not have enough gravy. I've made this recipe multiple times and never add any salt and somehow it is still too salty. Needing to tweak things a bit, so as to get more gravy without more salt.

Looked aweful! I ended up with a purple mess, tasted pretty good, but I had to sear it after just to make it look appitizing. Might make again with a ton of changes, more effort on making the gravy.... gravy not just winey beefy juice.

yum, yum! My husband loved it too!! I also added 2 packets of the gravy mix and also substituted one sup of the wine for a cup of beef broth. Even then there was a distinct 'wine' taste and was perfect. I also made this a oven safe pot that went straight into the oven to the stovetop for the gravy. One thing to clean up!   I will definitely make this again. Next time I will watch the temp of the meat a little closer to make sure its done perfectly!

Pork was extremely tender & spices were an excellent addition.  Sauce was very thin - next time I'd probably take the wine mixtuer & put in a saucepan and then add the gravy and heat so it becomes thicker.

I just started a new job this week and I don't get home til at least 6:30, so I'm needing some help on dinner.  My boyfriend DOES NOT COOK but I gave him these instructions: "Take the pork out of the fridge.  Put it in the big blue glass pan. Sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Top it with chopped onions, pour 2 cups of pinot noir over it, and put it in the oven at 350 for 1 hr 15 min."  (we had a 3.5 lb loin.)  When I got home I took out the roast and stirred in one pack of low-sodium gravy and this was SO DELICIOUS.  Literally a fool-proof meal, and I completely disagree with the people that say it's ugly if you don't brown it first.  Tender, juicy, flavorful, and most importantly easy.

Super easy to make. I used a full onion (figured it couldn't hurt) and it was great. Loved the sauce, although it was a bit thin. The pork was wonderfully moist. My husband usually doesn't care for prok, but he loved this.

! up-ed it to 12 servings and tried it for a dinner party. Well, Now... I've tried it and tried it and tried it again, and everybody love it. SO... My advice to you is try it, you'll like it!!! I have printed it out for all my friends and they, like me, have tried it and they too are in the same boat!!! It doesn't matter when you serve it... the results are a sort of standing ovation..... This will be around us all for a very long time to come, Hope you like it as much as we all do.

This was really delicious.  I found it to be a little too salty (the gravy mix)  I only added 1 cup of the burgundy wine because i didnt want it to be overwhelming "winey" .  It wasnt - next time I will add 2 cups of wine.  I also made the gravy on top of the stove in a little saucepan.  It thickened up nice that way. I dont know that the celery added any flavor but the onions were perfect.  They were delicious in the gravy.  I am going to work on the gravy and its saltiness though.  Definatley worth making.

The gravy was a little salty when substituting beef bouillon for one cup of wine, but still very good. The meet does not need to be brazed for the sake of colour as it is covered in the thick gravy. I did not braze it. I did however, rub the seasonings into the outside of the meat instead of simply sprinking them over the top. It think this helped the top of the meat keep it's delicious flavour.   It should be brought to about 167F as it does not seem to cook more than a couple of degrees after it is removed from the oven. I had to heat the gravy in the microwave to get it to thicken. I think I will increase the wine to 1 1/2 cups and reduce beef bouillon to 1/2 cup (if I choose to replace some of the wine with beef bouillon). It might also be good to add to the gravy the juices that come out of the meat while waiting for the gravy. These could be added to the thickened gravy just before serving.  My super picky kids weren't big fans of the gravy, so I must remember to leave some of the meat gravy free next time.

The red wine gave the pork a great flavor. As other users noted, the celery and onion was not needed, but might have helped to increase the flavor.

Great flavor!  Looks very fancy, too.  This was easy to prepare and came out wonderful.  The leftover juices I didn't get to thicken to gravy-like consistency, but I served it the way it was and it was terrific over the meat, garlic mashed potatoes and roasted green beans I served.  My husband thought it was fantastic.  I will be making this again in the future.

This is an AMAZING recipe. I just made this for some friends for a dinner party the other night and there wasn't a single peice left for left for leftovers. I did make some alternations to the recipe. The one packet of gravy mix was not enough to "thicken" the sauce, so I ended up using a can of beef gravy and the sauce was a HUGE HIT. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

DELICIOUS. I did not change a thing with the recipe. It was moist, tender, and flavorful... and fantastic with a side of mashed potatoes. I will be making this again.

This is a very good recipe.  I think that it makes a big difference what red wine is used.  I used a very strong red wine and the wine flavor was overwhelming.  However, the pork was tender and tasty even if the wine flavor was a bit much.  I will make it again but will make a few changes.

This wasn't that great. I definitely wouldn't make it again. I love wine and enjoy pork tenderloin, but there was something not quite right about the combination.

Excellent recipe. I used wild boar, which is quite a bit leaner than regular pork, but it still turned out amazing. It did take longer than the recipe recommended, but as long as you have a meat thermometer, you should be fine.

Super easy and quick. I chopped up all of my veggies the night before. The only very minor cons: It took 10 minutes longer to reach 160', and I had to heat up the cooking juices with the gravy mix on the stove to make it thicken up. VERY minor issues, but thought I should mention it. The tenderloin came out VERY tender, and the gravy was terrific! I used a pinot noir, as it is my mom-in-law's favorite, and we were making this for her birthday. The gravy was very tasty on the mashed potatoes. We also served fresh green beans with it and a loaf of wheat/italian bread. Enjoy!

This was really good.  I generally don't like packaged gravy recipes, but I thought this was better than most.  Must have been the wine mixed with it that made it taste so good.  Leftovers were also really good.

I only gave this three stars because we did not like the sauce at all with the brown gravy packet.  The sauce was good on its own and I should have left it that way.  Other than that, the pork was very tender and moist and had a great flavor.

This was really good.  Seared the meat first.  Reached a little over 160 degrees in about 30 minutes.  Yes, gravy was a bit salty but I figured thats just from the gravy mix.  Added a little garlic powder to the gravy and that seemed to help the saltiness a bit.  Also added some corn starch to thicken it up, since other reviewers claimed it was too thin.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks

The pork was very tender and nicely seasoned. I browned the pork first and I added a can of sliced mushrooms but omitted the celery.  The gravy did not thicken for me so next time I will thicken it with a little cornstarch dissolved in water.

I have to agree with the masses that this recipe is definately a keeper!  It's so incredibly easy and an impressive dish to serve guests!  Be advised though that mine took quite a bit longer to cook than called for here.  I also marinated it in the sauce all day before cooking!  Throw in some new potatoes for your side!

Excellent dish!  The whole family enjoyed it.  The pork was very tender and nicely seasoned.  I added a package of sliced mushrooms to the onions and celery before cooking and they turned out perfectly.  I also added a second packet of gravy mix to thicken the sauce a bit more.  Will definitely make it again!

After reading the reviews I seared the pork first, sauteed some baby bellas to throw in at the end, used 1 cup each wine and beef broth and omitted the celery.  The gravy did not get thick at all but had a great flavor.  We thought it was good but guess we prefer our pork tenderloin done on the grill.  Served w/ mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus---was a very nice meal.

This was ok.  But since it doesn't say to cover with foil or anything like that.  I left it the time it says and it was completely raw.  When I decided to cover it up and leave it longer by the time it was done it was very dry.  Since it longer to cook and fustrated with it not coming out good, we didn't even enjoy the meal.  If I make this again, then I will cover it up to get that soft moist in it.

Very tasty. Very easy. I love things cooked in wine. I think I will cut back on the wine as it made more gravy than we needed. Will make again often.

This was absolutely delicious.  I added 2 packets of brown gravy mix to thicken it up a bit, and instead of chopping the celery, I sliced it thinly like the onion.  When I drained the gravy, I kept the onion and celery and served it as well.  Everybody loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe tasted pretty good! I have no idea what kind of red wine I used, other than it was dirt cheap. I would suggest flipping the meat over half way through cooking. I may have used over two lbs of meat...I don't really know, but I did have to cook this for a good 1.5 hrs and that's after kicking it up to 400 the last 20 min. just to get it on the table. I used a meat therm. to gauge readiness. However, it was very tender. For the two cups of wine it seems the taste was good, though a bit winey, with one package of gravy mix, but I had to separately boil the juices and add cornstarch to get it to thicken--and that wasn't even gravy consistency.   I agree with someone's review that the sauce tastes great with homemade mashed potatoes.

I'm giving this 5 stars - however, I had to change a few things based on what was in my kitchen.  I used about 1 1/2 pounds of pork.  I added 1 stalk of chopped celery, 1 chopped carrot, 1/2 chopped onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, a can of beef broth, 1/2 cup of sherry, and black pepper to season. I cooked it in my crockpot for 6 hours.  It was amazing!  The next time I will use more sherry, as I felt it needed more.  The pork was falling apart as we ate it!  Great recipe.  I will definitely make again!  Very easy and very tasty!

Very flavorful. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. If you do not like a slight wine taste I would use less wine, but we thought it was perfect. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was great.  I minced about 5 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. After I sliced the tenderloin I submerged it in the gravy and placed it back in the oven on 200 degrees for about 10 mins. I served it woth garlic smashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Very tasty!

So simple and tasty. The gravy is a perfect change from the usual brown/pork gravy. I followed the recipe but think that you could probably leave off the onion and celery (or use onion power & celery salt) and it would still be good and even simpler to make.

Terrific and almost too easy.  Only change I made was adding some minced garlic to the rest of the veggies.  We had a simple white rice and green salad as sides.  Such a nice meal.  Going to give this recipe to my kids -they will love it! Made this again last night-simmered some sliced mushrooms in the gravy-Yum!

This gets 5 stars for great taste with very little effort!  I recommend cutting down the wine by 1/2 and adding a cup of beef broth so that the meat is not overpowered by the wine.  Also added sliced mushrooms - very tasty!

This was superb! My husband doesn't eat pork, so I made it a night he was out of town on business. The next night he tried some of the left overs...I think I converted him! He loved it! I will be making this again. I also think I'm going to try it with venison.

Once was more than enough. Way too salty--recipe should use half the gravy mix, or just omit it.  Taste unspectacular.  Very disappointed.

Excellent recipe!!  So easy to make! I admit - I added white & portobello mushrooms to the pan & cooked them with the gravy. You do not have to brown the meat, just flip it once while in the oven & the colour will be lovely.

Delicious!  I did not add onions or celery (per others' reviews) but I did add 8 oz of mushrooms (whole mushrooms cut into fourths).  I was going to add the brown gravy mix at the end but I accidentally threw it away when I threw away the grocery bags.  Anyways, it was still DELICIOUS and I would even make it that way again!! Thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I used 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth.  Next time I will use 2 cups wine like the recipe calls for.  1 1/2 packets gravy mix was too much, I added water and it was still really thick but also tasty.

My husband who's a great cook and who swore he'd never had great pork tendeloin thought it was very tender.  We both agreed that fresh garlic could have improved the taste, as well as making a marinade of the ingredients before hand. It might have made for a stronger flavor.  All in all, a great success!

This was wonderful!  The first thing you notice is how your whole house smells good!  I found that Tyson has a pork roast that is around $10 for 5+ lbs.  Since it is a thick roast, I cut it in 3/4" slices but not cutting all the way through.  It cooks easier and is easier to cut.  Buy a large bottle of red wine and enjoy while it's cooking!

Very easy recipe and a great meal!  We also had steamed broccoli and a veggie medley.  I was stuck with a cheap bottle of wine which, in my opinion, brought this meal down a star.

I really liked this recipe but the taste is very strong and probably overpowering for some. I love strong flavors and my husband doesn't - I liked this dish by he didn't. The pork itself tasted good but the sauce is what was really strong. I did not have and dont usually use gravy mix so I just made a rue with about 3 tbs. each of flour and butter and added the sauce with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and simmered that until it was a good thickness (which did not take long). I served it with mashed potatoes and green beens. I would make it again if my husband liked it and would recommend trying it at least. The pork was fork tender. Oh, and I used burgandy wine, not just red wine.

Not great, but it was easy.  The wine was a little overpowering.  Also, I had to add some corn starch to get the gravy to thicken at all.

This one was unfortunately one of the worst recipes I've tried on this site. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with dry flavorless meat floating in strong red wine... The wine didn't make a gravy, even after the gravy mix was added. It didn't have enough seasoning and the celery and red wine together was kind of funky, actually. The color was very unappetizing, I won't make this again.

I made this today for mother's day dinner and it was fantastic!I used a 4lb tenderloin and didn't measure the spices. I always add them until it looks like there is enough, but I know I used more spices than called for. I didn't have celery, so I left that out. I also only used 2 cups of wine even though my tenderloin was larger. It just sounded like way too much wine for our tastes (we're not big wine drinkers). The tenderloin and the gravy were delicious and I received compliments from everyone.

The meat was quite good - nice and tender. The gravy was too strong, and had too much wine. . . but I'm not a wine drinker, so that could've been just me.

It's so easy to make and the meat comes out so tender! This is a perfect recipe for beginner cooks like me!  Side note: I would suggest turning the meat half way through the cook time so both sides of the meat are cooked evenly.

This was very average for me and my wife.  The gravy ended up a little too tangy for my taste, and the onions seemed to conflict with the gravy. I added mushrooms for the wife, and she seemed to like those.  I served it with some cubed red potatoes and those were tasty. Overall the dish was not BAD.. but it certainly was not GREAT either.  I will probably make it again... but I may have to make a few minor adjustments to suit my taste.

I had higher expectations based on the ratings, but I was not impressed.  The only pros:  the meat was very tender (although it took my oven 1 hour, not 45 min.), and it was easy to make.  Other than that, I thought it lacked flavor and was very uninteresting.  I MAY try it again with some alterations from other reviewers, but it's not very good as-is.

This was super easy and delicious...  the only reason I rated it 4 and not 5 was because the sauce was not great with my mashed potatos.  But on the meat itself it was delicious!

After reading the comments I was excited to try something new with pork tenderloin.  Very disappointed!!! Lacked flavor even though I added extra garlic and seasonings.

The flavor of this was delicious. And the recipe was very quick and easy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of its unappealing color. It should definitely be browned on the cooktop before putting it in the oven.

I too altered it slightly by using only 1 cup of wine and substituted the second cup with water and 2 beef bullion cubes.  I also left out the celery but I included one large potato which I sliced into thick slices. It turned out tasting just fabulous. My husband just raved about it saying he liked it nearly as well as prime rib.  I don't quite agree with that but it was very good.

I made this last night for the first time and it came out great! The one change I made was cutting down the wine and adding some beef broth - other than that the only change I would try for next time is browning the tenderloin before placing in the oven.

Such a simple recipe but it will definitely be a hit at the dinner table. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of pork but he absolutely loved this! I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it turned out perfectly.

I thought this was great and so did my family! I did brown it first before baking. Since I did, I probably should have decreased the cooking time. I would only cook it for 30-35 min. next time, but it was very good.

I made this last night and it's on my must make again list.  I didn't add the onions or celery and it wasn't lacking in flavor at all.  The gravy was so tasty and went well with the mashed potatoes I made.  The pork was PERFECTLY cooked.  I can't wait to eat the left overs for lunch today!

My husband really, really, NO REALLY liked this but I just didn't find it that appealing. Maybe if I play with different kinds of red wine I can get the right taste. Also, I would really like to add some mushrooms next time. I used only half of the entire recipe, covered the pork while cooking, and served without the celery. I made bacon mashed potatoes and asparagus.

This is the best recipe for pork tenderloin I've ever tried.  The flavor of the gravy with the mushrooms, onions and celery is wonderful!  The meat turned out very tender.  Made it for my mom, brother, sister and husband - they all loved it!  I bragged about it so much my sister-in-law asked me for the recipe and it was hit for her family too!

Maybe it was the wine I used, but the gravy/sauce was very tangy, which was not at all what I was expecting from the "burgundy" description.

good! made as is and was super easy and very moist. Took me longer to cook than what the recipe said   i dont think the celery adds anything, so next time i will omit. Maybe just saute some onions and mushrooms and put them on top when i serve it? i think that would be better.

The gravy is definitely the best part of this ... Before putting in the oven, I substituted a packet of dry onion soup mix for the onion and half a can of cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have fresh mushrooms. I also used about 1/2 c beef broth in place of some of the wine. I had a 3-lb tenderloin and it cooked to temperature in just under an hour. It was moist and tender.

Great recipe!Very easy to make.  It was very tender.  I baked it 1/2 hr. longer than the recipe says because I've cooked many pork roast before and 45 minutes is to rare for me.

I made this one for my boyfriends parents and his mother asked me for the recipe!! I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the top and it came out perfect. Even my kids gobbled it up and said it looks like something you get a very nice restaurant. It makes a beautiful dinner to serve company.

The pork tenderloin was terrific!  I will make it again.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought the gravy tasted to much like red wine - it was too strong.  I added sauted mushrooms to the gravy.  I made mashed red potatoes and wilted garlic spinach for the sides.

This recipe was easy and delicious! It takes only a couple minutes to throw everything into the pan. I like my sauces a little bit thicker, so the next time around I will probably add another gravy packet. I served it with mashed potatoes and veggies and the sauce was a great "gravy" for the mashed.

What an amazing recipe.  My husband and I LOVED it. My husband was raving about it the next morning! I kept to the recipe but omitted the celery because I didn't it on hand.  At first I was hesitant to use so much wine but I'm glad I did.  The end result was a delicious tender pork with tons of flavor and an amazing gravy.  The bonus of this dish was the prep time, 5 mins max. WOW and YUM! This is going to be one of my go to recipes for pork tenderloin and I look forward to serving it to guests.  This was a definite class act.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Incredibly easy.  Incredibly perfect.  I followed the recipe as written, but added mushrooms and onions.  It was super-easy, and was a RAVING success.

Good, not great.  Easy, so that's a plus!  Followed the recipe exactly but it felt like it was just a little bland.

This recipe was ok, but after reading all the reviews I was expecting something a bit more.  Pork Tenderloins by themselves are wonderful things and I found that this recipe added very little to the taste of the great piece of meat.

Easy and incredibly tasty... my favorite combination!  Only changes I made were to leave out the celery and add celery powder and ground thyme to the seasoning sprinkled on the tenderloins prior to cooking.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good recipe... I had to cook mine longer than 45 minutes. The pork came out very tender. I mixed one cup of Merlot with one cup of beef broth and used one packet of gravy with the wine mixture, but I thought it was too salty. Next time I will try making my own homemade gravy maybe with some sauteed mushrooms. I omitted the celery and instead of adding the onions to the pork I slow cooked the onions on the stove for 45 minutes until they carmelized and served them on top of a side of mashed potatoes.

This was so easy and so delicious!  I only had one cup of burgundy wine so I used it plus one cup of beef broth.  Next time I'll be sure to have the full amount of wine and I'll add mushrooms as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

AMAZING.  I'm only giving it four stars because I used some suggestions from other reviewers and made a few changes.  Used a nice merlot, and used half wine and half beef broth.  Did not use celery, but did use an 8 oz package of sliced mushrooms.  It did cook a bit longer than the 45 minutes.  I just used my meat thermometer and took it out when it hit 160 degrees.  It was SO FREAKING GOOD!!  My husband and I arm wrestled over the leftovers!

This was so good!  The only problem with it is that it needs to cook for 1 hour and 45 minutes, instead of just 45.

This was terrific.  I didnt have brown gravy mix, so I made my own.  If you want, I used roughly 3/4 cup beef broth, 2-3 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon or more of soy sauce and wisked well.   Added to the pan juices and wine at the very end and cooked in the roasting pan, on the stove top until it was thickened.  Delicious.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because something definitely went wrong when I made this.  I thought I followed the recipe exactly but when I tried to make the gravy it tasted terrible - way too salty and acidic.  Perhaps it was the wine, I used Burgundy but maybe it needed something sweeter.  I was able to salvage the meal by using the extra packets of gravy mix I bought (just in case) and used the gravy as is.  My family loved the meat flavor and the brown gravy tasted pretty good with it.  Be prepared to have your meat end up an interesting shade of purple (my kids struggled with the look) but the flavor of the meat was very good.

I made this several nights ago and my boyfriends eyes lit up with the first bite. It was delicious! I was surprised that it was so easy to make. Based on other reviews I made the following changes: omitted the celery and used mushrooms instead, browned the pork first with some minced garlic, and substituted beef stock for half of the red wine. I served with butternut squash risotto, and the rest of the wine of course. You've got to try this one!

Very good. The flavor was a little more mild than I expected, but still very good.  The only thing I may do next time is to add a little cornstarch to thicken up the gravy a bit.  Definitely a "keeper" as a recipe.

This was good. My husband really liked it. I omitted the celery, only because I did not have any on hand, and used one cup of red wine and one cup of broth. Also, the cooking time was a lot longer for my tenderloin.

This recipe is incredible.  I made this one time while visiting my parents and they fell in love with it.  My Dad requested it every time I came from then on and all family occasions.  I did take the advice of using only 1 cup of wine (Beaujolais works best), and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I also use two packets of the McCormicks brown gravy.  I add mushrooms as well once I start the gravy to take in the flavor.  Delicious!

The pork came out amazingly tender! The gravy was a bit too salty for my taste but I blame that on the mix.  Next time I would just add cornstarch to the wine and some seasonings and make my own gravy.  I served with roasted asparagus and green beans.  Excellent!

I think I expected a lot more based on the reviews, but this recipe was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly using a 1.7 lb tenderloin (not previously frozen), and yet it took a lot longer than 45 mins to cook. Also, by the time it had cooked a lot of the wine sauce had evaporated. I may try this recipe again.

This is a good recipe but if you aren't a huge burgundy wine fan I would just make a side of the brown gravy without using the wine/juices out of the pan. The meat really takes on the flavor of the wine and it was a little too much with the brown gravy tasting that way too.

Like other reviewers, I left out the onion and celery.  I bought a package that had two 1 lb tenderloins.  Since there's just 2 of us, I only made the 1 tenderloin and froze the other.  Used 1 1/2 c. pinot noir, 1/2 c. beef broth and 2 packets of the brown gravy mix.  I removed the pork and put the roasting pan on the stovetop, combined everything with wire whisk.  I had WAY too much gravy.  Next time for 1 tenderloin I'll only use 1 c of wine and 1 packet.  Served alongside the baked pineapple casserole from here on AR and steamed green beans.  Excellent!

This was very good.  It has great flavor and is extremely easy to make.  I have been  making this for a few years now.  I have to say without the celery the recipe is not nearly as good.  It adds so much flavor.  My husband even likes to keep the celery and onions in the gravy for extra texture and flavor.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the celery.  Next time I will add more onion, they were delicious.  The pork was tender and the gravy had a great flavor. It didn't say if you cooked it covered so I covered it the first25 minutes and then uncovered for the remainder of the time. A simple, delicious way to cook a pork tenderloin!

This recipe was good but not great. I used cooking red wine vinegar instead of red wine because that is what I had. I will have to try it next time with the red wine, it called for. My husband and our dinner guest thought it was still very good.

Wonderful recipe!  I made a few changes.  I didn't add the celery or onion as I didn't want to have to strain it out of the drippings for my gravy later.  My family doesn't really care for wine flavored food, so I used chicken broth instead of the wine, and used chicken gravy mix.  This is the best gravy I've ever had!  So full of flavor.  I really was prepared for this not to turn out quite as well because of the changes I made, but I was incredibly surprised.  I will be making this again and again!

This recipe is really too good to be true!  It was AMAZING.  I "wowed" both my boyfriend and my roommate with this dish.  It's very easy and pretty healthy.  I added mushrooms in lieu of celery and it was great.

I made this tonite and it was yummy! I did not use the celery. I added a can of shitake mushrooms. I used a cab sav wine, but only one cup and one cup chix broth. I made baked taters and glazed carrots. The meal was a hit.

Eh, not great, but not bad either.  I agree with other reviewers that the wine flavor was almost overpowering, even after I baked it for an hour.  I used a really good cabernet, so maybe next time I'll use a not-so-heavy wine like a pinot noir, or use a mixture of wine and chicken stock.  I also used 1-1/2 packets of gravy mix, and the dish turned out WAY too salty for my taste.  I only had onion on hand, but I'm not sure it even added any flavor to the sauce.  I will attempt to make this again, but will definitely brown the pork before I bake it.  Sidenote ~ the gravy was excellent served over broccoli though!

This was very good. I followed the advice of other raters and used two gravy packets instead of one, and omitted the onion and celery. I used onion powder and added two cans of mushrooms. Everyone loved it!

The wine flavor in this recipe is very strong.  I like the flavor but would probably use half the wine if I made it again.  Also it took another 15-20 minutes for the pork to test as done with my meat thermometer than the recipe indicated.  However the flavor was excellent and the gravy turned out amazing (mine usually does not!)

This is one of the most easy & tasty recipes I have ever made. My mother-in-law gave us some Pork Tenderloin, and I had no idea what to do with it because I'd never made it before. I found this super-easy recipe, and decided to give it a shot. I was surprised by how tender the meat was (I don't usually like pork) and the gravy was delicious. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I was nervous about the amount of red wine in the gravy, but it turned out FABULOUS. It's also easy to change how much you make -- I only cook for two. Again, I would recommend this recipe to ANYONE. Fantastic with cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes!

My husband and children really enjoyed this recipe. It does have a nice flavor with the veggies and wine, but I think you need to alter it a bit. Add the two packets of brown gravy, I used one. The gravy was not thick more of broth. Use red wine not cooking red wine. I used cheap cooking red and I think that was the biggest problem. I will make this again and see what happens.

Excellent dinner!  I made mine with a Cabernet sauvignon and a side dish of rice pilaf.  The pork came out tender,juice, and succulent!  My family loved it, even a very picky preschooler.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare and the house smelled wonderful as it cooked.  The pork was tender and the sauce was yummy--especially with the rice I prepared with it.  I will definately be making this again.

this was scrumptious!! i added a 1/2 cup of water to die down the wine taste, and added celery salt and onion powder/minced onions instead of using fresh. made diamond cuts and stuffed those with fresh minced garlic, drizzled with evoo and topped with rosemary. all of my dinner party guests raved "very flavorfull and rich" it was a huge hit!

Very good.  I'm not a pork lover, but I rubbed the pork with olive oil then garlic and some rosemary along with the the salt and pepper, and this seemed to add enough flavor.  Kids and husband loved it with mashed potatoes.  I only used half a cup of wine, added a bit of beef broth and extra gravy as well.  I cooked it covered and it was extremely tender.  Thanks!

If you want to impress guests and family plus sit with them while the meat is being roasted? Then try this one! Very tender, juicy and with the flavor of wine and garlic, a lovely partner for the night. It is easy to mistake yourself in the kind of company one should prefer.

I love this recipe.  Whenever we are thinking about making pork, I pull it out.  I usually make the recipe as is, minus the gravy.  I save the wine mixed with drippings from the meet to pour onto the pork after it's cut.  Instead of the suggested gravy recipe, I make a portobello mushroom gravy.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so simple! The pork was so incredibly tender. My boyfriend couldn't believe it was actually pork! I'll definitley make this again. I do recommend marinating the meat with the wine and seasoning for about an hour before cooking it. Gave it a great flavor throughout. Thanks for a delicious and tasty recipe.

I made this last night, and my pork hating husband...loved it! I thought it was good, but I did have to change the recipe a little based on what I had on hand. I omitted the celery, used 1 cup cooking wine and 1 cup beef broth and added a little minced garlic with onion (personal taste). I had to omit the gravy mix because I discovered I didn't have any, so I just used cornstarch to thicken. Will make again, but I am going to be sure I have all the  ingredients so that I can try the orginal. Thanks for a wonderful recipe and for helping me add a little pork into my husband's diet!

I must admit, I thought this recipe was too easy to be any good. But it was awesome. I did one cup of the red wine and one cup chicken stock. I didn't bother with the onions or celery either. I did two packs of the gravy mix and added sour cream to it. I also stuffed it with prosciutto and provolone cheese. I'm a cooking God to my daft friends.

I printed this recipe weeks ago, but just tried it.  WOW!  I should have tried it much sooner.  Absolutely delicious, and the meat was soooo moist, it melted in our mouths. I pan-seared the pork with the onions before putting into the oven.  I added the celery into the pan, too, but not soon enough (they were still a little crunchy when I served it).  Next time I'll either saute the celery first or strain out the onions/celery before serving.  My husband and daughter loved this...a keeper!

OK how could a recipe with such little effort taste so good. Made this for guests for tonight's dinner and I can honestly say that I spent more time with my guests than in the kitchen.  What a change.  It's usually the other way around.  The dinner....superb and everyone loved it. Made a lovely presentation coupled with roasted potato cubes and steamed vegetables.

I was somewhat disappointed with this one.  This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I substituted the celery for some crimini mushrooms.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic.  I love red wine, but it seemed like it was too much for the meat, or it wasn't simmered for long enough.  I haven't had packaged gravy in years and I remember why.  Luckily I tasted the sauce after I added the first package and didn't add the second one like other people suggested.  It was ridiculously salty and kinda ruined the sauce.  When I thinned it out with some stock the sauce was a bit better, but the meat kinda lacked flavour.  I'll probably not be making this one again.

First off, it should be noted I used a pork loin, and not a tenderloin.  Regardless, neither my husband nor I liked this very much.  I did make some changes that I thought would improve the pork but it helped little.  I made slits in the loin and stuffed them with fresh garlic, and seasoned the loin, then browned it in oil, put it in to cook.  I thought it was seriously lacking in flavor.  It may have been better if it had marinated for a few hours.  My husband did like the "gravy" though.  I probably won't be making this recipe again.

I went to the shore this past weekend and cooked this on Friday night. It was awesome! The pork was fabulous. I didn't add the celery and onions, it didn't make any difference. I also added a little bit of lour to the gravy to thicken it up. I will definitely make this again.

Good. I left out the vegetables. It was slightly bland, maybe the vegetables add flavor? My 2.46 lb tenderloin took an additional 15 mins to cook. Served with broccoli. Very tender, will make again. Thanks.

This turned out very good. I did use the full amount of wine, and I don't think it was too much, but I still may have preferred using a bit less with broth instead. I used Wiederkehr's Burgundy and Pork gravy.

After serving this dish to my husband last night, I overheard him raving to his friend about the great dinner he just had!  I did have trouble getting the gravy to thicken, but it tasted great anyway.  I used 1 C beef broth and 1 C red cooking wine and the flavor was perfect.  Also, I omitted the celery and added fresh mushrooms.  Served with mash potatoes and green beans.  Yummy!

I was a little weary of all the wine that the pork cooked in - but it was so good.  Even without the gravy poured over the top the pork was so tasty.  Even my 6 year old, we told this was chicken because that's all he eats - ate some!

I've had your recipe for quite awhile, since 2001, and I know I have made it more than once.  The only thing I have writen on it was to cook it longer.  Most likely, I was wrong so I'll be glad to try it again and just go by your recipe.

I did exactly as it said, except I used two packages of brown gravy instead of one. And while I loved the gravy on it, my boyfriend HATES wine, so he just skipped the gravy. Even though it was cooked in the wine, it didnt have a wine flavor he said, so he still liked it. And I used just a mid priced Pinot Noir Wine.

Very good recipe, especially with it being so simple.  Be sure and check the tenderloins with a thermometer, and remove when 5 degrees below your desired doneness temperature.

I enjoyed this meal, however it needed some help. The wine lost most of it's flavor during cooking so I added 1/4 cup at the very end. I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic. The sauce also needed some thickening. My husband loved it, but I felt like it was missing something. Perhaps next time I will try adding some mushrooms as others have suggested and maybe some rosemary. Still this is a good dish for a beginner cook since it is very simply and has a nice presentation.

Almost foolproof.  I too seared the pork and used Merlot. Made the gravy w/ wine and water.  Add onions to the sauce. It was really good and incredibly easy.

Although this was very easy, I would make a few recommendations.  My husband found the sauce to be overwhelmingly wine-y, so I would substitute one cup of wine with one cup of beef broth.  Also--make sure that the liquids are warmed up, otherwise the gravy mix takes a while to come together in the pan.  I would definitely recommend searing the tenderloin before putting it in the oven.

Really really easy.  I scaled it for 3 and thought the "gravy" was pretty good.  I still used the entire pack though.  After it sits for a couple of minutes it thickened on it's own.  The only think I did different was to add some fresh garlic w/ onion on top.  Will make again due to how easy and non messy this is!  Thank you!

Great recipe!  I used a red zin, my favorite.  I'm looking forward to doing this again with other types of wine.  I will cut back on the amount, as the sauce was a little thin, had to use a little flour.  Per another reviewer's recommendation, I paired it with pan fried asparagus.  Great match!

I loved this dish.  My husband on the other hand did not care for it.  He thought the wine flaver was too much.  However he does not like wine and really only cares for VERY spicey mexican style cuisine.  I will make this again and use 1 cup wine and 1 cup water.  I used exta garlic powder and rubed the meat with the spices and browned the pork loin in a little olive oil before baking.  I used two packets of gravy, added a litte more water and then broiled the sauce for about five minutes to thicken up before pouring over the sliced meat.  It was delicious with the crunchy celery and onions!

Very good and very different.  The pork took a little longer than the recipe said, but the wine gave it a wonderful, heady taste.  The gravy was a little thin, but nice and tart.  I left out the onion and celery, but didn't add any additional spices, so next time I'll probably experiment with some dried herbs.  I'll be making this again!

I've never cooked with red wine before...but I don't think I will  be trying it again.  The recipe was fun and easy to make, however, my husband and I simply did not like the overall flavor.

Great recipe.  I seared the tenderloin first and skipped the celery.  At first I felt the sauce was a little salty, but the leftovers a few days later were perfect.  Served with herbed mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.

I just made this for dinner tonight and everyone thought the pork was so tender, moist, and delicious. However, the gravy mix was way to salty when made with the juice. If you want to use that gravy make it according to the recipe on the package. This is such an easy recipe and it tastes really good.

Turned out a little dry because I didn't cut down the cooking time enough, but even though I overdid it it was still great. Makes the whole house smell soooo good while it's cooking. Everyone liked it, even picky hubby who HATES pork of any kind. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great, Great, Great!  I didn't have to change a thing! Served with Fresh steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes-what a winner!  And its extremely easy to make.  I prepared it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.

Fast easy and delicious-the gravy was amazing but the salt could totally have been omitted. I used a lower-sodium gravy packet so I was afraid of omitting the salt.
     I halved this recipe for the two of us but didn't change a thing-
WARNING-if your don't like wine, this recipe might not be for you-I loved the taste but it's not suitable for children.

This is my families new and all time favorite recipe. Both my picky husband and two year old loved it! This recipe is good for the whole family, and it's so easy to make. The only change was that I rubbed the tenderloin with fresh rosemary before baking.  We also found the gravy goes GREAT with buttery mashed potatoes. However, we only used 1 package of the brown gravy not two, the flavor seemed to be perfect for us. Easy and delicious!

This pork was very good.  I followed the recipe except for using only one cup of wine with one cup of chicken broth, adding mushrooms and adding a couple tablespoons of sour cream to the gravy.  The pork was very moist and had a wonderful savory flavor.

This recipe was wonderful! I used diced red onions, celery, and mushrooms and spread them over the top and around the sides of the pork. I had to cook the tenderloin for about an hour, but I turned and basted it every 20 min. It was so good my picky son and husband ate every last bite.

This was just OK for us.  I tasted the sauce before serving and felt something was missing.  It just tasted too much like the packet of gravy.  I added a little sour cream as suggested by other reviewers and that definitely helped a lot!.  I would make this again just not with the gravy packet.  I will just thicken with corn starch and sour cream next time.  Also, I didn't add the onions or celery.

I really like the sauce, but I just didn't think it went that well with the pork tenderloin. I think it would be better with beef. I made slight modifications: no celery, I cooked the onions for 5 minutes before I seared the tenderloin. Instead of adding the gravy mix after the pork was done cooking, I just mixed it in with the wine/broth mixture. It thickened up really well in the oven. Maybe the merlot I used was too strong for the pork. Anyway, the sauce is nice definitely worth a try.

Only giving 4 stars because like some of the other reviewers I felt the wine was overwhelming.  Next time I will try half broth and half wine.  Was very tender and juicy.

Very easy to cook, and exceptionally tender and tasty result.

The only caution is that it took us around 2 hours to fully cook the pork.  If you use a meat thermometer though, it's easy enough to tell when to stop.

As a previous reviewer suggested, I also added mushrooms, which soaked up the wine and made for a delicious addition to the meal.

I used 1 cup red wind and 1 cup beef broth. I also left the celery and onion out.

My husband absolutely loved this dish! I switched the brown gravy mix to onion soup mix and instead of 2 cups of wine I used 1 and 1 cup of water. I used real garlic instead of powder and green onions in place of celery! Very tasty! The only thing I would do differently is cut back on the wine, I found it to be overpowering, but my husband raved about it! Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for  my family recently and it was a big hit. I'd recommend doubling the gravy mix as I thought it was too thin. Other than that it was great. I made it with green beans and potatoes. DELICIOUS!

This recipe was okay... The meat was great... The gravy was not so much... I used 1 tsp of beef billion in a cup of boiling water to make the beef broth and used 1 cup of red wine... So I did the same as most people 1 cup beef broth 1 cup red wine instead of 2 cups wine... I to had to use two packages of the gravy mix... I also did not use salt and used sodium free billion... I wish I had made a different type of gravy, but the meat alone is great... My 5 yr old and 3 yr old are very picky and they both asked for seconds on this dish... Definatly worth saving this recipe... I will just use A1 next time for gravy LOL!

This is a very tasty recipe.  The meat was very tender and the sauce had lots of flavor.  I used one cup wine and one cup beef broth as others suggested. I had a lot of luck using Pino Noir. It didn't over power the meat, but it gave it a suttle flavor.  I also used McCormick brown gravy mix  (30% less sodium) because it had the least amount of salt in it when compared to other beef gravy package at the store I went to. I used gravy packets in the past that I had to throw away because it was too salty. I had a difficult time getting the gravy to thicken, so I added a little corn starch. Next time I might try more than one package of gravy. I will definately add this recipe to my personal recip book.

This was good, but not the best I've had.  We liked it, but it's not really worth raving about and I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

Okay, I give this a 4 1/2!  On Saturday, made the Daria's slow cooker beef stroganoff from this site (which is outstanding), for my son and his girlfriend -- absolutely NO leftovers for me and my daughter!!  So I pulled out a pork tenderloin and let it thaw for Sunday's meal.  I was somewhat hesitant to make this because of the mixed reviews but it seemed like such an easy, elegant "Sunday" meal and I had all the ingredients!  Boy am I glad I made it!  It smelled delicious when cooking!  I followed the recipe but used a bit more Lawry's seasoned salt for the pork and more pepper. The wine did not evaporate completely and I had plenty of liquid to make the gravy.   The cooking times were right on the money (the pork does continue to "cook" while resting on a plate while you make the gravy).  I used a whole packet of brown gravy mix as written and just some flour to thicken the gravy to our liking.  The pork was so tender and juicy, the celery added a wonderful flavor and crispiness to each bite and the gravy, while I could see it would be salty for some tastes -- was excellent!  This is a keeper and I will make again.  Even my fussy 11-year daughter liked it (and she really dislikes all meat).  Okay I made it more kid friendly by serving it with the ever popular mac and cheese -- but even that went well with this meal.  Thank you, Kathleen, I will also make this for our family gatherings!

Very yummy! I omitted the celery and used 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth. There was little liquid left after baking, so I added another cup of broth to make the sauce. I also didn't need the entire packet of gray mix,so advise that you add a little at a time until desired consistency. Thank you for sharing!

It wasn't bad. We thought 2 cups of wine was to much. Next time I will add 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth instead.The meat came out tender and juicy.Will make again for something different.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  Not much flavor to it though.  I used an inexpensive red to marinate the pork in. Still not much taste.

I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. It was delicious. I think I may have added too much wine - I was drinking it while making the recipe. Other than that - verrrrry good.

This recipe was alright. I may make it again but I would use a different wine and I would cut down on the pepper. This recipe was very easy so I will give another try.

This was an EASY, delicious recipe.  My kids (teens) really liked it.  I liked it too, but reserved one star 'cause I prefer a couple other tenderloin recipes.  I used pinot nior as suggested by others which I think kept the flavor in the kid-friendly range.

The pork was excellent. The sauce didn't make much of a gravy though...Next time I'll half the sauce before adding the gravy mix.  We will definitely make this one again!

This was yummy!  Not only was it delicious, it was ULTRA easy to put together.  I made it this past weekend for an early holiday dinner with my parents and boyfriend.  I took suggestions from some of the other reviews and subbed mushrooms for the celery, and 1/4 C beef stock for 1/4 c of the wine.  I served this with roasted garlic mashed red skinned potatoes, steamed green beans...everyone raved!  This will definitely be made again and again.

This recipe was so easy. The pork was really tender and soaked up the wine flavor really nicely. I would for sure make this again. 

The gravy however was too salty for my taste. Perhaps next time I'll just add a bit more wine and make homemade gravy.

This was very delicious.  The meat was so tender it almost "melts in your mouth".  I used a 3 lb. tenderloin and it took about double the baking time before it was done.

I'll give it 3 stars because the meat turned out very good, tender and juicy.  That was the only good thing about this recipe.  I only used 1.3lbs of meat and it took an hour.  The "gravy" was horrible - I didn't put any salt on the meat, I used half wine and half low sodium beef broth and added the brown gravy package - the result was a very thin sauce that was horribly salty...I like salty food but this was too much.  I will make another attempt at pork tenderloin, I assume the liquid helps keep the meat moist and tender, knowing that I will just pour some chicken broth over next time and add some butter and flour to it when I am done to make a simple good gravy.

Make sure you use a good wine that you like as the pork is heavily infused with it's flavor.  Also I strained the sauce to a saucepan and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken.  Lightened up the sauce a little.  Good overall

Excellent!  I marinated the pork overnight in 1 c. red wine and 1 c. beef broth.  Seared the meat before cooking and then used a thermometer when I moved it to the oven.  It was still a little 'purplish' so I might try 1/2 c. red and 1/2 c. white with 1 c. beef broth next time.  Also discarded the celery and onions from the broth before making the gravy and added a little Wondra for quick thickening.  Served with skin-on, garlic mashed potatoes and carrots.  I higly recommend you use a good wine (that doesn't mean it has to be expensive) - but if you don't like the wine in a glass, then you won't like it on your plate either!  :)  Would definately make again - this will be a top 10 for us!

I think this recipe was good, but the wine I used had a wang to it, so I think I just need to figure out what kind of wine to use.  As far as the gravy goes, no matter what I did to it, it was very thin.  After reading some of the other reviews, I might make a few different changes the next time around.

This is a good recipe, I didn't use the celery (don't like it)and used garlic salt instead of powder. Also had to cook the wine on the stove top to make the gravy. I will make this again and try it with mushrooms & potatoes.

I always get raves over this recipe.  So easy and flavorful.  I have found it is best to slice the meat and let it rest in the gravy for a few minutes before serving.

A very quick and simple way to get a flavourful and elegant sauce. I thought it was a bit salty from the gravy mix, but my husband loved it and as we both love red wine we didn't find the wine taste overpowering at all. I did remove the onions and celery from the wine before stirring in the dry gravy mix, as I took the recipe to mean that they were only supposed to be in there for flavour while the pork was cooking. I will make this again, for sure!

as a new and unexperienced I was very proud of myself when this recipe came out of the oven. I only had 1 1/2 cups of wine in the house and that was plenty. The unions were crisp and I liked them that way. My whole family ate it including my picky eater father. I also used pork chops instead of a tenderloin and cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 45. I made white rice and spaghetti squash and they really tasted fabulous with the pork and gravy. To me and my family it tasted very french. If you don't like meals cooked with wine or if you like more bland foods I don't recomend it. I do recomend it to everyone else though. My grandparents are coming over in 3 weeks so I can make it for them!

This is the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever tried and it's so easy too. Great for last minute dinner parties and always a crowd pleaser.  When people ask for the recipe they can't get over the simplicity.  Two thumbs up!!!!!!

It was good.  I would probably skip the onions or substitute with scallions.  My husband did comment on the fact that it was purple (because of the wine), so it does look a bit odd.

This pork was delicious. I turned my dinner party into pork lovers. The burgundy sauce was excellent. The only change I made was topping the pork tenderloin with fresh basil leaves.

Very tasty--made to recipe except omitted the celery.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  The smell in the house was so wonderful we couldn't wait to eat, and weren't disappointed. Beautiful presentation on platter with sauce drizzled over the slices.  Would make a great meal for entertaining.  YUM!!!

I use some Australian 1 cup serving bottle of chabernet something. I use 2 beef bouillon cubes. I also don't add the gravy mix. I've used leeks instead of onions before (didn't have onions). And that was pretty good.  I've also added portobello mushrooms with pretty good success.

I was skeptical of the packaged gravy, but this came out great!  Wow.  I did sear the meat and used some beef broth and less wine, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe.

I guess it was OK, but definitely not my favorite pork recipe.  I expected something more from a 5 star recipe.  I did use pork loin chops instead, so maybe that had something to do with it.  I was planning on making it for my in-laws when they came to visit, but I decided to try it on my own first.  Good thing I did.  The presentation was not very nice, as the celery turned all pink from the wine.  I don't think I will make this again.

Eh, I probably did something wrong, but this was pretty bland.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the gravy tastes like something from a diner.  The pork was SUPER moist, though, and that's something I've never been able to achieve.

This recipe is great!!  A favorite in our family and  the first choice in preparing meals for guests.  I always get compliments and requests for recipe.  I usually double recipe and use two packets of gravy for a terrific consistency.  As a caveat, you had better like the taste of wine as it is definitely there.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

This came out great and everyone enjoyed it.  I cooked it for 1 hour (cased on other user's comments) which I think was a bit too long though...and the gravy was very much 'red wine' tasting.  I will probably use a bit less next time.  However, it still had a great taste and was a big hit.

This was wonderful!  Suggestions:  The temperature was only around 143 F. after 45 minutes.  Next time I would leave in for atleast an hour before checking the temp.  Also, the sauce was sort of thin, but still great.  Next time I may try what others suggest and add corn starch or another packet of gravy.  I used whatever wine I had on-hand, Savgoun Blaunt (something like that), and it tasted great.

Fantastically simple, yet elegant and delicious. The listed prep time is about right, unlike many recipes that I find take substantially longer than listed (perhaps I'm just slow!) My boyfriend and I made this for Valentine's Day last year along with "Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes" (Debra Connors, this site, also a great recipe) and had a wonderful dinner. The second time we tried it, we overcooked the meat just a bit (left it in the oven ~10 minutes longer than suggested) and it was not as tender and delightful, but was still tasty. Also, we found that 1 to 1.5 cups of wine works fine, and this might hlep the reviewer who complained that the wine taste was overpowering.

This was absolutely delicious and about as easy as you can get.  My youngest son, who is extrememly picky, loved it, as did the rest of my family.  I will make this one again and again.

The gravy was the biggest surprise. My husband couldn't get enough of it. This is now his favorite recipe. It will definately be fixed again.

I'm not a meat eater and never have cooked pork. I took a few weeks off in between jobs and figured I would cook my husband something he likes with my extra time. He loves this dish. I've cooked it twice in the past month. I took the suggestion of others and seasoned and seared the pork before cooking. I add and omit vegetables as I feel--usually whatever is in the vegetable drawer. Although, the vegetables turn an unattractive purple. The gravy I have not been able to get to the right consistency. I've tried 3 gravy packets (2-pork, 1-beef) plus corn starch and still a little runny. But, it really doesn't matter. The best thing about the recipe is that it soooo easy.

A wonderful dinner, the gravy is fantastic with Mashed Potatos.  I used two packages of gravy mix as their were more juices.  I make this regularly and the kids love it.

This is a keeper!  What a great dish! My family loved it!!  So very easy and simple.  I did use two packages of gravy mix like previous reviewers had noted.  I also didn't use the onions, I used mushrooms and carrots.  Just because my family likes those better.  Will make again!

I can't believe how good this turned out.  I took the advice of others and added half wine (used Merlot) and half beef broth instead of all wine plus I added  8 oz. package of sliced mushrooms to the recipe.  The pork was great and the gravy over the mashed potatoes was delicious.  Terrific recipe-thanks!

I followed pretty much all the suggestions.  Browned the meat, used one cup wine and one cup water with beef bouillon cube.  I also used 2 packages of gravy and thickened with flour.  I  added mushrooms and eliminated the celery.  I only cooked it for 15 mins. in the pressure cooker.  It was delicious and no funny color.  TFS.

Following the suggestions of others I did sear this first and I substituted one cup of wine for beef broth. I also thicked the gravy up on the stove by reducing it a little and adding some Wondra. The meat was still a little burgandy on the outside but once covered with gravy it was not noticable. And the taste was wonderful! All in all it was delicious and we will definitely have it again!

Awesome! I took the advice of the other viewers and used one cup of red wine and a can of vegetable broth. For gravy used remainder of juices and dry gravy mix and then had to add cornstarch because was still too thin. Also had one big tenderloin that was already premarinated with lemon and garlic and had to cook 1 hour 10 min. Will keep this one! Also added mushrooms. This was great my boyfriend loved it!!!!!!!!!!

Delicious. I had a slightly-less-than 2 lb. roast and cooked it for about an hour. I had to add some flour in addition to the gravy packet to get the gravy to a consistency I liked but it was very flavourful. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans, it was a wonderful meal. I used Merlot but next time I may try a Bordeaux. I will try the slow cooker adaptation at some point, too, but I was really happy with this recipe.

Very good overall. I had two pork loins at about a pound each.  I browned both in a little olive oil first and the meat still looked a little gray, but when you slice it prior to serving and pour the gravy over it you can't tell anymore. Didn't really measure the wine, just poured until I thought there was enough.  Also sliced some mushrooms with the veggies. Used 2 packs of brown gravy mix and it was awesome with side of baked potatoes.  If you're not a fan of wine, don't use the 2 cups.  We really enjoyed it and will prepare again.

This was a simple, delicious and a healthy meal. Will make it a regular feature on our dinner table. Great dinner party meal also.
I kept the cover on the meat and found this helped to stop evaporation.

To die for!!  What a dish to impress your guests with!  I had to cook the pork longer than 45 minutes (an extra 20 minutes), and added some corn starch to the gravy, but other than that, the recipe was perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing it!

I have made this recipe twice in a month and it is DELICIOUS! I did add mushrooms and cut back a little on the wine. The gravy is just to die for and the meat is just so tender and tasty. Do not overcook -use a thermometer! Served it to my boss and his wife and they loved it!

The meat was very tender and moist but looked a little grey and unappetizing - the veggies were great.   The sauce leaves a lot to be desired no more packaged brown sauce  but I will try again with a little Bisto.

I think the red wine added a really wonderful flavor. I will use this recipe again.

Very simple yet yielded a very moist, flavorful, and eye-appealing meal. I, too, am not a huge pork tenderloin fan - mostly because of lack of flavor and dryness - but this recipe was exceptional. Paired well with the leftover Pinot Noir and Creamy Potato Cassarole. Serve with green beans or french beans for color!

This recipe was incredible.  I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!!  I did a few things differently, such as marinating the meat for 2 hours beforehand with a storebought package of garlic marinade.  Then I removed most of the marinade from the pork and added the spices, but did not add the vegetables.  When the pork was finished cooking, I used 2 pkgs. of the gravy mix.  It was really great!!  I made this with the "Roasted garlic mashed potatoes" recipe on this site.  I can't wait to make this again.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  I made it for Christmas dinner, and thought that the taste just wasn't that great.  I suppose that it could have been the wine I used, though.

VERY tasty, tender and delicious.  The only problem I had was making the gravy, but that may be due to my own incompitence!  The entire family loved this (1yr, 3yr and Daddy), and the leftovers are yummy too.
I have made this several times, and will continue to....

This was a great recipe.  My boyfriend is on the Atkins Lo-Carb diet and this recipe works with that so I'll definitely make this again.  I only had to use one package of gravy mix so I'd say only start with one and add another if you need to.

This was delish .Served with mashed potatoes, this was a true and, might I add, a yummy HIT!
This is going in my list of keepers.I did however use a little bit less wine than asked for (I only had 1 cup 1/4 of wine leftover)and it still turned out great.Thank you very much Kathleen!

This recipe was very EASY!  I put everything in the pan the night before and allowed it to marinate.  The meat was very tender. The sauce was flavorful, but thin (should be called au jus instead).  Only complaint was that it didn't look appealling - maybe brown meat first???

I FOUND THIS TO BE AN EASY DISH TO PREPARE AND DELICIOUS. I DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF WINE SLIGHTLY SO THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH LIQUID AFTER COOKING AND IT WOULD THICKEN NICELY WITH THE GRAVY MIX. IT WAS GREAT SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES!

VERY GOOD!  I used 2 packs of gravy mix, tho as it didn't thicken with just one.  I would also serve with mashed potatoes insead of baked, to go with the gravy. Will definitely make this again!

This was a wonderful dish made for my family's main course. Easy to prepare and delicious. And I had members that ordinarily didn't like pork either. Congrats are in order for the cook on this one. I used Butterball brown gravy mix and Ste Genevieve "Texas Red" Burgundy wine.

The pork was very tender but the red wine was a bit too overpowering. the sauce was a bit sour for my taste. might try again adjusting the amt. of wine.
