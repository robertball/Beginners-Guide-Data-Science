These cupcakes are super delicious, but there are a couple things I changed while making the recipe as well as things I would do differently when making them again.  First, I used all unsalted butter - not margarine or salted butter.  Next, I double the amount of almond extract because I really wanted that flavor to shine through and 1 tsp just wasn't enough.  Lastly, I had to add almost an additional cup of confectioner's sugar to the frosting because it was way too loose.  In addition to my changes, I would definitely change the caramel recipe the next time around - it's too greasy.  Instead I would make a "real" wet caramel (water and sugar) and omit any butter.  To finish them, I topped them with slivered almonds and a sprinkle of fleur de sel.  While I did make some changes, these cupcakes are sinfully good and I will definitely make them again.

Loved these cupcakes!  I like the almond flavor with the carmel combination.  I added a bit more powdered sugar to thicken the frosting.

These were excellent!  I made them for family and friends and everyone raved about them.  I drizzled the caramel mixture over the batter once the liners were filled for an added caramel taste.  I also drizzled the caramel on top of the frosting and topped them with a few granules of sea salt to help cut the sweetness!!

I followed this cake recipe almost exactly, my changes were-- I used 1cup of buttermilk instead of 3/4 cup whole milk. In doing so, I reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp & added 1/2 tsp baking soda. I used margarine & I must say the cupcakes I ended up with are the springiest, moist cupcakes Ive ever had/felt! (I am in love with their texture!)

I followed the caramel recipe to a T & I think I may have not let it thicken enough because when I poured in the heavy cream, I ended up with a rather thin liquid looking nothing like honey. So I decided to half the buttercream recipe since I obviously botched the caramel. 

I beat 1/2 cup salted butter with 1 cup powdered sugar until creamy and slowly poured a"little" of  the caramel liquid in, added more sugar & repeated a couple times until the flavor & consistency were there. I dont think I even used half of my caramel mixture. Then I beat until it was fluffy & sprinkled a bit of sea salt on top after frosting each cupcake. I loved the way these turned out!

I made this today for my husband to take to a potluck at his work. I doubled the recipe for the cupcakes, but used the regular recipe for the frosting and caramel. I'm glad I didn't double the caramel! There is a ton left over, and I dipped the tops of each cupcake in the caramel, and then drizzled it over frosting. I didn't have enough frosting for all of my cupcakes (maybe 6 aren't frosted) so I poked holes in them with a fork and applied a thick layer of the caramel. Everything is very tasty. I will definitely be making this again.

Only adjustments I made were using Agave Nectar instead of corn syrup (I didn't have any) and I used an extra tsp of almond extract to intensify the almond flavor. Yum!

These turned out really good! It actually made 24 cupcakes for me instead of 12 like it yields. Fairly simple to make and the frosting turned out great! It wasn't runny or loose like other reviews stated, I actually put in some whipping cream to make it a tad softer! Make sure you taste while you go on the frosting. I think if I put in ALL of the carmel it would have been way too strong. Also, when making the carmel, just put in the cream a little at a time, just because it says half a cup, doesn't mean you should just throw it in there. Go a little at a time to get the right consistency and it'll turn out perfect!

This was delicious!  The cake was very moist and flavorful.  The icing didn't have as much caramel flavor as I would have liked, so I added some sugar free caramel sauce I have for coffee.  Great go to recipe for fancy but easy dessert!

The cupcake itself is awesome.. no need to change anything.  The frosting can be tweaked to your preference.  You have to do some adjusting to make it more salty or sweet depending on what result you are looking for.  I highly suggest as others did that you cut down on the butter for the frosting, as it will make it more thin and greasy.  The extra powdered sugar is helpful, but you may need to add an extra pinch of salt to even out the sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am a professional pastry chef and tried this recipe...it was fabulous!  I made it a second time and doubled the almond in the cake batter, and used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of cake flour.YUM YUM!!! For the icing, I made a Swiss meringue and added about 1/2 to 3/4 of the very cold caramel.  then when I refrigerated them to "set" the icing I warmed the caramel and dribbled it on top of the icing...we gave 1/2 of them to my neighbor because we couldn't stop eating them!  She told me her kids fought over the last one to take to school for lunch the next day!! I will make for parties so i can't eat them all myself!

These are simply stunning.  Just that little big different to make them stand out at any event.  I used all un-salted butter.  Doubled the amount of almond extract and had to use extra sugar to get the frosting as stiff as I wanted.  Perfect...

Easy cake and frosting recipe. The frosting needs at least one additional cup (probably cup and a half) of powdered sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe or to spread and not have it run off the cupcake.

I followed the recipe to a T and was so disappointed in the frosting! It was very sweet and didn't firm up like I had expected it to (probably operator error). In order to "save" what I had made, I tried another reviewers tip of sprinkling some salt (I used a pinch of Kosher salt on each cupcake) on top to cut down on the sweetness. Apparently that helped because my Husband says he loves the sweet and salty taste..

The cupcakes were divine when following the recipe as written! The frosting was good, but I had to do the caramel a little different because I was having some issues getting the cream to incorporate with it. Nothing that the blender on the liquefy setting couldn't take care of for me though. My only complaint is that apparently I did not make enough...because our dogs ate over half of them while they cooled on the racks! Little stinkers! However; the ones we did eat...were marvelous.

This was so easy I'm 13 and could make this alone. It was also really moist and the frosting was to die for. I made this for my parents wine club and it was a huge hit!

These are delicious. I seeded a vanilla bean for the cupcake instead of using extract, and I reserved some of the caramel to drizzle over the cupcakes after iced. I also only used 1 teaspoon of vanilla in the caramel, and the flavor was perfect for us. I also did not have salted butter on hand, so for the icing I added a teaspoon of salt and that worked well for our tastes. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, I've tried salted caramel cupcakes all over Chicagoland and this is probably the best one I've had. The cake was deliciously fluffy and the frosting had the perfect soft buttery texture and salted caramel flavor. 

I followed the recipe almost to a T, allowing the caramel to cool completely before adding it to the cream, and the frosting turned out perfect. The only changes I made was substituting butter for margarine for the cake batter and using 2% milk instead of whole milk, because I ran out of margarine and whole milk.

I also made a "healthier" batch by mistake when I used 1/4 cup of margarine (instead of 1/2 cup) to the cake batter. This healthier batch of cupcakes also tasted really good. You know that the recipe is really good when the "mistake" batch still taste delicious.

Thanks for posting this incredible recipe, BakinMama.

I am rating this for the cake portion only, as i chose to make a different icing for these.  The almond cupcakes are truly delicious. They easily rival the almond cake from a bakery across the state from me that my mother in law gets me on my birthday each year (and I crave all year long!)  Dense and moist and a perfect almond flavor that is not too overwhelming but definitely distinct.

A to the mazzzzzing. I made these for my friends bridal shower and they were a big hit. The cake was moist and delicious, the frosting was spot on and the Carmel was superb! Very good recipe and easy to follow. I did as other reviewers and doubled the almond extract, it's a must to get that punch of flavor. Also I'm not a fan of margarine so I used all butter. Yummy!

I read and followed others advice...the caramel sauce doesn't need all the cream added, I made a 1/2 batch and used 2+TBSP.-worked great! 
  The frosting is light, fluffy, and pipeable.  I made a 1/2 batch to try this and added 2 TBSP caramel and 1/2 c. more powdered sugar and a  1/4 tsp. of sea salt.  I tried other recipes that were very unappealing and not to my needs, but this is PERFECT in every way. 
   I went against my grain, I like from scratch recipes. I put this on Betty Crocker Butter Pecan cake mix that I added a heaping cup of butter toasted pecans, crushed, to the batter.  And of course, crushed pecans on top of the frosted cupcake! Yum!  All my neighbors taste tested this and thought it was fabulous and want the recipe!
   I challenge any pro bakery to come up with better! I'm proudly serving these at a shower and hope you try the recipe.

My family loved these and they went very fast.  We kept them chilled because they tasted better chilled.  Pluse, I saved a few tsp. of the caramel and drizzed it over the frosting as the picture showed.  I will definately make these again and again and again!

The flavor of these treats are beyond compare. This recipe is excellent! However, I only gave four stars because of technique. It's very important to beat the daylights out of the butter, sugar, and egg at the beginning of the cake recipe, then mix in the flour and milk every so gently, and stop as soon as its blended. This produces a fluffier cake. For the frosting, creaming the butter for upwards of 5 minutes creates a silky frosting with a wonderful mouth feel. To mix all the ingredients together at once robs this recipe of its greatness!

This was pretty bad,  The cake did not have much flavor, let alone almond. The frosting was greasy and did not taste much of caramel, or a salted caramel.

Recipe is primarily for the buttercream frosting.  it was delish.  It wasn't too sweet and had the perfect salted caramel taste.  However, it was really messy and melty- if that makes sense.  I made cupcakes and the frosting seemed to want to melt/run away from the cupcakes even though they were flat topped and on a flat surface.  Any suggestions on how to thicken it up w/o sacrificing flavor?

When making the caramel, you dont have to use all the cream, just enough to make it smooth enough to mix in with the butter cream(when the caramel is cold it firms up and you want to add it to the frosting when its cool/cold as to not ruin your frosting)

We are 12 and made this on our own. However, we used a Food Network vanilla cupcake recipe, but we used the salted caramel frosting. The frosting was amazing and delicious and we even had extra caramel to drizzle on top of the cupcakes. We also added sprinkles. We used salted butter instead of margarine when making the caramel and didn't add the pinch of salt and vanilla until later, but it still turned out amazing! You must note, though, that the icing is very heavy, rich, and filling. Nevertheless, the only reason not to like this sugary, buttery icing is if you don't like homemade caramel!

Delicious! I'm glad I read the reviews first-I also had to add quite a bit of powdered sugar to the frosting, and even then it wasn't the consistency I typically like. The flavor was great though, and that's an easy fix! I didn't measure that, just added until satisfied. I also added an extra teaspoon of almond flavor to the cupcakes for that extra flavor...loved it! I used salted butter for everything because it's what I had on hand, and I am happy with the flavor and consistency! These will become a fast favorite!

The cupcakes were a great texture but not really almondy. The frosting was way too swee for me. They were okay and I may use the cupcake recipe again but definitely not the frosting.

Made the frosting from this recipe because I was making carrot cake & did not have cream cheese to make the normal frosting. I think I like this BETTER than the traditional frosting for carrot cake. It was a bit loose for my taste, so I stuck it in the fridge to firm up a bit. The FLAVOR is wonderful! My kids said to give it 10 million stars, but sadly it only goes up to 5. ??

I would rate 5 stars on taste, but rated 4 because of frosting.  As others have stated, the caramel was too buttery, and the frosting was too thin for piping as written. As a result, I probably doubled the powdered sugar. I sprinkled the frosted cupcakes with salt to cut the sweetness, and that great. I love almond, so I added an extra teaspoon of almond to the batter. The cupcake is one of the best I've ever tasted!

This is an easy enough recipe and it turned out delicious, but I did add another 1/2 tsp of almond extract just so the almond flavor was intensified. This buttercream icing is the best!!!!! I only used half of the caramel in the  icing. I am definitely keeping this recipe!!!!!!

So yummy! Cake part was delicious! My Carmel was actually at perfect consistency before I put in the whipping cream (I didn't have so I used half the amount of whole milk since another site said I could do that as a substitute).  So when I put the milk in, it made it too runny.  Had to add some corn starch and a little more brown sugar then it thickened up a little and cooling it off in the freezer helped it thicken up all the way.  It's definitely prettier to do the swirl shown but it is SO overly sweet that I did most of them with just a little less then sprinkled a very tiny amount of salt on top-made them perfect for my taste! We have a peanut allergy in te house but I think they'd be amazing with crushed nuts sprinkled on top.

the frosting had a delicious flavor but it melted  as soon as I frosted my cupcakes. I would omit the cream and instead use a little butter to keep it pourable next time when making the caramel as I do believe there's too much of a wet ingredients component to this recipe. Not happy with my saggy frosting.

These were really good.  I almost followed the recipe exactly, but I don't keep salted butter in the house so I used unsalted butter in place of the salted butter and margarine.  I also ended up adding another cup of confectioner's sugar, like some of the other reviewers stated.  It would have made more than 12, I scoop with 1/4 cup scoop so every cupcake is the same size.  I also had more icing than I needed, quite a bit more, maybe twice what I needed.  I brought some to work and they were a hit.  I even passed them out before I had tried one because I didn't finish them until shortly after midnight last night.  I figured I could risk it though because they are just so darn pretty!  Thanks BakinMama for a great recipe!!!!

4.13.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218217/almond-cupcake-with-salted-caramel-buttercream-frosting/ ... Other than adding 1/4t salt & subbing with salted butter, I followed this recipe.  Quite a shock considering I usually don't - sometimes on purpose, sometimes not.  :)  These were good.  I had a minibakeoff with Marianne's Sweet Vanilla Cupcakes.  I liked them a little better.  These are soft & have a light yellow color.  They're more yellow than Sweet Vanilla.  I didn't make the frosting, but I'm going to have to.  :D

This recipe is delicious! I did add an extra teaspoon for almond and love the result. I also added buttermilk instead of milk. I am sure it would have been fine with just milk but I am used to use buttermilk. This recipe deserves more attention!

I loved this cake! I made the cupcakes three times in a week when I tried them. I did follow some of the notes left by others. I only used unsalted butter because when I tried margarine, the caramel separated and did not work well. I definitely recommend doubling the almond extract, too. Also I traded the milk for 1cup buttermilk as another noted and adjusted the baking powder and added baking soda as she said (thanks ChefCourtKnee !!!) The texture was amazing! I love using buttermilk in cakes now. Sometimes if I don't have buttermilk I make some by adding about 1tbsp of vinegar to 1 cup milk and leaving it to sit for 5-10 min before I use it. The results are the same as buying buttermilk at the store. The frosting recipe is a little sweet for my taste, but others said they loved it. I would definitely give the recipe five stars, especially with the changes others suggested. Thanks everyone for the tips.

Enjoyed making and eating this cupcake. Hubby really approved. Cupcake itself was a bit dense but the frosting was perfect.

I followed the directions exactly & did not find this recipe to be very pleasing. The cake was fine, nothing exciting but not really good. Let's just say that I'm trying to cut back on my sweets and if I don't love it I don't eat all of it. I would not have eaten this entire cupcake. 

The big kicker was the icing. I bake often and usually do not have these problems. The icing was a mess. the caramel recipe was too runny, even without any heavy cream. You defiantly cannot add all to the buttercream. it would just be too intense. Lastly, I had to add a ton of confectioners sugar to get the frosting to thicken up and I just couldn't rescue it. This recipe was a fail. Might be fine with lots of tweaking but then it isn't this recipe.

These were a huge hit!  Followed the recipe but substituted the margarine for butter (butter always makes it better, hee hee)...  Doubled the recipe and it made 24 regular sized cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes.  Made a batch of butter cream and incorporated the caramel into half and made a coconut butter cream with the other half.  Both flavor went very well with this delicious almond cake.  For the caramel cupcakes I hollowed out the center using an apple corer and put some of that extra caramel in the center.  Topped it with the butter cream, toffee and a drizzle of caramel.  These were phenomenal!

Just made this in my class. It was an easy formula, but I ended up using way more powdered sugar for my frosting, because it was really loose.

This is the first time I have ever come across a caramel recipe that called for adding the cream after cooking was finished, I decided to humor the poster and give it a try. The results are disastrous! It turns greasy. I poured out at least a 1/4 of a cup of grease the remaining "caramel" is flavorless and too thick to drizzle. I like the idea but was better off scrapping this recipe and making traditional butter caramel and making a buttercream frosting with that.

I haven't made the cupcakes yet but I did make the salted caramel frosting and it was amazing. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and after reading some of the reviews it was best to "add as needed" because I probably only used about 2 Tablespoons. It was fine with the half and half since I had it leftover from a previous recipe!

5 stars for the cake as I didn't use this frosting recipe. The cupcake is divine! I did double the almond extract based on other reviews.

Yum! This recipe is all about the icing and it is so good! (although didn't use all the cream stated as per the other reviews) My Mom's caramel icing gets hard too fast and you can't put it in a piping bag. This recipe the icing stays soft. The cake portion turned out good too - I only baked them for 18 minutes. The cupcakes held their shape and didn't fall. Thanks for the recipe. I will make them again. Next time I will double the cake portion as there was a lot of icing.

I've made these twice now. Really fantastic cupcake and frosting although they do take some effort. My cupcakes did not brown much so I think I ended up baking them a tad too long. Next time I will check them at 20 minutes to see if they are done.  I halved the caramel this time around which seemed to be the perfect amount of frosting to generously frost 12 cupcakes.  I did need to add an extra 1.5-2 cups powdered sugar in the frosting.  Next time I will also double the almond extract as some other reviewers have noted.

They were a little dry.  The icing was really good but I added the heated items too soon I recommend making icing first to cool then maybe by the time the cup cakes are done the icing will be cool enough to add to non heated part of icing.  I will try this again

I made the frosting but made a walnut and pumpkin bundt cake instead of the cupcakes. I noticed it took a lot more sugar too thicken than it specifies. Other than that it was really delicious. I actually ate a slice of the cake every day until it was gone. And it was gone quick.

I followed the recipe for the cupcakes exactly as printed. I used a different recipe for the frosting. Everything turned out fantastic. The recipe made 12 cupcakes just like it stated and they got rave reviews from my colleagues at school. I love to try new recipes, but if I ate them all it would be a disaster! I let my fellow teachers be my taste testers! They LOVED these cupcakes!!!

I can only give a four star because I only made the frosting, which was divine!  I seek out unique, decadent frosting because the old favorites are too sugary sweet and boring.  If you do anything, just make the frosting! (I cheated on one batxh and used store bought caramels that I melted in the pan with the cream which had been frozen.  Still came out great!)

I made it with unsalted butter instead of margarine and added a 1/4 tsp salt to taste.  Then, I doubled the almond flavoring as suggested by other reviewers.  However, because I made these for my nephew's birthday party, I used vanilla buttercream instead of the salted caramel frosting.  They were moist and delicious.

I make these several times a year and they are amazing. No changes to the cupcakes, but I do not use even close to all of the caramel in the icing. As other reviewers said, add the caramel a bit at time and keep tasting. I think they taste better with less caramel in the icing and more caramel drizzled on top.

Yummy and the frosting was wonderful.  I think I will try a richer caramel sauce next time.  You do need to add more confectionary sugar to frosting in this recipe.

This recipe turned out very well! The only thing I changed was the margarine/salted butter into salted butter. It turned out well except everything was super sweet and I wish I put salted butter on the icing because then it may have balanced out.  The icing was really nice and smooth so I was able to frost it on because it was not too thick nor thin. Great recipe overall.

I LOVE this recipe everyone I made it for said it was the best cupcake they ever had and asked me to make it again, plus the caramel sauce is to die for and would be great on top of ice cream and anything else.  I didn't have corn syrup on hand so instead I used I used 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup of brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of heavy cream and it turned out perfect!

I've made this icing recipe 3 times in the last month....it is so good! Each time, I've just used a box cake mix with it (Betty Crocker Dark Chocolate) and the cupcakes/cakes have still been a hit!  
I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used about half the amount of heavy cream. I could literally eat the whole batch by myself!

I did not make the caramel  frosting. instead, I used regular buttercream with a little extra icing sugar and melted caramel chips and combined the frosting with melted caramel. I will definitely make it again.

I did a fun "cupcake wars" with my daughter.  She won.  These were good but not great.  I think it is missing frosting that is thicker and stands up.

This is a wonderful recipe. I like how the cake balances out the sweetness of the frosting. The only thing was, I had waaay too much frosting left over. But, I could be the only one with this problem. And do be advised- This will knock out a serious sweet tooth! Overall, great recipe. ps I made no changes.

Thank you for this recipe. My whole family enjoyed them. I've been asked to make them for an engagement party. I added a little almond extract to the icing and it was wonderful.

Other than doubling the almond extract I followed the recipe.  The cake was tasty, but not a light-fluffy crumb; the frosting turned out fine with just a bit extra powdered sugar to help consistency, but I just felt it was vet, very sweet.   Recipe for frosting was easily twice as much as needed.  I'm still undecided whether or not I will make this recipe again.

Excellent!  Also reserved some caramel to drizzle over tops.  Sweet, unique, and delicious while using common ingredients.  Exactly what I was going for!

Amazing.  Made this for the adults at a kid party.  They were a huge hit!  I'll make them again, but not any time soon.

These were really good! Received many compliments. I doubled the amount of almond extract. I didn't think it was enough but others thought it was fine. Next time I will cut the frosting recipe to a third of what it is asking for. Had quite a bit left over.

Love this recipe! I doubled it to make 100 mini cupcakes, added an extra tablespoon of almond extract to bring out the almond flavor, kept some caramel to drizzle on top and added almond slivers as decoration.. All in all a success!

I had a lot of trouble with this recipe. I followed the directions word for word to make the cake, but still found that my cupcakes came out very dry and tough. Perhaps it was a mistake on my part. I would definitely recommend using more almond extract than specified because my cupcakes seemed to be rather bland.

Very delicious cupcakes! I doubled the almond extract and only added some of the caramel to the icing. I used the extra caramel to drizzle on top of the iced cupcakes! These were so delicious and I highly recommend trying these out!

Great recipe! Made it for a Valentine's party, and they were a huge hit! 
For those having problems with the icing: I only used half of the caramel in the buttercream, and the other half I drizzled over the top. Also, allow the cupcakes to cool completely before you frost them. The buttercream is a little easier to work with also if you cool it slightly. Happy Baking!

I made these for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  The frosting is absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I was a little disappointed in the cupcakes though.  They tasted good but they were heavy and dense, not light and fluffy like you expect a cupcake to be.  Guests said they were yummy but more like a muffin than a cupcake.  Won't be using the batter recipe again but did love the frosting.

The frosting for this recipe is awesome. It is very creamy and delicious. I used some of caramel to drizzle on top and then sprinkled a little sea salt on top.

Cupcake is moist, don't overfill cupcake tin, frosting is a little too sweet and needs more salt for the salty taste
