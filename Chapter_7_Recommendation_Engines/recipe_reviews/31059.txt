This has a wonderful flavor!!  It does need more vegatables because it's all meat.  I added sugar snap peas, water chesnuts, and carrots.

Easy recipe for a filling dinner. I cut up a 1 pound pork tenderloin, added a bag of frozen "stir fry vegetables mix" and served with some brown rice on the side. I used Splenda in place of the sugar, and lite soy sauce only.

The concept is good, but I really had to alter the recipe a lot to make it more flavorful. I added some honey teriyake sauce, Thai garlic-pepper sauce, and cornstarch mixed with some water to thicken the sauce.

This was very tasty, but I made a few adjustments.  First, I doubled everything in the recipe except for the oils.  I didn't add any additional salt.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of minced ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  Snow peas went well with it.

What this recipe needs is garlic!!!! Mince up 2 cloves of garlic and saute along with the ginger. Use about 2 teaspoons of oil, not tablespoons. And before beginning the cooking, mix wine, sugar, and soy sauce with meat, and then add 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch, mixing to coat meat. Skip the salt. After cooking the garlic/ginger for a few seconds, add the meat mixture and the onion. After meat is cooked, you can add a little chicken broth or water to make it more saucy. Then, drizzle with the sesame oil before serving. Slivered red peppers add a nice touch, or any veges you like.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I think it needed more ginger.  I ommited the salt because soy sauce has enough salt as it is.  I made this and put it with bok choy and snow peas as a stir fry and it came out pretty good.  I cut it by at least half.  Otherwise, not bad.

The flavor of this recipe was good. I did add snow peas, carrots and crushed red pepper. I also changed the recipe for 12 servings as I had 1 1/2 lb of pork already. Following the instructions for 12 servings made it overall way too oily! When I make this in the future I'll cut down on the oil for the larger serving size.

Pretty good, and easy to make. I added snow peas and bean sprouts. I also added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Next time, I might grate the ginger, or make more of an effort to slice it thinly.

The recipe is very tasty but it needs something. I added some snap peas and fresh tomatoes to the stir-fry w/some ginger for taste, and it worked out really well.  my girl dug it.

Excellent and easy. Tips that were helpful: I cut pork when partially frozen so it sliced thinly.  I peeled Ginger with spoon .after cooking pork-I plated it and covered in foil and placed in microwave to keep warm. Meanwhile I reheated wok and added a tb. Of oil and added veggies for stir fry side.  Dinner was done by the time rice was done cooking. Great recipe- great flavor. Would be good with noodles too.

This was so easy and so good. Was looking for a quick weeknight dinner to use up some leftover pork tenderloin, and this hit the spot. I also added in some fresh chopped garlic with the ginger, and substituted a regular white wine for the rice wine because that is what I had.

If I could give this 20 stars I would!
I've been enlisted to start an "all Chinese" menu for 2 weeks or more, a la my husband and there have been 6 nights so far, when my husband dug into this with added stir fried veggies on Basmati rice, my husband said, "I think this is the best you've EVER made, yet!" and I agreed, along with all of our kids --except the 3 month old ;}!  Very, very good, nice & salty & with the WW points system, this was 8 with the cup of rice, lower it with brown rice!  Mmmm!
I ended up adding more soy & a bit more Tahini (sesame oil) & then 1/3 cup water with a heaping tsp of corn starch to make more 'gravy,' which was sensational, by the way.  No need to pass the salt.

This simple recipe is simply delicious!  I did not have dark soy sauce so i used all light.  Used rice wine vinegar plus a little white wine.  The sauce was perfect, really exceptional.  I added red pepper for color and served over rice.  A keeper!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is such a great base for a delicious dish.  I like to make dishes as the recipe indicates the first time around and then tweak if I want.  The next time I make this one, and I will make again, I will punch up the flavor quotient significantly  - with garlic, and then 1 other strong flavor such as black bean sauce, or chili sauce, etc.  Thanks Jenny for the great recipe!

This needed something extra.  First of all I doubled the soy sc. & rice wine.  Then I mixed two tablespoons of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water, then poured into the pan.  This makes it much thicker tastes great too.

We were a little disappointed in this one given all the great reviews.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  We ended up adding some stir fry sauce to it to give it more flavor.  Won't be making this again.

Very good, I add mushrooms, red peppers, onions, garlic and carrots before starting with the ginger. I serve it with shiratake angel hair (tofu noodles) and it was delicious. I will make it again :)

A good basic recipe that one can embellish.  I'd toss in 3-4 cloves of garlic, some greens,  eliminate the salt, and sub Splenda for the sugar.  I'd also toss in some hot chiles to kick it up a notch (Thai bird chiles, serranos, jalapenos would all work fine, or just use crushed red peppers like you'd put on a pizza).  Note that there are significant differences between regular soy sauce and dark soy sauce, so try to avoid the temptation to just use a single soy sauce.  I especially like the Pearl River brand of soy sauces which is available in Asian markets.

Great recipe but maybe you should- marinate meat at least 15/20 minutes with 1 tbsp oil, minced fresh ginger, soy sauce and sugar, take out the salt, use 1/2 tsp. sesame seed oil

I doubled the sauce and only used low sodium soy sauce.  Husband said "very good" and he's pretty critical!  I also used Basmati rice which was wonderful with this recipe.  We usually put garlic in everything and this was a very refreshing change of pace for us!

The recipe was good but I did make some changes.  I agree with other posts that their is already enough salt so I didn't add the extra salt but did substitute regular soy sauce for the dark.  I added water chestnuts, onions and bell peppers to make sure there were  plenty of veggies! An alright recipe overall.

Excellent flavor for such a simple dish.  I couldn't find dark soy sauce so I just added more of the regular soy sauce.

We thought this had a light and delicate taste, very enjoyable.  I made some changes to accomodate a healthier diet.  I used very lean pork, which I pre-marinated in soy sauce and ground ginger for about 6 hours, light soy sauce, Splenda, and only some cooking spray instead of the oils.  I also added a bit of minced garlic during the stir fry, and used snow peas for a vegetable addition.  I did add some extra ground ginger powder and soy sauce to accomodate for the extra vegetables.  Served over brown rice.

Very good.  FYI you need more than rice to go along with this, snow peas just sound like the right idea.  Also, add lots of ginger, don't be shy.

This was a wonderful dish.  It was quick & easy & tasted great.  I used all dark soy sauce & rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine.  I also used half of the salt that it called for & it wasn't too salty.  I then added mushrooms with the onions & it was a nice addition.  I will definatly make this again!

Very tasty and quick.  The combination of ginger, sugar and rice wine was flavorful. I made these changes - minced ginger in a jar (not powder) instead of fresh it's just easier - already cooked pork tenderloin from the night before - peanut oil, no sesame on hand - sugar snap peas and sauteed mushrooms, I like to cook these separate as they give off so much moisture. You could add any combination of veggies you like! I also added a bit of chicken stock and thickener to make more of a sauce.

Great recipe. As with any dish that uses soy sauce, be careful about adding additional salt. With the soy I use, half the suggested salt was sufficient.
Recommend making the rice very sticky, or having a more liquidy side curry. (Or you can bastardize the Chinese meal by incorporating some unsweetened yoghurt.)

Simple and delicious.  Very quick, and very tasty meal.  I didn't have dark soy, so I just added a little more reduced sodium soy.

DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSS. I doubled the ginger (healthy, yummy) and I could not find Chinese rice wine, so I looked it up- and you can substitute apple juice! Which I did- and this dish is absolutely fantastic and a new staple food in my house!

My whole family enjoyed this, which is saying a lot (not all like stir fries). I added shredded carrot, julienned snow peas, and julienned water chestnuts. As some other reviewers, I subbed rice vinegar for the wine (don't have the wine). Served with jasmine rice.

Very good!  I did cut back almost by half on the vegetable oil, and I only had regular soy sauce, so I just added the two soy amounts together.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  It tasted great!

This is an excellent stir-fry recipe.  I've been trying pork stir-fry recipes for a while now, and I feel my search is over!  I used thin sliced pork chops, removed all the fat, and cut into very fine strips.  I think this this size helped to keep the pork very tender.  Be sure not to overcook the pork.  It's not chicken - it can be a little pink in the middle.  I added a bag of frozen oriental stir-fry vegetables (thawed would have been better to reduce the amount of cooking time for the pork) after the pork was mostly done.  Used 1.5 lb of pork, so increased portion size to 12.  Do not increase the amount the veg. oil, but do follow the new measurements for sesame oil.  I had to substitute the rice wine with rice vinegar and dark soy sauce with regular (actually lite) soy sauce.  I omitted the salt as my husband always douses his chinese meals with soy sauce before trying it.  Excellent flavor - my two and four year old liked it.  I disagree that it is missing anything - but it certainly could be jazzed up any way you want.  Thank you for this recipe!

I will make for six servings next time.  I also added waterchestnuts and snowpeas.  very tasty.  Sesame oil is yummy.

Yum!  I was very impressed with how flavorful this dish was with the simplicity of the preparation.  I will most definately have it againa and again. My only complaint was that I thought it was very salty.  I will reduce the 1/2 teaspoon of salt to a dash next time.  Bravo Jenny!

This recipe is a great base to a meal. There is a great ginger flavor to it without it being overpowering -- but it is most certainly there. We added sticky white rice and some sauteed mushrooms. 
We made ours without dark soy sauce, we just added in extra soy sauce, and without Chinese rice wine, we used an American white wine instead. This is simply because we didn't have them readily available to us.
All and all, this is good but not yet perfect. We're going to play around with adding in carrots, snap peas, celery, water chestnuts, and other vegetables in various combinations to make this what we really want it to be.

This turns the pork to salty shoe leather.  After stirring in the sesame oil and rice wine, there is still a total of 1 Tbs plus 2 tsp of water-based liquid.  It is impossible to "simmer" something in less than 2 Tbs of liquid.

Great and easy but too salty. I will make this again but reduce the salt and add additional veggies.  Had to substitute pale dry sherry for the Chinese rice wine.  Everyone really liked it.

This recipe is a good base, but like many others have said - it is a little bland.  Adding garlic definitely helps.

This is a really great dish that I've made twice already. It's perfect, and the only addition I made was to add broccoli, and the second time I used chicken instead of pork. Excellent both times. My family loves this recipe. Thanks!!!

It was totally good.  I ommited the salt, used 1/4 of oil, total, for a triple recipe. (I had 12oz of pork to use up!)  I don't keep wine on hand, so I used rice wine vinegar, and I think it tasted just fine.  I also had 3 wrinkly bell pepper to use up and I chopped them added them into the triple recipe.  Carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, any stir fry veggies you like, they would all be good. I think a variation with some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and the addition of pineapple (along with the veggies) would be good too.

A good start, or else a quite plain pork dish.  Add more green onion to keep it just "pork-y".  Else round out the dish with some or all of the following chopped veg: med onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1-2 stalk celery, 1-2 carrots, 1 can straw mushrooms.  Sriracha to taste

Needed garlic and a lot more flavor for us. Also, 4 oz of meat constitutes a single serving. So this recipe effectively makes half what it says it does.

This was fine but rather bland, even with a lot of added vegetables. I probably would not make it again without significant alterations.

Found this to be a wonderful dish - especially the pork...  I found a marinated pork tenderloin and used it in the recipe. Used all of the recipe ingredients to cook up the pork. Only had cooking wine so I used that instead of Chinese rice wine. Added 1/2 of a bag of frozen Oriental veggies to the mix in the wok. Served on rice - NICE....

proportions seem to be off.....not enough food for the number of people and TOO much oil.  But, with adjustments for those things it was delicious.  I added carrots and snow peas from the garden.

This was alright but I had to make quite a few changes to it. I added 2 minced garlic cloves with the ginger. I also added shredded carrots and a can of sliced water chestnuts. I will use the base recipe again but it definetly needs some jazzing up.

This tasted like ginger candy.  It was really very tasty with a subtle heat.  The only addition I made was that I added a bit of garlic to really make the ginger pop.

My family was not thrilled with this recipe.  It was very bland.  If I were to make it in the future, I would definitely marinate the pork ahead of time, and cook it in batches to keep it tender.  But all in all, I don't even think this recipe is worth improving on.

This was great!  I used it with left over pork.  I increased the recipe for serving for 8...this made the meat much jucier.  My son enjoyed his as a Chinese pulled pork sandwich and the rest of the family enjoyed it over rice.  I used fresh ginger root.  Instead of rice wine, I used rice wine vinegar..that was all I had.  I also added about 1 T. of (drinkable) sherry.  It was great!!!

Delicious flavours.  Had no rice wine, but used rice vinegar instead.  Added about 3 cups of vegetables (julienned carrots and red peppers) toward end of cooking and stir fried and sautéed until tender crisp.  Added nice colour and crunch to this dish.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent. I used onion and celery for the vegetables, only because of on-hand inventory. The meal was terrific. I otherwise followed the directions verbatim.

Sorry, I just couldn't get into this. As is it was 'blah'. Even after I doctored it up (alot) no one was thrilled with it. I won't bother with it again.

This was tasty but it needed some kind of sauce to go with it.

Wonderful flavors, simple to make, takes no time at all to prepare!  I had this with a side of stir fried veggies & some left over rice!  The only thing I did differently was used rice wine vinegar and added some fresh chopped garlic as others suggested.  Thank you for a nice dinner idea!

Easy to put together. And, you can omit the half-teaspoon of salt, given the sodium that's already in the soya sauce.

followed exactly, well, except for corn starch, didn't have any on hand. oh, and i used less oil. (i made some brown rice & veggies on the side, bok choy & red bell pepper, but otherwise followed recipe pretty closely for the protein). hubs definitely liked it better than I but it lacked oomph in my opinion.  next time, b/c i will make it again as it was super easy, i will add garlic, more ginger and siracha!

This totally hits the spot!  I double the meat though, and add a little more spice to it like red peppers.  It's a delicious and simple dish!

I really enjoyed this pork recipe it was terrific over brown rice.  I made it with mirin (Japanese sweetened rice wine) in place of the Chinese rice wine listed because it's what I had on hand.  I also added fresh sugar snap peas right before serving.  If you love ginger like I do, you will enjoy this meal.

Are there any more stars to give? This was fantastic! I quadrupled the amount of pork and doubled the amount of everything else (except the salt, I only used a pinch). I only had dark soy sauce and like many other users rice wine vinegar. I served it with snow peas and rice. As soon as it was gone my husband was already craving more. This will probably be added to the monthly rotation of amazing recipes. Thank you!
