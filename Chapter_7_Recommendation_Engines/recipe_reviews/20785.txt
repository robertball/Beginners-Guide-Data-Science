Everyone enjoyed this recipe as a great side dish!  I modified it to make it a bit healthier by cooking the onions, celery, and garlic in 1/4 cup vegetable broth, instead of the butter, and it came out great.  Thanks for a quick and easy addition to any meal!

My mother use to make this all the time. We make in a electric skillet & use 4 to 5 slices of bacon & use the grease from bacon drippings to the cabbage. Gives a much better flavor than regular butter. When finished cruble bacon pieces on top.. Yum yum good.........

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I didn't have any stewed tomatos on hand, but did have two can of "Hunt's diced tomatoes with balsamic vinegar, basil and olive oil" which I threw in.  Wow! The flavor was fantastic!  Even my picky husband liked it.  This was a new dish for us and it will be a keeper!

A great recipe.  However, as a person of Polish descent married to a Polish man we prefer to omit tomatoes and to throw in caraway seeds.  My grandmother prepared her's that way and it brings out a new taste.

This dish has become a favorite at our house. Everyone raves about it -- even people who swore they hated cabbage. Usually I sautee sliced sweet Italian sausage and add a bit of anise seed. Which makes a darned good dish.   This evening, I was feeling a little adventuresome and wanted something more spicy. And seasoned the pot with basil, rosemary and thyme. Then, I added a can of Wye River crab soup at the end and heated through. Oh my gosh -- my husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven!

Yummmm! Sounds weird but boy was it GOOD. Even hubby who made a bad face at it, ate the whole bowl full. Followed the recipe but did add about a TBSP of bacon grease (it's a Southern thing! :)
Chopped the cabbage up and only had to cook it about 25 minutes or so. I used a sweet Vadalia onion, which I thought was a bit "too" sweet, next time would use regular yellow onion or half regular, half Vadalia. Will make this again. Thank you!

It was pretty nice and easy. Though, I doubled the stalks of cellery and the cloves of garlic; I also used some thyme. The result was good, and I am glad to have some leftover to eat it tomorrow.
I also recommend to let it stand more than half an hour after cooking; the cooler it gets, the better it becomes.

Very tasty. My kids ate it and they are pickey eaters.  Stewing the cabbage and onions gave it a delicate sweetness that was well balanced my tomatoes. I will make it again, but I might try adding some smoked kielbsa.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I had made this twice, and it is absolutely delicious! I am a cabbage lover, and now this is my favorite way of preparing and eating it.  Only things I did different, I doubled the recipe to make a large pot, so I used 2 large cans of stewed tomatoes, ( I love tomatoes too) 2 heads of cabbage, and added a splash of olive oil.  This turned out great! If you like a little more sauce or just love tomatoes, I recommend adding the extra stewed tomatoes. I served this over homemade mashed potatoes, and just served right out of a bowl without anything, and had many compliments. I could eat this dish every day! I will definitely use this recipe very often! Thanks Kim

I'm always looking for good cabbage recipes since it is such a great diet food.  I sprayed my pan with Pam instead of using butter and it worked well.  I did end up adding just a little olive oil to keep the onions from burning on the bottom after about 10 minutes. I used about 4 celery stalks- we like celery.  I also added 1 can kidney beans (rinsed and drained) the last 10 minutes to add some fiber and filling and it was wonderful!  Will definitely be making again.  I highly recommend the addition of kidney beans :)

Great low carb version of pasta.  I add a little bit of red pepper flake for heat and top with a little bit of feta.

LOVED IT! Even my super picky sister had some! I used a can of Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes, which just added more flavor. This made A TON, I served it to six people, with half having more than one huge helping and I still had some left over (yum).  My suggestions: leave out the salt, since canned tomatoes come with plenty already. Also, go with what other reviewers said and use olive oil rather than butter to saute.

I love this recipe and have made it for years.  My mom made it when we were growing up and she always fried some cut up bacon and then added the onions, celery and garlic when the bacon was nearly done.  The bacon gives it a great flavor and goes well with the other ingredients.  It's a meal I always look forward to putting on the table.

This was so good! satisfied my polish needs. I added some sauerkraut as well and then served it over mashed potatoes. while it was cooking I also put a bay leaf and pepper corns in a tea ball, and removed it once the stew was done. highly recommend these additions. this would also be great with some cut up sausage in it too.

First I have to say I like my cabbage with butter, salt and pepper; the true simple “COMFORT FOOD” way; add some "smash on your plate" boiled potatoes and I'm a happy camper. This is now my 2nd favorite cabbage recipe; and sorry... although you health conscious eaters may cringe… the butter is a MUST! Since I don't care for the sweetness of stewed tomatoes, I used a large can of whole plum tomatoes (chopped), along with the juice.  I also upper the celery (2 ribs), added 1/2 a medium green pepper (diced), 1/2 a can of water, and a sprinkle of oregano.... delicious!!!

My mother made a dish similar to this that was out of this world.  She cooked the cabbage with a HALF can of tomatoes, a large sweet onion and pork ribs or kielbasa on low for at least an hour (the cabbage was very limp).  She then made a rue browning flour with butter and added that to thicken it and served it over mashed potatoes. One thing that will ruin it though is too much tomato.  My daughter struggled trying to make this and could never get it the way she remembered it.  When we finally made it together, the problem was too much tomato. I would highly recommend only 1/2 can or it will dilute the cabbage flavor.  Wonderful.  Give it a try.

This was good to me, but my husband wasn't lovin it. If you like cabbage, I think you'll like this though. I found that it didn't taste near as good the next day. For the summer time, however, this is a good healthy dish to go to.

This is quite delicious.  Accidentally added an extra can of diced tomatoes and it was fine.  This definitely needs to be spiced up!  I added some Italian seasoning and crushed red peppers.  The red peppers are a must!  Excellent as leftovers too.  The 16 month old scarfed it down as did his parents.

Very good. I used this as a jumping-off point for a Middle Eastern interpretation. I added about 2tbsp of zataar, a LOT of garlic, a can of chick peas, and about a tbsp of harisa. Simmered for probably half an hour until the tomatoes had sweetened up. Delicious!!

I added 80% lean turkey sausage which I sauteed first, and used spicy seasoned salt. Next time I will omit the celery as a matter of personal preference, as I don't think it added anything to the flavor of the cabbage. Overall good comfort food.

I thought this was pretty good but my picky husband loved it so much he was pretty much begging me to make it again. I did make some changes though. I added 2 chopped up carrots and added some vegetarian sausage after it was all done. We ate it over rice. I would like to say that even if you are not a vegetarian, the morningstar veggie sausage links are delicious in this...they give it just the right amount of flavor without all of the fat and cholesterol.

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!  How could something this simple be SOOOO GOOOD!  I used the Fat Free I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and inexpensive store brand (Meijer) petite diced tomatoes with sweet onions. I also cut down the simmer time to 20 mins so the cabbage had some crunch---EXCELLENT surrounding a chicken breast.  Thanks!

I know it would need more flavor so I added more garlic, some thyme, and some red chili flakes. It was very good. Would not have made it as written-looks too bland for me.

It needs a little more flavor, was a little too bland. All in all was a good side dish in my Thanksgiving dinner.

I was looking for something like a comfort food for the winter and couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.  After reading some of the other reviews, I improvised and put in a lot of additional stuff but the kitchen sink, including ground mustard, celery seed, caraway seeds, some cut up carrots, potatoes, apple cider vinegar & homemade raspberry vinegar.  Seasoned to taste with seasoned salt & pepper, and turned out to be what I wanted.

I bought cabbage on a whim and realized I had no clue what to do with it. I found this recipe and it was wonderful! I had always heard how stewed cabbage is really good but didn't know it would taste like this. It was wonderful, thanks so much.

This was really good! My husband even liked it, and he isn't the biggest fan of cabbage dishes. I added a little seasoned salt to it, and it was delish!! I halved the recipe and it still a lot. Will definitely make this again!!

This recipe is OK. It's not the best cabbage I've ever had, but not the worst either (by a long shot--there are some truly awful recipes out there!).

I added a bit of nutmeg that I grated myself (this is one of those things that I won't use pre-ground). It added a nice touch. I just grated it right over the pot, but it was probably about 1/4 tsp.

Warning the cooking time at the top of the recipe is calculated incorrectly. The directions of the recipe are accurate, though. If you add up the times in the directions the cook time is more like one hour, not 40 minutes.  Finally, in the first step, I went with the short end of the time because the celery and onions will continue to soften during the rest of the cooking. So, I cooked onions and celery for about 2 minutes, then added the chopped garlic for the last minute (don't cook garlic the full time or it may burn and get bitter).

Again, not my favorite recipe, but I will likely make it again because I'm always looking for a variety of ways to get cabbage in my diet.

My family loved this recipe, I used another viewer suggestion and added caraway seeds.  Also I added some polish sausage to the top when it had 20 minutes left and we served it over rice.  It was a complete meal and tasted wonderful! Served with a side of homemade chunky applesauce.

I loved this.  I used a little bit of olive oil, too, as well as about a half cup of chicken broth.  Left out the salt, as we are trying to watch our salt content.  Hubby had some thyme out in the garden, so we threw that in also.  What I love about this recipe is that it is so versatile. The possibilities of add-ons are endless.  You can go totally vegetarian, or add meat.    I might try potatoes in this sometime.  Also, I bet this would convert to the crock pot beautifully.

Made the following changes to suit our tastes: chopped and cooked about 6 oz. of bacon before adding the veggies; added an extra can of tomatoes, and seasoned with Cajun seasoning instead of salt.  It was really good though next time I'll omit the 2nd can of tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious!!!   I will be making this a lot!  I only had half a head of cabbage, so I halved everything except the tomatoes and garlic and I didn't cook it as long as the recipe called for...only because we like our cabbage with a  slight crunch to it.  Yummmmmm!!!  Thank you, Kim, for a great recipe to add to my collection.

This was sooooooooooooo good, that I was worried that it would be gone before I got it to the table. ( I kept tasting it)  I only had a 1/2 a head of cabbage, so I basically 1/2 the recipe except for the stewed tomatoes, and let it simmer on low for about 1 hr.  This was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was quite good.  I had to make a slight adjustment, though, because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used a bag of frozen onion, celery, and carrot blend instead of the onions and celery.  I followed the provided directions, and tasted it while the tomatoes were simmering.  As is, it is a good recipe, and would have earned 5 stars had I left it be.  I decided I wanted soup, though, so I added a can of vegetable broth and continued to simmer.  That was good as well.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

This was wonderful. I just happened to have some Benton's bacon from breakfast already prepared, so I used about 3 tablespoons of the drippings with 1 tablespoon butter. My guests asked for the recipe ~ a good sign. Served it with "Best Ever Brisket" and "Easy Polenta With Tomato Sauce". All Recipes is my go-to source these days!

Cooked this in addition with Chicken Cordon Bleu (from this site) for yesterday's dinner and it was fabulous.  Never thought of adding tomatoes to cabbage but am glad I did, but I used sun dried tomatoes which made them oh so tasty.   I also left out the celery which I am not a fan of and cooked it in beef broth.  I cooked a few slices of maple bacon along with the onions prior to inserting the cabbage. Great website.

This dish was surprisingly good! I'm generally not a fan of cabbage but received a small head of it in my bi-weekly farmer's market delivery and couldn't let it go to waste!  Rather than use the full amount of butter I added 1/4 cup of vegetable broth and 1 tbsp of butter... I will definitely be making this one again!

Great recipe, I fed it to my husband tonight and it silenced the jokes about me planting 18 heads of cabbage in the garden this winter. A few changes that we liked: doubled the amount of tomatoes, added a few diced carrots, added some Mrs. Dash, and followed JUSTJEN33's suggestion to sub bacon for the butter. Yum. Who knew cabbage could be this tasty?

Made this dish the other night and followed it exactly EXCEPT I added some fresh red chili peppers and an extra clove of garlic.
It was so delicious that both me and hubby finished it all on its own--without a main or side dish!

Would pair great with a flavorful meatloaf, roasted chicken, grilled seafood or meat.

This was not quite spicy enough for us so I added more garlic and some Greek Seasoning.  This is really good with Polish sausage either cut up in it or on the side.

Very nice little dish and easy to repair.  You really have to not pay attention to overcook cabbage.  I thought the cooking time seemed a bit long but the cabbage was just the way I like it.  I would recommend a little more garlic but I think that of nearly every dish.  I'll keep this nice little friendly dish.

Delicious and easy! I used extra butter and first fried up some Polish sausage in the butter, then added the onion and celery (extra celery). I also put it all in the slow cooker and cooked it that way after first frying the sausages and onions celery and garlic. I also added at least a teaspoon or two of cilantro.

I love cabbage but plain Jane boiled cabbage is boring.  I followed the recipe here for the most part. I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes on hand so I use diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup each V8 and water.  Excellent results.  I'll be making this again and again.

I made this for my boyfriend and his roommate during one of my visits to go with some naked chicken because I was feeling lazy (I usually go all out). The guys LOVED it. Sometimes a man just wants some simple food.

I will definitely make this recipe again!  All of the ingredients were right here on hand in my kitchen.  I used the advice of an earlier reviewer and added ground sausage to the onions an celery, cooked them together, added minced garlic, cabbage, and then a can of whole roma peeled tomatoes and juice.  I also added a tablespoon of pesto, a tablespoon of hidden valley ranch seasoning, and salt/pepper.  It was great!

I really enjoyed this! I used a full head of cabbage, added an additional stalk of celery, and used 3 cloves garlic. After reading other reviews, I also added some thyme and oregano, 1/2 pkg real bacon pieces, and 1/2 cup of beef broth to the mixture while simmering. Covered, I cooked it for an hour, stirring occasionally.

Wow!  This dish got my husband to admit he likes cabbage!  The sugar from the tomatoes kind of carmelizes in the pan for a great flavor.  No need to change anything.  Stir periodically in the last step.

It is so close to how my mother made it. She would use canned whole tomatoes slightly diced and a can of whole kernel corn. Then add cooked rice to the finished product once it was all cooked. We called it chopped up cabbage roll.

Very good recipe. I added a little water, because I wasn't sure there was enough liquid for the 40 minutes I steamed the cabbage. I didn't leave anything out but added some smoked paprika and some cumin and dried thyme (all in moderation). 
It turned out really well, and my almost teenaged daughter liked it served with rice.

Super delicious and so simple to make. I added a bay leaf and thyme because I like spice but other than that followed it to a T.

My mother often made a polish dish that is almost the same:  I cooked the bacon and drained all but 1-2TB of the bacon grease to cook the onion, (no celery) and then stirred in the chopped cabbage.  I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes (with garlic and olive oil), salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp caraway seeds,  1/2 cup of salsa, 1 tsp each of sugar and vinegar  and a large pinch of crushed red pepper, for extra flavour and bite.  Bring to a simmer, add 1 lb  smoked turkey meat, cut into chunks, and let it simmer over low heat for 45 min - 1 hr or until tender (Kielbasa is good too).  We also add a little sour cream to top it, after serving.  Yuuuuummmmmmmmyyy. It's very good over mashed potatoes.

Great recipe, but I'll admit that I used it more for inspiration and changed it a bit.  

I didn't have celery, so I substituted in some mushrooms in the place of celery. I also added two fresh tomatoes along with beef broth instead of using canned tomatoes. I'm big on herbs and added bay leaf and parsley too.

I really didn't understand this dish. I only had 1/2 cabbage, so I cut the recipe in half. Other than that I followed it exactly. After I added the stewed tomatoes, 20 minutes later the dish was dry. I covered it and used the exact temperature listed. So, I decided to add the full can for half the recipe. I added the salt and pepper and tasted it, and it doesn't have much flavor. I will have to add some seasonings and see what I can do. I have eaten steamed cabbage that even seemed to have more flavor. Not sure what happened with this one. I liked the idea of all of the vegetables.

This is a terrific inexpensive recipe!  I used olive oil instead of butter and it was super tasty, I imagine it would be OUT OF THIS WORLD as written( with butter).  This was an excellent way to use up the cabbage I purchased on "st. Patrick's day" special.  Delicate, balanced, DELICIOUS!  Many thanks Kim!

Recipe as written is lacking salt. I had to add some to my recipe. The final product was still lacking overall flavor. It needs some spices or something. Another reviewer added bacon which sounds delicious, however, since I am vegetarian, that isn't an option for me. Not sure why this recipe is 5 stars.

Great starter recipe.  Added extra stewed tomatoes. Added carrots.  Lots of salt in tomatoes, so left the extra salt out.  Added some cooked chicken sausage the last 10 minutes and served this all as a main course.

This was OK. I really love cabbage and was excited about this recipe, but I prefer just plain cabbage with s&p. I think this recipe has such a high rating because many people added some sort of meat to theirs, which, of course, would make it delicious. But, as a vegetarian dish, it is missing a certain something.

I loved this but I am a veggie lover.  Kids ate it pretty well.  As I prepared it I realized that it had many of the veggies Dr Oz had recently reccomended for avoiding cancer so that is a major bonus.  After I had that thought, I tossed in some carrots and a bit of turmeric to make it even healtlhier.  One thing I may do differently is thicken the juice up with some cornstarch.

WOW!  Absolutely delicious!  No leftovers on this dish.  Instead of butter, I fried a couple of pieces of bacon and used the grease to saute the onions and celery, then crumbled the bacon into the cabbage later.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes.  So good and so easy!  Next time, I am going to add some sausage and use it as a main dish with some boiled potatoes.  Thanks for a keeper receipe!!

This recipe was awesome.  I took the suggestion from another review and cooked the cabbage with bacon grease and then crumbled it on top to serve, it turned out great.  My husband is half polish and his mother is an excellent cook, he told me she would be impressed with this dish.  I served this with "Mimi's Slumgullion" off of this site and it was an excellent meal.  I will be making this again.

Excellent recipe as is.  I like to use green peppers instead of celery and sometimes add small can of tomato sauce for extra tomato.  Even better the next day.  You don't have to be a cabbage lover to enjoy this recipe.

This is the first time I have ever made anything with cabbage! The only thing I've ever eaten that had cabbage in it is egg rolls, so hence, my apprehension with this type of vegetable. I decided with St. Patty's Day that I would try something new and I picked this recipe. I actually had to go to work that night, so my husband and son got to eat it fresh. They really liked it. I ate it two days later and it was still really, really good! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because, well, I don't have much experience with cabbage. But I will definitely make this one again and again!!

This was very good! After reading some reviews, I made some changes; some I would do again, others I wouldn't. I added balsamic vinegar while the vegetables were stewing (good), some tabasco sauce (good), and I added a zucchini that I wanted to use up (good). I unfortunately doubled the tomatoes which was bad, as there way too much liquid. Next time I will add basil and oregano b/c it could use more flavour.

With modifications, this recipe is a 5 star!  I would think without the changes that it would be pretty bland.  I made mine into a meal by adding meat and rice and it was delicious!  This is what I changed....fried sliced kielbasa in 3T butter.  Added the onion, celery and changed the garlic to 4 cloves minced.  Did add 4 large spoonfuls of chicken broth to the cabbage during the simmer stage.  Added 2 cans of Italian stewed tomatoes (cut my tomotoes into bite size pieces), 10 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, 2 pinches of thyme, Red Hot hot sauce, salt and pepper.  I had some leftover rice that I threw in at the end and it was delicious!  I also only cooked it approx 15 minutes covered as my cabbage was good and tender!

Terrific!  I absolutely loved it.  I thought that it would be bland, but the stewed tomatoes made it very sweet.  I might try italian stewed tomatoes next time.  I did add some bacon pieces, because that's the way my husband likes it (I prefer not).  But it was still very good.  I did as one suggested and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 canola oil.  I cut the simmer time to 10 minutes and the  cooking time from 30-35 to 15 minutes simply because I like my veggies not so mushy.  Great recipe and I can see that it's very versatile.   I made 1/2 the recipe and it was perfect for 2 adults and 1 child.

Really good and easy cabbage side dish. I made the leftovers into a quick soup adding chicken broth, a tiny splash of red wine vinegar, and a dash of Tabasco. Will be making regularly. Thanks.

Not bad, but I prefer 'Indiana-Style Fried Cabbage' from this site WAY more. This would be much improved with some crumbled bacon. As written, I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway!

my hubby devoured this. i altered the recipe slightly.  i used traditional spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, added some adobo, lots of garlic powder (instead of the garlic cloves), used one onion, and tehn used 10 slices of bacon that i sauteed before hand.  

Hubby couldnt stop raving about it, though he was skeptical at first because he does not like cabbage, and rolled his eyes when i told him we were having cabbage stew. he definitely was expecting the worst, but had the best.

definitely 5 stars!!!!

Good tasty comfort food that fits my low carb lifestyle.  I used more garlic because I like it.  Very tasty and easy to make.  My Mom used to make a similar cabbage dish with potatoes and ham in it which made a very hearty meal with some crusty bread and butter :)

This was fantastic!!  Even my 4 year old thought it was good once I got her to try it.  I added the thyme like other readers suggested and that made it for me, I wouldn't make it without it.  I also added twice the amount of garlic.  I cant wait to make this again!!!!

My family loved this recipe! We ate all of it at one sitting! My family especially liked the addition of the stewed tomatoes. I, not being a fan of cooked tomatoes thought it was good but would have been better with more butter and no tomatoes! Still, we will definitely be making this again!

After hearing that eating cabbage on New Year's Day is a good way to welcome a prosperous year, I went searching for the perfect recipe. I stumbled upon this one, and was quite pleased. I used two celery stalks, and added some thyme and basil. I am a vegetarian, and was going to make some tofu on the side, but decided to put it into the stewed cabbage dish. I served it on top of basmati rice (that was what I had) and it was great. A wonderful New Year's meal. Thanks, Kim.

It is delicious!  I used a crockpot since I do not have a large saucepan.  I added 10 minutes to be sure the cabbage was soft.    I added diced tomatoes because I did not have stewed tomatoes on hand.  It is very good.

I used bacon as another reviewer suggested but I also added about 3 tablespoons of butter as well. Otherwise exactly the same as the recipe is written and it turned out amazing. Love this and will definitely keep it in my favorites for the future.

Used a little bit of EVOO to saute carrot, onion, celery, and garlic.  Added cabbage, then stewed tomatoes.  Fabulous!

This was fantastic!  I used a little bacon grease instead of butter and, after adding the cabbage, only simmered for about 5 minutes before my husband tasted it and said THIS IS PERFECT! He ate on it for two days and was asking me to make more.
Great dish!

I omitted the celery. I also added italian seasoning. I also used petite diced tomatoes. I cut the cabbage into small bite size pieces. It makes it easier to eat.

I made this the other day in my Instant Pot.  I decided to save time by not sautéing the onions but just threw it all it together in the IP and mixed the ingredients well.  I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of just 1.  I also added about 3/4 cup water to the pressure cooker as I was not sure there was enough liquid in the tomatoes to have the IP come to pressure.  Because we like our cabbage fully tender, I set the IP for 13 minutes.  It came out perfect.   I served this over rotini (spiral noodles).  It was very good, but giving it four stars as I believe it could use some additional spice or heat to make it a little more interesting.

First time making this and it was perfect! 
I added extra carrot and celery (and then some more after some hungry fingers snuck into the pot), and the flavour came out perfectly. Used President's Choice Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes, and added a quarter cup of tomato sauce before covering for the long haul. 
Everyone loved it!

Followed recipe, but can't get clove garlic at my local grocer (nearest supermarket, 50 miles) so used garlic powder. Will definitely make it again, especially once I get some garlic cloves. One other thing, added a splash of AC Vinegar; I add that to almost all my recipes for its health benefits.
Add a side salad & you can get 5-6 servings.

Yes, I will make this again. I didn't pay attention to the proportions, just threw in what I had around, including a broccoli stalk from the fridge--same family, right? Taste-tested it and added some "ras el hanout," Moroccan seasoning.  My Spanish family had never had anything quite like this; all loved it, even the kids.

If you like cabbage and you like tomatoes, you'll like this dish.  I had some cabbage to use up in the fridge and was lucky enough to have a can of no salt added diced tomatoes with italian seasonings in the cupboard.   I used more garlic and celery than listed and put in veggie broth instead of butter.  Turned out great!  I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe called for, closer to 1.5 hours.  And I took the advice of another poster and added a can of drained kidney beans.  Perfect dish for a nutritarian such as myself as well as my husband who  enjoys eating vegetarian every other day.  Thanks for the simple, healthy, delicious recipe! :)

I've made this twice, once as directed, the second time with 1/2 the butter, added 1/2 tsp each of oregano, basil, thyme, three slices of finely julienned Canadian bacon and two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  Excellent both times!

I didn't have a head of cabbage (I thought there was one in the fridge)  just a large package of coleslaw mix. I did do all the rest of the recipe and added red pepper flakes because I can't seem to make a dish without them. It was amazingly delicious! Thank you Kim!

Terms like "medium" head cabbage, cut into "squares", 2 onions, etc are not nearly as helpful as actual measurements like "3 cups cabbage cut into 1 inch squares" and 1 1/2 cups chopped onions.  I improvised a lot with the amounts, but the ingredients tasted good together and it turned out fine.

Loved it, but used two slices of applewood smoked bacon instead of butter.  Turned out great.  I do serve it over white rice.

This was fine, but I thought it needed more flavor.  I wound up putting salad dressing on some of it and I liked it better that way, although it wasn't terrible on its own.  It's not good enough for me to make again.  The reviewers who added bacon were on the right track, I think, because that would probably make this much better.

We followed the recipe that was given. It was good, but not enough flavor for our pallet. We are going to try it again, but this time we will double the sauté ingredients. Even talked about adding some sausage. Will let you know. Greatest point is we have people we know who vegetarian, and now we can invite them to dinner with something we have tried.

This was darn good!  It took a little longer (I like my cabbage soft) but it tasted like a pasta dish.  Served it to company with kielbasa w beer sauce and pierogis on the side, we were licking our plates clean!

I made this on New Years Day for My skeptical family. They were not crazy about cabbage with tomatoes.... Well They LOVED it!!!!  Making it again for the second time in two weeks. I doubled the recipe for our large family and used one can of plain stewed tomato and one with garlic,basil, oregano....... Delish!

This is very good.  Even DH liked it.  Made as written but had no bell peppers or celery, so used some celery seeds and a can of hunts stewed tomatoes with celery and bell peppers.  Excellent side dish.  thank you for sharing this.  This will be a frequent dish at our house.

Tasty recipe!  Instead of stewed tomatoes I used 2 T of tomato paste added some fennel seeds.  Used electric skillet and sauted the celery and onion and added some bell pepper with veggie broth.  Really nice flavor and simple to make!

I didn't want to put diced tomatoes in, since my kids don't like them, so I used tomato paste and water instead.  Great flavor.

This recipe surprised me- in a good way! I could not believe how such an easy recipe with so few ingredients could end up making something so truly delicious. I followed it exactly-but because we wanted to enjoy it as a main course- added some smoked beef sausage-(cut up)as the cabbage simmered-and because I love tomatoe-added a bit more as well.. I did also add apprx 1 tbsp sugar as it simmered because I like a tad bit of sweetness- but wow- how good it ended up because the sausage lent just the right amount of smokey flavoring- to balance it out to one big- YUM! Thank you so much for posting. I will definitely make this again.

This was great. The celery and onion add a depth of flavor and sweetness that is very tasty. I used several stalks of celery and more garlic (maybe 4 cloves). I also used a can of stewed tomatoes with celery and onions. I will definitely be making this healthy dish again!

This recipe was very good. I did add about 3 tbsp of red wine vinegar to give it a little twist. Turned out really good. And I didn't any butter. Made it a few times and once I used bacon fat. The next time I used olive oil and both times it turned out great!

I make this all the time as a side dish. The recipe (okay, stewing in general) is very forgiving, so don't worry too much about portions or ingredients.

My first real disappointment with recipes found on this site. I selected it for my cabbage loving husband who likes cabbage so much he was stealing some raw pieces while I was cutting it. First it would not soften, I had to add water( so it would not burn)and keep cooking it; then the next day(yes I had to fix something else in a hurry for that evening)when my husband tasted it, he could stand only a bite or two he asked why it was so sour( I did not change the recipe). I finally  threw away all of it. Pretty upsetting when it was made with a really fresh organic cabbage which was delicious raw, I would have made it in coleslaw if I could find a recipe for the coleslaw dressing like they serve in Long John Silver, my husband likes that one!

I made this with a couple of strips of bacon instead of the butter (fried up the bacon, used that fat instead of butter) but otherwise stayed pretty true to the recipe.  It was kind of boring, to be honest.  I kept WANTING it to be worth 4.5 stars, but, alas, it never was.  OK, not great.

This is delicious just the way the recipie is.  It calls for a 1/4 stick of butter so maybe it's not super healthy but I think some cabbage is better than none.  Easy and yummy!

Loved it! I added a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes and some fresh basil. Really good cabbage recipe. Great as a side dish. At some beans or crumbled tofu for a vegetarian main dish. As others have said, it would also be great with some kielbasa or ground beef.

Ok, I'm Irish and I adore cabbage, so for me this recipe is to die for.  I didn't change a thing, served with Pork Roast with Thyme from this site and mashed potatoes.  Entire family loved this dish, my 14 year old son had two big helpings.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.  I will make this again and again.

This recipe is outstanding!  I substituted EVOO for the butter, added a total of 4 celery stalks, and 4 cloves of garlic (all favorite ingredients) and it was excellent!  VERY simple to make, doesn't require a lot of attention while cooking and presents beautifully.

Pretty good. Goes great with white rice. Followed the suggestions and added crumbled bacon on top. The bacon's saltiness really added to the dish, which is a little bland. Red pepper flakes also gave it a nice kick. I think next time, I'm either going to add more bacon or make this with kielbasa for more flavor.

1/4 cup of butter was a bit too much, only needs about 2T. I made it without the stewed tomatoes (did not have them) and it was delicious.

Delicious!  Made just a couple of changes.  1. put 3-4 stalks of celery because I love celery.  2. used olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier.  Great recipe!

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I did use olive oil instead of butter and increased the garlic cloves to 4 just because of my families personal taste.  I will be making this again in the future.  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this was very good.  Strangely it was very simple, but quite good.  I think I added a little garlic too, if I remember correctly.

This is the best cabbage I have ever eaten! I am not a fan of cabbage (or any veggie) cooked with meat or in animal fat so this is awesome!  My husband (who would prefer the animal fat versions) LOVED it so much he had 3 helpings! Super easy and I will make again and again!

Very good recipe.  I made a variation of it- I added two cans of stewed tomatoes since I like tomatoes. It was pretty good. A little on the sweet side. Maybe next time, I add one can stewed, one can plain diced tomatoes.

One of my favorites for years now. I plan on trying it with a little bacon in the pan to see if that bumps the flavor up even more. Yummy!

I spiced it up a bit with Rotel along with the stewed tomatoes and also added some cayanne, red pepper flakes and some spicy sausage. I also doubled the garlic and celery. Had to use bacon drippings also, (It is a southern thing)  My picky eaters curled up their noses while cooking.  But they ended up loving it. My sister-in-law was visiting while I was cooking and she said she hated cabbage.  She tasted it and loved it!  She said that I should be proud, as that was the first cabbage that she has ever eaten because of the smell.  Great recipe! I love making new dishes and the "I told you so!" factor.

This is an all-around great recipe!  I added 1 1/2 tbsp of Better Than Bouillon, Chicken flavored to the recipe and it only enhanced the flavor.   My kids love it and everyone who's tasted it loves it.  A real keeper.

Just made this recipe today to go along with a pork roast and everyone thorougly enjoyed it.  Quick and easy.  Mild flavor and all of the ingredients go together well.  For those who like a little heat, a few drops of tabasco or other hot sauce goes well in this dish.  Rather than use 1/4 cup butter, I used half that (2 tbsp) plus 2 tbsp canola oil with no problems.  Also, if this is four servings, they are large servings.  In my opinion, if eating this as a side dish, it's closer to 6 or 8 servings (but served with some good cornbread, this would make a good, cheap meal.)  This is a keeper and I will be making it again.

Very yummy! I put a serious dash of balsamic vinegar in while it was cooking the first 15 minutes (before the tomatoes were added). I put in about 2x as many tomatoes as called for since I read earlier reviews recommending more tomatoes. Also, it was pretty dry-looking so I added about 1 cup of chicken broth and simmered it all until the liquid was mostly gone.

Even my 3-year-old said he liked it.

A fairly simple recipe that fits the bill and is conveniently vegan. Somewhat bland, although can be spiced up with additional vinegar (rosewine or basalmic worked well) and a bit of sugar.

I thought this was very good, I'm not a real big fan of cabbage, but I am now!  The only change I made was I added a can of tomato sauce.  I thought it needed more liquid.  This was delish!  Will make again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  We added red pepper flakes and oregano and served it over jasmine rice with shrimp and it was fantastic.  Super easy and very tasty.  I halved the recipe and found that I only needed to cook for about 20 minutes.

Had never had stewed cabbage before and this was awesome . . . my entire family looks forward to when I make it.  We like to add some smoked sausage in while it's cooking and double the tomatoes for a complete meal.  YUMMY!!

Very easy and very good.  A good side dish  when it's cold outside.

It really wasn't what I had expected. Both my boyfriend and I thought it was lacking something, unsure as to what it was though.

Made this for company and all seemed to really like it.  Seconds were the norm and it was all gone!  I personally thought it was a 3.  Seemed to take on a sweet taste which I didn't expect.  I'll try it again with the vegetable broth like one review suggested to skip on the fat content.

This was really unique recipe. I enjoyed this version of stewed cabbage. I added some red pepper flakes for a kick. This has 4 Points per serving if you do WW. :) That could probably be lowered greatly by reducing the butter by half.

Simple, easy, and good.  I used two fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones, and it turned out really well.  I omitted the celery because I didn't have any, which didn't seem to matter.

I took the advice about adding Greek seasoning. Instead of butter, I used about 2 tbsp. of bacon grease. (My Alabama granny never cooked without it.) This is a good recipe -- oh, and increase the garlic by one clove.

This dish has a lot of flavor.  I only made half of the recipe for two of us, and there was a lot left over. The recipe makes a lot. Yummy!  I will make this again.

LOVED IT!  I tweeked this recipe just a little.  I didn't have any celery (wasn't missed).  I used 2 T. butter and 2 T. parkay fat-free butter spray.  I also seasoned the cabbage with kosher salt and pepper before adding the tomatoes.  And, I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  My toddlers even ate this!!  Definately will make again.

It was ok the first night.  It tasted a lot better the second day.  I did put diced bacon in it which added a little more flavor.

Plain doesn't mean a recipe can be 4 or 5 stars.  This was easy and good.

I really liked this recipe, very good side dish or main dish w/ rice. Not super flavorful, but that's how I like it.
