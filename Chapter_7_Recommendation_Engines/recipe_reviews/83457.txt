Not the worst slaw I have made, but not the best...  Truly SOUNDED like an awesome combination, but overall too WET for our family and rather bland (even though Marzetti's is a fabulous dressing, I think the slaw and fruit watered it down).  Then I added the chow mein noodles and it was just this wet, difficult-to-get-on-a-fork kind of salad.  Maybe one could drain and dry the fruit first?  Make that portion the day before and drain off all liquid befoe adding the Marzetti's?  Not sure...

This slaw is very yummy!  Great side to bring to a summer bbq.  I've been asked many, many times for the recipe and I plan on making this many more times. KUDOS!
