Having made my own Krupnikas for the last 30 years, there are a few things I'd like to say. First and foremost NEVER heat this drink in a microwave! You're using grain alcohol, for cryin' out loud! There are many Krupnikas recipes out there. This seems like a good one...similar to mine with the exception of a few spices that I leave out and a few others I put in. (For example, I use vanilla bean vs vanilla extract and I put it in the pot with the other spices.) Also, I never drink it warm...cool is best...but my Krupnikas is a full 80 proof. It's the real deal, made for shots. The basics are there, though...so if you're making this for the first time, don't sweat it if you're missing an ingredient or 2. Most can be found on line at good spice websites like Penzeys. To a previous comment: Everclear IS grain alcohol...whatever brand you have works fine.

I just got the krupnikas in bottles and it really smells delicious.  I couldn't find whole yellow ginger (turmeric) so I used 1.5 tsp of powdered. Grain alcohol is illegal where I live so I used 1.5 quarts of vodka. This yielded almost 2 quarts of krupnikas with the water and honey.  Even after settling overnight it has a luscious taste, but it is quite cloudy.  I plan to let it sit 3 weeks and have a little on Christmas and then keep the rest for at least a year to mellow.

couldn't get our hands on fresh turmeric root, so used 1,5 tsp dried instead as per a previous review.  this made it a little bit difficult to strain, but patience paid off, and we've finally sampled it after having it stand for about 2 months.  fantastic.  we've had some at room temperature and we're totally blown away.  interested to know what it's like when heated, but not expecting a bad result. :)

I have made this the last two Christmases as gifts.   Problem is, we have trouble making enough to have any left by the time the holidays roll around.  I actually have started to save a few "vintage" bottles and my '08 bottles are great.  Truly gets better with age.  Everyone who I've ever served it to liked it, two things everyone disagrees about: 1) if it's better to drink hot or cold (definitely hot for medicinal purposes!) and 2) whether to shake up the sediment or to leave it the beautiful golden color.  Everyone seems divided about both!  There are a couple of ingredients I have never been able to find - but others have suggested substitutions that seem to work well.

Takes awhile to make, but well worth the wait!  After the 2 week wait you will not be disappointed!  I now make it every winter.

I haven't made this yet, but just wanted to know if you can make it without boiling the honey, just adding it directly to the mixture as it is my understanding that heating honey ruins any of the medicinal qualities that honey has.  Has anyone tried making it without boiling the honey or think it would work out okay to just add it without heating? PS, I'm just rating this as how desirable it sounds so I can post my question. Thanks for any input.

Every year my wife and I make holiday gift to give to family and friends. This year we chose to make Krupnikas. Boy, oh boy! Absolutely wonderful! Everyone's asked me for the recipe. My sister-in-law finished her bottle off in less then a week! Have a second batch aging as we speak.

I screwed up a bit and used too much honey relative to the alcohol and spiced water, too sweet but still pretty good.

It was a beautiful spring day and I decided to make this wonderful krupnikas recipe.  I opened the kitchen windows wide.  After straining the 'spice water' and while waiting for the honey to boil, I turned my back to the pot to do some general cleaning and tidying.  When I turned to face the pot again lo & behold, several large bees were buzzing around the top of the pot.  I turned towards the window and saw tens of bees exiting the garden bushes and flying towards my kitchen!  I quickly shut the window and took care of the others with organic orange room deodorant spray.  My message to you is this:  Don't make this recipe on a spring day with the windows open!

Other than that I must say that this is a marvelous recipe.   Everyone who tasted it enjoyed it immensely.  I have one one question, though.  No matter how long I've aged it I get a clear liquid on top and thick goopy one at the bottom of the bottle.  Even after straining again through coffee filters (the very definition of eternity) to re-bottle in gift bottles months later I get a two-toned result.  How to I get  the mythic clear liquid everyone talks about?

Krupnikas is heaven in a glass!  It appeals to everyone I've ever given it to, makes great coffee sweetener (if you're staying home :D), and is just generally awesome.  Thanks for sharing your family version!

I've been making this for the past 6 years, and try to always keep some on hand, no matter what time of year, it's that good!  While it is ok after 2 weeks, it is MUCH better after 2 months, and after 2 years, it is sublime.   I order turmeric root from Amazon.  I just make a tincture with whatever is leftover after making krupnikas, or use some for cooking.  I do not heat this, it is delicious room temp.  If I were to warm it, I'd heat it as you do cognac, over a glass of boiling water, not in the microwave.   Have never had anyone taste it who hasn't loved it.  I use raw honey, and since the ingredients are so amazingly healthy, I've stopped heating the honey, I just warm the spiced liquid before mixing.   Yes, it will always have a cloudy/muddy layer at the bottom of the jar when you go to bottle it (I let it mellow in one big jar then put it in smaller bottles as needed) but I've started saving that and when it gets low, I make a new batch and add it to the existing one, to use it as a starter.   It seems to give it an "aged" taste earlier than before!  A little work but well worth it!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated - and it is amazing! It was pretty potent when it first went into the bottles, but after just 3 months, it mellowed into an incredible, smooth, sweet and spicy sipping drink. Every time I give someone a sample, they ask for more!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I was so excited to see something that I have only had as a child and no longer had a recipe for.  I remember my mom saying it definately would cure anything.

This is amazing!  I made for Christmas a couple of years ago and it was a smash hit.  All our friends ask when I am making a new batch, so it has become a holiday tradition.

It's tasty right out of the pot, but amazing after aging.  The longer it sits, the smoother it gets.

I'd never even heard of Krupnikas before I stumbled onto this recipe.  However I love honey and spices, plus I have a friend who's last name is Krupnik, I thought the coincidence was enough to try my hand at making a batch.  At the time my local grocery store didn't carry many of the spices so I had to order them from myspicesage.com.  After I made my first batch I had to make another batch within two weeks.  Everyone I gave some to loved it!  It was soon nicknamed Christmas because it really does taste like christmas bottled.  You have to give this a try.

My fiancé is polish and remembered this drink being served during the holidays.  I had no idea what it was and found this recipe.  It turned out great!  I did use whole vanilla bean instead of extract.  I also let the spices steep in the drink over night before straining to add more flavor.  The flavor definitely matures as it ages so make a lot to have around all year long!  I’m planning to make a batch this year using Texas mesquite honey.

I tried this recipe never having Krupnikas before. It's kinda like the honey Jagermeister but much better in my opinion. I like it straight but I found that mixing it with some club soda makes a nice drink too. Love it and making another batch so that I dont run out!

I just made this. I used regular Vodka (one that I like) instead of the grain ETOH and the 100% proof was only Sea*****s and that brand does not agree with me. I thought if I was going to invest into all of the spices it requires I should use good ETOH.  I wasn't sure if I would use the finished product with grain ETOH.    So, 2nd day I tasted the result and I am wildly pleased.  It tastes like the brand that I had purchased several years ago, but I cannot find that brand or any other in my area.  When I travel I always looked for any brand of the product, but I could not find any.  I taste tested the two liquors side by side and mine is just as good. I always used this for medicinal purposes only.  Cough/cold...I do not know now.  And, despite using 40 proof vodka, this liquor still has quite a punch to it.

My Lithuanian Grandmother used to make something very similar to this but called it Viritas (spelling).  She would give it to us kids in little shot glasses to drink but she added Vodka. :0)  Great holiday drink.  Thank you.
