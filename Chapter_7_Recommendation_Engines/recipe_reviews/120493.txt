Excellent with a few changes.I tried two versions. 1st exactly as above & 2nd w/balsamic vinegar instead of red,1/2 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp ground italian seasoning(I'm italian and have to add this to almost everything), and was just under the 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper each.    The 1st batch was good, but too vinegary. The 2nd(altered) was perfect. Even though balsamic generally has a stronger taste than red wine vinegar, I was surprised that it tasted much better- the red vinegar was too overwhelming in the 1st batch. I also used a more expensive brand of balsamic which prob'ly made a difference too.   My whole family loved this recipe with the changes I noted(including my 5 yr old twin girls). I've also made it for parties since, and have had to give the recipe out wherever I take it cuz it's a hit every time! -hope this helps!

Very good! We don't have an outdoor grill, so I just roasted them on a sheet pan covered with foil. I cooked for about 30 mins at 400 while I made the turkey sliders from this site. Wonderful lunch! Thanks for sharing!

Made this as an emergency side dish when my parents came to town using whatever veggies were in the fridge. Grilled them for 10 min or so and they were wonderful. Every one loved it. I added a tiny amount of crushed red pepper to give it a little kick.

I used the dressing in the recipe with a mixture of broccoli, mushrooms, and a red bell pepper. I put the veggies in a ziploc, added the dressing, and let them marinate for about 8 hours until grilling time.  They turned out awesome and our guests asked for the recipe.

Really enjoyed this, left out the celery and added a little frozen whole kernel corn.  I also used 6 slices of cooked and chopped applewood smoked Bacon.  Roasted in the oven @ 400 for 30 mins.  Believe it or not I served it on the side with fresh pickeral fried in butter.  A very tasty and easy side dish for any meat though.

I had to place the sealed vegetable packet in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes since it is too hot to stand outside and grill.  I omitted the celery and used some green beans I had lanquishing in the refrigerator that really needed to be used.  This was really, really good and we enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very pretty and flavorful.  I think next time I will cut down or omit the red wine vinegar. It was too strong for my taste. Looks great on the table.

Perfect camping recipe! Added yellow zucchini and everyone loved it. I thought the dressing was great. A little more dressing would be good, but I wouldn't quite double it. The subtle flavor was nice. Cooked on an open fire, on a grill, for about 10-15 minutes.

This recipe is a keeper.  We have our own butcher shop and this compliments any meat we might grill - pork chops, steak, hamburgers, etc.  I'll look forward to reaping vegetables from our garden next summer to enjoy this recipe next summer!

I too reduced the red wine vinegar by half and added a little red wine to make up the difference. I omitted the green pepper (didn't have any) and used a few slices from a large white sweet onion. This turned out amazing! Thanks for posting.

Very excellent and simple recipe for grilling seasonal veggies. I have tried this several times using the same vegetables listed and also adding different vegetables - depending what I have on hand at the time; and it always turns out great. Even my kids like it, and it is difficult to get them to eat vegetables other than corn and potatoes!

I liked this so much, I made a huge bottle of it to leave next to the stove.  I have a wonderful griddle and can cook veggies for lunch on it and this recipe is fantastic.  Thanks so much for sharingit.

Although the dressing tasted good, it was so overpowering that ALL my veggies just tasted like the dressing! It's a bit unsettling when you bite into a green pepper and it doesn't taste anything like a green pepper. The dressing should compliment the food, not drown out the original flavor completely!

perfect. I don't cook with red wine vinegar, but had some and tried it. I used a little too much lemon juice (3X), so I got more of a steam than grill, but with some crisp edges. Will follow recipe better next time.   Original dish. Will make often. Thanks!

I thought this was fantastic.  I made with baby bella's and they really took on the flavor of the merinade.  My wife wished I had added potatoes, which I'll try next time - I'm thinking a little time in the microwave for those so I don't overcook everything else.

Another "keeper" for the recipe box.  We like veggies crisp so we grilled for 10 minutes.  The sauce is fabulous!  I'll be making this again - and trying different vegetables too!

sooooooo good.. the whole salt and pepper to taste thing is how i feel about lemon and garlic.. so i always up them (usually double) when im looking at a recipe.. came out so good bf was ready to eat the veggies w/ the marinade on them w/o grilling them.. i had leftover marinade since i didnt use as much veggies as it called for so i ended up slicing up some cucumber and tossed them around in it.. awesome as a dressing.. ty so much for the recipe.. =)
