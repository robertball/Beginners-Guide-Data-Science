I prebaked my potatoes before heading out for the great outdoors (left the potatoes whole until ready to assemble).  Used butter vs margarine, added fresh minced garlic plus more cheddar and less mozzarella to the mix.  Though I imagine any mix of cheese would be just as good.  Placing them on your campfire grill imparts that wonderful smokey flavor that just can't be duplicated anywhere but under the stars camping.....  Wonderful!

Perfect! Used 6 good size yukon gold potatoes and made 2 pouches.  I used a gas grill low setting for 35 minutes turning the pouches every 5 minutes. My kids don't like onion so I substituted onion powder, but sliced onion would definatly be tasty here. Increased butter to 4 T. I skipped the mozzarella but increased the cheddar to 1 1/4 cups. The potatoes were moist, but crisp around the edges with molten cheese. Wow!

We make these often when camping. Followed this recipe pretty much except had no Mozzarella cheese. Different potatoes take different times. We had Idaho and they take a good hour to cook well enough. Red potatoes will cook in the time recipe specifies. We have added bacon we had leftover from breakfast before and that is really good.

Made this for a campout I just returned from.  They went over sooo well!  I made it at home and stuck it in the cooler.  I also used a foil pan I purchased at the dollar store so I didn't have any cleanup.

I made in the oven instead of a campfire and thought these were great! My family didn't think they were all that good though... that they much preferred the ones with sour cream in them, that I sometimes make. served with Salisbury Steak , corn and green beans.

This didn't taste bad, but it was just like eating breakfast potatoes. I did cut the recipe back to 2 servings and I used a handheld julianne cutter I recently bought and wanted to try out. My other main issue, is that I had major trouble with sticking. The one closest to the heat source, burned half the potato to the foil. I used a little olive oil instead of PAM spray, maybe that is really needed here? To the credit of the submitter, I have never made a foil packet recipe. I also used a small propane grill. I would attempt this again, if camping for instance. What I could salvage cooked through and tasted fine. However, I would be saving it for breakfast. These would be a good idea with those pre-cubed type potatoes.

i tweaked these to personal preference. I subsituted onion powder for the onions, left out the butter and only used a colby jack cheese blend. these were amazing! i sliced them really thin and they didn't take 20 minutes to cook on my gas grill. i will be using variations of this recipe all through the summer!

YUMMY!  We don't go camping without this recipe!  Only changes made were to add crumbled bacon and use a garlic/black pepper blend.

Well i made mine on the grill as directed. The potatoes did not cook all the way. But enough that we could tell how amazing they would be. And the cheese was AMAZING. So for potential and since I will be making again I gave the four stars.

Delicious!  First attempt, on the learning curve with a new grill, I burnt the bottom 1/8 " BLACK.  And they were good!!  My son wound up not coming for dinner that night and I ate my pack AND his!  And barely touched my strip steak.   Second attempt even better!
