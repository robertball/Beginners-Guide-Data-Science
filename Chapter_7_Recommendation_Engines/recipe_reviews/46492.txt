THIS WAS WONDERFUL! I SERVED IT TO GUESTS, THAT RAVED ABOUT IT.
IT DID NOT SAY WHAT TO DO WITH THE BEET JUICE!  SO, I ADDED A BIT TO THE DRESSING MIXTURE.

This salad is FANTASTIC!  I didn't have boullion mix, so omitted it.  I didn't have the walnuts either, so I just added some toasted pine nuts and sunflower seeds, and for sweetness added a bit of chopped mango.  I'll try it with the walnuts next time, but the substitutions were great.  Thanks!

Simply Fantastico! So healthy, so tasty. Didn't have baby spinach, so blanched regular spinach for 2-3 minutes instead. Also, replaced goatcheese with feta. Was quick, light and healthy. Thoroughly recommend it to all. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This salad was a bit hit at our Family Reunion.  I have also made it with arugula, spinach, romaine, and red leaf lettuce.  My family just loves it. THIS SALAD IS A WINNER!

Wow!  This recipe juxtaposes the strong flavors of beets, vinegar, and goat cheese with the creamy texture of the goat cheese and the crunch of walnuts and adds the sparkle of the caramelized sugar. It was a treat.  I sprayed that walnuts with a cooking spray to help the sugar stick to them.  I added a little beet juice to thin the dressing.

This was very good and a nice change of pace from some of the regulars we always have.  Not to mention very easy to throw together.  Who knew the combination of ingredients (chicken bouillon?!? with pickled beets?) in the dressing could result in such a tasty vinaigrette.  I made a few changes to the salad part because all I had was feta and blue cheese....hubby had the feta and I had the blue cheese....we liked both!  I also didn't caramelize my walnuts---didn't want the added sugar.  Again, thought the raw walnuts where just as good.  However, I'm sure the original recipe would even be better with farmers cheese and caramelized walnuts!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! It was so delicious, even my husband had seconds...and thirds! I especially love the vinaigrette. I used some of the sliced beets on the salad as well. Thanks! I'll be making this again and again!

I had a craving goat cheese and this easy salad did the trick.  Served it with a simple steak for dinner. Easy to halve.  Didn't change a thing.  DELICIOUS!!!

This tasted like a salad you might be lucky enough to get in a five satar restaurant. It was a wonderful start to my Christmas dinner! I took others's advice and used non-stick sray to coat the walnuts and the sugar stuck to them nicely. I was diligent about stirring them in the pot, but I made one big mistake. After the walnuts were to my liking, I removed them from the heat and put them aside for a few minutes to make sure my spinach was totally dry. Within only those few minutes, the bottom layer of walnuts had become stuck and burnt to the pot. I had plenty to complete the salad, but cleanup was horrible. Keep in mind that I had even used the non-stick spray. The walnuts need to be removed from the pot ASAP. I'm afraid with all the Christmas commotion, I also forgot to add the goat cheese. It was still so very delicious. I can't wait to try it with the goat cheese on the leftovers tonight. This salad was fabulous and the odd pinkish color of the dressing made it one of the highlights of my Christmas dinner. Thank you so very much for posting this recipe! It is a keeper for sure.

changed it by mixing spinach and arugula for the greens and feta for the cheese.  Though it was hot pink in the end, the salad was wonderful and I got TONS of compliments.

I don't like beets and this dressing was great. It came out too thick but I think I could just add more beet juice/olive oil to thin it out. I sprayed the walnuts with butter spray and the sugar stuck to them better. It needed something else and I've decided golden raisins would be perfect.

My guests LOVED this and so did I.  I would make this again just to take to work. I would suggest making the dressing in a food processor (if you have one). I made it in my blender and it was fine but hard to get out of the bottom of the blender.

Served this recipe to my family for Thanksgiving in 2009, and they left with the recipe in hand!  Everyone loved the texture and taste, and thought I was a gourmet chef after serving it!  I'm not sure about other cooks, but I like to use a little dressing first on a salad, then add more if necessary.  I saved the extra dressing for later on any salad! This is a keeper for guests and special occasions, and as I write this review, I am sending it on to someone who asked for the recipe!

Sorry but I didn't like this salad, I do like beets, but the taste of the dressing wasn't for me. Sorry again, but I don't think I will make this again.

I love this salad.  It is a wonderful blend of flavors.  I did use a bit of the beet juice in the dressing to thin it out.  The second time I made it, I added some Granny Smith Apples just for an extra flavor and crunch.  It was great with and without the apples.

This makes way too much dressing.  My spinach was soaked and I had 2/3 cup left in my blender.  My husband didn't like this at all.  He at the rest of the beets from the 15 oz. can instead.  I tolerated it by picking out the sugared nuts but won't make again.  I used pecans but could that really make a big difference in the taste?

This salad got rave reviews from my guests at our post dance recital party yesterday. It was so elegant and yet incredibly fast and easy to put together. The sweet crunchy walnuts, the tang of the goat cheese and this very different dressing certainly complemented one another to make for a most delicious salad. Thanks so very much Nikki!

This was one of the best salads I've ever made. The vinaigrette was amazing and the walnuts add the most delicious crunch and sweetness. I didn't have goat cheese so I used feta. Plus the color of the vinaigrette just looks beautiful on the green spinach.

All the ingredients in this recipe compliments each other very well.  We were very impressed with it.  Didn't change a thing except using a pre-sugared walnut - I already have this on hand,  and i also have a can of beets so i just added some with the spinach.  Other than that no change made.  It is perfect the way it is.  Yum!

Delicious! It's the combination that's great so don't skip out on any of the components! That said, I used what I had on hand, which was pickled beets, arugula, walnuts, and blue cheese. I didn't think chicken flavor would go with the pickled beets so I omitted that. I'll definitely make this again!

Really Delicious.  Makes a truly "gourmet" salad that you would think you could only get in a restaurant.  Don't forget to use the beet juice and don't use too much actual beet or it will become to thick.

I was convinced that I'd like this even though I don't like beets... boy was I wrong! Although I followed the directions exact, it came out way too salty. I added a bit more sugar and that fixed that problem... it was just the overall taste that doesn't sit right with me. All in all, if you don't like beets, look elsewhere!

Wow I dont like beets but this salad is great! My goat cheese was expired so I added gorgonzola and some dried cranberries to it. Very tasty!

Made this last night for hubby.  I didn't want to go to the store for the goat cheese.  I added chopped apple, dried berries and sliced a few pickled beets.  WE LOVED IT!!  I will definitely make it again (and again, and again)!

This is a wonderful recipe.  It was supposed to be my lunch, instead, I am here eating it for BREAKFAST. (smile) Has a very nice zingy flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a wonderful salad.  I'd never eaten beets until I made a similar beet dressing in a cooking class.  It's surprisingly good.  This is a perfect recipe for a dinner party - simple to prepare but it tastes like something you'd be served at a nice restaurant.  I'd double the goat cheese - it's so good!
