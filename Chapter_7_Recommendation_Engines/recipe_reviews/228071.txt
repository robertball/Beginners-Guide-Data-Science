Picture does this chicken no justice.... this is soooo good!!! My hubby and I LOVED it!!  I soaked it in the water mixture for 2 hours + left in the fridge for 2 hours.... AMAZING.  I will definitely be making this multiple times!  So juicy and good... plus making it on top two beer cans on the grill is just toooo fun!!  :)

I tried this with the addition of hickory chips to give it an extra savory flavor. Excellent look and flavor. The skin was crispy and the meat moist.

The recipe calls for 1/2 can of beer. That is what I would use for the marinade instead of the 2 tbsp in step 2. It does not need to be a paste. Then, leave the chicken marinating in your refrigerator for a few hours -the more the better- or overnight, breast side down. And now I skip the lemon wash. Yesterday, I grilled a 4 lb. chicken at 400-425F for nearly 2 hours and it came out delicious and tender, and with a crispy skin. Update: I recently got a cheap rotisserie kit for my grill. Chicken comes out even better.

Outstanding!  I made this exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing.  THIS is the way beer can chicken should ALWAYS be made! From this point on, it will be in my house!  Ridiculous!

Update...   I made this again today.   I had an 8 1/2 lb roaster which wasn't a good choice for putting on the grill/beer can.   I, instead did everything the recipe called for BUT I put it into a cooking bag and roasted it in the oven.    I got the EXACT same results!   I thought that the skin would not be crispy, but it was!    Sooooo, if you don't have a grill, DEFINITELY try roasting it in the oven!    Perfection!

I made this last night for my husband.  We both LOVED it.  The only change I made was that I cooked in the oven.  I started it at 475 degrees for 15 minutes and then finished it at 375 degrees.  When done, I deglazed the pan with the beer and added beef bouillon and flour slurry to make a gravy to use with the leftovers. So beautiful and tasty!  Thank you for this recipe.

This is our family favorite. Rich flavor, and great spice. This is better than most chicken places chicken. I do typically brine for 2+ hours, and then rub and marinate for 2+ hours. So much better that way. We have made it about 10 times now, and this last time we used Coke and it was better, way better. Try it.

Excellent! I love Peruvian style chicken and this hit the mark. The ingredients as listed were perfect as was the lime water wash. I didnâ€™t cook a beer can chicken, rather I direct grilled a cut up chicken on the grill after marinating the chicken as described in the recipe. DO NOT skip the lime water wash step because I think that it moistens and tenderizes the chicken. For the person that said that the marinade didn't penetrate the meat very much - pierce the meat thoroughly with one of those needle style meat tenderizers such as a 24 pin meat tenderizer tool, I have the Deni brand. I grilled it over mesquite coal of which added another dimension of flavor. Thanks ricfera for sharing this recipe!

We loved this recipe.  It was extremely flavorful - great mix of spices.  The next time I make it, I will leave it in the brine longer than 15 minutes to make it even juicier.  Thanks!

Flavor doesn't get into the meat enough.  The skin, however, is to die for.  Maybe I'll just go psycho on it next time and put a lot more holes into the chicken.  Very tender meat.

The chicken was, indeed,moist, but the flavor was bland. I followed the recipe without changing any ingredients, even marinating the bird twice as long as recommended. This one just didn't deliver the flavor I expected.

Didn't have onion salt and added garlic powder but followed everything else as instructed.  Wishing my sister was here as she is the chicken skin eater and would love this. Meat very moist and nicely seasoned.  Will definitely make again. I set pan under chicken and cooked zucchini marinaded in Italian dressing as well.

Delicious! If I were to change anything, it would be to let the chicken sit an hour or more in the water bath. Ten minutes seems to be a little to short

Having lived in Peru for many years, one of my favorite dishes was Pollo a la Brasa...finally I can make it here! I followed the recipe, but did not  have beer for the paste and I think you can do with out. Since we just got our BBQ with the rotisserie attachment I used it and after 2 hours at about 350 F, it was perfectly done!
A tip for those who donÂ´t want to  keep smelling the spices after you rubbed it all over the chicken- use disposable gloves! I use them often in the kitchen, specially when handling chicken. I made white steamed rice with garlic  peruvian style and it was gone. My boys loved it, even the picky one. The chicken was very moist and tasty. Next time I may use a little less salt in the paste, since I brined it overnight. I willll make this again for sure, probably 3 chickens at a tiime!

The flavor of the chicken was delicious and it was so moist and tender. The only changes I made was to add the following to the spice mixture:
1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 Teaspoon dried tarragon, Â½ Teaspoon Hot paprika,  1 Teaspoon Smoked paprika, Â½ Teaspoon ground nutmeg. Mixed all dried spices in a small bowl used a mortar and pestle to break down the tarragon and rosemary. Definitely a keeper.

I have made beer can chicken before using my Infared no oil deep fry cooker.  But this has to be one of the BEST ever recipes, crunchy on the outside, and so very moist on the inside. The only hassle is stuffing that beer can up the bird.  Not very easy -- LOL.  I did not have lime juice but I used Margarita Mix and it worked just fine ;=)

Very good I need to perfect the cook time.

I did make it in an electric smoker with some apple chips. 

Tender and tasty. 

Will make it again.

Cooking to 175 degrees and then let sit raises the internal temp to 180.  It was dry!  That was the first try.  Second time I cooked to 160 degrees and let sit to 165.  Perfect.  Now it deserves 5 stars.  When cooking on a grill or smoker don't bother with 'how long to cook.  Just watch the remote temp gage from your recliner enjoying the ball games.

Made this with a 9lb chicken and scaled the ingredients 3x.  I ended up brining for 2 hours and put it in the oven right after rubbing the spice paste due to time constraints.  I also stuffed some of the limes in to the cavity and put them in the pan after juicing them for the soak.  Cooked for about 3 hours at 300 degrees.  If you ever plan on making beercan chicken more then once, invest in a stand designed for this... it's so much easier instead of balancing everything.

It was a huge hit!  Very flavorful and juicy.  I wanted crispy skin so I didn't baste at all.  We used the drippings (there were a lot) to make a fantastic gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and roasted garlic broccoli.

The rub was very good but the cook time should be much longer (or at higher heat). It was very juicy but borderline too raw.

I followed the recipe exactly on a 5.5 pound chicken. Was only serving 2 but couldn't find anything smaller. Used the same portion of ingredients as listed and it turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I cannot recommend it enough. It was gone by day 3 and we aren't always good about finishing leftovers. Thank you for this recipe! I'm looking forward to making this for others too.

At first this tasted pretty good, but after half a breast the flavor got old and nobody ended up finishing their plate. The lime did not go well with the other flavors, and I think too much cumin.

This is spectacular!  I've cooked this low and slow on my kettle grill a number of times. I don't always follow the recipe exactly as far as the herbs go. I just put in what I have on hand (dried parsley, italian seasonings, sage), but I always add the paprika, onion, garlic, soy sauce, cumin, vinegar, salt and pepper  and oil. I think it's the paprika that  adds so much flavor. I go extra heavy on that. I have also subbed diet cola and sparkling lime water for the beer, and the chicken still comes out fantastic. My family raves about this chicken, to the point they anticipate it every Sunday.  It also serves well as left overs.

I loved the flavors in this dish, but I had to adapt it a bit as neither SO or I like so much salt. I dropped the brining steps alltogether, as well as the salt in the rub. There was still plenty of salt for our tastes.

Ended up leaving the bird in the fridge overnight. Not sure how much of a difference it made, but the results were mouth-watering. Juicy juicy! So good.

This was better than I even expected!  Rivals my favorite Peruvian chicken place.  Boyfriend thinks it is better and said it was one of the best dinners I ever made him.  Only changes were to add some spice to beer can and plug up the neck with foil.  I also did the lime wash overnight and marinaded in spice rub about 8 hours.  Cooking time was spot on and skin was delicious.

I made this for company tonight and it was a huge hit!   So moist and delicious. I did it in the oven for two and a half hours on 250 for a 5# chicken.

Made this last night and it came out fantastic! I did follow another person's advise and let the chicken brine for two hours and then when I did the marinade I went ahead and did it overnight. Followed the cooking directions exactly using my cast iron chicken cooker (from Emeril Lagasse's collection). Will certainly be making this again. My fiancee does not care for chicken but loved this preperation!

Husband thought it was excellent. I was expecting it to be more moist. Maybe the can opening was covered by skin or something, but the beer did not evaporate like I expected. Seasonings were great, though. Will try again, and punch more holes in top of can next time.

Made this without rosemary as we hate rosemary and this was DELICIOUS. Brined the chicken for about 2 hours but forgot to poke holes - poked holes and let it sit for another half hour. BTW, an olive-pic that you use for martinis works really well as a hole poker!  Followed the instructions for the Drunk Chicken recipe on this site in terms of skewering to keep the can in - GENIUS!  Didn't have time to let it sit in the rub very long and hope to have more time next time. We have a gas grill, and needed to light the left two burners (one was a searing burner and one was a regular burner), and then put the chicken to the right as much as we could. It was the only way we could get to 350 in our grill.  I heard it was better than Super Pollo (the best in the DC metro area)...hopefully with a longer bath in the rub, I will agree next time, but it was really, really good.  With this small of a chicken, I was able to bring this in a resealable bag, with as much air squished out as possible.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used my electric smoker in stead of the grill, and WOW! So good!!! The skin has all the flavor and is delicious, and since I used the smoker the meat was tender and smokey. My husband is very picky when it comes to chicken but he loved this one. Will definitely be making this time and time again!

This was absolutely fantastic! I was a little concerned that it would be dried out, because our BBQ ran out of propane around the 1 hour mark of cooking and I didn't notice until about 20 minutes later, so I had to finish it in the oven. The chicken was tender and moist in spite of this. I have made beer can chicken several times in the past, but I never use the same recipe twice. Will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

I tried this as a side dish during a smoked rib competion my brother and I competed at.  Within 15 minutes of being on the grill all the other competors where drawn to our grill & smoker by the smell.  We ended up taking 2nd place in the smoked rib competion but everyone loved the chicken and wanted the receipe. 
I marinated it overnight then left it in the cooler until we got to the cook off.  After 2 1/2 to 3 hours on low heat on the grill the 7 1/2 lb bird.
GREAT receipe!  Everyone will love it.

I made this tonight for my husband's Father's Day dinner. I had not tried a beer can chicken before but like the idea of the herb rub. It was outstanding and will pass this recipe on. It is definitely a keeper.  The meat was moist and flavorful but this crispy skin was heavenly   I did it as written and wouldn't change a thing.

I really liked this recipe. I did not use any beer in the rub as I thought it didnt need it. This recipe is very heavy on cumin flavor so if you dont like cumin, cut back and replace it with another spice. I added garlic powder and extra paprika. Also, I dont think its necessary to refrigerate the chicken for an hour. I did the rub and let the chicken sit for 20-30 mins before putting it on the grill and it had plenty of flavor.

The rub was very tasty. We smoked the chicken and it turned out wonderful. We used a sweet and spicy paprika and next time will add more to make it spicier. Very Good!
