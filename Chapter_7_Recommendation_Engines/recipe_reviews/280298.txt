I made these using crumbled hot Italian sausage, cheese and chopped spinach and they were super easy to make and tasted delicious!. I cooked 4 and froze the other 4. I made the filling and the pasta dough yesterday and made the pinwheels today! Great recipe Chef John!! Well Done!

Never made pasta before.  I subbed chicken and mushrooms in the stuffing.  It was just great.  Thanks for inspiring folks.

Made this for lunch today with some minor revisions. I used fresh baby spinach since that’s what I had on hand. I also browned the pasta wheels in my round wide Dutch oven, took them out, put the sauce and spices in, then put the pasta wheels back in so I would only have one pot to wash. This turned out much better than I thought it would since it’s my first time making pasta. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef John!

Interesting combination of pantry flavors. Had to make my own marinara sauce so had an extra step. Enjoyed trying a new technique. Used my pasta roller and it worked well - four 12x7 sheets. I would cover the dish while cooking to keep the pasta from drying out and maybe put even more sauce in the bottom.

I used mild Italian sausage meat instead of salmon. And GF panko crumbs because that’s what I had.

Great quarantine recipe Chef John! Made it using almost the same ingredients. The shelves are a little bare. I used only one egg for the filling, we raise Muscovy and their eggs are about 1 1/2 times larger than an extra large egg.  We are all out of parmigiana so I was left to use an alternate cheese. Other than that kept it the same. The family really enjoyed the recipe and made us feel like we were out to eat instead of being stuck at home! Can’t wait to try a different filling next time!

I love this recipe, though I’ve never made this exact filling. I’ve made it several times stuffing it with everything from Hungarian Sausage and peppers to traditional pizza toppings. Everytime it has turned out amazing. The pasta has such a good texture and taste. It’s a very versatile recipe. Have fun!

I used crab shrimp and spinach and instead of marinara I made a homemade Alfredo sauce. It turned out great and the whole family loved it.

I made it with ricotta and spinich stuffing as well as adding tiny meatballs.  It smelled just like lasagna when it was cooking.  It came out delicious.

These were fantastic! They looked pretty and such an easy dish to put together!  I sautéed mushrooms, baby spinach and baby arugula  (squeezed dried)  for the frozen spinach and used leftover grilled salmon for the canned. I added more garlic and a bit of nutmeg to the greens mix. Will do again!

My lack of skill and experience making pasta was my downfall. It was all just fine, except for the tough, rubbery pasta. Not sure if I did a bad job with the kneading (Bad technique), the mixing (too dry), or the baking (the wheels may have been too tightly bunched in the pan). This is our first Chef John recipe that failed to meet expectations, but he did say it was all about technique so I forgive him. After all, I am a disaster at making my pasta.
