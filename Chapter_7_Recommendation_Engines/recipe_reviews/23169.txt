I've been making this for years and I always put the bananas under the caramelized condensed milk. (they do not turn brown!!!!!)  It's great!   A great tip is to boil 4 cans at a time and save them in the cupboard for next time.  When unexpected guests arrive just put it together in less that 5 minutes!

A wonderfully sweet pie!!! I've made this many times and have found the easiest way to make the caramel is to peel the label off the cans of sweetened condensed milk - Do Not Open the can - drop the cans into a pot of boiling water (enough to cover the cans plus an inch or so) and boil for 3 hrs. Let the cans cool, open the can and you have the best caramel without the mess of the baking dish and water bath! SO EASY!

Paula Deen suggested that you use two cans of the sweetened condensed milk and to pour it into a baking dish thats submersed in water and bake then using half to layer bananas and caramel then topping with whipped topping... I have not tried it but it seems like it might turn into caramel a little easier.. Hope this helps.

I have been making this dessert for years and my family loves it! The absolute easiest way to turn the condensed milk into caramel is to submerse the unopened cans completely in water in the crock pot overnight on low with the lid of the crock pot on.  You never have to worry about making sure that the can is always covered. I make an oreo cookie crust, put my bananas between the caramel and whipped cream and whip up some whipping cream instead of the frozen whipped topping.  As long as the bananas are completely covered with the whipped cream, you can make this ahead of time. I often double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 dish.  My children request this for their birthdays instead of cake!

I put dark bakers chocolate right in the crust... made my own crust. I didn't shake or beat the caramalized topping out of the can for my first pie and it was a little runny. my second pie i beat it up and  put it on it set alot better. Maybe if you turn the can halfway through cooking you wont get a super caramalized part at one ened and custard texture at the other

Thank you all for your input for this recipe. I just wanted to let you all know that when I submitted this one, It said to mix in the banana's to the carmel after you slice them on. This will help to prevent the browning while it is in the fridge cooling. Sorry for the mix up. Also, you need to keep adding water to the pot as it is boiling to keep it covered.

I followed the directions (first time cooking sweetened condensed milk) and only half the can was carmel. I later googled cooking sweetened condensed milk and learned the can should be submerged in water, not only just 2 inches of water as this recipe states. Might want to check into that if this is your first time.  2 stars for poor directions, otherwise great pie

This pie is great! Other reviewers suggested cooking the milk longer, so I put water almost to the top of the can and put a lid on. probobly not a great idea. I think I overcooked it because it 
wouldn't "pour", it just fell out in a big glob and I spread it over the bananas. Next time I will
do it as the recipe suggests, but turn the can over half way through.  The flavor is GREAT!!!

Delicious!  Easy!  Wow!  I was intrigued by this idea and had to try it, but afraid of an explosion, so I used the crock pot method.  It really does turn into caramel and makes a GREAT pie.  I bake alot and love when you find those rare recipes that are so easy and so good.

I made this two nights ago and OH! MY! GOSH! It was super easy and sooooo yummy! The sweetest part of it is the bananas, which caught me off guard!  I took the advice of others and used an oreo pie tin/crust, and folded the bananas into the condensed milk (after 3 hrs boiling - half on one side and half on the other) and they didn't turn brown and the pie was a HIT!  I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks :)

This can be too sweet for some.  For that reason i use a sponge base rather than biscuit then layer with bananas then  toffee then another sponge then bananas then toffee then top with the cream and then chill.

This cake is way too sweet and rich.  I got sick off the first piece.  The ingredients sounded good, but not worth the effort.  I threw the rest of the pie away.

I just tried this pie today and it's still in the fridge.  I don't think mine is going to get firm even being cold.  But I think it is going to taste delicious.  I must have done something wrong.

My family and I loved this pie! Good idea about putting the bananas in first, though we didn't care that they turned brown--it tasted great anyway.

Bananas turn brown before you can add the whipped cream.  It was just not what we expected for taste or texture.  Dissapointed because it sounded wonderful!

I came back to this three times the other day.  I couldn't stand it anymore and had to make it.  I totally cheated and bought a container of caramel dip by the apples at the store, and grabbed the other ingredients and came home and threw it together.  I took it work the next morning and I had to hide the last two pieces to bring home to hubby and son.  Will be making this again...I think in a square pan next time and make my own graham cracker crust...I'll probably cheat again and use the store caramel, as that worked fine for me...maybe it is a little more runny than the condensed milk way...but we loved it!

So simple and so delicious! My 19 year old step son said I outdid myself and he asked that I make it for his birthday coming up. I took some other reviewers suggestions. I used regular pie crust, because graham cracker sounded like it was just one more flavor-addition too many. But to make this even more simple, I didn't make the crust, I just bought it frozen from the grocery store and followed the box instructions for baking it. I put the bananas in first. I cooked the sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours but fully immersed the can in water and kept it on a slow boil.  I put the caramel in a bowl and stirred it up to make it more "pliable" so it would pour over the bananas and seep into the bananas. I used 8 oz of real whip cream, put the bowl and beaters in the freezer for an hour first, beat the cream and added 2 Tbsp powdered sugar instead of white sugar and 1 tsp of real vanilla extract.  I toasted sliced almonds in a teflon pan on the stove top and covered the top in toasted almonds. The crunchy-ness and flavor of toasted almonds adds so much to bananas and caramel. DELICIOUS!!!! It looked perfect and kept its shape when sliced.

I prefer this pie on a regular pastry crust. You get all the flavor from the caramel and bananas.

I used store bought chocolate cookie pie crust and put the sweetened condensed milk in the crockpot on low overnight, as the other reviewers suggested.  No other changes, and it was really yummy. It never really "set" though, and it was a runny gooey mess- more like a pudding. It's worth trying again though, in hopes that it was a fluke :)

GREAT substitution for the 3 hours boiled sweetened cond. milk - go to the mexican section of your grocery store and they sell the sweetened condensed milk already caramelized (dulce de leche)! My friend made this pie with it...yummy and saves 3 hours of your time!!

The trick is to cover the can of condensed milk completely,and turn the can over at least once. Not sure why other reviewers had problems because I made this pie for the tenth time today and have never had any problems.Totally simple and oh so decadent.Definately Good Eats!

I made this with two cans of milk, boiled for 3.5 hours, which I left in the cupboard overnight.  Spooned it into a chocolate graham, topped with two bananas, then with Cool Whip.  Tried to write Happy Birthday with Hersheys topping and sprinkled with chocolate pieces.

I did not think I would be able to tolerate this pie.  I got the idea from a friend, then came to this site to check out recipes.  It was decadent and yummy and I not only tolerated it, I ate a full piece and wanted more.  It was good...  and I am still marveling at the magical caramel that comes out of the can.

Next time, I will use the slow cooker method I read about.  The boiling method was easy but the hard water from water dripping on the stove top left a bit of a mess.  

THANKS!
