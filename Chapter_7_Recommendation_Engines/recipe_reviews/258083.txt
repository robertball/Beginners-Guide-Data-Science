Iâ€™ve always been skeptical of cooking risotto in a pressure cooker. We make risotto-the traditional way- at least three times a week. Making it in a pressure cooker just scared me. After seeing this in the Jan 2018 magazine, I decided to give it a try. It really works. I added a half cup more broth than written and it was a bit watery, but I cooked it down a bit (about 45 seconds) before adding the cheese. The consistency was perfect. The rice was not mushy. This is a recipe to trust. I will use it again, definitely. Grazie, Miche!

This is an exceptional way to make risotto. The last time I made it regularly, I had to make it earlier than serving time and it was a mess by the time I reheated it. This, however, came together perfectly. It's got great flavor and it was so easy to pull together in my stovetop pressure cooker.

For those of you with an Instant Pot, I just put it on the rice setting and the risotto is  perfect!

Very easy and super delicious!  I was looking for a risotto recipe that uses a pressure cooker, just like my mom does.  Thanks for the tips! They really helped

I'm from a family of Northern Italians.  We've  made Risotto Milanese for generations.  So, I decided to give this recipe a try for a dinner with my Grandmother, Mother and Brother.  I used it as a side dish.  Everyone was  amazed and astonished with the ease and speed of the pressure cooker version.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Try this if you are a risotto fan.  It is very authentic and delicious.  Don't make this risotto or the regular stove top version in advance.  After sitting it becomes a starchy mess.

Very good. I made in the skillet, the traditional way. My mom just mailed me some good quality saffron from Morocco and I was eager to use it. The family asked for a risotto. So, I decided to try this recipe but had to make some changes because of dietary restrictions.. 
I omitted the wine but added extra broth. I used some  cubed leftover cooked chicken for the Pancetta. Also, I needed to add some salt because my broth was the low sodium kind.

While this calls for a slow cooker, I went the traditional route and used the "Cook's Notes" to adjust.  We made this exactly as called for and it was delicious. Next time around we will dice the onion.  We really enjoyed this and will definitely be making this again!
