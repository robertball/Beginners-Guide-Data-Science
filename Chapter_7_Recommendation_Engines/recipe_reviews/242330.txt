I made this with some slight variations. It came out really moist and very tasty. You can't even tell its gluten free. I added 4 bananas instead of 3. I also added some coconut oil to the mix. I did not have baking soda so doubled up on baking powder. Added walnuts on top. Baked at 350 for around 35 min. Made muffins instead of a loaf. With definitely make this again.

Dense and super moist, more like a heavy cake. Great taste. I'll make this again.

I changed the recipe slightly. I added cocoa instead of the cinnamon flavors. I also added extra banana due to them being small, but I think I would stick to 3 next time. I also didn't use any sugar (over-ripe bananas are sweet enough).This is a good recipe and I will definitely make it again. I was looking for something gluten-free and wanted to try coconut flour for the first time. Launching off of this recipe worked perfectly.

This recipe was nicely tasty. The texture was slightly spongy, making it seem more like a cake than a bread. Also, the coconut flour produces a sort of chewy coconut texture. The finished product was pleasantly flavored and sweet. Will I prepare this recipe again? Perhaps, if I have some bananas going brown. It is an acceptable gluten-free option.

Very good but I used 1/8 cup of honey instead of coconut flower and cooked it at 325 for 30 minutes and that was long enough.  Very moist!

Substituted brown sugar for coconut sugar without issue (and did not sprinkle any on top). added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. Quite yummy!

This came out very dense and somewhat spongy. I did not think it was all that sweet, but that may have been that my bananas were not as ripe as I would have liked.  However, my husband loved it and he is very picky so I will be making this again.   I baked it in a loaf pan for 40 min.  I omitted the seeds and replaced with chopped pecans.  I also added a bit of nutmeg.
