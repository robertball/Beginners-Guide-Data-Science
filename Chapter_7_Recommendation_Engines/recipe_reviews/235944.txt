This sauce came out creamier than the picture.  Perhaps pulsing would retain some of the texture.  It has a good taste with a little acidic tingle. Different, but not off-putting.  I think it works really well as a sandwich spread or vegetable dip.

This was the perfect sauce for a Mediterranean pizza! I loved it with roasted chicken, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives and feta cheese for toppings.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. There was WAY too much parmagan and the the consistency of the sauce was very thick.  I will not be making this again.

Excellent!  Thought I’d miss the pine nuts, but my husband says he prefers this recipe without them. Cruising on a sailboat, we need to cook with what we have; no running down to the store for ingredients.  Didn’t have pine nuts onboard, so made this. To save time/propane I skipped blanching the basil. Will definitely be making this again!

I added some cream cheese  and milk to make it creamier. It was still a bit dry but the family loved it, so I will make it again and make some  adjustments to the recipe.

I needed to add quite a bit more liquid for desired consistency.

I used a spin off of this recipe using a little lemon pepper and 1/8 cup of lemon juice. I also added chicken breast just coated in a little flour lemon pepper and lemon juice and grilled on a skillet. Chopped the chicken and added to the pasta. Really simple recipe with really great taste.

Everyone in my family loves this simple to make sauce. This was the first recipe I used when searching for a pesto sauce.
