These are super yummy!  They are good with avocado ranch dressing, but they would be good with a garlic aioli and they are delicious plain too~ It's a nice alternative to boring old fries... I doubled the recipe (since I probably had about 15+ jalepenos).  I stored the remaining ones that I didn't devour and popped them in the toaster oven the next day and they were just as good!

I didn't put any pepper in the flour mix and added milk to the eggs. They were gone so fast I couldn't get a picture of them lol. Loved these! Will definately be making them again!

A great appetizer with good flavor served warm or cold. We served these with avocado ranch.
