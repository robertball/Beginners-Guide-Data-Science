Reading the reviews of others who commented that this recipe called for an excessive amount of oil, I sympathized with the submitter, who probably had to specify a precise amount in order to submit her 
recipe.  While baking demands precise measurements, cooking does not. One's potato might 
be larger or smaller than others' and so the total amount of one reviewer's potatoes might be 
completely different from another's and require more 
or less oil.  I'd say use your judgment with this, and use enough to adequately coat the potatoes. I had great success with these--I used a combination of olive oil and butter and otherwise followed the recipe. It may be because I scaled this down to two servings that the potatoes needed about 1o minutes less cooking time, although I did cut them up small.  Hubby went on and on about these--perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and almost creamy (according to hubs)on the inside--his point being they weren't mealy. I used Yukon Golds, unpeeled and again, cut into small cubes, which may account for that.  The lemon is discreet, not enough to scream "LEMON" but just enough to make you notice something pleasant you couldn't quite put your finger on. Dill is something we always enjoy on potatoes and we did here as well. Great recipe, one we really enjoyed, and a definite "make again" seal of approval from hubs!

OMG, with some changes this was so excellent! It's only 2 of us so I scaled the ingredients for 2 and used one large baking potato. I scrubbed it and cubed it but left the skin on (so it gets crispy - yummy). I also subbed oregano for dill, and chicken stock and olive oil for butter and canola oil. I mixed everything in a liquid measuring cup, and then poured over the potatoes in the pan. Then I just squeezed fresh lemon juice over all. So fast, so easy, and so so good. Highly recommend.

Yum! These were a hit. I followed other suggestions to use less butter and oil but kept the other seasonings the same. I used some tiny red potatoes from the farmer's market, so I didn't even have to slice them up and they made for great presentation. Clean-up was easy since I mixed everything in a Ziploc bag and lined the baking pan with foil. You can't beat that!

Can you say YUM?  These are divine, and have THE best crispy bits.  I always pour the oil and butter on the cut up potatoes IN the baking pan.  Then I just toss with my hands, (cook's best tool), and no extra bowl to clean - Bonus!  UPDATE:  After the potatoes were cooked, I put them under the broiler for about 2-4 minutes.  The more golden and crispier the better!

I would definitely give this recipe about 4.5 stars because I did make a few minor adjustments. Like other chefs, I cut the oil/butter combo and substitued with about 1/4 c. olive oil.  I squeezed the juice of a whole lemon (I like my lemon potatoes lemony). I also used fresh dill instead of dry.

This recipe was fantastic! I followed it pretty loosely [added more lemon and dill], but these turned out like great 'restaurant style' potatoes. My only suggestion is up the lemon if you want a good lemon flavour [the original recipe isn't very strong], and when the tops are brown, move the potatoes around and cook them some more so the other sides can brown as well. Fantastic recipe!

They are good. But try them this way:
instead of canola oil, use fat free chicken stock.( I make it myself). Instead of butter, olive oil and oreganon, instead of dill. Much healthier and much more Greek.

Really good!  I do agree that there was a bit much oil/butter, but I thought it aided in the crisping process.  
I used garlic infused olive oil, the zest and juice of one fresh lemon, and red potatoes (not peeled, just washed and cubed).  They turned out nice and sour.  Hubby and I loved it! I gave it 4 stars, would have done 4.5, if possible.  The only reason to not give it a 5 was because of the excess oil.

This was very tasty and full of flavor! However, I found the oil amount a bit overwhelming and by the time the potatoes were done they were still swimming in the oil. That's saying a lot considering I almost never find a recipe that has too much fat for me. I will make this again, but with about half the amount of oil and butter. I used olive oil instead of canola because #1, it's healthier, and #2, it adds more flavor and it simply the best for roasted potatoes. Coconut oil would be great as well too. The lemon flavor wasn't extremely strong and didn't give you that punch-in-the-face burst but just lingered in the background, complementing the buttery, crisp and perfectly seasoned potatoes. For a more lemon flavor I'd add some lemon zest and maybe a touch more lemon juice. This is great recipe; the potatoes came out flavorful, tender, and slightly crisp. Talk about yum!

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I used about 3-4  tablespoons of fresh dill weed and I added a bit more lemon juice than was called for, as others have suggested, yet I still found that this dish lacked flavour.

This has become one of my go-to side dishes for meals. I do recommend adding more lemon (I like the lemon flavor, so I double the amount called for here). I also recommend letting the potatoes brown on one side, and then stirring them up to let the other sides brown evenly. It took mine a little more than 45 minutes to cook entirely through. I've tried it with both skins on the potatoes and with peeled potatoes, and personally prefer it with the skins on. It gives more of a crispy texture. But both ways were tasty!

I eat potatoes so often and make them every which way possible.  This was a first for me with this recipe and can I just say that these are absolutely fantastic!  I Loved these and told hubby I'd be making these very often so I hoped he loved them as much as me!  I used olive oil instead of canola and a clove or 2 extra garlic.  used white potatoes with the skin on and sliced them in small wedges.  it didn't matter how long they took, they are so worth the wait..can't wait to make these again!

These are so good- but call for way too much butter and oil.  I cut both the butter and oil in half and I could have cut back even more.  I added an extra TBS of lemon juice.  I also used red potatoes.  Great flavor, and went well with a Greek meal.

For those lemon and garlic lovers...double the amount of lemon juice and marinate the cut-up potatoes in it along with the minced garlic for 30 minutes before adding the other ingredients. Halve the amount of butter and oil to cut back on calories.

I used a small potato medley (gold, red, purple); granulated garlic because that's what I had...otherwise stuck to the recipe.  The flavor was incredible...I had to make myself stop eating them!  Excellent recipe!

This has become my favorite way to make potatoes and it's so easy to whip up a double batch when company is coming. The only change I make is to use garlic powder instead of fresh because I think the fresh has a tendency to scorch, but it is good both ways.

This were good but seemed little different to me than your basic roasted potatoes.  The lemon and dill flavors were so mild that they were almost indistinguishable.  Might increase those next time.  Even though the flavors did not "pop" for me, I do love roasted potatoes so I can envision making this again and tweaking the seasonings a bit.

I did this as per the recipe but used vegetable oil rather than canola because that's what I had, and the lemon and dill flavors were subtle but still there. Some reviewers increased the lemon, but I think I like the subtlety of this recipe as it is. Very nice, and approved by the husband!

Way too much fat here, but that is easily changed by cutting back. If you use chicken broth, it produces potatoes that aren't roasted, which is fine, but it really isn't the same recipe. Tasty, even though the lemon is a bit meager.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I gave it 4 stars because I needed to add a bit more lemon for flavor and because of the large amount of oil/fat.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on, I completely omitted the butter and used a little less oil as well.  I also used a whole lemon and a half and increased the other seasonings a bit as I was using a few more potatoes than the recipe calls for, but the family liked it.  A definite repeat for us.  Thanks Laura!

I'm still tossed on what I think about this recipe, hence the four stars.  First of all, I took the advice of others and left out the butter.  I used 1/3 cup olive oil and it was plenty for roasting.  I despise peeling potatoes so used red potatoes, skin on.  I squeezed a half a lemon for the juice, and then because others complained about the lack of lemon taste, I used the zest of the left over lemon peel.  Everything went into a zip lock bag and marinated for approximately a half hour.  I felt like the dill was way over powering, and I like dill!  I'm going to try this again, but this time I might add lemon pepper, and cut back on the dill.

The lemon and dill in these are an excellent combination. I have made these many times and they just seem to get better. I pretty much do as listed but add a dash of extra dill, garlic powder on top and italian herbs also before baking. These are even suitable to make in the morning as breakfast potatoes. Be sure to move them around about half way through cook time for even crispiness!

I could not taste a lemon flavor at all despite doubling up on the lemon juice (freshly squeezed organic) and the dill was black when done cooking (possibly owing to the natural type I buy from the Middle Eastern market which tends to be darker than usual). I love lemon potatoes, so I will try this recipe again using bottled lemon juice (which is stronger than fresh squeezed) and add the dill near the end of cooking for a better appearance. Also, I noticed that the larger pieces that I missed cubing (2") were more attractive and delicious than the smaller pieces (1"). Thank you Laura for sharing your recipe.

Meh...  OK...  Nothing special.  Fixed exactly as directed; could've roasted my spuds better than using this recipe.  I'd give it 4 stars; Mrs. Elk Guy and my son gave it 3.  I'm giving the benefit of the doubt...  I'd make additions - carrots, onions, and possibly a turnip - and leave some things out... mainly oil and fat.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that gave me the "WOW" factor.  I will make this again... with significant modifications.  Thanks for a decent base recipe to work from, though.  If there's one thing I've learned from spending many, many hours on this site, personal tastes, et cetera, are a definite factor.  I've seen 5-star recipes (in my opinion) rated with one star, and seen different recipes - that didn't work for me at all - that had many 5-star ratings.  I guess you never really know until you try!

This recipe has a lot of butter, so I did cut back on the oil.  I zested the lemon and added it to the recipe, and I'll even add more lemon juice the next time, but it still was pretty darn tasty.  I cut the potatoes into 1" to 1-1/2" cubes, and next time, I'll cube them a little larger.  Timing will depend on the size of your potatoes, and mine were cooked at 30 minutes.  I lined the baking pan with regular aluminum foil, and they did stick to the foil.  I forgot about the non-stick Reynolds Wrap I have, but will use that in the future.  Very nice, full-flavored side dish, enjoyed, and definitely will make again.

I have made this recipe frequently throughout the last few years. I love it. I don't make any changes (unless I need to based on something I don't have on hand. Adding Sage works nicely too!) Great side dish recipe thank you!

Not bad, but not really "lemony" enough for my tastes.  Might do well with some lemon pepper.

Became a family favorite quickly.  It goes with some of the recipes I have that don't need mashed potatoes  and gravy, yet perfect side dish!! For a main dish I added smoked sausage and served it as a casserole.

I made these last night and they were a hit! I took other reviewers advice and cut back on the amount of butter and oil that I used. I moved the potatoes around after about 30 minutes, so that they would all get a chance to get crisp, my house smelled so good. I can't wait to make these again.

good,easy,potato dish. I recommend making again. The only reason it isn't five stars is just because it isn't the star attraction of the meal. But it is a great side dish.

These potatoes were delicious and easy to prepare. I used twice as much lemon juice as called for in the recipe as we are lemon lovers in our house. Cooked for an hour, which was perfect for us, but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks!

my new favorite potatoe recipe  :) 

I used 1/4C. Olive Oil, skipped the butter, and it turns out you really don't need any.. and used 3 tbsp's lemon juice instead of the two.. I flipped and tossed my potatoes in the pan every 15/20min. so they browned evenly... they came out perfect!

Fantastic and easy!  Will totally be making again!  I ended up leaving these in the oven for about an hour and then I actually put them under the broiler for about 15 minutes stirring every 3-5 minutes.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! It is a big hit in our house. I've made them four times already in the last two weeks. It reminds me of the Greek potatoes I always ask for at my favorite Greek restaurant. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic! I omitted the butter due to a dairy allergy. I used yellow basin gold potaoes with the peels on. I like mine a little crispy on the outside so I cooked mine for ~60 minutes.

It's a little unfair of me to rate these as I didn't make them as written and rather used this recipe as a guide.  Anyway, here's what I did.  I was trying to mimic some roasted potatoes I would get at a Mediterranean fast food place.  I eyeballed the oils, using a spicy herbed olive oil I have.  I used kosher salt to get a bit of crunch on the potatoes, red pepper flakes instead of dill and tripled the garlic.  This sounds extreme but I was trying to get the heavy garlic flavor of thoom (a Middle Eastern garlic sauce) that is always spread over the potatoes at previously mentioned restaurant.  What I learned is that the garlic roasted and gave it not at all the same flavor (thoom is made with raw garlic).  A nice flavor, but not the one I was looking for.  I also sprinkled some parsley over everything and juiced half a lemon so there was significantly more lemon flavor than the subtle flavor some others mentioned.

Made these as mashed potatoes using the following modifications:    quartered, boiled and mashed potatoes. added ~2T of olive oil to water.    in a small fry pan, combined ~2T butter, fresh lemon juice, garlic dill weed, salt pepper until simmering.    Once potatoes were mashed, added the remaining ingredients in. also added milk to desired consistency.    Delicious!  served with sage pork chops (available on this site) and green beans.

These were okay.  A bit on the greasy side.  If I make them again I will use less oil and butter and use fresh dill and maybe serve it cold like another reviewer suggested.

Very, very good. I did have to adjust the amount of oil and butter and it was still too much, and I don't think I used enough lemon juice, but will definitely make again! I like dill and these were lightly toasted outside and light and fluffy inside. I also used tiny Yukon Gold, not peeled just washed and quartered, and they were perfect.

I just loved these potatoes.  I did make them a little differently.  I used olive oil spray rather than oil.  I cut the potatoes and added to the dish, sprayed with oil and then added the dill, lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic over the top of the potatoes rather than tossing the potatoes in a large bowl (why make more dishes!!!) sprayed again with oil during cooking.  I served these cold and they really were so delicious.  Will certainly be making these again.  Who would have thought lemon on potatoes could taste so good...

I always like potatoes and these certainly weren't bad.  However, they are supposed to be "Lemon" potatoes and by the time they had baked, I tasted no lemon flavor whatsoever.  Furthermore, the amount of butter/oil called for is WAY too much for this amount of potatoes.  I probably used less than half and my potatoes were still very moist and crunchy.

My family loved these potatoes with a hint of lemon and dill.  Depending on how many potatoes you use, I think you could use half the oil and butter and still get great tasting potatoes.  These potatoes would taste great in foil packets and also in the air fryer would also not heat up your oven in the summertime.

We are huge oven roasted potato fans and my family really enjoyed the flavor of these.  I had to be careful of the quantity of fat to the number of potatoes that I had on hand, but if you find the right balance, the potatoes are great.  One trick that I learned from my mother-in-law is to boil the cubed potatoes until they are soft and then drain and toss with oil, etc.  It helps them soak up the oil and gives them a fabulous texture when you bake them.

These were very good and crisped up fabulously. But I wanted more lemon flavor, so I'll increase that next time. Thanks Laura!

This recipe is fantastic! We could not stop eating them. I used small red potatoes with skin on and cut them into bite sized pieces. Since it was two of us, I cut back on the butter and oil but the ratio was the same. I used evoo, not canola oil. With the fresh garlic, dried dill and the juice of one lemon it was perfectly seasoned. I cooked it for nearly one hour to make sure the potatoes had a nice crust, stirring them several times. If you used fresh dill, that could account for the lack of flavor. Dried dill is my choice in any dish that calls for that pronounced taste. Fresh dill is very mild and you need a lot of it to get the same results. I cannot imagine subbing chicken broth for the oil and/or butter. Not the same dish at all. Please make this as written, you will not be disappointed. We served it with grilled strip steaks.

I've made these twice for dinner parties - they are so easy to prep but the flavor is incredible and guests rave about them.  I use a bag of tiny potatoes and extra lemon.  Wonderful recipe for stress free entertaining!

Next time I'll add more lemon as I could barely taste it, but overall it was good. I added carrots too and it was really good.

These potatoes were delicious!  Upon reading some of the comments I only put 1/4 cup olive oil and omitted the butter.

I almost always cook my potatoes this way.  I don't use butter or canola oil though.  I use Pam's Olive Oil Spray.  It's healthier.  I also brown my potatoes with a roast.

I love this,it's simple and tastey. I used olive oil new potatoes. I've done this with small reds,purple and some thin skinned light colored potatoes. I left skins on and cooked whole(very small potatoes). I sometimes skip the dill and add fresh garlic. PERFECT and SO EASY!

Love these potatoes!  They're tangy from the lemon juice but so creamy.  I made these in the oven and on the grill.  I think they lose some of the lemon flavor and are abit crispier as well; still good but much better in the oven!

This was soooo delicious. I had the most picky greek and his wife coming over for dinner and added this to my lamb and greek salad dinner and the combo was just amazing. Perfect blend of flavors, not one overshadowing the other. Nicely done, will make this much more often!

These were SO good!  I did use less oil as others suggested and margarine in place of butter.  I agree that they're not that lemon-y but that was OK by me because they still tasted delicious.  I did broil at the end to crisp them up a bit more, but they would have been good either way.

This was good.  However, I expected more lemon dill flavor, which didn't stand out for me.  I used olive oil in place of canola oil and added more dill weed.  Still needed more flavor for my taste, but still very edible.

What a great way to do potatoes!! I made this dish for Mother’s Day dinner and for sure didn’t make enough as people wanted more!!! They turned out great!! I used olive oil instead of canola and butter. I also used red potatoes and left the skins on! Shared the oven with pork loin so cooked roasted them at 350 instead…turned out wonderful!! Will for sure be adding this to the more often used stack :)

Absolutely loved this.  Very tasty.  The second time I made this I added frozen Italian Green Beans to make my dinner easier, fewer dishes.  Stirred part way through cooking to make sure the beans were seperated and thoroughly coated with the other ingredients.  Loved the beans in there too!  Will make this again, thank you Laura!

Love these potatoes!  I use olive oil and butter according to how many potatoes I am making and oregano instead of dill.  On any recipe, I adjust the seasoning to my family's preferences, which always means less salt for sure.

WOW! What a great taste. I made them yesterday as a side dish with a beef tenderloin. My wife was excited about the taste. I made them exactly following the recipe, and the didn't come out crispy at all. Probably as I had too much oil and butter as other reviewers suggested. Despite this, I give them a 5 star as with both liked the great taste. I definetly make them again, maybe with some changes. Thank you Laura for sharing this great recipe.

These had a good taste to them.  i would cook them a little longer under the broiler for a little more crunch though.

Love these!! I am a huge lemon fan, which is why I chose these, but I really couldn't taste the lemon at all. It didn't matter; these were crispy and flavorful. Delicious -- thanks!!

I make these using baby dutch yellow potatoes halved.  These are so small and very tender with a wonderful buttery flavor.  I toss them with lemon pepper, olive oil, add onion wedges with the garlic and bake @ 425 stirring a few times while they roast. I prefer these when I don't add the dill.  Good stuff!

These potatoes had an awesome flavor.  I substituted olive oil for the canola oil.  They were a bit too greasy, so next time I will cut some of the butter and oil.

These potatoes were a big hit at my Valentine's Day dinner party.  The bright lemon flavor with the dill and butter was outstanding!  This will be a new family favorite.

I used red potatoes and it wasn't necessary to peel them. Scaled the dressings back and put any extra on the fish I was cooking. Worked well and came together very quickly. Ten minutes before the end, I tossed the potatoes in the pan to brown another side. Next time I think olive oil would be better.

Really liked the recipe, did use olive oil Instead as that what I had. Also tested the lemon first before juicing. Also added some fresh rosemary.

I made these exactly as written, except for using a turnip instead of one of the potatoes (diabetic in the family). The turnip came out as very good . They potatoes were FABULOUS! I am going to try them on the grill next, since it doesn't heat up the house that way. Thank you for sharing this, Laura.!

Just like at the Greek Restaurant! Enough butter mixture for potatoes to serve 6 or 7 people. I broiled at the end to crisp them up a bit. Yum!!

These were delicious! I brought them to a potluck and received many compliments. I made them with baby potatoes which I cut in half. I used lemon juice from a fresh lemon, extra garlic, and added a tablespoon of oregano. They were crispy and garlicy! Yummm.

These were a nice tangy change from regular roasted potatoes.  The lemon and dill made them pop.  I will be making these again.

Made these delicious Yukon gold potatoes this week and loved every bite!
I used 1-2T - Olive oil,  2-3T - butter which seemed to be enough to do the job.   Otherwise kept pretty much the  same, except for extra garlic and finished the dish with freshly grated lemon using  a microplane!  
A keeper for sure, can't wait to make for company.  Used to get  these at a local Greek rest., but now mine are even better.?? Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe second time making these I never really measured the oil or butter just mixed enough to coat the potatoes with a little extra in the pan while roasting. Didn’t add or subtract anything perfect recipe as is. Lemon potatoes are one of my favorite ways to eat potatoes and this really went over well with the family. Will be making these weekly.

I love this recipe!  i’ve used it several times.  Sometimes i’ll tweak it and add oregano instead of dill.  I like to add more lemon then what the recipe calls for, but it’s a simple recipe and yummy!

I made it exactly how the recipe directed, a mess of oil/butter in the pan at the end and not enough lemon flavour for my liking. The pan side of the potatoes scorched a bit, wish I has tossed them part way through roasting. May have been a parchment paper on cookie sheet problem though.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  We are doing the Whole30 diet so I used olive oil in place of the canola oil and butter.  Just like another reviewer said, cooking is about judgment and I used enough oil to coat the potatoes I was using.  The lemon and dill work perfectly together and the potatoes got a beautiful crispy edge to them.  This one is a keeper!

I didn't use all that oil instead I just coated the potatoes with it.  I cooked them on the BBQ at 400 F.to begin and then lowered the temperature.  Watch them carefully to ensure that they don't burn. Very tasty and would make again.

Great flavor! I agree with other reviewers: too much oil. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4c melted butter and 1 Tbls coconut oil, and it was a lot. Others said the lemon flavor was light, so I subbed lemon pepper for the ground pepper and added a few grinds of fresh peppercorns. Loved the dill flavor! I didn't peel the potatoes. Made it extra crispy and didn't lose nutrients--easier too! I cut my potatoes small and shaved 10min off the cooking time. Will definitely make again!

I added cayenne pepper for more flavor, as this recipe, though simple and healthy, is quite bland, even with extra dill weed.

I used 1.5 tbsp of oil and it was still a lot or maybe I could do less butter next time. I used lemon pepper seasoning since I had no lemons on hand. Everything else stayed the same! It was very tasty!

I let the  potatoes and all ingredients except the butter sit in a bowl in the fridge for a couple hours to marinate. Then put the butter on when ready to bake

There is so much liquid between the lemon, oil and butter that the potatoes steam more than roast. It was hard to get them browned and the lemon and dill were just lost somewhere in the process.

I made this almost exactly as described and absolutely loved it!! I did reduce the butter some and eliminated the salt all together (both for health reasons), and it was truly delicious. We are anxious to make it again!

We really liked these and will make them again. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time will probably use olive oil instead and this summer, fresh dill from the garden. Very good!!

Great!!  I cut the recipe in half and used olive oil instead of canola.  I am a lover of all things lemon and this recipe really appealed to me.  My husband is not as fond of lemon but couldn't identify the lemon flavor until I told him it was there.  We will make this one again and again.

Needs more salt and lemon juice. Halved the butter and used chicken stock for remainder - really stupid idea.

Absolutely delicious, love how easy it is to make and the taste is really great!  I substituted grape seed oil for the canola, and did'nt put dill  weed and added more garlic. Also, I let the potatoes marinate for at least 4 hrs in the fridge. Since I use a Ziplock to coat the potatoes, I freeze the oil/butter for a smaller batch another time. No waste, works when I'm in a hurry too!

This is recipe is a keeper. I made it per the recipe but had to cut it in half and had to sub the dill for celery seed and rosemary. I suggest that you flip the potatoes half way through and check on them around 18-20 minutes. I cooked them for 22 and feel that they would have been better if they were pulled out earlier.

I had to add a little more lemon juice and dill. I used the recommended oil/butter and it turned out WAY too oily. The potatoes were like little oil sponges and oil spurted oil out into your mouth when you bit into them. I would recommend using the 1/4 or 1/3 cup of oil or butter, but definitely not both.

Really enjoyed these potatoes. There seemed to be a lot of liquid to pour over the potatoes on the baking sheet so I reserved some and sautéed spinach with it. Served with Italian style roast beef. Thx Laura.

My husband said, "definitely 5 stars!" So, there it is. These were very good. In a pinch, I used garlic powder(about 1 1/2 tsp), vegetable oil, since I didn't have canola oil, russet potatoes, and I probably used about 2 or 3 tbsp. of lemon juice(didn't measure). Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Really, really good. The flavor of these was fantastic (prepared exactly as the recipe is stated), and they get nice and crisp. The only reason this isn't getting five stars from me is that I wish the potatoes had a stronger lemon flavor. My benchmark for these might be too high (I made this because of how good the lemon potatoes are at the most amazing Greek restaurant ever), but the ones I love have a more distinct lemon flavor. I will definitely make these again, though....everyone liked them, from grandpa all the way down to the two-year-old..... but I am going to try to tweak by adding more lemon juice. I will admit that I didn't read everyone's reviews (which may have addressed this) like I normally do, so I wasn't as informed as I should have been :) All around a thumbs up, though.

Loved this recipe! Added extra garlic, juice from 2 lemons and some lemon peel, left skins on potatoes. Put all in a gallon zip lock bag and marinated for 2 hours and baked. Loved the strong lemon taste. Thanks so much for a new way to make potatoes!!

Nice tangy way to cook up some potatoes.  I used this as a side dish for salmon.  My oven tends to cook slow, so it took longer than 45 minutes to get the potatoes to nearly crispy.  Would be good as breakfast potatoes as well.  I just used 1/4 cup of olive oil, no butter.  I used red potatoes as well for some added color/flavor.

delicious!  I wasn't sure I had time to bake the potatoes for 45 minutes, so I boiled them first (in small pieces), then coated them in the sauce, and then baked them for about 15 minutes.  It ends up being similar baking time, but I wanted to make sure the potatoes were soft and fully cooked. Success!

These potatoes have a great flavor. I agree that it's very easy to put too much oil/butter into this. The solution I had was just to not pour any of the excess butter over the potatoes when putting them into the oven.

I would use a bit less lemon, but otherwise, they were great.

The vegetables tasted amazing- the lemon and dill were a perfect combination. My husband and I loved this flavoring....I added baby carrots in with the potatoes and they tasted so good!

I reduced this to one serving.  I mixed it all in a glass baking dish rather than dirtying a bowl.  I omited the butter and just used enough canola oil to lightly coat the potatoes.  I also stirred them several times while baking.  It is a nice flavour combination.  I had wondered if the lemon would taste good on potatoes-- but next time I think I will add even more lemon juice!

These didn't have a whole lot of flavor...need to add much more seasoning.  I did enjoy the crispness of the potatoes and would make again with modifications.

Really, really good and smells great while in the oven. I smashed the garlic and left them whole so they would flavor oil/butter and I could take them out easily if they started burning, whichthey did a bit, but not a problem.

Would give this 3.5 stars.  A nice, solid roasted potato recipe, though nothing spectacular.  I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil, which was just enough, and I doubled the amount of lemon juice and garlic (halve them instead of mincing them b/c smaller pieces will burn and become bitter).  I roasted these for 40 minutes and then broiled them for 4 minutes, tossed them, and broiled for another 4 minutes.  This ended up browning and crisping the potatoes quite nicely.

I'm just learning how to cook, and I found this recipe very easy.  Dad & I thought it was delicious!  Next time I think I would add a litte more lemon.

I cut the servings for two people so I didn't measure the ingredients. I didn't feel it was necessary to peel. It's faster if you don't peel but do mix in a bag. For some reason it really wasn't crispy so I did put it under the broiler, which helped. I'd try it again.

These were delicious and I only had a few minor changes. Since I did cut up the potatoes to be fairly small, there was around 10 minutes less cooking time. I also scaled down the oil/butter a bit and in the end, wished I had sprinkled the dill on top instead of mixing it all in because it ended up coating the bowl and it was difficult to get the remaining amount onto the potatoes.  Overall, the dill, garlic, and hint of lemon worked wonderfully together.

The oil/butter was not too much for us.  I did use one extra potato, but like someone else said, you need to size it up for the quantity you are cooking.  Fabulous flavor - I will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing.

Super good.  In place of the oil I used chicken broth. I had no dill weed so I used oregano instead.  Great lemon and garlic flavor.
