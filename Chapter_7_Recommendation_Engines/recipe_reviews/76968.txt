This was so good and easy. Like the previous reviewer, I used romaine. I tossed the shrimp in a resealable bag with olive oil, sea salt, and lemon pepper, and then I cooked it in a grill pan. The lemon pepper really added to the flavor (I omitted the sugar). Plus, I used tomato-basil feta and fresh oregano--yum! This is a definite keeper. Next time, I'll try adding sun-dried tomatoes.

Perfect for a quick and healthy meal. To make it more "greek" I used romaine lettuce. I was in a hurry so instead of dicing tomatoes, I just used a can of diced tomatoes. It had some green chiles in it which added a good kick to the salad. I only had a small amount of shrimp because I was only making the salad for myself so I just tossed it on the George Foreman grill... it was ready in about a minute.

Made this for a date over the summer... we both really love greek salads so it's a little hard to impress us! Next time I'll add red onion, use a combination of spinach and romaine, and maybe add in some artichoke hearts to make it even more greek! Overall it was good, I used frozen Shrimp which I made on my George Forman really quickly. Really liked the dressing for the salad, very complimentary, not overpowering.

Awesome recipe. I tried putting the shrimp in a bag with the olive oil, lemon pepper and sea salt and omitting the sugar as suggested by a reviewer before skewering. The shrimp tasted good enough to eat alone without everything else, but together it was fabulous.

Whipped this up tonight with frozen bag of pre cooked shrip, green olives and black olives, added a few more vegetables like mushrooms, (didn't have cucumbers).  Impressive and dressing recipie was great, needed quite a bit of kosher salt sprinkled over it after tossing, to bring out flavors. Yummmy.  I will make again, with what ever I have available for produce.

It was too cold to grill, so I tossed the shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted them at 400 degrees for 6 minutes.  I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the shrimp mixture for more flavor.  Great served with pita crackers and hummus.

I thought the kalamata olives overpowered the shrimp a bit, but I like the concept. I made enough for 2 servings and had the first one over lettuce, as that is what I had. I used the rest as the base for a 
Greek-style pasta salad. I think the recipe has potential  as inspiration and may deserve a higher rating when it is tailored to specific tastes.

I really liked this, but the rest of the family didn't - they said it might be better without the olives. But that's the taste I like best. The morale - if they don't like olives don't go for this one. I'll make it again when it's just me.

Very flavorful, colorful and easy to make.  I added red onions like someone suggested, and used balsamic vinegar.  Will definitely make it again!

I did change this recipe a little bit.  I put the shrimp in a rub and gave it a quick toss in the skillet .  I also made a citrus salad dressing for it using greek yogurt, lemon juice , garlic, salt, lemon pepper and herbs de provence.  It turned out really nice.

i absolutely loved this recipe. I will make again. I used frozen shrimp that I thawed and then put into a bag with a little olive oil, sea salt, old bay, and a little pepper. Otherwise followed the recipe. Using sea salt again. I think next time I will add a little red onion to the salad. I also think this would be good with some steak instead of shrimp. I guess any meat would be great!

This was pretty good. I used cooked shrimp, so this literally took me less than 10 minutes to throw together. Next time I would add a clove of garlic for more flavor.
