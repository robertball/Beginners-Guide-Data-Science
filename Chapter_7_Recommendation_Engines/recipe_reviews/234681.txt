This is like lemonade with chia seeds. I am looking for different pre run drinks and foods and this may be a new favorite. I need to go run and try it out. I will note I did not measure my lemon juice, just used fresh lemon juice .

This was yummy and healthy. I was disappointed with the sugar so I substituted it with blue agave nectar instead and it tasted fine! Defiantly refreshing for a sip in the garden!!

Refreshing on warm winter day - 82 degrees and Santa Ana winds blowing. Substituted organic raw honey instead of the sugar.

Easy way to add fiber to your diet.  I have a glass nearly every day.  

Like others,  I use agave as my sweetener of choice.  Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe!

Nice and refreshing to drink outside. I really liked the lingering chia seeds in my mouth to crunch on.
