I made quite a bit more hearty with chopped carrots, chopped zucchini, more garlic, a whole large sweet onion, and chopped red pepper. This only needed one jar of spaghetti sauce--I used an organic brand. Because I'm on a budget, I used Trim cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I also took a tip from Pioneer Woman and used deli sliced mozzerella cheese instead of shredded which made it a snap to put together (TIP: This makes for a firmer lasagna, too.). This was a good meatless dinner for us to trim down the budget a bit (and our dinner guests that don't eat meat). We all enjoyed this. Next time, I would add a little more spice--like oregano and a little red pepper flake.

Made this last night for dinner. Followed the recipe exactly, but used Newmans Marinara instead of the Classico and used whole wheat noodles. It turned out ALRIGHT. Definitely way to much cheese. 
UPDATE:
Ate for leftovers once and threw the whole thing away. This recipe needs some tweaking!

LOVE IT! It's a hit with all my meat eaters and we can't get enough. The only change is that I used half the amount of ricotta the recipe calls for and substituted cottage cheese for the other half so that its lower in calories and more lean.

I made this last night, my sons girlfriend is a vegetarian so I wanted to make something special. I followed the recipe except I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, it turned out delicious! I would recommend this recipe, may never use meat in Lasagna again!
