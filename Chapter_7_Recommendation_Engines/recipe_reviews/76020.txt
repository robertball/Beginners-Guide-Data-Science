Love this! I've had these at a The Apple Barn in Pidgeon Forge,TN. Not sure if the recipe is exact but it sure comes close(didn't use mint)~might try it with a drop or two of rum flavored extract. Delicious!  :)

This is great!  I loved it and so did my family.  I left out the mint garnish since I didn't have any on hand.

I first had this old time southern drink at the Apple Barn in Tennessee. On those hot Arizona desert days this is the cool refreshing drink to have after a long day of herding cattle.

Very good! Most times I make it without the mint. BTW... It is the same recipe as the Apple Barn's in Pigeon Forge.

This is very main-stream to me....it isn't BAD, but it just is like run-of-the-mill, something I can buy in-store type of of thing.  If I were to make it again, I think I would back off the pineapple juice a tad and even the apple juice...and add a bit more lemon juice for an added zing.  :)

I love this recipe and so does everyone who's tried it.  It's great for the kids and mix it with a sweeter white wine and you have a nice spritzer too!

Very yummy and a huge hit when I served a few other recipes from the "southern cooking" collection. Light and tasty for anytime... add a splash of Malibu for a summer evening cocktail :)

I didn't have any mint, but this drink is great anyway!  All the flavors combine really well.  It's like a healthier punch (since it doesn't have any added sugar).  I will definitely make it again.  I used pulp free orange juice which I think was a good call because as much as I like pulp in plain OJ, I think it would have been out of place here.

I was a bit unsure of this recipe; however, I wanted a non-alcoholic beverage at my party. I added more crussed mint than called for as well as about 3/4 cup of raspberries. It was great! I will definitely make it again!
