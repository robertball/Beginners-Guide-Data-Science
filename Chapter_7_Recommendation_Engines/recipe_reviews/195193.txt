Wonderful recipe and delicious, more as a dessert than a salad for our family, but refreshing and delish. Made exactly as recipe stated. I used Cool Whip the second time I made it and it still turned out great.

I made this for Easter with ham and scalloped potatoes. It was great! You could almost use it for a dessert though because it was very sweet. A very pretty spring salad/dessert.

I was a little skeptical with putting mayo in this, but it turned out amazing. My husband turned his nose up at this until he tried it and loved it. I substituted the whipping cream with cool whip and it still came out fantastic. I didn't have any problems with dish not setting even though lemon top was a little soupy when I first put into fridge. It came out perfect. I will definitely make again.

I was so happy to find this recipe.  It sounded like a recipe that was brought to many holiday feast at my house when I was a child.  The great aunt who brought it would never give anyone the recipe.  Many of us tried to duplicate it but no luck.  Then I found this, ran right out to buy the ingredients and stayed up till 1 am to make it. Joy of joy this was the recipe, call everyone I could think of in the family and passed it on.  It has brought back many good memories of family and friends.  Can't wait to present it on Thanksgiving.   Someone else gets to bring it for Christimas.  Good Times.

I enjoyed this and made as written, except did not add the nuts due to people who are allergic.  I might try it w/ a different flavor such as strawberry pie filling next time.

I thought this was very good.  Easy to make.  I made it for Thanksgiving but hardly anyone ate it (but that is not too surprising as this particular crowd doesn't do jello salads much).  My 4 year old was put off by the top lemon layer - just a weird texture for him,  I think.

This was really good. Had all the ingredients in the house and wanted to use up the cherry pie filling as I am not a big fan of it. I will make this again for Christmas in my tree mold. Very pretty and tasty.

Instead of strawberry jello, I used cherry. I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and pecans instead of walnuts. Different but incredibly tasty. It reminded me of Strawberry Jello Salad but without the crust. I think that I would have liked more of a cream cheese layer but honestly, I think it's personal preference. My kids thought this was amazing, especially my youngest. I would make this again.

I made this as a dessert for our New Years eve party.  All who tried it, wanted the recipe, which I gladly gave it.  I made it as written only eliminated the walnuts because of food allergies. 
Otherwise it was GREAT!!! Thank you for sharing.

LOVED THIS RECIPE. IT WAS A BIG HIT AT THE PARTY I ATTENDED. I MISTAKENLY ADDED 8 OZ OF CREAM CHEESE INSTEAD OF 3 OZ THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR BUT IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I WILL BE MAKING IT THE SAME WAY NEXT TIME!

Instead of mayonnaise I used [so delicious] (coconutmilk yogurt alternative) it's dairy free I tried with vanilla -blueberry and peach my fave was using the chocolate flavored one either way it's a nice little switch up each time

I made this for Christmas dinner and was excited to try it. The lemon jello smelled so good while I was preparing it. What a disappointment. No one in my family cared for this. It'll be Strawberry Pretzel Jello for us.

Used lime jello and lime juice instead of lemon and black cherry jello on bottom... Yummy! And a pretty red and green for Christmas dinner.

Yum - this salad graced our Thanksgiving table.  I actually made it because my guys do not enjoy cranberry salad.  This was wonderful.  The lemon layer was tart and off-set the sweetness of the cherry layer.  I used sugar-free gelatin and added roasted almonds to half the pan and left the other half plain for my nut disliking son!

I use cherry jello and instead of lemon I use pineapple jello.  Instead of lemon juice, I use the pineapple juice from the crushed pineapple.  I top with toasted coconut.

I don'tknow what I missed, but I thought the top lemon layer was way too sour with the 1/4 cup pf lemon juice.  If I make it again, I will not add the lemon juice. Some had reviewwed that it was very sweet, but I don't see how being that there was no sugar and had all that lemon juice. I just don't get it.
