I made these.  They are very easy and really yummy.  I followed the recipe just as written.  It worked very easily.  I do feel the need to say that my home is air conditioned and thus cool.  I think that these pralines would not harden well in a house that was a bit warmer on a summer day.

The worst part was that it stuck to the waxed paper and was impossible to get off.  It was also rather tasteless.

I used half butter and half lard, and the flavor was wonderful.  The candy never hardened / set completely, even after 7 hours of cooling.  No matter, though. The taste made up for it!!!!
