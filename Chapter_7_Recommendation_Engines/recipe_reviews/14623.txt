Made this for Christmas dinner.  It was the only disappointment of the evening.  I believe this could be very good if used on a less-expensive cut of meat.  As it was, not enough of the original meat flavors came through; the marinade was too strong.

I served this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used a tsp. ground ginger.  It turned out wonderful.  I poured the pan drippings through a metal sieve to remove the marmalade (and other) chunks, then mixed it with a package of instant gravy mix and the gravy was incredible too.  My husband said this was the best prime rib he has ever tasted!  My in-laws really seemed to enjoy it.  My son, who was tired and cranky that evening, refused to eat everything else on his plate, but he ate all his meat!!  I have never made roast beef before, but this recipe was really easy and very, very good.

This is an excellent recipe!  I was a bit afraid of ruining an expensive cut of meat.  Not a chance--everyone loved it.  It was still rare at 2 hours, so gave it another 1/2 hour--tender, juicy and still some rare for those that like rare and medium to medium well for others.  We will be having this one again!  Thanks so much.

WOW!!!
Having lost my Father this past July, I knew it would be my job to take on the Christmas dinner. I found this recipe and the rest is history. All 23 people were amazed at how wonderful this roast tasted. My Dad would of been so proud of me..:) Thanks!

This recipe would be better on a pork tenderloin.  If you are looking for a traditional prime recipe, than this is not the one for you.  It did make the best sandwiches the next day.

I made a couple small changes to this recipe, just due to what I had at home. Frozen OJ concentrate instead of marmalade, chili oil instead of pepper sauce, and white wine instead of beer. This roast recipe is FANTASTIC! Even my 2 year old annihilated it. I added some halved new red potatoes and thick sliced carrots the last half hour, sprinkled with a little rosemary. I was hoping for next day lunch leftovers, but there weren't any.  DEFINATELY making this part of our monthly menu.  =)

This was delicious!  We made it for Thanksgiving and it was so tender.  My husband thought there was too much garlic, but I couldn't disagree more!  We used this recipe for a little over 3 lb piece of prime rib and I have one word for it.....YUM!

This is a fabulous recipe and the marinade that cooks with the roast makes for outstanding gravy. I wanted something a little different for a prime rib special dinner and this one got raves from kids and adults alike! Definitely will do again.

I made this for Christmas dinner, doubling the recipe and cooking it to 150 degrees for medium. It got rave reviews, then we made French Dip sandwiches the next day with the leftovers. It was delicious!

What a bizarre combination for a marinade.  I have served it for the past two x-mas dinners.  Absolutely excellent.

I was extremely nervous about Christmas dinner being my responsability...when my husband asked for Prime Rib, I didn't even know where to begin.  I found this recipe and tried it because it sounded interesting.  This was sooooo good.  My husband was quite impressed, as was my mom who normally does the cooking.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This turned out very good.  Couldn't taste the marinade alot, and definetly coat your pan with tin foil because it made a mess in the pan.  Had to cook about 30 minutes longer till it was 145 degrees.  That made it a nice medium after letting it sit 30 minutes

This is now my Christmas staple!  People remember the wonderful tenderness and aroma of this meal, and it's so easy.  (I highly recommend choosing Guinness.)

The only changes I make to this recipe is using a nice sweet hot mustard instead of the mustard powdr and hot pepper sauce.  The taste is a bit smoother.

Excellent!  I started with 4 for dinner and ended up with 8.  Everyone who smelled it cooking asked to stay.  It melts in your mouth.  the key is a good cut of meat.

I followed the recipe to the last letter. But I also tripled the marinade put my 14lb. rib roast in two 13 gallon trash bags, poured the marinade into the bag, tied bag and put in my extra fridge. I marinaded it for two days. used all of the marinade in my roasting pan so that it doesn't evaporate to fast. The end result was magnificent!Thank you for a superb recipe. My whole family loved it.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was so good!  It took an extra hour to get it to medium rare and the roast was only a 5 pounder, but it may have been my oven.  Everyone loved it, my 7 year old son ate as much as his dad and my 2 1/2 year old daughter (who is VERY picky) ate more than I did!  Will definately make it again for a special treat!

I've used this recipe about 10 times over the years with amazing results each time.  I won't cook one any other way.

Good enough.  I needed to cook mine longer than what it said.  It ended up cooking for an additional 30 minutes at 325 and then 30 more at 350.  But it was still pretty rare and I was going for Medium Rare.

Having never made any kind of prime rib before, I was terrified when I first tried this recipe--for Christmas dinner.  My entire family literally went ape over it.  I have made it a few times since, and each time have had people falling all over themselves over it.  If you make this in a large roasting pan, so the marinade is shallow in the pan, it will cook down to almost nothing, and can be made into a gravy so good it should be its own food group.  Cook with confidence--this recipe's a sure thing. Enjoy!!

This recipe is wonderful. I prepared the prime rib roast in the morning and the marinade worked all day. After soaking several hours we put it on the rotisserie in the BBQ and it turned out beautifully. We enjoyed it with roasted garlic baby potatoes and blanched green beans. A delicious meal, a wonderful recipe. Thanks!

A good prime rib dinner is my all time favorite and this recipe was really good but not the best that I've made.  For some reason the orange marmalade left an after taste.  I've never had a bad prime rib but some recipes are better than others so I'll stick to my regular way to prepare.

This recipie was a huge success for us at Christmas. It was simple to make, and very flavorful. The mairnade did make the meat tender and added a succulent flavor. I even made a rue with the left over juice by adding a little flour that topped off the whipped potatoes perfectly! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

I'm don't seem to be a good run lately in terms of not liking recipes that others have rated highly. I had high hopes for this based on all the positive reviews. I made this tonight but my family and I thought that this marinade just didn't at all compliment the flavour of the beef. It was Ok but not great. I doubt we'll be having this again.

I made this last Christmas and even an avowed ginger hater loved it! I'm making it, again, this year, and sharing the recipe with a friend! 
BTW...I was not looking for one ingredient to "stand  out."  The idea is to create a marinade to enhance the meat, not highlight the marinade!

I made this with a chuck roast instead of a prime rib, since my grocer didn't have a prime rib. I used everything else as is but instead of cooking in the oven, I used the crock pot thinking this would be just as good as marinating the meat. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as flavorful as I was hoping. The meat didn't need the olive oil and ended up diluting the marinade I think. Next time I will definitely allow it to marinade and not use the oil.

The flavor was just "okay," not what I've come to appreciate and love in restaurant cooked prime rib.  I had a five pound rib, much smaller than the eight pounder called for in the recipe--and much of the meat was overcooked--my bad.  My meat thermometer stopped working, so I was forced to "guess" on doneness.  I hate it when that happens.  One criticism:  Be more specific when writing recipes folks.  Inexperienced cooks like me need the details.  For example, "poke holes all over the meat with a two-pronged fork" is way too general.  I poked too long, and unfortunately, the meat turned out a bit shredded.  I'm certain this recipe would have turned out much better with a better cut of meat (mine was actually two pieces tied together), a meat thermometer and fewer holes.

Even though this roast was delicious, it wasn't very flavorful.  My marinate burned in the pan.  I would suggest adding a lot more liquid as the sugars in the marinate tend to burn the juices.  The meat tasted good but the flavors were not intense.  I will make it again except next time I will add more liquid during cooking.  The cooking times are not very exact.  I had to cook mine a lot longer (I only had a 5 lb. roast), so the meat was a little dry.  It will still make fabulous leftovers for sandwiches.

Although, due to allergies, we had to replace the soy sauce with worcestershire - this was wonderful.  We had a boneless roast and, at a guests' request, we overcooked it but it was still tender, juicy and very tasty.

I'm a very inexperienced cook and when I told my friends that I was even attempting this recipe they all widened their eyes in horror. I had already bought the meat which was quite expensive, so I figured, oh well, might as well try it anyway.

Well, this recipe was perfect! It was the most delicious prime rib - even better than most restaurants. Super soft and moist but cooked through just right - you should definitely follow the temperature guidelines in the recipe.

I only wished I had marinated it a bit longer. The flavor was great, but it could have been even better with an overnight marinade.

I also thought this recipe was wonderful.  I used a Penzy's Cajun Rub on the pork first, then the BBQ sauce.  I didn't use 'baby' back ribs, I used a much larger cut of meat & they still turned out wonderful.  Thanks great recipe!!

Before I tried this recipe, I was LOST with the whole idea of making prime rib that was tasty, juicy and flavorful.  This recipe is the BEST!!!!  Now, if only I knew how "heart heatlthy" it was, because my hubby is on a low fat, low cholesteral diet!  Regardless, if you've always thought that really good prime rib was out of reach for you, this recipe is for YOU????

This is so simple to make!  Very good!  I only marinaded the meat for an hour and it still came out very tasty!  I had doubts about the recipe at first, because I never thought about using ginger, orange marmalade, brown sugar and beer on prime rib.  Nevertheless, it came out fantastic!  YUM!  The taste is a refreshing alternative to the typical plain old prime rib.  This recipe is a keeper!

My son-in-law purchased a beautiful prime rib roast for Christmas dinner. He asked me to prepare the roast. Thank goodness William shared this recipe with us. My Christmas dinner was a huge success due to this recipe. I would highly reccommend this recipe when using this expensive piece of meat.

I'm with the reviewer who said the marinade was too strong.  It took away from the natural flavor of the roast.  Wouldn't make it again.

Probably the best prime rib I've ever done!

I didn’t get a 8 pound prime rib since I was just preparing this for my husband and I, so I got the 4 pound. The marinade amount was still the perfect amount and made the roast so tender and juicy. For my beer I love dark lagers so I used Yuengling. I cooked mines to well done since it was my first time and I wanted to try it this way first. Came out perfect and the aroma filled the house with such a pleasant smell. I definitely plan on doing this again but rare this time.

I've made this twice now and it was delicious both times. The first time I followed the recipe just as instructed, but the second time I had to play with cooking times once the temp was reduced and dropped it as low as 250.

Also, on the second one I used a 16 pound roast, but because I knew several guests don't care for pink meat, I cut about 1/3 off and made a smaller roast. I monitored the temperature on the larger portion and when the center was done to 140, the smaller portion was cooked through and moist. 

I also suggest using a rack and basting so the marinade doesn't overpower the meat flavor.

Very good, used a boneless roast. I added some boiler onions to the carrots and celery. Easy to make.

The ginger overpowered the taste of the meat. I really could kick myself for using this recipe instead of just a simple prime rib recipe. We ate it but it was far from good. I would never make this again...

I make this every year for the Christmas roast. The ingredients seem odd, but let it cook and you will end up with a wonderful roast. I never lasts. The sauce is amazing. If you have any left over for sandwiches they come out delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
