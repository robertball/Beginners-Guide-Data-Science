WAY TOO MUCH lime for the amount of drink.  I used 1/2 a regular lime and even that was almost too much.  I had to split the recipe and then add more sugar and Cacha√ßa to make this palatable.  Either use a small (key) lime or use at least 1 tbsp of sugar...otherwise it's just not the right mix.

Tastes nice and authentic.  Very refreshing and simple.  This is not a drink for everyone - particularly those who are used to drinking those over-sweet cocktails made with flavoured spirits that you find in most bars.  Very nice recipe for a classic cocktail.  I garnished mine with a curled lime peel and mint.
