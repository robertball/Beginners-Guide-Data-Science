Wow. Ten stars. I had some bacon and baby spinach to use up and found this recipe. I had to make a change due to what I had, but am rating anyway because I think the result would have been VERY similar. I didn't have creamy Italian dressing, but only had regular. Assuming (and I apologize if I'm wrong) that creamy Italian dressing has a "mayo-like" base, I used the bottle of regular Italian dressing in place of the creamy, and then used 1/3 cup mayo in place of the regular Italian which I'm thinking "evened" everything out. Everything else I followed EXACT. SOOOOO GOOD!!! Where has this recipe been all my life?! I can't wait to try this out on everyone this summer at family and neighborhood BBQs!

Add the bacon just before serving and grate some fresh parmesan on top before serving.  I find Good Seasons packet dressing you make yourself the best.

I loved it but changed a few things the second time I made it. I tossed the warm pasta with a couple Tablespoons of Bacon grease, used arugula instead of spinach, omitted the creamy dressing and added some fresh cilantro. Big hit both times.

I agree with the other reviewer that the bacon was soggy--I would substitute ham or salami for the added smoky flavor.  Also, "wilting" that amount of  spinach inevitably leads to clumping.  I would simply toss in uncooked baby spinach leaves.  I didn't love this and probably won't make it again, but that having been said, I made it for a potluck and came back with an almost-empty bowl.

Recipe is good, but the bacon gets soggy. Think next time i will add this either right before serving or buy bacon bits. I also added more dressing and even a little ranch for a bit of creaminess.

Great salad!  Reading about several reviewers having soggy bacon, I used thick bacon.  Problem solved.  Really great flavor.  The only changes I made were the bacon and I put 1 more tomato in it.  It just looked like it needed it.  I also had to add a little more salad dressing in it.  When I put it in the refrigerator to chill, it jelled up.  And it seemed dry when I stirred it up.  Putting a little more dressing loosened it up.
