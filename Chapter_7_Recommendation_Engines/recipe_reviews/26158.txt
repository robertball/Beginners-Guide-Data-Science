EXCELLENT SUMMER TREAT!!
My family loved them and they were easy to make. The centers stayed soft and chewy and the outside was crispy and crunchy. Great treat with a glass of cold milk. Be sure to use fresh ingredients...especially your baking powder.

I cook for a conference center in the Florida Keys and I am always looking for Key Lime recipes.  The dough was a little sticky, but the cereal held it together.  I used a clean spoon to roll the cookies in the cereal. Thanks for this one!!

The lime flavour is so refreshing! These cookies are better for adults - kids will not like these.  I used bran cereal crushed up and it worked fine.  I also added some cinamon and nutmeg for some spice!  The lime made them taste like candy cookies!

Flavor was pretty good, but that's where it stops.  Batter/dough was thin, as others mentioned, but I thought rolling in corn flakes would help.  It didn't.  Corn flakes helped keep cookies from sticking even more to pan (and my fingers), but only ended up around the edges of the top of the cookie and looked funny.  I baked a few without corn flakes because I ran out and didn't feel like crushing more and those were lumpy blobs once I scraped them off the cookie sheet.  They took about 5 minutes longer to bake than stated and I'm not sure they were done then.  I cooled them on a rack, but they were still chewey and after putting them in an airtight container, they're now one big messy lump.  The flavor tells me this recipe may have potential, but I'm not going to waste my time or ingredients figuring out how.

I was very disapointed with this recipe and sorry that I wasted the ingredients. The dough was way too sticky and they never quite baked right. I am wondering if some ingredient was missing....yuck.

I only give these cookies a 4 because of their looks.  The taste was great, I used frosted flakes instead of regular & fresh squeezed lime juice.  They were gone the same day I cooked them.  Family & friends loved them.  They flattened greately when I cooked them and the cornflakes spreak out randomly around the cookie, but it did not take away from the taste!

While these were a good idea, with good flavor, the texture just seemed off somehow. My friends that I made them with all thought they seemed a little too crunchy. We were thinking that if we rolled them in some softer cereal, like rice crispies, they might taste a little better. They weren't bad, but I probably wouldn't choose to make them again.

I was looking for a recipe that would use up a lot of powdered sugar & corn flake crumbs I had in my pantry from another recipe when I found this recipe.
I did add an additional 1/2 cup of flour to the recipe
& had no problem with them mounding & setting perfectly.  The second batch, I doubled, & didn't quite add enough extra flour to make them mound.  They still turned out wonderful & more waferlike.
Excellent flavor.  A definite keeper.
