A bit too sweet for us. Maple flavor dominated over the coffee flavor, but maybe we didn't make the coffee strong enough. Interesting to try but won't make it again.

It was pretty good.  A little too much half and half for me, but plenty of flavor.

All in all not bad, but far too rich and sweet for my taste.  I think though that this recipe will go over really well with people who like  cream and sweeter coffee.  My husband thought it was great!
