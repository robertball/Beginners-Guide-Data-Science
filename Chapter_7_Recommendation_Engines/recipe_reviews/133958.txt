I submitted this recipe and I just wanted to make a clarification.  You want to use Salt Beef or Salt Pork riblets (they are brine cured and can be purchased in pails).  Corned beef is a completely different product, with spices and a different taste.  Allrecipes changed the recipe when I submitted it, they probably thought it was the same thing and it isn't.  Also, it's probably best to keep the potatoes whole, or halved of they're large otherwise they'll end up boiling away to nothing.  Happy eating!

I love this recipe but there is one thing that I do differently. When making peas pudding I always hated cleaning the bag afterwards so instead I use a mason jar. Fill jar about 1 third to 1 half full.(The more people that you are cooking for the bigger the mason jar) Poke about 8-10 holes in the lid with a sharp knife. ( be very careful when doing this and remember to keep the lid so you will only have to do this once) Tie a string around the bottle just under the lid and tie the other end to the handle of your pot for easy removal. After it has boiled with the  meat and it is time to start adding vegtables, carefully take the bottle out of the water and let sit until veggies are almost cooked. before removing lid drain off any excess water through the holes in the lid, then just dump peas into bowl and season with butter and pepper. Clean up is so much easier, just rinse jar and put in dishwasher or clean with warm soapy water and a bottle brush.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time for my family.  Just a tip for those who haven't made anything like this before, be patient, and remember not to lift the pot lid when you are making the dumplings or they will go gooey in the center.

I just want to add a couple of things for anyone interested.  For any onion lovers, add full onions at the same time when adding the potatoes.  Also when I cook Jigg's dinner, I also bake a chicken (or turkey) stuffed with dressing and when it is all cooked I add the stock from the vegetables with the chicken stock and make gravy.  This dinner is our traditional Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter Sunday dinners in Newfoundland.

My parents always made this dinner every holiday and I just started making it for my own family.  I can't get enough of the pease pudding and salt beef...always my favourite.
NOTES:  Salt beef = aka: cured naval beef, you can sometimes buy it in bulk where you can pick and choose your beef rather than buying a bucket that is often very fatty.  If you come across a Newfoundland store, just ask the owners (they usually have the bulk beef in the "back"..they're not really supposed to advertise/sell it in bulk due to new regulations).

Other than that....eat it up, it's some good 'by!

I used this recipe as a guideline for the first time I ever made Jiggs Dinner and it came out really well! Great recipe, thanks! From a Newfoundlander born on the west coast! :)P.S. I really liked the peas pudding and the dumplings came out perfect all floating on the top!

Should have read the reviews before trying to make this one.  Although corned beef is completely different than salt beef, it's also completely tasty and can be used in the dinner instead if desired, although this makes it more English/Irish than Newfoundlander.

I also had a hard time even finding corned beef, but eventually I did find some at a specialty meat market.

I love Newfie Jiggs dinner!  One tip I'd like to add, I don't soak my salt beef overnight. I boil it for about 20 minuts first. drain about half the water and keep a cup or two of the salted water, just in case the dinner gets too "fresh". Also instead of making dumplings I make blueberry duff. Always a big hit.

I make this meal with a sweet pickeled cottage roll it tastes great and the fat from the cottage roll adds a lot of flavour and you can also skip the soaking overnight of the meat with this version

I found this very bland and very heavy. Perhaps I soaked the meat too long. However, I've given it two stars because my family did clean their plates (well, mostly).

Best Sunday dinner ever. We only have it on special occasions now but I don't know a Newfie who doesn't love a good feed of Jigg's...and hash the next day from the leftovers is almost better.

I used this recipe when I did up Jigg's Dinner for Thanksgiving but didn't know it then. That is, I found the recipe after. My main difference was winging it with the corn beef brisket(you can'r get riblets here)and the peas pudding...but both came out okay, if not a little overcooked with the salt beef.Doing it up again for Christmas dinner as I type this. 
You need to add the recipe for Newfoundland Dressing...Mount Scio Savory, bread crumbs and a little onion. Great stuff.

Love this recipe. I like to make a dressing of savory/onion/bread with it and mix in a spoon of the vegetable liquor. If its not too salty or fatty, I'll also drink a cup of the liquor with my meal. (like soup... it has all the vitamins. You'll crave it once you do it.) and like someone else stated on here... if you also cook a chicken/turkey and add the liquor to the gravy... its insanely delicious. OR save the liquor for the next time you're making turkey soup. DON'T WASTE THE LIQUOR!!!!!

there were people from Newfoundland visiting a friend of mine in Irricana, Alberta, Canada.  They invited a number of us up to their house for a Jigg's Dinner, which none of us Albertans had heard of.  Well to tell you, that was one of the best meals I have ever had.  We didn't have the dumplings but the peas pudding was out of this world as was the way the meat and vegetables were good.  Looking forward to having another one.

This is a great recipie... If some found it bland it was because the salt beef was soaked too long and for those who found it to be soupy they cooked it too long.

Best meal ever!  I only do this at Christmas when I also cook a turkey (slow roasted overnight in the oven) with Newfie dressing - not stuffing.  They are two different things.  I agree with previous reviews - keep the liquor water (or broth as mainlanders would call it) to flavor your gravy.  I don't dumplings, but add parsnip for my mom and brother.  Even my daughter who was born on the mainland has official declared she's a "Salt Beef Junkie" (is a song from Newfoundland and she loves her salt beef...as do I).  I soak the beef for about 2 hours before cooking it, and soak the split peas in the same pot as the beef.

I'm glad I used the salt beef, as I know that is what is used in Newfoundland.  It turned out perfectly.  Thank you for the recipe.

I wanted to try and re-create the dinners my newfie boyfriends mom used to make.  It really didn't have much flavour. I felt like I was eating flour.  I may try it again and add some more of my own ingredients.
