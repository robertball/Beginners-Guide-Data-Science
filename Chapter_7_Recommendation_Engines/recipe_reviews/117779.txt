This is an easy to make, scrumptious dessert! I like it a little less sweet with a little more PB.  Use crunchy PB then don't add the nuts!! I cut the recipe sort of in half for an 8x8 pan EXCEPT for the peanut butter: 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1/2 cup Hershey's special dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cup butterscotch, 1/2 cup no-sugar-added CRUNCHY peanut butter (it does have added salt)  I also used the multicolored marshmallows-they make a HUGE difference in the look of this bar!!! Thanks for the basic Huge Gain, No Pain recipe!

I made this twice in the last three days in an attempt to reproduce the local bakery's version. First batch: Baker's semi-sweet choco bar(8 squares): $5.25, mini rainbow marshmallows $1.89, 1 cup peanut butter about $1.00 total = $7.80  2nd batch: 2/3 bag of butterscotch chips: $2.40, mini rainbow marshmallows $1.89, 1/2 cup peanut butter about .50 cents, 1 dairymilk bar: $1.09 total  =$5.89. the second batch were perfect, great flavour and just enough "glue" to keep the squares chewy and come out of the pan easier.

Just what I needed! I did leave out the butterscotch chips because I didn't want to run to the store.

This was very sweet and the butterscotch seemed to make it almost TOO sweet.  This can definitely take care of any sweet craving!  Next time, I think I would add less butterscotch chips and maybe substitute peanut butter chips or additional chocolate chips instead.  Good recipe...good alternative to making cookies!

These were good but not quite the recipe I was looking for.  I would prefer more peanut butter, more chocolate and less butterscotch.  I used salted peanuts since thats what I had on hand and they were fine.

This was very yummy!! I had a little less chocolate chips/butterscotch chips than the recipe called for and no peanuts, but it still turned out delicious! Will make again!

I didn't really care for the bitterness of the semi sweet chocolate chips, made again with dairy milk bar and it was soooo good

Yummy!  A family member made some like this a year ago, and still hasn't given me her recipe.  But I think this may be it...it is a keeper!

I have been looking for this recipe for years! They are so simple to make and the recipe make a good size batch- use the multi-coloured mini marshmallows for the best presentation when sliced.

I made these at Christmas just like my Nana had for years and years. Now that she's 91, I've adopted the tradition. These bring back such fond memories!
