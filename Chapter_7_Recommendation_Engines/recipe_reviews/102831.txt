This recipe was very delicious! I did make a few mistakes though, and I hope by sharing them it will help others out.. First, I should have chopped my ingredients previous to starting the cooking - I used fresh spinach, mushrooms, and a frozen chicken breast I had to defrost and cook. I started boiling the lasagna noodles far too early so by the time I actually made the rolls, they were sticking together and some were ripped. The next mistake I made was doing the mushrooms separate - my boyfriend doesn't eat them, so I decided to add them to only a few rollups for myself, but the mushroom quantity ratio to the other ingredients was overpowering so they didn't turn out so well.  Also, the recipe says to boil 18 noodles and it makes 9 servings. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I could only fit 12 rollups in my 9x13 glass pan. I made them by having the noodle flat, adding filling along the middle, and rolling it up so it was layered (kind of) and very fat! If it is supposed to be done another way please let me know! I think the best part of this recipe was the combination of tomato and alfredo sauces with all the cheeses - absolutely delicious! Hope this helps!

This was really tasty! My boyfriend and I absolutley LOVED it! A few tips to share: #1 If you cook the noodles ahead of time, place them separately on top of wet paper towels to prevent them from drying out. #2 Cook the spinach and mushroom mix in white wine. It really adds a bit of great flavor #3 I thought it could use a little bit more ricotta and spinach. This is just personal taste, however, as I LOVE lasagna filling! #4 make sure the chicken is cut up really small to make it easier to eat as well as easier to roll up!! Great recipe!

This recipe is unbelievable! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written (pine nuts and all) and it was out-of-this world!

Wow!  This was delicious!  My boyfriend (who doesn't like spinach or mushrooms) had three servings (and I had two!)...I didn't use the pine nuts because I didn't have any.  I used low-fat alfredo sauce and 2% milk mozarella.  I also used a little more parmesan than called for (mostly because I wasn't paying attention when I put it in...but it still tasted wonderful).  I served it with some homemade garlic bread.  The marinara and alfredo go together VERY well...it gave the roll-ups a completely different taste than they would have had with either sauce alone.  I will definitely make this again!

I was gonna give this three stars until I ate it leftover.  It was so much better the second day, it was like a new meal.  Okay, here's the thing.  It was too dry.  Just my preference, I guess.  I like sloppy saucy lasagna.  This may have been perfect if I had added a jar of alfredo (or even marinara) to the chicken/spinach mixture.  Maybe even mix some mozzarella, or substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta.  That being said, the second day, I poured about half a jar of marinara on top and put it back in the oven, and it was awesome.  I was going to dump the leftovers, but now I'm looking forward to having it for dinner again.

Oh my goodness this was YUMMY! I didn't expect my husband to love it, because he's not a big spinach fan, but he had THIRDS when I made this.   The only change I made was to add extra sauce, based on other reviews. I think this recipe could actually be made without chicken and still be good if you're trying to make a vegetarian dish.   Next time I might add some caramelized onions to the spinach mixture or maybe sautee some garlic with it. This would be just to experiment and not because the recipe wasn't wonderful exactly as written.  THANKS!

These were absolutely delicious!  I made a couple changes. First, I added 2 eggs to the filling. There was no way the filling was going to stick together without something to bind it and eggs are a standard in lasagna filling, so two were just right.  Second, I used all marinara sauce instead of the marinara/alfredo combo.  My husband and I could not get enough of this meal!

I didn't add the mushrooms or pine nuts but it still turned out delicious!  Word of advice: COVER and bake for 40 mins (it will keep your noodles from getting tough). Then uncover, add cheese, and finish baking.

Agree with aswright1, a little more sauce would be great. Although more red and less white to keep it a little healthier. I used a packet of simply organic alfredo sauce - fast and easy(uses nf milk and you can add a little ff 1/2 and 1/2)to keep the fat/calories down. Tastes rich and creamy - no one will know the difference between this and the heavy fat version. I also added a little white wine with the mushrooms and spinach as one other reviewer suggested - great addition.  I sautéed some onions and a garlic with the chicken.  Excellent recipe - thank you!

Excellent although I did some subs as didn't have mushrooms or some of the other ingredients.  Added sundried tomatoes, used fresh spinach that I sauted in olive oil and garlic.  Used tomatoe based sauce instead of Alfredo and no pine nuts. Husband loved it, easy and good use of left over chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe!

So yummy! I wanted a lighter version of the recipe for a summer dinner so I made my own marinara sauce and light alfredo sauce. I also used fat free ricotta cheese. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

I really loved this recipe, I have been wanting to do some thing like this for a while. My family loved it and my husband doesn't really like spinach but he loved this. I added some red bell peppers to give it more color.

This was EXCELLENT!  I'd give  more stars if I could.  I made it with whole wheat lasagna noodles and half portobello and half regular mushrooms.  My family just loved it and I will make again and again.

this was amazing!!! i used 3 cups of marinara- and actually will probably use 4 next time. i also used half garlic flavored alfredo sauce and half regular. i took the suggestions from a few other reviews and also cooked my mushroom mixture with white wine, onion, and a few garlic cloves. this dish was excellent, and definitely one of my favorites!! next time i may try to make it with spicy italian sausage instead of the chicken.

Followed the recipe almost to a T. Only thing I did different was use fresh spinach. (chopped, sautéed and squeezed dry) Used garlic flavored Alfredo and my boyfriend and I still thought this was just OK. Even the next day we didn't find it any better. With all those yummy ingredients, we thought this was going to be a lot more flavorful. OH... and that prep time is way off. With all the chopping, and cooking of the chicken and mushrooms... it was more like an hour prep!

This was a great, rich, tasty dish! Everyone loved it! I sauteed my mushrooms (baby bella's), and baby spinach, in white wine. Extra sauce was a great suggestion.

This is GREAT!  My wife and sis-n-law said they don't want to have regular Lasagna ever again.  Before making it, I would suggest reading Bailey Martel's comments (the most recent prior to mine).  One note about pine nuts -- they were great when it was fresh, but on the scant few rollups that were left over (and I'm all about leftovers), the nuts morph into something that my wife and I didn't care much for.  Next time the nuts go on only half.

I was worried when I served these they would unroll but they were very neat to serve. It was a really nice change from pan lasagna. My husband hates spinach but he did not seem to notice.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  Me and my boyfriend made it and it came out great.  I'm actually a very picky eater and usually don't like mushrooms or spinach, but even I enjoyed it.  The only suggestion I would make is that there wasn't enough sauce.  We actually used twice as much marinara sauce and it just sucked everything up to the point where it was almost completely gone after it was done cooking.  But other than that...delicious.  :D Also, I wasn't sure how the pine nuts were going to fit in the dish, but it came to be a great addition.  I'd definitely make this again.

This was delicious! It tasted so good it could be sold at a 5 star Italian restaurant. The pine nuts add a delicious kick!

I loved it. I am not a cook and they turned out perfect. A little garlic bread and wine and this dish could have been served at a 5 star resturant. Relatively easy to make and delicious.

Amazing Recipe! I made this for my daughter and myself by halving the recipe (she took the leftovers home). I used one chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken (to save time), and used an entire jar each of marinara and Alfredo because we love saucy pasta! I wish I had made the entire recipe! Cannot wait to make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly (although many reviews had helpful tips) and it turned out great!  I especially enjoyed the Alfredo sauce and the mushrooms, made for an interesting taste!

These were good, will make again.  Added 2 eggs to filling as per others suggestions, I think it helped.  Added more marinara but was still a bit dry.  Perhaps I wasn't supposed to squeeze excess water out of spinach (?) maybe next time I'll try that or add 1/2 can stewed tomatoes.  Added garlic to spinach/mushroom mix for more flavor. Pine nuts didn't seem necessary, next time will save myself the expense. I could only fit 15 rollups in my 9x13 so didn't need all 18 noodles.  Overall good recipe.

I rarely write a review since usually someone in my large family has a complaint about a recipe.  This recipe was the exact opposite of almost any other dish that I've made.  I've now made this recipe twice, once following exactly the ingredients and once with a few minor changes.  Both time the dish turned out amazing but I do have to say that following the recipe without any changes is the best way to go, even down to the pine nuts.  The few changes I made were omitting the pine nuts and using regular canned mushrooms, which still turned out great but just a tad under the exact recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing the best recipe (for our household) we have ever tried.  Rhonda

Delicious:) I added extra sauce as most everyone suggested, but still needed more. That's my only critique. Will make again.

A little bland in my opinion. Next time I'll try more marinara and hot sausage instead of chicken.

Delicious and easy.  I definitely recommend using more sauce, though, as others have recommended.

Ok..I didn't much care for the mixture of the red and white sauces, but my kids loved it and my daughters friend said that it was the best "whatever that was" she ever had.  Her dad asked for the recipe so to be fair even though I didn't like it i gave it 4 stars.

My entire family loved this recipe. I always have my own variations for recipes and this is what I did to round this one out. I cubed the chicken and boiled in chicken stock. With a kitchen dicer I diced the cooked chicken and mushrooms. I also added garlic to the mushroom/spinach saute. I spot checked the dish while baking and added more sauce as the marinara is quickly absorbed my the noodles. Overall, a great dish.

This was great, my husband and I both enjoyed it!  The only changes I made were, sauteed garlic with the spinach and mushrooms and I mixed a bit of alfredo with the marinara sauce.  This is a great recipe to sort of mix and mash different ingredients - you know whatever is on hand.  I have plenty left over for another dinner or lunches, thank you for this recipe.

I thought that these were really good with the only complaint being that the rolls really sucked up the sauce. I added about a half cup of both of the sauces and still there was almost nothing. The filling was also a little dry but tasty as well. Next time might add a sauce to the filling or just try adding even more to the top and bottom. Or I guess might try making it as a traditional lasagna.

Everyone thought this was delicious!  Excellent twist on regular lasagna.  The only changes I made was to use fresh spinach and diced baby bella mushrooms.  I already have requests to make it again.

Did add a little white wine as mentioned in other reviews. Everyone LOVED it, even those who don't like spinach and mushrooms. Amazing and looks great for serving company.

This was worth the time and effort.  We didn't use chicken though and instead used ground beef.  I also used Italian seasoning and lots of garlic.  I wanted to cook the mushrooms and spinach in white wine like someone else suggested but I forgot - next time!

Very good - the only thing holding me back from rating it a 5 star is my agreement with other reviewers that it needs even more sauce than is called for.  I was skeptical to even add as much as I did, but the rolls just SUCKED up every last bit of the sauce. I'd add 1/2 cup of each (red and white) to ensure it's a bit more juicy!  Otherwise, YUMMY!
