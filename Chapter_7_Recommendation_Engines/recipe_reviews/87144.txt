This is a GREAT sandwich! The only alterations that I made are: I grilled my chicken breasts (I used very thin chicken breasts), I used fresh dill and no butter. I also let the chicken cool completely before adding it to the sandwich.Then I wrapped them, and packed them for my picnic! Really fresh and delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you SO much for such a terrific recipe!

Wonderful chicken sandwich - perfect for lunch! The amount of garlic you use is a matter of personal preference so use the amount you like. I love garlic and dill and think it's a great combination. I eyeballed the amounts and I grilled mine vs. pan frying. I used thin cut chicken breasts that I rubbed with a bit of olive oil, minced garlic and dill. I put a little kosher salt on my tomato slices before assembling my sandwich using kaiser rolls that I toasted unger the broiler. This was so good with a dill pickle and a glass of iced tea!

Four tablespoons of minced garlic? I cut the garlic WAY down, to just one big clove, minced. Even still, hubs and I had garlic mouth the rest of the night. I made these as wraps, spreading the cream cheese mixture over the tortillas, then wrapping with shredded rostisserie chicken breasts and the lettuce and tomato.  With these changes I'd rate this as four stars--as written with the amount of garlic called for I think I'm being generous rating it with three.

This is a divine chicken sandwich anytime of the year!  The only thing I did different was to serve it on Baker's Inn Hearty Potato with Grain bread instead of French bread.  I felt the sandwich deserved a bread with a little more punch and it was heavenly!  Thanks Meezergirl1.

Very, very good! I tweaked it a bit...I cut down on the garlic, due to previous reviewer comments. I sliced the chicken into strips and added onions and green pepper to the chicken while it was sauteeing. I used marble rye bread and added fresh sliced cucumbers to the sandwich. I served it with corn on the cob. Thank you for a nice summertime recipe!

I ha to cheat and tell my husband what was in these after he tried them, but they were great. We cheated and used whole grain sub rolls which we toasted on the flat grill. It was a perfect summer day out and this worked great with a glass of sweet tea. The leftovers were great as well. What a treat. You'd never guess it was cream cheese spread.

I really liked how this turned out.  I was intrigued even though it is wintertime now.....and I am glad I tried this.  Hubby said that this was really good (which is a compliment).  I loved the way the cream cheese complimented the chicken.  I did dredge the chicken in a little flour and didn't have any tomato.  We also used a Sara Lee bakery bun instead of the french bread (it was what we had on hand).  Delicious and will be making again.  Thanks for the post.

This was good.  We grilled the chicken, which I think makes this taste better than if it were pan fried.  My husband thought it was missing something, I thought it tasted very good.  We had a lot of the cream cheese mixture left over for some reason.  Will probably make again, maybe add another spice in there.

I actually would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  My husband liked it, but I thought it was just OK.  Seemed to be missing something and left an odd aftertaste.  I probably will not make it again - if so, I will grill the chicken instead pan-frying.

these are just exceptional! i love doing sandwiches as summer meals because they are so easy to prepare, you don't have to heat up the whole oven, and you can easily eat them on picnic blankets in the backyard (where our summer dinners are most often held!)  i left the sauce off for the kids who are soo picky, but i thought the flavor was simple and great.  thanks!

When making chicken, I always start with making it on the bone.  The resulting breast turns out far more moist and delicious.  I roast it in the oven with olive oil sprinkled over it and without the butter, of which I am not in favor.  Then I extract the breast meat off the bone.  I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much exactly after that and it was simply great.  Since I do not like turkey and don't eat much red meat, I am constantly looking for inventive chicken sandwich recipes.  Plus, it makes great use of my garden tomatoes.

Cream cheese spread was good once the garlic was reduced to one clove. 4tbs of minced garlic is comparable to 12 cloves of garlic. I really think that's a typo, or so I hope!

We love garlic, but wow, there's a bit too much in this recipe.  We'll just tone it down a bit next time.

The concept for this sandwich is great BUT 4tbsp of garlic? Are you sure? I cut the garlic to 4tsp and it still overpowered the taste of the dill. I will make it again and cut the garlic down to 2tsp. Also, my husband suggested using basil instead of the dill...sounds good to me!

I forgot to grill the bread, and used snow pea shoots instead of lettuce but I don't think it changed the recipe dramatically. This was really very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Lovely summery sandwich.  I, too, like chicken breasts cooked bone-in - much more flavour than boneless breasts.  I usually poach them in a small amount of apple juice, water or chicken stock, depending on what I have on hand.  Cool the breasts and meat will easily come away from the bone.  I vary the herbed cream cheese.  Since I have an abundance of basil, I make basil cream cheese since basil EVERYTHING as it's my favourite fresh herb.  This sandwich is a snap to make when you have a several cooked chicken breasts in the fridge/freezer.  Thanks for the inspired combination.

This was a great sandwich! i chose not to season the chicken with the garlic and dill due to others saying it was to strong of garlic flavor.  The cream cheese mixture was delicious especially with the toasted bread, unbelievably delicious cant wait to try this again!

It was tasty, but the recipe called for way too much cream cheese mixture.  I cut that part in half and still had a lot left over.

Really good and easy to prepare. It's nice not to have to marinate chicken all day and still have a great tasting meal. Next time I'll squeeze a little lemon juice in the cream cheese for an extra boost of summer flavor.

This sandwich was a typical chicken sandwich with a spread to spice it up. I did enjoy the cream cheese dill spread, however I think it would be better on a cracker than on a chicken sandwich. As for the sandwich, I grilled the chicken as mentioned in the recipe as an alternative method, and after seeing the grill marks on the bread, decided to grill the bread as well. I felt two slices of bread after being grilled was just too much. Too toasty. I think a lightly warmed bun or roll would have been a better choice. As I said before, the spread was a little weird. I think a slice of Swiss and some smashed avocado would have worked out better for a summertime sandwich. I will keep the cream cheese spread recipe for my crackers though. Seems like a nice twist to a traditional cheese ball.

Fantastic flavor!! We also adjusted the garlic. 2 teaspoons in the cream cheese spread and then we just dusted the chicken with some garlic powder before frying it. Contrary to what man others said, we loved the flavor and moistness of pan frying the chicken in butter!

I made the recipe exactly as directed. There was definitely too much raw garlic and not enough salt, pepper or other seasoning in the cream cheese spread.  It was still yummy, but I will  make a few changes to make it a keeper. Thanks for the great idea, though!

If you use a good sturdy bread, a good whole grain, or a good sourdough, you can make it panini style..I suggest using fresh spinach leaves in place of the lettuce if you do make it a panini. Or maybe Kale, as it is sturdier than lettuce and can take the heat. I have a cast iron panini press, but I have also used my George Forman grill to make panini's.

I made this recipe as directed, I always try the recipe before changing anything. My wife and I were delighted in the flavor combination. It's a goto recipe for us.

I used 8oz fat free cream cheese and a little olive oil instead of butter and 2 breast and 4 thighs. The dill was WAY overwhelming even with the cream cheese doubled and the chicken increased. I happen to be a garlic fan so it was only a little overpowering. For me, not worth trying to adjust for another go round. sorry.

LOVE THIS! And so did the husband :) He went on and on about how delicious it was so this is a definite keeper! Made it with leftover chicken that was on hand but looking forward to making it with pan fried chicken breasts, my mouth is watering thinking about it!

I made this last night via cooking the breasts on a cast iron skillet after tenderizing and seasoning them (I also added some salt).  I served the breasts with the sauce (cut back a little on the garlic in the sauce), bacon, tomatoes, lettuce and smoked provolone (only after trying the sandwich with only the tomatoes and lettuce).  They were okay, nothing that I'd put on weekly rotation but good for every now and then for a change.

This was delicious! I did use a little less garlic than suggested. The spread of cream cheese, dill weed, and garlic is so good! Easy and great recipe for a summer lunch or dinner.

This is absolutely delicious. The spread is so good that I actually started cutting off slices of bread and dipping it into the spread. I used a chicken substitute but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yummy!!

Yum! I took others' advice and rubbed thin chicken breasts with olive oil, minced garlic and dill, then grilled it. I used a 7-grain bread, buttered on one side and thrown on the grill for a few minutes while the chicken was cooling. I did cut down on the garlic to about 1-1/2 teaspoons between the chicken and the cream cheese spread. I only used about 3 teaspoons of dill total (I find a little goes a long way). Overall, fantastic recipe; I wouldn't have thought to put these ingredients together. Thanks!

This was a good sandwich! my family loves garlic and this was the perfect amount. I used Dill seeds instead of dill weed (i bought the wrong thing by accident) but it worked out well. i used about a teaspoon and a half of the seeds with an 8 oz package of the cream cheese. Thank for the recipe!

Delicious!  I used fresh grated garlic and fresh dill instead of dried.  I also used French rolls instead of regular bread.  Followed recipe exactly otherwise.  This is a KEEPER!

I shouldn't be rating this since I used ready made garlic/dill cream cheese and alfafa sprouts instead of lettuce but I think this is a great base recipe. Incredibly fresh and healthy, perfect for a light lunch!

It was great thank you, I did add the garlic to my liking though.  And I seasoned my chicken with salt n pepper, Cajun seasoning,  lil garlic, and some dill. (While cooking)  Then I topped it with provolone cheese added the sauce on top while the wheat toast was cooking on the one side.  I then added the mixed cream cheese mixture to bread and voila... Lettuce and avocado was my FAVORITE on this.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really delicious!  It is all about the sauce!  I used dry dill since I didn't have fresh on hand and some whole grain buns for the same reason, but we were delighted with these sandwiches!  I've also made the sauce subbing greek yogurt for the cream cheese and it was just as delicious in my opinion!  This is definitely a keeper and something different for my recipes collection.

Very good recipe!  I did cut back on the garlic (3 cloves in 8 oz cream cheese, and 3 cloves in butter for 6 servings), because not everyone likes it as much as me, and it was plenty strong!  Also, I grilled the chicken instead of frying - I creamed the garlic and dill into the butter, and spread over the chicken before grilling.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Most of us really liked this recipe.  My one son did not like the dill but the rest of us enjoyed it.  It was a little hard to eat and a little too greasy (next time I will cut down on the butter) but overall we really enjoyed. I did cut the garlic down even though we love garlic but I think it would have been a little overwhelming.  Thanks

I thought this was a really good sandwich, although there was way too much raw garlic in the spread for my taste.  I cut it in half and it was still pretty hot with a strong garlic taste.  I grilled the chicken and grilled Amish White Bread slices (from this site) to make the bread crunchy.  Will make again but with much less garlic.  Also, there was enough spread for 3-4 sandwiches.

Pretty good, the bread was greasy/maybe a little soggy. We used fresh garlic and it was quite strong garlic flavor- 4tbs is a lot of garlic!!  
We grilled the chicken, and I pounded it out first to make it tender and thinner/easier to eat.
Overall it was pretty good, but probably won't make it again.

My hubby and I loved this recipe. Super easy and tasty! We loved the way the dill complemented the chicken.

This was pretty good.  To save fat and calories, I only used 3 oz. of Neufchatel instead of 4 oz. of regular cream cheese.  I used ciabatta rolls from Wild Oats- they were the pefect size and did not get soggy at all.  These are filling, even though I used pretty small chicken breasts.  We had these for dinner with fruit and Italian tangerine sodas.  Avocado on the side would have been nice.  :)

Not too bad. The cream cheese made the bread soggy, and the dill flavor was a little weird for us. I think that was just a personal preference, though. This recipe could probably be tweaked to fit our tastes.

This chicken sandwich is absolutely de-lish!  This is my 2nd summer to use this recipe.  It is a little messy, but the taste is worth it.  My husband eats his with our homegrown yellow tomatoes.  The colors, textures, and tastes of this sandwich remind me of a fancy restaurant sandwich.  Thank you MEEZ!
