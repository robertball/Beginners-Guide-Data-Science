My husband said this was his favorite thing I've ever made, it was absolutely delicious!
I paired it with cilantro rice, and the only change I made was using coconut oil instead of grapeseed.

The flavors are amazing and worked great served over rice. Make sure the peanut butter is well incorporated.

My son loved it. Just enough heat. I poured it over Jasmine rice. Made enough for two helpings plus a snack.
