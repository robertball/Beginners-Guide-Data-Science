I try to eat healthy & yummy, but on a budget its tough. Great just like this, but then I halved the mayo and cheese, threw in a can of tuna and put it on whole wheat. WOW! This is my new tuna salad. And I can't wait to make more variations on it!

I've made this salad alot down through the years. Celery is a nice addition to it. Other cheeses are also great in it. Cheddar, feta. Use what you have.

Yum! I used frozen peas, thawed. I needed low fat so I left out the cheese and egg and used only 1 Tbs. of mayo with 2 Tbs. of plain yogurt, seasoned with a little Old Bay. Threw in a can of tuna too.

This salad is great! Unfortunately I didn't have any pickle relish, but I didn't really miss it. This wasn't too terribly spicy... just enough spice for me. If you think of the heat of the salad in terms of salsa grade spiciness, I'd say this is medium. What a great alternative to the ordinary picnic salads! The sweetness of the peas really compliments the spice of the pepper.

This is fantastic!  The only thing I did different is to add quite a bit of chopped dill pickle instead of the relish.

I really love this. I wanted to make for my lunches so I added a can of chicken. I left out the onion and used red pepper. I used frozen peas and that worked great. I also used cheddar cheese. Can do just about anything to make it your own. A really great recipe.

I haven eaten a canned pea since I moved away from my parents' house when I was 19, and I wasn't about to revisit them, so I used a one-pound bag of frozed peas, thawed, instead.  This didn't seem particularly spicy to us, maybe my jalapeno was abnormally mild even though I didn't take the seeds and membrane out of it.  I used a combination of reduced fat mayo and fat free sour cream and did not add any cheese only to keep the weight watchers points down.  I cut up a big ol' kosher dill pickle instead of using relish, and I hesitated about putting in the egg, but compromised and used two hard boiled egg whites (I fed the yolks to the cats).  We loved the combination of flavors, but next time I'll make sure my jalapeno has some punch.  Thanks so much for the post, Shunpr!

I’m revising my review that I posted earlier today.  We had this for lunch, it had not yet totally chilled down, and it was watery.  After sitting in the fridge for probably 5 hours, it had totally firmed up, and tasted a heck of a lot better.  Most likely, still won’t make it again, but in all fairness, it’s better than how I initially reviewed & rated it.  When the recipe author says it needs to chill for 2  hours (at least), it REALLY does.

Great Salad!!  Not being a fan of pickle relish, the second time I made this I omitted that and the egg (although the egg was tasty in it).  I added some chopped red bell pepper as another reviewer suggested and, wanting to cut down on the fat, eliminated the cheese.  Instead, i made a dressing of 1/2 mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream and added some chili powder, chipotle hot sauce and just a dab of dijon mustard.  Next time I may put the egg back in or add some black beans to it, but it was delish!  Thanks for such a versatile recipe!

I made this to take to my parents house for a BBQ. I love spicy food, and did not find it very spicy; just had a kick to it. However, my dad said it was the best pea salad he had ever had.

These were a HUGE hit for the spicy food lovers in the family! I used a 16 oz bag of frozen peas, thawed, & didn't add the relish. I kept everything else the same.

This is an easy recipe to prepare and very tasty.  I made the dish a second time and used petite frozen peas.  We thought it had a fresher taste and was much better than using canned peas.

This was pretty good...not spicy at all though, I even doubled the Jalapeno and it still was not spicy. However it is a very nice recipe.

A serious crowd-pleaser! Has that 'vintage charm' but tastes surprisingly new.
