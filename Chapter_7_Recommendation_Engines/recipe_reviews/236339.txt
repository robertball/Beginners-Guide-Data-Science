Kabobs are kind of a no-brainer. What makes this recipe great is the marinade. I used Aidell brand chicken and apple sausage and a stove-top grill pan. I also used cherry tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes because I think they stay on the skewer better. The sage in the marinade makes this smell great when it is grilling. I can't wait until Summer so I can show this recipe off on the grill to my friends.

I made the recipe as written and thought it turned out great. I used chicken sausage with apple and gouda and just basted during grilling. I served it with jasmine rice and a salad. I'll make it again for sure.

I made no changes to the ingredients but did adjust the preparation and cooking methods.  After making the marinade, I mixed part of the marinade with all of the kabob ingredients in a mixing bowl.  I preheated my grill basket on my barbecue grill and dumped the contents of the mixing bowl into my grill basket.  Saves a ton of prep time.  I left the rest of the marinade available for people to add to their meat, veggies, and rice. A new family favorite.

Delicious! Made this exactly as written and the whole family loved it. We had it for dinner on a hot summer day and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I used a Caribbean Jerk marinade! I marinated them for about 25 minutes and then baked them for about 20 minutes in the oven at 425 degrees. Perfect!!

These were very good. Marinade tasted great but made way too much and mine was too thin.

These were wonderful!  The tomatoes didn't work too well but the rest was amazing.  Will, surely, make again.

I didn't make the sauce/marinade for these kabobs, but they were good even without the sauce! Next time I will try them with the sauce.

We loved this!!  For the kabob marinade I thought it was kind of weird to have big chunks in it, so I threw it all in a blender and blended it up, and I think I probably worked better than the original, but who knows!  Didn't have grape tomatoes so I just wedged up regular tomatoes and skewered them on and hoped for the best.  They worked great :)  Also used yellow onion instead of purple, that's what I had!  In the end it was well received and loved, thanks!
