I actually diced up the celery and mixed with other ingredients... using as a spread on crackers. thank you for posting and providing a delicious way for me to add celery (not my fave) to my diet.

Great appetizer/snack. I made a double batch of the spread for weekday lunches. In desperation, due to forgetting the lemon, I added a little juice from a jar of sliced jalape√±os for a little acid. Turned out great!
