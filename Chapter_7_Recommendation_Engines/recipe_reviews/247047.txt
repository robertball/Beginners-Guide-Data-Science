I really liked this. It was so simple, fast, and filling. The only downside is it is a tad salty. I would not add extra salt and rinse the beans well. This would be good, as suggested, with a basic salad and even some fresh cooked corn tortillas on the side. I followed the recipe exactly only softening onions and peppers, in a bit of vegetable oil, before adding ground meat. I also garnished with fresh chopped tomatoes. ty

Very good!  Had trouble finding the Knorr's rice side dish, just added a frozen rice and veggie side.  Quick easy dinner!

My family enjoyed this. I used plain brown rice and red and yellow pepper instead of green. Served with all our regular taco fixings...sour cream, salsa, lettuce, tomatoes.

I used multi-colored bell peppers and I added some spice to it - cayenne pepper - mainly because I love cayenne pepper and spice. Otherwise, I made it exactly.  I see the picture has tomatoes.  That's be a nice fresh touch.

I loved it..  changed it a bit.  Made a Mexican rice and used ground turkey instead.  Sautéd onions and peppers first, added seasoning to onion mixture.  Sauté ground turkey with half can of refried beans.  Spread rice on bottom of dish, Mixed my meat mixture with my onion mixture.  Spread on top of rice and grated cheese on top with sliced jalapeños and green onion.  Baked for 20 mins in 350 oven

This was very good.  I did add some pepper jack cheese to the cheddar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served this with tortillas, sour cream, salsa, chopped tomato, lettuce, and green onion.  I received no complaints.
