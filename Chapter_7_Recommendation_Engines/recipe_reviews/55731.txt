I used regular mushrooms and I didn't have any Sherry so I used an extra cup of beef broth.  The soup was really good and definitely one I'll make again.

I think that the recipe calls for too much sherry. I'm not sure if I'll try this recipe again but if I do, I may try 1/2 cup.  Overall it is very salty.
