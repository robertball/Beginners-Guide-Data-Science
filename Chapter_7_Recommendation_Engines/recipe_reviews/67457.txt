I really dislike the texture of pureed soups, so I skipped that part. I omitted the saffron because it's a bit pricey. I also had to cut the pepper garlic sauce and fish sauce because I couldn't find them. I didn't simmer for quite so long because I didn't want the vegetables to get soft. Everything else I kept the same though and WOW! It's a very thin soup, but with the rice it's quite filling and sooooo delicious! oh the flavors are just fantastic, and we didn't miss the meat at all. It's a fantastic main dish all by itself. The coconut milk is slightly sweet, which balances out the peppers and ginger.  Absolutely wonderful, and I definitely plan to make it again.

Edit: stll haven't gotten the garlic sauce, but did get some fish sauce. would definitely recommend NOT using the amt listed in the recipe. fish sauce is ridiculously potent and a little goes a long way. 3tbsp is obscene. 1 tbsp is more than enough, maybe even too much.

I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 for a couple of reasons and please keep in mind that I followed the recipe to a T down to the saffron. My first reason is that it is an extremely costly soup to make and didn't have the "wow" factor that something so pricey should have had in my opinion. Secondly because I think the ginger overpowered the other ingredients for the most part. I did blend it in batches as the recipe called for but didn't blend what would be considered the last batch and I actually enjoyed it more. The blended dispersed the flavors a little better but the non-blended looked much more appealing and you could taste the individual flavors better. All in all good recipe (blended or not) if you scaled down on the ginger and like coconut based soups so I am giving it a 4.

This recipe is delicious and very spicy. The only trouble is, unless you buy pre-chopped vegetables and ginger, the prep time is more like 45 minutes.  It's well worth the effort.  We added chicken that had been sauteed in Thai garlic sauce and will probably double the rice next time.

Excellent and super easy!  I sometimes make it with chicken broth instead of veggie and  always use broth in place of the wine. This soup freezes well.

Pretty good.  I missed out the fish sauce (we're vegetarian) and broccoli, and added pak choi & baby sweetcorn.  Also, I didn't liquidise.  I grated the lemon grass on a very fine grater.  Good strong well developed flavours.

Absolutely delicious! I left out the garlic and pepper sauce and increased the quantities of veggies. Great for getting vegetables into those who turn their noses up. Like a thick and morish green thai curry sauce so would be great on chicken, beef or prawns. I'm really impressed with this.

This was delicious.  A little too spicy.  I would recommend either the chile pepper OR the pepper garlic sauce, not both.  Like others, I did not blend the soup, but that might be worth trying in the future.  I skipped the saffron and added the juice of half of a lime since I thought it was missing a little something.

This was a great tasting recipe. I couldn't find saffron nor the thai pepper garlic sauce nor the thai chilies but the soup turned out great regardless.

This was perfect after a weekend of over indulgence.  It's quite filling without being heavy.    
I left out the saffron but added in some kaffir lime leaves while it simmered and removed them before I pureed it.  I agree that it would be great with the addition of almost any kind of meat.  Will absolutely be making it again

This is a fantastic soup recipe.  I added eggplant from my garden and lemongrass from my garden.  I cooked a whole chicken and used the stock and meat.  I did not puree the soup. I added sliced mushrooms and left out the sour cream and cilantro.  My husband and kids loved it, too.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!  Can't wait to make it again.
Sincerely,
A mom from Pennsylvania

This is a good recipe. I didn't really like it as a soup though. i threw in chicken and a bunch of vegetables and served it over rice. It was just to thin in my opinion. Lots of interesting flavors though.

This recipe was phenomenal. Very adaptable--I didn't have any lemon grass, and I substituted mushrooms and potatoes in place of the broccoli and carrots. It basically tastes like red Thai curry, just a little more soup-like--it's delicious. Can't wait to make this again.

Yum!  My boyfriend and I both couldn't stop raving about this recipe!  I only changed the recipe a little; I only used 2 chili peppers, I subsituted the bell pepper with three celery stalks, replaced lemon grass with a tsp lemon juice, and couldn't find my fish sauce or chili garlic sauce (oh, roommates...) and used about half a cup of cilantro.  It was a fabulous bread dipper!

Great recipe! I have a hard time following recipes as written.  I omitted Thai peppers and garlic pepper sauce during cooking and offered garlic pepper sauce while serving. I chopped lemongrass in 2-3 inch pieces so it was easy to remove when serving. I omitted rice, saffron, and added more veggies, cabbage, green beans, mushrooms. I also forgot to garnish with yogurt and cilantro. My fam and I really love it. The veggies got overlooked so next time I might wait to add them until broth is simmering and will only cook for 10 min.  If you like Thai flavors, make this!

this recipe is very good.  It's kind of light and very filling at the same time.  It is quite spicy so if you don't like that i'd reduce the chili peppers.  Also i subbed the lemon grass (didn't have any) for lemon zest.  I pureed about half of it to retain some texture and everyone in  my family really enjoyed it!

Have made this recipe several times. Halfed the rice and made it with chicken as well as following the recipe exactly as is. Doubled carrots and used spinach rather than broccoli. I like the spinance better than broccoli, too. Used sour cream instead of plain yogurt everytime. Used the juice of one lemon b/c didn't have lemon grass. Yum! Not a fan of cilantro, so never used it.

Excellent!  I had some leftover veggies and rice and found it a wonderful way to re-invent them.  As for the negative reviews, one has to like Thai cooking in order to like the soup.  It's all a matter of taste.

Since this was my first time I mostly followed the recipe.  It was delicious!  I used a jalapeño because I couldn't find Thai chiles. I used the immersion blender rather than putting it in the blender. Hubby and I both loved it and will add it to our list for Sunday Soup Night

I found this recipe when I was trying to find a good recipe for a soup to use my leftover Fire Cider immune tonic vegetables. I used vegetables from my Fire Cider (ginger, horseradish, onion, turmeric, burdock root, garlic, orange zest, rosemary, jalepeno and cayenne pepper fermented in apple cider vinegar for a month) along with everything else plus mung bean sprouts except the red pepper, chiles, saffron (expensive) fish sauce,and yogurt (to keep it vegan). It was a tangy,spicy delicious treat to my tastebuds and I was happy to find something to make with the leftover fermented veggies! Yvonne Naturopathic med student

This recipe depends a lot on your taste, so you must play with it. Personally, I thought that 1/2 cup of dry wine and 2 tbs of fish sauce was enough. I added a full package of diced firm tofu. I did not do the rice part because I prefer rice noodles. You can replace (although not as good) lemon grass with a full lemon zest.
