I left out the sour cream and used pecans instead of walnuts. This was a very good spin on turkey salad. The cranberries make this, wouldn't recommend leaving them out. Diced apples would also be a great addition to this recipe! Thanx!

I thought this was excellent!!!  I only used 1 tablespoon of parsley and added more sour cream.  I also didnt use all of the dressing, i wisked the dressings and spices together first and only added enough to coat the salad.  I thought it tasted out of this world and I would definetly make this again!!!! I have also used chicken instead of turkey and it tastes just as good!

Fabulous! This is a wonderful salad and a great way to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I LOVE dried cranberries so this salad was right up my alley. I also added some chopped apples to give it a little more sweetness. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream. I also opted to use a little curry powder vs. rosemary and parsley. I'm a huge fan of rosemary, but for this salad I felt the curry powder just paired better. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours and after sneaking a few bites - WOW, what a wonderful combination of flavors! This was so good on whole grain bread - thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  I added a couple teaspoons of good dijon mustard.  Also used a bit less mayo and more low-fat sour cream - probably half and half.

This could really benefit from some finely diced onion.  The rosemary didn't really seem to fit with this salad - I would leave that out.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and they great.  With a few adjustments this is a great use of leftover turkey.

Great recipe- though I did change it a bit to resemble a cape cod salad from Costco. I didnt add parsley or rosemary. I added some honey and used pecans instead of walnuts. It tastes great!

I've made this twice without the rosemary just because I didn't have it.  We both love it.

I don't use the sour cream or rosemary, but I also add at least 1 cup of grapes halved and 2 apples. Sometimes I add a tbsp of red onion.

This recipe is also delicious with cooked chicken and toasted pecans  yum!  Have substituted grapes for the cranberries also.

I have also made this using a bottled dressing of Honey Mustard Yogurt - something new i found put out by  Bolthouse Farms (something new to me). Delish!!!
