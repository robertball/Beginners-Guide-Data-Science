Great recipe.  I used 4 oz of green chilies instead of jalapeno peppers.  When I make it again, I will use a little more Worcestershire sauce.

I made this (just for me) yesterday for lunch. I replaced the jalapeno's with canned chili peppers and used refried beans instead of the chili beans. This was a really tasty and satisfying treat. Thanks Jessie!

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  Die-hard meat eaters just scarfed this recipe down.  I added mushrooms in for a little added texture and melted the cheese on top by placing the skillet in the oven.  But, this recipe will be made again and again (and, if you are a meat eater, you could easily throw a little meat in there, too).

Yummy, fun & bean-ey way to fancy up a typical butter/cheese/baked potato. I just found the Worcestshire flavor to be a little odd. Otherwise, the beans w/ sauteed veggies, plus grated cheese and green onions perched atop a fluffy baked potato, was very good and something that I'd fix again. Incidentally, I scrubbed the potatoes, rubbed them in EVOO, sprinked them w/ sea salt and baked at 400 for 45-50 min. b/c we LOVE to eat our potato skins crispy w/ Texas Pete hot sauce!

WOW! I think the bean topping could have been enough for 6 or 8 potatoes! BUT it was good! I omitted the jalapenos and when the potatoes were done and split, I drizzled a little melted butter over them first, followed by the bean mix, then the cheese (which I then melted in the microwave for a few min) and then a dollop of sour cream. Very good potatoes and a good twist to the old basic baked spud! Thanks!

Really good. I used 6 potatoes since mine were sort of small, and used a can of diced green chiles instead of jalepenos. I didn't have quite enough green pepper, but with the extra green chiles, it evened out fine. I used lactose-free cheddar/jack mix and regular Worcestershire. We had a little extra bean mix and my husband made it into a sandwich later.

Really good, filling, and easy.  I didn't use jalapenos since I have a 2y/o, but got chili that had red & green chiles in it.  Next time I'd like to add some spices and see how it turns out.

I really enjoyed this.  To make it low cholesterol we used light sour cream on top with veggie cheddar cheese.  Yummy!

I like this recipe because I normally have these ingredients, but it offers a different taste to my normal uses for them.   I made this with fries because I didn't have potatoes at the time.  It is amazing!

Quick and filling meal.  We used 8 med-sized white potatoes.  Not very spicy and could use more seasonings too.  But it was an interesting change, and I'd make this dish again.

I did not really care for these potatoes.  I think the reason was I like the taste of baked potatoes and I felt this recipe was trying to cover the taste of the potato...

Our family liked this a lot.  My husband doesn't like baked potatoes so I fried them instead, and put the chili sauce on them like a topping.  I also don't think I'll put the Worcestershire in next time.

Awesome recipe!  We sometimes boil the potatoes instead of baking them.  It is faster and the potatoes aren't as dry.  We then treat them like baked potatoes.

This recipe is definately a keeper. It was missing a little bit of spice; kind of bland tasting to me. My husband thought it was perfect. I will make this again, but may add some chili powder or other spices.
