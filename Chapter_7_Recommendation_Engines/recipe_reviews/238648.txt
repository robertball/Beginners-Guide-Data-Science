Oh yeah, this is a good one.  I make a lot of breakfast smoothies, and it's been a while since I've rated one 5 stars, but this one is deserving.  I just eyeballed the ice and added a bit too much, so I did need to thin it out a bit.  I had some coconut milk in the fridge, so I used that which added even more flavor to this smoothie.  Garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and some lime zest.  This is a keeper!

Not my favorite! Too icy and I donâ€™t taste the key lime as much as I would have liked to!

Yes definitely will make again.  on top added one piece graham cracker and little lite whip- taste just like key lime pie.  I used Chobani greek key lime yogurt so it was more like ice cream than a smoothie at first.
