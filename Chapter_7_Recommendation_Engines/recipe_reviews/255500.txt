While leftover Halloween candy doesn't tend to be a normal occurrence in our house, I can imagine wanting to look for a way to use it up should the situation arise.  I made these cookies with Kit Kat bars and wasn't terribly impressed.  They were edible but not really enjoyable.  The texture was edible but dry, the flavor wasn't spectacular.  Possibly using a candy bar with more moisture (something with caramel or nougat?) might remedy the issue.  All in all I can think of a lot things I'd rather do with a candy bar.

Be sure to use a double boiler to melt the candy bars. I almost used a saucepan on direct heat, and almost had a burnt on disaster!
