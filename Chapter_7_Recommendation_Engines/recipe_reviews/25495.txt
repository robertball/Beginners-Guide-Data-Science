Have brought this dish several times to parties.  It is always the first to go!  Make sure mushrooms are browned well before refrigeration.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! But, the one replacement I would recommend making:  Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil.  That's it!  Great recipe!  Thanks, Jean!  AND my sister used this recipe for a party, and got rave reviews!

Delicious. The only change I made was I added 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of the 1 tablespoon called for in the recipe. My family really enjoys these mushrooms and I made them again today to go with orange-roasted pork loin and mashed potatoes. Thank you Kathleen!

I made this to take to lunch at a friend's house. Everyone just raved about it, and several people asked for the recipe.  I used half of the sugar called for in the recipe, and it seemed to be just right.  The mushrooms also took a lot more than 5 minutes to brown.  Thanks for sharing this one--it was great.

This was a super-simple recipe and made a great appetizer.  I chose to use a garlic & herb dressing mix instead of the italian.  I also added a bit more garlic than was called for.  Everyone loved them and thought I had really worked hard on them!

Were o.k. Made for my Dad's 50th birthday.  Had a lot of mushroom lovers there and I still took some home.  Not a good sign.  Thanks anyway.

Funtastic and extremely easy to make. My boyfriend loved these. I added less oil and more vinegar and would recommend to keep the mushrooms in the fridge for a couple of days before serving for more vinegary taste.

Very, very good.  I doubled the recipe and it made way too much marinade.  Next time I'll just double the mushrooms.  The marinade didn't go to waste though -- soaked some chicken in it and it was fabulous!  Definitely a keeper!

I made these for a party and they were wonderful.  I made them then let them sit in the marinade overnight.  I also used less sugar.  I would definitely do these again.

I use a package of ranch dressing mix. If wanting to serve these warm use a crockpot and some extra butter let it sit on high for one hour and on low for another one to two hours these are great warm.

This is a good addition to an antipasto or appetizer tray. I don't think the mushrooms need to be sauteed before marinating, I've done it both ways and prefer to marinate them raw. Just use a small button size and marinate at least 8 hours. One clove of garlic is plenty for my taste!

Oh my!!! These are delicious.  I made a couple different recipes for marinated mushrooms and this was the BEST!!!!  I prepared them for a party but had to make another batch because I couldn't stop munching on them when they were done.  Soooooo good!!!

The longer you marinate them, the better.  I recommend at least 24 hours.

Basically, this recipe is marinading mushrooms in Italian salad dressing. It's a bit oily, and I was not very impressed. I also thought that more than 2 tablespoons of butter was necessary to saute 16 oz. of mushrooms (I made to serve 12).

I was trying to duplicate these really wonderfull marinated mushrooms I had at a local resteraunt. I found this recipe hoping that it would be close but it turned out really bad I'm not sure what I did wrong I followed it to a T except I couldn't find the tarragon vinegar so I used white vinegar maybe that was the problem? The garlic was really strong and I love garlic. I think I'll just keep looking.

I personally don't like mushrooms, but brought these to a BBQ. People seemed to like them, although I still took home quite a few. Thanks for the recipe.

These are very good.  I could see the whole mushroom sitting on a platter of appys with toothpicks in them.  Making them several days ahead would make it even more desirable.  I'm using the leftover dressing to add to other things---including cooked rice!   I love tarragon and garlic!  Thanks for the recipe!   EDIT:  I am changing my rating to a 5 star because as these sit, they become VERY wonderful!  I would absolutely make these two days at least in advance!

These are very good! The longer they sit, the better they get. The marinade is a lot for 2 (8 oz) packages of mushrooms. I see others commented about using it to marinade other things, so that's probably what I'll do, because I hate waste.

I used white wine vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, EVOO instead of vegetable oil and I cut the oil amount back by half. The family liked these okay, I thought they were VERY good. I swear, I could have eaten the whole bowl myself.
