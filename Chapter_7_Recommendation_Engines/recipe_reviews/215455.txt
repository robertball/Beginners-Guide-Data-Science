I added sauteed carrots, celery, and onion to the soup, and it turned out to be delicious. It's a very hardy pot pie that I would make again. It's so easy!

It definitely tasted like soup with stuff.  We missed the onion and garlic.  The broccoli soup was off putting.  If I made it again I would use two cans of cream of chicken soup.
