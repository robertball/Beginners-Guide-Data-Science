I thought this was really good, but I'm a cabbage lover, especially if it's in the raw. I had to omit the carrots due to allergies, used dijon mustard instead of the seeds and added my own seasonings. Yummy Kimber!

We really enjoyed this. I made it as written and thought it was a little heavy on the oil and light on the vinegar for me - easy enough to adjust. I loved the way the veggies wilted a little when the warm dressing was tossed in. The caraway and mustardseed are delightful, but don't make this salad if you don't like them (duh). Thanks for the recipe!

Really tastey, I suggest more caraway and more vinegar. Make sure you cut the cabbage very fine so that the hot oil going on top is the most dramatic. :D

This was OK. I didn't think it had enough flavor.

Made this last night.  Didn't bother heating the dressing because I like my coleslaw crunchy.  Just threw everything together and placed in the fridge for a couple hours.  Worked out well.  I did double the vinegar as others suggested  it wasn't vinegary enough.   Had left overs and tried the next day and it was even better.

This was good, but I thought it would be much more flavorful and exciting. It didn't taste much different than regular coleslaw.
