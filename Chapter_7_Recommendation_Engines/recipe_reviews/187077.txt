I served this with bread cubes and it was pretty good. May use a little more bacon, horseradish and hot sauce next time or lessen the sour cream if I don't need as much.

I did not enjoy this dip at all.  I love horseradish and hot sauce but this dip definitely lacked flavor.  I think it would be better served to use 8 oz cream cheese instead of 16 oz. sour cream.  I would definitely not try this dip again.
