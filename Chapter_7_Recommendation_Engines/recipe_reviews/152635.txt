I went with the assumption that if a famous chocolate company is going to put out a recipe, they're going to make sure it's a good one to promote their product. My assumption was correct - these are just fantastic cookies and the recipe itself is flawless. I used old-fashioned oats rather than quick, which provided a bit more texture. I substituted M&M's for the chocolate chunks (sorry Baker's) and they provided a little crisp bite. These are not too peanut buttery, but just enough. Not too oatmeal cookie-like, but just just enough. Soft, yet crispy, and light as air. Just a fantastic blend of oatmeal, peanut butter and chocolate that makes this cookie stand apart. I used a medium sized cookie scoop, flattened them just slightly on the cookie sheet, and placed extra M&M's on the top before baking.  Pretty to look at and even better to eat, this is one  cookie recipe that goes to the top of my recipe heap!

For a finer consistancy, I ran my old fashioned oats through the blender before I used them in this recipe. I used a name-brand super chunk peanut butter and half of a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I did bake my cookies at 350 for just under 10 minutes. They turned out chewy but a little underdone which made them also soft. My family all LOVED this cookie recipe. Next time, I will double the recipe right off.

Yummy!  Followed the recipe but made a couple of additions with a tsp of cinnamon and chopped pecans.  I did use chocolate chips instead of the chunks.  I will definitely make these again.

These are excellent!  The recipe makes really chewy cookies that do not spread much on the cookie sheet.  I will definitely make these again!

Extremely soft and chewy!  The only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  A big hit with the husband.

Excellent--they came out dense and chewy--not crunchy--which is how I like them!  The only thing I changed was how much chocolate I used--recipe calls for 6 oz, I used 4 and it was plenty. 12 minutes in the oven then pretty much straight onto some wax paper to cool, and they were perfection!!!

Absolutely delicious with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor!  I used four squares of chocolate vs. six and these baked up perfectly in ten minutes - even the cookie dough is irresistable!

Awesome recipe! Husband couldn't stop eating the cookie dough and then devoured the cookies. I doubled the recipes because my husband wanted to take a batch to work. Everyone loved them. I still have people asking me for the recipe. I used dark chocolate chips instead of the chunks and I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of the smooth. They were great!

Very good and very easy!  I used chocolate chips instead of chopping a semi-sweet bar, and for what it's worth I used natural peanut butter (the kind that is just peanuts and salt).  They came out great!

I followed some of the advice from the other reviews and used less chocolate than called for, these cookies turned out great! They are moist but hold shape well and have just enough peanut butter so they are not overwhelming. These were a definite hit with my boyfriend and his friends. The only thing I would do differently next time is I might use just a little less oats and see how they turn out. Overall a fantastic recipe I think everyone should try!

These were really amazing.  This is a very chewy cookie which I love.  I put 4 oz of chocolate instead of the 6 that the recipe called for and it was still plenty of chocolate.  I will definately be making these again!!

This cookie recipe is BEAUTIFUL. If you change anything, change only the type of chocolate you use. I used chocolate chips because that's the only thing I had. When you bake it, keep checking it after 9 minutes. You only need the very tips of the cookies to be lightly brown. Do not wait till the whole cookie is brown, or you'll end up with a hard, crunchy cookie. For my oven, 11 minutes is just right. The peaks on the cookies were barely golden brown and the bottoms were medium golden brown, and if they look SLIGHTLY undercooked at this time, take them out. They keep cooking slightly after you remove them from the oven.  My husband doesn't usually like peanut butter cookies. But these are the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate, and they are so chewy on the inside while a bit crispy on the outside. He ate most of the batch before they were completely cooled! Perfect. Recipe.

Delicious!  I ran out of vanilla so I used 1 tbsp of creme de cacao.  I also used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the chunks.

Really good, perfect mix of all my fav cookies.  I also just used choclate chips.  The fist batch went a little flat, so I added bit more flour and cooked at 350 instead of 375.  Even better

These are delicious, but here are a few suggestions to make them even better.  First, instead of dropping the cookies by spoonful, I shape the dough into golf-sized balls with my hands and put them in the freezer to solidify a bit. That way the cookies spread less than my first batch which I just dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet.    I also found that the cookies burn on the bottom before the 10 minute baking time is up. This could be just due to my oven, but to overcome the problem, I placed the cookie sheet on the top shelf of my oven and baked only 10 minutes... 12 minutes was too much for my cookies.   Also, make sure that you do keep the cookies 2 inches apart as the recipe suggests, as they do spread.   Delicious recipe – thank you!

After trying many, many oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipes, I found this one which is even better for my peanut butter-loving boyfriend.  They are absolutely amazing!!! They're totally chewy - exactly how we wanted them. I used normal semi-sweet chocolate chips, which works just fine, and reduced the cooking time, per other reviewers' recommendations, down to about 9 minutes to ensure chewy-ness. I've made them twice in the last 2 weeks, and will be making a double batch this weekend!

One word "addictive", don't make these unless you have extreme self control.  I am not a big sweet eater, but my son and I made these today and I can't stop grabbing at them.  Followed the recipe exactly, but flatten the cookies a tiny bit before baking and turned the oven temp down a tad because they seemed to cook a little too fast. I hope I can avoid eating them all, so I can share them at work tomorrow.

Yum, yum, yum!  Awesome cookies.  Super moist and soft.  Only 1 substitution, I used 4 ounces chocolate CHIPS, and 2 ounces peanut butter chips instead of the bakers semisweet chunks.  Perfect cookie!

So good! I made these for a neighbor as a get well present and my husband stole the first batch! One thing I truly don't like is page after page of people putting in their two cents about how they change this and that about the recipe. If its that much changed, submit a new recipe. But thing that was out of my hands was the fact that two stores were out of bakers chocolate. I had no choice. I had to buy two bars of hersheys special dark. The large bars state 4.25oz, but they weigh on my scale 3oz a piece. Chopped coarse and added in place of bakers brand chocolate it was amazing. If you have no choice or have nothing else thats a good sub. Don't use milk chocolate!

Love this simple recipe - I use it so often, I almost have it memorized! I usually add a tablespoon of nutella (or two!) to the dough and swirl it around. 

I also take these out just a little on the early side and they stay wonderfully chewy and delicious!

I'm getting closer and closer to the best cookie ever.  This one was one of the best I have ever made.  My only problem was my choice of chocolate.  I used some strange premium chocolate I found at the grocery store.  I think it was dark instead of semi-sweet.  I love dark chocolate but NOT in this recipe.  If I had left out the chocolate I really think they would have been perfect.  Excellent flavor; excellent texture, and so pretty!

After seeing these recommended on the Recipe Exchange I made them yesterday and they will probably be my favorite cookie recipe from now on. I used the large-sized Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bars cut into chunks. I like my cookies soft and chewy and was surprised to find that these really did require 10 minutes cooking time. But after baking for 10 minutes and leaving them on the sheet pans for another 3-5 minutes, they are perfect! I will definately be making them again and again. I will be interested to try them using chunky peanut butter for extra texture.

The cookies are very good; however the batter looked a bit dry so I added another 1/4 c. of peanut butter. I baked the first batch 375, but they almost burned on the bottom, so I reduced the temp to 350 and baked an additional minute. I also deleted the chocolate chunks and added white and dark chocolate chips, they came out great. Enjoy!

Made 4 dozen for a cookie exchange at work.  They were a hit!  Perfectly chewy.  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chunks just to mix things up a bit.  They tasted great!  I cooked about a dozen at a time on wax paper, about 9 minutes was perfect

WoW!  This is a super yummy cookie.  It is soft and chewy in the middle and a little crispy around the edges.  Peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate-what more could you want?  I followed the directions but I only baked mine at 350.

Really good and easy!  I think I might like the flavors separately, though, so that is why it only got 4 stars from me.

I couldn't keep out of the cookie dough!  The actual cookies turned out great too-the peanut butter made the difference.  I did use chocolate chips, but everything else was exactly as the recipe states.  Only flattened a little.

These were good cookies, but a little crunchy for my taste.  I'd also put more chocolate in next time, but I was a little confused on that piece since it said 6 squares (6 oz.), but in my chocolate bars it said that 6 oz were equal to 12 squares.  I went with the lesser amount, which was probably my mistake right off the bat!  What was I thinking?!

My Husband NEVER eats sweets.  I can't keep him out of these cookies!  They really are one of the best cookies we've ever had!  My kids love them too!  Definately will make these again!  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe!  It was perfect!

These are great!!  I woun't use another chocolate chip recipe.  I did modify as i try to bake healthier.  I used organic pure cane sugar, substitued butter for 1/3cup Healthy Balance spread and 1/3 cup organic apple sauce.  I also added about 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and 2/3-1 cup of chopped walnuts.  These have to be some of the best cookies ever!!

We tried baking these for our school baking class, especially because it takes only about 30 minutes. Our group was the only one who actually baked our cookies, others got from 3-step boxes. We had the yummiest cookies too! We didn't use Baker's chocolate because we didn't have any (but it still tasted great!) and we used large choco chips(NOT a good idea) The big choco chips made our cookies really sweet. I will bake these again when I have the chance, this time I'll use mini choco chips. GREAT recipe! :)

Made two adjustments and that was I only had four squares of Baker's semi-sweet left, so I just used that instead of the 6 squares suggested and I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy. Excellent cookie. Made one inch cookie dough scoops and flattened slightly. They had a great shape, not all flat some like cookies. Family enjoyed this "all in one" cookie. Thanks!

great cookie recipe. the combination of peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate is a winner. i use about a cup of chocolate chips instead of the baking chocolate and it turns out fine. made this recipe a few times and these tasty cookies always disappear fast!

I am baking these as I type.  Awesome.  I had a lot of extra Baker's chocolate left over from Christmas and this was the perfect use for it.  I added an extra spoonful of peanut butter, and I cooked the first batch at 350 for 12 minutes. I am trying the second batch at 375.  These wont last long!!

I used this as a Christmas cookie recipe, with both chocolate chunks and red and green m&m's.  I added cinnamon to taste and replaced butter with Crisco, and they turned out wonderfully. The dough is easy to manage and they slide ride off the pan out of the oven.  I made four different kinds of Christmas cookies this year, and these were my husband's favorite.  I had to make one batch for our Christmas party and a separate batch just for us!

Make sure you use "BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate" not just regular Bakers chocolate folks! Of course the cookies would be gross with PLAIN bakers chocolate!! ;)

I made these cookies a couple of weeks ago because i was in the mood for a good chocolate chip cookie but i was sorry i wasted the time. The cookies were dry and had no flavor. The baking chocolate you are suppossed to use made the cookies taste horrible! If i were to make these again i would use semi sweet chocolate chips instead. Also the recipe tells u to bake to cookies for 10-12 minutes..i only baked my first pan for 8 minutes and they burnt. Don't waste your time with this cookie, there's definately better recipies out there!

These cookies were fantastic and easy to make. When they came out of the oven they seemed about to fall apart so I put them back in for a couple minutes more. . .mistake! these cookies are almost liquid when done. just make sure to cool completely and you will be surprised with chewy, light cookies with the perfect amount of peanut butter taste. i used brown sugar and wheat flour with semi-sweet chips. delicious!

These are perfect cookies!  They're very moist, chewy, and not too sweet.  Since I have a  3-month old baby, I really appreciate recipes that are quick and simple, like this one!  I altered the recipe by using whole wheat flour (because that's all I had in my cupboard) and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also doubled the recipe, and I'm so glad that I did because these cookies are yummy!  Doubling the recipe made 3 dozen medium sized cookies!  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate!  What a delicious combo!

well received by my family and friends, these are moist and chewy. i added a little less sugar and used 4 oz chocolate chips. next time i'd probably use a little more peanut butter and chocolate, as i'd like the taste of peanut butter to be stronger. My first batch turned out a little too soft, the second just nice so maybe i preheated the oven too late. A little greasy though.

These.Cookies.Are.Amazing.  best cookie recipe on this site!  The ingredient portions are perfect, the oven temp and time are right on, and the cookies come out delicious.  Only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon for a slightly diff. flavor.

Hands down, the BEST cookie recipe I've made in recent memory. Made exactly as listed except I substituted 1.5 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate chunks. Absolutely delicious and will DEFINITELY make them again and again, and again! THANK YOU Baker's!

Very good cookies.  I added too much chocolate chips though and couldn't really taste the peanut butter.  Next time I'll measure!

These cookies are amazing! Just the right amount of each flavor - oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate - makes an absolutely perfect combination! I used chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make these again!

Just got done baking these, and they are great! Great texture, don't spread too much, no need to squish down, and they taste good. I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be perfect just as is.

These are spectacular! For those who want to make them slightly healthier, I used all whole wheat flour, and I can't imagine them being any tender and delicious than they were.

I found these to be quite good.  I wanted to take the easy way and just use chocolate chips, but I felt disloyal as Baker's was the one providing me with the recipe! So, I did end up using their squares and I found the chocolate to be a bit overwhelming. It made it hard to taste the peanut butter. If I make again, I will reduce the chocolate a bit and maybe add a little more peanut butter. Also, I found these tasted much better the next day.

When feeling the need for cookies I usually go for the staple chocolate-chip variety but saw this and had just enough peanut butter left to dive in. I must say I got really excited because the dough was AMAZING, I probably ate too much. Then I threw a sheet in the oven and watched them carefully (I have a tendency to over-cook cookies, who knows why). At about 11 minutes the cookies were definitely not done, at 12-13 the were WAY too crispy on top. We'll see how they are tomorrow, hopefully chewy enough. Still taste good, but not the amazing cookies I thought they'd turn into, maybe they'll be better next time.

Very, very good. I would suggest cutting back on the white sugar to 1/4c. You will find that it makes no difference in your enjoyment of the cookie, but will make you feel as though you have done something healthy. Well, it certainly did for me. I would also recommend no more than 10mins in the oven. This will now be my go to Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookie. My sons (15 & 24) loved them.

These were delicious! Mine spread just fine. I was worried about how wet and sticky the dough was, but I didn't add any extra flour. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!

Really, really tasty! I used 1/2 cup chips and 1/2(ish) cup mini-chips.  I also used 1/2 cup of walnuts, old fashioned oats and wheat flour. Make sure to press these down to the consistency you want - they don't spread.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - yummy!

WOOOOOOOOOOW  they were scrumptious  , I think it`s my vaforite recipe from allrecipes. I used quick oats , 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate  and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.some times I found out that coconut is a great addition it goes really well with the PB(I used creamy PB) and the chocolate . I bake them in dark non stick sheet set the oven on 325 it takes only 7-8 mins to get done (I like mine very chewy ) if I waited longer I'll get a burned bottom , so be very careful when you bake them it's better to stay in the kitchen while baking them

Just made these with my kids...ate one warm out of the oven...delish!  I used regular chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand...didn't change anything else...but did under bake them a bit (a min or two) because I don't like crunchy cookies...I prefer them to be soft and chewy.

I made these today just to try out our new gas range to see if they would come out an even golden brown.  We really liked them and I sent some over to our neighbor.  They liked them so much she asked for the recipe.  This is a keeper.

YUM!!! Especially out of the oven... I made them to send to coworkers--I kept eating so I had to put in the ziploc bags even when they were still slightly warm. Pathetic. They traveled really well and still tasted fresh after two days of being in the mail. Love chocolate chunks--so much chocolatey goodness in every bite!

I just finished making these awesome cookies, they are fantastic! I tripled the recipe and I followed the recipe almost exactly as instructed, I used milk chocolate chips, only because that's all I had around. I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scooper and plopped them on the sheet without pressing them down at all, they baked beautifully!  I baked them for 13 minutes and left them cooling on the baking sheet for at least 5 minutes first before moving them onto a rack. This ensured that my cookies would not fall apart on the rack (which happened with the first batch), or during transfer. Thanks for the yummy recipe, my family loved it!

These were really good, hearty cookies. I used crunchy peanut butter and chocolate chips. They were very good, but not as sweet as some other choc chip cookie varities. They are a very interesting addition to classic standbys like choc chip, oatmeal, or pb cookies. I adore all forms of chocolate and cookies, though, and these were great! I took them to work and people ate them up very quickly. One coworker described them as scrumptious!

This is the best recipe for peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten.  They are so easy to make and are not dry.  I added chocolate chips instead of the chopped chocolate and added a little more peanut butter.  Definitely a 5 star recipe!

I made these for my Kickball Team and I can't tell you how good they are. Even my husband who doesn't like oatmeal cookies kept stealing them off the cooling racks. I did add about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture and about 1/4 of a cup more peanut butter (for chewy factor). I didnt have chocolate chips (or bakers) so I chopped up a hershey's bar and it worked wonderfully. GREAT RECEIPE. It will go into the collection that I will actually make again.

These cookies are delicious!  I didn't have any baker's chocolate so I used milk chocolate chips instead and they were still great.

OMG...  munching one of these warm off the cookie sheet right now and it's divine!  I did follow others before me and used chocolate chips.  Also added a little cinnamon (1/2 t) to the batter and it's perfect...  just a hint of spice.  My son helped make these, so that's how easy it is.  Took 12 minutes in my oven for chewy inside and a touch of crunch.  Will definitely make these again.  If it matters to anyone, used Trader Joe's all natural peanut butter.  Got 29 cookies out of this using a heaping tablespoon of dough.

Mmmmmmm!  These cookies are sooooo yummy!  Made them today, and the whole family loves them.  I followed the recipe, but used about half a bag of semi-sweet choc. chips.  Baked for just under 9 minutes.  The cookies are soft and chewy, with just the right combination of oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate.  I'm sure I'll be making them again very soon!

This is an easy and versatile recipe.  I have made it 3 times with different variations.  I always use chips instead b/c I don't usually have the squares on hand.  The 1st time I only had 1/4 cup butter so substituted extra peanut butter to make the rest.  Today I added peanut butter chips to the batter along with the chocolate.  This recipe is definitely one of my cookie staples - a big hit in our house.

AWESOME COOKIE! My husband and I loved them. I did use crunchy peanut butter but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I personally really liked the chunks of chocolate, yet the oatmeal made them feel like they were a bit healthy! I will certainly be using this recipe again soon.

I made these with whole wheat flour and splenda, I think this was my mistake?  (Did NOT over cook them!)  They were like little rocks, albeit delicious ones.

If anyone has any suggestions for my next batch I would greatly apprecite it!

these are really yummy....they are soft & chewy with a slight crispy edge...great flavour, although i did add a bit more chocolate chunks than the receipe called for as we are chocolate lovers in this house! i got about 18 cookies out of the receipe instead of the estimated 30 as stated, they average about 5-7cm each, and that was by using heaped tablespoon as per instruction ....all in all totally worth it and a receipe to treasure

Chewy yet crunchy = Yummylicious
I used chunky peanut butter & baked for 12 minutes and they came out super good. They almost look like they come out of a cookie book when you refrigerate them for a couple of minutes then form medium-big balls and flatten them slightly on the pan! - I'll post piks soon :)

I made this recipe with only one simple change and it was one of the best cookies I've ever made. It has just the right amount of peanut butter so it's not overwhelming. The oats add a wonderful texture and the chips make it ohhh so good. I used 6 oz of Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of the BAKER'S chocolate. I also made mine a bit bigger and cooked for about 12 minutes. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Will definitely make again:)

These are delicious cookies I will be making again! I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the chunks and since I didnt have vanilla threw in a little hazelnut syrup. 
The cookies turn out perfectly shaped, dense and chewy and just plain delicious! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Great cookie!  Mine did turn out pretty crumbly, they were a little hard to manage. I used natural peanut butter, so maybe that was why? Tasted great.

I caught a husband with these cookies. Five years later, still going strong and still make these cookies all the time. Perfect amount of everything! You can use choc chips instead of the chunks, and sometimes I add a little coconut for fun.

These were really good.  Baker's has chocolate chunks in a bag so I used half a bag instead of chopping the chocolate myself and they turned out great.

I want something yummy, but also want to try and make it a little healthier if I can, so I used a white whole wheat flour and cut down the white sugar amount by half and they were delicious! I also used bittersweet, dark choc. chips instead of the semi-sweet.

These are great.  I used nuts, white and dark chocolate chips but otherwise didn't change the recipe at all.  The dough seemed a bit wet prior to baking, but they turned out fluffy.  Will definitely make again!!

Pretty good cookies.  Can't decide whether you want chocolate chip, peanut butter cookies, or oatmeal you can have all three in one.  And, they stayed pretty soft the next day.  Everyone who tried them seemed to like them.

These are scrumptious!!  I filled a 1 c. measuring cup halfway with milk chocolate chips and then the rest of the way with semi-sweet and pb chips.  They are so tender and delicious -- no one single flavor overpowers.  A rounded tablespoon of dough makes a perfect cookie!

I had a ton of oat meal left from making granola so I decided to look for an oatmeal cookie that was different from the usual raisin variety. This fit the bill.

These cookies taste great! It has all the store-made quality that I love: it's chewy, soft, great texture and melts in your mouth! The only things I changed was to melt half of the butter so to make the cookies flatter and chewier, as well, I only chopped 4 squares of chocolate and that was plenty already. Next time I will add some nuts or dried cranberry.

A little on the dry side for me. Great when they were hot, but once cooled, not so impressive.

really good recipe...MAKE SURE to take them out when they start to light/medium brown and let em cool for the right level of chewiness. only thing for my preference could be a lil more peanut butter

Excellent! It was my first time "chunking" chocolate by hand so I will have to find an easier way to do this next time, but the cookies were amazing. They came out so soft and full of flavor I couldn't bake them fast enough! I had to make a second batch because the first batch was gone as soon as they came off of the sheet!

Very good cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and the only change i would make is to use choc. chips instead of the bakers chocolate (i know its a Bakers recipe but the chocolate is too difficult to chop)

Fab! A quick and easy great cookie with the right flavor of all main ingredients. I tried on my boyfriend and a neighbor and they loved as well. They stayed moist when I stored in a ziplock bag for the last 2+ days. I had choc chips on hand so I used those it was fine. I also recommend using parchment paper as with all cookies! I am going to try a half batch with dark choc this weekend...

Good, but not much better than the tollhouse chocolate chip cookie recipe right on the bag.  The addition of the oatmeal makes for a nice texture, but I wasn't wowed like many of the other reviewers.  Still, a tasty cookie.  I'll most likely make these again.

i am no baker, but these cookies are so easy and so yummy. i made them for my husbands xmas party and they were a HUGE hit and everyone wanted the recipe!! i guess you cant go wrong with bakers. i used chocolate chips instead and added walnuts. and if you want good size cookies, you will have to double the recipe, cause it doesnt make what you put in for the serving size.

We agree with previous reviewers too much choc. chunk. What do you expect when the recipe comes from the choc. maker... also our first batch with the oven temp. set at 375' burned in ten minutes oventime..  changed temp. to 350' for second batch and the result was pure bliss.. make sure to have milk handy....

These were good.  I made a double batch and used chocolate chips since that's what I had.  I would have beeen happier with a stronger peanut butter flavor.

This were very dry.  I tried different baking times and temperatures but to no avail.  I think the cookie would benefit from some milk or sour cream in the dough.  I will not be making these again.

I followed this recipe exactly and it failed me. The cookies didn't melt down, they stayed in the "heaping teaspoons" in which they started. and when I picked them up they crumbled and fell apart. This is the only cookie recipe that has gone wrong for me and I'm a pretty avid baker.

I adapted this recipe for my diabetic hubby and they were so good! Whole wheat flour, old fashioned oats, unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter, Splenda in place of the granulated sugar, and dark chocolate chips in place of semi-sweet. Because Splenda can burn, I reduced the temperature to 350.  They were a cakey cookie and didn't spread much on the sheet, so 2" spacing isn't necessary.

Awesome!!! Followed other reviews: substituted 1/2 the butter with applesauce, 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour, and 1 cup butterscotch chips for the chopped chocolate. Will definitely make again!!!

I love these cookies.  My family and friends love these cookies.  My fiance loves these cookies and he's not even a cookie guy!  I have made them 3 times already int he past 2 months and I'm going to back them again for Thanksgiving.    To make them a little healthier, I added 1/2 c. wheat flour with 1/2 c. white.  Sometimes I add a little flax seed meal so I don't feel so bad if I eat more than I should...at least they will have fiber!   I used corse raw sugar one time which made them a little crunchy but good.  I have used unbleached cane sugar the last few times which is finer than the raw. I also used regular choc. chips instead.  Awesome cookies and a hit everywhere I bring them for dessert or just a snack on the go :)

i made these one night because my family was craving something sweet. I wasn't expecting much, but WOW! These are the best cookies I've ever eaten. They have a great texture, have just the right amount of peanut butter taste and they look great too. All night I could hear my family getting up to eat more. My only complaint with this recipe is that they go way too fast!

My oven was too hot, so the cookies were burnt when the first batch came out.  I lowered the temp to 360 F and the second batch came out great.

I was looking for a good cookie recipe and came across this one, read the reviews and all the ones that I read were all good, so I decided to make them, I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was uses , 1 cup chocolate chips, since I had no baking chocolate, I baked them at 375%F, for 10 minutes were perfect, let them cool down and they were delicious, far better than regular chocolate chip cookies, they were crispy, chewy, just enough peanut butter, since I am only 13, these cookies were really easy to make, and I have had problems when trying to mix in the flour, everything mixed together well, I am only looking for something good to bake and these were perfect, I love to bake, and cookies is what I do best, I probally make something twice I week, I read the recipe once and had it memorized, so I will be making these again for sure

These were very good, and turned out perfect.  Just a hint of a peanut butter flavor, which was great since I don't typically care for peanut butter cookies.

Absolutely delicious! I have made them twice already because the first batch went so fast at my work function I didn't get any! The second batch is already gone after my boyfriend and I finished them and I gave a couple to those who wished they had more of the first batch. YUM! I used chocolate and pb chips and used half whole wheat flour with white and applesauce in place of half the butter in second batch. Tasted the same.

These were the ideal combination of a peanut butter cookie and oatmeal cookie. I used chocolate chunks instead of the baking chocolate. I followed one of the suggestions and put a chocolate chunk on top of each cookie.

Wonderful cookies!  My husband loves them.  They are substantial because of the oatmeal, and the peanut butter adds such a wonderful flavor and fullness.

Delicious!! and only a cup of sugar. As others said, its a crunchy, yet soft/moist cookie. The oatmeal makes it crunchy and chewy, definitely satisfying! The chocolate... Well it's chocolate chips!! can't go wrong there. And the peanut butter gives it that wonderful crumbly texture that is held together with the other ingredients. I literally can't say enough good things about this recipe!  We followed the recipe exactly, except used semi-sweet nestle chips (6 ounces). Delish!!
Added many months later- I still make these cookies every month or even every week! I double the recipe, use 3- 1/2 oatmeal, makes it chewier, and they cook for 12-15 minutes, take out when the areas inbetween tan peaks are creamy colored, let sit on cookie sheet for a minute before putting on rack, or they fall apart, but when cooled, is perfect doneness. enjoy!

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! My husband is a chocolate chip cookie lover and was disappointed when I told him these had oatmeal in them UNTIL he tasted his first one.  He loved it and said he understands why it is a five star cookie. Don't change a thing and enjoy!

My cookies turned out a little bit greasy, perhaps because I hand mixed instead of using an electric mixer and used semi sweet chocolate chips.  They were INCREDIBLE after I rolled the dough balls in sweetened coconut and baked as directed.  Chewy, crisp, sweet.  Will make again and again.

While these tasted good, they didn't look very pretty. They stayed in little lumps and were so dark on the bottom, even after just 11 minutes.

These were really easy to make.  They were alright, I tried them again today after sitting overnight and they tasted better to me today then when they came out of the oven.  I used regular semi sweet chocolate chips and the regular rolled oats.  I will probably make these again.

My favorite cookies to bake these days. They seem to always turn out right, and everyone loves them, kids and adults alike. I've received more comments on these cookies than any other, and I'm sure I'll just keep making them until everyone finally gets sick of them!

These were okay.  I used half white flour and half wheat, chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand, and half margarine and half applesauce for the oils.  I'm sure if I'd stuck to the actual recipe, they'd have been better.  As it was, they were only okay.  I think maybe without the peanut butter I may have liked them better.  I prefer oatmeal cookies or peanut butter cookies, not sure I like them combined.

Oh my goodness - this is my new favorite cookie recipe! I've made delicious cookies that looked okay, and I've made beautiful cookies that tasted okay; but this, by far, is the best all-around cookie I've made!  The only changes I made was that I did not "drop" the cookies, but rounded this. All this did was make a more uniform batch of cookies.  I also substituted 1/2 cup semi-sweet choc. chips and 1/2 cup Andes mint chips for the Baker's squares.  YUMMY!!  The is my new favorite cookie recipe, and has the approval of my husband kiddos -- thanks, Baker's!

EXCELLENT! My 3 and 4 year old loved making these. But it was way more fun eating them. Deeeeelisshhh!!! Unlike some reviewers I stuck with the chocolate amount in the recipe though I did use choc chips. Also it seems some people think its necessary to flatten the cookies, I didn't find this to be necessary.

I used chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks. I also baked mine for 9 min to be softer. I thought they didn't have much of a pb taste so next time I'll add more. But overall, a hit.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It had just the right amount of chewiness, peanut-butteriness, and chocolaty flavour. We substituted regular chocolate chips instead of BAKERs squares. This recipe made about 16 cookies.

These cookies tasted amazing, although I left them in for about half the time because I like my cookies chewy. They got too crunchy/burnt on the bottom when left in for 10-12 minutes

These were easy and yummy! I used M&Ms instead of chocolate chunks.  My cookies came out a bit drier than I expected.  I might back down the oven heat next time and see if that helps. This cookie can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up... and that's the best part of it!

These were absolutely amazing! Instead of chocolate chips, i bought Hershey kisses filled with caramel and chopped those up! I also used half of the butter.  I took these to work (it was a double batch) and they were gone in minutes!!

Very yummy!  I made a few changes just to make them a little healthier. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, I added 1 tbsp flax seed, and 2 tbsp wheat germ.  I also used chocolate chips since I did not have any Bakers on hand.

Very, very good cookies and easy to make.  I would probably add a little bit more peanut butter next time to taste it more, but other than that it's all good.  A bit crisp and chewy and the oats add to the texture.  I definitely recommend it!

I don't normally rate recipes but I could not hold myself back from this one. I have made them twice and both times there has not been a single cookie left. These cookies don't spread out so I make them pretty big and thick and under cook them just a little so they stay soft and moist for several days after. There is just enough cookie dough to make 8 big cookies for the family and I put them in for 11 to twelve minutes (if you make them smaller, I would suggest putting them in for 8 or 9 minutes). Great recipe! Definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

These are great-perfect addition to the lunch box.  I made them big, added flaxmeal, whole wheat flour and cut down on the sugars by an eigth of a cup, also used nut only pb.  They were still a little sweet but will cut down a little more of the sugars next time. Oh, and I only had a dark chocolate bar which I chopped up-perfect.

These are my new favorite cookies. Oh my goodness these are delicious. I subbed 1 cup of chocolate chips for the "chunks" and replaced 1/2 of the a/p flour with wheat flour. It's taking all of my willpower to NOT eat them all right now. I made them for my kids lunchboxes and after school snacks...hope they last long enough...

This cookie is really good!  It combined my hubby's three favorite cookies into one!  I didn't have any baking chocolate, but substituted what I had on hand (peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips and mini chocolate chips). The recipe was very easy.  Thanks BAKER's!

Yummy! I really enjoyed snacking on these. They really are light! Perfect amount of peanut butter and chocolate. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips since I didn't have chunks on hand. They baked up just right and mine came out slightly crumbly but great nonetheless. I will make these again. Thanks!

I just realized I forgot to review these from a couple of weeks ago.  These were AMAZING!  The ONLY slight problem I had was the dough being too crumbly and hard to keep together.  I had to cook them a little longer to hold there shape and not fall apart.  Besides that these were VERY good!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't love these.  They came out pretty dense and coarse.  The taste was nice, but the texture really didn't do anything for me.

These are Amazing.  I added 1/2oz each of wheat germ and oat bran and they came out wonderful and even more healthy.  I also reduced the white sugar by 1/2cup.  Thnks for the recipe.  They'll be great in the kids lunches.

Made these just a minute ago - just ate the first one warm from the oven... mmmm...!! Great peanut butter flavor but not over powering. I made them with wheat flower and reduced fat PB, I also used about 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of PB chips instead of the baking chocolate squares. They really hold their shape when baking, the first batch I made are all round little balls! :) I squished down the second batch some to a more traditional cookie shape. They are wonderful, and at 11 minutes baked up lightly browned and perfectly soft in the middle. These are great! 7/28/12 update - made these again using Reese's Pieces instead of chocolate chunks and they are the BEST peanut buttery cookies ever!

Fan.Tas.Tic! This is definitely now in my top 3 favorite cookie recipes! The cookies were a breeze to make, and even better to eat. I didn't have choc squares on hand, so I used a half bag of semi-sweet mini chips, and cut up one square of Baker's white chocolate. 10 minutes in the oven was perfect for me. The cookies came out soft, with a touch of crunch around the edges. Perfect!!!

Try this recipe, it is crunchy but soft all at the same time. I had only 2 squares of choc. and a handful of chips so I used both.It is now in my recipe box to add to the Christmas cookie tray.

Oh yum!  Took these to a group of women that I meet with for bible study when I baked the first batch. They couldn't get enough!  I used 4 ounces of semi sweet chocolate chips, because they were on hand. Perfect!

These are without a doubt my new favorite cookies.  My husband hates desserts, but he loved these!  I used half whole wheat flour and chocolate chips instead of chunks, but those are the only changes I made.  These are perfect!

I loved the dough, but they were a bit too chocolaty for my taste.  Next time I will leave out the chocolate.

"Amazing" doesn't even begin to describe how perfectly delicious and wonderful these cookies are. Soft and chewy, with just the right hint of peanut butter without being overwhelming, soft oats, and perfect melty chocolate. I will definitely be making these again.

These are great! My daughter was wanting to make M&M cookies, but I'd already chosen this recipe to try, so I compromised by using I used 1/2 chopped semi sweet Baker's Chocolate (3oz) as called for and 1/2 M&M's (3oz). Otherwise followed instructions to a T. Yum! Very "meaty" cookies :)

Just tried these today, they were a big hit! I had no baking soda at home so used antacid instead. Also i used crsuhed mnm's instead of the chocolate chunks.

I am not a big fan of chocolate chips cookies, but when I made these I thought the cookies were the best I ever tried! However one of my roommate said the cookies were too peanut buttery... I guess not everyone likes peanut butter taste. Will def. make them again. Thank you for the recipe!

Unbelievably good! A perfect cookie! I agree regarding flattening the dough a bit. On my PChef stones, the timing is good at 14 minutes. Mine are going to work as well.

Good cookie - it didn't spread like I thought it would - so after the first tray I flattened the rest with the bottom of a glass.

Some of the best cookies I've made!  My husband loved these.  I did change some things a bit.  I used whole wheat flour, added a couple of tablespoons of milled flaxseed and used white chocolate chips (I had them on hand).  They were fantastic!  I will definitely be making these again!

Great cookies!  I've used salted butter & omitted the salt in the recipe & I've also used light margarine with great results.  I've tried both crunchy & creamy peanut butter -both good.  I usually substitute 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips but next time I think I'll use milk chocolate.  I get about 38 two inch cookies & bake them 12 minutes and they're the perfect consistency.  My husband & the kids love them!

Awesome cookie!  I also make variations of it substituting whole grain flour for the all purpose and adding ground flax seed, the kids even love the variation.  Also, I've never used chocolate chunks, I just use 1 cup chocoltae chips and it works great.

So very simple and tasty.  I had these ready for the oven in 5 minutes flat.  I used 6 oz of semi-sweet chips instead of the chocolate chunks.  My husband told me he would actually prefer the cookie with no chocolate at all- so next time I will try that.  It's only been 20 minutes ago that I made them and 1/2 the recipe is gone!  Tasty!

Delicious! I followed previous reviewers suggestions and only used 4oz of chocolate (Ghiradelli, not Baker's) and it was plenty. The batter seemed stiff to me where the recipe suggested it would be light and fluffy, but the cookies turned out perfectly. I added some black walnuts to a few but don't recommend this. It was too much stuff in just one cookie.

Great recipe! I doubled it to bring to a block party and it worked great.   I also used old fashion chunky peanut butter and used 3 oz choc chips and 3 oz chock chunks, which was plenty even though the recipe calls for twice that. Two thumbs up!!!

Yummy to my Tummy!!  I made a few modifications.  I used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour and used Semi Sweet Chocolate Chips instead of the baker's squares. The dough was so light and fluffy and the cookies were a delight in my mouth. As someone said, just enough of the PB, Oatmeal, and Chocolate- perfect combination of flavor!

They were not as chewy as I would have liked them to be and I even took them out of the oven early to finish cooking a little on the cookie sheet. But everyone who had them seemed to love them!

These turned out great - nice and chewy. I used natural peanut butter which gave it a rich peanut flavor and used half chocolate chunks and half Nestle swirled peanut butter and milk chocolate morsels. Yum!

YUM!  Made this recipe as stated, except just added in 6 oz of milk chocolate chips instead of the bar.  Loved the combo of everything going on in this cookie!  My suggestion to anyone making these would just be to make sure you do not go over the 12 minute baking time because the cookies really crisp up ALOT after baking (at least mine did).  My first batch didn't look like it was done at all and was super mushy in the middle, so I let it go for longer & they are now crunchy today.  OOPS!  In any case, these cookies are awesome!!

I was using a convection oven and air back pans and the cookies turned out a little too flat.  I also used reduced fat PB.  The flavor was good, but so thin for my preference.

Yummy!  I made them without the chocolate chunks/chips by accident.  I moved them out of the reach of my toddler and then forgot about them until the cookies were already in the oven.  Even so, they are absolutely delicious.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose.  Great recipe.

These were really good. I used all whole wheat flour and added about 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the baker's chocolate. Everyone loved them.

This recipe is amazing.  It makes for an incredibly crisp yet chewy cookie.  It could have been a bit sweeter but was still great, overall.

Excellent!

My fav cookie ever! :)

Try using milk chocolate. Makes for a very rich yummy gooey cookie.

These cookies were awesome! My husband loved them, they flew off the plate. I followed the recipe exactly and they were chewy and perfect, not flat like other cookie recipes I've tried. Definitely using this recipe again!!

I think these are good but not terrific.  Be sure not to over bake or they will be crunchy.  They are also NOT a chocolate chip cookie --so don't expect that texture --more like a peanut butter cookie.  Don't think I will make again
