Oh my goodness. You have to love asparagus to love this recipe! Just get out a frying pan. Melt the butter, add breadcrumbs to cover the bottom of the pan, whatever darned seasonings you like, fresh steamed or canned asparagus... flip when the bottom is browned and eat it. Add the cheese if you wish. We love this stuff, and serve it at every holiday!

This was very easy to make, but I thought it was terrible. I went with the previous reviewer and  cut down on the bread crumbs. I have a feeling there is something missing from this recipe. I thought it was a waste of a great vegetable. I will not make this again.

Next time I make this, I will use 1/2 the bread crumbs called for in the recipe.  There were way too many and it overpowered the taste of the asparagus.

REALLY good!  I used probably less than 1/2 the breadcrumbs called for though because I wanted to taste more of the asparagus.  I also omitted the butter and tossed asparagus with small amount olive oil before adding the breadcrumbs.  Turned out great.

We loved this recipe. I served it with grilled steaks.  It was perfect.  I'm sure I used more Parmesan cheese than the recipe called for--but when it comes to cheese, the more the better, right?  One tip--use fresh grated Parmesan.  The stuff in a can doesn't melt well.

I will agree....TOO MANY BREADCRUMBS.  Also, I added some crushed garlic for flavor while cooking.  I do not like asparagus, but husband loves it.  He wasn't a huge fan of this.  Says he likes the "other" way I make it much better.  Guess I will have to keep trying.  Thanks for the post.

I made this pretty much as listed.  I think next time I will cut the spears up and probably put them in olive oil and then in bread crumbs.  This tasted delicious but the crumbs formed a crust that  made you eat it separately from the spears.

Overall, good recipe.  You definitely can cut back on the bread crumbs, probably about half what the recipe calls for.  What I did was I coated each asparagus spear in whipped egg and then rolled it in the bread crumb mixture, just like you would if you were making breaded chicken or fish.  It takes a little more time, but the result is great.  Each spear has a nice coating of the bread crumbs, but you still have the great asparagus taste.

The first time I made it I used the butter and the asparagus came out somewhat mushy.  The second time, I forgot to put the butter in and I cut the asparagus up in smaller bites and it was crispy and crunchy!  Very Excellent!  It's a rave with family and friends!

This recipe was awful. I made it on father's day and almost all of it was left, and my family loves asparagus. They all thought it was missing something. It was way too much bread crumbs and I felt it needed something to moisten the crumbs, like perhaps cream of mushroom soup with a little milk.  What a waste of aspargus!

I made this recipe with a few revisions and it was a hit.  I mixed panko seasoned breadcrumbs with and fresh chopped garlic and parsely the added a little olive oil to barely moisten breadcrumb mixturs.  I added slices of roast red pepper to the asparagus, squeezed some fresh lemon juice & fresh black over the asparagus then covered with breadcrumb mixture. Baked covered as inb the directions. After removing the cover for the last 5 minutes of baking I topped with shaved parmesan/romano cheese until melted & lightly brown.  It was delicious!

it was so disgusting....i followed recipe to the letter....why do they let this terrible stuff onto the website?  I have always had good luck with "allrecipes.com"......if I have to research all the reviews and then come up with a conclusion then it is a waste of time....I might as well refer to an old fashioned cook book

I followed the advice of others and cut the bread crumbs in half but next time I will cut it down even more, to a 1/2 cup of crumbs. The taste was ok but not great. I prefer baking my asparagus with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. I may make this again to see how it comes out with less bread crumbs.

Made a few changes and it turned out great.  I used the good old French's fried onions instead of bread crumbs and just smashed them up first.  And used Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan.  It was great.  The cooking time seems too long, though.  Next time I'll break it to only 20 minutes first.  YUM!!

This was not a good recipe for our favorite spring veggie.  Too many bread crumbs.  It was not very flavorful and worst of all it looked unappetizing. Unfortunately it was unappetizing.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but this dish was inedible.  It was very dry and the cheese and breadcrumbs only mixed together where the butter was.

Not very good in my opinion.  I changed a little based on previous review and used olive oil instead of butter and mixed it up, because of that I gave the recipe a 2 star rating.  I think there is better recipes for asparagus.

We are big fans of steamed asparagus, but I thought we'd try something new.  The flavors in this recipe were too overpowering for our taste.  You could hardly taste the asparagus underneath all the bread crumbs, and I cut back on the bread crumbs.  If you're not an asparagus fan, this recipe might disguise the flavor enough for you.  We'll be sticking to steamed asparagus for now.

I work in a church and the priests loved it. Will use again. The only thing you have to watch is the last 5 min of cooking. The topping will brown fast and crust hard with the cheese.

This was WAY over cooked.  It was like mush.  Unfortunately if you cooked it less the cheese wouldn't cook.  Maybe just cooking it for 10 minutes and then broiling it for 3 - 4 minutes, might be the trick.  But it was almost inedible.  And I only used about 3/4 of a cup of breadcrumbs.

This was a fantastic basic (and easy) recipe. I DID adjust spices/herbs according to my personal tastes. I crumbled up some home-made bread (bread machine) in the bottom, added the asparagus and plenty of cheese on top. I sprinkled some thyme and chives on top of the cheese, along with some salt and 3-4 slivers of butter. To make the "dry-sounding" combination less dry, I heated up 1/2 cup of milk with a chicken-garlic boullion cube, and poured that on top.

My husband and I loved it. So I made it for the church dinner today - it was the Sunday for the bishop's annual visit. I made a bigger casserole version, only adding some bite-sized pieces of deli turkey on top of the asparagus before adding the shredded cheese. Oh, yes. This time I also chopped the asparagus into bite-sized pieces to make it easier for individuals to get "just a taste" if they so wished. Everyone loved it. There was nothing left of it by the time my husband made it through toward the end of the line of people.

Some reviewers and their families didn't like it. But if you go back to read ALL of the reviews, you'll find that opinions are divided. 

If you want to try this easy recipe, add whatever spices/herbs you usually add to veggies, along with some kind of liquid with boullion dissolved in it - with the bread crumbs on the bottom so that they won't be further dried out when baked.

This was alright. I make my own bread crumbs because I just don't use them that often. Got them a bit spicy this time and the kids wouldn't touch it. I might try it again with less spicy bread crumbs, but this didn't inspire awe.

This recipe is TERRIBLE....don't waste your time.  Others were right when they said there were too many bread crumbs so I didn't use the full 2 cups but it was still way too much.  This recipe is very dry and bland.  I even used 6 tbsp of butter and it still was dry.  The only good thing about this recipe is that the asparagus comes out cooked al dente so I was able to scrape off the mounds of bread crumbs and eat it a different way.

I'm not quite sure about this dish...  somehow my bread crumbs and cheese didn't seem to blend well together and my asparagus was limpy, I prefer crispier veges.

My family doesn't care for asparagus, but I love it. They ate this without any complaints and even had some good things to say. I loved it!! I cut back on the amount of bread crumbs and used a fat free butter spray to reduce the fat and calories. Will definitely make this one again.

I don't even like asparagus, and absolutely loved this dish! (I could not get fresh asparagus, so used canned, and shortened the cooking time a little)

I cut back the bread crumbs by 1/2 also..I omitted the butter and tossed the asparagus with oil and then the rest of ingredients..sprinkled with shredded Parmesan cheese! Wonderful! Will definitely make again often!

Unfortunately, not a fan of this recipe.  35 Minutes at 400 degrees seemed much too long to me, so, I cooked it 15 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered and it still seemed a little softer than I normally like it.  We also didn't like the bread crumbs on the asparagus.   We much prefer it with just a little olive oil, salt & pepper, and roasted tender crisp.

absolutely loved this.  I mixed the asparagus with broccoli which was great.  only thing I'd change is I would cook as long... I like a little crunch and I found in the oven that long everything goes to soft.  I can't wait to try this again ^.^

Great alternative to just plain old asparagus.
