Didnâ€™t have mushrooms or artichokes but was looking for portions of the other ingredients for piccata.  This was delish with angel hair for a nice light summer dinner!

Loved this extremely easy and quick recipe!  I did not have artichoke or lemon so added fresh spinach once sauce was completed.  Fresh Parmesan on top and I had a pasta dish better than any restaurant in my area.  Even my meat and potatoes husband loved it!

Easy and tasty! Clean up was super easy too! Healthy attempt, so I used whole wheat pasta and no salt in the water. Lots of flavors from the shrimp, capers, artichoke and lemon. I substituted 1/4 cup clam juice and a hefty sprinkle of Parmesan cheese for the  butter and wine adding 1/2 a lemon squeezed on the plate. The Parmesan helped thicken up the juice/sauce a bit. This is a new staple in my home!

This was soooooo good!.  Only change I made was to increase the servings.  Although there is just the two of us, we have more than enough for an additional meal.  Thank you for providing the recipe for a lovely Valentine's Day meal.

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. The sauce was a little too thin but the flavor was great. Thanks for sharing!
