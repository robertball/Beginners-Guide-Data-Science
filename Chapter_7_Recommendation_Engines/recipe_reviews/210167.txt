This was good but only as good as your sauce and chicken. I didn't have any jarred sauce so I made a marinara and used 3 chicken breasts, I don't know if it was a pound or not. I baked the chicken in the oven instead of grilling it over the coals, which would have made this dish so much better. This was similar to chicken parmesan without all the heavy breading and frying. I enjoyed this dish quite a bit, my husband doesn't care much for red sauces, so of course he didn't like this at all. He suggested next time making an alfredo cream sauce.

Nothing special, but it's easy and quick.  Good for the family, not really for guests ;-)
