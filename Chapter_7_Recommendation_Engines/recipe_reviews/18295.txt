This sounds like a bland version of a traditional Hungarian dish.  We use Hungarian peppers which have a mild flesh but HOT seeds and fiber. {  I recommend these peppers because bell peppers often have a bitter aftertaste} Scraping out the seeds and most fiber gives the dish some tang.  Also, Hungarians use lean pork, not beef, and rice is at least parboiled before being mixed with meat and seasonings.  Minced garlic, salt and pepper, minced parley are also part of the stuffing. Sauce base is tomato juice, as stated, but it is thickened with a roux and sugar is added to reduce acidity - a mild marinara would probably taste good too, but then the flavor would not be authentically Hungarian.

These were great!  Iadded a little italian seasoning and garlic to the filling.  I also cut my peppers in half length wise.  They cook faster, and sometimes a huge stuffed pepper on your plates is just too much.  They cook faster also!  I also cooked mine in the oven at 375 for about an hour.

Very tasty! Added Italian herbs to meat mixture- and then used Marinara sauce watered down a bit instead of the tomato juice. Baked them covered in the oven at 375 for 75 min. Served them with mashed potatoes with some of the sauce over the potatoes. Will make again!

Stuffed peppers are my husbands favorite meal, and he said these peppers are the best he has ever had, better even than the way his mom makes them. He said "Please don't ever try another recipe for stuffed peppers. No recipe can be better. You cannot improve upon perfection"

Fantastic!   Delicious, despite the following changes because of time/materials on hand:
a) Used ground chicken
b) sauteed the onions in a little olive oil, added paprika, then browned the chicken and added more paprika.   Mixed into cooked brown rice and stuffed the peppers.
c) Baked in oven on 375 for 60 minutes, but used tomato sauce instead of juice.  
d) Used low fat sour cream, added 30 minutes before end.
So rich and delicious - the ultimate comfort food, without being too decadent.  I would definitely make this again - and will try the original recipe  too when I have the time/ingredients available, but I think I'd keep the paprika, as it adds such a great flavor.
Thanks!

This recipe was very easy to make!  I used fresh Hungarian yellow peppers from our garden.  They were delicious; my husband is a tough critic and he loved them!  I will definitely use this recipe again. 
Shortcut:  Instead of mixing the sour cream and flour  we just added a dollop of sour cream on top.

Great recipe. I use ground turkey or chicken or vegetarian gound soy. Takes some time to cook, and my kids don't like peppers, but my husband and I really like it

These were really tasty! I used spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and precooked the rice to help cut the cooking time down. Also added a little bit of cheese on top.

A lot of comments on here state that it could use more taste. The reason is that this recipe is missing a very important ingredient. Ground Pork! The meat should consist of 30 to 50% pork. That will make it MUCH better.

Very similar to my Hungarian grandmother's recipe, but hers is much more flavourful and the sauce is thicker. She does not use sour cream in hers, however. The rice should be fully cooked, not just brought to a rolling boil as it may still be a little crunchy even after cooking with the meat mixture in the better. In addition to the salt and pepper, I added paprika. Onions should be finely diced to avoid overly big pieces that may still be crunchy. I used diluted tomato soup instead of tomato juice to try and achieve a sauce with more body. It was still lacking in that and flavour. I may use a regular tomato sauce watered down slightly next time instead. We used green peppers instead of yellow. I baked it in the oven at 350F for 45 minutes; an hour may have been a little better and perhaps a little more rice and definitely more seasonings. But still quite good.

Yum!!  These were well worth the time it took to cook them.  I put them in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and they were perfect.  The only change I think I'd make is making more of a sauce, but they really were delicious the way they were.  I'm just used to a saucier stuffed pepper.

I made this recipe like my mother taught me! My mother had no daughters so she taught me her oldest son to cook. I use 3/4 lbs of ground beef and 1/2 lbs ground pork. I also use a large onion chopped fine. Then too I add 1 T of Hungarian Paprika and chopped pepper tops to the meat and rice mixture. She used tomato juice but I use crushed tomatoes and add 1 T brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato’s. Salt and pepper the inside of the peppers too. I use red and yellow peppers rather than green peppers as they are less bitter.  To me it’s not REAL Hungarian Stuffed Peppers without PAPRIKA!! Otherwise it’s pretty bland!!

This was delicious!!!  The only thing I did different is I added some extra seasoning to the meat mixture and and salt and pepper to the totato juice.  It was really yummy and there were no leftovers!

Great flavors.  Because of time constraints, I cooked this on a high simmer and it was done in 45" with no apparent ill effects.  Added a couple of stuffed potatos as well.

Perfect familiar flavor like my mom made years ago!  So easy to make.  The sour cream adds a most satisfying version of the traditional ones!

Im giving this 5 stars, as I LOVED them.....unfortunately, my husbands sentiments were not the same.  (I knew he disliked stuffed peppers before making them....but, I WANTED them!!) I did add a pinch of basil and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture.  Otherwise, these were perfect as-is!  Satisfied my carving!

Better to use the yellow hungarian peppers. Also where's the paprika, a staple in many hungarian meals. Added the onions as well.

This dish was pretty bland.  It looked really promising, but just didn't deliver!
