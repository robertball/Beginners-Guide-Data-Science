I've made this twice .  It's easy to put together and it's good. I would use Gerard's Caesar dressing and Tysons canned white chicken.

This was yummy! I loved how easy it was to throw together and how it did not get dry, like some of these types of salads do upon sitting in the fridge. I used rotini pasta, but that was my only change. Great flavor and the whole family enjoyed it. I would even make this w/o the chicken if I didn't have any on hand. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is very good.  I added sliced Kalamata olives and sliced grape tomatoes on the top.  I made it with shrimp and home made Caesar dressing.

I made as is, except with rotini spiral pasta.  The pasta to chicken ratio was fine, but I'm glad I had a full bottle of caesar salad dressing, as it needed the whole thing.  I felt it needed more crunch too.  I added more onion and pepper, but wished I had celery on hand.  Last, like so many others have noted, it was a bit bland.  Next time I'll experiment with oregano and other herbs/spices.

With added my added changes .......I'd give a 5 star rating. I made this "as instructed" a couple of months ago.    For me, there was too so much pasta, that it was dry, and you couldn't even taste the onions, peppers, etc.   I salvaged my salad by pulling out a lot of the pasta and adding additional onions, bell pepper,  kalamata olives and additional dressing for taste and moisture.  With these changes.......I'd give a 5 star rating.

Very good salad. My family enjoyed. The only change I made was to use a sweet onion in place of the red. MKR

I made this as written and found this kind of bland.  I added 1/4 teaspoon dried basil to jazz it up and it was better.  Still not what I had hoped for, so sorry for a not so good review.

Not a lot of flavor and we added a lot of garlic granules and a lot of creamy Caesar dressing.  Won't be making this one again.

I was going to make this exactly as the recipe said but the pasta to chicken ratio seemed to be off. I cut the pasta back by a 1/3 and ended up having to use a whole 12oz bottle of dressing because it was to dry. It’s a good starting point for a salad but not a lot of flavor.

I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, and 2 breasts were the perfect amount. Added both red and green peppers. This is a great summertime meal!

This is seriously one of the best pasta salads I’ve ever eaten. I used a regular bottled (12oz) Caesar dressing, not a creamy one and I baked boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

Great summer dinner, used Costco roterseri chicken and red bell pepper instead of green Bell pepper.  Very good
