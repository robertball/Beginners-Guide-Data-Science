These were awesome!  They looked as good as they tasted too.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I would add a little more hot sauce next time, just a personal preference.  Thanks for my new go-to impressive(yet easy!) recipe.  I also left out the capers as I don't care for them.  I have made these with "fake" crab as well, and they are still delicious!

I made this as one of my Christmas appetizers and everyone enjoyed it.  I had trouble with the consistency of the crabmeat, though.  It was very, very wet and watery.  I also added much more horseradish and chili sauce - - it would have been too bland without it.  Thanks Lolo.

These shrimp are really great & spicy. Even when served the next day, there is no loss of flavor or texture.

these were gone within 10 mins!!! everybody loved them and agreed they must be made again, but double batch - at least. I found I needed more horseradish and chili sauce to get a true "deviled" taste.  I steamed the shrimp in a beer/old bay mixture. SUPER! I could have eaten them all myself!!

This was ok, I didn't add as much of the spicy ingredients as the recipe called for because I wasn't sure if all the guests would like it. It was good, but if I make it again I would add all the spice to it, was abit bland without it!

I used half Thai chili sauce and half regular, added much more horse radish and tobasco to taste a bit more nippy. Bought giant prawns and dungeness crab meat from Costco, quite a savings! Made this for a cocktail party and was a huge hit. People took the extras home and said they made a meal of just 3 of them. Excellent (but hard to slice prawns exactly right)

Made these for Christmas and did not go over well.  Flavor not bad, just not worth all the effort to stuff.

Outstanding recipe. Took it to a cocktail party and the only changes were more horseradish and more hot sauce. Everyone loved it!
