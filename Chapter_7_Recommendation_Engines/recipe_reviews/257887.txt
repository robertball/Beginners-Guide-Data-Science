I made this deliciously easy flavorful lunch biscuit recipe. I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage cheddar cheese red bell pepper and onion with the pizza sauce. It was a hit. They were gone as soon as I took them out of the oven.

Tasty lunch biscuits. They are very reminiscent of little pizza bites. Kids will love these. Very easy to make with ingredients that probably everyone has.

Easy to make and good idea for a non sandwich lunch. Added basil oregano and some red pepper just to spice it up a little. Reheats well.

Great way to use leftover ham. Hubs loved these and said they were great for a quick breakfast and that he'd love it if I were to make some more.

A lot more filling than I expected but very good. Have made multiple times for a quick meal on the go.

Tasted great! I made a few modifications. Instead of the biscuit dough, I used the recipe for Sadie's Buttermilk Biscuits (from this website also). I went heavier on the ham, cheese, and pizza sauce also. I LOVE pizza, so that inspired me to be rather heavy-handed with the ham, cheese, and pizza sauce. I will definitely make these again and may get a little more creative with the ingredients.

These turned out great. I recommend that if using "Grand" size biscuits you should use a large muffin pan. Otherwise regular biscuits are better. Less beady. Wonderful idea & easy to make vegetarian.

Super easy, fun, & kid friendly weeknight meal! Followed recipe exactly but also made another batch with pepperoni & mozzarella! Both came out delicious.
