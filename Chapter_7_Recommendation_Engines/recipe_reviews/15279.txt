This is the simplest basic recipe for creme of asparagus and it can be made simpler. I omitted the flour and it still came out delish. Instead of onions I added leaks, which for the most part, I did not puree and these gave the soup some body. I used one leek, almost top to bottom. First I sauteed the leeks in the butter, then added the can of broth and half&half. I used only one can (14 oz.) of chicken broth. Then I steamed the asparagus until then were bright green but still crunchy. I pureed the asparaus (left some for garnish) and mixed in with the broth. Three really basic steps. It fed two adults and three children (ages 6,8,3)with about 1/2 serving left over. I used no other flavoring but what the recipe called  for (and the leeks) and the taste was wonderful. I did not use pepper (kids might not like it.)

This was SO easy and SO delicious!  I took the advice of the previous reviewer and added the Cayenne pepper.  I included it with the asparagus and broth in the first seven minutes.  For those who don't like a kick to their soup - omit.  Otherwise this was great.  I was worried that the asparagus would need to be pureed - don't bother.  Much more taist whole.  Will do this over and over.  Really quick and yummy (also - veggie broth is perfect).

This was the first soup I have ever made from scratch & I thought it tasted great and was very easy to make.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth though because I'm vegetarian. I would reccomend cutting the asparagus up even smaller than reccomened, maybe 1/2 inch pieces.  I also added about 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese. YMMMMM!!!!!

An adequate, basic recipe to use more as a guide or reference tool.  I didn't care for the margarine called for so I used butter.  And, because I wanted a *creamier*  Cream of Asparagus Soup, I used equal measurements of chicken broth and half and half. I don't know creamy this would be if prepared with so little half and half!  I didn't feel all that flour was necessary so I reduced it by nearly half, but because I used a higher proportion of half and half than the recipe directs, I probably didn't need any at all.   I sauteed some minced shallot and garlic before adding the asparagus, then seasoned it lightly with Herbes de Provence to give it another dimension of flavor.  Finally, I pureed the soup, which is different than the recipe directs. The final result was a 5-star soup.

I am sitting here eating this right now & I must say that for as quick and simple as it was, I wouldn't hesitate to serve it for company.  The only things I did different than the recipe were cutting my asparagus into smaller pieces & adding a little dill.

Made this soup first according to the recipe, and it was good. Then I pureed the soup and added 1 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper to spice it up.
If you like your soup a little spicey, you'll love this.

I thought this was quite easy, and very good.  I made a batch for my husband and I, and because I liked it so well, made some for a sick friend.  The only thing I can complain about is that there is NO WAY this recipe feeds 8 people as stated in the recipe.  We had it for supper,and each got a good sized bowl.  I would say if you were having cups of soup instead of bowls, you might feed 4 people.  I served it with crusty bread for a nice supper on a cold day!

Good recipe however I added a few more ingredients for flavour. I also cooked 1/2 a chopped onion and a peeled and chopped potato with the asparagus. I pureed all those veggies however I saved the cooked asparagus tips to re-add texture to the soup. I also used 2 cups of milk as well as the chicken broth. The flour and butter roue was necessary to the richness of the soup. I also added 2 cloved of minced garlic to the cooking veggies and pureed it with the rest. The garlic gave it an extremely good flavour.

Surprisingly tasty and easy.  I used veggie stock like some reviewers, and I added cayenne as suggested by others.  I also added some dill, a tiny tiny bit of nutmeg, and a sprinkle of MSG for good measure.  The dill really perked it up, and a little bit of cayenne went a surprisingly long way.  I was concerned it would be bland, but that was not the case at all.

For an elegant touch, substitute 1/2 cup white wine for part of the chicken broth.  Very, very good and very subtle.  Be certain to puree in food processor.  Save a few tips for garnish.

This soup is GREAT & extremely quick to make! I like mine spicy, so I added a little cayenne pepper & some red pepper flakes. I also used fat free half & half with no adverse effects. Awesome weekday meal.

Mmmmmm  Mmmmmmmm Good!!  : )

This is a good recipe I used it just to get an idea for basic ingredients. I ended up adding garlic, onion and putting them in the blender with the asparagus. I  doubled the half and half. I like my food well seasoned so I never follow what recipes suggest when it comes to salt and pepper. --I also fried bite size pieces of corn tortilla to make chips to top soup along with shredded cheddar cheese (top once on bowl).

I love this recipe! It is deliscious. I added 1/2 white onion and 1 teaspoon curry spice rub because my husband likes a little spice in his life :) I would recommend doubling or tripling the recipe because everyone wanted more plus I would like to freeze it for the winter months. Definitely a keeper!

This was great!  I subbed butter for the margarine and whole milk for the half and half (it was what I had on hand) and left out the salt.  I prefer this as a smooth soup, so I threw the whole batch in the food processor at the end.  Quick and easy!

I'm lactose intolerant and can't really eat any dairy, but I did use some butter and lactose-free milk to replace the half n' half (I'm a little worried about eating the butter!)...but I think this would even be tasty without the milk (I've had asparagus soups without dairy before that were very good, so I'm going to continue experimenting). I also cut the asparagus into smaller pieces and pureed the soup because I was in the mood for it that way, but I did try it before blending and it was good that way too (I liked it better pureed though...also visually appealing with the uniform green color). Also, in addition to cutting off the brownish ends of the asparagus, I used a veggie peeler on the lower half (to take off the first layer and prevent stringiness). Overall, I really like that this is a simple recipe! Not too many fancy ingredients, and tasty!

I halved this recipe and blended the soup  for a smoother consistency. I did have to add extra seasoning as it was a little bland. The servings seem a little bit off - when I halved the recipe it only made 2 servings.

You just can't beat simplicity.  This base recipe is easy, quick to prepare, and other than the fresh asparagus uses standard pantry staples.  I love the fact that it can be jazzed up to suit any palate.  (I added white wine and some cheddar cheese.)  Super recipe, thanks for posting it, Corwynn!

This was a very good quick soup recipe, it was nice to not have to puree the vegetables.  I was worried about there not being enough flavor to the soup without pureeing, but it was very flavorful.  Also crumbled in 3 strips of crispy bacon leftover from breakfast, along with about 3/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar.

This is a great base recipe, but I can't see myself making it without wanting to add to it - at least herbs or spices. This time I added white wine, dill, crab meat, and Old Bay. I can see lots of possibilities with this recipe. I love that it's not blended to smithereens - and the liquid to thickener ratio was right on for me. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a chopped leek; the white part only; also I cut the asparagus into small nibs and pureed in a food processor a last step. Easy recipe came out great!

I tried this but substituted vanilla soy milk & wheat flour for the rue and left out the chicken broth. I used the left overs to add to vermicelli pasta. They were both teerrific.

I made this for five women friends and they all loved it.  I pureed the asparagus after simmering and before adding to the white sauce since I wanted a smooth soup.  I added a little fresh garlic and could have cut back on the salt but it was fine anyway.  Will make this again.

This was good.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and crema instead of half-and-half.  Next time I would puree some of the asparagus and add it to the soup.

Very delicious!  I made a few simple modifications to jazz up a bit:  I chopped a stalk of celery, a clove of garlic, and a small onion and sauteed them along with the asparagus.  Since the half and half was a little too sweet for me, I substituted with cream.  I am going to make again with skim milk to see how that turns out.  I added a little celery salt to taste at the very end.

Easy and delicious.  It took about 15 minutes for the broth to begin to thicken.  I used fat free half & half, and that worked just fine.  I cut the asparagus into tiny bite-sized pieces, and it was good without pureeing, but in the end I did use my immersion blender just a little before serving.  I will make this again, but will use half the amount of salt next time (it was good as written, but will be just as good or better with less salt.)  I might also try a little cayenne as other reviewers have suggested.

This soup was great!!! I didn't have any half-and-half so I used a cup of milk instead...it's probably thinner but still creamy. Also, while I was cooking the asparagus I chopped up onions with it and seasoned with garlic powder. Once in the bowl I topped it with a little shredded cheese....It came out so tasty!!

This was really good. I try to stay pretty true to the recipes and only make minor adjustments. I added a clove of minced garlic, and I pulsed everything in the blender before serving. A delightful dinner on a dreary, windy spring night.

Quick and very tasty soup.  The cut up asparagus made it quite "chunky" for the amount of soup base for me  -- next time, I may cook the asparagus longer and puree, or just mash, some  of it and add it back to pot.  I liked the soup very much -- it's fresh and speedy!  Another thing...no way would I get 8 servings from the recipe.

Delicious and so easy to make. Made with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to be vegetarian-friendly. Next time I may add some shredded carrot for eye appeal. Thanks!

Every time I make this stuff, it's so good I can't believe it.  It has become a monthly event.  I make a few changes.  I use only freshly minced garlic (added in the last few minutes of the asperigus simmer) and fresh squeezed lemon juice, and I up the lemon to half a lemon.  Also, ALWAYS double the recipe!  Freezes great.

Nice and easy. Beautiful green color. I picked this recipe b/c the others were too complicated for my taste. I did substitute one cup of cream of chicken for one cup of broth, just to add a little more cream. And I ran the soup through the food processor, b/c I like smooth textured soups.  One of my new favorites!

Yum,
I had some leftover frozen asparagus and I think it took me less than a half hour to cook.  It was quite tasty and definitely a recipe I will use again.  I didn't have half and half cream, so I add a small amount of sour cream along with the milk and it still turned out fine.
Thanks for the recipe, it was great!

When I looked at this recipe, I thought to myself that it looked more like asparagus gravy than soup, but I figured I'd try it out because it looked pretty easy.  I was right.  This was basically a chicken gravy with asparagus.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted great.  My husband really liked it.  But it was like eating gravy without the mashed potatoes.  I won't make this again for a soup, but I think it would be great tasting over a baked chicken with some mashed potatoes.  I'm going to try it that way next time.

This recipe is great!  Super easy and tastes awesome!  This is the second time that I have made this after trying Asparagus soup in Cuba for the first time.  The first time I pureed it and it was great, this time I got lazy and didn't and it was even better!

Made this soup for a sick friend, she loved it, I thought it tasted like grass.  I don't see kids eating it, looks and smells funny.  In all fairness to the recipe, I used Florida asparagus (poor quality), and with fresh Mich. asparagus, I may have been delighted.

I tweaked it a little. I used butter instead. I cut the asparagus in 1/2" pieces, and boiled them (and a few spears in the pot to steam for garnish remove spears when just steamed) all in some of the broth until WELL done and then used a potato masher on them. I also added a can of diced potatoes at the end to make it more filling and I added crushed red pepper for ZIP!!
YUMMM!!

This was wonderful with the slight changes made by naples34102. I used the butter and fat free half and half with the chicken broth. I omitted the flour as well and pureed the soup.  Creamy and delicious I also added a scant amount of cayenne pepper to the recipe and I will be making this every chance I get:-)  Very filling and flavorful

I made a vegan version, substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth and Tofutti Sour Supreme for the half-and-half.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was a little bland.  I added some chopped onions, garlic powder, and some cayenne pepper as others had suggested.  Yummy and SO quick and easy.

Awesome recipe.  I sauteed onion, garlic and fresh mushrooms in butter and added seasining salt and hungarian paprika.  I mixed this with the flour and added it to the sauteed asparagus.  I also used lemon herb chicken broth and added 6 cups of chicken bouillion and an extra .5 cup of milk (in place of half and half).  This fed the whole family and they loved it.  Also sauteed the asparagus for double the time.

A bit bland but can easily add some flavour be it cayenne or a savory spice.  Really need to cook the asparagus as my batch was a touch undercooked and crunchy.

made this and used veg broth and evaporated milk.  i added a bit of turmeric and cayenne at the end to spice it up. my husband really liked it, and finished his bowl.  he's not normally a big soup fan.  next time i think i will saute some onion and puree part of the asparagus.  i will use a little less flour as well...it was a little on the thick side.  great basic recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I mashed up the asparagus a bit to really get the flavor in there, and added some crumbles of Garlic and Herb Feta cheese before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

VERY simple. Great BASE recipe; needs a lot of tinkering with spices, though, or else it almost tastes like high quality Cambell's. And go light on the salt if you use salted butter/margarine and broth.   I'd say what I ENDED UP with was a 3.5-4 star soup: I sauteed 1/2 a yellow onion and 2 gloves garlic in the butter before adding the flour. I also added some nutmeg and cayenne. I highly recommend throwing the cooked asparagus and 1 cup chicken broth in a blender for about 2 seconds to JUST break it up, yet leave it slightly chunky. I poured it over a multigrain pilaf with a bit of chicken for dinner. I can't wait to see how it survives freezing.   Oh, and it only made 3-4 servings.

I like this recipie alot and I followed it fairly well though I added some minced garlic and 1/2 a cup of white wine and only added 3 cups of broth. I will be using this recipe for a long time!

Excellent flavor - great recipe!  The only change I made was to hit the asparagus with the hand blender because my husband doesn't like "chunky" soup.  Wonderful!!!

Great soup!  I forgot to add the half & half, but I definitely didn't miss it!  I pureed my soup once I blended it together.  I will definitely keep this on my soup rotation!

So simple to make... but so delicious. I pureed it and the texture was velvety smooth. Even my children (7 and 9 yrs old) liked it. 
Thanks!

Good, easy recipe.  This was the first time I had ever made cream of asparagus soup and it turned out great.  I did end up pureeing it in my food processor a little bit, more for aesthetics than anything else, but might try it without doing that next time.  Will definitely make again.

Thought this soup was pretty good.  I did use fat free half and half to save on some fat and calories, and still had good flavor.  I'd probably make this again.

I added garlic, onion, and white pepper, but there still just wasn't any flavor but butter, flour and asparagus.  Good base recipe, but it really needs some doctoring.

Great soup! I steamed the asparagus in a rice cooker for about 8 min. I bought it years ago and never really used it much. Besides the rice, I'm going to try steaming the many types of veggies that are listed in the manual. To think that I was going to donate it! Anyway, I sauteed a small small amount of onion and then added garlic for about a min. Added the chicken broth, the steamed asparagus and also a little cayenne pepper and Herbs de Provence. Just let it cook cooked until it got hot. I did puree it (as I see many others did) in a blender. I found it a little watery, so I mixed a tblsp of corn starch with some water and added that. It did thicken it up nicely. Delicious soup on a cold fall day!

I love this recipe.  It is simple and delicious.  I did make a couple of changes to make it more diet friendly and thicker.  Instead of regular half and half, I used fat-free half & half.  Also, I pureed the asparagus.  I am going to try this again using different vegetables, i.e. mushrooms and/or squash.

I was simple to make and very delicious.  I did not use carrots, but did add on tbsp. of deli mustard (as I do to many such soups) and a few dashed of Goya Sazon seasoning.  I also used an immersion blender.

This recipe was so easy. I had some asparagus that I needed to use. I used my emersion blender to make it creamy.  My son stopped by and tasted the soup. He brought some to take home for him and his fiancée. I’d definitely make it. Again.  I,substituted half,  of the half and half with heavy cream. OMG

Delicious! I did make a few changes and was very pleased.
I added chopped red onion, changed the amounts of liquid to
2 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of half & half, dill, salt, pepper and onion powder. I cooked the asparagus a little longer, but not too soft.
Thank You!

Had fresh Asparagus and wanted to try soup.  Followed recipe except did not puree it.  Like it chunky.  Was wonderful.

Added chicken and black beans to it. Made with some cheese mixed in the broth/milk mix, and added garlic and onion powder. It was good! My husband and I needed something different. I think I would make it again.

Excellent tasting soup.  Made one batch and it was soooo good I'm making a second batch to freeze. The one change that I did make was that I pureed it .

I did add some garlic salt to it  & I also strained it in case it had chunks of onions & celery due to my daughter does not like onions or celery.  All 3 of my kids love this soup & so does my husband.  I will definitely be making more!

This was very simple to make and totally delicious.  I did however use heavy cream instead of half and half and set aside the tips after cooked.  I puréed the soup and then added the cooked tips back.

Added pureed potatoes, onion and zuchinni from the garden. Threw in a few bay leaves. Omitted the flour because of the starch in the potatoes. Perfect!

I followed the recipe as written. However after reading all the reviews, I added the vegetables in the refrigerator that need to be up

I think I am missing a step, it wasn't exactly "cream of" it still had chunks of Asparagus in it.  I will put the asparagus in the food processor first, next time.

This is a delicious and easy soup. The only changes I made were to use veggie broth instead of chicken broth; I mashed up the asparagus a little bit after sauteeing it; and I added a dash of cayenne and a dash of white pepper. My husband and I both loved it and found it very filling. I'll definitely make it again, and would serve it to company.

Very delicious and easy!! I blended the cooked asparagus a bit to make it chunky because I like it that way. I also added a bit of smoked paprika and dill seed powder and it made the flavor pop. Love this recipe.

This soup is so good I made a 2nd. batch 3 days later. Please do not change anything or add anything. Try it and I think you will be glad that you left it as is.
