This is a wonderful, tasty quick recipe.  It is nearly endlessly adaptable to whatever vegetables, meat and cheeses that you happen to have in you pantry. I used a springform pan that was the exact size of the tortillas and it worked great.  I also used ground beef instead of turkey, tex-mex shredded cheese instead of just cheddar and leftover brown rice that I had in the fridge.  Added some finely chopped jalapeno pepper as well.  Yum!!

I made this last night and it was wonderful!!! I substituted "Tostitos Restaurant Style Salsa Con Queso" on the inside layers, reserving the cheddar for the top, and WOW!!! I'm adding this to my regular rotation!

Okay.  I did not like the broccoli flavored rice in it.  That's all I could taste.  I would put spanish rice next time.

My kids loved this.  It is a great way to sneak veggies in their diet, just chop small enough.  They asked for the left overs in their lunch the next day.  We will definately eat this again.

I ended up not having the right size tortillas, but the larger ones work well too.  This was a great dish!
