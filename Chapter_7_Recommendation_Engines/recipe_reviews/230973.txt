My family loves this recipe. To make it a little healthier (and lower in salt), I use ground turkey instead of ground beef, homemade taco seasoning mix, and homemade salsa. I like to make a "taco bar" with bowls full of diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, chopped onion, sliced olives......anything that you would add to a taco to make the meal stretch. There's never any leftovers.

We really liked this recipe. It was easy to make. I made it in an 8x11 glass cake pan. The rolls fit in perfectly and went up on the edges a little which made a real nice crust. Used homemade taco seasoning and salsa. The salsa was rather watery so I simmered it in the ground beef for a while. (Probably had closer to 2 lbs ground beef- didn't measure.) If you like spicy, add some cayenne, I didn't cuz hubby doesn't like real spicy, but I think it would of been good. I pretty much made as is, but I'm sure it could be changed up for variety.

This was a great recipe! I added more vegetables for nutrition value. I cooked the ground meat with onions. Then I added an extra later of green and red peppers! My husband loved it! So easy too!

I just finished making this recipe,  and I received 2 fist bumps,  a kiss,  and a hug from my husband!  LOL He told me to remember this one!  For a wife that works and goes to school this recipe was super easy and quick to make. I only made 2 changes and that was to use ground turkey and since my husband is allergic to tomatoes I didn't use the salsa.  All in all this was a success.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

Used to make this as a special occasion off diet meal when I worked in a group home everyone LOVED it. We always had to make at least two so the next shift (or 2) staff could have some too (otherwise look out at the next staff mtg! LoL.) We used ground turkey and low fat sour cream, kept the portions small, served with salad and fruit for desert so folks could try to stick to doctored ordered caloric intake, even with all that it was huge favorite. This is a great memory lane dish for me & my family enjoys it too.

I was disappointed.  It takes longer to cook than what the recipe said and the bottom was doughy.  If I were to try it again, I'd cook it as the recipe indicates but leave out te dough.  I'd add the dough to the top for the last 10 minutes or so.

Next time I'll pre-cook the bottom crust. I cooked it for at least an hour total(ate some, then reheated in oven) trying to get the crust to not be doughy, but it never happened. I also put another layer of crescent roll dough on top, which most likely improved the dish.

This was very easy to make. Overall it turned out well. I would love to know how to make it so that the crust is flaky or a less soggy. Instead of putting the sour cream in the pie, I served it on the side with chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce. My family enjoyed it.

I made this last night and my family loved this dish ! I pre-baked the crust alone for 7 minutes then added ingredients and baked pie. The pie dished up a little messy,  but tasted great. I added orange bell peppers....yum.

Very easy and classic combination of flavors. I was able to cook it in 25 minutes and the dough came out perfect. Next time I think I will use pizza dough and make it like a taco pizza with some shredded lettuce on top.

I took it out after about 45 minutes to serve and had to put that piece back in because the dough wasn't cooked. left it in for  longer and it still wasn't fully cooked. if I try it again I will probably cook the dough about half way then add the rest of the ingredients. all told, it was in the oven for at least an hour and a half.

I liked this recipe a lot. It used up ingredients I had kicking around including crescent roll dough. I substituted ricotta cheese for sour cream and added a layer of kernel corn. I agree I would bake 40 minutes making sure the dough did not come higher than the rest of the casserole or it might burn. I like the idea of possibly prebaking the bottom crust or poking holes with a fork first.

It tasted more like a chip dip. I would say to bake pie crust 8 minutes before adding contents. If I make it again I will leave out crust and use a tortilla dip.
