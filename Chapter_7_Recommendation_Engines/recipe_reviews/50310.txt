I am not generally a fan of "sweet 'n sour", but this is really good!  Cutting up the meat and dredging it takes some time, but it's worth it!

My husband and I love this recipe! I make it at least two or three times a month, it's our favourite stir-fry meal. The really nice thing about it is that it lends itself well to all kinds of veggies. I've added snow peas, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions, and it always tastes great. A sprinkling of sliced green onions at the table adds a nice fresh touch, or toasted sesame seeds for a nutty flavour. I've served it over rice and udon noodles with equal success. EDIT: I forgot to mention that I always add some cornstarch to the marinade and pour it into the wok to heat for about a minute, it makes a nice sauce for the stir-fry.

Loved this!  I used some broccoli slaw instead of green peppers and less oil. Came out great. Needed a bit more sauce but that was due to me using probably more veggies

We made this in the crockpot--it was DELISH!  I also doubled EVERYTHING in the recipe except for the chili powder--more like 1.5 times the requested amount and then added 1.5 T of cumin.  Very flavorful without being unbearably spicy ( I do like some spice!).  Wrapped in warm flour tortillas with all the toppings. . . you have to try it!

Good recipe, tasted good. The coating didn't seem to really stick well to the pork. The stir fry sauce is really good though.

This recipe is deeelicious.  I used pork already cut in strips for stir fry, and it was very good.  Thanks.

It is tasty as written. If I were to suggest improvements it would be for a stronger flavor- maybe more beef bouillon and/or rice vinegar.

This was ok but we thought it was bland. It needed a little more flavor.

I like this recipe.  It's not too complex for a quick meal.  It doesn't have a ton of flavour but it's great as part of a meal containing multiple dishes.  If you add pepper to the cornstarch you get a bit more pep out of it and I like to use rice vinegar, it gives a lot more flavour and authenticity to the recipe.

I agree with the poster that said it was almost tasteless.  I added garlic chilie paste, a bit of fish sauce, and oyster sauce to the marinade to add flavour.  The pork should be seasoned first before its dredged and fried, and I would also use a tad less water, possibly 2/3.  After the adjustments, it turned out ok....served it with wheat berries instead of rice for a healthier note.
