As written, the coating seemed bland, so I tweaked it some (ok.. a lot, but the original recipe is still a great concept).  After briefly soaking the fish in lemon-water, I dredged the fillets in a mix of 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C cornmeal, a few heaping tbs of grated Parm, ample cayenne and hefty dashes of dill, garlic powder, thyme and salt.  Placed the fish in a broiler pan which was lined with crumpled foil, then misted the fillets with butter spray (no additional fat) to moisten the coating.  Broiled for about 7-8 minutes and the coating browned nicely without drying out the fish.  Thanks for a good 'starter' recipe!

My husband and I really love this recipe.  My favorite part is that it does taste fried and look at the nutrition facts...  how can you go wrong?  Someone mentioned the parmesan broiled recipe and that's fine, but it's also 13 grams of fat versus the 2 you have here.  This is the favorite recipe we've found on this site.  It's very quick and easy to make, although a little messy.  It cooks well and is delicious in our book.  We made it with the dijon glazed carrots and traditional mashed potatoe recipes also on this site.  YUMMY!!  Thanks!

I drizzled olive oil on a foil covered pan (for easy clean up) and a little olive oil on top.  It was crisy and had a nice crust just like fried fish but without the calories and oil!  I added a little old bay seasoning to the bread crumb/corn meal mixture rather than basil, but next time I'll use lemon pepper instead.  My husband said it was better than any fish he'd ever eaten!

This is a very good recipe; it's really crunchy and healthy at the same time. I added a little bit more spices and herbs to the breadcrumbs mixture; little bit more oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and some cajun. I also added some olive oil at the top of each tilapia as I read from one of the reviews, and it came out great. Thanks a lot for this recipe; I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this!  My kids and husband are not seafood fans by any means. Tuna and frozen fish sticks is about as far as they go.  But  my kids said this recipe "tastes like fish sticks".  And it's MUCH healthier for them. They had it with some homemade fat free tartar sauce.  

I didn't have cornmeal, and used only Italian bread crumbs. I didn't use the basil either.  

If I'd had a little lemon, I would have added some lemon juice after I baked it.

For those who found this to be bland, tilapia, by nature, is a very mild fish.  You'll definitely have to add spices if you want this dish to have some punch.  

Thank you for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

This is a surprisingly fried-looking & crunchy fish.  Here's what I did:  1/4t salt, two dashes black pepper, 1/8t cayenne pepper, 1/8t garlic powder, plain (as implied) breadcrumbs.  After coating, I used nonstick spray & drizzled a little olive oil on, too.  I don't know if it made any difference with baking, but when I coat fish (or anything else), if you refrigerate it 30 minutes or more, the coating will stay on better (when pan-frying).  It still lacked "something."  Next time, I'll try 1/2t salt, 1/4t red pepper, a couple dashes black & a little horseradish in with the egg whites.  I'll let ya know ... :)

This recipe was good - but for our taste I definitely had to add some additional seasoning to the breading.  In addition to the basil I added garlic powder, onion powder, and ALOT of old bay seasoning.  I drizzled with a little olive oil and baked for 9 minutes and then broiled for just for a minute or two to crisp the top.   It was really quick and flavorful.  I served with tartar sauce made with light mayo and malt vinegar.

WOW. This was (is) really good.  (I'm eating it now.)  On two filets I used Lawrys Season Salt and the other two I used Nature Seasonings Season Blend.  Both are very good and I'm excited that my family can have that fried fish taste without the fat.

I added a ton of extra seasoning but I still thought this was bland - and really dry too. Try the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan from this site instead. It is MUCH better, and much less messy to make. Thanks anyhoo.

To help crisp it a little better.  Put a cooling rack inside a cookie sheet and then bake it.  It helps the air move all around the fish and won't make one side a little soggy.   Oh and I used some lemon pepper!

This has been my recent "go-to" tilapia recipe...As is, it's a bit bland, but easy to fix with whatever spices you like on fish. Otherwise it's a 5 star recipe. I crinkle foil, place on a cookie sheet, and spray with olive oil. I also spray the coating before baking so it comes out crispy. I've even accidentally mixed the flour with everything else, and had no problems cooking. A new tip I've learned from frying chicken: **letting your coated fish sit for 5-10 minutes will help the coating soak up more moisture and make it extra crispy.**

OMG.... so good!!!! Taste just like fried w/o the guilt. I used panko crumbs and added some garlic and onion powder as well as some salt free seasoning to cornmeal mix. Served with homemade tartar sauce. (light mayo, prepared horseradish, dill relish and dash of lemon juice)

I made this tonight for me and my husband and we both really liked it. I did as others had suggested and added old bay to the fish, the flour and the breading. 
I also put a cooling rack inside the baking sheet and cooked the fish on that so that both sides got crispy. I did turn the fish about halfway through and did a quick broil the last couple of minutes. This was the closest to fried fish without frying that we have ever had. tks for sharing!

This was very good. As written, I think it would be a bit bland. So I added 1 Tbsp. lemon juice to the egg (I just used one whole egg, instead of 2 egg whites), extra salt to the flour and some garlic powder to the cornmeal mixture. I also used Panko breadcrumbs, which made it extra crispy. We ate it plain, but next time I might serve it with some tartar sauce.

This is a nice basic recipe for oven-baked Tilapia. For seasonings I used a dash of paprika and lemon-pepper sprinkled in the bread crumbs. 
Sprayed olive oil on the fish just before baking which helped make it more crispy like fried.

Very good!!!
The fish comes out with a great coating crisp like frying but without the mess and calories. 
The only negative about this recipe is the way the fish looks after its done. Its not brown at all, I think next time I might stick it under the broiler for a minute to brown the fish.
And I also seasoned the fish(with old bay) and let it sit before coating the fish

thanks for sharing

Spray foil with PAM, then after putting prepared fillets on foil spray and then sprinkle with olive oil. Bakes up crispy. I used pancake mix and cornbread mix for ease and put much more seasoning. Really tasty.

Excellent receipe!  My husband and I have cut out eating fried food, so this was perfect!  I am so-o-o tried of eating baked and broiled fish so that when I spotted this I was thrilled.  Like another reviewer, I added garlic powder, onion powder and a little dried adobo to the cornmeal mix as well as fresh oregano and italian parsley with the basil.  The flavor was amazing.  I also used one whole egg with a little water mixed in instead of egg whites.  My husband, who loves fish, went absolutely wild for this and wants me to try it on some bass that I have in the freezer.   The taste is light, fresh and clean - a great receipe!

Loved this!  Since I had a package with 1.5 lbs of tilapia, I added a little more of everything.  Used 1 egg w yolk, and one egg white.  Threw in a bit of garlic salt and garlic powder.  Used a lot of fresh ground pepper.  Was plenty flavorful for us!  My only advice is to cook it longer.  I did closer to 25 min.                

On the side we used some mayo mixed w dill relish, like a tartar sauce.  Will absolutely make this again!

Very easy and so tasty!!  I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs because I like the extra crunch they give.  Made it for my parents who aren't supposed to eat fried food but love fried fish. Big hit!  Will definitely make this again.

I didn't even have cornmeal and this turned out well. As opposed to other reviewers comments, I thought that the mixture was a perfect compliment to the taste of Tilapia. Simple. I paired it with a Dill Sauce from another recipie on this site and it was absolutely delectable

The secrete to oven frying fish, chicken, etc., is to bake it on a wire rack over a quarter baking pan like a jelly-roll pan.  This way it cooks on both sides at the same time by allowing the hot oven air to circulate around the meat on the raised wire rack surface.  And it shortens the cooking time.
As others have mentioned, I added 1/2 tsp. of onion & garlic powder and blk. pepper.  In my kitchen, ANY fish deserves these tasty little morsels.

Not my favorite...I added a few extra seasonings to the bread crumb/cornmeal mix (Old Bay seasoning, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder) though still found it bland.  I like to cover the "fishy" taste of fish and this did not do the job.

This was excellent.  I was concerned that the breading would be too bland, but it was perfect as is.  Baked the fish about 15 minutes, then broiled for a few more.  Crunchy and tasted great.  We did use seasoned salt vs. regular salt.

This fish has that almost fried taste. I added garlic and onion powders to the flour. The bottom browns and crisps up much better than the top, so next time, I will either flip the fish halfway through or spray the top with Pam.

We enjoyed this fish a lot!  I felt like it could have been seasoned a little more.  Maybe next time I will grate some garlic into the egg whites.

Nice crispy crust, but not very flavorful. Next time, I will season the fish directly and add more seasonings.

Did not care for this much.  The coating looked as if it was raw and needed browning.  I tried spicing it up a bit but.........it was still blah.  Will not make again.

This makes for a good dinner it is not only fast and easy to make  & at the least not to mention very good.  I recomend adding a snub of lime for greater taste at the end, before eating. Side dishes I added where white rice and Green beans,s auteed in pepper with a pinch of nutmeg.

For all who dont know...this fish is VERY VERY MILD IN FLAVOR.  If you want the punch add it, no biggy. This recipe fits this fish right on!!! I did part of the fish exactly as the recipe called for the kids and then some with the "punch" like hubby and I like. It was AWESOME!!!! This recipe is now posted to the kitchen cabinet with the others I used often. LOVED IT....thanks from Kansas

Great base recipe! The bread crumb mixture did need a little extra seasoning but that's just personal taste. I also just used all bread crumbs and skipped the cornmeal. This is a wonderful healthy alternative to frying with very similar taste results!

Great on a sandwich!  Added Jerk Seasoning to the flour and then sprinkled more on top before baking.  Also sprayed the top w/ nonstick spray before baking.

family loved it. i used all whole-wheat flour (they couldn't taste any difference, and i felt better about making it even more healthy!)

also, i flipped the fish after 15 mins (also gave the baking sheet another quick spray of pam) and baked for another 5 to 10 mins (check after 5 mins for doneness)

I didnt have the cornmeal on hand, so I made do without, and we really liked the crunchy outside and light, flaky inside, and that it was baked, not fried. I added powdered ranch dressing to the bread crumbs to give it a bit of a zing. I will definitely make again, we're always trying new tilapia recipes

Yum!  I added a bit more salt, and some tuscan herb spice mix (marjoram, basil, bay leaf, etc) to the crumbs, then drizzeled with a teeny bit og olive oil before baking.  Came out crispy and flavorful!  Tx!

This is my favorite recipe for Tilapia.  I have made it many times, and each time it turns out perfectly.  The Tilapia is great surved over a bed of rice with a veggie side dish.

We LOVE tilapia and we have it frequently. I used a little common sense and added some extra seasoning to this recipe(a little garlic powder and seasoned pepper) to our desire. We really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing. YUM!

Yes, I seasoned the fist with lemon pepper and used panko bread crumbs and placed it on a wire rack in the pan.  This makes the fish crispy on the top and the bottom and it looks really fried. I also added a bit of oregano and basil to the panko bread crumbs.

This was pretty good. I didn't actually use the basil because my husband doesn't care for the taste. I used 1 or 2 shakes of Italian seasoning instead. Also, the bread crumbs I used were garlic flavored. I only made 2 fillets and ended up needing to cook them for 15 minutes. It was a little hard to tell when they were done (it's not easy to flake the fish with the coating on it) so I used a thermometer instead.

Made exactly as stated. I did not care for this. If people would stop rating recipes based on their changes and instead rate the recipe, itself, as it it supposed to be, this recipe would never have 4 stars. We shouldn't have to read 300 reviews to figure out if it is good or not. Defeats the purpose of a rating system.

My family loved this recipe. I followed the advice of others by drizzling the olive oil and using foil for easy clean up. I had large pieces of tilapia and baked the fish for around 10 minutes and then I browned the fish under the broiler for 2-3 minutes. I had to watch it closely so that the fish didn't burn. I will add more spices next time because my family loves more seasoning. I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used panko bread crumbs.

Used frozen tilapia and not very good fish. Expect that good fresh fillets would make this a four-star prepared per the recipe. Maybe should modify per other reviewers to spice up the taste.

Pretty darn good. I thought it was as close to fried as you could get for baked. I added more seasoning/spices, even dill in with the cornmeal. Used foil to line cookie sheet, baked 10 min, then put in broiler for 1-2 min.

I didn't think it was bland, I used Old Bay though instead of salt and pepper in both bread dips (flour mixture, and a little in the cornmeal/bread crumbs).  Good served with lemon juice as a topping.

I'm not a fish lover but this really satisfied my family and myself. I added a little blackened fish seasoning to the bread crumb mixture because we like the extra flavor.

This was very tasty.  We didn't have any basil (I know, crazy) but we did have some Pampered Chef Basil Citrus Rub which was good...I'd actualy add more than what's called for of Basil or added spice.  Would be good to cut the fish in strips for fish sticks, too!!  Thank you!

I agree that this recipe is kind of bland. It is a nice base recipe that can be spiced up though. Even just using some garlic power in the bread crumbs adds a lot of needed flavor. Overall this was a very nice, fairly mess-free way to cook some delicious crunchy fish.

I followed the recipe exactly...and I have to say it's honestly the worst thing I have ever cooked. I have never given a 1 star review and feel awful doing so but if you follow this exactly...it's pretty bad. There was no taste; it tasted the same as eating plain unseasoned breading. I'm sure it's totally different if you add spices but as is...it's pretty bad.

When my youngest says I should enter a cooking contest and my older (pickier) eater keeps telling me how good it is... it definitely gets 5 stars!  We have an old family recipe for beer battered fish but I wanted the same "feeling" only healthier... this was it!  I made only minor changes: I cut each fillet into 6 big chunks to make it more like our recipe.  I used heaping measurements to insure enough breading.  Instead of egg whites, I used egg beaters, whipped up frothy (would've used skim milk if I didn't have the beaters).  Also, added 1.5 tsp Creole Seasoning and a heaping 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning.  Placed the breaded chunks on a baking sheet lined with crumpled foil as others reviewers suggested... FANTASTIC! Thanks for sharing.

This was good, although I would recommend adding more seasoning. I added cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the flour and used italian style breadcrumbs. Next time I think I'll try seasoning the fish itself.  Thanks for a good recipe though.

I made this exactly as written.  It was crunchy but the coating was really dry.  It also didn't have a lot of flavor as others have mentioned.  I think it would be better you added some garlic salt or powder to the coating mix.  Also if you don't mind the calories I would use butter or margarine instead of the egg white.  But if you're trying to cut calories this is definitely the way to go.  You just have to get past the dryness.  I will probably make this again with the variations I mentioned above.

I don't like fish, but am trying to work it into my weekly diet so I tried this because I've heard tilapia is very mild. I liked it! Only giving four stars because I altered it just a little. I used one large egg instead of 2 whites (because I hate separating eggs, and then what to do with the yolks?); replaced the cornmeal with grated Parmesan (partly because I didn't have any cornmeal) and Italian seasoning instead of the basil because that's what I had on hand. My four picky kids (including a fellow fish hater) liked it as well. This recipe is a keeper!

Love this recipe! Made this for the second time tonight and it turned out great again. I do add garlic powder, onion powder, and thyme to give the breadcrumb/cornmeal coating more flavor, but this is a solid recipe as written. The fish was perfectly cooked and the coating was super crunchy. Thanks, I'll make this again. :)

AWESOME!! This was so good! I used a little extra of flour and cornmeal so I wouldn't run out (I had 5 fillets) and I used 1 whole egg instead of just the whites. I added seasoning salt and pepper to both the flour mixture and the cornmeal mixture, and I added a TBS or 2 of parmesan to just the cornmeal mixture. It took 15 minutes at 450, and then I broiled it for 2 minutes so the top was extra crispy. My 5-year-old and husband scarfed it!

I thought this had a simple but not bland taste to it. I didnt have cornmeal and only had italain bread crumbs and its still turned out nice and crunchy. If you like recipes that are simple and not overpowering this is perfect for you. Just add some salt. I will be making this again. thanks Oh wait I did add parmesan cheese I forgot I alway add parm cheese to my breadcrumbs!!

I didn't think this was bland at all, but I used Italian style bread crumbs, omitting the basil.  I also used one whole egg rather than the whites.  I will definitely make this again, with other types of fish.

My husband ate this, but felt that it was very bland. I thought for sure that my 4-year-old daughter would really like it, but she just tried a little bit and wouldn't eat the rest . . . It was an EASY recipe. I wish I'd done what some of the other reviewers did and added something to make it less bland.

This recipe has a great texture and is super-easy as well as heart healthy.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I felt it was a little bland.  I will make this again, but next time I will add more seasoning to both the flour mixture and the cornmeal mixture.  Maybe some cajun spice or seasoned salt.  It just needs a little more "bam!"

This just didn't turn out well at all.  I read the other reviews and really tried to spice up the bread crumbs with parmesan cheese and tons of Emeril's Essence, even sprayed the coating with butter spray, but it still tasted bad.  The texture was good, but the taste was really bad.  Sorry!

I have got to say that I'm not impressed.  I even tried to spice it up after reading others' reviews.  I have made salmon with cornmeal and enjoyed it, but tilapia is not one of those fishes that can bring out the flavor in cornmeal.  It was bland regardless of how much seasoning I added, and the crust was dry, even if the fish inside wasn't.  Sorry, but I wouldnt' recommend this.

Great crispy recipe. My boyfriend and I try to avoid eating fried foods at all costs and this was a wonderful recipe. I didn't have any cornmeal, the flavor was ok and since I realized it would be a little bland I bought some olive tapenade from Trader Joes and spread a little of it on top and it added a nice little kick. Will be making again and again.

Delicious and so easy to make. If you add more seasonings other than salt and pepper, it will taste even better, just the way you want it. I highly recommend making this when you're just tired and don't want to cook much.

I followed the recipe but added lots of garlic and extra basil, along with some greek seasoning and still found this to be quite bland.  There are much better ways to prepare this fish that are healthy and incredibly tasty.  Thanks anyway but I won't be using this again.

This is an ok recipe, I've had better baked fish dishes. The bread crumbs and corn meal make a harder crust type shell over the fish, I must say the fish was very moist, but not enough flavor on the fish itself. It is not a keeper.

Made this last night, changed a few things, I mixed all dry ingredients together, I put them all in a plastic bag, here is what I added, paprika, adobo, garlic powder, parsley,  parm graded cheese, and a garlic with lemon mix spice,  corn mix, Panko bread crums and flour,  I first dipped fish in egg and mil mixture and them shakes fish in dry spices bag, and baked at 400 % for 15 min and switched to broil on high for 5 min.  My husband is very picky and  all he said was the fish was outstanding, so yes I will be making this again

Like most people said, this fix was a little on the bland side.  Needed some extra salt and it would've made for some really good fish!

Bland. And not crunchy or crispy so much as dry. For the many and flavorful ingredients, and the prep work and time, this was a huge disappointment for me.

11 and 8 year old boys loved this crispy fish! I used Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs for the breading.

Found the recipe to be good, but not great. Might make again but will definitely be adding more seasonings and maybe a lite sauce to it.

Easy and quick.  Like other cooks I added some additional spices to the coating.

I thought this tasted fine just made. I bought a larger pack of tilapia, that was 2 lbs, and doubled the recipe. Although, I recommend only making what will be eaten that evening. It just doesn't have the same appeal re-heated. I used 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites. I find dried basil flavor a little strong, so I did half basil and half oregano. I also added a little garlic salt. Only other change I made was using panko bread crumbs. Despite tasting fine, I did think the recipe tasted like breaded baked fish and was not reminiscent of fried fish. Although, it was still better than the bread in a box. I also lined my baking sheet with foil, and drizzled a little olive oil, and found them to still stick some. My fish additionally took about 40 minutes to bake instead of the 10-15 minutes. They were on the large side though.

This was very tasty and a good fix for our weekly "Fish Night". I added extra seasoning (garlic powder, Italian seasoning, pepper, grated Parmesan) to both the flour and breadcrumbs (even though I already use seasoned breadcrumbs), and added a squeeze of lemon before serving. DELICIOUS! Served with some rice and garlic bread and you have a nice light, but filling, supper!

Healthy alternative to friying.  I like mine a little spicy, so I added a dash of cayenne.

Even after doctoring this recipe quite a bit, I still found it bland.  I Think the problem is the bread crumbs, makes the texture a bit off and does nothing for the taste.  Any ideas for a coating that will be crunchy but have some flavor?

I think it needs more crunch and would be better with cod or milder fish, too fishy for the kids

cut into strips frist too to make more like fish sticks for the kids

Somtimes the flour doesn't seem to cook well. I may not be shaking off the extra well enough. But, this is tasty and a healty alternative deep fried fish.

This was extremely bland as is. The crunch and texture is good though which is why I gave it a 4. Needs lots more spices added in to the breading and then it will be a 6!

This was so good! My husband and I are trying to stay away from fried food and eat more fish, but lately even tilapia tasted fishy to me and I could barely eat it. This fish came out crispy and satisfied my craving for fried fish. The only thing I did different is used Italian seasoned bread crumbs b/c that's all I had and left out the basil.

I found this to really bland.  It was crunchy, which was great, but it lacked flavour.  Maybe with some seasoning mix, like cajun or lemon pepper it would work, but I didn't enjoy it.

My kids and I enjoyed this last night. I did spray the top-side of the fish with cooking spray so it would brown a bit (that worked nicely). Thanks for the recipe.

Well, I made an interesting substitution for this one, didn't have corn meal, but had corn bread mix. I thought, hey it's mostly corn meal right? It actually turned out really well, just a little extra sweet which actually was not bad at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat. (plus now I had cornbread on the side). Amazing recipe. As someone who has really only enjoyed fish on the coast, this made even frozen Tilapia tasty. Thank you! Thank you! Thank You!!!!

Nice recipe. I used Zatarain's fish fry instead of flour and bread crumbs. It has a flavor and add some garlic salt. I love it.

I don't know what i did wrong but this was really bad.  Didn't appear to look fried or even really done.  The breading stuff was just laying on it and still very powdery.  What was supposed to moisten this to 'fry' it?  This was too bad to eat.

Great idea, but the changes I made were significant to the taste. I used Creole Seasoning with the cornmeal rather than simply basil as well as put in a little white pepper for some heat. It tasted great and everyone loved it, AND it's a healthy version - probably the only way I can get anyone in the family to eat fish is fried, so this fake-fried is perfect. Definitely on the heavy rotation list.

This had a nice cruncy coating, but if I make this again, I will season it up a lot more. As written, we thought it was bland.

As advertized, very crunchy and crisp.  I added some more seasonings as well--some garlic powder to the flour mixture and some hot sauce to the egg mixture.  This is pretty messy to dip, as another reviewer mentioned, but that's par for the course if you are breading and frying, or in this case, baking.  I think I'd put the flour mixture into a bag and shake it onto the tilapia, but otherwise I wouldn't change much.  If you are serving this without sauce, yes, definitely add more seasonings as tilapia is mild and plain so it needs seasoning to punch it up.  I served it with tartar sauce, however, and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I ran out of eggs so I dipped in skim milk instead. Baked for 15 minutes then dribbled a little fresh lemon juice and Tabasco on top. Yum!

I really liked this a lot but my husband not so much. I give it a 4 anyway. It satisfied my craving for fish sticks and was much healthier. I use half panko for the crumbs and it was super crunchy.

Good but kind of bland. In the last few minutes, I topped each with some freshly grated parmesan and that seemed to help.  Good base recipe, though!

VERY good and easy tilapia recipe, as long as you SPICE IT UP! :D   You could add whatever you wanted to this really, cajun seasoning, lemon pepper, italian seasoning, garlic, red pepper, etc etc etc.  Loved this as a base for crunchy breaded fish!

Great simple recipe. This was the first time I have ever cooked fish! I'm trying to get our family to eat more seafood and this was a great starter recipe as tilapia is a very mild fish and the crust was the perfect consistency.

This makes perfectly crispy baked tilapia! I did add extra seasonings to the breading, but that's up to your taste. Would make great, healthy fish sandwiches!

This was a great recipe and my dinner turned out delicious tonight.  I did, like many other reviewers add some additional spices (in this case lemon pepper and some extra basil and oregano) to the cornmeal and bread crumb mixture and drizzled some olive oil over the fish.  I also took one reviewer's advice and put the fish under the broiler for a few minutes at the end of cooking.

The crunchy texture of this fish is wonderful!  This will definitely go into heavy rotation at our house.  Would have given it a 5 star review, but I agree that you need to add a little more spice to the coating.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was just ok for us. i should have known better since tilapia really isnt very flavorful. i even added several spices to the flour mixture.i also was not a huge fan of the cornmeal in the breading. i really didnt like the texture of it. it could have been just me because i am not used to it though. i really wanted to like this but, sorry, wont make this again.

Except for using cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and adding a dash of Old Bay seasoning these were prepared according to the recipe.  The Tilapia was crunchy and good...Next time I will tweak the recipe and add some more spices.

Time from start to serving was under 30 minutes.  Heck...That's less time than it takes to drive to my local hamburger joint and get served.

Very Good. I did not have cornmeal, so
I used strickly Italain Breadcrumbs with
some prefered spices and it came out moist and crispy. The egg whites are
really the trick here. Don't substitute
a whole egg. Put in the extra effort, it will be worth it. Thank You

i used flounder (that's what i had available) and added garlic powder and onion powder (it already called for salt and pepper), and it turned out lovely.  my daughter loved it.  we served it with honey carrots and rice.

This a really easy recipe.  I, too, adjusted the seasonings for the corn meal/bread crumb mixture  using lemon pepper, garlic powder and an all-purpose blend (McCormick's Salt-free All-purpose Seasoning.  My six year old granddaughter proclaimed it "the best fish she ever had"!

My fish came out a little dry, likely my fault for leaving them in the oven for too long...  but the breading was very tasty, nice and crunchy!

We absolutely loved this recipe!! I give it an A++ Its so crunchy but tender inside! Baked!!! NOT FRIED!! Less calories!! I did add parmesan cheese, dill, salt free seasoning to spice it up a bit then sprinkled lemon pepper on it before baking.  I made sure to generously cover the fish with the frothy egg whites on both sides then dipping it into the bread crumb mixture.(I feel thats the secret of making it so crunchy!!!!! 
I served it with a wedge of fresh lemon and stemed vegetables! This recipe is definately being added to my recipe collection!

We loved this!  Another tasty way to cook fish is always welcome in my book.  I was worried about it being a little bland based on other reviews so I sprinkled a little Old Bay on top before baking - I shouldn't have.  It didn't need it.  However, we did prefer it with tarter sauce but we love our condiments.  Next time I will make exactly as the recipe says!

This is great! a quick easy meal with lots of low fat protien. I tried the same ingrediants with pounded chicken with wonderful results. I also added ground flax seed to the corn meal for added benifits.

I was completely unimpressed with this recipe.  I didn't care for the texture and the taste was bland.  It was edible but not something I'd make again.

This was so good!  I am so happy to have a recipe like this, to avoid frying!  My husband and I thought it was even crispier and crunchier than when we fry battered fish in oil.  Also, the crispy coating actually stuck to the fish, rather than sliding easily off as usually happens with oily fried fish.  The only thin I did a little differently was I spritzed some spray-on  olive oil on top of the coated fish before baking, thinking that it would help hold everything together a bit better.  I might try using a different pan next time, to try and get the bottom of the fish a bit crispier, but either way we'll definitely be making this again!

While some reviewers have noted a lack of flavor, I think this recipe makes a good substite for deep-fried fish (which doesn't have much seasoning).  We enjoy it, and it's become a low-fat staple in our home.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. It was quite bland. If I were to make this again I would add more spices and leave out the flour.

Bland, very bland.  Neither of us could say this was flavorful.  However, we believe it has a redeeming quality.  Since it was so moist and mild, we decided to try it again as fish sandwiches with mayo, lettuce, cheese and tartar sauce.  Kindof like a McD fish filet, so to speak.

This was good.  It didn't taste like fried tilapia to me, but it is a lot healthier and it was a good recipe.  I added italian seasoning and pepper flakes to the bread crumbs.  I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as is... and altho the outside was crunchy it was seriously lacking taste.   Salt or something.  It cooked well - looked fine, but it was kinda bland.  I was disapointed but we ate it all...

Wonderful! Very crunchy and moist, and not greasy like fried fish.  I love spicy food so I added some cajun seasoning as well as a few other spices.  I'll be making it again this week!

I liked this dish. I did make a couple of changes. I forgot to buy whole eggs at the store so I used Better than eggs (couldn't beat those to be fluffy like egg whites though), fresh basil and instead of crumbs I used ground oats - someone used them all up and didn't inform me. I do think this needed a little kick so I sprinkled a little spicy seasoning on top afterwards. I can't wait to try this with the correct ingrediants next time.

And I didn't have basil.

Very good.  Added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and grated in 1/2 cup of parmesan.  One big mistake I made, took the leftover coating and added it to the top of the fish before baking, it made the crust very dry but the fish was perfect and the coating on the bottom was moist.

guys forget about the cornmeal and bread crumbs, use panko crumbs and add lemon juice to the egg whites to emulsify a bit. AMAZING.

I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand, so I used crushed croutons instead. I also used a cajun seasoning instead of the basil. I could have used more, though, because the coating was rather bland. This was my first time making fish and it was nice how the oven baking did not make the house smell fishy.

I agree with another reviewer that the coating is bland as written. Lemon pepper and garlic powder might be a good addition. Mine didn't brown at all either --maybe a spritz of olive oil or non-stick spray before baking would help, or a higher oven temp?

5 stars for me. I substituted several ingredients. Instead of egg whites, I used mayonnaise. Instead of pre-made bread crumbs, I had one piece of bread I toasted well without over toasting and crumbled. Placed in oven with cherry tomatoes.

It was really good baked in the oven. I thought I was eating lean fried catfish with nice flavors. I made some tartar sauce.

I made the original recipe and was surprised how nicely the coating stayed firm. My husband doesn't care for most fish recipes I've tried, but he enjoyed this recipe.  He said it tasted a bit like chicken.  I might spice it up a bit more next time, as in some of the other reviews but I would definitely make it again.

The whole family loved it.  My husband suggested using some seasoning salt, as it wasn't quite salty enough, and possibly some garlic.  But it was super easy and not messy!!!

Loved this recipe! I added to the already seasoned Panko bread crumbs garlic powder, thyme, onion flakes, and a lot of Old Bay. I baked the fish in my toaster oven...too hot to fire up the gas oven!! Using the toaster oven insured a nicely browned top to the fish, it looked fried! A family favorite and so easy to prepare:))

The best Tilapia recipe I've ever tried, (and I've tried many)!
I added 1/4 tsp. of oregano to the bread crumbs, (only because I'm Italian); otherwise, no changes...this is perfect!!

Crunch is okay, but definitely needs additional flavoring. May make again, but will season the fish before putting it through the flour. Also a bit dry-- may need to sprinkle some butter over it.

This was very tasty with Cod and the addition of Old Bay Seasoning and some lemon pepper. The Panko bread crumbs really make it nice and crispy though. Not as browned as I would like it, as baked fish cooks so fast it doesn't have a chance to brown except the bottom. Everyone liked it!

We certainly liked the crunchiness but found it very lacking in flavor.  I even salt and peppered the tilapia before coating and used seasoned breadcrumbs.I certainly would appreciate ideas on adding some flavor!

Blah. So plain & boring. I don't think I did anything wrong, but I can't figure out where four and five star reviews are coming from. I'm disappointed I wasted two good pieces of fish.

Made as written except I used Italian Panko bread crumbs. Giving it a 4 because it did need more salt     I also added garlic powder.  Next time I will add more salt and garlic powder. Other than that it cooked up just right   And I may possibly brown extra Panko bread crumbs in butter in a pan , season with salt and put on top I of fish just before I take the fish out of the oven.

I LOVED this recipe. I used cod because I didn't have tilapia...and neither did the grocery store. So delicious and really tasted like fried fish. I think it is because of the cornmeal. Will definitely make again!

This was very good and probably suitable for a number of other fish varieties.  Be careful not to bread it too much.  I would go a little lighter on the breading next time around.  Very quick and so easy. I also agree with the comment that the breading needs a little more seasoning unless you like  a pretty plain taste.

I used thawed wild caught flounder fillets, coconut flour and seasoned gluten free bread crumbs. Baked on parchment paper rubbed with coconut oil.  Healthier and delicious.

It is a quick and healthier alternative to fried fish. It was a little dry so I added a little olive oil to the pan and the fish should be seasoned with salt and pepper as well. I will add a little more basil the next time. I cooked garlic whipped potatoes with it and added some lemon butter sauce over the fish.

Awesome  recipe! I added agave honey to my all egg white batter. Light rock salt on my tilapia; then I seasoned it, dry rub, and let it sit for 15 minutes. I did not use Pam. I used vegan butter to cook my tilapia on. I also added paprika to my bread crumb mixture. I seasoned my tilapia as I would like it to taste. Wise words: let your recipe be your guide, but not your dictator. love you foodies. Little heads up:I used gluten free flour made by Pillsbury-- Have fun!

I used Panko instead of regular crumbs, added dried dill & topped each fillet with a little margarine after cooking. Served with orzo & veggies, it hit the spot!

We followed the recipe to a tee, it was outstanding, and we're not seafood people. Will definitely be making this again!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and as other reviewers have noted, the flavor was rather bland. I will follow other reviewers recommendations or add some of my own to jack up the flavor a notch or two next time. If you have a perky side dish or two, that's another way to overcome the relative blandness of this recipe.

Used this recipe with catfish.  I added some garlic powder to the crumb mixture.  Last few minutes I turned the oven to broil for better browning.  Very good recipe.  I am sure it will be good with tilapia too.

This was pretty good, hubby scarfed it up like it was his last meal.  I thought the coating was a bit dry and tasteless myself.  Next time I make this, I'll check the other reviews more carefully for suggestions on changes but it gets 4 stars as is because hubby loved it.

I was kinda skeptical at first when my wife found this recipe but it is amazing. We have it as one of our regulars. Tilapia is such an easy fish to cook and this simple coating is just perfect for it.

Great recipe. Quick and easy. I didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted stuffing mix crunched real fine.

I only had Basa fillets, another very mild fish so I added Italian seasoning for a punch of flavor. After spraying the dish and the top of the breaded fillets they sat for 10 minutes before baking. My slightly frozen fillets were baked for 12 minutes and then broiled for 2 minutes. Loved the crunch, will make again!

Pretty crunchy but wasn't exactly the most flavorful dish ever.  Definitely need something to dip it in or eat with on the side, I used a jalapeño-ginger jelly on it.

You can't go wrong with tilapia!  This recipe is great, although you should be careful, it doesn't take long to cook, so don't assume it will be the full time. Someone mentioned it was messy to make, I use two zip top bags and put the flour in one and the breading in the other.  Saves a couple of plates and it's easy to shake it, also I think you get a nice even coating that way.   GREAT RECIPE FOR FISH TACOS!  Just add a nice mango salsa~

Great texture from the breading, and it was good. Next time I'll add some more spices to the breading. As is, it's a little bland for my taste.

I liked the breaded/baked part of this recipe.  It was a nice coating that adhered well to the fish and cooked well.  However, it had virtually no taste.  It was also very dry.  I realize the lack of moisture is due to no oil or butter, but it really wasn't palatable.  We had to use so much tartar sauce and other dips just to eat it that it pretty much cancelled out the health benefits.

Not bad, very light, but needed a lot more seasoning. I looked through some of the reviews before making this, and decided to add some extra seasoning to the breading, and also let the fish sit in lemon juice before starting the process. Still too bland, but what I did like was how well the fish and breading stayed together, and that the breading stayed crispy.

This fish was bland, but crunchy.  It definitley needs more seasoning.  It's ok for a basic recipe, it just needs a little something extra.

This was excellent. I think the coating is probably bland. Non the less I didn't have plain corn meal so I substituted sweet yellow cornbread mix. Came out really good. Was crunchy even though it wasn't fried. My family loved it. Definitely going to make again.

I was happy with the fact that this recipe allowed for a fried texture without the additional calories of frying.  I was unhappy about the taste.  Even though I added many more spices to the cornmeal/breadcrumb mixture, it was pretty tasteless.  The coating was also too dry tasting...it needed something.  All in all, it would have been fine if I would have used lots of tartar sauce on the fish...but that would have defeated the purpose of making a lower calorie recipe.  I may try this again with more spices to increase the flavor and maybe using spray butter on the fish before it goes into the oven?  Something is needed to take away the dry cornmeal taste/texture.

Tasty but dry. I dod add Old Bay, garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning. I do not want to sprinkle it with oil like some suggested, so I think the next time I will make some kinda salsa to go on top.

WOW! best fish I've had in a while!  so crispy and not fried.  I used Cajun season in the flour and it gave it a perfect little kick of flavor.  Will be making this one again, hopefully soon!

Enjoyed this!  Used the whole egg and seasoned bread crumbs, so I eliminated the basil.  Also added garlic powder and onion powder, per previous reviewer's suggestion.  Very good!

Four stars for health and crisp-tenderness; for flavor it merits only a 3 (even with additional herbs and seasoned salt and garlic powder and cayenne pepper). It just needs some butter or mayo or something moist and flavorful and probably calorie-laden.

This is the first time I have posted a comment about a recipe.  I had to modify because I didn't have cornmeal- so I opened a box of Jiffy Corn muffin mix and used that in place of the cornmeal. It was fabulous! It added a slight sweet taste to the fish, but VERY slight. It was crunchy and fork tender. My son thought it was bland, as others have posted, but he likes a zip to it, so he just added some cajun seasoning on his serving at the table.   Will definitely be making this again!

Good as is if you are looking for a light recipe.  I prepared the tilapia as it is written and it was very good.  Will add a bit of Old Bay to the bread crumb/cornmeal mixture next time.  Great...Thanks!

I really like this recipe because I can still have my fried fish and not have to worry about consuming all the grease. I did as some of the others by adding Old Bay Seasoning to the meal mixture and it helped with the flavor a lot. I will be using this recipe all the time! thanks!

Good, but needs a little more flavor.  I added some cayenne and garlic powder.  Next time I think I will add some parmesan cheese too.

Since I didn't have any cornmeal, I crushed French's Fried Onions into crumbs and mixed that with the bread crumbs. I also added some Garlic Powder and Paprika. turned out Delicious. Definately a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This was DELICIOUS!  I didn't have cornmeal, so I used Panko instead.  I also used some Foxpoint seasoning for a little added flavor.  It was fantastic and I will definately make this again!

This was very good!!  I used 2 whole eggs instead of just whites and 1/4 cup of my big bottle of ranch seasoning instead of cornmeal becuz I didn't have it.  They turned out great!

This recipe is pretty good. It really was crunchy! I added more seasonings to mine, and I could have added even more. It's one of those that you can play with-a good base idea-just add your own twist!

I was so embarrassed when I served this fish for a party.  The fish was tasteless and hard.  It was the only dish that was not eaten.  Will not use this again.

This is a GREAT family fish recipe, especially if your not big on the fishy flavor.  I have never really liked fish or ate it, but now that I found this recipe with the tilapia we eat it about once a week!...I even cut up the talapia prior to breading and make fish sticks for my two year old and he LOVES it, and so do I because its way better for him than the ones in the freezer isle!...I add parmesan chees, garlic salt, and what ever seasonings sound appealing that day into the bread crumb mix:)

Great recipe. I did a few modifications. I didn't use any cornmeal, and used italian style bread crumbs. I sprinkled some fresh dill and capers on top before it went in the oven. Thank you for for a fantastic recipe!

We like a little more flavor in the crispy coating, so I usually use either seasoned bread crumbs or add more herbs. The times that I haven't had cornmeal in the house I've just doubled the bread crumbs, still good. Also, I spray the top of the coated fish with a little of my cooking spray to help the coating stay intact -- I doubt this is 100% necessary, but I do it out of habit now.    Those are pretty much the only tweaks for me; this is an AWESOME recipe that sort of gives you the feel of fried fish without the mess of an inch of oil. Love it.

It was good enough to eat, but we weren't wowed. The breading was very bland and by no means tasted like oven fried. It tasted like a bland and baked fish. We just didn't get any crunch from it. If I tried this one again I would have to do some tweaking. Thanks for sharing. I love trying new things, it's just different strokes...

This recipe is excellent. It is a good twist on the simple old baked fish. I followed the recipe but I did make a few changes. I prepared the fish using Italian bread crumbs. I let my fish bake for 10minutes on 450degrees then I added aged parmesan cheese and baked the fish for 5 more minutes. This fish was awesome!! My hubby who is not a fish eater even ate this fish. This was one of my favorite recipes on this website.

Yummy recipe. I used old bay instead of the basil.  You really have to coat the cookie sheet with a lot of oil and spray oil on the top (or flip them so the top side gets oiled too.) Season the breading however you like.

Crunchy but bland. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the bread crumbs nor any bread to make fresh crumbs. I substituted cream of wheat for that. Other than that, I made it according to the recipe. It was bland. I wish I had read some of the reviews for this but I was in a hurry to find a good oven fried recipe that would still be crunchy. Next time I'll make WITH bread crumbs and some garlic salt and more pepper. Maybe Italian bread crumbs. But it was crunchy.

This was REALLY good!  Tilapia can get boring, but it's such an easy and inexpensive dish its worth experimenting.  This was soooo good!  I added lots of parsley and parmegian cheese and that helped.  Definitely add as much flavor as you can.  But the consistency is great.

the only change i made with this was to add more seasonings to the breadcrumb/cornmeal mixture. it was absolutely fantastic and crunchy! (i also baked it on crumpled aluminum foil like another reviewer suggested and even the bottom got crispy)

The coating was a bit dry, but overall not bad. I also used extra spices (dill, garlic powder) in the coating.

The men in my family don't like fish and even they said this is a keeper.  Unfortunately I didn't have the corn meal and probably would have been fantastic.  The baking directions were perfect.  Thanks so much for such an easy recipe.

I made my own bread crumbs and used crushed tortilla chips instead of the cornmeal.  Accidentally used the egg yolks instead of the whites (no laughing, I am a new cook) and added seasoned salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic to the flour.  It came out great.  I am not a big fan of fish, but really enjoyed this.

This was my first time baking Tilapia. It turned out amazing! I did not use the basil, simply because I didn't have any. Im sure it would have had added a wonderful flavor to the fish. I did spray the fish with a cooking spray and returned them to the oven for a few more minutes so they did not look dry.  Great recipe! Thanks!

Could use a little more flavor - we ended up pouring some lemon juice over the fish.  Next time I will spice it up a bit more.  Still a good recipe.

I cheated. I saw others complaining about blandness so I used italian bread crumbs and mixed in a little dry ranch dressing mix. I omitted the flour and cornmeal and it tasted fine. Even my picky 7 year old liked it.

Pretty good, a little bland will add some extra spices next time for a little oomph. But over all very tasty! It came out nice and crunchy.

Made this for my in-law's. My father-in-law LOVED it! He took the leftover home to make a sandwhich with. I agree with some of the other reviewers, need to add a little more spice in with the bread crumbs and cornmeal. I added garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and extra basil. Very good, very crunchy.

I am not much of a fish eater but this was pretty good.  Not the best but pretty good. I took advice of others and seassoned very well with garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red peppers and i threw some french fried onions in with the breadcrumbs. Pretty good.

Followed the recipe but the coating was more dry than crispy and it kind of ruined it. It'd be better to spray it with an oil or butter spray first, but it was also nice to know it didn't have all the calories of a fried fish!

This recipe needs a LOT more spices in it to make it even close to a 5 star. Also, watch how long you bake the fish as it will dry out quickly. I'll be making this again but will add lots more spice.

This is a good recipe to try if you want to see how to coat, then bake fish.  I have made this several times and always add some Old Bay seasoning.  Sometimes I use finely crushed crackers instead of corn meal and have even used a little wheat germ. Parmesan in the final coating is good, too.  No matter what I do, the fish always turns out well by following the basic coating and baking directions.

I just made this tonight and it was delicious. I did add about 1/2 tea. lemon pepper and doubled the basil. I also sprayed the pan with olive oil as well as the fish before baking. Next time I will add more spices. My husband said "you can make this anytime". Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great recipe! I really liked it because it was so quick and easy. I didn't have much time so I was looking up some quick recipes with simple ingredients, and I came across this. I changed it a little bit to get more flavoring... I used Italian bread crumbs, squeezed a little bit of lemon juice on it just before it was done cooking, and added some more salt. I also used the same process to cook some shrimp and that turned out pretty well also. Thanks to allrecipes.com for such a great recipe!!!

I really like this recipe. I heeded the warnings about needing extra seasoning and it was perfect.  The coating was a bit dry, but it was all delicious.  I'll find some sauce to go over it, but I will definitely make this again!!! Thanks

This is a good base recipe, but extremely bland as written. We were dipping it in an avocado yogurt sauce so it was okay, but just the fish alone needs WAY more seasoning. I'm going to try adding some dill, lemon pepper and a little cayenne next time.

This was my first time cooking fish, so I thought I'd stick pretty close to the recipe, but I used fresh oregano instead of basil because I had it on hand. I would definitely play around with different seasonings. I agree with others that this is a good starter recipe. I will definitely try this again though!

I made this twice in one day (lunch and dinner) and loved the crispy texture both times.  The first time it was too bland, so I added spices and seasonings to the bread crumb mixture the second time around.  It might take me another try to get the seasonings just right but will definitely use it again.

This is a decent dish. I think I would appreciate it more if it had more flavor. Also, the texture of the corn meal did not suit me. I'm going to try other tilapia recipes, but this one isn't bad.

Delicious way to make easy, crispy fish!  I omitted cornmeal and added a dash of flaxseed-- maybe 1T.  Served with brown rice, carrots, broccoli, and a quick and dirty aioli of light Trader Joe's mayo with minced garlic and a dash of lemon juice.

We loved this.  My son ate it like fish sticks.  I added Lowreys seasoning salt, lots of it to the flour and some lemon pepper to the bread crumb mix.  It worked great.  I also used tin foil in the pan and little olive oil spray on the tin foil and on top of the fish, very light.  I put it in the middle rack for 10 min and the top rack for 5 ( our oven is a slow oven).  We will make this agin for the Tilapia for sure!  Clean up was easy too.

This was great!! I had salmon so I used that instead of the tilapia. Per other reviews I added more seasonings. I used minced onions,basil and a seasoning salt. I baked for 15 min. drizzled some olive oil and flipped and baked for another couple minutes. My husband made a tartar sauce and we spread it on like icing to our salmon. DELICIOUS!!!! We are not big fish eaters but this will be a continued recipe in our house.

This was good, but I used Cod. Need to try with Tilapia. Also added shredded Parmesan cheese and garlic. Served with slice of lemon.

I followed the recipe exactly except cut it down to only two servings.  I bought some frozen tilapia filets that were on sale and not my normal brand and I'll never buy them again, they had no flavor at all.  I was hoping to dress them up a little bit because I just want to use them up.  This recipe didn't help a whole lot.  It wasn't bad, but I might try adding a bit more seasoning to the coating.  Mine didn't brown much, but I only cooked then 12 minutes because my filets were thin.

Turned out well, but a little on the bland side. Substituted sole fillets for tilapia, and it was wonderfully crunchy yet moist. May try it with some lemon pepper or tabasco next time.

Not to impressed with this recipe.  I don't know if i did something wrong, but the fish tasted like grainy corn meal.  It was crunchy, but it was only because of the grainy corn meal!!  Probly won't be making this again.:(

For a family that does not like fish and is learning to eat it....... this was a definite step in the right direction. View this as a starter recipe and adjust according to your taste(s). We added more spices and olive oil over the fish to keep it moist. A keeper in our house to be used over and over again.

5 stars for texture, 3 for taste = 4 stars. I didn't have cornmeal so I used Panko crumbs. Yes it was crunchy, I liked the texture. But it is really bland. I even added a 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning, garlic, onion, paprika and oregano. I do want to try the recipe again but increase the spices.

Not paying attention, I used whole eggs.  And because I already had it, I used Italian-style bread crumbs.  It came out really good.  Very easy!

This was a good starter recipe for me.  I didn't use the eggs, I just sprayed each side with butter spray and sprinkled on the bread crumbs.  I put a little cajun seasoning on the bread crumbs so it had more flavor.  I thought it was excellent.  Nice and moist.  I will definitely be making this again.

Really great taste and light!  I melted a tablespoon of butter and poured over fish before baking. It kept it from getting dry. I also used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain - this was the perfect amount of seasoning. Serve with lemon. Delicious.

I made this gluten free using a corn and rice based bread for crumbs (so I didn't add the corn meal).  The bread also had some spice so I didn't use basil, but in future (when I run out of flavored bread) I will add it.  I turned out nice and crunchy, great with vinegar!

Delicious fish recipe!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and it came out with a really nice crunchy crust.  My onnly change was that I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of normal ones. Next time I think I might do 6 tb Panko and 2 tb cornmeal.  I also thought some spice might be good, so I might add some chili powder or cayenne.

This was great! I used half Panko bread crumbs, half Italian crumbs w/ a little corn meal. Used the whole egg, added a little old bay to the dry mix, garlic powder and extra salt.  Baked at 450 about 12 mins and they were perfect!  Kids gobbled it up!  Thanks!

I made this for dinner last night and it was pretty good.  I did use panko instead of regular bread crumbs and I also added some Old Bay seasoning and lemon pepper to the bread crumbs, but apart from that I didn't change a thing.  The fish was very crunchy and pretty tasty.  We found the flavour of the basil to be a bit much for us and the fish really needed *something*.  I ended up whipping up some homemade tartar sauce (tartar sauce I from this site).  As an aside, this is a good recipe if you really don't care for the taste of fish...the other ingredients are pretty strongly flavoured and tilapia is very mild.

This was dry and bland and I think it might benefit from some Old Bay seasoning mixed into the cornmeal or perhaps a 1/2 package of dry ranch dressing mix or something.  It was crunchy and had that fried texture to it, but very little flavor.  It is a good base for a breaded fish that you can experiment with yourself. Might try again with more seasoning.

This is a good basic recipe.  One variation worth trying is putting provalone or mozzarella cheese slices on the fish for the last few minutes of baking, then serving over spaggetti and marinara like a "parmesean."

This is super!  Really tastes like fried fish.  It's wonderful with catfish.  Even my Louisiana relatives liked it!  I leave out the basil, but add some cayenne to the flour.  Yum!

I really liked the idea behind this and was pleased with the texture of the breading, but it was really bland and detracted from the fish. Even after adding some Sriracha Sauce to give it flavor it was clear to me that it wasn't a preparation I'd be interested in for myself.  I wouldn't be surprised to know this would be a great option for kids, however.  It's really a great option to homemade fishsticks.  Just not my cup of tea, as it were.

This was good and easy and my family really liked it.  I needed a little more of the flour mixture than the recipe called for so next time I will increase the flour to 1/3c.  I did add some extra spices (garlic powder and seasoned salt) as suggested by others.

If you like fried fish, you will like this recipe.  It has a great flavor without all the added fat.  I am used to deep frying fish and usually heavily coat it with cracker crumbs, so I thought this needed heavy coating also, but I was wrong.  You only need a light coating, so I recommend going easy when coating with the cornmeal mixture.  I will definitly be making this one again.  This was very quick to make, too, so it's great if you are short on time and need a quick meal.

I felt that the fish would be bland so, I added all seasoning salt, garlic powder, and ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs. Yummy!!

Very good!  I had Jiffy mix, so I substituted that for the corn meal/bread crumb mix.  And I used dill instead of basil.  The coating came out very nice, and the fish wasn't dry at all.  My non-fish-liking boyfriend said it was "good, for fish."  I think I'll try this coating/baking method with another fish, like cod.

This was pretty good.  I was suprised at how crunchy the crust actually was.  I did add extra spices & thought it was pretty good.

Was quite good though I prefer a bit more something, I may sprinkle in a bit of lemon zest nest time. Was crispy and light.

It is the closest to eating fried tilapia, but without the greasy feel in your mouth.  Good stuff!

You have too eat this dish fresh out of the oven. If not the topping gets kinda soft . I added some spices some extra basil.All in All i'd say this was pretty good I'd  try it again my family loves fish & there aren't a lot of ways to make fish exciting 
This is a good recipe to put you own spin on with differernt spices

This recipe wasn't too bad, but I don't think the end product is worth the preparation effort. As others have stated, it's bland and you do need to really kick it up a notch as that famouse Portuguese guy likes to say.

If you really need to get your fried fiah fix, this is a decent healthy alternative. Otherwise, there are much better recipes for baking fish out there.
