I've alread reviewed this recipe, but I wanted to add something about preventing the color from bleeding.  I dyed my eggs for hours to get a rich, dark color.  Once they were done I rinsed them in water and dried them very well.  When I inserted them into the ring I tried to put them in as deep as possible.  Hopefully this helps!

Original Review: Beautiful bread!  I had to add a little more flour when kneading and shortened the baking time!  Perfect!!  I made one yesterday for Easter, but my family ate it up so I had to bake another today and it came out even better.  Put on sprinkles  for added color.

I love how simple the ingrediants are for this recipe.  I've made it several times, the first time I followed the directions exactly, it took all afternoon with all the rising, but it came out great.  Since then, i have just thrown everything in my bread machine and placing it on the dough setting, then when finished, i roll out the dough and braid it, let it rise and bake.  It's a lot easier for me and still tastes great!

This was a fun bread to make.  The dough was easy to make in my mixer.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with a wreath of braided bread.  I put brown eggs in the wreath, and filled the center with our dyed easter eggs.  It made a beautiful centerpiece for Easter.  The bread was good, and I peeled the eggs and they were cooked through.  I used eggs straight from the fridge and they were not noticibly warm after the loaf rose.  However, the finished loaf should probably be refrigerated for storage if you plan on eating the eggs.

I made this bread years ago - it was great and people are always impressed by how the colored eggs bake with the bread.  I lost the recipe - it's so good to find it again.

This is the recipe I have been searching for. It tastes just like the Easter breads available in fine Italian bakeries in NYC. Very easy to prepare. The delicately sweet flavor and light fluffy texture of the bread is irresistable.

Wonderful!  I made the dough in my bread machine to save time and effort and only put two eggs into the braid.  I painted on the coloring so it didn't bleed into the bread too much.  My mother-in-law actually took a picture of it!  It tasted great, too.

Wow! this bread was easy and very tasty. The first one isn't cold yet and I'm already starting to make more. As others have stated mine only took about 25 minutes to bake to a perfect golden brown. Way to go Holly!

Thank You Holly for your recipe! It went over great today at the Easter Party. My daughter made this. She baked it for only 15 minutes, removed the eggs since it was doughy around them and cooked the bread five more minutes. She only used 4 eggs. 
   If your not thrilled with the idea of baked eggs you can always make sure there is room for them on the bread and add colored easter egss after the bread is baked.

This looked very pretty and impressed our Easter guests. However, the bread never rose and it tasted horrible.  Am I missing something?  I thought you were supposed to mix yeast with warm water first but this recipe didn't have that so we didn't do it.  Just wondering what we can do better next time because it really was a lovely centerpiece on our Easter table!

Easy to make, and it reminds me of my grandma.  I found this recipe after my mom and I talked about old family easter traditions.  My grandma used to make this at easter all the time... so I made it with my daughter and it brought back memories of my grandma and my dad.... I told my grandma that I could now make her easter egg bread and I watched my 100 year old grandma tear up knowing I was carrying on the tradition.

I've made this for our Easter dinner last year and again this year. It is a beautiful bread that is admired by the guests. And it tastes great, too. Last year the colored eggs bled as it baked so this year I used white eggs but removed them when the bread came out of the oven and replaced them with pretty colored eggs after the bread had cooled; pretty colored eggs with no bleeding! Worked out perfectly.

I have to start by saying I'm a native New Yorker now living in the Midwest and the whole reason I made this recipe is bc one review said it taste like the bread you get in the NYC bakeries. This bread was so great! I can't find anything like this out here and I'm so greateful to be able to make my own now.  I read lots of other reviews and I did make some minor changes bc of the other reviews. I upped the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and next time I think I'll go for 1/2 cup (personal preference) I also skipped the butter and did an eggwash in place of it. I think it made the breads presentation. Finally I checked my bread at 20 mins and took it out at 25 mins and it was perfect! Thanks so much for sharing! It's like having a little piece of home!

This is a typical Italian/Latin American Easter bread or "Rosca de Pascuas" as we call it in Argentina. I suggest on thing: Place eggs on the bread unpainted and then, when the bread is done and has cooled off, paint them. Also, wash the eggs before you place them in the bread, they are dirty, they are probably not washed from wherever they came from.

I made two rings of this bread last night.  They both turned out beautifully.  However, like some of the other readers, I had problems with the first ring baking around the perimeter more quickly than in the center.  I saved it by tenting foil around the perimeter and allowing the center to bake some more.  That ring tasted fine, but was a tad dry b/c of the add'l bake time.  The second ring, I foiled just as soon as I saw it beginning to turn light brown.  I removed the tent as soon as I saw the center turn light brown, and let the ring bake a few more minutes completely uncovered.  I also glazed the rings, while still hot, with some melted honey.  Very nice sweet touch.  I will definetly try this again.  Next time I will do an egg wash before baking.

Almost forgot, the recipe definitely needs more flour.  I really didn't measure the extra amount I added . . . as I kept adding it gradually . . . but another 1/2 cup is probably a safe bet.  Without the extra flour, it is too sticky and impossible to knead.

I tweaked this recipe a little - first used my Kitchen Aid mixer - used blade at the start then kneading hook for 8 min kneading - used approx. 3 cups of flour - added one egg (could probably add a 4th)- 2 tblsp. lemon zest - increased the sugar - and one cup of golden raisins (added during the last 5 min. of kneading) - next time I will increase the yeast by one package.  This dough is sticky - use flour on board for ease of handling -- This bread comes out as a sweet bread tender and flavorful - reminds me of the easter bread I had as a child - It is great!!

Wonderful flavored bread!  The dough was sticky, just like the dough I make for cinnamon rolls, but you just have to use extra flour when you work with it--adding too much extra flour to the dough when kneading will make a tough, dry bread.  I sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar, so the whole production smelled delicious!  The only issue I took with this recipe is the baking time.  I reduced to to 25 minutes, and still thought the bread was overdone.  (The raw eggs were still cooked through with this shorter time.)  I used the leftover bread to make bread pudding.

I was very happy to find this recipe. I agree it has "bakery" quality. Very,very easy to make. I took the "bake time" down to 20-25 minutes, and added 1/2 tsp anise extract for that true Italian flavor that it lacked. Family and Friends gobbled up the whole loaf within minutes. I have 6 orders for Easter, Obviously making this one again! Thanks!

Very nice but I have a suggestion. Died eggs will stain the bread and the dough in contact with the egg is very wet. If you use un-dyed eggs, remove them when the bread is done, dye them separately and put them back in, it looks a lot better and the dough near the egg will dry as the bread cools.   Also I baked it only 40 min to an internal temp 0f 195.

Even better then your local bakery...I did make some changes to the recipe...I dyed the raw eggs for almost 24 hours. The color didn't not bleed. Just simply rinse them in water and pat them dry. I brushed the top of the bread before baking it with 2 tablespoons melted butter and one tablespoon honey that I heated in the microwave. I then sprinkled it with sprinkles for a feastive look. I only baked it for 35 minutes as  50 would have burned it crispy.I will definately make this again...even though it is somewhat time consuming! Thanks Luren N. for a great recipe!

I made this for Easter this year & it went over GREAT!  Everyone loved it, even my extra picky-eater nephew & BIL, & my DH's Gramma who has almost stopped eating (advanced stages of Alzheimer's-everything is either "too sweet or too salty" to her) asked for a second piece!  Of course the kids were impressed that the eggs cooked in the oven.  The only alterations I made to the recipie  were to use 6 colored eggs (a rainbow of color), which I allowed to completely dry, then lightly coated with oil before placing in the braid (which helped minimize color bleed), & about half way through baking I basted it with butter again & sprinkled on poppy seeds.  It has a nice, medium texture-not too light, not too dense, & a slightly sweet taste.  Had to print a copy of the recipie for my SIL, who has added it to the family cookbook.  Thank you for this new Easter family tradition.

Great Recipe!! I feel the dough was very easy to make.. it took a little longer to rise...I have one suggestion I feel you should definitely add orange and or lemon zest to the recipe.. it needs more flavor... On a positive note the bread was very moist

This is my favorite part about Easter.  However, my great grandmother's recipe is MUCH different from this.  I know this is very good if you add fresh grated lemon peel to it and cover with colored sugar crystal sprinkles. ALSO, in her recipe you baste the bread with egg.

I loved this concept, and my daughter was really excited to help make the bread dough.  We dyed brown eggs which were beautiful and muted, and after reading some of the reviews, I decided to cover the eggs with a thin layer of butter to see if that would prevent dye transfer onto the bread.  It didn't work on the blue egg, but something seemed to help the other colors.  It's also a good thing that I check on it at 40 minutes, because if I had left it until the timer sounded, it would have burned.  I look forward to trying this again, and I'm determined to find a trick to keep the dye on the eggs only!

NEVER AGAIN.... I tried this for the first time today, to have it ready for Easter dinner.  after forming the braid and brushing it with butter.I let i rise,and it looked great. I bake it at 350.per recipe.. It calls for a  baking time of 50 to 55 min. I checked it at 35 min. and it was already gitting very brown..finally at 45 min. i took it out. the crust was dark brown and very hard...I was affraid it would be under baked..after cooling, the crust is rock hard..what a huge disappointment.

I followed MAINE-MOMMY's directions about dying the eggs and preventing running colors. However, I suggest using food color and water, rather than the pellets with vinegar. They seemed to eat away a thin layer of the egg, and the colors weren't as bright as they might have otherwise. I had very minimal color loss into the bread. I also noticed after I baked this, that the eggs were dull - but that where I had accidentally gotten butter on them, they were bright. I took a brush and painted butter on them, perking the color right back up. My eggs were slightly underdone when the bread was brown (25 minutes) so next time I might lower the oven temp to 325 to let it bake longer. Other than that, great!

I gave this 4 stars because I think the recipe could be simplied. Like others, I put all the ingredients into my bread machine, then took the dough out, rolled it and braided it, added the colored (uncooked) eggs,  let it rise (40 mins), brushed it with melted butter, then baked for ONLY 20 mins. untill golden colored. Watch carefully not to over bake. I added a sugar-water glaze to the top for shine and added sprinkles after the bread was cooled. Over all... I liked it with the minor ajustments.

Adding the yeast to a saucepan and heating it with the milk, butter and a cup of flour is bad advice for beginner bread bakers.  The chance of killing the yeast is much too great.   Don't really know what is accomplished by that first step.  You could do the same thing by gently heating the milk in the microwave to 110 degrees or less, and proceeding with the dough making process.  Scalding pasteurized milk is not always helpful or necessary.  Depending on your oven, this bread should be baked to 200 degree internal temperature in 40 to 45 minutes.  A digital thermometer is an excellent tool for the home baker to have.

I think the recipe is wonderful. However, I had a really hard time rolling the dough to make the desired two lengths to braid the bread with. I'm sure it was something I did wrong. Perhaps I didn't let it rise long enough, I don't know. My Easter Braided bread turned out to look like an Easter Python. Please see attached photo and don't laugh. I'm still bringing it to Easter dinner this evening. Have a wonderful Easter :)

I doubled the recipe and decided no coloured eggs; we just sprinkled with coloured sugar. It needed at least 3 cups of flour more than directed, but otherwise I followed the instruction to a T. It's pretty, so braided, and you look like a great baker:-) it's very good when tepid, tends to get stale very quickly (you can toast it, or make french toast casserole, like I did; but it seems a pity, after all): I used an egg wash, anyway go easy with the oven, 5/10 min less were quite enough for me!

We've made this in my Italian family for generations.  Our version has freshly grated lemon peel and lemon juice, and we sprinkle the top with tiny multi-colored candies for a festive look.  It's wonderful toasted and slathered with butter for breakfast, along with one of the hard cooked eggs.

This recipe tastes good, but there must be a trick to putting the colored eggs in the bread.  Mine tured the bread different colors and did not make a good presentation.  What is the "trick" so that colors do not bleed?  Thanks

My mother's aunt makes this bread but will not part with the recipe. So my mother and her sister have tried for years to duplicate this bread. Imagine my mother's surprise when she came to my house for Easter this year, and I served this bread! I have given her the recipe and she is so hapy! Thank you, Holly, for sharing this recipe!

Bread looked great for Easter.  Thank goodness I read the other reviewers comments about the time-took mine out of the oven after 30 minutes, and it was perfect.  Had a nice degree of sweetness.  Definitely need to slice it down before serving or your guest will never cut into it!

Very easy to make. Of all the recipes I use for bread so far, this is the more satisfying in terms of taste and texture. It did not take long to make either, 40 minutes in the oven, Great recipe. My wife, who is not a big bread fan, ate most of it.

Thank you for posting this wonderful traditional bread. This is the only authentic recipe I have found. I increased the sugar because I like the bread sweeter.

This delightful bread has many variations on record.  This worked for me.  I added an extra 1/2 cup flour, and used bread flour.  After hearing the milk and butter, I used my bread machine, following standard procedure.  For baking, I used polished egg shaped stones covered in foil to hold space for the eggs. My cook time was right at 39 minutes. I dyed hard-boiled eggs to place in the bread at serving.  This prevented dye loss, and allowed the eggs to be refrigerated.  See photo.

This was so easy! I'm only 14 years old and my whole family was asking for the recipe. I did cheat a little bit, I used two loaves of whole wheat bread dough, and used 1/2 a stick of melted butter with 1 tbsp. of brown sugar and cinnamin to coat it before and after baking! I only baked the bread for about 35 min. For decorating i used decorating sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this really turned out great and my husband and kids loved it.  I had a little fun with it and added a touch of vanilla extract to the the mix.   I will definately make this again. The colored eggs were really pretty but next time I will add the colored eggs later because the color faded a little into the bread.

This bread is delicious and very attractive. I made it without the decorative eggs. For my oven, the baking time was just 25 minutes (not 55 minutes as recommended) for a lovely, golden bread.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The listed cooking time was about twice as long as mine took.  So I would caution everyone to watch this carefully.  Second, although the raw eggs cooked beautifully as described, it bothers me that the raw eggs are left in a warm environment for up to an hour during the final rise. The eggs make for a nice presentation but I would not eat them.

I must say I am not impressed with this Easter bread recipe. I have been making Easter bread for years since I moved and my cook books are still in boxes I thought I would give this one a try. It is not sweet enough... It just isn't the same as my old recipe... Happy Easter

Not thrilled.    I made it 3 times just to be sure I hadn't made a silly mistake but I came out rather consistently dry.
Loaf 1: Had to add almost an extra cup of flour to get it dough to a kneading consistency.   While it looked pretty but overcooked  it was dry.
Loaf 2: Worked with an incredibly sticky dough and cut back on the cooking time.    Looked pretty but still was a tad tasteless and dry.
Loaf 3:   Gave up when I was kneading it  and rolled the dough, poured 4 tablespoons of melted butter, a half a cup of sugar and 2 tsps of cinnamon , rolled it jelly roll style, formed the ring, cut slits on top  and turned into a king cake....better, but I've had better king cakes.

This is my second time making this wonderful sweet bread, and again I had to add more flour to my dough while it mixed, maybe about 1/2 cup more than is recommended in the recipe. I strongly second the comments that say to only bake for about 25 minutes, my bread has been baking for 23 minutes and is already golden brown! The next time I make this bread I will brush  an egg wash on top before baking for that shiny texture and delicious flavor, as the butter doesn't do that on its own. An incredible recipe once again! 

Old review:
I made this bread for Easter Sunday 2011, and it turned out not only beautiful on the outside, but sweet and delicious on the inside!! I had to add a bit more flour while kneading it with my mixer and a bread-hook, but every dough needs a little tweaking I suppose. :) A definite recommendation, what a great recipe!

This came out beautifully first try! I kept sprinkling my work surface flour to keep the dough from sticking while I was kneading it.  For me it didn't take the whole 50 minutes to bake only 40. Thanks!

I would like to preface this review by saying I am NOT a bread maker. I don't make bread with my hands and was not sure if I should try this recipe. But I did, and I'll tell you...it turned out fabulous and was the talk of our Easter dinner! The bread itself has a nice consistancy and was very tasty. To my surprise, the eggs were edible as well. One thing, before baking I brushed with butter as instructed, but then sprinkled some sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and little colorful egg sprinkles on top. It was beautiful!! I'll be posting a picture soon. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Increased sugar to 1/3 cup per recipe. Baked on regular, buttered cookie sheet (not air pan) for 25 minutes. Turned pan around after 15 minutes or so. Used about 1/2 bread flour b/c that's what I had in the house. Brushed with butter hot out of the oven. Turned out beautiful!

I threw everything in a bread machine, set it for the next morning, braided it and put the eggs in the braid into the oven for 27 minutes. This bread is really tasty, even using the bread machine. 
Thanks.

This was wonderful.  Oven-time was 25 minutes. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I'm new to bread baking and in the past, have had trouble-overworked dough etc, so was thrilled when this turned out well and airy!  Thank you!  I am giving this a five because of the recipes I have used and followed, yours was the only one that did not estimate total flour and that, I believe is just one of the reasons this turned out for me. This recipe instructed me to trust my senses in judgeing what would be just enough flour and not too much.  I was very nervous about not knowing how much to use at first but in the end-it's all good.  It would have been nice to read 2-1/2"+" cups...being that I'm new at this.  
ps: I sprayed it with butter and sprinkled on sesame and poppy seeds before baking.  I did not place the eggs in the dough this time but will come Easter.  Thanks again :)

Outstanding!  What a good bread.  I haven't made homemade bread in oh-so-many years.  Eggs baked up well, right inside the bread braids; only negative is that the food coloring leaked into the bread a bit.  Bread didn't need the whole baking time and I ended up adding about a 1/4C more flour than the recipe called for.  And it turned out so good!  Golden brown, very slightly sweet, didn't even need butter.  This will become a tradition now!

Very tasty bread and has a sweet hint - found that 50-55 minutes was a bit too long for cooking though - 30-35 minutes worked out better in my oven

I am not a baker by any means, but I try. Sometimes my baked goodies turn out and sometimes they just don't. :) While this ended up being fine in the end, it took a lot of elbow grease (and two tries) to get it there. In the interest of saving some time, I used my bread machine's basic dough setting for kneading and the first rise cycle. Initially, my dough seemed pretty wet but I figured it would eventually come together. It didn't. I had to make a second batch of dough and stop my bread machine multiple times to scrape the sides in order for my flour to mix thoroughly with the wet ingredients. When it was time to braid my loaf of bread, I also had problems. I'm not sure how anyone managed to get TWO, 3 ft. long, 1 1/2 in. wide ropes out of this amount of dough! I ended up making 2 smaller (1 ft., 1 1/2 in.) ropes and braiding them into a loaf instead of a wreath shape. My dough didn't seem to rise much either (2nd rise), but I continued on. Although aesthetically pleasing, my loaf was quite dense (but this didn't seem to bother those who ate it!). Other than my eggs sticking to the bread (it was impossible to remove them), I was pleased with the outcome. I'm not sure why my eggs stuck to the bread, but being that I only ended up using 3 of them, it wasn't a big deal. I was just glad they didn't bleed onto my dough! All in all, this was a fun project, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to attempt making this again. Thanks anyways, Marbalet. :-)

Okay, so i wanted to make a easy bread today just for fun and it turned out great. I use about 1/4 cup more of flour, only 1 egg, 1/2 tbsp more butter, and 1 tsp more milk. I am not sure if my oven cooks faster but the bread only took 23 minutes. I also did not use the eggs on top of the bread. After I brushed the butter on top of the bread I sprinkled sugar on top for a nice twist. It turned out great.

This was my first try and I thought it was wonderful.  I did have a little trouble rolling the dough to a long rope but it worked well until I connected the ends.  I want to make this again when I'm not so rushed and can take time to connect it properly.

This bread looked beautiful but the time was too long - I took it out of the oven after 45 minutes and it was a bit dark and dry (family still loved it though!).  Next time I make it I'm going to start watching it around 35 minutes.  [Also, I dyed the eggs using food coloring gel (several toothpick fulls) in a cup of hot water and 1/4 c. white vinegar.  The dye didn't run at all on the bread except for right where the egg was sitting.]

This was fantastic!  Exactly what I was looking for!  I did not add the colored eggs, but it looked very pretty braided.  Instead of brushing it with butter, I used an egg wash, so it came out very shiny (baked it uncovered for 20 minutes then tented it with foil for the remaining time to avoid over browning).  I also baked it on a sheet of parchment rather than a buttered cookie sheet, and clean up was super easy.

Easy to make, nice dough. It needed 1/4 cup extra flour. I made one following directions exactly and it was over cooked, dry and very dark brown. I made a second used an egg wash instead of melted butter and baked for only 30 minutes. It came out beautifully and everyone liked it. I plan to leave out the eggs and add herbs next time, my sister in law added food coloring to hers instead of the eggs and it was very cute.

Fabulous, not at all dry like some. Instead of brushing with butter, bake plain then when cool, spread on a confectionery sugar glaze with sprinkles. Adds a wow factor.

My family loves this traditional Italian Easter bread. I couldn't find my grandmother's recipe and therefore I was delighted when I discovered this recipe on AllRecipes. Just like grandma's! I added a bit more lemon zest! DELIGHTFUL! AN ITALIAN MUST-HAVE AT EASTER!

I made this bread last Easter and I'm making it again this year. This is the recipe I had been looking for.     It tastes just like the bread the little old Hungarian ladies from my old neighborhood used to make every year. Without ever seeing the loaf, an older eastern European guest at the Easter celebration identified it as soon as she tasted the piece she was served.  Super easy to make, and pretty as can be. I dyed my eggs before baking but they came out a little pale so I just carefully painted a little more color on them after they were done baking. Didn't think to take a picture until it was too late though; this year I'll post pictures. FYI a large pizza pan works great for slightly bigger loaves.

Beautiful, tasty bread! Tasted just like the rolls you can get in nice restaurants. Had to use about 1 cup more of flour to get it to the right consistency.

My original recipe (which I lost)called for the zest of one medium-sized lemon which adds a nice light lemony flavor to the bread.  I usually put the ingredients in my breadmaker on the dough cycle with the wet ingredients on the bottom and dry on top, eliminating steps 1-3.  Sprinkles on top do add a nice, festive feel (don't brush the dyed eggs with butter!).

I knocked a star off because the bleeding of the color from the eggs onto the bread took away from the presentation a bit.  I died the eggs the day before and kept them refrigerated until the last minute and they still bled like crazy BUT without the bleeding, it would have been a beautiful centerpiece to the table as guests sat down.  Also, 25 minutes in the oven tops!  And this made wonderful, and I mean wonderful bread.

Sorry Holly, but this was disappointing. I don't know what went wrong since I followed the instructions to the letter, except for baking time which had to be shortened at the suggestion of other reviewers, and I have made yeast breads in the past. I had to add extra flour just to knead the dough because it was a sticky mess. It didn't seem to rise properly and I used fresh yeast, covered it with a damp towel and kept it in a warm place. While it was baking, one of the eggshells popped! I haven't eaten the bread but so far, I'm upset with the results. I hope it tastes better than it looks.

Bread has a wonderful sweet flavor.  Makes a nice presentation, not to mention aroma filled the house!  Would cut the cooking time down approximately 10 minutes.

This bread smells so good while baking and the finished product looks amazing!  We will eat tomorrow for Easter, and I'm sure it will be awesome. I did have to add more flour...roughly 1/2 cup more...the dough would have been much too sticky of a consistency to work with.  My eggs only bled into the dough very little.  It helps to dry them completely!  I did paint with egg wash before baking.  This is definitely a winner!  For some reason it won't let me upload my picture :(  Happy Easter!

It has become a tradition now for me to make this for our Easter dinner.  The bread has just the right amount of sweetness and it looks wonderful with the dyed eggs.

This was okay..  It had an odd taste to it, so I wonder if I had done something wrong..  Everyone at the table ate some, so it wasn't a waste, but it was just okay.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! I didn't use eggs to decorate. Instead I braided the dough into a fancy looking bun. I had to add more flour to it because it was really runny (like 1 cup more), but it turned out awesome and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

The bread was fun to make, but it was too dry cooked for 27 minutes. I took it out of the oven at 20 an brushed it with more butter and put it back in for 7 minutes. If I hadn't put it back in it would have been perfect. I made 3 rolls, as I wanted to braid them together.  It tasted pretty good and it was fun to make, just too dry.

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it as is, added cinnamon, raisins etc. for hot cross buns, made loaves and braids. Always terrific. I have found consistently that the baking time is far too long. The recipe as is makes one very large loaf and took about 30 min to bake. Divided into 2 smaller loaves or into buns you would need to adjust time accordingly.

This bread had a wonderful flavor, not too sweet, and nicely yeasty.  It also had a lovely presentation, and was a big hit at our Easter dinner.  I am only rating this four stars because I had to make several changes.  Like others, I needed to add a full additional 1/2 cup of flour to get my dough to a workable state.  Also, I was only able to bake mine for 20 minutes before the top was so dark I had to take it out.  Fortunately, the bread was done, but the eggs were not cooked when I cracked one open.  I will definitely make this again, both with and without the eggs, but I will turn the oven temp down to 325 degrees, and bake for closer to 35 minutes. I also mixed mine on the dough cycle in my bread machine, removed it after the first punch down, then put it in a greased and covered bowl in the fridge overnight.  The next morning, I took it out, divided it, let it rest for 10 minutes, then formed the braid.  I also tried oiling my eggs, but that did not prevent color transfer.  It was minimal though, and didn't affect the flavor so I wasn't that concerned.  No one else was either because the bread disappeared!

This bread was super easy and really delicious! I grew up with this bread being made at Easter and made 4 loaves to bring for the people I'm spending Easter with. Its time consuming, but pretty easy. And came out so well! It only took 30 minutes of bake time, even for the biggest loaves I made. Next time I'm going to add raisins and dried fruit pieces like my mom used to!

I love this recipe and the final product.  It only took 20 minutes to bake to golden brown.  Glad I read the reviews.  Although I put the colored eggs deep in the bread, the color ran a bit.  Next time I will put small pieces of plastic wrap on the eggs when I put the wet warm towel on top of the final product for the last rising period.  Hopefully this will help with the color bleeding and losing color on top of the egg.  An impressive dish!

I made this last year for Easter, and the only complaint from my family I had about it was I didn't make enough cause some people were mad that they didn't get to eat it. It is very easy, and my husband told me that I have to make it this year. I will be making at least 4 to hand out to family. Thanks for sharing this easy and loving recipe.

i made this for a little party at a coworkers house. i baked cookies and placed them around the platter, and put candy in the center. the bread was sweet and soft on the inside, and the crust was just the right amount of toughness. Delicious and cute. people even ate the eggs.

Great bread!  It tastes and looks awesome.  I made this bread for 8 people, and doubled the recipe. Dye the eggs raw, nestle them in the bread, and once it is baked it is like the eggs are hard boiled.

I made the dough in my bread machine then followed the rest of the instructions as listed.  I did a little more sugar and the end result was great! I also only baked for about 30 minutes.  I made it the night before and wrapped it in cling wrap and it was fine the next day. My eggs did stain the bread a bit was was such a pretty centerpiece.  We did end up eating most of it as well.  Thanks so much!

I rarely rate a recipe this low but I can't think of anything about it that turned out right except that the eggs looked pretty.  I've made breads before and I followed the recipe exactly, and the dough was incredibly sticky, the braid was very difficult to make and looked like a big circle not a twist.  If it had at least tasted good I would've been OK with the way it looked, but it was horrible.  Not sure what went wrong.

This recipe turned out beautiful. I used my bread machine for the dough. I could have done a better job braiding the dough, but once it's baked it hardly seemed to make a difference. Looked beautiful. One star off for the baking time...50-55 minutes?! I am really glad I read the reviews otherwise I would have probably set a timer for say, 40 minutes or so and the bread would have already been really burned. Mine took about 25 minutes.

This is a great bread to make for an Easter brunch, or just for fun.  I proofed the yeast before adding it to the flour, sugar and salt.  To proof, dissolve a package of Active Dry Yeast in a 1/4c of warm water (about 100 degrees F) and a 1/4 tsp of sugar. The yeast should double in volume.   I also deducted 1/4c of milk from this recipe.  The mixture was sticky while I was kneading the bread, and I added flour as I kneaded.   I got a lot of compliments for this bread.

This was a big hit with my family.  The bread was delicious.  I only baked for 35 minutes, and that was perfect.  The eggs were perfectly cooked.

This is a nice recipe, but you need 3 cups of flour and if you bake it for 50 minutes it will be burnt to a crisp.  Thirty minutes was plenty.

This bread was so easy--and so festive!  I have only made one other bread in the past, and swore I would never do it again.  Then I found this recipe. I LOVE IT!  Like others said, add an extra 1/2 cup flour before kneading. Also, someone else said the eggs were not edible after baking, but mine were fine to eat I used hard boiled dye eggs from food dye (not a kit dye)!...ENJOY!

Per reviewers' suggestions, I added approx. 1/3 cup of flour to dough. I topped it with a light honey glaze and served with honey butter. Delicious & what a gorgeous presentation! I used colored eggs-- there were no problems with the color bleeding for me, and they looked great even when one egg decided to roll out onto the outside of the ring after rising. UPDATE: After a bit (later in the afternoon, and especially the next day) the bread was tough and hard to eat. I'll still make again, but hope it holds up better next time.

If you are looking for a delicious, impressive, and fun bread to make, this is it!!!!  
I followed the recipe exactly, the eggs were fine. I used a speckled-egg dye kit to make lightly dyed eggs to prevent any bleeding into the dough. 

I doubled the recipe and made 1 big loaf for us and 2 smaller ones to give away as gifts.  I got tons of compliments from everyone who saw them.  The finished breads were light, fluffy, yet rich and buttery, not to mention beautiful-looking!  These were supposed to be for Easter but there's nothing left but crumbs on a plate.  My husband ate almost the whole thing, and what little was left, I thinly sliced and used it for egg salad sandwiches made from the extra eggs we colored.  This will definitely be a treasured recipe for me from now on.  I'd giove it a hundred stars if I could! Thank you!!

This was really fun to have for Easter, although mine didn't look very pretty.  That's my fault though - I didn't do a very good job with the braiding!!  The bread's yummy and the eggs looked cute - they bled a little but nothing serious.  However, I don't know if I'll do this again because once a year isn't enough practice for me to get good at the braiding.  :-)  If you're more artistic and coordinated, this is fun to do! Try it with honey butter!

Delicious!  I had to add more flour, cut the baking time to 25 minutes, and yes the egg coloring did bleed a bit into the bread- but the taste was awesome- I made 4 of them and gave 3 away- everyone raved about them.  I added vanilla to the mix, and next time I'll grate some fresh lemon and orange zest in as well.

I liked this bread.  I didn't put any eggs in the braid but did add the two eggs to the dough.  Next time I'll only use one since it was a little too eggy for my taste.  Also, I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of flour because the dough was very sticky.  All in all very yummy and will make again!

I can not believe how easy this was to make!  I followed directions exactly and it looked great.  I did not have a bread machine and did not find it too difficult without one.  The only thing I would change next time is brushing it with butter before baking to get that shiny glazed look.

I think this recipe is great!  I do not bake bread a lot but this one was very easy.  I added extra flour because it was sticky and I only baked it for 28 minutes.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is the first time that I have made bread.  It came out beautiful.  I washed the eggs and put them into the bread before dying them.  Once the bread was done, I dyed the eggs and put them back into the holes I created with the eggs.  I would suggest putting a little bit of egg whites on top to make the bread look shiny.

Good recipe. I made this last year for Good Friday. I added slivered almonds and golden raisins. When it was still warm I put some vanilla frosting and sprinkles on top. I am going to make this again on Good Friday this year. Thanks for sharing.

I was pretty nervous to try this recipe, as I had never made homemade bread before.  However, it turned out WONDERFULLY!  It was extremely soft on the inside, and nicely browned on the outside.  I took this to the office since my husband and I couldn't eat it all ourselves, and everyone loved it.  I'll be bringing this to my family's Easter dinner in the future!! Thank you marbalet!

This was my first bread project, ever! I was very pleased at how easy it was! However, I ended up burning the outside because my oven's . I can never seem to get it to work right. Next time I'll try at a lower temp, for there WILL be a next time! Only thing I didn't do is add the extra eggs. Love this recipe!

Very good except mine was overdone. The reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is due to inaccurate baking time. I even reduced my bake time to 40 minutes and it was dry. Next time I will take it out around 30ish mins as someone suggested. This is a beautiful presentation Easter bread! My food coloring-dyed eggs bled into the bread as well, and I inserted them well into the braid. It's ok, just adds to the dramatic look. My eggs were multicolored, but I read on Greek websites that traditional Tsoureki  Pascha has only red eggs to represent blood of Christ.

Baked this for Easter Sunday Dinner.  Makes a beautiful addition to the table.  Everyone loved the bread but hated to slice into it and mess up the pretty bread.  But, after the first bite they destroyed the pretty and left the crumbs!  Thank you for sharing the Easter Egg Bread.

Awesome recipe! This was my first attempt at making bread and it was very easy to do.  I think it needs a little salt or maybe a little more sugar (or both) BUT its great as is.  My husband was in awe (he's not much of a baker) when I told him the raw, dyed eggs would bake with the bread.  He loved it.  We will most definately make this again in the near futre but maybe without the eggs, make it into a braided loaf instead of a wreath and use it for sandwiches. Oh, and my eggs were completely done.

I was so excited when i found this recipe because it's such a great idea for Easter and fun to make! This was also my first time even making bread! For the first setting time i extended it for overnight: I put it out at i think 7:00pm and put it in the fridge at 9:30pm and in the morning I took it out at about 6:00am and continued at 10:30, so, yeah, I extended it!  It was pretty fun to make and memories came back as I dyed the eggs! The only bad thing about it was that it came out a little dry. I think I know why, LOL. I will definitly make this again, and precisely. Thanks!

doesn't taste like Easter Bread at all.  It was way too dry (and I didn't refrigerate it) and not sweet enough.  It completely lacked the flavor of the Easter bread that I am used to eating.  I won't be making this again.

This bread was fun to make and it tasted great!  I did not like that I had to refrigerate it though because that dried the bread out.  I think next time I may skip the eggs and put them with the bread later on the side.

i got a late start on this the day before easter. so when it was almost double in size (first rise) i coverd it with plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge. 5 hours later i took it out, brought it to room temp with some help from my oven. then followed the directions as the recipe says. i dyed my eggs in a food coloring, water and vinegar mix for +24 hrs. rinsed and dryed and the color still ran. before i baked i brushed with an egg wash, i only had to bake it for 20 mins. after the bread came out of the oven i brushed with unsalted butter. the eggs couldnt be eaten, still raw. my 3 y/o daughter said this was her favorite bread ever and she wasnt gonna share it with anyone. this is a gonna be a new easter tradition for us. i am also gonna start making this for other family get togethers and just leave out the whole colored eggs. by the way im new to making yeast breads and this recipe worked out perfect for me.

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  Like others, I did have to add more flour (an extra cup) to kneed with, no big deal though.  I also cut my baking time down to 25 minutes and that worked perfectly.  I made two rings, one to give and one to keep.  We ate ours straight from the oven and didn't have a bite left.  I wrapped the second one and gave it away the next day.  I am anxious to hear if it was dry or not (previous reviews said it was a bit dry and hard the following day).  I also took the advise of another review and exchanged the white eggs that I baked in the bread with boiled and dyed easter eggs after it came out of the oven.  I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful presentation.  Thank you Holly for a wonderful recipe! ***UPDATE*** I was told that the bread wasn't hard at all the next day.  Maybe they said that not to hurt my feelings or maybe it is true, lol!  I also remembered that I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and maybe that had something to do with it.

This bread turned out great and was easy to make! I did need to add more flour and the cook time was too long but that could have been my oven! I did not use eggs so I cannot comment on that. Overall a delicious bread recipe. I will be making again.

I am an eleven year old girl and I LOVE to bake.  This was the first time I made this.  I saw it at a local Shoprite and I thought it looked cool so I tryed it.  I shortened the baking time to about 35 minutes and it came out great.  If you make this and it doesn't come out perfect don't worry because then it looks like it was really homemade!  Tip: for your eggs, I hard boiled them and dyed them ONLY solid colors.  I thought this was great and will definitly made it next Easter.  Also make sure you have plenty of time.  It is an all day project. One more thing, I added more flour when kneading occured.  Great photo and recipe!!!

Fun and easy Easter recipe.  I too, had to add a bit more flour in the kneading process.  Instead of twisting the bread I split it into 3 ropes and did a traditional braid.  Instead of brushing the raised braid before putting it into the oven, I used an egg wash (1 egg beat with 1 Tbsp. of milk).  My baking time was considerably less...25 minutes instead of 50 minutes (it would have been burnt to a crisp!).  It sure is pretty, though.

My aunt used to make this every easter but I think she put anise and almonds in it. She told me that you can bake the bread with undyed eggs and then dye them after you cook the bread.

I made this bread on Easter morning.  I tasted great but a little dry.  I would probably add some additional butter to the recipe. I too, added more flour (about a 1/2 cup) and only cooked the bread for 25 min. as others suggested.  The egg dye bled into the bread even when I added the olive oil so I am not sure how to prevent that from happening. Overall, I would probably use pastel colored dyes and or add the eggs at the end.  But taste wise it's a winner.

Wow.  It has been a long time since I made a yeast bread and it turned out delicious.  Made it exactly as stated but ended up needing a little more flour when kneeding so it wouldn't be sticky.  I also died my eggs and dried them off before putting them in the bread and the color still bled.  It might be because the butter I brushed on top dripped onto the eggs.  I also recommend putting the eggs far into the bread as possible because when cooking the bread pushed out two of my eggs. (I had to wait for it to cool and put them back into their holes.  I cooked for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  [The eggs that baked were unedible when opened.]  I will make this again next Easter.

This bread is excellent.  I did use more flour until the dough was smooth and elastic as other users had.  I did not use butter but egg wash and topped with multi-color sprinkles before putting in the oven.  The loaves baked beautifully and perfectly. The taste is delicious.
I did not use colored eggs but if I had I would have lightly rubbed them with olive oil before slipping in dough to prevent color running.  White eggs looked great too. An idea:  you can make 2 smaller loaves instead of one large one with one recipe.  I found this useful for gift giving.  Thank you for this recipe.  My family and friends have enjoyed it very much.

Thank you so much for this recipe.

I've NEVER made bread before except in my bread machine, but this recipe looked easy enough and I must say I impressed myself!!

I shortened the baking time to about 1/2 hour and I too had to add flour to avoid the dough being sticky.  I also glazed the dough with a mixture of butter and egg white so I had a beautful golden glazed ring when I was done.

It did take me a while to figure out how to get the end pieces together and still look pretty (guess becuase I'm a newbie bread maker).

Again, this was awesome and my family says this is our new Easter tradition!

I made this for Easter and the family enjoyed it. My sister-in-law said it was the best she's ever had. I don't know...I think I would've like a slightly eggier bread. But it was good.  This bread should have an egg wash if you want that shiny crust that appears in the attached photo.

new bakers should be careful on the recipe to not heat the oven to 350° until the end ov the second proofing. the instructions read a little confusing and i seen someone actually did try to proof the bread at 350°.  Otherwise, it is a lovely bread and thank you for sharing it. next time i will add some anise seeds and orange zest. It really does do nicely with 1/2 cup sugar instead ov 1/4. Also an egg wash baste leaves a nice sheen for a smooth shiny crust instead ov butter. Lastly, start checking your bread around 20 minutes. i pulled mine out at 23 minutes and it was just starting to get too dark. i think 21 or 22 minutes would have been perfect in my small oven.

I guess I messed up using too much flour when kneeding because it was very sticky, result was a very dry bread. I think this was also attributed to the baking time, I baked it for only 1/2 hour, if longer it would have burned.  The birds got mine.

Made exact to recipe in bread maker. I used plastic eggs to hold the spaces for the eggs during the last rise and replaced them with real eggs for cooking. Popped out the cooked eggs and put the plastic ones back to serve.

My eggs didn't transfer their dye at all! I was super impressed this worked out so well my first time making it.  I just dyed the eggs until the colors were vivid and dried them gently by patting them with a paper towel before putting in the dough.  Also if you don't want the damp towel to wash off your egg dye or make weird towel marks on the eggs(while also saving your kitchen towels from being dyed) use a greased piece of plastic wrap instead for the second rise instead of the damp towel.  It works just as well if not better!  I also brushed on melted butter after it was baked and only baked for about 40 min which was perfect.  This was a big hit at my inlaw's easter dinner.  Everyone was so impressed asking me how i did this. I have now been officially been given dessert duty for every dinner for eternity which I'm OK with. Also I doubled the sugar inside for more of a dessert and added vanilla glaze to the top with sprinkles for fun.

I followed the recipe meticulously and it never turned out.  I left it to rise for about 3 hours, which it barely did, then went through the next steps still.  Total flop.

This came out fabulous.  I reduced the heat to 320 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out nicely browned and soft and moist. I used 3/4 of a cup of sugar to make it more sweet and while kneading used about another 1/2-3/4 c of flour. I used an egg wash before baking and voila. Making this again for sure!

This recipe is very easy. I followed it exactly an achieved a wonderful result visually. The problem comes with the eggs. Extricating them from the baked bread is difficult. I thought that I could remove the cooked eggs and replace them with plastic eggs of similar size. However, the eggs are difficult to remove, sometimes breaking apart. Even if the eggs are removed in one piece, the aesthetic appearance of the bread becomes damaged and unsuitable to use as a centerpiece. If I make this bread again, I will  just use it as a centerpiece and discard  it afterwards. It is beautiful, if you can keep it intact.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, wanting to create a really special Easter Bread for this year's holiday. The high review count pulled me in, and it wasn't until I was ready to knead the dough I knew things were going to go horribly. I began reading the poor reviews, and most of them are accurate. The measurements to this recipe are not correct. You will end up with something closer to pancake batter, then whether you begin adding flour and amending in the mixing bowl in hopes to knead, or you do so on the counter, you end up with a recipe heavily dominated with components sure to give you a dry bland bread that may or may not rise.

I'm horribly disappointed. Recommend this recipe to no one - and encourage people to continue reviewing. With a bit more due diligence on my end I could have saved my Easter, and my afternoon, because, oh yeah, the prep time isn't accurate either.

The recipe was easy, and I was so excited. I spent all morning on it with waiting for it to rise and whatnot. I baked it on the shorter side for 50 mins at 350 degrees and it's hard as a brick. My oven doesn't cook high and I've never burnt anything before. 50 mins is way too long. I can't bring this to feed to my friends for Easter dinner. I'm devastated. I don't have time to make another one and the grocery stores around here don't seem to make Easter bread. If I ever do this again I'd check it at 30 mins to see what it looks like.

I LOVE this recipe! However I have a funny story to tell. This year I decided to make the bread without the eggs as I am having a lot of overnight company and didn't want to be busy the day of the meal or the day before. So...I emailed my family and asked if anyone would mind if the bread had the coloured eggs separate from the bread. Well, my family are known for their offbeat humour and I got some interesting responses from "Well, then we just won't come!" to "Well then, I'm going to bring some food coloring to pour on the bread so it looks authentic"(this because some of the dye always seemed to leak onto the bread).  The problem is that though the bread looks and tastes wonderful we always wasted a lot as people were suspicious of whether the eggs were properly cooked or not. So this year a change in tradition from 1993 till 2014.And we'll all have a good laugh:)

I gave this 5 stars because of all the memories it conjured up about my childhood and my grandmother.  This was excellent bread and I'm going to start a tradition my grandmother had with it.  Instead of Easter baskets we all received our own loaf of bread.  I did a test run to make sure this was good and the kids already ate it all. I did use my bread maker for the dough which made it so easy. And since I made individual loaves I cooked for shorter period of time.

First time making Easter bread - this recipe was great! I used more flour for kneading and rolling and I shortened the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes - the family loved it including my  born and raised in Italy Father in law!!! (Added sprinkles before baking)

Yum!!!!! Ingredients were simple & making it was actually fun - I don't usually bake with yeast & so I was a bit scared that I might mess it up, but followed the recipe - and the advise on some reviews kept an eye on the bread and it was done in 25-30 minutes.....everyone loved it - made 2 & they were gobbled up!!!! Will make again for sure! Thanks for sharing??

i had to add almost an extra cup of flour to create a dough for kneading.
and cooked for 23 minutes instead of the stated 50-55 minutes.
otherwise everything was fine.
i will try adding another egg and more sugar next time

The eggs were real pretty but the bread was basic white bread. If I try this again, I will use honey.

I made this today but started the process last night and it turned out wonderful!  After i divided the dough into two balls i refrigerated the dough with a damp towel and then saran wrapped it.  The next day i turned on the oven and set the dough on the counter near the oven to let it rise.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it was delicious.

This turned out great!! Tasted just like my grandma's coffee cake w/o the sugar on top, and not as crumbly. I did have to add a lot more flour, as other people said. But I did cook it for the whole 50 minutes - I did take the eggs out around 30 mins in. Next time I would use white eggs and then dye them after - they come out very easily. OH and I have to note that this was my first successful attempt at using yeast!

LOVED this bread!  Super easy to make.  But as others have said: at least another cup of flour (I still needed more) and MUCH less baking time (barely 30 minutes)

This is the second year in a row that I have made this bread at Easter.  I cut the baking time by about 7 minutes. It was perfect. Last year it seemed a bit over done.

I planned to color eggs with my Brownie troop and found this recipe so I decided to make the dough ahead of time and have them shape and bake the bread during our meeting...what a hit!! The girls were so proud to show their parent what they made and the recipe was delicious.  Thank your for your recipe.

Great recipe!!  My family gobbled it up.  I do have to agree with one poster that it definitely tastes better warmed with honey butter.  Delish!!  Will make again and again.

This was a great idea! I loved how it looked on the table, very cute. The bread was very tasty as well. I did forget to add the butter when I mixed it all together, so I just kneaded it slowly into the bread. Just in case that ever happens to anyone. Probably won't but you never know. Thanks for the recipe :)

Bread was very easy to make. I put the mixture into my bread machine and when that was done I braided it and baked it in my oven.  I do like a sweeter tasting bread for Easter so maybe next time, I will tweek it by adding egg whites mixed with a little sugar to coat the top! Other than that my family ate it up, right out of the oven!

Not for beginner cooks!  This was fairly hard to make because of the temperatures necessary to get the dough to rise.  I had dye bleed problems with the eggs, but it looked so pretty either way.  I drizzle with honey while it is hot.  Family favorite.

Wow, made a loaf easter morning and should have made two (or three!). Was literally the first thing to go. Moist, soft great flavor. The egg dye was intense and deep, but it ran (i used vinegar and food coloring, rinsed and patted dry, but it didn't matter; made pretty multi-colored bread, had no effect on flavor). Now I have to make another loaf for my family!

Wonderful bread. My Mom made this every year growing up and now I have made it for myself the last 2 years. I have very little experience with yeast and the dough is a bit sticky to work with at first but it always turns out just right. The taste reminds me of challah bread a bit. The twisted bread segments break off into the perfect roll size serving.

I made this and thouht it was very good.  I added a little more flour than it called for because the dough was too sticky and not pulling away from the bowl.  I baked it for 30 minutes.  The egg inside could've maybe used an extra five minutes, but over all it was very tasty.  When it came out of the oven I topped it with honey while it was warm and colorful sprinkles.  Very pretty presentation.  I would make this recipe again.

My Mom made this when I was a kid. She got the recipe from some magazine. As time passed the recipe was lost and I looked everywhere for something like it. Finally I came across this and You can't tell the difference.This bread is wonderful and a real conversation piece. It makes a beautiful centerpiece with or without the dyed eggs. I get rave reviews and just can't make enough!!!It is well worth the effort.

I made two of these for Easter brunch.  Everyone commented on how beautiful it was and how delicious it was.  It is a bit dry but add some butter to your slice and it is great.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour when I made it as others had suggested and that helped a lot.  Will definitely make this again next year.

This recipe was SO MUCH FUN to make!! Yes, the eggs did bleed (I rinsed them in water and dried them off well, but to no avail). And I did have to add a few extra fistfuls of flour to battle the stickiness as I kneaded. But it didn't take away from the end result. My Czech in-laws said it was "krasny" (beautiful). The bread was delicious and didn't last long!
But the best part of all was that the dough was easy to make and rose beautifully. I will use this dough from the recipe all the time now to make normal loaves of bread throughout the year!

I had a really hard time with this.  I think that I over worked the dough when mixing it. I am not much of a baker.  The dough was hard to roll out.  I also should have put the eggs in the middle like in the picture.  But followed the recipe and put in the braid of the bread.  It looked very neat but was hard when serving.  Also my eggs weren't done when my bread was done.  But I had a casserole in the oven with the bread.  Which may have affected it.  The taste of the bread was excellent, just more dense than I think it was supposed to be.

This recipe is a good starting point for the bread but is incomplete. It requires about a cup to a cup and a half more flour in order for it to be a dough that can be kneaded. The directions as they are yields a super sticky, wet dough that is hard to work with so by adding the additional flour it makes it more workable. Once all the risings were done and the bread was ready to go in the oven I brushed it lightly with an egg white wash before putting it in the oven. Also watch the time. It may take less than the full half hour for it to be done.

First time bread maker. Picked this because it seemed easy. Watch the video. It saved ours. We did 4 rings and the first one was a problem. Where is says 'beat', stick with a wooded wooden spoon, also the flour amount...is not enough. The video says "about 2 1/2 cups". Needed at least another 1/2 c to get the right consistancy to kneed it.

this was amazing! very yummy! My husband who hates bread really enjoyed this. He asks for it all the time now.  As a busy mom of six boys, this is fast to refer to in my busy schedule.  This was great, but made some changes. First, instead of the eggs  i substituted ground beef. Then, rather bread ingredients, i used some taco seasoning that I had laying around and served it in cute taco shells...It was amazing.

This is absolutely amazing! It is the best Easter bread I've ever eaten; very light and tender.  I would caution anyone though that the directions state to "preheat oven to 350" then directions are given to divide the dough for a second raising for 45 minutes.  It makes it seem like the dough should go into the oven at 350 to raise for 45 minutes. Don't do that! The oven should be preheated after it raises the 45 minutes, lol.  I added 1/2 cup diced, candied fruit and 1/2 cup slivered almonds and some anise seed and upped the sugar to 1/3 cup. I used an egg wash to make it shiny. The colored, raw eggs cooked perfectly; I baked it at 350 for 23 minutes on the bottom shelf.  After it cooled I made a glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla, melted butter, Sweet Italian Coffee Creamer, and a pinch of salt, then decorated it with sprinkles.  This is the perfect Easter Bread

Very good taste and pretty easy.  
If kneeding by hand, be ready for a sticky dough.  Don't over kneed and/or add flour as it will make the dough too firm.  Add 1 tsp of anise extract if you'd like.  I made it 3 times - more pressure, less pressure, more flour, less flour, anise and without not.  My favorite was with anise extract and less handling.  Good luck!

I took some liberties with the flavoring of this bread and made it sort of an Easter braid and hot cross bun combo. I used dark brown sugar in place of white; and added in cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, orange zest, and raisins. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the additional flavorings, and I got an amazingly delicious and beautiful Easter braid! I egg washed it before baking and then added a glaze of orange juice, orange zest, and powdered sugar after it baked for a little extra shine and flavor; and then added some sanding sugars just for extra decoration. This is just perfect, and I highly recommend adding the spices/extract/zest for a different variation! Thank you for the recipe!

I always make this bread around Easter and each year it turns out really well. However, I generally use my bread machine and put the machine on the dough cycle. This does make making this bread a bit longer but...it has always turned out great and always turns out really well. Yet...I do not follow the way the recipe has and I follow the way the machine tells me to do it by adding wet ingredients first and then the dry ingredients, but it always works and turns out a really great loaf of bread.

This was an incredible recipe!! So easy and delicious!! I did find that I had to let the dough rise a little longer than what was suggested, and I added a bit more flour. To glaze, I did an egg wash before baking, and then sprinkled some sugar when it came out of the oven. Such a traditional recipe!!

The traditional flavoring for this bread is Anise.  Add 1 teaspoon of Anise flavoring to the liquid ingredients before adding them to the dry ingredients.  This bread goes generations back in my family...its a wonderful treat at Easter.  Individual 'nests' of bread containing one egg can be made for guests to take home or to give to the children as a special treat.

This recipe is excellent. I made it twice, once on Easter and once today, two days later. Both times I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour. Today, I left out the hard boiled eggs and placed the braided dough diagonally across the baking sheet, to form a loaf. Also, I used an egg wash to give it a shiny brown crust. Fantastic!

I wanted to test this before making it for Easter dinner.  I put the ingredients in my bread machine to make the dough.  Then followed the recipe.  I didn't  put the eggs in and used an egg wash instead of melted butter.  The bread has a great taste and texture.  It will be at Easter dinner.

Easy, beautiful and satisfying.   I followed all ingredients and mixing as directed in recipe. When prepping, plan enough time for dough to rise a couple of different times as stated in recipe. If dough feels too wet while kneading, just add a little extra flour.  As  previous reviewers stated, this bread bakes quickly.  My bread took 25 minutes to bake... check after 10 minutes to see if it is browning  and turn baking sheet.  I followed advice of previous reviewers and rinsed and dried my colored eggs to prevent dye from bleeding on braided bread.

This was my first attempt at making bread without using the bread machine and it turned out great! I was worried when the dough didn't double its size on the 1st proof, but it rose nicely after I braided it. 50 mins is way to long to bake, mine was done after 25. It tasted great and the family loved it. I omitted the eggs simply because I had too many hard boiled eggs already, but I used those to decorate the middle of the ring. I will definitely make this again next year and make sure to add the eggs.

I  would have given it five stars but this recipe does not give enough raising time. I have been making this bread with a family recipe for over35 years this  one should have much more time to raise.  First time one hour .  then you knead it for about ten minutes.  Let it raise 2 more hours.  And knead again..  Then make your braiides and let it raise for two more hours around the eggs.  Noe it's finally time to bake. 30 minutes.brush egg wash on and cook 115moreminutes to perfection. Good luck, it will be beautiful..l promise.  Linda palumbo

This recipe is a lot of fun and yielded a great treat. I did notice that some folks may have failed to re-hydrate the yeast before mixing it with the other ingredients and may have skipped the final rise before going into the over. The recipe could be improved by spelling these steps  out for new bakers :-)

First time ever making Easter bread and it turned out fantastic! But watch the time as everyone says, it didn't take as long to bake. Delish and I will be making this one again in the future.

The flavor and color of this was great. However, it took way longer to rise than what the recipe stats. I will make this again but may add more sugar next time.

Great! This was my second attempt since the dog ate the first one I made while it was rising outside in the sun (she was lucky it was a holy day). I only had six eggs left so two in the bread and four on top just in time for Easter dinner. It was a huge hit and everyone loved it. Light and slightly doughy. I probably could've taken it out of the oven after 35-40 min.

I had a lot of fun making this bread! As others have noted be sure to keep an eye on your bread in the oven. Ours only baked about 20 minutes before it was ready.

The ingredients were right on.  I would add flour as  I was kneading the dough when it started to stick to my board.  I let it rise in the oiled bowl and just a bare sprinkle of flour it prevent it from sticking when I was making the long roll.  I didn't put eggs in it but sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Saved it and will make again.

This is a very nostalgic recipe that was wonderful to make.  It was fairly easy and it only had to bake for 20 minutes.  I actually used pre-dyed eggs from the supermarket that never blended into the dough.  I also basted the dough with egg yolk before baking to give it that pretty glow.  Would definitely do it again.

I made this yesterday for my husband's family. This will now become a tradition... they asked me to make for next year! the colored eggs in the bread are very impressive. I'm now making another loaf today :) the sweetness of the bread is addictive, plus my whole house smells amazing. Thanks for the post.

I threw everything into my bread machine and ran the dough cycle.  Mine burned ever so slightly so I would agree to reduce the baking time - check it at 30 or 35 minutes.  I took mine out at 40.  It was still good, though - very slightly sweet bread, kind of reminds me of Portuguese sweet bread we used to get as a kid.  My eggs weren't that attractive when done - little blotches appeared during baking time - but this was still a fun project!

I have made this bread for Easter for two years.  Unfortunately, though the bread is yummy, the eggs really do cook and it is really impressive looking....NO ONE EATS IT!   I find my guests are a little put off by the eggs.   Sorry!  But I won't make this again.

Came out beautifully and it tasted great.  It was a little dry but I don't know if that was because of my lack of bread making skills or because of the recipe!

This was a lovely dough to work with and the presentation was beautiful. I made this on Good Friday with the intentions of serving it on Easter Sunday but my MIL said that it would get too hard by then, so we ended up eating it the same day I made it. Everyone really loved the fact that it had just the right amount of sweetness. To help with the stickiness (and to avoid a lot of cleanup) I continued kneading the dough in the bowl and added an extra 3 tbsp of flour, kneading well after each addition. I then brushed the dough with milk just before baking and baked it for 30 minutes rather than 50-50 minutes as suggested in the recipe. I wish I would have taken it out sooner, though. Also, to save some time I purchased ready-dyed eggs from the grocery store but they still ended up bleeding a little as others mentioned. My MIL gave me an awesome idea to try this recipe next time with raisins and rolled out as buns. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. Will make again and again!

It was very pretty, but not great tasting.  I needed to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of extra flour before I could knead it properly; it was so sticky.  The bread was slightly sweet, but so dry and very crumbly.  I took it out at 42 minutes and it probably should have been taken out much sooner.

This was a terrific recipe! My grandmother used to make easter bread and I always wanted to make it for my children. It was easy to follow and came out exactly as shown. I heated some honey and drizzled it over the bread as it was cooling. My kids loved it so much I made another one for my sister who ate half on her own!

I made this the day before Easter and it looked great.  Everyone thought I bought it at a bakery. I made sure to rinse the heck out of my colored eggs before I put them in the dough.  They were a little pale, but still had some color to them. On Easter, I warmed it just slightly and it was a little dry.  The eggs turned out fine.  I will make this again if I intend to eat it the day I bake it.

I have trying make bread from scratch now for about a year now and have been unsuccessful.  This recipe was the only one that I've tried that came out perfect.  It was buttery, had a sweet taste and needless to say it was eatable.  I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely use this recipe from now on.

I love this recipe.  This is the second year in a row that I made it.  The colored easter eggs bled into the bread but not bad enough to not make it.  It's very cute and a great idea.  I also had to add some additional flour so the dough wouldn't be too sticky but it worked fine.  A recipe for egg challah would work well too.
