My Lebanese mother made this but used pine nuts instead of walnuts and used potatoes only when it was made as a stew in a pot (not baked). Also, peel the eggplant before slicing.

Delicious! I used 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can stewed. I also used halal veal chunks (ribs, roast, etc) and baby eggplant (sliced). So good! The only suggestion is it needs more flavor, so I threw in a few whole cloves of garlic. This made all the difference.

This was very good and different. Even my husband liked it. I did add some garlic and extra spices. Next time , I will add a extra can of tomatoes and I'll cover it w/foil. It took forever to cook uncovered and the top was a little dry. I will make it again, with those suggestions

I really loved this easy recipe.  I did cover for first hour, then cooked and additional 1/2hour so potatoes were cooked thoroughly.  I was also heavy handed with the garlic.  I didn't have any flatbread, so I baked some lightly oiled tortillas as a substitute (the oven was already on--so why not), and that worked out perfect.  My 5 year old asked me to keep it in her special folder so she could make it for her kids some day:)  Very kid friendly, healthy meal.

This was awesome, though I also customized it quite a bit with red onion, garlic, cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, coriander, etc. After half and hour I topped it with crumbled feta and fresh parsley, baked for another 25 minutes, then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes.

Really delicious!  I added some feta cheese and made up my own "lebanese" spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc), but it all turned out well!

I'm giving this a 3 because it can be made into something good, but as is..not so good. First of all the time off. It takes longer to get stew meat and the potates cooked. Second, needs so much more flavor. After our first dish, I add it to a pot, simmered it and made more like a stew out of it. Added red pepper flaks, garlic and onion powder,coriander, and bay leaf. I add just a bit of broth, becasue I had so much liquid left over. Much better, but I'm not sure I would make it again. Though, I have to say the walnuts were a very nice touch. I think that was my favorite part.

Great dish, I used home made sauce instead of crushed tomatoes (as my boyfriend prefers) and it was a hit.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  We ate the leftovers for a few days, and I have to say that it was even better after being reheated!  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it could have more flavor.  But it wasn't bad- next time I'll play with some more herbs and spices.  I left out the walnuts because I wanted to serve it to my one-year old daughter without worrying about choking.  She loved it!  This was her first time having eggplant, and it was a big hit.

My Lebanese mother in law taught me this recipe. And as a casserole the eggplant should be peeled and sliced into 1/4 inch slices and rolled in egg and a 50/50 ratio of flour and cornmeal and browned then set aside.  Then take pine nuts and onion and brown those in butter or olive oil (the oil is healthier) until done and then use lean ground beef or ground sirloin and brown mixed with salt, pepper, garlic and all spice to taste.  Layer as instructed only use tomato sauce and bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes covered and serve over rice/vermicelli along with some warm bread....you will enjoy it thouroughly.

Great recipe, the only reason I gave it four stars was because I felt it needed more spices.   I added two cloves of garlic to the onions, and added some red pepper flakes into that part. I then mixed together paprika, cumin, coriander, black pepper and cinnamon and threw that into the meat mixture.  I do not eat red meat, so I used the soy version. Also, I peeled the eggplant. I will definitely make this again, very simple, and a hit!

I thought this sounded exotic, but it was very flat in taste.  I wish I had added the garlic as did other reviewers.  I don't know what spices are used in traditional Lebanese cooking, but this dish needed more punch.  Anyone know?  The walnuts were nice, but not enough to carry the dish in flavor.  Also, it took forever to get tender--more like 2 1/2 hours for me.  Maybe the acid from the tomatoes slows down the softening.

5 Stars reflect how delicious and easy this was to prepare.  However, needs adjusting for my oven.  I plan to cube eggplant  next time to make sure it is covered by liquid - the top layer didn't completely cook.

Might need to be covered during cooking to conserve moisture.  

I baked this in a new convection oven so don't know whether this played a role in the outcome.

After reading the other reviews I altered the recipe a bit.  I substituted 1 can of stewed tomatoes with one that had Italian seasoning and garlic.  I also added 2 garlic cloves to the meat and onion.  Lastly when adding the walnuts I added 1/2 of Chardonnay.  Baked it covered and it was yummy.
