This recipe has become a party standard for me. I changed a couple of things that really improved it for my needs. I used little baby 'bella shrooms so that this makes a great bite-sized hor dourves. I sub the on large turkey link with several small turkey breakfast links, cooked and chopped. I roll the stuffing into balls and pop it into the baby 'bellas. Then I roll the tops of each one in shredded Romano cheese. Even non-mushroom eaters seem to love this one.

This is a delicious recipe! I used baby bellas (about 10) because my grocery store did not have whole portabellos. I think next time I will try a little more flavorful sausage...I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs (progresso...99 cents!!) and it gave an interesting twist! I highly recommend this recipe. I could have just eaten the filling by itself!!

This is a great recipe--the flavor of the sausage and garlic combines very well with the texture and tang of the cream cheese.  I find that shortening the cooking time to 10-12 minutes actually saves the portobello from drying up.

These are scrumptuous even with the bread crumbs left out (for a low-carb main dish)!  If you do decide to go that route, cut down a little bit on the cayenne and black pepper.  The abscence of the bread crumbs concentrates the stuffing spices.  Also, I added 3 more sausage links and it was filling and wonderful.  I was only able to purchase the mushroom caps without the stems, so I just chopped up a medium-sized cap in place of the stems; it worked beautifully.

Way to much pepper in recipe. It was waaay too spicy and tasted only of pepper. Only a pinch would be recommended.

Fortunately I halved the amount of pepper called for, but still the recipe tasted only of pepper.  Why would anyone spend $7/lb on portobellos to totally disguise the flavor?

I stuck to the recipe as best as I could. After browning the one link of mild Italian sausage, I added the chopped mushroom stems, minced shallots, and garlic. I added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed Saltines. For the cream cheese, I found I needed about 4 oz. of plain cream cheese, and also added a few tablespoons of whipped chive cream cheese. I threw in a handful of shredded parmesan, stuffed my button mushrooms and baked in a mini muffin pan at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Fantastic! I honestly didn't think that one link would be enough- but it was plenty. I still have enough stuffing left over to fill at least a dozen more.  UPDATE: I froze my leftover stuffing and unthawed it today. I stuffed two portobellos with it and topped with parmesean cheese. It was still wonderful. I definitely recommend making extra stuffing to freeze for later!

The recipe was overall ok, the mushrooms turned out a little dry for my taste.  Make sure the cream cheese is very soft!!

I made these for a pot luck at work and they turned out wonderful! Everyone complimented on them and asked for the recipe. Being a garlic lover, I added a bit more garlic than called for. They were easy to make/ clean up and I definitely recommend them.

This recipe was a hit at a dinner party I attended....I did do a couple of things differently, which was the turkey sausage; I browned the meat on the stove top instead of the oven. I sauteed the garlic before adding to mixture; and I also used smaller mushrooms...It was gone in seconds.

Delicious! I used about 30 baby bella mushrooms and kept the rest of the recipe the same! OMG! So delicious! They were gone immediately! I stuck to the recipe except I added shredded romano to tops and broiled on low for a few minutes to get it melty! Wow!

VERY yummy!  I made mine using the large portabello caps.  Used 3 links of mild Italian turkey sausage, browned in pan, and 5 cloves of garlic put through the garlic press.  Also substituted fresh ground chipotle pepper for the cayenne, and used panko bread crumbs.  Served it as a main dish with a salad and some fresh bread - awesome meal!

I added some sauteed green onions and fresh spinach. Basically, this is a good starting point but you can adjust what you put in it. Adding shredded cheese, veggies, seasoning, etc.  Don't skip the cayenne - the heat balances out the creaminess. My husband was skeptical about this being enough food for him but raved about them all through dinner.

I didn't really follow the directions, but I used the idea and made my own version with what I had. I chopped up some beef summer sausage, mixed it into cream cheese with garlic seasoning, horseradish seasoning, and pepper. I used larger button mushrooms and grilled. YUM!!!

Used this for the base recipe for our mushrooms and they were SO good. Substituted the sausage with bacon, bread crumbs with pork rinds, portabella for button mushrooms. Added diced green pepper and the stems to filling, dash of poultry seasoning and additional parm. cheese on top. SO YUMMY! We are going to make this a Christmas tradition.

Amazing! Better than eating out! I will make often! I used the large mushroom caps and spicy pork sausage instead of the links.

My husband and I made this recipe and we plan to make it as an appetizer for our next get-together.  My children loved it too!  The only change we made was the type of sausage - we had ground sausage on hand so used that instead.

These were fantastic...with mods.  I drastically cut down on the cayenne and pepper, and they still had a kick.  I topped each 'shroom with a bit of butter and drizzled olive oil on them before baking, and I also used some butter in the stuffing mixture.

VERY SPICY but delicious.  I used turkey breakfast links and sauted the links with garlic.  I used a food processor to mix everything together and stored it in the fridge overnight.  I also decreased the cook time to 12 minutes and broiled it for a few minutes in the end.  I love spicy food so I of course loved the recipe but if you do not LOVE cayenne and pepper, you need to decrease the amounts.  Very filling and tasty, a definite keeper.

Made the following changes: Used spicy sausage, shallots instead of garlic, didn't have cream cheese substituted homemade cajun mayo.  Absolutely delicious with a nice flavor and a slight kick.  Will definitely make again.

We cooked the sausage with the garlic and the breadcrumbs in the pan and didn't "rest" the mixture before mixing it with the cream cheese and parmesan.  We also omitted the cayenne so that it wouldn't overpower the taste of the mushrooms.  Additionally, we only cooked them for 12 minutes.  It was VERY tasty!

This was veryyy good! I thought the mushrooms could use some seasoning themselves so I just made and emulsion of balsamic vinegar and olive oil,dipped mushrooms in it and then added the stuffing before putting them in the oven. They were awesome!

If you use fat free cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, the calories are reduced by 21 and the fat content by 3.3.

Weight Watchers points for the fat-free cream cheese version is 3.3 points.

I added onion and celery & added more garlic. I used bulk sausage instead of links and sauteed everything. I used shredded moz. cheese since that is all I had (about 1 1/2 c.). I added a small can of jalapeno peppers (drained) which really helped to spice it up and diced 2 small tomatoes (just because I had some to use) Bread crumbs and a little bit of spices. Baked about 20 min. Yummy!

Huge Hit... I used sweet sausage out of casing and then browned and before stuffing I put a drop of Sherry in the mushroom and then stuffed - using the meatball method mentioned in a prior review.  These were fun and easy!

My family really enjoyed these stuffed mushrooms.  I used a roll of breakfast sausage, and they turned out great.  Also, I topped them with shredded romano cheese for more flavor. Excellent!

These tasted pretty good for the first few minutes out of the oven, but once they started to cool, the cream cheese changed and the taste and texture started going downhill.  If I make these again, I'll use mozzarella instead.

This was ok but not as good as expected. Seemed like too much cream cheese as it's taste was a bit strong in the final product. I probably will not make this again.

Wonderful!!!  How simple and good!  I used ground turkey in place of the sausage and of course a few extra cloves of garlic!  Also I sprinkled the mushrooms with a dash of balsamic vinegar before placing the stuffing on top.  Served along side of spaghetti  tossed w/ butter and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  What an awesome recipe!!! Will definately make again :)

I used 1 pkg of spicy pork sausage and browned and crumbled that on that a stove and kept all other ingredient amounts the same.  I used 4 small containers of baby bella mushrooms and made this as an appetizer.  I also added some italian style shredded cheese to the filling.  It was delicious and a hit at Easter!  Thanks!

Ignoring the fact I got distrated, and  left them in the oven too long, we thought these were pretty good. I pretty much just eyeballed the seasoning. Thanks!

For me these were very good, I rated them a 4 star, but when I served these at my diner part, everyone raved!! From their reaction they could be a 5 star! I did not have the portabella mushrooms, so I used nice size white mushroom caps.

Delicious! Will be making again for sure.  Cut back on the pepper and cayenne and it was still quite flavorful, and mildly spicy.

I made these for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved them, even my parents who don't really like American food! They are very garlicy and the pepper gives it a little kick! I used dried italian bread crumbs. I also used baby bellas and used a heaping spoonful to stuff each one. But really, you don't need to stuff them that much since the filling is so flavorful. You really need to cook it on the stovetop though like the directions say (this makes it moister). Next time I will use less filling in each mushroom because I also like the taste of the mushroom with each bite.

Great appetizer or side dish! i omitted the parmesan cheese and used turkey breast instead of sausage.  I also added finely chopped zucchini and drizzled the portobellos with balsamic vinegar (after cooking them on a lightly greased pan for 10-15 minutes) before adding the rest of the ingredients (cooked on a separate pan).  They were so good I made them again the next day, this time omitting the turkey breast and using monterrey jack cheese only.  I will definitely make these again, thanks for sharing!

These were delicious! I did a couple things differently because I made a meal out of this.  I used four large portobello mushrooms. Sprayed the with a bit of cooking spray and salted them.  Heated a little bit of olive oil and chili oil in place of the cayenne with the garlic, chopped mushrooms and sausage (3 patties). I put the soften cream cheese in the skillet too and added a package of  (defrosted) frozen spinach and blended it together adding panko seasoned bread crumbs. Took off the heat and added some shredded Parmesan. Stuffed the mushrooms and baked for 25 minutes. Everyone loved them!!

This recipe was great. The taste was awesome. Even my mushroom haters ate this. I just have a question about why chopped garlic then crushed garlic? Does it alter the flavor or something? I just wondered. Thanks

These mushrooms were extremely good! I loved the firm, creamy texture and the flavor was out of this world. For guests without a taste for the spicy, you should cut down on the pepper. A must if you love mushrooms!

This was the first recipe I tried from this site. It was so delicious!!! I put less pepper in than you had suggested & it was to our taste. I will be back for more recipes in the future. Thanks!!
