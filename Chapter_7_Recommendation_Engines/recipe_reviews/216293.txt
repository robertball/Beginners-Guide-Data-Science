I added garlic & diced jalapeno to the chicken mixture. We like our food on the spicy side. Also used a whole cup of cheese. I was able to make 10 enchiladas. Will make again with a few adjustments.

I have made this recipe a number of times, the first time was a kid free weekend cause I didn't think my youngest would eat this, but he came home and I was having it as leftovers and he wanted a bite.... I was expecting him to spit it out but he so enjoyed it that I had to go heat him up his own!!! So it has become  a family favorite!!!!!! I only made one change as I am NOT a fan of corn tortillas I used flour instead and turned  out perfect for us!!

This was amazing even with the fat free Cream of Chicken soup! Even the granddaughters finished their dinner without being reminded. Great flavor, and consistency and best of all a breeze to prepare.

I didn't drain the green chilis & decreased the water to about 1/8 c, doubled the chicken after baking it seasoned with garlic, enchilada seasoning (lightly) and olive oil coated pan.  I added garlic, a pinch of cayenne pepper and filled the shells.  Made 7 with double the meat. Poured a can of green enchilada sauce over the top before adding twice the cheese.  All of the soup mixture was added to the meat.  With changes, we will fix it again!

Love this recipe! Every one in the family enjoys it. I use 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sour cream and flour tortillas. I add a garnish of tomatoes and fresh jalepeno's to it - that way they can make it as spicy as they want it. YUM!

I love this. However I never have enough sauce, so I double that. It's wonderful though.

We thought this was very good, but gave it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe.  Had chicken to use and did not want to go to the store.  Had no chilies so added 1/2 C. salsa.  Used 1/4 C. milk and 1/4 C. sour cream.  Put in a couple dashes of cumin. Spread a few Tbls. of sauce on the bottom of the dish. A wonderfully easy and delicious meal I will make again.

MMMMMM  Yummy, just as is or add more heat if you like.  I used a mix of the Mexican cheese and Pepper Jack.  Very good
