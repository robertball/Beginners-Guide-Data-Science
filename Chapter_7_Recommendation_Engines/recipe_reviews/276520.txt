AWESOME!  First I have to confess that I did not take time to brine this. I used this recipe for the instructions on prep and cooking time and method to take a 3 lb turkey breast and roast it in my air fryer for lunch meat.  It came out perfectly! I used olive oil to rub the breast and kickn chickn spice mix.  Best bird ever!  Thanks for this recipe!

I rubbed mine down with olive oil then patted it down with "Memphis Dry Rub."  Turned out really tasty.

This was super moist and so very delicious!  My family loved it (even more than our traditional turkey we cooked in the oven)!
