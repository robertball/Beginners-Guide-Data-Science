This recipe was delicious. I found that the first time i made it, there was not enough sauce for the noodles.  So, the second time i doubled up on the tomatoes and spices - perfect!!

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it taught me how to make delicious Swiss Steak, and the recipe is so easy to follow.  I have NEVER had round steak that was so tender.  Usually it's very tough.  This was so tender that I honestly cut the meat with my fork.  Unbelievable. Thank you for adding steps on how to use the mallet.  I've used a mallet before, but didn't know how to use it properly.  I tweaked the recipe just a little bit.  I halved the recipe because only two were eating.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes in place of regular tomatoes just because I think I had it that way before and I liked it.  It was great! I also cut up a medium to small onion into bite size pieces (not chopped), and for good measure I tossed a little onion powder in as well. I also cut the pepper in bite size pieces (and used just a tiny bit more than the recipe called for).  Like another reviewer wrote, I will double the sauce next time.  My gosh this was good!  I don't remember when I cooked a better meal. Seriously.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  SO, SO GOOD!! It will surely be a regular at our house. Try it - you'll like it.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This was great and very much like my Mothers delicious creation, but I  dont think she used a recipe. She had to feed 10 of us  so she was fairly creative with amounts and they varied.
I served it with mashed potatoes and it too was delicious. A definite fave for a traditional fall dinner.

Instead of simmering the meat with water, I added the can of tomatoes and its juice (the recipe doesn’t say whether or not to drain the tomatoes) to infuse the tomato flavor into the steak.  I can’t imagine swiss steak without onions, so I eliminated the onion powder and added freshly-sliced onion as well as a few green peas to give it some color.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans with mustard cream sauce and toasted almonds (recipe from this site).

My 58 years old wife, after 35 years of marriage, turned to me 3 minutes into this meal & said, this is the first Swiss steak I've ever liked in my entire life! I think that says it all! 

Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe in a pressure cooker and the meat was melt-in-your mouth.  30 Minutes in a stove-top 6 qt. pressure cooker.  The sauce was a bit soupy but that happens in a pressure cooker and can easily be cooked down to a more sauce-like consistency by reducing under head after you take the lid off the pressure cooker.  Very reminiscent of what my  mother used to make.   Great served with green beans and mashed potatoes, and a super way to use a cheaper cut of meat and have it taste like a million bucks.

Best recipe. I coated the meat with flour as Barb did. Added spices and added fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Again same as Barb.  I used 3 medium tomatoes for two steaks. I added water. I used wild meat which did not get soft but it tasted great. I didn't have any mushrooms or celery so I added what spices I could to bring in the flavour. It was very good anyways.

I have made Swiss steak before. I decided for this one I wanted to make some changes. I browned flour steak in frying pan. I put in a roaster after and added peppers,carrots,onions,mushrooms, garlic dice canned tomatoes,tomato paste ,cooking sherry, and about tsp of chilli. Put in oven for 2 hours. First night had with mash potatoes and the second night with basmati rice. Yummy!

OK, I made this, it was as delicious as my Aunt Gloria makes. That’s saying something. As you see in my pictures I did add a few carrots & celery when it was simmering. I served fresh green beans on the side and mashed potatoes. The meat was soooo tender! Wonderful comforting meal. Thanks for the memories, I sure love & miss my Auntie!!!  Yummy ??

I made this recipe as suggested except that I sliced the round steak prior to flouring and pounding, so I probably cooked it longer than I needed to. Even so, the meat was incredibly tender. 

This is a flavorful dish, and very much like my mom's. I will cut down on the salt next time and add a little rosemary or thyme, but even without, this makes a tasty meal.
