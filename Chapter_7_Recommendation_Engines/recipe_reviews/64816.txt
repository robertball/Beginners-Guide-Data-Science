I used a few tips from another reviewer and a few of my own tweaks, and you just can't go wrong by doing the following:  After slicing your eggplant, definitely salt the slices and let them dry for about an hour.  Rinse off, dip in egg and coat with italian season bread crumbs. Spray two rectangular cookie sheets with olive oil spray, and as another reviewer suggested, bake the eggplant for about 14 min on each side.  While the eggplant slices bake, saute half a sliced red onion and a couple cloves of chopped garlic.  When the eggplant is done, place in a dish, topped with the onions & garlic, then with 2 sliced roma tomatoes. Sprinkle basil and oregano over the tomatos (thanks again to another reviewer!), then top with shredded parmesan cheese and feta. Bake for 20 min. Absolutely delicious every time I've made it!!

Absolutely delicious!  To eliminate any bitterness in the eggplant; don't forget to salt your eggplant slices and leave them to drain in a colandar for an hour, rinse and prepare as directed.

I bread the eggplant, mist with olive oil spray, then bake it on a couple of cookie sheets, about 14 minutes on each side.  MUCH less oil this way.  Great with white or red onion.  I sprinkle the tomatoes with dried basil, oregano and a little garlic salt.   I skip the munster and just top with about a 1/4 cup of feta.  Put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to bubble the feta.  Love this recipe!

This is absolutely the best recipe I've ever made. I will never use another eggplant recipe, this is IT! It's so good. I didnt have Italian bread crumbs, used garlic crumbs and sprinkled a little Italian season on top. Ran short on egg mixture for dipping, also layering wasn't perfect, but didnt matter.I served it with Spinach Orzo salad, good combo. I will serve with Italian,or a Rustic bread next time! I am trying to post a picture for this recipe, hope it works. I love this recipe.

This is by far one of the best eggplant recipes out there!!  I vary the mozzarella with parmesan, or an italian cheese blend, whatever I have on hand.  When we have eggplant and tomatoes in the house I always make this dish!!  Just an FYI, it doesn't freeze all that well, but was still good reheated.

This was very tasty even though I had to use different cheeses.  Love it.  Next time might try it with a marinara sauce on top.  I did fry the onion and tomato before adding to the baking dish.  Eggplant takes lots of oil to fry, so I alternated between oil and cooking spray. Thanks!

Oh my gosh! This is the best thing I have eaten in ages. All 3 kids devoured it. Broke my heart their were no left overs.   I did not have feta so I used some fresh mozzarella. My only bread crumbs on hand where panko-I think they may have worked better because they stayed really crunchy. It probably is just as good the way it is written though.

I am rating this on how my dish came out, not necessarily the actual recipe, although it is a good one. I simply took the advise of some of the other reviews which suggested to do a few things differently. I salted the eggplant slices and let sit for at least an hour, then rinsed, before breading, which takes out any bitterness. I breaded the eggplant and baked it for 14 minutes on each side. Baking definitely left much less greasy!! While the eggplant baked, I sauteed 2 chopped cloves of garlic, onion and sliced mushrooms (which was a delicious addition). I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the sauteed mixture, which for my taste, was a nice subtle touch to the dish. I layered the eggplant, onion, garlic and mushroom mixture, and tomatoes, sprinkled oregano and basil, and topped off with feta and parmesan cheeses. My boyfriend who is not normally a veggie lover, and I, LOVED this dish and will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews that have perfected it!

This is fantastic. I have to say I was tempted to change it up a little like prior reviewers but wanted to try it as written first.  I am so glad I did.  It really doesn't need anything else, it's so yummy.  Thanks so much!!

I was worried that cutting the eggplant so thick could cause problems, but it cooked very nicely. I changed it a little by mixing in a few sun-dried tomatoes & used a mix of shredded Italian cheeses instead of just Parmesan. My husband loved it & I even enjoyed it as leftovers the next day.

I gave this recipe 5 stars without even tasting it. I don't eat eggplant, but my Mom loves it, so I made this recipe for her.  The only change I made was to omit the munster cheese.  Mom thought the feta and parmesan would be  enough.  She was salivating while it was baking.  It smelled really good!  When it was done, that little bitty 82 year old ate a man sized portion (half the baking dish worth) and couldn't stop mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm'ing.  She said she was going to eat the rest tomorrow .. maybe for breakfast.  THAT'S why I gave it 5 stars.

This turned out to be the best eggplant dish we've ever tried. My husband who is an excellent and fussy cook himself loved it! Salted the slices and waited one hour. Then rinsed and dried on paper towels. We added additional seasoning (oregano, basil, pepper, sea salt, garlic powder). The slices fried up in a little olive oil very easily to a nice golden brown. Didn't have tomatoes so used "Alymer" tomato sauce (the kind in the pouch) which has lots of tomato chunks in it. Omitted the feta and instead used a blend of parmesan, cheddar and romano (whatever was in the house). Baked about 10 min longer than what recipe states. Delicious!

The best eggplant dish I have ever cooked!  I oven baked (instead of fried) the eggplant- much healthier.

This was EXCELLNT!  I used organic white eggplant that I got at the farmers market and didn't use the muenster cheese.  Since the feta is salty, I didn't add any but I sprinked the tomatoes with basil and oregano.  We had no left overs!

My hubby who is not an eggplant fan raved and raved and ate half the pan!  Even my little ones gobbled it down! I had to improvise a bit with what I had on hand, but we looooved it!  I had no eggs so I dipped it in an Italian-like dressing before the bread crumbs. I added a touch of crushed garlic in the layers and only had a very small amount of shredded cheese, but it was fine.  Had no problem with the eggplant or onions not cooking, everything worked perfectly!  Thank you thank you thank you!  A new favorite dish for special dinners!

Holy cats, this is SO delicious!  I too baked the eggplant at 425 (after egg/bread crumbs & sprayed w/olive oil)  I only did it for 14 minutes on one side and it was fine.  I sauteed onion & garlic, then added the tomatoes and Italian seasoning and let it all simmer for a bit.  Then put it all together in a baking dish, sprinkled with Feta cheese and nothing else, and baked it all for about 15 min at 350.  It was SOOOO good.  I will never make eggplant any other way.  We had it for leftovers too and it was still great in the microwave, which I didn't expect.  THANKS for this great recipe!  It is definitely a keeper.

I was not at all impressed by this recipe. First off, it smoked up my entire house when I was frying the eggplant. But after I baked it, I must admit it looked nice... until I bit into it! I forced myself to chew it and swallow. All I could taste was the grease and the eggplant was not cooked all the way through. It was a horrible mix of onion, which didn't even cook all the way, tomato, and grease. I did not like it al all! If I could rate it a 0/5, I would.   I do NOT recommend cooking this because you're only setting yourself up for stress and disappointment!

I am also rating based on my recipe. I also "sweated" the eggplant for about an hour. I did the egg and bread crumb thing and placed in the oven for 14min on each side at 350. While that was baking I sauteed the onions with fresh sliced/chopped garlic and some extra herbs. Once the 14 min on each side was complete I piled the onions, tomatoes, feta cheese, and sliced mozzarella cheese. I didnt measure the cheeses but next time I will for sure add more mozz cheese. This dish was my first eggplant dish to prepare and it was amazing! I had a side dish of angel hair pasta with freshly grilled jalapeno for some spicy. Tomorrow I will eat my leftovers and add a slice of Texas Toast! This is a must try!

This was very good, though I made a few changes based on what other reviewers had to say. I coated the eggplant in egg and panko breadcrumbs, then baked about half an hour, turning halfway. I cooked the onions in a pan with a little olive oil, adding some italian herbs, and did the same to the tomatoes for about two minutes (just enough to soften a bit). I used a mix of italian cheeses and parmesan, as that's what I had on hand, and added no salt at all as I barely use it. It came out very good, and even better the next day reheated as flavors had a chance to meld. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for my mom because she LOVES eggplant and it was on sale for $1.79/lb. 
I made the following changes per other suggestions:
I salted the cut eggplant and let it sweat for about 45 minutes, then dried very well on paper towels. 
In the eggs, I added about 1/3 cup Italian dressing, just to give the eggplant some added flavor. Dredged in seasoned breadcrumbs and baked 12 minutes per side. 
While eggplant baked, I sautéed the onions and about a tsp of minced garlic. I used a vidalia onion. 
Used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and since I had a small eggplant, I had just 1 layer. 
I layered the eggplant, then the sautéed mixture, and finally 1/2 a container of halved cherry tomatoes. 
Sprinkled with grated parm, basil, oregano, salt, and freshly ground pepper. 
Baked at 350° for 20 minutes, covered. Removed foil, add 2 handfuls of shredded provolone and baked 5 minutes longer. 
Next time, I'll slice the eggplant thicker but that was my fault. I will also try this with zucchini and summer squash mixed with the eggplant. 
All in all, 2 thumbs up!!

This was amazing.  I changed up the cheese and it lived up to it's reviews.  I sprinkled Romano cheese, then Parmesan, then mozzarella and then feta.

Simple and tastes great! I couldn't find Muenster Cheese so I had to use fresh Mozzarella..Still really good.

I made this recipe for a friend who is vegetarian. Steaks for the rest of us. Everyone wanted to taste as it looked delicious. No leftovers. Very tasty and easy.

This is a very awesome dish.  I made it for a pig-in at work and it got eaten up right away.  I've made it twice since then for guests and they loved it.  It's simple and easy to remember.  I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore.  I took some suggestions of other reviewers and salted the slices before breading them.  I browned the breaded eggplant using olive oil spray in a skillet.  I changed the cheeses to sliced mozzarella and shredded fresh parmesan and I skipped the muenster altogether.  I then added fresh basil.  So delicious!

This is the best eggplant recipe I have ever made.  I fried the eggplant on the stove and coated it in cornmeal and parmesan due to dietary restrictions I couldnt use the breadcrumbs.  I used monterey jack for the cheese on top and added crumbled bacon (which definitely made it more flavorful and yummy) and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I baked it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  My husband liked it and didnt comment that he ate a mostly meatless meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum! I made it as reviewer "MmmDelicious" suggested, and then used marinara sauce in place of fresh tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand. So good!

This recipe is one of my favorites & I have sent it to many of my family & friends to try with positive reviews all around! I pretty much prepare it just the way the recipe reads but with a bit more cheese & there are never many leftovers. You've got to try it!

My family absolutely loved this recipe, even my die hard meat eaters gave it two thumbs up and cleaned their plates. 

*I substituted Newman's Own Sockaroni Pasta Sauce due to time constraints and it turned out an unbelievable 10 times better. I also used cornbread stuffing mix for the breading.

I had an Eggplant that needed to be used. I had every thing but the Feta, I love Feta but don't think i would have liked it here. Also i didn't add tomatoes but only because i don't like fresh tomatoes cooked. And also while i enjoyed i think next time i might try Mozzarella

This was absolutely the best eggplant dish i have ever made.  A family favorite now.  I salted the eggplant generously and let it sit for an hour then rinsed and pat dry.  made the recipe as described accept needed a little more than a tablespoon of olive oil for frying and used a tbsp of butter when sauteeing the onion.  I added crushed red pepper and dry basil after each completed layer and used the buffalo mozzarella on top with the fresh tomato and fresh basil chopped and sprinkled for color.  FABULOUS is all i can say about this dish!

I made the quick & dirty version of this, but was sure to salt the eggplant slices for about 45 min-1hr first. It turned out fine...even though there are ways to really take your time with this and make it uber tasty.

-used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs
-used jar pasta sauce instead of tomatoes
-used grated parm cheese and topped with slices of provolone

Very good- took a tip from another user and "pan fried" it with olive oil cooking spray and a bit of EVOO.   Cooked the onions in some oil first to make them cripsy.  Threw on mozz and parm cheese and baked 25 min at 350.  Used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Delicious and easy.  Just a little time consuming.

I used this as a base recipe.  I oven fried the eggplant with some sprayed on oil, and lightly fried up the onions with garlic.  Then layered everything with a little salt, pepper and oregano.  I didn't use all the parmesan as i thought it was too much, and it was still a bit too salty.  But very delicious!  My husband loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

I had never had eggplant before but a friend gave me a couple from his garden to try.  I found this recipe and "WOW", my husband and I loved it!  As other reviewers suggested, I "sweat" the eggplant first and instead of frying, I baked it in the oven at 350 degree for about 20 minutes.  I can't wait to make it again!  Try it, you'll love it!

My entire family loves it when I make this, People who don't like eggplant or tomatoes enjoy this! I do make a few alterations: Bread and bake the eggplant instead of frying it; saute the onions with a few minced cloves of garlic then toss the onions in pesto; use tomato basil flavored feta; omit the muenster and top with mozz instead. Delicious!

SO good! I switched it up a bit, I used stewed diced tomatoes and a whole head of garlic. I skipped the heavy cheese layer and just topped with parmesan. I also cooked it on top of a layer of whole wheat spaghetti. Delicious and so healthy!

Very good stuff! I used provolone because it was what I had and it worked out great. My husband, who wants sauce on everything, was skeptical of not using marinara sauce over the top; once he tasted it without the marinara he loved it! Next time I'll probably add more spices to the bread crumbs to perk up the flavor even more.

My eggplant had 20 slices which is time consuming to fry. I did alternate between using oil and cooking spray. I did saute the tomatoes (2 Roma) and onions. Barely enough to cover the eggplant in the 9x13 glass dish. I then added Newman's marinara spaghetti sauce to fill in more. Tried mozzarella cheese because I didn't have munster. Overall not great tasting to make again. I'm 
Greek and love feta but it made it too salty. Guess I prefer traditional italian eggplant parmigiana.

I like it a lot.  Like the other reviews said, it took a lot of oil. Adding oregano made it even better. I think I will add some basil next time and slice the onion as thin as possible.

The flavors together are wonderful. As it turned out, I also needed more olive oil than called for to fry the eggplant slices. I also think that I will cube, rather than slice, the tomatoes and onions next time.

The taste was good but the bottom line is, it was "thin" and a little dry. I made some of the modifications suggested by others (baking instead of frying the breaded eggplant, sauteing the onions and garlic first, and adding basil and oregano). I didn't have muenster so I didn't use it, and really, in a dish that is clearly Mediterranean I would use something like mozzarella, not muenster. In a pan that size I only got a little more than one layer of eggplant, which is too thin. If I make this again, I will either use a 9x9 pan or double the eggplant, and I will use mozzarella with the parmesan and possibly leave out the feta altogether.

I baked the breaded eggplant in the oven instead of frying it and we really appreciated the way this made the dish a lot lighter.  I used two medium tomatoes to one small eggplant, but felt it could have used more tomato.  Thanks for a delicious meal!!

I am fairly new to cooking, and this recipe was so easy and amazingly delicious.  I've tried eggplant a few different ways and this is by far my favorite.  Tastes like lasagna...heaven on your fork! Can't wait to make it again.

Great dish! I might reduce the cheese a touch next time.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and baked the eggplant for 14min on each side- much simpler than frying each piece individually.

I love love love this dish.   I am so amazed at the flavor and the textures.
I did follow the recommendations of another viewer and salted in collander for an hour and it works so well to remove the bitterness.
The combination of onions and tomatoes with the Parmesan makes this eggplant dish ROCK! 
Thank you for posting this yummy dish.

This was a huge hit.  Didn't have Muenster cheese so used a little mixed cheddar on top of the feta/parm mixture.  Can't recommend it enough and so easy.

It was just OK.  Too much cheese.  I did what some other reviewers suggested and let the eggplant sit out with salt for an hour, then rinsed.  I wish it had a sauce or something to go with it. I will probably not make again.

I have used this recipe three times now and it is amazing! Only downside is that we never have any leftovers. I used some of the advice of other reviewers: put the eggplant in a colander, sprinkle with salt and let the bitterness seap out for an hour or so. Also, I have been using Romano cheese rather than Parm and less cheese than recommended but it still tastes great. I also broil the top a bit at the end to make it a bit crispier. 
Thanks for this great recipe!!

So yummy!  Took the advice of others and spinkled eggplant slices with salt, let them sit for an hour or so and then rinsed.  After frying eggplant I sauted red onions in same pan before layering.  Used goat cheese and no tomatoes on "my side" and mozzarella and parmesan on hubby's side.  Perfect and even good the next day!  
UPDATE: trying to eat healthier so made this dish tonight with roasted eggplant instead of fried!  Wonderful!  After rinsing eggplant I sprayed a pan with Olive Oil Pam and sprinkled eggplant with black pepper and prepared olive oil & pesto (ya know, the stuff you dip your bread in).  Baked at 400 for about 30 minutes then follow rest of directions.  Still LOVE it with goat cheese!

I am always looking for creative eggplant recipes that don't include frying in a lot of oil.  Even though fried eggplant is delicious, I just can't justify all those calories!  I  had feta cheese in the fridge and decided to try this recipe and I'm glad I did!  I sweated the eggplant for about 20 minutes with salt before beginning the recipe, and I didn't have any muenster cheese so I used fresh mozzarella and I sprinkled fresh basil on top.  Everything else was per the recipe.  This is so good that I will be making it as my primary eggplant recipe.  It really brings out the flavor of the eggplant without that heavy oily taste.  The onions, tomatoes and cheese are perfect flavorful compliments. So glad I came upon this recipe, thank you!

I really love the flavor of this dish. My boyfriend thought it was too cheesy the first time I made it, so the second time I eliminated the Parmesan, used about 3/4 cups of feta, and instead of using Muenster, I topped it with about 3/4 cups of shredded sharp cheddar that I already had in the fridge. That seemed to do the trick for him and I was still pleased with the results. Win-win!

I quite enjoyed this dish. I used red onion rather than regular, and swapped the Muenster for Swiss, but it was all quite tasty. The only reason I can't give it five stars is my husband, the consummate carnivore, fussed that there was no meat in it. Maybe I'll spike it with sausage next time to make him happy.

Delicious! Baked the breaded eggplant instead of frying and seasoned the tomatoes with italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Used parmesan and chevre because those were the cheeses I had on hand. Honestly, for so few ingredients I can't believe how good this was. My roommate is still talking about it days later :)

Delicious! I added some roasted garlic (3 cloves, finely chopped) and chopped the onion and sauteed it before layering it. I also substituted a mixture of monterey jack and mozzarella I had in the freezer for the Feta cheese and sprinkled some fresh basil on top before baking.

This was super good. I didn't even really love eggplant before until now. One thing that this recipe lacks is GARLIC! I minced about 2 cloves and sprinkled it on top of the tomatoes. Also, basil and oregano really added to the flavor especially with the feta and garlic.

I had never eaten eggplant before and was a little skeptical.  I made a few changes. I made my slices thinner and used a little water and olive oil when frying.  It came out great.  This was really good.  My husband even liked it and he is very,very picky.  Thanks.

Delicious! I used some other kind of cheese because I didn't have muenster on hand (colby jack I think) and cut the eggplant thinner than 1/2" That seems really thick... does anyone really cut it that thick and like it? I cut it as thin as I possibly could and used more than 2 eggs and 1c of breadcrumbs when breading (as I knew I would). Loved the feta and onions! All of my favorite things.

This is delicious!!  I made it with an Italian cheese blend (its what I had on hand), but I think next time I am going to follow the recipe closer and use just parmesan, meunster, and feta it calls for.  The mozzarella in the blend was a bit much for this dish.  I also think I may add some fresh basil, I think it would really give this dish the final "oomph."  Really, really tasty though, and I am happy I found something we all like with eggplant beyond Eggplant Parmesan.  I'm going to play with this a little, but its definitely getting added to the rotation!

I followed the suggestion of baking the breaded eggplant instead of frying and it tasted great without all the oil.  I also added some spinach for a little green and skipped the muenster.  It was really good!

Really fantastic.  I used the same cheeses. Only difference was I didnt have fresh tomatoes, just a can of stewed ones ( That I chopped up later.) It actually made it come together nicely. Great dish.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times, and I was never a fan of eggplant before. DO "sweat" your eggplant and DO saute onions before layering.  (Frying tomatoes unnecessary in my opinion.) I now cut back about 1/4 on the amount of feta and parmesan. (Otherwise it's a little too salty for my taste.)

My family really loved this recipe. I changed it a little by sauteing the onions and using mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

This was slammin'.  I used a few tips from some of the other cooks...I breaded and baked my eggplant.  I also sauted red onions (not the tomatoes).  I seasoned my own plain breadcrumbs and egg mixture with italian seasoning, garlic seasoning, salt and pepper. I drizzled the top with a little organic balsamic vinegar. I loved this and I will make it again.  This will convert my meat eating friends!! LOL!!

I only had mozzarella on hand, and I added dried basil and oregano before baking.  Made it early and the cheese burned when I tried to reheat it in the oven.  It was still really yummy though, and I will definitely try again with more cheese!

I changed this recipe up a little. I only had plain breadcrumbs on hand, so I used garlic cooking spray to give it some flavor and cut down on the fat. I followed some other reviews that susggested to cook the onions, so I sauteed the onions in the garlic spray. I used a Tuscan cheese (Borden), which came with an herb seasoning packet. I used half of the packet and half of the cheese.  I also used fresh tomatoes from the garden and shredded parmesan. It turned out delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so wonderful.  I didn't have tomatoes so I added diced tomatoes and precooked the onions.  I also used shredded cheese.  My kids are not usually keen on eggplant but it was a hit.  Will certainly be making again.

Delicious! I add some chunky spaghetti sauce before each layer of eggplant.  Then serve over plain spaghetti noodles. All the sauce covers the noodles and the eggplant bake is a gooey cheesy delight on top.

Absolutely wonderful! I am new to the eggplant world...but I'm definately making this again. I can't wait for the leftovers! It does take a lot of oil to fry the eggplant, but it's worth it.

I did not like this much at all.  Might have been better if I had sauted the onions first.  Plus, I had to use way too much oil.  I will not make this again.

Got 2 eggplants and fresh tomatoes from a 4H event. This looked like the perfect recipe for a week night dinner and it was! 
I did salt the slices for 1 hour and rinsed/dried them. I used Panko with Italian seasonings and some garlic salt for the coating-it came out perfectly crispy when they were in the oven and turned after 15 minutes each side. 
While the eggplant was baking, I sautéed the tomatoes, garlic, and onion. I added in a jar of Ragu Thick and Hearty sauce. Put it in a 9 x 13 pan, topped with cheeses and baked for 20 minutes. Lots of work for a week night dinner, but well worth it.

This was fantastic!  I didn't have any tomatoes so I used 19 ounce can of presidents choice original diced tomatoes that had green pepper, onions and celery in it. I also use cheddar cheese instead of the Munster . Oh I also didn't have breadcrumbs so I used soda cracker crumbs seasoned with oregano and onion powder.

I made this for meatless Monday, I made the recipe exactly and will probably make it again. However, next time I will use less Feta, as my family and I found it to be quite overwhelming in some bites.

Thank You!!  I changed the cheese a little and added Green Pepper strips.  This dish is the bomb!  This is full of great flavor and is easy to make.  Could be a great appetizer also.  I say fill the dish not just the eggplant, as I did, (was still good) For all reading this go for it !

This is reaaly good. I did tweak it a bit, I baked my eggplant slices instead of frying. 7 min per side, while they baked I cooked the onion slices in oil and seasoned with a bit of garlic. after the eggplant was done I scooped the onions onto slices topped with tomatoe,parm,feta and used white chedder (thats what I had on hand) then spinkled each with Italian dreesing and cooked another 8 min. yummy will definetly make again next time I get eggplant

Thank God my computer is slow because I;m wolfing down this square of Eggplant Bake!! It is SO delicious! I followed the recipe except I baked the breaded eggplant on 425 for about 10min/side. I used a slightly oiled baking sheet. I RESISTED the urge to add liquid to the bottom of the buttered casserole and I'm glad I did. Baked the casserole as directed by VJUNE and it is perfect! Vegies are juicy, crunchy on the outside and cooked in the middle. Flavors are melded together deliciously. Thanks VJUNE-cant;' wait to share this with my veggie friends.

This is a good recipe as an introduction to eggplant. The only complaint was it came out soggy so I wouldn't suggest reheating or freezing.    Neither my husband nor I are big fans, but the family's garden was busier then we thought it would be so now we have more eggplant then we know what to do with.  Gave this a go.  When the eggplant was smothered with the toppings it was really easy to ignore the eggplant's texture and the sweetness of the veggie nicely balanced out the acid of the tomato and the bitterness of the onion.  Without the toppings it was just too "eggplanty" for my taste.

I like others sweated my eggplant and then bake in the oven to not only skip a step but to eliminate the excess oil. I added the cheeses I had on hand and sauted my onions with some garlic. My husband loved it, for me it was just okay. This requires to much prep for a dish that is just mediocre. Nevertheless, Thank You for Sharing.

I love eggplant but I did something wrong when I made this dish and I'm not sure what.  My eggplant was bitter and I did sweat the slices which I have never done before.  But the other flavors were all great and I will try again.  I think I won't do stacks though.  I couldn't get the feta to stay on the stacks.  I used the leftovers today to make a hot sandwich minus my bitter eggplant.  Delicious.

We didn't pre-fry--I just used frozen grilled slices eggplant from safeway and breaded as directed, dunked in a beaten egg then italian bread crumbs and plunked them in the pan as directed.  We also used mozzarella, a little feta, and provelone cheese instead of the recommended cheeses.  Overall, this was a huge hit.  The next night, we added pasta shells to it as sort of a pasta casserole.

I've made this twice - once for DH, who couldn't stop muttering " this is good" the whole time. My only variations: I use mozzarella in place of the muenster, and I saute the onions (until clear) before baking. Thank you for posting!

Really good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't make it exactly to the recipe. I baked the eggplant instead of frying as another Reviewer said (read Aug 30,2007) and I used cheese I had on hand, not feta. I also added mushrooms.  Husband loved it.

Excellent recipe - I added a little ricotta in one of the layers and used mozzarella in place of the feta. Served over whole wheat spaghetti with a cucumber salad side -it was a hit!

This is the best eggplant meal EVER.
I put it in a pita - a thicker one -like flatbread, fold it up, and it is UNBELIEVABLE!!
like a gyro, without the meat.

Well, this dish confirmed my husbands hate for eggplant. I thought it was good, gourmet tasting even, but a lot of flavors going on. Also, I added several steps (sweating the eggplant, sauteeing the onions) making it quite labor intensive. I found the breadcrumbs overwhelmed the delicate eggplant flavor, so I have heard to bread it in flour seasoned with spices instead. I may try that and give this recipe another try.

This was really great with the changes I made, so the rating is for the original.  I did not fry the eggplant but rather sauteed it and the onions.  I mixed 1/2 c. bread crumbs with garlic powder and italian seasoning, and 1/2 c. grated parmesan.  I sprinkled this over the top for a crust.  I also added green pepper and zucchini.  Very good with these changes.

Extremely Delicious!  I love eggplant and cheese, and adding the tomatoes and onions made the perfect dish.  I did use a lot more oil then specified, but the eggs and crumbs were the perfect amount.

Excellent!  I did change it up though.  Since it's my first time making eggplant I did some reading and salted it and let the moisture out of it for 30 min.  On the advice of others I also sauteed the onions, tomatoes.  I added red pepper to this mix.  I did not have enough tomato so I used a can mixed with green chili peppers.  I only had flavored feta - may try unflavored next time.  Mmmm!  Great - loved it.

Oh boy!  What a great recipe!  I followed the recipe with no substitutions and it was absolutely delicious.  Although I used quite a bit more olive oil in frying the eggplant and that part was a bit time consuming, it was worth every minute of prep work.  I definitely recommend it for your next family get-together.

I love eggplant but my children just started to accept eating it. So I had to cater it to their taste.. I Skipped the tomatoes( on their share). I caramelized the slices of onion in a skillet with little bit of olive oil and a pinch of salt, before putting on the eggplant.  Also, after seeing some pictures of this casserole being made as little eggplant pizzas, I copied the idea and we all liked it a lot this way ! Next time, I will try adding some pizza sauce.

Amazingly good!  I have made it by the recipe ... and I've tweaked the recipe a few times; it's enjoyable every time!   Added sweet peppers and zucchini ... added minced garlic ... added turkey pepperoni!  LOTS of options .... guess that's why it's a "go to" recipe, lol!!  
*two thumbs up!

This was very tasty!  I just used a can of diced tomatoes and that worked well.  I also did as others suggested and salted the eggplant an hour before prep then rinsed.  It was not bitter in the least.  Reheats well.  Will make again for sure.

Loved it.  Made it to the recipe and it was great.  It's not greasy if you know good frying techniques and I was amazed that people in this house who never eat eggplant gobbled this right up.  It's going in the rotation.  Thanks!

Great outline for an eggplant dish.  As did others, I did slice,salt and drain before dipping in egg and seasoned pinko before frying.  I had no feta and used goat cheese and will definitely do again and topped with shredded white Mexican cheese.  Delicious.  I loved the freshness as opposed to the sauciness of traditional eggplant Parmesan and will be pleased to have leftovers tomorrow.  This dish will be made again!

Just made it and eating it right now!  I salted the eggplant (like another comment said to do); I had feta, but only had a Mexican cheese blend mix, and Italian bread crumbs.  I had a bit of chicken left over, so threw that in as well.  I didn't measure anything... lol  I am dipping my fork fulls into fat-free sour cream... yum!

Amazing! Some were baked with sauteed garlic+tomatoes+onion instead of frying, and others were fried as recip calls. They were terrific!!! Thank you a lot!!!

I had never eaten or cooked eggplant before, and had no idea how this would turn out or what it was supposed to taste like. 
I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference being that I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of Muenster. 
I did not find it at all greasy. I am not sure how other people's turned out greasy, as there is only a small amount of oil used for frying, and the eggplant itself did not seem moist. Maybe it was supposed to be? Like I said, I've never had it before and was not sure how it was supposed to be. 
Regardless, I followed the rest of the recipe as directed and it turned out quite well. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. I did think the feta was a little overpoweringly salty, so next time I might try to replace it with ricotta or more mozzarella.

1 tablespoon of oil to fry an entire eggplant?  No way!  Other than that, this is a good recipe, perfect for a lovely vegetarian meal, alongside a nice salad or some garlic bread.

The best tasting and easiest eggplant recipe ever!  I peeled the eggplant, prepared with salt, and added some thinly sliced onions on the bottom of the pan so we had carmelized onions too! I sprinkled the tomatoes with garlic powder, because we love garlic.  Used various cheeses.

That was delicious! I followed reviewer suggestions and salted the eggplant slices, baked the breaded slices rather than frying, and sprinkled basil and oregano over the tomato. Speaking of tomatoes, I realized late I didn't have enough fresh tomato so I ended up using drained canned diced tomatoes. It was fine but I will definitely use fresh later. I also only used Parmesan and feta and it was cheesy enough for me.

Really yummy! It smells so amazing while cooking. I wasn't a huge fan of the onions, though. They didn't seem cooked enough for me. I'll use less and slice even thinner next time. I agree that frying used a lot of oil, so next time I'll give the baking method a shot. I'm also tempted to add something green in there. Maybe a spinach layer. Either way, it was a good recipe that I'll use again :)

I don't typically cook eggplant. This was really yummy. Only thing that kept it from 5 stars is the onion doesn't cook quite enough with 30 minutes.  My neighbor stopped by to see what I was cooking it smelt so amazing.

Cooked it a second time and suated the onions beforehand. Made a huge difference and upped the rating.

It was delicious.  The only deviation from the recipe above:
I salted the eggplant slices before cooking to draw out excess water. After rinsing off salt and drying eggplant, I cooked that same way as recipe (tried the oven method without success).  For the cheese, I used ricotta and mozzarella with a couple of fresh basil leaves and Italian spices.  It was excellent.

This is one of the best recipes I've made in a long long while! I want to preface this post by saying that I am very picky about my food and won't rate something that's "just okay" with a 5-star review. This is worth making! Like the other reviewers, I made a couple changes. I salted the sliced eggplant first, let sit for an hour, washed off and drained prior to cooking. I also used olive oil and butter to fry them (you will need more than 1 tablespoon - just fyi. I left off the muenster cheese, and instead used parm, mozzarella, and feta. I also sauteed my onions before layering them in baking dish. This was fantastic and something I plan on making over and over again!! I made a small side of spaghetti with this and drizzled a little bit of the sauce over the eggplant once it was done - delicious!!!

Ummmm, my husband says 5 stars. I forgot to fry the eggplant first but it turned out great and probably healthier. I used red onion because I had it on hand and mozzarella cheese instead of muenster for the same reason. Added parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and a little cayenne pepper. I baked it on the grill and served with grilled brats, which turned out to be good complementary flavors.

This is a very good recipe.  I followed suggestions to oven bake the eggplant, because I don't do a very good job frying eggplant. HOWEVER, the BEST idea is to layer a section of the eggplant/tomato/cheese on avocado on top of  toasted whole grain bread.  The most fantastic breakfast sandwich....YUMMY.

The way I cooked this, it ended up more like eggplant Parmesan than anything else, but it was excellent! Instead of the sliced tomatoes, I used tomato saucse. Because I felt the muenster and feta clashed with the overall Italian-ness of the recipe, I used Parmesan and mozzarella. It was excellent!

I had to modify this because of some dietary restrictions so some of the other suggestions were helpful.  I had never heard of salting the slices, but tried it even though I only had 15 min. to let them sit.  I couldn't use egg or bread crumbs; I just drizzled the slices with olive oil and sprinkled them with Italian seasoning.  I baked 14 min. then turned them over. I roasted 2 cloves of chopped garlic with onion slices then 7 min. after flipping placed tomato slices, tofu mozzarella cheese, then topped with the onion/garlic. Delicious!

bf and i enjoyed this.. i'm always feeling like i undercook eggplant and this was the case again but we didn't mind too much.. maybe it was the size of my eggplant but i was able to get away with only 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, one egg, half an onion, and one large beefsteak tomato.. didn't measure the cheeses and used jack cheese for the muenster.. using tips from other reviewers i made sure to sweat the eggplant, baked rather than fried, and sprinkled italian seasoning over the tomatoes.. bf said it made him think of little mini pizza's.. ty for the recipe

Wonderful! With the following mods:  salt/drain eggplant as other user suggested (I like to weight mine with heavy pan in a colander to get good drainage), bake the breaded eggplant@350°F instead of frying, and layer in ~1lb cooked ground bison or other lean burger. I didn't have enough feta &Munster so subbed mozzarella for feta &Gruyere for Munster. Also added handful of sauteed sweet peppers & sun-dried tomatoes in cheese layers. So great even my kids ate it. A sure keeper!

Really liked this recipe.  I peeled the eggplant to get out some of the bitterness instead of soaking it (had to get dinner done quickly!) and it didn't have any bitter taste.  Next time I will try baking the eggplant instead of frying, because I did have to use a lot more than the 1TB of olive oil called for frying the eggplant slices.  I also forgot to salt the eggplant when it was done frying, but the cheese made up for it and I don't think it needed that extra salt in the end.  This recipe was a hit in our house - my husband had 3 servings!

INCREDIBLE!  I took this to a dinner party and everyone raved - they want the recipe.  I did add marinara sauce like a previous reviewer suggested, it was reeaaally delicious.  Next time I will try just as the recipe states.  I am sure it will be just as good.  Did have to use a little more oil than suggested, but everything else was right on.  If you are looking for something different, try this - you will LOVE it!
