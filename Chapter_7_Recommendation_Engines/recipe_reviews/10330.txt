I've used this recipe in the past and it's DELICIOUS.  They are something different but very much worth the effort!  They are quick and fun after you've chilled the dough, but that factor alone makes these a little less than kid-friendly.  Give it a try!

I made this recipe with three variations: (1) All ingrediants were organic (2) I had no lemon juice only extract (3) I used dark chocolate kisses instead of milk chocolate. Recipe came out great although, I do not recommend the lemon extract. The flavor of the lemon juice is a lot better.

More than one person came up to me after I baked these and told me they were the best cookies they've ever had! I used lemon extract, and they were very tasty. They are buttery rich!

Absolutely delicious!  A wonderful cookie.  I have been looking for this recipe forever.  My aunt used to make the same cookies at christmas but I could never get the recipe off of her.  Thank you so much.

Delicious, buttery cookie!!! YUM! 
I had a problem with my cookies spreading, however. The recipe doesn't say to, but I had to chill mine after molding to keep them from spreading too far. I also used two or three semi-sweet chocolate chunks in place of the kisses. Just a personal preference for darker chocolate! Thanks for the great recipe. I made these once when I was a teenager and was so pleased to find the recipe again!

These were ok. Nothing special, and I was really rooting for them. I will probably not make these again. If Im going to make a cookie with a hershey's kiss, it will be the peanut butter blossoms.

This is shortbread wrapped around a Hershey kiss. Quite yummy.  Changes I made 1) real lemon juice 1:1 replacement. (final cookie had no lemony flavor so will up that amount next time), 2) added 1/4 teaspoon of salt - also used salted butter, 3) used dark chocolate kisses (yum) and 4) used 1/2 cup of walnuts because I ran out of almonds.

Cookies sat up like little delicious golf balls throughout baking. I found a 350 oven a better temp kept the bottom from getting overly dark. After cooling, I did drizzle with melted Hershey kisses but wished I hadn't. Next time I'll skip that step.

Also, found the cookies cooked up better not re-cooled after forming but it is winter and my house is on the cool side so that may have made the difference.

I'll make these again; this is a straight-forward recipe that produces quite a tasty shortbread-type cookie.

I made a powdered sugar icing with lemon juice, lemon zest and water, and smoothed some over the top, then drizzled the chocolate on top. Nice, airy cookie, but I think I had too much dough around the kiss - the recipe's suggestion to use a scant tablespoon of dough is a good one. Also, I added zest to the dough.

Ok but dough could use more flavor. Not bad though.

I used 14 chocolate chips instead of kisses. I also added mint. I did not add almonds.

A really yummy recipe - but I didn't have kisses when I made it last year so I decided to just roll the dough into a 1 1/2" ball then flatten onto the cookie sheet.  I didn't have to adjust the baking time -- baked until golden at edges.  When completely cooled I drizzled with a yellow glaze made of confectioners sugar, 1 tsb lemon extract, yellow food coloring and small amount of water (until I liked the consistency).  They were actually very good!
