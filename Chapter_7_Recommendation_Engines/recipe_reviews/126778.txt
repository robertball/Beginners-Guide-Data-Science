My best friend is Persian, and I love the rich flavour of Persian food.  This soup is great and full of flavour.  I've always tried to  make Persian food myself, but whenever I've tried it doesn't taste the same as my best friend's mom.  This is the closest I've gotten so far!  Excellent recipe and really easy.
Update:  I've since made this dish countless times and it is definitely Persian approved!  I do things slightly differently though.  When I saute the onions I add the tumeric.  I definitely add more then a teaspoon of tumeric.  I keep adding pinches until the onions are a bright yellow-orange.  I also add saffron, which makes this dish more authentic.  I take a few saffron stems and mix them with about a 1/2 teaspoon of hot water so it becomes a liquid, and I add it in the beginning to the onions.  I also add the finely diced carrots when I add the barley, because I find it takes a while for the carrots to cook in this recipe.  Fresh parsley is also a must, and I probablly add at least a cup of it finely chopped.  And  finally this recipe makes the barley into a thick stew, and it isn't really like a soup texture.  If you want to to be soupy add more broth and decrease the barley.

I never do these online review things, but I had to say how much I loved this soup! The ingredients are so simple, but somehow it's more than the some of its parts--it has a rich, subtle, slightly elusive taste that even my 8-year-old loved. The only changes that I made were to add some saffron (a good pinch) to the broth while it was heating, and I added chopped fresh dill at the end along with the parsley. And the sour cream works great, but you can also substitute creme fraiche--and in that case, it doesn't need to be tempered when you add it to the soup, you can just stir it in; it won't separate.

I'm so glad to have this as part of my "repertoire"! I plan on making it a LOT.

Added cubed chicken.  I recommend using yogurt instead of sour cream.  I doubled the amount of yogurt as I like my soup a little sour.  Great recipe.

EDIT August 2014: I made this again, didn't do anything differently, but liked it much better the second time. Glad I gave it a second chance! :)



I wanted to like this... It had been in my recipe for ages before I actually got around to making it. I made it for an Iranian friend, and although we both liked it enough to eat it, it is unfortunately not something that I would make again. The taste was okay, I followed the recipe exactly. In terms of texture, a bit thick, but thinning it out would not have improved it much. I guess it was just kind of monotonous to eat, spoonful after spoonful. Lacked something essential, but I am nevertheless glad that I finally made it. Oh well!

This was delicious! I don't know why I'm surprised - Persian food is always great - but wow! I would absolutely make this again! And it's perfect for a summer dinner.

I am a soup fanatic and I am always looking for different soups to add to my repertoire. The only change I made to this soup was using cilantro instead of parsley (I had that on hand). It was very delicious!!! I will make this again.

This is so good.  I threw everything but the carrots, sour cream and parsley in the slow-cooker and let it go all day on low.  It worked nicely.  I shredded the carrots when I got home so they would cook faster.  The consistency is great, and the lime is perfect in this.  I loved it.  The only thing I will do differently in the future is leave out the parsley.  Either I'll forget about it altogether, or I'll use some cilantro in its place.  I had a little before adding the parsley and a little more after adding it- I prefer it without.  Thanks for the recipe, Autumn Leaves- this is a keeper.

I don't know much about Persian cuisine but this soup was very good! Sour, creamy, hearty... I'm glad I made a huge pot for myself because I keep getting back for leftovers! Will make again very soon.

What a great soup!  I used more tomato paste than the recipe called for and added the zest from my lime in with the juice.  I subbed fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream.   Wonderful!

For ease of preparation, flavor and food cost, this MUST be a five-star recipe. I shall add that I made this a while ago and just broke some of it out of the freezer. It froze very well. My only warning would be to take care with the turmeric; not only can/will it stain, it can overwhelm other flavors in the dish. I also enjoy stirring a good bit of plain (goats milk) yogurt through it when it's hot and eat with buttered crusty bread. Check out the nutrition stats and add it to your repertoire post-haste! What are you waiting for?!

I tried this with some trepidation because it seemed to be a lengthy process. I made my stock from scratch because packaged stock is difficult to come by here (Pakistan), and that was really the hardest part. The rest of it is so simple, the flavour at the end surprises you with its complexity. I looked up this recipe to relive fond memories of Iran, and it is an AMAZING recipe that I will keep making for years to come.

Amazing! Not what I was expecting, but in a really good way. I wouldn't make this for a non adventurous eater, but anyone with open minded taste buds will LOVE it. My only issue is that I ended up with a texture more like a side dish. Next time I will cool the barley separately and then add it too the broth so that I get a more soupy constancy.

This soup was very good. It was a little thick, but I'm not a thick soup person. I like broths so I added extra water. Also I had seen several posts about cilantro so I made a bowl with parsley and one with cilantro. Unanimous decision, definitely cilantro. Parsley sort of reminds me of tabouli if it were a soup, the cilantro adds some zest. Only change I would made next time is a little less barley and a little more carrots, and maybe some chicken. Great soup.

This was a really great recipe with a nice unique flavor and a very satisfying texture.  I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream and cilantro for parsley.  Also, I browned the oninons with the tumeric.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was really pleased.  The only change I will try next time is to wait 5-10 minutes after removing the soup from the heat before adding the yogurt (I added it immediately afterwards and it curdled just a bit).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very hearty soup! The only change I made was to use a creme fraiche sub (sour cream/cream cheese). I also sauteed my onions with turmeric.

I am crazy about this soup.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Some said it kind of had an unusual taste and thats true and thats is what I liked so much. I would say it has an earthy taste. I made the recipe exactly as written except I added saffron as pr other reveiws.  It is hearty, healthy, easy to make and delicious what else could you ask for?   Next time I am doubling the recipe and will freeze some. It makes a decent sized pot of soup [7 cups when finished].  I also think I will add some chick peas for protein.  Thanks so much Autum leaves.

This was super easy and super yummy and super healthy.  I substituted olive oil and light sour cream.  The fresh parsley really makes a difference in this recipe.

I added 8 oz of diced, grilled turkey tenderloins in order to bulk up the protein, but made no other changes.  It was really good, although I could've skipped the extra squeeze of lime on top - it made it overly tart for my tastes.   Both my wife and I agreed that I could make this again.

I used 1 tbs turmeric and subbed greek yogurt for sour cream and added the lime at the end of cooking. My family loved this. I am making it again as we speak- at the request of my daughter. She said it's her new favorite soup!

I decided to substitute the sour cream for plain yogurt and I did not like the result. The soup was way too sour and seemed to be missing something. Don't think I'll make it again, even with sour cream.

Wonderful soup, layered and quite flavorful. I had no expectations so I am very pleasantly surprised by this rich and tasty soup. I will make this again and again.

This soup was a nice change of pace.  The pearl barley is a great texture and the thickness of the soup made it feel very rich and filling.  The flavor was that of lime, tomato and a bit of the ethnic flavor you get with turmeric.

Great flavour - my family loved it! I needed to add an extra 500 mL of chicken stock, but this may be because I added extra carrots and onions. Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty!  I was looking for something different to do with some barley that I had and this worked out great, although I don't think I would want it all the time.  I think next time I might try using saffron as others suggested.

It turned out really good! The only thing I will do different is add less sour cream. I might try a veggie version for my friends. Overall it was full of flavor, hearty, and delicious.

I found myself with a bag of barley and nothing to do with it, so went looking for an easy recipe. This soup is fantastic - easy, delicious, healthy and suitable for my vegetarian son (if you sub vegetable broth for the chicken broth). We all loved it and will be serving at a boxing day get together.  I halved the recipe, used veggie broth, and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Great recipe! changes other than the broth,

My fiance is Persian and he loved this -- so much that he ate 3 bowls full! I was out of tomato paste so I pureed diced tomatoes. I also added chunks of lamb and let it simmer in the soup. I broiled buttered bread and made croutons to put in the soup. This was a hit! This is going to be regular in my recipe box!

Very good! The only changes I made were using vegetable broth instead of chicken and I didn't use the parsley (didn't have any) or serve with lime wedges (I did use the lime in the soup as called for). Next time I think I'll add some peas. My two year old LOVED it.

In an attempt to introduce more grains into my diet, I decided to try cooking with barley. This soup looked interesting and I am curious about Middle Eastern food, so I gave it a shot. I used yogurt instead of sour cream (it was what I had plus I'm trying to cut calories), and I added about a cup of parsley (I didn't have another dish to use it in and didn't want it to go to waste). The flavors are...different - I can't explain it any other way. Although there's a different mix of flavors, it still felt like it was lacking something. I found another recipe for Ash-e-jow, and that one seems more full bodied - it has barley, of course, as well as various beans, lentils, and rice. I think next time I will try that recipe because this one, while good for a such a simple soup, was just lacking. This would be great served with some homemade bread though!

Lime and turmeric with barley- what an intriguing combination! I started with homemade vegetable stock made from peelings... and sauteed the onions, carrots, and turmeric together- with a couple cloves of garlic- before following the rest of the recipe exactly... delicious! What a wonderful use of rather inexpensive ingredients! We'll be eating this regularly from now on- thanks for the great recipe!

Very good soup-- the tartness from the tomato paste and lime juice contrasts well with the creamy sour cream. At first I thought I'd like to cook the carrots for longer but the crunchiness of undercooked carrots is nice with the smooth pearl barley.

So good! I sub'd a pinch of saffron threads for the turmeric. Plus added a can of garbanzo beans at the end. I found the barley and carrots needed a good 20 min less to cook.

I would have to admit that the soup was interesting, and I ate the whole bowl, but I didn't want seconds and I can't imagine I will have any more of it.  It just had a flavor I wasn't used to, and I didn't like the taste of the parsley.  Sorry if I offended anyone!  Just not my bowl of soup...so to speak.

I decided to make this soup because of all the rave reviews. I found it OK, nothing out of this world. The tomato paste taste was quite front-and-center making the soup remind me of tomato soup and none of the other ingredients did enough to really take it to the next level of tastiness or interesting-flavour beyond a sort of tomato soup variant. It was an alright soup but not something I'd make again.

I can't decide whether it's a 3 or a 5, so I'll go with 4. What an interesting flavour. After sitting, it got as thick as porridge so I suggest eating it all straight away. It's thick and satisfying, and as another reviewer said, has an elusive flavour.

I have made this a few times now, and the only modification I made was to halve the amounts, since It's just my hubby and me. I love this soup! It's delicious and comforting, and I know I'm doing something good for my body. Fresh parsley really makes the flavors pop! Love it ... thanks for such a winner.

This recipe is awesome. It's simple. Common ingredients. Incredible flavor! I tried as is first. Doesn't require any more or less. I did however have a bean and lentil mix cooked and waiting to be added to something and this was it! Great both ways. Definitely recommend the lime, don't skip it! It's subtle and not overly tart. Lemon worked fine too!

I should have trusted my gut - neither my boyfriend nor I really like tomato-based soups, but since this one had (what looked like) so little tomato paste I thought it would be OK. Even though the tomato flavor just made this "meh" for us, the taste was still very decent and if you like tomato you would probably love this soup. We will likely make this recipe again minus the tomato paste. Other changes we made based on looking at other variations of this recipe on the internet: added a can of beans (used pinto because that's all I had), a small pinch of saffron, a clove or two of garlic, mixed two eggs into the sour cream before adding that to the soup for a little protein, and added some cilantro along with the parsley. Without the tomato sauce we would have loved this soup, so you should definitely try the recipe either with or without the tomato sauce (as your preferences dictate).

Easy and better tasting than I expected.  I made this for my family since my husband wasn't feeling that well and needed something easy on the intestines but filling.  It turned out great and even my toddler enjoyed it.  Only changes was I added a pinch of saffron and used natural yogurt instead of sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe.    Additional note - both turmeric and barley are recommended for persons suffering from diarrhea. Could be a coincidence, but this seemed to do the trick.  I'll surely make it again.

Wow! This soup was a big hit. I was a little nervous because it wasn't anywhere near as complicated as other recipes I have seen for ash-e jow... but I was not disappointed! IT has a very unique flavour that you just cant get enough of. Followed the recipe exactly as shown and was rewarded with a fabulous soup. My husband also loved the leftovers as a topping for jacket potato. A definite keeper - i've even added a hard copy of this recipe to my beloved Food of Life cookbook!!

This soup was really great! I think I added a tad too much salt though. Will definitely make this for my Persian friend and see how he likes it next time.

This recipe is great!  I love the lime/tumeric combo and it tastes like a yellow curry dish I always order at a local restaurant.  I added just a pinch of cinnamon and thought this made it taste even better. I also added a couple of small cut, up russet potatoes.  This was a cheap meal, but very delicious and filling.  Good with sandwiches or just rolls/bread.

This was AWESOME!  I finished it and went back for more, which is unlike me.  We used yogurt instead of sour cream, because that's what we had.

Made recipe for six; these were generous portions so had I made the recipe for just two people, I think one bowl each woud have sufficed (with a side dish or bread).  Using the recipe for six, I added a quarter teaspoon more turmeric.  I also used low sodium soup AND added some salt as I went along--however, this soup seems to need a lot more salt than it had in order to make it as flavorful as I would have liked.  I also used low fat sour cream.  Maybe because of the low fat cream and low sodium soup it didn't have as much "oomph" as I was hoping for, or maybe it's just supposed to be subtle in taste.  However, my husband really liked it.  Next time I will put the carrots in along with the barley (although the soup cooked for about 1 1/2 hours the carrots were still a little hard), and my husband also suggested adding some celery for additional flavor, texture and color.  This is a good, hearty winter soup, not the best I've ever had, but quite decent.  Make sure you squeeze on the fresh lime from the lime wedges before you eat the soup--to me it really was THE necessary finishing touch for this soup in terms of flavor, although my husband thought the soup was good enough to stand on its own.  I served this soup with a corn bread loaf, recipe for which I found on this site, and the soup and loaf were definitely a complete and satisfying meal.
