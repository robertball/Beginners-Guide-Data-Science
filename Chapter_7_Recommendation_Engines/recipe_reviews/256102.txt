Absolutely delicious! I had the poor man's version, I made it with boneless pork loin chops. I substituted broth for the wine (only because I was out of wine). I adjusted the cooking time down as well.

I loved this recipe.  The veggies literally melted into the sauce. I had pork osso buco at a top rated local restaurant. I made this a week afterward and my husband said this was better. I agree! I did add a gremolata of fresh garlic, lemon zest, parsley and toasted, chopped pine nuts. A good gremolata is a must as it brightens the flavors.

We had this at friends and all agreed it was a 'make again dish'. I added it to my favorites and made it exactly as per the recipe. I love Chef John recipes.

I thought the recipe was fantastic.

I couldn't find pork shanks at the local mega mart. Instead I used some bone-in pork chops that had some good marbling. I added a bit more butter to compensate to compensate for the chops that (I assume) would tend to be a bit drier than the shanks.  They still turned out very tender. 

My only concern with the recipe is the beginning step when the instructions say to sear under high heat using butter and olive oil.  It is my understanding that both butter and olive oil work better in lower heat applications.

I did follow the recipe as instructed, and the butter burned to a dark brown. Not sure if this is the intent.  I think when I make it again I will use vegetable oil, and add the butter later, just before adding flour.

Overall, though, I really liked the way it turned out.  Will become part of the rotation for sure,

I live in North Carolina near the coast. We have access to the most wonderful shrimp and quality fresh pork. Followed the recipe to a tee, and was blown away by the extreme savory flavor. Served over Carolina gold rice. Amazing. I preferred to leave out the zest though...tried it both ways. Leftovers were even better....a lot better!

This was a great recipe. I used lamb neck instead of pork because it was on crazy sale. I think the flour can be reduced by half. I also popped this in the instant pot for 40 minutes after I did all my stove top steps. Thanks so much!

This was a great recipe! I didn't have white wine so I had to used white wine vinegar(1/2 C). I served it over steamed Jasmin rice and it was a total hit. Will definitely make it again.

Tastebud orgasm! Could not find the pork shanks but my wonderful meat manager cut two huge chunks of meat from a pork fresh picnic roast. It turned out fabulous! 

I'd like to put your recipe in my cozy mystery novel where I have recipes in the back. Look for the Alcott Family Adventures: Hot Chocolate, Bitter Chocolate, Spicy Chocolate. This will go in the back of Nutty Chocolate (currently working on it).

I used wild boar osso buco. It wasn't as tender as I was expecting it to be. The sauce was incredible. Overall, I would make the dish again. It was definitely better the next day.

I had a couple of boneless pork chops and needed to serve dinner in a hurry to my starving husband. So I browned the meat in a pressure cooker then throw everything else in and pressure-cooked for 20 min then change the setting to slow cooker for 20 min. The result was amazing! It became like a soup but the taste was incredible. Since then, I doubled the veggies and I've been making this as a super tasty soup.  Some day, I'll make it as it's written though..

It's good but not quite 5 stars.  The sauce is tasty but not overwhelming.  Be sure to sear the shanks before starting.  I used a dry white wine (sav blanc).  I made risotto from scratch to go with it.  Be sure each step is completed--do not rush this recipe.

This did not have a good taste to us at all. I usually love Chef John recipes, and have made quite a few of his dishes (his mushroom gravy is FANTASTIC). I did not care for this particular recipe. I don't know if it was the tomato paste, or the clove, but it did not come out like we expected. I followed the recipe to the letter, did not modify anything. Osso Buco is one of my favorite things to get at restaurants, and this just did not compare. The meat was fall off the bone tender, but the sauce was not to my taste.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I did replace white wine for Red and used beef stock vs chicken broth.   The flavor to this sauce is perfect.   This is officially one of my favorite meals.

Awesome recipe! As always Chef John, you never disappoint!! I used beef shanks, doubled the herbs and only had about 1/4 C of red wine left but I substituted beef broth for the rest and still came out amazing

The taste  was good.  The steps were easy.  But, I must've missed something.  I simmered it for 4 hours, but maybe it was the electric skillet.   The meat was rubbery.  I had to put mine in the blender so I could chew it.  Well I'm putting the leftovers  in a pot like a stew and see if it gets tender.  I will try it again in a different pot.

UPDATE:  took out the bones, simmered in a regular pot.  Made a delicious soup for lunch the next day.  Thanks
