Great marinade! I cut the recipe in half and used Kraft Light Italian dressing. I added a little more olive oil and instead of salt and pepper I used a douple dashes of Montreal Steak seasoning. I let it marinate overnight. Very garlicy and very good!

I used Kraft Light Zesty Italian, accidently doubled the worsheshire sauce and purposely doubled the garlic, and it came out just fine!  So I would say this is a forgiving recipe, since you can screw it up and it still comes out a hit.  Will make again.

We thought this was good and gave the steaks a nice flavor.  I marinated it for about 4 hours and next time I will marinate it overnight or at least 8 hours just to make the flavor a little stronger.

Tasty recipe.  I used a London Broil, marinated for 24+ hours, and tossed it on an indoor grill.  It was very tender and had a nice, twangy taste to it.

This is a good simple marinade which turned out perfect.  I marinaded the steak for about five or six hours and grilled it up and it was very good.  This is a great recipe for someone who doesn't like to experiment with weird flavors like me, simple and good.

This is also good for chicken, pork, vegies and seafood -- however, if you're marinating seafood, only marinate for a max. of a couple of hours, otherwise the seafood gets mushy.

Tastes awesome, I also add a little lemon juice and when the steaks are done, I cover the top of them with goat cheese.  A big hit in my house!!

I used Kraft Zesty Italian marinade & dressing so didn't add any additional garlic and still ended up with delicious grilled steak.  This is my favorite marinade to mix up when it's late at night and I realize I don't have any meat thawed for dinner the next day.  I just add the marinade to a ziploc bag with the frozen steak and let it thaw/marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
