Intriguing ingredients... Fashion-forward color combo... Urban-chic name: "Squid-Ink Pasta with Pink Gorgonzola Sauce." This recipe sets up high expectations immediately -- and the dish delivers deliciously.

The hardest part about preparing this is finding squid-ink pasta, which of course, tastes nothing like squid. It's worth the effort, though -- sans black pasta, it's just Pasta with Pink Sauce. (A rich, full-bodied pink sauce, admittedly ... but the dish just won't present as dramatically as it can.)

That said ... some people (like my dear, but daunted dad) simply will not accept unusually colored food, no matter how tasty. In that case, you might want to go the uncolored pasta route, and dress the plate up with, say, fan-shaped strawberry garnishes or a little unexpected something else.

When I make this dish again, I might stir in some pine nuts for texture, but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing. And that includes the pasta color!   ;)

This was really tasty and very easy to make.  I only changed three things. 1) I didn't have shallots so I used onion chopped very fine instead. 2) I used a sodium free chicken bouillion packet in a cup of water in replace of the chicken stock. 3)I only had a 5 oz package of gorgonzola cheese.  But it was enough even though the recipe called for 8 ozs.

Thought this was a great recipe and a nice change to my normal pasta routine. Since I live in France, most of these ingredients were very easy to find, so I did not have some of the same problems as other users. My only negative remark was the prosciutto. Next time I will add it towards the end as I felt like it was over cooked.

I have to say i did not enjoy this recipe very much, i followed it exactly, but I thought it had a bitter after taste. It might be just me, my husband thought it was ok.

We enjoyed this very much.  I followed the directions exactly and didn't change anything. I would say do not salt the water because it is a salty dish as is. Definitely will make this again!

AWESOME!!! I love the colors, and the taste is phenominal. I omitted the tomato paste, and used sundried tomatoes instead. Definitely a keeper!!

SOOOO GOOD! It was a great change up in my menu. I used half and half instead of milk and used sundried tomatoes instead of tomato paste. The sauce was a bit too thin for me so I added about a half cup of ricotta cheese. I think that the amount of gorgonzola can be reduced some, especially for those who have never eaten it before. the ricotta also helped cut some of the gorgonzola's sharpness.  This was just such a great dish. I also used spinach fettuccine.

I couldn't find squid ink pasta at the grocery store so I used regular bowtie pasta.  Despite this change, it was amazing!!  Sprinkled it with some shredded Italian blend cheese and watched it disappear!

VERY good pasta. I had rave reviews when I made it. Some of the ingredients CAN be hard to find. However- if anyone lives near a SuperTarget I found both the squid ink pasta and the fresh basil there.

I put so much effort into this dish and I wasn't really thrilled about it.  I went to what seemed like a zillion stores to find squid ink pasta so I went with spinach fettucine noodles.  The sauce was expensive between the gorgonzola and prosciutto and wine.  Anyway, after it was all said and done, I served it to my husband who was just as excited as I was to try it.  I think the gorgonzola was too overwhelming.  Sorry.

This was just ok for me.  It really wasn't worth the effort with finding the Black pasta (Which can be found at Liberty heights fresh in Salt Lake City) and my local grocery store didn't have the gorgonzola cheese, so I went to three different places, and I also don't think I'm a fan of the gorgonzola either..  so it might just be me.  My husband did like it though.

Yummy,
Great flavor, I used Vegetable broth because that was all I had around the house.  It was a bit salty, so I would use low sodium broth next time.  I also did not find or use squid ink pasta, I used whole wheat pasta and it was perfect.
Thanks, this is now one of my favorites.

Really a delicious sauce!  I didn't stress myself out by trying to find the black pasta...mainly because my kids would have freaked!  It was a tad bit salty for my taste,,,must have been the gorgonzola...I may scale back a bit on that next time,,but we loved it!  Thanks!

Delicious, quick, easy sauce.  I used plain penne, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty accurately.  This kind of reminds me of a vodka sauce.  Also it is VERY rich, so you might want to scale back on portion size.  Great recipe!

My brother made this for me and my dad maybe... 5 years ago. It was DIVINE! I didn't have any tomato paste so I used sun dried tomatoes. Only thing different was the consistency. Otherwise, P.E.R.F.E.C.T!!! I LOVE gorgonzola!! I omitted the prosciutto only because I was using shrimp (yummies) and next time I'll use baby squid. God I could just kiss you this recipe is so AMAZING!

Thanks!!!

Very good, Clyde!  I didn't have the black ink squid pasta, but it doesn't impress me.  I just used spaghetti- which would have altered the taste IMO.  I made this exactly as written with the exception of only having 8oz of Gorgonzola- I can not imagine it with 16oz- I think that would be all you taste.  It is good and rich and even my 14 yo liked it, but she LOVES blue cheese:)  I will make this again on a limited basis just because it is rich.

I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for my mother and myself, and there was still plenty of sauce left.  I also omitted the prosciutto and substituted mushrooms.  And in all, this turned out to be very good, if very much on the salty side.  I had to put in a lot of pepper to counter the saltiness.  if I made this again I'd definitely use low sodium stock.  The sauce was very thick, which I really enjoyed!  And the black pasta made it look very pretty.  Even though my mom wouldn't eat the black pasta (I made separate plain spaghetti for her), she actually really liked the sauce, which surprised me.  I'll definitely try some suggestions in the reviews...sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts sound wonderful with this!

Pretty good, I would have loved to try it with pine nuts! I added more prosciutto than the recipe called for and that just made it all the better.

To start, i will say that I enjoyed eating this recipe. It was like eating Gorgonzola and It is one of my favorite cheeses.

That being said, the cheese and prosciutto completely overpower the delicate sweetness of the squid ink pasta. It was far too rich and needed more acid to make the sauce balanced.

I am glad I tried the recipe, but would not do so again.

I love squid ink pasta, gorgonzola,  and proscuitto so I figured this was the perfect recipe for us, but this is a case of sum of the whole is not greater than the individual parts.  While enjoyable enough this just didn't live up to all the luxury ingredients it is composed of.

served this sauce with butternut squash raviolli.  Very good.   
next time I make it, I would reduce the amount of liquid (wine and chicken broth).  I simmered for 20minutes and it was still very soupy.

This was absolutely amazing. Super easy to prepare. I used serrano ham "taquitos"; diced yummy bits of serrano ham. I live in Spain so these ingredients were easy to come by. As is always the case with squid ink pasta, it really doesn't bring anyhting to the dish other than the striking color. I did toss on top some roasted shrimp that I marinated in garlic, smoked hot paprika, s&p, olive oil and a little lemon juice. A nice compliment to the finished dish. Surf and Turf. A definite do over in our home, albeit not too often as it is very rich....
