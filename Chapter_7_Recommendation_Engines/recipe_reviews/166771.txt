This was delicous! I started marinading the fish just a couple hours ahead of time.  Then I put the two fillets in a 9x9 pan, drizzled most of the marinade over the top, and then baked it in the oven (covered) at 350 for 15 minutes, and then I uncovered it and baked it at 375 until it was done (probably another 10 minutes, I didn't set the timer).
The salsa is great, too. It really makes enough for about 4+ fillets, but I enjoyed the leftovers with chips, so I don't know that I would ever cut the salsa recipe in half. I paired this with some coconut rice and asparagus. I'll definately make this again.

Great Recipe! I was in a hurry so I pulled out my George Foreman. I set the temp @ 300 & grilled the Tilapia Fillets for 9 minutes. They turned out great! The Mango Salsa adds just the right touch.

Yummy! A little messy but worth it.  I used JDPOP's advice and accompanied this with the Herbed Rice and Black Beans.  Great meal.

This made for a light refreshing dinner.  I did add extra jalapeno.  I served with herbed rice and steamed asparagus. I almost didn't make it when I saw the calorie and fat content.  This must be a typo. A 6oz piece of talipia has roughly 140 calories.  The mango has roughly 110 for 1 cup which is what my mango chopped up came out to.  That is of course divided into for 2 people.  The olive oil is high caloric and fat, but it is in the marinade.  Most stays behind in the bag.  The calories in the rest of the ingredients is small. Nutrition facts on the website need to be more accurate. Great dish.  Thanks for posting.

Very easy and very tasty!  My husband and I both cleared our plates.  I rested the tilapia on a bed of long grain rice that was salted, peppered, with a splash of lemon. I can't wait to make again.

AWESOME Taste!  But beware, I used a charcoal grill and my marinated fish caused the charcoal to flame up more than once!  I only used the ingredients listed to grill, so be careful.  To prevent this fragile fish from falling apart while grilling, I marinated it frozen for 40 minutes.  As far as the salsa, I only left out the jalapeno.  This was because I served the stuffed jalapeno bacon wrap recipe as a side.

This is very good and I personally prefer to make the salsa a day ahead of time to let the flavors merge.

I am the submitter of this recipe.  As many people have noticed, this recipe makes more salsa than you need for 2 servings.  I like the extra salsa for snacking on, but in retrospect I would rewrite the amounts here.  This recipe makes enough tilapia for 2 people but enough salsa for 4.  You can keep it like it is if you like extra salsa, or just make half the amount of salsa for the 2 fillets.  Sorry about that!

I actually made this recipe on a camping trip over a fire - that's how easy it is. My husband and I loved it. This was the first time we tried mango salsa. Excellent meal as is - made no changes. The only thing that would make this recipe easier is a mango slicer. I will be making this dish a lot!

Wow.  We LOVE this recipe.  Not only is it fabulous and beautiful when done fully as the recipe states, but just the fish in the marinade (without the mango salsa) is the best marinade I've ever had for a fish!  So we now have tilapia with just the marinade part of this recipe weekly, and add the mango salsa in on special occasions and for guests :).  We don't break out the grill very often so I use the oven recipe that some other reviewer posted: put 4 tilapias in a 13x9 pan (altering the ingredients accordingly), place all the marinade on top, bake in the oven covered for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then uncover and bake at 375 for ten minutes.  I serve the fish on top of a bed of rice and spinach.  When i serve the fish I pour some of the marinade on top from the 13x9 pan which then adds a little extra flavor to the fish and acts as dressing for the spinach and rice.  So yummy!!!

Absolutely fantastic!  I can't begin to tell you what a hit this was.  I don't like fish, but this really was the best combination of flavors in my mouth.  I didn't grill the fish (live in Minnesota) so I put the fish under the broiler 3-4 minutes per side.  The mango salsa is what makes this dish.  The combination of sweet and hot and peppery was out of this world.  If you're having fish tonight, this is a must!!  Thanks for posting Witzken!!

Awesome! As soon as my husband took a bite, he proclaimed that this is a 5 star recipe. Very easy to make. I followed the directions exactly as written. Personally I don't care for fish, however even I have to admit this recipe is fantastic.

Party in my mouth!! I followed the recipe except I didnt add jalepeno, because the ones I had were TOO hot. I baked @ 350 covered for 15 minutes, then uncovered for about 10 minutes. Will def make over and over again. The mango salsa was very different, but so delicious.

I'm one of those people that has always sworn by the rule that meat and fruit do not belong together in the same dish.  You would not catch me eating pineapple on my pizza...but this recipe made me change my mind!!  I took a chance, gave it a try and loved it.  My husband loved it too.  Just the right balance of salty and sweet, sour and hot.  A taste explosion!  Also, it fits on the Weight Watchers plan without any problems. The nutritional information on this recipe is all wrong unless you plan on consuming all of that oil left in the bag when you take the fish out of the marinade. I reduced the oil in the marinade to 2 tbsp and added a little water.  3 oz of tilapia (2 points), 1 point for the oil absorbed into the fish, and 1 point for 1/2 cup of the mango salsa = 4 points...yummmmm  :)

this has become one of our favorite Summer-time Tilapia recipes.  However, I do simplify it quite a bit!  Instead of all the marinade ingredients, I simply marinate Four 6oz. tilapia filets in zesty Italian salad dressing for 10-15 minutes, then bake them with the dressing coating for 8 minutes per side at 350. (MUCH easier!) 
~
I also cheat a little on the Mango Salsa -- I don't like handling jalepeno peppers, so I used a 4oz. can of chopped green chiles & 1/8 t. of cayenne pepper! (same effect!).  NOTE:  The salsa REALLY needs to sit overnight to let the flavors blend!  
~
Oh--one more thing: if you don't already know how, Google the proper way to dice a mango & it will make your life a lot easier!  (Slice from top to bottom down each side of the hard center core; then dice each half (NOT all the way through the skin) and spread it backwards (like a wide open palm of your hand) and the little cubes just pop off!
~
So, Witzken, thanks for the recipe -- we enjoyed it 4-5 times this past Summer & will have it again occasionally during the Winter for a little tropical break!

This was soooo good! Marinating the fish for as long as possible helps and I like how the flavors work together. I served with jasmine rice and some steamed zucchini. The sauces from the fish and salsa mesh well and were good mixed in with the rice. 

The salsa is delicious, but I would definitely add 1 or 2 more jalepenos for my taste.  Also, I baked the fish in foil with the sauce over it for about 20 minutes at 350 and it turned out perfect. The moisture stayed locked in and it cooked well. I'll definitely be making this again.

One of my favorite fish dishes to make!  I actually use peaches vs mango and like the switch.  This went along nicely with "Quinoa and Black Beans" side dish on here as well as the "Green Bean Bundles" recipe.

This was really good. The salsa had a great, crisp, crunchy, and fresh flavor. The tropical colors looked very appealing. The fish came out just right and tender. I even had enough salsa leftover for a spinach salad with almonds and mandarin orange the next day. No need for dressing because the flavor was that good. You can also use canned mango to save time.

Delicious!  Salsa was awesome and fish had a nice - almost sweet - flavour.  I baked the fish on convection for 25 minutes in foil - perfect!

This was an excellent dish! I cut the oil in half, only marinated for 30 minutes b/c I didn't have time a full hour to wait, and cooked each fillet for 4 minutes on my George Foreman grill. I served it with long grain wild rice and mixed veggies. Yummy!!

I followed the recipe, except I forgot to pick up jalepeno peppers... turned out great anyways. Also did a few boneless, skinless chicken breast--used the marinade--turned out fabulous! Served with spinach salad and jasmine rice.
**Did not grill, cooked on stove

When in a hurry, I use Harry & David's Mango salsa.  I also bake it in the oven instead of grilling. It still tastes great. Delicious!

This was great!  I used mahi mahi instead of talapia because that's what I had in the house.  The mango salsa disappeared.  The fish was nice and juice and I loved the grilled flavor.  Since my fillets were frozen I marinated them for almost 5 hours and quick grilled them.  Delicious!  Made the Herbed Rice and Spicy Black Bean Salad from this site to go with it.  The flavors really went well together.  Added some steamed broccoli and it was a wonderful summer meal.

I have been wanting mango salsa for a long time but had yet to make it.  This recipe was "FANTASTIC!"  I followed it to a "T."  The fish was great.  My family really enjoyed this and I will be making this quite often!

Great!  Salsa was easy, I've never made a mango salsa before!  Also, grilling fish was easy, I'd always been afraid of that too.  This ones a keeper!

Made this for guests and got rave reviews. I did add avocado and cilantro to the salsa as suggested and it was gobble down good by itself.

Excellent and easy recipe! I made the salsa a day ahead (made it with mangoes and strawberries!). I don't have a grill (I live in an apt) but followed another reviewer's baking tip: 15 minutes @ 350 degrees covered and 10 minutes @ 375 degrees uncovered. Will definitely add black beans to the leftover salsa and enjoy with chips.

This is probably the best dish I have ever made from Allrecipes. I followed the recipe, with a few slight modifications: grilled fish on cedar planks, and slightly less jalapeno. It turned out amazing!!!

wow...I love this! Great way to make tilapia flavorful. I used the cilantro in the marinade instead of getting the fresh parsley too, and all lime juice. Also addd some chopped cherry tomatoes to the salsa because I had them and they needed used. Was great, and love having leftover salsa to eat with chips. Have made it twice now, and will do so again!! I didnt use the jalapeno pepper in the salsa because I dont care for it, but did add some red pepper flakes..maybe a teaspoon. gave it a little bite.

Flavorful!  I added fresh pineapple, pear & avocado in with the salsa and used honey instead of sugar.  The leftover salsa is also great with tortilla chips.  We're eating way too much taco salad these days so this worked out perfect.

My family loved this recipe. I've made it twice so far. The first time as written and was terrific, the second time my mango wasn't ripe enough for the salsa so I made it with strawberries and a yellow bell pepper. That was wonderful too! Next time it's going to be papaya and green bell pepper! You could even make this with chicken instead of fish and it would be delish! Thanks so much for this recipe!

PERFECTO!

Simply follow the recipe, and you will please, and please some more!

Only suggestion: If cooking on a charcoal grill like I did, use a set of fish spatulas to avoid having the fish fall apart as you flip it. Also, this will help avoid having the fish undercooked in spots; due to the fear of having it end up in pieces as you try to insure it’s fully cooked.

I am not a big fan of mango... this was outstanding! I needed to increase the amount but only had one mango, so I used a handful of fresh strawberries.  I also didn't have jalapeno; however I did have Grampas pepper relish.  Couple small spoons of that. YUMMY!!!!

The mango salsa is to die for.  Great recipe.  The fish was a little bland and needed something to spice it up.   The salsa killed it.  Nice combination.

This was a little time consuming, but pretty easy overall! The fish was fantastic, but next time I would use 2 mango's, I feel like the amount of onion and cilantro was overpowering in the salsa.

I made this with frozen bass from fishing season surplus. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I didn't use a sweet pepper, just added 1 jalapeno, 1 red chile, and 1 green chile cut up in large pieces so I could pick them out after their flavors had merged with the rest of the dish (I like spicy, but not too hot). I made the salsa the night before and then marinated it with the fish for about an hour before cooking. Then I cooked all of it in a non-stick skillet until the fish was done and the salsa was charred a bit. Lastly, I sprinkled paprika on top of the fish with a bit of lime zest and lime juice. I served it with colored toasted tortilla chips on a bed of fennel and jasmine rice with lemon and lime. The dish smelled wonderfully fragrant (not at all fishy due to the citrus acids) and tasted heavenly! Finally something else to make with bass other than fish and chips! The bass is not as good as the tilapia, but it is still quite good:)

Best thing I have made from this site. I used a different but similar mango salsa recipe only because I knew my family loved it, but the fish was AMAZING! I did not grill it. Just threw it on the skillet with a little oil. YUM! We were fighting the next day over the leftovers.

I really liked this.  It's a different blend of flavors for us, but very interesting, very easy, and very "summery" - we loved it.  Definitely do the salsa a day ahead.

This was so very delicious! The Tiplapia itself was average but the salsa was incredible! The marriage a 5 star! 
I used TJ's frozen mango chunks; they are easier all around! It is so tedious to cut a whole mango! TJ's mangos are frozen but, fresh. They thawed nicely in the salsa and so so much easier to chop into bitty pieces! 
This recipe is a do- again :)

Cooked it in the oven at 350 for 20min. covered and it turned out very moist.  Next time will need to add more jalapeno.  This was very good and easy to make.

For the tilapia: I used Aldi frozen tilapia, seasoned as directions stated and baked in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes. Turned out moist, flakey and delicious! For the salsa: I doubled the mango amount and used cilantro paste in place of fresh cilantro. The salsa was to die for!!!! I can't wait to try this recipe again with some of the suggested variations (like strawberries in place of the mango).

I used the Mango Salsa Recipe and it was great! I only used half of the jalapeno instead and it still added a nice heat.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times and it's always a hit!  Last time I made it the power went out in the middle of preparation.  Not to worry, I lit some candles in the kitchen and turned on the gas stove.  Using my griddle the fish turned out just fine!  Gonna try it with Mahi Mahi tonight...

This is absolutely delicious! The salsa was a little tart for my taste, so next time I will probably only use 1 tbsp lime juice/1 tbsp lemon juice.  I grilled on my George Foreman as well, about 5 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I served with a side salad and coconut rice (cup of uncooked rice, prepared; coconut milk to taste - I used about 1/2 cup; 1 tsp salt; 3/4 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp chopped cilantro).  Everything turned out wonderfully and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING!!! The best way I have ever done to make talapia.I made this last night and my husband is still talking about how delicious it was and when I am going to make it again. The only thing I omitted was the red bell pepper since I didn't have any. I served it with coconut basmati rice and grilled asparagus. I will be making this one for company for sure!. Check out my pic of it under the photos :)

Everybody loved this; even the super picky 11 year old! I thought the mango salsa was a great accent, however, the rest of the family preferred to eat the fish on its own...I've made this three times and it just doesn't disappoint!

The salsa was good, but the prepping of the magos was difficult being my first time ever cutting one myself.

This recipe was quick, easy and most of all Deliscious!!!!  Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  The salsa is also good with tortilla chips and I think would be great on grilled chicken as well.  This will definitely become a summer regular!!!!!

The salsa is perfect.  The marinade for the fish has too much oil.  To cook the  fish I lightly oiled foil, placed the fish added the seasonings, sealed and grilled. Served with the salsa.  My husband and I loved it.   Thanks for sharing.

For someone who is learning to eat fish I have to say this was pretty good.  My only complaint was the strong taste of the cilantro vs the delicate flavors of everything else.  So when I do make this again I may either cut the cilantro in half of leave it out all together.

Wonderful recipe! Advice:  Use gloves when handling the pepper!   This may seem like obvious advice. After experiencing the neverending burn that seemed to have no remedy, I believe that all recipes involving peppers need to have this advice added.   The burn feels as painful as an oven burn.

I would give this ten stars if I could!!  I used the George Foreman grill to cook these as others suggested, and they turned out great.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  I don't even like fish, but this was awesome.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I added a little bit more jalopeno to the mango salsa because we thought it needed a little more bite but it tasted great either way.  I also baked the fish because our grill ran out of gas and it wonderful tasting.

The fish had great flavor.  I loved the marinade.  I will use it again for just the fish.  The salsa was good, but it could have been better if I'd had a sweeter mango.

I was looking for a good tilapia recipe to serve my daughter, who really likes this fish. This recipe was fantastic!  I doubled the salsa ingredients, only because I knew it would be greedily eaten, and I grilled the fish on our gas grill using mesquite wood.  This made the fish taste even better.  The marinade contributed a lot to the flavor and kept the fish moist.  Everything was gobbled up quickly, and I will make this dish again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Heavenly! As other reviewers said, if your cooking more fish than two pieces, you don't need to double the salsa. I totally forgot to marinade the fish so I halved the marinade and brushed it on after it had been cooked. Still tasted great.

Mango salsa is out of this world (5); marinade for the fish -well, we really didn't care too much for that.  It was (as others have mentioned) a little greasy.  Took leftover mango salsa, puree'd it, and then added to some prepared chipolte BBQ sauce which we absolutely LOVE!  Great on grilled chicken and pineapple sliders..........

I only prepared the fish, my hubby “Loved It”! He said it was the most flavorful fish he has ever had. I made one addition to the recipe, sautéed the garlic in a little olive oil. After the garlic cooled down, added it in the bowl. This recipe is a winner!

The mango salsa is great.  Made the dish for my wife as her introduction to cooked fish with a mild flavor.  I'd recommend allowing the salsa to set overnight for a great mix of flavors.

excellent!!!   I have been making this for a few years &  love it!   We had it for dinner tonight & it was wonderful.   I didn't grill the fish outside, it was really hot this afternoon, so I grilled it on the top of the stove.  Wonderful & the salsa is delicious.   It always tastes a little different each time I make it, but it is always good.  I use 2 jalapeno peppers & we like it that way.  I use the recipe as stated otherwise.  It's a great summer meal.

The marinade is delicious--salty and crisp.  Paired with the semi-sweet mango salsa that has a vibrant tang you this dish is amazing!  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like fish wants me to cook this for him.  Be sure you get a ripe mango; but if, like me, it isn't quite there, add a little sugar to help it along.

Made for my meat-eating boyfriend. Very easy to make, and he loved it. I loved the salsa, and I have taken just the salsa to potlucks and received rave reviews.

Very tasty.  Two changes:
1. The marinade is enough for several filets - I had 5, and there was still excess.
2. Perhaps pan-fry the fish?  As it cooked, it began to fall between the grates of the BBQ.

This is great with the chicken too. My fiance does not eat fish, so I did it with the chicken breasts, marinated for a few hours, grilled it afterwards, and then added some mango salsa and voila.... a great dinner dish.

Loved the mango salsa--bright and fresh tasting, an excellent accompaniment to the fish, and I didn't change a thing!  The marinade was also good, but I was surprised that the fish didn't really absorb the flavors.  In spite of the flavorful ingredients, the fish was very mild.  I knew tilapia was very delicate and likely to disintegrate on a charcoal grill grate, so I used my indoor grill.  Will make again.  Thanks for the idea!

This was easy to prep and lovely to eat! A great meal with fresh ingredients. I served this with fresh wilted spinach, which was a perfect compliment to the fish and salsa.

My family loved this! (even the kids who don't like fish!) My husband even said it was good enough to be served in a restaurant. I did make a few changes. We used swai instead of tilapia as it's cheaper and tastes just as good. Other than that, I put the fish in a baking dish and put the salsa on top. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes and it wasn't near done, so cranked it up to 375 for another 10 minutes and it was perfect!

This was amazing!!!! What a fresh tasting dish! My husband loved it and keeps asking for it! I didn't have any parsley and it was fine without it. I had no idea how to peel a mango so that was exciting. I should be better at it next time. ;)

I was so excited to make this after how great of reviews it had, but I was totally disappointed with it. I made 3 changes, I used strawberries (which the recipe suggested instead of mangos), I left out the jalapeno (too hot) and I had to broil it instead of grilling it. I made the salsa a day early (as suggested in recipe) and it was easy and didn't take much time but I found that the strawberries were really soggy and I didn't enjoy the flavor. The fish actually tasted better to me without the salsa than with it. I don't think I would make this again.

My boyfriend is not a huge beef eater and most often will pick fish over anything else.  So I chose this recipe one night and it was the first thing I fixed that he LOVED.  I went ahead and added black beans to the salsa and served the fish over a bed of brown rice. Incredible.

This was the bomb!!!!  My husband loved it and he is not a big fish fan.  He didn't care to much for the salsa but I loved it.  I made chicken the next day and used the salsa with the chicken.  I will definitely be cooking this again.

Really good.  My husband, who doesn't like fish, cleaned his plate.  I used nectarines because I couldn't find a mango at the store.

I followed the recipe exactly, except to toss a handful of diced strawberries into the salsa, and it was delicious! The only thing I would change next time would be to decrease the amount of jalapeno, it was a trifle spicy for me, though my husband thought it was perfect!

This is easy and good.  I used fresh tomato salsa instead.  We don't like fruit.  I will make this again.  Served with Easy Cajun Grilled Vegies.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  My husband said he felt like he was eating a restaurant dish. My stepdaughter who won't touch fish with a ten-foot pole actually went for seconds! Will definitely be making this again and again, especially since mangos are in season.  I just wanted to comment on the amount this recipe yields.  The marinade was enough for about 2 lbs of fish, as well as the salsa.  So I don't see how it can be just for 2 servings. Other than that the recipe is perfect!

As many reviewers have said before, it's the salsa that really makes this dish!  The fish was easy to prepare and the taste was good but it wasn't spectacular on its own.  I may try the salsa again on something like spicy chicken or maybe just cut the mango and pepper into bigger chunks and serve as a side dish.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  Absolutely delicious on a summer night.  I've also just made the salsa and served it with chips.  That was a huge hit!   I served the salsa at a party and people devoured it.   This salsa is also good with shrimp fajitas!  Thanks for the recipe.

Salsa was terrific. I too was a little worried about the mango - we don't traditionally use fruits in our salsa; my husband was VERY sceptical - but we both loved it. Leftover salsa mixed with black beans was great over a salad the next day.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again!  I used the Costco Mango Peach Salsa to save time but look forward to making the salsa in the recipe.  The marinade would be delicious for any white fish.

Wonderful! I used strawberries instead of mangoes, and while they seemed like they could have used a little extra sweetness when they were on the fish, the balance was perfect when I mixed the leftover salsa with black beans. I made additional meals by combining the black bean/salsa salad with rice, which I heated in the microwave, and it was the perfect hot lunch to take to work.

This is a great, easy recipe! I could eat it at least once a week. The combination of the seasoning on the fish alone is amazing and simple. Being mid-winter when we made this we use another user's suggestion to bake the fish for approximately 25 minutes between 350-375 (Keep covered for first 15 minutes). Black beans and rice complimented this recipe very well.

I really liked the salsa, but I didn't think the marinade enhanced the fish much.  Maybe it needed to sit in the marinade longer, but I know you shouldn't go TOO long with fish.  Also, our tilapia was falling apart on the grill.  Maybe it's a thinner variety (the packages at Sam's Club), but I think I would bake it next time.    This recipe definitely has potential.  My husband liked the taste but said he thought the salsa should be warmed instead of cold since it was on hot fish.  He'll try the leftovers that way, so we'll see.

GREAT RECIPE!Im not very familiar with coking fish but this was very easy. I used strawberrys instead of mango because that was all I had and used my oven instead of grill( only because mine was out of fuel) I cooked it at 375 for 25 min. I will be making this again soon!!

Really good fish.  We has too much mango salsa but it was good the next day once we bought some tortilla chips.

This was pretty good.  I found that we both pushed the mango salsa aside because it overwhelmed the flavor of the fish.  But, an overall tasty dish.

WOW! What a great meal for my dinner party.  I enjoyed making the Mango Salsa and because it made so much, I chilled some and served part of it as an appetizer with baked Nachos.  It was fantastic.  The fish had such a wonderful flavor with the maranade.  I found it a little hard to grill becuase Tilapia is somewhat fragile, but I made sure the grill was oiled good and was hot.  Some of the fish broke apart which made the presentation a little hard, but that didn't matter because it was so good.  I highly recommend this if you like fish, even if you don't it's so mild with the Mango Salsa you wouldn't even know it was fish. Give it a try!

My husband claims this was "5 star restaurant quality", and I have to agree! I made this as directed, but used corvina instead of tilipia. We served this over Jasmine rice, and I felt like I was eating a nice dinner on a Caribbean island. The flavors worked so well together, and we really enjoyed this.

This was super for supper!  Fresh tilapia is  key.  The only changes I made were to add some chopped cilantro, a little garlic, strawberries, and some agave nectar to the salsa.  It was top notch.  My husband even said he would order this if it were at a restaurant!  Nice.

Fabulous and easy and quick! A go-to for scrumptious dinner. (Made as-is the first time. Now make it with mahi mahi because it’s our preferred fish. And no longer measure ingredients, just throw it all together and it’s just so good!)

My family loved this. I used frozen mango that I thawed for the salsa. I also added a tomato to the salsa. I baked it in the oven like two other reviews.  I served it with white rice and black beans and broccoli. Delicious.

Unbelievably great.  The mango salsa is incredible.  When I don't have time to marinate the fish, salt, pepper and garlic powder do the trick and the salsa makes the meal.  BTW, I use swai now instead of tilapia... same taste, bigger filets.

Have made the salsa to serve with other dishes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so flavorful?? I completely forgot the mango salsa in the refrigerator. But it didn't need it. I followed the instructions on baking at 350 for 15 mins covered. Remove cover bake for 10 mins more at 375. Pour the marinade over fish before baking. Thank you for this recommendation!

I have made it 35 years having never cooked fish, so I was very nervous and even made dessert in advance as a pre-emptive apology to my husband.
Holy heck!  This is one of the best things I have ever tasted, and I don't like fish!!!
I sauteed mine, 4 minutes on each side. Otherwise, I stuck to this glorious recipe, and my man and I are glad I did. Thank you so much!   
I have pulled many recipes from this site, but have never felt compelled to join.  I haven't even done the dishes yet, but I wanted to take a moment and vote 5 stars!!!!

I made the salsa the night before and it was perfect. I didn't have tilapia so I used some snapper that we caught and it was to die for. I will use this recipe again.

While the fish was great, the salsa was even better. I never had mango salsa before, but I will again. Make sure to pick a ripe mango. Having not used mangos much, I got a few and quickly figured out ripe ones are needed for,this to work.

Made this tonight after deciding not to go to the market.   Used 2 frozen filets, dried herbs, leftover taco shells and canned mango. Except for being too salty for my taste this was awesome.  I don't like salt and next time I'll cut back.  This will be me new taco go to. And I salsa left for tomorrow's salad.

Fabulous.  I would use 3/4 tsp pepper next time, slightly less lemon and lime juice and slightly less oil.  I cooked the fish in foil packets.  Together with the mango salsa, it tasted like a restaurant quality meal.

This is so good I can hardly stand it.  I did use strawberries instead of mangoes because that's what I had on hand.  I also used an orange bell pepper instead of red just to keep it more colorful.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  We will definitely have this often!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

This was a great recipe. I actual messed up and  added the "full" quantities of the spices for the fish together and it still tasted great! Very flavourful. And the mango salsa was a great addition.

Salsa was amazing. I was hesitant to put a whole jalapeno in it but the sweetness of the mango balanced it out perfectly. Just for the salsa alone it was worth it!

I ended up baking the fish after marinating it while it thawed, and it is very flavorful (in a good way!).  I baked it at 350 under tinfoil for ten minutes, then uncovered at 375 for fifteen minutes. I made an extra little half-fillet to nibble off while I put the real dinner in the fridge to save until the fiance gets home from work, but I'm finding myself tempted to eat my dinner portion before he comes home anyway.

I'm serving it with corn on the cob.... because my fiance hates fish and I want to make sure he has dinner if he doesn't like this, haha.

This recipe is absolutely lovely as it's written. I always do it the way the cook intended first. It was delicious, I only deviate in amounts of ingredients... some things I like more than others and I dump more cilantro in than I'm sure the law allows. LOL This is one of the ones that my family and I love... AS WRITTEN. Duh. LOL

Good flavor of the tilapia. We added a Serrano pepper to give salsa a little more kick. Family loved it.

This recipe is so amazing. I am not a fish person but have been slowly trying to introduce it into my diet because my boyfriend loves it. I enjoyed this so much and the flavors where so amazing. I thought maybe a whole jalapeño would be too spicy but the sweetness of the mango really balanced it out perfectly. This is going in my recipe box and will be making it weekly!!! It's a must try!

I’m trying to expose my children to different foods and this was a great recipe for that.  They’ve had mango but not like this.  The dish was colorful, tasty and enjoyed by all.

Full of flavor, delicious! This is one of our favorite fish dishes. The only change I made was to the Tilapia marinade, using fresh cilantro (about a tablespoon chopped) instead of parsley. Will make this again & again!!

I didn’t have olive oil so just used vegetable oil, and I used garlic powder instead of the 1 clove minced.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and I must say it was AWESOME!!!  I served the fish next to fresh green beans and a lime & cilantro rice.  I believe this will be a reoccurring meal for my household.
**I’m kind of a sissy when it comes to jalapeno’s, so I was a little concerned about adding one whole pepper to the salsa, but it was PERFECT!!  
Two thumbs up and 5 stars for me & my familia

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe except that I did not have any bell pepper on hand so I used cucumber. I had another mango salsa recipe with lime juice that had cucumber in it so I know that the ingredients make for a tasty combination. I served the tilapia on a bed of lemon basil quinoa and topped it all with the mango salsa. Great summer meal that leaves you feeling healthy but not deprived.

Very good recipe made just as is.  I broiled the tilapia instead of grilled because tilapia can so easily fall apart.

This recipe is delicious!!  I used swai filets and broiled the fish covered in foil at 500 for 15 minutes, then removed foil and broiled another 5 minutes.  The salsa is a lot of work, but soooo worth it! Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This is a wonderfu, healthy, fresh and easy recipe. The only change I made was to use parsley instead of cilantro, as my daughter doesn't like cilantro. I had the salsa on a vegetarian soy cutlet, and it was really delicious. So nice that there is no fat in the salsa. Served with roasted asparagus and coconut rice for a delicious and light dinner. Thank you!

I've made this twice, exactly as listed. However, I hate when fish falls apart on the grill so both times I wrapped the fillets in foil and grilled them for 10 minutes. Of course, if you're going to wrap them you could easily use the oven as well.
The salsa is very good. Made it with mango the first time and fresh peaches the second time. I think I prefer the peaches. Used the leftover salsa on burgers the following night.

My family LOVED this recipe - there was nothing left on anyone's plate.  I made it exactly as the recipe states - except I had no jalepenos so I omitted them.  Also, I only had time to marinate the fish for about 20 minutes - the meal still turned out excellent.  I will use this often for entertaining because it's so easy, pretty inexpensive, and a gorgeous dish.

We served this for our daughter's 21st birthday dinner.  It was a huge hit. It actually wasn't too expensive even for our crowd of 11.  Served with rice, salad and asparagus.  It got rave reviews and all wanted the recipe.  Will definately make this one again.

Really easy to make.  I made the salsa at the same time as the marinade so the flavors melted together.  Very yummy! Would not change a thing.

Didn't much care for the marinade for the fish but I enjoyed the mango salsa. The rest of the family said they would have preferred the fish without the salsa.  I would have halved the jalapeno since it was a bit too potent for me.  Very good recipe though. Thanks.

Excellent recipe I even made with chicken instead of tilipia both are delicious.  I was hesitant about the jalepeno making the salsa spicy but it wasnt at all.

One of my favourite summer meals! The ingredients were intimidating at first but once I made and tasted this dish, I realized how worth it this was. My brother who hates fish said it was the best fish dish he's ever had. One thing I would recommend is if your making this for a dinner party, buy the mango's ahead of time and not the day of. I found it hard to find a good, ripe one. If they're too hard the salsa isn't nearly as good.

A really good, fresh tasting entree. I thought the marinade used to flavor the fish was outstanding. Served this with an herbed basmati rice on the side.  Will be putting this in the rotation of favorites.

This is excellent.  Have made this quite a few times, for a week night dinner and for company. This is my 8 year olds favorite dish!  tip: Make the mango salsa the night before or early that morning

I made this with strawberries instead of mango, and it is FANTASTIC!  I marinated the fish for about 3 hours, grilled them on the indoor grill, served over warm coconut rice with grilled pineapple slices for dessert.  New favorite way to have tilapia!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! We marinated the fish over night. My husband loved it so much that he liked the plate (lol). He normally cooks for us. But, we recently married and I thought I'd step up my game. You CANNOT go wrong with this recipe.

Great recipe that has joined the list of family favorites -- get the grill accessory to hold fish in place.  Mango salsa is fabulous with fish -- recipe makes more than needed for two, but the salsa alone with some multi-colored tortilla chips would make an attractive, delicious, and healthy dish for entertaining or parties.   It will be served a lot here during football season.

For someone who doesn't care for mango and who doesn't typically mix fruits with veggies, I loved this recipe!! My husband loves mango and felt like I should have left out the jalapenos because it masked the mango too much but I thought it was perfect!!! Definitely going to share this one!

Perfect! Whole family loved it. We left out the jalepeno since our family isn't into spicy. Tilapia is so thin, I used a grilling pan on my stove to cook the fish and it turned out just as good. Plus, the house smelled awesome while cooking it.

This is a great recipe, and both components are strong on their own.  You could easily use the fish portion for tacos or with a bit of lime, and I suspect that the salsa would be great pulsed once or twice in a blender and served with chips.
I was tempted to skimp on the oil, and was glad I didn't when it came time to flip it on the grill.  I thought the jalapeno would make it too hot, but it was just right, and I may even throw in a few seeds next time.  I added a pinch of coarse lemon salt in the marinade and it sure didn't hurt.  Served it over a bed of brown rice, and it was totally satisfying.

I have used this recipes for years...Absolutely love the Tilapia marinade. Everyone I feed this too asks for the recipe even non-fish-eaters. No need to tweek this marinade it is perfect on its own. Not so keen on the mango salsa but I have never liked Mangos.

EXTREMELY GOOD!! Marinate the fish the day before! Used strawberries instead of mango. If you make salsa the day before there's alot of (very tasty) juice in the salsa. If you do not, the obviously isn't. We served with rice.

Tilapia is my favorite fish and this was an excellent way to prepare it to get a little different flair. And SO healthy. Next time could use 2 or even 3 jalapenos to suit our need for a kick! I served with grilled asparagus and wild rice. yum!

Really easy to make.  I messed up by putting the fish directly on the grill instead of leaving in the foil.  This was my first time preparing fish and it came out great.

My family loved this! What I should have done was set aside some salsa for the kids before I put the jalepenos in.

Husband loves the Mango Salsa and ate the rest. 2 servings of the salsa was just enough for our family.

My husband who isn't a huge fish fan LOVED this! He said it was by far the best meal he's had in a long time.  I used dry parsley because I forgot to buy fresh, but it still tasted great. We will definitely be making this again :)

I made this for family and they raved!  The only thing I would caution is the amount of kick added to the salsa - I only used one pepper and it was still pretty spicy for our taste.

This is such a light and delicious dish. I used Mahi-Mahi because we don't like tilapia and I just sprayed olive oil on the fish instead of 1/3 cup.

Absolutly fabulous! I made dinner for a few anti-seafood family members and had them asking for seconds. This is a great summer dish too because we made everything on the grill and didnt heat up the house.

Delicious!! The fish is seasoned with a yummy blend of salt and herbs, and is so good when paired with the sweetness of the salsa. I served it with coconut rice and put the salsa on top of it as well. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

It is also just as delicious re-heated the next day!

I loved the marinade and will use it again. The mango salsa was good but when I used it I couldn't taste the fish.  I put it over a green salad with crumbled bacon and vinegar. nice.  So I guess I liked both recipes just not together.

I made this for my boyfriend as his introduction into tilapia, and he LOVED it.  It's not hard at all to make, although hand-cutting up the mango does take some time.  The mango salsa is delicious, I could eat it all by itself!  Great for people who do not like fish, since the sweet fruits give it a nice flavor.

SO good!  I didn't have time to get everything and we had tilapia ready in the fridge.  I took this recipe and used what I had- olive oil, lime juice, garlic salt and pepper to marinate.  Marinated for about 20 minutes and then grilled.  I also had mango/peach salsa in the fridge so I threw that on top.  It was delicious and my husband LOVED it.   Very easy, very quick and very delicious!

My rating is for the marinade portion of this only.  I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for one hour.  Our tilapia grilled up beautifully with nice subtle flavor!  Nothing overpowering here!

This was great! I didn't have time to marinate for the full hour, but will next time... maybe even longer. I served it over jasmine rice- very pretty presentation. I only used 1/2 a jalepeno, which was plenty (and we like spicy!). Maybe my mango was a little smaller than average? The cook time was perfect on the fish.

This was okay.  The fish was good, the salsa was good, they just didn't seem to go well together.  And mangoes are such a pain in the neck!!  I'm canning this recipe and I'm going to replace it with "Halibut with Zesty Peach Salsa" from this site.

Great recipe - LOVED the Mango Salsa and I'm planning on making some more to serve the next time I grill pork tenderloin.  We made fish tacos out of this recipe by placing shredded purple cabbage on a flour tortilla and then topping with the fish and salsa.  The only change I made was to use an anaheim pepper instead of a jalapeno (didn't have jalapeno on hand) and because my mango was a little under-ripe, I microwaved my salsa for 1 minute on 80% power just to bring out the juice a little.  Dinner was delicious!

I used a lot of shortcuts on this recipe because I'm usually running short on time. For the marinade, I used 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, about 1/2 cup lemon pepper marinade (Lawry's brand), some dried parsley flakes, and salt and pepper, sprinkled in. I mixed all that in a bowl, and poured into a ziploc bag then added 4 tilapia filets, tossing the filets until they were well coated. I let them sit in the bag, in the fridge, for about an hour.  Following other reviews, I then baked them covered at 350 for 15 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes at 375. For the mango salsa, they sell that in ready-to-buy containers at Super Target in the produce section. I topped the filets with the salsa once they came out of the oven. Yum, very good!

This was great and easy! Mangoes aren't exactly in season here... but if I had used a mango that was actually ripe (oops) this would have been out of this world! We used the leftover salsa on spinach to have a light salad lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was easy and turned out wonderful!  My kids Loved it!!!  I didn't have Mango so I used peaches and strawberries for the salsa and served over a bed of Couscous.  We will have this again soon.

I loved this!  The tilapia was perfectly seasoned, and the salsa (I made with a mix of mangoes and strawberries) was a perfect blend of flavors.  I did find the red onion to be a bit overpowering, would probably half it next time.

I'm just learning how to cook, and this recipe is not just easy but delicious-- one of the best things I've ever made. I'm not very good at chopping, so the salsa takes me a while, but otherwise everything here is very simple. I followed another reviewer's tips for baking-- 15 minutes covered at 350 degrees and another 10 minutes uncovered at 375-- and the fish came out perfectly.

The fish was good, but the mango salsa was EXCELLENT. I'll definitely be making that again to go along with lots of other things. I made two changes: I pan fried the fish since I don't like grilling and I tossed in a few shrimp as well. It was delish!

This recipe was so delicious and easy to make! I suggest you leave the tilapia marinating for a day or so it really adds to the flavor. Yum and good for you :)

This was very good.  I actually made it in the oven (I don't have a grill) and it came out fine.  Next time I would probably add some avocado.  I actually meant to make a different recipe, also on this site, but glad I did this one.  Would do it again.

Delicious combination!  I used strawberries AND mango, and flaked the fish after cooking.  Then we served the fish and salsa with drained black beans over fresh spinach.  So healthy, tasty, and filling!

AWESOME! Husband loved it and he isn't a big fan of mango's. Our 2.5 year old ate the fish without the salsa and loved the marinade. Next time I will probably make it without the Jalapeno but other then that it was amazing.

I give the tilapia a 5!  I marinated it a little longer (more like 4 or 5 hours) and the flavors were so powerful that the tilapia was great alone even without the salsa.  Great salsa recipe, but if you don't have the time or ingredients to pull it together the fish stands alone wonderfully!

This was easy and delicious! I actually substituted apricots for the mango because I have a ton of them right now... it was tasty but I bet it would be better with the mango.

I love when something this healthy can be so deliscious. I will probably make the receipe again just for the mango salsa which is really good with chips.  I wasn't able to use the grill so I made the fish a bit different.  I marinated them and then dipped in egg and panko and fried in the skillet in a few tablespoons on oil.  It was so tasty topped with the salsa!  FYI, mangos are pretty gross when not ripe so make sure the one you buy is slightly soft and has a pine scent to it.

I was disappointed.  Followed the recipe closely, for three fillets.  The salsa seemed totally unrelated to the flavors of tilapia (which broke up on the grill). I like tilapia, I like mango, but will use them other ways

This recipe was great! I was worried about the marinade for some reason, but it turned out amazing, I used cilantro instead of fresh parsley because I prefer cilantro, but I highly recommend this and I can't wait to use it again!

We tried this fish last week and it is simply scrumptious!  The tast of the fish was the best we've ever had!  I wasn't too sure how we'd like the salsa but it too was the tastiest ever.  I will make a double recipe of the salsa next time!  It is very good when scrambled with an egg.  Amazingly great recipe!

Made just the Mango Salsa part of this recipe and it was absolutely delicious!  Will definetely make again and try using strawberries for a variation. My entire family enjoyed this salsa. BTW, substituted chili pepper flakes because I could not het the jalepeno.

I changed it a little. I coated the talapia in honey dijon dressing and coated it with coconut and french onions and baked it. I then topped it with the mango salsa mentioned here.. it was AWESOME!! probably one of my favorite recipes, and it was really easy!

Yum and fancy.  Like a $25 plate at a restaurant.  I served it w/ basmati rice and corn.  It was a lot of work, but maybe next time it will go faster. I did make 5 servings, so that requrires a lot more mango peeling.  I felt like there was a lot of extra salsa left, so either we didn't eat enough or I could've made less (which would take less time).

I'm not sure if the mangos that I used were sweet enough or maybe the mango salsa was just not to my taste. But the marinade was wonderful and I will definitely use it again to marinate fish and I might even try chicken. The mango salsa was beautiful to look at so I will definitely try it again.

This was wonderful. I used parsley because I don't like cilantro and it came out good. I baked my fish and used spices on hand; it's not the fish that you need to worry about because the salsa is what makes the dish.This is one of them dishes that you use to impress your picky mother in law.

Excellent recipe!  I had never grilled fish before and this was great!  All the family ate the fish and my husband didn't stop raving about the salsa.  He ate the left over salsa by itself the next day!  I prepared everything exactly according to the recipe and it was wonderful.

I thought the fish was ok, but I did not like the salsa at all. This was the first time I cooked with cilantro and I did not like the flavor.

This meal was awesome! I baked the tilapia instead of grilling it and put the filets on a bed of brown rice. I also added kiwi and avacado to the salsa. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was great.  I pan seared the fish instead of grilling and it turned out great.  I probably would add a bit more salt to the fish since it didn't really have too strong a taste, but the mango salsa was wonderful.  I will make this again.

Very good, the salsa would compliment almost any meat or fish. I don't have a grill, so I pan-seared the Tilapia instead. Next time I think I will skip the marinade and simply rub some spices on the fish, it was a bit too oily for my taste.

This recipe was very good!  My son even liked it.  The only thing I will probably change next time is how much jalepeno I put in.  This was probably the best recipe I have tried for fish!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a great meal this was! The grilled tilapia had such a wonderful flavor and the mango salsa was so refreshing, an interesting mix of flavors but they all worked. I added one avocado and 2 roma tomatoes to the salsa as well. Very Good!

I don't like seafood. I tried Tilapia on a trip and found that I liked it. I have never cooked fish before EVER.  Let me just say, there was nothing left in my plate nor my boyfriends plate. This is an excellent recipe!!

AMAZING! I would recommend using mango and strawberries. I doubled the salsa recipe and used 1 mango and 1 cup of diced strawberries. The mango and strawberry combination was perfect. Instead of grilling, I cooked the fish in a frying pan with the marinade. Served over rice, this meal looks and tastes like something from a restaurant!

My hubby liked this mango salsa better than the other one on this site I usually make.  I used a little bit of roasted red pepper in place of the red pepper b/c it's what I had.  The salsa would be good with a little avocado thrown in too!  I had a problem with the fish sticking to the grill, that is my only complaint.

This recipe Rocks!  It was a hit this weekend with the family.  I do recommend making the salsa a day in advance,  allowing all the flavors to mesh together,  It was twice as good the second day!  Loved it!  I new family meal.

Loved this! The marinade for the fish and the grilled flavour were amazing! I loved the mango salsa too, my husband wasn't as big of a fan of that. My mango was really ripe and perhaps this made the salsa too sweet for his liking.

I made this for something different.  I was a little afraid of the mango as I am not very familiar with it so I did 1/2 strawberries 1/2 mango.  As I was serving it I was a little afraid to try it, there is so much going on.  I am glad I did.  It was SO good I think I will make it again tonight. I made a double batch and had it for lunch and still want more!

Awesome!  My husband wants us to add it to the family recipes.  I served it over brown rice with grilled veggies.  We placed the fish in aluminum foil packets, but i wouldn't recommend this method, as it was difficult to peel off.  I would also make sure you use a small jalepeno, as the salsa came out a little hot for our taste.  Wonderful recipe though. Thanks!

This was excellent!!  Everyone in the family loved it!  I baked the tilapia in the oven, broiling it at the end.  I also added strawberries as someone had suggested.  It was super!  I'll definitely be making this again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The second time I made it I substituted thinly sliced chicken cutlets in place of the tilapia just because I had chicken on hand. It was equally as delicous. Thank you for the recipe.

Great, easy-to-make recipe!  Esp. if you live in the tropics.  Here in Thailand it easy to get almost all of these ingredients all year round (except the parsley).  The fish is flavorful and delicate and mango salsa adds something special!  We polished off the whole bowl in one sitting!  Would definitely make this again!

Fantastic.  The whole family loved it. Fish was most and salsa a great compliment.  I added red pepper flakes and a bit of red hot sauce to the marinade.  The heat complimented the cool salsa.  My 9 year old son added even more Franks hot sauce to it.  Served it with a side of black beans and rice.  Yum yum!

delish!  prep is easy because most of the work can be done ahead of time (marinade/salsa.)  only takes ~10 minutes on the foreman and dinner is ready!

This was a huge hit for my daughters birthday dinner.Everyone absolutely loved it. Your right,the salsa is awesome! The recipe was more than enough for 4 pieces of tilapia.Couldn't get enough of it.I baked the tilapia on 375 for the 25 minutes.It was such a refreshing taste with the mango flavor in it.Presentation was beautiful. I made rice pilaf and fresh green beans almondine,a salad and fresh bakery bread. THANK YOU!!!!

This recipe was great! I added a few touches to maximize health benefits. I added 5 strawberries to the salsa and used only 1 tbsp of olive oil in the marinade plus 2 tbsp of water. I also had to broil the fish because of no gas hook-up for grill. It still came out absolutely delicious!

Wonderful!!! I used about 6 strawberries instead of mangos (store did not have the kind I like). It was a very gourmet meal and can't wait to make it with the mango. You don't even need the salsa as the fish tasted so good on its own!!! I grilled my fish in foil packets for 3-4 min on each side.

This was so good, fresh and healthy! My husband doesn't like sweet sauces on his fish, so I mixed up everything in the salsa except the mango and divided it into two bowls. I put chopped tomato in his to make a pico de gallo, and put mango in my half. It was delicious! The fish marinade had a wonderful flavor also. Will definitely make this again!

Wow! This was great. I am not one to have fruit on my meals, but I made this meal for relatives who love fruit on food. I did not change a thing. I read all of the reviews and i do think strawberries would be great also , maybe a combo of mango and strawberries! This will be a meal i will make over and over.

DELICIOUS and beautiful. 
Amazing combination, but I would also make the salsa again by itself, it's great with anything.

My alterations: I baked instead of grilled (easy clean up and doesn't fall apart), I used cilantro for the marinade as I lacked fresh parsley, I used thawed frozen mango for the salsa and a handful of fresh strawberries, also added a scant amount of brown sugar to it to bring out the sweetness of the fruit. When the fish was done marinading and had gone to bake, I boiled the marinade on the stove to sterilize it and mixed it with some rice for a nice side compliment. 

A good amount of prep, but entirely worth it. A fantastic meal.

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I prepared the salsa and started marinating the fish 2 days ahead.  Will definitely make this again and want to try it using pork chops or pork tenderloin.

This was fantastic. We doubled the recipe and substituted a different hot pepper because they were out of jalapenos and it was still great. My husband thinks it had too much cilantro but that seems to be something people either love or hate. Next time I think i'll make 2 batches and put half with cilantro and half without.

outstanding!  when cooking the fish I suggest grilling 90% on the first side before flipping it and finishing it for a minute or so after that. That technique helps to keep the fillet from breaking apart. Also,  it's enough salsa for 4 fillets.

I used canola oil instead of olive oil.  I let it marinade for about 3 hours.  I left out the jalapenos.  I used canned diced mangos drained.   I baked it with the marinade covered at 350 for 15 minutes and then uncovered for another 10 minutes.  My husband and I loved it.  I will definitely make it again!

The fish marinade is exceptional, highly recommended. I used the fresh parsley... not sure how much it mattered, but WOW was this good. Already had mango salsa made so I didn't use that part of the recipe. Served over mexican fried rice. This will be a frequent flyer at our house.

The only substitution I made was I used cod. This is probably one of the best fish recipes I’ve ever had including at a restaurant and I work at a seafood restaurant. I have a mango tree in my backyard and didn’t really know how to use them, problem solved

the marinade  itself could use  a smidge more salt  ( personal taste).
Served it with steamed potatoes and asparagus.
Loved it and will do it again.

Wanted to really elevate the flavor and made coconut rice with it and I was not disappointed. Baked the fish in the oven and pour the juice/marinade over the rice. Even better the next day!!

Very light dish, easy to make. I paired it with long grain wild rice. I love mango salsa, but have never tried it with fish. It was enjoyable!  Yes, I'd make it again, maybe add more spice to marinade as I tend to like more flavor.

We LOVED this meal!!! It has so much flavor! Easy to prepare, very little clean up and really enjoyable for a warm spring night! We paired it with some veggies and were both full and content, yet didn't feel like we overrate! White wine to top it all off.

This recipe is a winner. I didn’t have time to marinate the fish so I put the marinade in a fry pan and sautéed the fish.  The fish was tasty right out of the pan but the mango salsa made it delicious. It is definitely a keeper.

Followed the recipe.  I agree the salsa improves as it chills so make it ahead.  I pan seared the tilapia and served it with lime cilantro rice.  My mango could have been more ripe;  next time I’ll make sure it is.

Made the salsa with both mango and strawberries... yummy! Next time I’ll add black beans.  Made no changes to the marinade.  Served with rice.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar to the salsa. I also substituted Orange Roughfy Tilapia, This was as close to a high end restaurant dish as any  recipe I've fixed in quite some time. Cant' wait to do it for the family dinner on Sunday.

I do have to confess that I made mine with cod and not tilapia, simply because I detest tilapia......it tastes like dirt......and often is from sewage-type waters.   It turned out fabulous!!!!  This is such a great salsa.......and -0- points for those in Weight Watchers.   I could eat that salsa on everything!

Olive oil not a good way to marinate fish and cold salsa on top of hot fish is too weird for a hot meal.
Not something I would recommend.

Husband and teens enjoy this recipe.  I broil it and it is done in no time - no mess!  3 min flip, 3 min flip, 2 minutes - done.  I put extra cilantro and lime on the side for my husband.  He's high maintenance.

I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used fresh basil instead. Also, instead of BBQ grill, I pan fried it. Easy to make and taste great!

This was awesome!  Tilapia is one of the only types of fish that my kids will eat so we have a lot of it in our house.  This made it so much more interesting.  The salsa was delicious and even taking a bite of fish alone, the flavor from the marinade was light and fresh and delicious.  I made this as-written and the only thing I would change next time is perhaps making the salsa first thing in the morning so it has the day for all of the juices and flavors to meld.

I didn't have time to marinate it so I added a little olive oil and garlic to the salsa.  I liked it so much that I do that all of the time.  I've made this several time now.  Friends rave about it.  My husband even eats fish that doesn't have to be deep fried now and he'll eat the salsa with a spoon!

Bearutiful presentation. My guests who are foodies were wowed. They loved it and so did my husband who normally prefers tartar sauce with his fish. I used Sea Bass and served over Saffron rice with asparagus. Every body wanted the recipe. Dicing the Mangos was easy once I got the hang of it. Once I sliced it along the sides of the pit, I made small hash marks down to the skin, then cut it in half to create small dice, then scooped out what was left in the skin. Much easier than removing whole side and then trying to dice into small pieces. It does take a while to do the salsa, make it a day ahead to allow the flavors to meld.

I made this and did not follow any of the recommended portions for the salsa or the marinade. I added how much I wanted of every ingredient.  I am one of those freedom cookers but I don't have enough imagination to create my own dishes. Regardless of how I did not follow directions, it turned out wonderfully. You can't bust this one!

Carnival of summer color and tastes.This is now my favorite fish recipe. Definitely a summer delight for the grill. I would use a fish grilling cage because our grill grates are just too wide and fish too delicate. Family members who hate fish went for seconds. Recipe is perfect as is but at times I substitute green onions for red because I have them around. For ease I accompanied meal with the new zatarains boxed lime rice in Caribbean reggae theme  , sliced avocados over salad and watermelon for dessert. For a light summer drink, served dinner for adults and children, iced lime seltzer with a dash of pomegranate/ cranberry Pom juice and lemon /lime slices.

I'm not a huge fish fan but I'm trying to add some to my diet as it's a low fat/calorie protein and it has great health benefits. This was delicious and I will definitely eat it again. I reduced the oil and replaced the liquid with water.

This is a good mango salsa! I liked the ease of it better than others that I looked at. I will keep it and make it again! My jalepeno was hot, and my hubby doesn't like HOT so I added  in some extra onion and a tomato diced seeds removed and that dulled it a bit to our liking, also added a T of sugar to balance it out. Whole family loved it! Will be great with fish too...Thanks so much for sharing.

The family loved it.  I cooked the fish over charcoal and gave it that nice grilled flavor.  Next time I will add a serrano to the salsa to give it a bit more heat.

My family and I LOVE this! The fish was awesome and the salsa was even better. I tripled the salsa recipe and had some with chips last week... I just made another batch! This is a winner!!!

I don't know what this cook was smoking but we did the salsa with strawberries like the suggestion said and this was NOT good. Too salty so I had to add sugar to even it out. The veggie-to-fruit ratio was too high. The picture looks like it's
Mostly mango but made it and it's definitely more veg than fruit. Thumbs down for the salsa. But the fish marinade was still good. Silver lining. Boom.

I made it as per the recipe along with the salsa. The salsa is perfect I think the tilapia has a little too much salt. We made tacos FUN!

Skip the basil; not a great fit for the other spices/with the Mexican spiced salsa. I suggest even trying cilantro instead if you still want to add 2 herbs. I baked it at 375 for 15 mins on a broiler pan, turned and baked an additional 5 while upping the temp to 400 to help it get a bit of carmelization on the edges. Great salsa!! :)

Mix the marinade into a frying pan and marinate the fish in the pan on low, low heat while preparing the mango salsa, very slowly the marinade with evaporate off. 
Place frozen mango/strawberry Caribbean fruit and other salsa ingredients into Pampered Chef salsa maker. Used tsp's rather than tbsp's of lemon and lime. Chopped while a little frozen to maintain shape.
Once the salsa is finished, set aside and fry the fish. May have to add butter while frying.

We make this recipe weekly at my house. I don't usually do the mango salsa, and I use 1/2 the amount of pepper bc I feed it to my toddler. Served over a bed of rice this is amazing!

I made it with out the mango salsa, as we're not fans.  The marinade is simple, but good.  I've used it for grilling other fish and it works well on Cod and Salmon.

REALLY  good mango salsa recipe.  Made as written, no changes.  Will definitely make again as we love tilapia--and all the ingredients in the recipe.  Nice light dish and healthy too.  
Thanks for submitting.

Out of this world!!! Restaurant quality flavors! I inhaled it:) I made the recipe exactly as written just wish I had a better mango than what I used but the flavors were delicious. I also made this same recipe using chicken for my husband who does not care for tilapia. He gave the grilled chicken version 5 stars as well. I drizzled the chicken with a little bit of olive oil then I let it rest for 10 minutes. Servered both topped with mango salsa and cilantro lime rice.

I used swai.. substituted sweet red baby peppers instead of bell peppers.  I only use grape seed oil.  I used about 3 tablespoons of red onion.  4-5 of the fresh baby sweet peppers. They are sweeter, with no bitterness.  My husband hates fruit on meats, but he loved this and so did I!

Made as written except I used fresh basil instead of dried just because I had it and baked the fish at 375 for about 12-15 minutes because it was storming too badly outside to grill anything! The results were fantastic!! I did double the mango salsa because my family loves it and it was totally gone!! I found some perfectly ripe mangoes at the store (unusual where I live) and they were just bursting with flavor in this salsa.  It went so well with the fish! A definite keeper and will be making this often!! Thanks for posting!

This is the BEST new recipe I have tried in a LONG time!  We had 5 pieces of fish, so I doubled the marinade recipe.  Used some fresh basil from the garden rather than dried.  The marinade is absolutely delicious on its own.  Only change I made to the salsa was scallions instead of the red onion.  The salsa was plenty for the amount of fish we had.  Everyone, including my 10 and 12 year old girls raved about this meal...even the salsa!  This one is a keeper!!!

So yummy! The fish was great, but the mango salsa was definitely the best. A great blend of sweet and crunchy - two of my favorite things in the world. I'll definitely be making at least the salsa again.

This was really good! My first time to grill Tilapia. I used foil on the grill to make things easier. I marinaded 2 hours ahead of time. The salsa is amazing! I used poblano peppers to reduce the heat but actually next time will use jalapeno I think. Salsa needed more heat. My mango was really sweet but it fell apart a little too much and became a little mushy. I think next time I'll try to get more firm mango for better consistency. I made the salsa a day ahead of time to save time and to let the flavors blend together. Combined with herbed rice and grilled asparagus (also used foil underneath the asparagus - just makes things easier.) Wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe last night, and  we all loved it, even the kids! I  made it following the recipe as written, except for a few changes.  I used 4  tilapia filets, instead of 2, canola oil instead of olive oil, because  I was out of olive oil, and I  cooked the fish in the oven, according to  the directions in other reviews. We ate it quickly, because it was so good, and everyone wanted more! Next  time, I will use more filets, and double the marinade. I served it with rice and fresh green beans. This is a light, flavorful, healthy, summer recipe.

Yummy! Every bite of fish had to have a bite of salsa. Made it exactly as written except only used 1/2 of a jalapeño. My 7 year old said  I should definitely write a review because "even though it had a jalapeño in it, it was really good."

Absolutely delicious!   I made just as described grilled on the BBQ.  I used green onions in the salsa because I had no red but it was fine. Served with grilled veggies, grilled peaches and basmati rice with scallions for garnish.  Really fantastic!

Great recipe, agree with earlier comments that the marinade can stand on its own but the addition of the mango salsa amplified the meal ten fold. 

Substituted with freshly caught Halibut  ;)

The only thing I did different was to put some sea salt on the skin side and then grilled skin side down first.  I made the salsa in the early morning so all of the herbs and spices would have more time to blend with each other. Living in the Philippines, I can get great ripe mango just about anytime too! Great recipe!

Grilled the tilapia in a fish basket 3 min per side. Excellent! We served it on hoagie rolls. Rolls were not necessary except for those with a hearty appetite, but would have been better if we had lightly grilled the rolls. Salsa was perfect .

This is always a hit when I make it. I usually make double the mango salsa and eat the leftovers with the white rice and black beans I make to accompany fish. This is a healthy and delicious meal! Totally worth the time.

Made this by the recipe. I think I will use half of the jalapeño because it had quite the kick. I paired it with strawberry spinach salad and it was great!

I was going to have pork for lunch, then saw this recipe and decided that I would use it for the pork.  However I did take some fish out for the evening.  It was absolutely delicious for both.  The mango salad was the same.  My mango  would have been better if it hadn't been so ripe, but I did like it so much.  It was the first time that i have used the bag system for marinating and I can't say that I think much of it.  Not a competent way of doing things and VERY hard to clean the bag after.

I was looking for ways to spruce up my love for Tilapia. I have cooked with just about every spice imaginable and not a big fan of fried fish. The mango works so well this the rest of the ingredients half way through cooking i was thinking oh this doesn't appear to seem to great this blend of ingredients, although i was blown away! I love this recipe and i would defiantly make it again.

We do not eat fish very much and I usually do not like fruit with my meat, but husband suggested we give it a try. I am completely blown away. This is one of the best meals we have made from the site. The whole family wanted more. Followed the recipe to a T and would not change a thing. Served it over a bed of lemon butter rice and a side of asparagus. We had extra mango salsa leftover to snack on the next day- delicious!

This was great! My 11 year old son only took a small piece because," I don't like fish." After taking a bite his face lit up and he quickly claimed the rest of his fillet before his older brother ate it.

I loved it - very refreshing summer dish.  Kids and husband were not fans, but did agree that it was a nice change from the way tilapia is typically made.  I added black beans to the salsa.

Awesome!
i don't have a grill, so I baked, which is my usual way of cooking tilapia. It was good! The salsa, however, is terrific. Next time I'll make it the night before instead of a few hours before. But this will be a mainstay in my home. Loved it!

Nice one. The marinade alone made the tilapia very flavourful, but the salsa brought in to the next level. I forgot to grease the grill. Don't make this mistake. Five stars.

This recipe is very easy to make. I agree, the mangoes were a little messy, but it was definitely worth it. Green beans and rice pilaf were my sides. The marinade was perfect as well, and I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! Very flavourful. Served it with roasted asperagus and cauliflower. Didn't have jalapenos or cilantro and it was still delicious. Baked it in the oven but looking forward to trying this on the bbq.

The fish was fabulous without the Mango Salsa which only made the dish even better. We had ric a roni with long grain rice and broccoli. I am going to try this marinade on other fish and maybe chicken. Used frozed filets from Costco. I think the grill was a bit hot when I put the fish on which made it stick a bit but didn't affect the flavoor

Awesome for fish tacos!  I have used with Mahi and grouper. Both are delicious!  I have been searching for a non breaded/non fried fish taco recipe and this recipe is exactly what I wanted!  I make everything the night before and dinner is on the table in no time. I have even frozen fish in this marinade and it still turns out great.

Obviously, this recipe is very dependent on the quality of the fish you get.  The first time we made this it was a little bit of a let down, but the second time was great.   Very simple when you look back on it.  We will certainly be making this again when the right fish is on sale.

I've made this twice now for lunch dates with friends, and it was a hit both times.  Easy and delicious (SERIOUSLY easy, I think the hardest part is cutting up the mango).  The only change I made the second time was to dial back the cilantro just a little in the salsa.  Prepped the salsa the day before, marinated the fish for an hour or two before cooking, and it made for a great, light, summery meal out on the deck.  The oil in the marinade will make the grill really flare up, so beware.  One friend got a good laugh at how I just sort of tossed the tilapia at the grill from almost a foot away.  The fish may kind of fall apart on the grill, but that's not a fault of the recipe.  We have a thingy, a metal plate with small holes in it, that we can place on the grill, and I may use that in the future so it's easier to flip and recover the fish.  Big hit and will make again.

Best tilapia recipe I've ever tried.  It made this rather bland fish taste meaty and it was really filling as well.  Will definitely make this again!!!

I marinaded the fish for a couple of hours and baked in the oven instead of on the grill.  I thought the fish came out great.  However, the salsa came out too "watery" (although the colors looked great).  My family liked it but I think the next time I make this, I will use just 1 or 2 mangos instead of 4.

Incredible! This is my new favorite fish recipe! So easy to put together and the taste is excellent. I pan fried instead of grilled but I definitely wouldn't change anything else in this recipe. Served with parmesan asparagus and polenta with lemon zest. Can't wait for the leftovers!

This was awesome.  The mango salsa is definitely restaurant quality.  This is a really healthy recipe.  The salsa made a large quantity so I recommend making 4 tilapia filets for this recipe.

We cooked the tilapia on the George Foreman in fear of it flaking through our grill, and served with the salsa which was awesome.  The whole dish was excellent!

I absolutely loved the turn out of this recipe. I make tilapia a lot and am always looking at different ways to flavor this fish. The only issue I came across was that my husband didn't really care for the heat. So if someone doesn't like heat just leave the jalapeno out and the salsa still turns out delicious.

Awesome Recipe!

I used my Foreman and the fish came out great. I have a family of 7 and I adjusted the recipe for 10 (you know, for lunch the next day). When I did it called for 5 mango's but I only used three and kept the other directions the same; this gave the salsa a good color and not to over power the other flavors. As a matter of fact, I had so much salsa left over, I used it for lunch on rice and black beans for 5 days! It was like reliving the same dinner over, and over again! :-)

Wow!  We absolutely loved this.  I adjusted the jalapeno, and exchanged the cilantro for parsley, but other than that, we followed the recipe verbatim. 
We also wrapped two filets in foil before grilling and 4 minutes on each side was all it took.  My husband ate every bite (and so did I!)

Over all pretty good recipe. I don't have a charcoal grill, so I had to use my Foreman. I used the marinade as it was written (Fish Had a Ho Hum Flavor, but the salsa suppose to be the star of the show anyway right?). I did however, make changes to the Salsa. I added 4 Medium size strawberries, 2TBS of Tabasco sauce, once chopped green onion and 1Tsp of brown sugar, and swapped the Jalapeno for Serrano pepper unseeded. Granted those are a lot of changes, but it was good to my taste buds. Thanks for the base recipe.

Started to rain so had to bake fish at 350 for 15 minutes.  Salsa needs to be made a few hours ahead for flavours to meld but still was good. Nice, light meal. Thx Witzken.

We love tilapia, and this recipe has become one of our favorites after tonight! The fish cooked after being in the marinade was DELICIOUS! Then you add the mango salsa, and it was fabulous! I broiled it instead of grilling it, and it was still fabulous! Love fresh salsa made w/fresh ingredients! Yum!

AHHHH, SOOOO GOOOOOOD.  I made chicken with the marinade instead of tilapia since my (crazy) husband doesn't eat fish.  I ate half the salsa with a spoon before the chicken was done.  This is definitely a keeper--easy, tasty, fresh.

I made this to go over swordfish for our Valentine's Day romantic dinner.  This salsa is very good and fresh tasting.  I also grated the lime peel to add to the salsa to increase the tropical flavor.  Otherwise, I made it as it is written.  This is a keeper!

Thanks so much for this recipe, WITZKEN!  I prepared this recipe EXACTLY as written and WOW, was this delicious!  Two hours after dinner my husband and I were still enjoying the "after glow" from this gem.  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I will prepare it again exactly as written.  I might even double the recipe and invite some lucky couple to join us.  Again, thanks!

My family and I really enjoyed this. The only complaint that I have is that the fish itself was a little bland. I will definitely make this again, but with a little more flavour to the marinade and fish. The salsa was great. This was a nice, healthy, fresh dish.

My family loved this!  I am a mother of three boys...only 1 of them a true fish lover but all of us raved about how good it was.  I am not very proficient at working with mango...really butchered it.  I added strawberries to the salsa in addition to the mango.  The salsa and the fish really compliment one another.

Very tasty recipe. I have also added in chopped strawberries with the mango and it has sweetened it up when the mango wasn't the most flavorful.

We love this one!  When we have company for dinner, this one is at the top of our list to serve.  Be sure to double the salsa if you make this for more than 2 people - it's the best part of the recipe!  We double the cilantro and it is amazing.

I added some jalapeno peppers to add a little spice which turned out well. I didn't drain the excess marinade prior to baking the tilapia (12 min at 450 degrees) and I wish I did because it turned out a bit too oily. Also, I think I would separate the salsa from the fish because the chilled salsa cooled the fish down too fast. Overall, good recipe and a keeper.

Easy to make and very tasty! (even though my mango was not ripe, but if it was it would have been even better )
Will definitely make this again. 
I had leftover salsa, so the next day I pan fried some chicken cutlets and served with salsa. Works well too.

This was a huge hit with my dinner guests!  I used the left over mango salsa for eggs in the morning which is also a big hit.
I stayed true to the ingredients!! Yummy!

This recipe is DIVINE! I wanted extra salsa for chips, so I doubled the the amount of salsa, but I added extra bell pepper (one red, one orange), extra red onion and a bit more cilantro for personal preferences. I made the salsa in the morning to let the flavors meld. (It really tastes even better after 5-8 hours in the fridge!) I don't have a grill so instead of grilling the tilapia, I baked it in the oven in a glass baking dish, covered the top with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes, and then turned up the oven to 375 degrees, uncovered the tilapia, and baked for an additional 10-15 minutes. (I marinated it in the fridge for about 2 hours in the same glass baking dish, and just cooked it in the marinade). I served this with cilantro rice and black beans. This is one of my favorite dishes I have ever made! It was colorful, beautiful, healthy and delicious. Thank you!

Made this tonight and it was a big hit. Wanted a change from my go to breaded talapia dish and this was just what I was looking for. I left out the red onions in the salsa and it turned out just fine.  Will definitely make this dish again.

We loved this recipe!  It was easy and delicious!  The only change I made was to use both strawberries and a large mango for my salsa, just because I had berries on hand.  Delish!!  My nine year old daughter raved about the fish!!  We'll definitely make this again!!

This was so good!!! The only thing i did different was only diced half of the mango and the other half i minced so the red peppers and red onions and other ingredients would really mix in... it was fantastic... even my cousin put the salsa on his chicken cause he doesn't eat fish... Fantastic... Great spin on Tilapia!!

Very nice dish, even better the following day.  Makes a whole lot of salsa, so be prepared for that. Looks beautiful plated as well (I served atop a bed of spinach).  Could have used a little more heat in terms of jalapenos (maybe one more?), but I'm not complaining.  Prep was a little of a pain in the butt, next time I may consider purchasing some of the ingredients pre-sliced/diced. Combination of marinade and salsa was spot on.  I also baked it as others users suggested. Healthy and delicious!  Boyfriend really enjoyed it as well :)  Will definitely make again!

An incredible fish marinade even without the mango salsa.  I have made just the marinade without the salsa and used it multiple times...it al depends on how much time you want to put in. I second the comments about being easy regardless of the longer ingredient list. This will be a favorite of yours quickly

I made this on our george forman grill. Maybe I did something wrong, but the first tilapia fell crumbled as I took it off. The salsa was good, but not on the fish. The flavors of the marinade didn't really come through that much. It tasted just like plain grilled fish with mango salsa on top.

IT'S A HIT!  My husband (the family food critic) said a HUNDRED times, "This is REALLY good -- REALLY GOOD!" He especially liked "The hot of the fish with the cold of the Salsa -- DELICIOUS".  Thanks Witzken!

Fabulous!  My husband loves this and asks for it every week or so.  We use halibut instead of tilapia.  The salsa really is so flavorful!

This is a fool proof recipe. The fish turned out perfect, very flavourful. I was a bit worried about the salsa since I've never tried the combination of fish and fruit before so I served the salsa on the side. It was great! I was surprised for the better, although I should mention that I did not use jalepeno and cilantro since I don't like it. Still, this recipe is a definate keeper.

Followed the recipe, but with fresh basil. It was PERFECT. We did 2 minutes each side for the tilapia fillets and they were so moist they just flaked apart perfectly.

Used this recipe just for the mango salsa.  Mmm!I used dried cilantro and skipped the red onion.  I also added tomatoes and extra green bell peppers.  Very colorful!  Yummy as a chip dip or a topping to the fish tacos I made!  Mango was a pain to work with, but I would definitely do it again!

This is one of our favorite recipes! The salsa is wonderful (I do add an avocado)! I'm not a fish eater, but this recipe has turned me on to tilapia. Of course this is the only way I will make it, I haven't found another recipe as good.  I have shared this with many friends and everyone asks for the recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I actually just made the mango salsa because I was looking to top my blackened salmon with something fresh.
This is a GREAT mango salsa recipe. I made it extra spicy with an abundance of fresh jalapenos, but everything about the flavor was perfect. 
This was also my first time cutting a mango (dicing to be exact) and I got A LOT of help by watching a YOUTUBE video on how to do it! Technology is awesome because my mango was perfectly diced... Ok, ok..I butchered the first one =/

very simple and delicious. I only used a 1/2 jalapeno pepper (boyfriend doesn't care for spicy very much) - The tilapia marinade is very tasty! Kudos and thanks for sharing.

Fabulous Mango Salsa! I've made this both with the marinade and also by just pan frying the fish in a bit of olive oil & lemon. The fish marinade is tasty, but seems almost superfluous when served with the salsa.

This recipe is delicious! We didn't have the chance to actually make the Mango Salsa, so we used Peach Salsa from the store. It was great!!! I know next time I will make the mango salsa. I also have thought about using lime juice instead of lemon juice for a different flavor. Amazing!

I have four children so it is not often that I please all of them...tonight was the exception! Perfect marinade & the salsa was delicious...didn't change a thing. Will be adding this one to our weekly menu!

This was an amazing way to use some mango before it was too late.  And what a fantastic, easy recipe this turned out to be.  It was a huge hit with all.  We didn't spend enough time chopping the vegetables, but will take better care next time.

This will be one our new dinner staples.

This salsa pairs perfectly with this fish.  I like to make the salsa ahead, but it's not necessary.  I sometimes add a little fresh grated ginger and a little honey to balance it out.  I like cherry bomb peppers instead of bells, but watch the heat!

My boyfriend said that this recipe was excellent, even at work I shared the recipe with some workers and they did.  The result was awesome.

This is great!  Made it exactly as it says and everyone loved it!  When strawberries are in season I'll have to try them too.

My 5 kids (+1) and husband loved it!  14 year old's visiting friend begged to be invited back next time I serve it.  Too bad about the bad press for Tilapia.  Oh, I didn't have jalapenos so I substituted some canned green enchilada sauce and it was perfect.

I made this recipe with chicken instead of fish and it was yummy. My fiance told me the marinade on the chicken taste a bit like pesto. I cut down the EVOO drastically. I used about a tbs. The mango takes a bit of preparing, but it's worth it. I didn't have fresh coriander, so I used frozen cubes of minced coriander from my freezer. I'd make this again.

THE BEST fish dish I have made!  Even my husband, who doesn't really like fish, liked it.  I doubled the recipe, everything except the olive oil in the marinade.  I didn't even use the 1/3 cup. Can't wait to make this again!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I wrapped the marinated fillets in banana leaves to grill and served them with strawberry salsa instead of mango.  It's my husband's new favorite!

Wow, delicious and such an interesting combination of flavors.  I used mahi mahi fillets and baked in the oven instead of grilling.  Other than that followed the recipe exacly.  This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site.... and I have tried many.

Oh Num! The mango was nowhere close to being ripe, so I unhappily substituted frozen. That sacrifices texture, but I figured it was the lesser of two evils. Added a second jalapeno since these were very mild, otherwise kept to the recipe. Made the salsa early in the day to give it time to think about itself. Cooked the fish on a cast-iron grill pan. Served with a black rice pilaf and green bean/wax bean medley. That marinade and salsa are both excellent and I'll be using them individually in other things, but together work very well.  Did I say "Num" yet? Oh Num!

Fantastic!! We loved this-so much flavour!!  We put on some salsa music and had a romantic, candlelit dinner, very nice :) Very high-quality recipe like you would have at a nice restaurant. **In the future, I would cut the salsa ingredients in half for two people.

So great! It was waaaay too cold to grill here, so I baked it in it's marinade. Was a bit worried about so much pepper, but it was great! The salsa was good, but the next day it was great--so I will make it a day ahead next time if I get a chance.

Absolutely fab recipe.  It was a lot of parts to put together, but the flavor mixture was just amazing.  We like it hot, so the heat was just right for us.  I love the Mango Salsa - I use it with other meals because I like the flavor so much.  Thanks for sharing!

The only changes I suggest to the marinated are; adding 1 tsp curry powder and using garlic pepper instead of black pepper. Next time I will also add one more jalapeno, using all but the majority of its seeds. (I like things with a little more warmth)
I took GodivaGirl's suggestion and made bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno peppers to serve on the side excellent combination! I know I will be serving this dish often, and will use the Mango recipe for chips and salsa as well.

This was absolutely delish.  It did require a lot of chopping but the results were worth it.  For the salsa, my hubby can't eat peppers, so I left out the bell and jalapeno and substituted some corn and avocado.  I also used canned mango when I couldn't find fresh.  Was still a rave and can't wait to make it again!
