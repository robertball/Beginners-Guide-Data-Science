This should get 10 stars. Five for the salad and five for the sauce! The salad is so nice, the flavors are perfect together, as well as the textures. The meat comes out tender and goes nicely with the zoodles. The sauce, just two things most people have in their fridge, why did I never think of it? Awesome. Thank you for the recipe.

This is super easy to make, but I haven't quite gotten my veggie noodles right in the skillet yet.

Very labor intensive..no spiralizer, had to cut all the veggies....tasted great, but too much work.
