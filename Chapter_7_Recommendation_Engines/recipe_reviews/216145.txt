This was exceptional!
We put all the ingredients into a crockpot (minus the milk as we used dairy not almond) and cooked on low overnight.  The next morning we stirred in some warmed milk and enjoyed!

I omitted the butter, maple syrup and almonds.  Instead I fried the apples in a vegetable oil sprayed pan, added raisins for sweetness, and used pecans as the nuts.  I also used soy milk instead of almond milk. This is a nice, grainy kind of cereal that brings out the taste of the cinnamon flavored apples.  I'll be making this again!

Excellent!  Can also substitute coconut milk.  I have also reduced maple syrup and added some raisins.

Good recipe; butter, apples & cinnamon can hardly be beat.  I love quinoa, but imagine you could substitute a variety of different grains and have a wonderful breakfast.  Thank you Alyse for posting this yummy, healthy breakfast.

Tasty. I didn't have almond milk so I used regular, 1%, dairy milk.  Also added some brown sugar to my bowl because I like it that way. Its texture reminds me of Sunny Boy cereal.

I adore quinoa - love its taste/texture, versatility and it's super healthy!  I am always excited to find new ways to prepare it and loved the sound of this one.  I used pure maple syrup and light vanilla soy as it happened to be open in my fridge while my almond milk was not yet!  I opted to leave out the half and half as well.  This was an enjoyable breakfast, substantial and very yummy!

Tasty, but frying the apples in butter kind of defeats the health benefits of quinoa.  I just add the apples and cinnamon to the quinoa and cook it all together. I sweeten with stevia, but you can certainly use the maple syrup for flavor and sweetness.  I also add one-quarter cup walnuts for some healty fat, but that's a personal preference.

My children took one look at this and started to cry until I forced them to smell it.  Then they cleaned their bowls!   I liked how another reviewer said to add raisins.  I'll try that next time.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

Pretty tasty - my first attempt to cook with quinoa! Next time I will use two apples instead of one and try doubling the cinnamon and maybe upping the almonds as well.

This is yummy.  I added peanut butter b/c I didn't have almonds.  Served it over greek yogurt to cool it off fast for kids.

This was my first quinoa attempt and it was lovely!  Nice texture, just enough sweetness.  New breakfast for variety.  Next time I will try an asian version adding pears and ginger ;)

Just polished off this dish for breakfast about five minutes ago. Very good! This was my first shot at quinoa, and thanks for making that new experience a pleasant one! It's similar to how I cook oatmeal sometimes (though I do that sans milk and cream; just water). I don't usually keep random things like Almond milk around, so I just used skim, and also fat free half and half. I also used a light butter spread and cut the amount in half, as I only really wanted a little butter flavor for the apples. To saute the apples with the reduced amount of butter, I just used cooking spray to keep it from sticking to the pan, and added just that little bit of butter spread for flavour. I also swapped the almonds for chopped pecans. (Apples and cinnamon just seem to pair up so nicely with pecans!) I will certainly be making this again.

Super yummy! My 3 year old LOVED it. I did omit the nuts from her's as she is not a huge fan. Definitely will make this again!

I love quinoa but using red quinoa gave it too overpowering of a taste. I would use regular quinoa if I were to try this again.  I love all the other ingredients in this recipe but I don't know what happened. I did make it in the slowcooker.

It was a pretty good recipe but I was expecting it to be sweet for some reason and was definitely let down on that point. After I added a bunch of sugar to it, I loved it :) I would make it again, but I would add sugar from the get go since I like sweet breakfast

What a great treat from the typical Sunday pancakes!  Rather than buy almond milk just for this recipe, I poured a little vanilla into 1% milk.  Used two apples and increased the cinnamon.  That made it plenty sweet enough.  It was a little soupy (possibly not enough Quinoa as I was low).  Next time I will cut back on the milk.

Love this! Quick, easy, and yum! I used 2 Fuji apples, a reduced sugar syrup, almond-coconut milk, and some splenda plus I omitted the half and half since I didn't have any. Very good. My 4 year old enjoyed it too!

Outrageous! I really didn't measure anything. Did everything by eye and added raisins. Used evaporated milk instead of half and half. Now I can enjoy dessert and not feel guilty about it!

I was excited to try this... found it easy to prepare and mouth-watering.  We used Pink Lady apples and whole, raw almonds (what we had on hand).

This is an awesome recipe. I doubled the recipe & used Lactaid full fat milk. I used brown sugar instead of maple syrup, & left the skins on from the apples. This ones a keeper!?

This is pretty good. I doubled the apple, used honey instead of maple syrup, and unsweetened coconut milk instead of almond milk. It could have used a little bit more sweetener, but not much.

Really good. I cooked the apple with the quinoa, added a touch of brown sugar, and only a bit of fat free half and half prior to serving. It has a great texture and flavor!

I give it four stars as is, because I found it to be quite bland, and also overly salty.  The amount of salt called for was way too much for this recipe, so I would decrease it by half next time.  I also added twice as much syrup, and about 3T brown sugar at the end to give it more flavor and to mask the salt. It ended up tasting great, but next time I make it I hope to be able to use less sugar and keep it healthier by decreasing the salt. Oh, and I also didn't have red quinoa so I used the traditional brown and it turned out just fine.  My picky husband even liked this!
