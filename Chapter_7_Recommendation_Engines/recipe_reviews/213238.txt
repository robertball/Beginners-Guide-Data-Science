Had a friend of ours over for dinner who is new to America (he was born and raised in India) and he said I was spot on with this, but to him it was fairly mild. For us it was pretty spicy though.  I should note that I did not add the mustard. I marinated the fish in a turmeric/garlic paste with a little salt and pepper. (Food processor, few drops of water and oil and then blend) this was a tip my friend had given me when I told him what I planned to make for dinner. I also tossed in a can of green chilies and cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 a teaspoon.    We absolutely LOVED this dish!! We served it over brown rice and finished it off completely. I can not WAIT to make this again!!! Thanks so much for sharing this!!

The house smelled wonderful! I used mahi mahi fillets. Scared it would be too hot, I used 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp. madras curry powder. Served with rice and steamed spinach.

Crazy good!  We followed the recipe exactly and it was a perfect heat for us.  Note: we generally order our food at medium spice level at restaurants.

Huge hit at my house! I did make a few changes...used mahi mahi and shrimp,1 teaspoon of cayenne(my daughter won't eat to hot) and used 2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter (no cashews in the house). I did put all the curry sauce ingredients into the blend to purée and cooked the curry sauce for a good solid hour to have all the flavor blend. To cook the fish I put it into a sauté pan than added the curry sauce cooked a good 10 mins...served over spinach and rice with mango chutney. My daughter wanted to know when I would make it again....that means it's a hit!

Awesome, even though I over-cooked the fish - I always do that :(  I used Cod and subbed olive & vegetable oils for the canola. I only added about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, there was no way my son would be able to eat it as listed. I will definitely make this again, with a little more cashews in the paste and try not to overcook it!

This was a good dish.  My family loved it.  Easy and fast to make with tons of flavor.  I served it with Saffron rice, rosemary garlic potatoes and Naan.

We loved this dish! I did cut back on the cayenne to about 1 1/12 tsp and it was still hot but delicious. Also added about 3/4 cup canned diced tomatoes b/c I did not have fresh. Served this with roasted cauliflower. If you like a very flavorful curry, this is the one for you!

YUMMY.  The dijon mustard combined with the indian spices really gave the fish a tangy complex flavor.  I served it on a plain (no salt no flavoring) spinach saag and brown Basmati rice to absorb the rich flavor of the fish.  This was my first attempt at making Indian food.  Thanks for making it so easy.

We really enjoyed this for dinner last night. It was very flavorful, right amount of spice (I used 1 tsp. cayenne), and the fish was very moist. I used fresh-caught black tile fish, served with brown rice and steamed carrots. All of the different flavors came together very well. Instead of canned vegetable stock, I made my own using leftover shrimp shells, a few celery tops, and the stems of the fresh cilantro. I also added some curry powder to the spice mix.

This was execellent.  Followed recipe and bake time.  Restaurant quality - I will be making again but with cheaper fish - I bought Halibut and this would be equally good on red snapper.  I also used the full amount of Cayenne pepper as I love hot food.

Wow, this has a ton of flavor. I used only half the cayenne, and it was still spicy, especially with the first few bites, but it mellowed as I ate more. I'd add a bit more tomato; the acid helped balance the richness of the sauce.

i never made indian food before, i always thought it was difficult. this was delicious and easy to do. i dont have a food processor so i just grated the ginger, chopped the onion/garlic very finely and used cashew butter instead of whole cashews. beware, this recipe is very, very spicy. i usually order an 8 or 9 at an indian restaurant, and this fish was right up there. great recipe!

Was looking for something different for dinner. We never eat Indian food so this certainly qualified. My family all liked it- and I have picky teenagers. Not the most attractive dish. But... its delicious and I will be making it again!

We made this tonight as written except...halved the cayenne as many recommended but for our "3 thai chili to start" taste buds, 1 tsp cayenne wasn't enough so next time will try 1 1/2 tsp. and may end up with 2 tsp. as called for but otherwise, very yummy as is.  Probably will add upwards of 1/4 c cashews and increase veggie broth to maintain texture with additional nuts as this sauce sauce is so yummy, really could double with 4 filets as you and your guests will all want more.  Thx so much for sharing a great way to eat more fish!  Oh and I used wild turbot filet as the mahi mahi I wanted was sold out at Whole Foods so really any mild white fish will substitute nicely.

This was really really good!! It really is a spicy dish. I love spicy so I had no problem. My husband thought it was a bit too spicy so I will have to cut down next time for him. I have used Mahi Mahi and tilapia and both work. Usually I serve with Naan bread, jasmine or basmati rice, either white or coconut and some type of veggie,  usually peas. I am so happy with this recipe!

This recipe was delicious! I ended up using honey brown mustard and doubling the amount of the marinade (didn't seem like enough for four fillets). I used swai fillets and didn't have cashews but this recipe is full of flavor even without it. Also, I didn't have any tomatos so I used one can diced tomatoes, drained. Finally, I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used chicken broth.  The spice level is probably high for many people, but I found it to be a little above what I normally tolerate. Will definately make this again.

This is really good- adjusted it for one serving. I ended up just adding the fish to the skillet after cooking everything according to the directions for ingredients through the tomatoes and broth, but cutting up the fish into chunks and halving the amount of cayenne (I used red pepper powder). The fish cooked in around 10-15 minutes with this method. Will make this again!

I used only 1/2 tsp cayenne, and added 1 tin coconut cream at the end to simmer the fish in.  Was still very hot but manageable.

WOW, every bit is full of explosion!!  Afraid of too much heat, I omitted the cayenne pepper and substituted 1/4 tsp of curry & 1/4 tsp of red pepper, chopped and mashed the tomatoes and used 2 Cod filets. Served on white rice and roasted okra as a side with some homemade garlic parmesean Italian bread!!  What a fantastic meal!!!  Will make again and again!  Impressive!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was AMAZING. We followed the directions for the most part, but I added a little bit of extra curry powder to the spice mix, and instead of cayenne I used a few dashes of ground habenero, which is much hotter but I need less. We used cod, which tasted great in the curry. It tasted like authentic Indian cooking. My husband said it was "the best fish dish ever".

Excellent recipe!  Cut the cayenne to 1 tsp (hubby doesn't like too spicy) and added 1/2 tsp of curry and 1/2 tsp of garam masala.  Perfect amount of heat.  Served with quinoa and roasted asparagus.  Great, healthy dinner!

Thanks!  I used cod for the fish.  I did not marinate the fish, but did add the mustard and black pepper to the curry.  I also used chili powder in place of cumin because I was out of cumin.

I've made this recipe several times and it has always turned out wonderfully. All my family loves it, even though they aren't big fans of Indian food. It is super spicy if you follow the recipe, so I use two tsp red curry powder instead, and it comes out great. I also usually use more cashews than the recipe calls for, five seems a bit pointless. I even make double batches now.  Usually I put it over saffron rice or couscous. It is a big hit!

SO amazingly flavorful! I paired it with cauliflower cilantro & lemon "rice" and it was just a beautiful dish. I do paleo so I substituted agave for sugar and it was just amazing. I also don't use canola oil so I just used coconut oil and olive oil. I tossed in veggies (carrots, radishes & broccoli) while the fish cooked and everything melted together! I also just used one tsp of cayenne and it was perfect. Easy to adapt & eat. Love how low cal,carb & sugar it is but high in protein! (I'm working on the salt part).. Thanks for a wonderful recipe

This has become my favorite tilapia recipe by far! My husband and I used to always go to Pakistani/Indian restaurants but now when we are craving that kind of food I make this.  I have even made it for some Pakistani friends who said it was amazing.  The flavor and amount of spices are perfect!  It also looks very pretty too :) I've also made it without cashews one time because I didn't have any and couldn't taste a difference. I serve it with basmati rice. A friend of mine told me that if you want a stronger flavor/spices to simmer it down a few times (i.e. after the vegetable broth, pour a little water, let it boil/simmer for a little while until it evaporates and repeat several times). I also make it without marinating it first.

excellent, my favorite seafood dish in a long time. It was spicy but just spicy enough for me. We enjoyed it over jasmin rice.

I like spicy food but this is not my cup of tea. It really wasn't that spicy or that tasty to me.

We love this recipe.  I think I'll try to reduce the amount of salt next time though.  There is so much flavour that it doesn't need as much salt.

This was a great recipe; I really enjoyed the flavors and it's a great way to eat fish (not my favorite meat).  So good!

This dish was absolutely wonderful!  I used catfish nuggets because that was the only white fish I had on hand.   I also used ground ginger instead of the ginger root and only a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper because I don't like it so spicy.   It came out amazing.  I had to go back for seconds!  I served with brown rice and spinach.  Thanks for the recipe!

This had great flavor, but boy was it HOT.  My husband and I are huge fans of spicy food, but this was almost too much for us.  Next time I make this I will cut the cayenne a little.  Otherwise a fantastic recipe!  Thanks for sharing

This was very good! I made it almost exactly as written. I omitted the cayenne but used Rotel tomatoes for spiciness. I did not add the broth, which would have made it too liquidy. I kept the fish in the 13x9 in which I marinated it and just topped it with the cooked paste.

Me: Wow, this is great. Just the right amount of heat!

Other three guests: OUR FACES ARE MELTING OFF! WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO US???

I followed the instructions exactly, but cut the cayenne pepper in half. Still, face-melting ensued.

Note: I live in the mid-Atlantic region.  Yogurt is too spicy for some.

Good, but no cayenne for us (kids and hubby wouldn't be able to hang with that). Decent flavor but fairly tame (no tanginess or zing). The smokiness of the turmeric, coriander, and cumin is well balanced with the salt, onions, garlic and cilantro. I didn't really notice the mustard at all. I added my own spice to my plate and I really liked it. The kids didn't really love it but hubby agreed that he would eat it again if served again.

Delish! The flavours are incredible! Used mahi mahi and cut down on the cayenne-our cayenne is super hot. This recipe would also be great with pistachios rather than cashews. If you like curry this is for you. Thanks  Mantu. Can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe. And...I just accidentally made it with squid instead of fish (ooooh, vacuum packed frozen sea creatures...you've done it again!) Anyways, it was actually just as delish as ever! I put 2.5 tsp of cayenne pepper, (because we love it hot!)...and I might have just overdone it a tush. Next time, I'm sticking with the recipe, exactly, because it doesn't need any modifications.

Reduced cayenne to 1/4 tsp and it was still very spicy.  I think adding coconut milk would tame it and add some richness.

Loved this dish!!  Don't be afraid of the spice. I only added 1 tbs. and I could have added more. It had the perfect balance of flavors and my family raved over it. It's definitely going on the regular rotation list. Fantastic!!!

Delicious! We like it hot so I added a Serrano pepper to the paste. Used Cod fish and reduced the baking time to about 20 min. Served with cashew vegetable korma and Basmati rice.

Very tasty! And easy. Used tilapia. Didn't have coriander so I used a half teaspoon of garam masala. Almonds instead of cashews. Teaspoon of crushed red pepper instead of cayenne. Excellent reheated with some lime squeezed on top.

This was delicious. Bought a nice cod fillet and used honey dijon and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth as I had those on hand. Baked it for ~35 minutes. The smell was amazing! It was quite spicy for me but not too much. Maybe I'll cut back a little on the cayenne next time. It did get a little watery but I used canned diced tomatoes so maybe try for fresh. Served it over white rice with a few pieces of naan (maybe a little redundant!). I'll be making this again!

Followed other's advice and decreased the amount of fish to about 15oz, but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  I did cut down the cayenne, which was fortunate b/c my husband said it was still too spicy for him.  I also left the fish to marinate overnight.  There was a lot of flavor in this dish, and I will make this again.  I'll remember to add veggies to this next time though.  O, I almost forgot:  I'm sure a lot of ppl know this, but I didn't see anyone correct the reviewer who said that there should've been curry in a recipe called "fish curry."  Curry is a blend of spices, such as those listed in the ingredients.

Followed the recipe but cut the salt in half and prepared the night before so after covering the cod fillets with the paste I covered the casserole with foil and put it in the fridge. Half an hour in the oven and served along with mashed sweet potatoes, jasmine rice, a little shredded coconut, some raisins and some homemade rhubarb chutney. My daughter had trouble with the heat but didn't leave anything on her plate!

This was so good!  It is a good way to make fish that is unique and delicious.  The balance of spices and the richness of the oil are the perfect complement to the blandness of fish.  I used flounder and served it over basmati rice.

I love this recipe, especially that it uses whole spices rather than "a teaspoon of curry powder" making it much more authentic and richly flavored.

A favourite in our house!  The teens request it often.   I use only 3/4 tsp cayenne (personal preference) increase tomato to 1 cup and add 1/2 can coconut milk for creaminess and just because the sauce is so delicious we like to have extra to spoon over rice.  We use about 6 Basa fillets - super tender!  Another great thing about this dish (compared to many fish dishes) - it keeps in the oven covered at 200 degrees without drying as we discovered one night when dinner was ready but family was an hour late getting home.  This is a restaurant-quality recipe, great with naan and a simple crunchy salad with an oil & vinegar dressing.   Thanks for the recipe :)

Made it  with  1/2 tsp cayenne and lots of cilantro. Yum.
Next time will use only 1/4 tsp of cayenne, omit the sugar and soak the cashews.

This dish was terrific! So tasty! We're big curry fans and this was was very authentic. I made it for 2 people and made it a low fat dish by omitting all oil. I used a 1 lb swordfish steak cut into 1 inch chunks. To marinate, I placed the chunks in a small baking dish and covered with 5 forkfuls of minced garlic from a jar and about 5 Tblsp of Dijon mustard. For the curry I used minced ginger from a jar for convenience. 1 tsp of cayenne was plenty spicy for us. In my opinion I could have left the cashew halves out and not known the difference. I cooked the sauce without oil, it wasn't necessary, and used Splenda instead of sugar. Two diced Roma tomatoes worked for me, and I put the sauce right on top of the marinade before baking. I left off the cilantro garnish because I don't care for it. Served it with steamed cauliflower and a sliced banana, and for anyone on Weight Watchers the entire dinner came out to 7 SmartPoints per serving. Husband liked this a lot and so did I; I will definitely make this again!

This fish curry was so super delicious! I used a fish curry powder mix instead of turmeric, coriander and cumin powder and added more garlic to the paste. I give this 5 stars and would give more if that was possible and it will be saved in my favorites. Thanks for sharing this incredible recipe! :)

My husband made this last night only he doubled all the ingredients for the sauce because we like things saucy and over rice.  However, next time we will double everything except the cayenne pepper, we'll do 3 tsp. instead of 4.  The flavor was excellent and just like a quality Indian restaurant but double the cayenne is a little too lip burning. We used mahi mahi because it is a mild meaty white fish.  Next time I would like to try a pink salmon with this.  We served this with basmati rice flavored with cardamom pods.  Excellent dish and SUPER healthy, will be making this a LOT!  UPDATE:  Made this again only with pink salmon chunks this time and it was EVEN BETTER!!!  I just LOVE this recipe!

I love this. I had it with rice, fried banana, toasted pecan, and raw spinach on the side. The banana add a nice sweetness to an extremely spicy dish. The toasted pecan add crunchiness. I replaced coriander with cilantro bc I didn't have any coriander.

We like spicy and this was almost too much!  I would decrease cayenne by a bit next time.  I also substituted peanuts for the cashews due to tree nut allergies and they worked fine.  Smelled great!

Very authentic curry. We like it hot so I used the spices as is. Hubby and I ate it all, LOL, but I used fairly thin cod. Will definitely make this one again.

This was AN excellent recipe that my family raved about. I stuck to the recipe since I had never made anything like this before and the results were awesome. Can't wait to try it again and now looking forward to testing other Indian dishes.

Delicious! Very spicy but just right for my taste. However, I did take the advice of one reviewer and add 1 tsp of cayenne and 1 tsp of curry powder. ALSO, it is very important to let the tomato cook down after adding it and the broth. The writer does not note this but if you don't cook it long enough to reduce (which also requires increasing the heat for several minutes), it won't congeal and the spices will not permeate the sauce. This was fantastic over sautéed spinach and basmati rice. Overall, an excellent dish!

We loved this dish however next time I would cut back on the cayenne. I on,y put in 1 q1/2 tsp . My husband is I Nina and he even said it was too much. It was so spicy I think it took away from the flavor of the curry. This is a keeper but next time will only out in 3/4-1 tsp. cayenne. But was a great curry dish!

My husband and I thought this was wonderful. I used 1 tsp. of cayenne, which was plenty of heat for us. The only change I made was in the oven temperature. I cooked the fish at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.Thanks so much for the recipe!

This came out great, though 2 tsp of cayenne seemed to overpower the flavor for my wife and I. It wasn't "too spicy" for us to handle, rather the spiciness of the cayenne seemed to eclipse the flavor of the other seasonings. I'll use 1 tsp next time.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this dish. It is quite spicy, but the spice doesn't linger for very long. 

I didn't have Dijon Mustard so I used the closest thing to mustard in my fridge-> Trader Joe's Aioli Mustard Garlic Sauce. I also didn't have cayenne, so I used 2 teaspoons of red chilli flakes. 

I made some quinoa on the side and it went really well with this. In fact, I also mixed the quinoa with the fish curry and stuffed it into some crisp taco shells (also from Trader Joes) - was delicious! 

Note: When I fried the onion-garlic-ginger mixture it turned green! Did this happen to anyone else?  I read online that this is normal/safe (i'll let you know if I experience otherwise, I just had the curry 10 min ago), and is due to chemicals in the garlic. As a science teacher I'm always looking out for cool food-chemistry demos, and this recipe helped me uncover this one. It also ended up making my curry look green instead of yellow, which gave it a nice look I thought.

Wow! Amazing flavor and much less work that it initially looks like. I cut the cayenne down to 1 tsp and it was still fiery enough to cause the sniffles. I can't believe how rich and complex the flavor was. I'm saving this one, for sure!

this was so delicious but i did heed the warning given by the other reviewers about the heat.. so i halved the cayenne.. i used a pound of red snapper for the white fish fillets.. instead of making a paste out of everything.. i just sauteed the seasonings with the oil and added sliced onion and the roughly chopped garlic.. once it became fragrant i added the broth and double amount of tomatoes.. unfortunately i only had powdered ginger and no cashews.. halved the sugar.. and put the baked result on a flour tortilla with Cucumber-Cilantro Raita (from this site) on top.. blame the californian in us.. we so loved it.. ty so much for the recipe

This was so tasty. My seven year old picky eater ate all his food without any complaints! I made extra sauce and then thickened the left over veg. broth with some corn starch. I then added it to the sauce with some shredded coconut. Next time I will use coconut milk (did not have any this time). I served the fish with the curried sauce over rice. (I also do this with the tandoori fish recipe from this site). This made a very delicious dinner. Thank you so much for sharing Mantu.

This was just about the most amazing recipe we've tried!! Because my hubby is an Indian food wimp, we used half the cayenne and added 1/4 c coconut milk. We also added 1/4 c cashews, total (love our nuts ;-) and no salt. MAN, was this good. It was still *plenty* spicy and delish! Served with steamed broccoli and fresh rice. YUM!! no need for take away!

This was so tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, using cod I bought frozen, then thawed out.  I used 1/2 tsp red pepper and it was still too spicy for my kids, so I baked some of the marinated fish without the sauce in a foil packet and they liked that.  My husband and I loved it made according to the recipe.  Next time I may cut the red pepper back more so the kids can eat it with the curry sauce, though I would miss the spice!

I only rated it 4 star because I veered off the recipe (I'm sure it's a five though if you follow exactly).  I used Citrus & Habanero EVOO (from a specialty grocery) and cut out the cayenne completely because of that.  I also didn't add the sugar to the "onion jam" - it was definitely sweet enough (but I use sweet onions all the time anyway).  I doubled the amount of raw cashews as I like it a bit creamier.  Topped my basa fillets with the mix, added to our plates a chili-spiced saag zipped up with some fresh lemon juice, a quinoa and brown basmati mix, and a cooling cucumber raita with mint.  I also set out more raw cashew pieces for optional garnish and had fresh banana available to cut the heat for dessert.  My husband is not a big fan of fish so I'm always looking for different ways to make it more interesting and yet gluten free for me.  We both loved this recipe and will make it again as shown or with my own substitutions. Yummy!

Delicious! Will definitely make again. I forgot the cilantro & it didn't matter. I didn't use the full amount of cayenne & it was still very spicy. I loved it! I don't know as the type of fish matters much. I may even try it with chicken thighs or tenders.

I liked this recipe a lot.  However, my mouth was on fire from the two teaspoons of cayenne.  I know it says "2 teaspoons of cayenne or to taste," but it is probably better to write "one-half teaspoon of cayenne or to taste."   It can always be added.  Even so, it was delicious even with the two teaspoons.

Delicious!  I sometimes find it hard to make fish really flavorful but not so with this dish. So delicious. Received rave reviews from all who ate it. The only changes I made were substituting curry powder for the turmeric since I didn't have any on hand, eliminating the cayenne because I have small children, and I used canned diced tomatoes because it was easier. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was really nice, I will definitely make it again. I also put pineapple on top of the fish before baking which was a nice addition.

Loved it! And my husband loved it too! I had fresh chesnuts, so I used them instead. I used chipolte instead of cayenne. So yummy, and I am making curry potato soup with the leftover sauce.

Thank you for an easy and delicious Indian Fish recipe!!

I didn't use ginger root or cashews since I didn't have any.  I also substituted olive oil for canola oil.  This came out nice and spicy!  It takes an incredible amount of spice for me to taste or feel the heat.  Anyways I tasted the heat in this dish.  It wasn't too spicy for me but I can imagine it might cause some panic attacks for those more sensitive to heat.  I definitely will be cooking this again!

This was outstanding and pretty easy. We used halibut which is so mild that it really needs some strong flavors to go with it.  We will definitely make this again but with less cayenne (probably 1/2" tsp). I did double the cashews and cooked the onion longer so that they would be softer and a golden color.

The recipe was very easy to fellow and to make . I did not change any ingredients in the Indian Fish Curry.  Everything came out perfectly and delicious . Cooking time was about the same as Mantu stated.  My family enjoyed the Indian fish curry very much.   I will definitely cook this  again.  Thanks Mantu!   Edna Gibbs

This dish is AMAZING!  My boo applauded me and we devoured this!  So much flavor.  I went a little over the 2tsps of Cayenne and didn’t have coriander, so I added dried cilantro.

Didn't really have fillets, but had a couple of nice slabs of halibut that I cut into bite-sized pieces. Upped the tomatoes and broth (chicken as it were) & served over Tex-mati rice. Nice heat that almost dominated the other flavors, but all in all an excellent dish. Got nice compliments from the crowd (wife) & had enough for a second meal later in the week. Definite do-again experimenting with spices & herbs.

Way too spicy!!  I’m a southern Cajun girl, & I love spicy things. When I eat my boiled crawfish, I want my nose to be running or it’s not spicy enough. But this? This takes it to a whole new level. It wasn’t even pleasant. Way too much “fire”. My husband & I scraped all the paste off of our fish.

This was excellent.  I only made very minor adaptations.  Instead of the 2 tsp cayenne pepper, I used 1 tsp Madiera Curry powder and 1/2 tsp. ancho chili pepper.  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen peas to the sauce right before putting it in the oven.  It was fantastic.

The smells from the kitchen were incredible and the dish was quite flavorful.  I discovered I didn't have any cayenne pepper so substituted red chili pepper flakes that I didn't measure before adding.  I will definitely make this again.

It was tasty, but a lot of chopping etc. I did reduce the cayenne pepper. I would have liked a firmer white fish as my flou der was lost.

This recipe is great!! I'm American and my husband is Indian so I'm trying to learn to cook traditional foods for him. He loved this recipe so much that it's become a regular at our house. He said fish curry is hard to get right and was super impressed that I got it so spot on, so thank you for sharing!! The fish is pretty spicy but that's how it's supposed to be, and I usually double the sauce because its so delicious!

I really liked this. I left out the cashews because I don’t care for them but other than that I followed the recipe. It was pretty easy to make and had a really nice flavor. Paired with asparagus and broccoli and it was a flavorful and healthy way to get some fish in. I’ll make it again.

I used just one tsp. of cayenne which was hot enough for us,  but the rest of the recipe was unchanged.  I served this over rice and wilted spinach as suggested by another reviewer.  This was a big hit with my husband and it's a healthy meal, so I will definitely be making it again.

Love this recipe! I didn’t make any changes except using ginger paste instead of fresh ginger. I used orange roughy fillets and shrimp, cutting the fillets in smaller pieces before marinating. Served over basmati rice - definitely a keeper!

Outstanding!  This is absolutely delicious!

Hubby loved it;  said it was the most authentic Indian dish I've ever made.   I don't like fish but keep trying to make myself eat it. This recipe did the trick.

This will definitely be my go to sauce/recipe from now on!

I made this for dinner tonight. I didn't use as much cayenne as the recipe called for but it was spiced very well and we had no problem eating it all. We will definitely have this again. I'm sure guests will love it as well.

I have made this twice. The first time I made it with cod and followed the recipe to the letter. There was way too much cayenne pepper for my taste, but my husband liked it. I also wasn't crazy about the cod. The second time I made it with tilapia and cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp. It still had enough kick for him, but it wasn't too much for me. I put it over rice that I made with some of the leftover vegatable broth from the recipe instead of water. I also sprinkled in some cumin, turmeric, coriander, salt, pepper, and garam masala. It went well with the fish. It was a great meal and I'll definitely make it again.

My husband can be pretty critical, but he loved this dish!  (He said serving it with rice is a must.) 
 The only changes I made were less cayenne (per others' suggestions), fish stock instead of vegetable stock, and crunchy peanut butter in place of cashews (1.5 tablespoons--I had no cashews on hand).  Still a bit spicy hot, but perfect to me, as I love spicy hot foods!  Better than the Indian restaurants I have tried!

Wow! Possibly the best recipe on Allrecipes. Amazing - I use all of these ingredients all the time, but never tasted anything like this out of my kitchen. Wonderful flavor. I used olive oil because I don't like canola oil and 1 t cayenne, and one large filet of wild salmon, skin on bottom. Marinated in the baking dish I used and did not discard the marinate, just dumped the curry sauce on top of the fish before baking. Dressed it with thin slices of mango around the edges. What a delight.

I didn't make any changes when I made it.  My husband and I must be woosier than we thought!  We found it VERY hot and spicy, and weren't ready for it.  The next night we had sour cream on hand and it was delicious!  The fish was cooked perfectly in the time posted.

This was VERY spicy and EXTREMELY  good!  I used thick pieces of Cod.   My coriander was whole so i skipped it & had to use coconut milk for  the  broth because I didn't have that either .

We just made this for the first time, and it was fabulous! I used some sole filets and followed recipe almost exactly except for the ginger root which I did not have on hand. I was a little concerned that the garlic might be overpowering, and a little surprised to be adding sugar, but the flavors all blended perfectly. Very flavorful. This recipe will definitely be added to our rotation of fish dishes, thanks!!

This is a great recipe.  However the instruction page is wrong.  After the marinade contents, other contents are listed which are for the main cooking instructions.  The marinade instruction finishes when you add the fish to the marinade.

Made this last night according to recipe (added crushed cardamom seeds). Used Orange Roughy and baked for 25 minutes. Taste was excellent - on the very spicy side! Only issue was trying to blend (pulse) spices and onions. into paste. After 15 minutes of toing and froing, I gave up on it ever becoming a paste, but it turned out OK.

Very tasty.  Not very spicy as recipe calls, so if you like a little "kick" add some hot sauce.  We like "Satan's Blood" which is a chili extract, not a hot sauce.  I do have to ask though, why is this called "curry" when there is no curry in it?

I also usually order at least medium spicy, but my cayenne is insane (I've noticed this in other recipes) so unfortunately the sauce on this was almost inedibly hot. And that's after I cut it down to 1/2 t! But the recipe was delicious, especially with some greek yogurt on the side, and we really liked the overall flavor it imparted to the fish. I served with brown basmati and a curry-slathered roasted cauliflower, which was a really nice combo.

I followed the recipe exactly and while it was good, it was way too hot. Next time I will cut back to 1 tsp of cayenne. Otherwise a good way to liven up meal with fish. I served it with basmati rice and a Thai cucumber salad.

When I took my first bite I was not very impressed. My husband said it was "interesting". Both of us ended up liking it by the time we were finished our dinner. I used 1 tsp cayenne and found that it was plenty spicy. I used cod as that was what I had.  My cod was previously frozen and was water logged when I thawed it. I blotted it really well with paper towels so that it would not cook up watery. The fish texture was good after cooking.  I didn't love the texture of the sauce or the visual appearance of it.  Next time I will skip the food processor and finely dice everything..  I will also decrease the amount of salt.  With a bit of tweaking, this will be great for our personal preferences. Thanks for the recipe!

I am just starting to cook Indian food as i love spices  like cumin,turmeric,coriander. I made this with fresh Georgian Bay whitefish. Followed the recipe ingredients ,only cut back on the cayenne pepper and added some red pepper flakes. Also more cashews ,more vegetable broth and a heaping  tbs of tomato paste as my tomatoes were frozen and pretty tasteless. Love the sauce ..yummy...make more sauce .it is so  tasty. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for the first time this weekend for four dinner guests and my husband. I used wild caught cod as well as wild caught shrimp.  It was amazing.  My guests loved it  as well as my husband. The flavors were awesome even with forgetting to add the cilantro.. I served it with Basmati rice, cauliflower / string bean medley and Naan which my guests were using to dip into that delicious sauce. Definitely would make again!!!!

Excellent. Used only 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/2 jalapeno in onion paste mixture.  Didn't have turmeric so added a very mild curry powder and used 1 tsp hot mango chutney instead of sugar. Used twice the  amount of tomatoes. Used fresh red snapper.  Served over cumin seed basmati rice.  Would definitely serve to company.

Ugh, mine didn't come out well at all.:P  The sweetness of the  sugar was overpowering (and I used RAW cane sugar, which isn't as sweet as refined white sugar!), so I would suggest cutting the sugar that the recipes calls for way down.  In all fairness, I did replace the dry ingredients with my go-to curry masala, but that should not have affected how sweet this curry was!  I did use frozen fish (as the option was noted in this recipe), but it turned out chewy and tough, not like the tender flakes of fresh cod at all.  In terms of taste, I would have rated this recipe one star, but given that I didn't follow this recipe completely (I used my own curry masala instead), I compensated with the extra star.

Used Grenadier Fillets for this recipe and only used 1 tsp of Cayenne pepper which the kids ate but found a bit spicy so maybe next time I will cut back to 3/4.  Perfect recipe and will make again.

This was a very interesting dish.  I think it would be better with chicken, but it definitely changed things up for our normal white fish! I served this over brown rice with steamed veggies, it was very filling. It was spicier than expected, but yummy!

I’ve made this at least a half dozen times, and it is ALWAYS incredibly delicious! It is literally one of the best things I make. It is ALWAYS good, and ALWAYS flavorful! As others have said, I only use a fraction of the cayenne, though. DELISH!!!

The technique was cool, but it was way too salty. The spice mix doesn't need anywhere near that much salt.

I made mine with tilapia and the only change I made was a used 1.5 tsp of cayenne pepper.  It was wonderfully moist and flavorful!

Heaven. The best recipe I've ever found online. Family raved about it. Plus, everyone who ate it had extremely interesting, vivid dreams that night. Something about the combination of ingredients causes amazing dreams.

My husband is the only person who eats fish curries in our home. He loved it! I think I followed the recipe completely, except that I baked it at 400 F and used frozen tomatoes that I had saved from my garden produce.

I found it had a slightly bitter taste. Everyone else said they enjoyed it. I won't bother making this again.

Restaurant Quality right here!!

I'm a vegetarian, so I do not eat fish but my husband still does.  This recipe was amazing.  The curry flavor was very good. I adjusted the recipe for 3 servings and followed the recipe that way. I followed all directions as stated except I had no fresh tomatoes. For that, I used 1.5 TBS of tomato sauce. I also used about a half palm size of unsalted cashew pieces since I didn't have any whole cashews.  ETA: when we go to the Indian restaurants, we usually ask for a level 4/mild. I made this curry using only 1/4 tsp and it was a good amount. He said he'd rate it level 1 spiciness from an Indian restaurant.

I used 3 wild caught flounder filets for this dish. In the future, I will definitely make more of the sauce! It's extremely flavorful. I found myself constantly tasting it.

I used the whole 2 tsp of red pepper. Husband loved it. I thought it was funny to have the name curry in it and there's no actual curry in it! We used our favorite fish: snakehead. It's a very mild fish. I think it's the best fish out there.

Amazing! Used Chilean sea bass so it was very hearty. Next time I would add more cashews and a pinch more sugar but the recipe as it was fab! And topped it over spiraled zucchini instead of rice

Loved this recipe. It was initially challenging because I can't eat onions. I worked around this by using sliced mushrooms and a teaspoon of water in place of the onions. I also had 3 left over roasted fingerling potatoes I sliced up and added with the tomatoes. I used fresh rockfish caught locally by a friend for the fish. I spiced it as the recipe recommended and it was awesome. I put it over white rice. So yummy

First, the only reason I rate this as a 3 star is heat. I cut the cayenne in half and it was still too hot for us. Will try again with 1/4 of cayenne.

Second, am I missing something but where's the curry? It's one of the reasons I tried the recipe but didn't really realize that the curry recipe has no curry??

Delish! I threw a diced zucchini and red pepper into the frying pan with the onion and spice mix to add some veggies. Also cut down the cayenne to one tsp but it was still too hot. Next time I'll go with half a tsp!

I loved this recipe. I tried it with a type of fish that is farmed locally (it's ecologically friendly) called Baraumundi, which I'd never cooked before and it was amazing! This recipe would be great with fish or with chicken I think. It's a keeper!

I made this last night and hubby and I loved it!  Very spicy but we love our foods hot.

Very easy to make.  I did add about extra 1/2 tsp. of sugar and increased the amount of tomatoes (I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with liquid (I subbed that for the vegetable broth) and two fresh tomatoes chopped).

We will definitely be making this again and again
