YUUMMMYYYY!!!  I made a few changes though. I added an extra 1/4 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 heaping tablespoon of brown sugar an extra 1/4 cup mini semi-sweet choc. chips.  My kids LOVED them. Very moist and sweet.  Next time, I may try to make them a LITTLE healthier by using w/w flour, applesauce instead of oil and skim milk.

This is a great basic recipe for chocolate chip muffins. They turned out perfect. It is a great base to tweak however you like and experiment with....as they are, they're pretty foolproof.

I added a splash of vanilla extract, used a full cup of milk, and made a little less than 1/4 of my cup of sugar brown sugar. I used about 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips, but then sprinkled a few extra on the top of each muffin before I baked them for added chocolate as well as aesthetics. They turned out picture-perfect. Next time I'll probably add a pinch of cocoa to my batter and give that a shot. These were great!

Don’t listen to the negative reviews! This was a fine fast recipe!  I followed it exactly (okay I used canola – does anyone buy vegetable oil anymore?) and I added a splash more milk before I filled the muffin cups.  Here are my notes: the batter will be extremely thick, use a teaspoon and spoon it in.  I used mini-muffin cups and I filled only ½ full.  They rise a lot!  I baked mini’s for exactly 11 minutes & they weren’t very brown on top but they were completely cooked and they were golden brown on the stump.  It is fast and easy and good.  This is not a gourmet muffin but kids and coworkers will be happy.

Wonderful muffin! Not overly sweet so they're perfect for breakfast! I added a heaping tsp. of vanilla and used 1 cup of buttermilk instead of the 3/4 cup of milk which made these very moist. I also used a full cup of Hershey's mini chocolate chips. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin lined with paper liners and got a half dozen huge muffins. I topped them with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven and baked them at 400 for 20 minutes. They smelled great and tasted even better!

I like them very much. Easy to make. I did add some extra milk bc the batter was sooo thick. I feel like although they are very good, that there might be something small missing?? All in all though, quick and easy to make and a great treat!
***Update, I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a splash of vanilla and this time, I used canola oil instead of veg oil, and I swear, they were that much better. Awesome!

This recipe was easy to make, but that was the only good part about it.  When they were done and cooled, I did not care for them. I was disappointed with the results because this recipe looked pretty good. You can try it if you want, but I don't recommend it.

This is a really good basic muffin recipe. I read some of the reviews so I increased my milk to 1 cup, added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 T of vanilla. They were moist and delicious. I saw some people had a problem with the muffins sticking so I gave my non-stick pan a light coating of cooking spray and had no trouble at all. I also added a pinch of brown sugar and a couple of chocolate chips to the top of the muffins during the last 5 mn. of baking time. They looked as well as tasted great!

I did not like the texture of this muffin.  Mine was more like a biscuit with chocolate chips.  Something must be wrong with the ingredients, the batter was very firm.  Perhaps something like melted butter is missing?  I also think that I tasted the baking powder!  The taste was bland even after adding vanilla, again, I think that melted butter may add flavor.  I really do not think that extra milk would add that flavor it is lacking.  I may try this again and add some ingredients.

Excellent recipe. I did add the extra 1/4 cup milk and a few more chocolate chips. They were perfect texture and mine did brown. I would say that if you like your muffins really sugary and sweet that you should probably add more sugar. These were fine for me though. Will definitely make them again

Wow these muffins dissapeared so fast! They were just perfect - moist, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness. I recomend them to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast for their family.

I did not like this recipe very much.  I followed the other users review and it still didn't turn out right.  It tasted more like cornbread then a sweet muffin and all the chocoalate chips sunk to the bottom.

Albino muffins is what I got with this recipe.  Texture wise, they were great.  The batter itself tasted good, before baking, but it seemed to lose some of its flavor during cooking.  I halved the recipe, used a whole egg, 1/2 c milk, and 1/2 c chips, tsp vanilla.  This made 9 muffins and they only needed about 15 minutes to cook.  I may tinker with this recipe, I still prefer the boxed.

These are DELICIOUS! I did what other users suggested and added the milk, brown sugar, vanilla and extra chocolate chips. They're not TOO sweet, which is good because I made them for a breakfast potluck in one of my college classes, but you can very much taste the chocolate. I will definitely make these again!!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers, but these muffins still didn't turn out that great. They have a kind of weird texture and get stuck in the muffin cups. Maybe I overmixed? Won't be making them again.

Very nice muffins.  They rose up with nice domed tops.  They are a little dry, but I think I may have over baked them while waiting for them to get a little color on them.  They stay very white looking for much of the baking time.  Kids really like them.

A little colorless but they taste very moist if you add about an extra half a cup of milk like most suggested.

I wondered if maybe I didn't follow the recipe closely enough, until I read another review that said they were like a chocolate chip biscuit.  I didn't like them at all, but my kids did.

I used buttermilk, added 1 t. vanilla and 1/3 cup of applesauce along with the oil.  Since some reviewers had complained of dryness I added the applesauce instead of increasing the oil.  I always use vanilla if there is chocolate in the ingredients.  The muffins have turned out great.  I used mini cupcake pans. I will definitely use it again.  I think you could use blueberries or dried cranberries instead of chocolate for a different twist.

Not a good flavor at all. I had no problem with texture or sticking or anything(I added a splash of vanilla and a whole cup of milk and some brown sugar), they came out looking beautiful. But they tasted awful.

I made this on July 29,2010 for Josiah who loves chocolate, I added 1/4c. almonds and three bananas. They are baking now, will see how they come out. Isaiah loved the batter, that is a good sign.

I've never had such a baking fail as this one. I don't know why, but it was a gooey mess. I didn't even end up putting my very expensive chocolate in it - i didn't want to waste it, plus, there is no way this dough remotely resembles the texture of muffins. I don't have a clue what went wrong.

My husband declared this morning that he is a "muffin purist", eating only blueberry muffins with struesal. I was out of blueberries and tried chocolate chips instead. Even my picky eater loved these! 

I had to add a little extra oil, and I made some struesal for topping. Instead of semi sweet morsels, I used milk chocolate. We will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I added some vanilla for more flavor and used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil (all I had). They were really good but stuck to the muffin papers. Will try again!

These muffins had no taste.  I'm not sure how they could be doctored up -- I should have known from looking at the mix of ingredients (i.e. 1 T. of baking powder, no soda, no brown sugar, no vanilla, etc.) that the base recipe was not a winner.  I can only say, bake at your own risk!

I liked this recipe very much because it was so easy - they took no time at all.  I had fat free 1/2 & 1/2 in the house which I really do not use so I used that instead of milk.  I added vanilla extract 1/2teas. plus 1/2 teas. of almond extract.  Very nice flavor with the chocolate.  I used full size chocolate chips but mixed them between semisweet, milk and white. One of the reviews stated that they were more like a biscuit, maybe she overmixed plus there is a lot of baking powder, which will give a heavier texture.  Just fold dry ingredients until just moist.  Seeing some flour is fine.  Better to undermix a muffin.  Will make these again.

They are in the oven as I type.... I was nervous about the "dry" problem and "not sweet enough" so I too increased the milk to 1 cup Milk and the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  I used Canola oil, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup brown sugar & used cooking spray... hmmmmm.....  smelling good so far..... I promised my kids homemade chocolate chip muffins, they unfortunately like those store bought ones in the white pouches...YUCK!  I came across this recipe and decided to try it.... The verdict: YUMMY!  I think these are great and my kids (3, 6 and 8) LOVE THEM!  No more store bought junk!  That's good enough for me! (4 stars for having the base recipe and 5 stars using modified recipe!)

Not exactly what I was looking for, these mufins had more of a cake texture than a crumble texture which is what I'm looking for. Added more milk, some vanilla, and brown sugar as stated in other reviews. Not bad but I wouldn't use this recipe again.

My son found this recipe and surprised us with these muffins this morning. He is 14 and loves to bake, he followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic. They do not taste like the box mixes, and that is a good thing!

Good, but they got a little too dense after baking and cooling down. Might try to add more oil/milk next time.

Batter blended well.  Muffins turned out PERFECT.  Tops were raised, rounded, and deliciously crunchy, while the stems were soft and fluffy.  Color was a nice golden brown.   These were gone in 2 days.  I definitely would make these again.

These muffins were not at all sweet, they reminded me of biscuits.  They were also very, very dense.  I prefer my muffins much lighter and fluffier so I will be looking for a new recipe.

These are good muffins. But as I've made these twice I understand the bad reviews. Without a few tweaks these are plain and don't have much depth or taste, and are not sweet at all.  Don't be afraid to add extra sugar, milk and vanilla. I increased milk to 1 full cup, some of which I used heavy cream. I also added a spoonful of vanilla, used a full cup of sugar, half of which was brown, and used a full cup of chocolate chips. I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top of the muffins before baking and they came out very nice. I am not a big fan of very sweet things and even with my changes I don't think they were too sweet, but just perfect. I served mine hot with a small pat of butter inside. YUM! And btw, it doesn't really affect taste but I think the mini chocolate chips would work better in this recipe than the full sized I used.

They were easy to make and they looked good.  I followed the recipe and they did not turn out so good. Something has to be missing from this recipe because they turn out dry, crunchy and it tastes like baking powder. I do not recommend this recipe.

I used the extra help from Lilijo, and its outstanding and works the best!!!!  I would not have made it without these suggestions. Instead of a thick bland muffin its got a nice fluffy texture and is sweet. I added about 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 3/4 cups. Thanks Lilijo for the extra help!

Everyone loved these. I used about 1/4 t salt and replaced the oil with apple sauce. I put in half a smashed banana and substituted milk chocolate/peanutbutter chips. Really good, I made them yesterday and there is only one left!

These are just down right GOOD! I have made them EXACTLY as the recipe reads and I added Vanilla Extract. BOTH were really good. They do not last 30 minutes in my house of 4!! My two year old insist on eating TWO! My VERY PICKY 6 year old will eat 3 easily!! Ignore the bad reviews and just try it!

Made these for teenage Sunday school group.  What I liked:  they were quick, easy, and I usually have all ingredients on hand.  What I didn't like:  they were a little dry, bland, and didn't brown nicely on top.  I added vanilla, and held out 1T of the flour to coat the chips in so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.

I did not care for these muffins.  They came out very dry and more like a biscuit.  The texture just wasn't right.  I feel like something is missing.

Great recipe! At the last minute I added the teaspoon of vanilla that many people suggested. Since I only had regular sized chocolate chips I wanted to make sure that the muffin part had a little flavor besides just being sweet! The muffins rose amazingly and were so tender. Just a little note: muffins with add ins are supposed to have thick batter, that way the add-ins won't just fall to the bottom of the pan. I made the muffins in muffin papers and they didn't stick to the paper at all. My 4 yr old said "Mommy, these are the best big chocolate chip muffins I ever had!" Not that she's an expert but the whole family really enjoyed them!

This is really good with the modifications that other reviewers have left.  Used half wheat flower and half white.  Added 1/4 cup milk more and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Added teaspoon of vanilla and coated chips in flower to help not sink.  With all that they taste quite nice!!

These are very good! I followed others' tips and added a whole cup of milk (instead of 3/4 cup), a splash of vanilla, and about a tablespoon of brown sugar. However, I think the cup of milk was too much; the muffins were a little too moist. I think I may add 3/4 as recommended next time. They taste delicious! Thank you!

A coworker requested me to make a sweet treat for Valentine's Day, and since I can't bake, I scrambled to find something foolproof. This recipe seemed easy enough, so I gave it a go. I think next time I'll add a bit more milk to the batter, because mine was very thick and I had a hard time getting it into the muffin cups. Not pourable at all. Also, we don't have muffin pans, but I guess it was tart pans I used (I know nothing about bakeware!) So I ended up with 24 lil' mini muffins. My coworker was thrilled with the results, I however have mixed feelings about them. They do have a slight cornbread taste to them, which I wasn't crazy about. Overall, this is a good recipe to use as a jumping off point to be creative with. Thanks.

Very good muffins. I stuck to the recipe except I used butter instead of the oil and I did add about a 1/4 more of the chips. My muffins came out light and fluffy, and delicious. I did notice that after 8 - 10 min the muffins were done but the tops were not brown. I have a convection oven so I turned the fan on and they browned within a minute or so and were moist and fluffy inside. Update: I noticed that many are complaining that the chocolate chips are sinking to the bottom of the muffin. Don't add the extra milk that many are adding. The batter needs to be thick to hold the chips in place.

This recipe would be perfect except for the amounts of sugar & milk. I followed the other reviewers advice and added a full cup of sugar (brown & white) and a full cup of milk. With these alterations, they are delectible! My roommate loves them, my family loves them & my friends love them. I'm making another batch now to take to my co-workers! It's so simple to mix & they bake quickly. Good recipe!

Good muffins.  I made them for my son's sleepover and the boys could not stop eating them.  Also good if you sour the milk (add 1 tsp vinegar to milk)  also increased milk to 1 cup.  Added 1 tsp brown sugar.  FYI  if you make mini muffins cook for approx 13 minutes.

These are very good!  After reading other reviews about them being too heavy I decided to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk and I think they turned out perfect!

Ughhh I will not be making these again.  I followed the recipe and upped the milk to 1 cup and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract like some over reviews suggested and they tasted soo blahhh...there's no flavor to them at all.  I was expecting them to be sweet and delicious just as they look in the picture but they were far from it.  I quote my fiance, "it tastes like dense white bread with chocolate chips".  Moving on to another choc chip muffin recipe...

These were good but they were a bit dry for me. I would have to add more milk or something to moisten them. Overall good flavor, i added peanutbutter chips to mine also.

Good basic recipe.  Very easy to make but was missing something - will try again and add some vanilla next time.  Also I believe it needed the extra 1/4 cup milk I added just in case they were dry (like many reviews said).

Not super sweet, but tasty. I followed the tweaks of several other reviewers and upped the milk to 1 cup, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla. I wanted to make sure they had domed tops so I filled the cups and ended up with 11 muffins.

These chocolate chip muffins are very good.  I did, however, add 1/4 cup extra milk and 1/4 cup brown sugar to give a little extra sweetness.  I also sprinkled the tops of the muffins with just a few extra chocolate chips, because the chocolate chips tend to sink to the bottom of the muffin pan.  I'll definitely make these again as a special treat for my kids.

These were just awesome. I did follow the previous suggestions of adding a full cup of milk and a full cup of sugar(just white).  I added a splash of vanilla, next time I will add more as I think it defintely needs it.  I just had regular chocolate chips, and I added a full cup..all 12 muffins were gone in 24 hours!  They came out incredibly light and fluffy, which was nice in comparison to the heavy ones you get from a coffee shop. I just took one star off for needing to adjust the ingredients.  I know for sure it wouldn't have been sweet enough for me without the extra sugar and too bland without the vanilla.

I made these for my first attempt at making muffins for my husband. He really liked them and he's a picky eater. I think next time I would try what someone else suggested and use a little vanilla. Overall it's an easy recipe with a pretty yummy result.

these are definitely more scone like. I agree they need more sugar and more milk to make them more like a fluffy muffin. Not much flavor like this.

These muffins were very dry, dense and had little flavor.  I revised the recipe as follows: 2 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla.  They came out MUCH better, moist and delicious!

V good base, I subbed on cup of flour for one cup of pureed quick cooking oats, swapped out the regular sugar for brown sugar, added nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla - they tasted like chocolate chip cookies and had a nice texture from the oats!

I made several changes to this recipe. For starters, i doubled it, because the original recipe was very small for my family of 5. i took the advice of other reviewers and added brown sugar and vanilla. Since these are chocolate chip muffins, sort of a "dessert" type muffin, i thought they should be a little bit on the sweet side as opposed to most other types, which these were (i dont know how they would have tasted without my changes). So with that said here are my final changes (recipe doubled) 3 tbs brown sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 c. milk
These were great in texas style muffin pans for 20 minutes. very moist and crisp on top, they didnt stick or crumble

Great recipe.  I made recipe exactly as written.  They are a bit more dense than most muffins, but moist and very tasty.  They are not too sweet.  I will definitely make again, and will probably try them with other ingredients in place of the chocolate chips, possibly cranberries and white chocolate chips.

Made a few changes: 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour.  Added some extra chocolate (sprinkles, along with the chips).  Added 1 tsp. honey.  Used oat milk instead of cow's milk.  Baked 15 minutes at 200 Celsius.   They are plenty sweet and don't stick to the muffin-papers, but I really taste the whole wheat flour, so next time I may just use 1/3 whole wheat.   This recipe was enough batter for 11 muffins.

Easy recipe to follow recipe.  I also increased to 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Ended up making 17 muffins baking at 17 minutes.

I used whole wheat white flour, buttermilk and melted butter. Because I was concerned about the muffins being overpowered by the baking powder, I only used one teaspoon. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla extract. These were good but I think if you added a half cup or so  more milk, these might make a better chocolate chip pancake batter.

The taste wasn't great plus I baked them for 18 minutes and the bottoms burned :( Update: This was my second time making them, I didn't remember making them before, but I had the same results: came out too dry and burned a bit @ 18 minutes. Should've checked my review!

I trimmed this recipe down to make just 6 muffins and it said to add only a 1/2 of an egg but I still added to whole thing and these muffins came out amazing. My son and I ate all of them in 2 days. I think that the people who have had problems with these just add an extra egg to the full batch and that might help out a little bit.

Yum! These were fantastic. :)  I used a whole cup of milk, and added about half a teaspoon of vanilla. I also sprinkled some more chocolate chips on top of the muffins after I poured them into the cups.

These are incredible! I loved that I had all the ingredients at my fingertips. My 2 year old LOVES them and kept asking for more. I had to add a bit more chocolate chips than what the recipe called for, but aside from that, they were GREAT! Really moist, great taste. All around a must bake!

Fast and easy to whip these up. They need to be a little sweeter though or else use milk choc chips next time. I split these in half and filled them with some homemade whipped cream I needed to use up for a shortcake type dessert. This made 12 generous sized muffins. Thanks for the good recipe.

This is an ok recipe.  I made it exactly as directed, wasn't greatly impressed so I went to my old standby recipe.  Other reviewers say it's too thick, these are muffins people, not cake, they're to be dense and alot dryer than cake.  If your chocolate chips are sinking, mix 2 tbsp of your flour with the chocolate chips before adding to batter.
Better yet, ask for my recipe, I'll even include the directions to turn them into Turtle Muffins (with chocolate chip batter, as I don't like chocolate cake).

This was a great recipe, I also followed the advice of others and added a full cup of milk instead of 3/4 and sprinkled a few more chocolate chips on top.  I just used the regular sized chocolate chips.  Good stuff.  I will be using this recipe again soon

These didn't turn at well at all for me. I followed the other reviews instrustions and made it a full cup of milk. Also, I added a tsp of vanilla extract along with 1/4 a cup of brown sugar in addition to the 1/2. When  I pulled them out of the over, I allowed them to cool for 10 minutes before trying them. They still were not done even after the 10 minutes I let them sit with the 20 minutes of baking time. The toothpick came out clean but the inside was looked like it was still raw. [although it was not 'wet' like batter]They didn't rise at all for me. Maybe it was the stuff I added in but it seemed to have worked for other people  but it just didn't for me. I would not try it just to be on the safe side.

These came out very good!
 I did add extra milk & extra chocolate chips. The only thing is my chocolate chips mostly went to the bottom but I think that's because I added extra milk so the batter was not thick.

Over all they were very yummy!

Horrible.  I followed the directions as written and did add extra milk because the dough was sooo thick.  They tasted horrible, even my family did not like these so-called muffins.  I made for a company breakfast and was too embarrassed to bring them. I ended up purchasing real muffins at local grocery store!  Would not bake again. Anyone have a good recipe for muffins?

I was out of oil, so I used 1/2 cup of melted butter.  They turned out really well!  We'll definitely be using this recipe again!

A bit dense, added extra milk and brown sugar per other reviews.  Will make again but feel it needs some tweaking.

I read some of the other reviews and added the suggested amounts of milk, sugar, and chocolate chips to the original recipe.  The muffins came out moist but the bits of muffin that weren't chocolate chips were quite bland.

These muffins were really good. I increased the milk to 1 cup like others did. I think a bit of brown sugar would add a nice flavor to them so I'm going to try that next time. Also, I made these in the mini-muffin tins. I sprayed the pans, filled about 3/4 full and baked at the same temp for about 11 min. It made about 35 muffins, although they rise quite a bit so I could have made more had I not filled the cups so full. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were great, but I had to make three changes to make them so:
1) Add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
2) Add a splash of vanilla
3) Add 1/4 cup sour cream
I'd give this 5 stars with the changes, and 4 stars without (otherwise, they're a tad too dry and not flavorful enough).

These were just OK. Out of the 5 muffin recipes that i have made so far(from this site). This one is my least favorite. Without the chocolate chips, it would probably be VERY bland and unedible. Even after adding extra milk (which is a must) i still found it a lil dry.
UPDATE: I gave these out to 2 different people. I went to visit today and the muffins were still sitting in a ziplock bag.

I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The flavor was good, but definatly not the best.  I did not have mini chocolate chips and used regular instead, which made my muffins look very ugly.  The fact that they did not brown also contributed to the ugly factor.  My two-year-old didn't seem to mind either way...his first words after biting into it was "yummy!".  That made it worth it :)

These were fabulous. My daughter and I made them when she needed to take a snack to school. They were quick, easy and really yummy. I didn't think they were dense at all as others have said. The only thing I added was a little vanilla. I think this would also be good baked in a bundt pan.

We love these things! It's like eating a big fluffy cookie. We made mini muffins and regular. As mentioned, these are quite dense, but we enjoyed them that way and felt no need to change anything! Do NOT wait for these to brown!(Baked by an eight-year-old.)

Not much of a "muffin"-like consistency at all. If you're looking for a non-muffin muffin (or a chocolate chip biscuit, perhaps), this is your recipe. This was one of the few recipes that I actually chucked into the waste basket.

This rating is based on these criteria:
Fast, easy, yummy, convenient.
I have four children and if I can't make the muffins in a reasonable amount of time with what I have- I will never make them. This recipe is a keeper for us. Best straight from the oven. Use good quality chocolate, and good quality flour- it makes a difference in baking. Make sure your BP is not old and you are using powder- not soda.
Also, some people were not happy because it did not meet expectations- they expected more sweetness or  a thin batter, or a different taste...this is a fast recipe for chocolate chip muffins which will taste like a plain muffin with chocolate chips- not like a cake. Yes, the base is biscuit or scone like. Add vanilla if you want. I make this so I can have chocolate faster than it takes to make cookies :)
I use a small ice-cream scoop and mini-muffin tin.
If you want an easy snack that won't send kids into a sugar frenzy, I recommend it. 
If you want a chocolate cupcake- this is not it.

I made these using the advice of another reviewer by using 1/4 cup more milk, 1 tsp. vanilla,a heaping Tbsp. of brown sugar, and I also used regular chips instead of the mini ones. They were outstanding! I own and operate a bed and breakfast and these muffins are now one of my favorites to serve. I use a muffin tin that makes large flower shaped muffins and they have a little crispy edge to them that is wonderful. These will surely be served as part of my special Valentine's breakfast!

Very good!! My kids love them. I used canola oil and added one cup of whole wheat flour instead of 2 cups white and half my sugar was Xyla and then white sugar. Very basic recipe, so you can make it just the way you want.

These muffins were so easy to mix while the breakfast coffee was brewing. I greased and floured the muffin tins, and I happened to use self-rising flour. I omitted salt and baking powder from the recipe, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I mixed all the dry ingredients well, and mixed the wet ingredients well, added the chocolate chips to the dry mixture, and folded in the wet mixture. They rose very well, had a tender crumb but held together well. These are a very nice, simple, tasty muffin!

I didn't really like how mine turned out. But I think it might be because I'm new to baking. They weren't terrible, just not what I imagined. They did remind me of biscuits a little bit. I'm definitely not against trying them again some other time!

The muffins are OK, the OK part being fast and easy muffins. Although they baked perfectly, the TASTE and TEXTURE are a bit boring, I didn´t find the special nor delicious. I didn´t have milk so replaced it with cream and added vanilla to add a bit of flavour.  If you bake them, add vanilla! If not it will taste like white bread with chocolate chips.

These are awesome, and so easy to make. I was looking for a recipe with simple ingredients, I never thought the muffins would be so easy to make. They came out great, they taste awesome while they're still warm from the oven. I added a bit of vanilla to the batter and a ton of chocolate chips. Yum! Thanks for this!

I made this recipe last night, and although the muffins ended up being edible, My husband and I really didn't enjoy them. I followed the recipe exactly, and they ended up tasting like biscuits with chocolate chips in them. Very disapointing :(

I'll be honest, the only reason i made these is because i had extra chocolate chips laying around, but i would buy them specifically for this recipe. They were so easy to make!! The batter came out the perfect consistency and there was no mess after. (I did add a tsp of vanilla though, and a few extra chips). This is an amazing recipe!

I would give these 4 1/2 stars.  They are just what I was looking for.  I think that people who had trouble with the batter may have stirred it too much.  It says just to stir until moist.  Mine were very light, not overly sweet.  But with the chips, I wouldn't want it any sweeter.  My kids, teenagers, love them.  Just simple and good.  Also good to make your own changes...use the basic batter recipe and add bluberries, strawberries, peanut butter...whatever.  Good basic, easy recipe.

The muffins aren't super moist but this is still a very good recipe.  I healthified it a bit... substituting apple sauce for the oil, using half wheat flour, and also lowering the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I also used the same recipe to make blueberry muffins!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I will not be making these again..they were heavy and bland even the chocolate chips didn't save them.  I added Vanilla and it did nothing.  The kids wouldnt eat them, and they will eat anything baked!  If you are making them follow some of the hints people are giving in reviews...myself I will be finding a new recipe!!

What a great simple recipe!  I took into account all previous reviews and did tweak the original recipe a little.  I used 2 cups of pastry flour instead of all-purpose, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I did not add more milk but I did add 1 individual serving of vanilla yogurt (4 oz).  Make sure to mix well.  Definitely flour the chocolate chips before adding to the batter which I also reduced to 1/2 cup.  These muffins turned out great and were super-easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe - this is definitely a keeper!

These aren't as sweet as I thought they should be.  I did change it up a bit -- I did 1c whole wheat flour and 1 c white flour, so that could have been the difference.    I have to say though that these are beautiful muffins and I will be making them again.  I think I'll add a little more sugar next time though.

This is a great recipe. They taste amazing. The only changes that i made were to add an extra quarter cup of chocolate chips and to and a quarter cup of brown sugar. When I make them, they are always gone the next day.

I made these twice. The first time, I overbaked them. I thought they looked too "white" to be done, and waited until they looked browned on top. This was a mistake in my case. The second time, I took them out at about 20 minutes. They weren't very browned at all, but they tasted much better than the first batch.

This is my first time using this recipe and my muffins turned out pretty great! After I had already started putting the ingredients together I realized that I had finished off all of my eggs earlier in the day and it was a blizzard out so I couldn't run to the store and get any! I ended up forgoing the egg and the muffins still turned out fabulous! I will definitely use this recipe again :)

I made this recipe for our office and everyone loved them. I did add a little extra milk because it was too thick to put in the muffin foils. I would also recommend adding some vanilla since they are not very sweet.

Not my favorite. I could really taste the baking powder, and I noticed another reviewer had that same problem. If I make them again, I might try using less.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used one cup of milk rather than the original 3/4 cup, and added just over a teaspoon of vanilla. The muffins turned out fluffy and delicious. Delighted my boyfriend who loves big warm muffins!

I would have to agree with some of the reviewers here, and say that this muffin is just too bland for my tastes.  The chocolate chips are the only real reason I would eat these muffins - even after I added an 1/8 cup of brown sugar, a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla, there was little flavour to the muffin base.  
I did follow the suggestions to top up the milk to 1 cup, so at least the muffins did turn out quite moist.

These were pretty good, but not great. I added just a splash more milk, a teaspoon of vanilla, and coated the chocolate chips in a little flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them sinking to the bottom.

I used other user's suggestions and added a full cup of milk, brown sugar and vanilla. I wouldn't suggest using the cheap chocolate chips and I did. Go for the familiar brand of choice. I may try this again with blue berries. The batter isn't too sweet or anything.

This is our go-to recipe for basic chocolate chip muffins--my daughter loves them. I'll add walnuts or pecans if I have them--they are delicious with or without. As others suggested, I increase the milk to  1 cup and use half brown and half white sugar, and also add a little vanilla. That makes them taste just like chocolate chip cookies! A great weekend breakfast treat.

These were gone in 1 day!  I used 1 cup milk instead of 3/4 and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also used regular sized chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.  My kids are begging me to make more!

this was a very quick and delicious recipe.It was great. my husband loves chocolate chip muffins, and he doesnt usually have to time for breakfest so i make these, freeze them like recommended and bake them before he goes to work. so quick and good he has them fresh with a glass of milk.The recipe is so versitle i was able to make them even though i have a 4 month old baby. I added a splash of milk near the end, added a bag of mini chocolate chips so  much better, and added vanilla of course.makes 12 big beautiful muffins. Thanks a million.

I followed the reviews of afew other people and added a full cup of milk and abit of vanilla. I also ran out of white sugar so subsituted the remaider with brown sugar. They are great muffins, and I found they raised ALOT! Very good though. My family loves them.

This is an awesome easy recipe!  They are fluffy, golden and crisp outside with soft, moist inside.  Closest recipe I've made that resembles the bakery or box muffins (the Krusteaz ones I love).  I followed the tips in the reviews and added 1 tsp vanilla, extra 1/4 milk and I also used brown sugar.

My sons love this!! I did make them with 1 cup milk and split the sugar to 1/4 white and 1/4 brown and added 1 tsp vanilla. I cut the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp, and mine didn't rise up that much. I would rather add less though, in other recipes, when I use that much baking powder, you can taste it, and it is not a pleasant taste. These are delicious, but mine didn't brown at the top, so don't keep them in that long or they will burn. I tried both regular sized muffins and mini muffins. The mini muffins cooked in only 8 mins. This will definitely become a staple in my house!! Thank you!!

I added what Luwebby suggested in her review, but also changed the oil to virgin olive oil, used spelt flour, and put in a few table spoons of wheat germ!

They are so good, this muffins are almost gone as I'm finishing my review!

Wonderful muffins!!!! I did add 1/4c additional milk and used 2 eggs. I also spiced them up with a nice sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar in the batter and as a topping. They turned out great! Very fattening but oh sooooo  good!

This recipe is great!  I used whole-wheat flour and raw sugar (a little less) instead.  I also took the advice to add a little more milk and oil.

I make these muffins according to the recipe and they turn out fine.  My husband and I are not chocolate chip muffin fans, but my daughter loves them.  They are great for her lunch.  I sprinkle a little extra sugar on top to make them even more special.

Following the reviews, I put a whole cup of milk, and they turned out just fine. The recommended baking temperature of 400 F is a bit too much though. 375 worked better for my oven.

Very delicious!
I didn't have any of the problems that the other people stated. My muffins were perfectly sweet and moist.
Most of the dessert recipes on this site have enough sugar to make your teeth fall out anyways. I always cut the sugar in at least half.
But, this recipe had the perfect amount of sugar. The muffins were sweet but, not sickeningly sweet.
I added a teaspoon of vanilla, raisins, and chopped nuts as I wanted to add a little extra something. It was really good! I ate three in a row :)
The only reason why this didn't get the perfect 5 stars was because I had the same problem as someone else did. My muffins were sticking a bit to the muffin papers. But, it wasn't a huge problem.
I will still make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious recipe. I started this recipe by preheating the oven as I prepared and mixed the ingredients (I don't think it metioned preheat the oven). I used 1/4C.brown sugar and 1/4C. white sugar. Everyone has their own taste, but for me I love the muffin texture and chocolate chips; my boys LOVE the chocolate chips.  This recipe came together so easily.  I used a cupcake pan and I had enough batter to make 12.  Next time I will follow recipe; I can't wait!  Yummy!  Delish!

Really good texture, not too heavy, not to light.  But, a little dry and could have been a little more moist though.  I did use large chocolate chips instead of minis.  This is a great breakfast muffin or snack muffin.  A little sweet but not quite a dessert muffin.  That being a good thing to me.  :)
Time and temp is good.  I doubled the batch and the first set came out less browned then the first, at the 20 minutes.  The 2nd set were a beautiful brown top.

Great muffins! I took the advice of other reviewers and added and extra 1/4cup of milk. Texture was great, through the muffins didn't brown at all. Kids will LOVE these!
