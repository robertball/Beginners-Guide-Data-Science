Made this for a shower, everyone liked it-thought I bought it. I changed things a bit-I used 1 orange pepper and 1 yellow pepper, I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic (minced),also as suggested, I added 1/2 of a red onion, and I used grape tomatoes, which I added, along with the cheese, in the morning. The rest I made the night before to give the flavors time to blend.

I made this salad for a 4th of July party for 15 people, everyone LOVED it even the kids.  It was so easy to make and tastes so good.  I can't wait for another party to make it again !!!
The next time I make it I would add a couple things.  I would add about a 1/2 cup of diced red onions, and a avacado. It is still good just the way it is, but to add a little more zip !!!!

This was terrific!  I used this for two covered-dish meals I had within one day  of each other.  I couldn't find Buitoni's tortellini, but I did find a huge bag (42 oz, I think) of another brand and it still worked out great (half the bag for each batch).  For the first batch, my mother was helping and unknowingly used a different salad dressing than I was planning to use, and it was still great.  I used the Newman's Own Family Italian for the second batch and did like it better.

To make things a little easier, I used thawed frozen baby broccoli florets (again was able to find a large enough bag that I had enough for two batches) rather than fresh florets.  I also used plum/roma tomatoes, sliced in half then cut into several slices.  They're pretty and have really good flavor, especially this time of year when local garden tomatoes are unavailable.

This recipe has substance to it, is healthy, and is delicious.  I'd definitely try it again!

I used Newman's Own Parmesan Dressing, grape tomatoes (halved) and chopped orange bell pepper. This turned out great! I didn't want the run-of-the-mill Italian dressing covered pasta salad, and the parmesan dressing was outstanding. I also used lots of freshed cracked black pepper.

This the perfect pasta salad.  Everyone had seconds and it's so easy to make.  I used Paul Newman's Italian salad dressing.

I loved this pasta dish! It was delicous! I have four kids and it is not always easy to make a dinner quickly that everyone likes. With this recipe, dinner was quick and easy and it is now a family favorite!

I made this last night for the first time and it was delicious!  I did take the suggestions of other reviews and added about 1/2 cup of red onion and it did give it more flavor, however I think next time I would reduce it to 1/4 cup because it was a little overpowering.  I also used red pepper instead of green and I think it was better than the green would have been.  I added salt and pepper too for more flavor.  Another thing I did was use frozen broccoli and boiled it for about 2 minutes and it was great.  This salad is even better the second day.

I've made this salad twice for office potlucks and it went over very well with everyone. I did blanch the broccoli for about 30 seconds to make it just a little bit tender. Very easy to whip up the night before, just be sure to use a good-quality Italian dressing.

This is a very good recipe.  Great for a light dinner (served with french bread) or a light lunch.  I used sweet red bell pepper instead of green.  This would also be nice for potluck dinners or office parties.  Would make again.

Loved this pasta salad!  I brought it to a potluck lunch today and it was gone in a flash.  The adults and children really enjoyed it.  I used Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian salad dressing and it worked well with this recipe.  I did find that having made it the night before, I needed to add a little more dressing just before serving because it seemed to have dried out a little.

This is great... so easy to make, yummy, and it looks nice too!  Per prior suggestions I added about a 1/2 cup finely chopped red onion, red bell pepper instead of green, and since I don't usually buy Italian dressing I didn't know a good one so I tried Paul Newman's and liked it.  Also used the larger size can of sliced olives just because I love olives, and lots of fresh ground pepper because I love pepper.  When I first tasted it the night I made it I was worried about adding the onion, it tasted a bit strong, but by the time we had it for an office potluck lunch the next day, the onion had mellowed out, and the salad tasted great!  I will make this often, and can see myself practically living on it in the summers when I love dinner from the fridge.

Loved it!  This is now the only pasta salad recipe I will make!  I did put in halved cherry tomatoes instead of chopped.  I used Newmans own Italian Parmesan Dressing.  I did add some more right before serving as with all pasta salads the pasta soaks up the dressing some.  Guests loved it!

This pasta salad was excellent.  I added 3 green onions and cucumbers.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of Newman's Italian.  It was really great with fresh pepper.  I LOVE YOU BUITONI!

I love this recipe but try using the whole wheat Tortellini noodles and the Family receipe Italian dressing. The combination of the sweetness from the whole wheat noodle and the savory taste of the dressing is out of this world. Kids love it too.

I used Newmann's Own dressing but still didn't care for this recipe.  Not enough flavor, needs more spices.

Excellent and simple recipe.
I used light Italian dressing and it tasted great.  My 2 year old daughter had a great time mixing it up with me.

Made for mothers day BBQ and was very well received.  It was much better the next day.  I used a yellow pepper instead of green for color.  Great salad, will make again.

Yummy!  I only did about half the brocculi an lots of red bell peppers simply because of my own tastes, big hit with everyone.  We had it w/ dinner and my husband had the rest fow lunch at work over a week, saved very well and he said was good to the very last bite (plus a good way to sneak veggies into his lunch)

Wonderful and fresh salad.  I love this and so does the crowd.  Definitely use Paul Newman's dressing (if you can find it)

I added cheddar cheese cubes, used grape tomatoes halved, and also used a parmesan italian dressing.  It turned out really well and was well received by our guests.

A little to simple for my tastes but a good base. Added salt and fresh ground pepper and used cherry tomatoes instead of chopped.

This was good when I first made it but it didn't keep very well as leftovers.

This recipes is just ok.  Its easy and quick to make in a pinch but it just missing the punch it needs to make it spectacular.

Very good.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes.  I will prepare it a day in advance next time.

This recipe was soo easy to make and tasted delicious!  I added pinenuts, cherry tomatoes and Bernstein's Italian dressing-I recomend adding a little bit more dressing than the recipe calls for.  Next time, I am going to use Feta, onion and salami.

I've made this pasta salad several times & everyone loves it! I do recommend using a good quality Italian dressing.
