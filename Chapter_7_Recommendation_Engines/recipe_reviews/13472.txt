It was very dry. Next time I will add some chicken broth to it.

I don't know what possessed me to try this recipe.  In retrospect, I should have known from the ingredients and instructions that it wouldn't be good.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner but I was too embarrassed to serve it.  The only advice I can give to someone who definitely wants to try this recipe is to maybe chop the apple well (I diced it) and perhaps crumble the bread instead of cubing it.

It's a five star when you add mushrooms.  I have been using this recipe for years.  It's right out of Joy of Cooking, but Joy of Cooking didn't have mushrooms in the recipe.  Cut the bread into crouton size squares, and don't skimp on celery or onion.  I usually have to make a lot more and add 1/3 more ingredients.  The raisins make this recipe taste as if I used wine, at least that's what my dinner guests tell me.

This was my first attempt at home made dressing & everyone loved it!  I saved some out of the Turkey to serve as a side dressing & my vegeterian friends have asked for the recipe.

This was the best stuffing I have ever made. It was just perfect. There were no left-overs. Try it! You won't be sorry. Yummy.

I really enjoyed this dish and others who shared this with me over Thanksgiving raved about it! At someone's suggestion, I added a little chicken stock so it was perfectly moist. Tasty.

This was a great recipe, with a little modification.  I  used store bought bread cubes in a bag (w/a light onion seasoning).  I prepared the night before and refrigerated until I was ready to cook it.  Before baking I added LOW SODIUM chicken broth and some of the broth from my Turkey and baked when the turkey only had about an hour left.  I made a large recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  It was a big hit at the dinner table!

This is always a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I do make two small modifications: (1) use dried cranberries instead of raisins and (2) add a little Apple juice or cider for moisture.  This complements the Granny Smiths and also keeps the dish suitable for a vegetarian in the family

I've making this recipe for years - its now a family tradition.  For the folks whose dressing was too dry or bland, sounds to me like you got the recipe wrong some how - too much bread or not enough butter. I adjust based on what type of bread I have hanging around for the crumbs - some soaks up the butter more than others.  I also sometimes add sage. My kids come home for this dressing and if I ever made something different they wouldn't be happy.
