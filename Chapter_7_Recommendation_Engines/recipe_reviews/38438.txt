We found this recipe to be very good with the following modifications: sugar was increased in the batter to 1/2 cup and in the topping to 2 tablespoons.  I used milk instead of the milk powder plus water.  I baked it quite a bit longer than called for, probably because the apricots were very juicy.

Absolutely incredible, economical, EASY recipe. I did as suggested by other reviews and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used whipping cream instead of powdered milk and water, and increased the vanilla 3 fold...which gave the cake a great flavor. I was so impressed with the ease of making this, and how few ingredients and items on hand are in pantry. My husband and I ate the whole thing. I also used a rectagular glass pan which worked well. I baked mine for 40 minutes. I also had one small peach which I added to the apricots, added 3 times the sugar with cinnamon, and it was so good. DEFINITELY a coffee cake for company!

I read several of the reviews for this recipe, and increased the sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup, used 3 tbsp. of butter, and regular milk instead of powdered. I also spread half the batter in the pan, then topped the half with a mixture of cinnamon sugar, added the other half of the batter and proceeded with the directions for the topping. Baking took exactly 45 minutes, and when the cake had  cooled slightly, I added a powdered sugar and milk icing. Tangy and sweet, this coffee cake really wakes up your taste buds! I will definitely make this again. Fresh apricots are difficult to find here, but I am sure that well-drained, canned apricots could be used.

I followed Margalo's suggestions about the sugar and milk and this was excellent. It is nice and cakey with a good tart topping. I think I will try it with apples next time to see how it comes out.

Delicious!!! I also added 1/2 cup more of sugar as others suggested.  I also added an extra cup of apricots, spreading all of the apricots on the bottom of an 8 x 11 pan, poured the batter and  topped the batter with  chopped pecans.

Ok- made the changes everyone suggested (more sugar and used liquid milk) but needed even more sugar to combat the tartness of the apricots.  Read somewhere that apricots do not improve in taste once picked so even though mine looked ripe they did not taste very good.

This cake was not to my liking.  The cake part
tasted more like bread.  Apricots turned very sour
during the baking process. They were sweeter than that when raw.   I would not make this cake again.

This is a good recipie to use up fresh apricots. It is a tart cake that goes well with ice cream or sweetened whppedcream. I also used milk not milk powder + water. Next time I will use a 9 inch pan, as my cake overflowed.

Tastes good. I used finely chopped dried apricots, as fresh, they are hard to come by where I live. I used regular milk, instead of the powdered milk plus water. I put cinnamon and sugar in between the mix as I put it in the pan, just to make it pretty. Maybe next time I will put some chopped nuts on top.

Good--everyone in the office gobbled it up and there was nothing left at the end of the day.  I did change it up:  used a bundt pan and put the apricots between two layers of batter instead of on top.  I also upped the sugar to 1/2 cup and added apricots to the batter itself.  I added a vanilla glaze after baking, which helped counteract some of the tartness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this. Made the same milk/sugar changes as others. I served it warm with whip cream on top. next I am going to try making one with canned peaches and one with cherry pie filling.

Good recipe.  I would do again. I used 3/4 sugar instead of the 6 tbs and found I didn't have milk or powdered milk, so used 2/3 cup sour cream.  Will use 2/3 cup milk next time instead of the powdered milk and 2/3 cup water in the recipe.  I also incorporated the 2 cups chopped fresh apricots into the batter and baked in a 8 x 11.5 x 2 pan. Will probably do in a 9 x 9 next time. Yummy.

This was a bit on the dry side. Although I made it according to the original recipe, except subbing real milk for powdered milk, I'd probably recommend for most people to up the sugar (as suggested by many) and be ready for something not moist and like real coffee cake.

I also increased the sugar in this recipe, added an extra cup of apricots mixed throughout the batter.  Used milk instead of milk powder and water and topped with apricot juice mixed with sugar to make the glaze after baking is finished.  will definitely be making this again soon.  We have so many apricots this year I am trying every recipe I come across, and thank heavens for freezers!

Good cake to make for the family..used 1/2 cup of sugar in the batter and milk instead of powdered milk and a bit more cinnamon and sugar on top. I also used a few chopped strawberries, which I had left over as well as fresh apricots..when the cake was cool I sprinkled it with milk and sugar powder icing...delicious!!!!

These were AMAZING!! Used extra apricots (because we had a lot to use).  I had last minute company, they were so easy to throw together and everyone couldn't stop raving about them!

Love it!  Turned out great and was easy.  Used milk & more sugar. Everyone wanted more.  Will make it again.
