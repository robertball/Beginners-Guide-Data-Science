Wow.  This is great.  A trick I use for pasta and potato salads is to double the dressing and put 1/2 on when first made and then let the salad sit in the fridge so the flavors "marry".  Then add some of the left over dressing right before you serve and when you want to eat the leftovers.  Of course in this case there will probably be no leftovers as this salad is so good.

Well Jim, I have to say this is pretty darn good.  I doctored it up a little bit though.  Used 1/2 the pasta, 5 hardboiled eggs (since they were about to reach their pull date) a little green onion for color, some sweet relish, paprika, and celery salt, and I added a little extra mayo (light of course!) per others suggestions as well as a bit of sour cream. Took out the green peppers.  Even with half the pasta it made about 8 cups of salad, which is perfect for us.  This one goes in the recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

I also thought this was a little dry-definitely needs more mayonnaise.

This salad was a huge hit at a recent cookout, and it gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. We've played around with the recipe by adding bacon, fresh tomatoes and more pickles. Delicious!

Really good salad.  Just like potato...except with macaroni.  I didn't use the green pepper or the vinegar and used onion powder in place of the onions.  I made this for a small get together and our company loved it enough they wanted the recipe.  I love the eggs in this.  Thanks for sharing James.

Jim, this is a great recipe.  Thanks.  I made it for a dinner party (picnic) and everyone loved it.  I did take the suggestions to add more wetness as 1 cup of mayo is not enough for the volume.  I added 1 cup of lite sour cream (instead of mayo).  The only other variation would be to use the small can of sliced olives as opposed to whole.  This recipe is a keeper.  I'm passing it around!

I changed this up a little to our likes. I omitted the  pimento peppers, bell pepper and cheese. I added in peas, sliced olives sour cream and a little more mayo. It's a good basic macaroni salad!

This recipe made a HUGE bowl of salad.  I would say much more than 8 – 10 servings.  I would suggest using 12 ounces of macaroni, or increasing the cider vinegar to 1 ½ tablespoons and the mayonnaise to 1 ½ cups.  Due to personal preference, I also substituted sweet pickle relish for the chopped dill pickles.  Thanks Jim for sharing your family’s favorite!

Great recipe, thanks for posting it.  I was out looking for a good macaroni salad when I ran across this one.  I was making it just for me, my wife, and my daughter, but later in the day after helping a neighbor work on his roof he invited us over for a barbecue so I brought this new macaroni salad I made. Not knowing how it was going to taste since I just made it for the first time, I was pleasantly suprised that everyone at the barbecue kepted raving about it.  Everyone kept asking me how I made it, and I told them how I got the recipe.  Cheese combined with black olives and pimentos give it the right touch.  Thanks again for a great, quick, and tasty macaroni salad.

This was just what I was looking for: Grandma's macaroni salad.  I didn't want drippy, tangy, grocery deli macaroni salad.  This one was a perfect "pasta" salad.  Perfect for my taste, blending grandma's macaroni with Kraft ranch pasta salad.  It's really good and simple.  I took the advice of others and doubled the mayo-vinegar dressing.  Do this!  I promise it won't be soupy!  Slicing olives is tedious so I stopped at a 1/2 can.   Try this.  Stir the olives in.  If you think you need more, you've got a half can in front of you, so add what you like. I love crunch and was so itching to add celery, but the bell pepper and onion, plus the chopped pickle and pimento added enough crunch to satisfy the celery freak/ extra lettuce me.  I enjoyed this so much, I made another batch 3 days later.  3 days after that I was buying macaroni salad at the grocery store to fulfill my craving while on my lunch break at work.  Does not compare!  Make this salad!  It's my new fave!

omgoodness, this is so good. I didn't add the vinegar or pimento, or dill pickles, or processed cheese. I did add half a packet of ranch, used sweet pickle relish, and diced pepper jack cheese.

What a great salad!!  I get bored with traditional salads so was super excited to find this one.  I did make a few slight changes ... I did 1/2 C of mayo with 1/2 C of light sour cream & 1 1/2 tbsp of vinegar ... creates a thinner and smoother dressing. I also omitted the cheese because it seemed like an odd ingredient with the rest. Absolutely enjoyed it! Have been asked to make again 3x already!  : )

Jim you did it, this is great.  I did add the extra mayo and think next time I'll use sour cream for the extra moisture.  I left out the peppers (personal preference) and added about 1/2 of a cup of chopped celery.  Will be serving this tonight with the Restaurant style cole slaw from this site and BBQ chicken.  Did someone forget to tell me it is Spring and not Summer?

I only thought that this salad was average and a bit too cheesey for macaroni salad. I am not interested in making it again.

This was a big hit at our Memorial Day party!!!  I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did different was add extra mayonnaise and a half a red bell pepper.  This was by far the best macaroni salad I've ever made!

Took this to a bbq and it was a hit.  I substituted red pepper for the green and added red onion instead of white.  Also, I used rotini pasta in place of the macaroni.  I think it could have used a bit more kick, I might add a tablespoon of mustard next time.  Also, added chopped ham and chopped cheddar instead of American cheese.  It's great!

This is now my standard macaroni salad recipe. Everyone  raves about how delicious it is.
  I did make a few small changes: increased the dressing by half again, substituted red pepper for green and substituted chunks of cheddar for the American cheese.
  Yummy. Thanks, Jim!

I'm giving 5 stars because it's a great recipe to begin with and it's also a great jumping off point. After the first "by the recipe" batch(which was great) I knew how I would "tweak" it the next time.  Replaced dill pickles with "bread 'n' butter"(and lots of 'em).  Bell pepper out...celery in.  Thin slices of chopped ham instead of olives & I thinned out the dressing with a little pickle juice. Those are my changes to a great original recipe and for the first time ever I can say "YIPPEE" to a macaroni salad!! I never thought that would happen.  I'm so stoked I'm thinking about trying that Amish mac salad recipe I've seen on this site. Wish me luck.

Add more mayo, but overall great!  I omitted the bell pepper, my family doesn't care for them.  and colby instead of american cheese.  This can also work for potatoe salad, (just replace the noodles for 5 potatoes, black olives/pimientos for green olives, no cheese and some mustard) and presto!  The best potatoe salad in the mid west!

This was just okay. I had to add a few other ingredients because it didn't have any flavor at all. Probably won't make it again.

Excellent!!! Have made several times.  These are the alterations I have made to the recipe.    Instead of pimento I use a half a jar of  roasted red pepper and decrease the macaroni to 8 ounces.    Everything else is the same.  Will make again and again.

Super yummy. I used shells instead of macaroni and added in 1/2 tsp of garlic and 1 tbl of grey poupon. Also, used sweet relish instead of pickles and "seasons blend" instead of having to chop all the vegggies. Left out the eggs, pimentos, olives, and cheese simply because I thought that would be too much for my taste, though it might be a little bland without them for the rest of you. I thought this salad was perfect.

LOWER FAT ALTERNATIVE!!  This recipe is fantastic but I wanted to make it a little lighter (holy calorie count!).  Like others I used half the pasta and to make it more colorful, I used red onion and yellow, orange. and red bell peppers.  I omitted the pimiento...texture issue...and hubby doesn't care for black olives - left them out, too.  Swapped reduced fat cheddar cheese for american.  All that in mind - and having cut the pasta in half - I left all the other quantities the same (to deal with the dry dressing issue).  For the 1 cup of mayo I used half light mayo/half non-fat plain greek yogurt.  These slight modifications don't do much to change the taste (it's FABULOUS!!) and it's much lighter from the light mayo and greek yogurt.  You could also use low-fat/non-fat sour cream with about the same results.  Excellent recipe, Jim...Thanks for sharing!!

I have used this recipe ever since it was put on the www site.  It is the BEST.  I add 2 tablespoons of Concord cole slaw dressing.  It is a powder form.  It makes the flavor more intense.  I also used more peppers by putting in green, red and orange.  I also used small chunks of cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese.  I would recommend this to anyone.  You can do so many things to vary it.

This is the only Macaroni Salad recipe I use any more.  The only thing I do different is Cheddar instead of American cheese.  Thanks Jim!!!

Fantastic!!! This salad received rave reviews at our church potluck so I made it again for a cookout. Even my two guests that didn't care for macaroni salad (just ate it to be polite)had seconds! I omitted the cheese because I don't care for American cheese. I did add halved cherry tomatoes and seasoned with celery salt. This is definetly a keeper. Thanks Jim!

I cut the recipe in half & deleted the pickles (though I may add them next time), olives & cheese.  I also added chopped celery and substituted red onion for the white, and red pepper for the green (as I happened to have red peppers in the house). I plan to add some tuna to some of it & have it for lunch today.

Yo Dude,
  I made this once as per directions and found out I had a problem.   The next time I made a double batch and that seemed to cure it.  Great stuff.....a real keeper.  Thanks

This was a really all-around good macaroni salad that my family enjoyed. I used sharp cheddar instead of american cheese though...a little more upscale, plus I hate processed american. Great for picnics!

This was a good recipe.  However, I did make a few changes...I used pickle relish instead of dill pickles, added shrimp, used  about 1/2 cup fat free thousand island dressing in place of some of the mayo, and used shredded cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand.  My husband loved it, which is my biggest success measure.

This Salad Was Good!  Had A Great Tang To It.  I Did Make Changes To It.  I Added 1 Cup Onion, 1/2 Of Celery Because I Didn't Have Green Peppers, Did Not Add The Cheese Or The Eggs (I'm Not A Big Fan Of Eggs.), I Thinly Sliced Some Carrots And Added Some Garlic Powder. I Also Used Some Dill Pickles We Canned.  The Crunch Of The Celery, Carrot, And Onion Was Awesome.  Thank You For The Recipe.

Love this recipe and have made it too many times to count!  Works great with potato as well.  I do always make a double batch of the sauce  and use as needed because I also feel that as written it can be a little dry.  I'm not a big fan of sweet salads so the dill pickles is a hit with me.

What a wonderful change from the usual "ho-hum" macaroni salad.  We're in a Northeast "heatwave" so cooked this up this morning and will have for dinner w/grilled steaks.  (I've already sampled it so know how wonderful it's going to be!)

Awesome! For years I have made macaroni salad without a recipe, throwing the ingredients together and mixing with mayo. I never would have thought to use cider vinegar or jarred pimento peppers. I made this for Easter dinner, and one of the guests said it was the best macaroni salad she had ever eaten. Like other reviewers, I doubled the dressing to prevent it from being too dry. I also added 1/2 cup chopped celery for the crunch, and substituted cheddar cheese for the American cheese. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. This was very good, I will use this recipe from now on.

This Recipe was great.  I've been using the same one for a long time because I couldn't find another good one but this one sure fit the bill.  I added some Cucumbers and Celery for an extra crunch.  Finally I can switch out my salad recipes every now and then.

Excellent salad, Jim! Due to personal preferences, I eliminated the cheese and green peppers. For a different flavor try adding 2t horseradish, 2t Dijon mustard and increasing the vinegar a bit. I always add 1/2cup lite sour cream to the light mayo. The next day it was a little dry, like all pasta salads are. Just add a touch of milk.

I admit I had my doubts about the strange assortment of ingredients, but it's actually very tasty together.  I omitted the cheese and substituted orange bell pepper for the green to give it a bit more color.  Everyone loved it.

Many thanks for this wonderful recipe.  We have it A LOT during the summer with our many bbq's and we never tire of it.  Sometimes, I just like having it for lunch.  I send it with friends to take on vacation and I have had many requests for the recipe.  I send them here to All Recipes to look you up.  What else do you have to share? Revision...STILL the best and most requested salad I make (2008).

Very good pasta salad Jim! Omitted the eggs and used 1 cup mayo and added 1/2c miracle whip...which I'm glad I did b/c after chilling, (as so many others mentioned) the noodles soak up alot of it! Only 1 person (of the 6 I served it to) didn't like it and I guess the majority rules! Thanks!

Boil the pasta and eggs in different pots, at the same time while chopping the rest of the ingredients. Used a cup of real cheddar cheese cubed from a block of cheese (we live in Wisconsin, real cheese is better!) and 8 oz. (instead of 16 oz.) shell pasta. Dressed with the 1 cup mayo but used no vinegar.  Good basic recipe that could easily be embellished if you like. Perhaps ham, bacon, tomatoes or whatever as other reviewers have said.

Thank you for the recipe Jim! My husband said after one bite, shortly after thrown together "Best. Mac. Salad. Ever." I didn't make any changes, just added celtic salt as the salt, which I love. Can't wait to see what people think tomorrow!

I leave out the olives and pimentos, and I tend to make my own version of a creamy dressing based on one my grampa made for most of my childhood, but this is a GREAT salad. It's very versatile, you can add in other veggies, take some away, whatever suits your tastes (or your guests) that day.

This is a very tasty recipe! I like to let it sit overnight so the flavors can mingle. The one thing I changed was to use less macaroni. Because the recipe as it is makes A LOT of salad, but not enough sauce.  I used about 12 ounces of macaroni vs. 16 ounces.  Right now my 2 yr old is "Mmm Mmm!"-ing this salad!

Great with few changes. I made with 8 oz tiny shells, 2 eggs, and kept the other ingredients the same amounts. As everyone says, up, up, up the dressing! I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill, and Velveeta Shreds for the cheese. A little celery salt, & perfect! I'll add a little dressing before serving tonight. Thanks!

I made this for a luncheon for 200 people, and everyone loved it!! My salad was the only one that didn't have any left over.  I used small shell macaroni, but instead of dill pickles and bell peppers, I used frozen green peas and carrots and colby/longhorn cheese cubes.

This turned out ok.  A little bland.  I added chili powder and that helped some, but can't quite figure out what it's missing.

I made a few substitutions according to taste and what I had on hand: omitted the eggs, added a can of tuna, used green onions, sweet pickles and cubed Cheddar cheese. Also I didn't have cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. Although these seem like substantial changes, the salad was terrific and I bet it would be great as the recipe was written, too.

Overall, a very good macaroni salad.  We also found it to be a bit dry, and thought it needed more mayonnaise.  I will probably up the eggs and pickles next time, and leave out the green peppers. I will definitely make it again, just with some variation!! Thanks!

I'm not a big fan of macaroni salad, but I LOVE this one!  Every time I make it for a BBQ or picnic I have to save a little at home for me because I know I won't have any leftovers!  Everyone wants this recipe after they've tried it.  I think the key is that it's not too mayonnaisey, and it has great flavor!

Made it almost verbatim. Used celery instead of bell pepper. And added some green olives, also. It was quite tasty. Not as bland as most macaroni salad.  Will make again.

This salad was very good...I don't like soupy salad , so the  dressing was perfect for me...Didn't have pimentos or green pepper, so i used peas and shredded carrots for color. I will use them next time, because I believe these ingredients will improve the overall  flavor

Best macaroni salad ever!!! Blows the plain ordinary macaroni salad out of the water! Lol... I made this recipe for my son-in-laws wedding and it was a big hit! Everyone one was raving and telling everyone else to try this salad. The only thing I did different is I tripled the recipe and I used cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese slices. I also added some milk before serving to make it a little more moist and creamy.
I won't be going back to the same old same old macaroni salad again! Thanks Jim!!!

I did read other reviews and decided to double the "dressing" right off the bat.  This was the effect anyway, because I actually used 1/2 the amount of pasta because I only had spaghetti noodles or 8 oz of penne pasta on hand...so I opted for the penne.  I also added just a splash of 1/2 & 1/2 to make sure the "dressing" was a little thinner so it could make it into the tubes :)    On a side note, I do realize the "pasta to dressing" ratio is  just a preference...others may like it less creamy, so it may suit them fine as written.  The things I ommited were out of necessity  because I  didn't have them...(pimento, dill pickles, cheese) it was great without them, but I would like to try it next time exactly as written.  I also used a yellow pepper instead of green (again, just because that's what I had).  The two ingredients that I think made this dish unique was the cider vinegar and the black olives.  I left out the eggs, just because I forgot!   I boiled them, and chilled them, but then left them in the fridge!   Besides the splash of 1/2 & 1/2...and a couple hearty shakes of Italian Seasoning...the only significant thing I  added was a can of tuna because I was preparing this as a main dish since our heat index was over 100.   Was supposed to feed me and my mom since my husband wasn't hungry, but by that evening, the bowl was empty as all three of us revisted the fridge :)   I'll definitely make again, thanks Jim for the recipe!!

I was looking for a very traditional pasta salad for a 4th of July potluck at work and I thought this recipe fit the bill perfectly.  Unfortunately, the most common feedback was that it was very bland.  I had hoped all the add ins would make up what I thought the dressing lacked in flavor but this was not the case and I returned home with almost as much salad as I brought.

A basic, tasty macaroni salad that allows lots of add-in choices based on personal preference.  I added ham but not olives.  Sweet relish instead of dill pickles.  Found it necessary to thin the dressing slightly - used milk plus a little liquid from a jar of hot and sweet salad peppers.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add celery salt.

Great recipe, thanks!  I agreed with a couple of reviewers about doubling the dressing (1/2 when made 1/2 before serving).  I used velveta cubes instead of American Cheese.

Instead of cheese slices I added cheese cubes that were cut in half. This was delicious!

My mother always made a macaroni salad that tasted like this. She got the recipe from her Danish grandmother. I made the recipe as called for, but doubled the dressing. I also added cheddar cheese instead of American. I wasn't going to put in the eggs, but am so glad that I did! A nice touch. I will make Macaroni Salad from this recipe from now on!

Very good recipe but, as other reviewers have noted, on the dry side.  I made about 30% more dressing than called for and after a couple of hours in the fridge, it has soaked it all in.  Next time, I'll make a double batch of the dressing and keep half on the side for the next day.

Dressing is very good with some crushed garlic added in.

I'm dumping my old recipe for this one!  Macaroni salad is typically bland but this one is tasty and can easily be spiced with add-ins like diced salami and sharp cheese.  This one's a keeper and I'm looking forward to taking it to the next function.

This was pretty good! Not the kind of macaroni salad that I am used to, but good nonetheless. I felt like it was missing something... maybe some garlic powder?

This was a switch.....my husband usually hates any type of macaroni salad and I like it but this time he liked it and I wasn't crazy about it.  I'm not really sure what it was but I didn't really care for it.  I might make it again and leave out the egg perhaps.

My husband really likes macaroni salad, and this was a hit with him.  I found it to be a bit too dry, so you might want to add more mayonnaise if you like saucier salad.  Otherwise, though, this recipe was good.

I was looking for a large salad to take to my for church for a funeral luncheon.  This was very easy to make and when I tasted it, I knew I would have to make some for the family.  This is a keeper.

I found this very tasty.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add any cheese, which I don't care for.  I instead threw in some diced radish and green onions.  I also added more hard boiled egg, which I love.  This is a recipe you can make your own very easily.
