this is an excellent recipe.  the first time i made it i pretty much followed the recipe but the second time i; added 1 t cumin, 1/4 t chipote powder, used no fat 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and made a slurry of flour and water to thicken.  it made a great recipe even better - spicier and thicker.

I made this the night before and the flavor definitely improved after sitting overnight...I used one can of cream corn and a can of whole kernel corn.  I added an extra carrot and diced up one medium sized potato.  In addition, I doubled the garlic and used about one and a half cups of milk.  I added red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and some hot sauce (since I left out the green chile pepper).  Okay recipe, easy to put together...probably won't make again.

This is really simple and really good... my definition of a 5 star recipe. There was another Mexican Corn Chowder recipe on this website that had a lot more reviews but it used half & half and 2 cups of cheese, so I chose this one instead because it's ingredients were healthier. I made a few changes: 1. omitted the celery 2. added about 1/4 cup green pepper when I sauteed the onions and carrots 3. used fresh oregano instead of dried b/c I had it on hand 4. added one can of creamed corn and used frozen corn kernels to make up the  difference to get to the 3 1/2 cups 5. only used one cup of milk 6.I didn't have a chile pepper on hand, so I added some hot sauce and red pepper flakes to taste. Overall, this was a really great recipe. I laid out shredded cheese, diced red onion, tomatoes, and cilantro as toppers, and served with tortilla chips. I served it with a baked potato and it made the perfect dinner. I will definitely make this again. Update: I've made this again without the creamed corn alteration and I don't recommend that. The creamed corn helps thicken the soup. Otherwise take the other advice and use some flour to thicken. Overall, still versatile enough to doctor up to your preferences.

This was really good, but instead of fresh corn, I did one can of creamed corn and one drained can of kernel corn. I used veggie broth instead of chicken, and celery flakes instead of regular celery because that's what I had. I added some green pepper and did a full 6 oz. can of green chiles. I added a touch more oregano, and some chili powder and cayenne pepper. However, I only needed 1 cup of milk. I don't know if it was because I used the creamed corn, but 1 cup of milk was definitely enough. Overall, this was tasty, and I'm sure I will make it again. Went together quickly.

This is a really great way to use leftover chicken! It's not too hot, so if you like it hot add some hot sauce or cayenne. I used half and half the second time intsead of milk because I had it lying around... and I would advise against doing that. Stick with milk. Delicious!!!

this is SO good! it works with 1/2 the butter. try adding 1/2 a habanero for spice and top with your own crumbled fried tortillas and lots of cilantro.  YUM! (any advice on how to make it thicker?)

I really enjoyed this chowder. A good cold weather, rib sticking dish.  I added flour to the sauteed veggies once they were softened and used homemade chicken stock to thicken the soup a bit. I forgot to add the milk. Still Yummy:) This went well with my grown up  grilled cheese. Thankx Bushy.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I took other people's advice and used 1 can whole corn kernels and 1 can creamed corn.  I also used only 1 cup of milk and traded jalapeno peppers in for the green chile peppers.  I can't wait to make this again.

This one didn't work for me.  It was bland and the only thing that made it Mexican were the additions for serving.

This is the first soup I ever made from this site where no one wanted the leftovers - it wasn't spicy at all, hardly any taste at all except for the corn - it was like eating a bowl of corn (too much) in chicken broth diluted with milk.

This one started smelling good long before it was finished, which is a good place to start!  I added another cup of chicken stock, a green and red pepper, and a couple kicks of hot sauce as well as some cayanne which gave this dish a spicey jump.  It's a good simple receipe if you're looking for something hot and filling.

This soup was excellent.  There are many ways to modify this recipe if you wanted to as well.  My husband doesn't like carrots, so I skipped them...I served it with warm tortillas, and added a little shredded cheese on top of each bowl full.
I usually have all these ingredients on hand, and it was SO EASY to make.  We will definitely have this again...and again.  I give this an A+++ !!

This recipe was easy and great tasting. I pureed some of the cooked corn and veggies before adding the chicken and milk. This helped thicken it up with out adding more cream.

This was really good. I used 2 cans kernel corn and 1 can of cream style corn. I also added 2 small potatoes (quarter). I took notes from another lady and added a tsp of cumin (hubby is Hispanic and they add cumin to EVERYTHING) and 1 tsp of crushed red peppers (I didn't have the green chili pepper). It taste great even without the milk!

Delicious - I didn't add celery, but added some green pepper, 2 cloves of garlic, cumin and fresh oregano. Used more milk with a little flour to thicken it up a bit as I wanted it to make a little extra. We really enjoyed this one and will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe to a t and found it to be a very thing chowder and lacking in flavor.  I will try it again but definitely modify it with some peppers and creamed soup or creamed corn.
