I feel like I just came back from my mom's kitchen in Puerto Rico! Let me tell you about this dish. It's heaven on Earth. I love the flavors and the different textures of this dish. If you don't like fish, you'd still like this. It is not "fishy". If you don't like raisins, you won't know they are there. They give a hint of sweetness to every bite. The capers and olives a hint of tanginess and a bit of saltiness, just enough to make it wonderful. You can serve this with a side of white rice or with some boiled roots (like yuca, malanga, yautia...etc) OR just do like I am doing right now...eat a bowl of it by itself before it dissapears. Thanks Milly!

I must add that due to the overfishing of cod over the years, it is easier to find salted pollock (another white fish) sold as 'salted cod'. The term 'salted cod' has become a generic term for salted white fish. Pollock is less expensive, comes in convenient boned filets and works fine for this recipe. The flavor is less intense, but this might be a positive for those who didn't like salted cod because of that.

My family has been making codfish for years now, normally I don't really eat it so they try not to make it while am around. in this case I decided to make it for them, Wow it was delicious. They were all very impressed and they loved it.

I had high expectations for this due to all the interesting flavor combinations involved, but it turned out sort of bland. Maybe rosemary would help, and definitely salt and pepper. I would probably do it in the oven next time, rather than the stovetop.

This dish was spectacular. I can`t believe salted cod can be so good. I didn`t have capers, so used more green olives and used rose wine instead. And I roasted peppers in my oven. Very good.

I first had this in Mexico on New Year's Eve and it was delightful. I changed it to match what I remembered by using fresh cod and omitting the eggs and it was still very good.

This is an excellent recipe! Bacalao is a staple at our big family dinners but I never cared for it much because I found it plain and salty. I decided to try this recipe and everyone loved it! I halved the amount of capers and olives because I assumed it would come out salty but it didn't. I soaked the fish overnight and changed the water 3 times and it came out fantastic. I will use the full amount of olives next time. I prepared it with boiled Yucca and maduros. I also added some of my homemade sofrito. WOW!

OMG, this is absolutely delicious. Made according to recipe. Next time  will add a little more Cod. I used Frozen Cod and had to add a little salt to dish since Cod was not salted. This was a BIG hit in my family tonight. Cooked Yucca for a side dish.

My husband is from Mexico and bacalao is a traditional dish for Christmas and New Years. This recipe was just what we were looking for, we only omitted the hard-boiled eggs to fit the Mexican version. We served it with bolillo rolls which is also traditional. I was able to find the dry salted cod at New Seasons and Whole Foods. Be sure to follow exactly the directions for soaking the cod and changing out the water to get just the right balance of salt in the recipe.

Really good and something different for me. After reading many recipes for Bacalao I opted to use fresh cod loan, one 12oz. jar of Sofrito Tomato Cooking Base and one packet of Sazon seasoning from Goya brands.  Four medium size potatoes and one large red onion seemed like enough. I also used one cup of chicken stock instead of water. Next time I will definitely double the amount of cod;  one pound as stated in the recipe seemed to get lost. I did add just a little fresh chopped cilantro on top. I was a bit skeptical, but I did not stir once layered and the finished dish came out great. I served in bowels on top of  white rice and garnished with avocado slices and mini corn muffins.  This is one of those recipes you can really have fun with to suite your personal tastes. I will definitely make this again.

This dish was AMAZING!!! I didn't have any garlic at hand so I used garlic salt. Right before I poured the water and wine over it I seasoned it with salt and pepper.I baked it in the oven at 350 for an hour covered with foil. I then served it with white rice but I'm thinking next time I will serve it with green bananas!! YUMMY!!!

I wanted to try salt cod and chose this dish as the vehicle.  I didn't like the salt cod (although I really like fresh cod) and I think it spoiled the rest of the dish for me. I followed the recipe.  It's just personal preference, I think.

loved it! easy prep. I followed the suggestion of eating it with an avocado slice, yummy! 
I didn't add the raisins ( forgot) and didn't add the boiled eggs (don't eat meat, but would it fish). thanks for sharing!

I made it last night and it turned out good I guess.   There seemed to be something lacking.  I only got 1 or 2 raisins which does help the flavor.   I used Calamata olives because that is all I had and I don't like green olives.  I am not sure what I would change other than adding more raisins or something else.  Maybe it needs spices or something???

I added oregano and 4 cloves of garlic (pressed). It turned out delicious. Thanks for the recipe!
