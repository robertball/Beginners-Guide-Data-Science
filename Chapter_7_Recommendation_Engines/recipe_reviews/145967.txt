This is "quick and easy" plus it's a nice twist on a classic that goes great with tomato soup! I used sourdough bread and added the herbs to the butter before spreading on the bread. I also added a slice or two of tomato to give it even more pizzaz. This one of my all time favorites! Thanks for a great recipe!

I changed the directions slightly. I stirred the spices into the butter, then spread it onto the bread. Nice new way to eat grilled cheese. We all enjoyed it. Next time, I think I'll add some garlic powder.

These smelled so good that my mouth was watering waiting for them to be finished cooking. They tasted as great as they smelled too. The only downside was the amount of herbage inside. I couldn't finish this no matter how good it was because there was simply too much green stuff and it was kind of woody and similar to eating lots of grass or leaves on a sandwich in texture, so minus points for that... I reread the directions and I didn't make an error, but wow there had to be a mistake somewhere the way mine turned out. Thanks, this can be modified to be fabulous.

Excellent way to spice up grilled cheese! I did cut back a little on all the herbs. Wish I had found this sooner! My kids LOVED it! (and they can be pretty picky)

The herbs add nice flavor.  I used regular sandwich bread.  Next time,I may try a milder cheddar and maybe sourdough or some other bread.

It never dawned on me to add herbs to spice up this age old sandwhich :)  I even burnt it and it was still good!  Next time I will watch it closer.

This was good. Different, which is what I was looking for. I made the sandwitches out of french bread. Delicious..but how can you go wrong with grilled cheese?! :)
