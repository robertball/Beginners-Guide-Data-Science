I made this recipe for this past thanksgiving & it was a hit.  The only thing that I did different with the recipe was using reduced fat cream cheese rather than the fat-free kind.  I find that the fat-free does not cook as well.  As I said, it was a hit & I have made it twice more since then.

These are awesome...you don't miss the regular sugar at all. I have a very picky family and they loved them!  Will make over and over!  Thank you!

The finished product is good and, in fact, very delicately pumpkin flavored.   Quite delicate.   :)  We do appreciate the low-calories!

I made these for dessert for Thanksgiving and Christmas and they were a hit!  My husband didn't even know they were "healthy"!

My family loved this recipe.Warm was good but you could taste the pumpkin more when it was chilled in the refrigerator. Very smooth and creamy.
