I was hesitant about the feta but it really makes a difference in the taste. Nice flavor and I think perfect for a potluck. I did do what others suggest- used 1/4 cup water, oil and rice vinegar. I also added a shredded carrot for color and added flavor.

This is sooo good! I have been serving it instead of a regaluar salad.  I used equal parts (1/4 cup) water, vinegar and olive oil.

Good slaw.  I reduced the olive oil a bit, and used basil/marjoram as someone else suggested.  The feta is an unusual and good touch.

I made this slaw one night when we had some friends over.  It was the one thing that everyone had seconds of!  I will make this recipe a regular in my kitchen.  I did cut the olive oil back to 1/2 cup.

Wonderful recipe!  My family doesn't like traditional cole slaw but this was gone in minutes. Tupperware has a GREAT Italian seasoning, that I really like with this recipe.

O.M.G.  This is the best coleslaw recipe I've ever had the pleasure to review!!!!  I didn't have feta so I left it out. I was a little concerned about the amount of pepper... but it was just right.  This is an excellent recipe.... hope you like it as much as I did!  Oh... and, IMHO... the oil amount is just right.  I'm still munching on it 3 days later and it just keeps getting better.

i followed this recipe as described with the exception of using less oil as other reviewers have noted, but found the taste a bit too salty for my liking.  I would recommend adding a little at a time and tasting along the way.

Good alternative too the original.  Still, I think next time I will use less oil.  I also soaked the cabbage in saltwater, rinsed it, then dried it.  It got lots of compliments at the potluck.

This is now my favorite slaw. Yum! Came back to get the recipe again for supper. Used shredded green cabbage and carrots the first time (guessed on the amounts), and apple cider vinegar. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious!  I, too, have been looking for a non-sweet cabbage salad and this fits the bill perfectly.  I used white wine vinegar and left out the water completely.  I also added some shredded carrots and a thinly sliced fresh green chile (anaheim or similar), which added a nice dimension to the flavor.  Oh, and I'll put crumbled feta on anything, so this really appealed to me. :)

This was really terrific.  I made it for Christmas dinner.  My daughter, who is not a big eater, ate three helpings of this.  I used a head of green cabbage, regular onion and added some green pepper.  It was fantastic!

I had a 12 oz bag of cole slaw mix in the refrigerator and used it for the recipe. So, I cut back a bit on the liquid ingredients, tasting the dressing as I mixed. Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again.

I LOVE this recipe!! I've fixed it several times this summer and it is invariably the hit of the party.  I can't remember a non-dessert dish that has gotten such raves ... and it's insanely easy.  The only change I make is to cut back on the oil.  It's best served the day you make it.

Yummy! The amount of olive oil perhaps wasn't as necessary, so I cut that back a bit. The feta is an interesting touch to otherwise boring coleslaw, and ideal at picnics or summer BBQs. Will be making this again.

Made as recipe stated.  I had no problem with too much liquid, maybe beause I stirred it off and on.  I love that it can sit in the frig for a day or two and is still good.  Will make again.

loved this slaw without SUGAR, which is tough to find!  cut down the oil to 1/4 cup...found it to be a little too peppery, but that's just my taste.  Overall I thought it was great!  Ate it as a side dish to some turkey burgers - fantastic!!

LOVE IT!!!!  I tried it with oregano, basil, a pinch of sugar, and a few thinly sliced roma tomatoes.  Serve it with meat/soy balls of your choice.  I can't think of anything appropriate to call it.  :-)

I made two changes. 1 - I used greek seasoning as I was out of Italian and 2 - I used a 16 oz bag of coleslaw (not the 8.5 as recipe states I couldn't even find one in the store that small). With more cabbage mix the dressing ratio was good. Overall - I really enjoyed this.

Yum! I’ve been looking for a coleslaw recipe that doesn’t use mayo. I used a whole head of cabbage (shredded), red wine vinegar and 4 cloves of garlic... versus what was instructed. I loved the flavor of the feta and the other ingredients really complimented the cabbage. I will definitely make this again... though next time I think I’ll use a bit less olive oil. Thanks, Shirina, for a great recipe!

I'm eating this as I type, and I'm surprised and a little bit disappointed to say it's actually a little bland for me. i did add some cucumber, jalapeno and red bell pepper though, so the vinaigrette may be stretched too thin. the feta is great in here though and it's quite nice and light. will add more salt, pepper, slightly more vinegar and maybe a dash of tabasco and squeeze of lemon juice.

Love this slaw! It's like none I've ever tried... really unique. The second time I made this I still used the two bags of angelhair cabbage, and the full amount of green onions and garlic, but I reduced all the other ingredients by half, including the feta. At first I didn't think there was enough dressing, but after the slaw sits in the fridge for 15 min. or so, it works out fine. This tamed it down a little (as written, it's pretty strong in taste) and for my family it was perfect. Love this slaw with grilled or broiled steaks. Yum!

This slaw is so flavorful, and it's easy to prepare. It's actually a touch too strong for me, so next time I'll add just a bit more cabbage. It's very rich--a little goes a long way. I used feta with herbs, and fresh basil and oregano instead of dried. I also reduced the olive oil (this salad is rich enough with the cheese) and used white wine vinegar. I'm a salt freak, but I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and found it plenty salty. I think this would be good with tomatoes to mellow out the tang a bit.

I made this last night for lunch today, but I just snuck a little taste and I'm not sure it's going to last that long. Wow, is this good! I pretty much eyeballed the ingredients, tasting it until it was how I liked it. The feta I used was pretty tangy and salty, so I added a tiny amount of Splenda too. This really is very delicious. I will definitely make it again in the coming bbq/potluck months. Thanks!

I'm not a fan of traditional slaw, but my boyfriends family serves it at almost every meal.  This time I was able to bring my own and enjoy it too!  A great alternative and one that I would make over and over again.

I thought this was pretty good but not enough texture.  I don't like when people critique a recipe with total changes, but I am suggesting the changes to this one based on my experience of changing it.  I would add slivered almonds and ramen noodles for texture.  The dressing is very good as well as the addition of feta cheese.  I used the garlic/herb feta which also added a new dimension.

I love this recipe!  It is fantastic as is. But once I was out of feta cheese and used Kraft Meditterranean Crumbles cheese, now I use provolone cheese in addition to the feta all the time because I like the texture and smoky flavor it gives to the recipe.

This was a very good recipe, being Greek, I love using Feta cheese!  Instead of using the traditional slaw, I used broccoli slaw, which was excellent.   
Thank you for the delish recipe!

I have been looking for a cole slaw recipe that is like the one my grandma used to make. This is as close as it gets. I'm not a fan of the sweet cole slaw - this is perfect. The combination of ingredients with the feta cheese was excellent! I can't wait to make it again.

This was really good!  I used Napa cabbage because that's what I had, and I added a little extra Italian seasoning on accident, and it was perfect.  It went really well with steak and made a super easy, delicious meal.  Thanks!

Love this - I cheated and used good seasons salad dressing and it was great! Just mixed the dressing, bag of cabbage and feta - sooo easy!  Added fresh gound black pepper just before serving.  I'll make this often. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

My sister made this for a family get-together and now we're all making it! Even my young daughter took it to a picnic and everyone raved! We reduce the oil, and the feta cheese adds a great flavor. Using less oil, this is a great, low point slaw for us dieters!

Awesome!  I have never liked creamy slaw, but love raw cabbage. I've looked and looked for an alternative, and WHA-LA!  here it is!!  VERY quick to make.  Made a few changes as per other users. Used 1/4 olive oil, rice wine vinegar and water, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/2 pepper (still very peppery w/ that amount, which I like.  Reduce even more if you're not fond of pepper), and 4 oz of feta cheese (as that is what the store bought packages come in).  Husband and kids loved it!!  Gone in a day!!  Thanks Paige!  This will be a favorite for years to come!

I don't think this recipe needs any tweaking. I made it exactly as directed and it turned out super. It was one of the sides I served this year with my Easter ham. Everyone commented on how delicious it was and there were no left overs. Thanks for an easy winning recipe!

We are big fans of cole slaw, rather it be creamy, oily, vinegar base, etc.  This one was intriguing as it has feta cheese in it and it has been in my recipe box for over 2 years.  It was high time I made it.  So glad I did as my family loved it.  I liked that it did not contain any sugar or sweeteners.  I used a head of cabbage that I had on hand rather than the packages of angel hair cole slaw.  I also added 2 carrots for color and I wanted to use them up also.  I mixed up the dressing in the morning, using just a ½ c. EVOO.  I added the dressing to the slaw about an hour before serving and added the feta cheese right before serving.   Great slaw that I will definitely be making again.

I made this for the Teachers BBQ lunch and many asked for the recipe. It was easy to make but very tasty and lighter version of the traditional. I decreased olive oil to 1/4 as well. This is a keeper!

Oh, wow- yummy! Way better than I thought it would be! Kept everything the same except used 1 c. feta. (had a large container) 8 oz of cheese is usually 2 cups, but I feel the one cup is adequate. Don't expect the sweet, creamy style & I'll bet you'll love it, too! Great for low carb!

A super easy recipe.  You have to really like feta cheese to like this salad.  I think I'll use some different seasonings last time, because you also really have to be a fan of the italian seasoning flavors.  All in all a nice change.

This is OK.  Definitely a good change from the usual mayo based slaw.  I followed the recipe exactly, except used Italian Salad Dressing instead of the water and Italian seasoning and white onion instead of green onion (what I had on hand).  Tasted good, but taste is definitely strong (feta is a great balance).  Will make it occasionally for potlucks and summer get-togethers.  VERY easy.

Loved this coleslaw!!!  Love that there is no mayo or sugar.  Used a 10 oz bag of slaw so 1/2'd all the liquid and used equal amounts as others suggested.  If you love feta cheese...you will love this recipe:)

Excellent recipe, very similar to a popular restaurant’s version.  There is a lot of feta in this, so you must like feta if you wish to make this.  It is the first alas to disappear when I bring it to cookouts, and I get tons of compliments!

Absolutely love this simple recipe.  I have made it with and without feta, with and without green onions, and every time it is a big hit.  I also used rice vinegar once and it wasn't quite as good, but, regardless this is one of my favorite dishes and NO SUGAR.  I tried it mainly because we share the name and I love cabbage.

This brought my coleslaw hating hubby back for THIRDS, and everyone else raved about this vinegar slaw. This is an ideal recipe for diabetics since there's no added sugar, and for those of us who dislike traditional creamy slaw it's a tasty and healthy alternative. I just made a few changes: subbed rice wine and red wine vinegars for white and increased the amount of vinegar, black pepper, and green onion. After tossing it thoroughly and marinating for half an hour, the coleslaw decreased in volume and the flavors really melded to perfection. This will forever be my go-to coleslaw. Thanks for sharing!

At work we recently did a "Crock Pot Luck".  I made this coleslaw to top the pulled pork that I made.  I work with a lot of young people that will eat anything.  Some of them told me that they really didn't like coleslaw, but this was amazing.  I think that says it all!

Made exactly as written it was so much better than the sweet slaw most often served.  This is almost like an Italian dressed salad and the feta cheese adds just the right flavor and creaminess.  Makes ample dressing so you could add shredded carrots or something.  But for now I'm not changing a thing.  Will certainly make again, maybe tonight.  Thanks!

I have made this salad per the directions for my last few dinner parties and every time I am asked for the recipe.  I actually had one of my guests HOUND/HUNT me down for the recipe.  Delicious, perfect just as written, no changes needed.  I am addicted, I crave the flavors and am making another batch right now.
